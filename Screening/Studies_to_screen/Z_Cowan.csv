article,Interacting with wildlife tourism increases activity of white sharks,"Huveneers, Charlie and Watanabe, Yuuki Y. and Payne, Nicholas L. and Semmens, Jayson M.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Anthropogenic activities are dramatically changing marine ecosystems. Wildlife tourism is one of the fastest growing sectors of the tourism industry and has the potential to modify the natural environment and behaviour of the species it targets. Here, we used a novel method to assess the effects of wildlife tourism on the activity of white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias). High frequency three-axis acceleration loggers were deployed on ten white sharks for a total of similar to 9 days. A combination of multivariate and univariate analysis revealed that the increased number of strong accelerations and vertical movements when sharks are interacting with cage-diving operators result in an overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) similar to 61\% higher compared with other times when sharks are present in the area where cage-diving occurs. Since ODBA is considered a proxy of metabolic rate, interacting with cage-divers is probably more costly than are normal behaviours of white sharks at the Neptune Islands. However, the overall impact of cage-diving might be small if interactions with individual sharks are infrequent. This study suggests wildlife tourism changes the instantaneous activity levels of white sharks, and calls for an understanding of the frequency of shark-tourism interactions to appreciate the net impact of ecotourism on this species' fitness.",2018,10.1093/conphys/coy019,6,NA,NA,coy019,accelerometry; Carcharodon carcharias; ecotourism; energy budget; metabolic rate
article,Concentrations of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites in Asian elephant's dung are stable for up to 8 h in a tropical environment,"Wong, Ee Phin and Yon, Lisa and Purcell, Rebecca and Walker, Susan L. and Othman, Nasharuddin and Saaban, Salman and Campos-Arceiz, Ahimsa",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"The use of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCMs) has facilitated the development of non-invasive methods to study physiological conditions of endangered wildlife populations. One limitation is that fGCM concentrations are known to change over time and to vary according to different environmental conditions. The aim of this study was to perform a controlled dung decay experiment to understand the impact of time (since defecation) and two common environmental variables (exposure to water and direct sunlight) on fGCM concentrations of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus). Eighty dung piles from 10 Malaysian elephants were randomly exposed to a 2 x 2 combination of treatments (wet-shade, dry-shade, wet-sun and dry-sun) and repeatedly subsampled from the time of defecation through to 2 days post-defecation (n = 685 faecal subsamples). Overall, the mean concentration of fGCMs was stable in samples of up to 8 h old from defecation time, regardless of environmental treatment (water or direct sunlight); thereafter, the overall mean fGCM concentrations increased, peaking 1 day after defecation (31.8\% higher than at defecation time), and subsequently decreased (reaching values 9.2\% below defecation time on the second day). Overall, the treatment of sun exposure resulted in higher fGCM concentration compared with shade, whereas water exposure (compared with no water exposure) had no impact on fGCM concentrations. Hence, in field studies we recommend collecting dung samples < 8 h old and recording shade conditions (e.g. sun vs. shade) as a covariate for the subsequent interpretation of fGCM measurements. This study has helped to identify the optimal window for sampling in which we can have a higher confidence in interpreting the results as being a genuine reflection of glucocorticoid status in the elephant.",2016,10.1093/conphys/cow070,4,NA,NA,cow070,Adrenal activity; Asian elephant; dung decay; Elephas maximus; faecal glucocorticoid metabolites; non-invasive monitoring
article,Stress and body condition are associated with climate and demography in Asian elephants,"Mumby, Hannah S. and Mar, Khyne U. and Thitaram, Chatchote and Courtiol, Alexandre and Towiboon, Patcharapa and Min-Oo, Zaw and Htut-Aung, Ye and Brown, Janine L. and Lummaa, Virpi",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Establishing links between ecological variation, physiological markers of stress and demography is crucial for understanding how and why changes in environmental conditions affect population dynamics, and may also play a key role for conservation efforts of endangered species. However, detailed longitudinal studies of long-lived species are rarely available. We test how two markers of stress and body condition vary through the year and are associated with climatic conditions and large-scale mortality and fertility variation in the world's largest semi-captive population of Asian elephants employed in the timber industry in Myanmar. Glucocorticoid metabolites (used as a proxy for stress levels in 75 elephants) and body weight (used as a proxy for condition in 116 elephants) were monitored monthly across a typical monsoon cycle and compared with birth and death patterns of the entire elephant population over half a century (n = 2350). Our results show seasonal variation in both markers of stress and condition. In addition, this variation is correlated with population-level demographic variables. Weight is inversely correlated with population mortality rates 1 month later, and glucocorticoid metabolites are negatively associated with birth rates. Weight shows a highly positive correlation with rainfall 1 month earlier. Determining the factors associated with demography may be key to species conservation by providing information about the correlates of mortality and fertility patterns. The unsustainability of the studied captive population has meant that wild elephants have been captured and tamed for work. By elucidating the correlates of demography in captive elephants, our results offer management solutions that could reduce the pressure on the wild elephant population in Myanmar.",2015,10.1093/conphys/cov030,3,NA,NA,cov030,Elephas maximus; faeces; glucocorticoids; hormone; seasonality; weight
article,The impact of a changing winter climate on the hatch phenology of one of North America's largest Atlantic salmon populations,"Rooke, Anna C. and Palm-Flawd, Brittany and Purchase, Craig F.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"In northern temperate regions, some of the most dramatic effects of climate change are expected during the winter. Understanding how changing winter climates influence the seasonal timing of key life events is critical for implementing effective conservation strategies, especially for poikilotherms, whose physiology and development are particularly sensitive to changes in thermal environment. Four mathematical models are available to predict the timing of hatch and emergence in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar); however, such models are only useful if the effect of temperature is both repeatable within and among maternal families, and predictable across variable temperature regimes. Using a split-brood experiment, we found the timing of hatch to be repeatable and predictable in Atlantic salmon from the Exploits River, one of the largest remaining wild populations in North America. Three of the available mathematical models under-estimated the timing of hatch by an average of 21-26 accumulated thermal units (ATU); however, we identified one model that provided reasonable estimates of hatch timing (average under-estimate 7 ATU) under the three incubation temperature regimes we tested. We applied this model to daily water temperature profiles from 2006-18 at four sites within the Exploits River watershed. Across all years and sites, the predicted dates at 50\% hatch ranged between 8 March and 23 May, while predicted dates of 50\% emergence ranged from 11 May to 13 June. By identifying the seasonal timing of these particularly vulnerable early life stages, this model can aid the implementation of conservation efforts for this ecologically and economically important population.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz015,7,NA,NA,coz015,Climate change; emergence; incubation; phenology; Salmo salar; salmonid
article,Adaptation of a mouse Doppler echocardiograph system for assessing cardiac function and thermal performance in a juvenile salmonid,"Muir, Carlie A. and Neff, Bryan D. and Damjanovski, Sashko",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Measures of cardiac performance are pertinent to the study of thermal physiology and exercise in teleosts, particularly as they pertain to migration success. Increased heart rate, stroke volume and cardiac output have previously been linked to improved swimming performance and increased upper thermal tolerance in anadromous salmonids. To assess thermal performance in fishes, it has become commonplace to measure the response of maximum heart rate to warming using electrocardiograms. However, electrocardiograms do not provide insight into the hemodynamic characteristics of heart function that can impact whole-animal performance. Doppler echocardiography is a popular tool used to examine live animal processes, including real-time cardiac function. This method allows for nonsurgical measurements of blood flow velocity through the heart and has been used to detect abnormalities in cardiovascular function, particularly in mammals. Here, we show how a mouse Doppler echocardiograph system can be adapted for use in a juvenile salmonid over a range of temperatures and timeframes. Using this compact, noninvasive system, we measured maximum heart rate, atrioventricular (AV) blood flowvelocity, the early flow-atrial flow ratio and stroke distance in juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) during acute warming. Using histologically determined measures of AV valve area, we show how stroke distance measurements obtained with this system can be used to calculate ventricular inflow volume and approximate cardiac output. Further, we show how this Doppler system can be used to determine cardiorespiratory thresholds for thermal performance, which are increasingly being used to predict the consequences that warming water temperatures will have on migratory fishes.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab070,9,NA,NA,coab070,thermal performance; Doppler echocardiography; cardiorespiratory performance; cardiac function; Atlantic salmon
article,FishResp: R package and GUI application for analysis of aquatic respirometry data,"Morozov, Sergey and McCairns, R. J. Scott and Merila, Juha",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"FishResp is a user-friendly tool for calculating oxygen uptake of aquatic organisms. The aim of the software is to improve the quality of metabolic rate estimates based on a straightforward pipeline: background respiration correction, detection of mechanical problems, conduction of QC tests, and filtration based on user-defined criteria. Abstract Intermittent-flow respirometry is widely used to measure oxygen uptake rates and subsequently estimate aerobic metabolic rates of aquatic animals. However, the lack of a standard quality-control software to detect technical problems represents a potential impediment to comparisons across studies in the field of evolutionary and conservation physiology. Here, we introduce FishResp', a versatile R package and its graphical implementation for quality-control and filtering of raw respirometry data. Our goal is to provide a straightforward, cross-platform and free software to help improve the quality and comparability of metabolic rate estimates for reducing methodological fragmentation in the field of aquatic respirometry. FishResp accepts data from various respirometry systems, allows users to detect potential mechanical problems which can occur during oxygen uptake measurements (e.g. chamber leaking, poor water circulation), and offers six options to correct raw data for microbial oxygen consumption. The software performs filtering of raw data based on user criteria, and produces accurate and unbiased estimates of absolute and mass-specific metabolic rates. Using data from three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata), we demonstrate the virtues of FishResp, highlighting the importance of detecting mechanical problems and correcting measurements for background respiration.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz003,7,NA,NA,coz003,background respiration; free software; intermittent-flow respirometry; metabolic rate; oxygen uptake; three-spined stickleback; Trinidadian guppy
article,Interannual measures of nutritional stress during a marine heatwave (the Blob) differ between two North Pacific seabird species,"Tate, Heidi M. and Studholme, Katharine R. and Domalik, Alice D. and Drever, Mark C. and Romero, L. Michael and Gormally, Brenna M. G. and Hobson, Keith A. and Hipfner, J. Mark and Crossin, Glenn T.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"`The Blob', a mass of anomalously warm water in the Northeast Pacific Ocean peaking from 2014 to 2016, caused a decrease in primary productivity with cascading effects on the marine ecosystem. Among the more obvious manifestations of the event were seabird breeding failures and mass mortality events. Here, we used corticosterone in breast feathers (fCort), grown in the winter period during migration, as an indicator of nutritional stress to investigate the impact of the Blob on two sentinel Pacific auk species (family Alcidae). Feathers were collected from breeding females over 8 years from 2010 to 2017, encompassing the Blob period. Since Pacific auks replace body feathers at sea during the migratory period, measures of fCort provide an accumulated measure of nutritional stress or allostatic load during this time. Changes in diet were also measured using delta N-15 and delta C-13 values from feathers. Relative to years prior to the Blob, the primarily zooplanktivorous Cassin's auklets (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) had elevated fCort in 2014-2017, which correlated with the occurrence of the Blob and a recovery period afterwards, with relatively stable feather isotope values. In contrast, generalist rhinoceros auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata) displayed stable fCort values across years and increased delta N-15 values during the Blob. As marine heatwaves increase in intensity and frequency due to climate change, this study provides insight into the variable response of Pacific auks to such phenomena and suggests a means for monitoring population-level responses to climatological variation.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab090,9,NA,NA,coab090,the Blob; stable isotopes; Pacific Decadal Oscillation; nutritional stress; feather corticosterone; Alcidae

Kyaw and Aung, Htoo Htoo and Reichert, Sophie and Lummaa, Virpi",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Long-lived species are often predicted to be buffered against seasonal variation: longevity means low annual mortality and reproductive rates and annual variability in climate may therefore have a smaller impact on population growth rates of long-lived species in comparison to short-lived ones. However, little is known of the physiological mechanisms underlying such patterns in long-lived species. In this study, we investigated seasonal variation in the health of Asian elephants living in a seasonal monsoon climate. We used two complementary methods: (i) global and (ii) trait-by-trait analyses of seasonal effects on 23 health parameters of 225 individually marked elephants with known age and reproductive and health history, with repeated measures per individual over a 26-month period. The global analysis highlighted the biggest differences in health between the hot and monsoon seasons. Our trait-specific analyses identified the physiological functions underlying such health variation in different ecological settings, including haematological, immunological, muscular, kidney and liver functions, as well as protein balance and electrolytes. Overall, the results suggest that even long-lived, large mammals may experience physiological changes in response to seasonal variation that in extreme circumstances can pose a significant health risk.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa119,8,NA,NA,coaa119,Environmental heterogeneity; health markers; long-lived mammals; sub-tropical climate

Most reptilian embryos are regularly exposed to thermal stress because they develop in shallow, warm soils for weeks to months. We studied cardiac performance during warming to infer lethal temperatures for embryonic lizards in the Sceloporus undulatus complex. Embryos from four populations throughout the geographical range (New Jersey, South Carolina, Colorado, and Arizona) were warmed at a rate observed in natural nests. Embryos from all populations exhibited a similar pattern of thermal sensitivity, as follows: heart rate rose between 34 and 41 degrees C, remained stable between 41 and 44 degrees C, and dropped sharply between 44 and 47 degrees C. No embryos recovered from cardiac arrest, indicating that the upper lethal temperature was <= 47 degrees C.

article,Efficacy of a sensory deterrent and pipe modifications in decreasing entrainment of juvenile green sturgeon (<i>Acipenser medirostris</i>) at unscreened water diversions,"Poletto, Jamilynn B. and Cocherell, Dennis E. and Mussen, Timothy D. and Ercan, Ali and Bandeh, Hossein and kavvas, M. Levent and Cech, Jr., Joseph J. and Fangue, Nann A.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Water projects designed to extract fresh water for local urban, industrial and agricultural use throughout rivers and estuaries worldwide have contributed to the fragmentation and degradation of suitable habitat for native fishes. The number of water diversions located throughout the Sacramento-San Joaquin watershed in California's Central Valley exceeds 3300, and the majority of these are unscreened. Many anadromous fish species are susceptible to entrainment into these diversions, potentially impacting population numbers. In the laboratory, juvenile green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris) have been shown to have high entrainment rates into unscreened diversions compared with those of other native California fish species, which may act as a significant source of mortality for this already-threatened species. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of a sensory deterrent (strobe light) and two structural pipe modifications (terminal pipe plate and upturned pipe configuration) in decreasing the entrainment of juvenile green sturgeon (mean mass +/- SEM = 162.9 +/- 4.0 g; mean fork length = 39.4 +/- 0.3 cm) in a large (>500 kl) outdoor flume fitted with a water-diversion pipe 0.46 m in diameter. While the presence of the strobe light did not affect fish entrainment rates, the terminal pipe plate and upturned pipe modifications significantly decreased the proportion of fish entrained out of the total number tested relative to control conditions (0.13 +/- 0.02 and 0.03 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.44 +/- 0.04, respectively). These data suggest that sensory deterrents using visual stimuli are not an effective means to reduce diversion pipe interactions for green sturgeon, but that structural alterations to diversions can successfully reduce entrainment for this species. Our results are informative for the development of effective management strategies to mitigate the impacts of water diversions on sturgeon populations and suggest that effective restoration strategies that balance agricultural needs with conservation programmes are possible.",2014,10.1093/conphys/cou056,2,1,NA,cou056,Conservation; entrainment; fish; green sturgeon; swimming performance; water diversion
article,Swimming energetics of Atlantic salmon in relation to extended fasting at different temperatures,"Hvas, Malthe",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Predicted future warming of aquatic environments could make fish vulnerable to naturally occurring fasting periods during migration between feeding and spawning sites, as these endeavours become energetically more expensive. In this study, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) acclimated to midrange (9 degrees C) or elevated suboptimal (18 degrees C) temperatures were subjected to critical (U-crit) and sustained (4 hours at 80\% U-crit) swimming trials before and after 4 weeks of fasting. Fasting caused weight losses of 7.3\% and 8.3\% at 9 degrees C and 18 degrees C, respectively. The Ucrit was unaffected by fasting, but higher at 18. C. Fatigue was associated with higher plasma cortisol, osmolality, Na+ and Cl- at 18 degrees C, and ionic disturbances were higher in fasted fish. All fish completed the sustained swim trials while maintaining constant oxygen uptake rates (M. O-2), indicating strictly aerobic swimming efforts. At low swimming speeds M. O-2 was downregulated in fasted fish by 23.8\% and 15.6\% at 9 degrees C and 18. C, respectively, likely as an adaptation to preserve resources. However, at higher speedsM. O-2 became similar to fed fish showing thatmaximummetabolic ratesweremaintained. The changes inM. O-2 loweredcostsof transport andoptimal swimmingspeeds in fasted fish at both temperatures, but these energetic alterations were smaller at 18 degrees C while routine M. O-2 was 57\% higher than at 9 degrees C. As such, this study shows that Atlantic salmon maintain both glycolytic and aerobic swimming capacities after extended fasting, even at elevated suboptimal temperatures, and adaptive metabolic downregulation provides increased swimming efficiency in fasted fish. Although, improved swimming energetics were smaller when fasting at the higher temperature while metabolism becomes elevated. This could affect migration success in warming climates, especially when considering interactions with other costly activities such as coping with parasites obtained when passing aquaculture sites during seaward travel or gonad development while being voluntarily anorexic during upriver travel to spawning grounds.",2022,10.1093/conphys/coac037,10,1,NA,coac037,tail beat frequency; sustained aerobic swimming; starvation; migration; critical swimming speed; cost of transport
article,The thermal limits of cardiorespiratory performance in anadromous Arctic char (<i>Salvelinus alpinus</i>): a field-based investigation using a remote mobile laboratory,"Gilbert, Matthew J. H. and Harris, Les N. and Malley, Brendan K. and Schimnowski, Adrian and Moore, Jean-Sebastien and Farrell, Anthony P.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Despite immense concern over amplified warming in the Arctic, physiological research to address related conservation issues for valuable cold-adapted fish, such as the Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), is lacking. This crucial knowledge gap is largely attributable to the practical and logistical challenges of conducting sensitive physiological investigations in remote field settings. Here, we used an innovative, mobile aquatic-research laboratory to assess the effects of temperature on aerobic metabolism and maximum heart rate (f(Hmax)) of upriver migrating Arctic char in the Kitikmeot region of Nunavut in the central Canadian Arctic. Absolute aerobic scope was unchanged at temperatures from 4 to 16 degrees C, while f(Hmax) increased with temperature (Q(10) = 2.1), as expected. However, f(Hmax) fell precipitously below 4 degrees C and it began to plateau above similar to 16 degrees C, reaching a maximum at similar to 19 degrees C before declining and becoming arrhythmic at similar to 21 degrees C. Furthermore, recovery from exhaustive exercise appeared to be critically impaired above 16 degrees C. The broad thermal range (similar to 4-16 degrees C) for increasing f(Hmax) and maintaining absolute aerobic scope matches river temperatures commonly encountered by migrating Arctic char in this region. Nevertheless, river temperatures can exceed 20 degrees C during warm events and our results confirm that such temperatures would limit exercise performance and thus impair migration in this species. Thus, unless Arctic char can rapidly acclimatize or alter its migration timing or location, which are both open questions, these impairments would likely impact population persistence and reduce lifetime fitness. As such, future conservation efforts should work towards quantifying and accounting for the impacts of warming, variable river temperatures on migration and reproductive success.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa036,8,NA,NA,coaa036,Arctic char; Arctic fisheries; cardiorespiratory; climate change; fish physiology; thermal tolerance
article,"At the edge of the thermal window: effects of elevated temperature on the resting metabolism, hypoxia tolerance and upper critical thermal limit of a widespread African cichlid","McDonnell, Laura H. and Chapman, Lauren J.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Tropical inland fishes are predicted to be especially vulnerable to thermal stress because they experience small temperature fluctuations that may select for narrow thermal windows. In this study, we measured resting metabolic rate (RMR), critical oxygen tension (P-crit) and critical thermal maximum (CTMax) of the widespread African cichlid (Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor victoriae) in response to short-term acclimation to temperatures within and above their natural thermal range. Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor collected in Lake Kayanja, Uganda, a population living near the upper thermal range of the species, were acclimated to 23, 26, 29 and 32 degrees C for 3 days directly after capture, and RMR and P-crit were then quantified. In a second group of P. multicolor from the same population, CTMax and the thermal onset of agitation were determined for fish acclimated to 26, 29 and 32 degrees C for 7 days. Both RMR and P-crit were significantly higher in fish acclimated to 32 degrees C, indicating decreased tolerance to hypoxia and increased metabolic requirements at temperatures only slightly (similar to 1 degrees C) above their natural thermal range. The CTMax increased with acclimation temperature, indicating some degree of thermal compensation induced by short-term exposure to higher temperatures. However, agitation temperature (likely to represent an avoidance response to increased temperature during CTMax trials) showed no increase with acclimation temperature. Overall, the results of this study demonstrate that P. multicolor is able to maintain its RMR and P-crit across the range of temperatures characteristic of its natural habitat, but incurs a higher cost of resting metabolism and reduced hypoxia tolerance at temperatures slightly above its present range.",2015,10.1093/conphys/cov050,3,NA,NA,cov050,Critical oxygen tension; fish physiology; respirometry; thermal stress; thermal tolerance; tropical fish

In cold-climate areas of Australia, invasive cane toads (Rhinella marina) can rapidly acclimate to cool conditions. To investigate whether this physiological plasticity is found in all invasive cane toads or is only seen in cool climates, we measured the acclimation ability of toads from across Australia and the island of Hawai'i. We collected toads from the field and placed them at either 12 or 24 degrees C for 12 h before measuring their righting response as a proxy for critical thermal minimum (CTmin). Toads from the coolest Australian region (New South Wales) demonstrated plasticity (as previously reported), with exposure to 12 degrees C (vs. 24 degrees C) decreasing CTmin by 2 degrees C. In toads from other Australian populations, CTmins were unaffected by our thermal treatments. Hawai'ian toads from a cool, wet site also rapidly acclimated to cool conditions, whereas those from warmer and drier Hawai'ian sites did not. Thermal plasticity has diverged among populations of invasive cane toads, with rapid acclimation manifested only in two cool-climate populations from widely separated sites. Predictions about the potential range of invasive species thus must consider the possibility of geographic (intraspecific) heterogeneity in thermal plasticity; data from other parts of the species' range may fail to predict levels of plasticity elicited by thermal challenges.",2018,10.1093/conphys/cox072,6,NA,NA,cox072,Acclimation; alien species; Bufo marinus; rapid evolution; thermal biology

The critical thermal maximum (CTmax), or the highest temperature a species can tolerate, is a physiological metric that is used to establish upper thermal limits. Among marine organisms, this metric is commonly assessed in bony fishes but less so in other taxonomic groups, such as elasmobranchs (subclass of sharks, rays and skates), where only thermal acclimation effects on CTmax have been assessed. Herein, we tested whether three life history stages, sex and body size affected CTmax in a tropical elasmobranch, the epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum), collected from the reef flats surrounding Heron Island, Australia. Overall, we found no difference in CTmax between life history stages, sexes or across a range of body sizes. Findings from this research suggest that the energetically costly processes (i.e. growth, maturation and reproduction) associated with the life history stages occupying these tropical reef flats do not change overall acute thermal tolerance. However, it is important to note that neither embryos developing in ovo, neonates, nor females actively encapsulating egg cases were observed in or collected from the reef flats. Overall, our findings provide the first evidence in an elasmobranch that upper thermal tolerance is not impacted by life history stage or size. This information will help to improve our understanding of how anthropogenic climate change may (or may not) disproportionally affect particular life stages and, as such, where additional conservation and management actions may be required.",2022,10.1093/conphys/coac074,10,1,NA,coac074,thermal tolerance; ocean warming; epaulette shark; critical thermal maximum; Chondrichthyes

However, few studies exist that have quantified the level of inter-population local adaptation in marine species freeze tolerance, especially in the Arctic. We investigated the importance of cold adaptation and thermal window width towards high latitudes from the temperate to the Arctic region. We measured upper and lower lethal air temperatures (i.e. LT and LT50) in temperate and Arctic populations of blue mussels (Mytilus edulis), and analysed weather data and membrane fatty acid compositions, following emersion simulations. Both populations had similar upper LT (similar to 38 degrees C), but Arctic mussels survived 4 degrees C colder air temperatures than temperate mussels (-13 vs. -9 degrees C, respectively), corresponding to an 8\% increase in their thermal window. There were strong latitudinal relationships between thermal window width and local air temperatures, indicating Arctic mussels are highly adapted to the Arctic environment where the seasonal temperature span exceeds 60 degrees C. Local adaptation and local habitat heterogeneity thus allow leading-edge M. edulis to inhabit high Arctic intertidal zones.

article,Climate warming causes life-history evolution in a model for Atlantic cod (<i>Gadus morhua</i>),"Holt, Rebecca E. and Jorgensen, Christian",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Climate change influences the marine environment, with ocean warming being the foremost driving factor governing changes in the physiology and ecology of fish. At the individual level, increasing temperature influences bioenergetics and numerous physiological and life-history processes, which have consequences for the population level and beyond. We provide a state-dependent energy allocation model that predicts temperature-induced adaptations for life histories and behaviour for the North-East Arctic stock (NEA) of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in response to climate warming. The key constraint is temperature-dependent respiratory physiology, and the model includes a number of trade-offs that reflect key physiological and ecological processes. Dynamic programming is used to find an evolutionarily optimal strategy of foraging and energy allocation that maximizes expected lifetime reproductive output given constraints from physiology and ecology. The optimal strategy is then simulated in a population, where survival, foraging behaviour, growth, maturation and reproduction emerge. Using current forcing, the model reproduces patterns of growth, size-at-age, maturation, gonad production and natural mortality for NEA cod. The predicted climate responses are positive for this stock; under a 2 degrees C warming, the model predicted increased growth rates and a larger asymptotic size. Maturation age was unaffected, but gonad weight was predicted to more than double. Predictions for a wider range of temperatures, from 2 to 7 degrees C, show that temperature responses were gradual; fish were predicted to grow faster and increase reproductive investment at higher temperatures. An emergent pattern of higher risk acceptance and increased foraging behaviour was also predicted. Our results provide important insight into the effects of climate warming on NEA cod by revealing the underlying mechanisms and drivers of change. We show how temperature-induced adaptations of behaviour and several life-history traits are not only mediated by physiology but also by trade-offs with survival, which has consequences for conservation physiology.",2014,10.1093/conphys/cou050,2,1,NA,cou050,Adaptation; behaviour; bioenergetics; climate; respiratory physiology

We assessed survival, growth, aerobic performance and critical thermal maxima (CTmax) following acute and 21 d exposures to temperatures up to 4 degrees C higher than current maxima for six species of freshwater fishes indigenous to tropical countries and of importance for human consumption. All six species showed 1.3-1.7 degrees C increases in CTmax with a 4 degrees C rise in acclimation temperature, values which match up well with fishes from other climatic regions, and five species had survival >87\% at all temperatures over the treatment period. Specific growth rates varied among and within each species in response to temperature treatments. For all species, the response of resting metabolic rate (RMR) was consistently more dynamic than for maximum metabolic rate, but in general both acute temperature exposure and thermal acclimation had only modest effects on aerobic scope (AS). However, RMR increased after warm acclimation in 5 of 6 species, suggesting incomplete metabolic compensation. Taken in total, our results show that each species had some ability to perform at temperatures up to 4 degrees C above current maxima, yet also displayed certain areas of concern for their long-term welfare. We therefore suggest caution against the overly broad generalization that all tropical freshwater fish species will face severe challenges from warming temperatures in the coming decades and that future vulnerability assessments should integrate multiple performance metrics as opposed to relying on a single response metric. Given the societal significance of inland fisheries in many parts of the tropics, our results clearly demonstrate the need for more species-specific studies of adaptive capacity to climate change-related challenges.",2018,10.1093/conphys/coy056,6,NA,NA,coy056,Aerobic scope; climate change; critical thermal maximum; food security; tropical inland fisheries
article,Heat exposure limits pentose phosphate pathway activity in bumblebees,"Rossi, Giulia S. and Elbassiouny, Alaa and Jamison, Jerrica and Welch Jr, Kenneth C.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Bumblebee declines threaten pollination services worldwide. We explored the physiological mechanisms that may explain why bumblebees are susceptible to heat stress. We discovered that elevated temperatures limit the activity of the pentose phosphate pathway-a parallel pathway to glycolysis that generates antioxidant potential crucial for mitigating oxidative stress. Bumblebee populations across the globe are experiencing substantial declines due to climate change, with major consequences for pollination services in both natural and agricultural settings. Using an economically important species, Bombus impatiens, we explored the physiological mechanisms that may cause susceptibility to extreme heat events. We tested the hypothesis that heat exposure limits the activity of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)-a parallel pathway to glycolysis that can use nectar sugar to generate antioxidant potential and combat oxidative stress. Using isotopically labelled glucose, we tracked PPP activity in B. impatiens at rest, during exercise and during a post-exercise recovery period under two different temperature regimes (22 degrees C and 32 degrees C). We found that the PPP is routinely used by B. impatiens at moderate temperatures, but that its activity is markedly reduced when ATP demands are high, such as during periods of exercise and heat exposure. We also exposed B. impatiens to either 22 degrees C or 32 degrees C for 5 hours and assessed levels of oxidative damage (lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyls) and antioxidant potential [}reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione concentrations]. Interestingly, bees exhibited little oxidative damage after the thermal exposure, but we found a lower GSH:GSSG ratio in 32 degrees C-exposed bees, reflecting lower antioxidant potential. Overall, our study demonstrates that acute heat stress severely limits PPP activity and may constrain antioxidant potential in B. impatiens. The repeated attenuation of this pathway in a warming climate may have more severe physiological consequences for this species, with potential implications for pollination services across North America.",2024,10.1093/conphys/coae031,12,1,NA,coae031,Climate change; glucose; metabolic pathways; oxidative stress; pollinators; thermal stress
article,Changes to benthic community structure may impact organic matter consumption on Pacific Arctic shelves,"Jones, Brittany R. and Kelley, Amanda L. and Mincks, Sarah L.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Changes in species composition and biomass of Arctic benthic communities are predicted to occur in response to environmental changes associated with oceanic warming and sea-ice loss. Such changes will likely impact ecosystem function, including flows of energy and organic material through the Arctic marine food web. Oxygen consumption rates can be used to quantify differences in metabolic demand among species and estimate the effects of shifting community structure on benthic carbon consumption. Closed-system respirometry using non-invasive oxygen optodes was conducted onboard the R/V Sikuliaq in June 2017 and 2018 on six dominant species of benthic macrofauna from the northern Bering and southern Chukchi Sea shelves, including five bivalve species (Macoma sp., Serripes groenlandicus, Astarte sp., Hiatella arctica and Nuculana pernula) and one amphipod species (Ampelisca macrocephala). Results revealed species-specific respiration rates with high metabolic demand for S. groenlandicus and A. macrocephala compared to that of the other species. For a hypothetical 0.1-g ash-free dry mass individual, the standard metabolic rate of S. groenlandicus would be 4.3 times higher than that of Astarte sp. Overall, carbon demand ranged from 8 to 475 mu g C individual( -1) day(-1) for the species and sizes of individuals measured. The allometric scaling of respiration rate with biomass also varied among species. The scaling coefficient was similar for H. arctica, A. macrocephala and Astarte sp., while it was high for S. groenlandicus and low for Macoma sp. These results suggest that observed shifts in spatial distribution of the dominant macrofaunal taxa across this region will impact carbon demand of the benthic community. Hence, ecosystem models seeking to incorporate benthic system functionality may need to differentiate between communities that exhibit different oxygen demands.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab007,9,NA,NA,coab007,Bivalves; macrofauna; metabolism; oxygen consumption; Pacific Arctic; respiration
article,"Physiology can contribute to better understanding, management, and conservation of coral reef fishes","Illing, Bjoern and Rummer, Jodie L.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Coral reef fishes, like many other marine organisms, are affected by anthropogenic stressors such as fishing and pollution and, owing to climate change, are experiencing increasing water temperatures and ocean acidification. Against the backdrop of these various stressors, a mechanistic understanding of processes governing individual organismal performance is the first step for identifying drivers of coral reef fish population dynamics. In fact, physiological measurements can help to reveal potential cause-and-effect relationships and enable physiologists to advise conservation management by upscaling results from cellular and individual organismal levels to population levels. Here, we highlight studies that include physiological measurements of coral reef fishes and those that give advice for their conservation. A literature search using combined physiological, conservation and coral reef fish key words resulted in similar to 1900 studies, of which only 99 matched predefined requirements. We observed that, over the last 20 years, the combination of physiological and conservation aspects in studies on coral reef fishes has received increased attention. Most of the selected studies made their physiological observations at the whole organism level and used their findings to give conservation advice on population dynamics, habitat use or the potential effects of climate change. The precision of the recommendations differed greatly and, not surprisingly, was least concrete when studies examined the effects of projected climate change scenarios. Although more and more physiological studies on coral reef fishes include conservation aspects, there is still a lack of concrete advice for conservation managers, with only very few published examples of physiological findings leading to improved management practices. We conclude with a call to action to foster better knowledge exchange between natural scientists and conservation managers to translate physiological findings more effectively in order to obtain evidence-based and adaptive management strategies for the conservation of coral reef fishes.",2017,10.1093/conphys/cox005,5,NA,NA,cox005,Adaptive management; conservation; coral reef; elasmobranch; teleost; tolerance
article,Temperature alters the physiological response of spiny lobsters under predation risk,"Briceno, Felipe A. and Fitzgibbon, Quinn P. and Polymeropoulos, Elias T. and Hinojosa, Ivan A. and Pecl, Gretta T.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Predation risk can strongly shape prey ecological traits, with specific anti-predator responses displayed to reduce encounters with predators. Key environmental drivers, such as temperature, can profoundly modulate prey energetic costs in ectotherms, although we currently lack knowledge of how both temperature and predation risk can challenge prey physiology and ecology. Such uncertainties in predator-prey interactions are particularly relevant for marine regions experiencing rapid environmental changes due to climate change. Using the octopus (Octopus maorum)-spiny lobster (Jasus edwardsii) interaction as a predator-prey model, we examined different metabolic traits of sub adult spiny lobsters under predation risk in combination with two thermal scenarios: `current' (20 degrees C) and `warming' (23 degrees C), based on projections of sea-surface temperature under climate change. We examined lobster standard metabolic rates to define the energetic requirements at specific temperatures. Routine metabolic rates (RMRs) within a respirometer were used as a proxy of lobster activity during night and day time, and active metabolic rates, aerobic scope and excess post-exercise oxygen consumption were used to assess the energetic costs associated with escape responses (i.e. tail-flipping) in both thermal scenarios. Lobster standard metabolic rate increased at 23 degrees C, suggesting an elevated energetic requirement (39\%) compared to 20 degrees C. Unthreatened lobsters displayed a strong circadian pattern in RMR with higher rates during the night compared with the day, which were strongly magnified at 23 degrees C. Once exposed to predation risk, lobsters at 20 degrees C quickly reduced their RMR by similar to 29\%, suggesting an immobility or `freezing' response to avoid predators. Conversely, lobsters acclimated to 23 degrees C did not display such an anti-predator response. These findings suggest that warmer temperatures may induce a change to the typical immobility predation risk response of lobsters. It is hypothesized that heightened energetic maintenance requirements at higher temperatures may act to override the normal predator-risk responses under climate-change scenarios.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa065,8,NA,NA,coaa065,Climate change; Jasus edwardsii; predator-prey interaction; respiratory physiology
article,A practical field extraction method for non-invasive monitoring of hormone activity in the black rhinoceros,"Edwards, Katie L. and McArthur, Hannah M. and Liddicoat, Tim and Walker, Susan L.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Non-invasive hormone analysis is a vital tool in assessing an animal's adrenal and reproductive status, which can be beneficial to in situ and ex situ conservation. However, it can be difficult to employ these techniques when monitoring in situ populations away from controlled laboratory conditions, when electricity is not readily available. A practical method for processing faecal samples in the field, which enables samples to be extracted soon after defaecation and stored in field conditions for prolonged periods prior to hormone analysis, is therefore warranted. This study describes the development of an optimal field extraction method, which includes hand-shaking faecal material in 90\% methanol, before loading this extract in a 40\% solvent onto HyperSep (TM) C8 solid-phase extraction cartridges, stored at ambient temperatures. This method was successfully validated for measurement of adrenal and reproductive hormone metabolites in faeces of male and female black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) and was rigorously tested in controlled laboratory and simulated field conditions. All the hormones tested demonstrated between 83 and 94\% and between 42 and 89\% recovery of synthetic and endogenous hormone metabolites, respectively, with high precision of replication. Furthermore, results obtained following the developed optimal field extraction method were highly correlated with the control laboratory method. Cartridges can be stored at ambient (cool, dry or warm, humid) conditions for periods of up to 6 months without degradation, before re-extraction of hormone metabolites for analysis by enzyme immunoassay. The described method has great potential to be applied to monitor faecal reproductive and adrenal hormone metabolites in a wide variety of species and allows samples to be stored in the field for up to 6 months prior to analysis. This provides the opportunity to investigate hormone relationships within in situ populations, where equipment and facilities may previously have been limiting.",2014,10.1093/conphys/cot037,2,1,NA,cot037,Corticosterone; faeces; in situ; progesterone; solid-phase extraction; testosterone
article,Does greater thermal plasticity facilitate range expansion of an invasive terrestrial anuran into higher latitudes?,"Winwood-Smith, Hugh S. and Alton, Lesley A. and Franklin, Craig E. and White, Craig R.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Temperature has pervasive effects on physiological processes and is critical in setting species distribution limits. Since invading Australia, cane toads have spread rapidly across low latitudes, but slowly into higher latitudes. Low temperature is the likely factor limiting high-latitude advancement. Several previous attempts have been made to predict future cane toad distributions in Australia, but understanding the potential contribution of phenotypic plasticity and adaptation to future range expansion remains challenging. Previous research demonstrates the considerable thermal metabolic plasticity of the cane toad, but suggests limited thermal plasticity of locomotor performance. Additionally, the oxygen-limited thermal tolerance hypothesis predicts that reduced aerobic scope sets thermal limits for ectotherm performance. Metabolic plasticity, locomotor performance and aerobic scope are therefore predicted targets of natural selection as cane toads invade colder regions. We measured these traits at temperatures of 10, 15, 22.5 and 30 degrees C in low- and high-latitude toads acclimated to 15 and 30 degrees C, to test the hypothesis that cane toads have adapted to cooler temperatures. High-latitude toads show increased metabolic plasticity and higher resting metabolic rates at lower temperatures. Burst locomotor performance was worse for high-latitude toads.

Levels of triacylglycerol (TAG) were measured in liver and oxidative and glycolytic skeletal muscles, and glycogen in liver and glycolytic muscle to assess changes in energy stores. Metabolic pathways displayed minimal thermal plasticity, yet antioxidant defences were lower in heart and oxidative skeletal muscles of warm-acclimated animals compared with animals held at ambient temperature. Despite higher metabolic rates at elevated temperature, energy storage depots of TAG and glycogen increase in liver and remain unchanged in muscle with warm acclimation.

Although many studies have focussed on survival and mortality in response to specific physiological stresses, little attention has been paid to the role of genetic heritability of traits and local adaptation in influencing patterns of plant mortality, especially in non-native species. Tamarix spp. is a dominant, non-native riparian tree in western North America that is experiencing dieback in some areas of its range due to episodic herbivory by the recently introduced northern tamarisk leaf beetle (Diorhabda carinulata). We propose that genotype x environment interactions largely underpin current and future patterns of Tamarix mortality. We anticipate that (i) despite its recent introduction, and the potential for significant gene flow, Tamarix in western North America is generally adapted to local environmental conditions across its current range in part due to hybridization of two species; (ii) local adaptation to specific climate, soil and resource availability will yield predictable responses to episodic herbivory; and (iii) the ability to cope with a combination of episodic herbivory and increased aridity associated with climate change will be largely based on functional tradeoffs in resource allocation. This review focusses on the potential heritability of plant carbon allocation patterns in Tamarix, focussing on the relative contribution of acquired carbon to non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) pools versus other sinks as the basis for surviving episodic disturbance. Where high aridity and/or poor edaphic position lead to chronic stress, NSC pools may fall below a minimum threshold because of an imbalance between the supply of carbon and its demand by various sinks.

Recent research has revealed interpopulation variation among several species of Pacific salmonids; however, the environmental drivers of population differences remain elusive. We tested for local adaptation and countergradient variation by assessing interpopulation variation among six populations of fall-run Chinook Salmon from the western United States. Juvenile fish were reared at three temperatures (11, 16 and 20 \& DEG;C), and five physiological metrics were measured (routine and maximum metabolic rate, aerobic scope, growth rate and critical thermal maximum). We then tested associations between these physiological metrics and 15 environmental characteristics (e.g. rearing temperature, latitude, migration distance, etc.). Statistical associations between the five physiological metrics and 15 environmental characteristics supported our hypotheses of local adaptation. Notably, latitude was a poor predictor of population physiology. Instead, our results demonstrate that populations from warmer habitats exhibit higher thermal tolerance (i.e. critical thermal maxima), faster growth when warm acclimated and greater aerobic capacity at high temperatures. Additionally, populations with longer migrations exhibit higher metabolic capacity. However, overall metabolic capacity declined with warm acclimation, indicating that future climate change may reduce metabolic capacity, negatively affecting long-migrating populations. Linking physiological traits to environmental characteristics enables flexible, population-specific management of disparate populations in response to local conditions. Chinook Salmon exist as multiple distinct populations across the landscape and exhibit population-specific physiological traits (upper thermal tolerance, metabolic capacity and growth rate) consistent with a hypothesis of local adaptation to environmental conditions.

article,Winter temperatures decrease swimming performance and limit distributions of tropical damselfishes,"Johansen, Jacob L. and Steffensen, John F. and Jones, Geoffrey P.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Coral reefs within 10 degrees of the equator generally experience <= 3 degrees C seasonal variation in water temperature. Ectotherms that have evolved in these conditions are therefore expected to exhibit narrow thermal optima and be very sensitive to the greater thermal variability (>6 degrees C) experienced at higher latitudes (>= 10 degrees N/S). The impact of increased thermal variability on the fitness and distribution of thermally sensitive reef ectotherms is currently unknown. Here, we examine site-attached planktivorous coral reef damselfishes that rely on their physiological capacity to swim and forage in the water column year round. We focus on 10 species spanning four evolutionarily distinct genera from a region of the Great Barrier Reef that experiences >= 6 degrees C difference between seasons. Four ecologically important indicators showed reduced performance during the winter low (23 degrees C) compared with the summer peak (29 degrees C), with effect sizes varying among species and genera, as follows: (i) the energy available for activity (aerobic scope) was reduced by 35-45\% in five species and three genera; (ii) the energetically most efficient swimming speed was reduced by 17\% across all species; and (iii) the maximal critical swimming speed and (iv) the gait transition speed (the swimming mode predominantly used for foraging) were reduced by 16-42\% in six species spanning all four genera. Comparisons with field surveys within and across latitudes showed that species-specific distributions were strongly correlated with these performance indicators. Species occupy habitats where they can swim faster than prevailing habitat currents year round, and >95\% of individuals were observed only in habitats where the gait transition speed can be maintained at or above habitat currents. Thermal fluctuation at higher latitudes appears to reduce performance as well as the possible distribution of species and genera within and among coral reef habitats.

Effects of atmospheric warming are already visible in most major ecosystems and are evident across all levels of biological organization. Linking functional responses of individuals to temperature is critical for predicting responses of populations and communities to global climate change. The southern redbelly dace Chrosomus erythrogaster and the central stoneroller Campostoma anomalum are two minnows (Cyprinidae) that commonly occur in the Flint Hills region of the USA but show different patterns of occurrence, with dace largely occupying headwater reaches and stonerollers persisting in both headwater and intermediate-sized streams. We tested for differences between species in critical thermal maximum, energy metabolism, sustained swimming and activity over an ecologically relevant temperature gradient of acclimation temperatures. Typically, metrics increased with acclimation temperature for both species, although stoneroller activity decreased with temperature. We observed a significant interaction between species and temperature for critical thermal maxima, where stonerollers only had higher critical thermal maxima at the coldest temperature and at warm temperatures compared to the dace. We did not find evidence suggesting differences in the energy metabolism of dace and stonerollers. We detected interspecific differences in sustained swimming performance, with dace having higher swimming speed than stonerollers regardless of acclimation temperature. Finally, there was a significant interaction between temperature and species for activity; dace activity was higher at intermediate and warm temperatures compared to stonerollers. We observed subtle interspecific differences in how performance metrics responded to temperature that did not always align with observed patterns of distribution for these species.

Bumblebees might mitigate the effects of such extreme weather through colonial behaviours. In particular, fanning behaviour to dissipate heat is an important mechanism that could reduce exposure of thermally sensitive offspring to detrimental nest temperatures (Tn). The allocation of workers towards fanning over prolonged periods could impact foraging activity that is essential for colony-sustaining resource gathering. Colony maintenance and growth could suffer as a result of nutritional and high ambient temperature (Ta) thermal stress. It remains uncertain whether a compromise occurs between thermoregulation and foraging under chronic, sublethal heat events and how colony success is impacted as a result. This study held colonies of Bombus impatiens at constant high Ta (25 degrees C, 30 degrees C or 35 degrees C) for 2 weeks while quantifying the percentage of foragers, fanning incidence, nest temperature (Tn) and other metrics of colony success such as the percentage of adult emergence and offspring production. We found that foraging and adult emergence were not significantly affected by Ta, but that thermoregulation was unsuccessful at maintaining Tn despite increased fanning at 35 degrees C. Furthermore, 35 degrees C resulted in workers abandoning the colony and fewer offspring being produced.

Here, the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus was used as a model system to study how local adaptation influences the cold tolerance of a broadly distributed marine crustacean. Among five populations spanning 18 degrees in latitude, the following three metrics were used to compare cold tolerance: the temperature of chill-coma onset, the chill-coma recovery time and post-freezing recovery. In comparison to copepods from warmer southern latitudes, animals from northern populations exhibited lower chill-coma onset temperatures, shorter chill-coma recovery times and faster post-freezing recovery rates. Importantly, all three metrics showed a consistent latitudinal trend, suggesting that any single metric could be used equivalently in future studies investigating latitudinal variation in cold tolerance. Our results agree with previous studies showing that populations within a single species can display strong local adaptation to spatially varying climatic conditions.

Levent and Cech, Jr., Joseph J. and Fangue, Nann A.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Diversion (i.e. extraction) of water from rivers and estuaries can potentially affect native wildlife populations if operation is not carefully managed. For example, open, unmodified water diversions can act as a source of injury or mortality to resident or migratory fishes from entrainment and impingement, and can cause habitat degradation and fragmentation. Fish-protection devices, such as exclusion screens, louvres or sensory deterrents, can physically or behaviourally deter fish from approaching or being entrained into water diversions. However, empirical assessment of their efficacy is often lacking or is investigated only for particular economically or culturally important fishes, such as salmonids. The Southern population of anadromous green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris) is listed as threatened in California, and there is a high density of water diversions located within their native range (the Sacramento-San Joaquin watershed). Coupled with their unique physiology and behaviour compared with many other fishes native to California, the green sturgeon is susceptible to entrainment into diversions and is an ideal species with which to study the efficacy of mitigation techniques. Therefore, we investigated juvenile green sturgeon (188-202 days post-hatch) in the presence of several fish-protection devices to assess behaviour and entrainment risk. Using a large experimental flume (similar to 500 kl), we found that compared with an open diversion pipe (control), the addition of a trash-rack box, louvre box, or perforated cylinder on the pipe inlet all significantly reduced the proportion of fish that were entrained through the pipe (P = 0.03, P = 0.028, and P = 0.028, respectively). Likewise, these devices decreased entrainment risk during a single movement past the pipe by between 60 and 96\%.

We further considered the potential influences of water temperature, sex and fish size on host infectious agents and transcription profiles. There were eight infectious agents detected in steelhead gill tissue, with high prevalence of the bacteria Candidatus Branchiomonas cysticola (80\%) and Flavobacterium psychrophilum (95\%) and the microparasite Sphaerothecum destruens (53\%).

We test the thermal limits of toads from northern and southern Florida and find that northern toads are more tolerant of cold and have rapidly adapted to this novel environment. Abstract Understanding rapid adaptation to novel environments is essential as we face increasing climatic change. Invasive species are an ideal system for studying adaptation as they are typically introduced to novel environments where they must adapt if they are to persist. We used the invasive cane toad, Rhinella marina, to investigate the contribution of plasticity and evolution to rapid adaptation in a novel environment. Rhinella marina is a neotropical toad that has invaded areas with climates outside of its native environmental niche. The goal of this research was to understand how cane toads persist in northern Florida, the coldest region of their combined natural and invasive range, and originally thought to be beyond their thermal breadth. We measured Critical thermal minima in cane toads from the original, warm introduction location (Miami), and their northern range edge (Tampa) to determine whether northern toads were more cold-tolerant, and to examine the contribution of adaptive plasticity and evolution to any changes in tolerance. Our results show that following acclimation to cold temperatures, southern toads are less tolerant of cold than northern toads. This persistent population difference implies selection for cold-tolerance in northern populations. Differences in individual responses indicate that plasticity is also involved in this response. Our findings have implications for conservation because predatory cane toad invasions threaten local faunas, especially native amphibians.

article,Elevational clines in the temperature dependence of insect performance and implications for ecological responses to climate change,"Buckley, Lauren B. and Nufio, Cesar R.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"To what extent is insect hopping and feeding performance, which constrains the ability to obtain and assimilate resources, thermally adapted along an elevation gradient? Does temperature dependence vary between populations and species and can differences account for individualistic responses to past climate change? We investigate these questions for three species of grasshoppers along a Rocky Mountain elevation gradient. All species and populations exhibit warm adaptation for consumption and digestion, with only modest inter-and intra-specific differences. Species differ substantially in the temperature of peak hopping performance. Low-elevation populations of the warm-adapted species exhibit the highest performance at high temperatures and the lowest performance at low temperatures. Developmental plasticity influences the temperature dependence of performance; grasshoppers reared at higher temperatures perform better at higher temperatures and possess broader thermal tolerance. We fitted thermal performance curves to examine whether performance shifts can account for changes in abundance between initial surveys in 1958-1960 and recent surveys since 2006. All species and populations are able to achieve greater feeding rates now. Estimated shifts in hopping performance vary between species and along the elevation gradient. The cool-adapted species has experienced declines in hopping performance, particularly at the lower elevation sites, while the warm-adapted species has experienced increases in performance concentrated at higher elevations. These estimated performance shifts broadly concur with observed abundance shifts.

article,Development and application of an antibody-based protein microarray to assess physiological stress in grizzly bears (<i>Ursus arctos</i>),"Carlson, Ruth I. and Cattet, Marc R. L. and Sarauer, Bryan L. and Nielsen, Scott E. and Boulanger, John and Stenhouse, Gordon B. and Janz, David M.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"A novel antibody-based protein microarray was developed that simultaneously determines expression of 31 stress-associated proteins in skin samples collected from free-ranging grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) in Alberta, Canada. The microarray determines proteins belonging to four broad functional categories associated with stress physiology: hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis proteins, apoptosis/cell cycle proteins, cellular stress/proteotoxicity proteins and oxidative stress/inflammation proteins. Small skin samples (50-100 mg) were collected from captured bears using biopsy punches. Proteins were isolated and labelled with fluorescent dyes, with labelled protein homogenates loaded onto microarrays to hybridize with antibodies. Relative protein expression was determined by comparison with a pooled standard skin sample. The assay was sensitive, requiring 80 mu g of protein per sample to be run in triplicate on the microarray. Intra-array and inter-array coefficients of variation for individual proteins were generally <10 and <15\%, respectively. With one exception, there were no significant differences in protein expression among skin samples collected from the neck, forelimb, hindlimb and ear in a subsample of n = 4 bears. This suggests that remotely delivered biopsy darts could be used in future sampling. Using generalized linear mixed models, certain proteins within each functional category demonstrated altered expression with respect to differences in year, season, geographical sampling location within Alberta and bear biological parameters, suggesting that these general variables may influence expression of specific proteins in the microarray. Our goal is to apply the protein microarray as a conservation physiology tool that can detect, evaluate and monitor physiological stress in grizzly bears and other species at risk over time in response to environmental change.",2016,10.1093/conphys/cow001,4,NA,NA,cow001,Grizzly bear; proteomics; skin biopsy; stress
article,Interactive effects of temperature and bisphenol A on phytoplankton growth and community structure,"Theus, Meredith E. and Michaels, Julia and Fey, Samuel B.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Environmental contamination of bisphenol A (BPA) is a widespread and multifaceted issue with vast ecological, social and economic consequences. Thus, understanding how local environmental conditions, such as temperature, interact with BPA to affect populations and community dynamics remain important areas of research. Here, we conduct laboratory experiments aimed at understanding how environmental gradients of both temperature and BPA concentration influence freshwater phytoplankton population growth and community structure. We exposed phytoplankton assemblages comprised of three common species of green algae (Chlorella vulgaris, Ankistrodesmus braunii and Scenedesmus quadricauda) as well as isolates of each individual species to three BPA concentrations (0, 2, 13 mg/L BPA) and three temperatures (18, 23, 27 degrees C) monitoring population growth and community structure (via biovolume). We observed antagonistic interactions between BPA and warmer temperatures, such that when warmer temperatures decreased growth (observed with A. braunii), high concentrations of BPA elevated growth at these warm temperatures; however, when warmer temperatures increased growth (C. vulgaris, S. quadricauda), high BPA concentrations diminished these gains. Although BPA exposure inhibited the growth of most C. vulgaris populations, growth was not reduced in A. braunii or S. quadricauda populations exposed to 2 mg/L BPA. Phytoplankton assemblage evenness (Pielou evenness index) decreased as BPA concentration increased and was consistently lowest under 27 degrees C. Community composition was similar in assemblages cultured under 0 and 2 mg/L BPA under 18 and 23 degrees C but was most similar between assemblages cultured under 2 and 13 mg/L BPA under 27 degrees C. These results indicate that local environmental temperatures can mediate the consequences of BPA for freshwater phytoplankton growth rates and community structure and that BPA can diminish potential gains of increased growth rate for warm-adapted phytoplankton species at high environmental temperatures. We investigate how environmental temperature and bisphenol A (BPA, a widespread environmental contaminant) jointly alter algal populations and communities. We report that higher environmental temperature can exacerbate or ameliorate the negative impacts of BPA on growth rates and may increase the sensitivity of algal community composition to BPA.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad021,11,1,NA,coad021,Phytoplankton; Environmental contamination; Climate warming

A portable blood analyser (iSTAT) was used to obtain near-immediate field results for total CO2, lactate, sodium, potassium, ionized calcium, glucose and haemoglobin. Standard laboratory haematology techniques were employed for differential white blood cell counts and haematocrit determination. Body temperature, heart rate and body measurements were also recorded. We found significant differences in haematocrit values between males and females. The values reported in this study provide baseline data that may be useful in detecting changes in health status among lava lizards affected by natural disturbances or anthropogenic threats.

article,Comparing life history traits and tolerance to changing environments of two oyster species (Ostrea edulis and Crassostrea gigas) through Dynamic Energy Budget theory,"Stechele, Brecht and Maar, Marie and Wijsman, Jeroen and Van der Zande, Dimitry and Degraer, Steven and Bossier, Peter and Nevejan, Nancy",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"To predict the response of the European flat oyster (Ostrea edulis) and Pacific cupped oyster (Crassostrea gigas/Magallana gigas) populations to environmental changes, it is key to understand their life history traits. The Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory is a mechanistic framework that enables the quantification of the bioenergetics of development, growth and reproduction from fertilization to death across different life stages. This study estimates the DEB parameters for the European flat oyster, based on a comprehensive dataset, while DEB parameters for the Pacific cupped oyster were extracted from the literature. The DEB parameters for both species were validated using growth rates from laboratory experiments at several constant temperatures and food levels as well as with collected aquaculture data from the Limfjorden, Denmark, and the German Bight. DEB parameters and the Arrhenius temperature parameters were compared to get insight in the life history traits of both species. It is expected that increasing water temperatures due to climate change will be beneficial for both species. Lower assimilation rates and high energy allocation to soma explain O. edulis' slow growth and low reproductive output. Crassostrea gigas' high assimilation rate, low investment in soma and extremely low reserve mobility explains the species' fast growth, high tolerance to starvation and high reproductive output. Hence, the reproductive strategies of both species are considerably different. Flat oysters are especially susceptible to unfavourable environmental conditions during the brooding period, while Pacific oysters' large investment in reproduction make it well adapted to highly diverse environments. Based on the life history traits, aquaculture and restoration of O. edulis should be executed in environments with suitable and stable conditions. European flat oysters (Ostrea edulis) and Pacific cupped oyster (Crassostrea gigas) have distinct differences in Dynamic Energy Budget parameters. These parameters explain their history traits and life strategies when exposed to changing environments in Northern Europe.",2022,10.1093/conphys/coac034,10,1,NA,coac034,climate change; Dynamic Energy Budget; European flat oyster; life history traits; Pacific cupped oyster

W. and Holyoake, C. and Fleming, P. A. and Robertson, I. D. and Connolly, J. H. and Warren, K. S.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Health and conservation research on platypuses (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) may require anaesthesia to reduce stress and the risk of injury to both the animal and the researcher, as well as to facilitate examination and sample collection. Platypus anaesthesia can be difficult to manage, with reports of periods of apnoea and bradycardia described. This study investigated the conditions around sudden-onset apnoea and bradycardia in 163 field-anaesthetized platypuses as part of a health study. Anaesthesia was induced and maintained using isoflurane delivered in oxygen by face mask. Sudden-onset apnoea and bradycardia was observed in 19\% of platypuses, occurring either at induction of anaesthesia, during recovery, or both. At induction, occurrence was more often recorded for adults (P = 0.19) and was correlated with low body temperature (P < 0.001), season (P = 0.06; greater incidence in summer) and longer pre-anaesthetic holding time (P = 0.16). At recovery, sudden-onset apnoea and bradycardia occurred only in platypuses that had been placed in dorsal recumbency as part of their examination, and correlated with poor body condition (P = 0.002), time in dorsal recumbency (P = 0.005), adults (P = 0.06), number of field-workers (P = 0.06) and females (P = 0.11). The sudden-onset apnoea and bradycardia we observed is likely to result from the irritant nature of isoflurane (stimulating the trigeminal nerve via nasal chemoreceptors). We propose that this mechanism is analogous to that of submersion of the face/nasal cavity in cold water during a natural dive response, but that the term `nasopharyngeal response' would more appropriately describe the changes observed under isoflurane anaesthesia. Although we did not record any long-term adverse effects on platypuses that had undergone this response, the nasopharyngeal response could complicate the diagnosis of anaesthetic dose-dependent apnoea and bradycardia. Therefore, we suggest that these responses during anaesthesia of platypuses might be avoided by minimizing the stress around capture and handling, as well as reducing the time in dorsal recumbency.",2014,10.1093/conphys/cou053,2,1,NA,cou053,Apnoea; bradycardia; dive response; isoflurane; nasopharyngeal response; Ornithorhynchus anatinus; platypus

Despite the growing interest in recreational fishing for white sturgeon, little is known about the sublethal and lethal impacts of angling on released sturgeon. In summer (July 2014, mean water temperature 15.3 degrees C) and winter (February 2015, mean water temperature 6.6 degrees C), captive white sturgeon (n = 48) were exposed to a combination of exercise and air exposure as a method of simulating an angling event. After the stressor, sturgeon were assessed for a physiological stress response, and reflex impairments were quantified to determine overall fish vitality (i.e. capacity for survival). A physiological stress response occurred in all sturgeon exposed to a fishing-related stressor, with the magnitude of the response correlated with the duration of the stressor. Moreover, the stress from exercise was more pronounced in summer, leading to higher reflex impairment scores (mean +/- SEM, 0.44 +/- 0.07 and 0.25 +/- 0.05 in summer and winter, respectively). Reflex impairment was also correlated with lactate concentrations (e.g. physiological stress measures related to exhaustive exercise; r = 0.53) and recovery time (r = 0.76). Two mortalities occurred >24 h after the cessation of treatment in the summer. Given that natural habitats for white sturgeon can reach much higher temperatures than those presented in our study, we caution the use of this mortality estimate for a summer season, because latent mortality could be much higher when temperatures exceed 16 degrees C. This is the first experiment investigating the physiological disturbance and reflex impairment of capture and release at two temperatures on subadult/adult white sturgeon, and the results suggest that future research needs to examine the longer term and fitness consequences of extended play and air exposure times, because these are largely unknown for wild populations.",2016,10.1093/conphys/cow031,4,NA,NA,cow031,Catch-and-release angling; reflex impairment; stress physiology; temperature; white sturgeon
article,A novel bioaugmentation technique effectively increases the skin-associated microbial diversity of captive eastern hellbenders,"Kenison, Erin K. and Hernandez-Gomez, Obed and Williams, Rod N.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Captive environments are maintained in hygienic ways that lack free-flowing microbes found in animals' natural environments. As a result, captive animals often have depauperate host-associated microbial communities compared to conspecifics in the wild and may have increased disease susceptibility and reduced immune function. Eastern hellbenders (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis alleganiensis) have suffered precipitous population declines over the past few decades. To bolster populations, eastern hellbenders are reared in captivity before being translocated to the wild. However, the absence of natural microbial reservoirs within the captive environment diminishes the diversity of skin-associated bacteria on hellbender skin and may negatively influence their ability to defend against pathogenic species once they are released into the wild. To prepare hellbenders for natural bacteria found in riverine environments, we devised a novel bioaugmentation method to increase the diversity of skin microbial communities within a captive setting. We exposed juvenile hellbenders to increasing amounts of river water over 5 weeks before translocating them to the river. We genetically identified and phylogenetically compared bacteria collected from skin swabs and river water for alpha (community richness) and beta (community composition) diversity estimates. We found that hellbenders exposed to undiluted river water in captivity had higher alpha diversity and distinct differentiation in the community composition on their skin, compared to hellbenders only exposed to well water. We also found strong evidence that hellbender skin microbiota is host-specific rather than environmentally driven and is colonized by rare environmental operational taxonomic units in river water. This technique may increase hellbender translocation success as increasing microbial diversity is often correlated with elevated disease resistance. Future work is necessary to refine our methods, investigate the relationship between microbial diversity and hellbender health and understand how this bioaugmentation technique influences hellbenders' survival following translocation from captivity into the wild.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa040,8,NA,NA,coaa040,alpha diversity; amphibian; captivity; community composition; skin microbiota; translocation

C. and Kik, Chris",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Genebanks aim to optimize their storage conditions in order to postpone seed ageing as long as possible. As most genebanks have a relatively short life history, empirical data about seed longevity during ex situ storage are almost absent. Based on seed characteristics, theoretical predictions indicate that cereal seeds can be stored without substantial loss of viability for time periods exceeding 100 years, even under temperatures of a few degrees above zero. Here we present the results of a germination study in wheat and barley, comparing genebank seed samples maintained at different temperatures for 23-33 years. Wheat and barley seed samples stored at -20 degrees C showed a mean germination of 94\% and 90\%, respectively, indicating no loss of the initial viability determined for the accessions prior to introduction in the collection. Seed samples maintained at 4 degrees C showed a mean germination of 62\% for wheat and 75\% for barley. In addition to the observed loss of viability, the 4 degrees C samples also showed a loss in vigour as the time period to reach their final germination was about twice as long compared to the -20 degrees C samples. A subset of the wheat accessions tested in 2011 were retested in 2017, showing further reduction in mean germination to 35\% for the 4 degrees C samples, while the -20 degrees C samples remained stable at 95\%. Several 4 degrees C samples were even close to a complete loss of viability. Considering that wheat and barley are generally regarded as good maintainers, the rapid loss of seed viability observed in the present study indicates that the ex situ seed storage of genetic resources at 4 degrees C should be treated with caution by genebanks, particularly when used for long-term conservation.",2018,10.1093/conphys/coy033,6,NA,NA,coy033,Cereals; genebanks; germination; seed longevity; seed viability; storage temperature

While a multi-disciplinary toolbox can only help to address the global biodiversity crisis, any field can face challenges while becoming established, particularly highly applied disciplines that require multi-stakeholder involvement. Gaining first-hand knowledge of the challenges that conservation physiologists are facing can help characterize the current state of the field and build a better foundation for determining how it can grow. Through an online survey of 468 scientists working at the intersection of physiology and conservation, we aimed to identify characteristics of those engaging in conservation physiology research (e.g. demographics, primary taxa of study), gauge conservation physiology's role in contributing to on-the-ground conservation action, identify the perceived barriers to achieving success and determine how difficult any identified barriers are to overcome. Despite all participants having experience combining physiology and conservation, only one-third considered themselves to be `conservation physiologists'. Moreover, there was a general perception that conservation physiology does not yet regularly lead to tangible conservation success. Respondents identified the recent conceptualization of the field and the broader issue of adequately translating science into management action as the primary reasons for these deficits. Other significant barriers that respondents have faced when integrating physiology and conservation science included a lack of funding, logistical constraints (e.g. sample sizes, obtaining permits) and a lack of physiological baseline data (i.e. reference ranges of a physiological metric's `normal' or pre-environmental change levels). We identified 12 actions based on suggestions of survey participants thatwe anticipate will help deconstruct the barriers and continue to develop a narrative of physiology that is relevant to conservation science, policy and practice.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab030,9,NA,NA,coab030,Barrier; challenge; conservation physiology; conservation science; opportunities; success
article,Effects of human disturbance on postnatal growth and baseline corticosterone in a long-lived bird,"Watson, Hannah and Monaghan, Pat and Heidinger, Britt J. and Bolton, Mark",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Prolonged or repeated episodes of environmental stress could be especially detrimental for developing young, via impaired growth or development. Despite this, most studies investigating the effects of human recreational and tourism activities have focused on adults. An increasing demand for nature-based tourism in remote locations means that many seabirds, which have evolved largely in the absence of predators and humans, are being exposed to novel pressures. The slow-growing semi-precocial nestlings of the European storm petrel Hydrobates pelagicus experience higher mortality rates in nests exposed to human recreational disturbance. Here, we examine whether surviving nestlings reared in disturbed areas are also affected via changes in growth trajectories and baseline circulating glucocorticoids. Nestlings reared in high-disturbance areas displayed delayed mass growth, and we found weak evidence for slower rates of mass gain and tarsus growth, compared with nestlings reared in undisturbed areas. There were no differences in wing growth, consistent with prioritization of long wings, important for post-fledging survival. A tendency for a less marked age-related decline in corticosterone (CORT) in disturbed nestlings offers limited evidence that changes in growth trajectories were mediated by baseline CORT. However, disturbed nestlings could have experienced overall higher GC exposure if the acute GC response was elevated. `Catch-up' growth enabled high-disturbance nestlings to overcome early constraints and achieve a similar, or even larger, asymptotic body size and mass as low-disturbance nestlings. While catch-up growth has been shown to carry costs for parents and offspring, the effects of disturbance were slight and considerably smaller than growth alterations driven by variation in environmental conditions between years. Nonetheless, effects of human recreational activities could be exacerbated under higher levels of human disturbance or in the presence of multiple pressures, as imposed by present rapid rates of environmental change.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab052,9,NA,NA,coab052,Catch-up growth; conservation physiology; CORT; developmental plasticity; glucocorticoids; human disturbance; non-linear growth; tourism

Our results demonstrate that both morphological and physiological traits of the European common frog are strongly impacted by endocrine disruption and that ontogenetic stage modulates the sensitivity of R. temporaria to endocrine disruption. Effective conservation actions require knowledge on the sensitivity of species to pollution and other anthropogenic stressors. Many of these stressors are endocrine disruptors (EDs) that can impair the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis and thus alter thyroid hormone (TH) levels with physiological consequences to wildlife. Due to their specific habitat requirements, amphibians are often sentinels of environmental degradation. We investigated how altered TH levels affected the bioenergetics of growth and development (i.e. age, size, metabolism, cardiac function and energy stores) before, during and after metamorphosis in the European common frog (Rana temporaria). We also determined how ontogenetic stage affected susceptibility to endocrine disruption and estimated juvenile performance. TH levels significantly affected growth and energetics at all developmental stages. Tadpoles and froglets exposed to high TH levels were significantly younger, smaller and lighter at all stages compared to those in control and low TH groups, indicating increased developmental and reduced growth rates. Across all ontogenetic stages tested, physiological consequences were rapidly observed after exposure to EDs. High TH increased heart rate by an average of 86\% and reduced energy stores (fat content) by 33\% compared to controls. Effects of exposure were smallest after the completion of metamorphosis. Our results demonstrate that both morphological and physiological traits of the European common frog are strongly impacted by endocrine disruption and that ontogenetic stage modulates the sensitivity of this species to endocrine disruption.

To overcome some challenges associated with faecal hormone collection/analysis, waterborne corticosterone (wCM) was validated through ACTH challenge. This study sought to develop non-invasive techniques to monitor glucocorticoids in captive Necturus as a means to correlate inter-renal gland function in relation to environmental and physiological changes. Six individually housed breeding pairs of captive Necturus beyeri were subjected to seasonal changes in water temperature (30 degrees F temperature differential) to stimulate natural breeding, specifically spermatophore deposition and oviposition. An enzyme immunoassay was validated for the measurement of N. beyeri faecal corticosterone metabolites (fCMs) by exhibiting parallelism and accuracy to the standard curve. Longitudinal (December 2016-October 2017) assessment of fCM concentrations and pattern of excretion from samples collected fromthe six breeding pairs revealed a seasonal inter-renal effect with higher concentrations (P < 0.05) excreted during months (December-March) of the year associated with breeding activity and when water temperatures were lowest. Males from each pair produced spermatophores starting on 08 December 8 2016 and ending on 05 April 2017. Females from four of the six pairs went on to successfully oviposit eggs in mid-late April 2017. One clutch was fertile, and three were non-fertile. No differences (P > 0.05) were detected in fCM concentrations between pairs in which oviposition did or did not occur. In addition, a novel waterborne corticosterone metabolite (wCM) assay was validated to overcome challenges associated with faecal collection in a group-housed amphibian. An adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge performed in an adult male Necturus maculosus resulted in a 50-fold increase in wCM at 4 h post-injection and marked the first demonstration of a waterborne inter-renal response to ACTH in Necturus.

article,Invasive investigation: uptake and transport of l-leucine in the gill epithelium of crustaceans,"Griffin, Robert A. and Boyd, Aaron and Weinrauch, Alyssa and Blewett, Tamzin A.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Many aquatic species are well known as extremely successful invaders. The green crab (Carcinus maenas) is an arthropod native to European waters; however, it is now known to be a globally invasive species. Recently, it was discovered that the C. maenas could transport nutrients in the form of amino acids across their gill from the surrounding environment, a feat previously thought to be impossible in arthropods. We compared the ability for branchial amino acid transport of crustacean's native to Canadian Pacific waters to that of the invasive C. maenas, determining if this was a novel pathway in an extremely successful invasive species, or a shared trait among crustaceans. Active transport of l-leucine was exhibited in C. maenas, Metacarcinus gracilis, Metacarcinus magister, and Cancer productus across their gill epithelia. Carcinus maenas exhibited the highest maximum rate of branchial l-leucine transport at 53.7 +/- 6.24 nmolg(-1) h(-1), over twice the rate of two native Canadian crustaceans. We also examined the influence of feeding, gill specificity, and organ accumulation of l-leucine. Feeding events displayed a heavy influence on the branchial transport rate of amino acids, increasing l-leucine transport rates by up to 10-fold in C. maenas. l-leucine displayed a significantly higher accumulation rate in the gills of C. maenas compared to the rest of the body at 4.15 +/- 0.78 nmolg(-1) h(-1), with the stomach, hepatopancreas, eyestalks, muscle tissue, carapace and heart muscle exhibiting accumulation under 0.15 nmolg(-1) h(-1). For the first time, the novel transport of amino acids in Canadian native arthropods is described, suggesting that branchial amino acid transport is a shared trait among arthropods, contrary to existing literature. Further investigation is required to determine the influence of environmental temperature and salinity on transport in each species to outline any competitive advantages of the invasive C. maenas in a fluctuating estuarine environment. Branchial amino acid uptake is evaluated in the invasive Carcinus maenas and compared to native Canadian crustaceans. l-leucine transport and accumulation throughout the body of the green crab is also evaluated in various gill and organ tissues in fed and fasted states.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad015,11,1,NA,coad015,invasive species nutrient uptake; branchial transport; Arthropod
article,Reduced metabolic rate indicates declining viability in seed collections: an experimental proof-of-concept,"Dalziell, Emma L. and Tomlinson, Sean",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"There is increasing investment globally in seed storage facilities for a wide array of purposes, from food security to biodiversity conservation. Best practice when storing seeds in this manner is to periodically test collections for viability, such that declining viability can be used as a trigger for management actions. Typically, viability testing is time consuming and/or destructive, involving germination testing, cut-testing or a range of potential biochemical indicators. Given that respiration (i.e. metabolic activity) is the basic chemical reaction common to all forms of life, measuring metabolic rate should provide a less-destructive, simple and repeatable correlate of seed viability. We compared the viability of seed collections of known proportions of alive and dead seeds to their metabolic rates, calculated as CO2 production (VCO2) measured using flow through respirometery. To maximize the activity of the seeds and our likelihood of measuring metabolic rates, we imbibed the seeds from 12 species of angiosperms, and measured them using an open system respirometer. Measuring metabolic rate in seeds from diverse evolutionary and ecological backgrounds required us to adopt an allometric approach to account for the effects of seed size upon metabolic rate. After doing so, however, we found significant linear relationships between the known viability of our seed collections and their metabolic rates, but these relationships were unique for each species measured. These data provide substantial support to the prospect that measuring metabolic rates can be used to estimate viability of seeds in storage, however, we advocate the development and adoption of more sensitive respirometry equipment, specifically engineered for this purpose in order to achieve truly non-destructive measurements.",2017,10.1093/conphys/cox058,5,NA,NA,cox058,Allometry; ex situ storage; genebank; orthodox storage behaviour; seed conservation; viability monitoring

An approach including assisted reproductive techniques such as sperm cryopreservation may contribute to the management of endangered species. We developed a method for sperm cryopreservation in sceloporine lizards and compared the response among the studied species. Prior to the mating season, we obtained semen from adult males of Sceloporus aeneus (n = 21), Sceloporus grammicus (n = 20) and Sceloporus torquatus (n = 21) via pressure of the genital papilla. Volume and sperm concentration were measured before semen dilution in a Tris-egg yolk (TEY) medium to evaluate progressive motility, sperm viability, morphology, plasma membrane and acrosome integrity. Then, we cooled the remaining volumes to 5 degrees C at a rate of 0.1 degrees C per minute to incorporate glycerol (8\% v/v) in two fractions. Immediately afterwards, we placed 40 mu l of the mix on solid CO2 to form pellets and immersed them in liquid nitrogen for storage. We thawed the pellets at 29 degrees C for 3 minutes and diluted them 1:1 (v/v) in TEY medium to assess sperm quality. We found a positive relationship between body weight and seminal volume in S. grammicus and S. torquatus and a negative correlation with sperm concentration in S. grammicus (P < 0.05). Moreover, we observed that the freezing-thawing process decreased sperm quality in the three species, mostly affecting motility and viability. However, S. torquatus and S. aeneus showed a higher sperm tolerance than S. grammicus.",2022,10.1093/conphys/coac068,10,1,NA,coac068,assisted reproductive techniques; cryopreservation; cryoprotectant; glycerol; reptile; semen
article,Assessing chronic stress in wild mammals using claw-derived cortisol: a validation using European badgers (Meles meles),"Fokidis, H. Bobby and Brock, Taylor and Newman, Chris and Macdonald, David W. and Buesching, Christina D.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Measuring stress experienced by wild mammals is increasingly important in the context of human-induced rapid environmental change and initiatives to mitigate human-wildlife conflicts. Glucocorticoids (GC), such as cortisol, mediate responses by promoting physiological adjustments during environmental perturbations. Measuring cortisol is a popular technique; however, this often reveals only recent short-term stress such as that incurred by restraining the animal to sample blood, corrupting the veracity of this approach. Here we present a protocol using claw cortisol, compared with hair cortisol, as a long-term stress bio-indicator, which circumvents this constraint, where claw tissue archives the individual's GC concentration over preceding weeks. We then correlate our findings against detailed knowledge of European badger life history stressors. Based on a solid-phase extraction method, we assessed how claw cortisol concentrations related to season and badger sex, age and body-condition using a combination of generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) (n = 668 samples from 273 unique individuals) followed by finer scale mixed models for repeated measures (MMRM) (n = 152 re-captured individuals). Claw and hair cortisol assays achieved high accuracy, precision and repeatability, with similar sensitivity. The top GLMM model for claw cortisol included age, sex, season and the sex{*}season interaction. Overall, claw cortisol levels were significantly higher among males than females, but strongly influenced by season, where females had higher levels than males in autumn. The top fine scale MMRM model included sex, age and body condition, with claw cortisol significantly higher in males, older and thinner individuals. Hair cortisol was more variable than claw; nevertheless, there was a positive correlation after removing 34 outliers. We discuss strong support for these stress-related claw cortisol patterns from previous studies of badger biology. Given the potential of this technique, we conclude that it has broad application in conservation biology.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad024,11,1,NA,coad024,stress; steroids; glucocorticoids

We evaluated the effective quantum yield of photosystem II (Phi(PSII)) and the dissipation of thermal energy {[}non-photochemical quenching (NPQ)] thorough the year. The maximum apparent electron transport rate (ETRmax) and the saturating photosynthetically active photon flux density for PSII (PFDsat) were also determined from rapid light curves. We found that although the Phi(PSII) was higher in shaded sites under potential nurse plants than in exposed sites, all values were close to the optimal value of 0.83. The high Phi(PSII) found for A. kotschoubeyanus plants suggests that they use a great proportion of the absorbed light for photosynthesis, under nurse plants as well as in open spaces. We also found higher NPQ values in exposed sites than in shaded ones but only in Autumn, thus reducing the risk of photoinhibition. In addition, the PFDsat was higher in exposed sites than in shaded ones in Spring, Summer and Autumn, but in Winter there were no differences between treatments. We also found high saturating light levels for ETR (PFDsat higher than 1378 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) in all seasons but in winter for shaded and non-shaded plants.

article,Gill structural change in response to turbidity has no effect on the oxygen uptake of a juvenile sparid fish,"Cumming, H. and Herbert, N. A.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Turbidity as a result of increased suspended sediments in coastal waters is an environmental stress of worldwide concern. Recent research on fish suggests that detrimental changes to gill structure can occur in turbid waters, with speculation that these alterations diminish fitness variables, such as growth and development, by negatively impacting the O-2 uptake capacity (respiration) of fish. Specifically to address this unknown, the impact of turbid water on the gill structure, somatic growth rate and O2 uptake rates of a juvenile sparid species (Pagrus auratus) was addressed following exposure to five different turbidity treatments (<10, 20, 40, 60 or 80 nephelometric turbidity units) for 30 days. Significant gill structural change was apparent with a progressive increase in turbidity and was quantified as a reduction in lamellar density, as well as an increase in basal hyperplasia, epithelial lifting and increased oxygen diffusion distance across the lamellae. The weight of control fish did not change throughout the experiment, but all fish exposed to turbid waters lost weight, and weight loss increased with nephelometric turbidity units, confirming that long-term turbidity exposure is detrimental to growth productivity. The growth of fish could be impacted in a variety of ways, but the specific hypothesis that structural alteration of the gills impairs O-2 uptake across the gills and limits growth fitness was not supported because there was no measurable difference in the standard metabolic rate, maximal metabolic rate, aerobic metabolic scope or critical oxygen saturation limit of fish measured in clear water after 30 days of exposure. Although impaired O-2 uptake as a result of structurally adjusted gills is unlikely to be the cause of poor fish growth, the exact mechanism by which growth productivity is affected in turbid conditions remains unclear and warrants further investigation.",2016,10.1093/conphys/cow033,4,NA,NA,cow033,Environmental stress; metabolism; suspended sediments; symmorphosis

Such interactions are especially complex in tropical ecosystems, including endangered peat forests of Central Borneo, a biodiversity hot spot and home to the critically endangered orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii). We combined studies of the digestive physiology of captive orangutans in Australia with detailed field studies of wild orangutans in the Natural Laboratory of Peat-Swamp Forest of Sabangau, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. By measuring the gut transit time (TT) of indigestible seed mimics (beads) in captivity and applying this as a temporal constraint to movement data of wild orangutans, we developed a mechanistic, time-explicit spatial model to project the seed dispersal patterns by these large-bodied, arboreal frugivores. We followed seven orangutans and established home range kernels using Time Local Convex Hull (T-LoCoH) modelling. This allowed us to model individual orangutan movements and to adjust these models according to gut transit times to estimate seed dispersal kernels. Female movements were conservative (core ranges of 55 and 52 ha in the wet and dry seasons, respectively) and revisitation rates to the same location of n = 4 in each 24-h block. Male movements were more unpredictable, yielding fragmented core ranges and revisitation rates to the same location of only 1.2 times each 24 h; males also demonstrated large disjunctions where they moved rapidly over long distances and were frequently lost from view. Seed dispersal kernels were nested predictably within the core ranges of females, but not males. We used the T-LoCoH approach to analyse movement ecology, which offered a powerful tool to predict the primary deposition of seeds by orangutans, thereby providing a reliable method for making a priori predictions of seed dispersal dynamics by other frugivores in novel ecosystems.",2018,10.1093/conphys/coy013,6,NA,NA,coy013,ecological service provision; endozoochory; home range estimates; kernel modelling; orangutan; plant-animal interactions; T-LoCoH

Polar bears may be food deprived and relatively inactive during winter (when pregnant females hibernate and hunting success declines for other demographic groups) as well as summer (when sea ice retreats from key foraging habitats). We investigated muscle atrophy in samples of biceps femoris collected from free-ranging polar bears in the Southern Beaufort Sea (SBS) throughout their annual cycle. Atrophy was most pronounced in April-May as a result of food deprivation during the previous winter, with muscles exhibiting reduced protein concentration, increased water content, and lower creatine kinase mRNA. These animals increased feeding and activity in spring (when seal prey becomes more available), initiating a period of muscle recovery. During the following ice melt of late summer, similar to 30\% of SBS bears abandon retreating sea ice for land; in August, these `shore' bears exhibited no muscle atrophy, indicating that they had fully recovered from winter food deprivation. These individuals subsequently scavenged whale carcasses deposited by humans and by October, had retained good muscle condition. In contrast, similar to 70\% of SBS bears follow the ice north in late summer, into deep water with less prey. These `ice' bears fast; by October, they exhibited muscle protein loss and rapid changes in myosin heavy-chain isoforms in response to reduced activity. These findings indicate that, unlike other bears during winter hibernation, polar bears without food in summer cannot mitigate atrophy. Consequently, prolonged summer fasting resulting from climate change-induced ice loss creates a risk of greater muscle atrophy and reduced abilities to travel and hunt.",2017,10.1093/conphys/cox049,5,NA,NA,cox049,Fasting; myosin heavy-chain isoforms; protein concentration; Ursus maritimus

Adrian and Hepditch, Scott L. J. and Wilkie, Michael P.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"The pesticide 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol ( TFM) is applied to rivers and streams draining into the Laurentian Great Lakes to control populations of invasive sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), which are ongoing threats to fisheries during the lamprey's hematophagous, parasitic juvenile life stage. While TFM targets larval sea lamprey during treatments, threatened populations of juvenile lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), particularly young-of-the-year (<100 mm in length), may be adversely affected by TFM when their habitats overlap with larval sea lamprey. Exposure to TFM causes marked reductions in tissue glycogen and high energy phosphagens in lamprey and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) by interfering with oxidative ATP production in the mitochondria. To test that environmentally relevant concentrations of TFM would similarly affect juvenile lake sturgeon, we exposed them to the larval sea lamprey minimum lethal concentration (9-h LC99.9), which mimicked concentrations of a typical lampricide application and quantified energy stores and metabolites in the carcass, liver and brain. Exposure to TFM reduced brain ATP, PCr and glycogen by 50-60\%, while lactate increased by 45-50\% at 6 and 9 h. A rapid and sustained depletion of liver glucose and glycogen of more than 50\% was also observed, whereas the respective concentrations of ATP and glycogen were reduced by 60\% and 80\% after 9 h, along with higher lactate and a slight metabolic acidosis (similar to 0.1 pH unit). We conclude that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of TFMcauses metabolic disturbances in lake sturgeon that can lead to impaired physiological performance and, in some cases, mortality. Our observations support practices such as delaying TFMtreatments to late summer/fall or using alternative TFMapplication strategies to mitigate non-target effects in waters where lake sturgeon are present.

We show that, when raised in controlled conditions, Atlantic salmon age at maturity is affected greatly by temperature as well as a recently discovered age-at-maturity gene. The influence of temperature on age at maturity differed between two populations, but the effect of the age-at-maturity gene was similar in both temperatures and populations. Age at maturity is a key life history trait involving a trade-off between survival risk and reproductive investment, and is an important factor for population structures. In ectotherms, a warming environment may have a dramatic influence on development and life history, but this influence may differ between populations. While an increasing number of studies have examined population-dependent reactions with temperature, few have investigated this in the context of maturation timing. Atlantic salmon, a species of high conservation relevance, is a good study species for this topic as it displays considerable variation in age at maturity, of which a large proportion has been associated with a genomic region including the strong candidate gene vgll3. Until now, the effect of this gene in the context of different environments and populations has not been studied. Using a large-scale common-garden experiment, we find strong effects of temperature, population-of-origin, and vgll3 genotype on maturation in 2-year-old male Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). With a temperature difference of 1.8 degrees C, maturation probability was 4.8 times higher in the warm treatment than the cold treatment. This temperature effect was population-specific and was higher in the southern (60.48 degrees N) compared to the northern (65.01 degrees N) population. The early maturation vgll3{*}E allele was associated with a significantly higher maturation probability, but there was no vgll3 interaction with temperature or population. Both body condition and body mass associated with maturation. The body mass association was only present in the warm treatment. Our findings demonstrate that (i) populations can vary in their response to temperature change in terms of age at maturity, (ii) high intrinsic growth could be associated with higher thermal sensitivity for life history variation and (iii) vgll3 effects on age at maturity might be similar between populations and different thermal environments.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coac086,11,1,NA,coac086,temperature; life history; Genetics
article,Towards the integration of ecophysiology with fisheries stock assessment for conservation policy and evaluating the status of the Mediterranean Sea,"Falco, F. and Bottari, T. and Ragonese, S. and Killen, S. S.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Recent European Union (EU) regulations have been introduced to discourage the capture of undersized specimens with the aim of reducing the bycatch mortality imposed by commercial fisheries. We argue that we still lack accurate data regarding basic information required to properly implement these regulations for most Mediterranean ecosystems, including the true mortality imposed by fisheries, escape rates from fishing gears and the capability of specimens to survive following discard. We suggest that additional reliance on physiological biomarkers could assist in all aspects of the data collection required to support implementation of the EU discard ban (aka landing obligation), particularly in determining which species should receive special dispensation from this policy. Ideally, this new approach, here termed the `Fisheries Environmental and Physiological Stress Analysis' (FEPSA), would become an important step for any fish stock assessment within the ecosystem approach to fisheries management and the recognition of Good Environmental Status, as established by the EU in the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (2008/56/EC). In particular, the main goal of FEPSA would be applying the study of physiological stressors to exploited stocks to estimate the so-called collateral fishing mortality, which includes the mortality experienced by fish that escape after interacting with fishing gears or that are discarded, with some degree of injury or physiological stress. The approach outlined here, which is described for bottom trawls but adaptable to any other type of fishing gear, is not a trivial undertaking but is a requirement for collecting the data required by recent EU fisheries policies. While we agree that the threats to marine biodiversity posed by fishing and associated discard practices require strong policy interventions, we emphasize that the research programs needed to support such initiatives, including the landing obligation, should be given equal priority. This is particularly true for Mediterranean fisheries, which are at a complex intersection of jurisdictional boundaries, numerous additional ecosystem threats including widespread pollution, thermal variation and hypoxia, and are historically understudied as compared to fisheries and species in more northern climates.",2022,10.1093/conphys/coac008,10,1,NA,coac008,NA

Eryngium sparganophyllum (Apiaceae) is a globally critically endangered plant species endemic to cienega wetlands of southwest North America. To support in situ and ex situ conservation efforts of E. sparganophyllum, we asked (i) howdoes the embryo: seed (E:S) ratio change over time once imbibed, (ii) howdoes germination respond with varying periods of exposure to cold (5 degrees C) and warm (25 degrees C) stratification, and concentrations of gibberellic acid (GA(3)). By answering these questions, (iii) can dormancy class be inferred, and (iv) what storage behaviour category is exhibited? To answer these questions, we collected seeds in Southern Arizona from one of the few remaining wild populations. We measured embryo growth and tested the effects of cold (0-18 weeks) and warm (0 and 4 weeks) stratification, and 0-1000ppmgibberellic acid on germination. We also tested the effects of cold (-80 degrees C) dry (similar to 20\% equilibrium relative humidity) storage on germination. We found that (i) embryos grow inside seeds prior to germination; (ii) compared to control, cold stratification for at least 6 weeks increased germination and warm stratification had no effect; (iii) 1000-ppm GA(3) had the highest germination success; (iv) therefore this species exhibits morphophysiological dormancy; and (v) seeds are orthodox and can therefore be conserved using conventional storage methods.

Allen and MacIntyre, Chris and Linnansaari, Tommi",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"The role of temperature on biological activities and the correspondent exponential relationship with temperature has been known for over a century. However, lacking to date is knowledge relating to (a) the recovery of ectotherms subjected to extreme temperatures in the wild, and (b) the effects repeated extreme temperatures have on the temperatures that induce behavioural thermoregulation (aggregations). We examined these questions by testing the hypothesis that thermal thresholds which initiate aggregations in juvenile Atlantic salmon (AS) (Salmo salar) are not static, but are temporally dynamic across a summer and follow a hysteresis loop. To test our hypothesis, we deployed custom-made underwater camera (UWC) systems in known AS thermal refuges to observe the timing of aggregation events in a natural system and used these data to develop and test models that predict the temperatures that induce thermal aggregations. Consistent with our hypothesis our UWC observations revealed a range of aggregation onset temperatures (AOT) ranging from 24.2 C to 27.1 C, thus confirming our hypothesis that AOTs are dynamic across summer. Our models suggest it take 11 days of non -thermally taxing temperatures for the AOT to rebound in the study river. Conversely, we found that as the frequency of events increased, the AOT declined, from 27.1 C to 24.2 C. Integrating both model components led to more robust model performance. Further, when these models were tested against an independent data set from the same river, the results remained robust. Our findings illustrate the complexity underlying behavioural thermoregulation in AS a complexity that most likely extends to other salmonids. The frequency of extreme heat events is predicted to increase, and this has the capacity to decrease AOT thresholds in AS, ultimately reducing their resilience to extreme temperature events.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coac079,11,1,NA,NA,underwater camera; thermal refuge; thermal hysteresis; thermal aggregation; salmonid; Atlantic salmon
article,Diminished warming tolerance and plasticity in low-latitude populations of a marine gastropod,"Villeneuve, Andrew R. and Komoroske, Lisa M. and Cheng, Brian S.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Models of species response to climate change often assume that physiological traits are invariant across populations. Neglecting potential intraspecific variation may overlook the possibility that some populations are more resilient or susceptible than others, creating inaccurate predictions of climate impacts. In addition, phenotypic plasticity can contribute to trait variation and may mediate sensitivity to climate. Quantifying such forms of intraspecific variation can improve our understanding of how climate can affect ecologically important species, such as invasive predators. Here, we quantified thermal performance (tolerance, acclimation capacity, developmental traits) across seven populations of the predatory marine snail (Urosalpinx cinerea) from native Atlantic and non-native Pacific coast populations in the USA. Using common garden experiments, we assessed the effects of source population and developmental acclimation on thermal tolerance and developmental traits of F1 snails. We then estimated climate sensitivity by calculating warming tolerance (thermal tolerance- habitat temperature), using field environmental data. We report that low-latitude populations had greater thermal tolerance than their high latitude counterparts. However, these same low-latitude populations exhibited decreased thermal tolerance when exposed to environmentally realistic higher acclimation temperatures. Low-latitude native populations had the greatest climate sensitivity (habitat temperatures near thermal limits). In contrast, invasive Pacific snails had the lowest climate sensitivity, suggesting that these populations are likely to persist and drive negative impacts on native biodiversity. Developmental rate significantly increased in embryos sourced from populations with greater habitat temperature but had variable effects on clutch size and hatching success. Thus, warming can produce widely divergent responses within the same species, resulting in enhanced impacts in the non-native range and extirpation in the native range. Broadly, our results highlight how intraspecific variation can alter management decisions, as this may clarify whether management efforts should be focused on many or only a few populations.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab039,9,NA,NA,coab039,NA

However, some WNS-affected species also use thermally unstable roosts during winter that may impact their torpor patterns and WNS susceptibility. From November to March 2017-19, we used temperature-sensitive transmitters to document winter torpor patterns of tricolored bats (Perimyotis subflavus) using thermally unstable roosts in the upper Coastal Plain of South Carolina. Daily mean roost temperature was 12.9 +/- 4.9 degrees C SD in bridges and 11.0 +/- 4.6 degrees C in accessible cavities with daily fluctuations of 4.8 +/- 2 degrees C in bridges and 4.0 +/- 1.9 degrees C in accessible cavities and maximum fluctuations of 13.8 and 10.5 degrees C, respectively. Mean torpor bout duration was 2.7 +/- 2.8 days and was negatively related to ambient temperature and positively related to precipitation. Bats maintained non-random arousal patterns focused near dusk and were active on 33.6\% of tracked days. Fifty-one percent of arousals contained passive rewarming. Normothermic bout duration, general activity and activity away from the roost were positively related to ambient temperature, and activity away from the roost was negatively related to barometric pressure. Our results suggest ambient weather conditions influence winter torpor patterns of tricolored bats using thermally unstable roosts. Short torpor bout durations and potential nighttime foraging during winter by tricolored bats in thermally unstable roosts contrasts with behaviors of tricolored bats in thermally stable roosts. Therefore, tricolored bat using thermally unstable roosts may be less susceptible to WNS.

Embryonic elasmobranchs respond to potential predators by displaying a freezing behaviour, characterized by the cessation of pharyngeal respiration followed immediately by coiling of the tail around the body. We hypothesized that the duration of this freeze response is limited by the embryo's requirement for oxygen. Here, Scyliorhinus canicula embryos were incubated at either 15 degrees C or 20 degrees C during embryogenesis and tested for the duration of, and metabolic consequence of, the freeze response at their respective incubation temperature. Freeze response duration was negatively impacted by routine metabolic rate; embryos at 20 degrees C had 7-fold shorter freeze duration than those at 15 degrees C, potentially increasing their susceptibility to predation. These data demonstrate the capacity for climate change stressors to affect animal behaviour and suggest that this may occur by eliciting changes in the organism's metabolism.

R.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Habitat modification can improve outcomes for imperilled wildlife. Insectivorous bats in North America face a range of conservation threats, including habitat loss and white-nose syndrome (WNS). Even healthy bats face energetic constraints during spring, but enhancement of roosting habitat could reduce energetic costs, increase survival and enhance recovery from WNS. We tested the potential of artificial heating of bat roosts as a management tool for threatened bat populations. We predicted that: (i) after hibernation, captive bats would be more likely to select a roost maintained at a temperature near their thermoneutral zone; (ii) bats recovering from WNS at the end of hibernation would show a stronger preference for heated roosts compared with healthy bats; and (iii) heated roosts would result in biologically significant energy savings. We housed two groups of bats (WNS-positive and control) in separate flight cages following hibernation. Over 7.5 weeks, we quantified the presence of individuals in heated vs. unheated bat houses within each cage. We then used a series of bioenergetic models to quantify thermoregulatory costs in each type of roost under a number of scenarios. Bats preferentially selected heated bat houses, but WNS-affected bats were much more likely to use the heated bat house compared with control animals. Our model predicted energy savings of up to 81.2\% for bats in artificially heated roosts if roost temperature was allowed to cool at night to facilitate short bouts of torpor. Our results are consistent with research highlighting the importance of roost microclimate and suggest that protection and enhancement of high-quality, natural roosting environments should be a priority response to a range of threats, including WNS. Our findings also suggest the potential of artificially heated bat houses to help populations recover from WNS, but more work is needed before these might be implemented on a large scale.",2016,10.1093/conphys/cov070,4,NA,NA,cov070,Bat house; habitat enhancement; habitat modification; Pseudogymnoascus destructans

However, as smolts, the growth rates of the Miramichi (-8\% body mass day-1) and Restigouche (-38\% body mass day-1) fish were significantly slower at 19-24 degrees C, and were in fact negative, indicating loss of mass in this group. Acclimation to 19-24 degrees C also increased Atlantic salmon CTmax. Our findings suggest that both life stage and river origin impact Atlantic salmon growth and performance in the thermal range used herein. These findings provide evidence for local adaptation of Atlantic salmon, increased vulnerability to warming temperatures, and highlight the differential impacts of these ecologically relevant diel thermal cycles on the juvenile life stages in this species.",2024,10.1093/conphys/coae007,12,1,NA,coae007,Atlantic salmon; critical thermal maximum; growth rate; local adaptation; thermal acclimation; thermal performance; thermal variability
article,No consistent effect of daytime versus night-time measurement of thermal tolerance in nocturnal and diurnal lizards,"Dufour, Pauline C. and Tsang, Toby P. N. and Clusella-Trullas, Susana and Bonebrake, Timothy C.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"While essential in understanding impacts of climate change for organisms, diel variation remains an understudied component of temporal variation in thermal tolerance limits {[}i.e. the critical thermal minimum (CTmin) and maximum (CTmax)]. For example, a higher Ctmax might be expected for an individual if the measurement is taken during the day (when heat stress is most likely to occur) instead of at night. We measured thermal tolerance (Ctmin and Ctmax) during both the daytime and night-time in 101 nocturnal and diurnal geckos and skinks in Hong Kong and in South Africa, representing six species and covering a range of habitats. We found that period of measurement (day vs. night) only affected Ctmin in South Africa (but not in Hong Kong) and that Ctmax was unaffected. Body size and species were important factors for determining Ctmax in Hong Kong and Ctmin in South Africa, respectively. Overall, however, we did not find consistent diel variation of thermal tolerance and suggest that measurements of critical thermal limits may be influenced by timing of measurement-but that such effects, when present, are likely to be context-dependent.",2022,10.1093/conphys/coac020,10,1,NA,coac020,NA
article,Effects of incubation temperature on the upper thermal tolerance of the imperiled longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys),"Yanagitsuru, Yuzo R. and Mauduit, Florian and Lundquist, Alexis J. and Lewis, Levi S. and Hobbs, James A. and Hung, Tien-Chieh and Connon, Richard E. and Fangue, Nann A.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Using a common cardiac thermal performance assay, we identified temperature ranges that define the thermal optima and upper thermal limits of the larval life stage of the imperiled longfin smelt larvae. We demonstrated the utility of a cardiac assay for defining appropriate thermal conditions for a species of conservation concern. Upper thermal limits in many fish species are limited, in part, by the heart's ability to meet increased oxygen demand during high temperatures. Cardiac plasticity induced by developmental temperatures can therefore influence thermal tolerance. Here, we determined how incubation temperatures during the embryonic stage influence cardiac performance across temperatures during the sensitive larval stage of the imperiled longfin smelt. We transposed a cardiac assay for larger fish to newly hatched larvae that were incubated at 9 degrees C, 12 degrees C or 15 degrees C. We measured heart rate over increases in temperature to identify the Arrhenius breakpoint temperature (TAB), a proxy for thermal optimum and two upper thermal limit metrics: temperature when heart rate is maximized (Tpeak) and when cardiac arrhythmia occurs (TArr). Higher incubation temperatures increased TAB, Tpeak and TArr, but high individual variation in all three metrics resulted in great overlap of individuals at TAB, Tpeak and TArr across temperatures. We found that the temperatures at which 10\% of individuals reached Tpeak or TArr and temperatures at which number of individuals at TAB relative to Tpeak (Delta N(TAB,Tpeak)) was maximal, correlated more closely with upper thermal limits and thermal optima inferred from previous studies, compared to the mean values of the three cardiac metrics of the present study. Higher incubation temperatures increased the 10\% Tpeak and TArr thresholds but maximum Delta N(TAB,Tpeak) largely remained the same, suggesting that incubation temperatures modulate upper thermal limits but not Topt for a group of larvae. Overall, by measuring cardiac performance across temperatures, we defined upper thermal limits (10\% thresholds; Tpeak, 14.4-17.5 degrees C; TArr, 16.9-20.2 degrees C) and optima (Delta N(TAB,Tpeak), 12.4-14.4 degrees C) that can guide conservation strategies for longfin smelt and demonstrated the potential of this cardiac assay for informing conservation plans for the early life stages of fish.",2024,10.1093/conphys/coae004,12,1,NA,coae004,Arrhenius breakpoint; cardiac performance; climate change; heart rate; larvae; San Francisco Estuary; thermal performance
article,A simple model for the evolution of temperature-dependent sex determination explains the temperature sensitivity of embryonic mortality in imperiled reptiles,"Lawson, Lauren and Rollinson, Njal",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"A common reptile conservation strategy involves artificial incubation of embryos and release of hatchlings or juveniles into wild populations. Temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) occurs in most chelonians, permitting conservation managers to bias sex ratios towards females by incubating embryos at high temperatures, ultimately allowing the introduction of more egg-bearing individuals into populations. Here, we revisit classic sex allocation theory and hypothesize that TSD evolved in some reptile groups (specifically, chelonians and crocodilians) because male fitness is more sensitive to condition (general health, vigor) than female fitness. It follows that males benefit more than females from incubation environments that confer high-quality phenotypes, and hence high-condition individuals. We predict that female-producing temperatures, which comprise relatively high incubation temperatures in chelonians and crocodilians, are relatively stressful for embryos and subsequent life stages. We synthesize data from 28 studies to investigate how constant temperature incubation affects embryonic mortality in chelonians with TSD. We find several lines of evidence suggesting that warm, female-producing temperatures are more stressful than cool, male-producing temperatures. Further, we find some evidence that pivotal temperatures (TPiv, the temperature that produces a 1:1 sex ratio) may exhibit a correlated evolution with embryonic thermal tolerance. If patterns of temperature-sensitive embryonic mortality are also indicative of chronic thermal stress that occurs post-hatching, then conservation programs may benefit from incubating eggs close to species-specific TPivs, thus avoiding high-temperature incubation. Indeed, our models predict that, on average, a sex ratio of >75\% females can generally be achieved by incubating eggs only 1 degrees C above TPiv. Of equal importance, we provide insight into the enigmatic evolution of TSD in chelonians, by providing support to the hypothesis that TSD evolution is related to the quality of the phenotype conferred by incubation temperature, with males produced in high-quality incubation environments.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab020,9,NA,1-14,coab020,Ectotherm; hatchling; mortality; pivotal temperature; testudines; thermal stress
article,Regional thermal variation in a coral reef fish,"Schmidt, Elliott and Donelson, Jennifer M.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"This study investigated the thermal performance of several traits from damselfish populations in two different regions on the Great Barrier Reef (low- and high-latitude). Oxygen consumption rates and aerobic enzyme activity at elevated temperatures were found to differ between the regions, while immunocompetence, haematocrit, and anaerobic enzyme activity were similar. How species respond to climate change will depend on the collective response of populations. Intraspecific variation in traits, evolved through genetic adaptation and phenotypic plasticity, can cause thermal performance curves to vary over species' distributions. Intraspecific variation within marine species has received relatively little attention due to the belief that marine systems lack dispersal barriers strong enough to promote locally adapted traits. Here we show that intraspecific variation is present between low- and high-latitude populations of a coral reef damselfish (Acanthochromis polyacanthus). Co-gradient variation was observed when examining aerobic physiology across a thermal gradient that reflected mean summer temperatures of high- and low-latitude regions, as well as projected future ocean temperatures (i.e. 27, 28.5, 30, 31.5 degrees C). Whilst thermally sensitive, no significant differences were observed between high- and low-latitude regions when measuring immunocompetence, haematocrit and anaerobic enzyme activity. The presence of co-gradient variation suggests that dispersal limitations in marine systems can promote local adaptive responses; however, intraspecific variation may not be ubiquitous amongst traits. Identifying locally adapted traits amongst populations remains necessary to accurately project species responses to climate change and identify differences in adaptive potential.",2024,10.1093/conphys/coae058,12,1,NA,coae058,Damselfish; intraspecific variation; latitudinal gradient; temperature; physiology; adaptation

Our synthesis demonstrates that threats are prevalent during the winter but can be partially mitigated with targeted conservation and management efforts. Winter at high latitudes is characterized by low temperatures, dampened light levels and short photoperiods which shape ecological and evolutionary outcomes from cells to populations to ecosystems. Advances in our understanding of winter biological processes (spanning physiology, behaviour and ecology) highlight that biodiversity threats (e.g. climate change driven shifts in reproductive windows) may interact with winter conditions, leading to greater ecological impacts. As such, conservation and management strategies that consider winter processes and their consequences on biological mechanisms may lead to greater resilience of high altitude and latitude ecosystems. Here, we use well-established threat and action taxonomies produced by the International Union of Conservation of Nature-Conservation Measures Partnership (IUCN-CMP) to synthesize current threats to biota that emerge during, or as the result of, winter processes then discuss targeted management approaches for winter-based conservation. We demonstrate the importance of considering winter when identifying threats to biodiversity and deciding on appropriate management strategies across species and ecosystems. We confirm our expectation that threats are prevalent during the winter and are especially important considering the physiologically challenging conditions that winter presents. Moreover, our findings emphasize that climate change and winter-related constraints on organisms will intersect with other stressors to potentially magnify threats and further complicate management. Though conservation and management practices are less commonly considered during the winter season, we identified several potential or already realized applications relevant to winter that could be beneficial. Many of the examples are quite recent, suggesting a potential turning point for applied winter biology. This growing body of literature is promising but we submit that more research is needed to identify and address threats to wintering biota for targeted and proactive conservation. We suggest that management decisions consider the importance of winter and incorporate winter specific strategies for holistic and mechanistic conservation and resource management.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad027,11,1,NA,coad027,Winter; Management; Conservation

The oxygen-and capacity-limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT) hypothesis prescribes MS as an overarching benchmark for fitness-related performance and assumes that any anaerobic contribution within the MS is insignificant. The MS is typically derived from respirometry by subtracting standard metabolic rate from the maximal metabolic rate; however, the methodology rarely accounts for anaerobic metabolism within the MS. Using gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) and Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata), this study tested for trade-offs (i) between aerobic and anaerobic components of locomotor performance; and (ii) between the corresponding components of the MS. Data collection involved measuring oxygen consumption rate at increasing swimming speeds, using the gait transition from steady to unsteady (burst-assisted) swimming to detect the onset of anaerobic metabolism. Results provided evidence of the locomotor performance trade-off, but only in S. aurata. In contrast, both species revealed significant negative correlations between aerobic and anaerobic components of the MS, indicating a trade-off where both components of the MS cannot be optimized simultaneously. Importantly, the fraction of the MS influenced by anaerobic metabolism was on average 24.3 and 26.1\% in S. aurata and P. reticulata, respectively. These data highlight the importance of taking anaerobic metabolism into account when assessing effects of environmental variation on the MS, because the fraction where anaerobic metabolism occurs is a poor indicator of sustainable aerobic performance. Our results suggest that without accounting for anaerobic metabolism within the MS, studies involving the OCLTT hypothesis could overestimate the metabolic scope available for sustainable activities and the ability of individuals and species to cope with climate change.",2016,10.1093/conphys/cow019,4,NA,NA,cow019,Aerobic metabolic scope; anaerobic metabolism; oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT); sea bream (Sparus aurata); trade-off; Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata)
article,"Resilience and phenotypic plasticity of Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) facing cyclic hypoxia: insights into growth, energy stores and hepatic metabolism","Ducros, Loick and Touaibia, Mohamed and Pichaud, Nicolas and Lamarre, Simon G.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) is facing the decline of its southernmost populations due to several factors including rising temperatures and eutrophication. These conditions are also conducive to episodes of cyclic hypoxia, another possible threat to this species. In fact, lack of oxygen and reoxygenation can both have serious consequences on fish as a result of altered ATP balance and an elevated risk of oxidative burst. Thus, fish must adjust their phenotype to survive and equilibrate their energetic budget. However, their energy allocation strategy could imply a reduction in growth which could be deleterious for their fitness. Although the impact of cyclic hypoxia is a major issue for ecosystems and fisheries worldwide, our knowledge on how salmonid deal with high oxygen fluctuations remains limited. Our objective was to characterize the effects of cyclic hypoxia on growth and metabolism in Arctic char. We monitored growth parameters (specific growth rate, condition factor), hepatosomatic and visceral indexes, relative heart mass and hematocrit of Arctic char exposed to 30 days of cyclic hypoxia. We also measured the hepatic protein synthesis rate, hepatic triglycerides as well as muscle glucose, glycogen and lactate and quantified hepatic metabolites during this treatment. The first days of cyclic hypoxia slightly reduce growth performance with a downward trend in specific growth rate in mass and condition factor variation compared to the control group. This acute exposure also induced a profound metabolome reorganization in the liver with an alteration of amino acid, carbohydrate and lipid metabolisms. However, fish rebalanced their metabolic activities and successfully maintained their growth and energetic reserves after 1 month of cyclic hypoxia. These results demonstrate the impressive ability of Arctic char to cope with its changing environment but also highlight a certain vulnerability of this species during the first days of a cyclic hypoxia event.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad099,11,1,NA,coad099,acclimation; fish; growth; hypoxia; metabolites; reoxygenation; resilience
article,Bisphenols alter thermal responses and performance in zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>),"Wu, Nicholas C. and Seebacher, Frank",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Plastic pollutants are novel environmental stressors that are now persistent components of natural ecosystems. Endocrine disrupting chemicals such as bisphenols that leach out of plastics can modify physiological responses of animals by interfering with hormone signalling. Here, we tested whether three commonly produced bisphenols, bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol F (BPF) and bisphenol S (BPS), impair thermal acclimation of swimming performance and metabolic enzyme [}citrate synthase (CS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)] activities in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). We found that exposure to 30-mu gl(-1) BPF and BPS, but not BPA, reduced swimming performance, and no interactions between bisphenol exposure and acclimation (3 weeks to 18 degrees C and 28 degrees C) or acute test (18 degrees C and 28 degrees C) temperatures were found. BPA interacted with acclimation and acute test temperatures to determine CS activity, an indicator of mitochondria! density and aerobic metabolic capacity. BPS reduced CS activity and an interaction (at a one-tailed significance) between acclimation temperature and BPF exposure determined CS activity. LDH activity reflects anaerobic ATP production capacity, and BPA and BPF altered the effects of thermal acclimation and acute test temperatures on LDH activity. Our data show that all bisphenols we tested at ecologically relevant concentrations can disrupt the thermal responses of fish. BPS and BPF are used as environmentally safer alternatives to BPA, but our data show that these bisphenols are also of concern, particularly in thermally variable environments.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coaa138,9,NA,NA,coaa138,Locomotion; metabolism; plastic pollution; temperature; thermal acclimation

Given that (i) temperature is considered to be a key factor controlling the biology of fishes; (ii) no published data are available on the swimming performance, metabolic capacity or cardiac function of any of the similar to 165 grouper species worldwide; and (iii) the Nassau grouper is an endangered species of great ecological and socioeconomic significance in The Bahamas, we investigated how current summer/early fall (30 degrees C) and winter (22 degrees C) temperatures in South Eleuthera affected the aerobic metabolism and heart function of wild Nassau grouper when swum to exhaustion (i.e. to their critical swimming speed, U-crit). The Nassau grouper had a very low U-crit at 30 degrees C (i.e. <1 body lengths s(-1)), and a 30\% lower swimming performance during the winter (at 22 degrees C), and this was that was indicative of a reduced absolute aerobic scope (similar to 185 vs. 290 mg O-2 kg(-1) h(-1)) and values of maximum heart rate (f(HMax)) and scope for f(H) that were only one-half of that achieved at 30 degrees C (similar to 60 vs. 120 and 29 vs. 61 beats min(-1), respectively). Overall, these data reveal that the Nassau grouper's aerobic and swimming capacity are well below values reported for other tropical/subtropical fishes and suggest that, despite a compensatory (similar to 30-40\%) increase in stroke volume, constraints on f(H) near this species' lower thermal limit negatively affect its cardiac output and swimming performance.

M. and Domenici, Paolo and Munday, Phillip L. and McCormick, Mark I.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Recent studies demonstrate that the elevated temperatures predicted to occur by the end of the century can affect the physiological performance and behaviour of larval and juvenile fishes; however, little is known of the effect of these temperatures on ecological processes, such as predator-prey interactions. Here, we show that exposure to elevated temperatures significantly affected the predator-prey interactions of a pair of common reef fish, the planktivorous damselfish (Pomacentrus wardi) and the piscivorous dottyback (Pseudochromis fuscus). When predators exposed to elevated temperatures interacted with prey exposed in a similar manner, maximal attack speeds increased. This effect coupled with decreasing prey escape speeds and escape distances led to increased predation rates. Prey exposed to elevated temperatures also had decreased reaction distances and increased apparent looming threshold, suggesting that their sensory performance was affected. This occurred despite the increase in maximal attack speeds, which in other species has been shown to increase reaction distances. These results suggest that the escape performance of prey is sensitive to short-term increases in ambient temperature. As marine environments become more thermally variable in the future, our results demonstrate that some predators may become more successful, suggesting that there will be strong selection for the maintenance of maximal escape performance in prey. In the present era of rapid climate change, understanding how changes to individual performance influence the relationships between predators and their prey will be increasingly important in predicting the effects of climate change within ecosystems.",2015,10.1093/conphys/cov011,3,NA,NA,cov011,Climate change; coral reef fish; locomotory performance; predator-prey interaction

Oxidative stress biomarkers and acetylcholinesterase activity are useful proxies of stress at the cellular and nervous system level. Such responses are especially relevant for poor dispersal organisms with limited capacity for behavioural thermoregulation, like deep subterranean species. We combined experimental measurements of upper lethal thermal limits, acclimation capacity and biomarkers of oxidative stress and neurotoxicity to assess the impact of heat stress (20 degrees C) at different exposure times (2 and 7 days) on the Iberian endemic subterranean beetle Parvospeonomus canyellesi. Survival response (7 days of exposure) was similar to that reported for other subterranean specialist beetles (high survival up to 20 degrees C but no above 23 degrees C). However, a low physiological plasticity (i.e. incapacity to increase heat tolerance via acclimation) and signs of impairment at the cellular and nervous system level were observed after 7 days of exposure at 20 degrees C. Such sublethal effects were identified by significant differences in total antioxidant capacity, glutathione S-transferase activity, the ratio of reduced to oxidized forms of glutathione and acetylcholinesterase activity between the control (cave temperature) and 20 degrees C treatment. At 2 days of exposure, most biomarker values indicated some degree of oxidative stress in both the control and high-temperature treatment, likely reflecting an initial altered physiological status associated to factors other than temperature. Considering these integrated responses and the predicted increase in temperature in its unique locality, P. canyellesi would have a narrower thermal safety margin to face climate change than that obtained considering only survival experiments. Our results highlight the importance of exploring thermally sensitive processes at different levels of biological organization to obtain more accurate estimates of the species capacity to face climate change.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa067,8,NA,NA,coaa067,conservation physiology; cave beetles; poor dispersal species; antioxidant biomarkers; thermal tolerance; acethylcolinesterase

The skin is the first line of defence in preventing establishment of pathogens and associated infections. Although amphibians undergo regular sloughing of the outer layer of the skin, the potential for regular sloughing to play a role in influencing cutaneous microbial populations and pathogens has been largely overlooked. In the present study, we assessed the effect of skin sloughing on cultivable cutaneous bacterial abundance in the green tree frog (Litoria caerulea). We also examined the effects of temperature and hydric environment on sloughing frequency and microbial re-establishment rates. Our data showed that cultivable cutaneous bacterial abundance was significantly reduced by sloughing events, and frogs kept at `summer' temperatures (23-33 degrees C) sloughed almost twice as frequently as those maintained at `winter' temperatures (13-23 degrees C). No effect of hydric environment on sloughing frequency was observed, but we did find that sloughing in L. caerulea appeared to be linked to ambient light cycles. Examination of the effect of sloughing on microbial recolonization indicated that at cool temperatures, an extended intermoult interval allowed microbial abundance to reach higher levels than at warmer ` summer' temperatures (when the intermoult interval was significantly reduced). Our data suggest that sloughing may significantly influence the establishment and/or maintenance of cutaneous bacterial populations (pathogenic, mutualistic and/or commensal) and this, in turn, may be affected by environmental factors, such as ambient light and temperature. These findings are likely to be important for our understanding of the ecology of skin-based pathogens, such as the amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis.",2014,10.1093/conphys/cou012,2,1,NA,cou012,Chytridiomycosis; global climate change; green tree frog; immune system; moulting; skin

One intriguing example involves polar bears pursuing snow geese on land. As climate change forces polar bears to spend more time ashore, they may need to expend more energy to obtain land-based food. Given that polar bears are inefficient at terrestrial locomotion, any extra energy expended to pursue prey could negatively impact survival. However, polar bears have been regularly observed engaging in long pursuits of geese and other land animals, and the energetic worth of such behaviour has been repeatedly questioned. We use data-driven energetic models to examine how energy expenditures vary across polar bear mass and speed. For the first time, we show that polar bears in the 125-235 kg size range can profitably pursue geese, especially at slower speeds. We caution, however, that heat build-up may be the ultimate limiting factor in terrestrial chases, especially for larger bears, and this limit would be reached more quickly with warmer environmental temperatures.",2016,10.1093/conphys/cow045,4,NA,NA,cow045,locomotion; polar bear; predation; snow goose; terrestrial prey; Ursus maritimus
article,Cardiorespiratory collapse at high temperature in swimming adult sockeye salmon,"Eliason, Erika J. and Clark, Timothy D. and Hinch, Scott G. and Farrell, Anthony P.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Elevated summer river temperatures are associated with high in-river mortality in adult sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) during their once-in-a-lifetime spawning migration up the Fraser River (British Columbia, Canada). However, the mechanisms underlying the decrease in whole-animal performance and cardiorespiratory collapse above optimal temperatures for aerobic scope (T-opt) remain elusive for aquatic ectotherms. This is in part because all the relevant cardiorespiratory variables have rarely been measured directly and simultaneously during exercise at supra-optimal temperatures. Using the oxygen-and capacity-limited thermal tolerance hypothesis as a framework, this study simultaneously and directly measured oxygen consumption rate (MO2), cardiac output (V-b), heart rate (f(H)), and cardiac stroke volume (V-s), as well as arterial and venous blood oxygen status in adult sockeye salmon swimming at temperatures that bracketed T-opt to elucidate possible limitations in oxygen uptake into the blood or internal delivery through the oxygen cascade. Above T-opt, the decline in MO2max and aerobic scope was best explained by a cardiac limitation, triggered by reduced scope for f(H). The highest test temperatures were characterized by a negative scope for f(H), dramatic decreases in maximal V-b and maximal V-s, and cardiac dysrhythmias. In contrast, arterial blood oxygen content and partial pressure were almost insensitive to supra-optimal temperature, suggesting that oxygen delivery to and uptake by the gill were not a limiting factor. We propose that the high-temperature-induced en route mortality in migrating sockeye salmon may be at least partly attributed to physiological limitations in aerobic performance due to cardiac collapse via insufficient scope for f(H). Furthermore, this improved mechanistic understanding of cardiorespiratory collapse at high temperature is likely to have broader application to other salmonids and perhaps other aquatic ectotherms.",2013,10.1093/conphys/cot008,1,1,NA,cot008,Aerobic scope; cardiovascular; climate change; heart rate; migration; oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance

These responses indicate that these two species have the potential to acclimate to temperature changes associated with climate change. The thermally dynamic nearshore Beaufort Sea, Alaska, is experiencing climate change-driven temperature increases. Measuring thermal tolerance of broad whitefish (Coregonus nasus) and saffron cod (Eleginus gracilis), both important species in the Arctic ecosystem, will enhance understanding of species-specific thermal tolerances. The objectives of this study were to determine the extent that acclimating broad whitefish and saffron cod to 5 degrees C and 15 degrees C changed their critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and HSP70 protein and mRNA expression in brain, muscle and liver tissues. After acclimation to 5 degrees C and 15 degrees C, the species were exposed to a thermal ramping rate of 3.4 degrees C center dot h-1 before quantifying the CTmax and HSP70 protein and transcript concentrations. Broad whitefish and saffron cod acclimated to 15 degrees C had a significantly higher mean CTmax (27.3 degrees C and 25.9 degrees C, respectively) than 5 degrees C-acclimated fish (23.7 degrees C and 23.2 degrees C, respectively), which is consistent with trends in CTmax between higher and lower acclimation temperatures. There were species-specific differences in thermal tolerance with 15 degrees C-acclimated broad whitefish having higher CTmax and HSP70 protein concentrations in liver and muscle tissues than saffron cod at both acclimation temperatures. Tissue-specific differences were quantified, with brain and muscle tissues having the highest and lowest HSP70 protein concentrations, respectively, for both species and acclimation temperatures. The differences in broad whitefish CTmax between the two acclimation temperatures could be explained with brain and liver tissues from 15 degrees C acclimation having higher HSP70a-201 and HSP70b-201 transcript concentrations than control fish that remained in lab-acclimation conditions of 8 degrees C. The shift in CTmax and HSP70 protein and paralogous transcripts demonstrate the physiological plasticity that both species possess in responding to two different acclimation temperatures.

article,Physiological response and survival of Atlantic mackerel exposed to simulated purse seine crowding and release,"Anders, Neil and Roth, Bjorn and Breen, Mike",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Understanding how animals physiologically respond to capture and release from wild capture fishing is fundamental for developing practices that enhance their welfare and survival. As part of purse seine fishing for small pelagic fish in northern European waters, excess and/or unwanted catches are routinely released fromthe net in aprocess called slipping. Due to excessive crowding in the net prior to release, post-slipping mortality rates can be unacceptably high. Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) support large and economically important purse seine fisheries but are known to be particularly vulnerable to such crowding-induced mortality. Developing management advice to promote post-slipping survival for this species is currently challenging, due to a lack of understanding of how crowding influences their physiology. Here we examine the physiological response, recovery and survival of wild caught mackerel exposed to various degrees and durations of simulated crowding stress in a series of sea cage trials. The magnitude of the physiological response and its time to recovery was positively correlated with crowding density and duration andwas characterized by cortisol elevation, energy mobilization and anaerobic metabolite accumulation. There were also indications of osmoregulatory disturbance. Skin injury and mortality rates showed a similar positive relationship to crowding density. The physiological disturbance was recoverable for most fish. Instead, the rate at which mortalities developed and the physiological profile of moribund fish indicated that skin injury, likely arising from abrasive contact with netting and other fish during crowding, was the probable cause of mortality. Injured fish also exhibited a loss of allometric condition relative to non-injured survivors. Crowding treatments were potentially confounded by differences in ambient oxygen reduction, water temperature and pre-treatment fish condition between trials, and densities were replicated only once. These results contribute to the development of welfare conscious fishing practices that aim to reduce post-slipping mortality.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab076,9,NA,NA,coab076,NA

We evaluated the effects of time and temperature on immunoactive steroid hormone stability inAsian elephant (Elephasmaximus) blood stored with and without an anti-coagulant before centrifugation. For each elephant (5 male, 5 female), whole blood was aliquoted (n= 2 ml each) into 13 red top (without anticoagulant) or purple top (with anticoagulant) tubes. One tube from each treatment was centrifuged immediately and the serum or plasma frozen at -20 degrees C (Time 0, T0). The remaining 12 aliquots were divided into stored temperature groups: 4 degrees C, room temperature (RT, similar to 22 degrees C), and 37 degrees C, and centrifuged after 6, 24, 48 and 62 h of storage. Serum and plasma concentrations of progestagens in females, testosterone in males and cortisol in both sexeswere quantified by validated enzymeimmunoassays. Steroid concentration differences from T0 were determined by a randomized complete block ANOVA and Dunnett's tests. The only evidence of hormone degradation was cortisol and testosterone concentrations in serum stored at 37 degrees C. Testosterone concentrations declined by 34\% at 48 h and 52\% at 62 h, cortisol was decreased by 19\% after 48 h and 27\% after 62 h at 37 degrees C, respectively. None of the other aliquots displayed significant changes over time at any temperature. In conclusion, steroids appear to be stable in blood for nearly 3 days at room or refrigeration temperatures before centrifugation; steroids in samples with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid were particularly stable. However, warmer temperatures may negatively affect steroids stored without anti-coagulant, perhaps due to red blood cell metabolism. Thus, under field conditions with no access to cold or freezer temperatures, collection of plasma is a better choice for elephants up to at least 62 h before centrifugation.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz031,7,NA,NA,coz031,Asian elephant; cortisol; hormone degradation; progestagens; testosterone
article,Investigating the gill-oxygen limitation hypothesis in fishes: intraspecific scaling relationships of metabolic rate and gill surface area,"Scheuffele, Hanna and Jutfelt, Fredrik and Clark, Timothy D.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Many ectotherms have shown a reduction in maximum body size in the past decades in parallel with climate warming. Indeed, some models forecast a maximum body size decline of 14\%-24\% by 2050 for numerous fish species. The gill-oxygen limitation (GOL) hypothesis is perhaps the most prominent concept regarding the physiological mechanisms underlying the observed trends, implicating oxygen uptake limitations in driving the decline in fish body size with warming. Current scientific debates, however, demonstrate a clear need for a synthesis of existing empirical evidence to test the fundamental assumptions of the GOL hypothesis. Here, we perform a systematic literature review of the intraspecific allometry of gill surface area (GSA) and metabolic rate. Additionally, we introduce a new parameter, the ratio S, which provides a measure of GSA in relation to the metabolic requirements for maintenance (S-SMR) and maximum activity (S-AMR). Support for the GOL hypothesis would be evidenced by a universal decline in S with increasing body mass within each species, such that gills become less equipped to supply metabolic requirements as fish grow. In contrast to the predictions of the GOL hypothesis, we show that the scaling exponents for S-SMR and S-AMR are consistently close to zero, with only a few exceptions where S either increased or decreased. These findings suggest that the GSA of each species is sufficient to meet its oxygen requirements throughout life, and that growth is not universally restricted by oxygen uptake limitations across the gills. We identify the need to investigate hypotheses other than the GOL hypothesis to help explain the observed declines in maximum fish body sizes concurrent with climate warming, in order to facilitate accurate predictions of fish community structure and manage fisheries in the face of climate change.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab040,9,NA,NA,coab040,Allometry; aquatic ectotherms; gill-oxygen limitation theory (GOLT); metabolism; poikilotherms; temperature-size rule
article,The old and the large may suffer disproportionately during episodes of high temperature: evidence from a keystone zooplankton species,"Burton, Tim and Einum, Sigurd",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Widespread declines in the body size of aquatic ectotherms have been attributed to the poorer ability of older, larger individuals to tolerate high temperature. Here, using the thermal death time curve framework, we investigate the relationship between temperature tolerance and size/age by measuring the change in heat tolerance of the keystone zooplankton species Daphnia magna across a range of temperature intensities (and hence exposures of varying duration) among individuals that differed up to 3-fold in size and thus varied in age also. Across the gradient of exposure temperatures, younger, smaller individuals were more tolerant than older, larger individuals. This suggests that the young and the small may be better equipped to withstand temperature challenges that are both intense/brief and more moderate/prolonged. Our study generalizes results obtained from more acute tolerance assays, providing physiological evidence consistent with the observed reductions in ectotherm body size as a response to warming in aquatic systems.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa038,8,NA,NA,coaa038,body size; Daphnia; knock-down time; temperature sensitivity; thermal death curves
article,A novel method for measuring acute thermal tolerance in fish embryos,"Cowan, Zara-Louise and Andreassen, Anna H. and De Bonville, Jeremy and Green, Leon and Binning, Sandra A. and Silva-Garay, Lorena and Jutfelt, Fredrik and Sundin, Josefin",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Aquatic ectotherms are vulnerable to thermal stress, with embryos predicted to be more sensitive than juveniles and adults. When examining the vulnerability of species and life stages to warming, comparable methodology must be used to obtain robust conclusions. Critical thermal methodology is commonly used to characterize acute thermal tolerances in fishes, with critical thermal maximum (CTmax) referring to the acute upper thermal tolerance limit. At this temperature, fish exhibit loss of controlled locomotion due to a temperature-induced collapse of vital physiological functions. While it is relatively easy to monitor behavioural responses and measure CTmax in larval and adult fish, this is more challenging in embryos, leading to a lack of data on this life stage, or that studies rely on potentially incomparable metrics. Here, we present a novel method for measuring CTmax in fish embryos, defined by the temperature at which embryos stop moving. Additionally, we compare this measurement with the temperature of the embryos' last heartbeat, which has previously been proposed as a method for measuring embryonic CTmax. We found that, like other life stages, late-stage embryos exhibited a period of increased activity, peaking approximately 2-3 \& DEG;C before CTmax. Measurements of CTmax based on last movement are more conservative and easier to record in later developmental stages than measurements based on last heartbeat, and they also work well with large and small embryos. Importantly, CTmax measurements based on last movement in embryos are similar to measurements from larvae and adults based on loss of locomotory control. Using last heartbeat as CTmax in embryos likely overestimates acute thermal tolerance, as the heart is still beating when loss of response/equilibrium is reached in larvae/adults. The last movement technique described here allows for comparisons of acute thermal tolerance of embryos between species and across life stages, and as a response variable to treatments.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad061,11,1,NA,coad061,climate change; critical thermal maximum; thermal physiology

Unfortunately, blood samples often cannot be analysed immediately upon sampling, and blood parameters (e.g. blood oxygen levels and acid-base parameters) are known to change with storage duration due to the metabolic activity of the red blood cells. We obtained blood samples from both untreated and stressed individuals of both blacktip reef shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus) and sicklefin lemon shark (Negaprion acutidens) to determine the effects of storage duration on blood pH, haematocrit and haemoglobin concentration ({[}Hb]). We found no significant effects after storage on ice for up to 180 minutes. Moreover, to validate the usability of a HemoCue haemoglobin analyser (a point-of-care device), we compared data from this device to {[}Hb] determined using the cyanomethaemoglobin method with blood samples from 10 individuals from each of the aforementioned species as well as epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum). Values from the HemoCue consistently overestimated {[}Hb], and we therefore developed the necessary correction equations. The correction equations were not statistically different among the three elasmobranch species within the biologically relevant range but did differ from published corrections developed using blood from temperate teleost fishes. Although the HemoCue is useful in field situations, development of species-specific calibration equations may be necessary to ensure the reliability of inter-species comparisons of blood {[}Hb]. Together, these data should increase confidence in haematological stress indicators in elasmobranch fishes, measurements of which are critical for understanding the impact of anthropogenic stressors on these ecologically important species.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz081,7,NA,NA,coz081,haemoglobin concentration; elasmobranch; HemoCue; storage duration; blood; haematocrit

In this study, we assessed physiological responses via faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) measurements in free-ranging mugger crocodiles inhabiting diverse habitats in Gujarat, India. We sampled muggers within Charotar, a rural area (Zone A) with local people having high tolerance towards the presence of muggers, and Vadodara, a region having both urban (Zone B) and rural (Zone C) areas with high levels of human-mugger conflict (HMC). Further, muggers in Vadodara live in water bodies that are mostly polluted due to sewage disposal from adjoining chemical industries. To measure fGCM (mean +/- SEM, ng/g dry faeces) levels in muggers, scats were collected during both breeding (N = 107 scats) and non-breeding (N = 22 scats) seasons from all three zones. We used captive muggers (a focal enclosure) to biologically validate (via capture and restraint) the selected fGCM assay (11-oxoetiocholanolone assay). We showed a significant (P < 0.05) 11-fold increase in fGCM levels between pre-capture (540.9 +/- 149.2, N = 11) and post-capture (6259.7 +/- 1150.5, N = 11) samples. The validated assay was applied to free-ranging muggers during the breeding season, and Zone A showed significantly (P < 0.05) lower fGCM levels (542.03 +/- 71.3) compared to muggers of Zone B (1699.9 +/- 180.8) and Zone C (1806.4 +/- 243.2), both zones having high levels of HMC with polluted water bodies. A similar contrast in fGCM levels was also observed during the non-breeding season. Overall, the study demonstrated that fGCM levels in muggers varied across habitats, and such variation could be due to a multitude of ecological factors that the species experience in their immediate local environment. Moreover, high fGCM levels in muggers of Vadodara during both breeding and non-breeding seasons may indicate a condition of chronic stress, which could be maladaptive for the species.",2024,10.1093/conphys/coae035,12,1,NA,coae035,Conflict; faecal glucocorticoid metabolite; muggers; rural; urban
article,Effect of food availability on the growth and thermal physiology of juvenile Dungeness crabs (<i>Metacarcinus</i> <i>magister</i>),"McLean, Katherine M. and Todgham, Anne E.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Juvenile Dungeness crabs spend similar to 1 year in the San Francisco Estuary, where they undergo considerable growth before returning to the coastal ocean. Previous studies suggest that competition, food scarcity and avoidance of conspecifics may cause some juvenile Dungeness crabs in the San Francisco Estuary to become food limited. Food limitation may force these crabs to forage in higher temperature intertidal environments in the estuary, exposing them to stressful conditions in order to sustain growth and, potentially, necessitating physiological trade-offs in energy allocation between growth and stress tolerance. To investigate the effects of food limitation on aerobic metabolism and physiological performance of crabs, we assessed growth, moulting frequency, metabolic rate, citrate synthase and malate dehydrogenase enzyme activity and cardiac performance, as an index of temperature sensitivity and upper temperature tolerance. Summer- and winter-caught crabs were acclimated to either a high- or a low-food ration for 5 weeks. Overall, our results demonstrated that while food limitation had a negative effect on growth of juvenile Dungeness crabs in both the summer and the winter feeding trials, crabs in the low-food group maintained both metabolic rate at ambient San Francisco Estuary temperatures (15 degrees C; summer trial only) and upper temperature tolerance as determined by failure of cardiac function when compared with crabs in the high- food group (summer and winter trials). Therefore, the ability to maintain stress tolerance when food is limited appears to come as a physiological trade-off to growth. Food-limited crabs were unable to increase their metabolic rate to the same level as that achieved by well-fed crabs; therefore, if exposure to elevated temperatures persists and requires more energy than can be met by crabs in their food-limited state, physiological performance may be compromised.",2015,10.1093/conphys/cov013,3,NA,NA,cov013,Crab; energy allocation; food limitation; thermal physiology

Cyclocarya paliurus responded to varying environmental factors via physiological changes and exhibited variation in growth at a resource plantation of ex situ conservation. The homological relationships revealed low genetic differentiation with only two major sub-populations. Natural forests of Cyclocarya paliurus have been seriously damaged because of the extreme demand for leaf medicinal uses, making conservation of this valuable, medicinal woody species necessary. Because of geographical differentiation and diverse adaptability, in this study we analysed the variations in plant growth and physiological response to environmental factors at a resource plantation of ex situ conservation and determined the homological relationships between local provenance (from Fujian Province, FJ) and introduced provenances showing high-survival rate and better growth (from Zhejiang, Hubei, Guizhou and Jiangxi Province). Our results suggested the following: (i) Plant growth: FJ had the highest plant height but not the largest basal diameter in comparison to that of other provenances. (ii) Physiological responses during the growth periods: water content in leaf of FJ had similar change with that of other provenances, except for the provenance from Guizhou Province; total soluble sugar content in leaf of FJ was more than that of other provenances; calcium content in leaf of all provenances was higher as compared to K, Mg and Na; the highest activity among four kinds of antioxidant enzymes in all provenances was superoxide dismutase, then was polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase, finally was catalase; and total flavonoid among three kinds of secondary metabolites in all provenances showed the greatest content, followed by polysaccharides and total triterpenoid. (iii) Relation analysis: plant growth and physiological responses related with environmental factors, especially temperature and precipitation. (iv) Homological relationships: leaf characteristics among six provenances varied in colour, area and common petiole length, but not the shape of leaf base or apex.

Sean and Nixon, Brett and Clulow, John and Clulow, Simon",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Reproductive technologies such as genome storage and assisted reproduction have a significant role to play in ending or reversing species extinctions. However, such technologies for non-model organisms (i.e. non-mammalian species) are poorly developed. This is particularly true for the reptiles, in which there is a dearth of successful protocols for cryopreserving reptile spermatozoa, despite limited attempts. We investigated sperm cryopreservation in the Australian lizard Varanus panoptes with the objective of addressing the unmet need for an optimized cryopreservation protocol for the spermatozoa of squamate reptiles. We tested the efficacy of two cryoprotectants [}dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and glycerol] as well supplementation with a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (caffeine) to promote post-thaw motility. For cryopreservation, sperm were cooled in straws suspended in liquid nitrogen vapour for 5 minutes (approximately -135 degrees C), before being plunged into liquid nitrogen (approximately -196 degrees C), and later thawed in a water bath at 35 degrees C. Samples were incubated post-thaw for 10 minutes in the presence or absence of 10 mM of caffeine. Both cryoprotectant type and concentration significantly affected percent sperm motility prefreezing, with DMSO being less cytotoxic than glycerol and motility decreasing at higher concentrations of both cryoprotectant types. While cold shock did not significantly affect sperm motility, both cryoprotectant type and concentration did significantly impact the motility of post-thawed spermatozoa. Thus, mid-range concentrations (10\% v/v) of DMSO and glycerol yielded a greater post-thaw motility compared with 5 and 20\% v/v, while DMSO proved superior to glycerol. The addition of caffeine resulted in a significant recovery of post-thaw motility for both cryoprotectants, with higher rates of motility being associated with higher cryoprotectant concentrations. These protocols provide a significant step forward for in situ and ex situ management of threatened reptiles and add to recent evidence that reptilian sperm may have the full range of phosphorylation-mediated cellular mechanisms associated with capacitation, motility and metabolic regulation found in mammalian sperm.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa044,8,NA,NA,coaa044,Assisted reproduction; caffeine; cryoprotectant; dimethyl sulfoxide; genome storage; glycerol; lizard; reptile; sperm motility; spermatozoa

Our study investigated how species adapt to natural and altered stream flow, where we use the threatened Rocky Mountain Sculpin (Cottus sp.) as a model organism. We compared the swimming and station-holding performance of Rocky Mountain Sculpin from four different hydrologic regimes in Alberta and British Columbia, including the North Milk River, a system that experiences increased flows from a largescale diversion. We measured the slip (U-slip) and failure (U-burst) velocities over three constant acceleration test trials. Uslip was defined as the point at which individuals required the addition of bursting or swimming to maintain position. Uburst was defined as the point at which individuals were unable to hold position in the swimming chamber through swimming, bursting or holding techniques without fully or partially resting on the electrified back plate. We found individuals from the Flathead River in British Columbia (with the highest natural flow) failed at significantly higher Uburst velocities than fish from the southern Albertan populations. However, there was no relationship between peak hydrologic flow from the natal river and Uburst or Uslip. Further, Uburst velocities decreased from 51.8 cm s(-1) (7.2 BL s(-1)) to 45.6 cm s(-1) (6.3 BL s(-1)) by the third consecutive test suggesting the use of anaerobic metabolism. Uslip was not different between trials suggesting the use of aerobic metabolism in station-holding behaviours (U-slip). Moreover, we found no significant differences in individuals from the altered North Milk River system.

Physiological responses to fragmentation and edge effects were both species- and variable-specific. Our results highlight the resilience of some primate species to environmental change. Forest fragmentation and edge effects are two major threats to primate populations. Primates inhabiting fragmented landscapes must survive in a more degraded environment, often with lower food availability compared to continuous forests. Such conditions can have deleterious effects on animal physiological health, yet some primates thrive in these habitats. Here, we assessed how forest fragmentation and associated edge effects impact three different components of physiological health in a nocturnal primate community in the Sahamalaza-Iles Radama National Park, northwest Madagascar. Over two periods, 6 March 2019-30 October 2019 and 10 January 2022-17 May 2022, we collected data on body condition, fur condition scores and ectoparasite prevalence for 125 Mirza zaza, 51 Lepilemur sahamalaza, 27 Cheirogaleus medius and 22 Microcebus sambiranensis individuals, and we compared these metrics between core and edge areas of continuous forest and fragmented forest. Body condition scores for all species varied between areas, with a positive response to fragmentation and edge effects observed for M. zaza and L. sahamalaza and a negative response for C. medius and M. sambiranensis. Fur condition scores and ectoparasite prevalence were less variable, although M. zaza and L. sahamalaza had a significantly negative response to fragmentation and edge effects for these two variables. Interestingly, the impacts of fragmentation and edge effects on physiological health were variable-specific. Our results suggest that lemur physiological responses to fragmentation and edge effects are species-specific, and body condition, fur condition and ectoparasite prevalence are impacted in different ways between species. As other ecological factors, including food availability and inter/intraspecific competition, likely also influence physiological health, additional work is required to determine why certain aspects of lemur physiology are affected by environmental stressors while others remain unaffected.

article,"Effects of laboratory salmon louse infection on Arctic char osmoregulation, growth and survival","Fjelldal, P. G. and Hansen, T. J. and Karlsen, O. and Wright, D. W.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"High salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) infestation levels resulting from intensive salmonid sea-cage aquaculture can threaten populations of wild salmonid hosts. This includes anadromous Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), which rely on short migrations into more productive seawater environments to build energy stores for maturation, spawning and over-wintering in freshwater. Elevated salmon lice burdens may limit the benefits of migration by constraining osmoregulation, growth, survival and reproduction. To test for these effects, we simulated anadromous migration in tanks by transferring individually tagged Arctic char smolts (n = 352, averaging 133 g) to seawater where they were infected with salmon lice or left as uninfected controls for 1 month, and then transferring them back to freshwater for 2 months. After the seawater phase, infected post-smolts had a mean of 0.33 (range of 0.09-0.91) mobile lice g(-1) fish weight. At this point, specific growth rates (SGRs) dropped in infected compared to control fish (0.1\% vs. 1.6\% day(-1)). Higher plasma Na+ and osmolality in infected fish also indicate osmoregulatory impairment. Throughout the study, mortality was 18.2\% and 1.7\% in infected and control groups, but sexual maturation was low and comparable between groups. Infection intensity correlated positively with mortality rate and plasma Cl-, and correlated negatively with SGR and condition factor (CF). CF dropped (Delta CF < 0) at intensities of >0.09 lice g(-1) fish weight, and intensities of >0.3 causing zero or negative SGRs and increased mortality were particularly concerning. If infection intensities reach these levels in the wild, char could be impacted by growth restrictions and increased mortality rates, which potentially cause shorter migration durations, lowered reproductive success and possibly also selection against anadromy. This study provides vital information for conservation practitioners wanting to understand the physiologically derived burden salmon lice can have on Arctic char populations, and can be used to define thresholds in the monitoring and conservation of Arctic char populations affected by aquaculture-driven salmon lice infestations.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz072,7,NA,NA,coz072,Arctic char; osmoregulation; physiology; risk index; salmon lice; smolt

More than 10 000 individuals can be caught annually in the United States recreational fishery, of which the vast majority are captured on circle hooks and released alive. The probability of post-release mortality of white marlin released from circle hooks has been documented to be <0.02, but the associated physiological stress resulting from capture and handling techniques has not been characterized despite its importance for understanding the health of released fish. We examined the physiological response of 68 white marlin caught on circle hooks in the recreational fishery and followed the fate of 22 of these fish with pop-up satellite archival tags programmed to release after 30 days. Measures of plasma sodium, chloride, glucose and lactate concentrations taken from fish that were briefly and consistently (mean = 120 s, standard deviation = 40 s) removed from the water increased with angling time, but post-release mortality was inversely related to angling time. The probability of post-release mortality was predicted by elevated plasma potassium concentrations and was more than 10 times greater than has been previously reported for white marlin caught on circle hooks that were not removed from the water. This disparity in estimates of post-release mortality suggests that removal of fish from the water for physiological sampling greatly heightens stress, disrupts homeostasis and thus increases the probability of post-release mortality. Our results demonstrate that elevated concentrations of plasma potassium predict mortality in white marlin and that the probability of post-release mortality is highly dependent on post-capture handling procedures.",2016,10.1093/conphys/cov066,4,NA,NA,cov066,Air exposure; catch and release; handling practices; post-release mortality; stress physiology; white marlin

By examining five metrics of disturbance across four ecologically and evolutionarily disparate species of stream fishes, a series of laboratory experiments aimed to describe the effects of and species susceptibility to anthropogenic noise playback. Each species studied represented a unique combination of hearing sensitivity and water column position. Physiological and behavioral metrics were compared across the presence and absence of rail-noise noise playback in four target species. Through repeated subsampling, the temporal dynamics of cortisol secretion in response to noise in two target species were additionally described. Rail-noise playback had no statistically significant effect on blood glucose or water-borne cortisol levels, with the exception of decreased cortisol in noise-exposed largescale stoneroller (Campostoma oligolepis). Time-course cortisol experiments revealed rapid secretion and showed minimal effects of noise at most observation points. The presence of noise produced significant changes in ventilation rate and swimming parameters in a portion of the four species observed representing the most conserved responses. Overall, effects of noise were observed in species contrary to what would be hypothesized based on theoretical hearing sensitivity and water column position demonstrating that predicting susceptibility to this type of stressor cannot be accomplished based off these course considerations alone. More importantly, we show that anthropogenic noise can disrupt a variety of behavioral and physiological processes in certain taxa and should be further investigated via measures of fitness in the wild.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa089,8,NA,NA,coaa089,Anthropogenic noise; bioacoustics; conservation; rail noise; stress
article,Capture stress and post-release mortality of blacktip sharks in recreational charter fisheries of the Gulf of Mexico,"Mohan, John A. and Jones, Elizabeth R. and Hendon, Jill M. and Falterman, Brett and Boswell, Kevin M. and Hoffmayer, Eric R. and Wells, R. J. David",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Understanding the stress responses of sharks to recreational catch and release fishing has important management and conservation implications. The blacktip shark Carcharhinus limbatus is a popular recreational species targeted throughout the western, central and eastern Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) yet it is unclear what levels of physiological stress result from catch-release fishing practices with hook and line gear and if the stress levels result in post-release mortality. This study correlates physiological response to stress through blood chemistry analysis and examines post-release behaviour of adult blacktip sharks caught to determine post-release mortality rates. Release behaviour was determined by pop-up satellite archival transmitting (PSAT) tags that record temperature, depth and light level data. To quantify physiological stress levels, blood samples were collected from 52 blacktip sharks and a suite of metabolic and osmotic markers were measured. Thirty-six of those blacktip sharks were also outfitted with a PSAT tag yielding time-at-large from 3 to 180 days. Of the 36 tags, 22 (61\%) provided sufficient data to confirm post-release fate and 11 (31\%) were recovered providing high-resolution data. Tag data suggests a post-release morality rate of 22.7\% (95\% confidence interval 7.8-45.4\%), with mortality occurring within minutes (immediate mortality) to over 12 h post-release (delayed mortality). Compared to survivors, immediate mortalities exhibited significantly higher lactate (median 2.8 mmol/L-survivor vs 5.9 mmol/(Limmediate mortality)) and significantly lower hematocrit (median 24.4\% (survivor) vs 14\% (immediate mortality)) levels, but no difference was detected between survivors and delayed mortalities. Higher mortality in the western (30\%) compared to the central (20\%) Gulf may be due to shark handling. All PSATs from mortalities (N = 5) were recovered, and archived data revealed evidence of tag ingestion by predators. Results suggest reduced fight time, decreased handling time and limited air exposure provide blacktip sharks the best survival chances after release by recreational anglers.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa041,8,NA,NA,coaa041,blood pH; hematocrit; lactate; pop-up satellite archival transmitting tag

To assess whether transport stress is a clinically relevant concern for endangered Kemp's ridley sea turtles (Lepidochelys kempii), we obtained pre-transport and post-transport plasma samples from 26 juvenile Kemp's ridley sea turtles that were transported for 13 h (n = 15 turtles) or 26 h (n = 11 turtles) by truck for release at beaches. To control for effects of handling, food restriction and time of day, the same turtles were also studied on `control days' 2 weeks prior to transport, i.e. with two samples taken to mimic pre-transport and post-transport timing, but without transportation. Blood samples were analysed for nine clinical health measures (pH, pCO(2), pO(2), HCO3, sodium, potassium, ionized calcium, lactate and haematocrit) and four `tress-associated' parameters (corticosterone, glucose, white blood cell count and heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratio). Vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate and cloacal temperature) were also monitored. Corticosterone and glucose showed pronounced elevations due specifically to transportation; for corticosterone, this elevation was significant only for the longer transport duration, whereas glucose increased significantly after both transport durations. However, clinical health measures and vital signs showed minimal or no changes in response to any sampling event (with or without transport), and all turtles appeared to be in good clinical health after both transport durations. Thus, transportation elicits a mild, but detectable, adrenal stress response that is more pronounced during longer durations of transport; nonetheless, Kemp's ridley sea turtles can tolerate ground transportation of up to 26 h in good health. These results are likely to depend on specific transportation and handling protocols.",2016,10.1093/conphys/cov071,4,NA,NA,cov071,Corticosterone; glucose; Kemp's ridley sea turtle; sea turtles; stress physiology; transportation stress

S. and Volpov, Beth L. and Trites, Andrew W.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"An unexpected shortage of food may affect wildlife in a different way depending on the time of year when it occurs. We imposed 48 h fasts on six female northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus; ages 6-24 months) to identify times of year when they might be particularly sensitive to interruptions in food supply. We monitored changes in their resting metabolic rates and their metabolic response to thermal challenges, and also examined potential bioenergetic causes for seasonal differences in body mass loss. The pre-fast metabolism of the fur seals while in ambient air or submerged in water at 4 degrees C was higher during summer (June to Sepember) than winter (November to March), and submergence did not significantly increase metabolism, indicating a lack of additional thermoregulatory costs. There was no evidence of metabolic depression following the fasting periods, nor did metabolism increase during the post-fast thermal challenge, suggesting that mass loss did not negatively impact thermoregulatory capacity. However, the fur seals lost mass at greater rates while fasting during the summer months, when metabolism is normally high to facilitate faster growth rates (which would ordinarily have been supported by higher food intake levels). Our findings suggest that summer is a more critical time of year than winter for young northern fur seals to obtain adequate nutrition.",2014,10.1093/conphys/cou021,2,1,NA,cou021,Fasting; metabolism; northern fur seals; nutrition
article,Sex and season influence behaviour and physiology of lake trout following angling,"Howell, Bradley E. and Navarroli, Giulio and DePasquale, Simon W. and Cooke, Steven J. and Hasler, Caleb T.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"We examined impacts of catch-and-release angling on lake trout angled during the summer and fall spawning season. We measured reflexes, blood indices, and, briefly, post-release locomotor activity. Temperature, season, angling depth, and sex influenced many responses. Anglers should employ context-specific practices to prevent negative outcomes when angling for lake trout. Catch-and-release angling exposes fish to challenges that may result in sub-lethal effects or mortality. Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) undergo high rates of release because of size-based harvest regulations or voluntary angler behaviour. Here, we examine short-term impairment in lake trout angled during the summer (n = 74) and fall spawning period (n = 33) to inform best practices for angling. Immediately following capture or 0.5 h post-capture, fish underwent reflex and barotrauma assessments, and a small blood sample was collected. Fish were also fitted with an externally mounted biologger equipped with depth, temperature and tri-axial acceleration sensors, that was tethered to allow retrieval of the logger after 14 min. In the summer, reflex impairment and barotrauma at 0 and 0.5 h were significantly correlated. Loss of orientation and bloating were the most observed indicators. Larger fish and those captured at increased depth had higher barotrauma scores, while prolonged fight times decreased the barotrauma score regardless of sampling time. Plasma cortisol, lactate and glucose increased 0.5 h after capture, and extracellular and intracellular pH decreased, all signs that angling was inducing a metabolic response. However, no relationships were found between blood indices and mortality (18.9\%). The time required to reach maximum depth after release was longer for fish with increased air exposure but shorter for those with longer fight times. During the fall, fish displayed no mortality or reflex impairment. Anal prolapse was the most observed indicator of barotrauma but only observed in females. Blood indices were most altered 0.5 h after capture, with increased cortisol values for fish that were female, particularly large or captured at deeper depth. Locomotor activity was highest for males and increased with depth. Together, our findings suggest that the effects of catch-and-release angling may be dependent on several factors, including sex, season and angling depth.",2024,10.1093/conphys/coae041,12,1,NA,coae041,Barotrauma; catch-and-release; mortality; reflex; stress
article,Defence mechanisms: the role of physiology in current and future environmental protection paradigms,"Glover, Chris N.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Ecological risk assessments principally rely on simplified metrics of organismal sensitivity that do not consider mechanism or biological traits. As such, they are unable to adequately extrapolate from standard laboratory tests to real-world settings, and largely fail to account for the diversity of organisms and environmental variables that occur in natural environments. However, an understanding of how stressors influence organism health can compensate for these limitations. Mechanistic knowledge can be used to account for species differences in basal biological function and variability in environmental factors, including spatial and temporal changes in the chemical, physical and biological milieu. Consequently, physiological understanding of biological function, and how this is altered by stressor exposure, can facilitate proactive, predictive risk assessment. In this perspective article, existing frameworks that utilize physiological knowledge (e.g. biotic ligand models, adverse outcomes pathways and mechanistic effect models), are outlined, and specific examples of how mechanistic understanding has been used to predict risk are highlighted.

A simple and low-cost method of monitoring and collecting particulate matter detaching from (or interacting with) aquatic animals is described using a novel device based on an airlift pump principle applied to floating cages. The efficiency of the technique in particle collection is demonstrated using polyethylene microspheres interacting with a cyprinid fish (Carassius carassius) and a temporarily parasitic stage (glochidia) of an endangered freshwater mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera) dropping from experimentally infested host fish (Salmo trutta). The technique enables the monitoring of temporal dynamics of particle detachment and their continuous collection both in the laboratory and in situ, allowing the experimental animals to be kept under natural water quality regimes and reducing the need for handling and transport. The technique can improve the representativeness of current experimental methods used in the fields of environmental parasitology, animal feeding ecology and microplastic pathway studies in aquatic environments. In particular, it makes it accessible to study the physiological compatibility of glochidia and their hosts, which is an essential but understudied autecological feature in mussel conservation programs worldwide.

For in-water, trawl-captured, immature Kemp's ridleys (minimum N= 31) from Georgia, USA, the objectives of this study were to (1) establish reference intervals (RIs) for packed cell volume (PCV) and 27 plasma biochemistry analytes and (2) determine length-specific relationships in blood analytes. We observed significant positive correlations between minimum straight carapace length and PCV, amylase, calcium:phosphorus ratio, cholesterol, magnesium, triglycerides, total solids, total protein and all protein fractions (e.g. alpha-, beta- and gamma-globulins); aspartate aminotransferase and chloride showed significant negative relationships. These results suggest that certain blood analytes in Kemp's ridleys change as these animals grow, presumptively due to somatic growth and dietary shifts. The information presented herein, in due consideration of capture technique thatmay have impacted glucose and potassium concentrations, represents the first report of blood analyte RIs for Kemp's ridley sea turtles established by guidelines of the American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology and will have direct applications for stranded individuals in rehabilitative care and for future investigations into the health status of wild individuals from this population.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa091,8,NA,NA,coaa091,Health; in-water study; marine turtle; packed cell volume; plasma biochemistry; protein electrophoresis

Recent population decreases in this region have raised concern about their long-term persistence. We used acoustic telemetry to track the migrations of juvenile salmon (smolts) from the Middle River into the Bras d'Or Lake and, subsequently, into the Atlantic Ocean. Roughly half of the tagged smolts transited the Bras d'Or Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean, using a migration route that took them through the Gulf of St Lawrence's northern exit at the Strait of Belle Isle (similar to 650 km from the home river) towards feeding areas in the Labrador Sea and Greenland. However, a significant fraction spent >70 days in the Lakes, suggesting that this population has an alternative resident form, in which smolts limit their migrations within the Bras d'Or. Smolts in good relative condition (as determined from length-to-mass relationships) tended to be residents, whereas fish in poorer condition were ocean migrants.

article,Petroleum-derived naphthenic acids disrupt hormone-dependent sexual behaviours in male Western clawed frogs,"Zhang, Wo Su and Farmer, Elizabeth J. and Muhanzi, Daniella and Trudeau, Vance L.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Naphthenic acids (NAs), the carboxylic acids found in petroleum, are of emerging concern as they contaminate coastlines after oil spills, leech into freshwater ecosystems of oil sands areas and have wide industrial applications. They are acutely toxic in fish and tadpoles and may be endocrine disruptors at sublethal levels. We characterized androgen-dependent courtship behaviours and their disruption by NAs in male Western clawed frogs, Silurana tropicalis. Courtship primarily consists of males producing low trills and achieving amplexus, a mating position where a male clasps a female. Adult males were exposed for 5 days to 20 mg/I NA and injected with human chorionic gonadotropin to induce calling. The duration of calling activity was significantly reduced by NA exposure. Other acoustic parameters such as dominant frequency, click rate and trill length were not affected. Vocalization and amplexus were both inhibited after NA exposure and restored after 2 weeks of recovery in clean water. To determine possible disruption at the level of the testes, the effects of NA exposure on gene expression of key players in steroidogenesis was determined. Exposure to NAs decreased srd5a on average by similar to 25\%. The enzyme 5 alpha-reductase, encoded by srd5a, converts testosterone to its more bioactive form 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), so NAs may be affecting this steroidogenic step. However, the observed upregulation of Ihr, star and cyp17a1 suggests that NA-exposed males may be attempting to counteract the reduced potential to produce DHT. Yet, these NA-exposed frogs have dramatically reduced calling duration, so the observed upregulation of star and cyp17a1 is decoupled from the vocalizations. Calling duration and the ability of males to amplex females is reversibly disrupted by NA exposure, implying that environmental reduction and removal of NAs may help improve habitability of contaminated ecosystems.",2022,10.1093/conphys/coac030,10,1,NA,coac030,endocrine disruption; sexual behaviour; frog; Naphthenic acids

Isotopic abundance analysis reveals no differences between mucus and white muscle, thus confirming mucus samples as reliable non-invasive biomarkers. Mucus production was evaluated using a single labelled meal packaged in a gelatine capsule, with both C-13 and N-15, via a time-course trial. C-13 was gradually allocated to skin mucus fractions over the first 12 h and was significantly (4-fold) higher in the soluble fraction, indicating a higher turnover of soluble mucus components that are continuously produced and supplied. N-15 was also gradually allocated to mucus, indicating incorporation of new proteins containing the labelled dietary amino acids, but with no differences between fractions. When existent mucuswas removed, dietary stable isotopes revealed stimulated mucus neoformation dependent on the components.

In the flood season, the high level of TDG supersaturation (TDGS) frequently occurs in the downstream of dams, causing migratory fish to suffer from gas bubble trauma (GBT) and reducing their survival and swimming ability. Currently, there is a deficiency in particular approaches to evaluate the ecological hazard posed by TDGS on migratory fish as they traverse different flow velocities within their migratory routes. This study assessed the vulnerability of juvenile Schizothorax prenanti (S. prenanti) to GBT from the static setting to 9.0 BL/s during exposure to nominal levels of 100\%, 110\%, 120\% and 130\% TDG. The mortality occurs when the flow velocity surpasses 6.0 and 7.5 BL/s in 100\% and 110\% TDG levels, respectively. For fish exposed to 120\% and 130\% TDG levels, the relationship between survival time and flow velocity is an approximately inverse bell-shaped curve with increasing velocity. The optimal velocity of maximal survival time of juvenile S. prenanti is 3.0 and 4.5 BL/s in 120\% and 130\% TDG-supersaturated water. Both TDG level and flow velocity significantly affect burst swimming speed (Uburst) and critical swimming speed (Ucrit). The cases involving GBT showed substantial declines in Uburst and Ucrit, exceeding 6.0 BL/s and TDG levels greater than 120\%.

Whilst there is some evidence that white light can be an effective deterrent for Chinook salmon smolts, the results have been mixed. There is a need to test the response of fish to different spectra and strobing frequencies to improve deterrent performance. We tested the movement and spatial response of groups of four fish to combinations of light-emitting diode (LED) spectra (red, green, blue and white light) during the day and night, and strobing frequencies (constant and 2Hz) during the day, using innovative LED technology intended as a behavioural guidance device for use in the field. Whilst strobing did not alter fish behaviour when compared to constant light, the red light had a repulsive effect during the day, with fish under this treatment spending significantly less time in the half of the arena closest to the behavioural guidance device compared to both the control and blue light. Importantly, this effect disappeared at night, where there were no differences in movement and space use found between spectra. There was some evidence of a potential attractive response of fish to the blue and green light during the day. Under these light treatments, fish spent the highest amount of time closest to the behavioural guidance device. Further tests manipulating the light intensity in the different spectra are needed to verify the mechanistic determinants of the observed behaviours.

Crayfish species native to Europe, such as Astacus astacus and Austropotamobius torrentium, are facing decline and are increasingly endangered by changing climate and invasions of non-native crayfish, such as Pacifastacus leniusculus and Procambarus virginalis. The success of these invasions largely depends on differences in ontogeny between the native species and the invaders and how changes in the environment will affect the ontogeny. Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) models can be used to investigate such differences because the models capture dependence of metabolism, and therefore ontogeny, on environmental conditions. We develop DEB models for all four species and investigate key elements of ontogeny and metabolism affecting interspecific competition. We then use the DEB models to predict individual growth and reproduction in current and new conditions that are expected to arise from climate change. Although observations suggest that P. leniusculus poses the major threat to native species, our analysis identifies P. virginalis, in spite of its smaller size, as the superior competitor by a large margin-at least when considering metabolism and ontogeny. Our simulations show that climate change is set to increase the competitive edge of P. virginalis even further.

One potential mechanism for this disparity is that local factors cause reduced health and, therefore, reduced survival of individuals. The use of blood parameters to assess sea lion health may help to identify whether malnutrition, disease and stress are important drivers of current trends, but such assessments require species-specific knowledge of how parameters respond to various health challenges. We used principal components analysis to identify which key blood parameters (principal analytes) best described changes in health for temporarily captive juvenile Steller sea lions in known conditions. Generalized additive mixed models were used to estimate the changes in principal analytes with food intake, time in captivity and acute trauma associated with hot-iron branding and transmitter implant surgery. Of the 17 blood parameters examined, physiological changes for juvenile sea lions were best described using the following six principal analytes: red blood cell counts, white blood cell counts, globulin, platelets, glucose and total bilirubin. The white blood cell counts and total bilirubin declined over time in captivity, whereas globulin increased. Elevated red blood cell counts, white blood cell counts and total bilirubin and reduced globulin values were associated with lower food intake. After branding, white blood cell counts were elevated for the first 30 days, while globulin and platelets were elevated for the first 15 days only. After implant surgery, red blood cell counts and globulin remained elevated for 30 days, while white blood cell counts remained elevated during the first 15 days only.

However, empirical evaluations of the efficacy of such remediation efforts are often lacking despite the high economic cost. We assessed the effectiveness of substrate roughening in improving fish swimming performance and linked this to estimates of upstream passage success. Critical swimming speeds (Ucrit) of two small-bodied fish, purple-spotted gudgeon (Mogurnda adspersa; 7.7-11.6 cm total length, BL) and crimson-spotted rainbowfish (Melanotaenia duboulayi; 4.2-8.7 cm BL) were examined.

Swimming performance was improved on the rough compared to the smooth substrate, with Mo. adspersa (Ucrit-smooth = 0.28 +/- 0.0m s(-1), 2.89 +/- 0.1 BL s(-1), Ucrit-rough = 0.36 +/- 0.02m s(-1), 3.66 +/- 0.22 BL s(-1), mean +/- s.e) and Me. duboulayi (Ucrit-smooth = 0.46 +/- 0.01m s(-1), 7.79 +/- 0.33 BL s(-1); Ucrit-rough = = 0.55 +/- 0.03m s(-1), 9.83 +/- 0.67 BL s(-1), mean +/- s.e.) both experiencing a 26\% increase in relative Ucrit. Traversable water velocity models predicted maximum water speeds allowing successful upstream passage of both species to substantially increase following roughening remediation. Together these findings suggest culvert roughening may be a solution which allows hydraulic efficiency goals to be met, without compromising fish passage.",2017,10.1093/conphys/cox034,5,NA,NA,cox034,culvert design; passage; turbulence; velocity barrier
article,Analysis of a mechanistic model of corals in association with multiple symbionts: within-host competition and recovery from bleaching,"Brown, Alexandra Lynne and Pfab, Ferdinand and Baxter, Ethan C. and Detmer, A. Raine and Moeller, V, Holly and Nisbet, Roger M. and Cunning, Ross and Cooke, Steven",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Coral reefs are increasingly experiencing stressful conditions, such as high temperatures, that cause corals to undergo bleaching, a process where they lose their photosynthetic algal symbionts. Bleaching threatens both corals' survival and the health of the reef ecosystems they create. One possible mechanism for corals to resist bleaching is through association with stress-tolerant symbionts, which are resistant to bleaching but may be worse partners in mild conditions. Some corals have been found to associate with multiple symbiont species simultaneously, which potentially gives them access to the benefits of both stress-sensitive and -tolerant symbionts. However, within-host competition between symbionts may lead to competitive exclusion of one partner, and the consequences of associating with multiple partners simultaneously are not well understood. We modify a mechanistic model of coral-algal symbiosis to investigate the effect of environmental conditions on within-host competitive dynamics between stress-sensitive and -tolerant symbionts and the effect of access to a tolerant symbiont on the dynamics of recovery from bleaching. We found that the addition of a tolerant symbiont can increase host survival and recovery from bleaching in high-light conditions. Competitive exclusion of the tolerant symbiont occurred slowly at intermediate light levels. Interestingly, there were some cases of post-bleaching competitive exclusion after the tolerant symbiont had helped the host recover.",2022,10.1093/conphys/coac066,10,1,NA,coac066,NA

In the present study, we examined the effect of temperature {[}ambient river temperature (ART) vs ART+2 degrees C], dissolved oxygen (DO; 100\% vs 80\%) and substrate (presence vs absence) on standard metabolic rate, forced maximum metabolic rate and metabolic scope with Fulton's condition factor (K), energy density (ED) and critical thermal maximum (CTmax) in age-0 Lake Sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, before and after a simulated overwintering event. We found that all the environmental variables strongly influenced survival, K, ED and CT max. Fish reared in elevated temperature showed higher mortality and reduced K pre-winter at 127 days post-hatch (dph). Interestingly, we did not find any significant difference in terms of metabolic rate between treatments at both sampling points of pre- and post-winter. Long-term exposure to 80\% DO reduced ED in Lake Sturgeon post-winter at 272 dph. Our data suggest that substrate should be removed at the onset of exogenous feeding to enhance the survival rate of age-0 Lake Sturgeon in the first year of life.

article,"Sublethal pesticide exposure influences behaviour, but not condition in a widespread Australian lizard","Contador-Kelsall, Isabella and Maute, Kimberly and Story, Paul and Hose, Grant C. and French, Kristine",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Reptiles are overlooked in ecotoxicological research. We assessed the impacts of two commonly used pesticides, fipronil and fenitrothion, on a widespread Australian lizard, using ecologically relevant exposure. Fipronil reduced activity by >= 49\% but did not impact physiological measures. Fenitrothion exposure did not result in detectible changes to behaviour or physiology. Assessment of non-target impacts of pesticides used widely in agriculture and pest management rarely considers reptiles. Despite their integral role in all ecosystems, particularly arid ecosystems, reptiles are not included in risk assessments. Two pesticides used in agricultural pest management are fipronil and fenitrothion. Here, we used a field-based BACI design experiment in semi-arid Australia to investigate the impact of these pesticides on basic physiological and behavioural parameters of a common arid-zone lizard species, Pogona vitticeps. Fipronil and fenitrothion were applied at ecologically relevant doses via oral gavage. Before and after dosing, blood, physical activity and body condition parameters were assessed. We found that temperature significantly influenced lizard activity in the morning period of movement; however, fipronil-treated individuals moved at least 49\% less than fenitrothion-treated and control lizards from 7 days after dosing through to the end of the experiment. Physiological measures did not change significantly before or after exposure to both pesticides; however, other indicators showed evidence of exposure, which remained for the entirety of our monitoring period. On average, cholinesterase inhibition was still >30\% compared with control lizards at the end of 4 weeks, and fipronil sulfone blood residues remained at 0.219 mu g/ml. Our study provides novel insights into the impacts that common pesticides have on widespread lizard species. We show that an ecologically relevant low dose of fipronil alters the behaviour of P. vitticeps, which has the potential to impact longer-term survivability. Persistence of both pesticides in the blood of all treatment lizards throughout the experiment indicates they are unable to clear these toxins within a month of being exposed. This may be significant for compounding exposure and latent toxicity. These findings highlight the susceptibility that reptiles have to a selection of common pesticides and the inherent need for higher prominence in wildlife ecotoxicological research.",2022,10.1093/conphys/coac024,10,1,NA,coac024,pesticide; lizard; ecotoxicology; body condition; arid; Activity

Gary and Wheaton, Catharine J. and Planes, Serge and Mylniczenko, Natalie D. and Rummer, Jodie L.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"The increasing frequency and duration of marine heatwaves attributed to climate change threatens coastal elasmobranchs and may exacerbate existing anthropogenic stressors. While the elasmobranch stress response has been well studied, the role of the unique corticosteroid-1 alpha-hydroxycorticosterone (1 alpha-OHB)-in energy balance is not understood. Therefore, 1 alpha-OHB's utility as a stress biomarker in elasmobranch conservation physiology is equivocal. Here, we analyse the roles of corticosteroids, 1 alpha-OHB and corticosterone, and metabolites, glucose and 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB), in response to stress in a protected tropical shark species, the blacktip reef shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus). Wild-caught neonates were exposed to ambient (27 degrees C) or heatwave conditions (29 degrees C) and subsequently a simulated fishing stressor (1 min air exposure). Blood samples were taken prior to temperature exposure, prior to air exposure, and 30 min, 1 h, 24 h, and 48 h post-air exposure at treatment temperatures. Plasma 1 alpha-OHB was elevated for 48 h in 27 degrees C-exposed sharks but declined over time in 29 degrees C-exposed sharks. Plasma 1 alpha-OHB was not correlated with either metabolite. Plasma glucose was higher and plasma 3-HB was lower in 29 degrees C-exposed sharks. In a separate experiment, blood samples were collected from both neonate and adult sharks immediately following capture and again 5 min later, and analysed for corticosteroids and metabolites. Plasma 1 alpha-OHB increased in neonates within 5 min, but neonates displayed lower plasma 1 alpha-OHB and higher glucose concentrations than adults. We conclude that 1 alpha-OHB does not serve as a classic glucocorticoid role in C. melanopterus under these stressors. Furthermore, we show for the first time, ontogenetic differences in plasma 1 alpha-OHB. Ultimately, our findings provide insights into hormonal control of energy mobilization during stress in C. melanopterus, particularly during simulated heatwave conditions, which seem to alter both endocrine and energy mobilization. Further work is needed to determine the utility of 1 alpha-OHB as a biomarker for the mobilization of energy during a stress event in elasmobranchs.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab067,9,NA,NA,coab067,stress; metabolite; glucose; elasmobranch; corticosteroid

Expansion modeling is crucial for geographic prioritization in management policies. However, the assumption of niche conservatism and the lack of information of the species physiological response to the environmental factors determining species presence may hinder predictions. In this study, we aimed to understand the expansion of the widely distributed plant Carpobrotus edulis in Europe. We contrasted introduced and native C. edulis ecological niches and explored the experimental response to temperature, a major determining factor for species distribution, of native and invasive individuals in terms of different biochemical markers. Niche analysis revealed an expansion of the introduced niche to occupy colder climates. Introduced and native individuals showed differential mechanisms facing low temperatures. Individuals from the native range showed an increased sensitivity to chilling, as reflected by photosynthetic pigment degradation, increased de-epoxidation of xanthophylls and the accumulation of the lipophilic antioxidant alpha-tocopherol. The found physiological differentiation towards an increased invasive chilling tolerance of invasive C. edulis individuals together with a high propagule pressure may explain the introduced climatic niche shift to colder climates observed, allowing the extensive expansion of this species in Europe.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz075,7,NA,NA,coz075,Aizoaceae; antioxidants; performance; photoprotection; random forest; species distribution model
article,"Environmental and physiological correlates of the severity of clinical signs of snake fungal disease in a population of pigmy rattlesnakes, <i>Sistrurus miliarius</i>","Mccoy, Ciera M. and Lind, Craig M. and Farrell, Terence M.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"In the past decade, snake fungal disease (SFD) has been identified as an emerging threat to snake populations throughout the eastern USA. Snake fungal disease is caused by the fungus Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola. Little is known regarding the environmental or physiological variables that affect host vulnerability and O. ophiodiicola virulence in wild snake populations. Understanding the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that correlate with infection severity is a key first step in understanding hostpathogen dynamics. Host vulnerability may vary seasonally as a result of thermal conditions or energetic trade-offs, and pathogen growth rates or dispersal may be tied to seasonal trends in climate. To determine whether season, environmental temperature or energetic trade-offs associated with life-history stage influence an individual's susceptibility to infection, we monitored the severity of clinical signs of SFD, surface air temperature, reproductive status, body condition and serum complement activity (plasma bactericidal ability) in free-ranging pigmy rattlesnakes, Sistrurus miliarius, over the course of 18 months. Seasonal increases in the severity of clinical signs of SFD were correlated negatively with monthly air surface temperature and the mean body condition of the population. Bactericidal ability varied seasonally, but pigmy rattlesnakes suffering from active SFD infections did not exhibit deficits in innate immune function. Infected snakes were in significantly lower body condition when compared with the general population, but seasonal patterns in the mean body condition of the population were not driven by seasonal patterns of infection severity. Our results highlight the potential importance of the thermal environment and energetic status in determining infection severity and outcomes and the need for managers and researchers to consider seasonality of symptom presentation when the goal is to identify the prevalence or incidence of SFD in populations.",2017,10.1093/conphys/cow077,5,NA,NA,cow077,Body condition; ecoimmunology; immune function; life history; Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola; trade-off

Based on theoretical assumptions, a positive link between AS and distribution range has been proposed, but there has been no broad comparative study across species to test this hypothesis. We collected metabolic rate data from the literature and performed a phylogenetically informed analysis to investigate the influence of AS on the current geographical distributions of 111 teleost fish species. Contrary to expectations, we found a negative relationship between absolute latitude range and thermal peak AS in temperate fishes. We found no evidence for an association between thermal range of AS and the range of latitudes occupied for 32 species. Our main results therefore contradict the prevailing theory of a positive link between AS and distribution range in fish. Fishes with a large geographical distribution are expected to also have a large aerobic scope (AS). Our study of the literature found, however, a negative correlation between maximum AS and distribution range fishes living in temperate climates.

The objective of this study was to determine if temperatures experienced at embryonic life stages of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) affected mass and routine metabolic rate (RMR) of a subsequent life stage (free-swimming fry). As part of this, we assessed the contributions and importance of hierarchical levels of biological organization {[}ancestral type (native vs. hatchery-introgressed), population, and family] to variability in mass and RMR of fry. As embryos and alevin, individuals were reared at either natural environmental (5 degrees C) or elevated (9 degrees C) temperatures and then acclimated to either matched or mismatched temperature treatments once yolk sacs were resorbed. Mass differences among fry were strongly influenced by population of origin as well as initial rearing and final acclimation temperatures. Variation in mass-adjusted RMR of fry was also strongly accounted for by source population, acclimation temperature, and individual mass. A significant interaction between population RMR and final acclimation temperature indicated that not all brook trout populations responded the same way to temperature changes. In contrast to expectations, the highest ancestry category (native vs. introgressed) did not significantly influence mass or mass-adjusted RMR.",2018,10.1093/conphys/coy023,6,NA,NA,coy023,Climate change; epigenetics fish; physiology; temperature

We validated a field-friendly drying and storage method for preserving African elephant faeces, addressing logistical challenges of fGCM quantification, while anticipating the growing interest in considering welfare in conservation management. Faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCMs) are a relevant means of non-invasively assessing adrenocortical activity and thus, a key physiological stress response in wildlife populations. However, the widespread use of fGCMs as a stress-related biomarker in conservation biology is often hampered by the logistical challenge of storing collected faecal material frozen until it reaches the laboratory for analysis. Although alternative approaches to minimize potential alteration of fGCM composition post-defecation have been recently identified, there is to our knowledge, no satisfactory alternative method established for the preservation of elephant dung. In this study, we validated a field-friendly protocol for dehydrating African elephant faeces samples using a food dehydrator with desiccant and investigated the stability of fGCM concentrations in the dehydrated faeces when stored at ambient temperature. We collected 40 faecal samples from African elephants and compared fGCM concentrations of freeze-dried and dehydrated sample sub-sets. Samples dried in the field showed a slight but significant overall -6\% reduction in fGCM concentration compared with frozen control samples. However, fGCM concentrations following field dehydration protocol match those of control samples with high accuracy, as evidenced by the low bias and strong coefficient of determination between the two approaches (R-2 = 0.88). In addition, over nearly 2 months, storage time at ambient temperature of the dehydrated samples had no effect on the fGCM concentrations compared with those measured in the control samples (F-statistic = 1.82; P = 0.18). Dehydrating the samples in the field thus provides an easy and cost-effective alternative to freezing, especially when working in remote areas with unstable electrical supply. Our results encourage the widespread use of fGCMs by conservationists as non-invasive means of steroid monitoring of African elephants in the current context of a general increase in wildlife welfare research.

For example, impala exhibit higher faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) levels-indicative of physiological stress-in response to low food quality and higher human disturbance. In this study, we measured faecal triiodothyronine (T3) metabolite (FTM) levels in 446 wild impala from 2016 to 2018 to test the hypothesis that environmental and human disturbances would affect their physiological status. We also validated a faecal thyroid hormone assay. T3 levels mainly regulate metabolic rate and drive thermoregulation-increasing with colder temperatures. We predicted that individuals would have lower FTM levels, indicative of poor physiological status, (i) when food quality was poor, (ii) when ambient temperature (Ta) was high, (iii) in areas of high human disturbance (due to food competition with livestock) and (iv) when FGM levels were high. Interestingly, we found that Ta was the most important predictor of FTM-FTM levels decreased by 70\% from lowest to highest Ta-and food quality and human disturbance only influenced FTM levels when Ta was accounted for. FTM levels also tended to increase with increasing FGM levels, opposite our predictions. Our results suggest that food quality and availability may only partially influence FTM levels and that fluctuations in Ta are a significant driver of FTM levels in a wild tropical ungulate. Given that thyroid hormones are primarily responsible for regulating metabolic rate, they may be better indicators of how wild animals metabolically and energetically respond to environmental factors and only indicate poor nutritional status in extreme cases.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa105,8,NA,NA,coaa105,glucocorticoid; impala; Serengeti; stress; thyroid hormones; validation

For ectothermic animals, thermal sensitivity of digestion is an important determinant of net assimilated energy budgets. A recent study in the Ozark Mountains indicated that eastern collared lizards (Crotaphytus collaris) restricted to encroached glades (characterized by woody vegetation encroachment) experience reduced environmental heat loads and have reduced age-specific growth and reproductive rates compared to populations in intact glades. To assess the potential impact of reduced body temperatures on assimilation rates of C. collaris in encroached glades, we conducted feeding trials across four temperature treatments (28, 31, 34 and 37 degrees C). We tested for temperature effects on voluntary feeding rates, passage times, apparent assimilated energy (AE) and metabolizable energy (ME). Passage times decreased and voluntary feeding rates increased significantly with increasing temperature. Consumption explained the majority of variance in AE and ME, followed by the effect of temperature treatments. Using data on voluntary feeding rates, passage times and ME as a function of temperature, we estimated over a 10-fold increase in predicted daily assimilated energy across temperature treatments (28 degrees C = 0.58 kJ/day, 31 degrees C = 1.20 kJ/day, 34 degrees C = 4.30 kJ/day, 37 degrees C = 7.95 kJ/day). Thus, lower heat loads in encroached glades may cause reduced body temperature and result in restricted energy assimilation rates.

Hypoxia is a challenge for conserving and managing fish populations and demands a better understanding of the short- and long-term impacts of hypoxic environments on fish performance. Fish acclimate to hypoxia via a variety of short- and long-term physiological modifications in an attempt to maintain aerobic performance. In particular, hypoxia exposure during early development may result in enduring cardio-respiratory modifications that affect future hypoxia acclimation capacity, yet this possibility remains poorly investigated. We incubated Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in normoxia (similar to 100\% dissolved oxygen {[}DO, as percent air saturation]), moderate hypoxia (similar to 63\% DO) or cyclical hypoxia (100-25\% DO daily) from fertilization until 113 days post-fertilization prior to rearing all groups in normoxia for a further 8 months. At similar to 11 months of age, subsets of each group were acclimated to hypoxia (50\% DO) for up to 44 days prior to haematology, aerobic metabolic rate and hypoxia tolerance measurements. Hypoxia exposure during incubation (fertilization to 113 days post-fertilization) did not affect the haematology, aerobic performance or hypoxia tolerance of juvenile salmon in later life. Juveniles acclimated to hypoxia increased maximum aerobic metabolic rate and aerobic scope by similar to 23 and similar to 52\%, respectively, when measured at 50\% DO but not at 100\% DO. Hypoxia-incubated juveniles also increased haematocrit and haemoglobin concentration but did not affect acute hypoxia tolerance (critical oxygen level and DO at LOE).

While climate-driven environmental changes threaten salmonids directly, they also change the life cycle dynamics and geographic distribution of pathogens, their resulting host-pathogen interactions and potential for disease progression. Recent studies have established the correlation between pathogen detection and salmonid smolt mortality during their migration to the ocean. The objective of the present study was to screen for up to 47 pathogens in juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) that were held in cages at two key sites of the Sacramento River (CA, USA) and measure potential consequences on fish health. To do so, we used a combination of transcriptomic analysis, enzymatic assays for energy metabolism and hypoxia and thermal tolerance measures. Results revealed that fish were infected by two myxozoan parasites: Ceratonova shasta and Parvicapsula minibicornis within a 2-week deployment. Compared to the control fish maintained in our rearing facility, infected fish displayed reduced body mass, depleted hepatic glycogen stores and differential regulation of genes involved in the immune and general stress responses. This suggests that infected fish would have lower chances of migration success. In contrast, hypoxia and upper thermal tolerances were not affected by infection, suggesting that infection did not impair their capacity to cope with acute abiotic stressors tested in this study. An evaluation of long-term consequences of the observed reduced body mass and hepatic glycogen depletion is needed to establish a causal relationship between salmon parasitic infection and their migration success.

Micronutrients are often limiting in animal diets but may have negative effects when consumed in excess. Though prior research has documented how elevated exposure to individual micronutrients can impact organismal development and fitness, we know less about combined effects of multiple micronutrients. In the wild, monarch butterfly larvae (Danaus plexippus) commonly consume plants in roadside habitats that contain elevated levels of sodium (from road salt) and zinc (from vehicle wear-and-tear). We reared monarch caterpillars to adulthood to test individual and combined effects of dietary sodium and zinc on components of fitness, sodium-linked phenotypes (proxies for neural and flight muscle development) and concentrations of sodium and zinc in adult butterflies. Monarch survival was not impacted by elevated sodium or zinc individually or in combination. Yet, monarchs feedingonsodium-treatedmilkweed developed relatively larger eyes, consistent with a positive effect of sodium on neural development. Measurements of element concentrations in butterfly and plant tissue indicated that monarchs had higher zinc levels than those present in zinc-treated milkweed but lower sodium levels than those present in sodium-treated milkweed. Monarchs developing on sodium-treated milkweed also had prolonged development time, which might be a cost associated with developing extra neural tissue or investing in mechanisms to excrete excess dietary sodium during the larval stage. Our results indicate that sodium, more than zinc, is likely influencing phenotypic development and performance of insect pollinators in roadside habitats. Yet, in contrast to previous work, our experiment suggests that the highest levels of sodium found along roads are not always harmful for developing monarchs.

For effective conservation management, we need to fully understand the consequences of hypoxia on marine key species such as elasmobranchs. Because of their benthic life style, we hypothesized that S. suckleyi are hypoxia tolerant and able to efficiently regulate oxygen consumption, and that anaerobic metabolism is supported by a broad range of metabolites including ketones, fatty acids and amino acids. Therefore, we studied oxygen consumption rates, ventilation frequency and amplitude, blood gasses, acid-base regulation, and changes in plasma and tissue metabolites during progressive hypoxia. Our results show that critical oxygen levels (P-crit) where oxyregulation is lost were indeed low (18.1\% air saturation or 28.5 Torr at 13 degrees C). However, many dogfish behaved as oxyconformers rather than oxyregulators. Arterial blood PO2 levels mostly decreased linearly with decreasing environmental PO2. Blood gases and acid-base status were dependent on open versus closed respirometry but in both set-ups ventilation frequency increased. Hypoxia below P-crit resulted in an up-regulation of anaerobic glycolysis, as evidenced by increased lactate levels in all tissues except brain. Elasmobranchs typically rely on ketone bodies as oxidative substrates, and decreased concentrations of acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate were observed in white muscle of hypoxic and/or recovering fish. Furthermore, reductions in isoleucine, glutamate, glutamine and other amino acids were observed. After 6 hours of normoxic recovery, changes persisted and only lactate returned to normal in most tissues. This emphasizes the importance of using suitable bioindicators adjusted to preferred metabolic pathways of the target species in conservation physiology.

article,Prolonged exposure to low oxygen improves hypoxia tolerance in a freshwater fish,"Gilmore, Kayla L. and Doubleday, Zoe A. and Gillanders, Bronwyn M.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Persistent hypoxic or low-oxygen conditions in aquatic systems are becoming more frequent worldwide, causing large-scale mortalities to aquatic fauna. It is poorly understood, however, whether species can acclimate to long-term hypoxic conditions. In two experiments, we exposed juvenile freshwater fish (Murray cod, Maccullochella peelii) to low-oxygen conditions and investigated acclimation effects. Experiment 1 determined how responses could be modified by exposure to different temperatures (20, 24 and 28 degrees C) and oxygen conditions (control 6-8 mgO(2) L-1 and low-oxygen 3-4 mgO(2) L-1) over 30 days. Experiment 2 determined the acclimation ability of fish exposed to two temperatures (20 and 28 degrees C) and low-oxygen conditions (3-4 mgO(2) L-1) for three different acclimation periods (7, 14 and 30 days). Responses were measured by determining critical oxygen tension (P-crit), loss of equilibrium and aerobic capacity using resting respirometry. In experiment 1, resting oxygen requirements were negatively affected by long-term low-oxygen exposure except at the highest temperature (28 degrees C). However, long-term acclimation in low-oxygen improved tolerance as measured by loss of equilibrium but not Pcrit. In experiment 2, fish could tolerate lower oxygen levels before reaching loss of equilibrium after 7 days acclimation, but this declined overtime. Murray cod were most tolerant to low-oxygen at the lowest temperature (20 degrees C) and shortest exposure time (7 days). Extended low-oxygen exposure resulted in reduced aerobic capacity of fish particularly at the lowest temperature. While prior exposure to low-oxygen may allow fish to cope with hypoxic conditions better in the long-term, acclimation time was inversely related to tolerance, suggesting that resistance to hypoxia might decrease as a function of exposure time. Our study fills a much-needed gap in our understanding of how freshwater species acclimate to hypoxia, and in particular, how exposure to prolonged periods of low-oxygen and elevated temperatures affect organisms physiologically.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz058,7,NA,NA,coz058,Aerobic ability; Murray cod; P-crit; physiological threshold; respirometry
article,Does pre-spawning catch and release angling affect offspring telomere dynamics in Atlantic salmon?,"Duncan, Eleanor and Papatheodoulou, Magdalene and Metcalfe, Neil B. and McLennan, Darryl",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"The practice of `catch and release' (C\&R) angling confers a balance between animal welfare, conservation efforts and preserving the socio-economic interests of recreational angling. However, C\&R angling can still cause exhaustion and physical injury, and often exposes the captured fish to the stress of air exposure. Therefore, the true conservation success of C\&R angling depends on whether the angled individuals then survive to reproduction and whether there are any persisting effects on subsequent generations. Here we tested the hypothesis that the stress of C\&R angling is then passed on to offspring. We experimentally manipulated the C\&R experience of wild adult salmon prior to the spawning season. These parental fish either underwent a C\&R simulation (which involved exercise with/without air exposure) or were left as control individuals. We then measured the telomere length of the arising offspring (at the larval stage of development) since previous studies have linked a shorter telomere length with reduced fitness/longevity and the rate of telomere loss is thought to be influenced by stress. Family-level telomere length was positively related to rate of growth. However, the telomere lengths of the salmon offspring were unrelated to the C\&R experience of their parents. This may be due to there being no intergenerational effect of parental stress exposure on offspring telomeres, or to any potential effects being buffered by the significant telomere elongation mechanisms that are thought to occur during the embryonic and larval stages of development. While this may suggest that C\&R angling has a minimal intergenerational effect on offspring fitness, there have been numerous other reports of negative C\&R effects, therefore we should still be aiming to mitigate and refine such practices, in order to minimize their impacts on fish populations.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad018,11,1,NA,coad018,welfare; stress; senescence; fishing; fish; Conservation biology
article,Simulated maternal stress reduces offspring aerobic swimming performance in Pacific salmon,"Banet, I, Amanda and Healy, Stephen J. and Eliason, Erika J. and Roualdes, Edward A. and Patterson, David A. and Hinch, Scott G.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Pacific salmon routinely encounter stressors during their upriver spawning migration, which have the potential to influence offspring through hormonally-mediated maternal effects. To disentangle genetic vs. hormonal effects on offspring swimming performance, we collected gametes from three species of Pacific salmon (Chinook, pink and sockeye) at the end of migration and exposed a subset of eggs from each female to cortisol baths to simulate high levels of maternal stress. Fertilised eggs were reared to fry and put through a series of aerobic swim trials. Results show that exposure to cortisol early in development reduces maximum oxygen consumption while swimming, and decreases aerobic scope in all three species. Resting oxygen consumption did not differ between cortisol and control treatment groups. We also examined several metrics that could influence aerobic performance, and found no differences between treatment groups in haematocrit\%, haemoglobin concentration, heart mass, citrate synthase activity or lactate dehydrogenase activity. Though it was not the focus of this study, an interesting discovery was that pink salmon had a higher MO2max and aerobic scope relative to the other species, which was supported by a greater haematocrit, haemoglobin, a larger heart and higher CS activity. Some management and conservation practices for Pacific salmon focus efforts primarily on facilitating adult spawning. However, if deleterious effects of maternal stress acquired prior to spawning persist into the next generation, consideration will need to be given to sub-lethal effects that could be imparted onto offspring from maternal stress.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz095,7,NA,NA,coz095,cortisol; maternal effects; Oncorhynchus; Pacific salmon; respirometry; swimming performance

Although temperature is expected to impact whole-organism performance in ectotherms, reversible thermal acclimation has been suggested as a mechanism that may buffer responses to abrupt temperature changes. Here, we test for an effect of acclimation on locomotor performance traits (jump force and stamina) in adults of two predominantly aquatic and closely related frog species from different climatic regions, Xenopus tropicalis (tropical) and Xenopus laevis (temperate). We find significant effects of acclimation temperature on exertion capacity and for jump force in X. tropicalis but no effect of acclimation temperature on burst performance in X. laevis. Our results suggest that the two locomotor performance traits measured are differentially impacted by acclimation temperature in X. tropicalis. Our results further support the hypothesis that lower-latitude ectotherms might have greater acclimation capacity than high-latitude ones. Finally, our results highlight the importance of investigating multiple performance traits when evaluating how animals may cope with changes in temperature. Further work is required to evaluate the potential for acclimation in mitigating the negative impacts of climate change on amphibian populations.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz019,7,NA,NA,coz019,Amphibians; locomotion; plasticity; temperature

M.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Many sharks and other marine taxa use natal areas to maximize survival of young, meaning such areas are often attributed conservation value. The use of natal areas is often linked to predator avoidance or food resources. However, energetic constraints that may influence dispersal of young and their use of natal areas are poorly understood. We combined swim-tunnel respirometry, calorimetry, lipid class analysis and a bioenergetics model to investigate howenergy demands influence dispersal of young in a globally distributed shark. The school shark (a.k.a. soupfin, tope), Galeorhinus galeus, is Critically Endangered due to overfishing and is one of many sharks that use protected natal areas in Australia. Energy storage in neonate pups was limited by small livers, low overall lipid content and low levels of energy storage lipids (e.g. triacylglycerols) relative to adults, with energy stores sufficient to sustain routine demands for 1.3-4 days (mean +/- SD: 2.4 +/- 0.8 days). High levels of growth-associated structural lipids (e.g. phospholipids) and high energetic cost of growth suggested large investment in growth during residency in natal areas. Rapid growth (similar to 40\% in length) between birth in summer and dispersal in late autumn-winter likely increased survival by reducing predation and improving foraging ability. Delaying dispersal may allow prioritization of growth and may also provide energy savings through improved swimming efficiency and cooler ambient temperatures (daily ration was predicted to fall by around a third in winter). Neonate school sharks are therefore ill-equipped for large-scale dispersal and neonates recorded in the northwest of their Australian distribution are likely born locally, not at known south-eastern pupping areas. This suggests the existence of previously unrecorded school shark pupping areas. Integrated bioenergetic approaches as applied here may help to understand dispersal from natal areas in other taxa, such as teleost fishes, elasmobranchs and invertebrates.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab017,9,NA,NA,coab017,Connectivity; cost of transport; marine-protected areas; metabolic rate; nursery areas; ontogenetic habitat shift

J. and Sellers, I, W.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Phenotypic features extending beyondthe body, or EPs, may vary plastically across environments. EP constructs, such as spider webs, vary in property across environments as a result of changes to the physiology of the animal or interactions between the environment and the integrity of the material from which the EP is manufactured. Due to the complexity of the interactions between EP constructs and the environment, the impact of climate change on EP functional integrity is poorly understood. Here we used a dynamic model to assess how temperature and humidity influence spider web major ampullate (MA) silk properties. MAsilk is the silk that absorbs the impact of prey striking theweb, hence our model provides a useful interpretation of web performance over the temperature (i.e. 20-55 degrees C) and humidity (i.e. 15-100\%) ranges assessed. Our results showed that extremely high or low humidity had direct negative effects on web capture performance, with changes in temperature likely having indirect effects. Undeniably, the effect of temperature on web architecture and its interactive effect with humidity on web tension and capture thread stickiness need to be factored into any further predictions of plausible climate change impacts. Since our study is the first to model plasticity in an EP construct's functionality and to extrapolate the results to predict climate change impacts, it stands as a template for future studies that endeavour to make predictions about the influence of climate change on animal EPs.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz083,7,NA,NA,coz083,Climate change projections; extended phenotype; humidity effects; multibody dynamic model; spider web function; temperature effects
article,Only as strong as the weakest link: structural analysis of the combined effects of elevated temperature and pCO<sub>2</sub> on mussel attachment,"Newcomb, Laura A. and George, Matthew N. and O'Donnell, Michael J. and Carrington, Emily",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Predicting how combinations of stressors will affect failure risk is a key challenge for the field of ecomechanics and, more generally, ecophysiology. Environmental conditions often influence the manufacture and durability of biomaterials, inducing structural failure that potentially compromises organismal reproduction, growth, and survival. Species known for tight linkages between structural integrity and survival include bivalve mussels, which produce numerous byssal threads to attach to hard substrate. Among the current environmental threats to marine organisms are ocean warming and acidification. Elevated pCO(2) exposure is known to weaken byssal threads by compromising the strength of the adhesive plaque. This study uses structural analysis to evaluate how an additional stressor, elevated temperature, influences byssal thread quality and production. Mussels (Mytilus trossulus) were placed in controlled temperature and pCO(2) treatments, and then, newly produced threads were counted and pulled to failure to determine byssus strength. The effects of elevated temperature on mussel attachmentwere dramatic; mussels produced 60\% weaker and 65\% fewer threads at 25 degrees C in comparison to 10 degrees C. These effects combine to weaken overall attachment by 64-88\% at 25 degrees C. The magnitude of the effect of pCO(2) on thread strength was substantially lower than that of temperature and, contrary to our expectations, positive at high pCO(2) exposure. Failure mode analysis localized the effect of temperature to the proximal region of the thread, whereas pCO(2) affected only the adhesive plaques. The two stressors therefore act independently, and because their respective target regions are interconnected (resisting tension in series), their combined effects on thread strength are exactly equal to the effect of the strongest stressor. Altogether, these results show that mussels, and the coastal communities they support, may be more vulnerable to the negative effects of ocean warming than ocean acidification.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz068,7,NA,NA,coz068,Byssal thread; ecomechanics; multiple stressors; Mytilus; ocean acidification; ocean warming

H. and Willis, Bette L. and Bourne, David G.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Unravelling the contributions of local anthropogenic and seasonal environmental factors in suppressing the coral immune system is important for prioritizing management actions at reefs exposed to high levels of human activities. Here, we monitor health of the model coral Acropora millepora adjacent to a high-use and an unused reef-based tourist platform, plus a nearby control site without a platform, over 7 months spanning a typical austral summer. Comparisons of temporal patterns in a range of biochemical and genetic immune parameters (Toll-like receptor signalling pathway, lectin-complement system, prophenoloxidase-activating system and green fluorescent protein-like proteins) among healthy, injured and diseased corals revealed that corals exhibit a diverse array of immune responses to environmental and anthropogenic stressors. In healthy corals at the control site, expression of genes involved in the Toll-like receptor signalling pathway (MAPK p38, MEKK1, cFos and ATF4/5) and complement system (C3 and Bf) was modulated by seasonal environmental factors in summer months. Corals at reef platform sites experienced additional stressors over the summer, as evidenced by increased expression of various immune genes, including MAPK p38 and MEKK1. Despite increased expression of immune genes, signs of white syndromes were detected in 31\% of study corals near tourist platforms in the warmest summer month. Evidence that colonies developing disease showed reduced expression of genes involved in the complement pathway prior to disease onset suggests that their immune systems may have been compromised. Responses to disease and physical damage primarily involved the melanization cascade and GFP-like proteins, and appeared to be sufficient for recovery when summer heat stress subsided. Overall, seasonal and anthropogenic factors may have interacted synergistically to overwhelm the immune systems of corals near reef platforms, leading to increased disease prevalence in summer at these sites.",2015,10.1093/conphys/cov032,3,NA,NA,cov032,coral; disease; GFP-like proteins; immunity; phenoloxidase; tourism

However, no study has examined its usefulness as an age marker in a long-lived ectotherm despite the fact that such a marker could prove useful in understanding age distributions of populations subject to conservation programmes. Therefore, we evaluated pentosidine concentrations in the interdigital webbing of 117 female yellow mud turtles (Kinosternon flavescens) at a 35 year study site in western Nebraska where nearly all turtles are of known age. Pentosidine concentrations were extraordinarily low and positively correlated with age in this turtle, but concentrations were too variable to permit precise estimates of age for turtles of unknown age. These results may reflect the remarkable physiological adaptations of this turtle to low temperatures and oxygen deprivation in a highly seasonal environment requiring prolonged hibernation. Whether pentosidine concentrations in other ectotherms occupying less seasonal environments would be more highly correlated with age remains to be determined. However, our results suggest that patterns of accumulation of pentosidine in ectotherms may be fundamentally different from those in endotherms.",2017,10.1093/conphys/cow076,5,NA,NA,cow076,Ectotherm; hydroxyproline; Kinosternidae; Kinosternon flavescens; oxygen stress

In this study, lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus, 200-400 g), which can exhibit vertical migrations of over 100 m daily and can be found at depths of 500 m or more, were implanted with Star-Oddi micro-HRT loggers. Then, their heart rate (f(H)) was measured in a pressure chamber when exposed to the following: (i) increasing pressure (up to 80 bar; 800min depth) at 10 degrees C or (ii) increasing temperature (12-20 degrees C), decreasing temperature (12 to 4 degrees C) or decreasing oxygen levels (101-55\% air saturation at 12 degrees C) in the absence or presence of 80 bar of pressure. Additionally, we determined their f(H) response to chasing and to increasing temperature (to 22 degrees C) at atmospheric pressure. Pressure-induced increases in f(H) (e.g. from48 to 61 bpm at 12 degrees C) were associated with hyperactivity. The magnitude of the rise in f(H) with temperature was greater in pressure-exposed vs. control fish (i.e. by similar to 30 bpm vs. 45 bpm between 5 degrees C and 20 degrees C). However, the relative increase (i.e. slope of the relationship) was not different between groups. In contrast, 80 bar of pressure eliminated the small (5 bpm) increase in f(H) when control fish were exposed to hypoxia. Exhaustive exercise and increasing temperature to 22 degrees C resulted in a maximum f(H) of 77 and 81 bpm, respectively. Our research shows that pressure influences the fH response to environmental challenges and provides the first evidence that lumpfish have a limited capacity to increase f(H).",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab058,9,NA,NA,coab058,Biologgers; heart rate; hydrostatic pressure; hypoxia; lumpfish; temperature

P.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Migratory species travelling long distances between habitats to spawn or feed are well adapted to optimize their swimming economy. However, human activities, such as river regulation, represent potential threats to fish migration by changing environmental parameters that will have impact on their metabolism. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the changes in the swimming energetics of a salmonid species, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.), caused by short-term temperature variations that usually result from the operation of hydroelectrical dams. Intermittent flow respirometry in swim tunnels allows to obtain high resolution data on oxygen consumption of swimming fish which can reflect aerobic and anaerobic metabolism. This method was used to compare the metabolic rates of oxygen consumption before, during and after sudden thermal change. Control (no temperature variation) and experimental (temperature variation of approximately 4 degrees C in 1 h) swimming trials were conducted to achieve the following objectives: (i) quantify the variations in oxygen consumption associated with abrupt temperature decrease, and (ii) assess if the tested fish return quickly to initial oxygen consumption rates. Main results revealed that Atlantic salmon smolts show a strong response to sudden temperature variation, significantly reducing the oxygen consumption rate up to a seven-fold change. Fish quickly returned to initial swimming costs shortly after reestablishment of temperature values. Results from this study can be used to evaluate the species-specific effects of the applied operation modes by hydroelectrical dams and to increase the success of conservation and management actions directed to fish species inhabiting regulated rivers.",2017,10.1093/conphys/cox025,5,NA,NA,cox025,Hydropeaking; intermittent respirometry; oxygen consumption; Salmo salar; streamflow regulation

Dean",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Prior to the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill, little research effort was focused on studying deep-sea sharks in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). While the biology of these fishes remains virtually unknown, they are routinely captured in commercial fisheries as bycatch. In the absence of basic biological data, and with the probability of post-release survival unknown for most species, effective management plans cannot be formulated, making populations highly susceptible to overfishing. Any potential detrimental effects of the DWH oil spill, which occurred at 1500 m deep, are also unknown. Following longline capture, we characterized the physiological blood biochemical parameters related to secondary stress and compared them among seven shark species occurring on the continental shelf edge and slope in the GoM at depths ranging from 200 to 2000 m. We also investigated the relationship between blood parameters and depth as well as proximity to the oil spill site. The deep-sea sharks examined here exhibited variability in blood chemistry associated with the secondary stress response, with values falling within published records for previously studied elasmobranchs. Results suggested that there is greater relative physiological stress in shallower-dwelling sharks as well as smaller-bodied sharks. Further, the rate of core temperature warming was fastest in smaller bodied sharks, which likely contributes to greater physiological stress. The core temperatures of the larger-bodied, deeper-dwelling species were not altered as drastically as the smaller-bodied sharks after being hauled to the surface. Any chronic physiological effects of the oil spill were not detectable as there were no relevant correlations between blood chemistry metrics and proximity to the DWH oil spill site.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coaa113,9,NA,NA,coaa113,Stress; elasmobranch; oil spill

IgA showed a significant loss, but FGMs were stable and appeared to be reliably preserved. Non-invasive methods enable stress evaluation through measuring fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGMs), and immunoglobulin A (IgA) in the feces avoiding stressful blood drawing or stressful restraining of animals in the field. However, FGMs and IgA are mostly analysed in freshly frozen samples, which is difficult when fresh samples cannot be frozen immediately or frozen samples cannot be stored or transported. Good results were also derived from air-dried fecal samples, which are hampered by unstable air humidity in the field. These difficulties may be overcome, when drying of samples could be induced with colorless silica gel (SiO2) granules in a secure set-up, such as an air tight tube. We determined the speed of drying 1.5 g of a fresh fecal sample from six horses on air and on silica gel. Furthermore, FGMs and IgA were analysed in differently stored subsamples from 12 horses: in frozen fecal samples, in air- or silica gel-dried samples stored for 1 day and for 7 days, and in wet fecal samples kept in a tube at room temperature for 7 days. FGM levels remained stable in feces dried on air or on silica gel for 7 days, whereas IgA quantities showed a significant loss.

To overcome these challenges, non-invasive methods were used to monitor rhinoceros in two sections of Addo Elephant National Park, South Africa, namely Addo and Nyathi. These sections were separated by a public road, and the numbers of elephants, predators and tourists were higher in Addo. Faecal samples (n = 231) were collected (from July 2007 to November 2010) from known individuals and analysed for progestagen and androgen metabolite (FPM and FAM, respectively) concentrations. As biotic factors could impact reproduction, we predicted that demographics, FPM and FAM would vary between sections and with respect to season (calendar and wet/dry), climate and age of the rhinoceros. Mean FPM concentrations from pregnant females were seven times higher (P < 0.05) than samples from non-pregnant rhinoceros. Positive relationships were found between monthly temperatures and FPM from non-pregnant females (r(2) = 0.25, P = 0.03) and the percentage of calves born (r = 0.609, P = 0.04). Although FAM peaked in the spring, when the majority of calves (40\%) were conceived, no seasonal patterns in male androgen concentrations were found with respect to month of conception and parturition. Females in Addo had a longer inter-calving interval and were less likely to be pregnant (P < 0.05) compared with those in Nyathi.

We present the first formal evaluation of the effects of continued permethrin exposure on the reproductive success and liver function of a passerine, the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), for two generations. We experimentally treated all nest material with a 1\% permethrin solution or a water control and provided the material to breeding finches for nest building. The success of two consecutive clutches produced by the parental generation and one clutch produced by first-generation birds were tracked. Finches in the first generation were able to reproduce and fledge offspring after permethrin exposure, ruling out infertility. Permethrin treatment had no statistically significant effect on the number of eggs laid, number of days from clutch initiation to hatching, egg hatch rate, fledgling mass or nestling sex ratio in either generation. However, treating nest material with permethrin significantly increased the number of hatchlings in the first generation and decreased fledgling success in the second generation. Body mass for hatchlings exposed to permethrin was lower than for control hatchlings in both generations, but only statistically significant for the second generation. For both generations, an interaction between permethrin treatment and age significantly affected nestling growth. Permethrin treatment had no effect on liver function for any generation. Permethrin was detected inside 6 of 21 exposed, non-embryonated eggs (28.5\% incidence; range: 693-4781 ng of permethrin per gram of dry egg mass). Overall, results from exposing adults, eggs and nestlings across generations to permethrin-treated nest material suggest negative effects on finch breeding success, but not on liver function. For threatened bird conservation, the judicious application of this insecticide to control parasites in nests can result in lower nestling mortality compared to when no treatment is applied.

S. and Trites, Andrew W.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Quantification of costs associated with foraging contributes to understanding the energetic impact that changes in prey availability have on the energy balance of an animal and the fitness of populations. However, estimating the costs of foraging is difficult for breath-hold divers, such as Steller sea lions, that feed underwater. We developed models parameterized with data from free-diving captive Steller sea lions to estimate the costs incurred by wild animals while foraging. We measured diving metabolic rate of trained sea lions performing four types of dives to 10 and 40 m in the open ocean and estimated the separate costs of different dive components: surface time; bottom time; and transiting to and from depth. We found that the sea lions' diving metabolic rates were higher while transiting (20.5 +/- 13.0 ml O-2 min(-1) kg(-1)) than while swimming at depth (13.5 +/- 4.1 ml O-2 min(-1) kg(-1)), and both were higher than metabolism at the surface (9.2 +/- 1.6 ml O-2 min(-1) kg(-1)). These values were incorporated into an energetic model that accurately predicted oxygen consumption for dives only (within 9.5\%) and dive cycles (within 7.7\%), although it consistently overestimated costs by 5.9\% for dives and 21.8\% for dive cycles. Differences in the costs of individual components of dives also explained differences in the efficiency of different dive strategies. Single dives were energetically less costly than bout dives; however, sea lions were more efficient at replenishing oxygen stores after bout dives and could therefore spend a greater portion of their time foraging than when undertaking single dives. The metabolic rates we measured for the different behavioural components of diving can be applied to time-depth recordings from wild Steller sea lions to estimate the energy expended while foraging. In turn, this can be used to understand how changes in prey availability affect energy balance and the health of individuals in declining populations.",2015,10.1093/conphys/cov052,3,NA,NA,cov052,Diving metabolic rate; foraging energetics; Steller sea lion

We sampled fall migrant monarchs from southern Canada through the migratory route to two overwintering sites in 2019 (n = 10 locations), 2020 (n = 8 locations) and 2021 (n = 7 locations). Moderate to extreme droughts along the migratory route were expected to result in low lipid levels in overwintering monarchs but our analysis of lipid levels of monarchs collected at overwintering sites indicated that in all years most had high levels of lipids prior to winter. Clearly, a significant proportion of lipids were consistently acquired in Mexico during the last portion of the migration. Drought conditions in Oklahoma, Texas and northern Mexico in 2019 resulted in the lowest levels of lipid mass and wing loading observed in that year but with higher levels at locations southward in Mexico to the overwintering sites. Compared with 2019, lipid levels increased during the 2020 and 2021 fall migrations but were again higher during the Mexican portion of the migration than for Oklahoma and Texas samples, emphasizing a recovery of lipids as monarchs advanced toward the overwintering locations. In all 3 years, body water was highest during the Canada-USA phase of migration but then declined during the nectar foraging phase in Mexico before recovering again at the overwintering sites. The increase in mass and lipids from those in Texas to the overwintering sites in Mexico indicates that nectar availability in Mexico can compensate for poor conditions experienced further north. Our work emphasizes the need to maintain the floral and therefore nectar resources that fuel both the migration and storage of lipids throughout the entire migratory route.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad087,11,1,NA,coad087,Fuel; habitat conservation; lipid stores; nectar availability; wing loading
article,Tolerance threshold of a pelagic species in China to total dissolved gas supersaturation: from the perspective of survival characteristics and swimming ability,"Wang, Hongtao and Wang, Yuanming and Li, Kefeng and Liang, Ruifeng and Zhao, Weiyang",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Lay Summary: The experiments were conducted to evaluate the tolerance threshold to total dissolved gas supersaturation of bighead carp from the perspective of survival characteristics and swimming ability, which provides a guide for the operation of dams in the Yangtze River Basin. Total dissolved gas (TDG) supersaturation downstream of dams can occur in the Yangtze River basin and is known to cause stress and even death in fish. Consequently, it is important to establish tolerance thresholds of endemic fish to protect local aquatic resources. We conducted experiments to assess survival characteristics and swimming ability of bighead carp, an important commercial fish dwelling in the Yangtze River, to evaluate its tolerance threshold to TDG supersaturation. The typical external symptoms of gas bubble trauma (GBT) were observed and the time when the fish lost equilibrium and died were recorded. The results showed that the mortality occurred when TDG level exceeded 125\%, with obvious symptoms such as exophthalmos and bubbles on the head. The interval between loss of equilibrium and mortality decreased with an increase in TDG level. Neither exposure time nor TDG level significantly affected the critical swimming speed (Ucrit) of fish exposed to non-lethal exposure (110\%, 120\% and 125\% TDG) over a 7 day period. Significant reductions in Ucrit were found under 130\% and 135\% TDG conditions when the exposure lasted 52.0 h and 42.9 h, respectively. The Ucrit also significantly decreased after exposure of 1.6 h under 140\% TDG condition. Moreover, after exposure to 140\% TDG for 39.2 h, 135\% TDG for 56.5 h and 130\% TDG for 95.9 h, bighead carp were transferred into air saturated water to recover for 24 h or 48 h; however, swimming performance remained impaired. The results of this study indicate that 125\% TDG was the highest TDG level where limited mortality was observed and the swimming ability was not impaired, showing that 125\% TDG can be set as the tolerance threshold of this species to guide the operation of dams in the Yangtze River Basin.",2024,10.1093/conphys/coae023,12,1,NA,coae023,Critical swimming ability; gas bubble trauma; loss of equilibrium; mortality; total dissolved gas supersaturation; Yangtze River
article,The fast-food effect: costs of being a generalist in a human-dominated landscape,"Guerrero-Sanchez, Sergio and Frias, Liesbeth and Saimin, Silvester and Orozco-terWengel, Pablo and Goossens, Benoit",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"In this study, we use Varanus salvator as a model species to present the physiological implications of living in a highly anthropogenic landscape, as well as the consequences on the parasite community associated with dietary shifts. Agricultural expansion in Southeast Asia has converted most natural landscapes into mosaics of forest interspersed with plantations, dominated by the presence of generalist species that benefit from resource predictability. Dietary shifts, however, can result in metabolic alterations and the exposure of new parasites that can impact animal fitness and population survival. Our study focuses on the Asian water monitor lizard (Varanus salvator), one of the largest predators in the Asian wetlands, as a model species to understand the health consequences of living in a human-dominated landscape in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. We evaluated the effects of dietary diversity on the metabolism of monitor lizards and the impact on the composition of their parasite communities in an oil palm-dominated landscape. Our results showed that (1) rodent-dominated diets were associated with high levels of lipids, proteins and electrolytes, akin to a fast-food-based diet of little representativeness of the full nutritional requirements, but highly available, and (2) lizards feeding on diverse diets hosted more diverse parasite communities, however, at overall lower parasite prevalence. Furthermore, we observed that the effect of diet on lipid concentration differed depending on the size of individual home ranges, suggesting that sedentarism plays an important role in the accumulation of cholesterol and triglycerides. Parasite communities were also affected by a homogeneous dietary behaviour, as well as by habitat type. Dietary diversity had a negative effect on both parasite richness and prevalence in plantations, but not in forested areas. Our study indicates that human-dominated landscapes can pose a negative effect on generalist species and hints to the unforeseen health consequences for more vulnerable taxa using the same landscapes. Thus, it highlights the potential role of such a widely distributed generalist as model species to monitor physiological effects in the ecosystem in an oil palm-dominated landscape.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad055,11,1,NA,coad055,animal health; Asian water monitor lizard; blood chemistry; Borneo; diet; oil palm; parasites
article,A systematic review of approaches to assess fish health responses to anthropogenic threats in freshwater ecosystems,"Mallett, Maxwell C. and Thiem, Jason D. and Butler, Gavin L. and Kennard, Mark J.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"The mechanisms through which human modification of freshwater environments impacts individual fish health are diverse and complex. We present a systematic review of research spanning 50 years to identify impact pathways of freshwater human-induced threats and the health assessment methods that are sensitive to them. Anthropogenic threats such as water infrastructure, land-use changes, overexploitation of fishes and other biological resources, invasive species and climate change present formidable challenges to freshwater biodiversity. Historically, management of fish and fishery species has largely been based on studies of population- and community-level dynamics; however, the emerging field of conservation physiology promotes the assessment of individual fish health as a key management tool. Fish health is highly sensitive to environmental disturbances and is also a fundamental driver of fitness, with implications for population dynamics such as recruitment and resilience. However, the mechanistic links between particular anthropogenic disturbances and changes in fish health, or impact pathways, are diverse and complex. The diversity of ways in which fish health can be measured also presents a challenge for researchers deciding on methods to employ in studies seeking to understand the impact of these threats. In this review, we aim to provide an understanding of the pathway through which anthropogenic threats in freshwater ecosystems impact fish health and the ways in which fish health components impacted by anthropogenic threats can be assessed. We employ a quantitative systematic approach to a corpus of papers related to fish health in freshwater and utilize a framework that summarizes the impact pathway of anthropogenic threats through environmental alterations and impact mechanisms that cause a response in fish health. We found that land-use changes were the most prolific anthropogenic threat, with a range of different health metrics being suitable for assessing the impact of this threat. Almost all anthropogenic threats impacted fish health through two or more impact pathways. A robust understanding of the impact pathways of anthropogenic threats and the fish health metrics that are sensitive to these threats is crucial for fisheries managers seeking to undertake targeted management of freshwater ecosystems.",2024,10.1093/conphys/coae022,12,1,NA,coae022,Anthropogenic threats; conservation physiology; health indicators

Unavoidable procedures during translocations, such as habitat disturbance, capture, handling, processing, captivity, transport and release to a novel environment, have the potential to be stressful for most species. In this study, we examined acute and chronic stress (through the measurement of the glucocorticoid corticosterone) in a rare reptile (the tuatara, Sphenodon punctatus). We found that: (i) the acute corticosterone response remains elevated during the initial translocation process but is not amplified by cumulative stressors; and (ii) the long-term dynamics of corticosterone secretion are similar in translocated and source populations. Taken together, our results show that translocated tuatara are generally resistant to cumulative acute stressors and show no hormonal sign of chronic stress.

Physicochemical properties and intrinsic biological activity of medicines routinely differ from conventional organic contaminants; thus, diverging applicability domains often challenge environmental chemistry and toxicology computational tools and biological assays originally developed to address historical chemical stressors. Because pharmacology and toxicology information is more readily available for these contaminants of emerging concern than other chemicals in the environment, and many drug targets are conserved across species, leveraging mammalian drug discovery, safety testing and clinical pharmacology information appears useful to define environmental risks and to design less hazardous industrial chemicals. Research is needed to advance biological read across, which promises to reduce uncertainties during chemical assessment aimed at protecting public health and the environment.

However, research on this aspect of the Chinese pangolin, an endangered species from mainland China, was extremely limited. Therefore, the present study fills the gap in this research area by first systematically providing the sperm collection methods and the characteristics of the spermatozoa of Chinese pangolin. The Chinese pangolin (Manis pentadactyla) is a critically endangered species. However, there is a paucity of research on the male reproductive gamete biology of this species. The present study was the first to systematically analyse the sperm characterization of the Chinese pangolin, including semen collection, sperm morphometry and ultrastructure. The semen of five male Chinese pangolins was successfully collected using the electroejaculation method. CASA (computer-assisted sperm analysis) was used to assess semen quality and take images for sperm morphometric analysis. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used for sperm ultrastructure observation. The results showed that the semen of the Chinese pangolin was yellow to pale yellow in colour, viscous, with a fishy odour, and a slightly alkaline pH of between 7.7 and 7.9. The head defects were the main sperm defects; there were 13 kinds of head defects counted in this study. The total sperm length, head length, head width and tail length were 67.62 +/- 0.21 mu m, 10.47 +/- 0.06 mu m, 1.33 +/- 0.006 mu m and 57.16 +/- 0.20 mu m, respectively. SEM observed that the spermatozoa had a rod-shaped head with a distinct apical ridge, which was different from most mammals and similar to that in avians and reptiles. Interestingly, TEM found that the acrosome membrane of the Chinese pangolin had a double membrane structure rather than a multiple bi-lamellar membrane structure as reported by the previous study. Collectively, this study contributes to the development of artificial breeding efforts and assisted reproductive techniques for the Chinese pangolin, as well as providing technical support for research on germplasm conservation of this species.",2024,10.1093/conphys/coae010,12,1,NA,coae010,Chinese pangolin; sperm collection; sperm quality assessment; semen morphology
article,Evaluating the effect of dorsal muscle biopsies on adult Atlantic salmon growth and marine return rates,"Boe, Kristin and Robertson, Martha J. and Fleming, Ian A. and Power, Michael",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Increasing conservation and animal-welfare concerns have driven the development of non-lethal sampling of fish populations, with the use of muscle tissue biopsies now being routinely applied as a sampling method in the wild. Crucial to the success of non-lethal sampling, however, is an evaluation of the short- and long-term consequences of the treatment and ultimately the determination of how these may affect organism mortality and other fitness-related traits. The current study evaluated the use of a dorsal muscle biopsies on post-spawned Atlantic salmon emigrating to sea and undertaking a 2-month long-feeding migration before returning to spawn. Using mark-recapture, return rates and growth were compared between fish that were biopsied and externally tagged, and a control group tagged only with external tags. The biopsy treatment showed no lasting effects on fish as estimated from the two key fitness-related parameters. Results, therefore, suggest the technique can be more widely applied to gather information on marine migrating Atlantic salmon and other anadromous fishes that can be intercepted as they descend and ascend rivers during seasonal migrations. Coupled with modern tagging technologies, the use of biopsies may facilitate an improved understanding of movement and its consequences in terms of feeding patterns and growth.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coz099,8,NA,NA,coz099,Atlantic salmon; non-lethal biopsy; stable isotope analysis; survival; growth; feeding ecology

Multi-channel sensors were deployed and recovered from 10 ABFTs in a simulated recreational C\&R event off the west coast of Ireland. Data were recorded from 6 to 25 hours, with one ABFT (tuna X) potentially suffering mortality minutes after release. Almost all ABFTs (n = 9, including tuna X) immediately and rapidly (vertical speeds of similar to 2.0 m s(-1)) made powered descents and used 50-60\% of the available water column within 20 seconds, before commencing near-horizontal swimming similar to 60 seconds post-release. Dominant tailbeat frequency was similar to 50\% higher in the initial hours post-release and appeared to stabilize at 0.8-1.0 Hz some 5-10 hours post-release. Results also suggest different short-term behavioural responses to noteworthy variations in capture and handling procedures (injury and reduced air exposure events). Our results highlight both the immediate and longer-term effects of C\&R on ABFTs and that small variations in C\&R protocols can influence physiological and behavioural responses of species like the commercially valuable and historically over-exploited ABFT.",2022,10.1093/conphys/coac060,10,1,NA,coac060,NA

For example, individuals translocated during reinforcement programmes may not adapt to their novel host environment and may exhibit elevated chronic levels of stress hormones and/or decreasing body condition. Conversely, successful conservation actions should be associated with a lack of detrimental physiological perturbation. However, physiological references fluctuate over time and are influenced by various factors (e.g. sex, age, reproductive status). It is therefore necessary to determine the range of natural variations of the selected physiological metrics to establish useful baselines. This study focuses on endangered free-ranging Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni hermanni), where conservation actions have been preconized to prevent extinction of French mainland populations. The influence of sex and of environmental factors (site, year and season) on eight physiological parameters (e.g. body condition, corticosterone concentrations) was assessed in 82 individuals from two populations living in different habitats. Daily displacements were monitored by radio-tracking. Most parameters varied between years and seasons and exhibited contrasting sex patterns but with no or limited effect of site. By combining behavioural and physiological traits, this study provides sex-specific seasonal baselines that can be used to monitor the health status of Hermann's tortoises facing environmental threats (e.g. habitat changes) or during conservation actions (e.g. translocation). These results might also assist in selection of the appropriate season for translocation.",2016,10.1093/conphys/cow054,4,NA,NA,cow054,Body condition; corticosterone; population managment; reptile conservation; translocation methodology
article,"Influence of artificially induced light pollution on the hormone system of two common fish species, perch and roach, in a rural habitat","Bruening, Anika and Kloas, Werner and Preuer, Torsten and Hoelker, Franz",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Almost all life on earth has adapted to natural cycles of light and dark by evolving circadian and circannual rhythms to synchronize behavioural and physiological processes with the environment. Artificial light at night (ALAN) is suspected to interfere with these rhythms. In this study we examined the influence of ALAN on nocturnal melatonin and sex steroid blood concentrations and mRNA expression of gonadotropins in the pituitary of European perch (Perca fluviatilis) and roach (Rutilus rutilus). In a rural experimental setting, fish were held in net cages in drainage channels experiencing either additional ALAN of similar to 15 lx at the water surface or natural light conditions at half-moon. No differences in melatonin concentrations between ALAN and natural conditions were detected. However, blood concentration of sex steroids (17 beta-estradiol; 11-ketotestosterone) as well as mRNA expression of gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone) was reduced in both fish species. We conclude that ALAN can disturb biological rhythms in fish in urban waters. However, impacts on melatonin rhythm might have been blurred by individual differences, sampling methods and moonlight. The effect of ALAN on biomarkers of reproduction suggests a photo-labile period around the onset of gonadogenesis, including the experimental period (August).

The method targets 21 compounds of interest including glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, androgens, estrogens, progestogens, selective serotonin uptake inhibitors and an antibacterial/antifungal agent. This method is suitable for routine simultaneous determination of target compounds in killer whale faecal samples as well as validation of immunoassays for the detection and measurement of steroid hormones in faeces. The optimized method involves extraction of freeze-dried faecal material with reagent alcohol and water followed by isolation of the analytes using solid phase extraction with hydrophilic-lipophilic balance cartridges and liquid-liquid extraction with methyl tertiary-butyl ether. Reconstituted extracts were analysed by LC-MS/MS using an electrospray ionization interface. Method limit of quantification ranged from 0.06 to 45.2 ng/g in freeze-dried faecal samples. Except for sertraline, triclosan and estradiol (which was not recovered at the lowest spiked concentration), average intra- and inter-day precisions were within 10\%, and average recoveries were between 89.3\% and 129.3\%, for faecal samples spiked with 5.3, 26.7 or 133 ng/g of each analyte. The method was applied successfully to the analysis of hormones and PPCPs in whale faeces during which 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, a common intermediate in steroid biosynthesis that cross-reacts with precursors and sulphated conjugates in immunoassays, was identified and quantified in all samples.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad081,11,1,NA,coad081,Killer whale faeces; liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; steroid hormones; pharmaceuticals and personal care products

Nearly all of these studies have taken place during the open-water season, with almost no work focused on the effects of capture in the winter via ice angling. We therefore conducted a study to examine physiological disturbance and reflex impairment following capture by ice-angling in two commonly targeted species, bluegill Lepomis macrochirus and yellow perch Perca flavescens. Fish were captured from a lake in eastern Wisconsin (USA) and sampled either immediately or after being held in tanks for 0.5, 2 or 4 h. Sampling involved the assessment of reflex action mortality predictors (RAMP) and a blood biopsy that was used to measure concentrations of plasma cortisol and lactate. The capture-induced increase in plasma cortisol concentration was delayed relative to responses documented in previous experiments conducted in the summer and reached a relative high point at 4 h post-capture. Reflex impairment was highest at the first post-capture time point (0.5 h) and declined with each successive sampling (2 and 4 h) during recovery. Bluegill showed a higher magnitude stress response than yellow perch in terms of plasma cortisol and RAMP scores, but not when comparing plasma lactate. Overall, these data show that ice-angling induces a comparatively mild stress response relative to that found in previous studies of angled fish. While recovery of plasma stress indicators does not occur within 4 h, declining RAMP scores demonstrate that ice-angled bluegill and yellow perch do recover vitality following capture.",2017,10.1093/conphys/cox027,5,NA,NA,cox027,Catch-and-release; cortisol; ice fishing; lactate; RAMP; stress response

Monitoring physiological stress responses in amphibians may provide an ideal tool to assist conservationists in this regard. This study aimed to validate dermal secretions as a robust matrix for monitoring glucocorticoid alterations in an African amphibian, the edible bullfrog (Pyxicephalus edulis). Both a biological (handling) and physiological (ACTH challenge) validation were conducted to determine which of five available enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) tested is most suited for monitoring alterations in dermal glucocorticoid (dGC) concentrations. Additionally, the most optimal body region for monitoring dGC concentrations in P. edulis was identified. To confirm the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis following ACTH administration, urinary glucocorticoid metabolites (uGCM) were also quantified. The tested corticosterone EIA was the only assay able to monitor alterations in dGC concentrations following the handling event in P. edulis. Further validation during the ACTH challenge supported the corticosterone EIA in this regard. Dermal secretions collected from both the ventral and dorsal regions were suitable for monitoring dGC concentrations in both sexes. A considerable increase in uGCM concentrations following ACTH administration was found, suggesting that the dGC concentrations observed were derived from the HPI axis.

We also discuss the shared characteristics of these successes, identifying emerging themes in the discipline. Specifically, we conclude that conservation physiology: (i) goes beyond documenting change to provide solutions; (ii) offers a diversity of physiological metrics beyond glucocorticoids (stress hormones); (iii) includes approaches that are transferable among species, locations and times; (iv) simultaneously allows for human use and benefits to wildlife; and (v) is characterized by successes that can be difficult to find in the primary literature.

The present study used laboratory simulations to examine the physiological stress response of sparsely spotted stingarees (Urolophus paucimaculatus) subjected to one of four different trawl treatments, including two different trawl durations as well as ancillary stressors of either air exposure or crowding. Physiological indicators (plasma lactate, urea, potassium and glucose) and changes in white blood cell counts were measured from blood samples taken throughout a 48 h recovery period. Mortality was low throughout this study (15\% overall) and occurred only after >48 h following air exposure, crowding and 3 h trawl simulations. Plasma lactate, glucose and urea concentrations were identified as potential indicators of physiological stress, while plasma potassium and white blood cell counts were too variable to identify changes that would be expected to have biological consequences for stingarees. The characterization of the temporal profiles of physiological indicators facilitates a more accurate assessment of secondary stressors by identifying the best timing to sample stingaree blood when investigating post-capture stress physiology. High levels of lactate, increasing glucose and depressed urea were all recorded in response to air exposure following trawling, indicating that this is the primary source of stress in stingarees caught in trawling operations.

To determine the reproductive status of individual animals, blood sampling is often required despite being impractical to collect in open water. Hair as an endocrine marker has been used to less invasively assess the reproductive status of terrestrial animals. However, it is unknown whether pinniped reproductive status can be assessed from hair samples. Here, we examine testosterone levels in hair obtained from 57 male northern fur seals and used it to compare their age class and spermatogenesis during the non-breeding season off Hokkaido. We isolated testosterone from the samples using gas chromatography and measured testosterone levels using time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay. Testosterone levels in hair increased towards the breeding season. In May, testosterone levels were the highest in seals aged between 4 and 7 years, followed by those over the age of 8 years and under the age of 4 years.

This dearth of information is particularly true for freshwater ecosystems, which are already heavily impacted by anthropogenic pressures. Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) is a species of conservation and economic importance whose ecology and behaviour is well studied, making it an ideal model species. Recent investigations have demonstrated that salmon show disrupted behaviour in response to artificial light; however, it is not yet clear which physiological processes are behind the observed behavioural modifications. Here, two novel non-invasive sampling methods were used to examine the cortisol stress response of dispersing salmon fry under different artificial lighting intensities. Fish egg and embryos were reared under differing ALAN intensities and individual measures of stress were subsequently taken from dispersing fry using static sampling, whereas population-level measures were achieved using deployed passive samplers. Dispersing fry exposed to experimental confinement showed elevated cortisol levels, indicating the capacity to mount a stress response at this early stage in ontogenesis. However, only one of the two methods for sampling cortisol used in this study indicated that ALAN may act as a stressor to dispersing salmon fry. As such, a cortisol-mediated response to light was not strongly supported. Furthermore, the efficacy of the two non-invasive methodologies used in this study is, subject to further validation, indicative of them proving useful in future ecological studies.",2015,10.1093/conphys/cov051,3,NA,NA,cov051,Artificial light at night; Atlantic salmon; cortisol

L. and Lunn, Nicholas J. and Thiemann, Gregory W. and Molnar, Peter K.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Climate warming is rapidly altering Arctic ecosystems. Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) need sea ice as a platform from which to hunt seals, but increased sea-ice loss is lengthening periods when bears are without access to primary hunting habitat. During periods of food scarcity, survival depends on the energy that a bear has stored in body reserves, termed storage energy, making this a key metric in predictive models assessing climate change impacts on polar bears. Here, we developed a body composition model for polar bears that estimates storage energy while accounting for changes in storage tissue composition. We used data of dissected polar bears (n = 31) to link routinely collected field measures of total body mass and straight-line body length to the body composition of individual bears, described in terms of structural mass and two storage compartments, adipose and muscle. We then estimated the masses of metabolizable proteins and lipids within these storage compartments, giving total storage energy. We tested this multi-storage model by using it to predict changes in the lipid stores from an independent dataset of wild polar bears (n = 36) that were recaptured 8-200 days later. Using length and mass measurements, our model successfully predicted direct measurements of lipid changes via isotopic dilutions (root mean squared error of 14.5 kg). Separating storage into two compartments, and allowing the molecular composition of storage to vary, provides new avenues for quantifying energy stores of individuals across their life cycle. The multi-storage body composition model thus provides a basis for further exploring energetic costs of physiological processes that contribute to individual survival and reproductive success. Given bioenergetic models are increasingly used as a tool to predict individual fitness and population dynamics, our approach for estimating individual energy stores could be applicable to a wide range of species.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad043,11,1,NA,coad043,NA

Here, we examine whether variation in several physiological indicators reflects the balance between parental investment and survival in common murres (Uria aalge) under a wide range of foraging conditions. Blood samples were taken from adults during mid-chick rearing from 2007 to 2014 and analysed for corticosterone (CORT, stress hormone), beta-hydroxybutyrate (BUTY, lipid metabolism reflecting ongoing mass loss), and haematocrit (reflecting blood oxygen capacity). These measures, plus body mass, were related to three levels of food availability (good, intermediate, and poor years) for capelin, the main forage fish for murres in this colony. Adult body mass and chick-feeding rates were higher in good years than in poor years and heavier murres were more likely to fledge a chick than lighter birds. Contrary to prediction, BUTY levels were higher in good years than in intermediate and poor years. Murres lose body mass just after their chicks hatch and these results for BUTY suggest that mass loss may be delayed in good years. CORT levels were higher in intermediate years than in good or poor years. Higher CORT levels in intermediate years may reflect the necessity of increasing foraging effort, whereas extra effort is not needed in good years and it is unlikely to increase foraging success in poor years. Haematocrit levels were higher in poor years than in good years, a difference that may reflect either their poorer condition or increased diving requirements when food is less available. Our long-term data set provided insight into how decisions about resource allocation under different foraging conditions are relating to physiological indicators, a relationship that is relevant to understanding how seabirds may respond to changes in marine ecosystems as ocean temperatures continue to rise.",2017,10.1093/conphys/cox055,5,NA,NA,cox055,beta-hydroxybutyrate; body mass; capelin; common murres; corticosterone; foraging conditions; haematocrit; physiological indicators
article,"Sex, scarring, and stress: understanding seasonal costs in a cryptic marine mammal","Burgess, Elizabeth A. and Brown, Janine L. and Lanyon, Janet M.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"We investigated variation in adrenal activity in the dugong, a vulnerable cryptic marine mammal species, in a population inhabiting the lower thermal limit of their range. We sampled 319 live wild dugongs and examined faecal glucocorticoid (fGC) concentrations in relationship to sex, reproductive state (immature, sexually mature, or pregnant), and season, as well as associations with body condition, male-induced aggressive conspecific interactions, and environmental temperature. Physiological validations with apparently healthy and unhealthy animals indicated that fGC levels reliably reflect adrenal activation in dugongs. Glucocorticoid levels and body condition varied seasonally, with individuals expressing lowest fGC levels and an improving body condition over summer and autumn. Best body condition was observed in winter, which may have enhanced the ability of the animals to cope with thermal and nutritional challenges and helped to sustain the subsequent costs of reproduction (including mating activity in spring). Immature dugongs, especially those recently estranged from their mothers, may be particularly vulnerable to stress during winter, and also at risk of injury from adult conspecifics. During the spring mating period, mature and sexually active males with large erupted tusks had high fGC and poorer body condition compared with all dugongs, except pregnant females, in all other seasons. This finding was consistent with high levels of body scarring on adults of both sexes, resulting from agonistic behaviour by mature males. Competitive reproductive behaviour, inherent in a promiscuous mating system, may have stressful consequences for male dugongs, especially given that strenuous mating activity follows unfavourable thermal and nutritional conditions. Overall, fGC levels appear to be a good proxy for stressors in dugongs associated with season and/or temperature, intra-specific aggression, and pregnancy, but not lactation and/or maternal care. Understanding baseline fGC levels will allow wildlife managers to identify additional and/or unusual stressors that may threaten wild dugong populations.",2013,10.1093/conphys/cot014,1,1,NA,cot014,Body condition; faecal glucocorticoid; male aggression; scarring; stress; tusk injury

article,Does persistent snowpack inhibit degradation of fecal stress indicators?,"Parikh, Grace L. and Webster, Christopher R. and Vucetich, John A. and Durocher, John J. and Bump, Joseph K.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Physiological stress in wildlife can be a useful indicator of a population's response to environmental factors. By using non-invasive endocrinological techniques, such as fecal sampling, potential confounding factors associated with the stress of capture can be avoided. A potential drawback of fecal sampling, however, is degradation of samples which may produce aberrant measurements of fecal glucocorticoid metabolites. In vertebrates, glucocorticoids, such as corticosterone, become elevated in response to stress. We sought to gauge the reliability of measurement of fecal glucocorticoid metabolites from white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) fecal samples exposed to a temperate winter with substantial snow cover and cold temperatures for up to 90 days, by repeatedly subsampling fecal samples every 10 days and performing a corticosterone enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Measurements of fecal glucocorticoid metabolites at 10 days were consistent with initial measurements, after which (20 days) they became aberrant following a period of thawing. Consequently, glucocorticoid metabolite levels in feces appear to remain stable under ambient conditions if temperatures remain below freezing at least for 10 days. While it's possible that samples may remain useful beyond this time frame based on previous laboratory studies of samples stored in a freezer, further work is needed to determine how samples weather in situ under extreme cold (e.g. Arctic) or periods of partial thawing.",2018,10.1093/conphys/coy071,6,NA,NA,coy071,corticosteroids; fecal glucocorticoids; non-invasive; sample degradation; stress

Given their integrative and multifaceted aspects, markers of oxidative status have recently been considered in conservation physiology, but still need to be validated across environmental conditions and locations. Here, we examined whether inter-annual variation in two oxidative markers, plasma antioxidant capacity and plasma hydroperoxides, followed inter-annual variation in temperature anomalies and associated vegetation changes in four colonies of long-lived greater mouse-eared bats (Myotis myotis) monitored over five consecutive years. We found that the plasma antioxidant capacity of bats decreased while plasma hydroperoxide concentrations increased with increasing temperature anomalies occurring in the two weeks before blood sampling. Moreover, the antioxidant defences of these bats reflected vegetation indices, which themselves reflected the thermal conditions experienced by bats in their foraging habitat. Variation in oxidative markers therefore appears to be due to variation in thermoregulatory costs and to indirect changes in foraging costs. Overall, these results validate the use of markers of oxidative status in conservation physiology to monitor thermal perturbations recently experienced by animals in their natural habitat. However, even though oxidative markers varied in the same direction in all four bat colonies across years, the amplitude of their response differed. If these different physiological responses reflect different performances (e.g. productivity, survival rate) between colonies, this implies that, if necessary, conservation measures may need to be applied at the local scale.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa083,8,NA,NA,coaa083,Bats; biomarkers; oxidative status; temperature anomalies

Nests of secondary cavity nesters, like tits, provide a moist, warm and protected habitat for reproduction of blood parasites. Offspring fitness depends on interactions between parental care and environmental constraints. Life-history theory suggests that macro-and micro-parasites may generate selection pressures by affecting host health. In the present study, we replaced natural great tit Parus major nests in two, structurally and floristically contrasting sites (an urban parkland and a rich deciduous forest, located 10 km apart in Lodz, central Poland), with fresh, sterilized, artificial moss-cotton wool nests, twice, on the fifth and tenth day of nestlings life. We then examined haematological condition indicators (haemoglobin and glucose concentrations) of about 14-day-old nestlings. Nestlings that were developing in treated nests improved their health status in comparison with control nestlings.

Gary and Docker, Margaret F. and Isaak, Dan J. and Durhack, Travis C. and Treberg, Jason R.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"By understanding range-wide intraspecific variation in metabolic rate we can better understand how organisms have adapted to their environment. However, methods to quantify metabolic rate of fishes from remote areas or those that cannot be brought back to the laboratory because of imperilment status are lacking. Consequently, practical and reliable field-based methods are needed. To address this need, we developed a simple yet robust intermittent-flow respirometry system, adapted from a design commonly used in the laboratory that is readily suited for field use. Standard metabolic rate (SMR), maximum metabolic rate (MMR) and aerobic scope (AS) estimates were obtained from juvenile lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) using both field-and laboratory-based systems. Whole-fish SMR, MMR and AS estimates from the field and laboratory methods did not differ from one another (ANCOVA and LMM: all P > 0.05) for either species and were comparable to estimates previously reported. Our field setup is a simpler system than the conventional laboratory-based system that requires less power and equipment to operate, yet still offers users the ability to: (1) acclimate fish to the respirometry chamber; (2) measure oxygen consumption during a shorter period (1 h), which yield metabolic rate estimates comparable to systems that take measurements over longer periods; and (3) take repeated oxygen consumption measurements with manual user-defined flush and measurement phase routines. Developing practical and reliable field respirometry methods, as demonstrated here, is important if we wish to improve our ability to predict how imperiled species will respond to changes in their environment.

article,Stress hormone concentration in Rocky Mountain populations of the American pika (<i>Ochotona princeps</i>),"Wilkening, Jennifer L. and Ray, Chris and Sweazea, Karen L.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"The American pika (Ochotona princeps) is considered a sentinel species for detecting ecological effects of climate change. Pikas are declining within a large portion of their range, but previous studies have focused only on local pika extinction as a metric of change. We designed a procedure which can provide an earlier warning signal, based on non-invasive sampling and analysis of physiological stress in living pikas. Pikas were sampled at several locations in the Rocky Mountains for the measurement of glucocorticoid metabolites (GCMs) in faeces. Using a time series of faecal pellets from 12 individuals, we detected a significant increase in faecal GCM level in response to capture, thus biologically validating the use of a corticosterone enzyme immunoassay. We also established baseline, peak, and post-peak GCM concentrations for pikas in the Rocky Mountains, which varied according to gender and individual. This is the first study to measure stress hormone metabolites in any species of pika. The methods developed and validated in this study can be used to add non-invasive measurements of physiological stress to pika monitoring programmes and other research designed to assess pika vulnerability to predicted changes in climate. Pika monitoring programmes currently in place use a protocol that relates current site use by pikas with data on local habitat characteristics, such as elevation, to infer potential effects of climate change. Data generated by these monitoring studies can be used to identify the trends in site use by pikas in relationship to habitat covariates. However, this approach does not take into account the role of behavioural thermoregulation and the pika's use of microhabitats to ameliorate variations in climate. Incorporating a stress metric, such as GCM concentration, will provide relatively direct evidence for or against the hypothesis that pikas can be stressed by climate regardless of behavioural adaptations.",2013,10.1093/conphys/cot027,1,1,NA,cot027,Climate change; field endocrinology; sentinel alpine species; stress

The tundra supports nesting migratory seabirds that spend most of their year over the ocean. Migrations are demanding, but it is unclear how physiological capability may equip organisms to respond to their changing environments. For two migratory seabird species nesting in Alaska, USA, the Arctic tern (n = 10) and the long-tailed jaeger (n = 8), we compared oxidative physiology and aerobic capacity measured during incubation and we recorded individual movement paths using electronic tracking tags. Within species, we hypothesized that individuals with longer-distance migrations would show higher oxidative stress and display better aerobic capacity than shorter-distance migrants. We examined blood parameters relative to subsequent fall migration in jaegers and relative to previous spring migration in terns. We present the first measurements of oxidative stress in these species and the first migratory movements of long-tailed jaegers in the Pacific Ocean. Arctic terns displayed positive correlation of oxidative variables, or better integration than jaegers. Relative to physiological sampling, pre-breeding northward migration data were available for terns and post-breeding southward data were available for jaegers. Terns reached a farther maximum distance from the colony than jaegers (16 199 \& PLUSMN; 275 km versus 10 947 \& PLUSMN; 950 km) and rate of travel northward (447 \& PLUSMN; 41.8 km/day) was positively correlated with hematocrit, but we found no other relationships. In jaegers, there were no relationships between individuals' physiology and southward rate of travel (193 \& PLUSMN; 52.3 km/day) or migratory distance. While it is not clear whether the much longer migrations of the terns is related to their better integration, or to another factor, our results spark hypotheses that could be evaluated through a controlled phylogenetic study. Species with better integration may be less susceptible to environmental factors that increase oxidative stress, including thermal challenges or changes in prey distribution as the Arctic climate changes rapidly.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad060,11,1,NA,coad060,migration; oxidative stress; seabirds

Knowledge of growth and metabolic rates of non-native fishes at various food levels is particularly critical to inform models that assess their invasion potential.

All fish survived the entire duration of the experiment (4 months) regardless of ration level. Blue catfish exhibited routine metabolic rates similar to those of other benthic fishes but below the more active species. Mean growth rates were lower at reduced ration levels, but we found no evidence of ration size effect on body condition or metabolic rates. Blue catfish therefore appear to have mechanisms that enable them to survive low rates of food intake for long periods, indicating the potential of this invasive species to become established in habitats with low prey availability.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coaa129,9,NA,NA,coaa129,Blue catfish; Chesapeake Bay; food limitation; invasive species; metabolic rate

Fish can manage natural fluctuations in temperature; however, in freshwater ecosystems acute and rapid temperature changes can originate from sources such as large dams and industrial effluents. These rapid temperature changes may induce several physiological and behavioural responses that can result in lethal and sub-lethal consequences. The present study assessed immediate sublethal and short-term (10 days) lethal responses of three species of Australian freshwater fish larvae and early-stage juveniles to a range of different `field-relevant' cold shocks (-4, -6, -8 and -10 degrees C). Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii), silver perch (Bidyanus bidyanus) andgolden perch (Macquariaambigua) were tested at two age groups to elucidate the interaction between ontogeny and sensitivity to cold shock. Cold shock caused mortality and reductions in swimming ability (time to exhaustion and lines crossed) in all species of fish at both age groups. Sensitivity was correlated to the magnitude of cold shock; a 10 degrees C drop in temperature caused the highest mortalities. Ontogeny interacted with the severity of cold shock; the younger fish experienced higher mortalities and greater impairment to swimming ability. This study demonstrates the potential lethal and sub-lethal impacts of cold shock on freshwater fish at a critical life-history stage. Understanding the impacts of cold shock will aid management of freshwater ecosystems for the benefit of fish populations, with the current study identifying critical life stages to be considered in remediation and guiding thresholds necessary to reduce the impact of cold shock on native fish populations.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa092,8,NA,NA,coaa092,Cold shock; freshwater fish; ontogeny; temperature

El Nino and climatic anomalies between 2013 and 2016 had major ecological impacts on the California Current ecosystem. As top marine predators, California sea lions (CSL) experienced decreased prey availability and foraging success, impacting their nutritional state. We hypothesize that chronic stress to juvenile CSL increased during the 2015-2016 El Nino and that breeding represents a period of chronic stress for adults, which impact a variety of physiological processes. We opportunistically captured and sampled juvenile CSL (female, n=29; male, n=38) in central California and adult male CSL (n=76) in Astoria, Oregon and quantified a suite of analytes in serum as indicators of acute stress markers, metabolism and thyroid function, and adaptive immune response. We found that stress hormones and glucose were decreased in juvenile CSL during 2016 relative to 2015 and in adult male CSL after the breeding season, which may indicate chronic stress downregulating HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) axis sensitivity with associated metabolic impacts. Conversely, thyroid hormones for both juvenile and adult male CSL were increased, suggesting greater energetic requirements resulting from increased foraging activity during suboptimal conditions in juveniles and breeding tenure in adult males. Immunoglobulin IgG was elevated in juveniles in 2016 but reduced in adult males post-breeding. This suggests that juveniles may face immunostimulatory pressure during anomalously warm ocean environments; however, for adult males, breeding is a significant energetic cost resulting in reductions to immune function.

Many of these species face numerous anthropogenic and environmental disturbances. Despite its importance as a critical form of mortality, little is known about disease progression in air-breathing marine megafauna at sea. We examined the movement, diving, foraging behaviour and physiological state of an adult female northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) who suffered from an infection while at sea. Comparing her to healthy individuals, we identified abnormal behavioural patterns from high-resolution biologging instruments that are likely indicators of diseased and deteriorating condition. We observed continuous extended (3-30 minutes) surface intervals coinciding with almost no foraging attempts (jaw motion) during 2 weeks of acute illness early in her post-breeding foraging trip. Elephant seals typically spend similar to 2 minutes at the surface. There were less frequent but highly extended (30-200 minutes) surface periods across the remainder of the trip. Dive duration declined throughout the trip rather than increasing. This seal returned in the poorest body condition recorded for an adult female elephant seal (18.3\% adipose tissue; post-breeding trip average is 30.4\%). She was immunocompromised at the end of her foraging trip and has not been seen since that moulting season. The timing and severity of the illness, which began during the end of the energy-intensive lactation fast, forced this animal over a tipping point from which she could not recover. Additional physiological constraints to foraging, including thermoregulation and oxygen consumption, likely exacerbated her already poor condition.

Loren and Valentinuzzi, Veronica S. and Oda, Gisele A.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"While most studies of the impacts of climate change have investigated shifts in the spatial distribution of organisms, temporal shifts in the time of activity is another important adjustment made by animals in a changing world. Due to the importance of light and temperature cycles in shaping activity patterns, studies of activity patterns of organisms that inhabit extreme environments with respect to the 24-hour cyclicity of Earth have the potential to provide important insights into the interrelationships among abiotic variables, behaviour and physiology. Our previous laboratory studies with Argentinean tuco-tucos from the Monte desert (Ctenomys aff. knighti) show that these subterranean rodents display circadian activity/rest rhythms that can be synchronized by artificial light/dark cycles. Direct observations indicate that tuco-tucos emerge mainly for foraging and for removal of soil from their burrows. Here we used bio-logging devices for individual, long-term recording of daily activity/rest (accelerometry) and time on surface (light-loggers) of six tuco-tucos maintained in outdoor semi-natural enclosures. Environmental variables were measured simultaneously. Activity bouts were detected both during day and night but 77\% of the highest values happened during the daytime and 47\% of them coincided with time on surface. Statistical analyses indicate time of day and temperature as the main environmental factors modulating time on surface. In this context, the total duration that these subterranean animals spent on surface was high during the winter, averaging 3 h per day and time on surface occurred when underground temperature was lowest. Finally, transport of these animals to the indoor laboratory and subsequent assessment of their activity rhythms under constant darkness revealed a switch in the timing of activity.

We investigated the effect of storage temperature on the viability and physiological integrity of Pinus densiflora seeds after a 20-year storage. Our findings will provide valuable insights for seed conservation strategies. Storage temperature is one of the most important factors determining seed longevity in the genebank. This study aimed to investigate the effect of storage temperature on the seed viability and physiological integrity after a 20-year storage period of Pinus densiflora, a tree species of ecological and economic significance in South Korea. To this end, seeds were collected and stored dry for 20 years at -18 degrees C, 4 degrees C and 25 degrees C. Germination tests were conducted to assess seed viability and vigour, electrolyte leakage analysis was performed to assess cell membrane integrity, and carbohydrate analysis was conducted to assess metabolic integrity during germination. The results revealed that over 20 years, seeds stored at -18 degrees C maintained a high germination percentage (GP; 89\%), comparable to initial GP (91\%), whilst those stored at 4 degrees C exhibited a decline in GP (44\%) along with a decrease in vigour. Seeds stored at 25 degrees C lost their viability entirely. Electrical conductivity of the leachate and leakage of inorganic compounds and soluble sugars were higher with elevated storage temperature, indicating increased imbibition damage. Additionally, changes in carbohydrate content during germination revealed that the loss of viability according to storage temperature is associated with reduced storage reserve utilization and altered carbohydrate metabolism during germination. These results enhance our understanding of the effect of seed storage temperature on longevity and physiological changes of aging in the genebank, serving as a reference for establishing conservation strategies for Pinus densiflora.",2024,10.1093/conphys/coae046,12,1,NA,coae046,Carbohydrate metabolism; electrolyte leakage; Pinus seed; seed aging; seed storage; storage temperature

Recognizing that such information is essential to effectively using skin samples within marine mammal stress research, the primary goals of this study were to (i) expand on the number of steroid hormones proved quantifiable in the cetacean skin matrix and (ii) validate the use of cetacean skin as a matrix for measuring stress-related hormones. Five adult bottlenose dolphins were subjected to an out of water stress test. Non-invasive sloughed skin samples were collected from each dolphin: once similar to 3 and once similar to 1 week prior to the stress test; at the time of the stress test; and twice weekly for 11 to 17 weeks subsequent to the stress test. LCMS/MS analysis of the samples recovered consistent data on three corticosteroids (cortisol, aldosterone, corticosterone), two androgens (testosterone, DHEA) and one progestagen (progesterone). A range of other hormones were also quantifiable, although not consistently so across samples. Results demonstrated that the hormonal response to an acute stressor could be detected in skin: the time from stress test to skin cortisol peak was an average of 46 days, whereas it was 55 days for corticosterone and 47 days for aldosterone. Results also showed that baseline hormonal concentrations were obtainable from skin samples collected during or immediately after the animals were subjected to the acute stressor. This study further develops and validates a non-invasive method for measuring cortisol and other hormones related to stress, health, and reproduction in the skin of cetaceans, potentially supporting investigations of acute and chronic stress, such as cetacean endocrine responses to distinct (e.g. naval sonar exposure) or prolonged stressors (e.g. shipping noise).",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa032,8,NA,NA,coaa032,Aldosterone; cetacean; corticosterone; cortisol; DHEA; progesterone; skin; steroid hormones; Stress test; testosterone
article,Haematology and plasma biochemistry reference intervals for the critically endangered western Santa Cruz Galapagos tortoise (<i>Chelonoidis porteri</i>),"Nieto-Claudin, Ainoa and Palmer, Jamie L. and Esperon, Fernando and Deem, Sharon L.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Reference intervals (RIs) are an increasingly valuable tool for monitoring captive and free-living wildlife populations. Galapagos tortoises are one of the most emblematic species on Earth with 9 of the 12 extant species considered endangered due to human activities. As part of a long-term health assessment within the Galapagos Tortoise Movement Ecology Programme, we sampled a total of 210 free-living Santa Cruz Galapagos tortoises (Chelonoidis porteri). We collected blood from the brachial vein and performed packed cell volume (PCV), total solids (TS), morphological evaluation, white blood cell (WBC) count estimates and differentials and a VetScan biochemistry panel for each individual. We calculated 95\% RIs and 90\% confidence intervals (CIs) using the Reference Value Advisor tool and following international standard guidelines. Tortoises were categorized by estimated age and sex, with RI and CI reported here for 164 adult tortoises and 46 sub-adult tortoises. We found significant differences between sexes, with adult females presenting a lower PCV and higher values for both calcium and potassium. Among age groups, adult tortoises presented higher PCV, TS and albumin and lower WBC counts, aspartate aminotransferase and creatine kinase than sub-adult tortoises. We also found that tortoises presented higher numbers of lymphocytes during the dry season, but higher basophils, eosinophils, phosphorus, potassium and TS during the humid season. The heterophil:lymphocyte ratio did not differ between groups. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of formal plasma biochemistry and haematology RI for free-living Galapagos tortoises. With the present study we provide an important diagnostic tool for captive-breeding programs in the Galapagos and zoological institutions globally that care for giant tortoises. The ultimate goal of this study is to contribute to the understanding of giant tortoise baseline health parameters and to inform local management decisions that help to conserve these emblematic species.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab019,9,NA,NA,coab019,Baseline; giant tortoises; health; reference values; wildlife surveillance

C. and Cooke, S. J. and Patterson, D. A. and Hinch, S. G.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Simple vitality indicators are being used to assess fish health and condition following fisheries interactions. These indicators have been determined to be predictive of post-release survival for a number of taxa. There is much promise for the widespread application of these simple but effective tools. Estimating the survival probability of animals released from fisheries can improve the overall understanding of animal biology with implications for fisheries management, conservation and animal welfare. Vitality indicators are simple visual measures of animal condition that change in response to stressors (like fisheries capture) and can be assessed to predict post-release survival. These indicators typically include immediate reflex responses which are typically combined into a score. Vitality indicators are straight-forward and non-invasive metrics that allow users to quantify how close (or far) an animal is from a normal, `healthy' or baseline state, which in turn can be correlated with outcomes such as survival probability, given appropriate calibration. The literature on using vitality indicators to predict post-release survival of animals has grown rapidly over the past decade. We identified 136 papers that used vitality indicators in a fisheries context. These studies were primarily focused on marine and freshwater fishes, with a few examples using herptiles and crustaceans. The types of vitality indicators are diverse and sometimes taxa-specific (e.g. pinching leg of turtles, spraying water at nictitating membrane of sharks) with the most commonly used indicators being those that assess escape response or righting response given the vulnerability of animals when those reflexes are impaired. By presenting Pacific salmon fisheries as a case study, we propose a framework for using vitality indicators to predict survival across taxa and fisheries.",2024,10.1093/conphys/coae034,12,1,NA,coae034,Bycatch; catch and release; fisheries; mortality; reflex indicators
article,Limited efficacy of a commercial microbial inoculant for improving growth and physiological performance of native plant species,"Wong, Wei San and Ruscalleda-Alvarez, Jaume and Yong, Jean W. H. and Stevens, Jason C. and Valliere, Justin M. and Veneklaas, Erik J.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"The efficacy of a commercial microbial inoculant for improving the performance of 10 Western Australian woodland plant species was evaluated. Across all investigated species, inoculation had small effects on plant growth. Within each species, inoculation did not result in significant biomass gain, and effects on nitrogen nutrition and photosynthesis were variable and minimal. Soil microbial inoculants are increasingly being explored as means to improve soil conditions to facilitate ecological restoration. In southwestern Western Australia, highly biodiverse Banksia woodland plant communities are increasingly threatened by various factors including climate change, land development and mining. Banksia woodland restoration is necessary to conserve this plant community. The use of microbial inoculation in Banksia woodland restoration has not yet been investigated. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of a commercial microbial inoculant (GOGO Juice, Neutrog Australia Pty Ltd) for improving the performance of 10 ecologically diverse Banksia woodland plant species in a pot experiment. Plants were subjected to one of two watering regimes (well-watered and drought) in combination with microbial inoculation treatments (non-inoculated and inoculated). Plants were maintained under these two watering treatments for 10 weeks, at which point plants in all treatments were subjected to a final drought period lasting 8 weeks. Plant performance was evaluated by plant biomass and allocation, gas exchange parameters, foliar carbon and nitrogen and stable isotope (delta 15N and delta 13C) compositions. Plant xylem sap phytohormones were analysed to investigate the effect of microbial inoculation on plant phytohormone profiles and potential relationships with other observed physiological parameters. Across all investigated plant species, inoculation treatments had small effects on plant growth. Further analysis within each species revealed that inoculation treatments did not result in significant biomass gain under well-watered or drought-stressed conditions, and effects on nitrogen nutrition and photosynthesis were variable and minimal. This suggests that the selected commercial microbial inoculant had limited benefits for the tested plant species. Further investigations on the compatibility between the microorganisms (present in the inoculant) and plants, timing of inoculation, viability of the microorganisms and concentration(s) required to achieve effectiveness, under controlled conditions, and field trials are required to test the feasibility and efficacy in actual restoration environments.",2024,10.1093/conphys/coae037,12,1,NA,coae037,Banksia woodlands; microbial inoculation; mine site restoration; phytohormones; xylem sap
article,"Normalized difference vegetation index, temperature and age affect faecal thyroid hormone concentrations in free-ranging African elephants","Szott, Isabelle D. and Pretorius, Yolanda and Ganswindt, Andre and Koyama, Nicola F.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Conservation biologists can use hormone measurements to assess animals' welfare, reproductive state, susceptibility to stressors, as well as energy expenditure. Quantifying hormone concentrations from faecal samples is particularly advantageous as samples can be collected without disturbing animals' behaviour. In order for an endocrine marker to be useful for wildlife managers, we need to understand how extrinsic and intrinsic factors affect hormone concentrations in free-ranging animal populations. Thyroid hormones are linked to basal metabolic rate and energy expenditure. Previous research demonstrated that triiodothyronine (T3) can be measured successfully in faecal matter of African elephants, Loxodonta africana. However, to our knowledge, research into factors affecting changes in elephant T3 levels has only been carried out in captive elephants so far. Thus, we present the first study of faecal T3 metabolite (mT3) concentrations of a large population of free-ranging African elephants. Over 15 months, we collected faecal samples from identified (n = 43 samples) and unidentified (n = 145 samples) individuals in Madikwe Game Reserve, South Africa. We investigated whether vegetative productivity {[}normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)] in interaction with mean monthly temperature, age and sex affected mT3 concentrations. We found a significant negative interaction effect of NDVI and temperature. Increasing NDVI was related to higher concentrations of mT3, but increasing temperature was related to a decrease in mT3 concentrations in individually identified and unidentified elephants. In unidentified individuals, juvenile elephants had significantly higher mT3 concentrations compared to adult elephants. Faecal T3 can successfully be quantified in samples from free-ranging elephant populations and thus provides insight into energy expenditure in large herbivores.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa010,8,1,NA,coaa010,Animal welfare; conservation; endocrine marker; Loxodonta africana; non-invasive hormone monitoring
article,"Influence of sea ice concentration, sex and chick age on foraging flexibility and success in an Arctic seabird","Eby, Alyssa and Patterson, Allison and Whelan, Shannon and Elliott, Kyle H. and Gilchrist, H. Grant and Love, Oliver P.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Thick-billed murres from a low Arctic colony adjusted foraging behaviour in response to environmental conditions only during incubation. Whereas chick-rearing behaviour and foraging success were impacted by chick age and sex, reflecting the high costs of chick demand and sex-specific differences in parental care. Declining sea ice and increased variability in sea ice dynamics are altering Arctic marine food webs. Changes in sea ice dynamics and prey availability are likely to impact pagophilic (ice-dependent and ice-associated) species, such as thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia), through changes in foraging behaviour and foraging success. At the same time, extrinsic factors, such as chick demand, and intrinsic factors, such as sex, are also likely to influence foraging behaviour and foraging success of adult murres. Here, we use 3 years of data (2017-2019) to examine the impacts of environmental conditions (sea ice concentration and sea surface temperature), sex and chick age (as a proxy for chick demand) on foraging and diving behaviour (measured via biologgers), energy expenditure (estimated from activity budgets) and foraging success (measured via nutritional biomarkers) of thick-billed murres during the incubation and chick-rearing stages at Coats Island, Nunavut. Murres only exhibited foraging flexibility to environmental conditions during incubation, which is also the only stage when ice was present. When more ice was present, foraging effort increased, murres foraged farther and made deeper dives, where murres making deeper dives had higher foraging success (greater relative change in mass). During incubation, murre behaviour was also influenced by sex of the individual, where males made more and shorter trips and more dives. During chick-rearing, murre behaviour was influenced primarily by the sex of the individual and chick age. Males made shallower dives and fewer dive bouts per day, and more dives. Birds made longer, deeper dives as chicks aged, likely representing increased intra-specific competition for prey throughout the season. Our results suggest variation in sea ice concentration does impact foraging success of murres; however, sex-specific foraging strategies may help buffer colony breeding success from variability in sea ice concentration.",2024,10.1093/conphys/coae057,12,1,NA,coae057,Climate change; diving behaviour; environmental variability; foraging behaviour; nutritional biomarkers; thick-billed murre

For example, physiology is one of several key determinants of an organism's ecological niche (along with evolutionary constraints and ecological interactions). The fundamental role of physiology in niche determination led to the development of the field of physiological ecology. This approach considers physiological mechanisms in the context of the environment to understand mechanistic variations that beget ecological trends. Physiological ecology, as an integrative discipline, has recently experienced a resurgence with respect to conservation applications, largely in conjunction with technological advances that extended physiological work from the lab into the natural world. This is of critical importance for species such as elasmobranchs (sharks, skates and rays), which are an especially understudied and threatened group of vertebrates. In 2017, at the American Elasmobranch Society meeting in Austin, Texas, the symposium entitled `Applications of Physiological Ecology in Elasmobranch Research' provided a platform for researchers to showcase work in which ecological questions were examined through a physiological lens. Here, we highlight the research presented at this symposium, which emphasized the strength of linking physiological tools with ecological questions.

article,Faecal corticosterone metabolite concentrations are not a good predictor of habitat suitability for common gartersnakes,"Halliday, William D. and Gilmour, Kathleen M. and Blouin-Demers, Gabriel",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Measuring habitat suitability is important in conservation and in wildlife management. Measuring the abundance or presence-absence of a species in various habitats is not sufficient to measure habitat suitability because these metrics can be poor predictors of population success. Therefore, having some measure of population success is essential in assessing habitat suitability, but estimating population success is difficult. Identifying suitable proxies for population success could thus be beneficial. We examined whether faecal corticosterone metabolite (fCM) concentrations could be used as a proxy for habitat suitability in common gartersnakes (Thamnophis sirtalis). We conducted a validation study and confirmed that fCM concentrations indeed reflect circulating corticosterone concentrations. We estimated abundance, reproductive output and growth rate of gartersnakes in field and in forest habitat and we also measured fCM concentrations of gartersnakes from these same habitats. Common gartersnakes were more abundant and had higher reproductive outputs and higher growth rates in field habitat than in forest habitat, but fCM concentrations did not differ between the same two habitats. Our results suggest either that fCM concentrations are not a useful metric of habitat suitability in common gartersnakes or that the difference in suitability between the two habitats was too small to induce changes in fCM concentrations. Incorporating fitness metrics in estimates of habitat suitability is important, but these metrics of fitness have to be sensitive enough to vary between habitats.",2015,10.1093/conphys/cov047,3,NA,NA,cov047,Fitness; habitat quality; habitat selection; reproductive output; stress physiology; Thamnophis sirtalis

However, direct evidence for early-life olfactory imprinting is largely limited to Pacific salmon, and other species suspected to imprint show life history traits and reproductive strategies that raise uncertainty about the generality of the salmonid-based conceptual model of olfactory imprinting in fishes. Here, we studied early-life olfactory imprinting in lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), which have a life cycle notably different from Pacific salmon, but are nonetheless hypothesized to home via similar mechanisms. We tested one critical prediction of the hypothesis that early-life olfactory imprinting guides natal homing in lake sturgeon: that exposure to odorants during early-life stages results in increased activity when exposed to those odorants later in life. Lake sturgeon were exposed to artificial odorants (phenethyl alcohol and morpholine) during specific developmental windows and durations (limited to the egg, free-embryo, exogenous feeding larvae and juvenile stages), and later tested as juveniles for behavioral responses to the odorants that were demonstrative of olfactory memory. Experiments revealed that lake sturgeon reared in stream water mixed with artificial odorants for as little as 7 days responded to the odorants in behavioral assays over 50 days after the initial exposure, specifically implicating the free-embryo and larval stages as critical imprinting periods. Our study provides evidence for olfactory imprinting in a non-salmonid fish species, and supports further consideration of conservation tactics such as stream-side rearing facilities that are designed to encourage olfactory imprinting to targeted streams during early life stages. Continued research on lake sturgeon can contribute to a model of olfactory imprinting that is more generalizable across diverse fish species and will inform conservation actions for one of the world's most imperiled fish taxonomic groups.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad045,11,1,NA,coad045,odorants; lake sturgeon; imprinting; behavioral response
article,Resource and seasonality drive interspecific variability in simulations from a dynamic energy budget model,"Marino, Joany and Dufour, Suzanne C. and Hurford, Amy and Recapet, Charlotte",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Animals show a vast array of phenotypic traits in time and space. Such variation patterns have traditionally been described as ecogeographical rules; for example, the tendency of size and clutch size to increase with latitude (Bergmann's and Lack's rules, respectively). Despite considerable research into these variation patterns and their consequences for biodiversity and conservation, the processes behind trait variation remain controversial. Here, we show how food variability, largely set by climate and weather, can drive interspecific trait variation by determining individual energy input and allocation trade-offs. Using a dynamic energy budget (DEB) model, we simulated different food environments, as well as interspecific variability in the parameters for energy assimilation, mobilization and allocation to soma. We found that interspecific variability is greater when the resource is non-limiting in both constant and seasonal environments. Our findings further show that individuals can reach larger biomass and greater reproductive output in a seasonal environment than in a constant environment of equal average resource due to the peaks of food surplus. Our results agree with the classical patterns of interspecific trait variation and provide a mechanistic understanding that supports recent hypotheses which explain them: the resource and the eNPP (net primary production during the growing season) rules. Due to the current alterations to ecosystems and communities, disentangling the mechanisms of trait variation is increasingly important to understand and predict biodiversity dynamics under climate change, as well as to improve conservation strategies. Animal diversity is reflected not only in species numbers but can also include variability in size and fecundity, which the organism's environment can shape.

In Australia, the species is targeted by recreational anglers only, under the assumption that most of the sharks are released and populations remain minimally impacted. If released sharks do not survive, the current management strategy will need to be revised. Shortfin mako sharks are commonly subjected to lengthy angling events; however, their endothermic physiology may provide an advantage over ectothermic fishes when recovering from exercise. This study assessed the post-release survival of recreationally caught shortfin mako sharks using Survivorship Pop-up Archival Transmitting (sPAT) tags and examined physiological indicators of capture stress from blood samples as well as any injuries that may be caused by hook selection. Survival estimates were based on 30 shortfin mako sharks captured off the southeastern coast of Australia. Three mortalities were observed over the duration of the study, yielding an overall survival rate of 90\%. All mortalities occurred in sharks angled for < 30 min. Sharks experienced increasing plasma lactate with longer fight times and higher sea surface temperatures (SSTs), increased plasma glucose at higher SSTs and depressed expression of heat shock protein 70 and beta-hydroxybutyrate at higher SSTs. Long fight times did not impact survival. Circle hooks significantly reduced foul hooking when compared with J hooks. Under the conditions of this study, we found that physical injury associated with hook choice is likely to have contributed to an increased likelihood of mortality, whereas the high aerobic scope associated with the species' endothermy probably enabled it to cope with long fight times and the associated physiological responses to capture.",2015,10.1093/conphys/cov044,3,NA,NA,cov044,Catch-and-release fishing; endothermy; mako shark; post-release survival; stress physiology

For fish that are severely impaired, it may be desirable to attempt revival prior to release to reduce the likelihood of post-release mortality. In this study, male sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) undergoing their upriver migration were used to examine short-term physiological changes during the following three revival treatments after beach seine capture and air exposure: a pump-powered recovery box that provided ram ventilation at one of two water flow rates; and a cylindrical, in-river recovery bag, which ensured that fish were oriented into the river flow. Beach seine capture followed by a 3 min air exposure resulted in severe impairment of reflexes such that fish could not maintain positive orientation or properly ventilate. All three revival treatments resulted in significant reductions in reflex impairment within 15 min, with full recovery of reflex responses observed within 60-120 min. For most variables measured, including plasma lactate, cortisol and osmolality, there were no significant differences among revival treatments. There was some evidence for impaired recovery in the low-flow recovery box, in the form of higher haematocrit and plasma sodium. These data mirror published recovery profiles for a recovery box study in the marine environment where a survival benefit occurred, suggesting that the methods tested here are viable options for reviving salmon caught in freshwater. Importantly, with most of the benefit to animal vitality accrued in the first 15 min, prolonging recovery when fish become vigorous may not provide added benefit because the confinement itself is likely to serve as a stressor.",2015,10.1093/conphys/cov015,3,NA,NA,cov015,Bycatch; catch and release; discards; exhaustive exercise; post-release mortality; stress response

Marine mammals such as bearded (Erignathus barbatus) and ringed (Pusa hispida) seals, which use sea ice for pupping, molting and resting, may be negatively affected. Claws from bearded and ringed seals store up to 14 and 12 years of sequential analyte data, respectively. These data can be used to compare reproduction, stress and diet across decades. In this study, we compare progesterone, cortisol and carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes in female bearded and ringed seals during 1953-1968 (pre-1968, a period prior to sea ice decline) to 1998-2014 (post-1998, a period during sea ice decline). When comparing these periods, bearded seals had statistically higher cortisol concentrations post-1998, and for both species delta C-13 was more negative post-1998, while progesterone and delta N-15 did not change. There was a positive relationship between progesterone and cortisol Z-scores for both species, except for ringed seals post-1998. There was a negative relationship between cortisol Z-scores and delta C-13 for bearded seals evident in post-1998 indicating that higher cortisol Z-scores are associated with more negative delta C-13 in bearded seals in recent years. This negative relationship between cortisol and delta C-13 in bearded seals suggests a shift to higher prey diversity, possibly due to changes in sea ice in the Pacific Arctic evident post 1998. Progesterone Z-scores corresponded to expected differences among non-pregnant, unimplanted, implanted and post-partum individuals. Using these data, pregnancy history was determined for reproductive years for each individual female sampled, which could allow for yearly pregnancy rates to be calculated given a large enough representative sample of the population.

An open-flow respirometry system was used to measure the resting metabolic rate (RMR) and the daily energy expenditure (DEE) of Chinese pangolins (Manis pentadactyla), and the dietary digestive energy was measured. The average RMR in Chinese pangolins was 3.23 ml O-2 kg(-1) min(-1) at an ambient temperature (T-a) of 24.5-30 \& DEG;C, which was only 73.0\% of the expected value based on body mass (BM). The average DEE values were 744.9 kJ day(-1) in animals with BM >3 kg and 597.3 kJ day(-1) in those with BM <3 kg, which were only 52.4\% and 60.6\% of the predicted values, respectively. The RMR and DEE levels of the Chinese pangolin were lower than those of similar-sized eutherian mammals and close to those of anteaters. These characteristics suggest that the Chinese pangolin has a low demand for energy in its diet. Although metabolic level data alone cannot be used to calculate the energy requirements of each Chinese pangolin, we believe they can provide a tangible reference for the relocation of Chinese pangolins. These results provide a scientific basis for future research on the physiology and ecology of endangered wildlife such as the Chinese pangolin.

Employing a space-for-time approach, we used normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a measure of forage quality, combined with spatially explicit proxies of human disturbance across areas of different protection management strategies in the Serengeti ecosystem. We collected 639 faecal samples, spread over 4 years, including both wet and dry seasons. Impala FGM levels increased significantly with declining NDVI and, to a lesser extent, with increasing proxies for human disturbance. However, we found no interaction between the two, such that impala had elevated FGM levels with low NDVI and low FGM levels with high NDVI regardless of human disturbance levels. This implies that impala will have high FGM levels if forage quality is poor, even with significant protection and reduced human disturbance.

This paper discusses the relevance of what level assumptions are made on, and the subsequent impact on interpreting the animal (top-down or bottom-up). The alternative DEB model has maintenance scaling with body area, and assimilation with body volume-the opposite of the conventional energy budget animal. Likewise, scaling of organism function to body mass is emphasized to take into account the different challenges organisms face when growing in size. It is emphasized that homoeostasis and its challenges are continuously changing, and cannot be assumed constant.

We investigated the effect of diving behaviour, diet and season on field metabolic rates (FMR) and foraging success of lactating northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) from the Pribil of Islands during a period of population decline. Variation in at-sea FMR was in part explained by season and trip duration, with values that ranged from 5.18 to 9.68 W kg(-1) (n = 48). Fur seals experienced a 7.2\% increase in at-sea FMR from summer to fall and a 1.9\% decrease in at-sea FMR for each additional day spent at sea. There was no effect of foraging effort, dive depth or diet on at-sea FMR. Mass gains increased with trip duration and were greater in the fall compared with summer, but were unrelated to at-sea FMR, diving behaviour and diet. Seasonal increases in at-sea FMR may have been due to costs associated with the annual molt but did not appear to adversely impact the ability of females to gain mass on foraging trips. The overall high metabolic rates in conjunction with the lack of any diet-related effects on atsea FMR suggests that northern fur seals may have reached a metabolic ceiling early in the population decline. This provides indirect evidence that food limitation may be contributing to the low pup growth rates observed in the Pribilof Islands, as a high metabolic overhead likely results in less available energy for lactation. The limited ability of female fur seals to cope with changes in prey availability through physiological mechanisms is particularly concerning given the recent and unprecedented environmental changes in the Bering Sea that are predicted to have ecosystem-level impacts.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz103,7,NA,NA,coz103,Doubly labelled water; northern fur seal; otariid; Pribilofs; metabolic rate

Understanding relationships between body condition and migratory performance can help illuminate the challenges and vulnerabilities of migratory species. Juvenile anadromous sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) may migrate over 1000 km from their freshwater nursery habitats to estuary and ocean feeding grounds. During the period corresponding to the seaward migration of sockeye salmon, we held smolts in the laboratory to ask the following: (i) Does non-feeding migration duration influence prolonged swim performance and survival? (ii) What are the relationships between individual body condition and swim performance and survival? Wild sockeye salmon were intercepted during their migration and held without food for up to 61 days to represent the non-feeding freshwater migration and the extremes of poor estuary habitat. We conducted 40 sets of prolonged swim trials on 319 fish from 3 treatment groups that represented entrance to the marine environment on (i) an average,(ii) a delayed and (iii) a severely delayed migration schedule. Experimentally controlled freshwater migration duration did not impact swim performance or survival. Swim performance decreased concomitant with condition factor, where smolts with a Fulton's condition factor of <0.69 were less likely (<50\% probability) to complete the swim test (90 min swim test, at similar to 0.50 m/s). Survival of salmon smolts in the laboratory was less likely at energy densities of less than 3.47 MJ/kg. Swim performance decreased much sooner than survival, suggesting that swim performance, and therefore condition factor, may be a good indicator of survival of migratory smolts, as fish with reduced swim performance will likely be predated. These two relationships, one more ecologically relevant and one more clinical, help reveal the limits of long-distance migration for juvenile salmon and can be used to determine population-specific starvation risk associated with various freshwater and marine habitat conditions.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab014,9,NA,NA,coab014,Carryover effects; condition factor; energy density; migration; sockeye salmon; survival; swim performance
article,Assessments at multiple levels of biological organization allow for an integrative determination of physiological tolerances to turbidity in an endangered fish species,"Hasenbein, Matthias and Fangue, Nann A. and Geist, Juergen and Komoroske, Lisa M. and Truong, Jennifer and McPherson, Rina and Connon, Richard E.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Turbidity can influence trophic levels by altering species composition and can potentially affect fish feeding strategies and predator-prey interactions. The estuarine turbidity maximum, described as an area of increased suspended particles, phytoplankton and zooplankton, generally represents a zone with higher turbidity and enhanced food sources important for successful feeding and growth in many fish species. The delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) is an endangered, pelagic fish species endemic to the San Francisco Estuary and Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, USA, where it is associated with turbid waters. Turbidity is known to play an important role for the completion of the species' life cycle; however, turbidity ranges in the Delta are broad, and specific requirements for this fish species are still unknown. To evaluate turbidity requirements for early life stages, late-larval delta smelt were maintained at environmentally relevant turbidity levels ranging from 5 to 250 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) for 24 h, after which a combination of physiological endpoints (molecular biomarkers and cortisol), behavioural indices (feeding) and whole-organism measures (survival) were determined. All endpoints delivered consistent results and identified turbidities between 25 and 80 NTU as preferential. Delta smelt survival rates were highest between 12 and 80 NTU and feeding rates were highest between 25 and 80 NTU. Cortisol levels indicated minimal stress between 35 and 80 NTU and were elevated at low turbidities (5, 12 and 25 NTU). Expression of stress-related genes indicated significant responses for gst, hsp70 and glut2 in high turbidities (250 NTU), and principal component analysis on all measured genes revealed a clustering of 25, 35, 50 and 80 NTU separating the medium-turbidity treatments from low- and high-turbidity treatments. Taken together, these data demonstrate that turbidity levels that are either too low or too high affect delta smelt physiological performance, causing significant effects on overall stress, food intake and mortality. They also highlight the need for turbidity to be considered in habitat and water management decisions.",2016,10.1093/conphys/cow004,4,NA,NA,cow004,Delta smelt; fundamental niche; habitat preference; Hypomesus transpacificus; stress

Increasingly, hair cortisol concentrations (HCCs) are being used to monitor seasonal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity of ungulate populations; yet, the effect of key covariates for caribou (sex, season, sampling source, body location) are largely unknown. The objectives of this research were 4-fold: first, we assessed the impact of body location (neck, rump) sampling sites on HCC; second, we assessed key covariates (sex, sampling method, season) impacting HCCs of caribou; third, we investigated inter-population (Dolphin and Union (DU), Bluenose-East (BNE)) and inter-annual differences in HCC and fourth, we examined the association between HCCs and indices of biting insect activity on the summer range (oestrid index, mosquito index). We examined hair from 407 DU and BNE caribou sampled by harvesters or during capture-collaring operations from 2012 to 2020. Linear mixed-effect models were used to assess the effect of body location on HCC and generalized least squares regression (GLS) models were used to examine the impacts of key covariates, year and herd and indices of biting insect harassment. HCC varied significantly by body location, year, herd and source of samples (harvester vs capture). HCC was higher in samples taken from the neck and in the DU herd compared with the BNE, decreased linearly over time and was higher in captured versus hunted animals (P < 0.05). There was no difference in HCC between sexes, and indices of biting insect harassment in the previous year were not significantly associated with HCC.

article,Larval growth of the polychaete <i>Arenicola marina</i> under different temperature and food conditions: consequences on bioenergetic models,"Broquard, Coralie and Lancelot, Theo and Lefebvre, Sebastien and Courcot, Lucie and Gaudron, Sylvie M.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Arenicola marina, a marine benthic polychaete, is widespread on sandy beaches in Europe and considered as an ecosystem engineer despite commonly used as bait by fishermen. Data regarding the bioenergetics of the lugworm larval stages are still incomplete. Trochophore is initially lecithotroph and then becomes planktotroph while growing as metatrochophore on subtidal area, a quite stable daily temperature environment compared with the foreshore, where juveniles and adult live, with daily temperature fluctuating up to 15 degrees C. These discrepancies in temperature ranges may influence the temperature corrections (TCs) that control metabolic rates during the life cycle of A. marina. We carried out laboratory experiments in microcosms by inducing artificial spawning of lugworms, and then undertaken in vitro fertilization to obtain embryos and, finally, to follow, the larval development up to 10 segments with chaetae for 50 days under three temperature conditions (13 degrees C, 15 degrees C and 17 degrees C) and two food conditions ('fed'and `non-fed'). The first feeding ('birth') of A. marina larvae was deciphered anatomically for a size between 450 and 500 itm and described at 17 days post-fertilization for larvae reared at 15 degrees C and 17 degrees C. Using a biphasic model with a von Bertalanffy growth before `birth' and an exponential growth after `birth, among the three temperature treatments, the 15 degrees C condition exhibited the best larval performance. TC based on embryonic and larval metabolic rates gave an Arrhenius temperature of similar to 6661 K and a higher boundary temperature tolerance range of similar to 294.5 K. Both temperature values differ from those calculated from TC based mostly on juvenile and adult metabolic rates. We claim to use two sets of Arrhenius temperatures according to the life history stages of A. marina while using Dynamic Energy Budget model.

article,Fatty acid composition and parasitism of European sardine (<i>Sardina pilchardus</i>) and anchovy (<i>Engraulis encrasicolus</i>) populations in the northern Catalan Sea in the context of changing environmental conditions,"Biton-Porsmoguer, Sebastian and Bou, Ricard and Lloret, Elsa and Alcaide, Manuel and Lloret, Josep",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"The status of sardine and anchovy populations in the northern Mediterranean Sea has been declining in recent decades. In this study, fatty acids and parasitism at different reproductive and feeding stages in these two species were assessed using specimens caught along the northern Catalan coast, in order to assess the links between lipid dynamics, reproduction and feeding in these two species and to contribute towards an explanation of the potential causes of the current poor situation of the stocks. The results support the use of fatty acid levels as indicators of the body condition of sardine and anchovy at different reproductive and feeding stages, as well as that of the pelagic environmental conditions. In particular, the relatively low n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid levels found in spawning sardines compared to spawning anchovies indicate a poorer reproductive health status of sardine. By comparing the current total lipid content values with those recorded in other Mediterranean and North Atlantic areas, and others from more than 10 years ago, in the adjacent area of the Gulf of Lion, our study reveals the persistent poor condition of sardine and anchovy in the northern Catalan Sea. Furthermore, the low levels of diatom fatty acid markers observed throughout the spawning and non-spawning seasons in both sardine and anchovy indicate a diet poor in diatoms. Moreover, the results indicate that it is very unlikely that parasitism is a significant factor in the decline in condition of sardine and anchovy in the northern Catalan Sea. In fact, the results, which we believe provide useful insights for the management of small pelagic fisheries in the Mediterranean, suggest that the current poor condition of sardine and anchovy in the northern Catalan Sea has probably been exacerbated by a decrease in plankton productivity and/or a shift in the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton communities, adding to the ongoing effects of overfishing.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa121,8,NA,NA,coaa121,Fatty acids; parasitism; pelagic environment; sea warming; small pelagic fish
article,Gill slits provide a window into the respiratory physiology of sharks,"VanderWright, Wade J. and Bigman, Jennifer S. and Elcombe, Cayley F. and Dulvy, Nicholas K.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Metabolically important traits, such as gill surface area and metabolic rate, underpin life histories, population dynamics and extinction risk, as they govern the availability of energy for growth, survival and reproduction. Estimating both gill surface area and metabolic rate can be challenging, especially when working with large-bodied, threatened species. Ideally, these traits, and respiratory physiology in general, could be inferred from external morphology using a faster, non-lethal method. Gill slit height is quick to measure on live organisms and is anatomically connected to the gill arch. Here, we relate gill slit height and gill surface area for five Carcharhiniform sharks. We compared both total and parabranchial gill surface area to mean and individual gill slit height in physical specimens. We also compared empirical measurements of relative gill slit height (i.e. in proportion to total length) to those estimated from field guide illustrations to examine the potential of using anatomical drawings to measure gill slit height. We find strong positive relationships between gill slit height and gill surface area at two scales: (i) for total gill surface area and mean gill slit height across species and (ii) for parabranchial gill surface area and individual gill slit height within and across species. We also find that gill slit height is a consistent proportion of the fork length of physical specimens. Consequently, relative gill slit height measured from field guide illustrations proved to be surprisingly comparable to those measured from physical specimens. While the generality of our findings needs to be evaluated across a wider range of taxonomy and ecological lifestyles, they offer the opportunity that we might only need to go to the library and measure field guide illustrations to yield a non-lethal, first- order approximation of the respiratory physiology of sharks.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa102,8,NA,NA,NA,Carcharhinus; Gill Oxygen Limitation Theory; Metabolic Theory of Ecology; Rhizoprionodon terraenovae; shrinking fishes; Sphyrna tiburo

Mandrills (Mandrills sphinx) are vulnerable to extinction due to habitat loss and demand for bush meat and the pet trade. To help bolster in situ populations, rehabilitated rescued mandrills recently were released into a protected area in the Republic of Congo. The goal of this study was to validate the use of faecal glucocorticoid metabolite enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) in mandrills and test field-friendly faecal hormone extraction techniques that can subsequently be used to monitor the stress physiology and welfare of mandrills throughout the release process. Using faecal samples collected from ex situ mandrills, we tested cortisol, corticosterone, 11 beta-hydroxyetiocholanolone (69a), and 11-oxoetiocholanolone EIAs. Absolute concentrations, hormone profiles following medical procedures or translocation, and high-performance liquid chromatography fraction immunoreactivity showed that the 69a assay was the best choice to monitor the stress response in this species. Samples with delayed extraction or drying times had 40-80\% lower 69a concentrations than samples extracted immediately post-collection and frozen.

M.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Life history and energetics of Actinopterygii are analysed using parameters and traits from the Add-my-Pet collection. Actinopterygii are the only vertebrate class that shows metabolic acceleration a short period after birth, and they are near the supply-end of the supply-demand spectrum. Many small freshwater species sport the waste-to-hurry strategy. To address challenges in management and conservation of fishes and fisheries it is essential to understand their life histories and energetics. The Add-my-Pet (AmP) collection of data on energetics and Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) parameters currently contains 1150 of the 40000 extant species of fish. It gives 250-280 traits per species, depending on the model type that was applied, such as maximum reserve capacity, lifespan, specific respiration and precociality index, based on which the ray-finned fish (Actinopterygii) was compared with the four other fish classes (Cyclostomata, Chondrichthyes, Actinistia, Dipnoi) and the Tetrapoda. The Actinopterygii are the only vertebrate class that shows metabolic acceleration, and clearly so in only three sub-clades. Different from chondrichthyans, quite a few species follow the waste-to-hurry strategy, especially small bodied freshwater fish such as tropical annual killifish, but also in small minnows and darters in continental climates. We briefly discuss links between waste-to-hurry, which is associated with a large specific somatic maintenance, and sensitivity for pesticides. We discuss why this interferes with the physical co-variation between maximum reserve capacity and ultimate structural length or weight and explains why maximum reserve capacity increases with body length in chondrichthyans, but not in actinopterygians. Reserve capacity has relevance, e.g. mass-specific maintenance, starvation and the kinetics of lipophyllic compounds (such as pesticides), since reserve is relatively rich in lipids in fish. Also, unlike chondrichthyans, the size at birth is very small and not linked to ultimate size; we discuss the implications. Actinopterygians allocate more to soma, compared with chondrichthyans; the latter allocate more to maturity or reproduction. Actinopterygians, Actinistia and Dipnoi are near the supply-end of the supply-demand spectrum, while chondrichthyans clearly show demand properties.",2022,10.1093/conphys/coac039,10,1,NA,coac039,Add-my-Pet collection; Dynamic Energy Budgets; metabolism; waste-to-hurry; life history; population growth rate

Understanding how anthropogenic and environmental stressors influence migratory movements is of critical importance because of their potential to cause a mismatch between the timing of animal movements and the emergence of high-quality forage. We measured stress hormones (fecal glucocorticoid metabolites; FGMs) to test hypotheses about the effects of high-quality forage tracking, human land-use and use of stopover sites on the physiological state of individuals along a migratory route. We collected and analysed FGM concentrations from 399 mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) samples obtained along a 241-km migratory route in western Wyoming, USA, during spring 2015 and 2016. In support of a fitness benefit hypothesis, individuals occupying areas closer to peak forage quality had decreased FGM levels. Specifically, for every 10-day interval closer to peak forage quality, we observed a 7\% decrease in FGMs. Additionally, we observed support for both an additive anthropogenic stress hypothesis and a hypothesis that stopovers act as physiological refugia, wherein individuals sampled far from stopover sites exhibited 341\% higher FGM levels if in areas of low landscape integrity compared to areas of high landscape integrity. Overall, our findings indicate that the physiological state of mule deer during migration is influenced by both anthropogenic disturbances and their ability to track high-quality forage. The availability of stopovers, however, modulates physiological responses to those stressors. Thus, our results support a recent call for the prioritization of stopover locations and connectivity between those locations in conservation planning for migratory large herbivores.",2018,10.1093/conphys/coy054,6,NA,NA,coy054,Bottleneck; fecal glucocorticoid metabolites; fitness benefit hypothesis; green wave surfing; long-distance migration; movement ecology; stopover
article,"Divergent impacts of the neonicotinoid insecticide, clothianidin, on flight performance metrics in two species of migratory butterflies","Cibotti, Staci and Saum, Phineas J. and Myrick, Andrew J. and Schilder, Rudolf J. and Ali, Jared G.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Long-distance flight is crucial for the survival of migratory insects, and disruptions to their flight capacity can have significant consequences for conservation. In this study, we examined how a widely used insecticide, clothianidin (class: neonicotinoid), impacted the flight performance of two species of migratory butterflies, monarchs (Danaus plexippus) and painted ladies (Vanessa cardui). To do this, we quantified the free-flight energetics and tethered-flight velocity and distance of the two species using flow-through respirometry and flight mill assays. Our findings show differential effects of the pesticide on the two species. For painted ladies, we found that clothianidin exposure reduced average free-flight metabolic rates, but did not affect either average velocity or total distance during tethered flight. Other studies have linked low flight metabolic rates with reduced dispersal capacity, indicating that clothianidin exposure may hinder painted lady flight performance in the wild. Conversely, for monarchs, we saw no significant effect of clothianidin exposure on average free-flight metabolic rates but did observe increases in the average velocity, and for large individuals, total distance achieved by clothianidin-exposed monarchs in tethered flight. This suggests a potential stimulatory response of monarchs to low-dose exposures to clothianidin. These findings indicate that clothianidin exposure has the potential to influence the flight performance of butterflies, but that not all species are impacted in the same way. This highlights the need to be thoughtful when selecting performance assays, as different assays can evaluate fundamentally distinct aspects of physiology, and as such may yield divergent results.",2024,10.1093/conphys/coae002,12,1,NA,coae002,Energetics; flight; Lepidoptera
article,Biological validation of faecal corticosterone metabolites as a non-invasive stress assessment in translocated California valley quail (Callipepla californica),"Currier, Sarah A. and Whitt, Jeffrey G. and Reyna, Kelly S.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"US quail species are vulnerable to population declines as a result of climate change, habitat loss and habitat fragmentation, all of which can result in physiological stress. Additionally, population restoration techniques (PRTs), like translocations, also induce stress. Traditional assessments of avian stress hormone levels include capturing and handling birds to extract blood, methods that are inherently stressful and can compound stress analyses. However, the stress hormone corticosterone (CORT) is metabolized from the blood and excreted in faeces as faecal corticosterone metabolites (FCMs). FCMs have been used as a non-invasive measurement of stress hormone levels in a variety of species, but must be validated for each species. The objective of this study was to biologically validate the use of FCMs as a non-invasive measurement of CORT levels in California valley quail (Callipepla californica). Reference and treatment quail were acclimated for 3 weeks in an outdoor aviary. Subsequently, treatment quail were subjected to a simulated 48-h translocation, a common and stress hormone-inducing PRT. Faecal samples were collected every 4 h and processed using an enzyme immunoassay. Mean FCM concentrations of treatment quail (41.50 +/- 16.13 ng/g) were higher than reference FCM concentrations (24.07 +/- 10.4 ng/g). These results biologically validate the use of FCMs as a non-invasive method to assess CORT levels in California valley quail, demonstrate diurnal variation in quail CORT levels, and confirm that quail translocations are a stress-inducing PRT. Ultimately, this research validates a new non-invasive tool for stress response measurement to advance quail research, management and conservation.

In this study, we conducted an environmental validation for measurement of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGMs) in jaguars (Panthera onca). We collected fresh faeces (e.g. no older than 8 h) from jaguars (six males and four females), housed at the Belize Zoo, and exposed them randomly to two environmental conditions: shade and sun. A control (first sub-sample) was immediately frozen, after which sub-samples were frozen daily over a 5 day period in both the dry and wet seasons. We quantified FGMs using a cortisol enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and a corticosterone radioimmunoassay (RIA), both capable of identifying relevant metabolites. Results indicated that FGMs assessed with the cortisol EIA were stable for 5 days during the dry season but for <1 day during the wet season, while FGMs assessed with the corticosterone RIA were stable for 5 days during both the dry and wet seasons. Exposure of jaguar faeces to sun or shade had no effect on FGM concentrations, despite significant differences in weather parameters. Analysis of faecal morphology proved unreliable in identifying faecal age. We conclude that the corticosterone RIA is suitable for assessing FGMs in free-ranging Belizean jaguars by surveying the same transects every 3-4 days in both seasons. The cortisol EIA can be used during the dry season, but there are possible shifts in metabolite immunoactivity in wet conditions.

In South Africa, some African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) colonies have become tourist attractions. The species is globally endangered, with population sizes decreasing over the past 40 years. AsAfrican penguin chicks are altricial and unable tomove away fromanthropogenic stressors, it is important to evaluate the effect of tourist activities on baseline glucocorticoid levels as a measure of potential disturbance. Chicks at three study sites within two breeding colonies (Robben Island, Stony Point), with varying levels of exposure to tourism (low/moderate/high) were monitored. Urofaecal samples were collected to determine urofaecal glucocorticoid metabolite (ufGCM) concentrations as an indication of baseline stress physiology. Morphometric measurements were taken to compare body condition between sites. Penguin chicks experiencing low, infrequent human presence had significantly higher mean (+/- standard deviation) ufGCM levels {[}1.34 +/- 1.70 mu g/g dry weight (DW)] compared to chicks experiencing both medium (0.50 +/- 0.40 mu g/g DW, P= 0.001) and high levels of human presence (0.57 +/- 0.47 mu g/g DW, P= 0.003). There was no difference in chick body condition across sites. These results suggest that exposure to frequent human activity may induce habituation/desensitization in African penguin chicks. Acute, infrequent human presence was likely an important driver for comparatively higher ufGCM levels in chicks, though several other environmental stressors may also play an important role in driving adrenocortical activity. Nevertheless, as unhabituated chicks experiencing infrequent anthropogenic presence showed significantly higher ufGCM levels, managers and legislation should attempt to minimize all forms of activity around important breeding colonies that are not already exposed to regular tourism. Although the results of this study are crucial for developing enhanced conservation and management protocols, additional research on the long-term effect of anthropogenic activities on African penguin physiology is required.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab078,9,NA,NA,coab078,stress physiology; glucocorticoids; ecotourism; chicks; body condition; African penguins
article,The effect of intrinsic physiological traits on diapause survival and their underlying mechanisms in an annual bee species <i>Bombus impatiens</i>,"Treanore, Erin and Amsalem, Etya",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"In the face of insect declines, identifying phases of the life cycle when insects are particularly vulnerable to mortality is critical to conservation efforts. For numerous annual insect groups, diapause is both a key adaptation that allows survival of inhospitable conditions and a physiologically demanding life stage that can result in high rates of mortality. As bees continue to garner attention as a group experiencing high rates of decline, improving our understanding of how annual bees prepare for diapause and identifying factors that reduce survival is imperative. Here, we studied factors affecting diapause survival length and their underlying mechanisms using an economically and ecologically important annual bee species, Bombus impatiens. We examined how age and mass upon diapause onset correlate with diapause survival length, and the mechanistic role of nutrient acquisition and oxidative stress post pupal eclosion in mediating these effects. Our findings show that both age and mass were strong predictors of diapause survival length. Heavier queens or queens in the age range of similar to 6-17 days survived longer in diapause. Mass gain was attributed to increases in lipid, protein and glycerol amounts following pupal eclosion, and the ability to deal with oxidative stress was significantly compromised in older pre-diapause queens.

However, identifying the effects of endogenous versus exogenous variables on marine mammal physiology remains a substantial challenge in part because of the logistical constraints that limit the collection of physiological data in free-ranging animals. Measuring genome-wide gene expression is one minimally invasive method that can be used to elucidate how free-ranging cetaceans' physiological responses shift with changing environmental conditions or demographic states, i.e. reproductive status and maturity. We identified transcriptomic differences among bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from the Southern California Bight using RNAseq data from the skin of 75 individuals to examine gene expression associated with sex, pregnancy status, sea surface temperature, geographic location and ecotype. We identified transcriptomic variation between two genetically distinct ecotypes as well as variation related to environmental conditions among groups that exhibit little evidence of genetic divergence. Specifically, we found differential expression of genes associated with structural development, cellular starvation and immune response. Sex and pregnancy status explained a small proportion of the observed variation, in contrast to sea surface temperature, which explained a substantial amount of transcriptomic variation. However, these measured variables did not account for all of the differential expression observed between ecotypes and among geographically distinct groups.

In an effort to characterize the mechanisms of post-release mortality and address fishery and managerial concerns regarding specific regulations, wild-caught Early Stuart sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) were exposed to either mild (20 s) or severe (20 min) gillnet entanglement and then held at ecologically relevant temperatures throughout their period of river migration (mid-late July) and spawning (early August). Individuals were biopsy sampled immediately after entanglement and at death to measure indicators of stress and immunity, and the infection intensity of 44 potential pathogens. Biopsy alone increased mortality (males: 33\%, females: 60\%) when compared with nonbiopsied controls (males: 7\%, females: 15\%), indicating high sensitivity to any handling during river migration, especially among females. Mortality did not occur until 5-10 days after entanglement, with severe entanglement resulting in the greatest mortality (males: 62\%, females: 90\%), followed by mild entanglement (males: 44\%, females: 70\%). Infection intensities of Flavobacterium psychrophilum and Ceratonova shasta measured at death were greater in fish that died sooner. Physiological indicators of host stress and immunity also differed depending on longevity, and indicated anaerobic metabolism, osmoregulatory failure and altered immune gene regulation in premature mortalities. Together, these results implicate latent effects of entanglement, especially among females, resulting in mortality days or weeks after release. Although any entanglement is potentially detrimental, reducing entanglement durations can improve post-release survival.",2017,10.1093/conphys/cox017,5,NA,NA,cox017,Bycatch; fisheries; gene expression; infectious disease; Pacific salmon; temperature

This study investigated whether exposure to bloom-like concentrations of two Synechococcus strains, CC9311 and CC9902, alters fish behaviour. Black perch (Embiotoca jacksoni) were exposed to Synechococcus strain CC9311 or CC9902 (1.5 x 10(6) cells ml(-1)) or to control seawater in experimental aquaria for 3 days. Fish movement inside a testing arena was then recorded and analysed using video camera-based motion-tracking software. Compared with control fish, fish exposed to CC9311 demonstrated a significant preference for the dark zone of the tank in the light-dark test, which is an indication of increased anxiety. Furthermore, fish exposed to CC9311 also had a statistically significant decrease in velocity and increase in immobility and they meandered more in comparison to control fish. There was a similar trend in velocity, immobility and meandering in fish exposed to CC9902, but there were no significant differences in behaviour or locomotion between this group and control fish. Identical results were obtained with a second batch of fish. Additionally, in this second trial we also investigated whether fish would recover after a 3 day period in seawater without cyanobacteria. Indeed, there were no longer any significant differences in behaviour among treatments, demonstrating that the sp. CC9311-induced alteration of behaviour is reversible. These results demonstrate that blooms of specific marine Synechococcus strains can induce differential sublethal effects in fish, namely alterations light-dark preference behaviour and motility.",2014,10.1093/conphys/cou020,2,1,NA,cou020,Fish physiology; harmful algal bloom; scototaxis
article,Heart rate responses provide an objective evaluation of human disturbance stimuli in breeding birds,"Ellenberg, Ursula and Mattern, Thomas and Seddon, Philip J.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Intuition is a poor guide for evaluating the effects of human disturbance on wildlife. Using the endangered Yellow-eyed penguin, Megadyptes antipodes, as an example, we show that heart rate responses provide an objective tool to evaluate human disturbance stimuli and encourage the wider use of this simple and low-impact approach. Yellow-eyed penguins are a flagship species for New Zealand's wildlife tourism; however, unregulated visitor access has recently been associated with reduced breeding success and lower first year survival. We measured heart rate responses of Yellow-eyed penguins via artificial eggs to evaluate a range of human stimuli regularly occurring at their breeding sites. We found the duration of a stimulus to be the most important factor, with elevated heart rate being sustained while a person remained within sight. Human activity was the next important component; a simulated wildlife photographer, crawling slowly around during his stay, elicited a significantly higher heart rate response than an entirely motionless human spending the same time at the same distance. Stimuli we subjectively might perceive as low impact, such as the careful approach of a `wildlife photographer', resulted in a stronger response than a routine nest-check that involved lifting a bird up to view nest contents. A single, slow-moving human spending 20 min within 2 m from the nest may provoke a response comparable to that of 10 min handling a bird for logger deployment. To reduce cumulative impact of disturbance, any human presence in the proximity of Yellow-eyed penguins needs to be kept at a minimum. Our results highlight the need for objective quantification of the effects of human disturbance in order to provide a sound basis for guidelines to manage human activity around breeding birds.",2013,10.1093/conphys/cot013,1,1,NA,cot013,Heart rate telemetry; human disturbance; stress-coping styles; tourism impact; wildlife management; Yellow-eyed penguins

While sublethal physiological effects of fish capture have been well studied in commercial and recreational fisheries, this issue has been overlooked for the ornamental fish trade, where it is common to capture fish from the wild and discard non-target species. We examined metabolic responses to capture and discard procedures in the three-striped dwarf cichlid Apistogramma trifasciata, a popular Amazonian aquarium species that nonetheless may be discarded when not a target species. Individuals (n = 34) were tagged and exposed to each of four treatments designed to simulate procedures during the capture and discard process: 1) a non-handling control; 2) netting; 3) netting +30 seconds of air exposure; and 4) netting +60 seconds of air exposure. Metabolic rates were estimated using intermittent-flow respirometry, immediately following each treatment then throughout recovery overnight. Increasing amounts of netting and air exposure caused an acute increase in oxygen uptake and decrease in available aerobic scope. In general, recovery occurred quickly, with rapid decreases in oxygen uptake within the first 30 minutes post-handling. Notably, however, male fish exposed to netting +60 seconds of air exposure showed a delayed response whereby available aerobic scope was constrained <75\% of maximum until similar to 4-6 hours post-stress. Larger fish showed a greater initial increase in oxygen uptake post-stress and slower rates of recovery. The results suggest that in the period following discard, this species may experience a reduced aerobic capacity for additional behavioural/physiological responses including feeding, territory defence and predator avoidance. These results are among the first to examine impacts of discard practises in the ornamental fishery and suggest ecophysiological research can provide valuable insight towards increasing sustainable practises in this global trade.",2024,10.1093/conphys/coad105,12,1,NA,coad105,Aerobic scope; Amazon rain forest; anthropogenic stress; fisheries; metabolism; ornamental fish

We identified 48 anelloviruses, which in humans are linked to immunosuppression. Polar bear anelloviruses did not vary with physiological, behavioral or demographic factors, but do appear to change with time. These data provide a baseline for assessing future changes. Climate change affects the behavior, physiology and life history of many Arctic wildlife species. It can also influence the distribution and ecology of infectious agents. The southern Beaufort Sea (SB) subpopulation of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) has experienced dramatic behavioral changes due to retreating sea ice and other climate-related factors, but the effects of these changes on physiology and infection remain poorly understood. Using serum from polar bears sampled between 2004 and 2015 and metagenomic DNA sequencing, we identified 48 viruses, all of the family Anelloviridae. Anelloviruses are small, ubiquitous infectious agents with circular single-stranded DNA genomes that are not known to cause disease but, in humans, covary in diversity and load with immunological compromise. We therefore examined the usefulness of anelloviruses as biomarkers of polar bear physiological stress related to climate and habitat use. Polar bear anelloviruses sorted into two distinct clades on a phylogenetic tree, both of which also contained anelloviruses of giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), another ursid. Neither anellovirus diversity nor load were associated with any demographic variables, behavioral factors or direct physiological measures. However, pairwise genetic distances between anelloviruses were positively correlated with pairwise differences in sampling date, suggesting that the polar bear ``anellome{''} is evolving over time. These findings suggest that anelloviruses are not a sensitive indicator of polar physiological stress, but they do provide a baseline for evaluating future changes to polar bear viromes.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad054,11,1,NA,coad054,Anellovirus; climate change; Polar bear; virus; wildlife health

These seals are experiencing climate-driven changes in their habitat that could result in physiological stress. Chronic physiological stress can lead to immunosuppression, decreased reproduction and decreased growth. Recently, keratin has become a popular matrix to measure steroid hormones, such as stress-related cortisol and reproduction-related progesterone. We developed and validated methods to extract cortisol and progesterone from the claws of adult female ringed (n = 20) and bearded (n = 3) seals using enzyme immunosorbent assays. As ringed and bearded seal claws grow, a pair of dark- and light-colored bands of keratin is deposited annually providing a guide for sampling. Two processing methods were evaluated, removal of claw material with a grinding bit or grinding followed by mechanical pulverization (102 paired samples from six claws, two each from three seals). Adding the mechanical pulverization step resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in hormone extraction. Progesterone from the proximal claw band was evaluated to biologically validate claw material as a measure of pregnancy in ringed seals (n = 14). Claws from pregnant seals had significantly higher claw progesterone concentrations than from non-pregnant seals. This suggests that the elevated progesterone associated with gestation was reflected in the claws, and that the most proximal claw band was indicative of pregnancy status at time of death. Thus, although the sample size was low and the collection dates unbalanced, this study demonstrates the potential to use claws to examine an extended time series (up to 12 yrs) of cortisol and progesterone concentrations in ringed and bearded seal claws.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa073,8,NA,NA,coaa073,Cortisol; keratin; phocid; pinniped; progesterone; steroid hormone

Przewalski's gazelle (Procapra przewalskii) is a group-living ungulate endemic to the high-altitude Qinghai Lake region of China. Group-size effect on gazelle vigilance has been examined, yet little is known about how their GC concentration is affected by group size or reproductive status. In this study, we examined the effect of group size and reproductive status on faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentrations and individual vigilance during different stages of the reproduction cycle (i.e. non-breeding, lambing and rutting) in free-ranging adult female Przewalski's gazelles. Group size did not influence FGMs significantly, but mean vigilance duration increased with group size. The gazelles' FGMs and vigilance peaked in lambing season. FGMs showed no difference between rutting season and non-reproductive season, but vigilance was lowest in the rutting season. FGMs correlated with vigilance frequency and vigilance duration.

article,Artificial light at night disturbs the activity and energy allocation of the common toad during the breeding period,"Touzot, Morgane and Teulier, Loic and Lengagne, Thierry and Secondi, Jean and Thery, Marc and Libourel, Paul-Antoine and Guillard, Ludovic and Mondy, Nathalie",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Artificial nocturnal lighting, a worldwide phenomenon that is currently expanding, experimentally reduces the duration of activity and increases oxygen consumption at rest of the common toad, a nocturnal amphibian. These behavioural and physiological changes could be associated with an increase in individual stress levels and thus affect toad populations. Abstract The presence of artificial light at night (ALAN) is currently a global phenomenon. By altering the photoperiod, ALAN may directly affect the physiology and behaviour of many organisms, such as the timing of daily rhythms, hormonal regulation, food intake, metabolism, migration and reproduction. Surprisingly while it is known that ALAN exposure strongly influences health of humans and laboratory animals, studies on wildlife remain scarce. Amphibians are one of the most nocturnal groups of vertebrates and exhibit an unfavourable conservation status in most parts of the world. In order to gain insight into the consequences of ALAN, we experimentally exposed 36 adult breeding male common toads, Bufo bufo, to a light intensity of 0.1, 5 or 20 lux for 20 days, to investigate the activity using infrared cameras and the whole-body oxygen consumption by respirometry, as well as body mass and food intake. ALAN reduced toad activity over 24 h by 56\% at 5 lux and by 73\% at 20 lux. It did not affect the total energy expenditure but altered energy allocation. Indeed, standard energy expenditure increased by 28\% at 5 lux and by 58\% at 20 lux, while activity energy expenditure decreased by 18\% at 5 lux and 38\% at 20 lux. Finally, body mass and food intake were not affected. This study suggests that ALAN plays a large role in the activity and energy metabolism of common toads, which may have a long-term negative effect on the fitness of common toad populations. Generalizing these results to other taxa is crucial for conservation of biodiversity in an increasingly light world.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz002,7,NA,NA,coz002,Activity; amphibian; artificial light at night; energy balance; oxygen consumption

As a first step toward understanding the physiological responses of leatherback turtles to stress, and with the particular goal of assessment of the effect of capture, we quantified corticosterone (an adrenal stress hormone) and thyroxine (a regulator of metabolic rate, often inhibited by chronic stress) in 17 healthy leatherback turtles captured at sea for scientific study, with comparisons to 15 `distressed' leatherbacks that were found entangled in fishing gear (n = 8), confined in a weir net (n = 1) or stranded on shore (n = 6). Distressed leatherbacks had significantly elevated corticosterone (mean +/- SEM 10.05 +/- 1.72 ng/ml, median 8.38 ng/ml) and free thyroxine (mean 0.86 +/- 0.37 pg/ml, median 0.08 pg/ml) compared with healthy leatherbacks sampled immediately before release (after similar to 40 min of handling; corticosterone, mean 4.97 +/- 0.62 ng/ml, median 5.21 ng/ml; and free thyroxine, mean 0.05 +/- 0.05 pg/ml, median 0.00 pg/ml). The elevated thyroxine in distressed turtles compared with healthy turtles might indicate an energetic burden of entanglement and stranding. Six of the healthy leatherbacks were sampled twice, at similar to 25 and similar to 50 min after the time of first disturbance. In all six individuals, corticosterone was higher in the later sample (earlier sample, mean 2.74 +/- 0.88 ng/ml, median 2.61 ng/ml; later sample, mean 5.43 +/- 1.29 ng/ml, median 5.38 ng/ml), indicating that capture and handling elicit an adrenal stress response in this species. However, the corticosterone elevation after capture appeared relatively mild compared with the corticosterone concentrations of the entangled and stranded turtles. The findings suggest that capture and handling using the protocols described (e.g. capture duration <1 h) might represent only a mild stressor, whereas entanglement and stranding might represent moderate to severe stressors.",2016,10.1093/conphys/cow022,4,NA,NA,cow022,Anthropogenic stressors; corticosterone; Dermochelys coriacea; sea turtles; stress; thyroxine
article,Stress physiology of migrant birds during stopover in natural and anthropogenic woodland habitats of the Northern Prairie region,"Liu, Ming and Swanson, David L.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Anthropogenic alterations of woodland habitat may influence stopover biology, which in turn could alter the stress physiology of migratory landbirds. Woodland stopover habitats are scarce in the Northern Prairie region of North America and consist of native riparian corridor woodlands (corridors) and smaller, more isolated woodlots of anthropogenic origin around farmsteads (woodlots). Corridor habitats have been greatly reduced since the time of European settlement, but woodlot habitats have appeared over this same time period. In this study, we compared stopover biology and stress physiology of migratory landbirds using natural and anthropogenic woodland habitats. We first tested for differences between birds in the two habitats for baseline corticosterone (CORTB) and the magnitude of the stress response for individual species, taxonomic families and foraging guilds. Plasma corticosterone increased significantly for all bird groups in both habitats following 30 min of restraint stress (CORT30), and neither CORTB nor the magnitude of the stress response (CORT30 - CORTB) differed significantly between birds in the two habitats. Secondly, because CORTB levels are often elevated and CORT secretion following a stressor is often suppressed for birds in poor body condition, we hypothesized that woodland migrants with higher fattening rates would show reduced CORTB and a robust stress response. We tested this hypothesis by assessing the relationships between plasma corticosterone and plasma metabolites associated with refuelling. We found that CORTB was negatively associated and the magnitude of the stress response positively associated with plasma triglycerides (an indicator of fat deposition), with opposite patterns for corticosterone and plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate (an indicator of fat catabolism). These data suggest that both corridor and woodlot habitats serve as effective stopover habitat and that the reduction of corridor habitat and increased reliance on anthropogenic woodlots is not detrimental to the stress physiology of migrants in a region with limited woodland habitats.",2014,10.1093/conphys/cou046,2,1,NA,cou046,Corticosterone; landbird migrants; migration; riparian habitat; stopover biology; stress response
article,Cortisol in fish scales remains stable during extended periods of storage,"O'Toole, Christina and White, Philip and Graham, Conor T. and Conroy, Caitlin and Brophy, Deirdre",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Measurement of cortisol in fish scales is attracting considerable attention as a non-invasive indicator of chronic stress in wild populations. For many fish species of management and conservation interest, extensive scale collections exist that could provide extended records of individual stress responses, by combining cortisol measurements with life history information. However, it is not yet known how well cortisol is preserved in the scale during storage. To investigate the stability of scale cortisol, we accelerated potential degradation by storing scales from an individual farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in an oven at 50 degrees C for between 2 and 12 weeks. We found no significant relationship between scale cortisol concentration and either storage time or storage temperature. Cortisol concentrations in scales from the same fish were consistent (18.54-21.82 ng. g-1; coefficient of variation (CV) = 3.6\%), indicating that scale cortisol can be reliably quantified, even in scales stored for varying periods of time or under different conditions. We also examined the effects of storage in real time using Atlantic salmon scales that were stored in paper envelopes at room temperature for between 3 and 32 years and found no significant relationship between scale cortisol concentration and storage time. Scale cortisol concentrations ranged from 4.05 to 135.37 ng.g-1 and levels of between-individual variability were high (CV = 61\%). Given that scale cortisol does not degrade during long-term storage, historical scale collections and associated data describing fish life histories could potentially be used to develop bioindicators of physiological responses in fish populations. Further research is needed to understand scale cortisol variability and its biological relevance. Cortisol in fish scales could provide a non-invasive indicator of chronic stress in wild populations. We show that scale cortisol does not degrade during storage (3-32 years) or when held at 50 degrees C to accelerate potential degradation. Therefore, the scale collections held by many fisheries organizations and museums can be reliably analysed for cortisol.",2024,10.1093/conphys/coae065,12,1,NA,coae065,Atlantic salmon (salmo salar); bioindicator; fish scale archive; stress response

Research efforts have focused on the effects of winter tick infestation on moose survival and reproduction, but stress and nutritional responses to ticks and other stressors remain understudied. We examined the influence of several environmental factors on moose calf stress hormone metabolite concentrations and nutritional restriction in Vermont, USA. We collected 407 fecal and 461 snowurine samples from84 radio-collared moose calves in the winters of 2017-2019 (JanuaryApril) to measure fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCM) concentrations and urea nitrogen:creatinine (UN:C) ratios. We used generalized mixed-effects models to evaluate the influence of individual condition, winter ticks, habitat, climate and human development on stress and nutrition in calf moose. We then used these physiological data to build generalized linear models to predict calf winter survival. CalffGCMconcentrations increased with nutritional restriction and snowdepth during adult winter tick engorgement. Calf UN:C ratios increased in calves with lighterweights and higher tick loads in early winter. Calf UN:C ratios also increased in individuals with home ranges composed of little deciduous forests during adult winter tick engorgement. Our predictive models estimated that winter survival was negatively related to UN:C ratios and positively related to fGCM concentrations, particularly in early winter. By late March, as winter ticks are having their greatest toll and endogenous resources become depleted, we estimated a curvilinear relationship between fGCM concentrations and survival.

We affixed heart rate and acceleration biologgers to adult Caribbean spiny lobster (Panulirus argus), an ecologically, culturally and economically significant species in the western Atlantic ocean, to test the effect of artificial light at night on this species'physiology and behaviour relative to appropriate controls. The experiment was conducted in a simulated reef mesocosm in The Bahamas with incandescent lighting used to illuminate it at 1 lux, approximating light levels offshore of urban areas. In the conditions tested here, artificial light at night was found to have no effect on heart rate or locomotor activity in P. argus. We observed a dissociation between activity and heart rate at both short-term and long-term temporal scales. Lobsters were more active at night and nocturnal activity was higher in trials closer to new moon; however, heart rate did not vary with diel or lunar cycle. There was less than 8\% difference between daytime and night time average heart rate despite the average percentage of time spent active almost tripling in nights versus days, to 19.5\% from 7.2\%, respectively.

We found that faecal cortisol metabolites increased as distance to human infrastructure decreased, but this relationship was buffered by the use of refuge habitats during daytime. Wildlife populations are increasingly exposed to human-induced modifications of their habitats. To cope with anthropogenic stressors, animals can adjust their behaviour-for example, by shifting their activity to more sheltered habitats, or becoming more nocturnal. However, whether use of spatial and temporal adjustments in behaviour may regulate the endocrine response is poorly documented. Here, we analyzed faecal cortisol metabolites (FCMs) of wild roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) living in a human-dominated agro-ecosystem. Using Global Positioning System monitoring of 116 individuals, we assessed their spatial behaviour and tested whether proximity to anthropogenic structures (linear distance to built-up areas) and the use of refuge habitats (woodland and hedges) influenced FCM levels. In accordance with our predictions, individuals ranging closer to anthropogenic structures during daytime had higher FCM levels, but this relationship was buffered as use of refuge habitat increased. In addition, this link between proximity to anthropogenic structures and FCM levels disappeared when we analyzed spatial behaviour at night. Finally, FCM levels were higher when the ambient temperature was lower, and during years of low resource availability. Our results demonstrate that the stress levels of large mammals may be strongly influenced by their proximity to anthropogenic activities, but that these effects may be buffered by behavioural adjustments in terms of space use and circadian rhythm. Whereas most studies have focused on the influence of environmental heterogeneity, our analysis highlights the need to also consider the fine-scale spatial response of individuals when studying the hormonal response of wild animals to human disturbance. We emphasize the potential to mitigate this hormonal stress response, and its potential negative consequences on population dynamics, through the preservation or restoration of patches of refuge habitat in close proximity to human infrastructure.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa086,8,1,NA,coaa086,Faecal glucocorticoid metabolites; human disturbance; space use; stress hormones

Recent work has suggested that biomarkers of oxidative stress may provide an additional tool to assess the health state of individuals and to predict fitness perspectives. In this study, we assessed whether three biomarkers of plasma oxidative status predicted the following factors: (i) the resight probability as breeder in the next seasons; and (ii) the cumulative reproductive output over multiple years in Scopoli's shearwaters (Calonectris diomedea) using a 7 year individual-based data set. Our results show that shearwaters having higher levels of a marker of oxidative damage (reactive oxygen metabolites) in 2008 had a lower resight probability in the next years and a lower number of chicks raised from 2008 to 2014. In contrast, two biomarkers of antioxidant defences (non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity of plasma and thiols) did not have any predictive value.

Nevertheless, knowledge about changes in steroid hormone biodistribution in reaction to treatments could improve our understanding of their physiological functions in these species. Cortisol is a corticosteroid, which is frequently used as a stress biomarker in vertebrates, like fish or higher organisms. The aim of the study was to optimize cortisol extraction from various tissues of mussels, to develop a quantitative ELISA test system, and to study changes in biodistribution of cortisol in reaction to negative and positive stimulation treatments. As model organism, we used Anodonta anatina, a widespread freshwater mussel species native to Europe. We quantified cortisol concentrations in hepatopancreas, mantle, gills, gonads and the foot muscle. Tissue-specific reactions to environmental influences, simulated with the chemical stressors copper (II) chloride and sodium chloride, were assessed. During the 24-hours treatment, we additionally observed changes in cortisol regulation in response to feeding activity of the mussels. Besides, we found highly significant variations in the biodistribution of cortisol in different tissues, with a peak in the hepatopancreas. Whole body cortisol did not increase in the treated groups. However, balancing of all measured tissues showed redistribution of more than 10\% of total body cortisol from the hepatopancreas to all other tissues during copper (II) chloride stressor treatment, but also when mussels ingested feed, compared to the non-fed control group.

A simple and effective measure of barred owl body condition could help to understand how habitat quality varies within their new range, which in turn can inform their management and other aspects of their ecology. Using 77 barred owl carcasses collected during experimental removals in Washington and Oregon, USA, we measured the amount of lipid in each specimen with proximate body composition analysis. We then fit and compared (with adjusted R2 values) alternative linear regression models to estimate the percent lipids in dry mass of the owls based on morphometric body condition indices, a qualitative fat score of subcutaneous breast fat, sex and the time of year females were collected (relative to egg production). Adjusted R2 values for all models ranged from 0.49 to 0.87, with the best model including mass divided by foot-pad length, fat score, sex and the time of year a female was collected. Most models generated comparable estimates of percent lipids at a population level and we provided correction factors to apply these models when used with live barred owls, allowing for site-specific comparisons of body condition among individuals inhabiting a diversity of environmental conditions.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad069,11,1,NA,coad069,Body condition index; fat score; lipid extraction

For those species (exceptional species) that cannot be conserved long-term in standard seed banks, alternative methods are required, often involving in vitro culture and cryopreservation, or storage in liquid nitrogen. Cycladenia humilis var. jonesii is a federally threatened perennial native to Utah and Arizona. It is classified as an exceptional species, because it produces few seeds, and, thus, in vitro propagation and cryopreservation were investigated as tools for its propagation and preservation. Shoot-propagating cultures were established from both seedling and wild-collected shoots, but cultures from both sources displayed an extreme form of the physiological disorder, hyperhydricity. This phenotype could be at least partially normalized by the use of vented closures, as well as by using agar, rather than gellan gum, in the medium. The hyperhydric (HH) phenotype had a lower dry weight, more branching, minimal leaf development and more poorly developed vascular tissue than the more normal (MN) phenotype. Only more normalized shoots could be rooted and the resulting plants acclimatized. Both HH and MN shoots also provided shoot tips capable of surviving cryopreservation using the droplet vitrification method. These in vitro and cryopreservation methods provide tools that can be used for propagating plants of C. humilis var. jonesii for research and restoration, as well as for supplying shoot tips for the ex situ conservation of this species. The two distinct phenotypes also provide a useful system for studying factors involved in the HH response of this dryland species in vitro.",2017,10.1093/conphys/cox053,5,NA,NA,cox053,Cryopreservation; endangered species; exceptional plant; germination; hyperhydricity; in vitro; micropropagation

Patrick and McCulloh, Katherine A.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Cycadales is highly endangered and one of the oldest dioecious gymnosperm lineages, making their reproductive biology highly relevant to conservation efforts and our understanding of the impact of dioecy, yet cycad reproductive ecophysiology is poorly understood. We examined how the costs associated with reproduction may impact basic physiological variation in cycad species. Specifically, we measured traits related to functional morphology and photosynthetic physiology in sterile and fertile staminate plants ('males') of Zamia portoricensis. Light response curves showed that sterile plants had greater light-use efficiency and maximum photosynthetic capacity per area compared with fertile plants. However, fertile and sterile plants exhibited similar respiration rates. We found significantly more nitrogen in leaves of fertile individuals, but similar nitrogen isotope composition and no differences in carbon content between sterile and fertile individuals. Despite having lower leaf-level photosynthetic rates, fertile plants had greater canopy-level photosynthesis than sterile plants, which was achieved by increasing leaf number and total leaf area. Our data suggest that sterile individuals may have greater light demands relative to fertile individuals, and fertile individuals may have greater nitrogen demands, which may be critical for successful reproductive events in staminate plants of the endangered cycad, Z. portoricensis. Cycadales is nominally the most endangered plant group on Earth, yet so much of their basic biology remains unknown which limits conservation strategies. We examined how key aspects of plant function may change with reproductive status in a tropical endangered cycad. We found that sterile individuals may have greater light demands relative to fertile individuals, and fertile individuals may have greater nitrogen demands, which may be critical for successful reproductive events in this endangered cycad.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad020,11,1,NA,NA,sterile; reproduction; photosynthesis; functional traits; fertile; cycads; conservation

Blood samples were drawn from eight hawksbill turtles captured in near shore foraging locations within the Galapagos archipelago over a period of four sequential years; three of these turtles were recaptured and sampled on multiple occasions. Of the eight sea turtles sampled, five were immature and of unknown sex, and the other three were females. A portable blood analyzer was used to obtain near immediate field results for a suite of blood gas and chemistry parameters. Values affected by temperature were corrected in two ways: (i) with standard formulas and (ii) with auto-corrections made by the portable analyzer. A bench top blood chemistry analyzer was used to measure a series of biochemistry parameters from plasma. Standard laboratory haematology techniques were employed for red and white blood cell counts and to determine haematocrit manually, which was compared to the haematocrit values generated by the portable analyzer.

Attempts to reintroduce one of China's most endangered species, the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), have been hampered by a lack of data on its ecology and physiology. We examined three giant pandas' hematological and blood chemistry parameters in a soft release program and 30 captive giant pandas as controls and determined the reference intervals (RIs) for those blood parameters in the captive animals. Elevation, captivity status and the interaction of those factors were statistically significant for hematologic measures. Release pandas had significantly higher hemoglobin and hematocrit values after they moved to high elevation locations. We also found significant difference in the enzyme parameters between high and low elevation pandas such as higher aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, creatinine kinase, amylase and lower lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase.

article,Maternal diet influences fecundity in a freshwater turtle undergoing population decline,"Petrov, Kristen and Van Dyke, James U. and Georges, Arthur and Keitel, Claudia and Spencer, Ricky-John",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Maternal diet affects reproductive output in female freshwater turtles (Emydura macquarii). At wetlands where filamentous green algae are scarce and turtles are functionally carnivorous, females produce smaller clutches. Reduced clutch size associated with food availability may have implications for declining freshwater turtle species. Food availability determines the amount of energy animals can acquire and allocate to reproduction and other necessary functions. Female animals that are food limited thus experience reduced energy available for reproduction. When this occurs, females may reduce frequency of reproductive events or the number or size of offspring per reproductive bout. We assessed how maternal diet affects reproductive output in adult female Murray River short-necked turtles, Emydura macquarii, from four wetlands in Victoria. We previously found that turtle diets differ in the composition of plants and animals between our study wetlands. In this study, we tested whether differences in turtle diet composition (i.e. plants and animals) at these wetlands were associated with differences in clutch mass, individual egg mass, bulk egg composition and hatching success. We found total clutch mass increased with maternal body size at each site. At sites where filamentous green algae were scarce and E. macquarii were carnivorous, females produced smaller clutches relative to body size compared to females from sites where algae were abundant, and turtles were more herbivorous. Individual egg mass, bulk egg composition and hatching success did not differ across wetlands. Isotopic analysis revealed significant positive relationships between the carbon and nitrogen isotopes (delta 13C, delta 15N) of the eggs and those of the mothers, indicating that mothers allocated ratios of carbon and nitrogen isotopes to their eggs similar to those present in their tissues. Our study suggests that at sites where females are more carnivorous due to a relative absence of algae, females produce smaller clutches, but other aspects of their reproduction are not significantly impacted. The reduction in clutch size associated with differences in the availability of dietary plants and animals may have long-term consequences for E. macquarii and other freshwater turtle species that are experiencing population declines.",2024,10.1093/conphys/coae033,12,1,NA,coae033,Emydura macquarii; food availability; reproductive output; stable isotopes

Habitat-induced variations in stress might be easiest to detect in highly territorial animals, and especially in species that do not take advantage of common strategies for modulating habitat-induced stress, such as migration (escape in space) or hibernation (escape in time). Spatial and temporal variation in response to potential stressors has received little study in wild animals, especially at scales appropriate for relating stress to specific habitat characteristics. Here, we use the American pika (Ochotona princeps), a territorial small mammal, to investigate stress response within and among territories. For individually territorial animals such as pikas, differences in habitat quality should lead to differences in stress exhibited by territory owners. We indexed stress using stress-associated hormone metabolites in feces collected non-invasively from pika territories every 2 weeks from June to September 2018. We hypothesized that differences in territory quality would lead to spatial differences in mean stress and that seasonal variation in physiology or the physical environment would lead to synchronous variation across territories through time. We used linear mixed-effects models to explore spatiotemporal variation in stress using fixed effects of day-of-year and broad habitat characteristics (elevation, aspect, site), as well as local variation in habitat characteristics hypothesized to affect territory quality for this saxicolous species (talus depth, clast size, available forage types). We found that temporal variation within territories was greater than spatial variation among territories, suggesting that shared seasonal stressors are more influential than differences in individual habitat quality. This approach could be used in other wildlife studies to refine our understanding of habitat quality and its effect on individual stress levels as a driver of population decline.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab024,9,NA,NA,coab024,American pika; glucocorticoid metabolite; habitat quality; Ochotona princeps; stress physiology
article,The effects of daily mitotane or diazepam treatment on the formation of chronic stress symptoms in newly captured wild house sparrows,"Fischer, Clare P. and Romero, L. Michael",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Wild animals brought into captivity frequently experience chronic stress and typically need a period of time to adjust to the conditions of captivity (restraint, artificial lighting, altered diet, human presence, etc.), to which theymay never fully acclimate. Changes in mass, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and heart rate parameters have been observed over the first week in newly captive house sparrows (Passer domesticus). In this study, we tested the effects of two drugs, diazepam and mitotane, in preventing the chronic stress symptoms caused by captivity, compared with oil-injected control animals. Diazepam is an anxiolytic that is widely prescribed in humans and other animals and has been shown in some cases to reduce physiological stress. Mitotane is an agent that causes chemical adrenalectomy, reducing the body's capacity to produce glucocorticoid hormones. Our mitotane treatment did not cause the expected change in corticosterone concentrations. Baseline corticosterone was higher after a week in captivity regardless of the treatment group, while stress-induced corticosterone did not significantly increase above baseline after a week in captivity in any treatment group. However, mitotane treatment did have some physiological effects, as it reduced the resting heart rate and the duration of the heart rate response to a sudden noise. It also prevented the increase in nighttime activity that we observed in control animals. There was no effect of diazepam on corticosterone, resting heart rate, activity or heart rate response to a sudden noise, and no effect of either treatment on the sympathetic vs parasympathetic control of the resting heart rate. Together, these data suggest that mitotane, but not diazepam, can have a modest impact on helping house sparrows adapt to captive conditions. Easing the transition to captivity will likely make conservation efforts, such as initiating captive breeding programs, more successful.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa118,8,NA,NA,coaa118,Captivity; corticosterone; diazepam; heart rate; mitotane; stress

There is concern that the omnidirectional, high intensity sound pulses created by airguns may alter fish physiology and behaviour. A controlled short-term field experiment was performed to investigate the effects of sound exposure from a seismic airgun on the physiology and behaviour of two socioeconomically and ecologically important marine fishes: the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and saithe (Pollachius virens). Biologgers recording heart rate and body temperature and acoustic transmitters recording locomotory activity (i.e. acceleration) and depth were used to monitor free-swimming individuals during experimental sound exposures (18-60 dB above ambient). Fish were held in a large sea cage (50 m diameter; 25 m depth) and exposed to sound exposure trials over a 3-day period. Concurrently, the behaviour of untagged cod and saithe was monitored using video recording. The cod exhibited reduced heart rate (bradycardia) in response to the particle motion component of the sound from the airgun, indicative of an initial flight response. No behavioural startle response to the airgun was observed; both cod and saithe changed both swimming depth and horizontal position more frequently during sound production. The saithe became more dispersed in response to the elevated sound levels. The fish seemed to habituate both physiologically and behaviourally with repeated exposure. In conclusion, the sound exposures induced over the time frames used in this study appear unlikely to be associated with long-term alterations in physiology or behaviour.

Loren and Barnes, Brian M.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"The Earth's climate is changing at an unprecedented rate and, as ecologists, we are challenged with the difficult task of predicting how individuals and populations will respond to climate-induced changes to local and global ecosystems. Although we are beginning to understand some of the responses to changing seasonality, the physiological mechanisms that may drive these responses remain unknown. Using long-term data comparing two nearby populations (<20 km apart) of free-living arctic ground squirrels in northern Alaska, we have previously shown that the timing of spring snowmelt greatly influences their phenology of hibernation and reproduction in a population and site-specific manner. Here, we integrate these site-specific phenologies with body condition, stress physiology, reproductive success and juvenile recruitment to understand phenotypic selection in the two populations. We found that at the site with relatively late spring snowmelt and early autumn snow cover: (i) adult females were larger and in better body condition but had significantly higher stress hormone levels; (ii) females had similar numbers of comparably sized offspring, but offspring had higher stress hormone levels; and (iii) offspring density was lower just prior to hibernation. Thus, adult females at the two sites appear to use different coping strategies that allow them to maintain reproductive fitness; however, marked shortening of the active season because of later snowmelt in spring and earlier snow cover in autumn may compromise juvenile recruitment.

During the winters of 2011-15, we captured 15 subadult brown bears (Ursus arctos) and recorded their body temperatures (n = 11) and heart rates (n = 10) before, during and after capture using biologgers. We estimated the time for body temperature and heart rate to normalize after the capture event. We then evaluated the effect of the captures on the pattern and depth of hibernation and the day of den emergence by comparing the body temperature of captured bears with that of undisturbed subadult bears (n = 11). Both body temperature and heart rate increased during capture and returned to hibernation levels after 15-20 days. We showed that bears required 2-3 weeks to return to hibernation levels after winter captures, suggesting high metabolic costs during this period.

article,Biomonitors of atmospheric nitrogen deposition: potential uses and limitations,"Diaz-Alvarez, Edison A. and Lindig-Cisneros, Roberto and de la Barrera, Erick",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Atmospheric nitrogen deposition is the third largest cause of global biodiversity loss, with rates that have more than doubled over the past century. This is especially threatening for tropical regions where the deposition may soon exceed 25 kg of N ha(-1) year(-1), well above the threshold for physiological damage of 12-20 kg of N ha(-1) year(-1), depending on plant species and nitrogenous compound. It is thus urgent to monitor these regions where the most diverse biotas occur. However, most studies have been conducted in Europe, the USA and recently in China. This review presents the case for the potential use of biological organisms to monitor nitrogen deposition, with emphasis on tropical plants. We first present an overview of atmospheric chemistry and the nitrogen metabolism of potential biomonitors, followed by a framework for monitoring nitrogen deposition based on the simultaneous use of various functional groups. In particular, the tissue nitrogen content responds to the rate of deposition, especially for mosses, whose nitrogen content increases by 1\% per kilogram of N ha(-1) year(-1). The isotopic signature, delta N-15, is a useful indicator of the nitrogen source, as the slightly negative values (e.g. 5\%) of plants from natural environments can become very negative (-11.2\%) in sites with agricultural and husbandry activities, but very positive (13.3\%) in urban environments with high vehicular activity. Mosses are good biomonitors for wet deposition and atmospheric epiphytes for dry deposition. In turn, the nitrogen saturation of ecosystems can be monitored with trees whose isotopic values increase with saturation. Although given ecophysiological limitations of different organisms, particular studies should be conducted in each area of interest to determine the most suitable biomonitors. Overall, biomonitors can provide an integrative approach for characterizing nitrogen deposition in regions where the deployment of automated instruments or passive monitoring is not feasible or can be complementary.",2018,10.1093/conphys/coy011,6,NA,NA,coy011,Atmospheric monitoring; ecosystem saturation; environmental pollution; epiphytic plants; nitrogen content; stable isotopes

In this study, steroid hormone concentrations (progesterone, testosterone, cortisol and estradiol) were analysed in walrus bones collected during archaeological {[}3585-200 calendar years before present (BP)], historical {[}1880-2006 common era (CE)] and modern (2014-2016 CE) time periods, representing similar to 3651 years, to track changes in reproductive activity and cortisol concentrations (biomarker of stress) over time.

Scientists have begun to examine hormones in continuously growing biological matrices, such as baleen whale earwax plugs, baleen and pinniped vibrissae. Few of these studies have determined if the hormones in these tissues across the body of the organism are interchangeable. Here, hormone values in the right and left earplugs from the same individual were compared for two reasons: (i) to determine whether right and left earplug hormone values can be used interchangeably and (ii) to assess methods of standardizing hormones in right and left earplugs to control for individuals' naturally varying hormone expressions. We analysed how absolute, baseline-corrected and Z-score normalized hormones performed in reaching these goals. Absolute hormones in the right and left earplugs displayed a positive relationship, while using Z-score normalization was necessary to standardize the variance in hormone expression. After Z-score normalization, it was possible to show that the 95\% confidence intervals of the differences in corresponding lamina of the right and left earplugs include zero for both cortisol and progesterone. This indicates that the hormones in corresponding lamina of right and left earplugs are no different from zero.The results of this study reveal that both right and left earplugs from the same baleen whale can be used in hormone analyses after Z-score normalization.

We sought to characterize the interactions between infectious agent burden, fish immune and stress physiology and fisheries stressors to investigate the potential for capture-mediated pathogen-induced mortality in adult coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch. We used radio-telemetry paired with high-throughput qPCR of non-lethal gill biopsies for infectious agents and host biomarkers from 200 tagged fish experimentally displaced and exposed to various experimental fisheries treatments (gill net entanglement, recreational angling and recreational angling with air exposure vs. non-sampled control). We characterized relationships among post-release behaviour and survival, infectious agent presence and loads, physiological parameters and transcription profiles of stress and immune genes. All infectious agents detected were endemic and in loads consistent with previous adult Pacific salmon monitoring. Individuals exposed to fisheries treatments were less likely to reach spawning habitat compared to controls, and handling duration independent of fisheries gear had a negative effect on survival.

These physiological responses are also influenced by changes in life history state. The continued activation of physiological systems stemming from persistent environmental perturbations enable animals to cope with these challenges but may over time lead to significant effects on the health of wildlife. In the present study, we tested how varying environmental perturbations driven by tourism and associated supplemental feeding affects the energetics, corticosterone and immunity of six discrete populations of the northern Bahamian rock iguana (Cyclura cychlura inornata and Cyclura cychlura figginsi). We studied populations within and outside the reproductive season and quantified tourist numbers during sample collection. Specifically, we measured clutch size, body condition, plasma energy metabolites, reactive oxygen species, baseline corticosterone concentrations and immune function of male and female iguanas from each population to address whether (i) disparate physiologies are emerging across a gradient of tourism and feeding, (ii) both subspecies respond similarly and (iii) responses vary with season/reproductive condition. We found significant effects of tourism level, season and their interaction on the physiology of both C. c. inornata and C. c. figginsi, supporting the idea that tourism is leading to the divergence of phenotypes. Specifically, we found elevated plasma energy metabolites, oxidative stress and a measure of innate immunity (bactericidal ability), but reduced corticosterone concentrations with increasing tourism in both subspecies of rock iguanas. These physiological metrics differ according to the level of tourism in both subspecies and persist across seasons despite variation with natural seasonal and reproductive changes. These findings suggest that anthropogenic disturbance results in disparate physiologies in northern Bahamian rock iguanas.",2022,10.1093/conphys/coac001,10,1,NA,coac001,reproduction; oxidative stress; immunity; glucose; Cyclura; corticosterone

Even though most recreationally angled fish are released, little is known about how C\&R angling impacts fish at the cellular or tissue level. As the first to explore the impacts of C\&R angling on mRNA abundances, our study aimed to identify how the stress of angling influenced metabolism, acid-base regulation and cellular stress in the gills of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush). Because gills are responsible for metabolic gas exchange, are crucial sites of acid-base homeostasis and respond to stressors quickly, we hypothesized that the relative mRNA abundance of genes related to these three physiological processes would be altered after angling. We took gill samples of live lake trout at 0, 2 or 48 h after fish were angled by rod and reel, and then used quantitative PCR (qPCR) to measure the relative abundance of nine candidate mRNA transcripts. Heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) mRNA levels significantly increased over 5-fold 2 h after angling, indicating a potential activation of a cytoprotective response. However, contrary to our hypothesis, we observed no change in the relative mRNA abundance of genes related to metabolism or acid-base regulation in response to C\&R angling within a 48-h period. As C\&R angling can negatively impact fish populations, further use of transcript-level studies will allow us to understand the impact C\&R has on specific tissues and improve our knowledge of how C\&R influences overall fish health.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad065,11,1,NA,coad065,Physiology; recreational angling; recreational fisheries; salmonids; transcript level
article,"Ecosystem consequences of multi-trait response to environmental changes in Japanese medaka, Oryzias latipes","Pauli, Beatriz Diaz and Edeline, Eric and Evangelista, Charlotte",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Intraspecific trait variation has large effects on the ecosystem and is greatly affected by human activities. To date, most studies focused on single-trait analyses, while considering multiple traits is expected to better predict how an individual interacts with its environment. Here, we used a mesocosm experiment with fish Oryzias latipes to test whether individual growth, boldness and functional traits (feeding rate and stoichiometric traits) formed one functional pace-of-life syndrome (POLS). We then tested the effects of among-individual mean and variance of fish functional POLSs within mesocosms on invertebrate community (e.g. zoobenthos and zooplankton abundances) and ecosystem processes (e.g. ecosystem metabolism, algae stock, nutrient concentrations). Stoichiometric traits correlated with somatic growth and behaviours, forming two independent functional POLS (i.e. two major covariance axes). Mean values of the first syndrome were sex- and environment-dependent and were associated with (i) long-term (10 generations; 4 years) selection for small or large body size resulting in contrasting life histories and (ii) short-term (6 weeks) effects of experimental treatments on resource availability (through manipulation of light intensity and interspecific competition). Specifically, females and individuals from populations selected for a small body size presented fast functional POLS with faster growth rate, higher carbon body content and lower boldness. Individuals exposed to low resources (low light and high competition) displayed a slow functional POLS. Higher mesocosm mean and variance values in the second functional POLS (i.e. high feeding rate, high carbon:nitrogen body ratio, low ammonium excretion rate) were associated to decreased prey abundances, but did not affect any of the ecosystem processes. We highlighted the presence of functional multi-trait covariation in medaka, which were affected by sex, long-term selection history and short-term environmental conditions, that ultimately had cascading ecological consequences.

H. and de Leaniz, Carlos Garcia",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Artificial barriers cause widespread impacts on freshwater fish. Swimming performance is often used as the key metric in assessing fishes' responses to river barriers. However, barrier mitigation is generally based on the swimming ability of salmonids and other strong swimmers because knowledge of swimming ability for most other freshwater fish is poor. Also, fish pass designs tend to adopt a `one size fits all' approach because little is known about population or individual variability in swimming performance. Here, we assessed interspecific and intraspecific differences in the sustained swimming speed (U-sus) of five freshwater fish with contrasting body sizes, morphologies and swimming modes: topmouth gudgeon, European minnow, stone loach, bullhead and brown trout. Significant U-sus variation was identified at three organizational levels: species, populations and individual. Interspecific differences in U-sus were as large as 64 cm s(-1), upstream populations of brown trout showed mean U-sus 27 cm s(-1) higher than downstream populations, and species exhibited high individual variation (e.g. cv = 62\% in European minnow). Sustained swimming speed (U-sus) increased significantly with body size in topmouth gudgeon, European minnow and brown trout, but not in the two benthic species, bullhead and stone loach. Aerobic scope had a significant positive effect on U-sus in European minnow, stone loach and brown trout. Sustained swimming speed (U-sus) decreased with relative pectoral fin length in European minnow and brown trout, whereas body fineness was the best predictor in stone loach and bullhead. Hence, swimming performance correlated with a diverse range of traits that are rarely considered when predicting fish passage. Our study highlights the dangers of using species' average swimming speeds and illustrates why a `one size fits all' approach often fails to mitigate for barrier effects. We call for an evidence-based approach to barrier mitigation, one that recognizes natural variability at multiple hierarchical levels.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa126,8,NA,NA,coaa126,barrier passage; fish pass; metabolism; morphology; respirometry; selective effects

Smoltification (parr-smolt transformation) is a developmental process that allows salmon to acquire seawater tolerance in preparation for marine living. Traditionally, this developmental process has been monitored using gill Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) activity or plasma hormones, but gill gene expression offers the possibility of another method. Here, we describe the discovery of candidate genes from gill tissue for staging smoltification using comparisons of microarray studies with particular focus on the commonalities between anadromous Rainbow trout and Sockeye salmon datasets, as well as a literature comparison encompassing more species. A subset of 37 candidate genes mainly from the microarray analyses was used for TaqMan quantitative PCR assay design and their expression patterns were validated using gill samples from four groups, representing three species and two ecotypes: Coho salmon, Sockeye salmon, stream-type Chinook salmon and ocean-type Chinook salmon. The best smoltification biomarkers, as measured by consistent changes across these four groups, were genes involved in ion regulation, oxygen transport and immunity. Smoltification gene expression patterns (using the top 10 biomarkers) were confirmedby significant correlations with NKA activity and were associated with changes in body brightness, caudal fin darkness and caudal peduncle length. We incorporate gene expression patterns of pre-smolt, smolt and de-smolt trials from acute seawater transfers from a companion study to develop a preliminary seawater tolerance classification model for ocean-type Chinook salmon. This work demonstrates the potential of gene expression biomarkers to stage smoltification and classify juveniles as pre-smolt, smolt or de-smolt.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz051,7,NA,NA,coz051,Aquaculture; de-smolt; hatchery; Na+/K+-ATPase activity; parr-smolt transformation; transcription

Baseline values for a panel of analytes can be used to monitor physiologic and pathophysiologic processes such as organ function, electrolyte balance and protein catabolism. Our reference population includes 651 serum samples from polar bears (Ursus maritimus) from the southern Beaufort Sea (SB) subpopulation sampled in Alaska, USA, between 1983 and 2016. To establish RI for 13 biochemical analytes, we defined specific criteria for characterizing the reference population and relevant subgroups. To account for differences in seasonal life history characteristics, we determined separate RI for the spring and fall seasons, when prey availability and energetic requirements of bears differ. We established RI for five subgroups in spring based on sex, age class and denning status, and three subgroups in fall based on sex and age class in females only. Alkaline phosphatase activities were twice as high in subadult as in adult polar bears in spring (z(males) = 4.08, P-males < 0.001, z(females) = 3.90, P-females < 0.001) and did not differ between seasons. Denning females had significantly higher glucose concentrations than non-denning females (z = 4.94, P < 0.001), possibly reflecting differences in energy expenditure during lactation. A total of 10 of the 13 analytes differed significantly between seasons in either males or females; however, the physiologic importance of these differences may be minimal. Establishing these RIs allows for temporal monitoring of polar bear health in the SB and may prove useful for assessing and monitoring additional polar bear subpopulations in a changing Arctic environment.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz040,7,NA,NA,coz040,Arctic; blood biochemistry; polar bear; reference interval; serum analytes; wildlife health

To better explore potential mechanisms of tobacco seed deterioration, seed packed in cloth bag (C) and vacuum bag (V) were stored under room temperature (RT) and low temperature (LT, 18 degrees C), and sampled periodically for laboratory testing. Seed stored in low temperature with vacuum bag (LT/V) owned the highest seed vigour after 25 months of storage and in room temperature with cloth bag (RT/C) lost seed vigour and germination ability after 20-month storage. Meanwhile, seed in RT/C notably increased about 5-fold endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), 4-fold malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, 12-fold Lipoxygenases (LOX) activity and 2-fold the expression of NtLOX3 comparing with LT/V at the end of 15-month storage. In addition, regression analysis indicated that LOX activity was strongly negatively correlated with seed vigour as the R-2 value reached 0.970 in RT/C. Furthermore, caffeic acid and catechin, the inhibitors of LOX activity, were applied to tobacco seeds pre-treatment and followed with artificial accelerated aging. Seeds pretreated with inhibitors, especially caffeic acid, reduced LOX activity by 50\%, MDA and H2O2 contents by 40\% and 20\%, respectively, and increased more than 1.2-fold seed vigour and seedling quality comparing with seeds pretreated with H2O after 6-day artificial aging, indicating a better seed storability after artificial accelerated aging.

The stock has fluctuated in the past few decades and this variation has been attributed to human pressures and climate change. To investigate energetics of individuals and population dynamics of the species in responses to environmental variations and fishing efforts, we have developed a DEB-IBM by coupling a dynamic energy budget (DEB) model to an individual-based model (IBM). The parameter estimation of DEB model shows an acceptable goodness of fit. The DEB-IBM was validated with histological data for a period of 38 years. High fishing pressure was largely responsible for the dramatic decline of the stock in middle 1980s. The stock recovered from early 1990s, which coincided with introduction of fishing moratorium on spawning stocks in inshore waters and substantial decrease of fishing efforts from large fisheries companies. In addition, the population average age showed a trend of slight decrease. The model successfully reproduced these observations of interannual variations in the population dynamics. The model was then implemented to simulate the effect of climate change on the population performance under greenhouse gas emission scenarios projected for 2100. It was also used to explore population responses to changing fishing mortalities. These scenario simulations have shown that the population biomass under SSP1-1.9, SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 would decline by 7.5\%, 16.6\% and 30.1\%, respectively, in 2100. The model predicts that increasing fishing mortality by 10\% will cause 5.3\% decline of the population biomass, whereas decrease of fishing mortality by 10\% will result in 6.8\% increase of the biomass. The development of the DEB-IBM provides a predictive tool to inform management decisions for sustainable exploitation of the hairtail stock in the East China Sea.",2022,10.1093/conphys/coac044,10,1,NA,coac044,population model; human pressure; fisheries; environment; DEB model
article,Diet and nutritional status during early adult life have immediate and persistent effects on queen bumble bees,"Woodard, S. Hollis and Duennes, Michelle A. and Watrous, Kristal M. and Jha, Shalene",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Many insects sequester nutrients during developmentally programmed periods, which they metabolize during subsequent life history stages. During these periods, failure to store adequate nutrients can have persistent effects on fitness. Here, we examined a critical but under-studied nutrient storage period in queen bumble bees: the first days of adult life, which are followed by a diapause period typically coinciding with winter. We experimentally manipulated availability of pollen (the primary dietary source of lipids and protein) and the sugar concentration of artificial nectar (the primary source of carbohydrates) for laboratory-reared queens during this period and examined three nutritional phenomena: (i) diet impacts on nutritional status, (ii) the timescale upon which nutrient sequestration occurs and (iii) the fitness consequences of nutrient sequestration, specifically related to survival across the life cycle. We found evidence that pollen and nectar starvation negatively impact lipid storage, whereas nectar sugar concentration impacts stored carbohydrates. The majority of nutrients were stored during the first similar to 3 days of adult life. Nutrients derived from pollen during this period appear to be more critical for surviving earlier life stages, whereas nutrients sequestered from nectar become more important for surviving the diapause and post-diapause periods. Negative impacts of a poor diet during early life persisted in our experiment, even when pollen and a relatively high (50\%) nectar sugar concentration were provided post-diapause. Based on these findings, we posit that the nutritional environment during the early adult life of queens has both immediate and persistent impacts on fitness. These findings underscore the importance of examining effects of stage-specific nutritional limitations on physiology and life history traits in this social insect group. Moreover, the findings may shed light on how declining food resources are contributing to the decline of wild bumble bee populations.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz048,7,NA,NA,coz048,Bees; diapause; nutrition
article,"The influence of tourist visitation on the heterophyl to lymphocyte ratios and trophic values of Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) at Martillo Island, Argentina","Harris, Sabrina and Scioscia, Gabriela and Rey, Andrea Raya",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Stress levels measured by heterophile to lymphocyte ratios of adult and chick Magellanic penguins Spheniscus magellanicus from Martillo Island were higher in areas exposed versus not exposed to tourism, except for 2020. Stress levels were also lower with lower trophic values for all individuals. Wildlife tourism is increasing worldwide and monitoring the impact of tourism on wild populations is of the utmost importance for species conservation. The Magellanic penguin Spheniscus magellanicus colony at Martillo Island, Argentina, was studied in the 2016-2020 breeding seasons. In all seasons, adults and chicks belonged to: (i) an area close to or within the tourist trail or (ii) an area far from the tourist trail and out of sight of the tourists. Blood samples were taken for carbon and nitrogen stable isotope composition, in order to estimate trophic niches, and for smears that were made in situ and were then stained in the laboratory where leucocyte counts and differentiation were made under optical microscope. Heterophil to lymphocyte ratios were used as proxies of stress. Repeated sampling showed individual stress levels reduced while wintering. In 2017, stress levels and trophic values were lower than 2018 for the same individuals. Trophic levels did not differ between tourism and no tourism areas within each season, and differed between 2017 and the remaining seasons, indicating a possible diet shift that year. Stress levels were higher for the tourism area than the no tourism area for adults and chicks in all years except for 2020, when stress levels in the tourism area were lower and similar to the no tourism area that year and previous years. Vessel transit within the Beagle Channel and tourist visitation to the penguin colony was greatly reduced in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

article,"Rhinoceros serum labile plasma iron and associated redox potential: interspecific variation, sex bias and iron overload disorder disconnect","Roth, Terri L. and Philpott, Megan and Wojtusik, Jessye",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"A consequence of the poaching crisis is that managed rhinoceros populations are increasingly important for species conservation. However, black rhinoceroses (BR; Diceros bicornis) and Sumatran rhinoceroses (SR; Dicerorhinus Sumatrensis) in human care often store excessive iron in organ tissues, a condition termed iron overload disorder (IOD). IOD research is impeded by the challenge of accurately monitoring body iron load in living rhinoceroses. The goals of this study were to (i) determine if labile plasma iron (LPI) is an accurate IOD biomarker and (ii) identify factors associated with iron-independent serum oxidative reduction potential (ORP). Serum (106 samples) from SRs (n = 8), BRs (n = 28), white rhinoceros (n = 24) and greater one-horned rhinoceros (GOH; n = 16) was analysed for LPI. Samples from all four species tested positive for LPI, and a higher proportion of GOH rhinoceros samples were LPI positive compared with those of the other three species (P < 0.05). In SRs, the only LPI-positive samples were those from individuals clinically ill with IOD, but samples from outwardly healthy individuals of the other three species were LPI positive. Serum ORP was lower in SRs compared with that in the other three species (P < 0.001), and iron chelation only reduced ORP in the GOH species (P < 0.01; similar to 5\%). Serum ORP sex bias was revealed in three species with males exhibiting higher ORP than females (P < 0.001), the exception being the SR in which ORP was low for both sexes. ORP was not associated with age or serum iron concentrations (P >= 0.05), but was positively correlated with ferritin (P < 0.01). The disconnect between LPI and IOD was unanticipated, and LPI cannot be recommended as a biomarker of advanced rhino IOD. However, data provide valuable insight into the complex puzzle of rhinoceros IOD.",2022,10.1093/conphys/coac025,10,1,NA,coac025,NA

We hypothesize, however, that a cannibal feeding strategy may confer performance advantages over a non-cannibal feeding strategy and that perhaps cannibal size grading may not be optimal for hatcheries focusing on conservation goals. This study examined metabolic performance differences between cannibal and non-cannibal burbot, Lota lota maculosa, at the Kootenai Tribe of Idaho Twin Rivers Hatchery in Moyie Springs, ID, USA. After habitat alteration led to functional extinction of burbot in the region, the Twin Rivers Hatchery has played a leading role in the reestablishment of burbot in the Kootenai River, ID, and British Columbia. We examined morphometric data (weight, length and condition factor), whole animal resting metabolic rate and the enzyme activity of lactate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase to describe the baseline metabolic performance of cannibal and non-cannibal burbot. Taken together, our results demonstrated significant differences in the metabolic strategies of cannibal vs. non-cannibal burbot, where cannibals relied more heavily on carbohydrate metabolism and non-cannibals relied more heavily on glycolytic and lipid metabolism. This study demonstrates the need to reevaluate the traditional practice of removing cannibal fish in conservation hatcheries, as it may not be the ideal strategy of raising the most robust individuals for release.

The objectives of this study were to (1) document reference intervals of packed cell volume (PCV) and 20 plasma chemistry analytes from wild oceanic-juvenile stage loggerhead turtles from Azorean waters, (2) investigate correlations with body size (minimum straight carapace length: SCLmin) and (3) compare plasma chemistry data to those from older, larger neritic juveniles (<80 cm SCLmin) and adult loggerheads (>= 80 cm SCLmin) that have recruited to the West Atlantic in waters around Cape Canaveral, Florida. Twenty-eight Azorean loggerhead turtles with SCLmin of 17.6-60.0 cm (mean 34.9 +/- 12.1 cm) were captured, sampled and immediately released. Reference intervals are reported. There were several biologically relevant correlations of blood analytes with SCLmin: positive correlations of PCV, proteins and triglycerides with SCLmin indicated somatic growth, increasing diving activity and/or diet; negative correlations of tissue enzymes with SCLmin suggested faster growth at smaller turtle size, while negative correlations of electrolytes with SCLmin indicated differences in diet, environmental conditions and/or osmoregulation unique to the geographic location. Comparisons of loggerhead turtles from the Azores (i.e. oceanic) and Cape Canaveral (i.e. neritic) identified significant differences regarding diet, somatic growth, and/or environment: in Azorean turtles, albumin, triglycerides and bilirubin increased with SCLmin, while alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase and sodium decreased. In larger neritic Cape Canaveral turtles, aspartate aminotransferase increased with SCLmin, while the albumin: globulin ratio, phosphorus and cholesterol decreased. These differences suggest unique physiological disparities between life stage development and migration, reflecting biological and habitat differences between the two populations.

Failure to consider the importance of scale in conservation physiology-both the challenges and the opportunities that it creates-will impede the ability of this discipline to generate the scientific understanding needed to contribute to meaningful conservation outcomes. Here, we have focused on five aspects of scale: biological, spatial, temporal, allometric and phylogenetic. We also considered the scale of policy and policy application relevant to those five types of scale as well as the merits of upscaling and downscaling to explore and address conservation problems. Although relevant to all systems (e.g. freshwater, terrestrial) we have used examples from the marine realm, with a particular emphasis on fishes, given the fact that there is existing discourse regarding scale and its relevance for marine conservation and management. Our synthesis revealed that all five aspects of scale are relevant to conservation physiology, with many aspects inherently linked. It is apparent that there are both opportunities and challenges afforded by working across scales but, to understand mechanisms underlying conservation problems, it is essential to consider scale of all sorts and to work across scales to the greatest extent possible. Moreover, given that the scales in biological processes will often not match policy and management scales, conservation physiology needs to show how it is relevant to aspects at different policy/management scales, change the scales at which policy/management intervention is applied or be prepared to be ignored.",2014,10.1093/conphys/cou024,2,1,NA,cou024,Body size; downscaling; marine; scale; upscaling

article,Comparative genomics of cetartiodactyla: energy metabolism underpins the transition to an aquatic lifestyle,"Derous, Davina and Sahu, Jagajjit and Douglas, Alex and Lusseau, David and Wenzel, Marius",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Foraging disruption caused by human activities is emerging as a key issue in cetacean conservation because it can affect nutrient levels and the amount of energy available to individuals to invest into reproduction. Our ability to predict how anthropogenic stressors affect these ecological processes and ultimately population trajectory depends crucially on our understanding of the complex physiological mechanisms that detect nutrient availability and regulate energy metabolism, foraging behavior and life-history decisions. These physiological mechanisms are likely to differ considerably from terrestrial mammalian model systems. Here, we examine nucleotide substitution rates in cetacean and other artiodactyl genomes to identify signatures of selection in genes associated with nutrient sensing pathways. We also estimated the likely physiological consequences of adaptive amino acid substitutions for pathway functions. Our results highlight that genes involved in the insulin, mTOR and NF-kB pathways are subject to significant positive selection in cetaceans compared to terrestrial artiodactyla. These genes may have been positively selected to enable cetaceans to adapt to a glucose-poor diet, to overcome deleterious effects caused by hypoxia during diving (e.g. oxidative stress and inflammation) and to modify fat-depot signaling functions in a manner different to terrestrial mammals. We thus show that adaptation in cetaceans to an aquatic lifestyle significantly affected functions in nutrient sensing pathways. The use of fat stores as a condition index in cetaceans may be confounded by the multiple and critical roles fat has in regulating cetacean metabolism, foraging behavior and diving physiology.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coaa136,9,NA,NA,coaa136,Cetaceans; energy metabolism; evolution; insulin; mTOR; NF-kB

Here, we explored the influence of the sex, age, reproductive season and seasonal food availability on the parasitism and stress physiology in wild giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) through nutrient and steroid hormone analysis and parasitic infection measurement. Diet composition had significant influences on the faecal cortisol levels and parasite load of wild giant pandas. The seasonal dynamic of the cortisol levels and parasite load in faeces co-vary with the seasonal nutrient intake levels of the pandas, which concurrently arrived the peaks at the wood bamboo shoot-eating period in May (parasite infection intensity, 41.47 +/- 12.11 eggs/g of wet faeces; cortisol levels, 619.34 +/- 70.55 ng/g dry faeces) that the nutrition intake by wild pandas was the highest (protein/fibre, 69.23 +/- 9.93). Meanwhile, age class is also as an important factor to affect the parasite load and stress physiology of wild giant pandas. Cubs and sub-adults suffered more helminth burden and stress physiology than adults and old individuals. This is the first study to evaluate the inner and external factors influence on parasitism and stress physiology in wild giant pandas.

article,Predicting the vulnerability of birds to trophic threat posed by phenological mismatch based on nutritional and physiological status of nestlings,"Zhang, Shuping and Zhao, Lidan and Zhang, Xinjie and Liang, Wei",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Climate change induced phenological mismatches between nestlings and their optimal food resources have been found to negatively influence the survival of many bird species. Discriminating which species is vulnerable to such threat is difficult only based on the diet observation, and therefore it is necessary to establish a more reliable method to predict the vulnerability of bird species. In the case of Asian short-toed lark (Calandrella cheleensis), we predicted such vulnerability by evaluating whether nestlings can absorb equal level of nutrients from different diets and maintain equal physiological status. We compared the diet, plasma nutrients, plasma insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), body mass and survival rate of nestlings hatched under different optimal food (grasshopper nymph) abundance conditions in two breeding seasons. Plasma glucides, amino acids, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites, some fatty acids, IGF-1, body mass and survival rate of the nestlings hatched under medium or low nymph abundance conditions were significantly lower than those of nestlings hatched under high nymph abundance condition. The relative abundance of plasma amino acids, glucides, TCA cycle metabolites and fatty acids were significantly, and positively, correlated with IGF-1 levels, which, in turn, was positively correlated with nestling body mass. These results indicate that the diet with low optimal food proportion was nutritionally inferior to the diet with high optimal food proportion and inhibited the growth of nestlings. Species like Asian short-toed lark is vulnerable to the trophic threat induced by phenological mismatch because the alternative food is insufficient to satisfy the nutritional requirement of nestlings.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz096,7,NA,NA,coz096,birds; nutritional quality; phenological mismatch; trophic threat; vulnerability

Stress stimulates the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and synthesis of glucocorticoid (GC) hormones, which increase energy substrate availability while suppressing energy-intensive processes. Exposure to repeated stressors can potentially affect an animal's ability to respond to and recover from subsequent challenges. To mimic repeated activation of the HPA axis by environmental stressors (or challenges), we administered adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) to free-ranging juvenile northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris; n = 7) once daily for 4 days. ACTH administration induced significant elevation in circulating cortisol and aldosterone levels. The cortisol responses did not vary in magnitude between the first ACTH administration on Day 1 and the last administration on Day 4. In contrast, aldosterone levels remained elevated above baseline for at least 24 h after each ACTH injection, and responses were greater on Day 4 than Day 1. Total triiodothyronine (tT3) levels were decreased on Day 4 relative to Day 1, while reverse triiodothyronine (rT3) concentrations increased relative to baseline on Days 1 and 4 in response to ACTH, indicating a suppression of thyroid hormone production. There was no effect of ACTH on the sex steroid dehydroepiandrosterone. These data suggest that elephant seals are able to mount adrenal responses to multiple ACTH administrations. However, repeated ACTH administration resulted in facilitation of aldosterone secretion and suppression of tT3, which may impact osmoregulation and metabolism, respectively. We propose that aldosterone and tT3 are informative additional indicators of repeated stress in marine mammals.",2018,10.1093/conphys/coy040,6,NA,NA,coy040,Aldosterone; cortisol; ACTH; HPA axis; marine mammals; stress; thyroid

Umbilical wounds typically heal within 1 to 2 months post-parturition, depending on the species, and are therefore often used as an indicator of neonatal life stage or as a relative measure of age {[}e.g. grouping by umbilical wound classes (UWCs), according to the size of their umbilicus]. To improve comparisons of early-life characteristics between studies, species and across populations, studies using UWCs should integrate quantitative changes. To overcome this issue, we set out to quantify changes in umbilicus size of neonatal blacktip reef sharks (Carcharhinus melanopterus) around the island of Moorea, French Polynesia, based on temporal regression relationships of umbilicus size. Here, we provide a detailed description for the construction of similar quantitative umbilical wound classifications, and we subsequently validate the accuracy of our classification and discuss two examples to illustrate its efficacy, depletion rate of maternally provided energy reserves and estimation of parturition period. A significant decrease in body condition in neonatal sharks as early as twelve days post-parturition suggests a rapid depletion of in utero-allocated energy reserves stored in the liver. Back calculations of timing of birth based on the umbilicus size of neonates determine a parturition season from September to January, with most parturitions occurring during October and November. As such, this study contributes valuable data to inform the conservation and management of young-of-the-year blacktip reef sharks, and we therefore encourage the construction and use of similar regression relationships for other viviparous shark species. Live-bearing shark species are inherently born with an open wound, the umbilicus. The healing status of this umbilicus can be used to estimate the age of newborn sharks. This study proposes the first umbilical wound classification based on quantitative changes in umbilicus size allowing accurate age estimates of newborn sharks.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad028,11,1,NA,coad028,wound healing; parturition; French Polynesia; elasmobranchs; body condition

T. and Louis, Jr., Edward E. and Crocker, Daniel E.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"We investigated the acute stress response associated with animal personalities by measuring plasma glucocorticoids throughout handling and collected similar to 2 years of movement and behavioural data in a wild, Critically Endangered animal, Astrochelys radiata (radiated tortoise). To determine whether our standard, brief conscientious handling procedures induce a stress response in our target species, we applied a stressor by way of initial animal processing and deployment of telemetry equipment. During surveys and processing, we sampled animals immediately upon detection, again after completing transmitter attachment and processing, and a final time the following day. We then used radiotelemetry to follow a subset of the animals for 22 months while collecting behavioural, climatic and location data. We found that brief and conscientious handling did not illicit consistent changes in plasma concentrations of the stress hormone corticosterone (CORT) but did reveal tremendous individual variation in response. The CORT concentration ranged more than 200-fold after imposing the stressor and returned to near-baseline values by the following day. When we accounted for the wide variation by calculating the degree of each individual's stress response relative to its baseline over its processing time, we discovered two non-overlapping physiological response types; those in which CORT concentrations increased dramatically in response to handling (219 +/- 89.8 pg/ml/min) and those in which CORT varied only slightly (5.3 +/- 8.9 pg/ml/min). The response types (strong vs. mild) also predicted body condition, home range size, activity, and behavioural tendencies. The degree of the individual's stress response in this species may be one component of correlated physiological and behavioural traits (animal personalities), which have previously been obscured in other chelonian studies by the use of mean values and should be considered in future conservation management applications for chelonian species.",2017,10.1093/conphys/cox008,5,NA,NA,cox008,Animal personality; Astrochelys; corticosterone; ecophysiology; Madagascar; radiated tortoise

We assessed the animals' BCS visually on a scale of 1 to 5; where 1 represents a very thin and 5 represents a very fat elephant. To understand the influence of seasonality on BCS, we sampled the population during dry (n = 398) and wet seasons (n = 255) of 2013 and 2015 while, for annual changes in BCS, we sampled nine free-ranging adult females from different family groups that had been repeatedly sighted over seven years. To evaluate the influence of body condition on fGCM, 307 faecal samples were collected from 261 different elephants and were analysed. As a parameter of adrenocortical activity, and thus stress, fGCM was measured (mu g/g) in the ethanol-extracted samples using a group-specific 11-oxoaetiocholanolone EIA (antibody raised against 11-oxoaetiocholanolone-17-CMO: BSA and biotinylated-11-oxoaetiocholanolone as a label). Effect of age and season on BCS in relation to fGCM was also studied. A seasonal shift in BCS was observed as expected, i.e. individuals with low BCS were more frequent during the dry season when compared with the wet season. Concentrations of fGCM were highest in individuals with lowest BCS (BCS 1) and then significantly declined till BCS 3. fGCM levels were almost comparable for BCS 3, 4 and 5. This pattern was more conspicuous in female than in male elephants. Season-dependent BCS, hence, reflect the stress status as measured by fGCM, especially in female Asian elephants.

One of the most popular methods for non-invasive monitoring of animal endocrine status is the glucocorticoid (GC) metabolite measurements, which can provide important information about how animals are affected by their surrounding environment. Here, we carried out the biological validation of corticosterone enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), which together with a cortisol EIA was used to quantified the concentrations of urofaecal GC metabolites (uGCMs) in wild and captive Blue-fronted amazon parrots (Amazona aestiva).

The higher uGCM levels obtained in the wild population point to an adaptive response for survival and species propagation in a more challenging environment, in comparison with captive animals. Furthermore, the lower uGCM concentrations in captive parrots may indicate an adaptive capacity of the species A. aestiva to captivity and its potential as a legal pet.

There was a significant negative relationship between the health of nestlings and percentage loss of native vegetation around nest hollows. While the usual clutch size is two, average clutch size tended to be lower in areas where much native vegetation has been cleared. While both eggs hatch in 77\% of two-egg clutches, the species normally fledges only one young. However, the species is capable of fledging both nestlings from a breeding attempt.

In this study, we measured five markers of oxidative status in the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), a carnivore species classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. We asked whether the five measures of oxidative damage and antioxidant blood-based markers are associated with a number of socioecological and environmental factors, including individual sex, age class, living condition (free-ranging vs. captive), restraint duration stress (i.e. capture duration stress), spatial tactic of males (territory holders vs. non-territory holders, i.e. floaters) and reproductive status of females (accompanied by offspring vs. solitary). Markers of oxidative damage were higher in those cheetahs that were physically restraint for a longer duration in the trap, indicating that oxidative stress may be increased by short-term unpredictable environmental stressors. Markers of oxidative damage were also higher in captive than free-ranging cheetahs, suggesting that oxidative stress might be a physiological mechanism underlying the detrimental effects of captivity on the health status of cheetahs.

Matriarchs are generally older females that guide their families to resources and co-ordinate group defense. While much is known about elephant society, knowledge is generally lacking about how age affects the physiology of wild elephants. Investigation of the ovarian activity of free-ranging elephants could provide insight into the reproductive ageing process, with implications for population management. Faecal samples were collected from 46 individuals ranging in age from 14 to 60 years for a 2-year period, and progestagen metabolite analyses were used to examine relationships between social status, age, season, and ovarian activity in female elephants in Addo Elephant National Park, South Africa. Social status was the strongest predictor of faecal progestagen metabolite concentrations in non-pregnant elephants, with grand matriarchs (n = 6) having the lowest values compared with matriarchs (n = 21) and non-matriarch females (n = 19). Likewise, social status and age were the strongest predictors of faecal progestagen metabolite concentrations in pregnant elephants (n = 27). The number of years since a nonpregnant female gave birth to her last calf (post-partum duration) was longer for older females with a higher social status, as well as during the dry season. Our results indicate that social standing and age of elephants are related to reproductive function, and that older females exhibit reductions in ovarian capacity. These results expand our understanding of reproduction and fertility throughout an elephant's lifespan, and the factors that impact gonadal function in free-ranging females.

While emerging molecular tools could improve our diagnostic capabilities and give insight into mechanisms underlying wildlife disease risk, they have rarely been applied in practice. Here, employing a previously reported gene transcription panel of common immune markers to track physiological changes, we present a detailed analysis over the course of both acute and chronic infection in one wildlife species where disease plays a critical role in conservation, bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis). Differential gene transcription patterns distinguished between infection statuses over the course of acute infection and differential correlation (DC) analyses identified clear changes in gene co-transcription patterns over the early stages of infection, with transcription of four genes-TGFb, AHR, IL1b and MX1-continuing to increase even as transcription of other immune-associated genes waned. In a separate analysis, we considered the capacity of the same gene transcription panel to aid in differentiating between chronically infected animals and animals in other disease states outside of acute disease events (an immediate priority for wildlife management in this system). We found that this transcription panel was capable of accurately identifying chronically infected animals in the test dataset, though additional data will be required to determine how far this ability extends. Taken together, our results showcase the successful proof of concept and breadth of potential utilities that gene transcription might provide to wildlife disease management, from direct insight into mechanisms associated with differential disease response to improved diagnostic capacity in the field.",2022,10.1093/conphys/coac046,10,1,NA,coac046,NA

E. and Strona, A. L. S. and Leiner, N. O. and Suzan, G. and Romano, M. C.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of environmental (dry versus wet season) and individual (sex, body mass and reproductive status) factors in the levels of faecal cortisol metabolites (FGCs) in Gracilinanus agilis faecal samples as an index of stress levels in this species; as well as its association with abundance of Eimeria spp, as an indicator of immunocompetence against parasites. Our study found that FGCFGCs are a reliable indicator of adrenal activity in G. agilis. We found that FGCFGCs increase considerably by environmental stressors like the dry season. Moreover, the observed positive association between FGCs and body mass is the result of the effect of season and reproduction in both variables. We also demonstrated that an increase in FGC levels among G. agilis during the dry season is associated with a rise in the probability of being infected by Eimeria spp. Hence, our finding supports the corticosteroid-fitness hypothesis, which predicts that increased glucocorticoids as a response to stressors usually results in decreased fitness of individuals, translated into low future survival and reproductive success, and higher parasite infection. To our knowledge, this is the first study that integrates environmental changes, hormone responses and parasite loads in a US marsupial in both empirical and experimental approaches.",2018,10.1093/conphys/coy021,6,NA,NA,coy021,Didelphidae; glucocorticoids; parasitism; reproduction; seasonality; semelparity
article,"Get the most out of blow hormones: validation of sampling materials, field storage and extraction techniques for whale respiratory vapour samples","Burgess, Elizabeth A. and Hunt, Kathleen E. and Kraus, Scott D. and Rolland, Rosalind M.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Studies are progressively showing that vital physiological data may be contained in the respiratory vapour (blow) of cetaceans. Nonetheless, fundamental methodological issues need to be addressed before hormone analysis of blow can become a reliable technique. In this study, we performed controlled experiments in a laboratory setting, using known doses of pure parent hormones, to validate several technical factors that may play a crucial role in hormone analyses. We evaluated the following factors: (i) practical field storage of samples on small boats during daylong trips; (ii) efficiency of hormone extraction methods; and (iii) assay interference of different sampler types (i.e. veil nylon, nitex nylon mesh and polystyrene dish). Sampling materials were dosed with mock blow samples of known mixed hormone concentrations (progesterone, 17 beta-estradiol, testosterone, cortisol, aldosterone and triiodothyronine), designed to mimic endocrine profiles characteristic of pregnant females, adult males, an adrenal glucocorticoid response or a zero-hormone control (distilled H2O). Results showed that storage of samples in a cooler on ice preserved hormone integrity for at least 6 h (P = 0.18). All sampling materials and extraction methods yielded the correct relative patterns for all six hormones. However, veil and nitex mesh produced detectable assay interference (mean 0.22 +/- 0.04 and 0.18 +/- 0.03 ng/ml, respectively), possibly caused by some nylon-based component affecting antibody binding. Polystyrene dishes were the most efficacious sampler for accuracy and precision (P < 0.001), but required an ethanol rinse for improved progesterone recovery (increased 81\%; P < 0.001). Awareness of assay interference from exogenous materials is crucial to future studies. This study establishes critical groundwork to help ensure that hormones can be measured accurately in samples obtained from field collections of whale blow.",2016,10.1093/conphys/cow024,4,NA,NA,cow024,Blow; cetacean; hormone analysis; technique validation
article,Developmental phenotypic plasticity helps bridge stochastic weather events associated with climate change,"Burggren, Warren",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The slow, inexorable rise in annual average global temperatures and acidification of the oceans are often advanced as consequences of global change. However, many environmental changes, especially those involving weather (as opposed to climate), are often stochastic, variable and extreme, particularly in temperate terrestrial or freshwater habitats. Moreover, few studies of animal and plant phenotypic plasticity employ realistic (i.e. short-term, stochastic) environmental change in their protocols. Here, I posit that the frequently abrupt environmental changes (days, weeks, months) accompanying much longer-term general climate change (e.g. global warming over decades or centuries) require consideration of the true nature of environmental change (as opposed to statistical means) coupled with an expansion of focus to consider developmental phenotypic plasticity. Such plasticity can be in multiple forms - obligatory/facultative, beneficial/deleterious - depending upon the degree and rate of environmental variability at specific points in organismal development. Essentially, adult phenotypic plasticity, as important as it is, will be irrelevant if developing offspring lack sufficient plasticity to create modified phenotypes necessary for survival.",2018,10.1242/jeb.161984,221,9,NA,jeb161984,Global warming; Ocean acidification; Developmental plasticity; Climate variability

Marine bivalves such as the hard-shell clam, Mercenaria mercenaria, serve as ecosystem engineers in estuaries and coastal zones of the western Atlantic and, as for many marine calcifiers, are sensitive to the impacts of ocean acidification. In estuaries, the effects of ocean acidification can be exacerbated by low buffering capacity of brackish waters, acidic inputs from freshwaters and land, and/or the negative effects of salinity on the physiology of organisms. We determined the interactive effects of 21 weeks of exposure to different levels of CO2 (similar to 395, 800 and 1500 mu atm corresponding to pH of 8.2, 8.1 and 7.7, respectively) and salinity (32 versus 16) on biomineralization, shell properties and energy metabolism of juvenile hard-shell clams. Low salinity had profound effects on survival, energy metabolism and biomineralization of hard-shell clams and modulated their responses to elevated P-CO2. Negative effects of low salinity in juvenile clams were mostly due to the strongly elevated basal energy demand, indicating energy deficiency, that led to reduced growth, elevated mortality and impaired shell maintenance (evidenced by the extensive damage to the periostracum). The effects of elevated P-CO2 on physiology and biomineralization of hard-shell clams were more complex. Elevated P-CO2 (similar to 800-1500 mu atm) had no significant effects on standard metabolic rates (indicative of the basal energy demand), but affected growth and shell mechanical properties in juvenile clams. Moderate hypercapnia (similar to 800 mu atm P-CO2) increased shell and tissue growth and reduced mortality of juvenile clams in high salinity exposures; however, these effects were abolished under the low salinity conditions or at high P-CO2 (similar to 1500 mu atm). Mechanical properties of the shell (measured as microhardness and fracture toughness of the shells) were negatively affected by elevated CO2 alone or in combination with low salinity, which may have important implications for protection against predators or environmental stressors. Our data indicate that environmental salinity can strongly modulate responses to ocean acidification in hard-shell clams and thus should be taken into account when predicting the effects of ocean acidification on estuarine bivalves.",2013,10.1242/jeb.082909,216,14,2607-2618,NA,ocean acidification; salinity; estuary; standard metabolic rate; biomineralization; shell properties; mollusks

Colonial organisms might be particularly resilient to environmental stressors, as organizational modularity and successive asexual generations can allow for distinctively flexible responses in the aggregate form. We performed laboratory experiments to examine the effects of increasing dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) (i.e. ocean acidification) on the colonial bryozoan Celleporella cornuta sampled from two source populations within a coastal upwelling region of the northern California coast. Bryozoan colonies were remarkably plastic under these CO2 treatments. Colonies raised under high CO2 grew more quickly, investing less in reproduction and producing lighter skeletons when compared with genetically identical clones raised under current surface atmosphere CO2 values. Bryozoans held under high CO2 conditions also changed the Mg/Ca ratio of skeletal calcite and increased the expression of organic coverings in new growth, which may serve as protection against acidified water. We also observed strong differences between source populations in reproductive investment and organic covering reaction norms, consistent with adaptive responses to persistent spatial variation in local oceanographic conditions. Our results demonstrate that phenotypic plasticity and energetic tradeoffs can mediate biological responses to global environmental change, and highlight the broad range of strategies available to colonial organisms.",2017,10.1242/jeb.163436,220,23,4399-4409,NA,Phenotypic plasticity; Acclimatization; Colonial growth forms; Calcification; Global environmental change; Regional oceanography

It is thought that changes in Cl- and HCO3- gradients across neural membranes interfere with the function of GABA-gated anion channels (GABA(A) receptors). So far, such alterations have been revealed experimentally by exposing species living in low-CO2 environments, like many oceanic habitats, to high levels of CO2 (hypercapnia). To examine the generality of this phenomenon, we set out to study the opposite situation, hypothesizing that fishes living in typically hypercapnic environments also display behavioural alterations if exposed to low CO2 levels. This would indicate that ion regulation in the fish brain is fine-tuned to the prevailing CO2 conditions. We quantified pH regulatory variables and behavioural responses of Pangasianodon hypophthalmus, a fish native to the hypercapnic Mekong River, acclimated to high-CO2 (3.1 kPa) or low-CO2 (0.04 kPa) water. We found that brain and blood pH was actively regulated and that the low-CO2 fish displayed significantly higher activity levels, which were reduced after treatment with gabazine, a GABAA receptor blocker. This indicates an involvement of the GABAA receptor and altered Cl-and HCO3- ion gradients. Indeed, Goldman calculations suggest that low levels of environmental CO2 may cause significant changes in neural ion gradients in P. hypophthalmus. Taken together, the results suggest that brain ion regulation in fishes is fine-tuned to the prevailing ambient CO2 conditions and is prone to disruption if these conditions change.",2016,10.1242/jeb.131375,219,1,109-118,NA,Pangasianodon hypophthalmus; Acid-base regulation; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Gabazine

In water breathers, this response occurs primarily by reducing plasma HCO3- levels with small changes in the partial pressure of CO2 (P-CO2). In contrast, air breathers mediate the decrease in pHa by increasing arterial P-CO2 (Pa-CO2) at constant plasma HCO3- by reducing lung ventilation relative to metabolic CO2 production. Much less is known about bimodal breathers, which utilize both water and air. Here, we characterized the influence of temperature on arterial acid-base balance and intracellular pH (pH(i)) in the bimodal-breathing swamp eel, Monopterus albus. This teleost uses the buccopharyngeal cavity for gas exchange and has very reduced gills. When exposed to ecologically relevant temperatures (20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C) for 24 and 48 h, pHa decreased by -0.025 pH units (U) degrees C-1 in association with an increase in Pa-CO2 but without changes in plasma [}HCO3-]. pH(i) was also reduced with increased temperature. The slope of pH, of liver and muscle was -0.014 and -0.019 U degrees C-1, while the heart muscle showed a smaller reduction (-0.008 U degrees C-1). When exposed to hypercapnia (7 or 14 mmHg) at either 25 or 35 degrees C, M. albus elevated plasma {[}HCO3-] and therefore seemed to defend the new pHa set-point, demonstrating an adjusted control of acid-base balance with temperature. Overall, the effects of temperature on acid-base balance in M. albus resemble those in air-breathing amniotes, and we discuss the possibility that this pattern of acid-base balance results from a progressive transition in CO2 excretion from water to air as temperature rises.",2018,10.1242/jeb.172551,221,10,NA,jeb172551,P-CO2; Bimodal breathing; Blood gases; Intracellular pH

S. and Turner, Lucy M. and Widdicombe, Stephen and Spicer, I, John",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Regulation of extracellular acid-base balance, while maintaining energy metabolism, is recognised as an important aspect when defining an organism's sensitivity to environmental changes. This study investigated the haemolymph buffering capacity and energy metabolism (oxygen consumption, haemolymph {[}L-lactate] and {[} protein]) in early benthic juveniles (carapace length <40 mm) of the European lobster, Homarus gammarus, exposed to elevated temperature and P-CO2. At 13 degrees C, H. gammarus juveniles were able to fully compensate for acid-base disturbances caused by the exposure to elevated seawater P-CO2 at levels associated with ocean acidification and carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) leakage scenarios, via haemolymph {[}HCO3-] regulation. However, metabolic rate remained constant and food consumption decreased under elevated P-CO2, indicating reduced energy availability. Juveniles at 17 degrees C showed no ability to actively compensate haemolymph pH, resulting in decreased haemolymph pH particularly under CCS conditions. Early benthic juvenile lobsters at 17 degrees C were not able to increase energy intake to offset increased energy demand and therefore appear to be unable to respond to acid-base disturbances due to increased P-CO2 at elevated temperature. Analysis of haemolymph metabolites suggests that, even under control conditions, juveniles were energetically limited. They exhibited high haemolymph {[}L-lactate], indicating recourse to anaerobic metabolism. Low haemolymph {[}protein] was linked to minimal non-bicarbonate buffering and reduced oxygen transport capacity. We discuss these results in the context of potential impacts of ongoing ocean change and CCS leakage scenarios on the development of juvenile H. gammarus and future lobster populations and stocks.",2020,10.1242/jeb.209221,223,8,NA,jeb209221,Developmental physiology; Ocean acidification; Ocean warming; Early benthic juvenile; Acid-base balance; Metabolism

Dark respiration was enhanced by increased flow and increased oxygen saturation in an interactive way, which relates to improved oxygen influx into the coral tissue. Oxygen saturation did not influence net photosynthesis: neither hypoxia nor hyperoxia affected net photosynthesis, irrespective of flow and pH, which suggests that hyperoxia does not induce high rates of photorespiration in this coral. Flow and pH had a synergistic effect on net photosynthesis: at high flow, a decrease in pH stimulated net photosynthesis by 14\%. These results indicate that for this individual of G. fascicularis, increased uptake of carbon dioxide rather than increased efflux of oxygen explains the beneficial effect of water flow on photosynthesis.

We investigated prioritization of abiotic factors in the gas exchange control cascade by examining oxygen, water and haemolymph pH regulation in the grasshopper Paracinema tricolor. Using a full-factorial design, grasshoppers were acclimated to hypoxic or hyperoxic (5\% O-2, 40\% O-2) gas conditions, or dehydrated or hydrated, whereafter their CO2 release was measured under a range of O-2 and relative humidity (RH) conditions (5\%, 21\%, 40\% O-2 and 5\%, 60\%, 90\% RH). DGE was significantly less common in grasshoppers acclimated to dehydrating conditions compared with the other acclimations (hypoxia, 98\%; hyperoxia, 100\%; hydrated, 100\%; dehydrated, 67\%). Acclimation to dehydrating conditions resulted in a significant decrease in haemolymph pH from 7.0 +/- 0.3 to 6.6 +/- 0.1 (mean +/- s.d., P = 0.018) and also significantly increased the open (O)-phase duration under 5\% O-2 treatment conditions (5\% O-2, 44.1 +/- 29.3 min; 40\% O-2, 15.8 +/- 8.0 min; 5\% RH, 17.8 +/- 1.3 min; 60\% RH, 24.0 +/- 9.7 min; 90\% RH, 20.6 +/- 8.9 min). The observed acidosis could potentially explain the extension of the O-phase under low RH conditions, when it would perhaps seem more useful to reduce the O-phase to lower respiratory water loss.

Maximum thermal limits were quantified using critical thermal maxima (CTmax) tests following acclimation to either presentday or end-of-century levels of CO2 for coral reef environments (similar to 500 or similar to 1000 mu atm, respectively). While species differed significantly in their thermal limits, whereby Dischistodus perspicillatus exhibited greater CTmax (37.88 +/- 0.03 degrees C; N=47) than Dascyllus aruanus (37.68 +/- 0.02 degrees C; N=85) and Acanthochromis polyacanthus (36.58 +/- 0.02 degrees C; N=63), end-of-century CO2 had no effect (D. aruanus) or a slightly positive effect (increase in CTmax of 0.16 degrees C in D. perspicillatus and 0.21 degrees C in A. polyacanthus) on CTmax. Contrary to expectations, early-stage juveniles were equally as resilient to CO2 as larger conspecifics, and CTmax was higher at smaller body sizes in two species.

To date, few studies have assessed the physiological impacts of OA on early life-history stages of intertidal organisms, which transition from habitats with fluctuating pH (intertidal zone) to relatively stable (pelagic zone) pH environments. We used the intertidal crab Petrolisthes cinctipes to determine whether metabolic responses to year 2300 predictions for OA vary among early developmental stages and to examine whether the effects were more pronounced in larval stages developing in the open ocean. Oxygen consumption rate, total protein, dry mass, total lipids and C/N were determined in late-stage embryos, zoea I larvae and newly settled juveniles reared in ambient pH (7.93 +/- 0.06) or low pH (7.58 +/- 0.06). After short-term exposure to low pH, embryos displayed 11\% and 6\% lower metabolism and dry mass, respectively, which may have an associated bioenergetic cost of delayed development to hatching. However, metabolic responses appeared to vary among broods, suggesting significant parental effects among the offspring of six females, possibly a consequence of maternal state during egg deposition and genetic differences among broods. Larval and juvenile metabolism were not affected by acute exposure to elevated CO2. Larvae contained 7\% less nitrogen and C/N was 6\% higher in individuals reared at pH. 7.58 for 6 days, representing a possible switch from lipid to protein metabolism under low pH; the metabolic switch appears to fully cover the energetic cost of responding to elevated CO2. Juvenile dry mass was unaffected after 33 days exposure to low pH seawater. Increased tolerance to low pH in zoea I larvae and juvenile stages may be a consequence of enhanced acid-base regulatory mechanisms, allowing greater compensation of extracellular pH changes and thus preventing decreases in metabolism after exposure to elevated P-CO2. The observed variation in responses of P. cinctipes to decreased pH in the present study suggests the potential for this species to adapt to future declines in near-shore pH.",2013,10.1242/jeb.078162,216,8,1412-1422,NA,carbon dioxide; pH; crustacean; respiration; protein; CHN; lipids; larvae; embryo

Adult M. edulis were reared at different combinations of P-CO2 (pH 8.1 and 7.8) and temperature (19, 22 and 25 degrees C) for 2 months.

Notably, elevated temperature enhanced the effects of seawater acidification on these parameters. The shell breaking force significantly decreased under elevated P-CO2, but the effect was not exacerbated by elevated temperature.

Multistressor experiments are critically needed to better understand the sensitivity of marine organisms to these concurrent changes. Growth and survival responses to acidification have been documented for many marine species, but studies that explore underlying physiological mechanisms of carbon dioxide (CO2) sensitivity are less common. We investigated oxygen consumption rates as proxies for metabolic responses in embryos and newly hatched larvae of an estuarine forage fish (Atlantic silverside, Menidia menidia) to factorial combinations of CO(2)xtemperature or CO(2)xoxygen. Metabolic rates of embryos and larvae significantly increased with temperature, but partial pressure of CO2 (P-CO2) alone did not affect metabolic rates in any experiment. However, there was a significant interaction between Poo, and partial pressure of oxygen (P-O2) in embryos, because metabolic rates were unaffected by P-O2 level at ambient P-CO2, but decreased with declining P-O2 under elevated P-CO2. For larvae, however, P-CO2 and P-O2 had no significant effect on metabolic rates. Our findings suggest high individual variability in metabolic responses to high P-CO2, perhaps owing to parental effects and time of spawning.

Any CO2-induced reduction in oxygen supply should be apparent as an increase in P-crit. In this study, we assessed the effects of CO2 (46-143 Pa; 455-1410 mu atm) on the metabolic rate and P-crit of two squid species - Dosidicus gigas and Doryteuthis pealeii - through manipulative experiments. We also developed a model, with inputs for hemocyanin pH sensitivity, blood P-CO2 and buffering capacity, that simulates blood oxygen supply under varying seawater CO2 partial pressures. We compare model outputs with measured P-crit in squid. Using blood-O-2 parameters from the literature for model inputs, we estimated that, in the absence of blood acid-base regulation, an increase in seawater P-CO2 to 100 Pa (approximate to 1000 mu atm) would result in a maximum drop in arterial hemocyanin-O-2 saturation by 1.6\% at normoxia and a P-crit increase of approximate to 0.5 kPa. Our live-animal experiments support this supposition, as CO2 had no effect on measured metabolic rate or P-crit in either squid species.",2018,10.1242/jeb.187443,221,19,NA,jeb187443,Acid-base balance; Blood-O-2 binding; Hypercapnia; Cephalopod; Hypoxia tolerance; Dosidicus
article,Juvenile Antarctic rockcod (<i>Trematomus bernacchii</i>) are physiologically robust to CO<sub>2</sub>-acidified seawater,"Davis, Brittany E. and Miller, Nathan A. and Flynn, Erin E. and Todgham, Anne E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"To date, numerous studies have shown negative impacts of CO2-acidified seawater (i.e. ocean acidification, OA) on marine organisms, including calcifying invertebrates and fishes; however, limited research has been conducted on the physiological effects of OA on polar fishes and even less on the impact of OA on early developmental stages of polar fishes. We evaluated aspects of aerobic metabolism and cardiorespiratory physiology of juvenile emerald rockcod, Trematomus bernacchii, an abundant fish in the Ross Sea, Antarctica, to elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide (P-CO2) {[}420 (ambient), 650 (moderate) and 1050 (high) mu atm P-CO2] over a 1 month period. We examined cardiorespiratory physiology, including heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output and ventilation rate, whole organism metabolism via oxygen consumption rate and sub-organismal aerobic capacity by citrate synthase enzyme activity. Juvenile fish showed an increase in ventilation rate under high P-CO2 compared with ambient P-CO2, whereas cardiac performance, oxygen consumption and citrate synthase activity were not significantly affected by elevated P-CO2. Acclimation time had a significant effect on ventilation rate, stroke volume, cardiac output and citrate synthase activity, such that all metrics increased over the 4 week exposure period. These results suggest that juvenile emerald rockcod are robust to near-future increases in OA and may have the capacity to adjust for future increases in P-CO2 by increasing acid-base compensation through increased ventilation.",2016,10.1242/jeb.133173,219,8,1203-1213,NA,Antarctica; Cardiorespiratory physiology; Early life stages; Notothenioid; Ocean acidification

Whilst the ecological effects of these changes are poorly understood, it has been suggested that fish performance including growth will be reduced mainly as a result of limitations in oxygen transport capacity. Contrary to the predictions given by the oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance hypothesis, we show that aerobic scope and cardiac performance of Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) increase following 14-16 weeks exposure to elevated temperatures and even more so in combination with CO2-acidified seawater. However, the increase does not translate into improved growth, demonstrating that oxygen uptake is not the limiting factor for growth performance at high temperatures. Instead, long-term exposure to CO2-acidified seawater reduces growth at temperatures that are frequently encountered by this species in nature, indicating that elevated atmospheric CO2 levels may have serious implications on fish populations in the future.",2014,10.1242/jeb.096743,217,5,711-717,NA,Oxygen consumption rate; Optimal temperature; Climate change; Ocean acidification; Respirometry; Oxygen and capacity limited thermal tolerance; OCLTT; Carbon dioxide

L. and Allen, P. J. and Val, A. L. and Crossley, D. A. and Kohl, Z. F. and Hedrick, M. S. and Damsgaard, C. and Brauner, C. J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Acute (<96 h) exposure to elevated environmental CO2 (hypercarbia) induces a pH disturbance in fishes that is often compensated by concurrent recovery of intracellular and extracellular pH (pH(i) and pH(e), respectively; coupled pH regulation). However, coupled pH regulation may be limited at CO2 partial pressure (P-CO2) tensions far below levels that some fishes naturally encounter. Previously, four hypercarbiatolerant fishes had been shown to completely and rapidly regulate heart, brain, liver and white muscle pH(i) during acute exposure to >4 kPa P-CO2 (preferential pH(i) regulation) before pH(e) compensation was observed. Here, we test the hypothesis that preferential pH(i) regulation is a widespread strategy of acid-base regulation among fish by measuring pH(i) regulation in 10 different fish species that are broadly phylogenetically separated, spanning six orders, eight families and 10 genera. Contrary to previous views, we show that preferential pH(i) regulation is the most common strategy for acid-base regulation within these fishes during exposure to severe acute hypercarbia and that this strategy is associated with increased hypercarbia tolerance. This suggests that preferential pH(i) regulation may confer tolerance to the respiratory acidosis associated with hypercarbia, and we propose that it is an exaptation that facilitated key evolutionary transitions in vertebrate evolution, such as the evolution of air breathing.",2020,10.1242/jeb.208868,223,7,NA,jeb208868,Vertebrates; Hypercarbia; CO2 tolerance; Acid-base regulation; Respiratory acidosis
article,Water pH limits extracellular but not intracellular pH compensation in the CO<sub>2</sub>-tolerant freshwater fish <i>Pangasianodon hypophthalmus </i>,"Sackville, Michael A. and Shartau, Ryan B. and Damsgaard, Christian and Hvas, Malthe and Le My Phuong and Wang, Tobias and Bayley, Mark and Do Thi Thanh Huong and Nguyen Thanh Phuong and Brauner, Colin J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Preferentially regulating intracellular pH (pH(i)) confers exceptional CO2 tolerance on fish, but is often associated with reductions in extracellular pH (pH(e)) compensation. It is unknown whether these reductions are due to intrinsically lower capacities for pH(e) compensation, hypercarbia-induced reductions in water pH or other factors. To test how water pH affects capacities and strategies for pH compensation, we exposed the CO2-tolerant fish Pangasianodon hypophthalmus to 3 kPa P-CO2 for 20 h at an ecologically relevant water pH of 4.5 or 5.8. Brain, heart and liver pH(i) was preferentially regulated in both treatments. However, blood pH(e) compensation was severely reduced at water pH 4.5 but not 5.8. This suggests that low water pH limits acute pH(e) but not pH(i) compensation in fishes preferentially regulating pH(i) Hypercarbia-induced reductions in water pH might therefore underlie the unexplained reductions to pH(e) compensation in fishes preferentially regulating pH(i), and may increase selection for preferential pH(i) regulation.",2018,10.1242/jeb.190413,221,23,NA,jeb190413,Acid-base; Hypercarbia; Pangasius; Bicarbonate
article,Metabolic recovery from drowning by insect pupae,"Woods, H. Arthur and Lane, Steven J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Many terrestrial insects live in environments that flood intermittently, and some life stages may spend days underwater without access to oxygen. We tested the hypothesis that terrestrial insects with underground pupae show respiratory adaptations for surviving anoxia and subsequently reestablishing normal patterns of respiration. Pupae of Manduca sexta were experimentally immersed in water for between 0 and 13 days. All pupae survived up to 5 days of immersion regardless of whether the water was aerated or anoxic. By contrast, fifth-instar larvae survived a maximum of 4 h of immersion. There were no effects of immersion during the pupal period on adult size and morphology. After immersion, pupae initially emitted large pulses of CO2. After a subsequent trough in CO2 emission, spiracular activity resumed and average levels of CO2 emission were then elevated for approximately 1 day in the group immersed for 1 day and for at least 2 days in the 3- and 5-day immersion treatments. Although patterns of CO2 emission were diverse, most pupae went through a period during which they emitted CO2 in a cyclic pattern with periods of 0.78-2.2 min. These high-frequency cycles are not predicted by the recent models of Forster and Hetz (2010) and Grieshaber and Terblanche (2015), and we suggest several potential ways to reconcile the models with our observations. During immersion, pupae accumulated lactate, which then declined to low levels over 12-48 h. Pupae in the 3- and 5-day immersion groups still had elevated rates of CO2 emission after 48 h, suggesting that they continued to spend energy on reestablishing homeostasis even after lactate had returned to low levels. Despite their status as terrestrial insects, pupae of M. sexta can withstand long periods of immersion and anoxia and can reestablish homeostasis subsequently.",2016,10.1242/jeb.144105,219,19,3126-3136,NA,Immersion; Anoxia; Reperfusion; Oxygen; Lactate; Carbon dioxide; Cyclic ventilation; Discontinuous gas cycles; Spiracle
