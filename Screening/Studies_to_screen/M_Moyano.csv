article,Does control of insensible evaporative water loss by two species of mesic parrot have a thermoregulatory role?,"Cooper, Christine Elizabeth and Withers, Philip Carew and Kortner, Gerhard and Geiser, Fritz",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Insensible evaporative water loss (EWL) at or below thermoneutrality is generally assumed to be a passive physical process. However, some arid zone mammals and a single arid zone bird can control their insensible water loss, so we tested the hypothesis that the same is the case for two parrot species from a mesic habitat. We investigated red-rumped parrots (Psephotus haematonotus) and eastern rosellas (Platycercus eximius), measuring their EWL, and other physiological variables, at a range of relative humidities at ambient temperatures of 20 and 30 degrees C (below and at thermoneutrality). We found that, despite a decrease in EWL with increasing relative humidity, rates of EWL were not fully accounted for by the water vapour deficit between the animal and its environment, indicating that the insensible EWL of both parrots was controlled. It is unlikely that this deviation from physical expectations was regulation with a primary role for water conservation because our mesic-habitat parrots had equivalent regulatory ability as the arid habitat budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus). This, together with our observations of body temperature and metabolic rate, instead support the hypothesis that acute physiological control of insensible water loss serves a thermoregulatory purpose for endotherms. Modification of both cutaneous and respiratory avenues of evaporation may be involved, possibly via modification of expired air temperature and humidity, and surface resistance.",2020,10.1242/jeb.229930,223,19,NA,jeb229930,Body temperature; Evaporative water loss; Humidity; Metabolic rate; Physiological control; Respirometry; Thermoregulation; Water balance; Water vapour pressure
article,Tilapia (<i>Oreochromis mossambicus</i>) brain cells respond to hyperosmotic challenge by inducing <i>myo</i>-inositol biosynthesis,"Gardell, Alison M. and Yang, Jun and Sacchi, Romina and Fangue, Nann A. and Hammock, Bruce D. and Kueltz, Dietmar",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"This study aimed to determine the regulation of the de novo myo-inositol biosynthetic (MIB) pathway in Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) brain following acute (25 ppt) and chronic (30, 60 and 90 ppt) salinity acclimations. The MIB pathway plays an important role in accumulating the compatible osmolyte, myo-inositol, in cells in response to hyperosmotic challenge and consists of two enzymes, myo-inositol phosphate synthase and inositol monophosphatase. In tilapia brain, MIB enzyme transcriptional regulation was found to robustly increase in a time (acute acclimation) or dose (chronic acclimation) dependent manner. Blood plasma osmolality and Na+ and Cl- concentrations were also measured and significantly increased in response to both acute and chronic salinity challenges. Interestingly, highly significant positive correlations were found between MIB enzyme mRNA and blood plasma osmolality in both acute and chronic salinity acclimations. Additionally, a mass spectrometry assay was established and used to quantify total myo-inositol concentration in tilapia brain, which closely mirrored the hyperosmotic MIB pathway induction. Thus, myo-inositol is a major compatible osmolyte that is accumulated in brain cells when exposed to acute and chronic hyperosmotic challenge. These data show that the MIB pathway is highly induced in response to environmental salinity challenge in tilapia brain and that this induction is likely prompted by increases in blood plasma osmolality. Because the MIB pathway uses glucose-6-phosphate as a substrate and large amounts of myo-inositol are being synthesized, our data also illustrate that the MIB pathway likely contributes to the high energetic demand posed by salinity challenge.",2013,10.1242/jeb.088906,216,24,4615-4625,NA,osmoregulation; compatible osmolyte; myo-inositol; brain; tilapia
article,Vasotocin and isotocin regulate aquaporin 1 function in the sea bream,"Martos-Sitcha, Juan Antonio and Campinho, Marco Antonio and Miguel Mancera, Juan and Martinez-Rodriguez, Gonzalo and Fuentes, Juan",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Aquaporins (AQPs) are specific transmembrane water channels with an important function in water homeostasis. In terrestrial vertebrates, AQP2 function is regulated by vasopressin (AVP) to accomplish key functions in osmoregulation. The endocrine control of aquaporin function in teleosts remains little studied. Therefore, in this study we investigated the regulatory role of vasotocin (AVTR) and isotocin (ITR) receptors in Aqp1 paralog gene function in the teleost gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata). The complete coding regions of Aqp1a, Aqp1b, AVTR V1a2-type, AVTR V2-type and ITR from sea bream were isolated. A Xenopus oocyte-swelling assay was used to functionally characterize AQP1 function and regulation by AVT and IT through their cognate receptors. Microinjection of oocytes with Aqp1b mRNA revealed regulation of water transport via PKA (IBMX+forskolin sensitive), whereas Aqp1a mRNA injection had the same effect via PKC signaling (PDBU sensitive). In the absence of expressed receptors, AVT and IT (10(-8) mol l(-1)) were unable to modify AQP1 function. AVT regulated AQP1a and AQP1b function only when the AVTR V2-type was co-expressed. IT regulated AQP1a function, but not AQP1b, only when ITR was present. Considering that Aqp1a and Aqp1b gene expression in the sea bream intestine is highly salinity dependent in vivo, our results in ovo demonstrate a regulatory role for AVT and IT in AQP1 function in the sea bream in the processing of intestinal fluid to achieve osmoregulation.",2015,10.1242/jeb.114546,218,5,684-693,NA,Aquaporin; Water regulation; Isotocin receptor; Vasotocin receptor; Osmoregulation
article,"Plasticity, repeatability and phenotypic correlations of aerobic metabolic traits in a small estuarine fish","Reemeyer, Jessica E. and Rees, Bernard B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Standard metabolic rate (SMR), maximum metabolic rate (MMR), absolute aerobic scope (AAS) and critical oxygen tension (P-crit) were determined for the Gulf killifish, Fundulus grandis, an ecologically dominant estuarine fish, acclimated to lowered salinity, elevated temperature and lowered oxygen concentration. Acclimation to low salinity resulted in a small, but significant, elevation of P-crit (suggesting lower tolerance of hypoxia); acclimation to elevated temperature increased SMR, MMR, MS and P-crit; acclimation to low oxygen led to a small increase in SMR, but substantial decreases in MMR, AAS and P-crit. Variation in these metabolic traits among individuals was consistent and repeatable when measured during multiple control exposures over 7 months. Trait repeatability was unaffected by acclimation condition, suggesting that repeatability of these traits is not context dependent. There were significant phenotypic correlations between specific metabolic traits: SMR was positively correlated with MMR and P-crit; MMR was positively correlated with MS; and MS was negatively correlated with P-crit. In general, within-individual variation contributed more than among-individual variation to these phenotypic correlations. The effects of acclimation on these traits demonstrate that aerobic metabolism is plastic and influenced by the conditions experienced by these fish in the dynamic habitats in which they occur; however, the repeatability of these traits and the correlations among them suggest that these traits change in ways that maintain the rank order of performance among individuals across a range of environmental variation.",2020,10.1242/jeb.228098,223,14,NA,jeb228098,Acclimation; Aerobic metabolism; Aerobic scope; Fundulus; Hypoxia; Individual variation
article,Characterizing the metabolic capacity of the anoxic hagfish heart,"Gillis, Todd E. and Regan, Matthew D. and Cox, Georgina K. and Harter, Till S. and Brauner, Colin J. and Richards, Jeff G. and Farrell, Anthony P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii, can recover from 36 h of anoxia at 10 degrees C. Such anoxia tolerance demands the mobilization of anaerobic fuels and the removal of metabolic wastes -processes that require a functional heart. The purpose of this study was to measure the metabolic response of the excised, cannulated hagfish heart to anoxia using direct calorimetry. These experiments were coupled with measurements of cardiac pH and metabolite concentrations, at multiple time points, to monitor acid-base balance and anaerobic ATP production. We also exposed hagfish to anoxia to compare the in vitro responses of the excised hearts with the in vivo responses. The calorimetry results revealed a significant reduction in the rate of metabolic heat production over the first hour of anoxia exposure, and a recovery over the subsequent 6 h. This response is likely attributable to a rapid anoxia-induced depression of aerobic ATP-production pathways followed by an upregulation of anaerobic ATP-production pathways such that the ATP production rate was restored to that measured in normoxia. Glycogen-depletion measurements suggest that metabolic processes were initially supported by glycolysis but that an alternative fuel source was used to support the sustained rates of ATP production. The maintenance of intracellular pH during anoxia indicates a remarkable ability of the myocytes to buffer/regulate protons and thus protect cardiac function. Altogether, these results illustrate that the low metabolic demand of the hagfish heart allows for near-routine levels of cardiac metabolism to be supported anaerobically. This is probably a significant contributor to the hagfish's exceptional anoxia tolerance.",2015,10.1242/jeb.125070,218,23,3754-3761,NA,Anaerobic metabolism; Anoxia; Direct calorimetry; Glycogen; Eptatretus stoutii; Heart
article,Thermal analysis of ice and glass transitions in insects that do and do not survive freezing,"Rozsypal, Jan and Moos, Martin and Simek, Petrs and Kostal, Vladimir",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Some insects rely on the strategy of freeze tolerance for winter survival. During freezing, extracellular body water transitions from the liquid to the solid phase and cells undergo freeze-induced dehydration. Here, we present results of a thermal analysis (from differential scanning calorimetry) of ice fraction dynamics during gradual cooling after inoculative freezing in variously acclimated larvae of two drosophilid flies, Drosophila melanogaster and Chymomyza costata. Although the species and variants ranged broadly between 0 and close to 100\% survival of freezing, there were relatively small differences in ice fraction dynamics. For instance, the maximum ice fraction (IFmax) ranged between 67.9\% and 77.7\% total body water (TBW). Chymomyza costata larvae showed statistically significant phenotypic shifts in parameters of ice fraction dynamics (melting point and IFmax) upon entry into diapause, cold acclimation and feeding on a proline augmented diet. These differences were mostly driven by colligative effects of accumulated proline (ranging between 6 and 487 mmol kg(-1) TBW) and other metabolites. Our data suggest that these colligative effects per se do not represent a sufficient mechanistic explanation for high freeze tolerance observed in diapausing, cold-acclimated C. costata larvae. Instead, we hypothesize that accumulated proline exerts its protective role via a combination of mechanisms. Specifically, we found a tight association between proline-induced stimulation of glass transition in partially frozen body liquids (vitrification) and survival of cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen.",2018,10.1242/jeb.170464,221,7,NA,jeb170464,Freeze tolerance; Ice fraction; Osmotically inactive water; Proline; Vitrification
article,"Developmental carryover effects of ocean warming and acidification in corals from a potential climate refugium, the Gulf of Aqaba","Bellworthy, Jessica and Menoud, Malika and Krueger, Thomas and Meibom, Anders and Fine, Maoz",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Coral reefs are degrading from the effects of anthropogenic activities, including climate change. Under these stressors, their ability to survive depends upon existing phenotypic plasticity, but also transgenerational adaptation. Parental effects are ubiquitous in nature, yet empirical studies of these effects in corals are scarce, particularly in the context of climate change. This study exposed mature colonies of the common reef-building coral Stylophora pistillata from the Gulf of Aqaba to seawater conditions likely to occur just beyond the end of this century during the peak planulae brooding season (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5: pH -0.4 and +5 degrees C beyond present day). Parent and planulae physiology were assessed at multiple time points during the experimental incubation. After 5 weeks of incubation, the physiology of the parent colonies exhibited limited treatment-induced changes. All significant time-dependent changes in physiology occurred in both ambient and treatment conditions. Planulae were also resistant to future ocean conditions, with protein content, symbiont density, photochemistry, survival and settlement success not significantly different compared with under ambient conditions. High variability in offspring physiology was independent of parental or offspring treatments and indicate the use of a bet-hedging strategy in this population. This study thus demonstrates weak climate-change-associated carryover effects. Furthermore, planulae display temperature and pH resistance similar to those of adult colonies and therefore do not represent a larger future population size bottleneck. The findings add support to the emerging hypothesis that the Gulf of Aqaba may serve as a coral climate change refugium aided by these corals' inherent broad physiological resistance.",2019,10.1242/jeb.186940,222,1,NA,jeb186940,Phenotypic plasticity; Early life history; Ocean acidification; Trans-generational; Parental effects; Planulae
article,Size-dependent physiological responses of the branching coral <i>Pocillopora verrucosa</i> to elevated temperature and <i>P</i><sub>CO2</sub>,"Edmunds, Peter J. and Burgess, Scott C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Body size has large effects on organism physiology, but these effects remain poorly understood in modular animals with complex morphologies. Using two trials of a similar to 24 day experiment conducted in 2014 and 2015, we tested the hypothesis that colony size of the coral Pocillopora verrucosa affects the response of calcification, aerobic respiration and gross photosynthesis to temperature (similar to 26.5 and similar to 29.7 degrees C) and PCO2 (similar to 40 and similar to 1000 atm). Large corals calcified more than small corals, but at a slower size-specific rate; areanormalized calcification declined with size. Whole-colony and areanormalized calcification were unaffected by temperature, P-CO2, or the interaction between the two. Whole-colony respiration increased with colony size, but the slopes of these relationships differed between treatments. Area-normalized gross photosynthesis declined with colony size, but whole-colony photosynthesis was unaffected by P-CO2, and showed a weak response to temperature. When scaled up to predict the response of large corals, area-normalized metrics of physiological performance measured using small corals provide inaccurate estimates of the physiological performance of large colonies. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of colony size in modulating the response of branching corals to elevated temperature and high P-CO2",2016,10.1242/jeb.146381,219,24,3896-3906,NA,Scleractinia; Climate change; Ocean acidification; Temperature
article,"Physiological and molecular responses of the goldfish (<i>Carassius auratus</i>) kidney to metabolic acidosis, and potential mechanisms of renal ammonia transport","Lawrence, Michael J. and Wright, Patricia A. and Wood, Chris M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Relative to the gills, the mechanisms by which the kidney contributes to ammonia and acid-base homeostasis in fish are poorly understood. Goldfish were exposed to a low pH environment (pH 4.0, 48 h), which induced a characteristic metabolic acidosis and an increase in total plasma {[}ammonia] but reduced plasma ammonia partial pressure (P-NH3). In the kidney tissue, total ammonia, lactate and intracellular pH remained unchanged. The urinary excretion rate of net base under control conditions changed to net acid excretion under low pH, with contributions from both the NH4+ (similar to 30\%) and titratable acidity minus bicarbonate (similar to 70\%; TA-HCO3-) components. Inorganic phosphate (P-i), urea and Na+ excretion rates were also elevated while Cl- excretion rates were unchanged. Renal alanine aminotransferase activity increased under acidosis. The increase in renal ammonia excretion was due to significant increases in both the glomerular filtration and the tubular secretion rates of ammonia, with the latter accounting for similar to 75\% of the increase. There was also a 3.5-fold increase in the mRNA expression of renal Rhcg-b (Rhcg1) mRNA. There was no relationship between ammonia secretion and Na+ reabsorption. These data indicate that increased renal ammonia secretion during acidosis is probably mediated through Rhesus (Rh) glycoproteins and occurs independently of Na+ transport, in contrast to branchial and epidermal models of Na+-dependent ammonia transport in freshwater fish. Rather, we propose a model of parallel H+/NH3 transport as the primary mechanism of renal tubular ammonia secretion that is dependent on renal amino acid catabolism.",2015,10.1242/jeb.117689,218,13,2124-2135,NA,Renal excretion; Renal tubule; Urine pH; Urine flow rate; Glomerular filtration rate; Amino acid catabolism; Rhesus glycoproteins; Na+ transport; Acid-base regulation
article,Hemoglobin function and allosteric regulation in semi-fossorial rodents (family Sciuridae) with different altitudinal ranges,"Revsbech, Inge G. and Tufts, Danielle M. and Projecto-Garcia, Joana and Moriyama, Hideaki and Weber, Roy E. and Storz, Jay F. and Fago, Angela",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Semi-fossorial ground squirrels face challenges to respiratory gas transport associated with the chronic hypoxia and hypercapnia of underground burrows, and such challenges are compounded in species that are native to high altitude. During hibernation, such species must also contend with vicissitudes of blood gas concentrations and plasma pH caused by episodic breathing. Here, we report an analysis of hemoglobin (Hb) function in six species of marmotine ground squirrels with different altitudinal distributions. Regardless of their native altitude, all species have high Hb-O-2 affinities, mainly due to suppressed sensitivities to allosteric effectors [}2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) and chloride ions]. This suppressed anion sensitivity is surprising given that all canonical anion-binding sites are conserved. Two sciurid species, the golden-mantled and thirteen-lined ground squirrel, have Hb-O-2 affinities that are characterized by high pH sensitivity and low thermal sensitivity relative to the Hbs of humans and other mammals. The pronounced Bohr effect is surprising in light of highly unusual amino acid substitutions at the C-termini that are known to abolish the Bohr effect in human HbA. Taken together, the high O-2 affinity of sciurid Hbs suggests an enhanced capacity for pulmonary O-2 loading under hypoxic and hypercapnic conditions, while the large Bohr effect should help to ensure efficient O-2 unloading in tissue capillaries. In spite of the relatively low thermal sensitivities of the sciurid Hbs, our results indicate that the effect of hypothermia on Hb oxygenation is the main factor contributing to the increased blood-O-2 affinity in hibernating ground squirrels.",2013,10.1242/jeb.091397,216,22,4264-4271,NA,adaptation; allostery; globin; hibernation; hypoxia
article,Oxygen dependence of upper thermal limits in fishes,"Ern, Rasmus and Norin, Tommy and Gamperl, A. Kurt and Esbaugh, Andrew J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature-induced limitations on the capacity of the cardiorespiratory system to transport oxygen from the environment to the tissues, manifested as a reduced aerobic scope (maximum minus standard metabolic rate), have been proposed as the principal determinant of the upper thermal limits of fishes and other water-breathing ectotherms. Consequently, the upper thermal niche boundaries of these animals are expected to be highly sensitive to aquatic hypoxia and other environmental stressors that constrain their cardiorespiratory performance. However, the generality of this dogma has recently been questioned, as some species have been shown to maintain aerobic scope at thermal extremes. Here, we experimentally tested whether reduced oxygen availability due to aquatic hypoxia would decrease the upper thermal limits (i.e. the critical thermal maximum, CTmax) of the estuarine red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) and the marine lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus). In both species, CTmax was independent of oxygen availability over a wide range of oxygen levels despite substantial (>72\%) reductions in aerobic scope. These data show that the upper thermal limits of water-breathing ectotherms are not always linked to the capacity for oxygen transport. Consequently, we propose a novel metric for classifying the oxygen dependence of thermal tolerance; the oxygen limit for thermal tolerance (P-CTmax), which is the water oxygen tension (Pw(O2)) where an organism's CTmax starts to decline. We suggest that this metric can be used for assessing the oxygen sensitivity of upper thermal limits in water-breathing ectotherms, and the susceptibility of their upper thermal niche boundaries to environmental hypoxia.",2016,10.1242/jeb.143495,219,21,3376-3383,NA,Aerobic scope; Critical oxygen tension; P-crit; Critical thermal maximum; CTmax; Hypoxia; Oxygen limit for thermal tolerance; P-CTmax; Temperature
article,Temperature mediates the effect of humidity on the viscoelasticity of glycoprotein glue within the droplets of an orb-weaving spider's prey capture threads,"Stellwagen, Sarah D. and Opell, Brent D. and Short, Kelly G.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Sticky viscous prey capture threads retain insects that strike araneoid orb-webs. The threads' two axial fibers support a series of glue droplets, each featuring a core of adhesive viscoelastic glycoprotein covered by an aqueous solution. After sticking, the glue extends, summing the adhesion of multiple droplets, and dissipates some of the energy of a struggling prey. As a day progresses, threads experience a drop in humidity and an increase in temperature, environmental variables that have the potential to alter thread and web function. We hypothesize that thread droplets respond to these opposing environmental changes in a manner that stabilizes their performance, and test this by examining threads spun by Argiope aurantia, a species that occupies exposed, weedy habitats. We confirmed that decreased humidity increases glycoprotein viscosity and found that increased temperature had the opposite effect. To evaluate the combined effect of temperature and humidity on a droplet's ability to transfer adhesive force and dissipate energy, we extended a droplet and measured both the deflection of the axial line supporting the droplet and the duration of its tensive load. The cumulative product of these two indices, which reflects the energy required to extend a droplet, was greatest under afternoon (hot and dry) conditions, less under morning (cool and humid) conditions, and least under hot and humid afternoon conditions. Although the opposing effects of temperature and humidity tend to stabilize glycoprotein performance, A. aurantia thread droplets appear to function optimally during the afternoon, equipping this species to capture large orthopterans, which are most active at this time.",2014,10.1242/jeb.097816,217,9,1563-1569,NA,Argiope aurantia; Biomaterial; Glycoprotein; Hygroscopic; Viscoelastic
article,Early developmental stages of native populations of <i>Ciona intestinalis</i> under increased temperature are affected by local habitat history,"Clutton, Elizabeth A. and Alurralde, Gaston and Repolho, Tiago",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature modulates marine ectotherm physiology, influencing survival, abundance and species distribution. While native species could be susceptible to ocean warming, thermal tolerance might favour the spread of non-native species. Determining the success of invasive species in response to climate change is confounded by the cumulative, synergistic or antagonistic effects of environmental drivers, which vary at a geographical and temporal scale. Thus, an organism's acclimation or adaptive potential could play an important evolutionary role by enabling or conditioning species tolerance to stressful environmental conditions. We investigated developmental performance of early life stages of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis (derived from populations of anthropogenically impacted and control sites) to an extreme weather event (i.e. marine heatwave). Fertilization rate, embryo and larval development, settlement, metamorphosis success and juvenile heart rate were assessed as experimental endpoints. With the exception of fertilization and heart rates, temperature influenced all analysed endpoints. C. intestinalis derived from control sites were the most negatively affected by increased temperature conditions. By contrast, C. intestinalis from anthropogenically impacted sites showed a positive response to thermal stress, with a higher proportion of larvae development, settlement and metamorphosis success being observed under increased temperature conditions. No differences were observed for heart rates between sampled populations and experimental temperature conditions. Moreover, interaction between temperature and populations was statistically significant for embryo and larvae development, and metamorphosis. We hypothesize that selection resulting from anthropogenic forcing could shape stress resilience of species in their native range and subsequently confer advantageous traits underlying their invasive potential.",2021,10.1242/jeb.233403,224,5,NA,jeb233403,Ascidians; Biological invasion; Ciona intestinalis; Early life stages; Marine heatwave; Ocean warming

F. N. and Cunningham, Susan J. and McKechnie, Andrew E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"At a global scale, thermal physiology is correlated with climatic variables such as temperature and aridity. There is also evidence that thermoregulatory traits vary with fine-scale microclimate, but this has received less attention in endotherms. Here, we test the hypothesis that avian thermoregulation varies with microclimate and behavioural constraints in a non-passerine bird. Male and female southern yellow-billed hombills (Tockus leucomelas) experience markedly different microclimates while breeding, with the female sealing herself into a tree cavity and moulting all her flight feathers during the breeding attempt, becoming entirely reliant on the male for provisioning. We examined interactions between resting metabolic rate (RMR), evaporative water loss (EWL) and core body temperature (T-b) at air temperatures (T-a) between 30 degrees C and 52 degrees C in male and female hornbills, and quantified evaporative cooling efficiencies and heat tolerance limits. At thermoneutral T-a, neither RMR, EWL nor T-b differed between sexes. At T-a >40 degrees C, however, RMR and EWL of females were significantly lower than those of males, by similar to 13\% and similar to 17\%, respectively, despite similar relationships between T-b and T-a, maximum ratio of evaporative heat loss to metabolic heat production and heat tolerance limits (similar to 50 degrees C). These sex-specific differences in hornbill thermoregulation support the hypothesis that avian thermal physiology can vary within species in response to fine-scale microclimatic factors. In addition, Q(10) for RMR varied substantially, with Q(10) <= 2 in some individuals, supporting recent arguments that active metabolic suppression may be an underappreciated aspect of endotherm thermoregulation in the heat.",2021,10.1242/jeb.232777,224,4,NA,jeb232777,Thermoregulation; Microclimate; Sex-specific; Avian; Heat
article,Phenotypic flexibility of metabolic rate and evaporative water loss does not vary across a climatic gradient in an Afrotropical passerine bird,"Noakes, Matthew J. and McKechnie, Andrew E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Small birds inhabiting northern temperate and boreal latitudes typically increase metabolic rates during cold winters or acclimation to low air temperatures (T-accl). Recent studies suggest considerable variation in patterns of seasonal metabolic acclimatization in birds from subtropical and tropical regions with milder winters, but there remains a dearth of acclimation studies investigating metabolic flexibility among lower-latitude birds. We used short-term thermal acclimation experiments to investigate phenotypic flexibility in basal metabolic rate (BMR), thermoneutral evaporative water loss (EWL) and summit metabolism (M-sum) in three populations of white-browed sparrow-weavers (Plocepasser mahali) along a climatic and aridity gradient. We allocated individuals to one of three Taccl treatments (5, 20 and 35 degrees C; n=11 per population per T-accl) for 28 days, and measured post-acclimation BMR, EWL and Msum using flow-through respirometry. Our data reveal the expected pattern of lower BMR and EWL (similar to 12\% and 25\% lower, respectively) in birds at T-accl=35 degrees C compared with cooler T-accl treatments, as observed in previous acclimation studies on subtropical birds. We found no variation in the reaction norms of BMR and EWL among populations in response to acclimation, suggesting previously documented differences in seasonal BMR acclimatization are the result of phenotypic flexibility. In contrast to higher-latitude species, M-sum did not significantly vary in response to thermal acclimation. These findings support the idea that factors other than enhancing cold tolerance may be driving patterns of metabolic variation in subtropical birds.",2020,10.1242/jeb.220137,223,7,NA,jeb220137,Adaptive plasticity; Reaction norm; Acclimation; Summit metabolism; Basal metabolic rate; Subtropical
article,"The behavioral regulation of thirst, water collection and water storage in honey bee colonies","Ostwald, Madeleine M. and Smith, Michael L. and Seeley, Thomas D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"This study investigated how a honey bee colony develops and quenches its collective thirst when it experiences hyperthermia of its broodnest. We found that a colony must strongly boost its water intake because evaporative cooling is critical to relieving broodnest hyperthermia, and that it must rapidly boost its water intake because a colony maintains only a small water reserve. We also clarified how a colony's water collectors know when to spring into action - by sensing either more frequent requests for fluid or greater personal thirst, or both. Finally, we found that the behavioral flexibility of a colony's water collectors enables them not only to satisfy their colony's current water needs but also to buffer their colony against future extreme water stresses by storing water in their crops and in their combs.",2016,10.1242/jeb.139824,219,14,2156-2165,NA,Apis mellifera; Social physiology; Social thirst; Nest thermoregulation; Water homeostasis; Water collectors
article,Emersion behaviour underlies variation in gill morphology and aquatic respiratory function in the amphibious fish <i>Kryptolebias marmoratus</i>,"Turko, A. J. and Tatarenkov, A. and Currie, S. and Earley, R. L. and Platek, A. and Taylor, D. S. and Wright, P. A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Fishes acclimated to hypoxic environments often increase gill surface area to improve O-2 uptake. In some species, surface area is increased via reduction of an interlamellar cell mass (ILCM) that fills water channels between gill lamellae. Amphibious fishes, however, may not increase gill surface area in hypoxic water because these species can, instead, leave water and breathe air. To differentiate between these possibilities, we compared wild amphibious mangrove rivulus Kryptolebias marmoratus from two habitats that varied in O-2 availability - a hypoxic freshwater pool versus nearly anoxic crab burrows. Fish captured from crab burrows had less gill surface area (as ILCMs were enlarged by similar to 32\%), increased rates of normoxic O-2 consumption and increased critical O-2 tension compared with fish from the freshwater pool. Thus, wild mangrove rivulus do not respond to near-anoxic water by decreasing metabolism or increasing O-2 extraction. Instead, fish from the crab burrow habitat spent three times longer out of water, which probably caused the observed changes in gill morphology and respiratory phenotype. We also tested whether critical O-2 tension is influenced by genetic heterozygosity, as K. marmoratus is one of only two hermaphroditic vertebrate species that can produce both self-fertilized (inbred) or out-crossed (more heterozygous) offspring. We found no evidence for inbreeding depression, suggesting that self-fertilization does not impair respiratory function. Overall, our results demonstrate that amphibious fishes that inhabit hypoxic aquatic habitats can use a fundamentally different strategy from that used by fully aquatic water-breathing fishes, relying on escape behaviour rather than metabolic depression or increased O-2 extraction ability.",2018,10.1242/jeb.168039,221,8,NA,jeb168039,Interlamellar cell mass; Metabolic rate; Critical oxygen tension; Trade-offs; Inbreeding depression

P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Being composed of small cells may carry energetic costs related to maintaining ionic gradients across cell membranes as well as benefits related to diffusive oxygen uptake. Here, we test the hypothesis that these costs and benefits of cell size in ectotherms are temperature dependent. To study the consequences of cell size for whole-organism metabolic rate, we compared diploid and triploid zebrafish larvae differing in cell size. A fully factorial design was applied combining three different rearing and test temperatures that allowed us to distinguish acute from acclimated thermal effects. Individual oxygen consumption rates of diploid and triploid larvae across declining levels of oxygen availability were measured. We found that both acute and acclimated thermal effects affected the metabolic response. In comparison with triploids, diploids responded more strongly to acute temperatures, especially when reared at the highest temperature. These observations support the hypothesis that animals composed of smaller cells (i.e. diploids) are less vulnerable to oxygen limitation in warm aquatic habitats. Furthermore, we found slightly improved hypoxia tolerance in diploids. By contrast, warm-reared triploids had higher metabolic rates when they were tested at acute cold temperature, suggesting that being composed of larger cells may provide metabolic advantages in the cold. We offer two mechanisms as a potential explanation of this result, related to homeoviscous adaptation of membrane function and the mitigation of developmental noise. Our results suggest that being composed of larger cells provides metabolic advantages in cold water, while being composed of smaller cells provides metabolic advantages in warm water.",2021,10.1242/jeb.227124,224,1,NA,jeb227124,Cell size; Metabolic rates; Oxygen limitation; Polyploidy; Temperature

Justin and Chung, Wen-sung and Osorio, Daniel C. and Cheney, Karen L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In many animals, ultraviolet (UV) vision guides navigation, foraging, and communication, but few studies have addressed the contribution of UV signals to colour vision, or measured UV discrimination thresholds using behavioural experiments. Here, we tested UV colour vision in an anemonefish (Amphiprion ocellaris) using a five -channel (RGB-V-UV) LED display. We first determined that the maximal sensitivity of the A. ocellaris UV cone was -386 nm using microspectrophotometry. Three additional cone spectral sensitivities had maxima at -497, 515 and -535 nm. We then behaviourally measured colour discrimination thresholds by training anemonefish to distinguish a coloured target pixel from grey distractor pixels of varying intensity. Thresholds were calculated for nine sets of colours with and without UV signals. Using a tetrachromatic vision model, we found that anemonefish were better (i.e. discrimination thresholds were lower) at discriminating colours when target pixels had higher UV chromatic contrast. These colours caused a greater stimulation of the UV cone relative to other cone types. These findings imply that a UV component of colour signals and cues improves their detectability, which likely increases the prominence of anemonefish body patterns for communication and the silhouette of zooplankton prey.",2024,10.1242/jeb.247425,227,7,NA,jeb247425,Colour vision; Psychophysics; Reef fish; Ultraviolet vision
article,A solution to Nature's haemoglobin knockout: a plasma-accessible carbonic anhydrase catalyses CO<sub>2</sub> excretion in Antarctic icefish gills,"Harter, Till S. and Sackville, Michael A. and Wilson, Jonathan M. and Metzger, David C. H. and Egginton, Stuart and Esbaugh, Andrew J. and Farrell, Anthony P. and Brauner, Colin J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In all vertebrates studied to date, CO2 excretion depends on the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA) that catalyses the rapid conversion of HCO3 - to CO2 at the gas-exchange organs. The largest pool of CA is present within red blood cells (RBCs) and, in some vertebrates, plasma-accessible CA (paCA) isoforms participate in CO2 excretion. However, teleost fishes typically do not have paCA at the gills and CO2 excretion is reliant entirely on RBC CA - a strategy that is not possible in icefishes. As the result of a natural knockout, Antarctic icefishes (Channichthyidae) are the only known vertebrates that do not express haemoglobin (Hb) as adults, and largely lack RBCs in the circulation (haematocrit <1\%). Previous work has indicated the presence of high levels of membrane-bound CA activity in the gills of icefishes, but without determining its cellular orientation. Thus, we hypothesised that icefishes express a membrane-bound CA isoform at the gill that is accessible to the blood plasma. The CA distribution was compared in the gills of two closely related notothenioid species, one with Hb and RBCs (Notothenia rossit) and one without (Champsocephalus gunnan). Molecular, biochemical and immunohistochemical markers indicate high levels of a Ca4 isoform in the gills of the icefish (but not the red-blooded N. rossit), in a plasma-accessible location that is consistent with a role in CO2 excretion. Thus, in the absence of RBC CA, the icefish gill could exclusively provide the catalytic activity necessary for CO2 excretion - a pathway that is unlike that of any other vertebrate.",2018,10.1242/jeb.190918,221,22,NA,jeb190918,Notothenioid; Teleost; Adaptive radiation; PI-PLC; Plasma CA inhibitor; Ca4
article,"Ultraviolet vision in lacertid lizards: evidence from retinal structure, eye transmittance, SWS1 visual pigment genes and behaviour","Perez i de Lanuza, Guillem and Font, Enrique",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Ultraviolet (UV) vision and UV colour patches have been reported in a wide range of taxa and are increasingly appreciated as an integral part of vertebrate visual perception and communication systems. Previous studies with Lacertidae, a lizard family with diverse and complex coloration, have revealed the existence of UV-reflecting patches that may function as social signals. However, confirmation of the signalling role of UV coloration requires demonstrating that the lizards are capable of vision in the UV waveband. Here we use a multidisciplinary approach to characterize the visual sensitivity of a diverse sample of lacertid species. Spectral transmission measurements of the ocular media show that wavelengths down to 300 nm are transmitted in all the species sampled. Four retinal oil droplet types can be identified in the lacertid retina. Two types are pigmented and two are colourless. Fluorescence microscopy reveals that a type of colourless droplet is UV-transmitting and may thus be associated with UV-sensitive cones. DNA sequencing shows that lacertids have a functional SWS1 opsin, very similar at 13 critical sites to that in the presumed ancestral vertebrate (which was UV sensitive) and other UV-sensitive lizards. Finally, males of Podarcis muralis are capable of discriminating between two views of the same stimulus that differ only in the presence/absence of UV radiance. Taken together, these results provide convergent evidence of UV vision in lacertids, very likely by means of an independent photopigment. Moreover, the presence of four oil droplet types suggests that lacertids have a four-cone colour vision system.",2014,10.1242/jeb.104281,217,16,2899-2909,NA,Behaviour; Colour vision; Ocular transmittance; Oil droplet; SWS1 opsin; UV
article,Decapod egg membranes: powerful barriers or regulatory structures?,"Bas, Claudia C. and Ituarte, Romina B. and Kittlein, Marcelo J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Osmoregulatory abilities and mechanisms of adults and larvae of decapod crustaceans have been extensively investigated. However, how embryos carried by their mothers can deal with changing or extreme salinities is less understood. The egg membranes are believed to isolate embryos from a challenging environment, although osmoregulatory ability has been demonstrated in early developing embryos (naupliar stage) of two crabs. To establish whether embryos are isolated by their membranes and/or are able to osmoregulate, we measured the survival and volume change over 48 h of oocytes and embryos in different stages of three carideans (Betaeus iiiianae, Palaemon macrodactylus and P. argentinus) and the brachyuran Neohelice granulata, subjected to different salinities. In addition, we recorded osmolality changes in homogenates of the same stages in P. argentinus and N. granulata after 2 h of exposure and mapped the presence of putative sites of ions exchange in the membrane of all species. High mortality, when it occurred, was associated with low salinity and mortality variation with the stage of development depended on the species. All species precipitated silver salts in or under the egg envelope, with a different pattern between carideans and the brachyuran. Changes in osmolality and egg volume after hypo- or hyper-osmotic salinity challenges indicate that eggs are not fully isolated by their membranes, and that some osmoregulatory mechanisms are in play to maintain developmental homeostasis. We suggest that egg membranes can participate in osmoregulation by selectively transporting ions to an intramembrane space, with differences between carideans and brachyurans.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244165,225,14,NA,NA,Embryo osmoregulation; Caridean; Selective membranes

Arthur",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Like all taxa, populations of aquatic insects may respond to climate change by evolving new physiologies or behaviors, shifting their range, exhibiting physiological and behavioral plasticity, or going extinct. We evaluated the importance of plasticity by measuring changes in growth, survival and respiratory phenotypes of salmonfly nymphs (the stonefly Pteronarcys californica) in response to experimental combinations of dissolved oxygen and temperature. Overall, smaller individuals grew more rapidly during the 6-week experimental period, and oxygen and temperature interacted to affect growth in complex ways. Survival was lower for the warm treatment, although only four mortalities occurred (91.6\% versus 100\%). Nymphs acclimated to warmer temperatures did not have higher critical thermal maxima (CTmax), but those acclimated to hypoxia had CTmax values (in normoxia) that were higher by approximately 1 degrees C. These results suggest possible adaptive plasticity of systems for taking up or delivering oxygen. We examined these possibilities by measuring the oxygen sensitivity of metabolic rates and the morphologies of tracheal gill tufts located ventrally on thoracic segments. Mass-specific metabolic rates of individuals acclimated to warmer temperatures were higher in acute hypoxia but lower in normoxia, regardless of their recent history of oxygen exposure during acclimation. The morphology of gill filaments, however, changed in ways that appeared to depress rates of oxygen delivery in functional hypoxia. Our combined results from multiple performance metrics indicate that rising temperatures and hypoxia may interact to magnify the risks to aquatic insects, but that physiological plasticity in respiratory phenotypes may offset some of these risks.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244253,225,18,NA,jeb244253,KEY WORDS; Hypoxia; Physiological plasticity; Climate change; Metabolic rates; Respirometry; Physiology

Gary",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Thermal tolerance and associated mechanisms are often tested via the critical thermal maximum (CTmax). The agitation temperature is a recently described thermal limit in fishes that has received little mechanistic evaluation. The present study used a temperate elasmobranch fish to test the hypothesis that this thermal tolerance trait is partially set by the onset of declining cardiorespiratory performance and the cellular stress response. Pacific spiny dogfish (Squalus suckleyi) were screened for cardiorespiratory and whole-organism thermal limits to test for associations between thermal performance and tolerance. Then, biochemical markers of secondary stress, aerobic and anaerobic enzyme activities, and molecular markers of cellular stress were determined for various tissues at the agitation temperature and secondary stress markers were determined at CTmax. In dogfish, the agitation temperature was characterised by increased turning activity within experimental chambers and was equal to the temperature at which dogfish exhibited maximum heart rate. Citrate synthase activity increased at the agitation temperature in white muscle relative to unmanipulated dogfish. Furthermore, lactate dehydrogenase activity and accumulated lactate in the plasma and muscle were not affected by acute warming. Cellular stress was apparent in hypothalamus, gill filament and ventricle, denoted by elevated transcript abundance of the stress response gene hsp70 but not the oxygen homeostasis gene hif1 alpha. Conversely, CTmax was characterised by metabolic acidosis driven by anaerobic lactate production, signifying an increased reliance on anaerobic metabolism between the agitation temperature and CTmax. Together, these data provide partial support for our hypothesis, in that cellular stress, but not declining thermal performance, occurred at the agitation temperature.",2023,10.1242/jeb.246304,226,19,NA,jeb246304,Critical thermal maximum; Elasmobranch fish; Heart rate; Heat shock protein; Hypoxia-inducible factor; Thermal tolerance
article,Rapid adaptive response to a Mediterranean environment reduces phenotypic mismatch in a recent amphibian invader,"Vimercati, Giovanni and Davies, Sarah J. and Measey, John",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Invasive species frequently cope with ecological conditions that are different from those to which they adapted, presenting an opportunity to investigate how phenotypes change across short time scales. In 2000, the guttural toad Sclerophrys gutturalis was first detected in a peri-urban area of Cape Town, where it is now invasive. The ability of the species to invade Cape Town is surprising as the area is characterized by a Mediterranean climate significantly drier and colder than that of the native source area. We measured field hydration state of guttural toads from the invasive Cape Town population and a native source population from Durban. We also obtained from laboratory trials: rates of evaporative water loss and water uptake, sensitivity of locomotor endurance to hydration state, critical thermal minimum (CTmin) and sensitivity of CTmin to hydration state. Field hydration state of invasive toads was significantly lower than that of native toads. Although the two populations had similar rates of water loss and uptake, invasive toads were more efficient in minimizing water loss through postural adjustments. In locomotor trials, invasive individuals noticeably outperformed native individuals when dehydrated but not when fully hydrated. CTmin was lower in invasive individuals than in native individuals, independent of hydration state. Our results indicate that an invasive population that is only 20 years old shows adaptive responses that reduce phenotypic mismatch with the novel environment. The invasion potential of the species in Cape Town is higher than we could infer from its characteristics in the native source population.",2018,10.1242/jeb.174797,221,9,NA,jeb174797,Anuran; Environmental novelty; Invasive species; Locomotor performance; Thermal tolerance; Water exchange
article,Coping with the climate: cuticular hydrocarbon acclimation of ants under constant and fluctuating conditions,"Sprenger, Philipp P. and Burkert, Lars H. and Abou, Beprimerengere and Federle, Walter and Menzel, Florian",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Terrestrial arthropods achieve waterproofing by a layer of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs). At the same time, CHCs also serve as communication signals. To maintain waterproofing under different climate conditions, insects adjust the chemical composition of their CHC layer, but this may affect the communication via CHCs. The detailed acclimatory changes of CHCs and how these influence their physical properties are still unknown. Here, we studied acclimation in two closely related ant species with distinct CHC profiles, Myrmica rubra and Myrmica ruginodis, in response to constant or fluctuating temperature and humidity regimes. We measured how acclimation affected CHC composition and viscosity, and the ants' drought survival. In both species, CHC composition showed strong, predictable responses to temperature regimes. Warm-acclimated individuals had higher proportions of linear alkanes, and less methyl-branched or unsaturated CHCs. These changes coincided with higher solid content and viscosity of CHCs in warm-acclimated ants. Temperature fluctuation caused effects similar to those observed under constant-cool conditions in M. rubra, but led to entirely different profiles in M. ruginodis, suggesting that fluctuating and constant conditions pose very different challenges. Acclimation to dry conditions led to higher absolute amounts of CHCs, which increased the ants' drought survival, whereas temperature acclimation did not. Hence, the temperature-induced CHC changes cannot be explained by the need for waterproofing alone. Although these changes could be non-adaptive, we propose that they serve to maintain a constant CHC viscosity, which may be essential for communication and other functions.",2018,10.1242/jeb.171488,221,9,NA,jeb171488,CHCs; Desiccation resistance; Drought survival; Phenotypic plasticity; Microrheology; Viscosity
article,Preconditioning in the reef-building coral <i>Pocillopora damicornis</i> and the potential for trans-generational acclimatization in coral larvae under future climate change conditions,"Putnam, Hollie M. and Gates, Ruth D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Coral reefs are globally threatened by climate change-related ocean warming and ocean acidification (OA). To date, slow-response mechanisms such as genetic adaptation have been considered the major determinant of coral reef persistence, with little consideration of rapid-response acclimatization-mechanisms. These rapid mechanisms such as parental effects that can contribute to trans-generational acclimatization (e.g. epigenetics) have, however, been identified as important contributors to offspring response in other systems. We present the first evidence of parental effects in a cross-generational exposure to temperature and OA in reef-building corals. Here, we exposed adults to high (28.9 degrees C, 805 mu atm P-CO2) or ambient (26.5 degrees C, 417 mu atm P-CO2) temperature and OA treatments during the larval brooding period. Exposure to high treatment negatively affected adult performance, but their larvae exhibited size differences and metabolic acclimation when subsequently re-exposed, unlike larvae from parents exposed to ambient conditions. Understanding the innate capacity corals possess to respond to current and future climatic conditions is essential to reef protection and maintenance. Our results identify that parental effects may have an important role through (1) ameliorating the effects of stress through preconditioning and adaptive plasticity, and/or (2) amplifying the negative parental response through latent effects on future life stages. Whether the consequences of parental effects and the potential for trans-generational acclimatization are beneficial or maladaptive, our work identifies a critical need to expand currently proposed climate change outcomes for corals to further assess rapid response mechanisms that include non-genetic inheritance through parental contributions and classical epigenetic mechanisms.",2015,10.1242/jeb.123018,218,15,2365-2372,NA,Ocean acidification; Temperature; Parental effects; Epigenetics; Stress
article,Patterns of alternative splicing in response to cold acclimation in fish,"Healy, Timothy M. and Schulte, Patricia M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Phenotypic plasticity is an important aspect of an organism's response to environmental change that often requires the modulation of gene expression. These changes in gene expression can be quantitative, as a result of increases or decreases in the amounts of specific transcripts, or qualitative, as a result of the expression of alternative transcripts from the same gene (e.g. via alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs). Although the role of quantitative changes in gene expression in phenotypic plasticity is well known, relatively few studies have examined the role of qualitative changes. Here, we use skeletalmuscle RNA-seq data from Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus), threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) to investigate the extent of qualitative changes in gene expression in response to cold acclimation. Fewer genes demonstrated alternative splicing than differential expression as a result of cold acclimation; however, differences in splicing were detected for 426 to 866 genes depending on species, indicating that large numbers of qualitative changes in gene expression are associated with cold acclimation. Many of these alternatively spliced genes were also differentially expressed, and there was functional enrichment for involvement in muscle contraction among the genes demonstrating qualitative changes in response to cold acclimation. Additionally, there was a common group of 29 genes with cold-acclimation-mediated changes in splicing in all three species, suggesting that theremay be a set of genes with expression patterns that respond qualitatively to prolonged exposure to cold temperatures across fishes.",2019,10.1242/jeb.193516,222,5,NA,jeb193516,Temperature; Differential exon usage; Phenotypic plasticity; Killifish; Stickleback; Zebrafish
article,Thermoconforming rays of the star-nosed mole,"Tattersall, Glenn J. and Campbell, Kevin L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The star-nosed mole (Condylura cristata) is renowned for its densely innervated 22 appendage star-like rostrum ('star') specialized for tactile sensation. As a northerly distributed insectivorous mammal exploiting aquatic and terrestrial habitats, these vascularized nasal rays are regularly exposed to cold water and thermally conductive soil, leading us to ask whether the star surface temperature, a proxy for blood flow, conforms to the local ambient temperature to conserve body heat. Alternatively, given the exquisite sensory nature of the star, we posited that the uninsulated rays may be kept warm when foraging to maintain high mechanosensory function. To test these hypotheses, we remotely monitored surface temperatures in wild-caught star-nosed moles. Although the tail acted as a thermal window exhibiting clear vasoconstriction/vasodilation, the star varied passively in surface temperature, with little evidence for thermoregulatory vasomotion. This thermoconforming response may have evolved to minimize conductive heat loss to the water or wet soils when foraging.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245127,226,3,NA,jeb245127,Sensory organ; Thermoregulation; Insectivore; Thermal window; Thermography

J. and Hu, Marian Y.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Regulation of ionic composition and pH is a requisite of all digestive systems in the animal kingdom. Larval stages of the marine superphylum Ambulacraria, including echinoderms and hemichordates, were demonstrated to have highly alkaline conditions in their midgut with the underlying epithelial transport mechanisms being largely unknown. Using ion-selective microelectrodes, the present study demonstrated that pluteus larvae of the purple sea urchin have highly alkaline pH (pH similar to 9) and low {[}Na+] (-120 mmol l(-1)) in their midgut fluids, compared with the ionic composition of the surrounding seawater. We pharmacologically investigated the role of Na+/H+ exchangers (NHE) in intracellular pH regulation and midgut proton and sodium maintenance using the NHE inhibitor 5-(n-ethyl-n-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA). Basolateral EIPA application decreased midgut pH while luminal application via micro-injections increased midgut {[}Na+], without affecting pH. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated a luminal localization of NHE-2 (SpSlc9a2) in the midgut epithelium. Specific knockdown of spslc9a2 using Vivo-Morpholinos led to an increase in midgut {[}Na+] without affecting pH. Acute acidification experiments in combination with quantitative PCR analysis and measurements of midgut pH and {[}Na+] identified two other NHE isoforms, Spslc9a7 and SpSlc9a8, which potentially contribute to the regulation of {[}Na+] and pH in midgut fluids. This work provides new insights into ion regulatory mechanisms in the midgut epithelium of sea urchin larvae.

article,"Temperature and dehydration effects on metabolism, water uptake and the partitioning between respiratory and cutaneous evaporative water loss in a terrestrial toad","Senzano, Luis Miguel and Andrade, Denis Vieira",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Terrestrial anurans often experience fluctuations in body temperature and hydration state, which are known to influence evaporative water loss through the skin (EWLSkin) and lungs (EWLResp). These effects arises from associated changes in skin permeability, metabolism and lung ventilation. Herein, we determined the rates of EWLSkin and EWLResp in the terrestrial toad, Rhinella diptycha at different temperatures and hydration states. We measured oxygen uptake rates to verify whether alterations in the partitioning between EWLSkin and EWLResp were associated to metabolic induced changes in pulmonary gas exchange. We also measured the influence of hydration and temperature on water uptake (WU) through the skin. Finally, since estimates of skin resistance to evaporation (R-s) are usually inferred from total evaporative water loss (EWLTotal), under the assumption of negligible EWLResp, we calculate the potential error in accepting this assumption, under different temperature and hydration states. EWLSkin and EWLResp increased with temperature, but this response was greater for EWLResp, which was attributed to the temperature-induced elevation in metabolism and lung ventilation. Dehydration caused a decrease in the relative contribution of EWLSkin to EWLTotal, mirrored by the concurrent increase in the contribution of EWLResp, at all temperatures. Thus, R-s increased with dehydration. WU rates were dictated by dehydration with little influence of temperature. The partitioning between EWLSkin and EWLResp was affected by both temperature and hydration state and, under some set of conditions, considering EWLResp as negligible led to significant errors in the assessment of skin resistance to evaporation.",2018,10.1242/jeb.188482,221,24,NA,jeb188482,Amphibians; Anurans; Thermoregulation; Water balance; Skin resistance; Oxygen uptake

For example, in colder environments, animals tend to be larger and to show higher thermal inertia, as proposed by Bergmann's rule and the heat balance hypothesis (HBH). Additionally, dark coloration increases solar radiation absorption and should accelerate heat gain (thermal melanism hypothesis, TMH). We tested Bergmann's rule, the HBH and the TMH within the Liolaemus goetschi lizard clade, which shows variability in body size and melanic coloration. We measured heating and cooling rates of live and euthanized animals, and tested how morphology and color affect these rates. Live organisms show less variable and faster heating rates compared with cooling rates, suggesting behavioral and/or physiological adjustments. Our results support Bergmann's rule and the HBH, as larger species show slower heating and cooling rates. However, we did not find a clear pattern to support the TMH. The influence of dorsal melanism on heating by radiation was masked by the body size effect in live animals, and results from euthanized individuals also showed no clear effects of melanism on heating rates. Comparison among three groups of live individuals with different degrees of melanism did not clarify the influence of melanism on heating rates. However, when euthanized animals from the same three groups were compared, we observed that darker euthanized animals actually heat faster than lighter ones, favoring the TMH.

Righting response, locomotion and disc tenacity decreased in response to hyposalinity. Severe reductions in coordinated tube foot activities occurred at higher salinities than those that affected adhesion. The results of this study suggest moderate hyposalinities (24-28\%o) have little effect on S. droebachiensis dislodgement risk and survival post-dislodgment, while severe hyposalinity (below 24\%o) likely reduces movement and prevents recovery from dislodgment.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245750,226,13,NA,jeb245750,Climate change; Extreme climatic events; Echinoderms; Muscular hydrostats; Precipitation

Subsequently, individuals were re-acclimated to the opposite treatment. Rodents reared in the warm and subjected to water restriction had lower basal metabolic rate (BMR), total evaporative water loss (TEWL) and body mass (M-b) compared with those developing in the cold treatment; nevertheless, individuals subjected to warm temperatures had greater relative medullary thickness (RMT) and urine concentrating ability (UCA).

Conversely, warm-reared rodents re-acclimated to cold had reduced RMT and UCA, but the metabolic traits of these individuals did not change. These results suggest a trade-off between metabolic performance and renal capabilities that might hinder physiological acclimation.

article,Physiological mechanisms constraining ectotherm fright-dive performance at elevated temperatures,"Rodgers, Essie M. and Franklin, Craig E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Survival of air-breathing, diving ectotherms is dependent on their capacity to optimise the time available for obligate underwater activities, such as predator avoidance. Submergence times are thermally sensitive, with dive durations significantly reduced by increases in water temperature, deeming these animals particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The physiological mechanisms underlying this compromised performance are unclear but are hypothesised to be linked to increased oxygen demand and a reduced capacity for metabolic depression at elevated temperatures. Here, we investigated how water temperature (both acute and chronic exposures) affected the physiology of juvenile estuarine crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) performing predator avoidance dives (i.e. fright-dives). Diving oxygen consumption, `fright' bradycardia, haematocrit and haemoglobin (indicators of blood oxygen carrying capacity) were assessed at two test temperatures, reflective of different climate change scenarios (i.e. current summer water temperatures, 28 degrees C, and `high' climate warming, 34 degrees C). Diving oxygen consumption rate increased threefold between 28 and 34 degrees C (Q(10)=7.4). The capacity to depress oxygen demand was reduced at elevated temperatures, with animals lowering oxygen demand from surface levels by 52.9 +/- 27.8\% and 27.8 +/- 16.5\% (means +/- s.e.m.) at 28 degrees C and 34 degrees C, respectively. Resting and post-fright-dive haematocrit and haemoglobin were thermally insensitive.

Resting f(H) was much lower in free-swimming fish than in those in respirometers (similar to 49 versus 69 beats min(-1)) and this was reflected in their scope for f(H) (similar to 104 versus 71 beats min(-1)) and CTmax (27.7 versus 25.9 degrees C). Further, the Arrhenius breakpoint temperature and temperature at peak f(H) for free-swimming fish were considerably greater than for those tested in the respirometers and given a rapid screening protocol (18.4, 18.1 and 14.6 degrees C; and 26.5, 23.2 and 20.2 degrees C, respectively). Finally, the oxygen level at which bradycardia occurred was significantly higher in free-swimming salmon than in those in respirometers (similar to 62\% versus 53\% air saturation). These results: highlight the limitations of some lab-based methods of determining f(H) parameters and thermal tolerance in fishes; and suggest that scope for f(H) may be a more reliable and predictive measure of a fish's upper thermal tolerance than their peak f(H).",2023,10.1242/jeb.246227,226,18,NA,jeb246227,CTmax; Thermal tolerance; Heart rate; Hypoxia tolerance; Data loggers; Bradycardia

However, particularly during the breeding season, seabirds may be affected by reductions in prey availability and localised oceanographic conditions caused by variations in the environment. The increase in sea surface temperature, triggered by accelerated global warming, is impairing phytoplankton production of omega-3 fatty acids (FAs). Here, we assessed the ecological role of omega-3 FAs on chick development and subsequently on breeder foraging behaviour in two closely related shearwater species foraging in contrasting marine environments. We supplemented chicks with omega-3 FA pills or with control placebo pills and monitored chick growth, chick health status and breeder at-sea foraging behaviour using global positioning system devices. We found that omega-3 chick supplementation reduced the 95\% kernel utilization distribution of short trips of Cape Verde shearwaters, but overall, breeders kept a similar foraging pattern between treatments, potentially influenced by predictable prey patches off the West African coast. In contrast, for Cory's shearwaters, the parents of the omega-3 group greatly reduced the foraging effort. This suggests that the proximity to productive prey patches around the colony may help birds to adjust their effort and, therefore, energy expenditure, to changes in the development of their offspring, as driven by their nutritional status. Overall, our results suggest a link between a chick diet enriched in omega-3 FAs and parental foraging effort, providing insight into their ability to cope with a changing and increasingly stochastic marine environment.",2023,10.1242/jeb.244690,226,13,NA,jeb244690,Essential fatty acids; Quality diet; Supplementation experiment; Foraging behaviour; Contrasting seascapes
article,"Ultraviolet filters in stomatopod crustaceans: diversity, ecology and evolution","Bok, Michael J. and Porter, Megan L. and Cronin, Thomas W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Stomatopod crustaceans employ unique ultraviolet (UV) optical filters in order to tune the spectral sensitivities of their UV-sensitive photoreceptors. In the stomatopod species Neogonodactylus oerstedii, we previously found four filter types, produced by five distinct mycosporine-like amino acid pigments in the crystalline cones of their specialized midband ommatidial facets. This UV-spectral tuning array produces receptors with at least six distinct spectral sensitivities, despite expressing only two visual pigments. Here, we present a broad survey of these UV filters across the stomatopod order, examining their spectral absorption properties in 21 species from seven families in four superfamilies. We found that UV filters are present in three of the four superfamilies, and evolutionary character reconstruction implies that at least one class of UV filter was present in the ancestor of all modern stomatopods. Additionally, postlarval stomatopods were observed to produce the UV filters simultaneously alongside development of the adult eye. The absorbance properties of the filters are consistent within a species; however, between species we found a great deal of diversity, both in the number of filters and in their spectral absorbance characteristics. This diversity correlates with the habitat depth ranges of these species, suggesting that species living in shallow, UV-rich environments may tune their UV spectral sensitivities more aggressively. We also found additional, previously unrecognized UV filter types in the crystalline cones of the peripheral eye regions of some species, indicating the possibility for even greater stomatopod visual complexity than previously thought.",2015,10.1242/jeb.122036,218,13,2055-2066,NA,Mantis shrimp; Ultraviolet vision; Optical filters; Mycosporine-like amino acids; Ancestral state reconstruction

A major challenge has been to monitor oxygen binding characteristics and concomitant pH changes as they occur in vivo, in limited sample volumes. Here we report a technique allowing highly resolved and simultaneous monitoring of pH and blood pigment saturation in minute blood volumes. We equipped a gas diffusion chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectrophotometer and a micro-pH optode and recorded changes of pigment oxygenation along oxygen partial pressure (P-O2) and pH gradients to test the setup. Oxygen binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 mu l of haemolymph from the cephalopod Octopus vulgaris showed low instrumental error (0.93\%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After consideration of photobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, pH optodes yielded accurate recordings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 pH units in response to changing P-O2 from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous recordings along pH gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of pH changes. In this study we showed that a diffusion chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectrophotometer and an optical pH sensor accurately characterizes oxygen binding with minimal sample consumption and manipulation. We conclude that the modified diffusion chamber is highly suitable for experimental biologists who demand high flexibility, detailed insight into oxygen binding as well as experimental and biological accuracy combined in a single setup.",2014,10.1242/jeb.092726,217,9,1430-1436,NA,Diffusion chamber; Oxygen equilibrium curve; Hemocyanin; Haemocyanin; Haemoglobin; pH optode; Octopus; Amphipod; Antarctic fish
article,Differing thermal sensitivities of physiological processes alter ATP allocation,"Pan, Francis T. C. and Applebaum, Scott L. and Manahan, Donal T.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Changes in environmental temperature affect rate processes at all levels of biological organization. Yet the thermal sensitivity of specific physiological processes that affect allocation of the ATP pool within a species is less well understood. In this study of developmental stages of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, thermal sensitivities were measured for growth, survivorship, protein synthesis, respiration and transport of amino acids and ions. At warmer temperatures, larvae grew faster but suffered increased mortality. An analysis of temperature sensitivity (Q(10) values) revealed that protein synthesis, the major ATP-consuming process in larvae of C. gigas, is more sensitive to temperature change (Q(10) value of 2.9 +/- 0.18) than metabolic rate (Q(10 )of 2.0 +/- 0.15). Ion transport by Na+/K+-ATPase measured in vivo has a Q(10) value of 2.1 +/- 0.09. The corresponding value for glycine transport is 2.4 +/- 0.23. Differing thermal responses for protein synthesis and respiration result in a disproportional increase in the allocation of available ATP to protein synthesis with rising temperature. A bioenergetic model is presented illustrating how changes in growth and temperature affect allocation of the ATP pool. Over an environmentally relevant temperature range for this species, the proportion of the ATP pool allocated to protein synthesis increases from 35 to 65\%. The greater energy demand to support protein synthesis with increasing temperature will compromise energy availability to support other essential physiological processes. Defining the trade-offs of ATP demand will provide insights into understanding the adaptive capacity of organisms to respond to various scenarios of environmental change.",2021,10.1242/jeb.233379,224,2,NA,jeb233379,Crassostrea gigas; Larvae; Metabolic rate; Protein synthesis; Temperature; Phenotypic variation
article,Temperature has a causal and plastic effect on timing of breeding in a small songbird,"Verhagen, Irene and Tomotani, Barbara M. and Gienapp, Phillip and Visser, Marcel E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Phenotypic plasticity is an important mechanism by which an individual can adapt its seasonal timing to predictable, short-term environmental changes by using predictive cues. Identification of these cues is crucial to forecast the response of species to long-term environmental change and to study their potential to adapt. Individual great tits (Parus major) start reproduction early under warmer conditions in the wild, but whether this effect is causal is not well known. We housed 36 pairs of great tits in climate-controlled aviaries and 40 pairs in outdoor aviaries, where they bred under artificial contrasting temperature treatments or in semi-natural conditions, respectively, for two consecutive years, using birds from lines selected for early and late egg laying. We thus obtained laying dates in two different thermal environments for each female. Females bred earlier under warmer conditions in climate-controlled aviaries, but not in outdoor aviaries. The latter was inconsistent with laying dates from our wild population. Further, early selection line females initiated egg laying consistently similar to 9 days earlier than late selection line females in outdoor aviaries, but we found no difference in the degree of plasticity (i.e. the sensitivity to temperature) in laying date between selection lines. Because we found that temperature causally affects laying date, climate change will lead to earlier laying. This advancement is, however, unlikely to be sufficient, thereby leading to selection for earlier laying. Our results suggest that natural selection may lead to a change in mean phenotype, but not to a change in the sensitivity of laying dates to temperature.",2020,10.1242/jeb.218784,223,8,NA,jeb218784,Correlated response; Selection; Great tit; Phenotypic plasticity; Timing of breeding
article,Oxidative stress effects are not correlated with differences in heat tolerance among congeners of <i>Mytilus</i>,"Dowd, W. Wesley and Somero, George N.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The physiological mechanisms that limit thermal tolerance are broadly relevant to comparative biology and global change. Species differences in macromolecular stability play important roles in evolved patterns of heat tolerance, but other mechanisms such as oxidative stress have also been hypothesized to contribute. For example, mussels in the genus Mytilus exhibit evolved physiological differences at several levels of organization that have been linked with interspecific differences in whole-organism heat tolerance. Both omics and behavioral studies suggested that variation in resistance to oxidative stress plays a role in these differences. Functional data are needed to test this hypothesis. Here, we compared three Mytilus congeners to examine whether susceptibility to oxidative stress contributes to acute heat tolerance. We assayed the activity of two antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase), as well as levels of oxidative damage to lipids, DNA and individual proteins (using gel-based proteomics methods). In addition, we assessed these oxidative stress responses after repeated episodes of heat stress experienced in air or while immersed in seawater, given that survival and competitive outcomes between Mytilus congeners differ in these two contexts. The results are generally inconsistent with patterns that would be expected if oxidative stress contributes to thermal sensitivity. Rather, the more heat-tolerant congeners suffer comparable or even elevated levels of oxidative damage. As predicted, different treatment contexts led to distinct changes in proteome-wide abundance patterns and, to a lesser extent, protein carbonylation profiles. Overall, the results question the relevance of oxidative damage as a mediator of heat tolerance in this genus.",2023,10.1242/jeb.246033,226,15,NA,jeb246033,Antioxidant; Oxidative stress; Protein carbonylation; Proteomics; Rocky intertidal zone
article,Presence and persistence of a highly ordered lipid phase state in the avian stratum corneum,"Champagne, Alex M. and Pigg, Victoria A. and Allen, Heather C. and Williams, Joseph B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"To survive high temperatures in a terrestrial environment, animals must effectively balance evaporative heat loss and water conservation. In passerine birds, cutaneous water loss (CWL) is the primary avenue of water loss at thermoneutral temperatures and increases slightly as ambient temperature increases, indicating a change in the permeability of the skin. In the stratum corneum (SC), the outermost layer of the skin, lipids arranged in layers called lamellae serve as the primary barrier to CWL in birds. The permeability of these lamellae depends in large part on the ability of lipid molecules to pack closely together in an ordered orthorhombic phase state. However, as temperature increases, lipids of the SC become more disordered, and may pack in more permeable hexagonal or liquid crystalline phase states. In this study, we used Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to monitor the phase state of lipids in the SC of house sparrows (Passer domesticus) at skin temperatures ranging from 25 to 50 degrees C. As temperature increased, lipids became slightly more disordered, but remained predominantly in the orthorhombic phase, consistent with the small increase in CWL observed in house sparrows as ambient temperature increases. These results differ considerably from studies on mammalian SC, which find a predominantly hexagonal arrangement of lipids at temperatures above 37 degrees C, and the increased order in avian SC may be explained by longer lipid chain length, scarcity of cholesterol and the presence of cerebrosides. Our results lend further insight into the arrangement and packing of individual lipid molecules in avian SC.",2018,10.1242/jeb.176438,221,11,NA,jeb176438,Bird; Cerebroside; Infrared spectroscopy; Skin; Water loss

Using flow-through respirometry, we measured daytime resting metabolism, evaporativewater loss and body temperature at air temperatures (Tair) between 30 and 52 degrees C. We found marked increases in resting metabolism above the upper critical temperature (Tuc), which for six of the seven species fellwithin a relatively narrow range (36.2-39.7 degrees C), but which was considerably higher in the largest species, the curvebilled thrasher (42.6 degrees C). Resting metabolism and evaporative water loss were minimal below the Tuc and increased with Tair and body mass to maximum values among species of 0.38-1.62 Wand 0.87-4.02 g H2O h(-1), respectively. Body temperature reached maximum values ranging from 43.5 to 45.3 degrees C. Evaporative cooling capacity, the ratio of evaporative heat loss to metabolic heat production, reached maximum values ranging from 1.39 to 2.06, consistent with known values for passeriforms and much lower than values in taxa such as columbiforms and caprimulgiforms. These maximum values occurred at heat tolerance limits that did not scale with body mass among species, but were similar to 50 degrees C for all species except the pyrrhuloxia and Abert's towhee (48 degrees C).

However, there remain significant gaps in our understanding of how different optical and morphological properties of the integument affect heating rates. To address these gaps, we examined the effect of reflectivity in both ultraviolet-visible and near-infrared wavelengths, surface rugosity (roughness), effective area (area subjected to illumination) and cuticle thickness on radiative heat gain in jewel beetles (Buprestidae). We measured heating rate using a solar simulator to mimic natural sunlight, a thermal chamber to control the effects of conduction and convection, and optical filters to isolate different wavelengths. We found that effective area and reflectivity predicted heating rate. The thermal effect of reflectivity was driven by variation in near-infrared rather than ultraviolet-visible reflectivity. By contrast, cuticle thickness and surface rugosity had no detectable effect. Our results provide empirical evidence that near-infrared reflectivity has an important effect on radiative heat gain.

article,Ammonia excretion in mytilid mussels is facilitated by ciliary beating,"Thomsen, J. and Himmerkus, N. and Holland, N. and Sartoris, F. J. and Bleich, M. and Tresguerres, M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The excretion of nitrogenous waste products in the form of ammonia (NH3) and ammonium (NH4+) is a fundamental process in aquatic organisms. For mytilid bivalves, little is known about the mechanisms and sites of excretion. This study investigated the localization and the mechanisms of ammonia excretion in mytilid mussels. An Rh protein was found to be abundantly expressed in the apical cell membrane of the plicate organ, which was previously described as a solely respiratory organ. The Rh protein was also expressed in the gill, although at significantly lower concentrations, but was not detectable in mussel kidney. Furthermore, NH3/NH4+ was not enriched in the urine, suggesting that kidneys are not involved in active NH3/NH4+ excretion. Exposure to elevated seawater pH of 8.5 transiently reduced NH3/NH4+ excretion rates, but they returned to control values following 24 h acclimation. These mussels had increased abundance of V-type H+-ATPase in the apical membranes of plicate organ cells; however, NH3/NH4+ excretion rates were not affected by the V-type H+-ATPase specific inhibitor concanamycin A (100 nmol l(-1)). In contrast, inhibition of ciliary beating with dopamine and increased seawater viscosity significantly reduced NH3 excretion rates under control pH (8.0). These results suggest that NH3/NH4+ excretion in mytilid mussels takes place by passive NH3 diffusion across respiratory epithelia via the Rh protein, facilitated by the water current produced for filter feeding, which prevents accumulation of NH3 in the boundary layer. This mechanism would be energy efficient for sessile organisms, as they already generate water currents for filter feeding.",2016,10.1242/jeb.139550,219,15,2300-2310,NA,Bivalves; Rh protein; V-type H+-ATPase; Mytilus; Plicate organ

We predicted that evaporative cooling in Burchell's sandgrouse (Pterocles burchelli) is highly efficient and provides the basis for tolerance of very high air temperature (T-a). We measured body temperature (T-b), resting metabolic rate (RMR) and evaporative water loss (EWL) at T-a between 25 degrees C and similar to 58 degrees C in birds exposed to successive increments in T-a. Normothermic T-b averaged 39.0 degrees C, lower than typical avian values. At T-a > 34.5 degrees C, T-b increased linearly to a maximum of 43.6 degrees C at T-a = 56 degrees C. The upper critical limit of thermoneutrality (T-uc) was T-a = 43.8 degrees C, closely coinciding with the onset of panting and gular flutter. Above the T-uc, RMR increased 2.5-fold to 2.89 W at T-a = 56 degrees C, a fractional increase far exceeding that of many other species under comparable conditions. Rates of EWL increased rapidly at T-a > 42.9 degrees C to 7.84 +/- 0.90 g h(-1) at T-a = 56 degrees C, an 11-fold increase above minimal levels.

UV vision has been well characterized in adult stomatopods but has not been previously demonstrated in the comparatively simpler larval eye. Larval stomatopod eyes are developmentally distinct from their adult counterpart and have been described as lacking the visual pigment diversity and morphological specializations found in adult eyes. However, recent studies have provided evidence that larval stomatopod eyes are more complex than previously thought and warrant closer investigation. Using electroretinogram recordings in live animals we found physiological evidence of blue- and UV-sensitive photoreceptors in larvae of the Caribbean stomatopod species Neogonodactylus oerstedii. Transcriptomes of individual larvae were used to identify the expression of three distinct UV opsin mRNA transcripts, which may indicate the presence of multiple UV spectral channels.

article,True UV color vision in a female butterfly with two UV opsins,"Finkbeiner, Susan D. and Briscoe, Adriana D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In true color vision, animals discriminate between light wavelengths, regardless of intensity, using at least two photoreceptors with different spectral sensitivity peaks. Heliconius butterflies have duplicate UV opsin genes, which encode ultraviolet and violet photoreceptors, respectively. In Heliconius erato, only females express the ultraviolet photoreceptor, suggesting females (but not males) can discriminate between UV wavelengths. We tested the ability of H. erato, and two species lacking the violet receptor, Heliconius melpomene and Eueides isabella, to discriminate between 380 and 390 nm, and between 400 and 436 nm, after being trained to associate each stimulus with a sugar reward. We found that only H. erato females have color vision in the UV range. Across species, both sexes show color vision in the blue range. Models of H. erato color vision suggest that females have an advantage over males in discriminating the inner UV-yellow corollas of Psiguria flowers from their outer orange petals. Moreover, previous models (McCulloch et al., 2017) suggested that H. erato males have an advantage over females in discriminating Heliconius 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-OHK) yellow wing coloration from non-3-OHK yellow wing coloration found in other heliconiines. These results provide some of the first behavioral evidence for female H. erato UV color discrimination in the context of foraging, lending support to the hypothesis (Briscoe et al., 2010) that the duplicated UV opsin genes function together in UV color vision.

Lab-reared Nematostella vectensis sea anemones exhibit circadian behavioral and physiological rhythms. Given that these anemones inhabit shallow estuarine environments subject to tidal inputs, it was unclear whether circadian rhythmicity would persist following entrainment in natural conditions, or whether circatidal periodicity would predominate. Nematostella were conditioned within a marsh environment, where they experienced strong daily temperature cycles as well as brief tidal flooding around the full and new moons. Upon retrieval, anemones exhibited strong circadian (similar to 24 h) activity rhythms under a light-dark cycle or continuous darkness, but reduced circadian rhythmicity under continuous light. However, some individuals in each light condition showed circadian rhythmicity, and a few individuals showed circatidal rhythmicity. Consistent with the behavioral studies, a large number of transcripts (1640) exhibited diurnal rhythmicity compared with very few (64) with semidiurnal rhythmicity. Diurnal transcripts included core circadian regulators, and 101 of 434 (23\%) genes that were previously found to be upregulated by exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Together, these behavioral and transcriptional studies show that circadian rhythmicity predominates and suggest that solar radiation drives physiological cycles in this sediment-dwelling subtidal animal.",2019,10.1242/jeb.205393,222,21,NA,jeb205393,Chronobiology; Circadian; Cnidarian; Entrainment; Subtidal; UV radiation

We tested the hypothesis that muscle remodeling in the amphibious Kryptolebias marmoratus on land is driven by higher O-2 availability in atmospheric air, and the alternative hypothesis that remodeling is induced by a different environmental or physiological condition that fish experience on land. Fish were acclimated to 28 days of air, or to aquatic hyperoxia, hypercapnia, hypoxia, elevated temperature or fasting conditions. Air, fasting and hyperoxic conditions increased (>25\%) the size of oxidative fibers in K. marmoratus while hypoxia had the reverse effect (23\% decrease). Surprisingly, hyperoxia acclimation also resulted in a transformation of the musculature to include large bands of oxidative-like muscle. Our results show that K. marmoratus is highly responsive to environmental O-2 levels and capitalizes on O-2-rich opportunities to enhance O-2 utilization by skeletal muscle.",2018,10.1242/jeb.180257,221,11,NA,jeb180257,Oxidative muscle; Hyperoxia; Slow myosin; Alkaline phosphatase; Succinate dehydrogenase; Kryptolebias marmoratus

D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Two inhibitors of the Calvin-Benson cycle {[}glycolaldehyde (GA) and potassium cyanide (KCN)] were used in cultured Symbiodinium cells and in nubbins of the coral Pocillopora damicornis to test the hypothesis that inhibition of the Calvin-Benson cycle triggers coral bleaching. Inhibitor concentration range-finding trials aimed to determine the appropriate concentration to generate inhibition of the Calvin-Benson cycle, but avoid other metabolic impacts to the symbiont and the animal host. Both 3 mmol l(-1) GA and 20 mol l(-1) KCN caused minimal inhibition of host respiration, but did induce photosynthetic impairment, measured by a loss of photosystem II function and oxygen production. GA did not affect the severity of bleaching, nor induce bleaching in the absence of thermal stress, suggesting inhibition of the Calvin-Benson cycle by GA does not initiate bleaching in P. damicornis. In contrast, KCN did activate a bleaching response through symbiont expulsion, which occurred in the presence and absence of thermal stress. While KCN is an inhibitor of the Calvin-Benson cycle, it also promotes reactive oxygen species formation, and it is likely that this was the principal agent in the coral bleaching process. These findings do not support the hypothesis that temperature-induced inhibition of the Calvin-Benson cycle alone induces coral bleaching.",2014,10.1242/jeb.100578,217,12,2150-2162,NA,Coral bleaching; Heat stress; Symbiodinium; Calvin-Benson cycle; Dark reactions; Respiration; Photoinhibition; Photosynthesis
article,Optic flow and sea-land orientation in the sandhopper <i>Talitrus saltator</i>,"Ugolini, Alberto",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The problem sandhoppers face when they find themselves on the dry sand is to reach as quickly as possible the belt of moist sand near the water. In the present study, I ask whether, alongside many other orienting factors, sandhoppers use the optic flow they experience to maintain their bearing relative to the sea-land axis. Adult individuals of Talitrus saltator were released in a transparent Plexiglas bowl, horizontally placed between four walls with a pattern of vertical black and white stripes. The orientation of one pair of opposite walls was south-north, orthogonal to the sea-land axis of the home beach, whilst the second pair of walls was oriented east-west. The black and white striped pattern of opposite walls could be moved in pairs and in the same direction (speed=4.8 cm s(-1)). The results demonstrate that the optic flow sandhoppers experience when moving on the sea-land axis of their home beach influences their direction of travel and could help sandhoppers in maintaining a straight path to reach favourable ground by the shortest route.",2014,10.1242/jeb.100974,217,12,2041-2043,NA,Orientation; Optic flow; Talitrus saltator
article,Flight-motor-driven respiratory airflow increases tracheal oxygen to nearly atmospheric level in blowflies (<i>Calliphora</i> <i>vicina</i>),"Wasserthal, Lutz T.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"It is widely accepted that an efficient oxygen supply and removal of CO2 in small flying insects are sufficiently performed by diffusion with open spiracles. This paper shows that in the tethered flying blowfly, gas exchange occurs by autoventilation and unidirectional airflow. The air is inspired through the mesothoracic spiracles (Sp1) during the downstroke of the wings and is expired through the metathoracic spiracles (Sp2) during the upstroke. This directed airflow through the thoracic tracheal system was documented by pre-atrial pressure measurements at the Sp1 and Sp2, revealing a sub-atmospheric mean pressure at the Sp1 and an over-atmospheric mean pressure at the Sp2. In the mesothoracic air sacs, the mean pressure is sub-atmospheric, conditioned by the only slightly open spiracles. In a split flow-through chamber experiment, the CO2 released through the Sp2 confirmed this unidirectional respiratory gas flow, implicating an inner tracheal valve. In the thoracic tracheal system, the P-O2 during flight exceeds the high resting P-O2 by 1-2 kPa, reaching nearly atmospheric values. In the abdominal large air sacs, the P-O2 drops during flight, probably due to the accumulation of CO2. Periodic heartbeat reversals continue during flight, with a higher period frequency than at rest, supporting the transport of CO2 via the haemolymph towards the metathoracic tracheae and abdominal air sacs.",2015,10.1242/jeb.121061,218,14,2201-2210,NA,Autoventilation; Insect respiration; Tracheal pressure; Air sac; Tracheae; O-2 supply; Spiracles; Haemolymph; Gas exchange; CO2 release; H2O emission
article,"Critical thermal limits of bumblebees (<i>Bombus impatiens</i>) are marked by stereotypical behaviors and are unchanged by acclimation, age or feeding status","Oyen, K. Jeannet and Dillon, Michael E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Critical thermal limits often determine species distributions for diverse ectotherms and have become a useful tool for understanding past and predicting future range shifts in response to changing climates. Despite recently documented population declines and range shifts of bumblebees (genus Bombus), the few measurements of thermal tolerance available for the group have relied on disparate measurement approaches. We describe a novel stereotypical behavior expressed by bumblebee individuals during entry into chill coma. This behavioral indicator of minimum critical temperature (CTmin) occurred at ambient temperatures of 3-5 degrees C (approximately 7-9 degrees C core temperatures) and was accompanied by a pronounced CO2 pulse, indicative of loss of spiracle function. Maximum critical temperature (CTmax) was indicated by the onset of muscular spasms prior to entering an unresponsive state and occurred at ambient temperatures of approximately 52-55 degrees C (42-44 degrees C core temperatures). Measurements of CTmin and CTmax were largely unaffected by acclimation, age or feeding status, but faster ramping rates significantly increased CTmax and decreased CTmin. This high-throughput approach allows rapid measurement of critical thermal limits for large numbers of individuals, facilitating large-scale comparisons among bumblebee populations and species - a key step in determining current and future effects of climate on these critical pollinators.",2018,10.1242/jeb.165589,221,8,NA,jeb165589,Thermal tolerance; Ramping rate; Chill coma; Metabolism; CTmin; CTmax
article,Opsin expression in <i>Limulus</i> eyes: a UV opsin is expressed in each eye type and co-expressed with a visible light-sensitive opsin in ventral larval eyes,"Battelle, Barbara-Anne and Kempler, Karen E. and Harrison, Alexandra and Dugger, Donald R. and Payne, Richard",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The eyes of the horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus, are a model for studies of visual function and the visual systems of euarthropods. Much is known about the structure and function of L. polyphemus photoreceptors, much less about their photopigments. Three visible-light-sensitive L. polyphemus opsins were characterized previously (LpOps1, 2 and 5). Here we characterize a UV opsin (LpUVOps1) that is expressed in all three types of L. polyphemus eyes. It is expressed in most photoreceptors in median ocelli, the only L. polyphemus eyes in which UV sensitivity was previously detected, and in the dendrite of eccentric cells in lateral compound eyes. Therefore, eccentric cells, previously thought to be non-photosensitive second-order neurons, may actually be UV-sensitive photoreceptors. LpUVOps1 is also expressed in small photoreceptors in L. polyphemus ventral larval eyes, and intracellular recordings from these photoreceptors confirm that LpUVOps1 is an active, UV-sensitive photopigment. These photoreceptors also express LpOps5, which we demonstrate is an active, long-wavelength-sensitive photopigment. Thus small photoreceptors in ventral larval eyes, and probably those of the other larval eyes, have dual sensitivity to UV and visible light. Interestingly, the spectral tuning of small ventral photoreceptors may change day to night, because the level of LpOps5 in their rhabdoms is lower during the day than during the night, whereas LpUVOps1 levels show no diurnal change. These and previous findings show that opsin co-expression and the differential regulation of co-expressed opsins in rhabdoms is a common feature of L. polyphemus photoreceptors.",2014,10.1242/jeb.107383,217,17,3133-3145,NA,Limulus photoreceptors; UV opsin; UV sensitivity; Opsin co-expression; Diurnal rhythms
article,Sex-specific divergence for adaptations to dehydration stress in <i>Drosophila kikkawai</i>,"Parkash, Ravi and Ranga, Poonam",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Several studies on diverse Drosophila species have reported higher desiccation resistance of females, but the physiological basis of such sex-specific differences has received less attention. We tested whether sex-specific differences in cuticular traits ( melanic females and non-melanic males) of Drosophila kikkawai correspond with divergence in their water balance mechanisms. Our results are interesting in several respects. First, positive clinal variation in desiccation resistance was correlated with cuticular melanisation in females but with changes in cuticular lipid mass in males, despite a lack of differences between the sexes for the rate of water loss. Second, a comparative analysis of water budget showed that females of the northern population stored more body water as well as hemolymph content and exhibited greater dehydration tolerance than flies from the southern tropics. In contrast, we found no geographical variation in the males for water content and dehydration tolerance. Third, an similar to 10-fold increase in the rate of water loss after organic solvent treatment of male D. kikkawai suggested a role of cuticular lipids in cuticular transpiration, but had no effect in the females. Fourth, geographical differences in the storage of carbohydrate content ( metabolic fuel) were observed in females but not in males. Interestingly, in females, the rate of utilization of carbohydrates did not vary geographically, but males from drier localities showed a 50\% reduction compared with wetter localities. Thus, body melanisation, increased body water, hemolymph, carbohydrate content and greater dehydration tolerance confer greater desiccation resistance in females, but a reduced rate of water loss is the only possible mechanism to cope with drought stress in males. Finally, acclimated females showed a significant increase in drought resistance associated with higher trehalose content as well as dehydration tolerance, while males showed no acclimation response. Thus, sex-specific differences in desiccation resistance of D. kikkawai are associated with divergence in some water balance strategies, despite a lack of differences in the rate of water loss between the two sexes.",2013,10.1242/jeb.087650,216,17,3301-3313,NA,drought resistance; sex-specific divergence; cuticular traits; energy metabolites; acclimation; D. kikkawai
article,Lens and cornea limit UV vision of birds - a phylogenetic perspective,"Olsson, Peter and Lind, Olle and Mitkus, Mindaugas and Delhey, Kaspar and Kelber, Almut",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Most vertebrates have UV-sensitive vision, but the UV sensitivity of their eyes is limited by the transmittance of the ocular media, and the specific contribution of the different media (cornea, lens) has remained unclear. Here, we describe the transmittance of all ocular media (OMT), as well as that of lenses and corneas of birds. For 66 species belonging to 18 orders, the wavelength at which 50\% of light is transmitted through the ocular media to the retina (lambda(T)(0.5)) ranges from 310 to 398 nm. Low lambda(T)(0.5) corresponds to more UV light transmitted. Comeal lambda(T)(0.5 ) varies only between 300 and 345 nm, whereas lens lambda(T)(0.5) values are more variable (between 315 and 400 nm) and tend to be the limiting factor, determining OMT in the majority of species. OMT lambda(T)(0.5) is positively correlated with eye size, but lambda(T)(0.5) of corneas and lenses are not correlated with their thickness when controlled for phylogeny. Comeal and lens transmittances do not differ between birds with UV- and violet-sensitive SWS1 opsin when controlling for eye size and phylogeny. Phylogenetic relatedness is a strong predictor of OMT, and ancestral state reconstructions suggest that from ancestral intermediate OMT, highly UV-transparent ocular media (low lambda(T)(0.5)) evolved at least five times in our sample of birds. Some birds have evolved in the opposite direction towards a more UV-opaque lens, possibly owing to pigmentation, likely to mitigate UV damage or reduce chromatic aberration.",2021,10.1242/jeb.243129,224,20,NA,jeb243129,Ultraviolet vision; Spectral sensitivity; Bird visual ecology; Colour vision
article,Evolution of plasticity: metabolic compensation for fluctuating energy demands at the origin of life,"Seebacher, Frank and Beaman, Julian",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Phenotypic plasticity of physiological functions enables rapid responses to changing environments and may thereby increase the resilience of organisms to environmental change. Here, we argue that the principal hallmarks of life itself, self-replication and maintenance, are contingent on the plasticity of metabolic processes ('metabolic plasticity'). It is likely that the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA), 4 billion years ago, already possessed energy-sensing molecules that could adjust energy (ATP) production to meet demand. The earliest manifestation of metabolic plasticity, switching cells from growth and storage (anabolism) to breakdown and ATP production (catabolism), coincides with the advent of Darwinian evolution. Darwinian evolution depends on reliable translation of information from information-carrying molecules, and on cell genealogy where information is accurately passed between cell generations. Both of these processes create fluctuating energy demands that necessitate metabolic plasticity to facilitate replication of genetic material and (proto)cell division. We propose that LUCA possessed rudimentary forms of these capabilities. Since LUCA, metabolic networks have increased in complexity. Generalist founder enzymes formed the basis of many derived networks, and complexity arose partly by recruiting novel pathways from the untapped pool of reactions that are present in cells but do not have current physiological functions (the so-called `underground metabolism'). Complexity may thereby be specific to environmental contexts and phylogenetic lineages. We suggest that a Boolean network analysis could be useful to model the transition of metabolic networks over evolutionary time. Network analyses can be effective in modelling phenotypic plasticity in metabolic functions for different phylogenetic groups because they incorporate actual biochemical regulators that can be updated as new empirical insights are gained.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243214,225,5,NA,jeb243214,Metabolism; Acclimation; Environmental change; Network; Cell division

In intracellular recordings, stimulation of green-sensitive photoreceptors with flashes of relatively bright UV/violet light produced anomalous delayed depolarization after the end of the normal light response, whereas stimulation of UV-sensitive photoreceptors with green light elicited biphasic responses characterized by initial transient hyperpolarization followed by prolonged delayed depolarization. To explore the basis for these findings, we used RNA interference to selectively suppress expression of the genes encoding green opsin (GO1), UV opsin (UVO) or both. The hyperpolarizing component in UV-sensitive photoreceptors was eliminated and the delayed depolarization was reduced after GO1 knockdown, suggesting that the hyperpolarization represents fast inhibitory interactions between green- and UV-sensitive photoreceptors. Green-sensitive photoreceptor responses of GO1 knockdowns to flashes of UV/violet were almost exclusively biphasic, whereas residual responses to green had normal kinetics. Knockdown of UVO reduced the responses of UV-sensitive photoreceptors but had minor effects on delayed depolarization in green-sensitive photoreceptors. Angular sensitivity analysis indicated that delayed depolarization of green-sensitive photoreceptors by violet light originates from excitation of (an)other photoreceptor(s) in the same ommatidium. The angle at which the maximal delayed depolarization was observed in green-sensitive photoreceptors stimulated with violet light did not match the angle of the maximal transient depolarization. In contrast, no significant mismatch was observed for delayed depolarization elicited by green light. These results suggest that the cellular sources of the normal transient and additional delayed depolarization by violet light are separate and distinct.",2018,10.1242/jeb.189340,221,21,NA,jeb189340,Cockroach; RNA interference; Ephaptic interactions; Spectral sensitivity; Opsin
article,Multiple functions of ion transport by the nuchal organ in embryos and neonates of the freshwater branchiopod crustacean <i>Daphnia magna</i>,"Morris, Carolyn and O'Donnell, Michael",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The nuchal organ, also referred to as the dorsal organ or neck organ, is a dorsal structure located posteriorly to the compound eye, between the bases of the second antennae of embryonic and neonate branchiopod crustaceans such as the water flea, Daphnia magna. The ultrastructure of the nuchal organ is similar to ion-transporting tissues in other crustaceans, including abundant mitochondria and extensive amplification of apical and basal plasma membranes through microvilli and infoldings, but direct evidence for ion transport is lacking. We used the scanning ion-selective electrode technique to measure transport of Na+, K+, H+, Cl-, NH4+ and Ca2+ across the nuchal organ and body surface of embryos and neonates bathed in dechlorinated Hamilton tap water. Influx of Na+ and efflux of H+ and NH4+ was found to occur across the nuchal organ of both embryos and neonates. We propose that the efflux of K+ and Cl- across the nuchal organ in embryos is related to the expansion of the haemocoel and release of intracellular solutes into the extracellular space during development. K+ is taken up across the nuchal organ later during development, coincident with expansion of the intracellular compartment through the development of gills and other organs. Ca2+ influx across the nuchal organ and body surface of neonates but not embryos is presumably related to calcification of the exoskeleton. Increases in the levels of Na+ and Ca2+ in the water within the brood chamber suggest maternal provisioning of ions for uptake by the embryos. Our data thus support roles for the nuchal organ in ionoregulation, pH regulation and nitrogenous waste excretion.",2019,10.1242/jeb.211128,222,22,NA,jeb211128,pH regulation; Nitrogen excretion; Acid-base balance; Freshwater ionoregulation; Calcification

J. and Lau, Gigi Y. and Richards, Jeffrey G.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The freshwater turtle Trachemys scripta can survive in the complete absence of O-2 (anoxia) for periods lasting several months. In mammals, anoxia leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, which culminates in cellular necrosis and apoptosis. Despite the obvious clinical benefits of understanding anoxia tolerance, little is known about the effects of chronic oxygen deprivation on the function of turtle mitochondria. In this study, we compared mitochondrial function in hearts of T. scripta exposed to either normoxia or 2. weeks of complete anoxia at 5 degrees C and during simulated acute anoxia/reoxygenation. Mitochondrial respiration, electron transport chain activities, enzyme activities, proton conductance and membrane potential were measured in permeabilised cardiac fibres and isolated mitochondria. Two weeks of anoxia exposure at 5 degrees C resulted in an increase in lactate, and decreases in ATP, glycogen, pH and phosphocreatine in the heart. Mitochondrial proton conductance and membrane potential were similar between experimental groups, while aerobic capacity was dramatically reduced. The reduced aerobic capacity was the result of a severe downregulation of the F1FO-ATPase (Complex V), which we assessed as a decrease in enzyme activity. Furthermore, in stark contrast to mammalian paradigms, isolated turtle heart mitochondria endured 20 min of anoxia followed by reoxygenation without any impact on subsequent ADP-stimulated O-2 consumption (State III respiration) or State IV respiration. Results from this study demonstrate that turtle mitochondria remodel in response to chronic anoxia exposure and a reduction in Complex V activity is a fundamental component of mitochondrial and cellular anoxia survival.",2013,10.1242/jeb.087155,216,17,3283-3293,NA,mitochondria; turtle; heart; proton conductance; anoxia; hypoxia; electron transport chain; oxidative phosphorylation

We measured the resting metabolism of three spotted seals (Phoca largha), one ringed seal (Pusa hispida) and one bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus) during and outside the molting period, while resting in water and when hauled out. Metabolic rates were elevated in spotted and ringed seals during molt, but comparable in water and air for individuals of all species, regardless of molt status.

Most vertebrate studies suggest that anoxia tolerance involves the ability to maintain cellular ATP despite the loss of aerobic metabolism. However, insects such as adult Drosophila melanogaster are able to survive long periods of anoxia (LT50: similar to 8 h) in a hypo-energetic state characterized by low [}ATP]. In this study, we tested for possible mechanisms that allow D. melanogaster adults to survive long periods of anoxia. Adults are paralyzed within 30 s, and after 2 h of anoxia, ATP was 3\% of normal, extracellular potassium concentration ({[}K+](o)) increased threefold, pH dropped 1 unit, yet survival was 100\%. With 0.5-6 h of anoxia, adults maintained low but constant ATP levels while {[}K+](o) and pH(o) continued to change. When returned to normoxia, adults restored [}K+](o) and activity. With longer durations of anoxia, ATP levels decreased and {[}K+](o) rose further, and both correlated tightly with decreased survival. This response contrasts with the anoxia-sensitive larval stage (LT50: similar to 1 h). During anoxia, larvae attempted escape for up to 30 min and after 2 h of anoxia, ATP was <1\% of resting, {[}K+](o) increased by 50\%, hemolymph pH fell by 1 unit, and survival was zero. The superior anoxia tolerance of adult D. melanogaster appears to be due to the capacity to maintain a paralytic hypometabolic state with low but non-zero ATP levels, and to be able to tolerate extreme extracellular ionic variability.",2018,10.1242/jeb.177147,221,12,NA,jeb177147,ATP; Ion homeostasis; Extracellular potassium; D. melanogaster

Cold-submerged frogs survive aerobically for several months relying exclusively on cutaneous gas exchangewhilemaintaining temperature-specific acid-base balance. Depending on the overwintering hibernaculum, frogs in northern latitudes could spend several months without access to air, the need to breathe or the chemosensory drive to use neuromuscular processes that regulate and enable pulmonary ventilation. Therefore, we performed experiments to determine whether aspects of the respiratory control system of bullfrogs, Lithobates catesbeianus, are maintained or suppressed following minimal use of air breathing in overwintering environments. Based on the necessity for control of lung ventilation in early spring, we hypothesized that critical components of the respiratory control systemof bullfrogs would be functional following simulated overwintering. We found that bullfrogs recently removed from simulated overwintering environments exhibited similar resting ventilation when assessed at 24 degrees C compared with warm-acclimated control bullfrogs. Additionally, ventilation met resting metabolic and, presumably, acid-base regulation requirements, indicating preservation of basal respiratory function despite prolonged disuse in the cold. Recently emerged bullfrogs underwent similar increases in ventilation during acute oxygen lack (aerial hypoxia) compared with warm-acclimated frogs; however, CO2-related hyperventilation was significantly blunted following overwintering. Overcoming challenges to gas exchange during overwintering have garnered attention in ectothermic vertebrates, but this study uncovers robust and labile aspects of the respiratory control systemat a time point correlating with early spring following minimal to no use of lung breathing in coldaquatic overwintering habitats.",2016,10.1242/jeb.136259,219,13,2003-2014,NA,Temperature acclimation; Control of breathing; Bullfrog; Environmental physiology; Hypercarbia; Hypoxia

Often this involves the ability to tolerate dehydration, which can have adverse physiological effects and is typically considered a physiological stressor. While having many functions, the hormone corticosterone (CORT) is often released in response to stressors, yet increasing plasma CORT while dehydrated could be considered maladaptive, especially for species that experience predictable bouts of dehydration and have related coping mechanisms. Elevating CORT could reduce immunocompetence and have other negative physiological effects. Thus, such species likely have CORT and immune responses adapted to experiencing seasonal droughts. We evaluated how dehydration affects CORT and immune function in eight squamate species that naturally experience varied water limitation. We tested whether hydric state affected plasma CORT concentrations and aspects of immunocompetence (lysis, agglutination, bacterial killing ability and white blood cell counts) differently among species based on how seasonally water limited they are and whether this is constrained by phylogeny. The species represented four familial pairs, with one species of each pair inhabiting environments with frequent access to water and one naturally experiencing extended periods (>30 days) with no access to standing water. The effects of dehydration on CORT and immunity varied among species. Increases in CORT were generally not associated with reduced immunocompetence, indicating CORT and immunity might be decoupled in some species.

Because their gut is the first site of interaction with pathogens, it is important to understand A. aegypti gut physiology. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of pH control in the midgut of A. aegypti females under different nutritional conditions. We found that unfed females have an acidic midgut (pH = 6). The midgut of unfed insects is actively maintained at pH 6 regardless of the ingestion of either alkaline or acidic buffered solutions. V-ATPases are responsible for acidification after ingestion of alkaline solutions. In blood- fed females, the abdominal midgut becomes alkaline (pH 7.54), and the luminal pH decreases slightly throughout blood digestion. Only ingested proteins were able to trigger this abrupt increase in abdominal pH. The ingestion of amino acids, even at high concentrations, did not induce alkalinisation. During blood digestion, the thoracic midgut remains acidic, becoming a suitable compartment for carbohydrate digestion, which is in accordance with the higher alpha-glucolytic activity detected in this compartment. Ingestion of blood releases alkalising hormones in the haemolymph, which induce alkalinisation in ex vivo preparations. This study shows that adult A. aegypti females have a very similar gut physiology to that previously described for Lutzomyia longipalpis. It is likely that all haematophagous Nematocera exhibit the same type of physiological behaviour.",2017,10.1242/jeb.158956,220,18,3355-3362,NA,Diptera; Nematocera; Mosquitoes; Haematophagous insects; Digestion

Although potentially providing an energetic benefit through reduced maintenance and thermal costs, little is known about the cascading effects that may alter energy expenditure during activity, dive responses and overall energy budgets for these warm-water species. To examine this, we used open-flow respirometry to measure the energy expended during resting and swimming in both species. We found that the average resting metabolic rates (RMRs) for both the adult monk seal (753.8 +/- 26.1 kJ h(-1), mean +/- s.e.m.) and manatees (887.7 +/- 19.5 kJ h(-1)) were lower than predicted for cold-water marine mammal species of similar body mass. Despite these relatively low RMRs, both total cost per stroke and total cost of transport (COTTOT) during submerged swimming were similar to predictions for comparably sized marine mammals (adult monk seal: cost per stroke=5.0 +/- 0.2 J kg(-1) stroke(-1), COTTOT =1.7 +/- 0.1 J kg(-1) m(-1); manatees: cost per stroke=2.0 +/- 0.4 J kg(-1) stroke(-1),COTTOT =0.87 +/- 0.17 J kg(-1) m(-1)). These lower maintenance costs result in less variability in adjustable metabolic costs that occur during submergence for warm-water species. However, these reduced maintenance costs do not appear to confer an advantage in overall energetic costs during activity, potentially limiting the capacity of warm-water species to respond to anthropogenic or environmental threats that require increased energy expenditure.",2021,10.1242/jeb.237628,224,15,NA,jeb237628,Diving; Swimming; Energetic; Trichechus manatus latirostris; Neomonachus schauinslandi; Dive response
article,Detection and selective avoidance of near ultraviolet radiation by an aquatic annelid: the medicinal leech,"Jellies, John",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Medicinal leeches are aquatic predators that inhabit surface waters during daylight and also leave the water where they might be exposed to less screened light. Whereas the leech visual system has been shown to respond to visible light, leeches in the genus Hirudo do not appear to be as negatively phototactic as one might expect in order to avoid potential ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-induced damage. I used high intensity light emitting diodes to test the hypothesis that leeches could detect and specifically avoid near UVR (395-405 nm). Groups of unfed juvenile leeches exhibited a robust negative phototaxis to UVR, but had no behavioral response to blue or red and only a slight negative phototaxis to green and white light. Individual leeches also exhibited a vigorous negative phototaxis to UVR; responding in 100\% of trials compared with modest negative responses to visible light (responding in similar to 8\% of the trials). The responses in fed and unfed leeches were comparable for UVR stimuli. The responses depended upon the stimulus site: leeches shortened away from UV light to the head, and extended away from UV light to the tail. Electrophysiological nerve recordings showed that the cephalic eyes responded vigorously to UVR. Additionally, individual leech photoreceptors also showed strong responses to UVR, and a higher-order neuron associated with shortening and rapid behavioral responses, the S-cell, was activated by UVR, on both the head and tail. These results demonstrate that the leech can detect UVR and is able to discriminate behaviorally between UVR and visible light.",2014,10.1242/jeb.094243,217,6,974-985,NA,Hirudo; Invertebrate; Leech; Light; Escape; Ultraviolet radiation

By contrast to most other non-human primates, macaque monkeys are distributed widely among tropical, temperate and subarctic regions, and thus some species need to condition the inhaled air in cool and dry ambient atmospheric areas. The internal nasal anatomy is believed to have undergone adaptive modifications to improve the air-conditioning performance. Furthermore, the maxillary sinus (MS), an accessory hollow communicating with the nasal cavity, is found in macaques, whereas it is absent in most other extant Old World monkeys, including savanna monkeys. In this study, we used computational fluid dynamics simulations to simulate the airflow and heat and water exchange over the mucosal surface in the nasal passage. Using the topology models of the nasal cavity with and without the MS, we demonstrated that the MS makes little contribution to the airflow pattern and the air-conditioning performance within the nasal cavity in macaques. Instead, the inhaled air is conditioned well in the anterior portion of the nasal cavity before reaching the MS in both macaques and savanna monkeys. These findings suggest that the evolutionary modifications and coetaneous variations in the nasal anatomy are rather independent of transitions and variations in the climate and atmospheric environment found in the habitats of macaques.",2015,10.1242/jeb.118059,218,15,2394-2401,NA,Computational fluid dynamics; Humidity; Nasal airflow; Nasal cavity; Primates; Temperature

Cetacea have access to four potential sources of water: surrounding salt oceanic water, dietary free water, metabolic water and inhaled water vapour to a lesser degree. Here, we measured the O-18/O-16 oxygen isotope ratio of blood plasma from 13 specimens belonging to two species of Cetacea raised under human care (four killer whales Orcinus orca, nine common bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus) to investigate and quantify the contribution of preformed water (dietary free water, surrounding salt oceanic water) and metabolic water to Cetacea body water using a box-modelling approach. The oxygen isotope composition of Cetacea blood plasma indicates that dietary free water and metabolic water contribute to more than 90\% of the total water input in weight for cetaceans, with the remaining 10\% consisting of inhaled water vapour and surrounding water accidentally ingested or absorbed through the skin. Moreover, the contribution of metabolic water appears to be more important in organisms with a more lipid-rich diet. Beyond these physiological and conservation biology implications, this study opens up questions that need to be addressed, such as the applicability of the oxygen isotope composition of cetacean body fluids and skeletal elements as an environmental proxy of the oxygen isotope composition of present and past marine waters.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245648,226,23,NA,jeb245648,Body water; Cetacea; Common bottlenose dolphin; Killer whale; Oxygen isotopes
article,Experimental manipulations of tissue oxygen supply do not affect warming tolerance of European perch,"Brijs, Jeroen and Jutfelt, Fredrik and Clark, Timothy D. and Grans, Albin and Ekstrom, Andreas and Sandblom, Erik",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"A progressive inability of the cardiorespiratory system to maintain systemic oxygen supply at elevated temperatures has been suggested to reduce aerobic scope and the upper thermal limit of aquatic ectotherms. However, few studies have directly investigated the dependence of thermal limits on oxygen transport capacity. By manipulating oxygen availability (via environmental hyperoxia) and blood oxygen carrying capacity (via experimentally induced anaemia) in European perch (Perca fluviatilis Linneaus), we investigated the effects of oxygen transport capacity on aerobic scope and the critical thermal maximum (CTmax). Hyperoxia resulted in a twofold increase in aerobic scope at the control temperature of 23 degrees C, but this did not translate to an elevated CTmax in comparison with control fish (34.6 +/- 0.1 versus 34.0 +/- 0.5 degrees C, respectively). Anaemia (similar to 43\% reduction in haemoglobin concentration) did not cause a reduction in aerobic scope or CTmax (33.8 +/- 0.3 degrees C) compared with control fish. Additionally, oxygen consumption rates of anaemic perch during thermal ramping increased in a similar exponential manner to that in control fish, highlighting that perch have an impressive capacity to compensate for a substantial reduction in blood oxygen carrying capacity. Taken together, these results indicate that oxygen limitation is not a universal mechanism determining the CTmax of fishes.",2015,10.1242/jeb.121889,218,15,2448-2454,NA,Metabolism; Oxygen consumption; Aerobic scope; Hyperoxia; Anaemia; Temperature

These include variations in the topography, spectral sensitivity and density of retinal photoreceptors, and changes in the eye's gross anatomy and spectral transmission characteristics. We have characterised visual spectral sensitivity in the murid rodent Rhabdomys pumilio (the fourstriped grass mouse), which is in the same family as (nocturnal) mice and rats but exhibits a strong diurnal niche. As is common in diurnal species, the R. pumilio lens acts as a long-pass spectral filter, providing limited transmission of light <400 nm. Conversely, we found strong sequence homologies with the R. pumilio SWS and MWS opsins and those of related nocturnal species (mice and rats) whose SWS opsins are maximally sensitive in the near-UV. We continued to assess in vivo spectral sensitivity of cone vision using electroretinography and multi-channel recordings from the visual thalamus. These revealed that responses across the human visible range could be adequately described by those of a single pigment (assumed to be MWSopsin) maximally sensitive at similar to 500 nm, but that sensitivity in the near-UV required inclusion of a second pigment whose peak sensitivity lay well into the UV range (lambda(max)<400 nm, probably similar to 360 nm). We therefore conclude that, despite the UV-filtering effects of the lens, R. pumilio retains an SWS pigment with a UV-A lambda(max). In effect, this somewhat paradoxical combination of longpass lens and UV-A lambda(max) results in narrow-band sensitivity for SWS cone pathways in the UV-A range.",2020,10.1242/jeb.215368,223,11,NA,jeb215368,Diurnality; Photoreceptor; Opsin
article,Ultraviolet sensitivity and colour vision in raptor foraging,"Lind, Olle and Mitkus, Mindaugas and Olsson, Peter and Kelber, Almut",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Raptors have excellent vision, yet it is unclear how they use colour information. It has been suggested that raptors use ultraviolet (UV) reflections from vole urine to find good hunting grounds. In contrast, UV plumage colours in songbirds such as blue tits are assumed to be `hidden' communication signals, inconspicuous to raptors. This ambiguity results from a lack of knowledge about raptor ocular media transmittance, which sets the limit for UV sensitivity. We measured ocular media transmittance in common buzzards (Buteo buteo), sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus), red kites (Milvus milvus) and kestrels (Falco tinnunculus) so that, for the first time, raptor UV sensitivity can be fully described. With this information, and new measurements of vole urine reflectance, we show that (i) vole urine is unlikely to provide a reliable visual signal to hunting raptors and (ii) blue tit plumage colours are more contrasting to blue tits than to sparrowhawks because of UV reflectance. However, as the difference between blue tit and sparrowhawk vision is subtle, we suggest that behavioural data are needed to fully resolve this issue. UV cues are of little or no importance to raptors in both vole and songbird interactions and the role of colour vision in raptor foraging remains unclear.",2013,10.1242/jeb.082834,216,10,1819-1826,NA,ultraviolet reflectance; ocular media transmittance; bird vision; raptor hunting behaviour; visual modelling; vole urine

We subjected a laboratory colony (G3) and wild Sahelian mosquitoes during the rainy and dry seasons to desiccation assays. The thoracic spiracles and amount and composition of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) of individual mosquitoes were measured to determine the effects of these traits on desiccation tolerance. The relative humidity of the assay, body water available, rate of water loss and water content at death accounted for 88\% of the variation in desiccation tolerance. Spiracle size did not affect the rate of water loss or desiccation tolerance of the colony mosquitoes, as was the case for the total CHCs. However, six CHCs accounted for 71\% of the variation in desiccation tolerance and three accounted for 72\% of the variation in the rate of water loss. Wild A. coluzzii exhibited elevated desiccation tolerance during the dry season. During that time, relative thorax and spiracle sizes were smaller than during the rainy season. A smaller spiracle size appeared to increase A. coluzzii's desiccation tolerance, but was not statistically significant. Seasonal changes in CHC composition were detected in Sahelian A. coluzzii. Stepwise regression models suggested the effect of particular CHCs on desiccation tolerance. In conclusion, the combination of particular CHCs along with the total amount of CHCs is a primary mechanism conferring desiccation tolerance in A. coluzzii, while variation in spiracle size might be a secondary mechanism.",2016,10.1242/jeb.135665,219,11,1675-1688,NA,Mosquito; Aestivation; Anopheles gambiae; Desiccation resistance; Water balance; Dry season
article,Skeletal muscle metabolism in sea-acclimatized king penguins. I. Thermogenic mechanisms,"Roussel, Damien and Le Coadic, Marion and Rouanet, Jean-Louis and Duchamp, Claude",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"At fledging, king penguin juveniles undergo a major energetic challenge to overcome the intense and prolonged energy demands for thermoregulation and locomotion imposed by life in cold seas. Among other responses, sea acclimatization triggers fuel selection in skeletal muscle metabolism towards lipid oxidation in vitro, which is reflected by a drastic increase in lipid-induced thermogenesis in vivo. However, the exact nature of skeletal muscle thermogenic mechanisms (shivering and/or non-shivering thermogenesis) remains undefined. The aim of the present study was to determine in vivo whether the capacity for non-shivering thermogenesis was enhanced by sea acclimatization. We measured body temperature, metabolic rate, heart rate and shivering activity in fully immersed king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) exposed to water temperatures ranging from 12 to 29 degrees C. Results from terrestrial pre-fledging juveniles were compared with those from sea-acclimatized immature penguins (hereafter `immatures'). The capacity for thermogenesis in water was as effective in juveniles as in immatures, while the capacity for nonshivering thermogenesis was not reinforced by sea acclimatization. This result suggests that king penguins mainly rely on skeletal muscle contraction (shivering or locomotor activity) to maintain endothermy at sea. Sea-acclimatized immature penguins also exhibited higher shivering efficiency and oxygen pulse (amount of oxygen consumed or energy expended per heartbeat) than pre-fledging juvenile birds. Such increase in shivering and cardiovascular efficiency may favor a more efficient activity-thermoregulatory heat substitution providing penguins with the aptitude to survive the tremendous energetic challenge imposed by marine life in cold circumpolar oceans.",2020,10.1242/jeb.233668,223,21,NA,jeb233668,Endothermy; Marine birds; Metabolic rate; Non-shivering thermogenesis; Shivering

Its larval stage is evolutionarily adapted for rapid growth and development under warm conditions and shows high sensitivity to cold. In this study, we further developed an optimal acclimation and freezing protocol that significantly improves larval freeze tolerance (an ability to survive at -5 degrees C when most of the freezable fraction of water is converted to ice). Using the optimal protocol, freeze survival to adult stage increased from 0.7\% to 12.6\% in the larvae fed standard diet (agar, sugar, yeast, cornmeal). Next, we fed the larvae diets augmented with 31 different amino compounds, administered in different concentrations, and observed their effects on larval metabolomic composition, viability, rate of development and freeze tolerance. While some diet additives were toxic, others showed positive effects on freeze tolerance. Statistical correlation revealed tight association between high freeze tolerance and high levels of amino compounds involved in arginine and proline metabolism. Proline-and arginine-augmented diets showed the highest potential, improving freeze survival to 42.1\% and 50.6\%, respectively. Two plausible mechanisms by which high concentrations of proline and arginine might stimulate high freeze tolerance are discussed: (i) proline, probably in combination with trehalose, could reduce partial unfolding of proteins and prevent membrane fusions in the larvae exposed to thermal stress (prior to freezing) or during freeze dehydration; (ii) both arginine and proline are exceptional among amino compounds in their ability to form supramolecular aggregates which probably bind partially unfolded proteins and inhibit their aggregation under increasing freeze dehydration.",2016,10.1242/jeb.142158,219,15,2358-2367,NA,Fruit fly; Diet augmentation; Cold tolerance; Metabolomics; Cryoprotectant; Compatible solute; Preferential exclusion; Protein aggregation
article,Bearded dragons (<i>Pogona</i> <i>vitticeps</i>) with reduced scalation lose water faster but do not have substantially different thermal preferences,"Sakich, Nicholas B. and Tattersall, Glenn J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Whether scales reduce cutaneous evaporative water loss in lepidosaur reptiles (Superorder Lepidosauria) such as lizards and snakes has been a contentious issue for nearly half a century. Furthermore, while many studies have looked at whether dehydration affects thermal preference in lepidosaurs, far fewer have examined whether normally hydrated lepidosaurs can assess their instantaneous rate of evaporative water loss and adjust their thermal preference to compensate in an adaptive manner. We tested both of these hypotheses using three captive-bred phenotypes of bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps) sourced from the pet trade: `wild-types' with normal scalation, `leatherbacks' exhibiting scales of reduced prominence, and scaleless bearded dragons referred to as `silkbacks'. Silkbacks on average lost water evaporatively at about twice the rate that wild-types did. Leatherbacks on average were closer in their rates of evaporative water loss to silkbacks than they were to wild-types. Additionally, very small (at most similar to 1 degrees C) differences in thermal preference existed between the three phenotypes thatwere not statistically significant. This suggests a lack of plasticity in thermal preference in response to an increase in the rate of evaporative water loss, and may be reflective of a thermal `strategy' as employed by thermoregulating bearded dragons that prioritises immediate thermal benefits over the threat of future dehydration. The results of this study bolster an often-discounted hypothesis regarding the present adaptive function of scales and have implications for the applied fields of animal welfare and conservation.",2021,10.1242/jeb.234427,224,12,NA,jeb234427,Lepidosauria; Squamata; Reptile; Water; Temperature; Scale

The aragonite saturation threshold (Omega(a)) for calcification, respiration and organic matter fluxes were investigated experimentally in the Mediterranean Madrepora oculata. Over 10 weeks, colonies were maintained under two feeding regimes (uptake of 36.75 and 7.46 mu mol C polyp(-1) week(-1)) and exposed in 2 week intervals to a consecutively changing air-CO2 mix (pCO(2)) of 400, 1600, 800, 2000 and 400 ppm. There was a significant effect of feeding on calcification at initial ambient pCO(2), while with consecutive pCO(2) treatments, feeding had no effect on calcification. Respiration was not significantly affected by feeding or pCO(2) levels. Coral skeletons started to dissolve at an average Omega(a) threshold of 0.92, but recovered and started to calcify again at Omega(a)>= 1. The surplus energy required to counteract dissolution at elevated pCO2 (>= 1600 mu atm) was twice that at ambient pCO(2). Yet, feeding had no mitigating effect at increasing pCO(2) levels. This could be due to the fact that the energy required for calcification is a small fraction (1-3\%) of the total metabolic energy demand and corals even under low food conditions might therefore still be able to allocate this small portion of energy to calcification. The response and resistance to ocean acidification are consequently not controlled by feeding in this species, but more likely by chemical reactions at the site of calcification and exchange processes between the calicoblastic layer and ambient seawater.",2016,10.1242/jeb.127159,219,20,3208-3217,NA,Scleractinia; Mediterranean Sea; Deep sea; Metabolic energy; Ocean acidification

Anthropogenic impacts affecting hydrology of freshwater systems may exacerbate saltwater intrusion into freshwater habitats. The endocrine system of alligators is susceptible to changes in the environment but it is currently not known how the crocodilian physiological system responds to environmental stressors such as salinity. Juvenile alligators were exposed to 12\%o saltwater for 5 weeks to determine the effects of chronic exposure to saline environments. Following 5 weeks, plasma levels of hormones {[}e.g. progesterone, testosterone, estradiol, corticosterone, aldosterone (ALDO), angiotensin II (ANG II)] were quantified using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Compared with freshwater-kept subjects, saltwater-exposed alligators had significantly elevated plasma levels of corticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol, 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, testosterone, 17 beta-estradiol, estrone and estriol whereas pregnenolone and ANG II were significantly depressed and ALDO levels were unchanged (slightly depressed). On the one hand, saltwater exposure did not affect gene expression of renal mineralocorticoid and glucorticoid and angiotensin type 1 (AT-1) receptors or morphology of lingual glands. On the other hand, saltwater exposure significantly reduced plasma glucose concentrations whereas parameters diagnostic of perturbed liver function (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) and kidney function (creatinine and creatine kinase) were significantly elevated.

The results revealed that both the proportion of feeding individuals and ingestion rate were highest at 16 degrees C. Regardless of water temperature, sea cucumbers appeared to be nocturnal and their peak feeding activity occurred at 00:00 h to 04:00 h. Tentacle insertion rate was not significantly correlated with water temperature (<24 degrees C). In all temperature treatments except 24 degrees C, the proportion of moving sea cucumbers was also observed to be higher at night than during the day. The water temperature above thermal threshold (24 degrees C) for aestivation may alter the diel locomotion rhythm. The highest lipase and amylase activities were both observed at 20 degrees C. The highest activities of lipase and amylase at all temperature treatments were observed at 22:00 h to 02:00 h, which was slightly earlier than the feeding peak. In conclusion, even in total darkness, A. japonicus showed more active feeding and moving activities, and higher digestive enzyme activities, at night than during the day. These results demonstrated that diel feeding and locomotion behaviours, at least in the short term, were not controlled by light or low water temperature (<24 degrees C) but by an endogenous rhythm, and A. japonicus had the ability to optimize the digestive function for the coming feeding peak.

article,Rh versus pH: the role of Rhesus glycoproteins in renal ammonia excretion during metabolic acidosis in a freshwater teleost fish,"Wright, Patricia A. and Wood, Chris M. and Wilson, Jonathan M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Increased renal ammonia excretion in response to metabolic acidosis is thought to be a conserved response in vertebrates. We tested the hypothesis that Rhesus (Rh) glycoproteins in the kidney of the freshwater common carp, Cyprinus carpio, play a crucial role in regulating renal ammonia excretion during chronic metabolic acidosis. Exposure to water pH 4.0 (72 h) resulted in a classic metabolic acidosis with reduced plasma arterial pH and {[}HCO3-], no change in PCO2 and large changes in renal function. Urine {[}NH4+] as well as {[}titratable acidity-HCO3-] rose significantly over the acid exposure, but the profound reduction (fivefold) in urine flow rates eliminated the expected elevations in renal ammonia excretion. Low urine flow rates may be a primary strategy to conserve ions, as urinary excretion rates of Na+, Cl- and Ca2+ were significantly lower during the acid exposure relative to the control period. Interestingly, renal Rhcg1 mRNA and protein levels were elevated in acid-exposed relative to control groups, along with mRNA levels of several ion transporters, including the Na+/H+ exchanger, H+-ATPase and Na+/K+-ATPase. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed a strong apical Rhcg1 signal in distal tubules. Taken together, these data show that renal Rh glycoproteins and associated ion transporters are responsive to metabolic acidosis, but conservation of ions through reduced urine flow rates takes primacy over renal acid-base regulation in the freshwater C. carpio. We propose that an `acid/base-ion balance' compromise explains the variable renal responses to metabolic acidosis in freshwater teleosts.",2014,10.1242/jeb.098640,217,16,2855-2865,NA,Carp; Cyprinus carpio; Kidney; Acid-base regulation; Ion regulation

Here, we investigated the hypothesis that dynamic changes in the pHi of coral host cells are controlled by the photosynthetic activity of the coral's dinoflagellate symbionts. Using live cell imaging and the pH-sensitive dye SNARF-1, we tracked pH in symbiont-containing and symbiont-free cells isolated from the reef coral Stylophora pistillata. We characterised the response of coral pHi in the presence of a photosynthetic inhibitor, the dynamics of coral pHi during light exposure and how pHi values vary on exposure to a range of irradiance levels lying within the coral's photosynthesis-irradiance response curve. Our results demonstrate that increases in coral pHi are dependent on photosynthetic activity of intracellular symbionts and that pHi recovers under darkness to values that match those of symbiont-free cells. Furthermore, we show that the timing of the pHi response is governed by irradiance level and that pHi increases to irradiance-specific steady-state values. Minimum steady-state pHi values of 7.05 +/- 0.05 were obtained under darkness and maximum values of 7.46 +/- 0.07 were obtained under saturating irradiance. As changes in pHi often affect organism homeostasis, there is a need for continued research into acid/base regulation in symbiotic corals.

article,High peripheral temperatures in king penguins while resting at sea: thermoregulation versus fat deposition,"Lewden, Agnes and Enstipp, Manfred R. and Picard, Baptiste and van Walsum, Tessa and Handrich, Yves",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Marine endotherms living in cold water face an energetically challenging situation. Unless properly insulated, these animals will lose heat rapidly. The field metabolic rate of king penguins at sea is about twice that on land. However, when at sea, their metabolic rate is higher during extended resting periods at the surface than during foraging, when birds descend to great depth in pursuit of their prey. This is most likely explained by differences in thermal status. During foraging, peripheral vasoconstriction leads to a hypothermic shell, which is rewarmed during extended resting bouts at the surface. Maintaining peripheral perfusion during rest in cold water, however, will greatly increase heat loss and, therefore, thermoregulatory costs. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the maintenance of a normothermic shell during surface rest: (1) to help the unloading of N-2 accumulated during diving; and (2) to allow the storage of fat in subcutaneous tissue, following the digestion of food. We tested the latter hypothesis by maintaining king penguins within a shallow seawater tank, while we recorded tissue temperature at four distinct sites. When king penguins were released into the tank during the day, their body temperature immediately declined. However, during the night, periodic rewarming of abdominal and peripheral tissues occurred, mimicking temperature patterns observed in the wild. Body temperatures, particularly in the flank, also depended on body condition and were higher in `lean' birds (after 10 days of fasting) than in `fat' birds. While not explicitly tested, our observation that nocturnal rewarming persists in the absence of diving activity during the day does not support the N2 unloading hypothesis. Rather, differences in temperature changes throughout the day and night, and the effect of body condition/mass supports the hypothesis that tissue perfusion during rest is required for nutritional needs.",2017,10.1242/jeb.158980,220,17,3084-3094,NA,Seabirds; Heterothermia; Subcutaneous fat; Normothermia; Fat storage; Heat loss
article,Thermal performance curve of endurance running at high temperatures in deer mice,"Eizenga, Matthew R. and Flewwelling, Luke D. and Warrier, Tanisha and Scott, Graham R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The impacts of warming temperatures associated with climate change on performance are poorly understood in most mammals. Thermal performance curves are a valuable means of examining the effects of temperature on performance traits, but they have rarely been used in endotherms. Here, we examined the thermal performance curve of endurance running capacity at high temperatures in the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus). Endurance capacity was measured using an incremental speed test on a treadmill, and subcutaneous temperature in the abdominal region was measured as a proxy for body temperature (Tb). Endurance time at 20 degrees C was repeatable but varied appreciably across individuals, and was unaffected by sex or body mass. Endurance capacity was maintained across a broad range of ambient temperatures (Ta) but was reduced above 35 degrees C. Tb during running varied with Ta, and reductions in endurance were associated with Tb greater than 40 degrees C when Tawas above 35 degrees C. At the high Ta that limited endurance running capacity (but not at lower Ta), Tb tended to rise throughout running trials with increases in running speed. Metabolic and thermoregulatory measurements at rest showed that Tb, evaporative water loss and breathing frequency increased at Ta of 36 degrees C and above. Therefore, the upper threshold temperatures at which endurance capacity is impaired are similar to those inducing heat responses at rest in this species. These findings help discern the mechanisms by which deer mice are impacted by warming temperatures, and provide a general approach for examining thermal breadth of performance in small mammals.",2023,10.1242/jeb.244847,226,5,NA,jeb244847,Exercise; Metabolism; Thermoneutral zone; Hyperthermia
article,How does the water springtail optically locate suitable habitats? Spectral sensitivity of phototaxis and polarotaxis in <i>Podura aquatica</i>,"Egri, Adam and Kriska, Gyorgy",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Optical detection of horizontally polarized light is widespread among aquatic insects. This process usually occurs in the UV or blue spectral ranges. Recently, it was demonstrated that at least one collembolan species, the water springtail (Podura aquatica) also possesses positive polarotaxis to horizontally polarized light. These hexapods are positively phototactic, live on the surface of calm waters and usually accumulate close to the riparian vegetation. In laboratory experiments, we measured the wavelength dependence of phototaxis and polarotaxis of P. aquatica in the 346-744 nm and 421-744 nm ranges, respectively. According to our results, the action spectrum of phototaxis is bimodal with two peaks in the blue (lambda(1)=484 nm) and green-yellow (lambda(2)=570 nm) ranges, while polarotaxis operates in the blue spectral range. For the first time, we show that collembolan polarotaxis functions in the same spectral range as the polarotaxis of many aquatic insects.

Currently, little is known about the possibility of the dual purpose of an animal colour pattern in the UV region of the spectrum, which is potentially perceivable by both predators and conspecifics for detection or communication purposes. Here, we implemented linearised digital UV photography to characterise and quantify the colour pattern of an endemic Australian Agamid lizard classically regarded as monomorphic when considering data from the visible region of the spectrum. Our results indicate a widespread presence of UV elements across the entire body of the lizards and these patterns vary significantly in intensity, size and frequency between sexes. These results were modelled considering either lizard or avian visual characteristics, revealing that UV reflectance represents a trade-off between the requirements of sexual displaying to conspecifics and concealment from avian predators.",2013,10.1242/jeb.094045,216,22,4290-4298,NA,vision; lizard; pattern; predation; photography

One proposed mechanism seeking to explain such body -size reductions, known as the gill oxygen limitation (GOL) hypothesis, has recently been used to model future impacts of climate warming on fisheries but has not been robustly empirically tested. We used brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), a fast-growing, cold -water salmonid species of broad economic, conservation and ecological value, to examine the GOL hypothesis in a long-term experiment quantifying effects of temperature on growth, resting metabolic rate (RMR), maximum metabolic rate (MMR) and gill surface area (GSA). Despite significantly reduced growth and body size at an elevated temperature, allometric slopes of GSA were not significantly different than 1.0 and were above those for RMR and MMR at both temperature treatments (15 degrees C and 20 degrees C), contrary to GOL expectations. We also found that the effect of temperature on RMR was time -dependent, contradicting the prediction that heightened temperatures increase metabolic rates and reinforcing the importance of longer -term exposures (e.g. >6 months) to fully understand the influence of acclimation on temperature-metabolic rate relationships. Our results indicate that although oxygen limitation may be important in some aspects of temperature-body size relationships and constraints on metabolic supply may contribute to reduced growth in some cases, it is unlikely that GOL is a universal mechanism explaining temperature-body size relationships in aquatic ectotherms. We suggest future research focus on alternative mechanisms underlying temperature-body size relationships, and that projections of climate change impacts on fisheries yields using models based on GOL assumptions be interpreted with caution.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246477,227,4,NA,jeb246477,Temperature-size rule; Oxygen limitation; Ectotherm; Climate change; Brook trout
article,Behavioral and mechanical determinants of collective subsurface nest excavation,"Monaenkova, Daria and Gravish, Nick and Rodriguez, Greggory and Kutner, Rachel and Goodisman, Michael A. D. and Goldman, Daniel I.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Collective construction of topologically complex structures is one of the triumphs of social behavior. For example, many ant species construct underground nests composed of networks of tunnels and chambers. Excavation by these `superorganisms' depends on the biomechanics of substrate manipulation, the interaction of individuals, and media stability and cohesiveness. To discover principles of robust social excavation, we used X-ray computed tomography to monitor the growth in three dimensions of nests built by groups of fire ants (Solenopsis invicta) in laboratory substrates composed of silica particles, manipulating two substrate properties: particle size and gravimetric moisture content. Ants were capable of nest construction in all substrates tested other than completely dry or fully saturated; for a given particle size, nest volume was relatively insensitive to moisture content. Tunnels were deepest at intermediate moisture content and the maximum tunnel depth correlated with measured yield force on small rod-shaped intruders (a proxy for cohesive strength). This implies that increased cohesive strength allowed creation of tunnels that were resistant to perturbation but did not decrease individual excavation ability. Ants used two distinct behaviors to create pellets composed of wetted particles, depending on substrate composition. However, despite the ability to create larger stable pellets in more cohesive substrates, pellet sizes were similar across all conditions. We posit that this pellet size balances the individual's load-carrying ability with the need to carry this pellet through confined crowded tunnels. We conclude that effective excavation of similarly shaped nests can occur in a diversity of substrates through sophisticated digging behaviors by individuals which accommodate both differing substrate properties and the need to work within the collective.",2015,10.1242/jeb.113795,218,9,1295-1305,NA,Solenopsis invicta; Fire ants; Nest construction; Soil cohesion; X-ray
article,Temperature affects susceptibility of intertidal limpets to bird predation,"Pound, Rachel J. and Miller, Luke P. and King, Felicia A. and Burnaford, Jennifer L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"High temperatures resulting in physiological stress and the reduced ability to resist predation can have life-or-death consequences for an organism. We investigated the effects of temperature on the susceptibility to predation for an ectothermic intertidal mollusc (the owl limpet, Lottia gigantea) and its predator (the black oystercatcher, Haematopus bachmani). The ability of L. gigantea to resist bird predation during low tide is determined by the tenacity of attachment to the rock. We developed a transducer to measure the force of predatory attacks on limpets by a captive black oystercatcher, and tested the hypothesis that exposure to warm temperatures during low tide emersion would affect the limpet's ability to resist dislodgement in trials with a morphometrically accurate beak mimic and a live bird. In beak mimic trials, four times as many limpets exposed to warm low tides were removed, as compared with limpets exposed to cool low tides or in `no low tide' submerged conditions. Minimum time before limpet removal in captive bird trials was more than six times longer for limpets in cool low tide or no low tide treatments compared with limpets in the warm low tide treatment. We measured shear forces up to 36.63 N during predatory strikes. These direct measurements of the forces exerted by a living oystercatcher provide context for interactions with multiple prey species. Our data suggest that naturally occurring variation in body temperatures among individual prey items in the field could be an important driver of predator-prey interactions and subsequently community patterns.",2020,10.1242/jeb.213595,223,7,NA,jeb213595,Haematopus bachmani; Owl limpet; Lottia gigantea; Low tide exposure; Black oystercatcher; Tenacity; Thermal history
article,Adhesive performance of tropical arboreal ants varies with substrate temperature,"Stark, Alyssa Y. and Arstingstall, Katherine and Yanoviak, Stephen P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The surface temperature of tree branches in the tropical rainforest canopy can reach up to 55 degrees C. Ants and other small cursorial organisms must maintain adequate attachment in this extreme microenvironment to forage effectively and avoid falling. Ant adhesion depends on liquid secretions that should become less viscous at high temperatures, causing ants to slip. However, tropical arboreal ants have high thermal tolerance and actively forage on hot canopy surfaces, suggesting that these ants can maintain adhesion on hot substrates. We measured tarsal pad shear adhesion of 580 workers (representing 11 species and four subfamilies) of tropical arboreal ants at temperatures spanning the range observed in the field (23-55 degrees C). Adhesive performance among species showed three general trends: (1) a linear decrease with increasing temperature, (2) a non-linear relationship with peak adhesive performance at ca. 30-40 degrees C, and (3) no relationship with temperature. The mechanism responsible for these large interspecific differences remains to be determined, but likely reflects variation in the composition of the secreted adhesive fluid. Understanding such differences will reveal the diverse ways that ants cope with highly variable, and often unpredictable, thermal conditions in the forest canopy.",2018,10.1242/jeb.171843,221,1,NA,jeb171843,Viscosity; Panama; Canopy; Formicidae; Tarsi
article,"Claudin-6,-10d and-10e contribute to seawater acclimation in the euryhaline puffer fish <i>Tetraodon nigroviridis</i>","Phuong Bui and Kelly, Scott P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Expression profiles of claudin-6, -10d and - 10e in the euryhaline teleost fish Tetraodon nigroviridis revealed claudin-6 in brain, eye, gill and skin tissue, while claudin-10d and - 10e were found in brain, gill and skin only. In fishes, the gill and skin are important tissue barriers that interface directly with surrounding water, but these organs generally function differently in osmoregulation. Therefore, roles for gill and skin claudin-6, -10d and - 10e in the osmoregulatory strategies of T. nigroviridis were investigated. In the gill epithelium, claudin-6, -10d and - 10e co-localized with Na+-K+-ATPase immunoreactive (NKA-ir) ionocytes, and differences in sub-cellular localization could be observed in hypoosmotic (freshwater, FW) versus hyperosmotic (seawater, SW) environments. Claudin-10d and - 10e abundance increased in the gills of fish acclimated to SW versus FW, while claudin-6 abundance decreased in the gills of fish acclimated to SW. Taken together with our knowledge of claudin-6 and -10 function in other vertebrates, data support the idea that in SW-acclimated T. nigroviridis, these claudins are abundant in gill ionocytes, where they contribute to the formation of a Na+ shunt and `leaky' epithelium, both of which are characteristic of salt-secreting SW fish gills. Skin claudin10d and - 10e abundance also increased in fish acclimated to SW versus those in FW, but so did claudin-6. In skin, claudin-6 was found to co-localize with NKA-ir cells, but claudin-10d and - 10e did not. This study provides direct evidence that the gill epithelium contains salinity-responsive tight junction proteins that are abundant primarily in ionocytes. These same proteins also appear to play a role in the osmoregulatory physiology of the epidermis.",2014,10.1242/jeb.099200,217,10,1758-1767,NA,Gill; Epithelium; Tight junction; Mitochondria-rich cell; Skin; Osmoregulation
article,Oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance: bridging ecology and physiology,"Poertner, Hans-O. and Bock, Christian and Mark, Felix C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Observations of climate impacts on ecosystems highlight the need for an understanding of organismal thermal ranges and their implications at the ecosystem level. Where changes in aquatic animal populations have been observed, the integrative concept of oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT) has successfully characterised the onset of thermal limits to performance and field abundance. The OCLTT concept addresses the molecular to whole-animal mechanisms that define thermal constraints on the capacity for oxygen supply to the organism in relation to oxygen demand. The resulting `total excess aerobic power budget' supports an animal's performance (e.g. comprising motor activity, reproduction and growth) within an individual's thermal range. The aerobic power budget is often approximated through measurements of aerobic scope for activity (i.e. the maximum difference between resting and the highest exercise-induced rate of oxygen consumption), whereas most animals in the field rely on lower (i.e. routine) modes of activity. At thermal limits, OCLTT also integrates protective mechanisms that extend time-limited tolerance to temperature extremes - mechanisms such as chaperones, anaerobic metabolism and antioxidative defence. Here, we briefly summarise the OCLTT concept and update it by addressing the role of routine metabolism. We highlight potential pitfalls in applying the concept and discuss the variables measured that led to the development of OCLTT. We propose that OCLTT explains why thermal vulnerability is highest at the whole-animal level and lowest at the molecular level. We also discuss how OCLTT captures the thermal constraints on the evolution of aquatic animal life and supports an understanding of the benefits of transitioning from water to land.",2017,10.1242/jeb.134585,220,15,2685-2696,NA,Organisational complexity; Sublethal thermal limits; Aerobic power budget; Aerobic performance; Oxygen supply; Oxygen demand; Temperature adaptation; Water breather; Air breather

D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Sexual displays of acoustically signalling insects are used in the context of mate attraction and mate choice. While energetic investment in sound production can increase the reproductive success of the sender, this entails metabolic costs. Resource allocation to sexually selected, reproductive traits can trade off against allocation to naturally selected traits (e.g. growth, immunity) when individuals' energy budgets are limited. Estimating the magnitude of the costs invested in acoustic signalling is necessary to understand this trade-off and its influence on fitness and life history. To compare the costs associated with acoustic signalling for two ensiferan species, we simultaneously took respiratory measurements to record the rate of CO2 production and used infrared thermography to measure the increase in thorax temperature. Furthermore, to identify what combinations of acoustic parameters were energetically costly for the sender, we recorded the calling songs of 22 different cricket and katydid species for a comparative analysis and measured their thorax temperature while they sang. Acoustic signalling was energetically costly for Mecopoda sp. and Anurogryllus muticus, requiring a 12- and 16-fold increase over resting levels in the CO2 production rate. Moreover, calling increased thorax temperature, on average by 7.6 and 5.8 degrees C, respectively. We found that the song intensity and effective calling rate, not simply the chirp/trill duty cycle or the pulse rate alone, were good predictors for the thorax temperature increase in males.",2017,10.1242/jeb.155846,220,14,2635-2644,NA,Respiratory metabolic costs; Calling energetics; Insects; Infrared thermography; Thorax temperature; Acoustic signalling
article,Distinct metabolic adjustments arise from acclimation to constant hypoxia and intermittent hypoxia in estuarine killifish (<i>Fundulus heteroclitus</i>),"Borowiec, Brittney G. and McClelland, Grant B. and Rees, Bernard B. and Scott, Graham R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Many fish experience daily cycles of hypoxia in the wild, but the physiological strategies for coping with intermittent hypoxia are poorly understood. We examined how killifish adjust O-2 supply and demand during acute hypoxia, and how these responses are altered after prolonged acclimation to constant or intermittent patterns of hypoxia exposure. We acclimated killifish to normoxia (similar to 20 kPa O-2), constant hypoxia (2 kPa) or intermittent cycles of nocturnal hypoxia (12 h:12 h normoxia:hypoxia) for 28 days, and then compared whole-animal O-2 consumption rates (<(M)over dot>(O2)) and tissue metabolites during exposure to 12 h of hypoxia followed by reoxygenation in normoxia. Normoxia-acclimated fish experienced a pronounced 27\% drop in <(M)over dot>(O2) during acute hypoxia, and modestly increased <(M)over dot>(O2) upon reoxygenation. They strongly recruited anaerobic metabolism during acute hypoxia, indicated by lactate accumulation in plasma, muscle, liver, brain, heart and digestive tract, as well as a transient drop in intracellular pH, and they increased hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha protein abundance in muscle. Glycogen, glucose and glucose-6-phosphate levels suggested that glycogen supported brain metabolism in hypoxia, while the muscle used circulating glucose. Acclimation to constant hypoxia caused a stable similar to 50\% decrease in <(M)over dot>(O2) that persisted after reoxygenation, with minimal recruitment of anaerobic metabolism, suggestive of metabolic depression. By contrast, fish acclimated to intermittent hypoxia maintained sufficient O-2 transport to support normoxic <(M)over dot>(O2), modestly recruited lactate metabolism and increased <(M)over dot>(O2) dramatically upon reoxygenation. Both groups of hypoxia-acclimated fish had similar glycogen, ATP, intracellular pH and HIF-1 alpha levels as normoxic controls.

P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"As a consequence of the growing concern about warming of the Arctic Ocean, this study quantified the thermal acclimation responses of Boreogadus saida, a key Arctic food web fish. Physiological rates for cardio-respiratory functions as well as critical maximum temperature (T-c,T-max) for loss of equilibrium (LOE) were measured. The transition temperatures for these events (LOE, the rate of oxygen uptake and maximum heart rate) during acute warming were used to gauge phenotypic plasticity after thermal acclimation from 0.5 degrees C up to 6.5 degrees C for 1 month (respiratory and T-c,T-max measurements) and 6 months (cardiac measurements). T-c,T-max increased significantly by 2.3 degrees C from 14.9 degrees C to 17.1 degrees C with thermal acclimation, while the optimum temperature for absolute aerobic scope increased by 4.5 degrees C over the same range of thermal acclimation. Warm acclimation reset the maximum heart rate to a statistically lower rate, but the first Arrhenius breakpoint temperature during acute warming was unchanged. The hierarchy of transition temperatures was quantified at three acclimation temperatures and was fitted inside a Fry temperature tolerance polygon to better define ecologically relevant thermal limits to performance of B. saida. We conclude that B. saida can acclimate to 6.5 degrees C water temperatures in the laboratory. However, at this acclimation temperature 50\% of the fish were unable to recover from maximum swimming at the 8.5 degrees C test temperature and their cardio-respiratory performance started to decline at water temperatures greater than 5.4 degrees C.

article,The yellow specialist: dronefly <i>Eristalis tenax</i> prefers different yellow colours for landing and proboscis extension,"An, Lina and Neimann, Alexander and Eberling, Eugen and Algora, Hanna and Brings, Sebastian and Lunau, Klaus",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Droneflies, imagoes of the hoverfly Eristalis tenax, are known to possess a preference for yellow flowers, i.e. they prefer to visit yellow flowers and prefer to extend the proboscis to yellow colours. In this study we disentangle these colour preferences by investigating the landing reaction and proboscis reflex with particular reference to intensity, spectral purity and dominant wavelength of colour stimuli and their UV reflection properties. In multiple-choice tests, naive and non-trained flies prefer to land on yellow colours independent of their UV reflection characteristics, but also accept blue, white and pink colours if they absorb UV and are of sufficient brightness. Flies trained to land on colours other than yellow still prefer yellow colours to some extent. Moreover, the flies prefer bright over dark yellow colours even if trained to dark yellow ones. The flies refuse to land on dark colours of all hues. Naive flies exhibit the proboscis reflex only to pure yellow pollen. These experiments show for the first time that landing in droneflies is triggered by a yellow colour independent of its UV reflection properties, but proboscis extension is triggered by yellow colours strongly absorbing blue and UV. The ability to discriminate colours is better than predicted by the categorical colour vision model. The colour preferences in E. tenax represent a fine-tuned ability to visit yellow flowers displaying a UV bull's-eye pattern.",2018,10.1242/jeb.184788,221,22,NA,jeb184788,Syrphidae; Hoverfly; Colour preference; Yellow colour; Flower colour; Colour pattern

However, standardised protocols allowing testing of their learning abilities are currently lacking, and how different olfactory stimuli are learned by these insects remains unknown. Using a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm, we trained individuals and groups of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to associate an odorant conditioned stimulus (CS) with a blood-reinforced thermal stimulus (unconditioned stimulus; US). Results showed, first, that mosquitoes could learn the association between L-lactic acid and the US, and retained the association for at least 24 h. Second, the success of olfactory conditioning was dependent upon the CS - some odorants that elicited indifferent responses in naive mosquitoes, such as L-lactic acid and 1-octen-3-ol, were readily learned, whereas others went from aversive to attractive after training (Z-3-hexen-1-ol) or were untrainable (beta-myrcene and benzyl alcohol). Third, we examined whether mosquitoes' ability to learn could interfere with the action of the insect repellent DEET. Results demonstrated that pre-exposure and the presence of DEET in the CS reduced the aversive effects of DEET. Last, the nature of the formed memories was explored. Experiments using cold-shock treatments within the first 6 h post-training (for testing anaesthesia-resistant memory) and a protein synthesis inhibitor (cycloheximide; to disrupt the formation of long-term memory) both affected mosquitoes' performances. Together, these results show that learning is a crucial component in odour responses in A. aegypti, and provide the first evidence for the functional role of different memory traces in these responses.",2014,10.1242/jeb.101279,217,13,2321-2330,NA,Olfactory learning; Long-term memory; Appetitive conditioning; Disease vector; Aedes aegypti

Rapid regulation of cell-cell adhesion complexes and pathways that regulate stratum comeum formation was consistent with barrier function and mechanical reinforcement. Unique blood vessel architecture and regulation of angiogenesis likely supported cutaneous respiration. Differences in ionoregulatory transcripts and ionocyte morphology were correlated with differences in salinity acclimation and resilience to air exposure.

A. and Hambly, C. and Speakman, J. R. and Valencak, T. G.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Golden hamsters have four times the body size of mice, raise very large litters and are required to produce large quantities of milk during the 18-day lactation period. We have previously proposed that they may be prone to being limited by their heat dissipation capacity. Studies where lactating females are shaved to elevate their heat dissipation capacity have yielded conflicting data so far. With their short pregnancy of similar to 18 days, the large litters and the reported high skin temperatures, they may serve as an ideal model to elucidate the role of epilation for energy budgets in lactating mammals. We shaved one group of lactating females dorsally on the sixth day of lactation, and tested if the elevated heat dissipation capacity would enable them to have higher energy intakes and better food-to-milk conversion rates. Indeed, we observed that females from the shaved group had 6\% higher body mass and 0.78 degrees C lower skin temperature than control females during lactation. When focusing on the phase of peak lactation, we observed significantly higher (10\%) gross energy intake of food and 23.4\% more milk energy output in the shaved females, resulting in 3.3 g higher individual pup weights. We conclude that shaving off the females' fur, even though restricted to the dorsal surface, had large consequences on female energy metabolism in lactation and improved milk production and pup growth in line with our previous work on heat dissipation limitation. Our new data from golden hamsters confirm heat dissipation as a limiting factor for sustained metabolic rate in lactation in some small mammals and emphasise the large effects of a relatively small manipulation such as fur removal on energy metabolism of lactating females.",2020,10.1242/jeb.230383,223,24,NA,jeb230383,Golden hamster; Heat dissipation limitation; Milk production; Pup growth; Shaving; Subcutaneous temperature; Sustained energy intake

The pigment in the yellow scales is 3-hydroxy-DL-kynurenine (3-OHK), which is found in the hair and scales of a variety of animals. In other butterflies like pierids with color schemes characterized by independent sources of variation in UV and human-visible yellow/orange, behavioral experiments have generally implicated the UV component as most relevant to mate choice. This has not been addressed in Heliconius butterflies, where variation exists in analogous color components, butmoreover where fluorescence due to 3-OHK could also contribute to yellow wing coloration. In addition, the potential cost due to predator visibility is largely unknown for the analogous well-studied pierid butterfly species. In field studies with butterfly paper models, we show that both UV and 3-OHK yellowact as signals for H. erato when compared with models lacking UV or resembling ancestral Eueides yellow, respectively, but attack rates by birds do not differ significantly between the models. Furthermore, measurement of the quantum yield and reflectance spectra of 3-OHK indicates that fluorescence does not contribute to the visual signal under broad-spectrum illumination. Our results suggest that the use of 3-OHK pigmentation instead of ancestral yellow was driven by sexual selection rather than predation.",2017,10.1242/jeb.153593,220,7,1267-1276,NA,Visual signal; Yellow pigment; Sexual selection; Predation; Mate preference; Light environment

Recently, animal-borne video cameras have revealed the diet of marine mammals that make short foraging trips. However, novel approaches that allocate video time to target prey capture events is required to obtain diet information for species that make long foraging trips over great distances. We combined satellite telemetry and depth recorders with newly developed date-/time-, depth- and acceleration-triggered animal-borne video cameras to examine the diet of female northern elephant seals during their foraging migrations across the eastern North Pacific. We obtained 48.2 h of underwater video, from cameras mounted on the head (n=12) and jaw (n=3) of seals. Fish dominated the diet (78\% of 697 prey items recorded) across all foraging locations (range: 37-55 degrees N, 122-152 degrees W), diving depths (range: 238-1167 m) and water temperatures (range: 3.2-7.4 degrees C), while squid comprised only 7\% of the diet.

article,Warm acclimation and oxygen depletion induce species-specific responses in salmonids,"Anttila, Katja and Lewis, Mario and Prokkola, Jenni M. and Kanerva, Mirella and Seppanen, Eila and Kolari, Irma and Nikinmaa, Mikko",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Anthropogenic activities are greatly altering the habitats of animals, whereby fish are already encountering several stressors simultaneously. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the capacity of fish to respond to two different environmental stressors (high temperature and overnight hypoxia) separately and together. We found that acclimation to increased temperature (from 7.7 +/- 0.02 degrees C to 14.9 +/- 0.05 degrees C) and overnight hypoxia (daily changes from normoxia to 63-67\% oxygen saturation), simulating climate change and eutrophication, had both antagonistic and synergistic effects on the capacity of fish to tolerate these stressors. The thermal tolerance of Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) and landlocked salmon (Salmo salar m. sebago) increased with warm acclimation by 1.3 and 2.2 degrees C, respectively, but decreased when warm temperature was combined with overnight hypoxia (by 0.2 and 0.4 degrees C, respectively). In contrast, the combination of the stressors more than doubled hypoxia tolerance in salmon and also increased hypoxia tolerance in char by 22\%. Salmon had 1.2 degrees C higher thermal tolerance than char, but char tolerated much lower oxygen levels than salmon at a given temperature. The changes in hypoxia tolerance were connected to the responses of the oxygen supply and delivery system. The relative ventricle mass was higher in cold-than in warm-acclimated salmon but the thickness of the compact layer of the ventricle increased with the combination of warm and hypoxia acclimation in both species. Char had also significantly larger hearts and thicker compact layers than salmon. The results illustrate that while fish can have protective responses when encountering a single environmental stressor, the combination of stressors can have unexpected species-specific effects that will influence their survival capacity.",2015,10.1242/jeb.119115,218,10,1471-1477,NA,Eutrophication; Temperature tolerance; Hypoxia tolerance; Cardiac system; Gill; Oxygen supply and delivery system
article,"Hibernating female big brown bats<i> (Eptesicus</i><i> fuscus)</i> adjust huddling and drinking behaviour, but not arousal frequency, in response to low humidity","Muise, Kristina A. and Dzal, Yvonne A. and Fletcher, Quinn E. and Willis, Craig K. R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Many mammals hibernate during winter, reducing energy expenditure via bouts of torpor. The majority of a hibernator's energy reserves are used to fuel brief, but costly, arousals from torpor. Although arousals likely serve multiple functions, an important one is to restore water stores depleted during torpor. Many hibernating bat species require high humidity, presumably to reduce torpid water loss, but big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) appear tolerant of a wide humidity range. We tested the hypothesis that hibernating female E. fuscus use behavioural flexibility during torpor and arousals to maintain water balance and reduce energy expenditure. We predicted: (1) E. fuscus hibernating in dry conditions would exhibit more compact huddles during torpor and drink more frequently than bats in high humidity conditions; and (2) the frequency and duration of torpor bouts and arousals, and thus total loss of body mass would not differ between bats in the two environments. We housed hibernating E. fuscus in temperature- and humidity-controlled incubators at 50\% or 98\% relative humidity (8 degrees C, 110 days). Bats in the dry environment maintained a more compact huddle during torpor and drank more frequently during arousals. Bats in the two environments had a similar number of arousals, but arousal duration was shorter in the dry environment. However, total loss of body mass over hibernation did not differ between treatments, indicating that the two groups used similar amounts of energy. Our results suggest that behavioural flexibility allows hibernating E. fuscus to maintain water balance and reduce energy costs across a wide range of hibernation humidities.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246699,227,5,NA,jeb246699,Heterothermy; Huddling behaviour; Evaporative water loss; Hibernation; Eptesicus fuscus
article,Orexin-A inhibits fictive air breathing responses to respiratory stimuli in the bullfrog tadpole (<i>Lithobates catesbeianus</i>),"Fonseca, Elisa M. and Janes, Tara A. and Fournier, Stephanie and Gargaglioni, Luciane H. and Kinkead, Richard",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In pre-metamorphic tadpoles, the neural network generating lung ventilation is present but actively inhibited; the mechanisms leading to the onset of air breathing are not well understood. Orexin (ORX) is a hypothalamic neuropeptide that regulates several homeostatic functions, including breathing. While ORX has limited effects on breathing at rest, it potentiates reflexive responses to respiratory stimuli mainly via ORX receptor 1 (OX1R). Here, we tested the hypothesis that OX(1)Rs facilitate the expression of the motor command associated with air breathing in pre-metamorphic bullfrog tadpoles (Lithobates catesbeianus). To do so, we used an isolated diencephalic brainstem preparation to determine the contributions of OX(1)Rs to respiratory motor output during baseline breathing, hypercapnia and hypoxia. A selective OX1R antagonist (SB-334867; 5-25 mu mol l(-1)) or agonist (ORX-A; 200 nmol l(-1) to 1 mu mol( )l(-1)) was added to the superfusion media. Experiments were performed under basal conditions (media equilibrated with 98.2\% O-2 and 1.8\% CO2), hypercapnia (5\% CO2) or hypoxia (5-7\% O-2). Under resting conditions gill, but not lung, motor output was enhanced by the OX I R antagonist and ORX-A. Hypercapnia alone did not stimulate respiratory motor output, but its combination with SB-334867 increased lung burst frequency and amplitude, lung burst episodes, and the number of bursts per episode. Hypoxia alone increased lung burst frequency and its combination with SB-334867 enhanced this effect. Inactivation of OX(1)Rs during hypoxia also increased gill burst amplitude, but not frequency. In contrast with our initial hypothesis, we conclude that ORX neurons provide inhibitory modulation of the CO2 and O-2 chemoreflexes in pre-metamorphic tadpoles.",2021,10.1242/jeb.240804,224,8,NA,jeb240804,Chemoreception; Hypercapnia; Hypoxia; Orexin; Pre-metamorphic bullfrog tadpole; Respiratory control

However, there has been limited research into avian thermoregulation during migration in extreme environments. This study aimed to investigate the effect of flight performance and high altitude on body temperature (T-b) of free-flying bar-headed geese (Anser indicus), a species that completes a high-altitude trans-Himalayan migration through very cold, hypoxic environments. We measured abdominal T-b, along with altitude (via changes in barometric pressure), heart rate and body acceleration of bar-headed geese during their migration across the Tibetan Plateau. Bar-headed geese vary the circadian rhythm of T-b in response to migration, with peak daily T-b during daytime hours outside of migration but early in the morning or overnight during migration, reflecting changes in body acceleration. However, during flight, changes in T-b were not consistent with changes in flight performance (as measured by heart rate or rate of ascent) or altitude. Overall, our results suggest that bar-headed geese are able to thermoregulate during high-altitude migration, maintaining T-b within a relatively narrow range despite appreciable variation in flight intensity and environmental conditions.",2019,10.1242/jeb.203695,222,19,NA,jeb203695,Anser indicus; Avian flight; Biologging; Body temperature; High altitude
article,Survival and arm abscission are linked to regional heterothermy in an intertidal sea star,"Pincebourde, Sylvain and Sanford, Eric and Helmuth, Brian",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Body temperature is a more pertinent variable to physiological stress than ambient air temperature. Modeling and empirical studies on the impacts of climate change on ectotherms usually assume that body temperature within organisms is uniform. However, many ectotherms show significant within-body temperature heterogeneity. The relationship between regional heterothermy and the response of ectotherms to sublethal and lethal conditions remains underexplored. We quantified within-body thermal heterogeneity in an intertidal sea star (Pisaster ochraceus) during aerial exposure at low tide to examine the lethal and sublethal effects of temperatures of different body regions. In manipulative experiments, we measured the temperature of the arms and central disc, as well as survival and arm abscission under extreme aerial conditions. Survival was related strongly to central disc temperature. Arms were generally warmer than the central disc in individuals that survived aerial heating, but we found the reverse in those that died. When the central disc reached sublethal temperatures of 31-35 degrees C, arms reached temperatures of 33-39 degrees C, inducing arm abscission. The absolute temperature of individual arms was a poor predictor of arm abscission, but the arms lost were consistently the hottest at the within-individual scale. Therefore, the vital region of this sea star may remain below the lethal threshold under extreme conditions, possibly through water movement from the arms to the central disc and/or evaporative cooling, but at the cost of increased risk of arm abscission. Initiation of arm abscission seems to reflect a whole-organism response while death occurs as a result of stress acting directly on central disc tissues.",2013,10.1242/jeb.083881,216,12,2183-2191,NA,autotomy; body temperature; intertidal ecosystem; lethal temperature; Pisaster ochraceus; sublethal effect; thermal ecology; thermal heterogeneity

Recent studies performed in snakes, which are generalist carnivorous reptiles, suggest that the benefits of dietary water intake are negated by hydric costs of digestion. Most lizards are generalist insectivores that can shift their prey types, but firm experimental demonstration of dietary water intake is currently missing in these organisms. Here, we performed an experimental study in the common lizard Zootoca vivipara, a keystone mesopredator from temperate climates exhibiting a great diversity of prey in its mesic habitats, in order to investigate the effects of food consumption and prey type on physiological responses to water deprivation. Our results indicate that common lizards cannot improve their hydration state through prey consumption, irrespective of prey type, suggesting that they are primarily dependent upon drinking water. Yet, high-quality prey consumption reduced the energetic costs of water deprivation, potentially helping lizards to conserve a better body condition during periods of limited water availability. These findings have important implications for understanding the physiological responses of ectotherms to water stress, and highlight the complex interactions between hydration status, energy metabolism and feeding behavior in insectivorous lizards.",2023,10.1242/jeb.246129,226,17,NA,jeb246129,Physiology; Lizards; Water balance; Dietary water; Metabolites; Reptiles

Yet, the chronic thermal effects on cardiovascular homeostatic reflexes in fish are little understood although this may have important implications for physiological performance and overall resilience to climate warming. We compared cardiac autonomic control and baroreflex regulation of heart rate in perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) from a reference area in the Baltic Sea at 18-19 degrees C with conspecifics from the Biotest enclosure, a chronically heated ecosystem receiving warmed effluent water (24-25 degrees C) from a nuclear power plant. Resting heart rate of Biotest fish displayed clear thermal compensation and was 58.3+/-2.3 beats min(-1) compared with 52.4+/-2.6 beats min(-1) in reference fish at their respective environmental temperatures (Q(10) = 1.2). The thermally compensated heart rate of Biotest fish was a combined effect of elevated inhibitory cholinergic tone (105\% in Biotest fish versus 70\% in reference fish) and reduced intrinsic cardiac pacemaker rate. A barostatic response was evident in both groups, as pharmacologically induced increases and decreases in blood pressure resulted in atropine-sensitive bradycardia and tachycardia, respectively. Yet, the tachycardia in Biotest fish was significantly greater, presumably due to the larger scope for vagal release. Acclimation of Biotest fish to 18 degrees C for 3 weeks abolished differences in intrinsic heart rate and autonomic tone, suggesting considerable short-term thermal plasticity of cardiovascular control in this species. The heightened hypotensive tachycardia in Biotest perch may represent an important mechanism of ectothermic vertebrates that safeguards tissue perfusion pressure when tissue oxygen demand is elevated by environmental warming.",2016,10.1242/jeb.140319,219,18,2880-2887,NA,Autonomic control; Baroreflex; Blood pressure; Bradycardia; Heart rate; Tachycardia; Temperature acclimation
article,Heat transfer in fish: are short excursions between habitats a thermoregulatory behaviour to exploit resources in an unfavourable thermal environment?,"Pepino, Marc and Goyer, Katerine and Magnan, Pierre",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature is the primary environmental factor affecting physiological processes in ectotherms. Heat-transfermodels describe how the fish's internal temperature responds to a fluctuating thermal environment. Specifically, the rate coefficient (k), defined as the instantaneous rate of change in body temperature in relation to the difference between ambient and body temperature, summarizes the combined effects of direct thermal conduction through body mass, passive convection (intracellular and intercellular fluids) and forced convective heat transfer (cardiovascular system). The k-coefficient is widely used in fish ecology to understand howbody temperature responds to changes in water temperature. The main objective of this study was to estimate the k-coefficient of brook charr equipped with internal temperature-sensitive transmitters in controlled laboratory experiments. Fish were first transferred from acclimation tanks (10 degrees C) to tanks at 14, 19 or 23 degrees C (warming experiments) and were then returned to the acclimation tanks (10 degrees C; cooling experiments), thus producing six step changes in ambient temperature. We used non-linear mixed models to estimate the k-coefficient. Model comparisons indicated that the model incorporating the k-coefficient as a function of absolute temperature difference (dT: 4, 9 and 13 degrees C) best described body temperature change. By simulating body temperature in a heterogeneous thermal environment, we provide theoretical predictions of maximum excursion duration between feeding and resting areas. Our simulations suggest that short (i.e. <60 min) excursions could be a common thermoregulatory behaviour adopted by cold freshwater fish species to sustain body temperature below a critical temperature threshold, enabling them to exploit resources in an unfavourable thermal environment.",2015,10.1242/jeb.126466,218,21,3461-3467,NA,Ectotherm; Internal fish tags; Non-linear mixed modelling; Radiotelemetry; Salvelinus fontinalis; Temperature; Thermoregulation

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is important for thermogenesis during arousals from hibernation, whereas white adipose tissue (WAT) serves as energy storage and thermal insulation. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of environmental temperature on BAT and WAT. We hypothesized that changes to environmental temperature would not influence the pattern of mass gain or BAT and WAT volume in the thirteen-lined ground squirrel (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus). To test this, we housed animals at thermoneutral 25 degrees C (warm-housed) or 5 degrees C (coldhoused). with the same photoperiod (12 h light:12 h dark) over an entire year. Throughout the year we measured the volume and water:fat ratio of WAT and BAT using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We found no evidence of torpor in the warm-housed animals, indicating that this species might not be an obligate hibernator, as previously assumed. Regardless of ambient temperature, BAT volume increased prior to winter, then decreased in late winter with no change in water:fat ratio. By contrast, both body mass and WAT volume of cold-housed animals declined throughout the winter and recovered after hibernation, but thermoneutral housing produced no circannual pattern in body mass, even though WAT volume declined in late winter. Cold exposure appears to be a primary regulator for WAT but BAT may exhibit an endogenous circannual rhythm in terms of depot volume.",2019,10.1242/jeb.194548,222,3,NA,jeb194548,Circannual endogenous rhythm; MRI; Hibernation; Brown adipose tissue; White adipose tissue

We investigated the role of cortisol in regulating seawater tolerance and its underlying mechanisms in an anadromous chondrostean, the Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus). Exposure of freshwater-reared Atlantic sturgeon to seawater (25 ppt) resulted in transient (1-3 day) increases in plasma chloride, cortisol and glucose levels and longterm (6-14 day) increases in the abundance of gill Na+/K+/2Cl(-) cotransporter (NKCC), which plays a critical role in salt secretion in teleosts. The abundance of gill V-type H+-ATPase, which is thought to play a role in ion uptake in fishes, decreased after exposure to seawater. Gill Na+/K+-ATPase activity did not increase in 25 ppt seawater, but did increase in fish gradually acclimated to 30 ppt. Treatment of Atlantic sturgeon in freshwater with exogenous cortisol resulted in dose-dependent increases in cortisol, glucose and gill NKCC and H+-ATPase abundance. Our results indicate that cortisol has an important role in regulating mechanisms for ion secretion and uptake in sturgeon and provide support for the hypothesis that control of osmoregulation and glucose by corticosteroids is a basal trait of jawed vertebrates.",2020,10.1242/jeb.220251,223,18,NA,jeb220251,Acipenser oxyrinchus; Osmoregulation; Salinity; lonocyte; Gill Na+/K+-ATPase

We assessed relationships between body temperature (T-b), air temperature (T-a) and social rank in captive groups in the Kalahari Desert. Socially dominant weavers and bulbuls had lower mean Tb than subordinate conspecifics, and dominant individuals of all species maintained more stable T-b as T-a increased. Dominant bulbuls and larks tended to monopolise available shade, but dominant weavers did not. Nevertheless, dominant weavers thermoregulated more precisely, despite expending no more behavioural effort on thermoregulation than subordinates.

In this study, we show that the AeRh50s co-immunolocalize with apical V-type H+-ATPase as well as with basal Na+/K+-ATPase in the epithelium of anal papillae. The doublestranded RNA-mediated knockdown of AeRh50-1 and AeRh50-2 resulted in a significant reduction in AeRh50 protein abundance in the anal papillae, and this was coupled to decreased ammonia excretion. The knockdown of AeRh50-1 resulted in decreased hemolymph {[}NH4+] and pH whereas knockdown of AeRh50-2 had no effect on these parameters.

Here, we investigated whether the response is also present in hagfish. Ventilatory parameters (nostril flow, pressure amplitude, velar frequency and ventilatory index, the last representing the product of pressure amplitude and frequency), together with blood and water chemistry, were measured in hagfish exposed to either high environmental ammonia (HEA) in the external sea water or internal ammonia loading by intra-vascular injection. HEA exposure (10 mmol l(-1) NH4HCO3 or 10 mmol l(-1) NH4Cl) caused a persistent hyperventilation by 3 h, but further detailed analysis of the NH4HCO3 response showed that initially (within 5 min) there was a marked decrease in ventilation (80\% reduction in ventilatory index and nostril flow), followed by a later 3-fold increase, by which time plasma total ammonia concentration had increased 11-fold. Thus, hyperventilation in HEA appeared to be an indirect response to internal ammonia elevation, rather than a direct response to external ammonia. HEA-mediated increases in oxygen consumption also occurred. Responses to NH4HCO3 were greater than those to NH4Cl, reflecting greater increases over time in water pH and P-NH(3) in the former. Hagfish also exhibited hyperventilation in response to direct injection of isotonic NH4HCO3 or NH4Cl solutions into the caudal sinus. In all cases where hyperventilation occurred, plasma total ammonia and P-NH3 levels increased significantly, while blood acid-base status remained unchanged, indicating specific responses to internal ammonia elevation.

Ventricular force development coupled with gene expression profiles measured on cardiac muscle suggest that combining HUFA depletion with warmer temperatures leads to: (1) a proliferation of sarcolemmal and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ channels and (2) a higher force-generating ability by increasing extracellular Ca2+ influx via sarcolemmal channels when the heart has to sustain excessive effort due to stress and/or exercise. At the individual scale, these responses were associated with a greater aerobic scope, maximum metabolic rate and net cost of locomotion, suggesting the higher energy cost of this strategy.

We investigated developmental plasticity of aspects of the cardio-respiratory physiology of encapsulated embryos of a marine gastropod, Littorina obtusata, surviving exposure to moderate hypoxia (P-O2 = 8 kPa) and compared the development of these survivors with that of individuals that died before hatching. Individuals surviving hypoxia exhibited a slower rate of development and altered ontogeny of cardio-respiratory structure and function compared with normoxic controls (P-O2 > 20 kPa). The onset and development of the larval and adult hearts were delayed in chronological time in hypoxia, but both organs appeared earlier in developmental time and cardiac activity rates were greater. The velum, a transient, `larval' organ thought to play a role in gas exchange, was larger in hypoxia but developed more slowly (in chronological time), and velar cilia-driven, rotational activity was lower. Despite these effects of hypoxia, 38\% of individuals survived to hatching. Compared with those embryos that died during development, these surviving embryos had advanced expression of adult structures, i.e. a significantly earlier occurrence and greater activity of their adult heart and larger shells.

The study of metabolism in aquatic animals is undergoing an especially pronounced expansion, with more researchers utilising intermittent-flow respirometry as a research tool than ever before. Aquatic respirometry measures the rate of oxygen uptake as a proxy for metabolic rate, and the intermittent-flow technique has numerous strengths for use with aquatic animals, allowing metabolic rate to be repeatedly estimated on individual animals over several hours or days and during exposure to various conditions or stimuli. There are, however, no published guidelines for the reporting of methodological details when using this method. Here, we provide the first guidelines for reporting intermittent-flow respirometry methods, in the form of a checklist of criteria that we consider to be the minimum required for the interpretation, evaluation and replication of experiments using intermittent-flow respirometry. Furthermore, using a survey of the existing literature, we show that there has been incomplete and inconsistent reporting of methods for intermittent-flow respirometry over the past few decades. Use of the provided checklist of required criteria by researchers when publishing their work should increase consistency of the reporting of methods for studies that use intermittent-flow respirometry. With the steep increase in studies using intermittent-flow respirometry, now is the ideal time to standardise reporting of methods, so that - in the future - data can be properly assessed by other scientists and conservationists.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242522,224,18,NA,jeb242522,Metabolic rate; Fish; Oxygen; Aerobic metabolism; Replication; Experimental design

Although this family of peptides has an ancestral origin, its function remains poorly understood among protostome species - apart from arthropods. We functionally characterized three G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in the oyster Crassostrea gigas, phylogenetically related to ecdysozoan CCAP receptors (CCAPRs) and to chordate neuropeptide S receptors (NPSRs). Cragi-CCAPR1 and Cragi-CCAPR2 were specifically activated by the Cragi-CCAP1 and Cragi-CCAP2 peptides, respectively, both derived from the same CCAP precursor. In contrast, Cragi-CCAPR3 was only partially activated by CCAP1 and CCAP2 at high concentrations. The Cragi-CCAPR1 and Cragi-CCAPR2 genes were expressed in various adult tissues. They are both most expressed in the gills, while Cragi-CCAPR3 is mainly expressed in the visceral ganglia (VG). Cragi-CCAP precursor transcripts are higher in the VG, the labial palps and the gills. Receptor and ligand-encoding transcripts are more abundantly expressed in the gonads in the first stages of gametogenesis, while the Cragi-CCAP precursor is upregulated in the VGin the last stages of gametogenesis. This suggests a role of the CCAP signaling system in the regulation of reproductive processes. A role in water and ionic regulation is also supported considering the differential expression of the CCAP signaling components in oysters exposed to brackish water.",2021,10.1242/jeb.241588,224,10,NA,jeb241588,Neuropeptides; CCAPs; Mollusk; Hyposaline stress; Reproduction

Seasonal changes in the background levels of deuterium and oxygen-18 in the body water of four captive harp seals and in the freshwater pool in which they were kept were measured over a time period of 1 year. The seals were offered daily amounts of capelin and kept under a seasonal photoperiod of 69 degrees N. Large seasonal variations of deuterium and oxygen-18 in the pool water were measured, and the isotope abundance in the body water showed similar seasonal changes to the pool water. This shows that the seals were continuously equilibrating with the surrounding water as a result of significant daily water drinking. Variations in background levels of deuterium and oxygen-18 in freshwater sources may be due to seasonal changes in physical processes such as precipitation and evaporation that cause fractionation of isotopes. Rapid and abrupt changes in the background levels of deuterium and oxygen-18 may complicate calculation of energy expenditure by use of the DLW method. It is therefore strongly recommended that analysis of seasonal changes in background levels of isotopes is performed before the DLW method is applied on (free-ranging) animals, and to use a control group in order to correct for changes in background levels.",2017,10.1242/jeb.161943,220,23,4450-4455,NA,Water drinking; Oxygen-18; Deuterium; Stable isotopes; DLW method; Pagophilus groenlandica

The role of colour change in communication has received increased attention over the past few decades, yet has been studied predominantly in the context of intrasexual competition. Here, we investigate the role of colour change in mate choice in an animal that can change its colour, the panther chameleon (Furcifer pardalis). We conducted behavioural experiments and colour analysis to investigate whether colour changes, including in the UV range, are involved in mate choice. This study presents evidence of female mate choice for specific aspects of colour change in courting males, both in the visible (i.e. human visible range: 400-700 nm) and the UV range. Females chose males exhibiting more saturation changes regardless of the body region and spectral range. In addition, females chose males showing fewer brightness changes at the level of the lateral line and males showing lower hue changes at the level of the bands and the interbands, in the visible range. At UV wavelengths, selected males showed more brightness changes and higher maximum brightness. These results suggest that male colour change is important in female mate choice in the panther chameleon.",2020,10.1242/jeb.224550,223,20,NA,jeb224550,Chameleon; Intersexual selection; Colour signal; Animal communication
article,Lactate sensing by neuroepithelial cells isolated from the gills of killifish (<i>Fundulus heteroclitus</i>),"Leonard, Erin M. and Weaver, Fiona E. and Nurse, Colin A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Lactate is produced in most vertebrate cells as a by-product of anaerobic metabolism. In addition to its role as a fuel for many tissues, circulating lactate can act as a signalling molecule and stimulates ventilation in air- and water-breathing vertebrates. Recent evidence suggests lactate acts on O-2(-) and CO2/H+-sensitive chemoreceptors located in the mammalian carotid body. While analogous receptors (neuroepithelial cells or NECs) in fish gills are presumed to also function as lactate sensors, direct evidence is lacking. Here, using ratiometric Fura-2 Ca2+ imaging, we show that chemosensitive NECs isolated from killifish gills respond to lactate (5-10 mmol l(-1); pHe similar to 7.8) with intracellular Ca2+ elevations. These responses were inhibited by an L-type Ca2+ channel blocker (nifedipine; 0.5 mu mol l(-1)), a monocarboxylic acid transporter (MCT) blocker (alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate; 300 mu mol l(-1)) or a competitive MCT substrate (pyruvate; 5 mmol l(-1)).

article,An integrated transcriptomic and comparative genomic analysis of differential gene expression in Arctic charr (<i>Salvelinus alpinus</i>) following seawater exposure,"Norman, Joseph D. and Ferguson, Moira M. and Danzmann, Roy G.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"High-throughput RNA sequencing was used to compare expression profiles in two Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) families post-seawater exposure to identify genes and biological processes involved in hypoosmoregulation and regulation of salinity tolerance. To further understand the genetic architecture of hypo-osmoregulation, the genomic organization of differentially expressed (DE) genes was also analysed. Using a de novo gill transcriptome assembly we found over 2300 contigs to be DE. Major transporters from the seawater mitochondrion-rich cell (MRC) complex were up-regulated in seawater. Expression ratios for 257 differentially expressed contigs were highly correlated between families, suggesting they are strictly regulated. Based on expression profiles and known molecular pathways we inferred that seawater exposure induced changes in methylation states and elevated peroxynitrite formation in gill. We hypothesized that concomitance between DE immune genes and the transition to a hypo-osmoregulatory state could be related to Cl- sequestration by antimicrobial defence mechanisms. Gene ontology analysis revealed that cell division genes were up-regulated, which could reflect the proliferation of ATP1 alpha 1b-type seawater MRCs. Comparative genomics analyses suggest that hypo-osmoregulation is influenced by the relative proximities among a contingent of genes on Arctic charr linkage groups AC-4 and AC-12 that exhibit homologous affinities with a region on stickleback chromosome Ga-I. This supports the hypothesis that relative gene location along a chromosome is a property of the genetic architecture of hypoosmoregulation. Evidence of non-random structure between hypoosmoregulation candidate genes was found on AC-1/11 and AC-28, suggesting that interchromosomal rearrangements played a role in the evolution of hypo-osmoregulation in Arctic charr.",2014,10.1242/jeb.107441,217,22,4029-4042,NA,RNA-Seq; Gene expression; Osmoregulation; Salinity tolerance; Salmonidae; Salvelinus alpinus

The `oxidative cost of reproduction' has received considerable attention with regards to food and antioxidant availability; however, the limitation of water availability has thus far been neglected. In this study, we experimentally examined the combined effect of pregnancy and water deprivation on oxidative status in a viviparous snake (Vipera aspis), a species naturally exposed to periods of water and food deprivation. We predicted a cumulative effect of pregnancy and dehydration on oxidative stress levels. Our results support the occurrence of an oxidative cost of reproduction as we found higher oxidative damage levels in pregnant females than in non-reproductive individuals, despite an upregulation of antioxidant defences. Surprisingly, water deprivation was associated with an up-regulation of antioxidant defences, and did not increase oxidative damage, either alone or in combination with reproduction.",2017,10.1242/jeb.156752,220,10,1792-1796,NA,Cost of reproduction; Oxidative shielding; Dehydration; Oxidative damage; Antioxidant; Water deprivation

The lake population is much more vulnerable than the sea population. We hypothesized that the difference reflects physiological adaptation mechanisms operating on long time scales rather than genetically fixed differences between the populations. To test this, we studied how acclimation to ultra-slowly increased illumination (on time scales of several weeks to months) affected the resilience of the eyes to bright-light exposures. Light responses of whole eyes were measured by electroretinography, the visual-pigment content of single rhabdoms by microspectrophotometry and the structural integrity of photoreceptor cells by electron microscopy (EM). Slow acclimation mitigated and even abolished the depression of photoresponsiveness caused by strong light exposures, making a dramatic difference especially in the lake animals. Still, acclimation in the sea animals was faster and the EM studies suggested intrinsic differences in the dynamics of microvillar membrane cycling. In conclusion, we report a novel form of physiological adaptation to general light levels, effective on the time scale of seasonal changes. It explains part but not all of the differences in light tolerance between the lake and sea populations.",2017,10.1242/jeb.155101,220,15,2798-2808,NA,Compound eye; Visual adaptation; Ecophysiology; Rhodopsin; Metarhodopsin; Rhabdom

However, GC secretion can vary with the availability of vital trophic resources such as energy. While water represents another critical resource, the impact of water deprivation on GC secretion during reproduction has not yet been thoroughly investigated. Here, we examined the effects of water deprivation on plasma corticosterone (CORT) concentrations of female aspic vipers (Vipera aspis), and determined the impacts of water deprivation on offspring traits. We exposed both pregnant and non-reproductive females to a 20-day water deprivation and compared their pre- and post-deprivation CORT levels with those of control females. At the end of the treatment, only water-deprived pregnant females showed a significant increase in CORT levels. In pregnant females, changes in baseline CORT level were correlated with changes in female hydration state. Changes in baseline CORT levels were also negatively influenced by maternal reproductive effort in pregnant control females, while such a relationship was not apparent in pregnant water-deprived females. Finally, we found that offspring from water-deprived females had higher growth rates than offspring from control females. Offspring growth was also positively correlated with changes in both maternal osmolality and baseline CORT levels. Together, our results suggest that dehydration increases maternal CORT levels, which may subsequently influence offspring development. Further long-term field studies are therefore required to assess whether there is an adaptive significance of this response.",2016,10.1242/jeb.132639,219,5,658-667,NA,Allostasis; Dehydration; Ectotherms; Glucocorticoids; Maternal effects; Reproductive effort

A reduction in haematocrit from 42 +/- 2\% to 20 +/- 3\% (mean +/- s.e.m.) caused a significant but minor reduction in upper critical temperature, from 35.8 +/- 0.1 to 35.1 +/- 0.2 degrees C, with no correlation between individual values for haematocrit and upper thermal limit. Anaemia did not influence the rise in oxygen uptake between 25 and 33 degrees C, because the anaemic fish were able to compensate for reduced blood oxygen carrying capacity with a significant increase in cardiac output. Therefore, in sea bass the upper critical temperature, at which they lost equilibrium, was not determined by an inability of the cardio-respiratory system to meet the thermal acceleration of metabolic demands.",2014,10.1242/jeb.104166,217,24,4275-4278,NA,Haematocrit; Cardiovascular; Oxygen transport; Fish; Thermal tolerance

However, little is known of the interplay between metabolism, bimodal oxygen uptake and activity levels across thermal environments in diving ectotherms. Here, we show in two species of sea snake (spine-bellied sea snake, Hydrophis curtus; and elegant sea snake, Hydrophis elegans) that increasing temperature elevates surfacing rate, increases total oxygen consumption and decreases dive duration. The majority of dives observed in both species remained within estimated maximal aerobic limits. While cutaneous gas exchange accounted for a substantial proportion of total oxygen consumption (up to 23\%), unexpectedly it was independent of water temperature and activity levels, suggesting a diffusion-limited mechanism. Our findings demonstrate that rising water temperature and a limited capability to up-regulate cutaneous oxygen uptake may compromise the proficiency with which sea snakes perform prolonged dives. This may hinder their capacity to withstand ongoing anthropogenic activities like trawl fishing, and increase their susceptibility to surface predation as their natural environments continue to warm.",2016,10.1242/jeb.146571,219,21,3447-3454,NA,Accelerometer; Aerobic limits; Bimodal gas exchange; Hydrophis (Lapemis) curtus; Hydrophis elegans; Incidental trawl bycatch

Survival under desiccating conditions is a determinant for habitats where ticks can become established, and water-balance characteristics of ticks have been extensively studied. However, little is known about the underlying aspects associated with dehydration stress in ticks. In this study, we examined the response of male American dog ticks, Dermacentor variabilis, to dehydration using a combined transcriptomics and metabolomics approach. During dehydration, 497 genes were differentially expressed, including an up-regulation of stress-response and protein-catabolism genes and concurrent down-regulation of several energetically expensive biological processes. Accumulation of several metabolites, including specific amino acids, glycerol and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), and transcript shifts in the associated pathways for generating these metabolites indicated congruence between changes in the metabolome and gene expression. Ticks treated with exogenous glycerol and GABA demonstrated altered water-balance characteristics; specifically, increased water absorption at high relative humidity. Finally, we observed changes in locomotor activity in response to dehydration, but this change was not influenced by the accumulation of GABA. Overall, the responses to dehydration by these ticks were similar to those observed in other dehydration-tolerant arthropods, but several molecular and behavioral responses are distinct from those associated with other taxa.",2016,10.1242/jeb.137315,219,12,1808-1819,NA,Dermacentor variabilis; Gene expression; GABA; Glycerol; Activity

One mechanism involves the modulation of the surface temperature of specific areas of the body through vasomotor adjustment. In homeotherms, this thermoregulatory adjustment is essential for the maintenance of body temperature over a moderate temperature range, known as the thermal neutral zone (TNZ). The bill of the toco toucan (Ramphastos toco) has been described as a highly efficient thermal window and hypothesized to assist in the thermal homeostasis of this bird. Herein, we directly evaluated the contribution of heat exchange through the bill of the toco toucan and role of the bill in the delimitation of the TNZ. To do this, we measured metabolic rate (MR), via oxygen consumption, over a range of ambient temperatures from 0 to 35 degrees C. MR measurements were made in birds with the bill intact and with the bill insulated. The limits of the TNZ did not differ between treatments, ranging from 10.8 to 25.0 degrees C. The MR differed among treatments only at elevated temperatures (30 and 35 degrees C), reaching 0.92 +/- 0.11 ml O2 g-1 h-1 (mean +/- s.d.) for the intact group and 1.13 +/- 0.13 ml O2 g-1 h-1 for the insulated group. These results indicate that although heat dissipation through the bill does not contribute significantly to widening of the TNZ, it may well be critically important in assisting body temperature regulation at higher temperatures extending above the upper limit of the TNZ.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245268,226,5,NA,jeb245268,KEY WORDS; Thermal window; Heat exchange; Metabolic rate; Thermal neutral zone; Thermal homeostasis

Post-hatch (PH; 7 days post-hatch) larvae utilize the yolk sac skin for physiological exchange, whereas by complete yolk sac absorption (CYA; 30 days post-hatch), the gill is the dominant site. At the gills, J(Na), in and Jamm occur via loose Na+/ NH4 (+) exchange, but this exchange has not been examined in the skin of larval trout. Based on previous work, we hypothesized that, contrary to the gill model, JNa, in by the yolk sac skin of PH trout occurs independently of J(amm). Following a 12 h exposure to high environmental ammonia (HEA; 0.5 mmol l(-1) NH4HCO3; 600 mu mol l(-1) Na+; pH 8), J(amm) by the gills of CYA trout and the yolk sac skin of PH larvae, which were isolated using divided chambers, increased significantly. However, this was coupled to an increase in J(Na), in across the gills only, supporting our hypothesis. Moreover, gene expression of proteins involved in J(Na), in [} Na+/ H+-exchanger-2 (NHE2) and H+-ATPase] increased in response to HEA only in the CYA gills.

Similar Na+/ K+-ATPase-positive cells expressing Rhcg1 and NHE3b, but not NHE2, were identified in the yolk sac epithelium.

The data were used to estimate the dynamic specific lung compliance (sC(L)), the O-2 consumption rate ((V)over dot(O2)) and CO2 production rates ((V)over dot(CO2)) during rest. Our results indicate that bottlenose dolphins have the capacity to generate respiratory flow rates that exceed 130 l s(-1) and 30 l s(-1) during expiration and inspiration, respectively. The esophageal pressures indicated that expiration is passive during voluntary breaths, but active during maximal efforts, whereas inspiration is active for all breaths.

article,"Roles of crustacean hyperglycaemic hormone in ionic and metabolic homeostasis in the Christmas Island blue crab, <i>Discoplax celeste</i>","Turner, Lucy M. and Webster, Simon G. and Morris, Stephen",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"There is a growing body of evidence implicating the involvement of crustacean hyperglycaemic hormone (CHH) in ionic homeostasis in decapod crustaceans. However, little is known regarding hormonally influenced osmoregulatory processes in terrestrial decapods. As many terrestrial decapods experience opposing seasonal demands upon ionoregulatory physiologies, we reasoned that these would make interesting models in which to study the effect of CHH upon these phenomena. In particular, those (tropical) species that also undergo seasonal migrations might be especially informative, as we know relatively little regarding the nature of CHHs in terrestrial decapods, and hormonally mediated responses to seasonal changes in metabolic demands might also be superimposed or otherwise integrated with those associated with ionic homeostasis. Using Discoplax celeste as a model crab that experiences seasonal extremes in water availability, and exhibits diurnal and migratory activity patterns, we identified two CHHs in the sinus gland. We biochemically characterised (cDNA cloning) one CHH and functionally characterised (in terms of dose-dependent hyperglycaemic responses and glucose-dependent negative feedback loops) both CHHs. Whole-animal in situ branchial chamber (NaCl)-Na-22 perfusion experiments showed that injection of both CHHs increased gill Na+ uptake in a seasonally dependent manner, and Cr-51-EDTA clearance experiments demonstrated that CHH increased urine production by the antennal gland. Seasonal and salinity-dependent differences in haemolymph CHH titre further implicated CHH in osmoregulatory processes. Intriguingly, CHH appeared to have no effect on gill Na+/K+-ATPase or V-ATPase activity, suggesting unknown mechanisms of this hormone's action on Na+ transport across gill epithelia.",2013,10.1242/jeb.078527,216,7,1191-1201,NA,sinus gland; CHH; osmoregulation; season; Gecarcoidea natalis

Field-collected caterpillars had a temperature of crystallization of -7.7 +/- 0.5 degrees C that decreased significantly to -9.5 +/- 0.6 degrees C after 12 weeks of acclimation at 5 degrees C. Hemolymph levels of free proline, total amino acids and proteins reached a peak during the first 4 weeks of acclimation; concomitantly, hemolymph osmolality increased markedly during this interval (from 364 to 1282 mosmol kg(-1)). In contrast, hemolymph pH decreased during the first 4 weeks of acclimation before this trend reversed and pH values gradually returned to initial values. However, pH reached its peak value following 1 week at -20 degrees C, but decreased after longer periods of freezing. During cold acclimation, cholesterol levels decreased in the hemolymph and the membrane fraction of fat body but not in other tissues. Lethal freezing at -80 degrees C reduced cell survival in foregut tissue and caused leakage of free proline, total amino acids and proteins from tissues into the hemolymph.

article,"Genome size influences adaptive plasticity of water loss, but not metabolic rates, in lungless salamanders","Johnson, Benjamin B. and Searle, Jeremy B. and Sparks, Jed P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Many expressions of phenotype, such as physiological performance, integrate multiple underlying traits to function. Linking component traits to adaptive physiology thus gives insight into mechanisms of selection acting on performance. Genome size (C-value) is a trait that influences physiology in multiple taxa by exerting a nucleotypic effect, constraining cell size and cellular physiology such that whole-organism mass-specific metabolism is reduced with increasing C-value. We tested for this mechanism of C-value function acting in lungless salamanders, plus an unexplored potential mechanism of C-value effects constraining water transport across the body surface to influence cutaneous water loss rates. We found no evidence for a nucleotypic effect on metabolic rates, but we demonstrate a relationship between C-value and water loss physiology. Under warmer experimental conditions, C-value was inversely correlated with water loss and positively correlated with resistance to water loss, which demonstrated adaptive plasticity at higher temperatures. We hypothesize that this pattern results from differences in cell size constraining diffusion and evaporation of water from the skin under warm conditions when cutaneous perfusion is reduced. Testing this hypothesis may confirm a previously unappreciated adaptive role for C-value variation in this group, and reveals the possibility that genome size influences physiological exchange across transport barriers more broadly.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242196,224,8,NA,jeb242196,C-value; Cell size; Metabolism; Respiration; Evaporation; Plethodontidae
article,Antioxidant defence and stress protein induction following heat stress in the Mediterranean snail <i>Xeropicta derbentina</i>,"Troschinski, Sandra and Dieterich, Andreas and Krais, Stefanie and Triebskorn, Rita and Koehler, Heinz-R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The Mediterranean snail Xeropicta derbentina (Pulmonata, Hygromiidae), being highly abundant in Southern France, has the need for efficient physiological adaptations to desiccation and overheating posed by dry and hot environmental conditions. As a consequence of heat, oxidative stress manifests in these organisms, which, in turn, leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, we focused on adaptations at the biochemical level by investigation of antioxidant defences and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) induction, both essential mechanisms of the heat stress response. We exposed snails to elevated temperature (25, 38, 40, 43 and 45 degrees C) in the laboratory and measured the activity of the antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), determined the Hsp70 level and quantified lipid peroxidation. In general, we found a high constitutive level of CAT activity in all treatments, which may be interpreted as a permanent protection against ROS, i. e. hydrogen peroxide. CAT and GPx showed temperature-dependent activity: CAT activity was significantly increased in response to high temperatures (43 and 45 degrees C), whereas GPx exhibited a significantly increased activity at 40 degrees C, probably in response to high levels of lipid peroxides that occurred in the 38 degrees C treatment. Hsp70 showed a maximum induction at 40 degrees C, followed by a decrease at higher temperatures. Our results reveal that X. derbentina possesses a set of efficient mechanisms to cope with the damaging effects of heat. Furthermore, we demonstrated that, besides the well-documented Hsp70 stress response, antioxidant defence plays a crucial role in the snails' competence to survive extreme temperatures.",2014,10.1242/jeb.113167,217,24,4399-4405,NA,Catalase; Glutathione peroxidase; Hsp70; Stress response; Oxidative stress

To investigate whether this is an adaptive trait that evolved in response to dehydration in populations inhabiting water-scarce environments, we sampled free-ranging cottonmouth snakes (n=26 adult cottonmouths) from two populations inhabiting contrasting environments in terms of water availability: Snake Key (n=12), an island with no permanent sources of fresh water, and Paynes Prairie (n=14), a flooded freshwater prairie. In addition to field surveys, we manipulated the hydration state of 17 cottonmouths (Paynes Prairie n=9, Snake Key n=8) in a laboratory setting and measured the response of corticosterone and innate immune performance to dehydration with the aim of identifying any correlation or trade-offs between them. We measured corticosterone of cottonmouths at a baseline level and then again following a 60 min stress test when at three hydration states: hydrated, dehydrated and rehydrated. We found that innate immune performance improved with dehydration and then returned to baseline levels within 48 h of rehydration, which agrees with previous research in reptiles. Despite the frequent exposure of cottonmouths on Snake Key to dehydrating conditions, we did not find cottonmouths inhabiting the island to show a greater magnitude or more prolonged immune response compared with cottonmouths from Paynes Prairie. We also found a positive association between dehydration and corticosterone values.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243894,225,17,NA,jeb243894,Cottonmouth; Physiological trade-offs; Corticosterone; Natural antibodies; Island snakes; Drinking
article,Transgenic expression of late embryogenesis abundant proteins improves tolerance to water stress in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>,"Anderson, John M. and Hand, Steven C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Four lines of Drosophila melanogaster were created that expressed transgenes encoding selected late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins originally identified in embryos of the anhydrobiote Artemia franciscana. The overall aim was to extend our understanding of the protective properties of LEA proteins documented with isolated cells to a desiccation-sensitive organism during exposure to drying and hyperosmotic stress. Embryos of D. melanogaster were dried at 57\% relative humidity to promote a loss of 80\% tissue water and then rehydrated. Embryos that expressed AfrLEA2 or AfrLEA3m eclosed 2 days earlier than wild-type embryos or embryos expressing green fluorescent protein (Gal4GFP control). For the third instar larval stage, all)(Vitae lines and Gal4GFP controls experienced substantial drops in survivorship as desiccation proceeded. When results for all Afrlea lines were combined, Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated a significant improvement in survivorship in fly lines expressing AfrLEA proteins compared with Gal4GFP controls. The percent water lost at the LT50 (lethal time for 50\% mortality) for the AfrLEA lines was 78\% versus 52\% for Gal4GFP controls. Finally, offspring of fly lines that expressed AfrLEA2, AfrLEA3m or AfrLEA6 exhibited significantly greater success in reaching pupation, compared with wild-type flies, when adults were challenged with hyperosmotic stress (NaCl-fortified medium) and progeny forced to develop under these conditions. In conclusion, the gain of function studies reported here show that LEA proteins can improve tolerance to water stress in a desiccation-sensitive species that normally lacks these proteins, and, simultaneously, underscore the complexity of desiccation tolerance across multiple life stages in multicellular organisms.",2021,10.1242/jeb.238204,224,4,NA,jeb238204,Desiccation; LEA proteins; Salt stress; Artemia franciscana
article,The functional significance of panting as a mechanism of thermoregulation and its relationship to the critical thermal maxima in lizards,"Loughran, Caleb L. and Wolf, Blair O.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Because most desert-dwelling lizards rely primarily on behavioral thermoregulation for the maintenance of active body temperature, the effectiveness of panting as a thermoregulatory mechanism for evaporative cooling has not been widely explored. We measured changes in body temperature (T-b) with increasing air temperature (T-a) for 17 species of lizards that range across New Mexico and Arizona and quantified the temperatures associated with the onset of panting, and the capacity of individuals to depress T-b below T-a while panting, and estimated the critical thermal maxima (CTmax) for each individual. We examined these variables as a function of phylogeny, body mass and local acclimatization temperature. We found that many species can depress T-b 2-3 degrees C below T-a while panting, and the capacity to do so appears to be a function of each species' ecology and thermal environment, rather than phylogeny. Panting thresholds and CTmax values are phylogenetically conserved within groups. Understanding the functional significance of panting and its potential importance as a thermoregulatory mechanism will improve our understanding of the potential for species' persistence in an increasingly warmer world.",2020,10.1242/jeb.224139,223,17,NA,jeb224139,Ectothermy; Panting; Evaporative cooling; Lizards; Thermoregulation
article,Temperature and the microbial environment alter brain morphology in a larval amphibian,"Emerson, Kyle J. and Fontaine, Samantha S. and Kohl, Kevin D. and Woodley, Sarah K.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Understanding how the global climate impacts the physiology of wildlife animals is of importance. Amphibians are particularly sensitive to climate change, and it is hypothesized that rising temperatures impair their neurodevelopment. Temperature influences the composition of the gut microbiota, which is critical to host neurodevelopment through the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis. Most research investigating the link between the gut microbiota and neurodevelopment occurs in germ-free mammalian model systems, leaving the nature of the MGB axis in nonmammalian wildlife unclear. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the temperature and the microbial environment in which tadpoles were raised shapes neurodevelopment, possibly through the MGB axis. Newly hatched green frog tadpoles (Lithobates clamitans) were raised in natural pond water or autoclaved pond water, serving as an experimental manipulation of the microbiota by reducing colonizing microbes, at three different water temperatures: 14, 22 and 28 \& DEG;C. Neurodevelopment was analyzed through measures of relative brain mass and morphology of brain structures of interest. We found that tadpole development in warmer temperatures increased relative brain mass and optic tectum width and length. Further, tadpole development in autoclaved pond water increased relative optic tectum width and length. Additionally, the interaction of treatments altered relative diencephalon length. Lastly, we found that variation in brain morphology was associated with gut microbial diversity and the relative abundance of individual bacterial taxa. Our results indicate that both environmental temperature and microbial communities influence relative brain mass and shape. Furthermore, we provide some of the first evidence for the MGB axis in amphibians.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245333,226,12,NA,jeb245333,Frog; Gut; Microbiota; Microbiome; Microbiota-gut-
article,Not that hot after all: no limits to heat dissipation in lactating mice selected for high or low BMR,"Sadowska, Julita and Gebczynski, Andrzej K. and Lewoc, Matgorzata and Konarzewski, Marek",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Heat dissipation has been suggested as a limit to sustained metabolic effort, e.g. during lactation, when overheating is a possible risk. We tested this hypothesis using mice artificially selected for either high or low BMR that also differed with respect to parental effort. We used fixed size cross-fostered families and recorded litter mass daily until the 14th day of lactation. Midway through the experiment (day 8) half of the mothers from each group had fur from the dorsal body surface removed to increase their thermal conductance and facilitate heat dissipation. Our results showed that neither high nor low BMR mouse lines benefited from increasing their thermal conductance at peak lactation. On the contrary, growth of the litters reared by the low BMR females was compromised. Thus, our results do not support the heat dissipation limitation hypothesis.",2019,10.1242/jeb.204669,222,17,NA,jeb204669,Heat dissipation; BMR; Experimental selection; Growth rate
article,Air-entrapping capacity in the hair coverage of <i>Malacosoma castrensis</i> (Lasiocampidae: Lepidoptera) caterpillar: a case study,"Kovalev, Alexander and Rebora, Manuela and Salerno, Gianandrea and Gorb, Stanislav",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The moth Malacosoma castrensis (Lasiocampidae) is commonly found along the Northern Germany coasts, the habitats of which are mainly represented by salt marshes subjected to sea level variations. Surprisingly, terrestrial caterpillars can withstand many hours of being flooded by seawater. The ability to withstand periods of submersion in a terrestrial insect raises the problem of respiration related to avoiding water percolation into the tracheal system. In the present study, we investigated under laboratory conditions the role of water-repellent cuticle structures in oxygen supply in caterpillars of M. castrensis submerged in water. For this purpose, air-layer stability tests using force measurements, and micromorphology of cuticle structures using SEM and fluorescence microscopy, were performed. A plastron appeared when a caterpillar is underwater. The stability, gas composition and internal pressure of the plastron were estimated. The plastron is stabilized by long and scarce hairs, which are much thicker than the corresponding hairs of aquatic insects. Thick and stiff hairs with scierotized basal and middle regions protrude into the water through the plastron-water interface, while substantial regions of thin and flexible hairs are aligned along the plastron-water interface and their side walls can support pressure in the plastron even below atmospheric pressure. Additional anchoring points between hair's stalk and microtrichia near the hair base provide enhanced stiffness to the hair layer and prevent the hair layer from collapse and water entering between hairs. The advancing contact angle on hairs is more than 90 deg, which is close to the effective contact angle for the whole caterpillar.",2020,10.1242/jeb.225029,223,14,NA,jeb225029,Cuticle; Hydrophobicity; Plastron; Air-retaining

However, little is known about the function of SJ proteins in aquatic invertebrates. In this study, a role for the transmembrane SJ protein gliotactin (Gli) in the osmoregulatory strategies of larval mosquito (Aedes aegypti) was examined. Differences in gli transcript abundance were observed between the midgut, Malpighian tubules, hindgut and anal papillae of A. aegypti, which are epithelia that participate in larval mosquito osmoregulation. Western blotting of Gli revealed its presence in monomer, putative dimer and alternatively processed protein forms in different larval mosquito organs. Gli localized to the entire SJ domain between midgut epithelial cells and showed a discontinuous localization along the plasma membranes of epithelial cells of the rectum as well as the syncytial anal papillae epithelium. In the Malpighian tubules, Gli immunolocalization was confined to SJs between the stellate and principal cells. Rearing larvae in 30\% seawater caused an increase in Gli protein abundance in the anterior midgut, Malpighian tubules and hindgut. Transcriptional knockdown of gli using dsRNA reduced Gli protein abundance in the midgut and increased the flux rate of the paracellular permeability marker, polyethylene glycol (molecular weight 400 Da; PEG-400). Data suggest that in larval A. aegypti, Gli participates in the maintenance of salt and water balance and that one role for Gli is to participate in the regulation of paracellular permeability across the midgut of A. aegypti in response to changes in environmental salinity.",2017,10.1242/jeb.156125,220,13,2354-2363,NA,Larval mosquito; Osmoregulation; Midgut permeability; Septate junctions; Gliotactin
article,Fluctuating environments during early development can limit adult phenotypic flexibility: insights from an amphibious fish,"Rossi, Giulia S. and Cochrane, V, Paige and Wright, Patricia A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The interaction between developmental plasticity and the capacity for reversible acclimation (phenotypic flexibility) is poorly understood, particularly in organisms exposed to fluctuating environments. We used an amphibious killifish (Kryptolebias marmoratus) to test the hypotheses that organisms reared in fluctuating environments (i) will make no developmental changes to suit any one environment because fixing traits to suit one environment could be maladaptive for another, and (ii) will be highly phenotypically flexible as adults because their early life experiences predict high environmental variability in the future. We reared fish under constant (water) or fluctuating (water-air) environments until adulthood and assessed a suite of traits along the oxygen cascade (e.g. neuroepithelial cell density and size, cutaneous capillarity, gill morphology, ventricle size, red muscle morphometrics, terrestrial locomotor performance). To evaluate the capacity for phenotypic flexibility, a subset of adult fish from each rearing condition was then air-exposed for 14 days before the same traits were measured. In support of the developmental plasticity hypothesis, traits involved with O-2 sensing and uptake were largely unaffected by water-air fluctuations during early life, but we found marked developmental changes in traits related to O-2 transport, utilization and locomotor performance. In contrast, we found no evidence supporting the phenotypic flexibility hypothesis. Adult fish from both rearing conditions exhibited the same degree of phenotypic flexibility in various O-2 sensing- and uptake-related traits. In other cases, water-air fluctuations attenuated adult phenotypic flexibility despite the fact that phenotypic flexibility is hypothesized to be favoured when environments fluctuate. Overall, we condude that exposure to environmental fluctuations during development in K. marmoratus can dramatically alter the constitutive adult phenotype, as well as diminish the scope for phenotypic flexibility in later life.",2020,10.1242/jeb.228304,223,16,NA,jeb228304,Acclimation; Gill lamellae; Heart size; Locomotor performance; Neuroepithelial cells; Oxygen cascade; Phenotypic plasticity; Skeletal muscle

This approach has been successfully applied mainly to studies on birds, particularly on reproducing adults, whereas manipulations in mammals have proved more problematic. Here, we tested the hypothesis that shaving off 50\% of the dorsal pelage should effectively increase energy expenditure in wild root voles (Microtus oeconomus) in their natural environment. We measured daily energy expenditure (DEE), using doubly labelled water in shaved and unshaved voles at the beginning of winter. The difference in DEE (corrected for body mass and year effects) between experimental and control group fluctuated from 11.5\% to 17.3\%. Probability of recapture over the 3 day DEE assay was strongly dependent on body mass, but did not differ between shaved and unshaved animals; however, a prevalence of larger (heavier) shaved individuals was observed. Shaved animals lost more weight between the first and second trapping. Shaving therefore appears to be an effective method of increasing the cost of total DEE in wild endotherms in their natural environment.",2014,10.1242/jeb.103754,217,22,3964-3967,NA,Body mass; Doubly labelled water; Fur insulation; Mammal; Metabolic rate; Thermoregulation

B. and Pond, David W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The changing climate is shifting the distributions of marine species, yet the potential for shifts in depth distributions is virtually unexplored. Hydrostatic pressure is proposed to contribute to a physiological bottleneck constraining depth range extension in shallow-water taxa. However, bathymetric limitation by hydrostatic pressure remains undemonstrated, and the mechanism limiting hyperbaric tolerance remains hypothetical. Here, we assess the effects of hydrostatic pressure in the lithodid crab Lithodes maja (bathymetric range 4-790 m depth, approximately equivalent to 0.1 to 7.9 MPa hydrostatic pressure). Heart rate decreased with increasing hydrostatic pressure, and was significantly lower at >= 10.0 MPa than at 0.1 MPa. Oxygen consumption increased with increasing hydrostatic pressure to 12.5 MPa, before decreasing as hydrostatic pressure increased to 20.0 MPa; oxygen consumption was significantly higher at 7.5-17.5 MPa than at 0.1 MPa. Increases in expression of genes associated with neurotransmission, metabolism and stress were observed between 7.5 and 12.5 MPa. We suggest that hyperbaric tolerance in L. maja may be oxygen-limited by hyperbaric effects on heart rate and metabolic rate, but that L. maja's bathymetric range is limited by metabolic costs imposed by the effects of high hydrostatic pressure. These results advocate including hydrostatic pressure in a complex model of environmental tolerance, where energy limitation constrains biogeographic range, and facilitate the incorporation of hydrostatic pressure into the broader metabolic framework for ecology and evolution. Such an approach is crucial for accurately projecting biogeographic responses to changing climate, and for understanding the ecology and evolution of life at depth.",2017,10.1242/jeb.158543,220,21,3916-3926,NA,Biogeographic range limitation; Heart rate; Metabolic theory; Respiration rate; Hydrostatic pressure; Hyperbaric physiology

The ability of leatherbacks to maintain core body temperature (T-b) higher than that of the surrounding water is thought to be a key element of their biology that permits them to exploit productive waters at high latitudes. We provide the first recordings of T-b from freely swimming leatherbacks at a northern foraging ground, and use these data to assess the importance of behavioral adjustments and metabolic sources of heat for maintenance of the thermal gradient (T-g). The mean T-b for individual leatherbacks ranged from 25.4 +/- 1.7 to 27.3 +/- 0.3 degrees C, and T-g ranged from 10.7 +/- 2.4 to 12.1 +/- 1.7 degrees C. Variation in mean T-b was best explained by the amount of time that turtles spent in the relatively warm surface waters. A diel trend in T-b was apparent, with daytime cooling suggestive of prey ingestion and night- time warming attributable to endogenous heat production. We estimate that metabolic rates necessary to support the observed T-g are -3 times higher than resting metabolic rate, and that specific dynamic action is an important source of heat for foraging leatherbacks.",2014,10.1242/jeb.100347,217,13,2331-2337,NA,Endothermy; Dermochelys coriacea; Jellyfish; Diving; Reptile; Specific dynamic action
article,Hormetic benefits of prior anoxia exposure in buffering anoxia stress in a soil-pupating insect,"Visser, Bertanne and Williams, Caroline M. and Hahn, Daniel A. and Short, Clancy A. and Lopez-Martinez, Giancarlo",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Oxygen is essential for most animals, and exposure to a complete lack of oxygen, i.e. anoxia, can result in irreparable damage to cells that can extend up to the organismal level to negatively affect performance. Although it is known that brief anoxia exposure may confer cross-tolerance to other stressors, few data exist on the biochemical and organismal consequences of repeated intermittent bouts of anoxia exposure. In nature, the Caribbean fruit fly, Anastrepha suspensa (Diptera: Tephritidae), is frequently exposed to heavy tropical rainfall while pupating in the soil, equating to multiple exposures to hypoxia or anoxia during development. Here, we tested whether prior anoxia exposures during pupal development can induce a beneficial acclimation response, and we explored the consequences of prior exposure for both whole-organism performance and correlated biochemical metrics. Pharate adults (the last developmental stage in the pupal case) were most sensitive to anoxia exposure, showing decreased survival and fertility compared with controls. These negative impacts were ameliorated by exposure to anoxia in earlier pupal developmental stages, indicating a hormetic effect of prior anoxia exposure. Anoxia exposure early in pupal development reduced the oxygen debt repaid after anoxia exposure relative to pharate adults experiencing anoxia for the first time. Lipid levels were highest in all pupal stages when exposed to prior anoxia. Prior anoxia thus benefits organismal performance and relocates resources towards lipid storage throughout pupal-adult development.",2018,10.1242/jeb.167825,221,6,NA,jeb167825,Antioxidants; Fruit fly; Hormesis; Hypoxia; Metabolism; Oxidative stress

This relatively rare insect order is one of the few for which it has been unclear what spectral classes of photoreceptors any of its members may possess, an even more apt question given the nocturnal evolution of the group. To address this question, we performed electroretinograms on adult male Xenos peckii: we measured spectral responses to equi-quantal monochromatic light flashes of different wavelengths, and established VlogI relationships to calculate spectral sensitivities. Based on opsin template fits, we found maximal spectral sensitivity (lambda(max)) in the green domain at 539 nm. Application of a green light to `bleach' green receptors revealed that a UV peak was contributed to by an independent UV opsin with a lambda(max) of 346 nm. Transcriptomics and a phylogenetic analysis including 50 other opsin sequences further confirmed the presence of these two opsin classes. While these findings do not necessarily indicate that these unorthodox insects have color vision, they raise the possibility that UV vision plays an important role in the ability of X. peckii males to find the very cryptic strepsipteran females that are situated within their wasp hosts.",2016,10.1242/jeb.148361,219,24,3866-3874,NA,Invertebrate vision; Color vision; Spectral sensitivity

We found that wild-type eyes possess a great amount of brown and red screening pigment inside the primary and secondary pigment cells as well as in the retinular cells. Red-eyed mutants, however, have only scarce red granules inside the pigmentary cells. We then compared the visual sensitivity of red-eyed mutants and wild types by measuring the photonegative responses of insects reared in light: dark cycles {[}12. h: 12. h light: dark (LD)] or constant darkness (DD). Finally, we analyzed both the impact of oxidative stress associated with blood ingestion and photodamage of UV light on the eye retina. We found that red-eyed mutants reared in DD conditions were the most sensitive to the light intensities tested. Retinae of LD-reared mutants were gradually damaged over the life cycle, while for DD-reared insects retinae were conserved intact. No retinal damage was observed in non-fed mutants exposed to UV light for 2. weeks, whereas insects fed on blood prior to UV exposure showed clear signs of retinal damage.

While many aspects of their physiology have been characterized to account for these remarkable feats, the contribution of adaptations in the aerobic powerhouses of muscle cells, the mitochondria, are unknown. In the present study, the ontogeny and comparative physiology of elephant seal muscle mitochondrial respiratory function was investigated under a variety of substrate conditions and respiratory states. Intact mitochondrial networks were studied by high-resolution respirometry in saponin-permeabilized fiber bundles obtained from primary swimming muscles of pup, juvenile and adult seals, and compared with fibers from adult human vastus lateralis. Results indicate that seal muscle maintains a high capacity for fatty acid oxidation despite a progressive decrease in total respiratory capacity as animals mature from pups to adults. This is explained by a progressive increase in phosphorylation control and fatty acid utilization over pyruvate in adult seals compared with humans and seal pups. Interestingly, despite higher indices of oxidative phosphorylation efficiency, juvenile and adult seals also exhibit a similar to 50\% greater capacity for respiratory `leak' compared with humans and seal pups. The ontogeny of this phenotype suggests it is an adaptation of muscle to the prolonged breath-hold exercise and highly variable ambient temperatures experienced by mature elephant seals.

article,Increased fat catabolism sustains water balance during fasting in zebra finches,"Rutkowska, Joanna and Sadowska, Edyta T. and Cichon, Mariusz and Bauchinger, Ulf",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Patterns of physiological flexibility in response to fasting are well established, but much less is known about the contribution of water deprivation to the observed effects. We investigated body composition and energy and water budget in three groups of zebra finches: birds with access to food and water, food-deprived birds having access to drinking water and food-and-water-deprived birds. Animals were not stimulated by elevated energy expenditure and they were in thermoneutral conditions; thus, based on previous studies, water balance of fasting birds was expected to be maintained by increased catabolism of proteins. In contrast to this expectation, we found that access to water did not prevent reduction of proteinaceous tissue, but it saved fat reserves of the fasting birds. Thus, water balance of birds fasting without access to water seemed to be maintained by elevated fat catabolism, which generated 6 times more metabolic water compared with that in birds that had access to water. Therefore, we revise currently established views and propose fat to serve as the primary source for metabolic water production. Previously assumed increased protein breakdown for maintenance of water budget would occur if fat stores were depleted or if fat catabolism reached its upper limits due to high energy demands.",2016,10.1242/jeb.138966,219,17,2623-2628,NA,Protein sparing; Metabolic water; Body composition; Energy budget; Taeniopygia guttata
article,No experimental evidence of stress-induced hyperthermia in zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>),"Jones, Nick A. R. and Mendo, Tania and Broell, Franziska and Webster, Mike M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Stress-induced hyperthermia (SIH) is characterised by a rise in body temperature in response to a stressor. In endotherms, SIH is mediated by the autonomic nervous system, whereas ectotherms must raise their body temperature via behavioural means by moving to warmer areas within their environment (behavioural thermoregulation). A recent study suggested that zebrafish (Danio rerio), an important model species, may move to warmer water in response to handling and confinement and thus exhibit SIH, which, if accepted, may have important practical and welfare implications. However, an alternative hypothesis proposed that the observed movements may be produced by avoidance behaviour rather than behavioural thermoregulation. Investigating the claims for SIH in zebrafish further, we conducted two experiments that extend the earlier study. The first experiment incorporated new conditions that considered fish behaviour in the absence of thermal variation, i.e. their null distribution, an important condition that was not performed in the original study. The second was a refined version of the experiment to reduce the numbers of fish and aid movement between areas for the fish. In contrast to the previous study, we saw no effect of handling or confinement on preference for warmer areas, and no evidence for SIH in either experiment. Instead, we observed a short-lived reduction in preference for warmer areas immediately post-stress. Our work suggests that zebrafish may not experience SIH, and claims regarding fish consciousness based on SIH may need to be revised.",2019,10.1242/jeb.192971,222,2,NA,jeb192971,Thermal preference; Fish welfare; Emotional fever; Fish stress; Behavioural thermoregulation; Ectotherm thermoregulation

Biophysical mechanisms behind cuticular hydrocarbon acclimation across species,"Baumgart, Lucas and Wittke, Marti and Morsbach, Svenja and Abou, Berengere and Menzel, Florian",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Maintaining water balance is vital for terrestrial organisms. Insects protect themselves against desiccation via cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs). CHC layers are complex mixtures of solid and liquid hydrocarbons, with a surprisingly diverse composition across species. This variation may translate into differential phase behaviour, and hence varying waterproofing capacity. This is especially relevant when temperatures change, which requires acclimatory CHC changes to maintain waterproofing. Nevertheless, the physical consequences of CHC variation are still little understood. We studied acclimatory responses and their consequences for CHC composition, phase behaviour and drought survival in three congeneric ant species. Colony sub-groups were kept under cool, warm and fluctuating temperature regimes. Lasius niger and Lasius platythorax, both of which are rich in methyl-branched alkanes, showed largely predictable acclimatory changes of the CHC profile. In both species, warm acclimation increased drought resistance. Warm acclimation increased the proportion of solid compounds in L. niger but not in L. platythorax. In both species, the CHC layer formed a liquid matrix of constantly low viscosity, which contained highly viscous and solid parts. This phase heterogeneity may be adaptive, increasing robustness to temperature fluctuations. In Lasius brunneus, which is rich in unsaturated hydrocarbons, acclimatory CHC changes were less predictable, and warm acclimation did not enhance drought survival. The CHC layer was more homogeneous, but matrix viscosity changed with acclimation. We showed that ant species use different physical mechanisms to enhance waterproofing during acclimation. Hence, the ability to acclimate, and thus climatic niche breadth, may strongly depend on species-specific CHC profile.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243847,225,16,NA,jeb243847,Climate adaptation; Cuticular hydrocarbons; Ecological niche breadth; Phase behaviour; Microrheology; Drought tolerance

J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Female-biased mortality has been repeatedly reported in Pacific salmon during their upriver migration in both field studies and laboratory holding experiments, especially in the presence of multiple environmental stressors, including thermal stress. Here, we used coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) to test whether females exposed to elevated water temperatures (18 degrees C) (i) suppress circulating sex hormones (testosterone, 11-ketotestosterone and estradiol), owing to elevated cortisol levels, (ii) have higher activities of enzymes supporting anaerobic metabolism (e.g. lactate dehydrogenase, LDH), (iii) have lower activities of enzymes driving oxidative metabolism (e.g. citrate synthase, CS) in skeletal and cardiac muscle, and (iv) have more oxidative stress damage and reduced capacity for antioxidant defense [}lower catalase (CAT) activity]. We found no evidence that a higher susceptibility to oxidative stress contributes to female-biased mortality at warm temperatures. We did, however, find that females had significantly lower cardiac LDH and that 18 degrees C significantly reduced plasma levels of testosterone and estradiol, especially in females. We also found that relative gonad size was significantly lower in the 18 degrees C treatment regardless of sex, whereas relative liver size was significantly lower in females held at 18 degrees C. Further, relative spleen size was significantly elevated in the 18 degrees C treatments across both sexes, with larger warm-induced increases in females. Our results suggest that males may better tolerate bouts of cardiac hypoxia at high temperature, and that thermal stress may also disrupt testosterone- and estradiol-mediated protein catabolism, and the immune response (larger spleens), in migratory female salmon.",2020,10.1242/jeb.214841,223,14,NA,jeb214841,Fish; Salmon; Temperature; Thermal stress; Metabolism; Oxidative stress; Hormones
article,Temperature-dependent plasticity mediates heart morphology and thermal performance of cardiac function in juvenile Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo</i> <i>salar</i>),"Muir, Carlie A. and Garner, Shawn R. and Damjanovski, Sashko and Neff, Bryan D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In many fishes, upper thermal tolerance is thought to be limited in part by the heart's ability to meet increased oxygen demands during periods of high temperature. Temperature-dependent plasticity within the cardiovascular system may help fish cope with the thermal stress imposed by increasing water temperatures. In this study, we examined plasticity in heart morphology and function in juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) reared under control (+0 degrees C) or elevated (+4 degrees C) temperatures. Using non-invasive Doppler echocardiography, we measured the effect of acute warming on maximum heart rate, stroke distance and derived cardiac output. A 4 degrees C increase in average developmental temperature resulted in a >5 degrees C increase in the Arrhenius breakpoint temperature for maximum heart rate and enabled the hearts of these fish to continue beating rhythmically to temperatures approximately 2 degrees C higher than for control fish. However, these differences in thermal performance were not associated with plasticity in maximum cardiovascular capacity, as peak measures of heart rate, stroke distance and derived cardiac output did not differ between temperature treatments. Histological analysis of the heart revealed that while ventricular roundness and relative ventricle size did not differ between treatments, the proportion of compact myocardium in the ventricular wall was significantly greater in fish raised at elevated temperatures. Our findings contribute to the growing understanding of how the thermal environment can affect phenotypes later in life and identify a morphological strategy that may help fishes cope with acute thermal stress.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244305,225,16,NA,jeb244305,Thermal tolerance; Cardiac performance; Salmonid; Plasticity
article,Spectral sensitivity of cone photoreceptors and opsin expression in two colour-divergent lineages of the lizard <i>Ctenophorus decresii</i>,"Yewers, Madeleine S. and McLean, Claire A. and Moussalli, Adnan and Stuart-Fox, Devi and Bennett, Andrew T. D. and Knott, Ben",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Intraspecific differences in sensory perception are rarely reported but may occur when a species range extends across varying sensory environments, or there is coevolution between the sensory system and a varying signal. Examples in colour vision and colour signals are rare in terrestrial systems. The tawny dragon lizard Ctenophorus decresii is a promising candidate for such intraspecific variation, because the species comprises two geographically and genetically distinct lineages in which throat colour (a social signal used in intra-and inter-specific interactions) is locally adapted to the habitat and differs between lineages. Male lizards from the southern lineage have UV-blue throats, whereas males from the northern lineage are polymorphic with four discrete throat colours that all show minimal UV reflectance. Here, we determine the cone photoreceptor spectral sensitivities and opsin expression of the two lineages, to test whether they differ, particularly in the UV wavelengths. Using microspectrophotometry on retinal cone photoreceptors, we identified a long-wavelength-sensitive (LWS) visual pigment, a `short' and `long' medium-wavelength-sensitive (MWS) pigment and a short-wavelength-sensitive (SWS) pigment, all of which did not differ in lambda(max) between lineages. Through transcriptome analysis of opsin genes we found that both lineages express four cone opsin genes, including the SWS1 opsin with peak sensitivity in the UV range, and that amino acid sequences did not differ between lineages with the exception of a single leucine to valine substitution in the RH2 opsin. Counts of yellow and transparent oil droplets associated with LWS+MWS and SWS+UVS cones, respectively, showed no difference in relative cone proportions between lineages. Therefore, contrary to predictions, we find no evidence of differences between lineages in single cone photoreceptor spectral sensitivity or opsin expression. However, we confirm the presence of four single cone classes, suggesting tetrachromacy in C. decresii, and we also provide the first evidence of UV sensitivity in agamid lizards.",2015,10.1242/jeb.119404,218,10,1556-1563,NA,Ctenophorus decresii; Agamidae; Microspectrophotometry; Visual pigment; Opsin

C. and Collings, Melanie G.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"We report the first measures of thermotolerance (recorded as percentage mortality and induced HSP70 production) for pelagic larvae of three populations of the New Zealand greenshell (green-lipped) mussel Perna canaliculus. Our goal was to determine whether distinct populations of P. canaliculus were more susceptible to predicted climate change than others, and whether such patterns of susceptibility were either genetically controlled (local adaptation of populations) or simply reflect the acclimatory capacity of this species. F2 larvae from three P. canaliculus populations (D'Urville Island, Banks Peninsula and Stewart Island) were subjected to an acute thermal challenge (3h exposure to a fixed temperature in the range 20-42 degrees C). No latitudinal patterns in either percentage mortality or HSP70 protein production were apparent. For all populations, larval mortality (LT50) was between 32.9 and 33.9 degrees C, with significant amounts of HSP70 induction only occurring in those individuals that experienced temperatures of 40 degrees C or greater. The data presented therefore do not support the hypothesis that genetic adaptation of P. canaliculus to distinct thermal environments will be reflected by a corresponding difference in acute heat tolerance. In fact, the apparently vulnerable veligers show a surprisingly wide thermal safety margin. To develop a comprehensive understanding of the effects of ocean warming upon this species, subsequent studies should consider the impacts of sub-lethal stress upon fitness in addition to chronic thermal challenge and, crucially, the response of sedentary juvenile and adult stages.",2013,10.1242/jeb.076729,216,7,1202-1209,NA,percentage mortality; acute heat shock; climate change; local adaptation
article,Ontogeny and morphometrics of the gills and swim bladder of air-breathing striped catfish <i>Pangasianodon hypophthalmus</i>,"Le My Phuong and Do Thi Thanh Huong and Malte, Hans and Nyengaard, Jens Randel and Bayley, Mark",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The air-breathing fish Pangasianodon hypophthalmus has been shown to have highly plastic branchial surfaces whose area (SA) increases with temperature and aquatic hypoxia. This modulation occurs through development of inter-lamellar cell mass (ILCM). Paradoxically, in conditions where this fish has been shown capable of covering its entire aerobic scope from the water phase, it has been shown to have a very small branchial SA. To address this paradox, we measured the SA, harmonic mean diffusion distance (tau(h)) and calculated the anatomic diffusion factor (ADF) of the branchial and swim bladder surfaces in fish ranging from 3 to 1900 g at 27 degrees C in normoxia. Since the lamellae were distinguishable from the ILCM, we measured the actual SA as well as the potential SA if ILCM were lost. As a result of low tau(h), P. hypophthalmus has a high capacity for branchial oxygen uptake with or without ILCM. Actual and potential gill ADF were 361 and 1002 cm(2) mu m(-1) kg(-1), respectively, for a 100 g fish and the ADF of the swim bladder was found to be 308 cm(2) mu m(-1) kg(-1). By swimming fish to exhaustion at different temperatures, we show that modulation of this SA is rapid, indicating that the apparent paradox between previous studies is eliminated. Regression analysis of log-log plots of respiratory SA in relation to body mass shows that the gill scales with mass similarly to the SA in active water-breathing fish, whereas the swim bladder scales with mass more like the mammalian lung does. This fish presents a combination of respiratory surfaces not previously seen in air-breathing fish.",2018,10.1242/jeb.168658,221,3,NA,jeb168658,Anatomic diffusion factor; Gill plasticity; Pangasius; Scaling; Stereology
article,"Repeated freezing induces a trade-off between cryoprotection and egg production in the goldenrod gall fly, <i>Eurosta solidaginis</i>","Marshall, Katie E. and Sinclair, Brent J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Internal ice formation leads to wholesale changes in ionic, osmotic and pH homeostasis, energy metabolism, and mechanical damage, across a small range of temperatures, and is thus an abiotic stressor that acts at a distinct, physiologically relevant, threshold. Insects that experience repeated freeze-thaw cycles over winter will cross this stressor threshold many times over their lifespan. Here, we examined the effect of repeatedly crossing the freezing threshold on short-term physiological parameters (metabolic reserves and cryoprotectant concentration) as well as long-term fitness-related performance (survival and egg production) in the freeze-tolerant goldenrod gall fly, Eurosta solidaginis. We exposed overwintering prepupae to a series of low temperatures (-10, -15 or -20 degrees C) with increasing numbers of freezing events (3, 6 or 10) with differing recovery periods between events (1, 5 or 10 days). Repeated freezing increased sorbitol concentration by about 50\% relative to a single freezing episode, and prompted prepupae to modify long-chain triacylglycerols to acetylated triacylglycerols. Long-term, repeated freezing did not significantly reduce survival but did reduce egg production by 9.8\% relative to a single freezing event. Exposure temperature did not affect any of these measures, suggesting that threshold crossing events may be more important to fitness than the intensity of stress in overwintering E. solidaginis.",2018,10.1242/jeb.177956,221,15,NA,jeb177956,Thermal variability; Physiological thresholds; Freeze tolerance; Repeated stress; Tephritidae

E. and Parkash, Ravi",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Insects in tropical wet or dry seasons are likely to cope with starvation stress through plastic changes (developmental as well as adult acclimation) in energy metabolites. Control and experimental groups of Zaprionus indianus flies were reared under wet or dry conditions, but adults were acclimated at different thermal or humidity conditions. Adult flies of the control group were acclimated at 27 degrees C and low (50\%) or high (60\%) relative humidity (RH). For experimental groups, adult flies were acclimated at 32 degrees C for 1 to 6 days and under low (40\%) or high (70\%) RH. For humidity acclimation, adult flies were acclimated at 27 degrees C but under low (40\%) or high (70\%) RH for 1 to 6 days. Plastic changes in experimental groups as compared with the control group (developmental as well as adult acclimation) revealed significant accumulation of body lipids owing to thermal or humidity acclimation of wet season flies, but low humidity acclimation did not change the level of body lipids in dry season flies. Starvation resistance and body lipids were higher in the males of dry season flies but in the females of wet season flies. Adults acclimated under different thermal or humidity conditions exhibited changes in the rate of utilization of body lipids, carbohydrates and proteins. Adult acclimation of wet or dry season flies revealed plastic changes in mean daily fecundity; and a reduction in fecundity under starvation. Thus, thermal or humidity acclimation of adults revealed plastic changes in energy metabolites to support starvation resistance of wet or dry season flies.",2018,10.1242/jeb.174482,221,9,NA,jeb174482,Tropical drosophilid; Developmental acclimation; Adult acclimation; Heat acclimation; Humidity acclimation

Energy metabolism and substrate management play a crucial role in their survival success. Therefore, understanding the role of the gluconeogenic pathway and demonstrating its existence in amphibians is essential. In this study, we exposed the subtropical frog Boana pulchella to cooling (-2.5 degrees C for 24 h) and dehydration conditions (40\% of body water loss), followed by recovery (24 h), and assessed gluconeogenesis activity from alanine, lactate, glycerol and glutamine in the liver, muscle and kidney. We report for the first time that gluconeogenesis activity by C-14-alanine and C-14-lactate conversion to glucose occurs in the muscle tissue of frogs, and this tissue activity is influenced by environmental conditions. Against the control group, liver gluconeogenesis from C-14-lactate and C-14-glycerol was lower during cooling and recovery (P<0.01), and gluconeogenesis from C-14-glutamine in the kidneys was also lower during cooling (P<0.05). In dehydration exposure, gluconeogenesis from C-14-lactate in the liver was lower during recovery, and that from C-14-alanine in the muscle was lower during dehydration (P<0.05). Moreover, we observed that gluconeogenesis activity and substrate preference respond differently to cold and dehydration. These findings highlight tissue-specific plasticity dependent on the nature of the encountered stressor, offering valuable insights for future studies exploring this plasticity, elucidating the importance of the gluconeogenic pathway and characterizing it in anuran physiology.",2024,10.1242/jeb.247259,227,11,NA,jeb247259,Anurans; Amphibians; Environmental stressors; Temperature; Humidity; Metabolism
article,Cherchez la femme - impact of ocean acidification on the egg jelly coat and attractants for sperm,"Foo, Shawna A. and Deaker, Dione and Byrne, Maria",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The impact of ocean acidification on marine invertebrate eggs and its consequences for sperm chemotaxis are unknown. In the sea urchins Heliocidaris tuberculata and Heliocidaris erythrogramma, with small (93 mu m) and large (393 mu m) eggs, respectively, we documented the effect of decreased pH on the egg jelly coat, an extracellular matrix that increases target size for sperm and contains sperm-attracting molecules. In near-future conditions (pH 7.8, 7.6), the jelly coat of H. tuberculata decreased by 11\% and 21\%, reducing egg target size by 9\% and 17\%, respectively. In contrast, the egg jelly coat of H erythrogramma was not affected. The reduction in the jelly coat has implications for sperm chemotaxis in H. tuberculata. In the presence of decreased pH and egg chemicals, the sperm of this species increased their velocity, motility and linearity, behaviour that was opposite to that seen for sperm exposed to egg chemicals in ambient conditions. Egg chemistry appears to cause a reduction in sperm velocity where attractants guide the sperm in the direction of the egg. Investigation of the effects of decreased pH on sperm isolated from the influence of egg chemistry does not provide an integrative assessment of the effects of ocean acidification on sperm function. Differences in the sensitivity of the jelly coat of the two species is likely associated with egg evolution in H. erythrogramma. We highlight important unappreciated impacts of ocean acidification on marine gamete functionality, and insights into potential winners and losers in a changing ocean, pointing to the advantage conveyed by the evolution of large eggs.",2018,10.1242/jeb.177188,221,13,NA,177188,Egg extracellular matrix; Egg size; Target size; Broadcast spawning; Sperm chemotaxis; Heliocidaris

For animals that cannot be easily observed in the wild, FMR can also be used in concert with dietary data to quantitatively assess their role as consumers, improving understanding of the trophic linkages that structure food webs and allowing for informed management decisions. Here, we modelled the FMR of Greenland sharks (Somniosus microcephalus) equipped with biologger packages or pop-up archival satellite tags (PSATs) in two coastal inlets of Baffin Island (Nunavut) using metabolic scaling relationships for mass, temperature and activity. We estimated that Greenland sharks had an overall mean (+/- s.d.) FMR of 21.67 +/- 2.30 mg O-2 h(-1) kg(-0.84) (n=30; 1-4 day accelerometer package deployments) while residing inside these cold-water fiord systems in the late summer, and 25.48 +/- 0.47 mg O-2 h(-1) kg(-0.84) (n=6; PSATs) over an entire year. When considering prey consumption rate, an average shark in these systems (224 kg) requires a maintenance ration of 61-193 g of fish or marine mammal prey daily. As Greenland sharks are a lethargic polar species, these low FMR estimates, and corresponding prey consumption estimates, suggest they require very little energy to sustain themselves under natural conditions. These data provide the first characterization of the energetics and consumer role of this vulnerable and understudied species in the wild, which is essential given growing pressures from climate change and expanding commercial fisheries in the Arctic.",2022,10.1242/jeb.242994,225,7,NA,jeb24299,Biologging; Ecology; Energetics; Metabolism; Food web dynamics
article,Elevated temperature and acclimation time affect metabolic performance in the heavily exploited Nile perch of Lake Victoria,"Nyboer, Elizabeth A. and Chapman, Lauren J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Increasing water temperatures owing to anthropogenic climate change are predicted to negatively impact the aerobic metabolic performance of aquatic ectotherms. Specifically, it has been hypothesized that thermal increases result in reductions in aerobic scope (AS), which lead to decreases in energy available for essential fitness and performance functions. Consequences of warming are anticipated to be especially severe for warm-adapted tropical species as they are thought to have narrow thermal windows and limited plasticity for coping with elevated temperatures. In this study we test how predicted warming may affect the aerobic performance of Nile perch (Lates niloticus), a commercially harvested fish species in the Lake Victoria basin of East Africa. We measured critical thermal maxima (CTmax) and key metabolic variables such as AS and excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) across a range of temperatures, and compared responses between acute (3-day) exposures and 3-week acclimations. CTmax increased with acclimation temperature; however, 3-week-acclimated fish had higher overall CTmax than acutely exposed individuals. Nile perch also showed the capacity to increase or maintain high AS even at temperatures well beyond their current range; however, acclimated Nile perch had lower AS compared with acutely exposed fish. These changes were accompanied by lower EPOC, suggesting that drops in AS may reflect improved energy utilization after acclimation, a finding that is supported by improvements in growth at high temperatures over the acclimation period. Overall, the results challenge predictions that tropical species have limited thermal plasticity, and that high temperatures will be detrimental because of limitations in AS.",2017,10.1242/jeb.163022,220,20,3782-3793,NA,Aerobic scope; Tropical fisheries; Respirometry; Climate change; Thermal tolerance

Ecologically relevant performance traits were tested at different temperatures to evaluate their thermal dependence, and temperature-performance breadths for 80\% and 90\% of each performance trait were calculated. Our results show distinct differences in the thermal dependence of speed-versus force-related performance traits. Moreover, our results show that the semi-arid species is better adapted to higher temperatures and as such has a better chance of coping with the predicted increases in environmental temperature. The mesic area-adapted species seems to be more sensitive to an increase in temperature and could therefore potentially be threatened by the predicted future climate change.

For marine mammals such as beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas), the first step in modeling this bioenergetic balance requires an examination of resting and active metabolic demands. Here, we used open-flow respirometry to measure oxygen consumption during surface rest and submerged swimming by trained beluga whales, and compared these measurements with those of a commonly studied odontocete, the Atlantic bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). Both resting metabolic rate (3012 +/- 126.0 kJ h(-1)) and total cost of transport (1.4 +/- 0.1 J kg(-1) m(-1)) of beluga whales were consistent with predicted values for moderately sized marine mammals in temperate to cold-water environments, including dolphins measured in the present study. By coupling the rate of oxygen consumption during submerged swimming with locomotor metrics from animal-borne accelerometer tags, we developed predictive relationships for assessing energetic costs from swim speed, stroke rate and partial dynamic acceleration. Combining these energetic data with calculated aerobic dive limits for beluga whales (8.8 min), we found that high-speed responses to disturbance markedly reduce the whale's capacity for prolonged submergence, pushing the cetaceans to costly anaerobic performances that require prolonged recovery periods. Together, these species-specific energetic measurements for beluga whales provide two important metrics, gait-related locomotor costs and aerobic capacity limits, for identifying relative levels of physiological vulnerability to anthropogenic disturbances that have become increasingly pervasive in their Arctic habitats.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246899,227,5,NA,jeb246899,Field metabolic rate; Cost of transport; Accelerometry; Marine mammals; Cetaceans; Dolphins; Metabolic rate; Diving
article,Each to their own: skeletal muscles of different function use different biochemical strategies during aestivation at high temperature,"Young, Karen M. and Cramp, Rebecca L. and Franklin, Craig E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Preservation of muscle morphology depends on a continuing regulatory balance between molecules that protect and molecules that damage muscle structural integrity. Excessive disruption of the biochemical balance that favours reactive oxygen species (ROS) in disused muscles may lead to oxidative stress, which in turn is associated with increased atrophic or apoptotic signalling and/or oxidative damage to the muscle and thus muscle disuse atrophy. Increases in the rate of oxygen consumption likely increase the overall generation of ROS in vivo. Temperature-induced increases in oxygen consumption rate occur in some muscles of ectotherms undergoing prolonged muscular disuse during aestivation. In the green-striped burrowing frog, Cyclorana alboguttata, both large jumping and small non-jumping muscles undergo atrophy seemingly commensurate with their rate of oxygen consumption during aestivation. However, because the extent of atrophy in these muscles is not enhanced at higher temperatures, despite a temperature-sensitive rate of oxygen consumption in the jumping muscle, we proposed that muscles are protected by biochemical means that, when mobilised at higher temperatures, inhibit atrophy. We proposed that the biochemical response to temperature would be muscle-specific. We examined the effect of temperature on the antioxidant and heat shock protein systems and determined the extent of oxidative damage to lipids and proteins in two functionally different skeletal muscles, the gastrocnemius (jumping muscle) and the iliofibularis (non-jumping muscle), by aestivating frogs at 24 and 30 degrees C for 6. months. We assayed small molecule antioxidant capacity, mitochondrial and cytosolic superoxide dismutase activities and Hsp70 concentrations to show that protective mechanisms in disused muscles are differentially regulated with respect to both temperature and aestivation. High aestivation temperature results in an antioxidant response in the metabolically temperature-sensitive jumping muscle. We assayed lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation to show that oxidative damage is apparent during aestivation and its pattern is muscle-specific, but unaffected by temperature. Consideration is given to how the complex responses of muscle biochemistry inform the different strategies muscles may use in regulating their oxidative environment during extended disuse and disuse at high temperature.",2013,10.1242/jeb.072827,216,6,1012-1024,NA,disuse; muscle; antioxidant; Hsp70; ROS; oxidative damage; aestivation; temperature
article,Chum salmon migrating upriver adjust to environmental temperatures through metabolic compensation,"Abe, Takaaki K. and Kitagawa, Takashi and Makiguchi, Yuya and Sato, Katsufumi",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Ectotherms adjust their thermal performance to various thermal ranges by altering their metabolic rates. These metabolic adjustments involve plastic and/or genetic traits and pathways depend on species-specific ecological contexts. Chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) are ecologically unique among the Pacific salmonids as early-run and late-run populations are commonly observed in every part of their range. In the Sanriku coastal area, Japan, early-run adults experience high water temperatures (12-24 degrees C) during their migration, compared with those of the late-run adults (4-15 degrees C), suggesting that the two populations might have different thermal performance. Here, we found population-specific differences in the thermal sensitivities of metabolic rates {[}resting metabolic rate, RMR, and maximum (aerobic) metabolic rate, MMR] and critical temperature maxima. Using these parameters, we estimated thermal performance curves of absolute aerobic scope (AAS). The populations had different thermal performance curves of AAS, and in both populations high values of AAS were maintained throughout the range of ecologically relevant temperatures. However, the populations did not vary substantially in the peak (MS at optimal temperature, T-optAAS) or breadth (width of sub-optimal temperature range) of the performance curves. The MS curve of early-run fish was shifted approximately 3 degrees C higher than that of late-run fish. Furthermore, when the data for RMR and MMR were aligned to the thermal differences from T-optAAS, it became clear that the populations did not differ in the temperature dependence of their metabolic traits. Our results indicate that chum salmon thermally accommodate through compensatory alterations in metabolic rates. Our results imply that metabolic plasticity and/or the effect of genetic variance on plasticity might play a pivotal role in their thermal accommodation.",2019,10.1242/jeb.186189,222,3,NA,jeb186189,Metabolic rate; Aerobic scope; Thermal adaptation; Metabolic thermal compensation; Salmonid

Flies were exposed to one of four developmental acclimation temperatures (T-acc: 15, 20, 25, 30 degrees C) during their pupal stage and tested at these temperatures (T-test) as adults using a full-factorial study design. Major factors influencing flight performance included sex, body mass, T-test and the interaction between T-test and T-acc. Successful flight performance increased with increasing T-test across all acclimation groups (from 10\% at 15 degrees C to 77\% at 30 degrees C). Although T-acc did not affect flight performance independently, it did have a significant interaction effect with T-test. Multiple comparisons showed that flies which had been acclimated to 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C performed better than those acclimated to 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C when tested at cold temperatures, but warm-acclimated flies did not outperform cold-acclimated flies at warmer temperatures. This provides partial support for the `colder is better' hypothesis. To explain these results, several flight-related traits were examined to determine whether T-acc influenced flight performance as a consequence of changes in body or wing morphology, whole-animal metabolic rate or cytochrome c oxidase enzyme activity. Although significant effects of T-acc could be detected in several of the traits examined, with an emphasis on sex-related differences, increased flight performance could not be explained solely on the basis of changes in any of these traits. Overall, these results are important for understanding dispersal physiology despite the fact that the mechanisms of acclimation-related changes in flight performance remain unresolved.",2014,10.1242/jeb.106526,217,19,3545-3556,NA,Beneficial acclimation hypothesis; Phenotypic plasticity; Developmental variation; Mediterranean fruit fly

R. and Herbert, Neill A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"It was hypothesised that chronic hypoxia acclimation (preconditioning) would alter the behavioural low-O-2 avoidance strategy of fish as a result of both aerobic and anaerobic physiological adaptations. Avoidance and physiological responses of juvenile snapper (Pagrus auratus) were therefore investigated following a 6 week period of moderate hypoxia exposure (10.2-12.1 kPa P-O2, 21 +/- 1 degrees C) and compared with those of normoxic controls (P-O2=20-21 kPa, 21 +/- 1 degrees C). The critical oxygen pressure (P-crit) limit of both groups was unchanged at similar to 7 kPa, as were standard, routine and maximum metabolic rates. However, hypoxia-acclimated fish showed increased tolerances to hypoxia in behavioural choice chambers by avoiding lower P-O2 levels (3.3 +/- 0.7 vs 5.3 +/- 1.1 kPa) without displaying greater perturbations of lactate or glucose. This behavioural change was associated with unexpected physiological adjustments. For example, a decrease in blood O-2 carrying capacity was observed after hypoxia acclimation. Also unexpected was an increase in whole-blood P-50 following acclimation to low O-2, perhaps facilitating Hb-O-2 off-loading to tissues. In addition, cardiac mitochondria measured in situ using permeabilised fibres showed improved O-2 uptake efficiencies. The proportion of the anaerobic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase, at least relative to the aerobic marker enzyme citrate synthase, also increased in heart and skeletal red muscle, indicating enhanced anaerobic potential, or in situ lactate metabolism, in these tissues. Overall, these data suggest that a prioritization of O-2 delivery and O-2 utilisation over O-2 uptake during long-term hypoxia may convey a significant survival benefit to snapper in terms of behavioural low-O-2 tolerance.",2013,10.1242/jeb.073023,216,3,369-378,NA,preconditioning; Sparidae; oxygen affinity; metabolism; swimming; activity; haemoglobin; mitochondria; respiration

Arctic char exhibited rapid compensatory cardiac plasticity similar to past observations following prolonged warm acclimation: they reduced integral H,max over intermediate temperatures (-8\%), improved their ability to increase integral H,max during warming (+10\%), and increased (+1.3 degrees C) the temperature at the onset of an arrhythmic heartbeat, a sign of cardiac failure. This rapid cardiac plasticity may help migrating fishes such as Arctic char mitigate short-term thermal challenges.

However, when mean minimal ambient temperature (T-a) reaches -10 degrees C, the chickadee phenotype appears to provide enough spare capacity to endure days with colder T-a, down to -20 degrees C or below. This suggests that birds could also maintain a higher antioxidant capacity as part of their cold-acclimated phenotype to deal with sudden decreases in temperature. Here, we tested how environmental mismatch affected oxidative stress by comparing cold-acclimated (- 5 degrees C) and transition (20 degrees C) phenotypes in chickadees exposed to an acute 15 degrees C drop in temperature with that of control individuals. We measured superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities, as well as lipid peroxidation damage and antioxidant scavenging capacity in pectoralis muscle, brain, intestine and liver. We generally found differences between seasonal phenotypes and across tissues, but no differences with respect to an acute cold drop treatment. Our data suggest oxidative stress is closely matched to whole-animal physiology in cold-acclimated birds compared with transition birds, implying that changes to the oxidative stress system happen slowly.",2020,10.1242/jeb.218826,223,8,NA,jeb218826,Thermoregulation; Mitotic tissue; Post-mitotic tissue; Rate of change; Cold drop; Seasonality

The algivorous sea slug Elysia viridis can steal and retain chloroplasts from the marine alga Bryopsis sp. for months when starved, but chloroplast retention is mere weeks when they are fed another green alga, Chaetomorpha sp. To examine plasticity in thermal tolerance and changes in net oxygen exchange when fed and starving, slugs fed each alga were acclimated to 17 degrees C (the current maximum temperature to which they are exposed in nature) and 22 degrees C (the increase predicted for 2100) and measured at different points during starvation. We also examined increased illumination to evaluate a potential tradeoff between increased oxygen production but faster chloroplast degradation. Following acclimation, we subjected slugs to acute thermal stress to determine their thermal tolerance. We also measured net oxygen exchange before and after acute thermal stress. Thermal tolerance improved in slugs acclimated to 22 degrees C, indicating they can acclimate to temperatures higher than they naturally experience. All slugs exhibited net oxygen uptake, and rates were highest in recently fed slugs before exposure to acute thermal stress. Oxygen uptake was suppressed following acute thermal stress. Under brighter light, slugs exhibited improved thermal tolerance, possibly because photosynthetic oxygen production alleviated oxygen limitation. Accordingly, this advantage disappeared later in starvation when photosynthesis ceased. Thus, E. viridis can cope with heatwaves by suppressing metabolism and plastically adjusting heat tolerance; however, starvation influences a slug's thermal tolerance and oxygen uptake such that continuous access to algal food for its potential nutritive and oxygenic benefits is critical when facing thermal stress.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246331,227,10,NA,jeb248146,CT max; Kleptoplasty; Metabolism; Sacoglossa; Starvation
article,Inactivity and the passive slowing effect of cold on resting metabolism as the primary drivers of energy savings in overwintering fishes,"Reeve, Connor and Rowsey, Lauren E. and Speers-Roesch, Ben",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Winter dormancy is a seasonal survival strategy common among temperate ectotherms, characterized by inactivity, fasting and low metabolic rates. Previous reports of metabolic rate depression (MRD) in winter-dormant ectotherms, including many fishes, may have resulted from confounding influences of temperature-dependent variation in activity on metabolic rate measurements. We hypothesize that, as demonstrated recently in the winter-dormant cunner (Tautogolabrus adspersus), inactivity and the passive physicochemical (Arrhenius) effect of cold on standard metabolic rate (SMR) are the common primary mechanisms underlying the low metabolic rates among winter-dormant fishes. Using automated video tracking, we investigated threshold temperatures for winter dormancy onset (major reductions in activity, increased sheltering and fasting) in four phylogenetically diverse teleost species reported to be winter dormant: cunner, pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus), American eel (Anguilla rostrata) and mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus). All species showed large activity and feeding reductions, but the magnitude of change and dormancy threshold temperature was species-specific. We propose that a continuum of overwintering responses exists among fishes from dormant to lethargic to active. The relationship between activity and metabolic rate was then measured using video-recorded automated respirometry during acute cooling and following cold acclimation in pumpkinseed, mummichog and eel. In all species, activity and metabolic rate were strongly correlated at all temperatures, and cooling caused reduced activity and metabolic rate. When variation in activity was controlled for across temperatures spanning the dormancy thresholds, the thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate including SMR indicated the predominance of passive physicochemical influences (mean Q(10) <3.5), rather than active MRD. Activity reductions and physicochemical slowing of metabolism owing to cold appear to be the primary energy-saving mechanisms in overwintering fishes.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243407,225,8,NA,jeb243407,Metabolic rate; Energy expenditure; Activity; Temperature; Fish; Hibernation; Torpor
article,Thermoregulatory morphodynamics of honeybee swarm clusters,"Peters, Jacob M. and Peleg, Orit and Mahadevan, L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"During reproductive swarming, honeybee clusters of more than 10,000 individuals that hang from structures in the environment (e.g. tree branches) are exposed to diumal variations in ambient temperature for up to a week. Swarm clusters collectively modulate their morphology in response to these variations (i.e. expanding/ contracting in response to heating/cooling) to maintain their internal temperature within a tolerable range and to avoid exhausting their honey stores prematurely. To understand the spatiotemporal aspects of thermoregulatory morphing, we measured the change in size, shape and internal temperature profiles of swarm clusters in response to dynamic temperature ramp perturbations. Swarm clusters showed a two-fold variation in their volume/density when heated from 15 degrees C to 30 degrees C. However, they did not reach an equilibrium size or shape when held at 30 degrees C for 5 h, long after the core temperature of the cluster had stabilized. Furthermore, the changes in cluster shape and size were hysteretic, contracting in response to cooling faster than expanding in response to heating. Although the base contact diameter of the cluster increased continuously when the swarm was heated, the change in length of the swarm (base to tip) over time was nonmonotonic. Consequently, the aspect ratio of the swarm fluctuated continuously even when held at a constant temperature. Taken together, our results quantify the hysteretic and anisotropic morphological responses of swarm clusters to ambient temperature variations while suggesting that both mechanical constraints and heat transfer govern their thermoregulatory morphodynamics.",2022,10.1242/jeb.242234,225,5,NA,jeb242234,Apis mellifera; Collective behavior; Thermoregulation
article,"The role of stochastic thermal environments in modulating the thermal physiology of an intertidal limpet, <i>Lottia digitalis</i>","Drake, Madeline J. and Miller, Nathan A. and Todgham, Anne E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Much of our understanding of the thermal physiology of intertidal organisms comes from experiments with animals acclimated under constant conditions and exposed to a single heat stress. In nature, however, the thermal environment is more complex. Aerial exposure and the unpredictable nature of thermal stress during low tides may be critical factors in defining the thermal physiology of intertidal organisms. In the fingered limpet, Lottia digitalis, we investigated whether upper temperature tolerance and thermal sensitivity were influenced by the pattern of fluctuation with which thermal stress was applied. Specifically, we examined whether there was a differential response (measured as cardiac performance) to repeated heat stress of a constant and predictable magnitude compared with heat stress applied in a stochastic and unpredictable nature. We also investigated differences in cellular metabolism and damage following immersion for insights into biochemical mechanisms of tolerance. Upper temperature tolerance increased with aerial exposure, but no significant differences were found between predictable treatments of varying magnitudes (13 degrees C versus 24 degrees C versus 32 degrees C). Significant differences in thermal tolerance were found between unpredictable trials with different heating patterns. There were no significant differences among treatments in basal citrate synthase activity, glycogen content, oxidative stress or antioxidants. Our results suggest that aerial exposure and recent thermal history, paired with relief from high low-tide temperatures, are important factors modulating the capacity of limpets to deal with thermal stress.",2017,10.1242/jeb.159020,220,17,3072-3083,NA,Variability; Environmental predictability; Stress tolerance; Cardiac performance; Temperature
article,Body temperature changes during simulated bacterial infection in a songbird: fever at night and hypothermia during the day,"Skold-Chiriac, Sandra and Nord, Andreas and Tobler, Michael and Nilsson, Jan-Ake and Hasselquist, Dennis",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Although fever (a closely regulated increase in body temperature in response to infection) typically is beneficial, it is energetically costly and may induce detrimentally high body temperatures. This can increase the susceptibility to energetic bottlenecks and risks of overheating in some organisms. Accordingly, it could be particularly interesting to study fever in small birds, which have comparatively high metabolic rates and high, variable body temperatures. We therefore investigated two aspects of fever and other sickness behaviours (circadian variation, dose dependence) in a small songbird, the zebra finch. We injected lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at the beginning of either the day or the night, and subsequently monitored body temperature, body mass change and food intake for the duration of the response. We found pronounced circadian variation in the body temperature response to LPS injection, manifested by (dose-dependent) hypothermia during the day but fever at night. This resulted in body temperature during the peak response being relatively similar during the day and night. Day-to-night differences might be explained in the context of circadian variation in body temperature: songbirds have a high daytime body temperature that is augmented by substantial heat production peaks during activity. This might require a trade-off between the benefit of fever and the risk of overheating. In contrast, at night, when body temperature is typically lower and less variable, fever can be used to mitigate infection. We suggest that the change in body temperature during infection in small songbirds is context dependent and regulated to promote survival according to individual demands at the time of infection.",2015,10.1242/jeb.122150,218,18,2961-2969,NA,Acute phase response; Circadian variation; Dose dependence; Heterothermy; LPS; Sickness behaviour; Taeniopygia guttata; Zebra finch

Here, we examined effects of high temperature on the intertidal limpet Cellana toreuma to determine how the temperatures at which (1) organ failure (cardiac function), (2) irreversible protein damage (carbonylation) and (3) expression of genes encoding proteins involved in molecular chaperoning (hsp70 and hsp90) and metabolic regulation (ampk and sirt1) occur compare with field temperatures, which commonly exceed 30 degrees C and can reach 46 degrees C. Heart failure, indexed by the Arrhenius break temperature, occurred at 34.3 degrees C. Protein carbonylation rose significantly at 38 degrees C. Genes for heat shock proteins HSP70 (hsp70) and HSP90 (hsp90), for two subunits of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (ampk alpha and ampk beta) and for histone/protein deacetylase SIRT1 (sirt1) all showed increased expression at 30 degrees C. Temperatures of maximal expression differed among genes, as did temperatures at which upregulation ceased. Expression patterns for ampk and sirt1 indicate that heat stress influenced cellular energy homeostasis; above similar to 30 degrees C, upregulation of ATP-generating pathways is suggested by elevated expression of genes for ampk; an altered balance between reliance on carbohydrate and lipid fuels is indicated by changes in expression of sirt1. These results show that C. toreuma commonly experiences temperatures that induce expression of genes associated with the stress response (hsp70 and hsp90) and regulation of energy metabolism (ampk and sirt1). At high temperatures, there is likely to be a shift away from anabolic processes such as growth to catabolic processes, to provide energy for coping with stress-induced damage, notably to proteins.",2013,10.1242/jeb.084269,216,17,3273-3282,NA,body temperature; Cellana toreuma; energy budget; physiological adaptation; rocky intertidal zone
article,"Shelter availability, stress level and digestive performance in the aspic viper","Bonnet, Xavier and Fizesan, Alain and Michel, Catherine Louise",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The lack of shelter can perturb behaviors, increase stress level and thus alter physiological performance (e. g. digestive, immune or reproductive functions). Although intuitive, such potential impacts of lack of shelter remain poorly documented. We manipulated shelter availability and environmental and physiological variables (i.e. access to a heat source, predator attack, feeding status) in a viviparous snake, and assessed sun-basking behavior, digestive performance (i.e. digestive transit time, crude estimate of assimilation, regurgitation rate) and plasma corticosterone levels (a proxy of stress level). Shelter deprivation provoked a strong increase in sun-basking behavior and thus elevated body temperature, even in unfed individuals for which energy savings would have been otherwise beneficial. The lack of heat was detrimental to digestive performance; simulated predator attacks worsened the situation and entailed a further deterioration of digestion. The combination of the lack of shelter with cool ambient temperatures markedly elevated basal corticosterone level and was associated with low digestive performance. This hormonal effect was absent when only one negative factor was involved, suggesting a threshold response. Overall, our results revealed important non-linear cascading impacts of shelter availability on stress-hormone levels, behaviors and physiological performance.

In this context, our study aimed to characterize regulations that occur along the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis in male fossorial water voles (Arvicola terrestris, also known as Arvicola amphibius) throughout the year and to further probe the implication of photoperiod in these seasonal regulations. Our monthly field monitoring showed dramatic seasonal changes in the morphology and activity of reproductive organs, as well as in the androgen-dependent lateral scent glands. Moreover, our data uncovered seasonal variations at the hypothalamic level. During the breeding season, kisspeptin expression in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) decreases, while RFRP3 expression in the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH) increases. Our follow-up laboratory study revealed activation of the reproductive axis and confirmed a decrease in kisspeptin expression in males exposed to a long photoperiod (summer condition) compared with those maintained under a short photoperiod (winter condition) that retain all features reminiscent of sexual inhibition.

article,How modularity and heterotrophy complicate the understanding of the causes of thermal performance curves: the case of feeding rate in a filter-feeding animal,"Powell, Jackson A. and Burgess, Scott C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Warming global temperatures have consequences for biological rates. Feeding rates reflect the intake of energy that fuels survival, growth and reproduction. However, temperature can also affect food abundance and quality, as well as feeding behavior, which all affect feeding rate, making it challenging to understand the pathways by which temperature affects the intake of energy. Therefore, we experimentally assessed how clearance rate varied across a thermal gradient in a filter -feeding colonial marine invertebrate (the bryozoan Bugula neritina ). We also assessed how temperature affects phytoplankton as a food source, and zooid states within a colony that affect energy budgets and feeding behavior. Clearance rate increased linearly from 18 degrees C to 32 degrees C, a temperature range that the population experiences most of the year. However, temperature increased algal cell size, and decreased the proportion of feeding zooids, suggesting indirect effects of temperature on clearance rates. Temperature increased polypide regression, possibly as a stress response because satiation occurred quicker, or because phytoplankton quality declined. Temperature had a greater effect on clearance rate per feeding zooid than it did per total zooids. Together, these results suggest that the effect of temperature on clearance rate at the colony level is not just the outcome of individual zooids feeding more in direct response to temperature but also emerges from temperature increasing polypide regression and the remaining zooids increasing their feeding rates in response. Our study highlights some of the challenges for understanding why temperature affects feeding rates, especially for understudied, yet ecologically important, marine colonial organisms.",2024,10.1242/jeb.247776,227,12,NA,jeb247776,Climate change; Thermal tolerance; Modular organisms; Marine; Feeding systems; Indirect effects
article,Mitochondrial uncoupling prevents cold-induced oxidative stress: a case study using UCP1 knockout mice,"Stier, Antoine and Bize, Pierre and Habold, Caroline and Bouillaud, Frederic and Massemin, Sylvie and Criscuolo, Franois",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The relationship between metabolism and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by the mitochondria has often been (wrongly) viewed as straightforward, with increased metabolism leading to higher generation of pro-oxidants. Insights into mitochondrial functioning show that oxygen consumption is principally coupled with either energy conversion as ATP or as heat, depending on whether the ATP-synthase or the mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) is driving respiration. However, these two processes might greatly differ in terms of oxidative costs. We used a cold challenge to investigate the oxidative stress consequences of an increased metabolism achieved either by the activation of an uncoupled mechanism (i.e. UCP1 activity) in the brown adipose tissue (BAT) of wild-type mice or by ATP-dependent muscular shivering thermogenesis in mice deficient for UCP1. Although both mouse strains increased their metabolism by more than twofold when acclimatised for 4 weeks to moderate cold (12 C), only mice deficient for UCP1 suffered from elevated levels of oxidative stress. When exposed to cold, mice deficient for UCP1 showed an increase of 20.2\% in plasmatic reactive oxygen metabolites, 81.8\% in muscular oxidized glutathione and 47.1\% in muscular protein carbonyls. In contrast, there was no evidence of elevated levels of oxidative stress in the plasma, muscles or BAT of wild-type mice exposed to cold despite a drastic increase in BAT activity. Our study demonstrates differing oxidative costs linked to the functioning of two highly metabolically active organs during thermogenesis, and advises careful consideration of mitochondrial functioning when investigating the links between metabolism and oxidative stress.",2014,10.1242/jeb.092700,217,4,624-630,NA,Uncoupling protein; Oxidative stress; Reactive oxygen species; Cold; Nonshivering thermogenesis; Mitochondria

The point above which ion channel function and sinoatrial contractility in vitro, and electrocardiogram (ECG) in vivo, started to fail (break point temperature, BPT) was determined by acute temperature increases. In general, electrical excitation of the heart was most sensitive to heat in the intact animal (electrocardiogram, ECG) and least sensitive in isolated cardiac myocytes (ion currents). BPTs of Ca2+ and K+ currents of cardiac myocytes were much higher (>28 degrees C) than BPT of in vivo heart rate (23.5 +/- 0.6 degrees C) (P<0.05). A striking exception among sarcolemmal ion conductances was the Na+ current (I-Na), which was the most heat-sensitive molecular function, with a BPT of 20.9 +/- 0.5 degrees C. The low heat tolerance of I-Na was reflected as a low BPT for the rate of action potential upstroke in vitro (21.7 +/- 1.2 degrees C) and the velocity of impulse transmission in vivo (21.9 +/- 2.2 degrees C). These findings from different levels of biological organization strongly suggest that heat-dependent deterioration of Na+ channel function disturbs normal spread of electrical excitation over the heart, leading to progressive variability of cardiac rhythmicity (missed beats, bursts of fast beating), reduction of heart rate and finally cessation of the normal heartbeat. Among the cardiac ion currents I-Na is `the weakest link' and possibly a limiting factor for upper thermal tolerance of electrical excitation in the brown trout heart. Heat sensitivity of I-Na may result from functional requirements for very high flux rates and fast gating kinetics of the Na+ channels, i.e. a trade-off between high catalytic activity and thermal stability.",2014,10.1242/jeb.091272,217,2,299-309,NA,High temperature tolerance; Fish heart; Action potential; Ion current; Electrocardiogram

Adaptive enhancement of thermogenic performance under hypoxic conditions may be achieved via physiological adjustments that occur within the lifetime of individuals (phenotypic plasticity) and/or genetically based changes that occur across generations, but their relative contributions to performance differences between highland and lowland natives are unclear. Here, we examined potentially evolved differences in thermogenic performance between populations of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) that are native to different altitudes. The purpose of the study was to assess the contribution of phenotypic plasticity to population differences in thermogenic performance under hypoxia. We used a common-garden deacclimation experiment to demonstrate that highland deer mice have enhanced thermogenic capacities under hypoxia, and that performance differences between highland and lowland mice persist when individuals are born and reared under common-garden conditions, suggesting that differences in thermogenic capacity have a genetic basis. Conversely, population differences in thermogenic endurance appear to be entirely attributable to physiological plasticity during adulthood. These combined results reveal distinct sources of phenotypic plasticity for different aspects of thermogenic performance, and suggest that thermogenic capacity and endurance may have different mechanistic underpinnings.",2013,10.1242/jeb.075598,216,7,1160-1166,NA,developmental plasticity; high-altitude adaptation; hypoxia; Peromyscus; thermoregulation

Here, using osmotic perturbations of bullfrog muscle, we explored the impacts of physiologically relevant volume fluctuations on a fundamental property of muscle: passive force production. We found that passive force and fluid volume were correlated over a 20\% increase in muscle volume, with small changes in volume having significant effects on force (e.g. a 5\% volume increase results in a >10\% passive force increase). A simple physical model of muscle morphology reproduces these effects.

Tracy and Timpe, Alexander W. and Welsh, Christina J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The critical oxygen partial pressure (P-crit), typically defined as the P-O2 below which an animal's metabolic rate (MR) is unsustainable, is widely interpreted as a measure of hypoxia tolerance. Here, P-crit is defined as the P-O2 at which physiological oxygen supply (alpha(0)) reaches its maximum capacity (alpha; mu mol O-2 g(-1 )h(-1) kPa(-1)). alpha is a species- and temperature-specific constant describing the oxygen dependency of the maximum metabolic rate (MMR=P(O2)x alpha) or, equivalently, the MR dependence of P-crit (P-crit MR/alpha). We describe the a-method, in which t ere- the MR is monitored as oxygen declines and, for each measurement period, is divided by the corresponding P-O2 to provide the concurrent oxygen supply (alpha(0) =MR/P-O2). The highest alpha(0) value (or, more conservatively, the mean of the three highest values) is designated as alpha. The same value of alpha is reached at P-crit for any MR regardless of previous or subsequent metabolic activity. The MR need not be constant (regulated), standardized or exhibit a clear breakpoint at P-crit for accurate determination of alpha. The alpha-method has several advantages over P-crit determination and non-linear analyses, including: (1) less ambiguity and greater accuracy, (2) fewer constraints in respirometry methodology and analysis, and (3) greater predictive power and ecological and physiological insight. Across the species evaluated here, a values are correlated with MR, but not P-crit. Rather than an index of hypoxia tolerance, P-crit is a reflection of alpha, which evolves to support maximum energy demands and aerobic scope at the prevailing temperature and oxygen level.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242210,224,8,NA,jeb242210,Aerobic scope; Hypoxia; Metabolic rate; Ocean deoxygenation; Oxygen and capacity limited thermal tolerance; Oxygen supply; Respirometry
article,Social hierarchy reveals thermoregulatory trade-offs in response to repeated stressors,"Robertson, Joshua K. and Mastromonaco, Gabriela F. and Burness, Gary",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Coping with stressors can require substantial energetic investment, and when resources are limited, such investment can preclude simultaneous expenditure on other biological processes. Among endotherms, energetic demands of thermoregulation can also be immense, yet our understanding of whether a stress response is sufficient to induce changes in thermoregulatory investment is limited. Using the black-capped chickadee as a model species, we tested a hypothesis that stress-induced changes in surface temperature (T-s), a well-documented phenomenon across vertebrates, stem from trade-offs between thermoregulation and stress responsiveness. Because social subordination is known to constrain access to resources in this species, we predicted that T-s and dry heat loss of social subordinates. but not social dominants. would fall under stress exposure at low ambient temperatures (T-a), and rise under stress exposure at high T-a, thus permitting a reduction in total energetic expenditure toward thermoregulation. To test our predictions, we exposed four social groups of chickadees to repeated stressors and control conditions across T-a gradient (n=30 days/treatment/group), whilst remotely monitoring social interactions and T-s. Supporting our hypothesis, we show that: (1) social subordinates (n=12), who fed less than social dominants and alone experienced stress-induced mass-loss, displayed significantly larger changes in T-s following stress exposure than social dominants (n=8), and (2) stress-induced changes in T-s significantly increased heat conservation at low T-a and heat dissipation at high T-a among social subordinates alone. These results suggest that chickadees adjust their thermoregulatory strategies during stress exposure when resources are limited by ecologically relevant processes.",2020,10.1242/jeb.229047,223,21,NA,jeb229047,Dominance; Stress; Thermoregulation; Birds
article,Circadian rhythms and environmental disturbances - underexplored interactions,"Prokkola, Jenni M. and Nikinmaa, Mikko",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Biological rhythms control the life of virtually all organisms, impacting numerous aspects ranging from subcellular processes to behaviour. Many studies have shown that changes in abiotic environmental conditions can disturb or entrain circadian (similar to 24 h) rhythms. These expected changes are so large that they could impose risks to the long-term viability of populations. Climate change is a major global stressor affecting the fitness of animals, partially because it challenges the adaptive associations between endogenous clocks and temperature - consequently, one can posit that a large-scale natural experiment on the plasticity of rhythm-temperature interactions is underway. Further risks are posed by chemical pollution and the depletion of oxygen levels in aquatic environments. Here, we focused our attention on fish, which are at heightened risk of being affected by human influence and are adapted to diverse environments showing predictable changes in light conditions, oxygen saturation and temperature. The examined literature to date suggests an abundance of mechanisms that can lead to interactions between responses to hypoxia, pollutants or pathogens and regulation of endogenous rhythms, but also reveals gaps in our understanding of the plasticity of endogenous rhythms in fish and in how these interactions may be disturbed by human influence and affect natural populations. Here, we summarize research on the molecular mechanisms behind environment-clock interactions as they relate to oxygen variability, temperature and responses to pollutants, and propose ways to address these interactions more conclusively in future studies.",2018,10.1242/jeb.179267,221,16,NA,jeb179267,Photoperiod; Climate change; Xenobiotic; PAS protein; Stress; Clock gene
article,Regulatory mechanisms of metabolic flexibility in the dark-eyed junco (<i>Junco</i> <i>hyemalis</i>),"Stager, Maria and Swanson, David L. and Cheviron, Zachary A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Small temperate birds reversibly modify their aerobic performance to maintain thermoregulatory homeostasis under seasonally changing environmental conditions and these physiological adjustments may be attributable to changes in the expression of genes in the underlying regulatory networks. Here, we report the results of an experimental procedure designed to gain insight into the fundamental mechanisms of metabolic flexibility in the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis). We combined genomic transcriptional profiles with measures of metabolic enzyme activities and whole-animal thermogenic performance from juncos exposed to four 6-week acclimation treatments that varied in temperature (cold, 3 degrees C; warm, 24 degrees C) and photoperiod (short day, 8 h light: 16 h dark; long day, 16 h light: 8 h dark). Cold-acclimated birds increased thermogenic capacity compared with warm-acclimated birds, and this enhanced performance was associated with upregulation of genes involved in muscle hypertrophy, angiogenesis, and lipid transport and oxidation, as well as with catabolic enzyme activities. These physiological changes occurred over ecologically relevant timescales, suggesting that birds make regulatory adjustments to interacting, hierarchical pathways in order to seasonally enhance thermogenic capacity.",2015,10.1242/jeb.113472,218,5,767+,NA,Phenotypic flexibility; Seasonal adjustments; Winter acclimatization; Transcriptomics
article,Thermal constraints on exercise and metabolic performance do not explain the use of dormancy as an overwintering strategy in the cunner (Tautogolabrus adspersus),"Rowsey, Lauren E. and Reeve, Connor and Savoy, Tyler and Speers-Roesch, Ben",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Winter cold slows ectotherm physiology, potentially constraining activities and ecological opportunities at poleward latitudes. Yet, many fishes are winter -active, facilitated by thermal compensation that improves cold performance. Conversely, winter -dormant fishes (e.g. cunner, Tautogolabrus adspersus) become inactive and nonfeeding overwinter. Why are certain fishes winter -dormant? We hypothesized that winter dormancy is an adaptive behavioural response arising in poleward species that tolerate severe, uncompensated constraints of cold on their physiological performance. We predicted that below their dormancy threshold of 7-8 degrees C, exercise and metabolic performance of cunner are greatly decreased, even after acclimation (i.e. shows above -normal, uncompensated thermal sensitivity, Q(10)>1-3). We measured multiple key performance metrics (e.g. C -start maximum velocity, chase swimming speed, aerobic scope) in cunner after acute exposure to 26-2 degrees C (3 degrees C intervals using 14 degrees C -acclimated fish) or acclimation (5-8 weeks) to 14-2 degrees C (3 degrees C intervals bracketing the dormancy threshold). Performance declined with cooling, and the acute Q10 of all six performance rate metrics was significantly greater below the dormancy threshold temperature (Q(10),acute8-2 degrees C=1.5-4.9, mean=3.3) than above (Q(10),acute14-8 degrees C=1.1-1.9, mean=1.5), inferring a cold constraint. However, 2 degrees C acclimation (temporally more relevant to seasonal cooling) improved performance, abolishing the acute constraint (Q(10),acclimated8-2 degrees C=1.4-3.0, mean=2.0; also cf. Q(10),acclimated14-8 degrees C=1.2-2.9, mean=1.7). Thus, dormant cunner show partial cold -compensation of exercise and metabolic performance, similar to winter -active species. However, responsiveness to C -start stimuli was greatly cold -constrained even following acclimation, suggesting dormancy involves sensory limitation. Thermal constraints on metabolic and exercise physiology are not significant drivers of winter dormancy in cunner. In fact, compensatory plasticity at frigid temperatures is retained even in a dormant fish.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246741,227,1,NA,jeb246741,Metabolic rate; Burst swimming; Aerobic scope; Acclimation; Hibernation; Temperature; Winter; Fish
article,Ecologically relevant thermal fluctuations enhance offspring fitness: biological and methodological implications for studies of thermal developmental plasticity,"Hall, Joshua M. and Warner, Daniel A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Natural thermal environments are notably complex and challenging to mimic in controlled studies. Consequently, our understanding of the ecological relevance and underlying mechanisms of organismal responses to thermal environments is often limited. For example, studies of thermal developmental plasticity have provided key insights into the ecological consequences of temperature variation, but most laboratory studies use treatments that do not reflect natural thermal regimes. While controlling other important factors, we compared the effects of naturally fluctuating temperatures with those of commonly used laboratory regimes on development of lizard embryos and offspring phenotypes and survival. We incubated eggs in four treatments: three that followed procedures commonly used in the literature, and one that precisely mimicked naturally fluctuating nest temperatures. To explore context-dependent effects, we replicated these treatments across two seasonal regimes: relatively cool temperatures from nests constructed early in the season and warm temperatures from late-season nests. We show that natural thermal fluctuations have a relatively small effect on developmental variables but enhance hatchling performance and survival at cooler temperatures. Thus, natural thermal fluctuations are important for successful development and simpler approximations (e.g. repeated sine waves, constant temperatures) may poorly reflect natural systems under some conditions. Thus, the benefits of precisely replicating real-world temperatures in controlled studies may outweigh logistical costs. Although patterns might vary according to study system and research goals, our methodological approach demonstrates the importance of incorporating natural variation into controlled studies and provides biologists interested in thermal ecology with a framework for validating the effectiveness of commonly used methods.",2020,10.1242/jeb.231902,223,19,NA,jeb231902,Seasonality; Nest temperatures; Phenotype; Reptile developmental plasticity; Egg incubation

Elizabeth and Kingsolver, Joel G. and Willett, Christopher S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"High temperatures can negatively impact the performance and survival of organisms, particularly ectotherms. While an organism's response to high temperature stress clearly depends on current thermal conditions, its response may also be affected by the temporal pattern and duration of past temperature exposures. We used RNA sequencing of Manduca sexta larvae fat body tissue to evaluate how diurnal temperature fluctuations during development affected gene expression both independently and in conjunction with subsequent heat stress. Additionally, we compared gene expression between two M. sexta populations, a lab colony and a genetically related field population that have been separated for >300 generations and differ in their thermal sensitivities. Lab-adapted larvae were predicted to show increased expression responses to both single and repeated thermal stress, whereas recurrent exposure could decrease later stress responses for field individuals. We found large differences in overall gene expression patterns between the two populations across all treatments, as well as population-specific transcriptomic responses to temperature; more differentially expressed genes were upregulated in the field compared with lab larvae. Developmental temperature fluctuations alone had minimal effects on long-term gene expression patterns, with the exception of a somewhat elevated stress response in the lab population. Fluctuating rearing conditions did alter gene expression during exposure to later heat stress, but this effect depended on both the population and the particular temperature conditions. This study contributes to increased knowledge of molecular mechanisms underlying physiological responses of organisms to temperature fluctuations, which is needed for the development of more accurate thermal performance models.",2020,10.1242/jeb.213975,223,7,NA,jeb213975,Ectotherm; Diurnal temperature fluctuations; Time-dependent effects; Transcriptomics; Developmental acclimation; Population differentiation
article,Mitochondrial plasticity in the cerebellum of two anoxia-tolerant sharks: contrasting responses to anoxia/re-oxygenation,"Devaux, Jules B. L. and Hickey, Anthony J. R. and Renshaw, Gillian M. C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Exposure to anoxia leads to rapid ATP depletion, alters metabolic pathways and exacerbates succinate accumulation. Upon re-oxygenation, the preferential oxidation of accumulated succinate most often impairs mitochondrial function. Few species can survive prolonged periods of hypoxia and anoxia at tropical temperatures and those that do may rely on mitochondria plasticity in response to disruptions to oxygen availability. Two carpet sharks, the epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellaturn) and the grey carpet shark (Chiloscyllium punctatum) display different adaptive responses to prolonged anoxia: while H. ocellatum enters energy-conserving metabolic depression, C. punctatum temporarily elevates its haematocrit, prolonging oxygen delivery. High-resolution respirometry was used to investigate mitochondrial function in the cerebellum, a highly metabolically active organ that is oxygen sensitive and vulnerable to injury after anoxia/re-oxygenation (AR). Succinate was titrated into cerebellar preparations in vitro, with or without pre-exposure to AR, then the activity of mitochondrial complexes was examined. As in most vertebrates, C. punctatum mitochondria significantly increased succinate oxidation rates, with impaired complex I function post-AR. In contrast, H. ocellatum mitochondria inhibited succinate oxidation rates and both complex I and II capacities were conserved, resulting in preservation of oxidative phosphorylation capacity post-AR. Divergent mitochondrial plasticity elicited by elevated succinate post-AR parallels the inherently divergent physiological adaptations of these animals to prolonged anoxia, namely the absence (C. punctatum) and presence (H. ocellatum) of metabolic depression. As anoxia tolerance in these species also occurs at temperatures close to that for humans. examining their mitochondrial responses to AR could provide insights for novel interventions in clinical settings.",2019,10.1242/jeb.191353,222,6,NA,jeb191353,Mitochondria; Anoxia tolerance; Succinate; Brain; Shark; Oxygen
article,The thermal background determines how the infrared and visual systems interact in pit vipers,"Chen, Qin and Liu, Yang and Brauth, Steven E. and Fang, Guangzhan and Tang, Yezhong",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The thermal infrared (IR) sensing system of pit vipers is believed to complement vision and provide a substitute imaging system in dark environments. Theoretically, the IR system would best image a scene consisting of a homothermal target in cold surroundings as a bright spot on a dark background. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated how the pit viper (Gloydius brevicaudus) discriminates and strikes prey when the background temperature is either higher or lower than that of the prey (approximately 32-33 degrees C) in different parts of the scene. Snakes were tested in a modified predation cage in which background temperatures were set to 26 degrees C on one side and either 33 or 40 degrees C on the opposite side when the eyes, the pit organs or neither sensory system was occluded. When the eyes were blocked, snakes preferred to strike prey on the 26 degrees C side rather than on the 33 degrees C side but showed no bias in the other conditions. Snakes showed no preference for 26 versus 40 degrees C background temperature, although more missed strikes occurred when the eyes were occluded. The results thus revealed that the pit viper IR system can accomplish a `brightness constancy' computation reflecting the difference between the target and background temperatures, much as the visual system compares the luminance of a figure and the background. Furthermore, the results show that the IR system performs less well for locating prey when the background is warmer than the target.",2017,10.1242/jeb.155382,220,17,3103-3109,NA,Gloydius brevicaudus; Infrared sense; Predation behavior; Brightness constancy; Thermoregulation

This pattern should be more pronounced in tropical than in temperate species as protective mechanisms against chilling injuries are expected to be more effective in the latter. We initially determined the lower thermal thresholds to induce ovarian maturation in four closely related Drosophila species, two inhabiting temperate regions and the other two tropical areas of South America. As expected, only temperate species regularly experience cold-inducing conditions for reproductive arrest during winter in their natural environment. Subsequently, we exposed reproductively arrested and mature females to cold-inducing conditions for reproductive arrest over a long period. Following cold exposure, tropical species exhibited a dramatic fertility decline, irrespective of reproductive status. In contrast, not only were temperate females fecund and fertile but also fertility was superior in females that underwent cold-induced reproductive arrest, suggesting that it might act as a protecting mechanism ensuring fertility after cold recovery. Based on these findings, we decided to evaluate the extent to which reproductive status affects cold tolerance and energy metabolism at low temperature. We found a lower metabolic rate and a higher cold tolerance in reproductively arrested females, although only temperate species attained high levels of chill tolerance. These findings highlight the role of cold-induced reproductive arrest as part of an integrated mechanism of cold adaptation that could potentially contribute to the spread of temperate species into higher latitudes or altitudes.",2017,10.1242/jeb.150540,220,4,713-721,NA,Cold resistance; Insect; Metabolic rate; Ovarian arrest; Triglycerides; Overwintering
article,Effects of body size on the oxygen sensitivity of dragonfly flight,"Henry, Joanna Randyl and Harrison, Jon Fewell",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"One hypothesis for the small size of insects relative to vertebrates, and the existence of giant fossil insects, is that atmospheric oxygen levels constrain insect body sizes because oxygen delivery is more challenging in larger insects. This study tested this hypothesis in dragonflies by measuring the oxygen sensitivity of flight metabolic rates and behavior during hovering for 11 species of dragonflies that ranged in mass by an order of magnitude. We measured flight times and flight metabolic rates in seven oxygen concentrations ranging from 30\% to 2.5\% to assess the sensitivity of their flight to atmospheric oxygen. We also assessed the oxygen sensitivity of flight in low-density air (nitrogen replaced with helium) in order to increase the metabolic demands of hovering flight. Lowered atmospheric densities did induce higher flight metabolic rates. Flight behavior was more sensitive to decreasing oxygen levels than flight metabolic rate. The oxygen sensitivity of flight metabolic rates and behaviors were not correlated with body size, indicating that larger insects are able to maintain an oxygen supply-to-demand balance even during flight.",2014,10.1242/jeb.095828,217,19,3447-3456,NA,Dragonfly; Flight; Hyperoxia; Hypoxia; Insect; Respirometry
article,Individual variation in heat substitution: is activity in the cold energetically cheaper for some individuals than others?,"Maloney, Caroline and Careau, Vincent",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In many endotherms, a potentially important yet often overlooked mechanism to save energy is the use of the heat generated by active skeletal muscles to replace heat that would have been generated by thermogenesis (i.e. `activity-thermoregulatory heat substitution'). While substitution has been documented numerous times, the extent of individual variation in substitution has never been quantified. Here, we used a home-cage respirometry system to repeatedly measure substitution through the concomitant monitoring of metabolic rate (MR) and locomotor activity in 46 female white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus). A total of 117 measures of substitution were taken by quantifying the difference in the slope of the relationship between MR and locomotor activity speed at two different ambient temperatures. Consistency repeatability (+/- s.e.) of substitution was 0.313 (+/- 0.131); hence, about a third of the variation in substitution occurs at the among-individual level. Body length and heart mass were positively correlated with substitution whereas surface area was negatively correlated with substitution. These three sub-organismal traits accounted for the majority of the among-individual variation (i.e. individual differences in substitution were not significant after accounting for these traits). Overall, our results imply that the energetic cost of activity below the thermoneutral zone is consistently cheaper from some individuals than others, and that the energy saved from substitution might be available to invest in fitness-enhancing activities.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244186,225,18,NA,jeb244186,Activity-thermoregulatory heat substitution; Thermoregulation; Energy compensation; Repeatability

This environmental and genetic heterogeneity can substantially influence population and community resilience to disturbance events. Here, we investigated corals from the highly variable back-reef habitats of Ofu Island in American Samoa that thrive in thermal conditions known to elicit widespread bleaching and mortality elsewhere. To investigate the relative importance of acclimation versus site of origin in shaping previously observed differences in coral tolerance limits at Ofu Island, specimens of the common Indo-Pacific coral Porites lobata from locations with differing levels of thermal variability were acclimated to low and high thermal variation in controlled common garden aquaria. Overall, there were minimal effects of the acclimation exposure. Corals native to the site with the highest level of daily variability grew fastest, regardless of acclimation treatment. When exposed to lethal thermal stress, corals native to both variable sites contained elevated levels of heat shock proteins and maintained photosynthetic performance for 1-2 days longer than corals from the stable environment. Despite being separated by <5 km, there was significant genetic differentiation among coral colonies (F-ST=0.206, P<0.0001; nuclear ribosomal DNA), whereas Symbiodiniaceae were all Cladocopium sp.

article,Upper thermal limits of growth in brook trout and their relationship to stress physiology,"Chadwick, Joseph G. and McCormick, Stephen D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Despite the threat of climate change, the physiological mechanisms responsible for reduced performance at high temperatures remain unclear for most species. Elevated but sublethal temperatures may act via endocrine and cellular stress responses to limit performance in important life-history traits such as growth. Here, brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) subjected to chronically elevated or daily oscillating temperatures were monitored for growth and physiological stress responses. Growth rate decreased at temperatures above 16 degrees C and was negative at 24 degrees C, with an estimated upper limit for positive growth of 23.4 degrees C. Plasma cortisol increased with temperature and was 12- and 18-fold higher at 22 and 24 degrees C, respectively, than at 16 degrees C, whereas plasma glucose was unaffected by temperature. Abundance of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in the gill increased with temperature and was 11- and 56-fold higher at 22 degrees C and 24 degrees C, respectively, than at 16 degrees C. There was no relationship between temperature and plasma Cl-, but there was a 53\% and 80\% decrease in gill Na+/K+-ATPase activity and abundance at 24 degrees C in comparison with 16 degrees C. Daily temperature oscillations of 4 degrees C or 8 degrees C (19-23 degrees C or 17-25 degrees C) were compared with 21 degrees C controls. Growth rate decreased with temperature and was 43\% and 35\% lower by length and mass, respectively, in the 8 degrees C daily oscillation treatment than in the controls. There was no effect of temperature oscillation on plasma cortisol or glucose levels. In contrast, gill HSP70 abundance increased with increasing daily oscillation and was 40- and 700-fold greater at 4 degrees C and 8 degrees C daily oscillation, respectively, than in the constant temperature controls. In individuals exposed to 17-25 degrees C diel oscillations for 4 days and then allowed to recover at 21 degrees C, gill HSP70 abundance was still elevated after 4 days recovery, but not after 10 days. Our results demonstrate that elevated temperatures induce cellular and endocrine stress responses and provide a possible mechanism by which growth is limited at elevated temperatures.

article,A novel mechanism of mixing by pulsing corals,"Samson, Julia E. and Miller, Laura A. and Ray, Dylan and Holzman, Roi and Shavit, Uri and Khatri, Shilpa",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The dynamic pulsation of xeniid corals is one of the most fascinating phenomena observed in coral reefs. We quantify for the first time the flow near the tentacles of these soft corals, the active pulsations of which are thought to enhance their symbionts' photosynthetic rates by up to an order of magnitude. These polyps are approximately 1 cm in diameter and pulse at frequencies between approximately 0.5 and 1 Hz. As a result, the frequency-based Reynolds number calculated using the tentacle length and pulse frequency is on the order of 10 and rapidly decays as with distance from the polyp. This introduces the question of how these corals minimize the reversibility of the flow and bring in new volumes of fluid during each pulse. We estimate the Peclet number of the bulk flow generated by the coral as being on the order of 100-1000 whereas the flow between the bristles of the tentacles is on the order of 10. This illustrates the importance of advective transport in removing oxygen waste. Flow measurements using particle image velocimetry reveal that the individual polyps generate a jet of water with positive vertical velocities that do not go below 0.1 cm s(-1) and with average volumetric flow rates of approximately 0.71 cm(3) s(-1). Our results show that there is nearly continual flow in the radial direction towards the polyp with only approximately 3.3\% back flow. 3D numerical simulations uncover a region of slow mixing between the tentacles during expansion. We estimate that the average flow that moves through the bristles of the tentacles is approximately 0.03 cm s(-1). The combination of nearly continual flow towards the polyp, slow mixing between the bristles, and the subsequent ejection of this fluid volume into an upward jet ensures the polyp continually samples new water with sufficient time for exchange to occur.",2019,10.1242/jeb.192518,222,15,NA,jeb192518,Soft corals; Xeniidae; Biomechanics; Computational fluid dynamics; Lagrangian particle tracking

Modeling this behavior accurately poses unique challenges as behavior is controlled by both physiology and environmental cues. Some larvae use cilia to both swim and create feeding currents, resulting in potential trade-offs between the two functions. Food availability is naturally patchy and often occurs in shallow horizontal layers in the ocean. Also, larval swimming motions generally differ in the horizontal and vertical directions. In order to investigate behavioral response to food by ciliated larvae, we measured their behavioral anisotropy by quantifying deviations from a model based on isotropic diffusion. We hypothesized that larvae would increase horizontal swimming and decrease vertical swimming after encountering food, which could lead to aggregation at food layers. We considered Crepidula fomicata larvae, which are specifically of interest as they exhibit unsteady and variable swimming behaviors that are difficult to categorize. We tracked the larvae in still water with and without food, with a portion of the larvae starved beforehand. On average, larvae in the presence of food were observed higher in the water column, with higher swimming speeds and higher horizontal swimming velocities when compared with larvae without food. Starved larvae also exhibited higher vertical velocities in food, suggesting no aggregation behavior. Although most treatments showed strong anisotropy in larval behavior, we found that starved larvae without food exhibited approximately isotropic kinematics, indicating that behavioral anisotropy can vary with environmental history and conditions to enhance foraging success or mitigate food-poor environments.",2021,10.1242/jeb.239178,224,2,NA,jeb239178,Zooplankton swimming; Invertebrate larvae; Foraging

We tested this hypothesis using intermittent flow respirometry to measure AS at, above (+2.5 degrees C) and below (-2.5 degrees C) the self-selected, preferred temperature (T-pref) of individual zebrafish (Danio rerio). AS was greatest 2.5 degrees C above T-pref, which was driven by an increase in maximal metabolic rate.

article,Overwintering in North American domesticated honeybees (<i>Apis</i> <i>mellifera</i>) causes mitochondrial reprogramming while enhancing cellular immunity,"Cormier, Simon B. and Leger, Adele and Boudreau, Luc H. and Pichaud, Nicolas",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Many factors negatively affect domesticated honeybee (Apis mellifera) health, causing a global decrease in their population year after year with major losses occurring during winter, and the cause remains unknown. Here, we monitored for 12 months North American colonies of honeybees enduring important temperature variations throughout the year, to assess the metabolism and immune system of summer and winter honeybee individuals. Our results show that in flight muscle, mitochondrial respiration via complex I during winter is drastically reduced compared with summer. However, the capacity for succinate and glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) oxidation by mitochondria is increased during winter, resulting in higher mitochondrial oxygen consumption when complex I substrates, succinate and G3P were assessed altogether. Pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, citrate synthase and malate dehydrogenase tend to have reduced activity levels in winter, unlike hexokinase, NADH dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase. Transcript abundance of highly important immunity proteins such as Vitellogenin and Defensin-1 were also increased in winter bees, and a stronger phagocytic response as well as a better hemocyte viability was observed during winter. Thus, a reorganization of substrate utilization favoring succinate and G3P while negatively affecting complex I of the ETS is occurring during winter. We suggest that this might be due to complex I transitioning to a dormant conformation through post-translational modification. Winter bees also have an increased response for antibacterial elimination. Overall, this study highlights previously unknown cellular mechanisms between summer and winter honeybees that further our knowledge about this important species.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244440,225,16,NA,jeb244440,Metabolism; Seasonal transition; Immune system; Phagocytosis; Substrate oxidation

Whereas small heterothermic mammals can employ torpor to save energy in the cold, homeothermic species must increase heat production to defend normothermia through the recruitment of brown adipose tissue (BAT). Here, we studied thermoregulatory adaptation in an obligate homeotherm, the African striped mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio), captured from a subpopulation living in a mesic, temperate climate with marked seasonal differences. Basal metabolic rate (BMR), nonshivering thermogenesis (NST) and summit metabolic rate (M-sum) increased from summer to winter, with NST and M-sum already reaching maximal rates in autumn, suggesting seasonal preparation for the cold. Typical of rodents, cold-induced metabolic rates were positively correlated with BAT mass. Analysis of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity and UCP1 content, however, demonstrated that thermogenic capacity declined with BAT mass. This resulted in seasonal differences in NST being driven by changes in BMR. The increase in BMR was supported by a comprehensive anatomical analysis of metabolically active organs, revealing increased mass proportions in the cold season. The thermoregulatory response of R. pumilio was associated with the maintenance of body mass throughout the year (48.3 +/- 1.4 g), contrasting large summer-winter mass reductions often observed in Holarctic rodents. Collectively. bioenergetic adaptation of this Afrotropical rodent involves seasonal organ adjustments influencing BMR, combined with a constant thermogenic capacity dictated by trade-offs in the thermogenic properties of BAT. Arguably, this high degree of plasticity was a response to unpredictable cold spells throughout the year. Consequently, the reliance on such a resource-intensive thermoregulatory strategy may expose more energetic vulnerability in changing environments of food scarcity and extreme weather conditions due to climate change, with major ramifications for survival of the species.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243860,225,13,NA,jeb243860,Seasonality; Basal metabolism; Non-shivering thermogenesis; Summit metabolism; Phenotypic plasticity
article,Reduced immune responsiveness contributes to winter energy conservation in an Arctic bird,"Nord, Andreas and Hegemann, Arne and Folkow, Lars P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Animals in seasonal environments must prudently manage energy expenditure to survive the winter. This may be achieved through reductions in the allocation of energy for various purposes (e.g. thermoregulation, locomotion, etc.). We studied whether such trade-offs also include suppression of the innate immune response, by subjecting captive male Svalbard ptarmigan (Lagopus muta hyperborea) to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) during exposure to either mild temperature (0 degrees C) or cold snaps (acute exposure to -20 degrees C), in constant winter darkness when birds were in energy-conserving mode, and in constant daylight in spring. The innate immune response was mostly unaffected by temperature. However, energy expenditure was below baseline when birds were immune challenged in winter, but significantly above baseline in spring. This suggests that the energetic component of the innate immune response was reduced in winter, possibly contributing to energy conservation. Immunological parameters decreased (agglutination, lysis, bacteriostatic capacity) or did not change (haptoglobin/PIT54) after the challenge, and behavioural modifications (anorexia, mass loss) were lengthy (9 days). While we did not study the mechanisms explaining these weak, or slow, responses, it is tempting to speculate they may reflect the consequences of having evolved in an environment where pathogen transmission rate is presumably low for most of the year. This is an important consideration if climate change and increased exploitation of the Arctic would alter pathogen communities at a pace outwith counter-adaption in wildlife.",2020,10.1242/jeb.219287,223,8,NA,jeb219287,Acute-phase response; Arctic; Body temperature; Fever; Innate immunity; Thermoregulation
article,"Enzyme polymorphism, oxygen and injury: a lipidomic analysis of flight-induced oxidative damage in a <i>succinate dehydrogenase d</i> (<i>Sdhd</i>)-polymorphic insect","Pekny, Julianne E. and Smith, Philip B. and Marden, James H.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"When active tissues receive insufficient oxygen to meet metabolic demand, succinate accumulates and has two fundamental effects: it causes ischemia-reperfusion injury while also activating the hypoxia-inducible factor pathway (HIF). The Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) possesses a balanced polymorphism in Sdhd, shown previously to affect HIF pathway activation and tracheal morphology and used here to experimentally test the hypothesis that variation in succinate dehydrogenase affects oxidative injury. We stimulated butterflies to fly continuously in a respirometer (3 min duration), which typically caused episodes of exhaustion and recovery, suggesting a potential for cellular injury from hypoxia and reoxygenation in flight muscles. Indeed, flight muscle from butterflies flown on consecutive days had lipidome profiles similar to those of rested paraquat-injected butterflies, but distinct from those of rested untreated butterflies. Many butterflies showed a decline in flight metabolic rate (FMR) on day 2, and there was a strong inverse relationship between the ratio of day 2 to day 1 FMR and the abundance of sodiated adducts of phosphatidylcholines and coenzyme Q (CoQ). This result is consistent with elevation of sodiated lipids caused by disrupted intracellular ion homeostasis in mammalian tissues after hypoxia-reperfusion. Butterflies carrying the Sdhd M allele had a higher abundance of lipid markers of cellular damage, but the association was reversed in field-collected butterflies, where focal individuals typically flew for seconds at a time rather than continuously. These results indicate that Glanville fritillary flight muscles can be injured by episodes of high exertion, but injury severity appears to be determined by an interaction between SDH genotype and behavior (prolonged versus intermittent flight).",2018,10.1242/jeb.171009,221,6,NA,jeb171009,Succinate dehydrogenase; Complex II; Sodiated lipid; Oxidative damage; Hypoxia; Muscle
article,Flight metabolic rate of <i>Locusta migratoria</i> in relation to oxygen partial pressure in atmospheres of varying diffusivity and density,"Snelling, Edward P. and Duncker, Rebecca and Jones, Karl K. and Fagan-Jeffries, Erinn P. and Seymour, Roger S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Flying insects have the highest mass-specific metabolic rate of all animals. Oxygen is supplied to the flight muscles by a combination of diffusion and convection along the internal air-filled tubes of the tracheal system. This study measured maximum flight metabolic rate (FMR) during tethered flight in the migratory locust Locusta migratoria under varying oxygen partial pressure (P-O2) in background gas mixtures of nitrogen (N-2), sulfur hexafluoride (F-6) and helium (He), to vary O-2 diffusivity and gas mixture density independently. With N-2 as the sole background gas (normodiffusive-normodense), mass-independent FMR averaged 132 +/- 19 mW g-0.75 at normoxia (PO2 = 21 kPa), and was not limited by tracheal system conductance, because FMR did not increase in hyperoxia. However, FMR declined immediately with hypoxia, oxy-conforming nearly completely. Thus, the locust respiratory system is matched to maximum functional requirements, with little reserve capacity. With SF6 as the sole background gas (hypodiffusive-hyperdense), the shape of the relationship between FMR and PO2 was similar to that in N-2, except that FMR was generally lower (e.g. 24\% lower at normoxia). This appeared to be due to increased density of the gas mixture rather than decreased O-2 diffusivity, because hyperoxia did not reverse it. Normoxic FMR was not significantly different in He-SF6 (hyperdiffusive-normodense) compared with the N-2 background gas, and likewise there was no significant difference between FMR in SF6-He (normodiffusive-hyperdense) compared with the SF6 background gas. The results indicate that convection, not diffusion, is the main mechanism of O-2 delivery to the flight muscle of the locust when demand is high.",2017,10.1242/jeb.168187,220,23,4432-4439,NA,Convection; Critical P-O2; Diffusion; Tracheal system; Locust; Regulation index

Additionally, temperature-induced hormone-mediated stress response pathways and energetic tradeoffs are important drivers of life-history variation. This study employs an integrative approach to quantify acute physiological responses to high temperatures in divergent life-history ecotypes of the western terrestrial garter snake (Thamnophis elegans). Using wild-caught animals, we measured oxygen consumption rate and physiological markers of hormonal stress response, energy availability and anaerobic respiration in blood plasma across five ecologically relevant temperatures (24, 28, 32, 35 and 38 degrees C; 3 h exposure). Corticosterone, insulin and glucose concentrations all increased with temperature, but with different thermal response curves, suggesting that high temperatures differently affect energy-regulation pathways. Additionally, oxygen consumption rate increased without plateau and lactate concentration did not increase with temperature, challenging the recent hypothesis that oxygen limitation sets upper thermal tolerance limits. Finally, animals had similar physiological thermal responses to high-temperature exposure regardless of genetic background, suggesting that local adaptation has not resulted in fixed differences between ecotypes.

Far less is known about Msum and metabolic expansibility {[}ME, the ratio of Msum to basal metabolic rate (BMR)] in bats compared with many other endotherm taxa. We measured BMR and Msum during winter and summer in captive and wild populations of a pteropodid from the southern subtropics, Wahlberg's epauletted fruit bat (Epomophorus wahlbergi) in Pretoria, South Africa. The Msum of fruit bats ranged from 5.178 +/- 0.611 W (captive, summer) to 6.006 +/- 0.890 W (captive, winter), and did not vary significantly between seasons. In contrast, BMR decreased by 17-25\% in winter. The combination of seasonally stable Msum but flexible BMR resulted in ME being significantly higher in winter than in summer, ranging from 7.24 +/- 1.49 (wild, summer) to 13.11 +/- 2.14 (captive, winter). The latter value is well above the typical mammalian range. Moreover, both Msum and ME were significantly higher in captive bats than in wild individuals; we speculate this represents a phenotypic response to a reduction in exercise-associated heat production while in captivity. Our data for E. wahlbergi, combined with those currently available for other chiropterans, reveal that Msum in bats is highly variable compared with allometrically expected values for other mammals.",2014,10.1242/jeb.098400,217,8,1363-1369,NA,Acclimatisation; Cold exposure; Helox; Phenotypic flexibility; Thermogenic capacity

Whales and dolphins can execute aerial leaps by swimming rapidly to the water surface to achieve an escape velocity. Previous research on spinner dolphins demonstrated the capability of leaping and completing multiple spins around their longitudinal axis with high angular velocities. This prior research suggested the slender body morphology of spinner dolphins together with the shapes and positions of their appendages allowed for rapid spins in the air. To test whether greater moments of inertia reduced spinning performance, videos and biologging data of cetaceans above and below the water surface were obtained. The principal factors affecting the number of aerial spins a cetacean can execute were moment of inertia and use of control surfaces for subsurface corkscrewing. For spinner dolphin, Pacific striped dolphin, bottlenose dolphin, minke whale and humpback whale, each with swim speeds of 6-7ms-1, our model predicted that the number of aerial spins executable was 7, 2, 2, 0.76 and 1, respectively, which was consistent with observations. These data implied that the rate of subsurface corkscrewing was limited to 14.0, 6.8, 6.2, 2.2 and 0.75 rad s-1 for spinner dolphins, striped dolphins, bottlenose dolphins, minke whales and humpback whales, respectively. In our study, the moment of inertia of the cetaceans spanned a 21,000-fold range.

Here, we reveal how A. japonicus ingests suspended particles through the mouth. We used synthetic particles and video recording to confirm the suspension uptake by the sea cucumber. Apostichopus japonicus continued to ingest suspended particles (if present) over time, and the particle ingestion rate was positively correlated with the concentration of suspended particles (Pearson correlation: r=0.808). Additionally, clearance rates of the suspended particles ranged from 0.3 to 0.9 vertical bar h(-1).

article,Seasonal energetics: are insects constrained by energy during dormancy?,"Roberts, Kevin T. and Szejner-Sigal, Andre and Lehmann, Philipp",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In seasonal environments, many animals, including insects, enter dormancy, where they are limited to a fixed energy budget. The inability to replenish energetic stores during these periods suggests insects should be constrained by pre-dormancy energy stores. Over the last century, the community of researchers working on survival during dormancy has operated under the strong assumption that energy limitation is a key fitness trait driving the evolution of seasonal strategies. That is, energy use has to be minimized during dormancy because insects otherwise run out of energy and die during dormancy, or are left with too little energy to complete development, reproductive maturation or other costly post-dormancy processes such as dispersal or nest building. But if energy is so strongly constrained during dormancy, how can some insects - even within the same species and population - be dormant in very warm environments or show prolonged dormancy for many successive years? In this Commentary, we discuss major assumptions regarding dormancy energetics and outline cases where insects appear to align with our assumptions and where they do not. We then highlight several research directions that could help link organismal energy use with landscape-level changes. Overall, the optimal energetic strategy during dormancy might not be to simply minimize metabolic rate, but instead to maintain a level that matches the demands of the specific life-history strategy. Given the influence of temperature on energy use rates of insects in winter, understanding dormancy energetic strategies is critical in order to determine the potential impacts of climate change on insects in seasonal environments.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245782,226,21,NA,jeb245782,Seasonality; Energetics; Ecophysiology; Diapause; Fitness
article,The roles of brain lipids and polar metabolites in the hypoxia tolerance of deep-diving pinnipeds,"Martens, Gerrit A. and Gessner, Cornelia and Folkow, Lars P. and Creydt, Marina and Fischer, Markus and Burmester, Thorsten",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Lipids make up more than half of the human brain's dry weight, yet the composition and function of the brain lipidome is not well characterized. Lipids not only provide the structural basis of cell membranes, but also take part in a wide variety of biochemical processes. In neurodegenerative diseases, lipids can facilitate neuroprotection and serve as diagnostic biomarkers. The study of organisms adapted to extreme environments may prove particularly valuable in understanding mechanisms that protect against stressful conditions and prevent neurodegeneration. The brain of the hooded seal (Cystophora cristata) exhibits a remarkable tolerance to low tissue oxygen levels (hypoxia). While neurons of most terrestrial mammals suffer irreversible damage after only short periods of hypoxia, in vitro experiments show that neurons of the hooded seal display prolonged functional integrity even in severe hypoxia. How the brain lipidome contributes to the hypoxia tolerance of marine mammals has been poorly studied. We performed an untargeted lipidomics analysis, which revealed that lipid species are significantly modulated in marine mammals compared with non-diving mammals. Increased levels of sphingomyelin species may have important implications for efficient signal transduction in the seal brain. Substrate assays also revealed elevated normoxic tissue levels of glucose and lactate, which suggests an enhanced glycolytic capacity. Additionally, concentrations of the neurotransmitters glutamate and glutamine were decreased, which may indicate reduced excitatory synaptic signaling in marine mammals. Analysis of hypoxia-exposed brain tissue suggests that these represent constitutive mechanisms rather than an induced response towards hypoxic conditions.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245355,226,8,NA,jeb245355,Lipidome; Hypoxia; Oxidative stress; Marine mammals; Pinniped; Brain

Here, we exposed coral explants to acute thermal stress and measured oxidative stress, more specifically, reactive oxygen species (ROS), in individual symbiont cells.

article,Evidence for a role of heme oxygenase-1 in the control of cardiac function in zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) larvae exposed to hypoxia,"Tzaneva, Velislava and Perry, Steve F.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Carbon monoxide (CO) is a gaseous neurotransmitter produced from the breakdown of heme via heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1; hypoxia-inducible isoform) and heme oxygenase-2 (HO-2; constitutively expressed isoform). In mammals, CO is involved in modulating cardiac function. The role of the HO-1/CO system in the control of heart function in fish, however, is unknown and investigating its physiological function in lower vertebrates will provide a better understanding of the evolution of this regulatory mechanism. We explored the role of the HO-1/CO system in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) in vivo by investigating the impact of translational gene knockdown of HO-1 on cardiac function. Immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of HO-1 in the pacemaker cells of the heart at 4 days post-fertilization and thus the potential for CO production at these sites. Sham-treated zebrafish larvae (experiencing normal levels of HO-1) significantly increased heart rate (f(H)) when exposed to hypoxia (Pw(O2) = 30 mmHg). Zebrafish larvae lacking HO-1 expression after morpholino knockdown (morphants) exhibited significantly higher f(H) under normoxic (but not hypoxic) conditions when compared with sham-treaded fish. The increased f(H) in HO-1 morphants was rescued (f(H) was restored to control levels) after treatment of larvae with a CO-releasing molecule (40 mu mol l(-1) CORM). The HO-1-deficient larvae developed significantly larger ventricles and when exposed to hypoxia they displayed higher cardiac output ((Q)) over dot and stroke volume (SV). These results suggest that under hypoxic conditions, HO-1 regulates (Q) over dot and SV presumably via the production of CO. Overall, this study provides a better understanding of the role of the HO-1/CO system in controlling heart function in lower vertebrates. We demonstrate for the first time the ability for CO to be produced in presumptive pacemaker cells of the heart where it plays an inhibitory role in setting the resting cardiac frequency.",2016,10.1242/jeb.136853,219,10,1563-1571,NA,Heart size; Carbon monoxide; Heart rate; Pacemaker cells

Biochemical studies on acclimation responses in ectotherms have so far mainly investigated consequences of short-term acclimation at the adult stage and focussed on adaptive responses. Here, we assessed the consequences of rearing Drosophila melanogaster at low (12 degrees C), benign (25 degrees C) and high (31 degrees C) temperatures. We assessed cold and heat tolerance and obtained detailed proteomic profiles of flies from the three temperatures. The proteomic profiles provided a holistic understanding of the underlying biology associated with both adaptive and non-adaptive temperature responses. Results show strong benefits and costs across tolerances: rearing at low temperature increased adult cold tolerance and decreased adult heat tolerance and vice versa with development at high temperatures. In the proteomic analysis, we were able to identify and quantify a large number of proteins compared with previous studies on ectotherms (1440 proteins across all replicates and rearing regimes), enabling us to extend the proteomic approach using enrichment analyses. This gave us detailed information on individual proteins, as well as pathways affected by rearing temperature, pinpointing potential mechanisms responsible for the strong costs and benefits of rearing temperature on functional phenotypes. Several well-known heat shock proteins, as well as proteins not previously associated with thermal stress, were among the differentially expressed proteins. Upregulation of proteasome proteins was found to be an important adaptive process at high-stress rearing temperatures, and occurs at the expense of downregulation of basal metabolic functions.",2016,10.1242/jeb.132696,219,7,969-976,NA,Acclimation; Heat and cold stress; Heat shock proteins; Metabolism; Proteasome; Proteomics
article,Thyroid hormone regulates muscle function during cold acclimation in zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>),"Little, Alexander G. and Seebacher, Frank",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Thyroid hormone (TH) is a universal regulator of growth, development and metabolism during cold exposure in mammals. In zebrafish (Danio rerio), TH regulates locomotor performance and metabolism during cold acclimation. The influence of TH on locomotor performance may be via its effect on metabolism or, as has been shown in mammals, by modulating muscle phenotypes. Our aim was to determine whether TH influences muscle phenotypes in zebrafish, and whether this could explain changes in swimming capacity in response to thermal acclimation. We used propylthiouracil and iopanoic acid to induce hypothyroidism in zebrafish over a 3-week acclimation period to either 18 or 28 degrees C. To verify that physiological changes following hypothyroid treatment were in fact due to the action of TH, we supplemented hypothyroid fish with 3,5-diiodothryronine (T-2) or 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T-3). Cold-acclimated fish had significantly greater sustained swimming performance (U-crit) but not burst speed. Greater U-crit was accompanied by increased tail beat frequency, but there was no change in tail beat amplitude. Hypothyroidism significantly decreased U-crit and burst performance, as well as tail beat frequency and SERCA activity in cold-acclimated fish. However, myofibrillar ATPase activity increased in cold-acclimated hypothyroid fish. Hypothyroid treatment also decreased mRNA concentrations of myosin heavy chain fast isoforms and SERCA 1 isoform in cold-acclimated fish. SERCA 1 mRNA increased in warm-acclimated hypothyroid fish, and SERCA 3 mRNA decreased in both cold-and warm-acclimated hypothyroid fish. Supplementation with either T-2 or T-3 restored U-crit, burst speed, tail beat frequency, SERCA activity and myosin heavy chain and SERCA 1 and 3 mRNA levels of hypothyroid fish back to control levels. We show that in addition to regulating development and metabolism in vertebrates, TH also regulates muscle physiology in ways that affect locomotor performance in fish. We suggest that the role of TH in modulating SERCA1 expression during cold exposure may have predisposed it to regulate endothermic thermogenesis.",2013,10.1242/jeb.089136,216,18,3514-3521,NA,"swimming performance; SERCA; myofibrillar ATPase; 3,5-diiodothryronine; T-2; 3,5,3 `-triiodothyronine; T-3"

These moderate heat stress effects are typically more pronounced in males. In some species, sperm production, quality and motility are the primary cause of male infertility during moderate heat stress. However, this is not the case in the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, where changes in mating behavior are the primary cause of fertility loss. We report that heat-stressed C. elegans males are more motivated to locate and remain on food and less motivated to leave food to find and mate with hermaphrodites than their unstressed counterparts. Heat-stressed males also demonstrate a reduction in motility that likely limits their ability to mate. Collectively these changes result in a dramatic reduction in reproductive success. The reduction in mate-searching behavior may be partially due to increased expression of the chemoreceptor odr-10 in the AWA sensory neurons, which is a marker for starvation in males. These results demonstrate that moderate heat stress may have profound and previously underappreciated effects on reproductive behaviors. As climate change continues to raise global temperatures, it will be imperative to understand how moderate heat stress affects behavioral and motility elements critical to reproduction.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245546,226,20,NA,jeb245546,Caenorhabditis elegans; Temperature stress; Male fertility; Male behavior; Decision making

Specifically, temperature can affect locomotor capabilities, especially as species are exposed to temperatures nearing their thermal limits. In this study, we aimed to understand the effects of temperature on muscle in two labrids that occupy the Northwest Atlantic Ocean. When exposed to cold temperatures in autumn, cunner (Tautogolabrus adspersus) and tautog (Tautoga onitis) go into a state of winter dormancy. Transitions into dormancy vary slightly, where tautog will make short migrations to overwintering habitats while cunner overwinter in year-round habitats. To understand how muscle function changes with temperature, we held fish for 4 weeks at either 5 or 20 degrees C and then ran muscle kinetic and workloop experiments at 5,10 and 20 degrees C. Following experiments, we used immunohistochemistry staining to identify acclimation effects on myosin isoform expression. Muscle taken from warm-acclimated cunner performed the best, whereas there were relatively few differences among the other three groups. Gunner acclimated at both temperatures downregulated the myosin heavy chain, suggesting a transition in fiber type from slow-oxidative to fast-glycolytic. This change did not amount to a detectable difference in muscle power production and kinetics. However, overall poor performance at cold temperatures could force these fishes into torpor to overwinter. Tautog, alternatively, retained myosin heavy chains, which likely increases locomotor capabilities when making short migrations to overwintering habitats.",2020,10.1242/jeb.235226,223,24,NA,jeb235226,Kinetics; Wrasse; Pectoral fin; Swimming; Kinetics; Abductor superficialis; Locomotion; Torpor
article,Elucidating mechanisms for insect body size: partial support for the oxygen-dependent induction of moulting hypothesis,"Kivela, Sami M. and Viinamaki, Sonja and Keret, Netta and Gotthard, Karl and Hohtola, Esa and Valimaki, Panu",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Body size is a key life history trait, and knowledge of its mechanistic basis is crucial in life history biology. Such knowledge is accumulating for holometabolous insects, whose growth is characterised and body size affected by moulting. According to the oxygen-dependent induction of moulting (ODIM) hypothesis, moult is induced at a critical mass at which oxygen demand of growing tissues overrides the supply from the tracheal respiratory system, which principally grows only at moults. Support for the ODIM hypothesis is controversial, partly because of a lack of proper data to explicitly test the hypothesis. The ODIM hypothesis predicts that the critical mass is positively correlated with oxygen partial pressure (P-O2) and negatively with temperature. To resolve the controversy that surrounds the ODIM hypothesis, we rigorously test these predictions by exposing penultimate-instar Orthosia gothica (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) larvae to temperature and moderate P-O2 manipulations in a factorial experiment. The relative mass increment in the focal instar increased along with increasing P-O2, as predicted, but there was only weak suggestive evidence of the temperature effect. Probably owing to a high measurement error in the trait, the effect of P-O2 on the critical mass was sex specific; high P-O2 had a positive effect only in females, whereas low P-O2 had a negative effect only in males. Critical mass was independent of temperature. Support for the ODIM hypothesis is partial because of only suggestive evidence of a temperature effect on moulting, but the role of oxygen in moult induction seems unambiguous. The ODIM mechanism thus seems worth considering in body size analyses.",2018,10.1242/jeb.166157,221,2,NA,jeb166157,Critical mass; Growth rate; Hyperoxia; Hypoxia; Larval instars; Orthosia gothica

Levels of ubiquitin (Ub)-conjugated proteins, 20S proteasome activity and mRNA expression of many proteins involved in both the Ub tagging of damaged proteins as well as the different complexes of the 26S proteasome were measured to examine whether there is thermal compensation of the Ub-proteasome pathway in Antarctic fishes to better understand the efficiency of the protein degradation machinery in polar species. Both Antarctic (Trematomus bernacchii, Pagothenia borchgrevinki) and non-Antarctic (Notothenia angustata, Bovichtus variegatus) notothenioids were included in this study to investigate the mechanisms of cold adaptation of this pathway in polar species. Overall, there were significant differences in the levels of Ub-conjugated proteins between the Antarctic notothenioids and B. variegatus, with N. angustata possessing levels very similar to those of the Antarctic fishes. Proteasome activity in the gills of Antarctic fishes demonstrated a high degree of temperature compensation such that activity levels were similar to activitiesmeasured in their temperate relatives at ecologically relevant temperatures. A similar level of thermal compensation of proteasome activity was not present in the liver of two Antarctic fishes. Higher gill proteasome activity is likely due in part to higher cellular levels of proteins involved in the Ub-proteasome pathway, as evidenced by high mRNA expression of relevant genes. Reduced activity of the Ub-proteasome pathway does not appear to be the mechanism responsible for elevated levels of denatured proteins in Antarctic fishes, at least in the gills.",2017,10.1242/jeb.145946,220,3,369-378,NA,Antarctic fish; Protein homeostasis; Ub-proteasome pathway; Cold adaptation; Notothenioid

Once crayfish had habituated their defensive response to a specific water jet, we tested whether habituation transferred to a new type of water jet. Although habituation did not generalize when the new stimulus was initially presented, it surprisingly emerged 15 and 45 days later.

Hair bundles on sea anemone tentacles detect nearby vibrations in the water column produced by prey movements and then regulate discharge of cnidae to capture prey. This study investigated: (1) the progressive effects of periodic water flow on hair bundle morphology and density of hair bundles and cnidae in sea anemones, (2) the reversibility of the flow response and (3) the ability of the response to be expedited with increased flow duration. Linear density of hair bundles along tentacles and each hair bundle's dimensions was measured in anemones exposed to flow and in the absence of flow. With increasing numbers of days of flow, hair bundles in anemones exposed to flow for 1 h every weekday for 20 days increased in density and grew longer and wider at bases and middles, whereas controls did not. Time courses fit to a linear function exhibited significantly larger positive slopes from animals exposed to flow compared with controls. Hair bundles in anemones exposed to flow for 3 h each day increased in linear density, length, base width and middle width after 10 days of flow and returned to control levels after 10 days following cessation of flow. In addition, there was a trend for an increase in density of cnidae with flow. Therefore, anemone hair bundles are dynamically and reversibly modified by periodic, moderate flow to become more abundant and robust. These findings may have relevance to hair cells in acoustico-lateralis systems of higher animals.",2018,10.1242/jeb.181081,221,24,NA,jeb181081,Anemone; Cnidae; Phenotypic plasticity; Hair cell; Mechanoreceptor
article,Adenosine and γ-aminobutyric acid partially regulate metabolic and ventilatory responses of Damaraland mole-rats to acute hypoxia,"Devereaux, Maiah E. M. and Pamenter, Matthew E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Fossorial Damaraland mole-rats (Fukomys damarensis) mount a robust hypoxic metabolic response (HMR) but a blunted hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) to acute hypoxia. Although these reflex physiological responses have been described previously, the underlying signalling pathways are entirely unknown. Of particular interest are contributions from gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the nervous system of most adult mammals, and adenosine, the accumulation of which increases during hypoxia as a breakdown product of ATP. Therefore, we hypothesized that GABAergic and/or adenosinergic signalling contributes to the blunted HVR and robust HMR in Damaraland mole-rats. To test this hypothesis, we injected adult animals with saline alone (controls), or 100 mg kg-1 aminophylline or 1 mg kg-1 bicuculline, to block adenosine or GABAA receptors, respectively. We then used respirometry, plethysmography and thermal RFID probes to non-invasively measure metabolic, ventilator and thermoregulatory responses, respectively, to acute hypoxia (1 h in 5 or 7\% O2) in awake and freely behaving animals. We found that bicuculline had relatively minor effects on metabolism and thermoregulation but sensitized ventilation such that the HVR became manifest at 7\% instead of 5\% O2 and was greater in magnitude. Aminophylline increased metabolic rate, ventilation and body temperature in normoxia, and augmented the HMR and HVR. Taken together, these findings indicate that adenosinergic and GABAergic signalling play important roles in mediating the robust HMR and blunted HVR in Damaraland mole-rats.",2023,10.1242/jeb.246186,226,19,NA,jeb246186,Adenosine receptors; GABA receptors; Bicuculline; Aminophylline; Hypoxic ventilatory response; Thermoregulation; Metabolic suppression
article,Thermal stress induces tissue damage and a broad shift in regenerative signaling pathways in the honey bee digestive tract,"Bach, Dunay M. and Holzman, Miriam A. and Wague, Fatoumata and Miranda, Jj L. and Lopatkin, Allison J. and Mansfield, Jennifer H. and Snow, Jonathan W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Honey bee colonies in the USA have suffered from increased die-off in the last few years with a complex set of interacting stresses playing a key role. With changing climate, an increase in the frequency of severe weather events, such as heat waves, is anticipated. Understanding how these changes may contribute to stress in honey bees is crucial. Individual honey bees appear to have a high capacity to endure thermal stress. One reason for this high-level endurance is likely their robust heat shock response (HSR), which contributes to thermotolerance at the cellular level. However, less is known about other mechanisms of thermotolerance, especially those operating at the tissue level. To elucidate other determinants of resilience in this species. we used thermal stress coupled with RNAseq and identified broad transcriptional remodeling of a number of key signaling pathways in the honey bee, including those pathways known to be involved in digestive tract regeneration in the fruit fly such as the Hippo and JAK/STAT pathways. We also observed cell death and shedding of epithelial cells, which likely leads to induction of this regenerative transcriptional program. We found that thermal stress affects many of these pathways in other tissues, suggesting a shared program of damage response. This study provides important foundational characterization of the tissue damage response program in this key pollinating species. In addition, our data suggest that a robust regeneration program may also be a critical contributor to thermotolerance at the tissue level, a possibility which warrants further exploration in this and other species.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242262,224,18,NA,jeb242262,Apis mellifera; Heat shock response; Hippo pathway; JAK/STAT pathway; Proteostasis; Regeneration; Thermotolerance
article,Does the New Zealand rockwren (<i>Xenicus gilviventris</i>) hibernate?,"McNab, Brian K. and Weston, Kerry A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In this study, we examined the thermal physiology of the endangered New Zealand rockwren (Xenicus gilviventris), a member of the Acanthisittidae, a family unique to New Zealand. This family, derived from Gondwana, is thought to be the sister taxon to all other passerines. Rockwrens permanently reside above the climatic timberline at altitudes from 1000 to 2900 m in the mountains of South Island. They feed on invertebrates and in winter face ambient temperatures far below freezing and deep deposits of snow. Their body temperature and rate of metabolism are highly variable. The rockwrens in our study regulated their body temperature at ca. 36.4 degrees C, which in one individual decreased to 33.1 degrees C at an ambient temperature of 9.4 degrees C; its rate of metabolism decreased by 30\% and its body temperature then spontaneously returned to 36 degrees C. The rate of metabolism in a second individual twice decreased by 35\%, nearly to the basal rate expected from its mass without a decrease in body temperature. The New Zealand rockwren's food habits, entrance into torpor and continuous residence in a thermally demanding environment suggest that it may hibernate. However, for that conclusion to be accepted, evidence of its use of torpor for extended periods is required. Acanthisittids are distinguished from other passerines by the combination of their permanent temperate distribution, thermal flexibility and a propensity to evolve a flightless condition. These characteristics may principally reflect their geographical isolation in a temperate environment isolated from Gondwana for 82 million years in the absence of mammalian predators.",2020,10.1242/jeb.212126,223,9,NA,jeb212126,Acanthisittidae; Flightless condition; Gondwana; Poor-will; Rifleman; Torpor
article,Transforming growth factor-β1 induces differentiation of rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts,"Johnston, Elizabeth F. and Gillis, Todd E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The collagen content of the rainbow trout heart increases in response to cold acclimation and decreases with acclimation to warm temperatures. This ability to remodel the myocardial extracellular matrix (ECM) makes these fish useful models to study the cellular pathways involved in collagen regulation in the vertebrate heart. Remodelling of the ECM in the mammalian heart is regulated, in part, by myofibroblasts which arise from pre-existing fibroblasts in response to transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1). We have previously demonstrated that treatment of cultured rainbow trout cardiac fibroblasts with human TGF-beta 1 causes an increase in collagen production. Here, we showed that repetitive treatment of rainbow trout cardiac fibroblasts with a physiologically relevant concentration of human recombinant TGF-beta 1 results in a similar to 29-fold increase in phosphorylated small mothers against decapentaplegic 2 (pSmad2); a 2.9-fold increase in vinculin protein, a 1.2-fold increase in cellular size and a 3-fold increase in filamentous actin (F-actin). These are common markers of the transition of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. Cells treated with TGF-beta 1 also had highly organized cytoskeletal alpha-smooth muscle actin, as well as increased transcript abundances of mmp-9, timp-2 and col1a1. Furthermore, using gelatin zymography, we demonstrated that TGF-beta 1 treatment causes a 5.3-fold increase in gelatinase activity. Together, these results suggest that trout cardiac fibroblasts have the capacity to differentiate into myofibroblasts and that this cell type can increase extracellular collagen tumover via gelatinase activity. Cardiac myofibroblasts are, therefore, likely involved in the remodelling of the cardiac ECM in the trout heart during thermal acclimation.",2018,10.1242/jeb.189167,221,24,NA,jeb189167,Cardiac remodelling; Extracellular matrix; Phenotypic plasticity; TGF-beta 1
article,Heat dissipation does not suppress an immune response in laboratory mice divergently selected for basal metabolic rate (BMR),"Ksiazek, Aneta and Konarzewski, Marek",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The capacity for heat dissipation is considered to be one of the most important constraints on rates of energy expenditure in mammals. To date, the significance of this constraint has been tested exclusively under peak metabolic demands, such as during lactation. Here, we used a different set of metabolic stressors, which do not induce maximum energy expenditures and yet are likely to expose the potential constraining effect of heat dissipation. We compared the physiological responses of mice divergently selected for high (H-BMR) and low basal metabolic rate (L-BMR) to simultaneous exposure to the keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH) antigen and high ambient temperature (T-a). At 34 degrees C (and at 23 degrees C, used as a control), KLH challenge resulted in a transient increase in core body temperature (T-b) in mice of both line types (by approximately 0.4 degrees C). Warm exposure did not produce line-type-dependent differences in T-b (which was consistently higher by ca. 0.6 degrees C in H-BMR mice across both T-a values), nor did it result in the suppression of antibody synthesis. These findings were also supported by the lack of between-line-type differences in the mass of the thymus, spleen or lymph nodes. Warm exposure induced the downsizing of heat-generating internal organs (small intestine, liver and kidneys) and an increase in intrascapular brown adipose tissue mass. However, these changes were similar in scope in both line types. Mounting a humoral immune response in selected mice was therefore not affected by ambient temperature. Thus, a combined metabolic challenge of high Ta and an immune response did not appreciably compromise the capacity to dissipate heat, even in the H-BMR mice.",2016,10.1242/jeb.129312,219,10,1542-1551,NA,BMR; Blood parameters; Artificial selection; Humoral response; Immunosuppression; Trade-offs
article,The evolution of endothermy is explained by thyroid hormone-mediated responses to cold in early vertebrates,"Little, Alexander G. and Seebacher, Frank",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The evolution of endothermy is one of the most intriguing and consistently debated topics in vertebrate biology, but the proximate mechanisms that mediated its evolution are unknown. Here, we suggest that the function of thyroid hormone in regulating physiological processes in response to cold is key to understanding the evolution of endothermy. We argue that the capacity of early chordates to produce thyroid hormone internally was the first step in this evolutionary process. Selection could then act on the capacity of thyroid hormone to regulate metabolism, muscle force production and cardiac performance to maintain their function against the negative thermodynamic effects of decreasing temperature. Thyroid-mediated cold acclimation would have been the principal selective advantage. The actions of thyroid hormone during cold acclimation in zebrafish are very similar to its role during endothermic thermogenesis. The thyroid-mediated increases in metabolism and locomotor performance in ectotherms eventually resulted in sufficient heat production to affect body temperature. From this point onwards, increased body temperature per se could be of selective advantage and reinforce thyroid-induced increases in physiological rates. Selection for increased body temperature would promote those mechanisms that maximise heat production, such as increased Na+/K+-ATPase activity, futile cycling by SERCA, and mitochondrial uncoupling, all of which are regulated by thyroid hormone. The specific end point of this broader evolutionary process would be endothermic thermoregulation. However, considering the evolution of endothermy in isolation is misleading because the selective advantages that drove the evolutionary process were independent from endothermy. In other words, without the selective advantages of thyroid-mediated cold acclimation in fish, there would be no endotherms.",2014,10.1242/jeb.088880,217,10,1642-1648,NA,Thermoregulation; Locomotion; Metabolism; Heat production; Aerobic capacity
article,"Interspecific variation in hypoxia tolerance, swimming performance and plasticity in cyprinids that prefer different habitats","Fu, Shi-Jian and Fu, Cheng and Yan, Guan-Jie and Cao, Zhen-Dong and Zhang, An-Jie and Pang, Xu",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"This study quantified and compared hypoxia tolerance and swim performance among cyprinid fish species from rapid-, slow-and intermediate-flow habitats (four species per habitat) in China. In addition, we explored the effects of short-term acclimation on swim performance, maximum metabolic rate ((M) over dot(O2,max)) and gill remodelling to detect habitat-associated patterns of plastic response to hypoxia. Indices of hypoxia tolerance included oxygen threshold for loss of equilibrium (LOE50) and aquatic surface respiration (ASR(50)), and critical oxygen tension for routine metabolic rate (P-crit). Critical swimming speed (U-crit) and (M) over dot(O2,max), max were measured under normoxic and hypoxic conditions after 48 h acclimation to normoxia and hypoxia, and gill remodelling was estimated after 48 h of hypoxia exposure. Both traditional ANCOVA and phylogenetically independent contrast (PDANOVA) analyses showed that fish species from rapid-flow habitats exhibited lower LOE50 compared with fish from intermediate-and slow-flow habitats. Habitat-specific differences in P-crit and U-crit were detected using PDANOVA but not traditional ANCOVA analyses, with fish species from rapid-flow habitats exhibiting lower P-crit but higher U-crit values compared with fish from intermediate-and slow-flow habitats. Fish species from rapid-flow habitats were also characterized by less plasticity in swim performance and gill morphology in response to hypoxia acclimation compared with species from slow-flow habitats, but a greater drop in swim performance in response to acute hypoxia exposure. The study detected a habitat-specific difference in hypoxia tolerance, swimming performance and its plasticity among fish from habitats with different flow conditions, possibly because of the long-term adaptation to the habitat caused by selection stress. The PDANOVA analyses were more powerful than traditional statistical analyses according to the habitat effects in both hypoxia tolerance and swimming performance in this study.",2014,10.1242/jeb.089268,217,4,590-597,NA,Hypoxia tolerance; Preferred habitat; Swimming performance; Phenotypic plasticity; Gill morphology

In Manduca sexta and Drosophila melanogaster, the larval size at which metamorphosis is initiated largely determines adult size, and metamorphosis is initiated when larvae attain a critical mass. We hypothesized that oxygen effects on final size might be mediated by oxygen effects on the critical weight and the ecdysone titers, which regulate growth rate and the timing of developmental transitions. Our results showed that oxygen affected critical weight, the basal ecdysone titers and the timing of the ecdysone peak, providing clear evidence that oxygen affected growth rate and developmental rate. Hypoxic third instar larvae (10\% oxygen) exhibited a reduced critical weight, slower growth rate, delayed pupariation, elevated baseline ecdysone levels and a delayed ecdysone peak that occurred at a lower larval mass. Hyperoxic larvae exhibited increased basal ecdysone levels, but no change in critical weight compared with normoxic larvae and no significant change in timing of pupariation. Previous studies have shown that nutrition is crucial for regulating growth rate and the timing of developmental transitions. Here we show that oxygen level is one of multiple cues that together regulate adult size and the timing and dynamics of growth, developmental rate and ecdysone signaling.",2013,10.1242/jeb.093120,216,23,4334-4340,NA,oxygen; ecdysone; growth; size regulation; critical weight; Drosophila melanogaster

We explored the involvement of NO in controlling NaCl secretion by the opercular epithelium of seawater killifish using an Ussing chamber approach. Pharmacological agents were used to explore the mechanism(s) triggering NO action. A modified Biotin-switch technique was used to investigate S-nitrosation of proteins. Stimulation of endogenous NO production via the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) substrate L-arginine (2.0 mmol l(-1)), and addition of exogenous NO via the NO donor SNAP (10(-6) to 10(-4) mol l(-1)), decreased the epithelial short-circuit current (I-sc). Inhibition of endogenous NO production by the NOS inhibitor L-NAME (10(-4) mol l(-1)) increased Isc and revealed a tonic control of ion transport by NO in unstimulated opercular epithelia. The NO scavenger PTIO (10(-5) mol l(-1)) supressed the NO-mediated decrease in Isc, and confirmed that the effect observed was elicited by release of NO. The effect of SNAP on Isc was abolished by inhibitors of the soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), ODQ (10(-6) mol l(-1)) and Methylene Blue (10(-4) mol l(-1)), revealing NO signalling via the sGC/cGMP pathway. Incubation of opercular epithelium and gill tissues with SNAP (10(-4) mol l(-1)) led to S-nitrosation of proteins, including Na+/K+-ATPase. Blocking of NOS with L-NAME (10(-6) mol l(-1)) or scavenging of NO with PTIO during hypotonic shock suggested an involvement of NO in the hypotonic-mediated decrease in Isc. Yohimbine (10(-4) mol l(-1)), an inhibitor of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors, did not block NO effects, suggesting that NO is not involved in the a-adrenergic control of NaCl secretion.",2016,10.1242/jeb.145045,219,21,3455-3464,NA,NO; Cl- secretion; Mummichog; Epithelial ion transport; sGC/cGMP pathway

Although it is clear that sudden and extreme temperatures can damage reproductive processes, there is limited understanding of the effects of heatwaves on male mating behaviour and reproductive success. We tested for the effects of heat stress induced by ecologically relevant heatwaves (33 degrees C and 39 degrees C for five consecutive days) on the mating behaviour, reproductive success, body mass and survival of male field crickets Gryllus bimaculatus, paired with untreated females. We predicted life -history and reproductive costs would increase with increasing heatwave intensity. Consistent with our expectations, males exposed to the highest heatwave temperature produced the fewest offspring, while having to increase courtship effort to successfully mate. Males also gained relatively more weight following heatwave exposure. Given that we found no difference in lifetime survival, our results suggest a potential trade-off in resource allocation between somatic maintenance and reproductive investment. Taken together, our findings indicate that sublethal effects of heatwaves could reduce the growth and persistence of animal populations by negatively impacting reproductive rates.

Cardiac taurine levels were reduced by 21\% and stress-induced changes in normal taurine handling were observed in TD brook char. Responses to exhaustive exercise and acute thermal and hypoxia tolerance were then assessed using a combination of in vivo, in vitro and biochemical approaches. Critical thermal maximum was higher in TD brook char despite significant reductions in maximum heart rate. In vivo, TD brook char exhibited a lower resting heart rate, blunted hypoxic bradycardia and a severe reduction in time to loss of equilibrium under hypoxia. In vitro function was similar between control and TD hearts under oxygenated conditions, but stroke volume and cardiac output were severely compromised in TD hearts under severe hypoxia. Aspects of mitochondrial structure and function were also impacted in TD permeabilized cardiomyocytes, but overall effects were modest.

article,Effects of intermittent hypoxia on oxidative stress and protein degradation in molluscan mitochondria,"Ivanina, Anna V. and Sokolova, Inna M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Oxygen fluctuations represent a common stressor in estuarine and intertidal environments and can compromise the mitochondrial integrity and function in marine organisms. We assessed the role of mitochondrial protection mechanisms (ATP-dependent and -independent mitochondrial proteases, and antioxidants) in tolerance to intermittent hypoxia or anoxia in three species of marine bivalves: hypoxia-tolerant hard clams (Mercenaria mercenaria) and oysters (Crassostrea virginica), and a hypoxia-sensitive subtidal scallop (Argopecten irradians). In clams and oysters, mitochondrial tolerance to hypoxia (18 h at 5\% O-2), anoxia (18 h at 0.1\% O-2) and subsequent reoxygenation was associated with the ability to maintain the steadystate activity of ATP-dependent and-independent mitochondrial proteases and an anticipatory upregulation of the total antioxidant capacity under the low oxygen conditions. No accumulation of endproducts of lipid or protein peroxidation was found during intermittent hypoxia oranoxiain clams and oysters (except foran increase in protein carbonyl concentration after hypoxia-reoxygenation in oysters). In contrast, hypoxia/anoxia and reoxygenation strongly suppressed activity of the ATP-dependent mitochondrial proteases in hypoxiasensitive scallops. This suppressionwas associated with accumulation of oxidatively damaged mitochondrial proteins (including carbonylated proteins and proteins conjugated with a lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde) despite high total antioxidant capacity levels in scallop mitochondria.

article,Cold-induced depolarization of insect muscle: differing roles of extracellular K<SUP>+</SUP> during acute and chronic chilling,"MacMillan, Heath Andrew and Findsen, Anders and Pedersen, Thomas Holm and Overgaard, Johannes",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Insects enter chill coma, a reversible state of paralysis, at temperatures below their critical thermal minimum (CTmin), and the time required for an insect to recover after a cold exposure is termed chill coma recovery time (CCRT). The CTmin and CCRT are both important metrics of insect cold tolerance that are used interchangeably, although chill coma recovery is not necessarily permitted by a direct reversal of the mechanism causing chill coma onset. Nevertheless, onset and recovery of coma have been attributed to loss of neuromuscular function due to depolarization of muscle fibre membrane potential (V-m). Here we test the hypothesis that muscle depolarization at chill coma onset and repolarization during chill coma recovery are caused by changes in extracellular {[}K+] and/or other effects of low temperature. Using Locusta migratoria, we measured in vivo muscle resting potentials of the extensor tibialis during cooling, following prolonged exposure to -2 degrees C and during chill coma recovery, and related changes in V-m to transmembrane {[}K+] balance and temperature. Although V-m was rapidly depolarized by cooling, hemolymph {[}K+] did not rise until locusts had spent considerable time in the cold. Nonetheless, a rise in hemolymph [}K+] during prolonged cold exposure further depressed muscle resting potential and slowed recovery from chill coma upon rewarming. Muscle resting potentials had a bimodal distribution, and with elevation of extracellular {[}K+] (but not temperature) muscle resting potentials become unimodal. Thus, a disruption of extracellular {[}K+] does depolarize muscle resting potential and slow CCRT following prolonged cold exposure. However, onset of chill coma at the CTmin relates to an as-yet-unknown effect of temperature on neuromuscular function.",2014,10.1242/jeb.107516,217,16,2930-2938,NA,Ion balance; Thermal limits; Neuromuscular system; Potassium
article,"Chill coma temperatures appear similar along a latitudinal gradient, in contrast to divergent chill coma recovery times, in two widespread ant species","Maysov, Andrey",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Populations of widely distributed ectotherms demonstrate different cold resistance corresponding to the local climate. However, efficiently thermoregulating ectotherms could avoid divergence in cold resistance. Two species of ants, previously shown to even out latitudinal differences of mean summer temperatures in their nests, were used to test this hypothesis by comparing the temperature dependence of cold resistance in three distant populations (from 50 degrees, 60 degrees and 67 degrees N). The species differ in habitat preferences, one (Myrmica rubra) being less stenotopic than the other (M. ruginodis). Therefore, three different predictions were made about their cold resistance: along the latitudinal gradient, it might be similar within the two species (because of thermoregulation within nests/habitats) or similar only in M. rubra (as a result of thermoregulation among habitats), or divergent at least in M. rubra (no effect of thermoregulation). Among populations of both species, neither differences nor latitudinal trends in chill coma temperature were statistically significant after 11 months of standard conditions, with or without cold hardening. In contrast, recovery time significantly differed among populations in both species, although its latitudinal trends were strongly curvilinear: in M. rubra, the intermediate population tended towards the slowest recovery, and in M. ruginodis, it tended towards the fastest. After 22 months, the patterns remained the same, except that M. ruginodis showed a significant linear latitudinal trend in chill coma temperature (with no significant populational differences). Hence, thermoregulation, both within and among habitats, apparently does keep chill coma temperatures similar.

Only the female develops a brood patch in most passerine species, but males of some species can incubate and maintain the eggs at similar temperatures to females even without a brood patch. Here we used a novel application of infrared thermography to examine sex differences in parental care from a physiological perspective. Using incubating male and female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), a species in which the male lacks a brood patch, we measured the surface temperature of the ventral plumage overlying the abdomen and a reference area that does not contact the eggs (thorax) twice per pair. In half of the pairs, clutch size was experimentally enlarged between the two sets of measurements to increase incubation demand. We found that the temperature differential between abdomen and thorax plumage was greater in females than in males, and that abdomen plumage was warmer after clutch enlargement than before in females but not in males.

Additionally, an increase in stroke volume and ventilatory volume per minute was observed, followed by a mantle hyperinflation process during high activity periods. Squid metabolic rate dropped more than 75\% during exposure to hypoxia. Maximum metabolic rate was not achieved under such conditions and the metabolic scope was significantly decreased. Hypoxia changed the relationship between mantle contraction strength and frequency from linear to polynomial with increasing activity, indicating that, under hypoxic conditions, the jumbo squid primarily increases the strength of mantle contraction and does not regulate its frequency. Under hypoxia, jumbo squid also showed a larger inflation period (reduced contraction frequency) and decreased relaxed mantle diameter (shortened diffusion pathway), which optimize oxygen extraction efficiency (up to 82\%/34\%, without/with consideration of 60\% potential skin respiration). Additionally, they breathe `deeply', with more powerful contractions and enhanced stroke volume. This deep-breathing behavior allows them to display a stable ventilatory volume per minute, and explains the maintenance of the squid's cycling activity under such O-2 conditions. During hypoxia, the respiratory cycles were shorter in length but increased in frequency. This was accompanied by an increase in the number of escape jets during active periods and a faster switch between swimming modes. In late hypoxia (onset similar to 170 +/- 10 min), all the ventilatory processes were significantly reduced and followed by a lethargic state, a behavior that seems closely associated with the process of metabolic suppression and enables the squid to extend its residence time in the OMZ.",2013,10.1242/jeb.072587,216,3,359-368,NA,hypoxia; OMZ; jet propulsion; ventilation; jumbo squid; Dosidicus gigas; metabolic suppression
article,"Hypoxia-seeking behavior, metabolic depression and skeletal muscle function in an amphibious fish out of water","Rossi, Giulia S. and Wright, Patricia A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Several animals enter a state of dormancy to survive harsh environmental conditions. During dormancy, metabolic depression can be critical for economizing on limited endogenous energy reserves. We used two isogenic strains (strain 1 and strain 2) of a self-fertilizing amphibious fish (Kryptolebias marmoratus) to test the hypothesis that animals seek hypoxic microhabitats that, in turn, accentuate metabolic depression during dormancy. Using custombuilt tunnels that maintained a longitudinal O-2 gradient (hypoxic to normoxic), we assessed the O-2 preference of K. marmoratus during prolonged air exposure. In support of our hypothesis, we found that one isogenic strain (strain 2) spent more time in hypoxia compared with normoxia after 21 days in air. Prolonged air exposure in both strains resulted in lower O-2 consumption rates compared with active fish (35\% depression), which was accentuated (51\% depression) when fish were exposed to aerial hypoxia acutely. We then tested the hypothesis that chronic aerial hypoxia acclimation would protect endogenous energy reserves and skeletal muscle integrity, thereby maintaining locomotor performance, possibly owing to hypoxic hypometabolism. We found that air-acclimated fish from both strains were in poorer body condition relative to fish acclimated to aerial hypoxia. Furthermore, aerial hypoxia acclimation minimized glycogen usage (strain 1), lipid catabolism (strain 2) and white muscle atrophy (strain 2), as well as preserved terrestrial locomotor performance compared with fish in air (strain 2). Overall, our findings suggest that some K. marmoratus strains seek microhabitats that accentuate metabolic depression during dormancy, and that microhabitat O-2 availability may have significant implications for energy metabolism, and the structure and function of skeletal muscle. Furthermore, the differential responses between isogenic strains suggests that genetic factors also contribute to phenotypic differences in the emersion behavior and physiology of this species.",2020,10.1242/jeb.213355,223,2,NA,jeb213355,Microenvironment; Hypoxic hypometabolism; Muscle phenotype; Energy reserves; Dormancy; Choice chamber
article,Critical thermal limits affected differently by developmental and adult thermal fluctuations,"Salachan, Paul Vinu and Sorensen, Jesper Givskov",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Means and variances of the environmental thermal regime play an important role in determining the fitness of terrestrial ectotherms. Adaptive phenotypic responses induced by heterogeneous temperatures have been shown to be mediated by molecular pathways independent of the classic heat shock responses; however, an in-depth understanding of plasticity induced by fluctuating temperatures is still lacking. We investigated high and low temperature acclimation induced by fluctuating thermal regimes at two different mean temperatures, at two different amplitudes of fluctuation and across the developmental and adult life stages of Drosophila melanogaster. For developmental acclimation, we found mildly detrimental effects of high-amplitude fluctuations for critical thermal minima, while the critical thermal maxima showed a beneficial response to higher amplitude fluctuations. For adult acclimation involving shifts between fluctuating and constant regimes, cold tolerance was shown to be dictated by developmental temperature conditions irrespective of the adult treatments, while the acquired heat tolerance was readily lost when flies developed at fluctuating temperature were shifted to a constant regime as adults. Interestingly, we also found that the effect of fluctuations at any life stage was gradually lost with prolonged adult maintenance, suggesting a more prominent effect of fluctuations during developmental compared with adult acclimation in D. melanogaster.",2017,10.1242/jeb.165308,220,23,4471-4478,NA,Acclimation; Cold tolerance; Drosophila melanogaster; Phenotypic plasticity; Temperature resistance

In contrast to many vertebrates that experience decreased motor performance after inactivity, bullfrogs, Lithobates catesbeianus, retain functional respiratory motor processes following cold-submergence. Unlike mammalian hibernators with unloaded limb muscles and inactive locomotor systems, respiratory mechanics of frogs counterintuitively allow for ventilatory maneuvers when submerged. Thus, we hypothesized that bullfrogs generate respiratory motor patterns during coldsubmergence to avoid disuse and preserve motor performance. Accordingly, we measured activity of respiratory muscles ( buccal floor compressor and glottal dilator) via electromyography in freely behaving bullfrogs at 20 and 2 degrees C. Although we confirm that ventilation cycles occur underwater at 20 degrees C, bullfrogs did not activate either respiratory muscle when submerged acutely or chronically at 2 degrees C. We conclude that cold-submerged bullfrogs endure respiratory motor inactivity, implying that other mechanisms, excluding underwater muscle activation, maintain a functional respiratory motor system throughout overwintering.",2017,10.1242/jeb.153544,220,7,1181-1186,NA,Neuromuscular; EMG; Respiratory; Hibernation; Disuse; Inactivity
article,Both thyroid hormone levels and resting metabolic rate decrease in African striped mice when food availability decreases,"Rimbach, Rebecca and Pillay, Neville and Schradin, Carsten",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In response to variation in food availability and ambient temperature (T-a), many animals show seasonal adaptations in their physiology. Laboratory studies showed that thyroid hormones are involved in the regulation of metabolism, and their regulatory function is especially important when the energy balance of an individual is compromised. However, little is known about the relationship between thyroid hormones and metabolism in free- living animals and animals inhabiting seasonal environments. Here, we studied seasonal changes in triiodothyronine (T-3) levels, resting metabolic rate (RMR) and two physiological markers of energy balance (blood glucose and ketone bodies) in 61 free- living African striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio) that live in an semi- arid environment with food shortage during the dry season. We predicted a positive relationship between T-3 levels and RMR. Further, we predicted higher T-3 levels, blood glucose levels and RMR, but lower ketone body concentrations, during the moist season when food availability is high compared with summer when food availability is low. RMR and T-3 levels were negatively related in the moist season but not in the dry season. Both RMR and T-3 levels were higher in the moist than in the dry season, and T-3 levels increased with increasing food availability. In the dry season, blood glucose levels were lower but ketone body concentrations were higher, indicating a change in substrate use. Seasonal adjustments in RMR and T-3 levels permit a reduction of energy expenditure when food is scarce, and reflect an adaptive response to reduced food availability in the dry season.",2017,10.1242/jeb.151449,220,5,837-843,NA,Triiodothyronine; Metabolism; Energetics; Fasting; Starvation; Drought
article,Beyond body size: muscle biochemistry and body shape explain ontogenetic variation of anti-predatory behaviour in the lizard <i>Salvator merianae</i>,"de Barros, Fabio Cury and de Carvalho, Jose Eduardo and Abe, Augusto Shinya and Kohlsdorf, Tiana",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Anti-predatory behaviour evolves under the strong action of natural selection because the success of individuals avoiding predation essentially defines their fitness. Choice of anti-predatory strategies is defined by prey characteristics as well as environmental temperature. An additional dimension often relegated in this multilevel equation is the ontogenetic component. In the tegu Salvator merianae, adults run away from predators at high temperatures but prefer fighting when it is cold, whereas juveniles exhibit the same flight strategy within a wide thermal range. Here, we integrate physiology and morphology to understand ontogenetic variation in the temperature-dependent shift of anti-predatory behaviour in these lizards. We compiled data for body shape and size, and quantified enzyme activity in hindlimb and head muscles, testing the hypothesis that morphophysiological models explain ontogenetic variation in behavioural associations. Our prediction is that juveniles exhibit body shape and muscle biochemistry that enhance flight strategies. We identified biochemical differences between muscles mainly in the LDH:CS ratio, whereby hindlimb muscles were more glycolytic than the jaw musculature. Juveniles, which often use evasive strategies to avoid predation, have more glycolytic hindlimb muscles and are much smaller when compared with adults 1-2 years old. Ontogenetic differences in body shape were identified but marginally contributed to behavioural variation between juvenile and adult tegus, and variation in anti-predatory behaviour in these lizards resides mainly in associations between body size and muscle biochemistry. Our results are discussed in the ecological context of predator avoidance by individuals differing in body size living at temperature-variable environments, where restrictions imposed by the cold could be compensated by specific phenotypes.",2016,10.1242/jeb.130740,219,11,1649-1658,NA,Tegu lizards; Morphology; Muscle biochemistry; Behavioural shift; Temperature; Ontogeny; Predation
article,"Interplay between group size, huddling behavior and basal metabolism: an experimental approach in the social degu","Nunez-Villegas, Monica and Bozinovic, Francisco and Sabat, Pablo",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Mammals exposed to low temperatures increase their metabolic rate to maintain constant body temperature and thus compensate for heat loss. This high and costly energetic demand can be mitigated through thermoregulatory behavior such as social grouping or huddling, which helps to decrease metabolic rate as function of the numbers of individuals grouped. Sustained low temperatures in endothermic animals produce changes over time in rates of energy expenditure, by means of phenotypic plasticity. However, the putative modulating effect that huddling exerts on the flexibility of the basal metabolic rate (BMR) due to thermal acclimation remains unknown. We determined BMR values in Octodon degus, an endemic Chilean rodent, after being acclimated to either 15 or 30 degrees C during 60 days, both alone and in groups of three and five individuals. At 15 degrees C, BMR of huddling individuals was 40\% lower than that of animals housed alone. Moreover, infrared thermography revealed a significant increase in local surface temperatures in huddled animals. Furthermore, individual thermal conductance was lower in individuals acclimated to 15 degrees C than to 30 degrees C, but no differences were observed between single and grouped animals. Our results indicate that huddling prevents an increase in BMR when animals are acclimated to cold conditions and that this effect is proportional to the number of animals grouped.",2014,10.1242/jeb.096164,217,6,997-1002,NA,Acclimation; Basal metabolic rate; Huddling; Octodon degus; Phenotypic plasticity
article,Thrust production and chordal flexion of the flukes of bottlenose dolphins performing tail stands at different efforts,"Kramer, David A. and Sheehan, Maura J. and Fish, Frank E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Dolphins have become famous for their ability to perform a wide variety of athletic and acrobatic behaviors including high-speed swimming, maneuverability, porpoising and tail stands. Tail stands are a behavior where part of the body is held vertically above the water's surface, achieved through thrust produced by horizontal tail fluke oscillations. Strong, efficient propulsors are needed to generate the force required to support the dolphin's body weight, exhibiting chordwise and spanwise flexibility throughout the stroke cycle. To determine how thrust production, fluke flexibility and tail stroke kinematics vary with effort, six adult bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) were tested at three different levels based on the position of the center of mass (COM) relative to the water's surface: low (COM below surface), medium (COM at surface) and high (COM above surface) effort. Additionally, fluke flexibility was measured as a flex index (FI=chord length/camber length) at four points in the stroke cycle: center stroke up (CU), extreme top of stroke (ET), center stroke down (CD) and extreme bottom of stroke (EB). Video recordings were analyzed to determine the weight supported above the water (thrust production), peak-to-peak amplitude, stroke frequency and FI. Force production increased with low, medium and high efforts, respectively. Stroke frequency also increased with increased effort. Amplitude remained constant with a mean 33.8\% of body length. Significant differences were seen in the FI during the stroke cycle. Changes in FI and stroke frequency allowed for increased force production with effort, and the peak-to-peak amplitude was higher compared with that for horizontal swimming.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246228,227,5,NA,jeb246228,Locomotion; Flexibility; Cetacean; Thrust -to -weight
article,"The mechanics of air breathing in African clawed frog tadpoles, <i>Xenopus laevis</i> (Anura: Pipidae)","Phillips, Jackson R. and Hewes, Amanda E. and Womack, Molly C. and Schwenk, Kurt",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Frog larvae (tadpoles) undergo many physiological, morphological and behavioral transformations throughout development before metamorphosing into their adult form. The surface tension of water prevents small tadpoles from breaching the surface to breathe air (including those of Xenopus laevis), forcing them to acquire air using a form of breathing called bubble sucking. With growth, tadpoles typically make a behavioral/biomechanical transition from bubble sucking to breaching. Xenopus laevis tadpoles have also been shown to transition physiologically from conforming passively to ambient oxygen levels to actively regulating their blood oxygen. However, it is unknown whether these mechanical and physiological breathing transitions are temporally or functionally linked, or how both transitions relate to lung maturation and gas exchange competency. If these transitions are linked, it could mean that one biomechanical breathing mode (breaching) is more physiologically proficient at acquiring gaseous oxygen than the other. Here, we describe the mechanics and development of air breathing and the ontogeny of lung morphology in X. laevis throughout the larval stage and examine our findings considering previous physiological work. We found that the transitions from bubble sucking to breaching and from oxygen conforming to oxygen regulation co-occur in X. laevis tadpoles at the same larval stage (Nieuwkoop-Faber stages 53-56 and 54-57, respectively), but that the lungs do not increase significantly in vascularization until metamorphosis, suggesting that lung maturation, alone, is not sufficient to account for increased pulmonary capacity earlier in development. Although breach breathing may confer a respiratory advantage, we remain unaware of a mechanistic explanation to account for this possibility. At present, the transition from bubble sucking to breaching appears simply to be a consequence of growth. Finally, we consider our results in the context of comparative air-breathing mechanics across vertebrates.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243102,225,10,NA,jeb243102,Anura; Functional morphology; Physiology; Behavior; Respiration; Lungs; Development

F. and Norin, Tommy and Tabak, Iren and van Deurs, Mikael and Behrens, Jane W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Invasive species exert negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems on a global scale, which may be enhanced in the future by climate change. Knowledge of how invasive species respond physiologically and behaviorally to novel and changing environments can improve our understanding of which traits enable the ecological success of these species, and potentially facilitate mitigation efforts. We examined the effects of acclimation to temperatures ranging from 5 to 28 degrees C on aerobic metabolic rates, upper temperature tolerance (critical thermal maximum, CTmax), as well as temperature preference T-pref) and avoidance (T-avoid) of the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), one of the most impactful invasive species in the world. We show that round goby maintained a high aerobic scope from 15 to 28 degrees C; that is, the capacity to increase its aerobic metabolic rate above that of its maintenance metabolism remained high across a broad thermal range. Although CTmax increased relatively little with acclimation temperature compared with other species, T-pref and T-avoid were not affected by acclimation temperature at all, meaning that round goby maintained a large thermal safety margin (CTmax, T-avoid) across acclimation temperatures, indicating a high level of thermal resilience in this species. The unperturbed physiological performance and high thermal resilience were probably facilitated by high levels of phenotypic buffering, which can make species readily adaptable and ecologically competitive in novel and changing environments. We suggest that these physiological and behavioral traits could be common for invasive species, which would only increase their success under continued climate change.",2021,10.1242/jeb.237669,224,1,NA,jeb237669,Aerobic scope; Climate change; Critical thermal maximum; Metabolic rate; Neogobius melanostomus; Temperature preference
article,Mitochondrial thermo-sensitivity in invasive and native freshwater mussels,"Hraoui, Georges and Bettinazzi, Stefano and Gendron, Andree D. and Boisclair, Daniel and Breton, Sophie",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Climate change is impacting many, if not all, forms of life. Increases in extreme temperature fluctuations and average temperatures can cause stress, particularly in aquatic sessile ectotherms such as freshwater mussels. However, some species seem to thrive more than others in face of temperature-related stressors. Thermal tolerance may, for example, explain the success of invasive species. It is also known that mitochondria can play a key role in setting an ectothermic species' thermal tolerance. In this study, we aimed to characterize the mitochondrial thermo-tolerance in invasive and endemic freshwater mussels. With the use of high-resolution respirometry, we analyzed the mitochondrial respiration of two freshwater bivalve species exposed to a broad range of temperatures. We noticed that the invasive dreissenid Dreissena bugensis possessed a less thermo-tolerant mitochondrial metabolism than the endemic unionid Elliptio complanata. This lack of tolerance was linked with a more noticeable aerobic metabolic depression at elevated temperatures. This decrease in mitochondrial metabolic activity was also linked with an increase in leak oxygen consumption as well as a stable maintenance of the activity of cytochrome c oxidase in both species. These findings may be associated both with the species' life history characteristics, as D. bugensis is more adapted to unstable habitats, in which selection pressures for resistance adaptations are reduced. Our findings add to the growing body of literature characterizing the mitochondrial metabolism of many aquatic ectotherms in our changing world.",2020,10.1242/jeb.215921,223,2,NA,jeb215921,Mitochondria; Climate change; Thermal sensitivity; Invasive species; Aquatic ectotherms
article,Transforming growth factor beta-1 ( TGF-β1) stimulates collagen synthesis in cultured rainbow trout cardiac fibroblasts,"Johnston, Elizabeth F. and Gillis, Todd E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Cold acclimation of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, causes collagen to increase within the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the myocardium, while warm acclimation has the opposite effect. The mechanism responsible for this remodelling response is not known. In mammals, transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta 1) stimulates collagen deposition within the myocardial ECM. Therefore, we hypothesized that TGF-beta 1 regulates trout myocardial ECM turnover and predicted that TGF-beta 1 would induce collagen deposition in cultured rainbow trout cardiac fibroblasts. We found that treatment of trout cardiac fibroblasts with 15 ng ml(-1) human recombinant TGF-beta 1 caused an increase in total collagen at 48 and 72 h and an increase in collagen type I protein after 7 days. We also found that TGF-beta 1 treatment caused an increase in the transcript abundance of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (timp-2) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (mmp-9) at 24 h. Cells treated with TGF-beta 1 also had lower levels of the gene transcript for mmp-2 after 48 h and higher levels of the gene transcript for collagen type I a1 (col1a1) after 72 h. These changes in gene expression suggest that the increase in collagen deposition is due to a decrease in the activity of matrix metalloproteinases and an increase in collagen synthesis. Together, these results indicate that TGF-beta 1 is a regulator of ECM composition in cultured trout cardiac fibroblasts and suggest that this cytokine may play a role in regulating collagen content in the trout heart during thermal acclimation.",2017,10.1242/jeb.160093,220,14,2645-2653,NA,Myocardium; Collagen matrix; Cytokine; Tissue remodelling

In high cost environments, thermal specialists are supposed to be more prone to using facultative heterothermy than generalists. We tested this hypothesis at the intraspecific level using male laboratory mice (C57BL/cmdb) fasted under different thermal conditions (20 and 10 degrees C) and for different time periods (12-48 h). We predicted that variability of body temperature (T-b) and time spent with T-b below normothermy would increase with the increase of environmental demands (duration of fasting and cold). To verify the above prediction, we measured T-b and energy expenditure of fasted mice. We did not record torpor bouts but we found that variations in T-b and time spent in hypothermia increased with environmental demands. In response to fasting, mice also decreased their energy expenditure. Moreover, animals that showed more precise thermoregulation when fed had more variable T-b when fasted. We postulate that the prediction of the thermoregulatory generalist-specialist trade-off can be applied at the intraspecific level, offering a valid tool for identifying mechanistic explanations of the differences in animal responses to variations in energy supply.",2017,10.1242/jeb.160150,220,13,2380-2386,NA,Body temperature; Heterothermy; Fasting; Specialistgeneralist trade-off

C. and Esterhuizen, Nanike and Bazelet, Corinna S. and Addison, Pia and Terblanche, John S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Katydids produce acoustic signals via stridulation, which they use to attract conspecific females for mating. However, direct estimates of the metabolic costs of calling to date have produced diverse cost estimates and are limited to only a handful of insect species. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the metabolic cost of calling in an unstudied sub-Saharan katydid, Plangia graminea. Using wild-caught animals, we measured katydid metabolic rate using standard flow-through respirometry while simultaneously recording the number of calls produced. Overall, the metabolic rate during calling in P. graminea males was 60\% higher than the resting metabolic rate (0.443 +/- 0.056 versus 0.279 +/- 0.028 ml CO2 h(-1) g(-1)), although this was highly variable among individuals. Although individual call costs were relatively inexpensive (ranging from 0.02 to 5.4\% increase in metabolic rate per call), the individuals with cheaper calls called more often and for longer than those with expensive calls, resulting in the former group having significantly greater cumulative costs over a standard amount of time (9.5 h). However, the metabolic costs of calling are context dependent because the amount of time spent calling greatly influenced these costs in our trials. A power law function described this relationship between cumulative cost (y) and percentage increase per call (x) (y=130.21x(-1.068), R-2=0.858). The choice of metric employed for estimating energy costs (i.e. how costs are expressed) also affects the outcome and any interpretation of costs of sexual signalling. For example, the absolute, relative and cumulative metabolic costs of calling yielded strongly divergent estimates, and any fitness implications depend on the organism's energy budget and the potential trade-offs in allocation of resources that are made as a direct consequence of increased calling effort.",2017,10.1242/jeb.160036,220,23,4440-4449,NA,Communication; Evolution; Sound production; Energy; Phylogenetic signal

We investigated the retina and coloration of one member of this family, the flathead oak borer Coraebus undatus using microscopy, spectrometry, polarimetry, electroretinography and intracellular recordings of photoreceptor cell responses. The compound eyes are built of a highly unusual mosaic of mirror-symmetric or chiral ommatidia that are randomly rotated along the body axes. Each ommatidium has eight photoreceptors, two of them having rhabdomeres in tiers. The eyes contain six spectral classes of photoreceptors, peaking in the UV, blue, green and red. Most photoreceptors have moderate polarization sensitivity with randomly distributed angular maxima. The beetles have the necessary retinal substrate for complex color vision, required to recognize conspecifics and suitable for a targeted design of color traps. However, the jewel beetle array of freely rotated ommatidia is very different from the ordered mosaic in insects that have object-directed polarization vision.

In this study, we used artificial flows emerging from a sandy substrate to assess the contribution of flow sensing to prey detection in the peacock cichlid, Aulonocara stuartgranti, which feeds on benthic invertebrates in Lake Malawi. Using a positive reinforcement protocol, we trained fish to respond to flows lacking the visual and chemical cues generated by tethered prey in prior studies with A. stuartgranti. Fish successfully responded to artificial flows at all five rates presented (characterized using digital particle image velocimetry), and showed a range of flow-sensing behaviors, including an unconditioned bite response. Immediately after lateral line inactivation, fish rarely responded to flows and the loss of vital fluorescent staining of hair cells (with 4-di-2-ASP) verified lateral line inactivation. Within 2 days post-treatment, some aspects of flow-sensing behavior returned and after 7 days, flow-sensing behavior and hair cell fluorescence both returned to pre-treatment levels, which is consistent with the reported timing of hair cell regeneration in other vertebrates.

Although well established, they are not without their weaknesses, namely expense, intrusivenessandlackof temporal resolution. Anewtechniquehas been developed using accelerometers; it uses the overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) of an animal as a calibrated proxy for energy expenditure. This method provides high-resolution data without the need for surgery. Significant relationships exist between the rate of oxygen consumption ((V) over dot O-2) and ODBA in controlled conditions across a number of taxa; however, it is not known whether ODBA represents a robust proxy forenergyexpenditure consistently in all natural behaviours and there have been specific questions over its validity during diving, in diving endotherms. Here, we simultaneously deployed accelerometers and heart rate loggers in a wild population of European shags (Phalacrocorax aristotelis). Existing calibration relationships were then used to make behaviour-specific estimates of energy expenditure for each of these two techniques. Compared with heart rate-derived estimates, the ODBA method predicts energy expenditure well during flight and diving behaviour, but overestimates the cost of resting behaviour. We then combined these two datasets to generate a new calibration relationship between ODBA and ((V) over dot O-2) that accounts for this by being informed by heart rate-derived estimates. Across behaviours we found a good relationship between ODBA and ((V) over dot O-2). Within individual behaviours, we found useable relationships between ODBA and ((V) over dot O-2) for flight and resting, and a poor relationship during diving. The error associated with these new calibration relationships mostly originates from the previous heart rate calibration rather than the error associated with the ODBA method.

Phylogenic analysis revealed that millipede Hc is a sister group to centipede HcA, which supports an early divergence of distinct Hc subunits in myriapods and an ancient origin of multimeric Hcs. Archispirostreptus gigas Hc binds O-2 with a high affinity and shows a strong Bohr effect. O-2 binding is, moreover, modulated by Ca2+ ions, which increase the O-2 affinity of the Hc in the tense (T; deoxygenated) as well as the relaxed (R; oxygenated) states, and by (L)-lactate, which modulates Hc-O-2 affinity by changing the allosteric equilibrium constant, L. Cooperativity in O-2 binding at half O-2 saturation (n(50)) is pH dependent and maximal at similar to pH7.4, and the number of interacting O-2-binding sites (q) is markedly increased by binding Ca2+. The data are discussed in the light of the mutually supplementary roles of Hc and the tracheal system for tissue O-2 supply.",2013,10.1242/jeb.080861,216,9,1616-1623,NA,phylogeny; oxygen binding; Diplopoda; allosteric regulation; calcium; lactate
article,Rorqual whale nasal plugs: protecting the respiratory tract against water entry and barotrauma,"Gil, Kelsey N. and Lillie, Margo A. and Vogl, A. Wayne and Shadwick, Robert E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The upper respiratory tract of rorquals, lunge-feeding baleen whales, must be protected againstwater incursion and the risk of barotrauma at depth, where air-filled spaces like the bony nasal cavities may experience high adverse pressure gradients. We hypothesize these two disparate tasks are accomplished by paired cylindrical nasal plugs that attach on the rostrum and deep inside the nasal cavity. Here, we present evidence that the large size and deep attachment of the plugs is a compromise, allowing them to block the nasal cavities to prevent water entry while also facilitating pressure equilibration between the nasal cavities and ambient hydrostatic pressure (P-amb) at depth. We investigated nasal plug behaviour using videos of rorquals surfacing, plug morphology from dissections, histology and MRI scans, and plug function by mathematically modelling nasal pressures at depth. We found each nasal plug has three structurally distinct regions: a muscular rostral region, a predominantly fatty mid-section and an elastic tendon that attaches the plug caudally. We propose muscle contraction while surfacing pulls the fatty sections rostrally, opening the nasal cavities to air, while the elastic tendons snap the plugs back into place, sealing the cavities after breathing. At depth, we propose P-amb pushes the fatty region deeper into the nasal cavities, decreasing air volume by about half and equilibrating nasal cavity to P-amb, preventing barotrauma. The nasal plugs are a unique innovation in rorquals, which demonstrate their importance and novelty during diving, where pressure becomes as important an issue as the danger of water entry.",2020,10.1242/jeb.219691,223,4,NA,jeb219691,Nasal cavities; Diving physiology; Baleen whale; Hydrostatic pressure
article,Hydrodynamic sensory threshold in harbour seals (<i>Phoca vitulina</i>) for artificial flatfish breathing currents,"Niesterok, Benedikt and Dehnhardt, Guido and Hanke, Wolf",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Harbour seals have the ability to detect benthic fish such as flatfish using the water currents these fish emit through their gills (breathing currents). We investigated the sensory threshold in harbour seals for this specific hydrodynamic stimulus under conditions which are realistic for seals hunting in the wild. We used an experimental platform where an artificial breathing current was emitted through one of eight different nozzles. Two seals were trained to search for the active nozzle. Each experimental session consisted of eight test trials of a particular stimulus intensity and 16 supra-threshold trials of high stimulus intensity. Test trials were conducted with the animals blindfolded. To determine the threshold, a series of breathing currents differing in intensity was used. For each intensity, three sessions were run. The threshold in terms of maximum water velocity within the breathing current was 4.2 cm s(-1) for one seal and 3.7 cm s(-1) for the other. We measured background flow velocities from 1.8 to 3.4 cm s(-1). Typical swimming speeds for both animals were around 0.5 m s(-1). Swimming speed differed between successful and unsuccessful trials. It appears that swimming speed is restricted for the successful detection of a breathing current close to the threshold. Our study is the first to assess a sensory threshold of the vibrissal system for a moving harbour seal under near-natural conditions. Furthermore, this threshold was defined for a natural type of stimulus differing from classical dipole stimuli which have been widely used in threshold determination so far.",2017,10.1242/jeb.158055,220,13,2364-2371,NA,Vibrissae; Sensory system; Benthic fish; Hydrodynamic stimulus; Pinniped; Signal-to-noise ratio

Dietary fat has lower SDA than other macronutrients. Here we tested the effects of graded dietary fat levels on lactating Swiss mice. We fed females five diets varying in fat content from 8.3 to 66.6\%. Offspring of mothers fed diets of 41.7\% fat and above were heavier and fatter at weaning compared with those of 8.3 and 25\% fat diets. Mice on dietary fat contents of 41.7\% and above had greater metabolizable energy intake at peak lactation (8.3\%: 229.4 +/- 39.6; 25\%: 278.8 +/- 25.8; 41.7\%: 359.6 +/- 51.5; 58.3\%: 353.7 +/- 43.6; 66.6\%: 346 +/- 44.7 kJ day(-1)), lower daily energy expenditure (8.3\%: 128.5 +/- 16; 25\%: 131.6 +/- 8.4; 41.7\%: 124.4 +/- 10.8; 58.3\%: 115.1 +/- 10.5; 66.6\%: 111.2 +/- 11.5 kJ day-1) and thus delivered more milk energy to their offspring (8.3\%: 100.8 +/- 27.3; 25\%: 147.2 +/- 25.1; 41.7\%: 225.1 +/- 49.6; 58.3\%: 238.6 +/- 40.1; 66.6\%: 234.8 +/- 41.1 kJ day(-1)). Milk fat content (\%) was unrelated to dietary fat content, indicating that females on higher fat diets (>41.7\%) produced more rather than richer milk. Mothers consuming diets with 41.7\% fat or above enhanced their lactation performance compared with those on 25\% or less, probably by diverting dietary fat directly into the milk, thereby avoiding the costs of lipogenesis. At dietary fat contents above 41.7\% they were either unable to transfer more dietary fat to the milk, or they chose not to do so, potentially because of a lack of benefit to the offspring that were increasingly fatter as maternal dietary fat increased.",2020,10.1242/jeb.221911,223,10,NA,jeb221911,Asymptotic food intake; Graded dietary fat levels; Heat dissipation limitation; Laboratory mouse; Milk production

For example, female tungara frogs and fringelipped bats generally rely on acoustic mating signals to find male tu ` ngara frogs in a mating or foraging context, respectively. However, two additional cues (vocal sac inflation and water ripples) can enhance detection and choice behavior. To date, we do not know the natural variation and covariation of these three components. To address this, we made detailed recordings of calling males, including call amplitude, vocal sac volume and water ripple height, in 54 frogs (2430 calls). We found that all three measures correlated, with the strongest association between the vocal sac volume and call amplitude. We also found that multimodal models predicted the mass of calling males better than unimodal models. These results demonstrate how multimodal components of acommunication system relate to each other and provide an important foundation for future studies on how receivers integrate and compare complex displays.",2021,10.1242/jeb.241661,224,12,NA,jeb241661,Acoustics; Foraging; Mate choice; Multimodal communication; Sexual selection
article,Friend or foe? Effects of host immune activation on the gut microbiome in the caterpillar <i>Manduca sexta</i>,"McMillan, Laura E. and Adamo, Shelley A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"For many animals, the gut microbiome plays an essential role in immunity and digestion. However, certain animals, such as the caterpillar Manduca sexta, do not have a resident gut microbiome. Although these animals do have bacteria that pass through their gut from their natural environment, the absence of such bacteria does not reduce growth or survival. We hypothesized that M. sexta would sterilize their gut as a protective measure against secondary infection when faced with a gut infection or exposure to heat-killed bacteria in the blood (haemolymph). However, we found that gut sterilization did not occur during either type of immune challenge, i.e. bacterial numbers did not decrease. By examining the pattern of immune-related gene expression, gut pH, live bacterial counts and mass change (as a measure of sickness behaviour), we found evidence for physiological trade-offs between regulating the microbiome and defending against systemic infections. Caterpillars exposed to both gut pathogens and a systemic immune challenge had higher numbers of bacteria in their gut than caterpillars exposed to a single challenge. Following a multivariate analysis of variance, we found that the response patterns following an oral challenge, systemic challenge or dual challenge were unique. Our results suggest that the immune response for each challenge resulted in a different configuration of the immunophysiological network. We hypothesize that these different configurations represent different resolutions of physiological tradeoffs based on the immune responses needed to best protect the animal against the present immune challenges.",2020,10.1242/jeb.226662,223,19,NA,jeb226662,Ecoimmunology; Microbiome regulation; Physiological networks; Lepidopteran
article,Amphibious fish `get a jump' on terrestrial locomotor performance after exercise training on land,"McFarlane, William and Rossi, Giulia S. and Wright, Patricia A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Many amphibious fishes rely on terrestrial locomotion to accomplish essential daily tasks, but it is unknown whether terrestrial exercise improves the locomotor performance of fishes on land. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that terrestrial exercise improves locomotion in amphibious fishes out of water as a result of skeletal muscle remodeling. We compared the jumping performance of Kryptolebias marmoratus before and after an exercise training regimen, and assessed the muscle phenotype of control and exercise-trained fish. We found that exercise-trained fish jumped 41\% farther and 48\% more times before reaching exhaustion. Furthermore, exercise training resulted in the hypertrophy of red muscle fibers, and an increase in red muscle capillarity and aerobic capacity. Lactate accumulation after jumping indicates that white muscle is also important in powering terrestrial jumps. Overall, skeletal muscle in K. marmoratus is highly responsive to terrestrial exercise, and muscle plasticity may assist in the effective exploitation of terrestrial habitats by amphibious fishes.",2019,10.1242/jeb.213348,222,20,NA,jeb213348,Skeletal muscle; Red oxidative muscle; Lactate; Angiogenesis; Tail-flip jumping; Mitochondrial content
article,Wavelength-specific negatively phototactic responses of the burrowing mayfly larvae<i> Ephoron virgo</i>,"Meszaros, Adam and Kriska, Gyorgy and Egri, Adam",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Mayflies are typically negatively phototactic during larval development, whereas the adults possess positive phototaxis. However, no extensive research has been done into the wavelength dependence of phototaxis in any mayfly larvae. We measured the repellency rate of Ephoron virgo larvae to light as a function of wavelength in the 368-743 nm spectral range. We established that the magnitude of repellence increased with decreasing wavelength and the maximal responses were elicited by 400 nm violet light. This wavelength dependence of phototaxis is similar to the recently reported spectral sensitivity of positive phototaxis of the twilightswarming E. virgo adults. Negative phototaxis not only facilitates predation evasion: avoidance of the blue-violet spectral range could also promote the larvae to withdraw towards the river midline in the case of a drop in the water level, when the underwater light becomes enriched with shorter wavelengths as a result of the decreasing depth of overhead river water.",2024,10.1242/jeb.247142,227,10,NA,247142,Visual ecology; Insect vision; Spectral sensitivity; Phototaxis; Nymph
article,A sensation for inflation: initial swim bladder inflation in larval zebrafish is mediated by the mechanosensory lateral line,"Venuto, Alexandra and Thibodeau-Beganny, Stacey and Trapani, Josef G. and Erickson, Timothy",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Larval zebrafish achieve neutral buoyancy by swimming up to the surface and taking in air through their mouths to inflate their swim bladders. We define this behavior as `surfacing'. Little is known about the sensory basis for this underappreciated behavior of larval fish. A strong candidate is the mechanosensory lateral line, a hair cell-based sensory system that detects hydrodynamic information from sources such as water currents, predators, prey and surface waves. However, a role for the lateral line in mediating initial inflation of the swim bladder has not been reported. To explore the connection between the lateral line and surfacing, we used a genetic mutant (lhfpl5b-/-) that renders the zebrafish lateral line insensitive to mechanical stimuli. We observed that approximately half of these lateral line mutants over-inflate their swim bladders during initial inflation and become positively buoyant. Thus, we hypothesized that larval zebrafish use their lateral line to moderate interactions with the air-water interface during surfacing to regulate swim bladder inflation. To test the hypothesis that lateral line defects are responsible for swim bladder over-inflation, we showed that exogenous air is required for the hyperinflation phenotype and transgenic rescue of hair cell function restores normal inflation. We also found that chemical ablation of anterior lateral line hair cells in wild-type larvae causes hyperinflation. Furthermore, we show that manipulation of lateral line sensory information results in abnormal inflation. Finally, we report spatial and temporal differences in the surfacing behavior between wild-type and lateral line mutant larvae. In summary, we propose a novel sensory basis for achieving neutral buoyancy where larval zebrafish use their lateral line to sense the air-water interface and regulate initial swim bladder inflation.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245635,226,11,NA,jeb245635,Behavior; Buoyancy; Hair cells; Hydrodynamics; Lateral line; Lhfpl5; Swim bladder; Sensory system; Zebrafish

Therefore, many studies rely on motility-based survival scoring and quantifying reproductive success. Measurements of O-2 respiration rates, as an integrating expression of the metabolic activity of single tardigrades, would provide a more comprehensive insight into how an individual tardigrade is responding to specific environmental factors or changes in life stages. Here, we present and validate a new method for determining the O-2 respiration rate (nmol O-2 mg(-1) h(-1)) of single tardigrades under steady state, using O-2 microsensors. As an example, we show that the O-2 respiration rate determined in MilliQ water for individuals of Richtersius coronifer and of Macrobiotus macrocalix at 22 degrees C was 10.8 +/- 1.84 and 13.1 +/- 2.19 nmol O-2 mg(-1) h(-1) , respectively.",2020,10.1242/jeb.233072,223,22,NA,jeb233072,Energetics; O-2 respiration rate; Metabolism; Tardigrada
article,Prey fish escape by sensing the bow wave of a predator,"Stewart, William J. and Nair, Arjun and Jiang, Houshuo and McHenry, Matthew J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Prey fish possess a remarkable ability to sense and evade an attack from a larger fish. Despite the importance of these events to the biology of fishes, it remains unclear how sensory cues stimulate an effective evasive maneuver. Here, we show that larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) evade predators using an escape response that is stimulated by the water flow generated by an approaching predator. Measurements of the high-speed responses of larvae in the dark to a robotic predator suggest that larvae respond to the subtle flows in front of the predator using the lateral line system. This flow, known as the bow wave, was visualized and modeled with computational fluid dynamics. According to the predictions of the model, larvae direct their escape away from the side of their body exposed to more rapid flow. This suggests that prey fish use a flow reflex that enables predator evasion by generating a directed maneuver at high speed. These findings demonstrate a sensory-motor mechanism that underlies a behavior that is crucial to the ecology and evolution of fishes.",2014,10.1242/jeb.111773,217,24,4328-4336,NA,Biomechanics; Lateral line; Flow sensing; Predation; Particle image velocimetry; Computational flow dynamics
article,<i>Portia</i>'s capacity to decide whether a detour is necessary,"Cross, Fiona R. and Jackson, Robert R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Proficiency at planning is known to be part of the exceptionally complex predatory repertoire of Portia, a genus of jumping spiders (Salticidae) that specialize in preying on other spiders. This includes proficiency at choosing between two detour routes, with only one leading to otherwise inaccessible prey. Less is known about Portia's proficiency at making strategic decisions pertaining to whether a detour is required or not. Using Portia africana, we investigated this by having lures (prey or leaf pieces) visible at the beginning of a trial but not later, and by using water to restrict P. africana's freedom of movement. A detour path was always present, but sometimes a causeway was also present, allowing direct access to lures. After seeing prey, P. africana more often took the causeway when present and, when absent, more often took the detour path.

article,Conspecific chemical cues drive density-dependent metabolic suppression independently of resource intake,"Lovass, Melanie K. and Marshall, Dustin J. and Ghedini, Giulia",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Within species, individuals of the same size can vary substantially in their metabolic rate. One source of variation in metabolism is conspecific density - individuals in denser populations may have lower metabolism than those in sparser populations. However, the mechanisms through which conspecifics drive metabolic suppression remain unclear. Although food competition is a potential driver, other density-mediated factors could act independently or in combination to drive metabolic suppression, but these drivers have rarely been investigated. We used sessile marine invertebrates to test how food availability interacts with oxygen availability, water flow and chemical cues to affect metabolism. We show that conspecific chemical cues induce metabolic suppression independently of food and this metabolic reduction is associated with the downregulation of physiological processes rather than feeding activity. Conspecific cues should be considered when predicting metabolic variation and competitive outcomes as they are an important, but underexplored, source of variation in metabolic traits.",2020,10.1242/jeb.224824,223,17,NA,jeb224824,Metabolic variation; Population density dependence; Metabolic reduction; Competition; Energy flux
article,Regulation ofthe swimming kinematics oflampreys Petromyzon marinusacross changes in viscosity,"Tytell, Eric D. and Cooper, Lauren O. and Lin, Yuexia Luna and Reis, Pedro M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The bodies of most swimming fishes are very flexible and deform as result of both external fluid dynamic forces and internal musculoskeletal forces. If fluid forces change, the body motion will also change unless the fish senses the change and alters its muscle activity to compensate. Lampreys and other fishes have mechanosensory cells in their spinal cords that allow them to sense how their body is bending. We hypothesized that lampreys (Petromyzon marinus) actively regulate body curvature to maintain a fairly constant swimming waveform even as swimming speed and fluid dynamic forces change. To test this hypothesis, we measured the steady swimming kinematics of lampreys swimming in normal water, and water in which the viscosity was increased by 10 or 20 times by adding methylcellulose. Increasing the viscosity over this range increases the drag coefficient, potentially increasing fluid forces up to 40\%. Previous computational results suggested that if lampreys did not compensate for these forces, the swimming speed would drop by about 52\%, the amplitude would drop by 39\%, and posterior body curvature would increase by about 31\%, while tail beat frequency would remain the same. Five juvenile sea lampreys were filmed swimming through still water, and midlines were digitized using standard techniques. Although swimming speed dropped by 44\% from 1x to 10x viscosity, amplitude only decreased by 4\%, and curvature increased by 7\%, a much smaller change than the amount we estimated if there was no compensation. To examine the waveform overall, we performed a complex orthogonal decomposition and found that the first mode of the swimming waveform (the primary swimming pattern) did not change substantially, even at 20x viscosity. Thus, it appears that lampreys are compensating, at least partially, for the changes in viscosity, which in turn suggests that sensory feedback is involved in regulating the body waveform.",2023,10.1242/jeb.2457,226,9,NA,jeb24\~{}57,Anguilliform swimming; Body waveform; Fluid dynamic forces; Proprioception
article,Insights from venous oxygen profiles: oxygen utilization and management in diving California sea lions,"McDonald, Birgitte I. and Ponganis, Paul J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The management and depletion of O-2 stores underlie the aerobic dive capacities of marine mammals. The California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) presumably optimizes O-2 store management during all dives, but approaches its physiological limits during deep dives to greater than 300. m depth. Blood O-2 comprises the largest component of total body O-2 stores in adult sea lions. Therefore, we investigated venous blood O-2 depletion during dives of California sea lions during maternal foraging trips to sea by: (1) recording venous partial pressure of O-2 (PO2) profiles during dives, (2) characterizing the O-2-hemoglobin (Hb) dissociation curve of sea lion Hb and (3) converting the PO2 profiles into percent Hb saturation (SO2) profiles using the dissociation curve. The O-2-Hb dissociation curve was typical of other pinnipeds (P-50=28 +/- 2mmHg at pH 7.4). In 43\% of dives, initial venous SO2 values were greater than 78\% (estimated resting venous SO2), indicative of arterialization of venous blood. Blood O-2 was far from depleted during routine shallow dives, with minimum venous SO2 values routinely greater than 50\%. However, in deep dives greater than 4. min in duration, venous SO2 reached minimum values below 5\% prior to the end of the dive, but then increased during the last 30-60s of ascent. These deep dive profiles were consistent with transient venous blood O-2 depletion followed by partial restoration of venous O-2 through pulmonary gas exchange and peripheral blood flow during ascent. These differences in venous O-2 profiles between shallow and deep dives of sea lions reflect distinct strategies of O-2 store management and suggest that underlying cardiovascular responses will also differ.",2013,10.1242/jeb.085985,216,17,3332-3341,NA,blood oxygen depletion; dive; hemoglobin saturation; oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve; P-O2; P-50

The respiratory mechanics of juvenile caiman were additionally measured while the animals were floating in water and submerged at 30, 60 and 90 deg to the water's surface. The static compliance of the juvenile pulmonary system (2.89 +/- 0.22 ml cmH(2)O(-1) 100 g(-1)) was greater than that of adults (1.2 +/- 0.41 ml cmH(2)O(-1) 100 g(-1)), suggesting that the system stiffens as the body wall becomes more muscular and keratinized in adults.

The strength of this link is determined by suspension-feeding rates. Many studies have measured suspension-feeding rates using indirect clearance-rate methods, which are based on the depletion of suspended particles. Direct methods that measure the flow of water itself are less common, but they can be more broadly applied because, unlike indirect methods, direct methods are not affected by properties of the cleared particles. We present pumping rates for three species of suspension feeders, the clams Mya arenaria and Mercenaria mercenaria and the tunicate Ciona intestinalis, measured using a direct method based on particle image velocimetry (PIV). Past uses of PIV in suspension-feeding studies have been limited by strong laser reflections that interfere with velocity measurements proximate to the siphon. We used a new approach based on fitting PIV-based velocity profile measurements to theoretical profiles from computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models, which allowed us to calculate inhalant siphon Reynolds numbers (Re). We used these inhalant Re and measurements of siphon diameters to calculate exhalant Re, pumping rates, and mean inlet and outlet velocities. For the three species studied, inhalant Re ranged from 8 to 520, and exhalant Re ranged from 15 to 1073. Volumetric pumping rates ranged from 1.7 to 7.4 l h(-1) for M. arenaria, 0.3 to 3.6 l h(-1) for M. mercenaria and 0.07 to 0.97 l h(-1) for C. intestinalis.

While carbon and nitrogen are ultimately derived from a single source (food), the proportion of hydrogen in consumer tissues originates from two distinct sources: body water and food. Before hydrogen isotopes can be effectively used as a resource and habitat tracer, we need estimates of (net) discrimination factors (Delta H-2(Net)) that account for the physiologically mediated differences in the delta H-2 values of animal tissues relative to that of the food and water sources they use to synthesize tissues. Here, we estimated Delta H-2(Net) in captive green turtles (Chelonia mydas) by measuring the delta H-2 values of tissues (epidermis and blood components) and dietary macromolecules collected in two controlled feeding experiments. Tissue delta H-2 and Delta H-2(Net) values varied systematically among tissues, with epidermis having higher delta H-2 and Delta H-2(Net) values than blood components, which mirrors patterns between keratinaceous tissues (feathers, hair) and blood in birds and mammals. Serum/plasma of adult female green turtles had significantly lower delta H-2 values compared with juveniles, likely due to increased lipid mobilization associated with reproduction. This is the first study to quantify Delta H-2(Net) values in a marine ectotherm, and we anticipate that our results will further refine the use of delta H-2 analysis to better understand animal resource and habitat use in marine ecosystems, especially coastal areas fueled by a combination of marine (e.g. micro/macroalgae and seagrass) and terrestrial (e.g. mangroves) primary production.",2021,10.1242/jeb.231431,224,7,NA,jeb231431,Hydrogen isotope; Trophic discrimination factor; Controlled feeding experiment; Stable isotope analysis; Chelonia mydas

Here, we used biomedical imaging to examine lung oxygen stores and other key respiratory parameters in living ringed seals (Pusa hispida). Three-dimensional models created from computed tomography (CT) images were used to quantify total lung capacity (TLC), respiratory dead space, minimum air volume and total body volume to improve assessment of lung oxygen storage capacity, scaling relationships and buoyant force estimates. The results suggest that lung oxygen stores determined in vivo are smaller than those derived from postmortem measurements. We also demonstrate that, whereas established allometric relationships hold well for most pinnipeds, these relationships consistently overestimate TLC for the smallest phocid seal. Finally, measures of total body volume reveal differences in body density and net vertical forces in the water column that influence costs associated with diving and foraging in free-ranging seals.",2021,10.1242/jeb.235507,224,2,NA,jeb235507,Pusa hispida; Buoyancy; Computed tomography; Diving physiology; Total lung capacity
article,Reduced non-bicarbonate skeletal muscle buffering capacity in mice with the mini-muscle phenotype,"Kay, Jarren C. and Ramirez, Jocelyn and Contreras, Erick and Garland, Jr., Theodore",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Muscle pH decreases during exercise, which may impair function. Endurance training typically reduces muscle buffering capacity as a result of changes in fiber-type composition, but existing comparisons of species that vary in activity level are ambiguous. We hypothesized that high-runner (HR) lines of mice from an experiment that breeds mice for voluntary wheel running would have altered muscle buffering capacity as compared with their non-selected control counterparts. We also expected that 6 days of wheel access, as used in the selection protocol, would reduce buffering capacity, especially for HR mice. Finally, we expected a subset of HR mice with the `mini-muscle' phenotype to have relatively low buffering capacity as a result of fewer type IIb fibers. We tested non-bicarbonate buffering capacity of thigh muscles. Only HR mice expressing the mini-muscle phenotype had significantly reduced buffering capacity, females had lower buffering capacity than males, and wheel access had no significant effect.",2018,10.1242/jeb.172478,221,10,NA,jeb172478,Artificial selection; Buffering capacity; Endurance; Voluntary exercise; Skeletal muscle; Wheel running

Here, we use the scanning ion-selective microelectrode technique to measure efflux and influx of K+, H+, Na+ and Ca2+ in intact worms. Transport of ions into, or out of, immobilized worms produces small gradients in ion concentration in the unstirred layer near the surface of the worm. These gradients are readily detectable with ion-selective microelectrodes and the corresponding ion fluxes can be estimated using the Fick equation. Our data show that effluxes of K+, H+, Na+ and Ca2+ are localized to the region of the excretory pore, consistent with release of these ions from the excretory cell, and that effluxes increase after experimental preloading with Na+, K+ or Ca2+. In addition, the hypodermis is a site of Na+ influx.",2014,10.1242/jeb.112441,217,23,4119-4122,NA,Nematode; Excretory cell; Hypodermis; Ion-selective microelectrodes
article,Early exposure to UV radiation causes telomere shortening and poorer condition later in life,"Lundsgaard, Niclas U. and Cramp, Rebecca L. and Franklin, Craig E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Determining the contribution of elevated ultraviolet-B radiation (UVBR; 280-315 nm) to amphibian population declines is being hindered by a lack of knowledge about how different acute UVBR exposure regimes during early life-history stages might affect post-metamorphic stages via long-term carryover effects. We acutely exposed tadpoles of the Australian green tree frog (Litoria caerulea) to a combination of different UVBR irradiances and doses in a multifactorial laboratory experiment, and then reared them to metamorphosis in the absence of UVBR to assess carryover effects in subsequent juvenile frogs. Dose and irradiance of acute UVBR exposure influenced carryover effects into metamorphosis in somewhat opposing manners. Higher doses of UVBR exposure in larvae yielded improved rates of metamorphosis. However, exposure at a high irradiance resulted in frogs metamorphosing smaller in size and in poorer condition than frogs exposed to low and medium irradiance UVBR as larvae. We also demonstrate some of the first empirical evidence of UVBR-induced telomere shortening in vivo, which is one possible mechanism for life-history trade-offs impacting condition post-metamorphosis. These findings contribute to our understanding of how acute UVBR exposure regimes in early life affect later life-history stages, which has implications for how this stressor may shape population dynamics.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243924,225,17,NA,jeb243924,Amphibian; Carryover effect; Irradiance; Life-history trade-off; Telomere length; Ultraviolet radiation
article,Spectral sensitivity of retinal photoreceptors of tortricid moths is not tuned to diel activity period,"Martin-Gabarrella, Alejandro and Gemeno, Cesar and Belusic, Gregor",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Leafrollers (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) are a large family of small moths containing over 10,000 species, many of which are crop pests. Grapholita molesta, Lobesia botrana and Cydia pomonella adults are sexually active before, during and after sunset, respectively. We wanted to determine whether being active at different times of the day and night is associated with differences in their visual system. Spectral sensitivity (SS) was measured with electroretinograms and selective adaptation with green, blue and ultraviolet light. SS curves could be fitted with a triple nomogram template which indicated the existence of three photoreceptor classes peaking at 355, 440 and 525 nm. The retinae showed clear regionalization, with fewer blue receptors dorsally. No differences among species or between sexes were found. Intracellular recordings in C. pomonella also revealed three photoreceptor classes with sensitivities peaking at 355, 440 and 525 nm. The blue photoreceptors showed inhibitory responses in the green part of the spectrum, indicating the presence of a colour-opponent system. Flicker fusion frequency experiments showed that the response speed was similar between sexes and species and fused at around 100 Hz. Our results indicate that the three species have the ancestral insect retinal substrate for a trichromatic colour vision, based upon the UV, blue and green-sensitive photoreceptors, and lack any prominent adaptations related to being active under different light conditions.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245461,226,15,NA,jeb245461,Tortricidae; Electroretinography; Temporal resolution; Colour vision; Diel activity
article,Intermittent hypoxia leads to functional reorganization of mitochondria and affects cellular bioenergetics in marine molluscs,"Ivanina, Anna V. and Nesmelova, Irina and Leamy, Larry and Sokolov, Eugene P. and Sokolova, Inna M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Fluctuations in oxygen (O-2) concentrations represent a major challenge to aerobic organisms and can be extremely damaging to their mitochondria. Marine intertidal molluscs are well-adapted to frequent O-2 fluctuations, yet it remains unknown how their mitochondrial functions are regulated to sustain energy metabolism and prevent cellular damage during hypoxia and reoxygenation (H/R). We used metabolic control analysis to investigate the mechanisms of mitochondrial responses to H/R stress (18 h at <0.1\% O-2 followed by 1 h of reoxygenation) using hypoxia-tolerant intertidal clams Mercenaria mercenaria and hypoxia-sensitive subtidal scallops Argopecten irradians as models. We also assessed H/R-induced changes in cellular energy balance, oxidative damage and unfolded protein response to determine the potential links between mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular injury. Mitochondrial responses to H/R in scallops strongly resembled those in other hypoxia-sensitive organisms. Exposure to hypoxia followed by reoxygenation led to a strong decrease in the substrate oxidation (SOX) and phosphorylation (PHOS) capacities as well as partial depolarization of mitochondria of scallops. Elevated mRNA expression of a reactive oxygen species-sensitive enzyme aconitase and Lon protease (responsible for degradation of oxidized mitochondrial proteins) during H/R stress was consistent with elevated levels of oxidative stress in mitochondria of scallops. In hypoxia-tolerant clams, mitochondrial SOX capacity was enhanced during hypoxia and continued rising during the first hour of reoxygenation. In both species, the mitochondrial PHOS capacity was suppressed during hypoxia, likely to prevent ATP wastage by the reverse action of F-O,F-1-ATPase. The PHOS capacity recovered after 1 h of reoxygenation in clams but not in scallops. Compared with scallops, clams showed a greater suppression of energy-consuming processes (such as protein turnover and ion transport) during hypoxia, indicated by inactivation of the translation initiation factor EIF-2 alpha, suppression of 26S proteasome activity and a dramatic decrease in the activity of Na+/K+-ATPase. The steady-state levels of adenylates were preserved during H/R exposure and AMP-dependent protein kinase was not activated in either species, indicating that the H/R exposure did not lead to severe energy deficiency. Taken together, our findings suggest that mitochondrial reorganizations sustaining high oxidative phosphorylation flux during recovery, combined with the ability to suppress ATP-demanding cellular functions during hypoxia, may contribute to high resilience of clams to H/R stress and help maintain energy homeostasis during frequent H/R cycles in the intertidal zone.",2016,10.1242/jeb.134700,219,11,1659-1674,NA,Hypoxia; Metabolic control analysis; Mitochondria; Phosphorylation; Proton leak; Substrate oxidation
article,The neuropeptide CCHamide2 regulates diuresis in the Chagas disease vector <i>Rhodnius prolixus</i>,"Capriotti, Natalia and Lanowski, Juan P. and Gioino, Paula and Ons, Sheila",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Given that hematophagous insects ingest large quantities of blood in a single meal, they must undergo a rapid post-prandial diuresis in order to maintain homeostasis. In the kissing bug Rhodnius prolixus (Hemiptera: Reduviidae), the coordinated activity of the Malpighian tubules and anterior midgutmaintains water and ion balance during the post-prandial diuresis. Three to four hours after the meal, the diuretic process finishes, and the animal enters an antidiuretic state to ensure water conservation until the next blood intake. The diuretic and antidiuretic processes are tightly regulated by serotonin and neuropeptides in this insect. In the present work, we report that the neuropeptide precursor CCHamide2 is involved in the regulation of the post-prandial diuresis in R. prolixus. Our results suggest a dual effect of RhoprCCHamide2 peptide, enhancing the serotonin-induced secretion by Malpighian tubules, and inhibiting serotonin-induced absorption across the anterior midgut. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a hormone presenting opposite effects in the two osmoregulatory organs (i.e. midgut and Malpighian tubules) in insects, probably reflecting the importance of a well-tuned diuretic process in hematophagous insects during different moments after the blood meal.",2019,10.1242/jeb.203000,222,10,NA,jeb203000,Insect; Anterior midgut; Malpighian tubules; Kissing bug; Hematophagy
article,Mechanosensory signaling as a potential mode of communication during social interactions in fishes,"Butler, Julie M. and Maruska, Karen P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Signals produced during social interactions convey crucial information about the sender's identity, quality, reproductive state and social status. Fishes can detect near-body water movements via the mechanosensory lateral line system, and this sense is used during several common fish behaviors, such as schooling, rheotaxis and predator-prey interactions. In addition, many fish behaviors, such as aggressive lateral displays and reproductive body quivers, involve fin and body motions that generate water movements that can be detected by the lateral line system of nearby fish. This mechanosensory system is well studied for its role in obstacle avoidance and detection of inadvertent hydrodynamic cues generated during schooling and predator-prey interactions; however, little research has focused on the role of mechanosensory communication during social interactions. Here, we summarize the current literature on the use of mechanosensation-mediated behaviors during agonistic and reproductive encounters, as well as during parental care. Based on these studies, we hypothesize that mechanosensory signaling is an important but often overlooked mode of communication during conspecific social interactions in many fish species, and we highlight its importance during multimodal communication. Finally, we suggest potential avenues of future research that would allow us to better understand the role of mechanosensation in fish communication.",2016,10.1242/jeb.133801,219,18,2781-2789,NA,Behavior; Communication; Lateral line; Mechanoreception; Multimodal signaling; Teleost

To measure turning performance in a three-dimensional space for the manta ray (Mobula birostris), a large open-water swimmer, scaled stereo video recordings were collected. Movements of the cephalic lobes, eye and tail base were tracked to obtain three-dimensional coordinates. A mathematical analysis was performed on the coordinate data to calculate the turning rate and curvature (1/turning radius) as a function of time by numerically estimating the derivative of manta trajectories through three-dimensional space. Principal component analysis was used to project the three-dimensional trajectory onto the two-dimensional turn. Smoothing splines were applied to these turns. These are flexible models that minimize a cost function with a parameter controlling the balance between data fidelity and regularity of the derivative. Data for 30 sequences of rays performing slow, steady turns showed the highest 20\% of values for the turning rate and smallest 20\% of turn radii were 42.65 +/- 16.66 deg s(-1) and 2.05 +/- 1.26 m, respectively.

article,Shell damage leads to enhanced memory formation in <i>Lymnaea</i>,"Swinton, Erin and Swinton, Cayley and Lukowiak, Ken",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Ecologically relevant stressors alter the ability of the pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis, to form long-term memory (LTM). Here, we show that an environmentally relevant stressor, shell damage, has a dramatic effect on the enhancement of LTM formation. Damage in the form of a shell clip 24 h before operant conditioning training resulted in long-term memory (LTM) formation following a single 0.5 h training session (TS). Typically, in these snails, two 0.5 h TSs with a 1 h interval between the sessions are required to cause LTM formation. We show here that even with a 72 h interval between shell clip and training, memory enhancement still occurred. The stress associated with shell clip could be mitigated by an ongoing high-Ca2+ pond water environment, an injection of propranolol and a DNA methylation blocker. However, use of an anaesthetic (MgCl2) during the clip or intermittent exposure to the high-Ca2+ pond water environment did not mitigate the stress associated with the shell clip. Shell clip was also sufficient to cause juvenile snails, which neither learn nor form memory, to gain the capacity to form LTM. Together, the experiments demonstrate that shell clipping is an environmentally relevant stressor that can cause enhancement of LTM formation.",2019,10.1242/jeb.207571,222,17,NA,jeb207571,Enhancement of memory formation; Shell clip; Lymnaea; Propranolol; Emotional memory

In the present study, we describe the attachment structures of the water-lily leaf beetle Galerucella nymphaeae and test the hypothesis that the larval and adult stages generate the strongest attachment on surfaces with contact angles that are similar to those of leaves of their host plants. The larvae bear a smooth attachment system with arolium-like structures at their legs and a pygopodium at the abdomen tip. Adults have pointed setae on the ventral side of the two proximal tarsomeres and densely arranged spatula-shaped ones on their third tarsomere. In a centrifugal force tester, larvae and adults attained the highest friction forces and safety factors on surfaces with a water contact angle of 83 deg compared to those of 6, 26 and 109 deg. This comes close to the contact angle of their host plant Nuphar lutea (86 deg). The similarity in larval and adult performances might be a result of the similar chemical composition of their attachment fluid.

Glycogen abundance in NKA-rich cells was lower in starved sharks compared with 24 h post-fed sharks, reflecting higher energy demand for acid secretion during normal activity and glycogen replenishment during the post-feeding period. Conversely, glycogen abundance in VHA-rich cells was high in starved sharks and it became depleted post-feeding. Furthermore, inactive cells with cytoplasmic VHA had large glycogen stores and active cells with basolateral VHA had depleted glycogen stores.

article,"Polarization sensitivity as a visual contrast enhancer in the Emperor dragonfly larva, <i>Anax imperator</i>","Sharkey, Camilla R. and Partridge, Julian C. and Roberts, Nicholas W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Polarization sensitivity (PS) is acommon feature of invertebrate visual systems. In insects, PS is well known for its use in several different visually guided behaviours, particularly navigation and habitat search. Adult dragonflies use the polarization of light to find water but a role for PS in aquatic dragonfly larvae, a stage that inhabits a very different photic environment to the adults, has not been investigated. The optomotor response of the larvae of the Emperor dragonfly, Anax imperator Leach 1815, was used to determine whether these larvae use PS to enhance visual contrast underwater. Two different light scattering conditions were used to surround the larval animals: a naturalistic horizontally polarized light field and a non-naturalistic weakly polarized light field. In both cases these scattering light fields obscured moving intensity stimuli that provoke an optokinetic response in the larvae. Animals were shown to track the movement of a square-wave grating more closely when it was viewed through the horizontally polarized light field, equivalent to a similar increase in tracking ability observed in response to an 8\% increase in the intensity contrast of the stimuli. Our results suggest that larval PS enhances the intensity contrast of a visual scene under partially polarized lighting conditions that occur naturally in freshwater environments.",2015,10.1242/jeb.122507,218,21,3399-3405,NA,Polarization vision; Optomotor response; Turbidity; Rayleigh scattering; Odonata
article,Finding the peak of dynamic oxygen uptake during fatiguing exercise in fish,"Zhang, Yangfan and Gilbert, Matthew J. H. and Farrell, Anthony P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"As fish approach fatigue at high water velocities in a critical swimming speed (U-crit) test, their swimming mode and oxygen cascade typically move to an unsteady state because they adopt an unsteady, burst-and-glide swimming mode despite a constant, imposed workload. However, conventional rate of oxygen uptake ((M) over dotO(2)) sampling intervals (5-20 min) tend to smooth any dynamic fluctuations in active (M) over dotO(2) ((M) over dotO(2active)) and thus likely underestimate the peak (M) over dotO(2active). Here, we used rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to explore the dynamic nature of (M) over dotO(2active) near U-crit using various sampling windows and an iterative algorithm. Compared with a conventional interval regression analysis of (M) over dotO(2active) over a 10-min period, our new analytical approach generated a 23\% higher peak (M) over dotO(2active). Therefore, we suggest that accounting for such dynamics in (M) over dotO(2active) with this new analytical approach may lead to more accurate estimates of maximum (M) over dotO(2) in fishes.",2019,10.1242/jeb.196568,222,12,NA,jeb196568,Active oxygen uptake; Iterative algorithm; Swimming; Respirometry; Maximal exercise; Maximum rate of oxygen uptake

The extraction of directional information from this sky -wide cue is mediated by specialised photoreceptors located in the dorsal rim area (DRA). While this part of the eye is known to be sensitive to the ultraviolet, blue or green component of skylight, the latter has only been observed in insects active in dim light. To address the functional significance of green polarisation sensitivity, we define the spectral and morphological adaptations of the DRA in a nocturnal ball -rolling dung beetle-the only family of insects demonstrated to orient to the dim polarisation pattern in the night sky. Intracellular recordings revealed polarisation -sensitive green photoreceptors in the DRA of Escarabaeus satyrus. Behavioural experiments verified the navigational relevance of this finding. To quantify the adaptive value of green sensitivity for celestial orientation at night, we also obtained the polarisation properties of the night sky in the natural habitat of the beetle. Calculations of relative photon catch revealed that under a moonlit sky the green -sensitive DRA photoreceptors can be expected to catch an order of magnitude more photons compared with the UV -sensitive photoreceptors in the main retina.

To elucidate the mechanism of host manipulation, revealing the origin and function of the invoked actions is essential. Our study focused on the ichneumonid spider ectoparasitoid Reclinervellus nielseni, which turns its host spider (Cyclosa argenteoalba) into a drugged navvy, to modify the web structure into a more persistent cocoon web so that the wasp can pupate safely on this web after the spider's death. We focused on whether the cocoon web originated from the resting web that an unparasitized spider builds before moulting, by comparing web structures, building behaviour and silk spectral/tensile properties. We found that both resting and cocoon webs have reduced numbers of radii decorated by numerous fibrous threads and specific decorating behaviour was identical, suggesting that the cocoon web in this system has roots in the innate resting web and ecdysteroid-related components may be responsible for the manipulation. We also show that these decorations reflect UV light, possibly to prevent damage by flying web-destroyers such as birds or large insects. Furthermore, the tensile test revealed that the spider is induced to repeat certain behavioural steps in addition to resting web construction so that many more threads are laid down for web reinforcement.",2015,10.1242/jeb.122739,218,15,2326-2332,NA,Cocoon web; Cyclosa argenteoalba; Fibrous thread decoration (FTD); Reclinervellus nielseni; Resting web; Tensile test

Our previous investigations in the crab Neohelice led to an adaptation of the affective extension of sometimes opponent generate separate emotive memory traces, and that the unfolding of emotional responses is a crucial component of the behavioral expression of reactivated memories. Here, we show that an aversive conditioning, that used changes in an innate escape response to an aversive visual stimulus, induced an emotional behavior that endured beyond the stimuli: the aversive memory training built an anxiety-like state evaluated in a dark/light plus-maze. We found that, after the training session, crabs displayed aversion to maze light areas, and an increased time immobilized in the dark zones of the maze, an anxiety-like behavior induced by stressors or physiological conditions in other crustaceans. The trainingdependent anxiety-like behavior was blocked by pretraining administration of fluoxetine, suggesting an underlying serotonindependent phenomenon.

ATP was the most effective phagostimulant in adults and nymphs, resulting in >70\% of bed bugs fully engorging. Addition of NaCl to low ATP solutions that alone elicited <50\% engorgement significantly enhanced feeding responses of bed bugs.
