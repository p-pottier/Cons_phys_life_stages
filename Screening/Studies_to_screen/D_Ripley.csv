article,Quantifying body surface temperature differences in canine coat types using infrared thermography,"Kwon, Claire J. and Brundage, Cord M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Infrared thermography (IRT) has been used to assess the health of canines by measuring surface temperatures. However, little is known about the effect hair coat differences has on expected surface temperature in healthy canines under the influence of hair coat differences. The aim of this study was to identify the influence of coat characteristics in body surface temperature (BST) in canines (Canis lupus familiaris). To determine the changes in BST, an infrared thermal imaging camera (i.e. FUR B400) was used. Thermal images of the left and right sides of privately-owned dogs (n = 50) were acquired. Each animal acclimated in an indoor environment away from direct sunlight (23 +/- 2.0 degrees C) for 15 min, and images were taken at a distance 0.67 +/- 0.24 m. Regions of interest (ROIs) of mean surface temperatures were examined across the lateral surface of each animal. No statistical differences were detected based on laterality (P = 0.08). Mean BSTs were categorized by each dog's hair coat type: short coat (SC), curly coat (CC), long coat (LC), and double coat (DC). These BSTs were then analyzed using two-way analysis of variance, or ANOVA, (Shapiro-Wilk) and pairwise comparison. SC animals had the highest BST (31.77 +/- 0.19 degrees C; P < 0.001) whereas LC (28.14 +/- 0.31 degrees C; P < 0.001) and DC animals (28.25 +/- 0.23 degrees C; P < 0.001) were lower in BST. CC animals portrayed intermediate BST (29.85 +/- 0.33 degrees C; P < 0.001). The Pearson correlation and one-way ANOVA between rectal temperature and BST and coat type were not statistically significant (r = -0.24 and P = 0.07, respectively). Results indicate that short-haired dogs exhibit a more drastic increase in BST (approximately 2 degrees C) in comparison to other dogs and this should be considered in future clinical applications.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.03.004,82,NA,18-22,NA,Dog; Hair cat; Infrared thermography; Body surface temperature
article,Would personal cooling vest be effective for use during exercise by people with thoracic spinal cord injury?,"Mneimneh, Farah and Ghaddar, Nesreen and Ghali, Kamel and Moussalem, Charbel and Omeis, Ibrahim",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"People with thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI), named people with paraplegia (PA), are vulnerable to thermal heat stress during exercise due to disruption in their thermal physiology. Using personal cooling vests with phase change material (PCM) or ice presents a possible solution for PA to suppress the increase in core temperature and body heat storage. With the limited published experimental studies about effective cooling vest for PA, this work aims to develop an altered PA bioheat model combined with cooling vest model to study cooling vest performance during exercise. The integrated PA bioheat and vest models predict core and skin temperatures, latent and sensible heat losses and change in body heat storage for PA with and without a cooling vest. The models were validated with published experimental data on PA without the cooling vest and on PA with two cooling vests; one using PCM at melting temperature of 15 degrees C and the other using ice packets during exercise. It was observed that sensible heat losses at the four torso segments (abdomen, lower back, chest and upper back) increased with the vest case compared to the no-vest case; while, latent heat losses decreased compared to the no-vest case. However, insignificant change was seen in core temperatures and body heat storage as was also reported experimentally. The performance of each of the cooling vest during exercise on PA was dependent on skin coverage area and melting temperatures.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.04.004,82,NA,123-141,NA,Thoracic spinal cord injury; Paraplegia; Thermal response; Cooling vest; Bioheat model
article,Corticosterone tissue-specific response in Sprague Dawley rats under acute heat stress,"Dou, Jinhuan and Montanholi, Yuri R. and Wang, Zezhao and Li, Zhongshu and Yu, Ying and Martell, Janel E. and Wang, Ya Jing and Wang, Yachun",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Our study evaluated the physiological responses to acute heat stress in rats via body temperature and tissue corticosterone levels, and investigated the relative tissue response to heat stress based on corticosterone. Body temperature of rats under 22 degrees C (control) and 42 degrees C for 30 (H30), 60 (H60) and 120 min (H120) was measured. Correspondingly, corticosterone was analyzed in 11 tissues (adrenal, brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, leg muscle, blood, stomach, spleen and small intestine). Analysis of variance and correlations were conducted on body temperature and corticosterone levels. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyzed the thereto-sensitivity via corticosterone. Body temperature of rats in H30, H60 and H120 groups were higher (P < 0.05) than the control. Compared to the control, corticosterone levels of heart, stomach and small intestine at H30, corticosterone levels in adrenal, leg muscle and stomach at H60, and corticosterone levels in adrenal, heart, lung, stomach and small intestine at H120 differed (P < 0.05). The corticosterone in lung tissue was an excellent indicator of acute heat stress, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 1.00 at H60 and H120. In order to improve the prediction of acute heat stress, models combining corticosterone levels of multiple tissues reached an AUC of 1.00 for H30, and the sensitivity increased to 100\% for H60 and H120. In conclusion, changes in the patterns and thermosensitivity of corticosterone levels associated with the duration of heat stress across body tissues were evidenced. The single and multi-organizational corticosterone models serve as indicators for evaluating heat stress across different time periods.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.02.004,81,NA,12-19,NA,Adrenal; Biochemical indicators; Body temperature; Heat sensitivity analysis; Lung; Stomach
article,Thermal refuge affects space use and movement of a large-bodied galliform,"Rakowski, Allison E. and Elmore, R. Dwayne and Davis, Craig A. and Fuhlendorf, Samuel D. and Carroll, J. Matthew",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature affects every organism on Earth and has been argued to be one of the most critical factors influencing organisms' ecology and evolution. Most organisms are susceptible to landscape temperature ranges that exceed their thermal tolerance. As a result, the distribution of landscape features that mitigate thermal extremes can affect movement and space use of organisms. Using Rio Grande wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo intermedia) as a model species, we measured black bulb temperature throughout the diurnal period and identified vegetation characteristics at wild turkey locations and random landscape locations. We observed that the thermal landscape was highly heterogeneous with temperature varying up to 52 degrees C at a given ambient temperature. Vegetation type strongly influenced temperature across space during daily peak heating, with taller vegetation types (woody vegetation > 2 m) having mean temperatures up to 8.95 degrees C cooler than the remainder of the landscape. However, these cooler vegetation types were uncommon, only accounting for 8.2\% of the landscape. Despite the rarity of tall woody cover, wild turkey showed strong selection for this vegetation type particularly during peak daily heating with 74.9\% of locations within 18 m of tree cover. Not only did wild turkey alter space use across time relative to temperature variation, but they also altered movement. We found that on the hottest days ( >= 35 degrees C), wild turkeys decreased movement by three fold during peak heating, while movement on cooler days ( < 30 degrees C) was uniform. Collectively, our data provide evidence that space use and movement for large avian species can be influenced by the thermal environment, and that the thermal environment is an important component of habitat for a species.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.12.024,80,NA,37-44,NA,Black bulb temperature; Heterogeneity; Landscape; Meleagris gallopavo; Microclimate; Operative temperature; Rio Grande wild turkey; Thermal ecology
article,Susceptibility to entomopathogens and modulation of basal immunity in two insect models at different temperatures,"Mastore, Maristella and Quadroni, Silvia and Toscano, Andrea and Mottadelli, Nicole and Brivio, Maurizio F.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In this work, we analysed the efficacy of different commercial bio-insecticides (Steinernema feltiae, Steinernema carpocapsae, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and Bacillus thuringiensis) by valuating the mortality induced on two insect models, Galleries mellonella (Lepidoptera) and Sarcophaga africa (Diptera) after exposure to different temperatures (10, 20 and 30 degrees C). Moreover, we investigated the effects of temperature on the basal humoral immunity of the two target insects; particularly, phenoloxidase (PO) and lysozyme activity. Our results show that G. mellonella is susceptible to all bio-insecticides at all the examined temperatures, except when infected at 10 degrees C with S. carpocapsae and at 30 degrees C with S. feltiae and B. thuringiensis. S. africa is more susceptible at 30 degrees C to all bioinsecticides; whereas, when infected at 10 and 20 degrees C, H. bacteriophora is the most efficient. Temperature modulates PO activity of both G. mellonella and S. africa, otherwise variations in lysozyme activity is observed only in G. mellonella. Except for a possible correlation between the increased lysozyme activity and the delayed Bt efficacy recorded on G. mellonella at 30 degrees C, a different resistance to bio-insecticides at different temperatures does not seem to be associated to variations of the host basal immunity, probably due to immunoevasive and immunodepressive strategies of these entomopathogens.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.11.006,79,NA,15-23,NA,Insect immunity; Entomopathogen nematodes; Bacillus thuringiensis; Temperature
article,Gastrointestinal thermal homogeneity and effect of cold water ingestion,"Roxane, Beaufils and Chandrou, Koumar Ouma and Alexandre, Chapon Pierre and Christophe, Chesneau and Bruno, Sesboue and Stephane, Besnard and Herve, Normand and Sebastien, Moussay and Nicolas, Bessot",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Purpose: Gastrointestinal temperature (GIT) is a common alternative for body core temperature (CT) monitoring via an ingestible pill connected to an external monitor. However, its reliability could depend on thermal homogeneity, regardless of the gastrointestinal tract location. The purpose of this study was to evaluate GIT variation during the transit of telemetric pills and the impact of cold drink ingestion compared to the time point of pill intake. Methods: Twenty-three healthy participants ingested six e-Celsius electronic pills, one every five hours, and they ingested 150 milliliters of cold water (5 +/- 1 degrees C) 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 12 h following the first pill ingestion. Results: The recorded temperature remained similar between pills consecutively ingested by each subject, regardless of the internal location within the gastrointestinal tract, supporting the homogeneity of GIT. GIT monitoring was significantly affected by ingestion of a cold drink two hours (-0.8 +/- 0.2 degrees C; p = 0.001) and three hours following pill ingestion (-0.9 +/- 0.2 degrees C; p < 0.001) in all subjects, and abnormal drops in GIT were observed in 22\% of subjects up to twelve hours following pill ingestion. Conclusion: Temperature may be considered homogenous all along the internal intestinal tract and correlates with CT, supporting telemetric monitoring as an efficient method for monitoring temperature. The interaction between GIT measurements and substance intake has to be taken into account. To avoid the effect of substance ingestion on CT data, we recommend users to employ the pill as a rectal suppository or to mark every substance ingestion time and/or allow only tepid water and food intake.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.10.002,78,NA,204-208,NA,Core temperature; Ingestible sensors; Fluid ingestion; Gastrointestinal tract; Telemetric pill
article,"Circadian rhythms of body temperature and locomotor activity in the antelope ground squirrel, <i>Ammospermophilus leucurus</i>","Refinetti, Roberto and Kenagy, G. J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"We studied circadian rhythms of body temperature and locomotor activity in antelope ground squirrels (Ammospermophilus leucurus) under laboratory conditions of a 12L:12D light-dark cycle and in constant darkness. Antelope ground squirrels are diurnally active and, exceptionally among ground squirrels and other closely related members of the squirrel family in general, they do not hibernate. Daily oscillations in body temperature consisted of a rise in temperature during the daytime activity phase of the circadian cycle and a decrease in temperature during the nighttime rest phase. The body temperature rhythms were robust (71\% of maximal strength) with a daily range of oscillation of 4.6 degrees C, a daytime mean of 38.7 degrees C, and a nighttime mean of 34.1 degrees C (24-h overall mean 36.4 degrees C). The body temperature rhythm persisted in continuous darkness with a free-running period of 24.2 h. This pattern is similar to that of hibernating species of ground squirrels but with a wave form more similar to that of non-hibernating rodents. Daily oscillations in body temperature were correlated with individual bouts of activity, but daytime temperatures were higher than nighttime temperatures even when comparing short episodes of nocturnal activity that were as intense as diurnal activity. This suggests that although muscular thermogenesis associated with locomotor activity can modify the level of body temperature, the circadian rhythm of body temperature is not simply a consequence of the circadian rhythm of activity.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.01.001,72,NA,67-72,NA,Ammospermophilus; Body core temperature; Circadian rhythm; Locomotor activity; PIT tag thermometry
article,Do ring-necked snakes choose retreat sites based upon thermal preferences?,"Cox, Christian L. and Logan, Michael L. and Bryan, Olivia and Kaur, Darshdeep and Leung, Evan and McCormack, John and McGinn, John and Miller, Lauren and Robinson, Caroline and Salem, Jena and Scheid, Jessica and Warzinski, Tatiana and Chung, Albert K.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Biochemical reaction rates are highly sensitive to temperature, and the body temperatures of ectotherms covary with their immediate environment. Therefore, ectotherms should choose microhabitats that permit the maintenance of physiological function. While some previous studies have found that squamate reptiles choose retreat sites that allow them to maintain physiologically optimal body temperatures, this research has been limited in context and taxonomic scope. We sought to test these empirical patterns by studying the properties of retreat sites in the context of physiological preferences and tolerances in a population of semifossorial ring-necked snakes (Diadophis punctatus). We measured environmental temperature distributions of retreat sites, field body temperatures, thermal preferences, and both upper voluntary temperature and critical thermal minima of snakes. We found that ring-necked snakes are under larger and warmer rocks, but that body temperatures in the field do not match thermal preferences measured in the laboratory. Specifically, we found aggregated ringnecked snakes (those occurring with multiple conspecifics) select rocks providing environmental temperatures averaging 3 degrees C higher than their preferred temperature. By contrast, solitary snakes select rocks that allowed them to maintain their body temperatures very close to their preferred temperatures. These results imply that there is substantial within and among-species variation in the role of thermal considerations in retreat-site selection. Our work also highlights the complex tradeoffs between physiological and ecological requirements that organisms must navigate in heterogeneous habitats.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.11.020,71,NA,232-236,NA,Aggregation; Critical thermal minimum; Diadophis punctatus; Ring-necked snake; Thermal preference; Thermoregulation; Upper voluntary temperature
article,Ambient temperature and humidity modulate the behavioural thermoregulation of a small arboreal mammal (<i>Callicebus bernhardi</i>),"Lopes, Karine G. D. and Bicca-Marques, Julio Cesar",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Maintaining a constant body temperature is critical to the proper functioning of metabolic reactions. Behavioural thermoregulation strategies may minimize the cost of energetic balance when an animal is outside its thermoneutral zone. We investigated whether ambient temperature and relative air humidity influence the use of behavioural strategies by a group of Prince Bernhard's titi monkeys (Callicebus bernhardi) living in a forest fragment. We monitored a social group composed of four individuals (an adult couple and two juveniles) for 1010 h from March to September 2015. We used the instantaneous scan sampling method to record the body posture, the microhabitat, and the occurrence of huddling with group mate(s) when animals were resting. We recorded ambient temperature and relative humidity in the shade every 10 min with a data logger hanging at a height of approximately 5 m. Daytime temperature ranged from 18.5 degrees C to 38.5 degrees C and relative humidity ranged from 21\% to 97\%. Titi monkeys avoided sunny places at higher temperatures, especially above 31 degrees C. Minimum night temperature did not influence the choice of resting microhabitats during the first hour after sunrise. Sitting was the major resting posture during the day (62\%). Titi monkeys increased the use of heat -dissipating postures at ambient temperatures > 27 degrees C. In addition, an increase in relative humidity increased the use of these postures at 26 degrees C, 27 degrees C, 29 degrees C and 33 degrees C, but caused a decrease at 24 degrees C. On the other hand, the ambient temperature did not influence the occurrence of huddling. We conclude that microhabitat choice and postural behaviour are important for titi monkeys to prevent overheating and suggest that these behavioural adjustments might also be critical for other tropical arboreal mammals.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.06.010,69,NA,104-109,NA,Plecturocebus bernhardi; Postural behaviour; Microhabitat selection; Resting; Huddling; Thermoneutral zone
article,"Exploration of low temperature microRNA function in an anoxia tolerant vertebrate ectotherm, the red eared slider turtle (<i>Trachemys scripta elegans</i>)","Biggar, Kyle K. and Storey, Kenneth B.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"As a model for vertebrate long-term survival in oxygen-restricted environments, the red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans) can adapt at the biochemical level to survive in oxygen-free (anoxic) cold water ( < 10 degrees C). This impressive ability is enabled through a coordinated suppression of energy-expensive, nonessential, cell processes. This study explored the anoxia-responsive expression of several microRNA species (miR-1a, -133, -17, -107, -148a, -21, -103, -210, -20a, -365 and -29b) in adult turtles exposed to 5 h and 20 h anoxia (at 5 +/- 1 degrees C). Furthermore, since microRNA target binding is regularly defined only by microRNA-mRNA interactions at 37 degrees C, the possibility of unique low temperature-selective microRNA targeting interactions with mRNA was explored in this ectotherm. Approximately twice as many microRNA-mRNA interactions were predicted at 5 degrees C versus 37 degrees C with particular enrichment of mRNA targets involved in biological processes known to be part of the stress response. Hence, the results suggest that the influence of temperature should be considered for the prediction of microRNA targets (and their follow-up) in poikilothermic animals and that interacting effects of low body temperature and anoxia on microRNA expression could potentially be important to achieve the profound metabolic rate depression that characterizes turtle hibernation underwater during the winter.

article,A revised approach for an exact analytical solution for thermal response in biological tissues significant in therapeutic treatments,"Dutta, Jaideep and Kundu, Balaram",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The genesis of the present research paper is to develop a revised exact analytical solution of thermal profile of 1-D Pennes bioheat equation (PBHE) for living tissues influenced in thermal therapeutic treatments. In order to illustrate the temperature distribution in living tissue both Fourier and non-Fourier model of 1-D PBHE has been solved by Separation of variables technique. Till date most of the research works have been carried out with the constant initial steady temperature of tissue which is not at all relevant for the biological body due to its nonhomogeneous living cells. There should be a temperature variation in the body before the therapeutic treatment. Therefore, a coupled heat transfer in skin surface before therapeutic heating must be taken account for establishment of exact temperature propagation. This approach has not yet been considered in any research work. In this work, an initial condition for solving governing differential equation of heat conduction in biological tissues has been represented as a function of spatial coordinate. In a few research work, initial temperature distribution with PBHE has been coupled in such a way that it eliminates metabolic heat generation. The study has been devoted to establish the comparison of thermal profile between present approach and published theoretical approach for particular initial and boundary conditions inflicted in this investigation. It has been studied that maximum temperature difference of existing approach for Fourier temperature distribution is 19.6\% while in case of non-Fourier, it is 52.8\%. We have validated our present analysis with experimental results and it has been observed that the temperature response based on the spatial dependent variable initial condition matches more accurately than other approaches.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.03.015,66,NA,33-48,NA,Analytical; Biological heat transfer; Living tissue; Temperature response; Therapeutic treatment
article,Triangular node for Transmission-Line Modeling (TLM) applied to bio-heat transfer,"Milan, Hugo F. M. and Gebremedhin, Kifle G.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Transmission-Line Modeling (TLM) is a numerical method used to solve complex and time-domain bioheat transfer problems. In TLM, rectangles are used to discretize two-dimensional problems. The drawback in using rectangular shapes is that instead of refining only the domain of interest, a large additional domain will also be refined in the x and y axes, which results in increased computational time and memory space. In this paper, we developed a triangular node for TLM applied to bio-heat transfer that does not have the drawback associated with the rectangular nodes. The model includes heat source, blood perfusion (advection), boundary conditions and initial conditions. The boundary conditions could be adiabatic, temperature, heat flux, or convection. A matrix equation for TLM, which simplifies the solution of time-domain problems or solves steady-state problems, was also developed. The predicted results were compared against results obtained from the solution of a simplified two-dimensional problem, and they agreed within 1\% for a mesh length of triangular faces of 59 gm 9 gm (mean standard deviation) and a time step of 1 ms.

article,Chronic oral administration of pine bark extract (flavangenol) attenuates brain and liver mRNA expressions of HSPs in heat-exposed chicks,"Yang, Hui and Chowdhury, Vishwajit S. and Bahry, Mohammad A. and Tran, Phuong V. and Do, Phong H. and Han, Guofeng and Zhang, Rong and Tagashira, Hideki and Tsubata, Masahito and Furuse, Mitsuhiro",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Exposure to a high ambient temperature (HT) can cause heat stress, which has a huge negative impact on physiological functions. Cellular heat-shock response is activated upon exposure to HT for cellular maintenance and adaptation. In addition, antioxidants are used to support physiological functions under HT in a variety of organisms. Flavangenol, an extract of pine bark, is one of the most potent antioxidants with its complex mixture of polyphenols. In the current study, chronic (a single daily oral administration for 14 days) or acute (a single oral administration) oral administration of flavangenol was performed on chicks. Then the chicks were exposed to an acute HT (40 +/- 1 degrees C for 3 h) to examine the effect of flavangenol on the mRNA expression of heat-shock protein (HSP) in the brain and liver. Rectal temperature, plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AAT), a marker of liver damage, and plasma corticosterone as well as metabolites were also determined. HSP-70 and -90 mRNA expression, rectal temperature, plasma AAT and corticosterone were increased by HT. Interestingly, the chronic, but not the acute, administration of flavangenol caused a declining in the diencephalic mRNA expression of HSP-70 and -90 and plasma AAT in HT-exposed chicks. Moreover, the hepatic mRNA expression of HSP-90 was also significantly decreased by chronic oral administration of flavangenol in HT chicks. These results indicate that chronic, but not acute, oral administration of flavangenol attenuates HSP mRNA expression in the central and peripheral tissues due to its possible role in improving cellular protective functions during heat stress. The flavangenol-dependent decline in plasma MT further suggests that liver damage induced by heat stress was minimized by flavangenol. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

article,The effect of high versus low intensity heat acclimation on performance and neuromuscular responses,"Wingfield, Georgia L. and Gale, Rachel and Minett, Geoffrey M. and Marino, Frank E. and Skein, Melissa",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"This study examined the effect of exercise intensity and duration during 5-day heat acclimation (HA) on cycling performance and neuromuscular responses. 20 recreationally trained males completed a `baseline' trial followed by 5 consecutive days HA, and a `post-acclimation' trial. Baseline and post-acclimation trials consisted of maximal voluntary contractions (MVC), a single and repeated countermovement jump protocol, 20 km cycling time trial (IT) and 5 x 6 s maximal sprints (SPR). Cycling trials were undertaken in 33.0 +/- 0.8 degrees C and 60 3\% relative humidity. Core (T-core), and skin temperatures (T-skin), heart rate (HR), rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and thermal sensation were recorded throughout cycling trials. Participants were assigned to either 30 min high-intensity (30HI) or 90 min low-intensity (90LI) cohorts for HA, conducted in environmental conditions of 32.0 +/- 1.6 degrees C. Percentage change time to complete the 20 km TT for the 90LI cohort was significantly improved post-acclimation (-5.9 +/- 7.0\%; P=0.04) compared to the 30HI cohort (-0.18 +/- 3.9\%; P < 0.05). The 30HI cohort showed greatest improvements in power output (PO) during post acclimation SPR 1 and 2 compared to 90LI (546 +/- 128 W and 517 +/- 87 W, respectively; P < 0.02). No differences were evident for MVC within 30HI cohort, however, a reduced performance indicated by \% change within the 90LI (P=0.04). Compared to baseline, mean T-core was reduced post-acclimation within the 30HI cohort (P=0.05) while mean T-core and HR were significantly reduced within the 90LI cohort (P=0.01 and 0.04, respectively). Greater physiological adaptations and performance improvements were noted within the 90LI cohort compared to the 30HI. However, 30HI did provide some benefit to anaerobic performance including sprint PO and MVC These findings suggest specifying training duration and intensity during heat acclimation may be useful for specific post-acclimation performance.

article,Body temperature regulation during acclimation to cold and hypoxia in rats,"Cadena, V. and Tattersall, G. J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Extreme environmental conditions present challenges for thermoregulation in homoeothermic organisms such as mammals. Such challenges are exacerbated when two stressors are experienced simultaneously and each stimulus evokes opposing physiological responses. This is the case of cold, which induces an increase in thermogenesis, and hypoxia, which suppresses metabolism conserving oxygen and preventing hypoxaemia. As an initial approach to understanding the thermoregulatory responses to cold and hypoxia in a small mammal, we explored the effects of acclimation to these two stressors on the body temperature (T-b) and the daily and ultradian T-b variations of Sprague-Dawley rats. As T-b is influenced by sleep-wake cycles, these T-b variations reflect underlying adjustments in set-point and thermosensitivity. The T-b of rats decreased precipitously during initial hypoxic exposure which was more pronounced in cold (T-b=33.4 +/- 0.13) than in room temperature (T-b=35.74 +/- 0.17) conditions. This decline was followed by an increase in T-b stabilising at a new level similar to 0.5 degrees C and similar to 1.4 degrees C below normoxic values at room and cold temperatures, respectively. Daily T-b variations were blunted during hypoxia with a greater effect in the cold. Ultradian T-b variations exhibited daily rhythmicity that disappeared under hypoxia, independent of ambient temperature. The adjustments in T-b during hypoxia and/or cold are in agreement with the hypothesis that an initial decrease in the T-b set-point is followed by its partial re-establishment with chronic hypoxia. This rebound of the T-b set-point might reflect cellular adjustments that would allow animals to better deal with low oxygen conditions, diminishing the drive for a lower T-b set-point. Cold and hypoxia are characteristic of high altitude environments. Understanding how mammals cope with changes in oxygen and temperature will shed light into their ability to colonize new environments along altitudinal dines and increase our understanding of how T-b is regulated under stimuli that impose contrasting physiological constraints.

article,Passive heat loading links lipolysis and regulation of fibroblast growth factor-21 in humans,"Lee, Jeong-Beom and Kim, Tae-Wook",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"There is relativley little information on the serum biomarkers of heat stress. Therefore, the goal of this study was to verify the effect of passive heat loading (PHL) on the expression of fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) and free fatty acids (FFAs). Four PHL protocols based on intensity (39 degrees C vs. 43 degrees C, leg immersion, 30 min) and type (leg vs. half immersion, 42 degrees C, 30 min) were used. Each protocol was applied on a 2 day cycle to 12 healthy adult males (age, 22.4 +/- 2.9 years: height, 174.1 +/- 4.6 cm; weight, 71.3 +/- 5.6 kg: body mass index, 23.1 +/- 3.0). The subjects were categorized into two groups according to the study design (randomized, with a parallel trial). Body temperature, FGF21 and FFAs were determined prior to PHL, immediately and 60 min after PHI., Body temperature was significant higher (43 degrees C) than the 39 degrees C measured under identical PHL type (leg immersion). PHL was effective for the expression of FGF21 and for lipolysis. The quantitative levels of FGF21 and FFA increased with increasing temperature (39 degrees C < 42 degrees C < 43 degrees C). A significant difference in the quantitative levels of FGF21 and FFAs was also evident based on the type of PHL (leg < half immersion) even when PHL was applied at the same temperature (42 degrees C). In conclusion, PHL was effective for expressing FGF21 and for lipolysis. Therefore.

article,The effects of season and sex upon the morphology and material properties of keratin in the Svalbard rock ptarmigan (<i>Lagopus muta hyperborea</i>),"Lees, John J. and Folkow, Lars P. and Nudds, Robert L. and Codd, Jonathan R.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The material properties and morphologies of the modified integumentary organs of birds (the keratinous bills, claws and feathers) have evolved to withstand the variety of mechanical stresses imposed by their interaction with the environment. These stresses are likely to vary temporally in seasonal environments and may also differ between the sexes as a result of behavioural dimorphism. Here we investigate the morphology and material properties of the claws of male and female Svalbard ptarmigan (Lagopus muta hyperborea) during the summer and winter using nanoindentation. Despite differences in locomotor demands between the sexes and pronounced seasonal differences in environmental conditions, like ground substrate, ambient temperature and day length, there was no significant difference in Young's modulus or hardness between the seasons for each sex. However, when comparing males and females, female claws were significantly harder than those of males and both sexes had significantly wider claws during winter. We propose that wider claws may follow winter claw moulting as the claws are regrown and form an important part of the ptarmigan's snowshoe-like foot that is an adaptation to locomotion on snow. Future work focusing on growth rates and more broad measures of material properties in both captive and wild birds is required to determine the extent of seasonal and sex differences in the material properties of their keratinous structures.

By experimental manipulations of temperatures under constant photoperiod, we aimed to determine if emergence, activity and thermoregulatory behaviour of juvenile tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus) varied at different temperatures (20 degrees C, 12 degrees C and 5 degrees C). To help clarify its activity pattern, we compared tuatara with two lizard species endemic of the South Island of New Zealand for which activity pattern is known and clearly defined: the nocturnal common gecko Woodworthia `' Otago/ Southland `' and the diurnal McCann's skink Oligosoma maccanni. Tuatara showed similar responses to both species of lizards. Similar to the diurnal skinks, tuatara emerged quickly at 20 degrees C and 12 degrees C while nocturnal geckos took more time to emerge. Like nocturnal geckos, tuatara continued to be active at 5 degrees C, but only during the day. Interestingly, tuatara shifted from diurno-nocturnal activity at 20 degrees C and 12 degrees C to being strictly diurnal at 5 degrees C. We suggest that this temperature-dependent strategy maximises their survival during cold periods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Effect of simultaneous variation in temperature and ammonia concentration on percent fertilization and hatching in <i>Crassostrea ariakensis</i>,Wang Hui and Liu Jiahui and Yang Hongshuai and Liu Jin and Liu Zhigang,JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The combined effects of temperature and ammonia concentration on the percent fertilization and percent hatching in Crassostrea ariakensis were examined under laboratory conditions using the central composite design and response surface methodology. The results indicated: (1) The linear effects of temperature and ammonia concentration on the percent fertilization were significant (P < 0.05), and the quadratic effects were highly significant (P < 0.01). The interactive effect between temperature and ammonia concentration on the percent fertilization was not significant (P > 0.05). (2) The linear effect of temperature on the percent hatching was highly significant (P < 0.01), and that of ammonia concentration was nonsignificant (P > 0.05). The quadratic effects of temperature and ammonia concentration on the percent hatching were highly significant (P < 0.01). The interaction on the percent hatching was not significant (P > 0.05). Temperature was more important than ammonia in influencing the fertilization and hatching in C. ariakensis. (3) The model equations of the percent fertilization and hatching towards temperature and ammonia concentration were established, with the coefficients of determination R-2=99.4\% and 99.76\%, respectively. Through the lack-of-fit test, these models were of great adequacy. The predictive coefficients of determination for the two model equations were as high as 94.6\% and 98.03\%, respectively, showing that they could be used for practical projection. (4) Via the statistical simultaneous optimization technique, the optimal factor level combination, i.e., 25 C-circle/0.038 mg mL(-1),was derived, at which the greatest percent fertilization 95.25\% and hatching 83.26\% was achieved, with the desirability being 97.81\%.

article,"Thermoregulation of spotted turtles (<i>Clemmys guttata</i>) in a beaver-flooded bog in southern Ontario, Canada","Yagi, Katharine T. and Litzgus, Jacqueline D.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Body temperature has a major influence on the physiological processes, growth, reproductive output, and overall survival of ectotherms. When a habitat is altered as a result of natural or anthropogenic influences, the available temperatures in the habitat can change, thus affecting an animal's ability to thermoregulate. We studied thermoregulation in response to habitat change in a population of spotted turtles (Clemmys guttata) in Southern Ontario, Canada. Historically, the study site was ditched to draw down water levels to facilitate peat mining, and the resulting drainage ditches were the only habitat containing surface water and turtles were restricted to these drains. Recent colonization of the site by beaver (Castor canadensis) caused increases in water level and water surface area. We followed spotted turtles (N=16) outfitted with radio transmitters and iButtons to estimate body temperatures (T-b) continuously throughout the active season post-flooding. Turtle models outfitted with iButtons (N=50) were deployed in the nine available habitat types to record environmental temperatures (T-e). Turtles (N=13) were tested in a thermal gradient under laboratory conditions to determine preferred body temperature range (T-set). The T-set for the population ranged from 20 degrees C to 26 degrees C. In the field, T-b was within the T-set range 28\% of the time from March to October, and 67\% of the time from July to August. Efficiency of thermoregulation was calculated to be highest in July and August. The habitat type with the highest thermal quality was the shallow flooded zone created by beaver damming, and the habitat with the lowest thermal quality was the drain bottom, the drains being the only aquatic habitat available prior to flooding. This study confirms that beaver flooding provided a wide variety of preferable thermal opportunities for spotted turtles. Further investigation is needed to determine the effects of flooding on spotted turtle thermoregulation during nesting and hibernation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Effectiveness of skin-heating using a water-perfused suit as passive and post-exercise heat acclimation strategies,"Ko, Yelin and Kang, Juho and Seol, Seon-Hong and Lee, Joo-Young",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of passive and post-exercise heat acclimation strategies through directly heating the skin with a water-perfused suit. Nineteen young males participated in the heat acclimation (HA) protocols for 10 days, which were conducted at an air temperature of 33 degrees C with 60\%RH. The exercise-only condition (N = 6) conducted 1-h treadmill walking (6 km.h(-1)) followed by 1-h rest. The post-exercise passive-heating condition (N = 6) wore the suit (inflow water temperature 44.2 degrees C) for 1-h after 1-h walking. The passive-heating condition (N = 7) donned the suit for 2 h. Heat tolerance tests (leg immersion in 42 degrees C water for 60 min) were conducted before and after the training to evaluate changes due to the 10-day intervention. Reflecting that suit-wearing for 10 days as both passive and post-exercise HA strategies can effectively induce adaptive changes, significant interaction effects appeared in: increase or decrease in mean skin temperature (P < 0.05) and elevation in whole-body sweat rate (P < 0.05). Reduction in rectal temperature (P < 0.05) and blood pressure (P < 0.05) were found most prominently in the passive-heating condition. These results indicate that this new method of heat acclimation training, donning a skin-heating water-perfused suit, can generate thermoregulatory benefits.

Abd and Khafaga, Asmaa F. and Taha, Ayman E. and Abdo, Mohamed",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Climate change represents a significant environmental challenge to human welfare. One of many negative impacts may be on animal reproduction. Elevated ambient temperature unfavourably influences reproductive processes in mammals. High temperature can affect reproductive processes such as follicle development and may alter follicular fluid concentrations of amino acids, fatty acids, minerals, enzymes, antioxidants defence and growth factors. These impacts may lead to inferior oocyte competence and abnormal granulosa cell (GCs) function. Mammalian oocytes are enclosed by GCs that secret hormones and signalling molecules to promote oocyte competence. GCs are essential for proper follicular development, oocyte maturation, ovulation, and luteinization. Many environmental stressors, including thermal stress, affect GC function and alter oocyte development and growth. Several studies documented a link between elevated ambient temperature and increased generation of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS can damage DNA, reduce cell proliferation, and induce apoptosis in GCs, thus altering oocyte development. Additionally, thermal stress induces upregulation of thermal shock proteins, such as HSP70 and HSP90. This review provides an update on the influence of thermal stress on GCs of mammals.

article,"Effects of core temperature, skin temperature, and inter-beat interval on resting metabolic rate measurements in thermoneutral conditions","Davis, Greggory R. and Bellar, David and Scott, Derek and Lavergne, Mary",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"It is important to identify potential underlying factors that can affect the variability of resting metabolic rate (RMR) measurements. The RMRs of 20 college-aged men were tested twice in stable environmental conditions, with each measurement separated by 40 min. Skin temperature, core temperature, and inter-beat interval were monitored throughout the study as identified factors that could affect RMR measurements. Since environmental conditions in a clinic or laboratory can vary, skin temperature and core temperature can be affected which may affect RMR. Similarly, prior physical activity, stress, sleep, and caffeine intake can affect inter-beat interval and may be a co-variable affecting RMR. Higher RMR measurements were compared to lower RMR measurements. RMR for the higher trial was 2068 +/- 66 kcal/day, the lower trial was 1975 +/- 65 kcal/day (t = 4.23; p < 0.01). Core temperature for higher trial was 37.1 +/- 0.1 degrees C, the lower trial was 36.8 +/- 0.1 degrees C (s = 105.00; p < 0.01). Skin temperature measurements were significantly different for the anterior bicep site (t = -2.52; p = 0.02), but not for any other site. Inter-beat interval for the higher measurement was 1038 +/- 33 ms, the lower measurement was 998 +/- 32 ms (t = 3.82; p < 0.01). However, regression analysis found that none of the variables were significant predictors for the higher RMR, lower RMR, or change in RMR.

The impact site was on average 2 degrees C warmer than the control site. Our results demonstrate a significantly different structure and composition of biofouling communities between control and impact sites. Warming led to a 1.5-fold increase in the mean coverage of biofouling communities and slightly decreased functional and species richness.

The underlying mechanism of heat acclimation in insects is still unclear. Here, the heat selection and transcript level response in the larvae of the rice leaf folder Cnaphalocrocis medinalis Guenee, a serious pest of rice in summer, were studied. The survival and fecundity of larvae during multigenerational heat selection at 39 degrees C were examined, and heat tolerance and mRNA expression of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and 90 (Hsp90) were examined under heat stress. The results showed that survival and fecundity of larvae increased notably and then kept constant after two or three generations of heat selection. Heat selection improved thermal tolerance of larvae. The Hsp70 mRNA expression of the 3rd-instar larvae increased in all five generations of heat selection, but Hsp90 increased only in the first two generations. The response of Hsp70 to 39 degrees C heat treatment in the larvae kept at 27 degrees C was different from the larvae exposed to the conditioning heat treatments, but the response of Hsp 90 was similar. Moreover, the Hsp70 and Hsp90 mRNA expression levels were significantly higher in the heat-acclimated larvae than that in the unacclimated larvae at a comparable duration of exposure to 37 and 41 degrees C.

Beneficial effect results from transcription and translational cellular components' involvement that defends metabolism and thus induce ischemic protection of the tissue. Mitochondrial respiration is also involved in stress- induced conditions. It is not a uniform process. Cytochrome c Oxidase (CytOx) representing complex IV of the Electron Transfer Chain (ETC) has a regulatory role for mitochondrial respiratory activity, which is tested in our study after hsp induction. Moreover, protein translation for mitochondrial components was probed by the detection of MT-CO1 for Subunit 1 of CytOx neosynthesis. Wistar rats were subjected to whole-body hyperthermia at 42.0-42.5 degrees C for 15 min followed by a normothermic recovery period. Heat shock response was monitored time dependent from LV biopsies of all control and heat treated animals with PCR-analysis for hsp 32, 60, 70.1, 70.2, 90 and MT-CO1 expression at 15, 30, 45, 60, 120 and 360 min recovery (n = 5 in each group), respectively.

article,The heat is on: A device that reduces cold stress-induced tachycardia in laboratory mice,"Chan, Cordelia E. and Hare, Maia T. and Martin, Gabrielle W. and Gordon, Christopher J. and Swoap, Steven J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Mouse vivaria are typically maintained at an ambient temperature (Ta) of 2026 degrees C which is comfortable for human researchers. However, as this Ta is well below the mouse thermoneutral zone (TNZ) of 3032 degrees C, typical vivarium temperatures result in cold stress for mice. Recently, a cage has been developed that provides variable cage floor heating, allowing mice to behaviorally regulate body temperature through thermotaxis. A hand warmer provides supplemental heat, elevating cage floor surface temperature for 13 + hours up to 30 degrees C. This provides a heated surface for the entirety of the light phase. Here, we test the ability of these local heat sources to remove physiological signs of cold stress in mice housed at room temperature by analyzing heart rate (HR), activity, and body temperature in three experimental conditions: 23 degrees C, 23 degrees C + heated surface, or 30 degrees C. The location of C57Bl/6 J mice within the cage was recorded using an infrared camera. In the presence of supplemental heat at a Ta of 23 degrees C, mice resided atop of the area of the heated surface 85 +/- 3\% of the 12-h light phase, as compared to 7 +/- 2\% in the absence of supplemental heat. Further, addition of supplemental heat lowered light phase HR and activity to that seen at a Ta of 30 degrees C. These results indicate that provision of a local heat source is successful in reducing cold-induced tachycardia in mice housed at typical vivarium temperatures without increasing the ambient temperature of the entire laboratory and subjecting researchers to heat stress.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.12.006,79,NA,149-154,NA,NA

Upper thermal tolerance limits (CTmax) generally increase with body size among and within ant species, but size effects on lower thermal tolerances (CTmin) are poorly known. To test whether CTmin co-variation with body size matched patterns for CTmax, we measured CTmax and CTmin in workers of four size based worker subcastes in the army ant Eciton burchellii parvispinum. CTmax increased with worker body size as expected. CTmin showed a more complex relationship with size: the two intermediate-size subcastes (media and porters) tolerated lower temperatures than the smallest (minims) and the largest (soldiers) worker subcastes. Body-size effects on CTmax were not predictive of body-size effects on CTmin. These patterns held for colonies collected across elevations that spanned approximately 8 degrees C in mean annual temperature, even though high elevation colonies had significantly lower CTmin overall. We predict Eciton army ant subcastes will be differentially affected by directional changes in high and low temperature extremes.

article,Contribution of wetted clothing to body energy exchange and heat stress,"Elson, John and Eckels, Steve",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Quantifying the impact of clothing thermal and evaporation resistance is essential to providing representative boundary conditions for physiological modeling. In many models, sweat is assumed to drip off the skin surface to the environment and is not captured in clothing. In high metabolic rate and high temperature and humidity conditions the sweat produced by the body has the potential to saturate semipermeable clothing ensembles, changing the assumptions of the model. Workers, athletes and soldiers commonly wear encapsulating versions of such clothing to protect against environmental hazards. A saturated clothing model is proposed based on the ASHRAE two-node model using a saturated spot element in parallel with the existing method to account for sweat absorbed in the clothing. The work uses fundamental heat and mass transfer principles, modifying the existing formula using clothing measurements and basic assumptions. The effectiveness of the model is demonstrated by comparing the predictions of the original and proposed models, to the results of 21 soldiers exercising. The soldiers wore combat pants and shirt, helmet, gloves, shoes, socks, and underwear, and walked in a thermal chamber for 2 h at 42.2 degrees C dry bulb temperature, 54.4 degrees C wet bulb temperature, 20\% relative humidity, and airspeed of 2 m/s. Core temperature, seven skin temperatures, heart rate, and total sweat loss were measured. The original model provides an average core temperature difference compared with the human subject results of 1.31 degrees C (SD = 0.557 degrees C) while the modified model improves the final prediction of core temperature to within an average of 0.15 degrees C (SD = 0.383 degrees C). The new model shows an improvement in the prediction of human core temperature under the tested conditions where dripping sweat will saturate clothing. The format can be used in multi-segmented thermal models and can continue to be developed and improved as more information on wetted clothing properties become available.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.09.014,78,NA,343-351,NA,Wetted clothing; Sweat; Saturation; Model validation; Military ensemble; Desert environment; Core temperature; Skin temperature; Two-node model

Wing color impacts absorption of solar irradiation which may affect drag but there is little known in this area. To this end, the drag reduction induced by the thermal effect of the wing color of migrating birds with unpowered flight modes is presented in this study. Considering this natural phenomenon in the albatross as an example of migrating birds, and applying an energy balance for this biological system, a thermal analysis is performed on the wings during the summer and winter to obtain, different ranges of air density, viscosity, and wing surface temperature brought about from a range of ambient temperatures and climatic conditions seen in different seasons and to study their effects. The exact shape of the albatross wing is used and nine different wing colors are considered in order to gain a better understanding of the effect different colors' absorptivities make on the change in aerodynamic performances. The thermal effect is found to be more important during the summer than during the winter due to the higher values of solar irradiation and a maximum drag reduction of 7.8\% is found in summer changing the wing color from light white to dark black. The obtained results show that albatrosses with darker colored wings are more efficient (constant lift to drag ratio and drag reduction) and have better endurance due to this drag reduction.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.11.002,71,NA,112-122,NA,Drag reduction; Thermal effect; Wing color; Migrating birds; Albatross

Any change in temperature from the ambient condition can induce various metabolic and physiological changes in the body. The present study evaluates the effects of temperature induced stress on the antioxidant profile of Etroplus suratensis such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and lipid peroxidation. Fishes of same size were kept in a thermostatized bath at three different temperature regimes viz 16 degrees C, 27 degrees C (ambient temperature) and 38 degrees C for 72 h. These temperatures were selected based on the CT Max (Critical Thermal Maximum) and CT Min (Critical Thermal Minimum) exhibited by E. suratensis. Superoxide dismutase and catalase activity was found maximum in brain and muscle respectively during the 48th hour of exposure in fishes kept at 38 degrees C. At 16 degrees C the antioxidant response of glutathione peroxidase was maximum in muscles, whereas the lipid peroxidation rate was found to be high in gills compared to other tissues. The profound increase in the levels of oxidative stress related biomarkers indicate that the thermal stressors severely affected oxidative state of E. suratensis by the second day of experiment. Such down-regulation of redox state accompanied with the induction of oxidative stress cascade may lead to physiological damage in various tissues in fishes, in vivo.

However, the question of how L-Cit mediates hypothermia remained elusive. Thus, the objective of this study was to examine some possible factors in the process of L-Cit-mediated hypothermia and to confirm whether L-Cit can also afford thermotolerance in young chicks. Chicks were subjected to oral administration of L-Cit along with intraperitoneal injection of a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, N-G-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester HCl (L-NAME), to examine the involvement of NO in the process of hypothermia. Food intake and plasma metabolites were also analyzed after oral administration of L-Cit in chicks. To examine thermotolerance, chicks were orally administered with a single dose of L-Cit (15 mmol/10 ml/kg body weight) or the same dose twice within a short interval of 1 h (dual oral administration) before the exposure to high ambient temperature (35 +/- 1 degrees C) for 180 min. Although the rectal temperature was reduced following administration of L-Cit, L-NAME caused a greater reduction. L-NAME reduced total NO2 and NO3 (NOx) in plasma, which confirmed its inhibitory effect on NO. A single oral administration of L-Cit mediated a persistent state of hypothermia for the 300 min of the study without affecting food intake. It was further found that plasma glucose was significantly lower in L-Cit-treated chicks. Dual oral administration of L-Cit, but not a single oral administration, afforded thermotolerance without a significant change in plasma NOx in chicks. In conclusion, our results suggest that L-Cit-mediated hypothermia and thermotolerance may not be involved in NO production. L-Cit-mediated thermotolerance further suggests that L-Cit may serve as an important nutritional supplement that could help in coping with summer heat.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.07.007,69,NA,163-170,NA,L-Citrulline; Hypothermia; Thermotolerance; Nitric oxide; Plasma glucose; Chicks
article,Thermal biology of eastern box turtles in a longleaf pine system managed with prescribed fire,"Roe, John H. and Wild, Kristoffer H. and Hall, Carlisha A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Fire can influence the microclimate of forest habitats by removing understory vegetation and surface debris. Temperature is often higher in recently burned forests owing to increased light penetration through the open understory. Because physiological processes are sensitive to temperature in ectotherms, we expected fire maintained forests to improve the suitability of the thermal environment for turtles, and for turtles to seasonally associate with the most thermally-optimal habitats. Using a laboratory thermal gradient, we determined the thermal preference range (T-set) of eastern box turtles, Terrapene carolina, to be 27-31 degrees C. Physical models simulating the body temperatures experienced by turtles in the field revealed that surface environments in a fire maintained longleaf pine forest were 3 degrees C wanner than adjacent unburned mixed hardwood/pine forests, but the fire-maintained forest was never of superior thermal quality owing to wider T-e fluctuations above T-set, and exposure to extreme and potentially lethal temperatures. Radiotracked turtles using fire-managed longleaf pine forests maintained shell temperatures (T-s) approximately 2 degrees C above those at a nearby unburned forest, but we observed only moderate seasonal changes in habitat use which were inconsistent with thermoregulatory behavior. We conclude that turtles were not responding strongly to the thermal heterogeneity generated by fire in our system, and that other aspects of the environment are likely more important in shaping habitat associations.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.09.005,69,NA,325-333,NA,Habitat use; Terrapene carolina; Temperature; Thermal quality; Thermoregulation; Reptile

After 15 days acclimation at thermo neutral zone (TNZ) in psychrometric chamber, animals were exposed at 42 degrees C for 6 h up to 23 days followed by 12 days of recovery period. Blood samples were collected during control period at TNZ (day 1, 5 and 12), after heat stress exposure (day 1-10, Short Term Heat Stress Acclimation-STHSA; day 15-23, Long Term Heat Stress Acclimation-LTHSA) and recovery period (day 7 and 12) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated for RNA and protein extraction. Serum cortisol concentration was assessed by RIA. The mRNA and protein expression in PBMCs were determined by qPCR and western blot respectively. Samples at TNZ were taken as control. Serum cortisol concentration was increased (P < 0.05) during STHSA and gradually declined during LTHSA. Toll like receptor 2 (TLR 2) expression was up regulated (P < 0.05) during STHSA and declined to basal level during LTHSA and recovery phase. However, toll like receptor 4 (TLR 4) expression was up regulated (P < 0.05) during STHSA and LTHSA while declined in recovery phase. Interleukin 2 (IL2) and interleukin 6 (IL 6) were up regulated (P < 0.05) during STHSA and reduced to basal level during LTHSA. PBMCs culture study was conducted to study transcriptional abundance of TLR2/4 and IL2/6 at different temperature-time combinations.

article,A study on thermal damage during hyperthermia treatment based on DPL model for multilayer tissues using finite element Legendre wavelet Galerkin approach,"Kumar, Dinesh and Rai, K. N.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Hyperthermia is a process that uses heat from the spatial heat source to kill cancerous cells without damaging the surrounding healthy tissues. Efficacy of hyperthermia technique is related to achieve temperature at the infected cells during the treatment process. A mathematical model on heat transfer in multilayer tissues in finite domain is proposed to predict the control temperature profile at hyperthermia position. The treatment technique uses dual-phase-lag model of heat transfer in multilayer tissues with modified Gaussian distribution heat source subjected to the most generalized boundary condition and interface at the adjacent layers. The complete dual-phase-lag model of bioheat transfer is solved using finite element Legendre wavelet Galerkin approach. The present solution has been verified with exact solution in a specific case and provides a good accuracy. The effect of the variability of different parameters such as lagging times, external heat source, metabolic heat source and the most generalized boundary condition on temperature profile in multilayer tissues is analyzed and also discussed the effective approach of hyperthermia treatment. Furthermore, we studied the modified thermal damage model with regeneration of healthy tissues as well. For viewpoint of thermal damage, the least thermal damage has been observed in boundary condition of second kind. The article concludes with a discussion of better opportunities for future clinical application of hyperthermia treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Black or white? Physiological implications of roost colour and choice in a microbat,"Doty, Anna C. and Stawski, Clare and Currie, Shannon E. and Geiser, Fritz",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Although roost choice in bats has been studied previously, little is known about how opposing roost colours affect the expression of torpor quantitatively. We quantified roost selection and thermoregulation in a captive Australian insectivorous bat, Nyctophilus gouldi (n=12) in winter when roosting in black and white coloured boxes using temperature-telemetry. We quantified how roost choice influences torpor expression when food was provided ad libitum or restricted in bats housed together in an outdoor aviary exposed to natural fluctuations of ambient temperature. Black box temperatures averaged 5.1 degrees C (maximum 7.5 degrees C) warmer than white boxes at their maximum daytime temperature. Bats fed ad libitum chose black boxes on most nights (92.9\%) and on 100\% of nights when food-restricted. All bats used torpor on all study days. However, bats fed ad libitum and roosting in black boxes used shorter torpor and spent more time normothermic/active at night than food-restricted bats and bats roosting in white boxes. Bats roosting in black boxes also rewarmed passively more often and to a higher skin temperature than those in white boxes. Our study suggests that N. gouldi fed ad libitum select warmer roosts in order to passively rewarm to a higher skin temperature and thus save energy required for active midday re warming as well as to maintain a normothermic body temperature for longer periods at night. This study shows that colour should be considered when deploying bat boxes; black boxes are preferable for those bats that use passive rewarming, even in winter when food availability is reduced.

article,Could human cold adaptation decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"Lesna, I. Kralova and Rychlikova, J. and Vavrova, L. and Vybiral, S.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The impact of repeated exposure to cold and cold adaptation on human cardiovascular health is not fully understood. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of cold adaptation on cardiovascular risk factors, thyroid hormones and the capacity of humans to reset the damaging effect of oxidative stress. Ten well cold-adapted winter swimmers (CA) and 16 non-adapted controls (CON) were enroled in this experiment to test whether cold adaptation could influence the parameters of lipoprotein metabolism, cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC), homocysteine, thyroid hormones, antioxidant defence markers (reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1), glutathione reductase (GR), catalase (CAT) and paraoxonase 1 (PON1)) and oxidative stress markers (concentration of conjugated dienes (CD)). A decreased apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 (ApoB/ApoA1) ratio was found in the CA group (p <0.05), but other lipoprotein parameters, including CEC, did not differ significantly. Plasma homocysteine was lower in CA subjects in comparison with controls (p <0.05). Higher triiodothyronine (T3) values were observed in the CA compared to the CON (p <0.05) group, but TSH and other thyroid hormones did not differ between both groups. CA subjects had lower activity of GPX1 (p <0.05), lower concentrations of CD (p <0.05) and increased activities of PON1 (p <0.001) compared to CON subjects. A trend for decreased activity of CAT (p=0.06) in CA compared to CON groups was also observed, but GSH levels did not differ significantly. Zn concentration was higher in the CA group than in the CON group (p <0.001). Human cold adaptation can influence oxidative stress markers. Trends towards the improvement of cardiovascular risk factors in cold-adapted subjects also indicate the positive effect of cold adaptation on cardio-protective mechanisms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Thermoregulation and microhabitat use in mountain butterflies of the <i>genus Erebia</i>: Importance of fine-scale habitat heterogeneity,"Kleckova, Irena and Konvicka, Martin and Klecka, Jan",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Mountain butterflies have evolved efficient thermoregulation strategies enabling their survival in marginal conditions with short flight season and unstable weather. Understanding the importance of their behavioural thermoregulation by habitat use can provide novel information for predicting the fate of alpine Lepidoptera and other insects under ongoing climate change. We studied the link between microhabitat use and thermoregulation in adults of seven species of a butterfly genus Erebia co-occurring in the Austrian Alps. We captured individuals in the field and measured their body temperature in relation to microhabitat and air temperature. We asked whether closely related species regulate their body temperature differently, and if so, what is the effect of behaviour, species traits and individual traits on body to air and body to microhabitat temperature differences. Co-occurring species differed in mean body temperature. These differences were driven by active microhabitat selection by individuals and also by species-specific habitat preferences. Species inhabiting grasslands and rocks utilised warmer microclimates to maintain higher body temperature than woodland species. Under low air temperatures, species of rocky habitats heated up more effectively than species of grasslands and woodlands which allowed them to stay active in colder weather. Species morphology and individual traits play rather minor roles in the thermoregulatory differences: although large species and young individuals maintained higher body temperature. We conclude that diverse microhabitat conditions at small spatial scales probably contribute to sympatric occurrence of closely related species with different thermal demands and that preserving heterogeneous conditions in alpine landscapes might mitigate detrimental consequences of predicted climate change.

article,Body mapping of thermoregulatory and perceptual responses of males and females running in the cold,"Fournet, Damien and Ross, Lindsey and Voelcker, Thomas and Redortier, Bernard and Havenith, George",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Thermoregulatory parameters during exercise are typically reported as global responses (T-core and mean T-sk). In contrast, this study investigated regional skin temperatures (T-sk) over the body, in relation to regional skinfold thickness and regional perceptual responses for both sexes using a body-mapping approach. Nine males and nine females, of equivalent fitness, minimally clothed, ran for 40 min at 70\% (V) over dotO(2max) in a 10 degrees C, 50\% rh, 2.8 m s(-1) air velocity environment. T-sk was recorded by infrared thermography and processed to obtain population-averaged body maps. Rectal temperature and heart rate were monitored continuously throughout the running trial. Skinfold thickness was obtained for 24 sites and thermal sensation votes for 11 body regions. Males and females had similar rectal temperature, heart rate and regional sensations. Whole-body maps of T-sk highlighted the significantly lower regional T-sk for females (-1.6 degrees C overall, p < 0.01). However, the distribution of T-sk across the body was similar between sexes and this was not correlated with the distribution of skinfold thickness, except for the anterior torso. On the other hand, regional thermal sensation votes across the body were correlated with T-sk distribution during exercise (females: r=0.61, males: r=0.73, p<0.05), but not at rest. Our thermographic results demonstrate the similar T-sk distribution for active males and females during submaximal running in the cold, though shifted to a lower mean value for females. This T-sk distribution was associated with regional sensations but not with local fat thickness. The described body-mapping approach can have implications in physiological modelling and clothing design. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Further, the interplay between autophagy, the heat shock response (HSR), inflammation, and apoptosis have yet to be examined together under temperature conditions representative of human internal body temperatures at rest (37 degrees C) or under severe heat stress conditions (41 degrees C). Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine threshold changes in autophagy, the HSR, inflammation, and apoptosis to increasing levels of ex vivo heat stress. Whole blood was collected from 20 young (23 +/- 4 years; 10 men, 10 women) physically active participants. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated immediately (baseline) and after 90-min of whole blood heating in 37, 39, and 41 degrees C water baths, representative of normal resting (non-heat stress) as well as moderate and severe heat stress conditions in humans, respectively. At 37 degrees C, increased autophagic activity was demonstrated, with no change in the HSR, and inflammation. Subsequently, responses of autophagy, the HSR, and inflammation increased with a moderate heat stress (39 degrees C), with further increases in only autophagy and the HSR under a severe heat stress of 41 degrees C. We observed no increase in apoptosis under any temperature condition. Our findings show that in human PBMCs, the autophagy and HSR systems may act cooperatively to suppress apoptotic signaling following heat stress, which may in part be mediated by an acute inflammatory response.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102643,91,NA,NA,102643,Heat shock; Autophagy; HSP70; HSP90; Apoptosis; Inflammation

The birds were kept in two separate rooms at 24 degrees C or 36 degrees C from 32 to 42 d of age with four experimental groups in each room. The birds fed on the diets supplemented containing rich sources of long-chain saturated fatty acids (beef tallow), middle-length-chain saturated FA (coconut oil), monounsaturated FA (olive oil), or polyunsaturated FA (soybean oil) for ten days. At 36 degrees C, the highest body weight and lowest feed conversion ratio were recorded in the birds fed on the diets supplemented with coconut oil or beef tallow. Temperature and fat type significantly affected the activities of the mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes (P < 0.01). There was a significant interaction between the temperature and fat type (P < 0.01). Generally, electron transport chain complexes I-V enzymatic activities were decreased at 36 degrees C. The coconut oil-fed birds showed the highest complex I activity at both temperatures. The beef tallow-fed broilers showed the lowest complex II activity at 24 degrees C. In birds exposed to 36 degrees C, complex II activity was higher for birds fed saturated coconut oil or beef tallow than those feeding the unsaturated olive oil or soybean oil-supplemented diets. At 24 degrees C, the highest and lowest complex III activities were recorded for the coconut oil- and beef tallow-supplemented diets, respectively. At 36 degrees C, the activity of complex III was coconut oil > beef tallow > olive oil > soybean oil. At 24 degrees C, complex IV activity was highest in coconut oil- or soybean oil-fed broilers; and at 36 degrees C, complex IV showed the lowest activity in soybean oil-fed birds. The highest complex IV activity was observed in coconut oil-fed chickens followed by olive oil-fed and beef tallow-fed birds, respectively. At 24 or 36 degrees C, the highest and lowest complex V activity was observed in coconut oil-fed and soybean oil-fed chickens, respectively. ATP concentration and mitochondrial membrane potential were in the order of coconut oil > beef tallow > olive oil > soybean oil at both temperatures. Temperature and fat type significantly affected the avANT mRNA concentration. Exposure of broilers to 36 degrees C generally decreased the mRNA expression of avANT, with beef tallow- or coconut oil-supplemented birds showing a lower avANT mRNA expression than those receiving olive oil- or soybean oil-supplemented diets.

The purpose of this study was to examine the anxiety-like behavior of heat acclimated rats in a temperate or heated open field. After being raised in a 23 degrees C environment for one week, male Wistar rats were exposed to a heated environment (32 degrees C) for 3 h (3H), 14 days (14D), or 28 days (28D), with free access to food and water, and compared with rats reared in a temperate environment (23 degrees C; Cont). After heat exposure, behavioral changes were monitored using an open field test (OFT) in a heated (32 degrees C) or temperate environment (23 degrees C). Compared with those in the Cont group, the body weights of rats in the 14D and 28D groups were lower. The OFT in the heated environment showed that grooming time was longer in 3H and 14D rats. In the temperate environment, grooming time was longer in all the heated groups. Rats from the 3H and 28D groups spent longer time in the center square when tested in the temperate environment. Rearing activity increased in 28D rats in the temperate environment, while the number of line crossings did not differ significantly between the heated groups and the two open fields. These results suggest that heat acclimation affected not only the physiological index such as core body temperature but also the anxiety-like behavior, mainly in the temperate open field.

article,Progressive dry to humid hyperthermia alters exercise cerebral blood flow,"Rivas, Eric and Allie, Kyleigh N. and Salvador, Paolo M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Introduction: Exercising in hot conditions may increase the risk for exertional heat-related illness due to reduction in cerebral blood flow (CBF); however, the acute effect of exercise-induced changes on CBF during compensable and uncompensable heat stress remain unclear. We tested the hypothesis that exercising in hot dry and humid conditions would have different CBF responses. Methods: Nine healthy active males completed a 30 min baseline rest then 60 min of low intensity self-paced exercise (12 rating of perceived exertion) in a 1) control compensable neutral dry (CN; 23.7 +/- 0.7 degrees C; 10.7 +/- 0.8\%Rh) and 2) compensable hot dry (CH; 42.3 +/- 0.3 degrees C; 10.7 +/- 1.8\%Rh) that progressively increased to an uncompensable hot humid (UCH; 42.3 +/- 0.3 degrees C; 55.2 +/- 7.7\%Rh) environment in random order separated by at least 4 days. Results: We observed that during CN environments from rest through 60 min of exercise, middle cerebral velocity (MCAv(mean)) and conductance (MCAv(mean )CVC) remained unchanged. In contrast, during CH, MCAv(mean), MCAv(mean) CVC, and cardiac output (Q) increased and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) decreased. However, under UCH, MCAv(mean), MCAv(mean), CVC, and Q was reduced. No difference in mean arterial pressure or ventilation was observed during any condition. Only during UCH, end-tidal PO2 increased and PCO2 decreased. The redistribution of blood to the skin for thermoregulation (heart rate, skin blood flow and sweat rate) remained higher during exercise in UCH environments. Conclusions: Collectively, exercise cerebral blood flow is altered by an integrative physiological manner that differs in CN, CH, and UCH environments. The control of CBF may be secondary to thermoregulatory control which may provide an explanation for the cause of exertional heat illness.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.036,84,NA,398-406,NA,Thermoregulation; Brain blood flow; Compensable; Uncompensable

This study aimed to establish relationships among body surface thermography from different regions with rectal temperature (RT), birth weight (BW) and climatic variables in hair breed newborn lambs during early spring in an arid region. Data of body surface temperatures measured by infrared thermography (entire head, eye, muzzle, ear, entire body, shoulder, rump, loin, right flank, belly and leg), RT and BW were collected at 0, 12 and 24 h post-lambing in 85 lambs born in early spring. Relative humidity {[}RH], temperature [}Te] and temperature-humidity index {[}THI] were also recorded. RT was not correlated with surface temperatures at 0 and 24 h, but it was at 12 h with all of them (0.36 <= r <= 0.44). BW and some surface temperatures were negatively correlated at 0 and 24 h (-0.24 <= r <= -0.30), but positively at 12 h (0.25 <= r <= 0.27). All surface temperatures were positively correlated (0.51 <= r <= 0.85) with Te and THI in the three sampling times. Principal component (PC) analysis showed that PC1 explained the majority of the variance (71-72\%), followed by PC2 (8-9\%) at 0, 12 and 24 h. Body surface temperatures increased as Te and THI also increased, but decreased with the increase in HR. In conclusion, under early spring environment (predominantly cold), the variations in body surface temperatures of hair sheep neonates were more closely related to climatic variables than to RT and BW.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified candidate genes related to economic traits in domestic animals. The present study conducted a GWAS on body temperature changes in a broiler-type strain Taiwan country chickens (TCCs) under acute heat stress. A total of two hundred 30-week-old roosters of a broiler-type strain TCCs were used. The roosters were subjected to acute heat stress at 38 degrees C for 4 h, and their body temperature was recorded before and during heat stress. The change in body temperature (Delta T) of each rooster was calculated according to the difference between the initial temperature and the highest body temperature during heat stress. The roosters were categorized according to survival and Delta T at the end into dead, susceptible, resistant, and intermediate groups. Collected red blood cells were genotyped using a 600 K chicken single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. A GWAS for Delta T was conducted using the Cochran-Armitage trend test. Significant SNPs were annotated as candidate genes according to the nearest genes. Results indicated that the Delta T of the heat-resistant group was significantly lower than that of the heat-susceptible group. A total of 17 SNPs belonging to 8 candidate genes, 352 SNPs for 78 candidate genes, and 174 significant SNPs for 63 candidate genes were identified in the association analyses in the dead vs. survival, resistant vs. susceptible, and intermediate vs. susceptible groups, respectively. The annotated candidate genes are associated with apoptosis, cellular response to external stimuli, and signal transduction pathways.

In addition, women felt cool, scored by a visual analogue scale, at a higher T-E than men (18.3 +/- 3.0 degrees C for women vs 14.6 +/- 2.6 degrees C for men, P < 0.001). This study demonstrates a sex difference in response to cold exposure: women require shivering as a source of heat production earlier than men. This difference could be important and sex should be considered when using cooling protocols in physiological studies.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.08.016,77,NA,137-144,NA,Cold temperature; Sex characteristics; Shivering; Skin temperature; Thermogenesis; Thermosensing

Chapal and Zhang, Xin and Haider, Zeeshan and Hu, Peng and Zhao, Gang",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Cryosurgery is a promising novel minimally invasive surgical technique to eradicate carcinoma and non-carcinoma tissues by freezing. In this research, we applied a transient 3D two-phase refrigerant flow model inside the LN2 boiling chamber as well as a bioheat transfer model inside the tissues to evaluate the optimized ablation outcome during prostatic cryosurgery. For the evaluation of the scenarios, a defect function was used that considers non-ablated target tissue (prostate/cancer tissue) as well as ablated healthy tissue, in which the ablated tissue was evaluated using a temperature threshold. Three different configurations using three LN2 cryoprobes were analyzed during the modeling study, and the best configuration with the three LN2 cryoprobes positioned isoscelesly was found. For this configuration, temperature distributions and temperature profiles at specific points within the tissue were investigated numerically. Owing to its low computational cost, the 3D coupled model has an advantage in accurate modeling cryosurgery for curing numerous diseases.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.07.002,76,NA,58-67,NA,Prostatic cryosurgery; Refrigerant flow; Optimization; Muliprobe placement
article,Effect of body fat and gender on body temperature distribution,"Neves, Eduardo Borba and Chierighini Salamunes, Ana Carla and de Oliveira, Rafael Melo and Wan Stadnik, Adriana Maria",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"It is well known that body composition can influence peripheral heat loss and skin temperature. That the distribution of body fat is affected by gender is well known; however, there is little information on how body composition and gender influences the measure of skin temperature. This study evaluated skin temperature distribution according to body fat percentage (BF\%) and gender. A sample of 94 apparently healthy volunteers (47 women and 47 men) was assessed with Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) and infrared thermography (mean, maximum and minimum temperatures - T-mean, T-Max and T-Min). The sample was divided into groups, according to health risk classification, based on BF\%, as proposed by the American College of Sports Medicine: Average (n = 58), Elevated (n = 16) or High (n = 20). Women had lower Tmean in most regions of interest (ROI). In both genders, group High had lower temperature values than Average and Elevated in the trunk, upper and lower limbs. In men, palms and posterior hands had a tendency (p < 0.05) for increased temperature along with increased BF\%. T-Mean, T-Max and T-Min of trunk, upper and lower limbs were negatively correlated with BF\% and the fat percentage of each segment (upper limbs, lower limbs and trunk). The highest correlations found in women were between posterior trunk and BF\% (rho = -0.564, p < 0.001) and, in men, between anterior trunk and BF\% (rho = -0.760, p < 0.001). Overall, this study found that women have lower skin temperature than men, which was related with higher BF\%. Facial temperature seems not to be influenced by body fat. With the future collection of data on the relationship between BF\% and skin temperature while taking into account factors such as body morphology, gender, and ethnicity, we conclude that measurement of BF may be reliably estimated with the use of thermal imaging technology.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.10.017,70,B,1-8,NA,Thermal imaging; Temperature distribution; Skin temperature; Body composition; Adipose tissue; Gender
article,Numerical simulation of time fractional dual-phase-lag model of heat transfer within skin tissue during thermal therapy,"Kumar, Dinesh and Rai, K. N.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In this paper, we investigated the thermal behavior in living biological tissues using time fractional dual-phase-lag bioheat transfer (DPLBHT) model subjected to Dirichelt boundary condition in presence of metabolic and electromagnetic heat sources during thermal therapy. We solved this bioheat transfer model using finite element Legendre wavelet Galerkin method (FELWGM) with help of block pulse function in sense of Caputo fractional order derivative. We compared the obtained results from FELWGM and exact method in a specific case, and found a high accuracy. Results are interpreted in the form of standard and anomalous cases for taking different order of time fractional DPLBHT model. The time to achieve hyperthermia position is discussed in both cases as standard and time fractional order derivative. The success of thermal therapy in the treatment of metastatic cancerous cell depends on time fractional order derivative to precise prediction and control of temperature. The effect of variability of parameters such as time fractional derivative, lagging times, blood perfusion coefficient, metabolic heat source and transmitted power on dimensionless temperature distribution in skin tissue is discussed in detail.

article,Local muscle cooling does not impact expression of mitochondrial-related genes,"Shute, Robert and Heesch, Matthew and Laursen, Terence and Slivka, Dustin",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Recovery that takes place in a cold environment after endurance exercise elevates PGC-1 alpha mRNA whereas ERR alpha and NRF2 mRNA expression are inhibited. However, the effect of local skeletal muscle cooling on mitochondrial-related gene expression is unknown. Purpose: Todetermine the impact of local skeletal muscle cooling during recovery from an acute bout of exercise on mitochondrial-related gene expression. Methods: Recreationally-trained male cyclists (n=8, age 25 +/- 3 y, height 181 +/- 6 cm, weight 79 8 kg, 12.8 +/- 3.6\% body fat, VO2peak 4.52 +/- 0.88 L.min(-1) protocol) completed a 90-min variable intensity cycling protocol followed by 4 h of recovery. During recovery, ice was applied intermittently to one leg (ICE) while the other leg served as a control (CON). Intramuscular temperature was recorded continuously. Muscle biopsies were taken from each vastus lateralis at 4 h post-exercise for the analysis of mitochondrial-related gene expression. Results: Intramuscular temperature was colder in ICE (26.7 +/- 1.1 degrees C) than CON (35.5 +/- 0.1 degrees C) throughout the 4 h recovery period (p < 0.001). There were no differences in expression of PGC-1 alpha, TFAM, NRF1, NRF2, or ERRa mRNA between ICE and CON after the 4 h recovery period. Conclusion: Local muscle cooling after exercise does not impact the expression of mitochondrial biogenesis related genes compared to recovery from exercise in control conditions. When these data are considered with previous research, the stimuli for cold-induced gene expression alterations may be related to factors other than local muscle temperature. Additionally, different intramuscular temperatures should be examined to determine dose-response of mitochondrial-related gene expression.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.04.008,67,NA,35-39,NA,Exercise; Ice; Vastus Lateralis; PGC-1alpha

The results showed that the vaginal temperatures of Y (38.4-38.5 degrees C) were (P < 0.05) lower than that of H (38.8 degrees C) during the hot season. The apoptotic rates of ear fibroblasts derived from Y (6h: 1.1\%; 12h: 1.6\%; 24h: 2.6\%) were lower (P < 0.05) than those of cells derived from H (6h: 1.8\%; 12h: 4.0\%; 24h: 6.9\%), respectively, after heat shock (42 degrees C).

As a biological marker, miRNA has been used for the early diagnosis of diseases and the evaluation of some physiological state. We constructed two small RNA libraries with the serums of rats treated or not with cold conditions (4 degrees C for 12 h) by deep sequencing, in order to understand the miRNAs' expressions of cold-exposed rats and find new cold-responsive biological markers. 485 conserved miRNAs and 287 novel miRNAs were identified in the two libraries by comparing to the known miRNAs of rat in miRBase 21.0 Differential expression analysis showed that 56 conserved miRNAs and 3 novel miRNAs were expressed differentially in low ambient temperature. The qRT-PCR results confirmed that rno-miR-151-3p, rno-miR-210-3p, rno-miR-425-5p, rno-miR-383-5p, rno-miR-92a-3p, rno-miR-98-5p and rno-miR-328a-3p decreased significantly in rats serums treated with cold exposure. The expressions of the 7 miRNAs changed significantly in cold-exposed rats' livers too. rno-miR-383-5p decreased significantly, but all the others increased significantly. Thus, the 7 miRNAs were considered as cold-responsive miRNAs of rat. 670 target genes of the 7 cold-responsive miRNAs were predicted. KEGG analysis showed that they were enriched in 28 pathways and most of them were enriched by metabolic pathway.

We analysed thermal behaviour and locomotory activity of hibernating greater mouse eared bats Myotis myotis and found two types of movement behaviour related to body temperature, i.e. movement at high fur temperature and at low fur temperatures (Tflow; <5 degrees C). First Tflow movements appeared at the beginning of March and often occurred during long torpor bouts. In most cases, Tflow events represented slow displacements between clusters of bats. In several cases, however, departure or arrivals from and into clusters was also recorded without any elevation in body temperature. Distance travelled, flight duration and speed of locomotion during Tflow events was lower than in high fur temperature events. Such behaviour could allow bats to save energy long-term and prolong torpor bouts.

article,The influence of cooling and TRPM8 ion channel activation on the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines in normotensive and hypertensive rats,"Kozyreva, Tamara V. and Khramova, Galina M. and Voronova, Irina P. and Evtushenko, Anna A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The role of thermosensitive TRP ion channels in physiological processes in the whole organism is far from being clear. In present work we tried to understand the possible participation of the cold-sensitive ion channel TRPM8 in regulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine level in blood, and to see if hypertension (widely spread disease) changes this relationship. Experiments were carried out on normotensive Wistar rats and rats with inherited stress-induced arterial hypertension. The effects of deep rapid and slow cooling with decrease in rectal temperature by 3 degrees C, and activation of the skin TRPM8 ion channel by its agonist menthol (application of 1\% L-menthol) on the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1 beta and TNF alpha) in blood have been studied. The data have shown that the TRPM8 ion channel participates in regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine in the whole organism, as well as exposure to cold. In normotensive animals the activation of the cold-sensitive TRPM8 ion channel in skin by its agonist menthol without any temperature shifts causes an increase (about two fold) of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1 beta in blood without any changes in the level of TNF alpha. The effect of cooling (slow or rapid) on IL-6 and IL-1 beta is comparable with the effect of the TRPM8 activation. The changes in TNF alpha concentration were observed only at slow cooling. In hypertensive rats there were no changes in the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines under the effect of cooling or activation of the TRPM8 ion channel. This evidences for the decrease in TRPM8 activity under arterial hypertension. One of possible mechanisms of profound changes at arterial hypertension may be the alteration in activity of some ion channels, and TRPM8 is one of them. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on sensing, temperature controlling and wireless communicating technology, a specially designed tester has been developed in this study to evaluate the thermal and moisture behaviour of the surface of textiles in moving status. A temperature acquisition system and a temperature controllable hotplate have been established to test temperature and simulate the heat of human body, respectively. Relative humidity of the surface of fabric in the dynamic process has been successfully tested through sensing. Meanwhile, wireless communication technology was applied to transport the acquired data of temperature and humidity to computer for further processing. Continuous power supply was achieved by intensive contact between an elastic copper plate and copper ring on the rotating shaft. This tester provides the platform to evaluate the thermal and moisture behaviour of textiles. It enables users to conduct a dynamic analysis on the temperature and humidity together with the thermal and moisture transport behaviour of the surface of fabric in moving condition. Development of this tester opens the door of investigation on the micro-climate of textiles in real time service, and eventually benefits the understanding of the sensation comfort and wellbeing of apparel wearers.

Therefore, accurately determining the core body temperature of wild animals during capture is crucial for monitoring hyperthermia and the efficacy of cooling procedures. We investigated if microchip thermometry can accurately reflect core body temperature changes during capture and cooling interventions in the springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis), a medium-sized antelope. Subcutaneous temperature measured with a temperature-sensitive microchip was a weak predictor of core body temperature measured by temperature-sensitive data loggers in the abdominal cavity (R-2=0.32, bias > 2 degrees C). Temperature-sensitive microchips in the gluteus muscle, however, provided an accurate estimate of core body temperature (R-2=0.76, bias=0.012 degrees C). Microchips inserted into muscle therefore provide a convenient and accurate method to measure body temperature continuously in captured antelope, allowing detection of hyperthermia and the efficacy of cooling procedures.

Our study aimed to investigate the effects of incubation temperature on embryonic lipid metabolism in the liver of ducks. To fully evaluate the effects, thermal treatment was given between embryonic ages 11 and 24 days with a 1 degrees C higher incubation temperature than the control group, and lipid metabolism parameters in the liver and blood serum were analyzed both at embryonic stage day 20 and 2 weeks post-hatching. Our results showed no significant changes in the embryonic stage in total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the blood serum (P > 0.05). Additionally, the mRNA expression levels and enzyme activities of fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), and elongase of very long chain fatty acids (ELOVL) did not show significant changes either in the embryonic stage or at hatching day 20 (P > 0.05). However, there were significant changes in the gene expression and enzyme activities of TC, LDL-C and FAS at post-hatching stages (P <= 0.05).

Besides, the species is of forensic value. Currently, studies focusing on the development of this species are limited. Understanding the developmental patterns of M. spiracularis, therefore, is important for controlling populations of this pest and for estimating the minimum postmortem interval (PMImin). Here, we studied the development of M. spiracularis exposed to seven constant temperatures ranging from 16 to 34 degrees C. The developmental durations, accumulated degree hours and larval body length changes were measured. Three kinds of development models that can be used to estimate the PMImin were established, including isomorphen diagram, isomegalen diagram and thermal summation model. The duration of M. spiracularis development at 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31 and 34 degrees C from egg to adult stage were 1131.1 +/- 34.5, 807.3 +/- 9.3, 529.6 +/- 1.8, 367.0 +/- 8.8, 302.4 +/- 7.0, 250.0 +/- 2.1 and 232.6 +/- 1.9 h, respectively.

article,Thermoregulation in Malayan sun bears (<i>Helarctos malayanus</i>) and its consequences for <i>in situ</i> conservation,"Schneider, Marion and Ziegler, Thomas and Kolter, Lydia",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Thermoregulation in Malayan sun bears is not fully understood. Therefore, in this study the effect of meteorological variables on both behavioural and autonomic thermoregulatory mechanisms in sun bears was examined in order to identify temperature thresholds for the activation of various thermoregulatory mechanisms. Infrared thermography was used to non-invasively determine body surface temperature (T-S) distribution in relation to ambient temperature (T-A) and to determine the thermoneutral zone (TNZ) of sun bears. Thermographic measurements were performed on 10 adult sun bears at T-A between 5 degrees C and 30 degrees C in three European zoos. To assess behaviours that contribute to thermoregulation, nine adult sun bears were observed at T-A ranging from 5 degrees C to 34 degrees C by instantaneous scan sampling in 60 s intervals for a total of 787 h. Thermographic measurements revealed that the TNZ of sun bears lies between 24 degrees C and 28 degrees C and that heat is equally dissipated over the body surface. Behavioural data showed that behaviours related to thermoregulation occurred in advance of energetically costly autonomic mechanisms, and were highly correlated with T-A and solar radiation. While the temperature threshold for the onset of thermoregulatory behaviours below the TNZ lies around 15 degrees C, which is well below the lower critical temperature (T-LC) assessed by thermography, the onset for behaviours to prevent overheating occurred at 28 degrees C, which was closer to the estimated upper critical temperature (T-UC) of sun bears. These findings provide useful data on the thermal requirements of sun bears with respect to the species potential to cope with the effects of climate change and deforestation which are occurring in their natural range. Furthermore, these results may have important implications for the care and welfare of bears in captivity and should be taken into consideration, when designing and managing facilities.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102646,91,NA,NA,102646,Thermoregulation; Climate change; Helarctos malayanus; Infrared thermography; Malayan sun bear; Thermoneutral zone

The results of our study show that the body temperature is robustly regulated while hypothalamic and cortical temperatures vary on challenges to ambient cold (6 degrees C) and warm (36 degrees C) exposure in awake rats.

In order to improve welfare and to maximise successful rehabilitation, it is important to incorporate new technology and understanding into husbandry, assessment and diagnostic protocols and practices used within these rescue centres. This study assessed and diagnosed hypothermia, a common condition of new arrivals as a result of shock, using corneal temperature as recorded by a FLIR E6Obx infrared camera, at Prickles and Paws Hedgehog Rescue Centre, Cubert, Cornwall. Corneal temperatures were recorded ranging from 14.3 to 37.4 degrees C. The thermal camera provided greater accuracy over observational diagnosis made by rescue centre staff, with a significant difference between diagnostic categories, demonstrating misdiagnosis by observation alone of 42\% of individuals.. There was a higher mortality within those diagnosed by IRT to be `mildly hypothermic' or `hypothermic', with death occurring within 72 h of diagnosis.

article,Redefining physiological responses of moose (<i>Alces alces</i>) to warm environmental conditions,"Thompson, Daniel P. and Crouse, John A. and Jaques, Scott and Barboza, Perry S.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"We tested the concept that moose (Alces alces) begin to show signs of thermal stress at ambient air temperatures as low as 14 degrees C. We determined the response of Alaskan female moose to environmental conditions from May through September by measuring core body temperature, heart rate, respiration rate, rate of heat loss from exhaled air, skin temperature, and fecal and salivary glucocorticoids. Seasonal and daily patterns in moose body temperature did not passively follow the same patterns as environmental variables. We used large changes in body temperature (>= 1.25 degrees C in 24hr) to indicate days of physiological tolerance to thermal stressors. Thermal tolerance correlated with high ambient air temperatures from the prior day and with seasonal peaks in solar radiation (June), ambient air temperature and vapor pressure (July). At midday (12:00hr), moose exhibited daily minima of body temperature, heart rate and skin temperature (difference between the ear artery and pinna) that coincided with daily maxima in respiration rate and the rate of heat lost through respiration. Salivary cortisol measured in moose during the morning was positively related to the change in air temperature during the hour prior to sample collection, while fecal glucocorticoid levels increased with increasing solar radiation during the prior day. Our results suggest that free-ranging moose do not have a static threshold of ambient air temperature at which they become heat stressed during the warm season. In early summer, body temperature of moose is influenced by the interaction of ambient temperature during the prior day with the seasonal peak of solar radiation. In late summer, moose body temperature is influenced by the interaction between ambient temperature and vapor pressure. Thermal tolerance of moose depends on the intensity and duration of daily weather parameters and the ability of the animal to use physiological and behavioral responses to dissipate heat loads.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102581,90,NA,NA,102581,Alaska; Alces alces; Body temperature; Heart rate; Moose; Respiration rate; Thermoregulation

After they were exposed to heat, the samples were placed in wet sand medium, and their survival and regeneration abilities were evaluated daily for 56 days. The results showed that lethal temperatures significantly reduced the shoot regeneration potential, delayed both shoot and protonemal emergence times and reduced the protonemal emergence area. In addition, the expression of nine genes (HSF3, HSP70, ERF, LEA, ELIP, LHCA, LHCB, Tr288 and DHN) was induced by temperature stress, as assessed after 30 min of exposure. Additionally, a new thermal tolerance level for dried B. argenteum - 120 degrees C for 20 min - was determined, which was the highest temperature recorded for this moss; this tolerance exceeded the previous record of 110 degrees C for 10 min. These findings help elucidate the survival mechanism of this species under heat shock stress and facilitate the recovery and restoration of destroyed ecosystems.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102469,89,NA,NA,102469,Desiccation biology; Gurbantunggut desert; Thermal tolerance; Regeneration
article,Lettuce plant growth and tipburn occurrence as affected by airflow using a multi-fan system in a plant factory with artificial light,"Ahmed, Hesham A. and Tong Yu-xin and Yang Qi-chang",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"A multi-fan system (MFS) for single culture beds was developed to improve the airflow in a plant factory with artificial light. The MFS had seven fans which were installed on both the front and back sides of culture beds to generate airflow from two opposite horizontal directions. The fans that push the air into the culture bed were air inlets while those that pull the air out of the culture bed were air outlets. In this study, three airflow patterns were evaluated: T-1, the front and back sides of the culture bed were air inlets; T-2, the front side was an air inlet and the backside was an air outlet; and T-3, both the front and back sides were air outlets. A culture bed with no MFS was used as a control (T-4). Lettuce growth and tipburn occurrence were evaluated and leaf boundary layer resistance (1/g(bv)), sensible heat flux (S-h), and latent heat flux (L-h) of lettuce plants were estimated. The airflow pattern in T-1 improved the air velocity (V-a) by an average of 0.75 m s(-1) and a variation coefficient of 65\%. The 1/g(bv), decreased significantly with the increase in V-a, and the lowest value of 54.0 s m(-1) was observed in T-1. The low resistance to heat and moisture transfer enhanced the Sh and Lh of lettuce plants. The average S-h and L-h were 40\% and 46\% higher in T-1 compared with those in T-4. The fresh and dry weights of lettuce plants in T-1 were 1.13 and 1.06 higher than those in T-4, respectively. No tipburn occurrence was observed in lettuce plants grown under the MFS while five leaves per plant were injured with tipburn in T-4. The results indicated that improving the airflow can improve the growth of indoor cultured lettuce and alleviate the occurrence of tipburn due to the decrease in the 1/g(bv) and the increase in the transpiration rate.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102496,88,NA,NA,102496,Plant factory; Air velocity; Sensible heat; Leaf boundary layer resistance; Lettuce growth; Tipburn occurrence
article,Heat strain in chemical protective ensembles: Effects of fabric thermal properties,"Xu, Xiaojiang and Rioux, Timothy P. and Pomerantz, Natalie and Tew, Stephanie and Blanchard, Laurie A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"An ongoing challenge in material science has been to reduce heat strain experienced by individuals wearing chemical protective ensembles. The objective of this study is to analyze the relationship between the thermal properties of eight chemical protective fabrics and heat strain in ten chemical protective ensembles constructed with those fabrics. The fabric samples were tested on a sweating guarded hot plate to measure fabric thermal and evaporative resistance. The ensembles were then tested on thermal manikins to measure ensemble thermal and evaporative resistance. An empirical thermoregulatory model, the Heat Strain Decision Aid (HSDA), was used to predict thermal responses of core temperature and endurance times. Model inputs included ensemble thermal and evaporative resistances, four environmental conditions and a metabolic rate of 400 W. The fabric intrinsic thermal and evaporative resistances ranged from 0.01 to 0.05 m(2) degrees C.W-1 and from 5.9 to 12.82 m(2) Pa.W-1, respectively. Ensemble intrinsic thermal and evaporative resistances ranged from 0.23 to 0.31 m 2 degrees C-W-1 and 51.7-67.8 m(2) Pa-W-1, respectively. Predicted endurance times varied from 170 to 300 min at 20 degrees C/50\% RH/2 m s(-1) and 26 degrees C/55\% RH/9 m s(-1) conditions, and varied from 91 to 98 min at 30 degrees C/75\% RH/2 m s(-1) and 40 degrees C/20\% RH/2 m s(-1) conditions. Improved fabric thermal properties reduced heat strain and extended endurance times, but the magnitude of the extended times is dependent on the environmental conditions. Consequently, the benefits of improved fabric thermal properties may only be observed under certain environmental conditions.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102435,86,NA,NA,102435,Heat stress; Thermal manikins; Thermal and evaporative resistances; Sweating hotplate; Modeling
article,"Heat shock sensitivity of adult male fertility in the parasitoid wasp <i>Anisopteromalus calandrae</i> (Hymenoptera, Pteromalidae)","Chevrier, Claude and Thanh Manh Nguyen and Christophe, Bressac",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In insects, decreased reproduction is a sublethal consequence of high temperatures, with males being more sensitive to this in many species. In hymenoptera, arrhenotokous parthenogenesis means that female offspring are produced using sperm and are thus diploid, while males are haploid. Consequently, sperm stocks in males and females (after copulation) are a key regulator of the sex ratio. Anisopteromalus calandrae is a parasitoid wasp in which males can suffer from subfertility due to a drastic decrease in sperm count after exposure to high temperatures during a critical early pupal stage. However, in this species spermatogenesis continues during adulthood, therefore the heat sensitivity of adult males remains to be studied. Laboratory studies were conducted on virgin and previously mated young adult males under control (30 degrees C) and heat shock (10 min at 48 degrees C) conditions to exhaust their initial sperm stock. After heat shock, in both virgin and already mated males, the individual sperm potential was half that of controls. Both groups continuously produced sperm, but sperm stock of heat shocked males' never reached that of the controls. Heat shock reduced survival at 10 days only in previously experienced males but had no impact on the mating ability in competition for a female compared to controls. Despite a reduced sperm count, heat shocked males had fully fertile spermatozoa. Such a physiological response to heat shock in a species with continuous sperm production could be of major interest for both wild populations in a context of temperature variations and parasitoid wasps introduced for agronomical purposes.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102419,85,NA,NA,102419,Heat stress; Male fitness; Spermatogenesis; Sperm stock; Mating competition
article,Effect of the menstrual cycle phase on foot skin temperature during menthol application in young women,"Uchida, Yuki and Tsunekawa, Chinami and Sato, Izumi and Morimoto, Keiko",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"According to the literature, the arteriovenous anastomoses in the peripheral parts (ex. hands and feet) respond thermal stimulation susceptibly. Thus, the feet are sensitive to cold stimulation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of menstrual cycle on skin temperature (T-sk) of the foot during menthol application in young women. T-sk and partial cutaneous blood flow in the foot, tympanic temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, thermal sensation and pleasantness during the preovulatory (P), luteal (L), and menstrual (M) phases during menthol application in young women using thermography, laser Doppler flowmetry, a digital blood pressure monitor, and VAS scale were examined at 25 degrees C. After application of the 0.5\% menthol solution to the right foot, the measurements were continued for 20 min. The T-sk of the second and third right toes in the P phase were lower than that in the L phase. The T-sk of the little right toe in the P phase was lower than that in the L and M phases. No significant differences were observed in the T-sk of the dorsum of right foot, cutaneous Laser-Doppler flow in the right great toe, tympanic temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, thermal sensation and pleasantness among the phases. The menstrual cycle phase did not affect T-sk in the dorsum of the foot, but it affected T-sk in some toes during menthol application.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102401,85,NA,NA,102401,Menstrual cycle; Skin temperature; Skin blood flow; Toes; Menthol

Exposing broilers to high ambient temperature usually induces lower feed intake and energy imbalance. We investigated the molecular mechanisms by which heat stress impairs the appetite via dysfunction in hypothalamus of the broilers. Broilers were allocated to three groups: the normal control (NC) group, and fed ad libitum; heat-stress (HS) group, and fed ad libitum; pair-fed (PF) group, which received the feed intake equal to HS group. Experiment lasted from the age of 28 to 42 d. The results showed that HS increased the head surface temperature of broiler and changed hypothalamic ultrastructure. HS treatment also increased the serum corticosterone in the broilers after 7 days of heat stress, elevated the FT4 and FT3 after 14 days of heat stress. Heat stress of 14 days showed a tendency to increase the leptin. However, the serum corticosterone in the HS group had no significant difference after 14 days of heat stress. In addition, HS treatment decreased the expression of orexigenic gene neuropeptide Y (NPY) after 14 days of heat stress, while HS treatment had no effect on the reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as the gene expression of AMPK alpha 1 and LKB1 in the hypothalamus. In conclusion, HS increased the surface temperature of head in broiler, and then altered the integrity of hypothalamus. Meanwhile, HS increased the serum corticosterone which may ascribe to the activation of HPA axis in the broilers. In addition, chronic heat stress decreased the expression of orexigenic gene NPY, which may cause the broiler to reduce feed intake.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.02.025,81,NA,110-117,NA,Chicken; High ambient temperature; Hypothalamic ultrastructure; Appetite regulation
article,Effect of thermal manipulation during embryogenesis on the promoter methylation and expression of myogenesis-related genes in duck skeletal muscle,"Wang, Yushi and Yan, Xiping and Liu, Hehe and Hu, Shenqiang and Hu, Jiwei and Li, Liang and Wang, Jiwen",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Avian embryos are an ideal system to investigate the effect of incubation temperature on embryonic development, but the characteristics and mechanisms of temperature effects on poultry embryonic myogenesis are unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of increasing the incubation temperature by 1 degrees C on the expression of nine myogenesis-related genes in ducks and then explored the correlation between the alteration of promoter methylation and the expression of two of the nine genes under thermal manipulation (TM). The qRT-PCR results showed that TM during embryonic days (ED) 1-10 promoted (P < 0.05) the expression of genes in breast muscle (PAX3, PAX7, MYOG, MCK, SIX1, TNNC1) and leg muscle (MYOD, MYOG, MYF5, MCK, AKIRIN2, TNNC1). TM during ED10-20 promoted the expression of PAX3, MYFS and MCK and inhibited AKIRIN2 expression in breast muscle (P < 0.05); however, it inhibited the expression of PAX3, PAX7, MYOD, MYOG, MYF5, SIX1, AKIRIN2 and TNNC1 and promoted MCK expression in leg muscle (P < 0.05). TM during ED20-27 inhibited the expression of genes in breast muscle (PAX7) and leg muscle (MYOD, MYOG, MYF5, TNNC1) and promoted MCK expression in breast and leg muscle (P < 0.05). Furthermore, with the Sequenom MassARRAY platform, it was observed that the average methylation level of AKIRIN2 (ED10) and TNNC1 (ED20) in leg muscle decreased (P < 0.05) after TM. Notably, we found significant (P < 0.05) inverse correlations between the methylation and mRNA levels of AKIRIN2 under TM during ED1-10 (r = - 0.969) and ED10-20 (r = - 0.805). Taken together, TM during ED1-10 was more favorable for improving duck myogenesis-related gene expression than TM during ED10-20 and ED20-27. TM during duck embryogenesis seemed to have a greater effect on the development of leg muscle than breast muscle and might alter AKIRIN2 expression by changing its promoter methylation status. These findings may be helpful to understand temperature effects on the muscle development of avian embryos and to explore the role of epigenetic regulation during this process.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.12.023,80,NA,75-81,NA,Incubation temperature; Duck; Embryogenesis; Skeletal muscle development; Promoter methylation
article,Relationship between residual feed intake and radiated heat loss using infrared thermography in young beef bulls,"Thompson, S. and Schaefer, A. L. and Crow, G. H. and Basarab, J. and Colyn, J. and Ominski, K.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Residual feed intake (RFI) has been used to select metabolically efficient cattle in beef breeding programs, particularly for sire selection. Adoption of genetic selection using RFI has been limited due to the cost and difficulty of measuring individual feed intake. An alternative method of predicting RFI is to measure radiated heat loss using infrared thermography (IRT) as previous studies have shown promise using this technique to predict metabolic efficiency in mature cows, heifers, and growing bulls. The objective of this study was to explore use of IRT to predict RFI in growing beef bulls. Sixty bulls in each of two years were fed either a forage based or a grain-based ration. Eye (Ey) and cheek (Ck) surface temperatures were measured using infrared images of the head collected on 16 and 14 sample days in Years 1 and 2, respectively, using a FLIR S60 camera. In Year 2, infrared images were collected continuously using a within-pen FLIR A310 camera system. Bulls were grouped into low, medium and high classes based on +/- 0.5 standard deviations of backfat adjusted residual feed intake (RFIFat); RFIFat values ranged from - 2.27 to + 2.61 kg DM day(-1) (mean = 0.0; SD = 0.61). Sample day Ey and Ck temperatures were pooled and an average temperature was calculated for individual bulls. Average Ey and Ck temperatures measured using the FLIR S60 and the within-pen camera did not differ significantly across low, medium and high RFI groups (P > 0.05). Temperature deviations associated with extremes in ambient temperature (placing animals outside their thermoneutral zone) or underlying subclinical health problems could bias results in IRT measurements and RFI ranking. Standardization of IRT data and the conditions during measurement is necessary to more accurately assess its potential use to predict RFI.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.10.007,78,NA,304-311,NA,Infrared thermography; Eye temperature; Cheek temperature; Residual feed intake; Beef bulls

Currently, the treatment of hypothermia in China is limited to external rewarming, which is of low efficiency and is not effective for patients suffering moderate to severe hypothermia. We thus proposed a vascular interventional heating method which directly heats the blood flow via a minimally invasive heating needle for rewarming. And a numerical simulation using a compartment model based on finite difference method was conducted. A set of whole body heating treatment simulation was also developed. Appropriate treatment parameters and procedures can be set and adjusted based on patient physical parameters. Here temperature response curves of different heating modes were obtained and analyzed. It was demonstrated that the desired thermal response can be achieved by adjusting the heating power and heating time, ensuring controllable accuracy in the treatment of patients with severe hypothermia.

Numerous physiological changes occur during a typical torpor-arousal cycle including variations in heart rate and blood flow. Such cycle possesses characteristics of ischemia-reperfusion cycles that can lead to oxidative stress in non-hibernating models. Interestingly, hibernators can cope with these conditions and the complete molecular picture underlying this adaptation is not fully understood. Non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), can impact expression and activity of various targets and have been associated with oxidative stress response. This work was aimed at assessing expression of oxidative stress-associated non-coding RNAs and their targets during hibernation. Measurement of miRNAs miR-93, miR-141, miR-144 and miR-200a, lncRNAs Mhrt and ODRUL, as well as of several targets associated with the Nrf2 signaling cascade including Keapl was conducted using qRT-PCR in hibernating hearts of the thirteen-lined ground squirrel, Ictidomys tridecemlineatus. Elevated Nrf2 levels and reduced miR-200a levels were notably observed in hibernating versus euthermic samples. Functional analysis of targets predicted to be regulated by the investigated miRNAs was performed and revealed transcriptional regulation and phosphorylation as relevant processes. These results highlight a potential interplay between non-coding RNAs and targets associated with oxidative stress response during hibernation and further strengthen the underlying importance of non-coding RNAs in cold torpor.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.05.008,75,NA,38-44,NA,Hibernation; Torpor; Antioxidant defense; Oxidative stress; Non-coding RNAs; MiRNAs; LncRNAs

A finite element analysis in Crocodylomorpha,"Clarac, F. and Goussard, F. and Teresi, L. and Buffrenil, Vde. and Sansalone, V.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In order to assess the implication of the crocodylomorph ornamented osteoderms on the skin conduction during basking, we have performed three dimensional modeling and finite element analyses on a sample which includes both extant dry bones and well-preserved fossils tracing back to the Early Jurassic. In purpose to reveal the possible implication of the superficial ornamentation on the osteoderm heat conduction, we repeated the simulation on an equivalent set of smoothed 3D-modeled osteoderms. The comparison of the results evidenced that the presence of the apical sculpture has no significant impact on the osteoderm global conduction. Furthermore, as we also aimed to assess the influence of the inner bone porosity on the osteoderm conduction, we modified the heat equation parameters so that the 3D-modeled osteoderms successively score the compact and the cancellous bone properties (i.e. mass density, heat capacity, thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity). Finally, we repeated the analyses using the soft-dermis properties which lead to outline that neither the degree of porosity nor the presence of the osteoderms (in itself) significantly modifies the heat conduction through the crocodylomorph skin. Consequently, as hypothesized by previous authors, if the dermal shield happens to be involved into heat capture during basking for crocodylians, this process must mainly rely on a convective effect based on the osteoderm relative degree of vascularization. This last assumption could thus explain why the crocodylians which produce little metabolic heat would carry an entire vascularized osteoderm shield.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.06.003,69,NA,39-53,NA,Temperature; Heat transfer; Bone ornamentation; 3D modeling; Simulation

For better productive performance it is important to identify the most resilient genotypes. Thus, our objective was to evaluate the thermoregulatory responses of rams of tropical indigenous (Morada Nova and Santa Ines) and exotic breeds (Dorper and Texel), by monitoring the environmental and physiological indicators related to heat tolerance. The experiment was carried out in a tropical climate region (Cwa), in Brazil, for twelve months, which comprised spring, summer, autumn and winter. Thirty-three rams were divided into groups: Morada Nova (MN; n=8, red-coat), Santa Ines (SI; n=9, black-coat), Dorper (DO; n=8, white-coat) and Texel (TX; n=8, white-coat). The microclimatic variables were monitored, and the THI and BGHI comfort indices were calculated. Coat thickness and body surface temperatures were measured monthly, and serum triiodothyronine-T3 measurements and complete blood tests were performed. The physiological variables were evaluated every fifteen days and skin micro-biopsies Were performed in the summer and winter for histological evaluation. During the warmer seasons, the THI and BGHI reached values that indicated thermal discomfort. TX showed higher coat thickness throughout the year, increased physiological variables related to thermolysis, and reduced T3 (P < 0.05). The internal temperature was permanently lower in the MN, SI and DO (P < 0.05). The body surface temperatures were affected by the coat characteristics and wool length.

article,Genetic components in a thermal developmental plasticity of the beetle <i>Tribolium castaneum</i>,"Czarnoleski, Marcin and Kramarz, Paulina and Malek, Dariusz and Drobniak, Szymon M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Low developmental temperatures cause ectotherms to retard growth, postpone maturation, and emerge at either larger or smaller adult size. In this study, we explored how these thermal responses evolved, focusing on their genetic basis. We applied a full diallel breeding design on inbred lines of the flour beetle, Tribolium castatteum. To assess the proportional contributions of genetic and non-genetic effects, each genotype, a unique combination of parental haplotypes, was reared from an egg to imago at five developmental temperatures. Faster development of females vs. males was associated with comparatively larger body masses of females (pupae and imago). In contrast, the rapid development caused by warmer environments resulted in smaller beetles (pupae and imago), but there were significant differences in this trait among genotypes. Independent effects of parental haplotypes played the major role in explaining the variance of body mass, but interactive effects of parental haplotypes explained most of the variance in developmental length. Genotypes responded to the thermal environment in a markedly uniform way. Nevertheless, we found the low statistically significant variance in the slopes of thermal reaction norms for body mass and developmental, which was mainly driven by the interactive effects of parental haplotypes. Overall, the thermal plasticity of T. castaneum follows the most common pattern among ectotherms, the so-called temperature-size rule. Detection of the low genetic variance in the shape of this response supports the idea that thermal developmental plasticity remains under a strong selective pressure in ectotherms.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.01.015,68,A,55-62,NA,Body size; Development; Phenotypic plasticity; Temperature-size rule; Genetic variance; Beetles

Shrimp were randomly allocated in 9 tanks (30 shrimp per tank) and triplicate tanks were fed with diets containing different levels of C. butyricum (1 x 10(9) cfu/g): 0 mg g(-1) feed (Control), 100 mg g(-1) feed (CB-100), 200 mg g(-1) feed (CB-200) as treatment groups. The results indicated that dietary supplementation of C. butyricum increased the growth performance and decreased the feed conversion rate (FCR) of shrimp in the CB-100 group. HE stain showed that C. butyricum increased the intestine epithelium height of M. japonicus. C. butyricum supplemented in diets decreased center dot O-2 generation capacity and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and increased total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) activity and the expression level of heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) and metallothionein (mt) gene in intestine of shrimp cultured under normal condition for 56 d, while no significant changes in glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity and ferritin gene expression level.

article,Embryos of non-native anoles are robust to urban thermal environments,"Tiatragul, Sarin and Kurniawan, Audeline and Kolbe, Jason J. and Warner, Daniel A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The transformation of natural habitats into urban landscapes dramatically alters thermal environments, which in turn, can impact local biota. Ectothermic organisms that are oviparous are particularly sensitive to these altered environments because their embryos cannot behaviorally thermoregulate and the surrounding environment determines the temperature experienced during development. We studied the effects of urban and forested thermal environments on embryo development and hatchling phenotypes in two non-native lizards (Anolis sagrei and A. cristatellus) in metropolitan Miami, Florida. To determine if embryos from urban and forested sites are adapted to their respective thermal environments, we incubated eggs from each site using temperatures that simulate likely nest conditions in both urban and forested environments. For both species, urban thermal environments accelerated embryonic development, but had no impact on egg survival or any of the phenotypic traits that were measured (e.g., body size, running performance, and locomotor behavior). Our results provide no evidence that embryos from urban and forested sites are adapted to their respective thermal environments. Instead, the lack of any major effects suggest that embryos of both species are physiologically robust with respect to novel environments, which could have facilitated their success in establishing in nonnative ranges and in human-modified landscapes.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.02.021,65,NA,119-124,NA,Anolis; Developmental plasticity; Invasive species; Lizard; Urban adaptation
article,Effect of stride frequency on thermoregulatory responses during endurance running in distance runners,"Amano, Tatsuro and Ishitobi, Masaki and Ogura, Yukio and Inoue, Yoshimitsu and Koga, Shunsaku and Nishiyasu, Takeshi and Kondo, Narihiko",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Changing stride frequency may influence oxygen uptake and heart rate during running as a function of running economy and central command. This study investigated the influence of stride frequency manipulation on thermoregulatory responses during endurance running. Seven healthy endurance runners ran on a treadmill at a velocity of 15 km/h for 60 min in a controlled environmental chamber (ambient temperature 27 degrees C and relative humidity 50\%), and stride frequency was manipulated. Stride frequency was intermittently manipulated by increasing and decreasing frequency by 10\% from the pre-determined preferred frequency. These periods of increase or decrease were separated by free frequency running in the order of free stride frequency, stride frequency manipulation (increase or decrease), free stride frequency, and stride frequency manipulation (increase or decrease) for 15 min each. The increased and decreased stride frequencies were 110\% and 91\% of the free running frequency, respectively (196 +/- 6, 162 +/- 5, and 178 +/- 5 steps/min, respectively, P < 0.01). Compared to the control, stride frequency manipulation did not affect rectal temperature, heart rate, or the rate of perceived exhaustion during running. Whole-body sweat loss increased significantly when stride frequency was manipulated (1.48 +/- 0.11 and 1.57 +/- 0.11 kg for control and manipulated stride frequencies, respectively, P < 0.05), but stride frequency had a small effect on sweat loss overall (Cohen's d=0.31). A higher mean skin temperature was also observed under mixed frequency conditions compared to that in the control (P < 0.05). While the precise mechanisms underlying these changes remain unknown (e.g. running economy or central command), our results suggest that manipulation of stride frequency does not have a large effect on sweat loss or other physiological variables, but does increase mean skin temperature during endurance running.

It was hypothesised there would be no difference in rectal (Tre) and skin (Tsk) temperature, infra-red thermal imagery of the chest/back, thermal comfort (TC) and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) between M/E, W and CON, but participants would feel cooler in M/E versus W or CON. Methods: Six volunteers (mean {[}SD] 22 {[}4] years, 72.4 {[}7.4] kg and 173.6 {[}3.7] cm) completed (separate days) three, 60-min tests in 30 degrees C, 70\%rh, in a balanced order. After 15-min of seated rest participants donned a dry (CON) or 80 mL soaked (M/E, W) long sleeve shirt appropriate to their intervention. They then undertook 30-min of low intensity stepping at a rate of 12 steps/min on a 22.5 cm box, followed by 15-min of seated rest. Measurements included heart rate (HR), Tre, Tsk (chest/back/forearm), thermal imaging (back/chest), thermal sensation (TS), TC and RPE. Data were reported every fifth minute as they changed from baseline and the area under the curves were compared by condition using one-way repeated measures ANOVA, with an alpha level of 0.05. Results: Tre differed by condition, with the largest heat storage response observed in M/E (p < 0.05). Skin temperature at the chest/back/forearm, and thermal imaging of the chest all differed by condition, with the greatest rate of heat loss observed in W and M/E respectively (p < 0.01). Thermal sensation differed by condition, with the coolest sensations observed in M/E (p < 0.001). No other differences were observed. Conclusions: Both M/E and W enhanced evaporative cooling compared CON, but M/E causes cooler sensations and a heat storage response, both of which are likely mediated by menthol.

Learning about their thermal ecology is essential to infer sensitivity to environmental changes, particularly climate warming. We report on the activity temperature and thermoregulatory behavior of three high-elevation species of harlequin frogs, Atelopus nahumae, Atelopus laetissimus and Atelopus carrikeri. The first two mentioned live in streams in Andean rain forests, whereas A. carrikeri inhabits paramo streams in the SNSM. We studied the thermal ecology of these species in tree localities differing in altitude, and focused on activity body, operative, substrate and air temperature. A main trend was lower body temperature as elevation increased, so that differences among species were largely explained by differences in substrate temperature. However, this temperature variation was much lower in forest species than paramo species. The Atelopus species included in this work proved to be thermoconformers, a trend that not extended to all congenerics at high elevation. This diversity in thermal ecology poses important questions when discussing the impact of climate warming for high-elevation harlequin frogs. For example, forest species show narrow thermal ranges and, if highly specialized, may be more susceptible to temperature change. Paramo species such as A. carrikeri, in contrast, may be more resilient to temperature change. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Food restriction attenuates oxidative stress in brown adipose tissue of striped hamsters acclimated to a warm temperature,"Zhang, Ji-Ying and Zhao, Xiao-Ya and Wang, Gui-Ying and Wang, Chun-Ming and Zhao, Zhi-Jun",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"It has been suggested that the up-regulation of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) decreases reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, in which case there should be a negative relationship between UCPs expression and ROS levels. In this study, the effects of temperature and food restriction on ROS levels and metabolic rate, UCP1 mRNA expression and antioxidant levels were examined in the brown adipose tissue (BAT) of the striped hamsters (Cricetulus barabensis). The metabolic rate and food intake of hamsters which had been restricted to 80\% of ad libitum food intake, and acclimated to a warm temperature (30 degrees C), decreased significantly compared to a control group. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels were 42.9\% lower in food restricted hamsters than in the control. Malonadialdehyde (MDA) levels of hamsters acclimated to 30 degrees C that were fed ad libitum were significantly higher than those of the control group, but 60.1\% lower than hamsters that had been acclimated to the same temperature but subject to food restriction. There were significantly positive correlations between H2O2 and, MDA levels, catalase activity, and total antioxidant capacity. Cytochrome c oxidase activity and UCP1 mRNA expression significantly decreased in food restricted hamsters compared to the control. These results suggest that warmer temperatures increase oxidative stress in BAT by causing the down-regulation of UCP1 expression and decreased antioxidant activity, but food restriction may attenuate the effects.

In this paper, a review is initially presented of the more important general models developed for heat transfer description of perfused tissues. Comparisons are then made between Pennes' simplified Weinbaum and Jiji ``WJ{''} and the more recent porous media ``PM{''} bioheat models. For this purpose, a-mathematical model is developed for the heat transfer in a cylindrical medium containing parallel counter-current pairs of small vessels with characteristics as much as possible similar to those of living tissues. The validity of the models is examined and confirmed using the Pennes in vivo experiments and one-dimensional analytical solutions. For consideration of interstitial hyperthermia treatment the smaller cylindrical zone with typical heat generation, is assumed in the center of the main cylinder. The numerical simulation results revealed that, despite difference in temperature distributions calculated by these three models at normal condition, the heat affected zone at hyperthermic condition predicted by all three models are similar.

article,A model to predict the thermal reaction norm for the embryo growth rate from field data,"Girondot, Marc and Kaska, Yakup",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The incubation of eggs is strongly influenced by temperature as observed in all species studied to date. For example, incubation duration, sexual phenotype, growth, and performances in many vertebrate hatchlings are affected by incubation temperature. Yet it is very difficult to predict temperature effect based on the temperature within a field nest, as temperature varies throughout incubation. Previous works used egg incubation at constant temperatures in the laboratory to evaluate the dependency of growt Prod. Type: FTPh rate on temperature. However, generating such data is time consuming and not always feasible due to logistical and legislative constraints. This paper therefore presents a methodology to extract the thermal reaction norm for the embryo growth rate directly from a time series of incubation temperatures recorded within natural nests. This methodology was successfully applied to the nests of the marine turtle Caretta caretta incubated on Dalyan Beach in Turkey, although it can also be used for any egg-laying species, with some of its limitations being discussed in the paper. Knowledge about embryo growth patterns is also important when determining the thermosensitive period for species with temperature-dependent sex determination. Indeed, in this case, sexual phenotype is sensitive to temperature only during this window of embryonic development. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Capacity for protein synthesis following heat stimulus of <i>Drosophila</i> associates with heat tolerance but does not underlie the latitudinal tolerance cline,"Cockerell, Fiona E. and Sgro, Carla M. and McKechnie, Stephen W.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Across populations of Drosophila melanogaster along the Australian eastern coastline latitudinal dines occur in both heat-knockdown tolerance and hardened heat-knockdown tolerance - low latitude tropical populations being more tolerant. A latitudinal dine also occurs for rates of total protein synthesis following a mild heat stress, with tropical populations having higher rates. Since the control of protein synthesis following heat stress is an important component of the cellular heat-shock response, we hypothesised that the higher rates of synthesis that follow a heat stimulus lead to higher knockdown tolerance and underpins the dine. However, levels of heat-stimulated total protein synthesis have been negatively related to heat-hardening capacity, a somewhat conflicting result. Here we examine the relationship between these physiological and adaptive traits in a set of 40 family lines derived from a hybrid laboratory population established by crossing populations from either end of the latitudinal transect. Among these lines high levels of heat-stimulated total protein synthesis were associated with both low basal and low heat-hardened adult knockdown time, confirming the importance of a negative relationship between protein synthesis and thermal tolerance. This result, when considered along with the directions of the latitudinal dines in protein synthesis and tolerance, suggests that variation in rates of heat-stimulated total protein synthesis is not a factor contributing to the latitudinal dine in heat tolerance. Given the robustness of this negative relationship we discuss possible explanations and future experiments to elucidate how the cellular heat stress response might facilitate increased knockdown tolerance.

article,Hypoxia and temperature: Does hypoxia affect caiman embryo differentiation rate or rate of growth only?,"Iungman, J. L. and Pina, C. I.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In crocodilians, the rate of embryonic development and consequently many posthatch attributes are affected by temperature. Since temperature exhibits strong influences on fitness (embryo survivorship and phenotype) by shaping development, we manipulated oxygen concentration in order to uncouple the effects of developmental rate from the direct effects of temperature. Here we consider whether oxygen constrains either differentiation rate (progression from one stage to the next) or embryonic growth (size). Thus, we incubated Caiman latirostris eggs at various oxygen concentrations, and at two temperatures (31 degrees C, 100\% female-producing temperature, and 33 degrees C, 100\% male-producing temperature). We monitored the developmental stages of these embryos within the thermosensitive period (stages 20-24), and assessed several physiological and morphological hatchling traits. While embryonic size was strongly influenced by oxygen, differentiation rate did not seem to be affected. Very low oxygen concentrations and high temperatures inhibited embryo survival. In addition, oxygen availability affected incubation period and hatchling size, whereas temperature did not cause a significant variation in hatchling size. By investing energy in differentiation hypoxic embryos decreased their size. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Effects of simulated natural air movement on thermoregulatory response during head-down bed rest,"Yang, Zhenzhong and Fei, Jinxue and Song, De and Zhao, Yali and Yu, Juan and Yu, Xuejun",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Spaceflight and its bed rest analog impair thermoregulatory responses, including elevated core temperature observed at rest and during exercise. Natural air flow has been found to increase cold sensation significantly compared to artificial constant air flow (CAF). The present study tested the hypothesis that simulated natural air flow (SNAF) ventilation would ameliorate impaired thermoregulatory function to a greater extent than CAF under simulated microgravity conditions. Seven healthy males underwent 30 days of -6 degrees head-down bed rest (HDBR). During pre-HDBR and the day 29 of HDBR (HDBR 29), the subjects were exposed to three air flow patterns at 23 degrees C while in a supine posture: a still air flow control (CON), CAF, and SNAF. The mean air velocity of the latter two patterns was 0.2 m/s. Subjective perception of the thermal environment was recorded by thermal sensation vote (TSV), and rectal temperature (T-re), skin temperature (T-sk), and cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC) were also measured during the sessions. T-re was significantly elevated after 29 days of HDBR and decreased to a greater extent in SNAF than in CAF on HDBR 29. However, there was no significant difference between T-re in SNAF on HDBR 29 and that in CON on pre-HDBR. Mean T-sk, CVC, and TSV in SNAF were also significantly lower than those in CAF on HDBR 29. Moreover, TSV was close to `neutral' under SNAF on HDBR 29. These data indicate that simulated natural air movement might be more effective than constant air movement at preserving core temperature at a thermoneutral ambient temperature during HDBR.

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that TMT would block entry into torpor in the calorically restricted C57B1/6 mouse. We first demonstrated that TMT induced fear in the mouse. Exposure to TMT induced an acute freeze response (67.2 +/- 6.7\% of time), as compared to 6.7 +/- 1.7\% when exposed to water. Further, exposure to TMT for 30 min led to elevated circulating corticosterone levels, 377 +/- 33 ng/ml, as compared to 29 +/- 4 ng/ml when exposed to water. When mice were exposed to TMT during the dark or light phase, body temperature (Tb) dropped by 1.7 +/- 0.9 degrees C and 0.7 +/- 1.1 degrees C, respectively, over the first 110 min after exposure. To determine whether TMT influences daily torpor, mice were calorically restricted and exposed to either water or TMT. Mice were exposed 30 min before the start of torpor, determined by the bout of the previous day. Exposure to TMT significantly (p < 0.01) blunted the fall in the minimum Tb from 28.8 +/- 0.3 degrees C (water) to 30.1 +/- 0.6 degrees C (TMT) and significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the amount of time Tb was under 32 degrees C, from 431 +/- 48 min (water) to 292 +/- 78 min (TMT). These results establish that mice perceived the scent of TMT as a physiologically stressful stimulus and that Tb response is modestly blunted in the presence of that stressor.

The effect of power parameters (energy flux density P-0, tissue attenuation coefficient h) and equation parameters (relaxation time tau(q) and fractional order beta) on the prediction of temperature simulated by TFHE were studied. Furthermore, comparative studies on TFHE, Pennes and CV are performed and evaluated. In the heating process, because of the existence of relaxation time tau(q), the temperature response of TFHE and CV are later than Pennes, leading to the lower temperature prediction of TFHE and CV than that of Pennes.

In this context, the aim of this study was to determine if lambs' rectal and body surface temperatures were related to the ewes and lambs behaviours at birth and during a separation-reunion test performed 24-36 h later. Rectal and body surface temperatures of lambs were recorded using a digital thermometer and an infrared thermal camera, respectively, and were related to several ewe and lamb behaviours. Rectal temperature was inversely related to the duration of the first suckling at birth. As for lambs' weight, body surface temperatures recorded at birth were inversely related to its latency to suckle for the first time. Body surface temperatures recorded during a separation-reunion test were positively related to the ewe-lamb distance during it. Body surface temperature recorded at birth was negatively related to behaviours recorded during the separation-reunion test, such as the number of lamb vocalizations, the ewe-lamb distance and the latency to suckle after the ewe-lamb separation. Body surface temperatures were greater after the separation-reunion test than at birth. We concluded that lambs' body surface temperatures seem to be indicators of the lambs' vitality at birth and of the strength of the ewe-lamb bond measured one day after birth.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102699,93,NA,NA,102699,Sheep; Thermoregulation; Maternal behaviour; Lamb behaviour; Filial attachment

Osmoregulatory capacity parameters (plasma osmolality, sodium, chloride, cortisol, and branchial and renal Na+ ,K+ -ATPase activities) were also assessed. Salinity and temperature affected all of the parameters tested. Our results indicate that environmental temperature modulates capacity in sea bream, independent of environmental salinity, and set points of plasma osmolality and ion concentrations depend on both ambient salinity and temperature. Acclimation to extreme salinity resulted in stress, indicated by elevated basal plasma cortisol levels. Response to salinity was affected by ambient temperature. A comparison between branchial and renal Na+,K (+)-ATPase activities appears instrumental in explaining salinity and temperature responses. Sea bream regulate branchial enzyme copy numbers (V-max) in hyperosmotic media (SW and HSW) to deal with ambient temperature effects on activity; combinations of high temperatures and salinity may exceed the adaptive capacity of sea bream. Salinity compromises the branchial enzyme capacity (compared to basal activity at a set salinity) when temperature is elevated and the scope for temperature adaptation becomes smaller at increasing salinity.

article,Numerical study of the effect of vascular bed on heat transfer during high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation of the liver tumor,"Mohammadpour, M. and Firoozabadi, B.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In this study, the influence of vascular bed comprising terminal arterial branches on heat transfer in a liver tumor exposed to high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is studied numerically. Also, the effect of vascular density on temperature distribution is investigated. A coupled set of acoustics, thermal, and fluid models is used to calculate the temperature distribution in the liver. The numerical model is established based on the Westervelt and bioheat equations along with the Navier-Stokes equations. Moreover, the acoustic streaming effect is included with Newtonian and non-Newtonian flow assumptions. It is found that in a vascular bed comprising terminal arterial branches, the effect of acoustic streaming is negligible because of the small diameter of these vessels, and the non-Newtonian behavior of blood flow reduces the peak streaming velocity. It is also shown that the vascular density (amount of tissue vascular content) has a considerable cooling effect on peak temperature and hence lesion volume in the liver and, by increasing the vascular density, the treatment duration is prolonged. Results show that when the tumor is embedded in the vascular bed, the cancer cells near the vessels walls remain viable. Some approaches are proposed and compared to improve the efficacy of HIFU in a tumor located in the vascular bed. These approaches include increasing the source pressure or transducer gain. It is concluded that for the assumed configuration of the vascular bed, adjusting the transducer gain is preferred to increase the lesion size and to prevent the problems related to skin burns simultaneously.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102431,86,NA,NA,102431,HIFU; Vascular bed; Acoustics-thermal-fluid; Heat transfer; Liver tumor; Vascular density

In 2017, we returned to the islets and estimated the effectiveness (E), accuracy and precision of thermoregulation measuring operative, preferred (T-pref) and body temperatures. We hypothesized that the three habitats would differ in thermal quality and investigated the extent to which lizards from Naxos demonstrate plasticity when introduced to the novel, islet habitats. Thermal parameters did not differ between Galiatsos and Naxos and this was reflected in the similar E and T-pref. However, lizards from Kampana deviated in all focal traits from Naxos, resulting in higher E and a preference for higher T-pref. In sum, Naxos lizards shifted their thermoregulatory profile due to the idiosyncratic features of their new islet habitat. Our results advocate a high plasticity in lizard thermoregulation and suggest that there is room for effective responses to environmental changes, at least for Podarcis lizards in insular habitats.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.032,84,NA,368-374,NA,Thermal biology; Plasticity; Rapid adaptation; Islands; Ectotherms
article,Air-conditioning characteristics in nasal cavity models exhibiting nasal cycle states,"Byun, Seongsu and Chung, Seung-Kyu and Na, Yang",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The air-conditioning characteristics in nasal cavity models obtained from two subjects exhibiting different degrees of the nasal cycle states in terms of the airflow partition were investigated using computational fluid dynamics. A constant inspiratory flow rate of approximately 250 mL/s was considered, and the air temperature and relative humidity at the inlet were assumed to be 25 degrees C and 35\%, respectively. The air-conditioning capacities of the congested and decongested sides were assessed by the amounts of epithelial heat and water vapor transferred to the inhaled air through the airway from the nostrils to the end of the septum. The results revealed that the air temperature and relative humidity near the end of the septum, respectively, reached approximately 31.4-32.5 degrees C and 81.4-88.0\% in the decongested sides and 34.0-35.9 degrees C and 95.3-100\% in the congested sides. The differences seen in the air temperatures and relative humidity between the congested and decongested sides were found to be larger in the cavity model that showed a larger degree of reciprocal change in the airflow rate. From a fluid mechanics perspective, while the congested side is in a rest period during the nasal cycle such that a lower amount of airflow is transported through it, this side, in effect, works to provide assistive air-conditioning capacity to the nasal cavity and aids when insufficiently conditioned airflow passes through the decongested side so that the inhaled air merging after the septum can approach the alveolar condition favorably through the nasopharynx.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.05.004,83,NA,60-68,NA,Nasal cycle; Temperature; Relative humidity; Computational fluid dynamics; Water vapor transfer
article,Relationship between metabolic rate and blood perfusion under Fanger thermal comfort conditions,"Marn, Jure and Chung, Mo and Iljaz, Jurij",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The one-dimensional steady Pennes (bioheat) equation was applied to analyze heat conduction inside a combined layer of human muscle and fat, under Fanger thermal comfort conditions. The bioheat equation was solved subject to two boundary conditions at the skin surface: a prescribed skin temperature satisfying the Fanger comfort criterion, and a prescribed heat flux obtained from the overall energy balance for the system. In addition to a fixed body core temperature, an adiabatic condition was imposed as an auxiliary condition at the core of the body, and a pair of equations were derived, relating the blood perfusion and the volumetric heat generation rate for a given activity level and environmental conditions. By solving the two equations, we determined the functional dependence of blood perfusion and metabolic heat generation on the human activity level. For convenience, we presented simple explicit expressions for the key relations, with the aid of asymptotic analyses. Additional results include the temperature distribution inside the muscle layer, and the effects of muscle and fat layer thickness on the heat transfer processes.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.01.002,80,NA,94-105,NA,Fanger thermal comfort; Pennes bioheat equation; Blood perfusion; Temperature distribution; Asymptotic solution

M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Mobile phones have become an indispensable utility to modern society, with international use increasing dramatically each year. The GSM signal operates at 900 MHz, 1800 MHz and 2250 MHz, may potentially cause harm to human tissue. Yet there is no in silico model to aid design these devices to protect from causing potential thermal effect. Here we present a model of sources of heating in a mobile phone device with experimental verification during the phone call. We have developed this mobile phone thermal model using first principles on COMSOL (R) Multiphysics modelling platform to simulate heating effect in human auricle region due to mobile phone use. In particular, our model considered both radiative and non-radiative heating from components such as the lithium ion battery, CPU circuitry and the antenna. The model showed the distribution and effect of the heating effect due to mobile phone use and considered impact of battery discharge rate, battery capacity, battery cathode material, biological tissue distance, antenna radio-wave frequency and intensity. Furthermore, the lithium ion battery heating was validated during experiments using temperature sensors with an excellent agreement between simulated and experimental data (<1\% variation). Mobile phone heating during a typical call has also been simulated and compared with experimental infrared thermographic imaging. Importantly, we found that 1800 MHz frequency of data transmission showed the highest temperature increase in the fat/water phantom used in this simulation. We also successfully compared heating distribution in human auricle region during mobile phone use with clinical thermographic images with reasonable qualitative and quantitative agreements. In summary, our model provides a foundation to conceive thermal and other physical effects caused by mobile phone use and allow for the understanding of potential negative health effects thus supporting and promoting personalized and preventive medicine using thermography.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.11.008,79,NA,56-68,NA,Biological heat transfer; Thermal model; Mobile phone; Health impact of mobile phone; IR thermography; Personalized and preventive medicine

While prepartum energy supplementation is a nutritional strategy to improve lamb postnatal performance in thermoneutral environments, this has not been studied under heat stress. This study aimed to evaluate effects of maternal energy supplementation during the last third of pregnancy on post-weaning feedlot performance and thermoregulation capacity of heat-stressed male lambs born from multiple births. Twenty Dorper x Pelibuey entire male lambs with initial body weight of 18.2 +/- 0.4 kg, aged 2.7 mo (weaned) and born in multiple pregnancies were used in a 32 d feeding study. Treatments were based in the prenatal origin of the lambs: 1) ewes fed 100 (n = 10, Control) and 2) 125\% (n = 10, Supplemented) of metabolizable energy requirements from day 100 of gestation to lambing. Lambs were housed outdoor in individual pens under summer environment conditions in an arid region (temperature = 36 +/- 4.4 degrees C and temperature-humidity index = 81 +/- 3.9 units). Overall feedlot performance was not affected by prepartum maternal feeding, although lower (P = 0.04) growth rate and feed efficiency occurred during the last 8 d of the study in lambs born from supplemented ewes. Rectal temperature, respiratory rate and hair coat temperature during daytime were unaffected by prepartum supplementation. Serum concentrations of glucose, cholesterol, urea, total protein and thyroid hormones were similar between lambs born from control and supplemented ewes.

article,Zinc nanoparticles potentiates thermal tolerance and cellular stress protection of <i>Pangasius hypophthalmus</i> reared under multiple stressors,"Kumar, Neeraj and Krishnani, K. K. and Kumar, Paritosh and Singh, Narendra Pratap",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"A preliminary study was conducted to delineate the ameliorating effect of dietary zinc nanoparticles (Zn-NPs) against thermal stress in Pangasius hypophthalmus reared under concurrent exposure to lead (Pb) and elevated temperature (34 degrees C). Three diets were formulated such as control (no Zn-NPs), Zn-NPs 10 and 20 mg/kg diet. Two hundred and thirty four fish were randomly distributed in to six treatments groups in triplicates; such as control group (no Zn-NPs in diet and unexposed to Pb and temperature, Ctr/Ctr), control diet with concurrent exposure to Pb and temperature (Pb-T/Ctr), Zn-NPs 10 and 20 mg/kg without stressors (Zn-NPs 10 mg/kg, Zn-NPs 20 mg/kg), Zn-NPs 10 and 20 mg/kg diet with concurrent exposure to Pb and temperature (Pb-T/Zn-NPs 10 mg/kg, Pb-T/Zn-NPs 20 mg/kg). The Pb in treated water was maintained at the level of 1/21th of LC50 (4 ppm) at 34 degrees C temperature in stressors groups. Post 60 days feeding trial, critical thermal minimum (CTmin), lethal thermal minimum (LTmin), and critical thermal maximum (CTmax), lethal thermal maximum (LTmax) and biochemical attributes on P. hypophthalmus were evaluated. The results indicated that, dietary supplementation of Zn-NPs increased the CTmin, LTmin and CTmax, LTmax in P. hypophthalmus.

article,Participation of preoptic area TRPV4 ion channel in regulation of body temperature,"Yadav, Rajesh and Jaryal, Ashok Kumar and Mallick, Hruda Nanda",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) ion channel is a non-selective cation channel and its role in cutaneous thermosensation is emerging. It is expressed in many areas of the brain including the preoptic area (POA)/anterior hypothalamus which is the key neural site for thermoregulation. The present study was conducted to find out the role of TRPV4 ion channel in the POA in thermoregulation. Rats preimplanted with guide cannulae with indwelling styli 2.0 mm above the POA received TRPV4 agonist/antagonist/isotonic saline injections bilaterally in the POA using an injector cannula in three separate groups of six rats each. Body temperature (Tb) was recorded telemetrically by preimplanted radio transmitter in the peritoneal cavity. The injection of TRPV4 agonist (GSK1016790A) in the POA decreased Tb while its antagonist (R191734) increased Tb. Immunohistochemical localization showed presence of TRPV4 ion channel in the POA. The results of the present study suggest that TRPV4 ion channels in the POA may play an important role in thermoregulation.,2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.04.001,66,NA,81-86,NA,Preoptic area; TRPV4 ion channel; GSK1016790A; RN 1734; Body temperature
article,The cooling time of fertile chicken eggs at different stages of incubation,"Mortola, Jacopo P. and Gaonac'h-Lovejoy, Vanda",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"We asked whether or not the thermal characteristics of fertile avian eggs changed throughout incubation. The cooling and warming times, expressed by the time constants tau of the egg temperature response to a rapid change in ambient temperature, were measured in fertile chicken eggs at early (E7), intermediate (E11) and late (E20) stages of embryonic development. Same measurements were conducted on eggs emptied of their content and refilled with water by various amounts. The results indicated that (1) the tau of a freshly laid egg was similar to 50 min; (2) tau decreased linearly with the drop in egg water volume; (3) the dry eggshell had almost no thermal resistance but its wet inner membrane contributed about one-third to the stability of egg temperature; (4) the egg constituents (yolk, albumen and embryonic tissues) and the chorioallantoic circulation had no measurable effect on tau; (5) the presence of an air pocket equivalent in volume to the air cell of fertile eggs reduced tau by about 3 min (E7), 5 min (E11) and 11 min (E20). Hence, in response to warming the egg tau at E20 was slightly shorter than at E7. In response to cooling, the egg tau at E20 was similar to, or longer than, E7 because embryonic thermogenesis (evaluated by measurements of oxygen consumption during cold) offset the reduction in tau introduced by the air cell. In conclusion, until the onset of thermogenesis the thermal behavior of a fertile egg is closely approximated by that of a water-filled egg with an air volume equivalent to the air cell. It is possible to estimate the cooling tau of avian eggs of different species from their weight and incubation time. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Thermal exposure of adult Chinook salmon in the Willamette River basin,"Keefer, Matthew L. and Clabough, Tami S. and Jepson, Michael A. and Naughton, George P. and Blubaugh, Timothy J. and Joosten, Daniel C. and Caudill, Christopher C.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Radiotelemetry and archival temperature loggers were used to reconstruct the thermal experience of adult spring Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the highly regulated Willamette River system in Oregon. The study population is threatened and recovery efforts have been hampered by episodically high prespawn mortality that is likely temperature mediated. Over three years, 310 salmon were released with thermal loggers and 68 were recovered in spawning tributaries, primarily at hatchery trapping facilities downstream from high-head dams. More than 190,000 internal body temperature records were collected (mean similar to 2800 per fish) and associated with 14 main stem and tributary reaches. Most salmon experienced a wide temperature range (minima similar to 8-10 degrees C; maxima similar to 13-22 degrees C) and 65\% encountered potentially stressful conditions (>= 18 degrees C). The warmest salmon temperatures were in lower Willamette River reaches, where some fish exhibited short-duration behavioral thermoregulation. Cumulative temperature exposure, measured by degree days (DD) above 0 degrees C, varied more than seven-fold among individuals (range=208-1498 DDs) and more than two-fold among sub-basin populations, on average. Overall, similar to 72\% of DDs accrued in tributaries and similar to 28\% were in the Willamette River main stem. DD differences among individuals and populations were related to migration distance, migration duration, and salmon trapping protocols (i.e., extended pre-collection holding in tributaries versus hatchery collection shortly after tributary entry). The combined data provide spatially- and temporally-referenced information on both short-duration stressful temperature exposure and the biologically important total exposure. Thermal exposure in this population complex proximately influences adult salmon physiology, maturation, and disease processes and ultimately affects prespawn mortality and fitness. The results should help managers develop more effective salmon recovery plans in basins with marginal thermal conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Simultaneous estimation of controllable parameters in a living tissue during thermal therapy,"Jalali, Arash and Ayani, Mohammad-Bagher and Baghban, Mojtaba",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"During hyperthermia, controlling the temperature distribution along the tissue can cause remedial advantages. This can be obtained by proper manipulation of effective parameters in hyperthermia such as the external heat source and the heat transfer coefficient at the skin surface. In this study, these parameters are estimated simultaneously for an arbitrary temperature distribution in a skin tissue. The direct problem is solved by the fully implicit finite volume method to obtain the temperature data. This data is used as additional information to estimate the external heat source and the heat transfer coefficient at the skin surface simultaneously. Both of these parameters are considered as functions of time, and since no information exists about their functional form, the problem is classified as the function estimation approach. Conjugate gradient method is applied as an inverse method. Two test cases are considered and the effect of measurement errors is evaluated. The comparison of estimated results with measurements confirms the accuracy of this method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Scott and Schwanz, Lisa E.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Incubation temperature is one of the most studied factors driving phenotypic plasticity in oviparous reptiles. We examined how incubation temperature influenced hatchling morphology, thermal preference and temperature-dependent running speed in the small Australian agamid lizard Amphibolurus muricatus. Hatchlings incubated at 32 degrees C grew more slowly than those incubated at 25 and 28 degrees C during their first month after hatching, and tended to be smaller at one month. These differences were no longer significant by three months of age due to selective mortality of the smallest hatchlings. The cooler incubation treatments (25 degrees C and 28 degrees C) produced lizards that had deeper and wider heads. Hatchlings from 28 degrees C had cooler and more stable temperature preferences, and also had lower body temperatures during a 2-h thermoregulatory behaviour trial. Locomotor performance was enhanced at higher body temperatures, but incubation temperature had no measurable effect either independently or in interaction with body temperature. Our study demonstrates that incubation temperature has direct effects on morphology and thermoregulatory behaviour that appears to be independent of any size-dependent effects. We postulate a mechanistic link between these two effects. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In Chile all cases are attributable to Loxosceles laeta. It has been suggested that the spitting spider Scytodes globula may be a predator of L laeta and control its population, which is only possible if they share the microhabitat. This study compared the thermal preferences and tolerances of the two species. Later, spiders acclimated to 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C were exposed to decreasing and increasing temperatures to determine the lower and upper critical temperatures. The preferred temperatures were lower during the morning, but there were no differences between the species. The thermal niche breadths were similar for the species, with a large overlap. Both species showed tolerance to extreme temperatures, but L laeta showed greater tolerance to low temperatures. Both species showed acclimation of the lower critical temperatures to changes in acclimation temperatures. The similarity of preferred and tolerated temperatures was partly an expected fact, since the species share the same macrohabitat; these spider species are very common in domestic environments of central Chile. However, the results imply that their microhabitat choices are also very similar, indicating a high probability of meeting and predation, which could have important consequences in loxoscelism epidemiology.

Continental habitats were of lower thermal quality, experiencing more intense fluctuations and had higher values of operative temperatures. Nevertheless mainland lizards selected for higher body temperatures in the lab and showed more effective thermoregulation during summer than their island peers. Lizards achieved similar body temperatures in the field in both types of habitat, underlining the importance of predation as a potential factor to mainland lizards that failed to reach their higher thermal preferences.

article,Ecophysiology of a lacertid community in the high Moroccan mountains suggests conservation guidelines,"S'khifa, Abderrahim and Koziel, Giannina and Vences, Miguel and Carretero, Miguel A. and Slimani, Tahar",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Lizard species may differ in their ecophysiology due to adaptation, plasticity and/or phylogeny. In restrictive environments, ecophysiological differences of species living in sympatry are expected to reveal long-term evolutionary responses to the abiotic environment while competitive interactions should be limited. These influences can be disentangled by combining field monitoring with experimental tests. Here, three lacertid lizard species, Atlantolacerta andreanskyi, Scelarcis perspicillata and Podarcis vaucheri sharing high mountain habitats in Oukaimeden (High Atlas, Morocco), were studied. In the field, spatiotemporal variation of the thermal and hydric environment used by the lizards was monitored using data-loggers. In the lab, thermal and hydric ecophysiology was estimated through assessments of preferred temperatures (Tp) and water loss (WL) rates. Species differed in microhabitat use and, hence, in their exposure to variations in temperature and humidity. However, they only differed in their WL (A. andreanskyi > S. perspicillata > P. vaucheri) while their Tp were similar. Such partial differences of species in in the fundamental niche, likely derived from their long-term independent phylogenetic trajectories, can be used to predict their responses to climate and habitat shifts in this and other parts of their respective ranges. Results also confirm previous suggestions that, together with thermal physiology, hydric physiology plays a prominent role in the organisation of lizard communities in the temperate region.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102743,94,NA,NA,102743,Lacertidae; Preferred temperatures; Water loss; Extreme environment; High atlas; Morocco
article,Sweat rate and sweat composition during heat acclimation,"Klous, Lisa and De Ruiter, Cornelis and Alkemade, Puck and Daanen, Hein and Gerrett, Nicola",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The purpose of this study was to determine local sweat rate (LSR) and sweat composition during heat acclimation (HA). For ten consecutive days of HA, eight participants cycled in 33 degrees C and 65\% relative humidity at an intensity such that a rectal temperature of 38.5 degrees C was reached within -40 min, followed by a 60-min clamp of this rectal temperature (i.e., controlled hyperthermia). Four participants extended HA by a 28-day decay period and five consecutive days of heat re-acclimation (HRA) using controlled hyperthermia. Sweat from the upper arm and upper back was collected three times during each heat exposure session. LSR and sweat sodium, chloride, lactate, and potassium concentrations were determined. Relative to HA day 1, LSR was increased at the final day of HA (day 10) (arm: +58\%, P < 0.001; back: +36\%, P < 0.05). Concentrations of sodium, chloride, and lactate significantly (P < 0.05) decreased to -60\% at HA day 10 compared to day 1 on the arm and back. Potassium concentration did not significantly differ on HA day 10 compared to day 1 (arm: +11\%, P > 0.05; back: +8\%, P > 0.05). The induction patterns of the sudomotor adaptations were different. Whilst LSR increased from HA day 8 on the arm and from HA day 7 on the back, sodium and chloride conservation already occurred from HA day 3 on both skin sites. Lastly, the sweat lactate reduction occurred from HA day 6 on the arm and back. Initial evidence is provided that adaptations were partly conserved after decay (28 days) and that a 5-day HRA may be sufficient to restore HA adaptations. In conclusion, ten days of exercise-induced HA using controlled hyperthermia led to increases in LSR and concomitant reductions of sweat sodium, chloride, and lactate concentrations, whilst potassium concentrations remained relatively constant.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102697,93,NA,NA,102697,Controlled hyperthermia; Heat acclimation; Lactate; Sodium; Sweat composition; Sweat rate

article,Temperature preference of juvenile lumpfish (<i>Cyclopterus lumpus</i>) originating from the southern and northern parts of Norway,"Mortensen, Atle and Johansen, Richard B. and Hansen, Oyvind J. and Puvanendran, Velmurugu",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Fish are ectothermic animals and have body temperatures close to that of the water they inhabit. They can still control their body temperatures by selecting habitats with temperatures that maximize their growth, feed conversion and wellbeing. Lumpfish, Cyclopterus lumpus, is widely distributed in the North Atlantic Ocean and therefore exposed to variable water temperatures. Lumpfish is extensively used as cleanerfish in salmon farming in Norway and exposed to a wide temperature range along the north-south axis of the Norwegian coastline. But, if these temperature ranges correspond to the preference temperatures of lumpfish is not known. If lumpfish has adapted to regional temperatures along the Norwegian coast, differences in preference temperature for fish from different regions should be evident. In a selective breeding perspective, different selection lines for preference temperature would then be useful for further development of lumpfish as a cleanerfish. We subjected lumpfish juveniles weighing 154-426g originated from northern (Group North - GN) and southern (Group South - GS) Norway to a temperature preference test, using an electronic shuttle box system. The system allowed the fish to control the water temperature by moving between two chambers, and thereby choosing its preferred temperature in the range from 5 to 16 degrees C. We started the temperature at 7.8 +/- 1.37 degrees C for GN and 7.58 +/- 1.34 degrees C for GS, but all the fish except four (two each from GN and GS) chose lower temperatures (5.03-7.6 degrees C) in the first 18 h and stayed closer to that temperature during the next 30 h. Based on the results, GN and GS lumpfish preferred 6.92 +/- 1.8 and 6.2 +/- 1.2, respectively, and there was no significant difference between the groups. Neither was there any significant difference in growth rates (SGR) between the two groups. Based on our results, we suggest that lumpfish from any geographical origin along the Norwegian coast can be used anywhere in Norway. It follows that lumpfish from a single selection line could be used at any salmon farm in Norway independent of its location.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102562,89,NA,NA,102562,Temperature preference; Lumpfish; Growth

The purpose of the current study was to examine whether the altered body temperature in EAE-induced rats is due to either a deficit in thermoregulation or a controlled change in its set point. Subcutaneous injection of encephalitogenic emulsion into both pads of hind feet of the Lewis rats provoked EAE symptoms. Body temperature (Tb) of 6 rats was measured using biotelemetry system, and ambient temperature (Ta) preferred by 6 rats of another group was analyzed using thermal gradient system. Symptoms of EAE started 11 days postinjection and progressed quickly, culminating in a complete paralysis in rats placed in the gradient, which was associated with behavioural fever (accordingly, selected Ta raised to as much as 32.8 +/- 0.5 degrees C vs 27.2 +/- 0.6 degrees C in control rats). On the other hand, EAE rats, placed at a constant Ta of 24 degrees C, were able to generate fever (Tb of 37.8 +/- 0.1 degrees C) at the start of the illness and then paralysis compromised fever (most likely due to an impairment of thermogenesis), which, surprisingly, resulted in recovery. We conclude that EAE onset in rats is associated with fever and its behavioural supporting leads to aggravation of the autoimmune neumtoxicity.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102529,89,NA,NA,102529,Experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE); Multiple sclerosis; Preferred ambient temperature (Ta); Body temperature (Tb); Thermal gradient; Set point
article,Temperature-related heart rate in water and air and a comparison to other temperature-related measures of performance in the fiddler crab <i>Leptuca pugilator</i> (Bosc 1802),"Levinton, Jeffrey S. and Volkenborn, Nils and Gurr, Samuel and Correal, Kelly and Villacres, Sebastian and Seabra, Rui and Lima, Fernando P.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Performance in poikilotherms is known to be sensitive to temperature, often with a low-sloping increase with temperature to a peak, and a steep decline with increasing temperature past the peak. We complemented past measures of performance by measuring heartbeat rates of the fiddler crab Leptuca pugilator in water and in air as a function of a range of temperatures previously shown to affect other measures of performance. In water over a range of 20-50 degrees C, heartbeat increased steadily to a peak at 40 degrees C and then steeply declined to near zero at 50 degrees C. In air, heartbeat also increased, but to a peak at 35 degrees C and then with a gentler decline than was found in water. Part of this different response may be due to evaporative water loss, which reduced body temperature in air, and therefore thermal stress, relative to body temperature when crabs were immersed in water. Increased availability of oxygen from air, according to the oxygen and capacity-limited thermal tolerance hypothesis, likely increased aerobic scope past the thermal peak, relative to within water, where oxygen delivery at higher temperatures may have been curtailed. We compared the heart rate performance relations to two previous measures of performance - endurance on a treadmill and sprint speed, both done in air. The peak performance temperature increased in the order: treadmill endurance time, sprint speed, heart rate in air, and heart rate in water, which demonstrates that different performance measures give different perspectives on the relation of thermal tolerance and fitness to temperature. Endurance may therefore be the limiting upper thermal stress factor in male fiddler crabs, when on hot sand flats. Temperature preference, found to be for temperatures <30 degrees C in air, could be a bet-hedging evolutionary strategy to avoid aerobic scope affecting endurance.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102502,88,NA,NA,102502,Physiological adaptation; Thermal; Heart rate; Fiddler crab; Performance

The purpose of the present study was to examine and evaluate auditory canal temperature (T-auditory), measured with a newly-developed wearable and wireless device, as a practical index to estimate body core temperature variations during a 7-h sleep period. Comparisons with rectal temperature (T-re) at different depths were conducted. Nine young females slept in a climate chamber at an air temperature of 27 degrees C with 50\% relative humidity. Rectal temperatures at 6, 10 and 14 cm depths, as well as partially insulated T-auditory were simultaneously measured every 5 s during sleep. The results showed that T-auditory was, on average, 0.32 degrees C lower than T-re at 14 cm depth (P = 0.010), while significant relationships between T-auditory and T-re at 10 cm (r(2) = 0.634, P = 0.010), and at 14 cm depths were also found (r(2) = 0.826, P = 0.001). Rectal temperatures at 6 cm and 10 cm depths fell between those of T-auditory and T-re at 14 cm.

article,Effect of surface modification on the dynamic heat and mass transfer of wool fabrics,"Li, Wenbin and Zhao, Yuan and Wang, Xin",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Surface functionalization of fibers is widely used to grant performance or functions to textiles. Modified textile surface, with different morphology and wettability together with different thermal conductivity, has a profound effect on the wellbeing of wearer, because the thermal and moisture transfer of the surface-modified textiles in dynamic moving conditions is totally different to unmodified ones. To benefit the design of performance/functional textiles with enhanced wellbeing of wearer, it is important to understand the dynamic thermal and mass transfer of textiles before and after surface modification. Using wool as a sample fiber, this work reveals the effect of typical surface modification on the dynamic thermal and moisture transfer of wool fabrics. It has been found that the surface characters of wool fiber change after surface modification with etched and peeled off scales, enhanced water absorbing capacity and wettability. The surface temperature of modified wool fabrics was lower than pristine wool fabrics when attaching to a rotating hotplate with a temperature of 35 degrees C, resulting in a lower energy consumption of the hotplate and enhanced warmth retention rate. Modified wool fabrics took longer time to accomplish the dynamic moisture transfer process with a longer stage three in the transfer cycle. This work will provide insights on how the surface of fiber affects the dynamic thermal and moisture transfer of textiles, which will further benefit the development of functional/performance clothing with its comfort well maintained.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102416,85,NA,NA,102416,Surface; Fiber; Morphology; Wettability; Dynamic; Heat and mass transfer

We measured performance as well as physical and chemical quality of fresh and 21-day stored eggs. A total of 240 semi-heavy laying hens were distributed into six treatments and five replicates (n = 8 each). Treatments consisted of five groups of hens fed diets supplemented with 0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 mg OEO/kg. We measured the average of three productive cycles (1st: week 1-4, 2nd: week 5-8 and 3rd: week 9-12), and found that feed consumption increased in hens in the control group and those in the group treated with 200 mg OEO/kg; other zootechnical variables did not differ between treatments. When we analyzed each individual production cycle individually, we did not observe differences between treatments for the performance variables in the first or second cycles. However, in the third cycle, when the animals were exposed to a greater number of days to cold stress, we recorded improved conversion rate/dozen eggs, conversion rate/daily feed consumed and egg production at T50 (50 mg OEO/kg). Stored eggs from hens supplemented with 50 mg OEO/kg showed lower eggshell percentages and higher yolk pHs. The intensity of the yellow was higher in yolks of the control group and in those from hens supplemented with 200 mg OEO/kg. Lipid peroxidation was lower in fresh egg yolks from hens that received 200 mg OEO/kg and stored eggs of T150. The reduction of lipid peroxidation in egg yolk is beneficial to consumer health by reducing levels of free radicals consumed. Reduction of lipid peroxidation associated with 150 mg OEO/kg in laying hens in winter might be useful for maintaining egg quality and for prolonging shelf life; productive efficiency was improving even at 39.8 mg OEO/kg if we consider feed conversion (kg/kg).",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102409,85,NA,NA,102409,Herbal extract; Origanum vulgare; Shelf life; Egg quality; Thermal stress
article,A numerical-experimental study on thermal evaluation of orthodontic tooth movement during initial phase of treatment,"Bonab, M. Fakhimi and Mojra, A. and Shirazi, M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The most desired target of orthodontic treatment is tooth movement as a result of application of efficient force system. In this study, effect of tooth loading is studied on temperature profile around the tooth at early stages of treatment. The basis of temperature variation is increase of cell number and activities in periodontium as a result of compression and tension of this layer. Highest cellular activities occur in the beginning of loading procedure and aim to reduce mechanical stress in the periodontium which finally ends up with orthodontic tooth movement during couple of years. To find out the correlation between temperature variation and the applied force, in vivo experiments are conducted on ten rats and temperature is measured in specific time periods. It is observed that temperature is higher in direction of the net force about 0.3 degrees C. Next, numerical finite element analysis is carried out on the rat tooth model. Mechanical stress results show that regions with compressive stress have rather high temperature in the experiments. Mechanical stress on periodontium-bone interface is multiplied by a coefficient to simulate cellular activities on this boundary as a heat source and thermal analysis is carried out to obtain temperature profile. The thermo-mechanical coefficient is identified for each rat by imposing the experimental temperatures on numerical outputs. For assessment of a treatment efficiency and deduction of the applied force, temperatures could be measured experimentally and compared with the corresponding numerical analysis temperature result obtained by employing the thermo-mechanical coefficient found earlier for each rat.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.01.005,80,NA,45-55,NA,"Orthodontic treatment; Thermal analysis; Pennes bio-heat transfer equation, Hyperviscoelastic behavior; Finite element method"

Most recently, investigators have revisited this theoretical presentation to offer additional interpretation for both heterogeneity and spatial structure of temperature and how it may influence energetic costs (Sears and Angilletta, 2015). Interestingly, this foundational presentation by Huey and Slatkin, over 40 years ago, has never received formal computational analyses to address mathematically the postulates of this conceptual model. Here we use functions that closely mimic those that were described by Huey and Slatkin to provide both a theoretical and computational analysis for the cost and benefits of lizard thermoregulation. We demonstrate both the utility and inherent accuracy of their analyses using a model that was developed conceptually without the use of now readily available computational tools. But contrary to Huey and Slatkin's analyses, we provide a mathematical proof that perfect thermoregulation is never an optimal strategy and show by computational analysis that thermoregulatory strategy (k) may decrease, not increase, with increasing cost.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.09.015,78,NA,174-183,NA,Thermoregulation; Historical perspective; Energetics; Theoretical modeling
article,Computational study of photo-thermal ablation of large blood vessel embedded tumor using localized injection of gold nanoshells,"Paul, Abhijit and Paul, Anup",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Attaining a precise necrosis of tumor sparing normal tissue during carcinomas thermo-therapy via nominally invasive scheme like irradiation of laser is a recent challenge. In this study, a combined diffusion and convective energy equations were solved using COMSOL Multiphysics to predict the tissue thermal profile during laser assisted thermo-therapy with different tissue vascular networks. A comparative analysis between intratumoral and intravenous loading scheme of silica-gold nanoshells (AuNs) was also performed. AuNs cluster position and alignment was altered to achieve precise ablation of a large tumor with minimum damage to healthy tissue and improvement in necrosis in the vicinity of large blood vessels (LBV). A modified Beer-Lambert law and Arrhenius equation was applied to model laser heat propagation and to compute thermal damage respectively. Simulation results suggests the dominance of targeted nanostructure injection in cluster form over intravenous scheme in terms of precise control over spreading of necrotic zone due to selective laser dose delivery into the tumor. An effective tumor ablation, sparing normal tissue is best revealed for Type-A intratumoral scheme comparing Type-B and C as the reallocation of cluster position can help to achieve an irregular shaped necrotic zone. In addition a comparative analysis between dual-phase-lag (DPL) and classical Fourier approach within a tumor-blood in homogeneous inner structure was made to access the effect of relaxation time onto biological thermal response. Numerical results show a difference in temperature profile between these two approaches during non-equilibrium condition i.e at the prior phases of laser heating and cooling whereas the results overlaps at higher instants. Since the DPL based bioheat conduction model can predict the inherent wave nature of the thermal front which is propagating at a finite speed.

Four groups of rats (n=6 per group) comprising of Group-I (control) -kept at 32 degrees C, Group-II -exposed to heat stress alone, Group-III received RGJ (0.8 ml/rat/day) alone and Group-IV exposed to heat stress and received RGJ at same dose. Analysis of blood and testicular tissue exhibited significant reduction in serum testosterone, testicular superoxide dismutase, testicular catalase and testicular glutathione (all p < 0.001); whereas, significant rise in the level of serum corticosteroid, testicular lipid peroxidase and the apoptotic enzyme caspase-3 of testis (all p < 0.001) were observed along with substantial increase in testicular Hsp72 and Hsf-1, and decrease in 17 beta-HSD3 were noted in heat stressed rats compared to controls. In Group-IV rats, RGJ administration could restore these parameters to normal levels. The signs of retention were clear in Group-IV rats and found to be significantly different as compared to that of the Group-II rats. In testicular histology of rats exposed to heat stress alone revealed remarkable germ cell degeneration and tubular deformations which were prevented by RGJ treatment (Group-IV).

article,Intraspecific geographic variation in thermal limits and acclimatory capacity in a wide distributed endemic frog,"Barria, Aura M. and Bacigalupe, Leonardo D.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Intraspecific variation in physiological traits and the standard metabolic rate (SMR) is common in widely distributed ectotherms since populations at contrasting latitudes experiences different thermal conditions. The climatic variability hypothesis (CVH) states that populations at higher latitudes presents higher acclimation capacity than those at lower latitudes, given the wider range of climatic variability they experience. The endemic four-eyed frog, Pleurodema thaul is widely distributed in Chile. We examined the variation in maximum and minimum critical temperatures (CTmax and CTmin), preferred temperature (T-pref), SMR and their acclimatory capacity in two populations from the northern and center of its distribution. All the traits are higher in the warmer population. The capacity for acclimation varies between traits and, with the exception of CTmax and T-pret, it is similar between populations. This pattern could be explained by the higher daily thermal variability in desert environments, that increases plasticity to the levels found in the high latitude population. However, we found low acclimatory capacity in all physiological traits, of only about 3\% for CTmin) 10\% for CTmax and T-pref and 1\% for SMR. Thus, despite the fact that Pleurodema thaul possess some ability to adjust thermal tolerances in response to changing thermal conditions, this acclimatory capacity seems to be unable to prevent substantial buffering when body temperatures rise. The low acclimatory capacity found for P. thaul suggests that this species use behavioral rather than physiological adjustments to compensate for environmental variation, by exploiting available micro-environments with more stable thermal conditions.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.08.010,69,NA,254-260,NA,Intraspecific geographic variation; Acclimatory capacity; Climatic variability hypothesis; Thermal limits; Standard metabolic rate; Amphibians

article,Thermogenic and psychogenic recruitment of human eccrine sweat glands: Variations between glabrous and non-glabrous skin surfaces,"Machado-Moreira, Christiano A. and Taylor, Nigel A. S.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Human eccrine sweat-gland recruitment and secretion rates were investigated from the glabrous (volar) and non-glabrous hand surfaces during psychogenic (mental arithmetic) and thermogenic stimuli (mild hyperthermia). It was hypothesised that these treatments would activate glands from both skin surfaces, with the non thermal stimulus increasing secretion rates primarily by recruiting more sweat glands. Ten healthy men participated in two seated, resting trials in temperate conditions (25-26 degrees C). Trials commenced under normothermic conditions during which the first psychogenic stress was applied. That was followed by passive heating (0.5 degrees C mean body temperature elevation) and thermal clamping, with a second cognitive challenge then applied. Sudomotor activity was evaluated from both hands, with colourimetry used to identify activated sweat glands, skin conductance to determine the onset of precursor sweating and ventilated sweat capsules to measure rates of discharged sweating. From glandular activation and sweat rate data, sweat-gland outputs were derived. These psychogenic and thermogenic stimuli activated sweat glands from both the glabrous and non-glabrous skin surfaces, with the former dominating at the glabrous skin and the latter at the non-glabrous surface. Indeed, those stimuli individually accounted for similar to 90\% of the site-specific maximal number of activated sweat glands observed when both stimuli were simultaneously applied. During the normothermic psychological stimulation, sweating from the glabrous surface was elevated via a 185\% increase in the number of activated glands within the first 60 s. The hypothetical mechanism for this response may involve the serial activation of additional eccrine sweat glands during the progressive evolution of psychogenic sweating.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.03.002,65,NA,145-152,NA,Activated sweat glands; Non-thermal sweating; Psychological sweating; Sweat-gland output; Sweat-gland recruitment; Sudomotor

We conducted several tests to demonstrate the performance of the TCC. Across the physiologically relevant range of 5-37 degrees C, the TCC took 26.5-50.0 min to reach the desired set point temperature. Once at set point, temperature inside the chamber was controlled with an accuracy of +/- 1.0 degrees C. User-entry effects on deviations from and return times to set point temperature were minimal. Overall, performance of the TCC was sufficient to make precise physiological measurements of insect metabolic rate while controlling assay temperature. Major advantages of the TCC include its simplicity, flexibility, and low cost. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Leptin is an adipose signal and plays vital role in energy homeostasis mainly by action in brain. To test the hypothesis that leptin plays a role in facilitating the process of hibernation, squirrels were administrated with recombinant murine leptin (1 mu g/day) through intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection for 12 days during fattening. From day 7 to 12, animals were moved into a cold room (5 +/- 1 degrees C) with constant darkness which functioned as hibernaculum. Energy intake, body mass and core body temperature (T-b) were continuously monitored throughout the course of experiment. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) was measured under both warm and cold conditions. At the end of leptin administration, we measured the serum concentration of hormones related to energy regulation, mRNA expression of hypothalamic neuropeptides and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) levels in brown adipose tissue (BAT). Our results showed that during leptin administration, the cumulative food intake and increase of body mass were suppressed. while T-b and RMR were unaltered. The proportion of torpid squirrels was not different between two groups. At the end of leptin administration, the expressions of hypothalamic neuropeptide Y and agouti gene-related protein were suppressed. There were no differences in UCP1 mRNA expression or protein content in BAT between groups. Our data suggest that leptin can affect energy intake via hypothalamic neuropeptides, but is not involved in the initiation of hibernation in fattening Daurian ground squirrels.

article,Design and testing of a liquid cooled garment for hot environments,"Guo, Tinghui and Shang, Bofeng and Duan, Bin and Luo, Xiaobing",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Liquid cooled garments (LCGs) are considered a viable method to protect individuals from hyperthermia and heat-related illness when working in thermally stressful environments. While the concept of LCGs was proposed over 50 years ago, the design and testing of these systems is undeveloped and stands in need of further study. In this study, a detailed heat transfer model of LCG in a hot environment was built to analyze the effects of different factors on the LCG performance, and to identify the main limitations to achieve maximum performance. An LCG prototype was designed and fabricated. Series of tests were done by a modified thermal manikin method to validate the heat transfer model and to evaluate the thermal properties. Both experimental and predicted results show that the heat flux components match the heat balance equation with an error of less than 10\% at different flowrate. Thermal resistance analysis also manifests that the thermal resistance between the cooling water and the ambient (R-2) is more sensitive to the flowrate than to the one between the skin surface and the cooling water (R-1). When the flowrate increased from 225 to 544 mL/min, R-2 decreased from 0.5 to 0.3 degrees C m(2)/W while R-1 almost remained constant. A specific duration time was proposed to assess the durability and an optimized value of 1.68 h/kg was found according to the heat transfer model. The present heat transfer model and specific duration time concept could be used to optimize and evaluate this kind of LCG respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Explicit formula of finite difference method to estimate human peripheral tissue temperatures during exposure to severe cold stress,"Khanday, M. A. and Hussain, Fida",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"During cold exposure, peripheral tissues undergo vasoconstriction to minimize heat loss to preserve the maintenance of a normal core temperature. However, vasoconstricted tissues exposed to cold temperatures are susceptible to freezing and frostbite-related tissue damage. Therefore, it is imperative to establish a mathematical model for the estimation of tissue necrosis due to cold stress. To this end, an explicit formula of finite difference method has been used to obtain the solution of Pennes' bio-heat equation with appropriate boundary conditions to estimate the temperature profiles of dermal and subdermal layers when exposed to severe cold temperatures. The discrete values of nodal temperature were calculated at the interfaces of skin and subcutaneous tissues with respect to the atmospheric temperatures of 25 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 15 degrees C, 5 degrees C, -5 degrees C and -10 degrees C. The results obtained were used to identify the scenarios under which various degrees of frostbite occur on the surface of skin as well as the dermal and subdermal areas. The explicit formula of finite difference method proposed in this model provides more accurate predictions as compared to other numerical methods. This model of predicting tissue temperatures provides researchers with a more accurate prediction of peripheral tissue temperature and, hence, the susceptibility to frostbite during severe cold exposure.

article,"Behaviorally mediated, warm adaptation: A physiological strategy when mice behaviorally thermoregulate","Gordon, Christopher J. and Aydin, Cenk and Repasky, Elizabeth A. and Kokolus, Kathleen M. and Dheyongera, Geoffrey and Johnstone, Andrew F. M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Laboratory mice housed under standard vivarium conditions with an ambient temperature (T-a) of similar to 22 degrees C are likely to be cold stressed because this T-a is below their thermoneutral zone (TNZ). Mice raised at T(a)s within the TNZ adapt to the warmer temperatures, developing smaller internal organs and longer tails compared to mice raised at 22 degrees C. Since mice prefer T(a)s equal to their TNZ when housed in a thermocline, we hypothesized that mice reared for long periods (e.g., months) in a thermocline would undergo significant changes in organ development and tail length as a result of their thermoregulatory behavior. Groups of three female BALB/c mice at an age of 37 days were housed together in a thermocline consisting of a 90 cm long aluminum runway with a floor temperature ranging from 23 to 39 degrees C. Two side-by-side thermoclines allowed for a total of 6 mice to be tested simultaneously. Control mice were tested in isothermal runways maintained at a T-a of 22 degrees C. All groups were given cotton pads for bedding/nest building. Mass of heart, lung, liver, kidney, brain, and tail length were assessed after 73 days of treatment. Mice in the thermocline and control (isothermal) runways were compared to cage control mice housed 3/cage with bedding under standard vivarium conditions. Mice in the thermocline generally remained in the warm end throughout the daytime with little evidence of nest building, suggesting a state of thermal comfort. Mice in the isothermal runway built elaborate nests and huddled together in the daytime. Mice housed in the thermocline had significantly smaller livers and kidneys and an increase in tail length compared to mice in the isothermal runway as well as when compared to the cage controls. These patterns of organ growth and tail length of mice in the thermocline are akin to warm adaptation. Thus, thermoregulatory behavior altered organ development, a process we term behaviorally mediated, warm adaptation. Moreover, the data suggest that the standard vivarium conditions are likely a cold stress that alters normal organ development relative to mice allowed to select their thermal preferendum.

Thigh regions, both ventral and dorsal, had the highest Delta T-sk by sex (approximate to 1.0 degrees C). Tsk percentile below P-5 or P-10 and over P-90 or P-95 may be used to characterize hypothermia and hyperthermia states, respectively. Thermal patterns and Tsk tables were established for Brazilian adult men and women for each ROI. There is a low Tsk variation between sides of the body and gender differences were only significant for some ROIs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Temperature evolution in tissues embedded with large blood vessels during photo-thermal heating,"Paul, Anup and Narasirnhan, Arunn and Kahlen, Franz J. and Das, Sarit K.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"During laser-assisted photo-thermal therapy, the temperature of the heated tissue region must rise to the therapeutic value (e.g., 43 degrees C) for complete ablation of the target cells. Large blood vessels (larger than 500 micron in diameter) at or near the irradiated tissues have a considerable impact on the transient temperature distribution in the tissue. In this study, the cooling effects of large blood vessels on temperature distribution in tissues during laser irradiation are predicted using finite element based simulation. A uniform flow is assumed at the entrance and three-dimensional conjugate heat transfer equations in the tissue region and the blood region are simultaneously solved for different vascular models. A volumetric heat source term based on Beer-Lambert law is introduced into the energy equation to account for laser heating. The heating pattern is taken to depend on the absorption and scattering coefficients of the tissue medium. Experiments are also conducted on tissue mimics in the presence and absence of simulated blood vessels to validate the numerical model. The coupled heat transfer between thermally significant blood vessels and their surrounding tissue for three different tissue-vascular networks are analyzed keeping the laser irradiation constant. A surface temperature map is obtained for different vascular models and for the bare tissue (without blood vessels). The transient temperature distribution is seen to differ according to the nature of the vascular network, blood vessel size, flow rate, laser spot size, laser power and tissue blood perfusion rate. The simulations suggest that the blood flow through large blood vessels in the vicinity of the photothermally heated tissue can lead to inefficient heating of the target. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Temperature distributions in the tissues are specific to the tumor grades, its locations and sizes, and these are different than that of a normal tissue.

article,Field data confirm the ability of a biophysical model to predict wild primate body temperature,"Mathewson, Paul D. and Porter, Warren P. and Barrett, Louise and Fuller, Andrea and Henzi, S. Peter and Hetem, Robyn S. and Young, Christopher and McFarland, Richard",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In the face of climate change there is an urgent need to understand how animal performance is affected by environmental conditions. Biophysical models that use principles of heat and mass transfer can be used to explore how an animal's morphology, physiology, and behavior interact with its environment in terms of energy, mass and water balances to affect fitness and performance. We used Niche Mapper (TM) (NM) to build a vervet monkey (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) biophysical model and tested the model's ability to predict core body temperature (T-b) variation and thermal stress against T-b and behavioral data collected from wild vervets in South Africa. The mean observed T-b in both males and females was within 0.5 degrees C of NM's predicted T(b)s for 91\% of hours over the five-year study period. This is the first time that NM's T-b predictions have been validated against field data from a wild endotherm. Overall, these results provide confidence that NM can accurately predict thermal stress and can be used to provide insight into the thermoregulatory consequences of morphological (e.g., body size, shape, fur depth), physiological (e.g. T-b plasticity) and behavioral (e.g., huddling, resting, shade seeking) adaptations. Such an approach allows users to test hypotheses about how animals adapt to thermoregulatory challenges and make informed predictions about potential responses to environmental change such as climate change or habitat conversion. Importantly, NM's animal submodel is a general model that can be adapted to other species, requiring only basic information on an animal's morphology, physiology and behavior.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102754,94,NA,NA,102754,Chlorocebus pygerythrus; ecological Energetics; Endotherm; Metabolic rate; Niche mapper; Thermoregulation; Vervet monkey

The error bound as well as stability analysis and numerical scheme validation are provided. The time to achieve for the position of hyperthermia is discussed in three cases: the DPL model, the time-fractional DPL model, and the space-time-fractional DPL model. The effect of variability of time and space fractional derivative orders (alpha and beta), transmitted power (P) and lagging times on the temperature profile in biological tissue at a different time are discussed in detail.

article,Thermal sensitivity mapping - warmth and cold detection thresholds of the human torso,"Schmidt, Daniel and Schlee, Guenther and Milani, Thomas L. and Germano, Andresa M. C.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Skin as the largest organ of the human body accomplishes many important functions, including thermoregulation. In this context, investigating cold (CDT) and warmth detection thresholds (WDT) constitutes an important research branch, and investigating thermal thresholds has a significant impact on the clothing and fabric textile industry. In this regard, not only the extremities, but also torso regions are of high relevance. However, only few examinations have conducted detailed mapping studies of the human torso. Additionally, some of these studies show certain methodological limitations. Furthermore, the issue of whether cutaneous thermal sensitivity is gender-dependent is still controversial. Therefore, the present study investigated the cutaneous thermal sensitivity (CDT, WDT) of 42 male and female young and healthy subjects. Measurements were taken at 11 anatomical regions. We found that gender plays an important role when investigating thermal thresholds: Females tended to be more sensitive than males. We also found considerable differences between the tested regions, even within the anterior torso, for example. We identified locations which were constantly sensitive (lower back), while others were consistently insensitive (e.g. scapula). We also detected greater data variability for males compared to females, and for WDT compared to CDT. Furthermore, mainly for WDT, we found a proximal-to-distal increase of thermal torso and upper arm sensitivity. In line with previous investigations, our subjects were more sensitive to cold than to warmth. The findings of this study have important implications. First, our data may complement basic research, e.g. in terms of reference data of body regional maps. Second, our data provides important insights that could be leveraged in the textile industry, and also used to optimize current broadly applicable test methods and tools, like thermal manikins and thermophysiological models.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102718,93,NA,NA,102718,Thermal sensitivity; Torso; Skin; WDT; CDT; Thermal thresholds

After 3 weeks of heat acclimation, gerbils exhibited a lower body temperature than the controls, and no difference in evaporative losses of water from the lung or saliva spreading compared with the controls. Heat acclimation did not alter the expression of aquaporin-1 and aquaporin-5 in the lungs and the expression of aquaporin-5 in the salivary glands. The expression of aquaporin-2 in the kidneys was kept stable, while the expression of aquaporin-1 in the kidneys was down-regulated. In addition, resting metabolic rate and non-shivering thermogenesis of heat-acclimated gerbils were reduced to 51\% and 55\% of the control group, respectively.

M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Although season has been shown to affect bull sperm quality and fertility in some studies, the effect of season on seminal plasma proteins has not been examined. In the present study, seminal plasma proteins were analysed by Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC), to separate the phosphorylcholine-binding proteins and heparin-binding proteins from the other proteins. Semen samples were collected from bulls in three seasons: winter, summer and the rainy season. Sperm quality was analysed by flow cytometry and computer assisted sperm analysis, and further aliquots of semen were used to prepare the seminal plasma for FPLC. Meteorological data were available from a location close to the bull station. There were slight differences in sperm kinematics between seasons, but other parameters of sperm quality were not different. Minor differences in the phosphorylcholine-binding proteins were detected according to season, being lower in summer than in winter or in the rainy season, although there were no changes in the heparin-binding proteins. Temperature, humidity and rainfall differed between winter and the rainy season, but no differences were observed between summer and the rainy season except in the temperature humidity index (THI). However, the THI was above the threshold indicative of heat stress in all seasons, which could explain why few seasonal differences in protein composition were detected in this study. Alternatively, the bulls could have been well-adapted to heat stress.

Dwayne",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Thermal heterogeneity provides options for organisms during extreme temperatures that can contribute to their fitness. Sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) communities exhibit vegetation heterogeneity that creates thermal variation at fine spatial scales. However, fire can change vegetation and thereby variation within the thermal environment of sagebrush communities. To describe spatial and temporal thermal variation of sagebrush communities following wildfire, we measured black bulb temperature (T-bb) at 144 random points dispersed within unburned and burned communities, for 24-h at each random point. We observed a wide thermal gradient in unburned (-7.3 degrees to 63.3 degrees C) and burned (-4.6 degrees to 64.8 degrees C) sagebrush communities. Moreover, unburned and burned sagebrush communities displayed high thermal heterogeneity relative to ambient temperature (T-air). Notably, T-bb varied by 47 degrees C in both unburned and burned communities when T-air was 20 degrees C. However, fire greatly reduced the buffering capacity and thermal refuge of Wyoming big sagebrush (A. tridentata wyomingensis) communities during low and high T-air. Furthermore, fire increased T-bb in Wyoming big sagebrush and mountain big sagebrush (A. t. vaseyana) during the mid-day hours. These results demonstrate how fire changes the thermal environment of big sagebrush communities and the importance of shrub structure which can provide thermal refuge for organisms in burned communities during extreme low and high T-air.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102488,89,NA,NA,102488,Sagebrush; Wildfire; Cheatgrass; Heterogeneity; Disturbance; Thermal environment

Knowledge on thermoprotective effects of this amino acid on freshwater invertebrates is very scarce. Therefore the aim of our study was to determine the effect of L-PROL at concentrations: 10 mg/L, 20 mg/L and 50 mg/L on swimming behavior (immobilization, swimming track density, swimming speed, turning ability) of Daphnia magna subjected to temperatures: 22 degrees C, 35 degrees C and 38 degrees C. We found that L-PROL elevated all the measured swimming parameters at 22 degrees C when compared to the untreated crustaceans. Furthermore, L-PROL alleviated heat-induced inhibition of these parameters in the experimental animals subjected to 35 degrees C. The results suggest that L-PROL stimulates swimming performance and alleviates alterations of swimming parameters induced by heat stress in D. magna. Moreover, these findings may support the hypothesis that in natural conditions, L-PROL may protect crustaceans against thermal stress.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.06.012,84,NA,154-163,NA,L-proline; Daphnia magna; Heat stress protection; Swimming behavior

The two species represent separate lineages of the subgenus Sophophora of Drosophila with contrasting tropical African and temperate Palearctic evolutionary histories. D. melanogaster has five copies of the inducible hsp70 gene distributed in two clusters, named A (with two copies) and B (three copies), while D. subobscura has only two copies arranged similarly to cluster A of D. melanogaster. The hsp70s of the two species also differ in their cis-regulatory regions, with D. melanogaster exhibiting features of a faster and more productive promoter. We predicted that the interspecific variation in acclimation capacity of heat tolerance is explained by evolved variation in expression of the major group of heat shock proteins. To test this prediction, we compared basal levels of gene expression at different developmental temperatures within each of the two species. Furthermore, we explored the heat hardening dynamics by measuring the induction of gene expression during a ramping assay. The prediction of a stronger heat shock protein response in D. melanogaster as compared to D. subobscura was confirmed for both long-term acclimation and short-term hardening. For D. melanogaster the upregulation with temperature ramping ranged from less than two fold (hsp26) to 2500 fold (hsp70A) increase. In all cases induction in D. melanogaster exceeded that of D. subobscura homologs. These differences correlate with structural differences in the regulatory regions of hsp70, and might explain differences in acclimation capacity among species. Finally, in D. melanogaster we found an indication of an inverse relationship between basal and induced levels of hsp70A and hsp83 expression, suggesting a divergent role for thermal adaptation of these genes at benign and stressful temperatures, respectively.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.005,84,NA,200-207,NA,Drosophila melanogaster; Drosophila subobscura; Hsp; Gene expression; Plasticity; Heat tolerance

We determined, for the first time, whether temperatures provided in vivo by wireless ingestible thermometric telemetric pills and a rectal probe compare favorably under conditions producing slow and rapid increases and decreases in rectal temperature. While wearing a rectal probe linked to a wireless ingestible thermometric telemetric pill, 13 participants completed the following phases: 1) 30 min sitting; 2) 45 min passive heat exposure (40-42 degrees C); 3) 45 min sitting while ingesting 7.5 g of ice slurry . kg body mass(-1); 4) running exercise (38 degrees C) at 68\% (V) over dot O-2max until a 39.5 degrees C increase in rectal probe temperature and; 5) cold-water (10 degrees C) immersion until a 1.5 degrees C decrease in rectal probe temperature.

Purpose: This observational study aims to describe the fluid balance and thermoregulatory responses of competitive triathletes racing at a major international competition in a cool environment. Methods: Fluid balance and thermoregulatory responses was measured in six (3 male, 3 female) national-level triathletes competing at the ITU World Triathlon Grand Finale in ambient temperatures of 19-20 degrees C (relative humidity (RH) similar to 55\%). Dry, nude BM was recorded before and immediately following the race. Fluid intake was monitored throughout the race. Pre-race urine samples were measured for specific gravity (USG). Each athlete ingested a core temperature (Tc) pill 5 h prior to the event and was monitored before and after the race. Results: Three of six triathletes arrived at the race mildly dehydrated (USG 1.021,1.024,1.030). One of these athletes (1F) subsequently withdrew from the race providing no further data. Another athlete (1M) ended the race vomiting providing invalid hydration data. The four remaining competitors' sweat loss was on average 2.15 L (range: 1.65-2.80 L), while fluid intake was 0.66 L (0.50-0.85 L). A mean loss of 3.3\% (2.2-4.5\%) BM was recorded. Tc increased by 2.0 degrees C (1.1-2.9 degrees C) and 4/5 athletes' (2 M, 2 F) Tc exceeded 39 degrees C by race-end.

We used general additive mixed models (GAMM) to determine how external temperature, mound size (volume) and the amount of vegetation shade affects mound internal temperature over a 24-h period. Internal mound temperature varied daily following changes of the external temperature, although the range of variation was much smaller. Active termite mounds maintained a higher internal temperature than inactive ones, and mound activity reinforced the positive effect of mound size and moderated the negative effect of vegetation shade on internal temperatures. In turn, external temperature fluctuations equally affected active and inactive mounds. Large mounds maintained near optimal internal temperatures compared to smaller sized mounds.

Two hundred and seventy one-day-old chicks (135 male chicks of each breed; Ross 308 and Cobb 500) were used in this work. On the 21st day of age, birds were allocated randomly into 3 equal groups till the 42 days of age (CON:raised in a thermoneutral condition; HS1 and HS2 groups were subjected to 4 and 6 h of daily thermal stress, respectively). Regardless of genetic type, thermal stress decreased the dressing percentage in broilers when compared with the thermoneutral conditions (p = 0.039). In both broiler strains, thermal stress for 6 h (HS2) increased the heterophil to lymphocyte ratio (p = 0.036) and the serum albumin, cholesterol and triglyceride levels (p = 0.023, 0.012 and 0.005, respectively) compared with the thermoneutral group. Under the thermonuteral and heat stress conditions, the Ross broiler chickens showed a significant lower serum triiodothyronine level compared with the Cobb boilers (p = 0.042). It is interesting to note that the expression of HSP70 in the liver of heat-stressed Ross broilers, either 4 or 6 h, was significantly (p = 0.002) higher than that reported in the heat-stressed Cobb broilers. In both broiler strains, the thermal stress for 6 h up-regulate the expression of SOD gene (p = 0.001), but down-regulate the expression of GH gene (p = 0.021) when compared with the CON group. In conclusion, chronic thermal stress down-regulate the mRNA expression of liver GH, concomitantly with an increase in the expression of HSP70 and SOD genes in both broiler strains.

The Arrhenius equation was applied to evaluate the degree of permanent thermal damage. A parametric study was performed to investigate the influence factors on the tissue internal temperature distribution, such as incident light intensity, the GNPs volume fraction, the periodic heating and cooling time, and the incident light position. It was found that period heating and cooling strategy can effectively avoid overheating of skin surface and heat damage of healthy tissue. Lower GNPs volume fraction will be better for the heat source distribution. Furthermore, the ring heating strategy is superior to the central heating strategy in the treatment effect.

The total number of injection points, as well as the their location within a tissue play a significant role in this method. Furthermore, the power of heating of a magnetic material per gram or specific loss power (SLP) is another important factor which needs to be investigated. As the uniform temperature of 43 degrees C is effective enough for a tumor regression in certain specific tissues, the inverse method is applied to find out both the number of injection points and their location. Furthermore, the effective amount of heat generated by nanoparticles is investigated by this technique. Two-dimensional cancerous brain tissue was considered, zero gradients on boundary conditions were assumed, and diffusion equation and Pennes equation, which is regarded as energy equation, were solved, respectively. Conjugate gradient technique as a one way of inverse methods is applied, and unknowns are investigated. The results illustrate that three-point injection with the best injection sites cannot induce a uniform temperate distribution of 43 degrees C, and although four-point injection can create a uniform temperature elevation, the amount of it cannot reach the 43 degrees C. Finally, the optimum locations of five point injection which are ((0.80,3.24), (0.80,0.84), (2.00,2.00), (3.20,3.24), (3.32,0.84)) (all dimensions are in mm) in the studied domain with special loss power of 420 W/g, all of which are obtained after 36 iterations, demonstrate that these conditions can meet the requirements of the magnetic fluid hyperthermia and can be considered for the future usage of researchers and investigators.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.01.010,72,NA,127-136,NA,Magnetic fluid hyperthermia; Inverse method; Magnetic nanoparticles; Uniform temperature elevation; Specific loss power
article,Predication of skin temperature and thermal comfort under two-way transient environments,"Zhou, Xin and Xiong, Jing and Lian, Zhiwei",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In this study, three transient environmental conditions consisting of one high-temperature phase within two low temperature phases were developed, thus creating a temperature rise followed by a temperature fall. Twenty-four subjects (including 12 males and 12 females) were recruited and they underwent all three test scenarios. Skin temperature on seven body parts were measured during the whole period of the experiment. Besides, thermal sensation was investigated at specific moments by questionnaires. Thermal sensation models including PMV model, Fiala model and the Chinese model were applied to predict subjects' thermal sensation with comparisons carried out among them. Results show that most predicated thermal sensation by Chinese model lies within the range of 0.5 scale of the observed sensation vote, and it agrees best with the observed thermal sensation in transient thermal environment than PMV and Fiala model. Further studies should be carried out to improve performance of Chinese model for temperature alterations between ``very hot{''} to ``hot{''} environment, for prediction error in the temperature-fall situation of C5 (37-32 degrees C) was over 0.5 scale.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.08.001,70,"A, SI",15-20,NA,Thermal sensation; Transient environment; Chinese model
article,Temperature stress and insect immunity,"Wojda, Iwona",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"This mini-review summarizes the recent knowledge concerning the role of temperature in the immune response of insects. The heat-shock is described as a common phenomenon in both homotherms and poikilotherms, and the role of heat-shock proteins in innate immunity is recalled taking into account its evolutionary aspects. Similar to homothermic animals, which show a febrile reaction to infection, poikilothermic invertebrates such as insects develop behavioural fever as part of their immune response. It can be elicited not only by the presence of the pathogen itself but also by injection of immune stimulators i.e. components of the microbial cell wall. In analogy to fever in homotherms, this process seems to be regulated by the prostaglandin/eicosanoid biosynthesis pathway. The positive effects of temperature change on insect immunity are presented in the paper.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.12.002,68,A,96-103,NA,Heat shock; Innate immunity; Insects; Poikilotherms; Behavioural fever

Parasitoids were obtained from a population of hosts located in the Andes range of central Chile. Upon emergence from the host parasitoids were randomly allocated to three thermal treatments (15 degrees C, 22.5 degrees C and 30 degrees C) and several life history traits were measured. We recorded higher survival at 15 degrees C and 22.5 degrees C and a lower survival at 30 degrees C. We found differences for both body mass and head width among thermal treatments. In females, body mass was higher at 15 degrees C than at 30 degrees C. An effect of breeding temperature and sex was observed only for developmental time. In addition, males reared at different temperatures during the pupal stage and held as adults at 22.5 degrees C, exhibited no differences in longevity between treatments. A significant effect of temperature on the mass of ovaries and lipid was recorded in females. These patterns suggest a trade-off between reproduction and survival. Overall, data seem to support the ``colder is better{''} hypothesis, because Andean parasitoid P. phasmophagae inhabiting and experimentally reared in colder environments have a higher performance in all environments.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.03.011,68,A,1-4,NA,Phasmovora phasmophagae; Agathemera crassa; Andes range; Ambient temperature; Life history
article,Heat transfer analysis of skin during thermal therapy using thermal wave equation,"Kashcooli, Meisam and Salimpour, Mohammad Reza and Shirani, Ebrahim",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Specifying exact geometry of vessel network and its effect on temperature distribution in living tissues is one of the most complicated problems of the bioheat field. In this paper, the effects of blood vessels on temperature distribution in a skin tissue subjected to various thermal therapy conditions are investigated. Present model consists of counter -current multilevel vessel network embedded in a three-dimensional triple-layered skin structure. Branching angles of vessels are calculated using the physiological principle of minimum work. Length and diameter ratios are specified using length doubling rule and Cube law, respectively. By solving continuity, momentum and energy equations for blood flow and Pennes and modified Pennes bioheat equations for the tissue, temperature distributions in the tissue are measured. Effects of considering modified Pennes bioheat equation are investigated, comprehensively. It is also observed that blood has an impressive role in temperature distribution of the tissue, especially at high temperatures. The effects of different parameters such as boundary conditions, relaxation time, thermal properties of skin, metabolism and pulse heat flux on temperature distribution are investigated. Tremendous effect of boundary condition type at the lower boundary is noted. It seems that neither insulation nor constant temperature at this boundary can cothpletely describe the real physical phenomena. It is expected that real temperature at the lower levels is somewhat between two predicted values. The effect of temperature on the thermal properties of skin tissue is considered. It is shown that considering temperature dependent values for thermal conductivity is important in the temperature distribution estimation of skin tissue; however, the effect of temperature dependent values for specific heat capacity is negligible. It is seen that considering modified Pennes equation in processes with high heat flux during low times is significant.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.12.007,64,NA,7-18,NA,Triple-layered skin; Counter-current vessels; Thermal therapy; Modified Pennes equation; Relaxation time

The quantity of semen (volume of semen, sperm concentration, total sperm production and total number of sperm) and the weight of the eggs as well as the semen quality (sperm motility, seminal plasma osmolality and pH, sperm pH and total protein content) were determined. Housing temperature had no apparent effect on quality or quantity of eggs produced, but did influence time of ovulation. On the other hand, temperature had a significant effect on the quantity and quality of sperm produced; 70\% of males held at 10 degrees C and 14 degrees C did not spermiate. The best ambient temperature for river lamprey adults held under controlled conditions was 7 degrees C. All males kept in this temperature yielded mature semen with the highest sperm motility parameters.

article,Physiological and psychological responses in Fire Instructors to heat exposures,"Watt, Peter W. and Willmott, Ashley G. B. and Maxwell, Neil S. and Smeeton, Nicholas J. and Watt, Eleanor and Richardson, Alan J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Aim: Fire Service Instructors (FSI) are exposed to many repeated periods of high environmental temperatures when training firefighters. Such repeated exposures will impose significant strains on the function of instructors. We aimed to measure the effects of a training programme including repeated exposures to heat, termed ``Wears{''} in the fire service, on the physiological, psychological some immunological markers of Fire Service Instructors. Methods: Six FSI and six physiologically matched controls completed blood and cardiovascular tests pre and post a 4 wk heat instruction training block, controls completed the tests only. FSI were given a 7 wk period of no heat exposure prior to starting the training. Physiological and perceptual measures were taken pre and post the first and last Wear of the 4 wk training protocol. Results: There were acute effects of a Wear on core temperature and physiological strain index, as well as measures of fatigue. The acute exposure to heat during a Wear led to a consistent decrease in CRP (-10\% to -40\%), increased IL6 concentrations 33-45\%) as well as increased RPE and TSS. Over the training programme significantly lower quantities of white cells, particularly neutrophils, leukocytes and monocytes were found in the FSI group. Between the start and the end of the 4 week training programme the FSI showed a significantly greater physiological strain index (PSI) to the Wears, which nearly doubled from 2.5 to 4.7 (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Physiological and psychological measures indicate that FSI may be experiencing symptoms and changes to their health consistent with an overtraining type condition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It overwinters as a diapausing fifth instar larva. The overwintering is often a critical part of the insect life-cycle in temperate zone. This study brings detailed analysis of seasonal changes in lipid composition and fluidity in overwintering larvae sampled in the field. Fatty acid composition of triacylglycerol (TG) depots in the fat body and relative proportions of phospholipid (PL) molecular species in biological membranes were analyzed. In addition, temperature of melting (T-m) in TG depots was assessed by using differential scanning calorimetry and the conformational order (fluidity) of PL membranes was analyzed by measuring the anisotropy of fluorescence polarization of diphenylhexatriene probe in membrane vesicles. We observed a significant increase of relative proportion of linoleic acid (C18:2n6) at the expense of palmitic acid (C16:0) in TG depots during the larval transition to diapause accompanied with decreasing melting temperature of total lipids, which might increase the accessibility of depot fats for enzymatic breakdown during overwintering. The fluidity of membranes was maintained very high irrespective of developmental mode or seasonally changing acclimation status of larvae. The seasonal changes in PL composition were relatively small. We discuss these results in light of alternative survival strategies of codling moth larvae (supercooling vs. freezing), variability and low predictability of environmental conditions, and other cold tolerance mechanisms such as extending the supercooling capacity and massive accumulation of cryoprotective metabolites.

article,Differential metabolism of brown adipose tissue in newborn rabbits in relation to position in the litter huddle,"Garcia-Torres, Esmeralda and Hudson, Robyn and Castelan, Francisco and Martinez-Gomez, Margarita and Bautista, Amando",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Competition for resources can contribute importantly to the early development of individual differences in behavioral and physiological phenotypes. In newborn rabbits, littermates compete for thermally favorable positions within the litter huddle. As brown adipose tissue (BAT) is the principal site of thermogenesis in such altricial young, we investigated differences in rabbit pups' growth and morphological differences in BAT associated with position within the huddle. We formed three treatment groups (7 litters/group): GI-birth (pups killed at birth); GII-chronic thermal challenge (pups killed after exposure to a moderately cold environmental during postnatal days 1-3); GIII acute thermal challenge (as for GII but pups killed after an additional 30 min exposure to a very cold environment on postnatal day 3). Interscapular BAT was removed at death for histological analysis, and triglyceride concentrations measured in serum. Pups occupying central positions in the huddle had higher skin temperatures, obtained more milk, and were more efficient at converting this into body mass, than pups occupying peripheral positions. There was no significant difference in BAT morphology or triglyceride concentrations between pups at birth, nor between central and peripheral pups chronically exposed to moderate cold until postnatal day 3. However, during acute cold exposure at this age, peripheral pups were less able to maintain their body temperature, they depleted BAT fat reserves almost completely, and they had lower serum concentrations of triglycerides than central pups. These findings confirm the contribution of early sibling relations to individual differences in growth and metabolic processes associated with thermoregulation in newborn rabbits.

The desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii), an imperiled species of arid environments in the southwest US, may have increasingly restricted windows for activity due to current warming trends. In summer 2013, we deployed 48 motion sensor cameras at the entrances of tortoise burrows to investigate the effects of temperature, sex, and day of the year on the activity of desert tortoises. Using generalized estimating equations, we found that the relative probability of activity was associated with temperature (linear and quadratic), sex, and day of the year. Sex effects showed that male tortoises are generally more active than female tortoises. Temperature had a quadratic effect, indicating that tortoise activity was heightened at a range of temperatures. In addition, we found significant support for interactions between sex and day of the year, and sex and temperature as predictors of the probability of activity. Using our models, we were able to estimate air temperatures and times (days and hours) that were associated with maximum activity during the study. Because tortoise activity is constrained by environmental conditions such as temperature, it is increasingly vital to conduct studies on how tortoises vary their activity throughout the Sonoran Desert to better understand the effects of a changing climate.

Four hundred eighty fingerlings were distributed into eight experimental groups. Four groups each of low density group (10 fishes/75 L water) and higher density group (30 fishes/75 L water) were fed a diet containing 0, 0.68, 1.36 or 2.72\% L-tryptophan in the diet, thus forming eight experimental groups namely, Low density control (LC) (basal feed +0\% L-tryptophan); LT1 (basal feed+0.68\% L-tryptophan); LT2 (basal feed+1.36\% L-tryptophan); LT3 (basal feed+2.72\% L-tryptophan); high density control (HC) (basal feed+0\% L-tryptophan); HT1 (basal feed+0.68\% L-tryptophan); HT2 (basal feed+1.36\% L-tryptophan); and HT3 (basal feed +2.72\% L-tryptophan) were fed at 3\% of the body weight. The test diets having crude protein 34.33 +/- 0.23 to 35.81 +/- 0.18\% and lipid 423.49 +/- 1.76 to 425.85 +/- 0.31 K Cal/100 g were prepared using purified ingredients. The possible role of dietary L-tryptophan on thermal tolerance and oxygen consumption rate was assessed in terms of critical thermal maxima (CTMax), critical thermal minima (CTMin), lethal thermal maxima (LTMax) and lethal thermal minima (LTMin). The CTMax, CTMin, LTMax and LTMin values were found to be significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the treatment groups with CTMax 42.94 +/- 0.037 (LT2); LTMax 43.18 +/- 0.070 (LT2); CTMin, 10.47 +/- 0.088 (LT2) and LTMin 9.42 +/- 0.062 (LT3), whereas the control group showed a lower tolerance level.

article,"Sex ratios in naturally incubating <i>Macrochelys temminckii</i> nests, a species with type II temperature-dependent sex determination","Miller, Jessica L. and Ligon, Day B.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The alligator snapping turtle, Macrochelys temminckii, exhibits type II temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), wherein females are produced at high and low incubation temperatures. This TSD pattern is well studied at constant temperatures, but little work has focused on sex ratios in natural nests that experience daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations. We monitored nesting activity of reintroduced Macro chelys temminckii at Tishomingo National Wildlife Refuge in 2010-2011. Nests located prior to predation were excavated to determine clutch size and the eggs were reburied with a temperature data logger to collect nest temperatures. Overall, 24\% of nests were protected with wire mesh prior to predation, and the average clutch size in intact nests was 22.4 eggs. Nest predation rates in the study population will likely approach 100\% if nest protection efforts do not continue. Temperature profiles were used to compare estimated sex ratios using two methods mean nest temperature during middle third of incubation and the degree-day model to actual sex ratios in naturally incubated Macrochelys temminckii nests. The sex ratio in all 2010 recruits was female-biased (91.8\% female); 2011 nests did not produce any hatchlings, likely the result of severe drought. The predicted sex ratios based on mean nest temperature and the degree-day model matched actual sex ratios in the warmer nests (0\% male), but the degree-day model estimate proved more accurate in the cooler nest. A strongly skewed population sex ratio could become a threat to this reintroduced population if the strongly female-biased sex ratio in 2010 reflects a long-term trend. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Metabolic thermogenesis and evaporative water loss in the Hwamei <i>Garrulax canorus</i>,"Xia, Su-Su and Yu, An-Wei and Zhao, Li-Dan and Zhang, Hui-Ying and Zheng, Wei-Hong and Liu, Jin-Song",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is thought to be a major hub in the network of physiological mechanisms connecting life history traits. Evaporative water loss (EWL) is a physiological indicator that is widely used to measure water relations in inter- or intraspecific studies of birds in different environments. In this study, we examined the physiological responses of summer-acclimatized Hwamei Garrulax canorus to temperature by measuring their body temperature (T-b), metabolic rate (MR) and EWL at ambient temperatures (T-a) between 5 and 40 degrees C. Overall, we found that mean body temperature was 42.4 degrees C and average minimum thermal conductance (C) was 0.15 ml O-2 g(-1) h(-1) degrees C-1 measured between 5 and 20 degrees C. The thermal neutral zone (TNZ) was 31.8-35.3 degrees C and BMR was 181.83 ml O-2 h(-1). Below the lower critical temperature, MR increased linearly with decreasing Ta according to the relationship: MR (ml O-2 h(-1)) = 266.59-2.66 T-a. At T(a)s above the upper critical temperature, MR increased with Ta according to the relationship: MR (ml O-2 h(-1))= 271.26+12.85 T-a. EWL increased with T-a according to the relationship: EWL (mg H2O h(-1))= 19.16+12.64 T-a and exceeded metabolic water production at T-a > 14.0 degrees C. The high T-b and thermal conductance, low BMR, narrow TNZ, and high evaporative water production/metabolic water production (EWP/MWP) ratio in the Hwamei are consistent with the idea that this species is adapted to warm, mesic climates, where metabolic thermogenesis and water conservation are not strong selective pressures.

While encapsulated into a condom linked to a thread, CTTPs can be inserted in and extracted from the rectum and be reused. The validity and reliability of the CTTP throughout repeated use remains to be demonstrated. Three CTTPs were compared to a YSI 401 wired rectal probe inside a circulating water bath (temperatures varying from 36.5 to 39.4 degrees C) during 50 h of intermittent use. Each CTTP underwent 20 trials comprising 6 protocols of varying duration: 6.1 h, 5.2 h, 4.3 h, 3.4 h and 2.5 h. All CTTPs were washed, switched off and disinfected after each trial to reproduce real-life use. Acceptable agreement between sensors was taken as a mean bias within +/- 0.27 C. None of the pills showed signs of deterioration following 50 h of reuse. As for relative validity, where all CTTPs showed robust coefficients of determination ranging from 0.98 to 0.99, absolute validity was excellent with each CTTP showing mean biases and typical errors of the estimate (TEE) within +/- 0.27 degrees C. Comparisons between the first and last trial each CTTP underwent resulted in means biases and TEEs within +/- 0.27 degrees C and coefficients of determination ranging from 0.97 to 0.99, which indicates strong absolute and relative reliability.

Method: Sixteen participants underwent the aforementioned conditions on four separate days. During each test participants rested supine (Environmental conditions: 30 degrees C, 50\% rh) for 30-min before 40 mL of L, M, H or P gel was applied to the anterior upper body, then rested 30-min thereafter. Primary measures included thermal sensation (TS), thermal comfort (TC), irritation (IRR), rectal temperature (Tre), and skin temperature (chest, forearm, thigh, calf), and EMG (trapezius, pectoralis major, sternocleidomastoid). The area under the curve (AUC) from minute 30 to 60 was compared between conditions using relevant non/parametric tests (alpha level = 0.05). Results: A cooling trend in Tre was observed following Placebo gel application, but this significantly (p < 0.05) reversed into a heat storage response in M and H. Both TS and TC significantly differed by condition (p < 0.001) in a dose-dependent manner, with L, M, and H doses eliciting significantly cooler sensations and more discomfort than P < 0.05). Irritation significantly differed by condition (p < 0.01) in a dose-dependent manner, with L and M eliciting significantly greater irritation than P < 0.01). No other differences were observed.

However, the mechanism of AMPK pathway regulation in fish coping with cold stress remains poorly understood. In the present study, the expression of AMPK and its upstream (LKB1 and CaMKK beta) and downstream genes (SITR1, FOXO1A, and TFAM) in the brain, muscle, and heart was analyzed while the flounder was under cold stress (0.2 +/- 0.2 degrees C). The results showed that low temperatures activated LKB1, CaMKK beta, and AMPK genes in the brain, and the activated AMPK induced expression of SITR1, FOXO1A, and TFAM. In the muscle tissue, the expression patterns of these genes presented a trend of initially decreasing and then increasing, and there was a delay in the response to low temperatures. At the cellular level, comparative analysis of the effects of the activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide1-beta-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR) and inhibitor compound C of the AMPK pathway demonstrated that cold stress was similar to AICAR, which activated the AMPK pathway with hysteresis. Thus, the regulation mechanism of AMPK under cold stress was preliminarily analyzed. In general, AMPK was involved not only in responses to low temperatures but also in energy regulation under cold stress.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102640,91,NA,NA,102640,Paralichthys olivaceus; AMPK pathway; Cold stress; Activator; Inhibitor

Methods: Ten subjects (24 +/- 3yrs, 7M/3F) performed 60 min of treadmill walking at 1.3 m/s and 7\% grade in an environmental chamber set to 33 degrees C and 10\% relative humidity while carrying a 22.7 kg pack on two different occasions. Subjects consumed either plain water or water plus flavor (Infuze), ad libitum, at each visit. Pre and post exercise, fluid consumption (change in fluid reservoir weight) and BM (nude) were measured. During exercise, heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), rate of perceived exertion (RPE), oxygen consumption (VO2), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), core temperature (T-C), and physiological strain index (PSI) were recorded every 15 min during exercise. Results: No significant differences were observed for fluid consumption between fluid conditions (512 +/- 97.2 mL water vs. 414.3 +/- 62.5 mL Infuze). Despite a significant decrease from baseline, there were no significant differences in overall change of BM (Delta -1.18 vs. -0.64 Kg) or percent body weight loss for water and Infuze conditions, respectively (1.58 +/- 0.6 and 0.79 +/- 0.2\%). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in HR (144 +/- 6 vs. 143 +/- 8 bpm), SBP (157 +/- 5 vs. 155 +/- 5 mmHg), RPE, VO2 (27.4 +/- 0.9 vs. 28.1 +/- 1.2 ml/Kg/min), RER, T-C (38.1 +/- 0.1 vs. 37.0 +/- 0.1 degrees C), and peak PSI (5.4 +/- 0.4 vs. 5.7 +/- 0.8) between conditions. Conclusions: Offering individuals the choice to actively manipulate flavor strength did not significantly influence ad libitum fluid consumption, fluid loss, or physiological strain during 60 min of moderate intensity exercise in the heat.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102575,89,NA,NA,102575,NA

Thirty-five physically fit Caucasians underwent a bout of exercise under four conditions wherein ambient conditions (heat vs no heat) and caffeine (placebo vs caffeine; double-blinded) were manipulated. Exercise consisted of a 60-min walk and 5-min step/squat test while wearing weighted backpack. Primary outcomes include measures of physiologic strain (Core temperature {[}T-r] and heart rate {[}HR]). Secondary measures included blood pressure, markers of sweat loss, and creatine kinase (CK). Repeated measures models were created to evaluate the individual and combined effects of heat and caffeine. Key results indicated that heat and caffeine significantly increased T-r and HR after walking and stair-stepping. No significant heat by caffeine interactions were detected, and caffeine's main effects were relatively low (<= 0.17 degrees C for T-r and <= 6.6 bpm for HR). Of note, heat and caffeine exhibited opposite effects on blood pressure: caffeine increased both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (by 6-7 mmHg) and heat decreased them (by 4-6 mm Hg; ps < 0.05). In summary, heat and caffeine affected physiologic strain during exercise but exhibited no synergistic effects. In contrast, neither factor affected muscle damage.

Traditionally in India, the villagers used to keep their drinking water in the earthen pot to make it cold during summer. The cold drinking water (24-28 degrees C) during summer gives a feeling of relief from the heat. Therefore, the present study was carried out to assess the effect of drinking earthen pot water on physiological response and behavior of sheep under heat stress for one month. For this purpose, eighteen Avishaan rams were selected from the experimental animal flock and they were equally divided into three groups; viz., control (CON), heat stress (HS) and heat stress with earthen pot water (HSC). The animals of HS and HSC were exposed to higher ambient temperatures to induce heat stress inside the psychometric chamber. The animals of CON and HS were provided with ad-libitum water of their ambient temperature whereas; HSC groups were provided with ad-libitum cold water (24-28 degrees C) earthen pot water. All the animals were offered with 400 gm concentrate mixture and ad-libitum Cenchrus hay. The bodyweight of HS rams was significantly reduced (P < 0.05) at the end of the experimental period as compared to their initial body weight. The total roughage and dry matter intake was significantly higher (P < 0.01) in HSC rams as compared to HS rams. The plasma thyroxine concentration was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in HSC as compared with HS group. The rumination time significantly reduced (P < 0.05) in HSC group. However, The blood biochemical did not differ among the groups. Therefore, it may be concluded that Avishaan rams have the ability to adapt to heat stress. Nevertheless, the availability of earthen pot cold drinking water under heat stress reduced their body weight loss, improves their metabolic activity and ultimately improves their welfare.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102476,87,NA,NA,102476,Sheep; Ram; Heat stress; Summer; Water; Cold
article,Effects of hair coat characteristics on radiant surface temperature in horses,"Jorgensen, Grete Helen Meisfjord and Mejdell, Cecilie Marie and Boe, Knut Egil",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Horse owners may lack knowledge about natural thermoregulation mechanisms in horses. Horses are managed intensively; usually stabled at night and turned out during the day. Some are clipped and many wear a blanket, practices which reduce the horse's ability to regulate heat dissipation. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between hair coat characteristics, body condition and infrared surface temperatures from different body parts of horses. Under standard conditions, the body surface temperature of 21 adult horses were investigated using infrared thermography. From several readings on the same body part, a mean temperature was calculated for each body part per horse. Detailed information on horse breed, age, management and body condition was collected. Hair coat samples were also taken for analyses. A mixed statistical model was applied. Warmblood horse types (WB) had lower hair coat sample weights and shorter hair length than coldblood horse types (CB). The highest radiant surface temperatures were found at the chest 22.5 +/- 0.9 degrees C and shoulders 20.4 +/- 1.1 degrees C and WB horses had significantly higher surface temperatures than CB horses on the rump (P < 0.05). Horses with a higher hair coat sample weight had a lower surface temperature (P < 0.001) and hind hooves with iron shoes had a significant lower surface temperature than unshod hind hooves (P = 0.03). In conclusion, individual assessment of radiant surface temperature using infrared thermography might be a promising tool to gather data on heat loss from the horses' body. Such data may be important for management advice, as the results showed individual differences in hair coat characteristics and body condition in horses of similar breeds.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102474,87,NA,NA,102474,Thermoregulation; Equine; Sensible heat loss; Behavior; Body condition; Hoof; Environment

Though, the relationship between physiological temperature and male germ cells is certainly immense, the magnitude of spermatozoal damage after exposure to heat is evidently degree and dose dependent. Further, there are contradictory reports related to germ cells apoptosis in relation to temperatures. Thus, currently the dynamics of temperature and time dependence on germ cell apoptosis were studied by modulating the heat treatment strategies. It was observed that the rate of apoptosis increased initially then decreased with time. The DNA fragmentation in the 10,000 x g supernatant of testis homogenate of rats that received heat treatment for 15-min, 30-min as well as 45-min treatment with 15-min intermittent period was found to be almost equal. In various heat treated animals, the apoptosis was found to be maximum after day-1 of treatments, which then followed a decreased pattern. These results indicate that there may be an initial induction of apoptosis in the germ cells, which later primed or programmed the other germ cells to activate protective mechanisms against heat induced DNA damage and thus protecting germ cell population to undergo apoptosis at later durations.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.021,84,NA,351-356,NA,Heat stress; Apoptosis; Necrosis; DNA; Testes

In this research, a 3D forearm model based on anthropometric measurement of 25 samples in Tehran, Iran was developed. The tissue temperature distribution is obtained via the Finite Volume Method (FVM) by considering the appropriate boundary conditions, blood perfusion, body metabolism, and the application of hyperthermia conditions on the tissue. The Pennes Bioheat Transfer Equation (PBHTE) is considered in this regard. Also, various thermophysical properties are assumed for the model in order to clarify the effects of such parameters on the tissue temperature distribution. The results of this study indicate that it is possible to provide the desired conditions for many therapeutic processes by controlling the parameters such as blood perfusion, body metabolism and the type of external heat source applied on the tissue. Generally, by decreasing the body metabolism, increasing the blood perfusion rate in tissue and applying a fluctuating heat flux, instead of uniform heat flux on the surface of the forearm skin, it is possible to provide the hyperthermia conditions without causing damages such as burn injuries to the other parts of the tissue.

This study was conducted to investigate the effects of alternating exposure to cold and heat on cold tolerance in eight young males. A daily acclimation program to cold and heat, which consisted of 2-h sitting at 10 degrees C air in the morning and 2-h running and rest at 30 degrees C air in the afternoon, was conducted for 14 consecutive days. Eight male subjects participated in a cold tolerance test (10 degrees C {[}+/- 0.3], 40\%RH{[}+/- 3]) before (PRE) and after (POST) completing the alternating exposure program. During the cold tolerance test, subjects remained sitting upright on a chair for 60 min. Rectal temperature (T-re) was lower in POST than in PRE during the 60-min cold tolerance test (P = 0.027). During the cold tolerance test, systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressures in POST were lower than those in PRE (P = 0.006, P = 0.005, and P = 0.004). No significant differences in skin temperatures between PRE and POST were found for the cold tolerance test. There were no significant differences in energy expenditure during cold exposure between PRE and POST. Subjects felt less cold in POST than in PRE (P = 0.013) whereas there was no significant difference in overall thermal comfort between PRE and POST.

M. and Haro, Daniel and Callejas, Breanna and Labib, Gloria and Pauly, Gregory B.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature has a substantial effect on both the physiology and behavior of ectothermic animals such as lizards. Physiology and behavior can also be influenced by ontogenetic and sex differences, but these effects are largely understudied in lizards. We examined ontogenetic and sex-based differences in thermal tolerances, preferred temperature, and temperature-dependent evaporative water loss rates in Italian Wall Lizards, Podarcis siculus, collected from an introduced population near Los Angeles, California, USA that were acclimated to laboratory conditions. Podarcis siculus has been introduced to multiple localities in the USA and the Mediterranean region and has demonstrated remarkable ability to adapt to novel climatic conditions. In the California population, adults of both sexes had a higher critical thermal maximum (CTmax) than juveniles, and adult females had a lower critical thermal minimum (CTmin) than juveniles and adult males. Thus, adult females had a significantly wider thermal breadth (CTmax - CTmin) compared to adult males and juveniles. Mass-specific evaporative water loss was higher in juveniles compared to adult males at intermediate temperatures. There was no significant difference among groups for preferred temperature. This implies that thermal tolerance, a physiological characteristic, varies with age and sex for this population, whereas thermal preference, a behavioral characteristic, does not. Interestingly, CTmin in for all age and sex classes was above temperatures likely experienced by some nonnative populations in winter, suggesting individuals need to find urban thermal retreats. These results add to the growing literature demonstrating that thermal tolerances and breadths can vary between sexes and across age classes in squamate species.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.10.010,78,NA,263-269,NA,Critical thermal maximum; Critical thermal minimum; Nonnative species; Preferred temperature; Thermal adaptation; Thermal preference; Thermal tolerance breadth; Thermoregulation; Evaporative water loss
article,The effect of captive breeding upon adult thermal preference in the Queensland fruit fly (<i>Bactrocera tryoni</i>),"Lynch, Kate E. and White, Thomas E. and Kemp, Darrell J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The Queensland fruit fly (Bactrocera tryoni) is a generalist pest that poses a significant threat to the Australian horticultural industry. This species has become broadly established across latitudes that encompass tropical to temperate climates, and hence populations occupy diverse thermal niches. Successful expansion across this range may have been brokered by evolutionarily labile features of breeding phenology, physiology and/or behaviour. We explored the potential role of behavioural flexibility by characterizing variation in adult thermal preference using a novel gradient apparatus. Flies oriented within this apparatus essentially at random in the absence of thermal variation, but sought and maintained precise positions when presented with an established gradient. Male and female flies from an `old' colony ( > 300 generations) and a `young' (F7) colony were compared. Whereas we found no difference between the sexes, flies from the young colony preferred higher temperatures (30.93 +/- 7.30 degrees C) and had greater individual variation than their counterparts from the old colony (28.16 +/- 5.63 degrees C). Given that B. tryoni are routinely maintained at 25 degrees C in the laboratory, a lower mean preference of the old colony is consistent with thermal adaptation. This is further supported by their reduced phenotypic variance, which follows as a logical consequence of stabilising selection given long-term environmental constancy. These results demonstrate that B. tryoni seek to thermoregulate via adult behaviour, and that individual temperature preference can be precisely measured using a gradient apparatus. The evidence for adaptive tuning of this behaviour has importance for both the design of captive rearing protocols as well as the prediction of invasive potential and species biogeography under future climatic variation.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.10.005,78,NA,290-297,NA,Thermal preference; Thermoregulation; Domestication; Q-fly; Bactrocera; Adaptation

Various thermal indices exist in the literature that can be used to assess the level of heat stress on cattle by linking environmental conditions with physiological responses. However, many of these indices either do not incorporate all of the environmental variables or may consider only the main effects of the independent variables without considering the interaction effects. The objective of this study was to develop a thermal index for dairy cattle, referred to as Equivalent Temperature Index for Cattle (ETIC), which incorporates air temperature, relative humidity, air velocity and solar radiation and their interactions. Environmental and physiological data from two studies were pooled together to develop and validate the proposed index. The index (ETIC) expressed in terms of temperature units is derived from equivalent air temperature of relative humidity, air velocity and solar radiation. ETIC heat-stress level thresholds were defined according to the thresholds for temperature-humidity index (THI). The results indicate that the ETIC model predicts the measured physiological responses very well. The coefficient of correlation, R-2, for skin temperature, core-body temperature, and respiration rate were 0.79, 0.40, and 0.49, respectively. The ETIC prediction of skin temperatures, core-body temperatures, and respiration rates were better compared to that of three recently developed thermal indices (adjusted THI, heat load index, and comprehensive climate index).

article,Investigating factors affecting the body temperature of dogs competing in cross country (canicross) races in the UK,"Carter, Anne J. and Hall, Emily J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Increasing numbers of people are running with their dogs, particularly in harness through the sport canicross. Whilst canicross races are typically held in the winter months, some human centred events are encouraging running with dogs in summer months, potentially putting dogs at risk of heat related injuries, including heatstroke. The aim of this project was to investigate the effects of ambient conditions and running speed on post race temperature of canicross dogs in the UK, and investigate the potential risk of heatstroke to canicross racing dogs. The effects of canine characteristics (e.g. gender, coat colour) were explored in order to identify factors that could increase the risk of exercise-induced hyperthermia (defined as body temperature exceeding the upper normal limit of 38.8 degrees C).108 dogs were recruited from 10 race days, where ambient conditions ranged from -5 to 11 degrees C measured as universal thermal comfort index (UTCI). 281 post race tympanic membrane temperatures were recorded, ranging from 37.0-42.5 degrees C. There was a weak correlation between speed and post-race temperature (r = 0.269, P < 0.001). Whilst no correlation between any single environmental factor or UTCI and post-race temperature was found, the proportion of dogs developing exercise-induced hyperthermia during the race increased with UTCI (r = 0.688, P = 0.028). Male dogs (chi(1) = 18.286, P < 0.001), and dark coated dogs (chi(2) = 8.234, P = 0.014), were significantly more likely to finish the race with a temperature exceeding 40.6 degrees C. Prolonged elevatrn of body temperature above this temperature is likely to cause heatstroke. At every race dogs exceeded this critical temperature, with 10.7\% (n = 30) of the overall study population exceeding this temperature throughout the study period.

These can often be reduced to simple input requirements and simple predictions for pragmatic applications. This paper demonstrates this modeling efficiency by tracing the development of one such simple model, the Heat Strain Decision Aid (HSDA), originally developed to address Army needs. The HSDA, which derives from the Givoni-Goldman equilibrium body core temperature prediction model, uses 16 inputs from four elements: individual characteristics, physical activity, clothing biophysics, and environmental conditibns. These inputs are used to mathematically predict core temperature (T-c) rise over time and can estimate water turnover from sweat loss. Based on a history of military applications such as derivation of training and mission planning tools, we conclude that the HSDA model is a robust integration of physiological rules that can guide a variety of useful predictions.

Non-selectivity of tissue heating in conventional hyperthermia methods results in collateral damages to healthy tissues and this is the greatest obstacle against hyperthermia in clinic. Herein, to promote the efficiency of conventional hyperthermia methods, nanoparticle-enhanced heating from 1 MHz ultrasound was investigated in vitro and in vivo. The experiments were conducted on two mediums; (1) various colloidal nano-solutions (in vitro section) and (2) CT26 mouse colon carcinoma tumor loaded by various nanoparticles (in vivo section). Experiments, in this study were designed to evaluate and compare the sonosensitizing potentials of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs), and nano-graphene oxide (NGO) in enhancement of ultrasound-induced heat generation. The temperature profile of the solutions and the animal tumors containing nanoparticles were recorded during sonication. An increased heating rate during sonication was observed for both in vitro and in vivo mediums when the nanoparticles were present. Our in vitro experiments revealed that percentages of increases in temperature elevation rates were 12.5\%, 20.4\%, and 37.5\% for IONPs, NGO, and AuNPs, respectively. Compared to the nanoparticles-free tumors, direct injection of AuNPs, NGO and IONPs into the tumors and subsequent sonication for 10 min caused an increased temperature elevation rate of 37.5\%, 24.1\% and 16.1\%, respectively. AuNPs, IONPs and NGO are proposed as ultrasound responsive nanomaterials with the potential of focusing the energy of acoustic waves on the tumor and inducing localized hyperthermia.",2016,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.10.007,62,A,84-89,NA,Cancer; Hyperthermia; Heating rate; Nanoparticle; Ultrasound
article,The use of thermal imaging to assess the effectiveness of ice massage and cold-water immersion as methods for supporting post-exercise recovery,"Adamczyk, Jakub Grzegorz and Krasowska, Ilona and Boguszewski, Dariusz and Reaburn, Peter",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Cold water immersion (CWI) and ice massage (IM) are commonly used treatments to prevent the delay onset of muscle soreness (DOMS); however, little is known on their relative benefits and effectiveness to lower tissue temperature. This study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of IM and CMI on tissue temperature and potential benefit to preventing DOMS. The research encompassed 36 subjects divided into three groups of twelve depending on the form of recovery: ice massage (IM), cold-water immersion (CWI), or passive recovery (PAS). All the participants were asked to jump as high as possible from a full squat for one minute. Thermal imaging was conducted at rest, immediately following the exercise, immediately after the trial, following the recovery treatment, and after 30 min of rest. Their pain levels were assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). After applying the selected method for supporting recovery, the LA level decreased by 4.25 mmol/L in the IM group, and by 4.96 mmol/L in the CWI group (IM vs. CWI p > 0.05). The 2.75 mmol/L decrease in lactate concentration in the PAS group was significantly lower than in the other groups (IM vs. PAS p < 0.05/ CWI vs. PAS p < 0.01). In both groups, T-sk after 30 min was significantly lower (Delta T-sk similar to 0.5 degrees C) than at rest (p < 0.05). In turn, T-sk in the PAS group returned to the resting values (p > 0.05). Seventy-two hours after the exercise, a clear decrease in discomfort was observed in the IM and CWI groups compared to the PAS group. The two applied treatments have proven to be effective both in utilizing lactate and preventing DOMS. Depending on training requirements, we recommend the use of IM when athletes experience localized muscle fatigue. One the other hand, CWI is recommended in situations of global or generalized muscle injury or fatigue. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Impact of water temperature on the growth and fatty acid profiles of juvenile sea cucumber <i>Apostichopus japonicus</i> (Selenka),"Yu, Haibo and Zhang, Cheng and Gao, Qinfeng and Dong, Shuanglin and Ye, Zhi and Tian, Xiangli",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The present study determined the changes in the fatty acid (FA) profiles of juvenile sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus in response to the varied water temperature. Sea cucumbers with similar size (4.02 +/- 0.11 g) were cultured for 8 weeks at 14 degrees C, 18 degrees C, 22 degrees C and 26 degrees C, respectively. At the end of the experiment, the specific growth rate (SGR) and the profiles of FAs in neutral lipids and phospholipids of the juvenile sea cucumbers cultured at different temperatures were determined. The SGRs of the sea cucumbers cultured at 26 degrees C significantly decreased 46.3\% compared to thos cultured at 18 degrees C. Regression analysis showed that the SGR-temperature (T) relationship can be expressed as SGR=-0.0073 T-2+0.255 T - 1.0231 (R-2=0.9936) and the highest SGR was predicted at 17.5 degrees C. For the neutral lipids, the sum of saturated FAs (SFAs), monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs) or polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) of the sea cucumbers that were cultured at the water temperature from 18 degrees C-26 degrees C did not change significantly, indicating the insensitivity of FA profiles for the neutral lipids of sea cucumbers in response to increasing water temperature. For phospholipids, the sum of PUFAs in the sea cucumbers dramatically decreased with the gradually increased water temperature. The sum of SFAs and MUFAs of sea cucumbers, however, increased with the gradually elevated water temperature. In particular, the contents of highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs), including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the phospholipids of the sea cucumbers decreased 37.2\% and 26.1\%, respectively, when the water temperature increased from 14 degrees C to 26 degrees C. In summary, the sea cucumbers A. japonicus can regulate the FA compositions, especially the contents of EPA and DHA, in the phospholipids so as to adapt to varied water temperature.

article,Thermal equilibrium of goats,"Maia, Alex S. C. and Nascimento, Sheila T. and Nascimento, Carolina C. N. and Gebremedhin, Kifle G.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The effects of air temperature and relative humidity on thermal equilibrium of goats in a tropical region was evaluated. Nine non-pregnant Anglo Nubian nanny goats were used in the study. An indirect calorimeter was designed and developed to measure oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, methane production and water vapour pressure of the air exhaled from goats. Physiological parameters: rectal temperature, skin temperature, hair-coat temperature, expired air temperature and respiratory rate and volume as well as environmental parameters: air temperature, relative humidity and mean radiant temperature were measured. The results show that respiratory and volume rates and latent heat loss did not change significantly for air temperature between 22 and 26 degrees C. In this temperature range, metabolic heat was lost mainly by convection and long-wave radiation. For temperature greater than 30 degrees C, the goats maintained thermal equilibrium mainly by evaporative heat loss. At the higher air temperature, the respiratory and ventilation rates as well as body temperatures were significantly elevated. It can be concluded that for Anglo Nubian goats, the upper limit of air temperature for comfort is around 26 degrees C when the goats are protected from direct solar radiation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Do female newts modify thermoregulatory behavior to manipulate egg size?,"Toufarova, Eliska and Gvozdik, Lumir",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Reproductive females manipulate offspring phenotypes by modifying conditions during embryogenesis. In ectotherms, the environmental control over embryogenesis is often realized by changes in maternal thermoregulation during gravidity. To determine if reproduction influences thermoregulatory behavior in species where females lay eggs shortly after fertilization (strict oviparity), we compared preferred body temperatures (T-p) between reproductive (egg-laying) and non-reproductive female newts, Ich-thyosaura alpestris. Next, we exposed reproductive females to temperatures mimicking T-p ranges of reproductive and non-reproductive individuals to find out whether the maternally modified thermal regime influences ovum and jelly coat volume, and early cleavage rates at the time of oviposition. In the thermal gradient, reproductive females maintained their body temperatures within a narrower range than non-reproductive individuals. The exposure of ovipositing females to temperatures preferred during their reproductive and non-reproductive period had a negligible influence on egg size and early cleavage rates. We conclude that the modification of maternal thermoregulatory behavior provides a limited opportunity to manipulate egg traits in newts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Urban roost temperatures of large-spotted-genets: The effect of anthropogenic structures,"Widdows, C. D. and Downs, C. T.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Generally, large-spotted genets (Genetta tigrina) use tree hollows and canopies as daytime roosts during their inactive phase. However, there has been an increasing tendency for individuals to make use of anthropogenic structures, such as roofs, within urban landscapes in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. This study investigated the roosting thermal dynamics of large-spotted genets within the urban suburbs of Kloof. Roost temperatures were recorded with i-Button (R) temperature loggers at known large-spotted genet roosts in anthropogenic structures as well as in natural roost sites. Over the seasons, temperatures varied significantly between months and among different roosts. However, anthropogenic roost temperatures were higher than ambient temperatures throughout the study period. Furthermore, anthropogenic roosts had higher temperatures (with lower variability) than natural roost sites. This study highlighted the importance of anthropogenic structures as daytime roosts for large-spotted genets within an urban mosaic. However, high temperatures experienced during the summer can be detrimental to juvenile large-spotted genets resulting in plasticity of breeding behaviour and a switch to producing young in cooler months.

article,A prediction model for ocular damage - Experimental validation,"Heussner, Nico and Vagos, Marcia and Spitzer, Martin S. and Stork, Wilhelm",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"With the increasing number of laser applications in medicine and technology, accidental as well as intentional exposure of the human eye to laser sources has become a major concern. Therefore, a prediction model for ocular damage (PMOD) is presented within this work and validated for long-term exposure. This model is a combination of a raytracing model with a thermodynamical model of the human and an application which determines the thermal damage by the implementation of the Arrhenius integral. The model is based on our earlier work and is here validated against temperature measurements taken with porcine eye samples. For this validation, three different powers were used: 50 mW, 100 mW and 200 mW with a spot size of 1.9 mm. Also, the measurements were taken with two different sensing systems, an infrared camera and a fibre optic probe placed within the tissue. The temperatures were measured up to 60 s and then compared against simulations. The measured temperatures were found to be in good agreement with the values predicted by the PMOD-model. To our best knowledge, this is the first model which is validated for both short-term and long-term irradiations in terms of temperature and thus demonstrates that temperatures can be accurately predicted within the thermal damage regime.

article,Distinct vasopressin content in the hypothalamic supraoptic and paraventricular nucleus of rats exposed to low and high ambient temperature,"Jasnic, N. and Dakic, T. and Bataveljic, D. and Vujovic, P. and Lakic, I. and Jevdjovic, T. and Djurasevic, S. and Djordjevic, J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Both high and low ambient temperature represent thermal stressors that, among other physiological responses, induce activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and secretion of argininevasopressin (AVP). The exposure to heat also leads to disturbance of osmotic homeostasis. Since AVP, in addition to its well-known peripheral effects, has long been recognized as a hormone involved in the modulation of HPA axis activity, the aim of the present study was to elucidate the hypothalamic AVP amount in the acutely heat/cold exposed rats. Rats were exposed to high (+38 degrees C) or low (+4 degrees C) ambient temperature for 60 min. Western blot was employed for determining hypothalamic AVP levels, and the difference in its content between supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN) was detected using immunohistochemical analysis. The results showed that exposure to both high and low ambient temperature increased hypothalamic AVP levels, although the increment was higher under heat conditions. On the other hand, patterns of AVP level changes in PVN and SON were stressor-specific, given that exposure to cold increased the AVP level in both nuclei, while heat exposure affected the PVN AVP content alone. In conclusion, our results revealed that cold and heat stress influence hypothalamic AVP amount with different intensity. Moreover, different pattern of AVP amount changes in the PVN and SON indicates a role of this hormone not only in response to heat as an osmotic/physical threat, but to the non-osmotic stressors as well.

article,Effect of heat stress-induced production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species on NADPH oxidase and heme oxygenase-1 mRNA levels in avian muscle cells,"Kikusato, Motoi and Yoshida, Hayami and Furukawa, Kyohei and Toyomizu, Masaaki",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Heat stress is a major factor inducing oxidative disturbance in cells. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cultured avian muscle cells in response to heat stress, and also focused attention on the interaction of mitochondrial superoxide anions with altered NADPH oxidase (NOX), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) mRNA levels in heat-stressed cells. Exposure of cells to heat stress conditions (41 degrees C, 6 h) resulted in increased mitochondrial superoxide and intracellular ROS levels, and increased carbonyl protein content as compared with that of normal cells (37 degrees C). The mitochondrial uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol lowered intracellular ROS levels in heat-stressed cells. Heat stress increased NOX4 mRNA and decreased HO-1 mRNA levels, while SOD1 and SOD2 mRNA levels remained relatively stable in heat-stressed cells. Addition of the superoxide scavenger 4-hydroxy TEMPO to the culture medium of heat-stressed cells restored mitochondrial superoxide and intracellular ROS levels as well as NOX4 and HO-1 mRNA levels to near-normal values. We suggest that mitochondrial superoxide production could play an influential role in augmenting oxidative damage to avian muscle cells, possibly via the up-regulation of NOX4 and down-regulation of HO-1 in heat-stressed avian muscle cells.

Knowledge of the primary sex ratio of populations with TSD is key for providing a baseline to inform management strategies and to accurately predict how future climate changes may affect turtle populations. However, there is a lack of robust data on offspring sex ratio at appropriate temporal and spatial scales to inform management decisions. To address this, we estimate the primary sex ratio of hawksbill hatchlings, Eretmochelys imbricata, from incubation duration of 5514 in situ nests from 10 nesting beaches from two regions in Brazil over the last 27 years. A strong female bias was estimated in all beaches, with 96\% and 89\% average female sex ratios produced in Bahia (BA) and Rio Grande do Norte (RN). Both inter-annual (BA, 88 to 99\%; RN, 75 to 96\% female) and inter-beach (BA, 92\% to 97\%; RN, 81\% to 92\% female) variability in mean offspring sex ratio was observed. These findings will guide management decisions in Brazil and provide further evidence of highly female-skew sex ratios in hawksbill turtles. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Behavioural thermoregulation and the relative roles of convection and radiation in a basking butterfly,"Barton, Madeleine and Porter, Warren and Kearney, Michael",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Poikilothermic animals are often reliant on behavioural thermoregulation to elevate core-body temperature above the temperature of their surroundings. Butterflies are able to do this by altering body posture and location while basking, however the specific mechanisms that achieve such regulation vary among species. The role of the wings has been particularly difficult to describe, with uncertainty surrounding whether they are positioned to reduce convective heat loss or to maximise heat gained through radiation. Characterisation of the extent to which these processes affect core-body temperature will provide insights into the way in which a species' thermal sensitivity and morphological traits have evolved. We conducted field and laboratory measurements to assess how basking posture affects the core-body temperature of an Australian butterfly, the common brown (Heteronympha metope). We show that, with wings held open, heat lost through convection is reduced while heat gained through radiation is simultaneously maximised. These responses have been incorporated into a biophysical model that accurately predicts the core-body temperature of basking specimens in the field, providing a powerful tool to explore how climate constrains the distribution and abundance of basking butterflies.

article,A comparison of galvanic skin conductance and skin wettedness as indicators of thermal discomfort during moderate and high metabolic rates,"Gerrett, Nicola and Redortier, Bernard and Voelcker, Thomas and Havenith, George",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The relationship between local thermal comfort, local skin wettedness (W-local) and local galvanic skin conductance (GSC) in four body segments during two different exercise intensities was compared in 10 males. In a balanced order, participants walked at 35\% VO2max for 45 min (WALK) (29.0 +/- 1.9 degrees C, 29.8 +/- 3.6\% RH, no wind) in one test and in a separate test ran at 70\% VO2, for 45 min (RUN) (26.2 +/- 2.1 degrees C, 31.1 +/- 7.0\% RH, no wind). During both tests, participants wore a loose fitting 100\% polyester long sleeve top and trouser ensemble with a low resistance to heat and vapour transfer (total thermal resistance of 0.154 m(2) KW-1 and total water vapour resistance of 35.9 m(2) Pa W-1). w(local), change from baseline in GSC (Delta GSC) and local thermal comfort were recorded every 5 min. The results suggest that both w(local) load and Delta GSC are strong predictors of thermal comfort during the WALK when sweat production is low and thermal discomfort minimal (r(2) > 0.78 and r(2) > 0.71, respectively). Interestingly, during the RUN w(local) plateaued at similar to 0.6 to 0.8 due to the high sweat production, whilst AGSC gradually increased throughout the experiment. AGSC had a similar relationship with thermal comfort to w(local) during the RUN (r(2) > 0.95 and r(2) > 0.94, respectively). Despite the strength of these relationships, the ability of mom/ to predict local thermal comfort accurately dramatically reduces in the exponential part of the curve. In a situation of uncompensated heat stress such as high metabolic rate in hot climate, where sweat production is high, Delta GSC shows to be a better predictor of local thermal comfort than w(local). The w(local) data shows regional differences in the threshold which triggers local discomfort during the WALK than RUN; lower values are found for upper arms (0.22 +/- 0.03 and 0.28 +/- 0.22) and upper legs (0.22 +/- 0.11 and 0.22 +/- 0.10), higher values for upper back (0.30 +/- 0.12 and 0.36 +/- 0.10) and chest (0.27 +/- 0.10 and 0.39 +/- 0.32), respectively. However, no regional differences in the threshold of discomfort are found in the AGSC data. Instead, the data suggests that the degree of discomfort experienced appears to be related to the amount of sweat within and around the skin (as indirectly measured by GSC) at each body site.

Rose-ringed parakeets Psittacula krameri are widely established outside their native range and are successful invaders in many countries, including South Africa. Physiological and behavioral responses to environmental conditions are considered to be major factors that influence the abundance and distribution of birds. As rose-ringed parakeets are able to tolerate wide varieties of climatic conditions as invaders, it is important to understand their physiological responses to these. This study examined the effects of seasonal changes in ambient temperatures (T-a) on metabolic rate and body temperature (T-b) of captive-bred rose-ringed parakeets. Resting metabolic rate at various Ta and basal metabolic rate were significantly lower in winter compared to summer, and the thermo-neutral zone was broader in winter than in summer. There was no significant difference in body mass (M-b) between seasons. These parakeets showed seasonal thermoregulatory responses that represented energy conservation as expected, rather than cold tolerance. They were relatively tolerant of low Ta and showed no hypothermia at 5 degrees C. Our results suggest that this species is physiologically and behaviorally equipped to cope with a range of climatic situations and this partly explains their global success as an invader species.

LVDP responses to steady-state isoproterenol infusions (10(-8) M) were determined at 37, 38, 39, and 40 degrees C. Preload-dependent LVDP was determined at 37 and 40 degrees C. Isoproterenol-induced LVDP and preload-dependent LVDP time controls were conducted in a separate group maintained at 37 degrees C. The percent increase in LVDP during isoproterenol infusion significantly decreased at 40 degrees C to 42 +/- 6 (SE), compared to 55 +/- 9, 55 +/- 6, and 53 +/- 7\% at 37, 38, and 39 degrees C, respectively. No significant differences were observed in the percent increase in LVDP to isoproterenol among the corresponding time controls (50 +/- 6, 47 +/- 3, 56 +/- 4, and 56 +/- 5\%). Preload-dependent LVDP decreased across the experimental protocol, but there were no cardiac temperature effects. These data indicate that p-adrenergic mediated contractility is not altered by moderate heating from normothermia but is compromised at very high temperatures (40 degrees C). Cardiac temperatures from 37 to 40 degrees C do not alter the inherent preload-dependent LVDP, indicating that the Frank-Starling relation is not directly affected within this temperature range.

article,Thermoregulatory behavior and oxygen consumption of <i>Octopus mimus</i> paralarvae: The effect of age,"Zuniga, Oscar and Olivares, Alberto and Rojo, Manuel and Eugenia Chimal, Maria and Diaz, Fernando and Uriarte, Iker and Rosas, Carlos",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Octopus mimus is an important cephalopod species in the coastal zone of Peru and Chile that is exposed to temperature variations from time to time due to El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) episodes when surface temperatures can reach 24 degrees C, 6 degrees C above typical temperatures in their habitat. The relationships between temperature and food availability are important factors that determine the recruitment of juveniles into the O. mimus population. The present study was to evaluate the relationship between thermoregulatory behavior and the age of paralarvae (summer population) to determine whether changes in this behavior occur during internal yolk consumption, making larvae more vulnerable to environmental temperature change. Oxygen consumption of paralarvae when 1-4 d old was determined to establish if respiration could be used to monitor the physiological changes that occur during yolk consumption. Horizontal thermal selection (17-30 degrees C), critical thermal maxima (CTMax), minima (CTMin), and oxygen consumption experiments were conducted with fasting paralarvae 1-4 d old at 20 degrees C. Preferred temperatures were dependent on the age of O. mimus paralarvae. One day old paralarvae selected a temperature 1.1 degrees C (23.4 degrees C) higher than 2 - 4 d old paralarvae (22.3 degrees C). The CTMax of paralarvae increased with age with values of 31.9 +/- 1.1 degrees C in 1-d-olds and 33.4 +/- 0.3 to 4-d-olds. CTMin also changed with age with low values in 2-d-old paralarvae (9.1 +/- 1.3 degrees C) and 11.9 +/- 0.9 degrees C in 4-d-old animals. The temperature tolerance range of paralarvae was age-dependent (TTD=difference between CTMax and CTMin) with higher values in 2 and 3 d old paralarvae (25-26 degrees C) as compared to 1 d old (23.1 degrees C) and 4 d old animals (22.7 degrees C). Oxygen consumption was not affected by the age of paralarvae, suggesting that mechanisms exist that compensate their metabloism until at least 4 d of age. The temperature tolerance range of a planktonic paralarvae of octopus species is presented for the first time. This range was dependent on the age of paralarvae, and so rendered the paralarvae more vunerable to a combination of high temperature and food deprivation during first days of life. Results in the present study provide evidence that O. mimus could be under ecological pressure if a climate change causes increased or decreased temperatures into their distribution range.

article,Effect of photoperiod and temperature on indicators of immunity and wellbeing of endangered golden mahseer (<i>Tor putitora</i>) broodstock,"Akhtar, M. S. and Rajesh, M. and Kamalam, B. S. and Ciji, A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Recently, we reported the possibility of successfully inducing captive maturation and spawning in golden mahseer through photothermal manipulation. Subsequently, we felt that it was imperative to understand the impact of these environmental manipulations on immunity, stress response, antioxidant potential, and general well-being of adult mahseer to develop a healthy broodstock. For this purpose, two experiments were carried out with changes in photoperiod (experiment I) and temperature (experiment II). In experiment I, random groups of adult female and male Tor putitora were subjected to three photoperiods (8L:16D, 12L:12D and 16L:8D) for 100 days. Decreasing levels of plasma melatonin with increasing photoperiod confirmed the physiological significance of different light-dark conditions in mahseer brooders. In terms of stress, plasma cortisol levels showed a linear increase with decreasing light duration in both males and females. Similarly, the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances was also significantly higher in males kept at 8L:16D. Plasma concentration of total immunoglobulins was found reduced in female brooders at 8L:16D, but this was not evident in males. In females, total antioxidants were found significantly elevated at 12L:12D. On the contrary, superoxide dismutase activity was lower at 12L:12D in females. The photoperiod has substantially influenced the plasma total protein and albumin levels in males. In experiment II, random groups of adult T. putitora were reared at ambient (21.2 +/- 1.4 degrees C) or elevated temperature (23.7 +/- 1.3 degrees C) groups for 121 days. The higher temperature was found to significantly decrease lysozyme, myeloperoxidase, and anti-protease activities in female mahseer brooders. However, total immunoglobulin levels were reduced significantly at elevated temperature both in males and females. No other temperature-related significant changes were observed in antioxidant potential, anti-oxidative enzymes or well-being related indices.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102694,93,NA,NA,102694,Tor putitora; Photoperiod; Temperature; Stress; Immunity; Antioxidant potential
article,Body temperature and time of day both affect nocturnal lizard performance: An experimental investigation,"Dayananda, Buddhi and Jeffree, Ross A. and Webb, Jonathan K.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The locomotor performance of reptiles is profoundly influenced by temperature, but little is known about how the time of day when the animal is usually active may influence performance. Time of day may be particularly relevant for studies on nocturnal reptiles that thermoregulate by day, but are active at night when ambient temperatures are cooler. If selection favours individuals that match their performance to activity times, then nocturnal species should perform better during the night, when they are normally active, than during the day. To test this hypothesis, we investigated how the time of day and body temperature affected the locomotor performance of adult females of the velvet gecko (Amalosia lesueurii). We measured the sprint speeds, running speeds and number of stops of 43 adult females at four different body temperatures (20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C) during the day and at night. At night, sprint speeds were higher at 20 and 35 degrees C but sprint speeds were similar at 25 and 30 degrees C. By day, sprint speed increased with body temperature, peaking at 30 degrees C, before declining at 35 degrees C. However, gecko speeds over 1 m was higher at night at all four test temperatures than by day. Number of stops showed broadly similar patterns and females stopped almost twice as often on the racetrack during the day than they did at night. Furthermore, the thermal breadth of performance differed depending on when geckos were tested. Our results demonstrate that both body temperature and the time of day affects the behaviour and locomotor performance of female velvet geckos, with geckos running faster at night, the time of day when they are usually active. This study adds to evidence that both body temperature and the time of day are crucial for estimating the performance of ectotherms and evaluations and predictions of their vulnerability to climate warming should consider the context of laboratory experimental design.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102728,93,NA,NA,102728,Ectotherms; Thermoregulation; Reptile; Climate warming; Thermal performance

Several studies show that low doses of this neurotoxin influence honey bee physiology, however, little is known about how insecticides interact with other environmental variables. We studied the effects of two neonicotinoid Imidacloprid doses (IMD, 0, 2.5, and 10 ppb), and three temperatures (20, 28, and 36 degrees C) on gene expression in the brains of worker honey bees (Apis mellifera). Using qRT-PCR we quantified the expression of eight key genes related to the nervous system, stress response, and motor and olfactory capacities. Gene expression tended to increase with the low IMD dose, which was further intensified in individuals maintained in the cold treatment (20 degrees C). At 20 degrees C the octopamine receptor gene (oa1) was underexpressed in bees that were not exposed to IMD, but overexpressed in individuals exposed to 2.5 ppb IMD. Also, heat shock proteins (hsp70 and hsp90) increased their expression at high temperatures (36 degrees C), but not with IMD doses. These results suggest that despite the low insecticide concentrations used in this study (a field-realistic dose), changes in gene expression associated with honey bee physiological responses could be induced. This study contributes to the understanding of how neonicotinoid residual doses may alter honey bee physiology.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102696,93,NA,NA,102696,Honey bee; Residual doses; Neonicotinoid; Imidacloprid; Temperature; Gene expression
article,Paper wasps are darker at high elevation,"de Souza, Andre R. and Mayorquin, Angie Z. and Sarmiento, Carlos E.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"High mountains are harsh environments in which colder temperatures and higher levels of UV-B radiation are common. These abiotic conditions strongly affect animals' biology, often constraining their survival and reproduction. As a result, adaptations to live in such habitats are expected to evolve. Body color is thought to be adaptive to the environment that animals experience. Tegument melanization improves heat gain and provides photoprotection. Therefore, at high elevation, ectotherms are expected to be darker (well-melanized). We test this prediction in the paper wasp Agelaia pallipes (Hymenoptera: Vespidae), a species distributed across an elevational gradient in the Colombian Andes. We used Malaise traps and sampled a total of 146 wasps along nine elevations, ranging from 2,600-3,380 m above sea level. Standard digital photography was used to measure the body luminance and colour patterning in different body parts of dry-preserved specimens. There was striking variation in body luminance (darker and lighter), color patterning (patched, smoothed, homogeneous) and surface texture (shiny and matte), but the kind and degree of variation depended on the body part examined. Wasps from higher elevations had darker thoraces, confirming our prediction. Besides, at high elevation, the frequency of wasps with a matte rather than a shiny face strongly increased. Overall, our findings support the thermal melanism hypothesis and suggest that intraspecific color variation might be an adaptation to the environment of paper wasps.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102535,89,NA,NA,102535,High mountain; Intraspecific colour variation; Thermal melanism; UV-B radiation; Thermoregulation
article,Responses of intestinal morphology and function in offspring to heat stress in primiparous sows during late gestation,"Guo, Huiduo and He, Jianwen and Yang, Xiaojing and Zheng, Weijiang and Yao, Wen",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Late gestation is a key period for intestinal development. Maternal heat exposure may induce intestinal dysfunction of offspring. To investigate the responses of intestinal morphology and function of offspring to the maternal heat stress (HS), twelve first-parity Landrace x Large White sows were assigned to thermoneutral (TN) (18-22 degrees C; n = 6) or HS (28-32 degrees C; n = 6) treatment groups at 85 d of gestation until natural farrowing. Twenty-four newborn piglets (two piglets at medium body weight from each litter) were randomly selected and divided into in utero thermoneutral (IUTN, n = 12) and heat-stressed (IUHS, n = 12) groups according to the sow's treatment. Blood and intestinal samples were harvested to evaluate stress hormone levels, intestinal morphology, integrity and barrier function in the newborn piglets. Our results showed that maternal HS piglets exhibited increased serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) concentration compared with that observed in the IUTN group. IUHS piglets showed lower lactase activities in the jejunum and ileum, whereas no significant differences were found between the two groups in the length of intestine, villus length or crypt depth. Serum diamine oxidase (DAO) activity was increased in IUHS piglets. IUHS piglets also exhibited decreased ZO-1, ZO-2 and MUC2 mRNA expression in the jejunum, while the protein levels were not affected. Additionally, IUHS piglets had a lower apoptotic percentage and FAS mRNA expression in the jejunum than those in the IUTN group. Taken together, these results demonstrate that high ambient temperature during late gestation of primiparous sows causes stress response in neonatal piglets, compromising intestinal permeability and mucosal barrier function, which may be partly mediated by inducing intestinal apoptosis.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102539,89,NA,NA,102539,Heat stress; Late gestation; Intestinal development; Intestinal barrier function; Newborn piglets

A green synthesis method was employed for the synthesis of SeNPs using fish gills, which are normally discarded as by-products. Four isocaloric and iso-nitrogenous experimental diets were used, namely, a control diet (Se-NPs and RF @ 0 mg/kg diet) and diets containing RF @ 5, 10 or 15 mg/kg diet and Se-NPs @ 0.5 mg/kg diet, and feeding was performed for 95 days. At the end of the feeding trial, the thermal tolerance was evaluated by determination of the following parameters: critical thermal minimum (CTMin), lethal thermal minimum (LTMin), critical thermal maximum (CTMax), and lethal thermal maximum (LTMax). The anti-oxidative status in the form of catalase (CAT), glutathione-s-transferase (GST) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities was significantly (p < 0.01) enhanced upon concurrent exposure to arsenic and high temperature at LTMin and LTMax, whereas a non-significant (p > 0.05) change in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was observed in the brain at LTMin and brain, gill and kidney at LTMax.

Thirty bulls (n = 15 ANG; n = 15 SIM), extremes ``more adapted{''} and ``less adapted{'' within each breed were selected to the heat tolerance test. They were selected according to an index based on the average of the respiratory rate obtained on two hot summer days from one hundred bulls. Before the heat tolerance test day, animals were taken to a paddock with water, grass and shade until 7 a.m. of the following day for morning measurements.

Respiratory rate in the morning (MRR) and afternoon (ARR), hair coat surface temperature in the morning (MST) and afternoon (AST), rectal temperature in the morning (MRT) and afternoon (ART) were measured and blood samples were collected for expression analysis of the HSF1 and HSPA6 genes. The MIXED procedure of SAS was used for all statistical analysis. The more adapted Simmental group had lesser values of MRR (P = 0.023) and MRT (P = 0.095), but there was no difference within Angus breed.

article,"Effect of heat exposure and physical exercise until exhaustion in normothermic and hyperthermic conditions on serum, sweat and urinary concentrations of magnesium and phosphorus","Siquier-Coll, J. and Bartlome, I and Perez-Quintero, M. and Grijota, F. J. and Munoz, D. and Maynar-Marino, M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Aim: The aim of this survey was to ascertain the difference in the levels of Magnesium (Mg) and Phosphorus (P) after an exercise test in normothermia and hyperthermia before and after heat acclimation in comparison to their respective pre-test values. Methods: Twenty-nine male university students were divided into an Experimental Group (EG) (n = 15) and a Control Group (CG) (n = 14). All of them voluntarily participated in this investigation. Both groups performed an incremental test until exhaustion on a cycloergometer in normothermia (22 degrees C) and hyperthermia (42 degrees C). EG underwent 9 sessions of heat acclimation (100 degrees C) in a sauna (Harvia C105S Logix Combi Control; 3-15 W; Finland). Once the experimental period was completed, all initial measurements were carried out again under identical conditions. Urine and blood samples were obtained before and after each trial. Sweat samples were collected at the end of every test performed in hyperthermia. The samples were frozen at -80 degrees C until further analysis by ICP-MS. Results: Lower seric Mg levels were observed in both groups at the end of pre-acclimation tests. After acclimation, only EG experimented a decrease of Mg in serum after testing (p < .01). The urinary excretion was unaffected in the pre-acclimated period, but EG experimented an increase in Mg after trials in the post-acclimation evaluation (p < .01). Mg sweat loss decreased significantly after heat acclimation (p < .05). P did not undergo changes, except in its urinary excretion, which was elevated after the normothermia trial in the post-acclimation period (p < .05). Conclusions: It seems that exercise in hyperthermia altered Mg status but not P homeostasis. Additionally, heat acclimation reduces Mg losses in sweat while increasing its loss in urine. Thus, Mg supplementation should be considered in unacclimated and acclimated subjects if physical exercise is going to be performed in hyperthermic conditions.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.010,84,NA,176-184,NA,Magnesium; Phosphorus; Urine; Serum; Sweat; Heat acclimation

The aims of this study were to investigate the electrophysiological properties of temperature-sensitive and -insensitive neurons in brain slices, and elucidate the basic mechanisms underlying the thermosensitivity of rat LPB neurons. In warm-sensitive neurons, temperature exerted no significant effects on resting membrane potential (RMP), threshold potential, and amplitude of the afterhyperpolarizing potential. However, warming significantly increased the prepotential rates of depolarization and the inactivation rates of potassium A current (I-A) in warm-sensitive neurons, which in turn shortened their interspike interval and elevated the firing rate. In contrast, temperature had no significant effects on the depolarizing prepotentials and inactivation rate of I-A in temperature-insensitive neurons. Besides, in cold-sensitive neurons, cooling and warming produced membrane depolarization and hyperpolarization, respectively, and there was a strong correlation between firing rate and membrane potential thermosensitivity. Nevertheless, temperature exhibited no significant effect on the depolarizing prepotential of cold-sensitive neurons. These results suggest that LPB neuronal warm sensitivity may reside in the temperature-dependent prepotentials and I-A, while neuronal cold sensitivity might be mainly due to heat-induced changes in RMP.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.05.020,83,NA,87-94,NA,Lateral parabrachial nucleus; Neuronal thermosensitivity; Depolarizing prepotential; Resting membrane potential; Potassium a current

The effect of coat color in pluriparous contemporary Holstein cows in a hot environment (mean annual temperature 24.6 degrees C), on body surface temperature (infrared thermography), physiological and hematological variables as well as milk yield and reproductive performance was assessed using 178 Holstein pluriparous cows (74 predominantly white and 104 predominantly black). Data were collected in the morning and afternoon in July (mean temperature-humidity index 82 units). Body condition score at mid-lactation (128 +/- 32 days in milk at the start of the experiment) was higher (P < 0.01) in predominantly white than in black cows (3.3 vs. 3.2). Respiration rate did not differ between groups (72 +/- 23 vs. 73 +/- 20 breaths/min for white and black cows, respectively, sampling time combined). In contrast, rectal temperature of black cows was 0.1 degrees C higher (P <= 0.01) than white cows, regardless of sampling time. The only significant hematologic change was a slight increase in mean corpuscular volume in black cows (54.7 fL, P < 0.01) compared to white cows (53.8 fL), but it remained within the reference range. Differences due to coat color did not alter body surface temperatures at any time of the day. Conception rates, services per conception, calving intervals and fetal losses were not associated with hair coat color, but cows with predominantly white coat produced 394 kg more (P < 0.01) fat-corrected milk in 305 days compared to cows with predominantly black coat.

article,Numerical analysis of an enhanced cooling rate cryopreservation process in a biological tissue,"Sukumar, S. and Kar, S. P.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Cryopreservation is the method of preservation of biological tissues for future references without causing significant damages to their physical and functional properties. This can be done by exposing them to very low cryogenic temperature that involves a greater heat removal rate. A two dimensional numerical model is developed to study the temperature distribution, cooling rate attained and movement of the freezing front during the cryopreservation process. The Pennes Bio-heat model is used for current study. The Finite Volume Method is employed for discretization of the governing differential equations while the Tri-Diagonal Matrix Algorithm is used to solve the discretized algebraic equations to find temperature distribution inside the domain. The Enthalpy-Porosity method is used to track the solid-liquid interfaces during the freezing process. The current model is first validated with the result of the existing literature. In the present work, freezing of tissue is done from one and two sides in two separate cases and the resulting temperature distribution inside the tissue and cooling rate in the two cases are compared. It is found that the freezing rate of tissue is enhanced about two times when it is freezed from two sides as compared to freezing from single side. Further, it is observed that a lower value of blood perfusion rate causes a lower value of the final temperature of the tissue after freezing. Thus, it can be concluded that the tissue with high blood perfusion rate is to be freezed in a lower cooling medium temperature. In the present condition, metabolic heat generation plays no significant role in the temperature distribution inside the healthy tissue.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.03.001,81,NA,146-153,NA,Cryopreservation; Finite Volume Method; Tri-Diagonal Matrix Algorithm; Enthalpy-Porosity Method; Pennes Bio-heat model

Reducing the stress response or enhancing anti-stress capability is an important goal in animal production. Our previous study indicated a protective role of flavangenol, a pine bark extract, in chicks after three hours of high temperature exposure. However, the cellular mechanism of flavangenol was not clarified ex vivo. In the current study, we investigated the effect of flavangenol on cellular apoptosis and oxidation in heat-stressed treated chick brain cells (mixed neurons and glia cells). The primary brain cells were isolated from the diencephalon of 14-day-old chicks and cultured at 41.5 degrees C (to mimic the body temperature of young chicks), and were treated with flavangenol from day 3 of isolation to day 8. Cells were kept bathed in the cell culture dish under a high temperature (HT: 45 degrees C, 20 or 60 min) on day 8 and were then collected for analysis of cell viability as well as for HSP and other related gene expression. Flavangenol treatment significantly increased cell viability and BCL-2 mRNA expression, and attenuated HSP-70 and BCL-2-associated X protein mRNA expression. Moreover, flavangenol treatment elevated the mRNA expression of glutathione peroxidase in the HT group, which indicates that cellular anti-oxidative ability was strengthened by flavangenol.

In several countries around the world,arming of Atlantic salmon (Salmo solar) occurs towards the upper end of the thermal tolerance window for this species, and marked effects on salmon production during summers have been experienced but never empirically investigated. This project tracked the effects of an extreme summer heatwave on two different cohorts of fish stocked into farm cages either during early winter (EW) or late winter (LW). The farm site experienced an unprecedented high water temperature event, with a peak water temperature of 22.9 degrees C and 117 days above 18 degrees C. Fish in both EW and LW cohorts experienced a temperature-induced cessation of voluntary feed intake as well as inefficient osmoregulatory, liver and renal function during high temperature periods. Flesh colour declined primarily in the dorsal and ventral regions of the fillet and secondarily along the midline, with over 20\% of fish demonstrated a complete loss of flesh colour during the months of March and April. A return to feeding in autumn occurred faster in some fish and caused a marked bimodal size distribution to appear within both the EW and LW cohorts as autumn progressed. However, the LW cohort returned to feeding at seawater temperatures of 20.2 degrees C, compared with 18.6 degrees C for the EW cohort. There was a strong positive relationship between fillet colour recovery and residual condition index (RCI). These findings identified alkaline phosphatase as a potential marker to non-destructively track individual fish for signs of recovery after a thermal stress event, and shed light on the physiological consequences of marine heatwaves on fishes. This study also identified that supporting feed intake or promoting a return to feeding may help mitigate the negative impacts of climate warming on cultured Atlantic salmon.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.12.021,80,NA,64-74,NA,Temperature; Relative Condition Index; Predicting performance; Astaxanthin; Thermal stress; Aquaculture
article,Thermoregulation in rapid growing broiler chickens is compromised by constraints on radiative and convective cooling performance,"Tickle, Peter G. and Codd, Jonathan R.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Broiler chickens are selected to undergo a rapid six-week hatch-to-slaughter growth phase to attain large body and muscle mass. Broilers have relatively high resting and locomotor metabolic costs suggesting that adaptive thermoregulatory mechanisms are required to dissipate excess heat. Using thermal imaging in the growing broiler we characterised the trajectory of radiative and convective cooling in still air across broiler development. Scaling of head, tarsus and toe surface area did not deviate from body mass(2/3) while torso area increased with positive allometry, body mass(0.82), reflecting increased feather coverage and/or disproportionate abdominal/thoracic growth. Despite relatively increased area, the body became less effective for heat transfer presumably due to increasing feather coverage. Conversely, the magnitude of heat exchange from the distal hindlimbs was. improved in larger birds. Overall capacity to transfer heat by convection and radiation in still air was attenuated over development, since the proportion of resting metabolic rate accounted for decreased in standing and sitting postures. This physiological constraint could be ameliorated by increased latent heat transfer or provision of environmental ventilation, which we modelled according to industrial guidelines. Based on models, higher airspeeds coincided with improved convective cooling that assisted in maintaining the proportion of RMR accounted for by convective and radiative heat transfer. These data highlight the potentially adverse thermoregulatory effects of rapid growth rate and body mass increases, which may contribute to the increased sedentary resting and decreased locomotor behaviour observed in large broilers.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.11.007,79,NA,8-14,NA,Broiler; Development; Thermoregulation; Air velocity; Thermal imaging
article,Effect of chronic low body temperature on feeding and gut passage in a plethodontid salamander,"Marvin, Glenn A. and Bryan, Richard and Hardwick, James",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Although feeding in some plethodontid salamander species, such as Dusky Salamanders (Desmognathus, family Plethodontidae), occurs at short-term (acute) low temperature below 5 degrees C, it is unknown whether feeding, digestion, and gut passage continue to occur during periods of long-term (chronic) low temperature. We performed a controlled laboratory experiment to examine the effect of several chronic low environmental temperatures on both feeding and gut passage in semiaquatic Spotted Dusky Salamanders (D. conanti). We quantified salamander feeding and defecation for different experimental groups maintained for many weeks at a constant temperature of 4, 7, 10, or 13 degrees C. Although feeding frequency, number of prey items consumed per feeding, and defecation frequency were significantly less for individuals at 4 degrees C than for individuals at 10 or 13 degrees C, salamanders continued to feed, defecate, and maintain body mass for 12 weeks at 4 degrees C. The ratio of the number of fecal pellets produced to the number of prey items consumed each week by individuals did not significantly decrease at 4 degrees C, which indicates gut passage was sustained at this temperature. Because both time between feeding and time between defecation were similarly affected by prolonged low temperature, the significant decrease in feeding frequency at 4 degrees C may depend, in part, on a decrease in digestive function and an extended time for gut passage at low temperature. We conclude that most individuals of D. conanti can feed, digest, and maintain body mass for several months at constant low temperature down to 4 degrees C. Our results support a growing body of data that indicate some plethodontid salamanders may acquire energy at environmental temperatures only a few degrees above freezing.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.09.003,69,NA,319-324,NA,Defecation; Digestion; Energetics; Feeding; Salamander; Temperature
article,Monitoring changes in body surface temperature associated with treadmill exercise in dogs by use of infrared methodology,"Rizzo, Maria and Arfuso, Francesca and Alberghina, Daniela and Giudice, Elisabetta and Gianesella, Matteo and Piccione, Giuseppe",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of moderate treadmill exercise session on body surface and core temperature in dog measured by means of two infrared instruments. Ten Jack Russell Terrier/Miniature Pinscher mixed-breed dogs were subjected to 15 min of walking, 10 min of trotting and 10 min of gallop. At every step, body surface temperature (T-surface) was measured on seven regions (neck, shoulder, ribs, flank, back, internal thigh and eye) using two different methods, a digital infrared camera (ThermaCam P25) and a non contact infrared thermometer (Infrared Thermometer THM010-VT001). Rectal temperature (T-rectal) and blood samples were collected before (T0) and after exercise (T3). Blood samples were tested for red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin concentration (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct). A significant effect of exercise in all body surface regions was found, as measured by both infrared methods. The temperature obtained in the eye and the thigh area were higher with respect to the other studied regions throughout the experimental period (P < 0.0001). RBC, Hb, Hct and T-rectal values were higher at T3 (P < 0.05). Statistically significant higher temperature values measured by infrared thermometer was found in neck, shoulder, ribs, flank, back regions respect to the values obtained by digital infrared camera (P < 0.0001). The results obtained in this study showed that both internal and surface temperatures are influenced by physical exercise probably due to muscle activity and changes in blood flow in dogs. Both infrared instruments used in this study have proven to be useful in detecting surface temperature variations of specific body regions, however factors including type and color of animal hair coat must be taken into account in the interpretation of data obtained by thermography methodology.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.06.007,69,NA,64-68,NA,Dog; Exercise; Infrared thermography; Infrared thermometry; Body surface temperature
article,"Hypothermal effects on survival, energy homeostasis and expression of energy-related genes of swimming crabs <i>Portunus trituberculatus</i> during air exposure","Lu, Yunliang and Zhang, Dan and Wang, Fang and Dong, Shuanglin",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Previously, dry or semi-dry approach under the hypothermal condition is proved to be an alternative method in transport of live swimming crabs Portunus trituberculatus. However, we wondered whether this method can improve crab survival when temperature is kept as cool as possible. In this study, we hypothesized that there is a thermal threshold below which dry or semi-dry approach (air exposure) could cause crab physiological disruption and therefore aggravate their mortality. To test the above hypothesis, crabs (23 degrees C) were exposed to air at temperatures ranging from 4 to 16 degrees C. Results showed that crabs had a worse survival and vigor at temperatures below 12 degrees C. Then we tested crab energy metabolism to explore the possible reason. It was shown that total adenine nucleotide and adenylate energy charge in gills were remarkably reduced by air exposure of below 12 degrees C. This increased the need for crabs to re-balance energy metabolism, which was indicated by the upregulation of AMPK alpha and HIP-1 alpha. Meanwhile, there was a significant increase of the expression of Na+/K+-ATPase, V-type ATPase and HSP90 at temperatures below 12 degrees C, while all treatments shared a similar level of hemocyanin, urate and lactate in hemolymph and expression of cytochrome c oxidase and NADH-ubiquinone reductase in gills. These results implied that dry or semi-dry approach below 12 degrees C could exert detrimental effects on P. trituberculatus, and perturbation of energy homeostasis, which is more related with changes of energy demanding physiological pathways, is a possible reason of crab death and poor vigor.

article,"Density regulation in toad populations (<i>Epidalea calamita</i>, <i>Bufotes viridis</i>) by differential winter survival of juveniles","Sinsch, Ulrich and Schaefer, Alena M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The size of amphibian populations varies considerably between years, so that systematic trends in dynamics are difficult to detect. Informed conservation management of presumably declining populations requires the identification of the most sensitive life stage. In temperate-zone anurans there is growing evidence that juveniles hibernating for the first time suffer from substantial winter losses. In two syntopic toads (Epidalea calamita, Bufotes viridis) we monitored survival of such juveniles during four consecutive winters in the natural habitat and in four temperature treatments (3 degrees, 5 degrees C, 10/15 degrees C or 20 degrees C, natural light-dark cycle) in temperature-controlled chambers during winter. Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that (1) winter mortality of juvenile toads which hibernate for the first time in their life is an important component of population dynamics, and that (2) mortality rates differed between the two species. Parameters quantified were size-dependent winter mortality and body condition of pre- and post-hibernating juveniles. Field data provided evidence for the important role of winter mortality of first-hibernators in population dynamics. Choice of hibernacula differed in E. calamita between small and medium-sized individuals and also between the two species suggesting distinct mortality risks. The inability of small E. calamita to reach frost-proof hibernacula by burrowing, and the exposure of small B. viridis to predators are the most probable causes of size-assortative winter mortality. In conclusion, E. calamita juveniles may benefit from rising average winter temperatures in the future by decreased risk of freezing to death, whereas predator-caused winter mortality of B. viridis juveniles will also depend on the effects of climate warming on predator phenology.

article,A novel personal cooling system (PCS) incorporated with phase change materials (PCMs) and ventilation fans: An investigation on its cooling efficiency,"Lu, Yehu and Wei, Fanru and Lai, Dandan and Shi, Wen and Wang, Faming and Gao, Chuansi and Song, Guowen",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Personal cooling systems (PCS) have been developed to mitigate the impact of severe heat stress for humans working in hot environments. It is still a great challenge to develop PCSs that are portable, inexpensive, and effective. We studied the performance of a new hybrid PCS incorporating both ventilation fans and phase change materials (PCMs). The cooling efficiency of the newly developed PCS was investigated on a sweating manikin in two hot conditions: hot humid (HH, 34 degrees C, 75\% RH) and hot dry (HD, 34 degrees C, 28\% RH). Four test scenarios were selected: fans off with no PCMs (i.e., Fan-off, the CONTROL), fans on with no PCMs (i.e., Fan-on), fans off with fully solidified PCMs (i.e., PCM+Fan-off), and fans on with fully solidified PCMs (i.e., PCM+Fan-on). It was found that the addition of PCMs provided a 54 similar to 78 min cooling in HH condition. In contrast, the PCMs only offered a 19-39 min cooling in HD condition. In both conditions, the ventilation fans greatly enhanced the evaporative heat loss compared with Fan-off. The hybrid PCS (i.e., PCM+Fan-on) provided a continuous cooling effect during the three-hour test and the average cooling rate for the whole body was around 111 and 315 W in HH and HD conditions, respectively. Overall, the new hybrid PCS may be an effective means of ameliorating symptoms of heat stress in both hot-humid and hot-dry environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

article,The effect of using different regions of interest on local and mean skin temperature,"Maniar, Nirav and Bach, Aaron J. E. and Stewart, Ian B. and Costello, Joseph T.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The dynamic nature of tissue temperature and the subcutaneous properties, such as blood flow, fatness, and metabolic rate, leads to variation in local skin temperature. Therefore, we investigated the effects of using multiple regions of interest when calculating weighted mean skin temperature from four local sites. Twenty-six healthy males completed a single trial in a thermonetural laboratory (mean +/- SD): 24.0 (1.2)degrees C; 56(8\%) relative humidity; <0.1 m/s air speed). Mean skin temperature was calculated from four local sites (neck, scapula, hand and shin) in accordance with International Standards using digital infrared thermography. A 50 mm x 50 mm, defined by strips of aluminium tape, created six unique regions of interest, top left quadrant, top right quadrant, bottom left quadrant, bottom right quadrant, centre quadrant and the entire region of interest, at each of the local sites. The largest potential error in weighted mean skin temperature was calculated using a combination of a) the coolest and b) the warmest regions of interest at each of the local sites. Significant differences between the six regions interest were observed at the neck (P<0.01), scapula (P<0.001) and shin (P<0.05); but not at the hand (P=0.482). The largest difference (+/- SEM) at each site was as follows: neck 0.2 (0.1)degrees C; scapula 0.2 (0.0)degrees C; shin 0.1 (0.0)degrees C and hand 0.1 (0.1)degrees C. The largest potential error (mean +/- SD) in weighted mean skin temperature was 0.4 (0.1)degrees C (P<0.001) and the associated 95\% limits of agreement for these differences was 0.2-0.5 degrees C. Although we observed differences in local and mean skin temperature based on the region of interest employed, these differences were minimal and are not considered physiologically me aningful.

article,Stage of pregnancy dictates heterothermy in temperate forest-dwelling bats,"Otto, Matthias S. and Becker, Nina I. and Encarnacao, Jorge A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Bats face high energetic requirements, as powered flight is costly and they have a disadvantageous surface-to-volume-ratio. To deal with those requirements energy saving mechanisms, such as heterothermy (torpor), have evolved. Torpor during pregnancy, however, reduces rates of foetal development and consequently prolongs pregnancy. Therefore, heterothermy has a great effect on reproduction, as an unhindered parturition can only be assured by high body temperatures. Regardless of these adverse affects of torpor the energetic requirements of bats during reproduction urge for energy savings and bats are known to enter torpor during pregnancy. The species in the current study differ in their torpor patterns and thus their heterothermic strategy. However, we hypothesized, that species-specific heterothermic behaviour should be revoked at the end of pregnancy. We analyzed skin temperatures of Myotis bechsteinii, Myotis nattereri and Plecotus auritus during pregnancy and found no differences in torpor depth between species during the last phase of pregnancy. Furthermore, we could show that individuals entered torpor frequently during pregnancy and only minimized torpor during the last stage of pregnancy. This suggests that close to the end of pregnancy, heterothermy is restricted but not species-specific and the required energy is allocated otherwise. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

article,The Rufous Hornero (<i>Furnarius rufus</i>) nest as an incubation chamber,"Shibuya, Felipe L. S. and Braga, Talita V. and Roper, James J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Foraging and incubation are mutually exclusive activities for parent birds. A trade-off is generated when a combination of food availability and temperature regulation force birds to choose one and neglect the other, at least temporarily. The Rufous Hornero builds large, oven-like, mud nests, the evolutionary cause of which remains unknown. We tested that temperature variation inside the nest is that which is expected if one function of the nest were for temperate regulation. If so, this would suggest that the nest works as an incubation chamber (but which now may serve more than one function). We divided nests into two natural treatments: nests that received more continuous direct sunshine (sun), and those that received less direct sunshine, due to shade from trees or buildings (shade). Thermometer data loggers were placed in the nest cavity and outside, in the shade of the nest, and temperature was measured every 10 min. We predicted that temperatures would consistently be higher and less variable in nests than outside nests. Also, at higher ambient temperatures the nest would function better as an incubation chamber as a consequence of having evolved in a hotter climate. Thus, in Curitiba, where temperatures are lower than where the species (and nest) evolved, nests in greater sunshine should have thermal characteristics that support the incubation chamber hypothesis. Predictions were supported: with Repeated Measures ANOVA and t-tests, we found that temperatures were more constant and higher in nests, especially when in the sun, and as the season progressed (hotter ambient temperatures). We conclude that the large mud nest of the Rufous Hornero works as an incubation chamber that likely evolved to help resolve the incubation-foraging trade-off in the very seasonal and hot regions where the bird evolved. Thus, as an incubation chamber, the nest allows the bird to forage rather than incubate thereby resolving the foraging-incubation trade-off and potentially favoring survival of the adults and their foraging for, rather than incubating, their young. Counter intuitively, in the study area, where the Rufous Hornero is a recent arrival following deforestation, and where the climate is very different from where it evolved, there seems to be no clear thermal benefits for the birds from their energetically expensive mud nest.

article,Effect of thermal stress on HSP70 expression in dermal fibroblast of zebu (Tharparkar) and crossbred (Karan-Fries) cattle,"Singh, A. K. and Upadhyay, R. C. and Malakar, A. and Kumar, Sudarshan and Singh, S. V.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The present studies were conducted to investigate the difference response of dermal fibroblasts to heat stress in Tharparkar and Karan-Fries cattle. Skin is the most important environmental interface providing a protective envelope to animals. In skin, dermal fibroblasts are the most regular cell constituent of dermis that is crucial for temperature homeostasis. The study aimed to examine the reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, cytotoxicity (\%) and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) genes expression in dermal fibroblast of Tharparkar and Karan-Fries cattle and to assess whether resistance of dermal fibroblast to heat stress is breed specific. Dermal fibroblasts from ear pinna of Tharparkar and Karan-Fries cattle were exposed at 25 degrees C, 37 degrees C, 40 degrees C and 44 degrees C for 3 h to measure the ROS, cytotoxicity (\%) and HSP 70 (HSPA1A, HSPA2 and HSPA8) genes' expression. The results showed that ROS formation at low temperature (25 degrees C) decreased in both breeds as compared to control (37 degrees C) and the differences were significant (P < 0.0001). Heat stress at 40 degrees C did not increase ROS formation significantly in Tharparkar but increased significantly (P < 0.001) in Karan-Fries cattle. The overall cytotoxicity (\%) was also found to be significantly different (P < 0.001) between Tharparkar and Karan-Fries cattle, and on exposure to different temperatures (P < 0.001). The cytotoxicity (\%) in dermal fibroblast cells of Karan-fries cows was more than Tharparkar. The expression studies indicated that all HSP70 genes (HSPA8, HSPA1A and HSPA2) were up-regulated at different temperatures in both breeds. In Tharparkar, the relative mRNA expression of HSPA8 gene was higher but HSPA1A and HSPA2 genes were low as compared to Karan-Fries cattle. At 40 and 44 degrees C, the relative expressions of inducible HSP 70 genes (HSPA1A and HSPA2) were higher in Karan-Fries than Tharparkar. In summary, dermal fibroblast resistance to heat shock differed between breeds. Dermal fibroblasts of Tharparkar were observed to be more heat tolerant than crossbred Karan-Fries cattle. The study concludes that zebu cattle (Tharparkar) dermal fibroblasts are more adapted to tropical climatic condition than crossbreed cattle (Karan-Fries). Differences exist in dermal fibroblasts of heat adapted and non-adapted cattle. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Effects of temperature and modified atmospheres on diapausing 5th instar codling moth metabolism,"Neven, Lisa G. and Lehrman, Nathan J. and Hansen, Lee D.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The oxygen and Capacity limitation of thermal tolerance (OCLTT) has been established in aquatic insect larvae, but OCLTT has not been shown to generally apply to terrestrial insects. Previous research indicates that heat treatments in Combination with high Concentrations of Carbon dioxide and low Concentrations of oxygen may be effective for Controlling diapausing Codling moth, a quarantine pest in walnuts, but treatment requires long times and the killing mechanism is unknown. In this study, the effects of temperature and modified atmospheres on metabolism in diapausing 5th instar Codling moth (Cydia pomonella) was investigated with multi-channel differential scanning Calorimeters, one equipped with an oxygen sensor. O-2 Consumption and metabolic heat rates in air were measured simultaneously at isothermal temperatures from 5 to 50 degrees C at 5 degrees C intervals. Both rates increased with increasing temperatures from 5 to 40 degrees C. The ratio of metabolic heat rate to O-2 Consumption rate at temperatures <= 40 degrees C shows that a portion of the metabolic heat is from normal anabolic reactions of metabolism. At 45 and 50 degrees C in air, O-2 Consumption and metabolic heat rates dropped to near zero. These results indicate that treatment of walnuts in air at >45 degrees C for a short period of time (minutes) is effective in killing diapausing 5th instar Codling moth larvae.degrees Continuous heating scans at 0.4 degrees C/min were used to measure metabolic heat rates from 10 to 50 degrees C with air and modified atmospheres with lowered oxygen and high degrees Carbon dioxide. A rapid increase was observed in heat rates above 40 degrees C in scans with 02 >= 11\%. Taken together with the isothermal results showing no metabolic heat production or oxygen uptake at 45 and 50 degrees C, these results demonstrate that thermal damage to Cell membranes and loss of Control of oxidation reactions is the lethal mechanism at high temperature when O-2 >= 11\%. The data from scans with 02 <= 2\% and high CO2 show the effects of oxygen limitation as postulated by the OCLTT. However,CO2 anesthesia appears to protect larvae from oxygen limitation at high temperature. These results show that treatment of walnuts in air at temperatures >45 degrees C will rapidly kill diapausing 5th instar Codling moths.

article,Daily and annual patterns of thermoregulation in painted turtles (<i>Chrysemys picta marginata</i>) living in a thermally variable marsh in Northern Michigan,"Rowe, John W. and Converse, Paul E. and Clark, David L.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The capacity for an ectothermic reptile to thermoregulate has implications for many components of its life history. Over two years, we studied thermoregulation in a population of Midland painted turtles (Chrysemys picta marginata) in a shallow, thermally variable wetland during summer in Northern Michigan. Mean body temperature (T-b) of free-ranging turtles was greater in 2008 (25.8 degrees C) than in 2010 (19.7 degrees C). Laboratory determined thermoregulatory set point (T-set) ranged from 25 degrees C (Tset-min) to 31 degrees C (Tset-max) and was lower during the fall (17-26 degrees C). Deviations of T-b distributions from field measured operative temperatures (T-e) and indices of thermoregulation indicated that C picta marginata were capable of a limited degree of thermoregulation. Operative temperatures and thermal quality (d(e)=vertical bar Tset-min-T-e vertical bar and vertical bar T-e - Tset-max vertical bar) cycled daily with maximal thermal quality occurring during late morning and late afternoon. The accuracy of thermoregulation (d(b)=vertical bar Tset-min-T-b vertical bar and vertical bar T-b-Tset-max vertical bar) was maximal (d(b) values were minimal) as T-b declined and traversed T-set during the late afternoon-early evening hours and was higher on cloudy days than on sunny days because relatively low T-e values decreased the number of T-b values that were above T-set. Our index of thermal exploitation (E-x = frequency of T-b observations within T-set) was 36\%, slightly lower than that reported for an Ontario population of C. picta marginata. Regression of d(b) (thermal accuracy) on d(e) (thermal quality) indicated that turtles invested more in thermoregulation when thermal quality was low and when water levels were high than when they were low. There were no intersexual differences in mean T-b throughout the year but females had relatively high laboratory determined T-b values in the fall, perhaps reflecting the importance of maintaining ovarian development prior to winter.

Temperature preference in some turtle species may be influenced by environmental conditions, including acclimation temperature. We tested for effects of acclimation temperature (22 degrees C, 27 degrees C) on the selected temperature and movement patterns of 14 juvenile Malaclemys terrapin (Reptilia: Emydidae) in an aquatic thermal gradient of 14-34 degrees C and in single-temperature (22 degrees C, 27 degrees C) control tests. Among 8-10 month old terrapins, acclimation temperature influenced activity and movement patterns but did not affect temperature selection. In thermal gradient and single-temperature control tests, turtles acclimated to 27 degrees C used more tank chambers and relocated between chambers significantly more frequently than individuals acclimated to 22 C. However, acclimation temperature did not affect temperature selection: both 22- and 27 degrees C-acclimated turtles selected the warmest temperature (34 degrees C), and avoided the other temperatures available, during thermal gradient tests. These results suggest that young M. terrapin are capable of detecting small temperature increments and prefer warm temperatures that may positively influence growth and metabolism.

The variables obtained by thermography of the body surface include the temperature of non-pigmented patches, obtained using the average of five spots on white patches in a rectangle drawn on the body of the cow from the scapula to the ilium of the cow until the middle of the ribs; the temperature of pigmented patches, obtained using an average of 5 pigmented spots on the same rectangle; the temperature at the hottest spot and the temperature at the coldest spot, within the same rectangle. Rectal temperature measures were taken by a mercury thermometer during milkings. In our findings, during the cold season, RW cows had lower temperatures on the surface of pigmented spots (p = 0.01) but did not differ from BW animals when comparing rectal temperatures (p = 0.70). During the hot season, however, RW cows had lower temperatures on white spots (p = 0.049) as well as lower rectal temperatures (p = 0.029). These results suggest that the red coat phenotype presents less absorption of solar radiation, retaining less heat.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102775,94,NA,NA,102775,Coat color; Dairy cattle; Heat stress; Surface temperature; Tropical milk production
article,"Effects of activation of skin ion channels TRPM8, TRPV1, and TRPA1 on the immune response. Comparison with effects of cold and heat exposure","Kozyreva, V, T. and Khramova, G. M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The effects of pharmacological stimulation of skin ion channels TRPA1, TRPM8, TRPV1 on the immune response are presented. These effects are compared with the effects of different types of temperature exposures - skin cooling, deep cooling, and deep heating. This analysis allows us to clear the differences in the influence on the immune response of thermosensitive ion channels localized in the skin; (2) whether the changes in the immune response under temperature exposures are due to these thermosensitive ion channels. Experiments were performed on Wistar rats. For stimulation of TRPM8 ion channel, an application to the skin of 1\% menthol was used, for TRPA1 - 0.04\% allylisotiocianate, and for TRPV1 - capsaicin in a concentration of 0.001.The antigen binding in the spleen was two-times stimulated by activation of the cold-sensitive ion channel TRPM8 and much weaker by activation of warm-sensitive TRPV1 (by 15\%), and another cold-sensitive ion channel TRPA1 (by 40\%). Only the stimulation of TRPA1 significantly (by 140\%) increased antibody formation in the spleen, while TRPM8 had practically no effect on this process, and activation of TRPV1 significantly (by 60\%) inhibited antibody formation. Stimulation of the TRPM8 ion channel significantly (by 60\%) reduced the level of IgG in the blood, which is believed to control of infectious diseases.The obtained results show that pharmacological activation of the skin TRPA1, TRPM8, TRPV1 ion channels can differently affect the immune system. At the epicenter of changes there were the antigen binding and antibody formation in the spleen, as well as the level of IgG in the blood. Exactly stimulation of the TRPM8 ion channel determines the changes in the immune response when only the skin is cooling, while at deep body heating, the changes in the immune response are mostly determined by the activation of the skin TRPV1 ion channel.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102729,93,NA,NA,102729,"TRPM8,TRPA1; TRPV1; Cooling; Heating; Immune response"

(2020) in this journal ``Infrared cameras overestimate skin temperature during rewarming from cold Exposure{''} for the evidence provided in support of its title and conclusions. Several methodological issues were identified as well as issues with the data interpretation: 1: Only one camera was used but a conclusion was made for `cameras' in general; 2: The camera accuracy (+/- 2 degrees C) is too low to do a meaningful comparison without using local reference values or an on-site calibrator with higher accuracy; 3: Thermistor measurements are taken as a gold standard while issues such as temperature gradients and taping are known; 4: Both methods are not compared at the same location and a natural, physiological, gradient may be present between their locations; 5. The impact of the sensor and tape on delays in the change of the underlying tissue temperature is not considered; 6: Only a single pixel was used for the analysis, which has been shown to be problematic. We concluded that the paper by Maley et al. does not provide conclusive evidence that infrared cameras overestimate skin temperature during rewarming from cold exposure.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102663,92,NA,NA,102663,Infrared thermography; Skin temperature measurement; Instrument validity; Measurement error
article,High temperature acclimation alters the emersion behavior in the crab Neohelice granulata,"Halal, Lamia Marques and Ayres, Bruna Soares and Lima, Tabata Martins and Maciel, Fabio Everton and Maia Nery, Luiz Eduardo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"An increase in environmental temperature can deleteriously affect organisms. This study investigated whether the semiterrestrial estuarine crab Neohelice granulata uses emersion behavior as a resource to avoid thermal stress and survive higher aquatic temperatures. We also examined whether this behavior is modulated by exposure to high temperature; whether, during the period of emersion, the animal loses heat from the carapace to the medium; and whether this behavior is altered by the temperature at which the animal has been acclimated. The lethal temperature for 50\% of the population (LT50) was determined through 96-h mortality curves in animals acclimated at 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C. The behavioral profile of N. granulata during thermal stress was based on monitoring crab movement in aerial, intermediary, and aquatic zones. Acclimation at a higher temperature and the possibility of emersion increased the thermotolerance of the crabs and the synergistic effect of acclimation temperature. The possibility of leaving the hot water further increased the resistance of these animals to thermal stress. We observed that when the crab was subjected to thermal stress conditions, it spent more time in the aerial environment, unlike under control conditions. Under the experimental conditions, it made small incursions into the aquatic environment and stayed in the aerial environment for a longer time in order to cool its body temperature. The animals acclimated at 20 degrees C and placed into water at 35 degrees C remained in the aerial zone. The animals acclimated and maintained at 30 degrees C (control) that were placed in water at 35 degrees C with the possibility of emerging into hot air transited more frequently between the aquatic and aerial zones than did the animals that were put in water at 35 degrees C with the possibility of emerging into a cooler air environment. We conclude that emergence behavior allows N. granulata to survive high temperatures and that this behavior is influenced by acclimation temperature.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102617,91,NA,NA,102617,Crustacean; Thermal limit; Thermotolerance; Thermoregulation; Air exposure

HS induced splanchnic tissue hypoxia and intestinal oxidative damage, leading to endotoxemia and systemic inflammation. The present study evaluated and compared the modulatory effects of feeding Barki male sheep (Ovis aries) on a standard concentrated diet containing 2\% or 4\% of the brown seaweed (Sargassum latifolium) followed by roughage for 40 consecutive days on the toxicity-induced by exposure to severe environmental HS (temperature-humidity index = 28.55 +/- 1.62). The present study showed that the diet containing Sargassum latifolium (especially 4\%) modulated significantly (P < 0.05-0.001) almost all changes shown in the HS-exposed sheep including the increase in the thermo-respiratory responses (skin and rectal temperatures, and respiration rate) and the resulted dyslipidemia, anemia, and systemic inflammation (blood leukocytosis, the elevation in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and the increase in serum proinflammatory cytokines and heat shock protein-70 concentrations). In addition, Sargassum latifolium improved significantly (P < 0.05-0.001) the body-weight gain, kidney functions (especially at the high dose), and blood antioxidant defense system (total antioxidant capacity, and the activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase) in the HS-exposed sheep, as well as protected the animals from oxidative tissue damage and the risk of atherosclerosis. In conclusion, feeding sheep with the diet containing 4\% of Sargassum latifolium was safe and suitable for animal nutrition, as well as efficiently alleviated the harmful effects of the environmental HS in Barki sheep through improving the animal antioxidant defense system, and regulating the thermo-respiratory and inflammatory responses.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102561,89,NA,NA,102561,Barki sheep; Brown seaweed; Heat stress toxicity; Oxidative stress; Systemic inflammation; Thermo-respiratory response
article,Analysis of global and gene-specific acetylation of histones in the liver of American bullfrog (<i>Rana catesbeiana</i>) tadpoles acclimated to low temperature,"Ishihara, Akinori and Yamauchi, Kiyoshi",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Severe environmental stressors such as low temperatures can affect gene expression by changing epigenetic states. American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) can overwinter as tadpoles, which can be active even in winter. However, the molecular mechanisms of epigenetic controls by which the tadpoles acclimate to low temperature are still unclear. In this study, we aimed to clarify the molecular mechanisms of global and gene-specific epigenetic regulations of low-temperature acclimation. We found that the global acetylation was decreased in the liver of bullfrog tadpoles acclimated to low temperature. The amounts of transcripts for two historic acetyl-transferases were higher in the liver of tadpoles acclimated to low temperature than in those acclimated to warm temperature, while we observed no significant differences in the amounts of transcripts for histone deacetylases. We also found that the amounts of transcripts and acetylated histones on the specific temperature-responsive genes scd and cyp7a1 whose transcripts were increased and decreased, respectively, in response to low temperature were positively correlated. Cellular acetyl-CoA levels were higher in the liver of tadpoles acclimated to low temperature than in those acclimated to warm temperature. These results contradicted the states of histone acetylation, suggesting that bullfrog tadpoles have different epigenetic mechanisms to modify the histones when compared with those of other organisms such as reptiles and mammals, even though the relationship between the transcript amount and the states of histone acetylation on temperature-responsive genes was similar to that of mammals.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.08.002,84,NA,488-495,NA,Acdimation; Acclimatization; Acetylation; Gene expression; Histone; Temperature
article,Central leukotrienes modulate fever tolerance to LPS in rats,"Santos, Bruna M. and Costa, Luis H. A. and Rocha, Maria J. and Branco, Luiz G. S.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Leukotrienes mediate several inflammatory events such as neutrophil chemoattraction, leukocyte adhesion, and central-release of cytokines and fever. However, there is no information available about their putative role in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) tolerance. The rational of the present study was to find out if central leukotrienes are involved in the development of LPS tolerance. Thus, we inhibited central leukotriene synthesis in tolerant rats using a pharmacological tool, i.e., a selective inhibitor of leukotriene synthesis MK-886 injected into the third ventricle (3V) of rats. Body core temperature (Tb) was measured using a datalogger placed inside the abdominal cavity. A low-dose of LPS (100 mu g/kg ip) was given for 4 consecutive days to induce LPS tolerance. At day 4, rats received a microinjection of MK-886 into the 3V immediately before LPS, whereas control groups were treated with vehicle (saline). We observed that LPS failed to induce plasma cytokines surges, increased hypothalamic PGE(2) levels and fever 3 days post LPS treatment, aptly characterizing the tolerance. When MK-886 was given to control rats treated with saline, no significant change in Tb was observed. However, a full LPS-induced fever was observed in tolerant rats pretreated with MK-886, which was associated with an enhancement in the hypothalamic PGE(2) levels, that were not accompanied by plasma cytokines (IL-1 beta, and IL-6) and PGE(2) surges. These data are consistent with the notion that central leukotrienes play a role in fever tolerance to LPS.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.015,84,NA,245-249,NA,MK-886; Fever; Prostaglandins; Hypothalamus

During intraoperative brain surgery, application of FUS can significantly increase the accuracy of thermal ablation of tumor while reducing undesirable damage to healthy brain tissue. The main objective of this study is acquiring acoustic transducer specifications to achieve optimum thermal treatment in the tumoral tissue. 2D and 3D models are constructed from patient-specific brain MRI images which consist of a malignant vascular tumor. Acoustic pressure and temperature are obtained by using homogenous Helmholtz and bio-heat transfer equations according to insignificant nonlinear effect. Besides that, thermal lesion induced by FUS is obtained by the thermal dose function. Results show the significance of blood vessels' cooling effect on the temperature profile. Moreover, correlation between temperature profile and transducer's operating parameter including power, frequency and duty cycle is obtained.

article,The effect of body posture on available habitat and activity-time in a lizard: Implications for thermal ecology studies,"Brewster, Casey L. and Beaupre, Steven J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Ectothermic animals contend with variable environmental temperature through behavioral thermoregulation, including selection of activity-times and microhabitat spaces with suitable operative temperatures. Thus, an important component to understanding the influence of temperature on animals is through the assessment of thermal constraints on time and space usage. Thermal ecologists have recognized that postural adjustments are an important part of behavioral thermoregulation. However, the impact of postural adjustments on available space and time has received little attention. We hypothesized that postural adjustments would significantly affect the thermal availability of space and time for surface activity. To test our hypothesis, we used data collected over a four-year study of the thermal ecology of Eastern Collared Lizards (Crotaphytus collaris) in Arkansas. We used a novel approach to model three distinct postures used by C. collaris, and to assess the impact of posture on available space and time. For our study species and habitat, posture had a significant impact on several indices of available space and time including: a) a 13\% increase in length of the reproductive activity season, b) a 35\% increase in the frequency distribution of habitat within active body temperature range and c) a 42\% increase in average thermal quality index. We conclude that posture can significantly impact space and time available for surface activity in species that employ it for thermoregulation. Thus, a clearer understanding of the thermal constraints on time-space usage in ectotherms requires consideration of the impact of posture on the spatiotemporal distribution of thermally suitable microhabitats.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.03.006,82,NA,10-17,NA,Behavioral thermoregulation; Crotaphytus collaris; Habitat thermal quality; Hours of restriction; Operative temperature models
article,The key local segments of human body for personalized heating and cooling,"Wang, Lijuan and Tian, Yufei and Kim, Jungsoo and Yin, Haiguo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Thermal characteristics of local body parts of a human subject are markedly different in cold or hot environments. Some body segments are known to be much more susceptible to heat loss than the others, thus strongly influencing the overall thermal sensation of a subject. If these body parts can be effectively cooled in a hot environment or warmed in a cold environment using personal environmental control systems, thermal comfort of human occupants can be achieved at the minimum cost of energy without heavily relying on centralized heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. With an objective to understand the influence of local thermal sensation on the subjects' overall thermal comfort perception, experiments in the two sets of climate chambers were carried out simulating summer and winter conditions, respectively. A total of 24 subjects (12 females and 12 males) were recruited for this study, and their local skin temperature, conductive heat flux, and thermal sensations were recorded during the experiments. The local thermal characteristics of the subjects were compared between the `neutral' and `hot' conditions to identify predominant body segments in the summer scenario. Moreover, the comparison was also made between the `neutral' and `cold' conditions to derive predominant body segments in the winter scenario. The analysis of the results indicated that leg, thigh, and back are the key segments desirable for local cooling; whilst leg, thigh, back, and upper arm are the crucial segments for local heating. The findings can have important implications for the design of low-energy cost-effective personal heating/cooling devices.

Toad-headed lizards (Phrynocephalus vlangalil) from a higher-elevation population were shown to have a higher growth rate than those from a lower-elevation population. The physiological basis of growth rate variation in this species is not well understood. Here, we investigated the feeding performance and resting metabolic rate (RMR) of lower- and higher-elevation individuals at different test ambient temperatures to evaluate the role of differences in energy intake, assimilation efficiency and metabolic expenditure on growth rate variations. Within the range of 25 - 35 degrees C, lizard RMR increased with increasing test ambient temperature, but food intake, apparent digestive coefficient (ADC, food energy minus faecal energy divided by food energy), and assimilation efficiency (AE, food energy minus faecal and urinary energy divided by food energy) were less thermally sensitive in both populations. Higher-elevation lizards tended to eat more food and have a lower RMR than lower-elevation ones, despite the lack of differences in ADC and AE. Our result showed that more energy intake and reduced maintenance cost may be associated with the higher growth rate of higher-elevation lizards. Accordingly, inter-population differences in energy acquisition and expenditure could act as potential sources for geographic variation in growth rate.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.01.001,80,NA,16-20,NA,Phrynocephalus vlangalii; Altitude variation; Assimilation efficiency; Growth rate; Resting metabolic rate

While the role of thermal history in conferring such plasticity is widely documented, its interaction with relative humidity (RH), another important driver of ectotherm survival and activity, is relatively underexplored. Yet the potential responses to these combinational stressors across ontogeny remain largely neglected. Against this background, we used a full-factorial design to test the combined acclimation effects of RH (45\%, 65\% and 85\%) and temperature (23, 28 and 33 degrees C) on various indices of thermal sensitivity of laboratory reared spotted stemborer, Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) following acclimation beginning at larval, pupal and adult life-stages. Traits measured included critical thermal limits (CTLs), supercooling points (SCPs), chill coma recovery time (CCRT) and heat knockdown time (HKDT). Larval acclimation at 23 degrees C; 85\% RH recorded the lowest critical thermal minima (CTmin) whereas adult acclimation at 28 degrees C; 45\% RH recorded the highest critical thermal maxima (CTmax. There were no significant differences (P > 0.05) in SCPs across all temperature x RH acclimations. Larval and pupal acclimations at 23 degrees C; 85\% RH and adult acclimation at 23 degrees C; 45\% RH significantly improved CCRT. Similarly, commencing acclimation at larval, pupal and adult stages at 28 degrees C; 85\% RH improved HKDT whereas larval and pupal acclimations at 33 degrees C; 45\% RH impaired it. Our results indicate that combinational interactions of temperature and RH have significant thermal fitness costs and benefits and are dependent on the life-stage acclimation timing. Results also imply that both the vulnerability and adaptive potential of C. partellus populations under rapid climate variability varies with ontogeny. This therefore calls for the consideration of the role of ontogeny and multi-factors in better understanding the impact of environmental stress on ectotherms.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.12.002,79,NA,85-94,NA,Climate change; Ontogeny; Phenotypic plasticity; Stress resistance

Here, we compare the physiological performance with regard to thermal energetics and morphological traits of two sympatric gerbils from the Gobi desert of Inner Mongolia, China. The diurnally active Meriones unguiculatus and the nocturnally active M. meridianus. The diurnal M. unguiculatus had more brown adipose tissue (BAT) mass and capacity for non-shivering thermogenesis (NST), a higher resting metabolic rate (RMR) at low ambient temperatures (T-a) and a higher upper critical temperature of the thermal neutral zone (TNZ) than the nocturnal M. meridianus. The overall thermal conductance and lower critical temperatures of M. unguiculatus were also higher than that of M. meridianus, permitting the former to maintain a stable body temperature (T-b) when exposed to high T-a. Laboratory-bred M. meridianus also showed higher daily water intake. We found no differences in body mass, and total evaporative water loss (TEWL) between the two species captured from the natural environment. These results suggest that the diurnal M. unguiculatus have a higher tolerance of high T(a)s, whereas M. meridianus can save more energy at low T(a)s.

article,High competition between ant species at intermediate temperatures,"Kwon, Tae-Sung",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Living organisms have been moving rapidly toward their favorable thermal regions as climate warms. Their competitive interactions will change significantly as a result of changes in distribution, abundance, and species composition. This study examines the relationship of competition intensity (frequency of competitive interactions) with temperature and the influence of competition on the occurrence of ant species. Competition between ants was surveyed at six different temperature sites using baits and the abundance of ants was surveyed using pitfall traps. The intensity of interspecific competition (abundance-corrected bait species displacement) was high at intermediate temperature sites (unimodal). Ant species are hierarchically organized in behavioral dominance. Two low-temperature ant species had decreased in the rank of behavioral dominance at warmer temperature sites because of the abundance of dominant intermediate temperature ant species. Ant species co-occurred randomly at the local scale. However, they were segregated at regional scale because of environmental filtering (temperature). Ant competition did not influence the occurrence of ant species at local or regional scale. These results suggest that the influence of changes in interspecific competition because of climate warming might not be great for ants in temperate regions.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.11.015,72,NA,59-66,NA,Competition intensity; Temperature; Ant; Climate warming; Abundance; Diversity; Bait species displacement

EvapCC was effective in both HD1 and HD2. LiqCC showed similar cooling benefits compared to EvapCC in HD1 and HD2, and also displayed cooling benefits in HH1. EvapCC \& AirFC was discovered to be most effective cooling strategy in the four studied conditions.

article,Self-heating by large insect larvae?,"Cooley, Nikita L. and Emlen, Douglas J. and Woods, H. Arthur",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Do insect larvae ever self-heat significantly from their own metabolic activity and, if so, under what sets of environmental temperatures and across what ranges of body size? We examine these questions using larvae of the Japanese rhinoceros beetle (Trypoxylus dichotomus), chosen for their large size ( > 20 g), simple body plan, and underground lifestyle. Using CO2 respirometry, we measured larval metabolic rates then converted measured rates of gas exchange into rates of heat production and developed a mathematical model to predict how much steady state body temperatures of underground insects would increase above ambient depending on body size. Collectively, our results suggest that large, extant larvae (20-30 g body mass) can self-heat by at most 2 degrees C, and under many common conditions (shallow depths, moister soils) would self-heat by less than 1 degrees C. By extending the model to even larger (hypothetical) body sizes, we show that underground insects with masses > 1 kg could heat, in warm, dry soils, by 1.5-6 degrees C or more. Additional experiments showed that larval critical thermal maxima (CTmax) were in excess of 43.5 degrees C and that larvae could behaviorally thermoregulate on a thermal gradient bar. Together, these results suggest that large larvae living underground likely regulate their temperatures primarily using behavior; self-heating by metabolism likely contributes little to their heat budgets, at least in most common soil conditions.",2016,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.10.002,62,A,76-83,NA,Heat balance; Body size; Metabolic heat; Critical thermal maxima; Behavioral thermoregulation; Gigantism; Soil
article,Thermoregulation in premature infants: A mathematical model,"Pereira, Carina Barbosa and Heimann, Konrad and Czaplik, Michael and Blazek, Vladimir and Venema, Boudewijn and Leonhardt, Steffen",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Purpose: In 2010, approximately 14.9 million babies (11.1\%) were born preterm. Because preterm infants suffer from an immature thermoregulatory system they have difficulty maintaining their core body temperature at a constant level. Therefore, it is essential to maintain their temperature at, ideally, around 37 degrees C. For this, mathematical models can provide detailed insight into heat transfer processes and body environment interactions for clinical applications. Methods: A new multi-node mathematical model of the thermoregulatory system of newborn infants is presented. It comprises seven compartments, one spherical and six cylindrical, which represent the head, thorax, abdomen, arms and legs, respectively. The model is customizable, i.e. it meets individual characteristics of the neonate (e.g. gestational age, postnatal age, weight and length) which play an important role in heat transfer mechanisms. The model was validated during thermal neutrality and in a transient thermal environment. Results: During thermal neutrality the model accurately predicted skin and core temperatures. The difference in mean core temperature between measurements and simulations averaged 0.25 +/- 0.21 degrees C and that of skin temperature averaged 036 +/- 0.36 degrees C. During transient thermal conditions, our approach simulated the thermoregulatory dynamics/responses. Here, for all infants, the mean absolute error between core temperatures averaged 0.12 +/- 0.11 degrees C and that of skin temperatures hovered around 0.30 degrees C. Conclusions: The mathematical model appears able to predict core and skin temperatures during thermal neutrality and in case of a transient thermal conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Proteomic response of mouse pituitary gland under heat stress revealed active regulation of stress responsive proteins,"Memon, Shahar Bano and Lian, Li and Gadahi, Javaid Ali and Wang Genlin",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The mapping of tissue proteomes can identify the molecular regulators and effectors of their physiological activity. However, proteomic response of a mammalian tissue against heat stress (HS) particularly of the pituitary gland has not yet been resolved. The proteomic response of the mouse pituitary gland against HS at 40 degrees C was evaluated by iTRAQ, We found that, HS actively regulates stress-related proteins. Among 375 differentially expressed proteins, 26 up and 46 downregulated proteins were found as stress responsive proteins. Two proteins belonging to the HSP70 and one to HSP90 family were found upregulated. Meanwhile, the expression of HSP90 alpha (Cytosolic), HSP60, and HSP84b were observed to be downregulated. A neuroprotective enzyme Nmnat3 was observed to be significantly upregulated. Three proteins related to the intermediate filament (IF) proteins (lamins, vimentin and keratins) were also found to be upregulated. We reported, an association between the IF proteins and HSPs as a biological marker of HS. The expression of Apo A-IV was upregulated and might be one explanation for low food intake during HS. Our findings indicated that, differentially expressed proteins might be played important roles in combating HS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

article,The effects of increased constant incubation temperature and cumulative acute heat shock exposures on morphology and survival of Lake Whitefish (<i>Coregonus</i> <i>clupeaformis</i>) embryos,"Lee, Abigail H. and Eme, John and Mueller, Casey A. and Manzon, Richard G. and Somers, Christopher M. and Boreham, Douglas R. and Wilson, Joanna Y.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Increasing incubation temperatures, caused by global climate change or thermal effluent from industrial processes, may influence embryonic development of fish. This study investigates the cumulative effects of increased incubation temperature and repeated heat shocks on developing Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) embryos. We studied the effects of three constant incubation temperatures (2 degrees C, 5 inverted perpendicular C or 8 degrees C water) and weekly, 1-h heat shocks (+3 degrees C) on hatching time, survival and morphology of embryos, as these endpoints may be particularly susceptible to temperature changes. The constant temperatures represent the predicted magnitude of elevated water temperatures from climate change and industrial thermal plumes. Time to the pre-hatch stage decreased as constant incubation temperature increased (148 d at 2 degrees C, 92 d at 5 degrees C, 50 d at 8 degrees C), but weekly heat shocks did not affect time to hatch. Mean survival rates and embryo morphometrics were compared at specific developmental time-points (blastopore, eyed, fin flutter and pre-hatch) across all treatments. Constant incubation temperatures or +3 degrees C heat-shock exposures did not significantly alter cumulative survival percentage (similar to 50\% cumulative survival to pre-hatch stage). Constant warm incubation temperatures did result in differences in morphology in pre-hatch stage embryos. 8 degrees C and 5 degrees C embryos were significantly smaller and had larger yolks than 2 inverted perpendicular C embryos, but heat-shocked embryos did not differ from their respective constant temperature treatment groups. Elevated incubation temperatures may adversely alter Lake Whitefish embryo size at hatch, but weekly 1-h heat shocks did not affect size or survival at hatch. These results suggest that intermittent bouts of warm water effluent (e.g., variable industrial emissions) are less likely to negatively affect Lake Whitefish embryonic development than warmer constant incubation temperatures that may occur due to climate change.

article,Use of finite element analysis to optimize probe design for double sensor method-based thermometer,"Sim, Soo Young and Joo, Kwang Min and Park, Kwang Suk",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Body temperature is an essential vital sign for assessing physiological functions. The double sensor method-based thermometer is a promising technology that may be applicable to body temperature monitoring in daily life. It continuously estimates deep tissue temperature from the intact skin surface. Despite its considerable potential for monitoring body temperature, its key design features have not been investigated. In this study, we considered four design factors: the cover material, insulator material, insulator radius, and insulator height. We also evaluated their effects on the performance of the double sensor thermometer in terms of accuracy, initial waiting time, and the ability to track changes in body temperature. The probe material and size influenced the accuracy and initial waiting time. Finite element analysis revealed that four thermometers of different sizes composed of an aluminum cover and foam insulator provided high accuracy (< 0.1 degrees C) under various ambient temperatures and blood perfusion rates: R=20 mm, H=5 mm; R=15 mm, H=10 mm; R=20 mm, H=10 mm; and R=15 mm, H=15 mm. The initial waiting time was approximately 10 min with almost the same traceability of temperature change. Our findings may provide thermometer manufacturers with new insights into probe design and help them fabricate thermometers optimized for specific applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

article,"Energy expenditure of the spotted snow skink, <i>Niveoscincus ocellatus</i>, at two climatic extremes of its distribution range","Yuni, Luh P. E. K. and Jones, Susan M. and Wapstra, Erik",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The study of energy expenditure between populations of a wide ranging ectothermic species may provide an insight into how organisms respond to variation in environmental conditions. In this study, the energy expenditure of male spotted snow skinks, Niveoscincus ocellatus, living at the two extremes of the species' distribution range (warm lowland versus cold alpine site) was measured using the doubly labelled water method. Males at the cold alpine site expended more energy per gram per hour compared to their counterparts living at the warm lowland site. Lizards living at high altitude were active at lower temperatures compared with those at the low altitude site, which resulted in a longer activity time for the highland population. However, the differences in energy expenditure cannot be explained only by these differences in activity time. We further suggest that at the cold alpine site, lizards compensated for the low temperatures by elevating their metabolism which subsequently increased their energy expenditure. An elevated metabolic rate combined with modified thermoregulatory behaviour is likely an important mechanism allowing N. ocellatus to cope with the cold environments at high altitude sites.

article,Investigation of thermal distribution for pulsed laser radiation in cancer treatment with nanoparticle-mediated hyperthermia,"Sazgarnia, Ameneh and Naghavi, Nadia and Mehdizadeh, Hoda and Shahamat, Zahra",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In this paper, we have simulated the efficacy of gold/gold sulfide (GGS) nanoshells in NIR laser hyperthermia to achieve effective targeting for tumor photothermal therapy. The problem statement takes into account the heat transfer with the blood perfusion through capillaries, and pulsed laser irradiation during the hyperthermia. Although previous researchers have used short laser pulses (nanosecond and less), in order to prevent heat leakage to the neighbor tissues, we have examined the effect of millisecond pulses, as the extent of the target volume to which hyperthermia is induced is usually larger and also the lasers with this specification are more available. A tumor with surrounding tissue was simulated in COMSOL software (a finite element analysis, solver and simulation software) and also in a phantom made of agarose and intralipid. The tumor was irradiated by 10,20 and 30 laser pulses with durations of 15,50 and 200 ms and fluences of 20, 40 and 60 J/cm(2). Experimental tests performed on a phantom prove the ability of the applied numerical model to capture the temperature distribution in the target tissue. We have shown that our simulation permits prediction of treatment outcome from computation of thermal distribution within the tumor during laser hyperthermia using GGS nanoshells and millisecond pulsed laser irradiation. The advantage of this simulation is its simplicity as well as its accuracy. Although, to develop the model completely for a given organ and application, all the parameters should be estimated based on a real vasculature of the organ, physiological conditions, and expected variation in those physiological conditions for that application in the organ.

article,Firefighter feedback during active cooling: A useful tool for heat stress management?,"Savage, Robbie J. and Lord, Cara and Larsen, Brianna L. and Knight, Teagan L. and Langridge, Peter D. and Aisbett, Brad",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Monitoring an individual's thermic state in the workplace requires reliable feedback of their core temperature. However, core temperature measurement technology is expensive, invasive and often impractical in operational environments, warranting investigation of surrogate measures which could be used to predict core temperature. This study examines an alternative measure of an individual's thermic state, thermal sensation, which presents a more manageable and practical solution for Australian firefighters operating on the fireground. Across three environmental conditions (cold, warm, hot \& humid), 49 Australian volunteer firefighters performed a 20-min fire suppression activity, immediately followed by 20 min of active cooling using hand and forearm immersion techniques. Core temperature (T-c) and thermal sensation (TS) were measured across the rehabilitation period at five minute intervals. Despite the decline in T-c and TS throughout the rehabilitation period, there was little similarity in the magnitude or rate of decline between each measure in any of the ambient conditions. Moderate to strong correlations existed between T-c and TS in the cool (0.41, p < 0.05) and hot \& humid (0.57, p < 0.05) conditions, however this was resultant in strong correlation during the earlier stages of rehabilitation (first five minutes), which were not evident in the latter stages. Linear regression revealed TS to be a poor predictor of Tc in all conditions (SEE=0.45-0.54 degrees C) with a strong trend for TS to over-predict T-c (77-80\% of the time). There is minimal evidence to suggest that ratings of thermal sensation, which represent a psychophysical assessment of an individual's thermal comfort, are an accurate reflection of the response of an individual's core temperature. Ratings of thermal sensation can be highly variable amongst individuals, likely moderated by local skin temperature. In account of these findings, fire managers require a more reliable source of information to guide decisions of heat stress management. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Seasonal heat acclimatization in wildland firefighters,"Lui, Brianna and Cuddy, John S. and Les, Walter S. Hai and Ruby, Brent C.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The purpose of this study was to determine changes in physiological markers of heat acclimatization across a 4-month wildland fire season. Wildland firefighters (WLFF) (n=12) and non-WLFF (n=14) were assessed pre- and post-season for body mass, percent body fat, and peak VO2. Both groups completed a 60-min heat stress trial (walking at 50\% of peak 1./02) in a climate controlled chamber (43.3 degrees C, 33\% RH) pre and post-fire season (May through September). During the trials, core (T-c) and skin (T-sk) temperatures, heart rate (HR), physiological strain index (PSI), and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were measured. There were no differences pre or post-season between the WLFF and non-WLFF groups in body mass, percent body fat, or peak VO2. During the 73 days where the WLFF were involved in direct wildland fire suppression, daily high temperature for the WLFF was higher compared to the non-WLFF, 30.6 +/- 5.4 degrees C and 26.9 +/- 6.1 degrees C, respectively, p < 0.05. T-c was lower at post-season compared to pre-season (p < 0.05) for the WLFF at 30, 45, and 60 min (pre 30, 45, and 60: 37.9 +/- 0.3, 38.3 +/- 0.3 and 38.5 +/- 0.3 degrees C, respectively; post 30, 45. and 60: 37.8 +/- 0.3, 38.1 +/- 0.3 and 38.2 +/- 0.4 degrees C, respectively). For WLFF, PSI was lower (p < 0.05) at 15, 30, 45, and 60 min at post-season compared to pre-season (4.2 +/- 0.7, 5.6 +/- 0.9, 6.5 +/- 0.9, and 7.1 +/- 1.1 for 15, 30, 45, and 60 min pre-season, respectively; 3.6 +/- 0.8, 4.9 +/- 1.0, 5.7 +/- 1.2, 6.3 +/- 1.3 for 15, 30, 45, and 60 min post-season, respectively). For WLFF, RPE was lower during the post-season trial at 30, 45, and 60 min (pre 30, 45, and 60: 11.7 +/- 1.4, 12.3 +/- 1.2, and 13.5 1.4, respectively; post 30, 45, and 60: 10.7 +/- 1.2, 11.3 +/- 1.3, and 11.9 +/- 1.5, respectively), p < 0.05. There were no differences between pre and post-season for the non-WLFF for T-c and PSI, but RPE was lower at 15 min during the pre-season trial. WLFFs demonstrated significant decreases in T-c, PSI, and RPE during controlled heat stress after the season. Since an age and fitness-matched control group experienced no indication of heat acclimatization, it is suggested that the long-term occupational heat exposure accrued by the WLFFs was adequate to incur heat acclimatization.

article,Steady state temperature distribution in dermal regions of an irregular tapered shaped human limb with variable eccentricity,"Agrawal, M. and Pardasani, K. R. and Adlakha, N.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The investigators in the past have developed some models of temperature distribution in the human limb assuming it as a regular circular or elliptical tapered cylinder. But in reality the limb is not of regular tapered cylindrical shape. The radius and eccentricity are not same throughout the limb. In view of above a model of temperature distribution in the irregular tapered elliptical shaped human limb is proposed for a three dimensional steady state case in this paper. The limb is assumed to be composed of multiple cylindrical substructures with variable radius and eccentricity. The mathematical model incorporates the effect of blood mass flow rate, metabolic activity and thermal conductivity. The outer surface is exposed to the environment and appropriate boundary conditions have been framed. The finite element method has been employed to obtain the solution. The temperature profiles have been computed in the dermal layers of a human limb and used to study the effect of shape, microstructure and biophysical parameters on temperature distribution in human limbs. The proposed model is one of the most realistic model as compared to conventional models as this can be effectively employed to every regular and nonregular structures of the body with variable radius and eccentricity to study the thermal behaviour.

article,Physiological strain of stock car drivers during competitive racing,"Carlson, Lara A. and Ferguson, David P. and Kenefick, Robert W.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Heat strain experienced by motorsport athletes competing in National Association for Stock Car Automobile Racing (NASCAR) may be significant enough to impair performance or even result in a life-threatening accident. There is a need to carefully quantify heat strain during actual NASCAR race competitions in order to faithfully represent the magnitude of the problem and conceptualize future mitigation practices. The purpose of this investigation was to quantify the thermoregulatory and physiological strain associated with competitive stock car driving. Eight male stock car drivers (29.0 +/- 10.0 yr; 176.2 +/- 3.3 cm, 80.6 +/- 15.7 kg) participated in sanctioned stock car races. Physiological measurements included intestinal core (T-c) and skin (T-sk) temperatures, heart rate (HR), blood pressure, and body mass before and after completion of the race. Pre-race T-c was 38.1 +/- 0.1 degrees C which increased to 38.6 +/- 0.2 degrees C post-race (p=0.001). T-sk increased from 36.1 +/- 0.2 degrees C pre-race to 37.3 +/- 0.3 degrees C post-race (p=0.001) whereas the core-to-skin temperature gradient decreased from a pre-race value of 2.0 +/- 0.3 degrees C to 1.3 +/- 0.3 degrees C post-race (p=0.005). HRs post-race were 80 +/- 0.1\% of the drivers' age-predicted maximum HR. Physiological Strain Index (PSI) post-race was 4.9, which indicates moderate strain. Drivers' thermal sensation based on the ASHRAE Scale increased from 1.3 +/- 0.5 to 2.8 +/- 0.4, and their perception of exertion (RPE) responses also increased from 8.4 +/- 1.6 to 13.9 +/- 1.8 after competition. Heat strain associated with competitive stock car racing is significant. These findings suggest the need for heat mitigation practices and provide evidence that motorsport should consider strategies to become heat acclimatized to better meet the thermoregulatory and cardiovascular challenges of motorsport competition.

article,Temperature and sex dependent effects on cardiac mitochondrial metabolism in Atlantic cod (<i>Gadus morhua</i> L.),"Rodnick, Kenneth J. and Gamperl, A. Kurt and Nash, Gordon W. and Syme, Douglas A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"To test the hypothesis that impaired mitochondrial respiration limits cardiac performance at warm temperatures, and examine if any effect(s) are sex-related, the consequences of high temperature on cardiac mitochondrial oxidative function were examined in 10 degrees C acclimated, sexually immature, male and female Atlantic cod. Active (State 3) and uncoupled (States 2 and 4) respiration were measured in isolated ventricular mitochondria at 10, 16, 20, and 24 degrees C using saturating concentrations of malate and pyruvate, but at a submaximal (physiological) level of ADP (200 mu M). In addition, citrate synthase (CS) activity was measured at these temperatures, and mitochondrial respiration and the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation (P:O ratio) were determined at {[}ADP] ranging from 25-200 mu M at 10 and 20 degrees C. Cardiac morphometrics and mitochondrial respiration at 10 degrees C, and the thermal sensitivity of CS activity (Q(10)=1.51), were all similar between the sexes. State 3 respiration at 200 mu M ADP increased gradually in mitochondria from females between 10 and 24 degrees C (Q(10)=1.48), but plateaued in males above 16 degrees C, and this resulted in lower values in males vs. females at 20 and 24 degrees C. At 10 degrees C, State 4 was similar to 10\% of State 3 values in both sexes {[}i.e. a respiratory control ratio (RCR) of similar to 10] and P:O ratios were approximately 1.5. Between 20 and 24 degrees C, State 4 increased more than State 3 (by similar to 70 vs. 14\%, respectively), and this decreased RCR to similar to 7.5. The P:O ratio was not affected by temperature at 200 mu M ADP. However, (1) the sensitivity of State 3 respiration to increasing {[}ADP] (from 25 to 200 mu M) was reduced at 20 vs. 10 degrees C in both sexes (K-m values 105 +/- 7 vs. 68 +/- 10 mu M, respectively); and (2) mitochondria from females had lower P:O values at 25 vs. 100 mu M ADP at 20 degrees C, whereas males showed a similar effect at 10 degrees C but a much more pronounced effect at 20 degrees C (P:O 1.05 at 25 mu M ADP vs. 1.78 at 100 mu M ADP). In summary, our results demonstrate several sex-related differences in ventricular mitochondrial function in Atlantic cod, and suggest that myocardial oxidative function and possibly phosphorylation efficiency may be limited at temperatures of 20 degrees C or above, particularly in males. These observations could partially explain why cardiac function in Atlantic cod plateaus just below this species' critical thermal maximum (similar to 22 degrees C) and may contribute to yet unidentified sex differences in thermal tolerance and swimming performance.

article,Shallow hypothermia depends on the level of fatty acid unsaturation in adipose and liver tissues in a tropical heterothermic primate,"Vuarin, Pauline and Henry, Pierre-Yves and Guesnet, Philippe and Alessandri, Jean-Marc and Aujard, Fabienne and Perret, Martine and Pifferi, Fabien",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Optimal levels of unsaturated fatty acids have positive impacts on the use of prolonged bouts of hypothermia in mammalian hibernators, which generally have to face low winter ambient temperatures. Unsaturated fatty acids can maintain the fluidity of fat and membrane phospholipids at low body temperatures. However, less attention has been paid to their role in the regulation of shallow hypothermia, and in tropical species, which may be challenged more by seasonal energetic and/or water shortages than by low temperatures. The present study assessed the relationship between the fatty acids content of white adipose and liver tissues and the expression of shallow hypothermia in a tropical heterothermic primate, the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus). The adipose tissue is the main tissue for fat storage and the liver is involved in lipid metabolism, so both tissues were expected to influence hypothermia dependence on fatty acids. As mouse lemurs largely avoid deep hypothermia (i.e. torpor) use under standard captive conditions, the expression of hypothermia was triggered by food-restricting experimental animals. Hypothermia depth increased with time, with a stronger increase for individuals that exhibited higher contents of unsaturated fatty acids suggesting that they were more flexible in their use of hypothermia. However these same animals delayed the use of long hypothermia bouts relative to individuals with a higher level of saturated fatty acids. This study evidences for the first time that body fatty acids unsaturation levels influence the regulation of body temperature not only in cold-exposed hibernators but also in tropical, facultative heterotherms.

article,Ways to measure body temperature in the field,"Langer, Franz and Fietz, Joanna",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Body temperature (T-b) represents one of the key parameters in ecophysiological studies with focus on energy saving strategies. In this study we therefore comparatively evaluated the usefulness of two types of temperature-sensitive passive transponders (LifeChips and IPTT-300) and one data logger (iButton, DS1922L) mounted onto a collar to measure T-b in the field. First we tested the accuracy of all three devices in a water bath with water temperature ranging from 0 to 40 degrees C. Second, we evaluated the usefulness of the LifeChips and the modified iButtons for measuring T-b of small heterothermic mammals under field conditions. For this work we subcutaneously implanted 14 male edible dormice (Glis glis) with transponders, and equipped another 14 males with data loggers to simultaneously record T-b and oxygen consumption with a portable oxygen analyzer (Oxbox). In one individual we recorded T-b with both devices and analyzed recorded T-b patterns. LifeChips are able to measure temperature within the smallest range from 25 to 40 degrees C with an accuracy of 0.07 +/- 0.12 C. IPTT-300 transponders measured temperature between 10 and 40 degrees C, but accuracy decreased considerably at values below 30 degrees C, with maximal deviations of nearly 7 degrees C. An individual calibration of each transponder is therefore needed, before using it at low TbS. The accuracy of the data logger was comparatively good (0.12 +/- 0.25 degrees C) and stable over the whole temperature range tested (0-40 degrees). In all three devices, the repeatability of measurements was high. LifeChip transponders as well as modified iButtons measured T-b reliably under field conditions. Simultaneous T-b-recordings in one edible dormouse with an implanted LifeChip and a collar-mounted iButton revealed that values of both measurements were closely correlated. Taken together, we conclude that implanted temperature-sensitive transponders represent an appropriate and largely non-invasive method to measure Tb also under field conditions.

The expression of the investigated genes was identified in all the examined brain regions (hypothalamus, frontal cortex, hippocampus and midbrain). It was found rather high expression of the genes of warm sensitive ion channels was activated at temperatures above 30 degrees C, in contrast, the gene expression level of cold sensitive TRPM8 and TRPA1 proved to be much lower. The expression of the genes of thermosensitive TRP ion channels was, mostly, greater in the hypothalamus than in the other brain regions. Comparison of the gene expression of all TRP ion channels in every investigated brain structures showed that after long-term adaptation to cold the decrease in Trpv3 gene expression was observed only in the hypothalamus, i.e. adaptive change is hypothalamic specific. Obtained results may evidence that thermosensitive TRP ion channels can be involved in the mechanisms of thermal adaptation at the level of gene expression. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

article,"Influences of sex, ontogeny and body size on the thermal ecology of <i>Liolaemus lutzae</i> (Squamata, Liolaemidae) in a restinga remnant in southeastern Brazil","Maia-Carneiro, Thiago and Duarte Rocha, Carlos Frederico",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Variations in body temperature (T-b) of lizards can be partially explained by intrinsic factors such as sex, ontogeny and body size. Liolaemus lutzae is a lizard species restricted to restingas in the Brazilian coast in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Herein, we studied sexual dimorphism and influences of sex, ontogeny, and body size to the Tb of L lutzae. Adult males were larger than adult females, probably due to both intersexual selection and intra-sexual selection. There was intersexual difference in lizards' Tb (males hotter than females), but Tb did not differ after factored out for the effects of body size. The mean Tb of juvenile lizards was higher than that of adults after factored out for the effect of body mass. It is possible that adults may have excluded juveniles from microhabitats with better thermal regimes. Also, this might have occurred due to requirements of juveniles to maintain high growth rates. Forage searching for prey by juveniles also exposes them to high environmental temperatures. Juveniles also may have higher Tb than co-specific adults (relative to body mass) to favor prey capture. In absolute values, adult lizards tended to use microhabitats with lower temperatures than that used by juveniles, possibly to avoid risks of overheating and death. Body temperature and snout-vent length were positively related, as well as body temperature and body mass, presumably caused by the thermal inertia of the bodies (trend of a body to resist to changes in its temperature). Intrinsic factors such as sex, ontogeny and body size can affect the thermal ecology of L lutzae, despite coastal habitat features to which they are exposed also influences the body temperature of active lizards in restinga habitats.

article,Evidence from <i>Tarentola mauritanica</i> (Gekkota: Phyllodactylidae) helps validate thermography as a tool to infer internal body temperatures of lizards,"Barroso, Frederico M. and Riano, Gabriel and Sannolo, Marco and Carretero, Miguel A. and Rato, Catarina",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Infrared (IR) thermal imaging has become an increasingly popular tool to measure body temperature of animals. The high-resolution data it provides with short lag and minimum disturbance makes it an appealing tool when studying reptile thermal ecology. However, due to the common phenomenon of regional heterothermy and surface-to-core temperature gradients, it is essential to select the appropriate body part to measure and provide calibrations to accurately infer internal body temperatures. This work follows from a previous study on lacertid lizards to assess the reliability of thermography-measured body temperatures, from several body locations, as a proxy for internal body temperature in lizards. This study focuses on the Moorish gecko, Tarentola mauritanica, due to its distant phylogenetic relationship and its different ecology and morphology from the previously tested species. A total of 60 adult geckos of both sexes and of a range of sizes were tested in thermal gradients and subjected to a sequence of randomly assorted treatments of heating and cooling. The temperatures of the animals were periodically measured with a thermal camera at six different body parts and, immediately after, the cloacal temperature was then measured with a thermocouple probe. Body parts' temperatures, obtained thermographically, were regressed against cloacal temperature using OLS regression and the pairwise correlations were tested using Spearman coefficients. Relationships among all body parts and between all body parts and the cloaca were strong in all cases (R-2 > 0.87, Spearman Correlation > 0.95). The observed pattern was very similar to those previously obtained from lacertid lizards. Ultimately, the eye proved to provide the best overall proxy for internal temperature, when accounting for both the slope and intercept of the regression.

article,Oxygen-dependence of upper thermal limits in crustaceans from different thermal habitats,"Ern, Rasmus and Chung, Dillon and Frieder, Christina A. and Madsen, Niels and Speers-Roesch, Ben",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The critical thermal maximum (CTMAX) is the temperature at which animals exhibit loss of motor response because of a temperature-induced collapse of vital physiological systems. A central mechanism hypothesised to underlie the CTMAX of water-breathing ectotherms is insufficient tissue oxygen supply for vital maintenance functions because of a temperature-induced collapse of the cardiorespiratory system. The CTMAX of species conforming to this hypothesis should decrease with declining water oxygen tension (PO2) because they have oxygen-dependent upper thermal limits. However, recent studies have identified a number of fishes and crustaceans with oxygen-independent upper thermal limits, their CTMAX unchanged in progressive aquatic hypoxia. The previous studies, which were performed separately on cold-water, temperate and tropical species, suggest the oxygen-dependence of upper thermal limits and the acute thermal sensitivity of the cardiorespiratory system increases with decreasing habitat temperature. Here we directly test this hypothesis by assessing the oxygen-dependence of CTMAX in the polar Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), as well as the temperate Baltic prawn (Palaemon adspersus) and brown shrimp (Crangon crangon). We found that P. adspersus and C. crangon maintain CTMAX in progressive hypoxia down to 40 mmHg, and that only E. superba have oxygen-dependent upper thermal limits at normoxia. In E. superba, the observed decline in CTMAX with water PO2 is further supported by heart-rate measurements showing a plateauing, and subsequent decline and collapse of heart performance at CTMAX. Our results support the hypothesis that the oxygen-dependence of upper thermal limits in water-breathing ectotherms and the acute thermal sensitivity of their cardiorespiratory system increases with decreasing habitat temperature.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102732,93,NA,NA,102732,Aquatic hypoxia; Cardiorespiratory thermal tolerance; Critical thermal maximum (CTMAX); Oxygen limit for thermal tolerance (PCTMAX); Polar stenothermal; Temperate eurythermal
article,"Effect of temperature on life-history traits and mating calls of a field cricket, <i>Acanthogryllus asiaticus</i>","Singh, Richa and Prathibha, P. and Jain, Manjari",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Ectotherms are sensitive to changes in ambient temperature that impact their physiology and development. To compensate for the effects of variation in temperature, ectotherms exhibit short or long-term physiological plasticity. An extensive body of literature exists towards understanding these effects and the solutions ectotherms have evolved. However, to what extent rearing temperature during early life stages impacts the behaviour expressed in adulthood is less clearly understood. In the present study, we aimed to examine the effects of developmental temperature on life-history traits and mating call features in a tropical field cricket, Acanthogryllus asiaticus. We raised A. asiaticus at two different developmental conditions: 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C. We found developmental time and adult lifespan of individuals reared at 30 degrees C to be shorter than those reared at 25 degrees C. Increased developmental temperature influenced various body size parameters differentially. Males raised at 30 degrees C were found to be larger and heavier than those raised at 25 degrees C, making A. asiaticus an exception to the temperature-size rule. We found a significant effect of change in immediate ambient temperature on different call features of both field-caught and lab-bred individuals. Developmental temperature also affected mating call features wherein individuals raised at higher temperature produced faster calls with a higher peak frequency compared to those raised at lower temperature. In addition, an interactive effect of both developmental and immediate temperature was found on mating call features. Our study highlights the importance of understanding how environmental temperature shapes life-history and sexual communication in crickets.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102740,93,NA,NA,102740,Developmental plasticity; Body size; Developmental temperature; Ectotherms; Temperature-size rule

The breast tissue can be visualized as a porous matrix with saturated blood. In this paper, 3D in silico study of breast cancer hyperthermia using magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) is conducted. The 3D FEM models are incorporated to investigate the infusion and backflow of nanofluid in the breast tumor, the diffusion of nanofluid, temperature distribution during the treatment, and prediction of the fraction of tumor necrosis while dealing with the thermal therapy. All the hyperthermia procedures are simulated and analyzed on COMSOL Multiphysics. The sensitivity of frequency and amplitude of the applied magnetic field (AMF) is investigated on the heating effect of the tumor. The mesh dependent solution of Penne' s bioheat model is also analyzed. The simulated results demonstrate successful breast cancer treatment using MNPs with minimum side effects. Validation of current simulations results with experimental studies existing in literature advocates the success of our therapy. The increase in the amplitude and frequency of the AMF increases of the temperature in the tumor. The variation of mesh from coarser to finer increased the temperature through small fractions. We have also simulated the magnetic induction problem where the magnetic field is generated by current-carrying coil conductors induce heat in nearby breast tumors due to excitation of MNPs by magnetic flux.

A study was conducted to investigate the early age thermal manipulation (EATM) on the performance and physiological responses broiler chickens under hot humid tropical climate. A total of 260 unsexed day-old Arbor-acre broiler chicks were assigned to five thermal treatments of brooding temperature regimens having 4 replicates of thirteen birds each. The heat treatments were: initial brooding temperature of 35 degrees C for the first 2 days, and then decreased subsequently, gradually to 22 degrees C at 21 d of age (CT), initial temperature of 35 degrees C, sustained for the first 4 days and then decreased gradually (conventionally) (FD), initial temperature of 35 degrees C for the first 7 days (SD), the birds in CT, but the brooding temperature was raised to 35 degrees C again for another 3 days from day 7 (SD3), initial brooding temperature of 35 degrees C for the first 10 days (TD). Data were collected on daily feed intake and weekly body weights. Blood samples were collected from 8 birds per treatment weekly for the determination of plasma uric acid, triglycerides, triiodothyronine (T-3) and creatinine kinase. Data obtained were laid out in a Completely Randomized Design (CRD). Results showed that the final weights of the birds in FD were higher (P < 0.05) than those of the other treatments at the finisher phase. Feed intake of the birds in FD was higher than those of SD3 and TD. FCR of broiler thickens in CT, SD, SD3 and TD was higher than that of FD.

In this work, we study the daily and geographical variation of the preferential temperature of the spider Sicarius thomisoides subjected to different degrees of daily thermal oscillation in their habitats. Preferred temperatures differ between coastal and inland populations, but in both cases, there is a marked bimodality in the daily pattern of temperature preference, with two peaks per day that would be given by the changes in the hours of activity. These nocturnal spiders select higher temperatures in the evening (active period) and select lower temperatures during late morning (resting period).

Here we test variation in DTR (+/- 0 degrees C, +/- 4 degrees C, +/- 6 degrees C, +/- 8 degrees C, +/- 10 degrees C and +/- 12 degrees C) with a constant mean temperature (25 degrees C) on the larval stage of diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella (L.), and assess immediate effects on larval development and survival, and delayed effects on pupal development and survival and adult longevity and reproductive performance. Wide amplitudes (+/- 10 degrees C and +/- 12 degrees C) inhibited larval development and adult performance, but increased the proportion of eggs laid early, while moderate amplitudes (+/- 4 degrees C, +/- 6 degrees C and +/- 8 degrees C) resulted in only minor effects. Larval development rate under wide amplitudes ( +/- 10 degrees C and +/- 12 degrees C) was faster than predicted by a degree-hour model. Overall, the intrinsic rate of increase of the population was lowered with increasing DTR, despite mean temperatures being the same. These findings highlight marked cross-stage effects of DTR when temperatures fluctuate substantially, likely linked to maximum temperature, and they emphasize the importance of considering DTR when assessing effects of climate warming.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.05.013,84,NA,8-15,NA,Temperature; Thermal amplitude; Larval stage; Cross-stage; Plutella xylostella
article,Thermal regime effects on the resting metabolic rate of rattlesnakes depend on temperature range,"Fabricio-Neto, Ailton and Bueno Gavira, Rodrigo Samuel and Andrade, Denis Vieira",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"While ectothermic organisms often experience considerable circadian variation in body temperature under natural conditions, the study of the effects of temperature on metabolic rates are traditionally based on subjecting animals to constant temperature regimes. Whether data resulting from constant-temperature experiments accurately predicts temperature effects under more natural fluctuating temperature regimes remains uncertain. To address such possibility, we measured the resting metabolic rates of the South American rattlesnakes (Crotalus durissus) under constant and circadian fluctuating thermal regimes in a range of temperatures. Metabolic rates measured at constant 20 degrees C and 25 degrees C did not differ from the rates measured at fluctuating regimes with corresponding mean temperatures. However, the difference between thermal regimes increased with temperature, with the metabolic rate measured at constant 30 degrees C being greater than that measured at the fluctuating thermal regime with corresponding mean temperature. Therefore, our results indicate that thermal regime effects on rattlesnakes' metabolism is dependent on temperature range. Broadly, our results highlight the importance of considering multi-factorial attributes of temperature variation in the exam of its effects over functional traits. Such approach provides a more solid support for inferences about temperature effects on the life history, ecology and conservation of ectothermic organisms.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.05.025,83,NA,199-205,NA,Metabolic rate; Snakes; Circadian variation; Temperature; Thermoperiod; Temperature variability

In this study we investigated whether curcumin suppresses heat-induced apoptosis in chicken embryonic fibroblast cells (CEF) and the underlying mechanism. CEF cells line was divided into 6 groups (4 repetitions per group) including normal temperature group (NC), high temperature control group (H) and 4 experimental groups (H1(5 mu mol/L), H2(10 mu mol/L), H3(20 mu mol/L) and H4(40 mu mol/L)). Control groups were cultured in basic medium without Curcumin, while, the experimental groups were supplemented with 5, 10, 20 and 40 mu mol/L, respectively. The experimental groups and H control group were cultured at 43 degrees C (95\% air/5\% CO2), whereas NC group cells were cultured at 37 degrees C. After 6, 12 and 24 h of culture, cells were collected for viability, proliferation, apoptosis, antioxidant status and gene expression analysis. Results showed that heat stress trigged the ROS production and induced the apoptosis, leading to decrease the cell viability and proliferation. The enzymatic activities of antioxidants (SOD, CAT, and GPX) were down-regulated. The expression of antioxidant enzyme (CAT, SOD1, SOD2, GSTO1, GSTT1 and GSTA3) and MAPK-Nrf2 pathway genes (Nrf2, Jnk, Erk and P38) were down-regulated under heats stress condition. While, the Curcumin treated groups had decreased ROS and MDA content. Down-regulation of the activity and expression of antioxidant enzyme induced by heat were also reversed by curcumin. Furthermore the up-regulation in expression of Nrf2, Jnk, Erk and P38 in supplemented groups revealed the involvement of MAPK-Nrf2 signaling pathway to alleviate oxidative stress induced by heat stress.

Infrared thermography (IRT) was presented in this paper as a noninvasive temperature monitoring method used in magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia (MNH). We tried to use this surface temperature measurement method to get information about the intratumoral temperature. Experimental in vitro MNH studies were performed on gel tumor-tissue phantoms which were constructed to simulate the real tumor and overlying healthy tissue. Magnetic nanoparticles were dispersed uniformly in the tumor part of phantom. During the process of in vitro MNH, an alternating magnetic field (AMF) was applied for heating, an IR thermal camera monitored the surface temperature and a fiber optical sensor measured the tumor temperature. A numerical finite element models of thermal analyses was built to simulate the MNH phantom experiments. Both experimental and numerical results indicate that the temperature difference between the surface hot spot and the tumor inner will reach a fixed value while the heating is going on. This value is correlated to factors such as heat generation of hyperthermia, size and depth of the tumor.

Therefore, this study investigated five days of training in the heat of varying intensity and duration and inclusion of cold-water immersion (CWI) recovery on sleep quantity and quality. Thirty recreationally-trained male participants completed five days of heat training (HT) and were randomised into three interventions including (i) 90 min cycling at 40\% power at maximal aerobic capacity (P-max) with 15 min passive recovery (90HT); (ii) 90 min cycling at 40\% P-max with 15 min CWI recovery (90CWI); or (iii) 30 min cycling alternating between 40\% and 70\% P-max, with 15 min passive recovery (30HT). Sleep quality and quantity were assessed using Actigraphy and sleep diaries during five baseline nights (BASE) and five nights of HT which included subjective sleep quality and objective assessments of sleep quantity and quality. Total time asleep and perceived sleep quality were reduced, while awake duration and wake after sleep onset (WASO) were increased (p = 0.001-0.01) during HT compared to BASE. Latency was shorter for 30HT compared to 90HT during HT (p = 0.02), however, no differences between interventions for all other sleep variables (p > 0.05). The reduction in total sleep time due to increases in average wake duration during HT may be due to the unaccustomed increased in training frequency.

article,Temperature-induced plasticity in morphology and relative shell weight in the invasive apple snail <i>Pomacea canaliculata</i>,"Tamburi, Nicolas E. and Seuffert, Maria E. and Martin, Pablo R.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature has a great influence on the life-history traits of freshwater snails. In this study we investigated the long term effects of a range of temperatures on shell morphology of the apple snail Pomacea canaliculata, a highly invasive species and an important pest of rice. Analysis of shells using geometric morphometrics showed that the main source of morphological variation was allometry, which was detected in males but not in females. This intersexual divergence in allometric trajectories generates much of the morphological variation evidenced. In females, the monotonic relationship with temperature produced narrower shells in the snails reared at lower temperatures, and more expanded apertures, relatively bigger than the body whorl, at higher temperatures. We also found an inverse relationship between relative shell weight, a proxy for shell thickness, and temperature. The differences in shape and relative shell weight are attributable to the different growth rates associated with different temperatures. Temperature fluctuation around a mean of 23.2 degrees C seemed to have no influence in shell shape and relative weight when is compared with a constant temperature of 25 degrees C. Information on the influence of temperature on freshwater snails is important for understanding and predicting changes in the face of global climatic change, especially in traits exhibiting great plasticity, such as shell shape and thickness. This work showed that higher temperatures could result in a relatively thinner shell, implying a greater significance of corrosion in flowing waters and a lower resistance to crushing by predators, especially in low latitude areas.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.04.008,74,NA,331-336,NA,Geometric morphometrics; Growth; Shell shape; Shell thickness; Ampullariidae

article,"The relation between melanism and thermal biology in a colour polymorphic bush cricket, <i>Isophya rizeensis</i>","Kuyucu, Arda Cem and Sahin, Mehmet Kursat and Caglar, Selim Sualp",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"According to the thermal melanism hypothesis, darker coloured melanic individuals heat up faster and to higher temperatures than lighter coloured individuals due to lower skin reflectance. Consequently, it is assumed that darker melanic types may be advantageous compared to light coloured types in colder regions. As temperature gradually decreases with elevation and latitude the degree of melanism is expected to increase along these gradients in ectothermic species. Isophya rizeensis, a colour polymorphic bush cricket species endemic to Northeastern Turkey is an interesting case since the degree of melanism decreases with elevation, contrary to the thermal melanism hypothesis. In order to investigate the relation between colouration and thermal biology of this species, body temperatures (T-b) of crickets from different colour morphs, environmental temperatures (T-a), solar radiation and vegetation height were measured to test the relation between these variables and thermoregulation. Field results showed that solar radiation was the most effective factor on temperature excess (T-ex), the difference between body and ambient temperature. Additionally, T-ex, values showed negative correlation with vegetation height. Although T-ex values did not differ significantly between colour morphs, paired experiments under sunlight showed that darker morphs heated up faster and attained higher body temperatures than light morphs. We conclude that, since higher T-ex values at alpine short swards might also increase the risk of facing deleterious temperatures at high elevations, protection against overheating might be one of the factors responsible for this polymorphism.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.11.017,71,NA,212-220,NA,Bush crickets; Thermal adaptation; Melanism; Thermoregulation

article,"Torpor expression in juvenile and adult Djungarian hamsters (<i>Phodopus sungorus</i>) differs in frequency, duration and onset in response to a daily cycle in ambient temperature","Diedrich, Victoria and Bank, Jonathan H. and Scherbarth, Frank and Steinlechner, Stephan",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In addition to morphological and physiological traits of short-day acclimatisation, Djungarian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) from Central Asia exhibit spontaneous daily torpor to decrease energy demands during Winter. Environmental factors such as food scarcity and low temperatures have been shown to facilitate the use of this temporal reduction in metabolism and body temperature. We investigated the effect of a daily cycle in ambient temperature on short-day acclimation and torpor expression in juvenile and adult Djungarian hamsters. The animals were exposed to a cold dark phase (6 degrees C) and a warmer light phase (18 degrees C) and were compared with control hamsters kept at a constant ambient temperature of 18 degrees C. Under constant conditions, torpor expression did not differ between adult and juvenile hamsters. Although the daily temperature cycle evoked an increased metabolic rate in adult and juvenile hamsters during the dark phase and strengthened the synchronization between torpor entrance and the beginning of the light phase, it did not induce the expected torpor facilitation. In adult hamsters, torpor expression profiles did not differ from those under constant conditions at all. In contrast, juvenile hamsters showed a delayed onset of torpor season, a decreased torpor frequency, depth and duration, as well as an increased number of early torpor terminations coinciding with the rise in ambient temperature after the beginning of the light phase. While the temperature challenge appeared to be of minor importance for energy balance and torpor expression in adult hamsters, it profoundly influenced the overall energy saving strategy of juvenile hamsters, promoting torpor-alleviating active foragers over torpor-prone energy-savers. In addition, our data suggest a more efficient acclimation in juvenile hamsters under additional energy challenges, which reduces the need for torpor expression. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Evaluating the physiological acclimatory responses of economically important species is useful for determining their optimal culture conditions. Here, juvenile Chinese three-keeled pond turtles (Mauremys reevesii) were acclimated to one of three different temperatures (17, 25 or 33 degrees C) for four weeks to assess the effects of thermal acclimation on some physiological traits. Thermal acclimation significantly affected thermal resistance, but not thermal preference, of juvenile M. reevesii. Turtles acclimated to 17 degrees C were less resistant to high temperatures than those acclimated to 25 degrees C and 33 degrees C. However, turtles increased resistance to low temperatures with decreasing acclimation temperature. The acclimation response ratio of the critical thermal minimum (CTMin) was lower than that of the critical thermal maximum (CTMax) for acclimation temperatures between 17 and 25 degrees C, but slightly higher between 25 and 33 degrees C. The thermal resistance range (i.e., the difference between CTMax and CTMin) was widest in turtles acclimated to the intermediate temperature (25 degrees C), and narrowest in those acclimated to low temperature (17 degrees C). The standard metabolic rate increased as body temperature and acclimation temperature increased, and the temperature quotient (Q(10)) between acclimation temperatures 17 and 25 degrees C was higher than the Q(10) between 25 and 33 degrees C.

We illustrate this by measuring the effect of behaviour in a cool temperate species of grasshopper (Phaulacridium vittatum) over a range of spatial and temporal scales in laboratory and natural field experiments. Microhabitat selection at the site scale was tested in free-ranging grasshoppers and related to changing thermal quality over a daily period. Artificial warming experiments were then used to measure the temperature at which common thermoregulatory behaviours are initiated and the subsequent reductions in body temperature. Behavioural means such as timing of activity, choice of substrates with optimum surface temperatures, shade seeking and postural adjustments (e.g. stilting, vertical orientation) were found to be highly effective at maintaining preferred body temperature. The maximum voluntarily tolerated temperature (MVT) was determined to be 44 degrees C +/- 0.4 degrees C, indicating the upper bounds of thermal flexibility in this species. Behavioural thermoregulation effectively enables small ectotherms to regulate exposure to changing environmental temperatures and utilize the spatially and temporally heterogeneous environments they occupy. Species such as the wingless grasshopper, although adapted to cool temperate conditions, are likely to be well equipped to respond successfully to coarse scale climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Temperature and developmental responses of body and cell size in <i>Drosophila</i>; effects of polyploidy and genome configuration,"Jalal, Marwa and Andersen, Tom and Hessen, Dag O.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Increased adult body size in Drosophila raised at lower temperatures could be attributed both to an increase in the cell volume and cell number. It is not clear, however, whether increased cell size is related to (or even caused by) increased nuclear volume and genome size (or configuration). Experiments with Drosophila melanogaster stocks (Oregon-R and w1118) raised at 16, 22, 24, and 28 degrees C resulted in larger adult body and wing size with lower temperature, while eye size was less affected. The increase in wing size reflected an increase in cell size in both males and females of both stocks. The nucleus size, genome size, and DNA condensation of adult flies, embryos, and Schneider 2 cells (52 cells, of larval origin) were estimated by flow cytometry. In both adult flies and S2 cells, both nucleus size and DNA condensation varied with temperature, while DNA content appears to be constant. From 12\% to 18\% of the somatic cells were tetraploid (4C) and 2-5\% were octoploid (8C), and for the Oregon strain we observed an increase in the fraction of polyploid cells with decreasing temperature. The observed increase in body size (and wing size) at low temperatures could partly be linked with the cell size and DNA condensation, while corresponding changes in the haploid genome size were not observed.

article,Thermographic analysis of the radiant heat of chicken and duck eggs in relation to the embryo's oxygen consumption,"Mortola, Jacopo P. and Kim, John and Lorzadeh, Alireza and Leurer, Catherine",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In eggs, the metabolic activities of the developing embryo produce heat (H) that is dissipated in various forms, including radiation. Given that much of the total heat radiated by an egg (H-tot) is heat acquired passively, we asked whether it was possible to detect the fraction produced metabolically (H-metab) and the extent of its correlation with the embryo's metabolic rate. In chicken and duck eggs at various incubation ages, under standardized experimental conditions of heat conduction and convection, H-metab was measured by thermography as the difference in H-toc between fertile and sterile eggs. Then, H-metab was correlated to the embryo's oxygen consumption ((V)(O2) over dot), measured by an open-circuit methodology. Heat loss by water evaporation was found to be less than 3\% of the total. During the first half of incubation Hmetab was too small to be significantly separated from H-tot. In the second half of incubation H-metab was significant, represented 30-50\% of the total energy consumed and correlated linearly with (V)(O2) over dot for a good fraction of incubation. We conclude that under standardized conditions of heat conduction and convection, in the second half of incubation thermography offers a simple tool not only to verify the progression of the embryo's incubation but also to estimate its metabolic rate.

article,Perceptual strain index for heat strain assessment in an experimental study: An application to construction workers,"Yang, Y. and Chan, Albert P. C.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Although the physiological strain index (PhSI) is universal and comprehensive, its restrictions are recognized in terms of invasive on-site measurements and the requirement of accurate instruments. The perceptual strain index (PeSI) has been proposed as a user-friendly and practical indicator for heat strain. However, the application of this index in assessing the heat strain of construction workers has yet to be examined and documented. This study aims to ascertain the reliability and applicability of PeSI in an experimental setting that simulates a stressful working environment (i.e., environment, work uniform, and work pace) experienced by construction workers. Ten males and two females performed intermittent exercise on a treadmill while wearing a summer work uniform at 34.5 degrees C and 75\% relative humidity in a climatic chamber. Physiological parameters (core temperature, heart rate) and perceptual variables (thermal sensation, perceived exertion) were collated synchronously at 3 min intervals. The results of two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (clothing x time) revealed that the PeSI was useful in differentiating the heat strain levels between different work uniforms. Not only did the PeSI change in the same general manner with the PhSI, but it was also powerful in reflecting different levels of physiological strain. Thus, the PeSI offers considerable promise for heat strain assessment under simulated working conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Study of thermal behavior of a biological tissue: An equivalence of Pennes bioheat equation and Wulff continuum model,"Das, Koushik and Mishra, Subhash C.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,Equivalence of Pennes bioheat equation (PBHE) and Wulff continuum model (WCM) is established for a 1-D planar tissue. The derived condition of equivalence is specific to tissue without metabolic heat generation. Mathematical analysis is carried out to relate blood perfusion rate and local mean blood velocity that are needed in the analysis of WCM. It is found that the local mean blood velocity in a tissue is a direct function of square root of blood perfusion rate. This functional dependence is also established numerically by having same solution obtained from PBHE and WCM. Analysis is also done to check how closely the derived relation can be used for practical cases of breast tissue with and without a tumor. Blood velocity is a very important physiological quantity. Its measurement is a difficult process and requires a state-of-the-art technique. The proposed relation allows its computation merely from the knowledge of blood perfusion rate.

article,Influence of cooling rate on activity of ionotropic glutamate receptors in brain slices at hypothermia,"Mokrushin, Anatoly A. and Pavlinova, Larisa I. and Borovikov, Sergey E.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Hypothermia is a known approach in the treatment of neurological pathologies. Mild hypothermia enhances the therapeutic window for application of medicines, while deep hypothermia is often accompanied by complications, including problems in the recovery of brain functions. The purpose of present study was to investigate the functioning of glutamate ionotropic receptors in brain slices cooled with different rates during mild, moderate and deep hypothermia. Using a system of gradual cooling combined with electrophysiological recordings in slices, we have shown that synaptic activity mediated by the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in rat olfactory cortex was strongly dependent on the rate of lowering the temperature. High cooling rate caused a progressive decrease in glutamate receptor activity in brain slices during gradual cooling from mild to deep hypothermia. On the contrary, low cooling rate slightly changed the synaptic responses in deep hypothermia. The short-term potentiation may be induced in slices by electric tetanization at 16 C in this case. Hence, low cooling rate promoted preservation of neuronal activity and plasticity in the brain tissue. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, some species retain the ability to induce other stress-responsive genes, some of which are involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Here, the effect of heat on cell cycle stage and its ability to induce apoptosis were tested in thermally stressed hepatocytes from a common Antarctic fish species from McMurdo Sound in the Ross Sea.

J. and Chaudhry, Mubarak and Cowen, Michael E. and Jarvis, Martin A. and Griffin, Steven and Morice, Alyn H.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Objective: Acute rises in pulmonary artery pressures following complex cardiac surgery are associated with high morbidity and mortality. We hypothesised that periods of deep hypothermia predispose to elevated pulmonary pressures upon rewarming. We investigated the effect of this hypothermic preconditioning on isolated human pulmonary arteries and isolated perfused lungs. Methods: Isometric tension was measured in human pulmonary artery rings (n=24). We assessed the constriction and dilation of these arteries at 37 C and 17 C. Isolated perfused human lung models consisted of lobes ventilated via a bronchial cannula and perfused with Krebs via a pulmonary artery cannula. Bronchial and pulmonary artery pressures were recorded. We investigated the effect of temperature using a heat exchanger. Results: Rewarming from 17 degrees C to 37 degrees C caused a 1.3 fold increase in resting tension (p < 0.05). Arteries constricted 8.6 times greater to 30 nM KCl, constricted 17 times greater to 1 nM Endothelin-1 and dilated 30.3 times greater to 100 mu M SNP at 37 degrees C than at 17 degrees C (p < 0.005). No difference was observed in the responses of arteries originally maintained at 37 degrees C compared to those arteries maintained at 17 degrees C and rewarmed to 37 degrees C. Hypothermia blunted the increase in pulmonary artery pressures to stimulants such as potassium chloride as well as to H-R but did not precondition arteries to higher pulmonary artery pressures upon re-warming. Conclusions: Deep hypothermia reduces the responsiveness of human pulmonary arteries but does not, however, precondition an exaggerated response to vasoactive agents upon re-warming.

article,Thermal manipulation during the middle incubation stage has a repressive effect on the immune organ development of Peking ducklings,"Liu, Junying and Yan, Xiping and Li, Qingqing and Wang, Guosong and Liu, Hehe and Wang, Jiwen and Li, Liang and Du, Xiaohui and Han, Chunchun and He, Hua",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Avian embryos are easily influenced by their environment during incubation. Previous studies have demonstrated that incubation temperature changes could influence muscle development and body weight, which subsequently determine the adult phenotype. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the development of immune organs in ducklings could be influenced by thermal manipulation during the middle stage of incubation. To evaluate this hypothesis, a control group was incubated under a normal temperature from Ell to E24, while the incubation temperature of the experimental group was increased by 1 C. Our results indicated that slight changes in the incubation temperature significantly repressed the bursa of Fabricius index of the duck embryo on E25 (F1, 58=122.51, P <0.0001) and significantly repressed the spleen index of neonatal ducklings (F1, 58=74.38, P <0.0001). At 0 day posthatching (dph) and 14 dph, ducklings hatched from eggs incubated under the higher temperature had a lower percentage of globulin than the control group (F1, 10=19.97, P=0.0111; Fl, 10=9.8, P=0.0352). The IFN-y concentration of ducklings at 14 dph displayed the same trend (Fl, 10=284.49, P < 0.0001). These results suggested that thermal manipulation during the middle stage of incubation had a repressive effect on the development of immune organs and reduced the concentrations of serum globulin and IFN-y. These results demonstrated that the subtle alteration of incubation temperature may weaken ducklings' immunity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We assessed the impact of size on temperature regulation in populations of normal-sized and large-bodied insular Mediterranean lizards (Podarcis gaigeae, Lacertidae). We hypothesized that large lizards would achieve higher body temperatures and thermoregulate more effectively than their smaller kin. Large- and small-bodied lizards share the same thermoregulation pattern, achieving similar body temperatures in the field. Large lizards, however, prefer higher set-point temperatures. Lizards in both populations thermoregulate effectively, but large lizards thermoregulated less effectively than normal-sized lizards. The particular conditions at the islet that harbors the large-bodied population (harsh intraspecific competition) seem to account for this pattern. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

article,High ambient temperature directly decreases milk synthesis in the mammary gland in Saanen goats,"Saipin, Nungnuch and Semsirmboon, Sapon and Rungsiwiwut, Ruttachuk and Thammacharoen, Sumpun",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The mammary gland is a privileged organ for mammals. Because of their high capacity for milk synthesis, dairy ruminants have been distributed throughout the world. In tropical areas, dairy animals face high ambient temperatures (HTa). The indirect effect of HTa on milk synthesis is mediated in part by a reduction in feed intake. The current experiment focused on the direct natural effect of HTa on mammary function. Multiparous Saanen goats were used in this study. The physiological responses for HTa were evaluated from the control period during the winter and from the natural HTa during the summer. Milk samples were collected for isolation of the goat milk cells to study the expression of the beta-1,4 galactosyltransferase (beta-GALT1), Akt, and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) genes. Although goats in the summer maintained rectal temperature and plasma cortisol levels similar to those observed in the winter, the higher respiratory rate and lower feed intake and milk yield (MY) from the goats in the summer indicated that the goats in the summer were exposed to a higher degree of HTa. This was supported by the significantly higher level of plasma glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity. Moreover, the relative expression levels of beta-GALT1 and Akt were not different. The relative expression of HSP70 during the summer was significantly higher than what was observed in cells isolated in the winter. In conclusion, the HTa effect on MY during the summer was related to its indirect effect on feed intake. The direct HTa effect might be related to HSP70 gene expression in goat milk cells and to plasma GPX activity. However, the natural HTa did not affect the expression of Akt or beta-GALT1.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102783,94,NA,NA,102783,Akt; Goat; High ambient temperature; Mammary function; Oxidative stress

Thermal stresses affect the function of various organs and change the expression profiles of hundreds of genes in the different tissues of broilers. Thermal manipulation (TM) during embryogenesis can increase heat tolerance in growing broilers. Small heat shock proteins (SHSPs) are a group of HSPs which participate in many cellular functions like response to different stressors. However, their role in the thermotolerance has not been fully elucidated. Ninety fertilized eggs were randomly divided into three groups (30 eggs/group; 10 eggs/replicate). Normal control (NC) eggs were incubated at 37.5 degrees C throughout the incubation period whereas heat stress (HS) and cold stress (CS) groups were kept at 41 degrees C and 33 degrees C from 15 to 17th day of incubation for 3 h each day, respectively. On day 20, samples from the cerebrums were harvested for histopathology and mRNA expression analyses of HSPB1, HSPB5, HSPB8, and HSPB9. There were no significant differences in survivability, defected embryos, hatchability, and body weight among treatments. TM had no major deleterious effects on the cerebral tissue except for mild degeneration in the HS group. HSPB1, HSPB5, HSPB8, and HSPB9 were expressed in the presence and absence of TM. All SHSP genes tested were down-regulated in response to TM except for HSPB9 which was upregulated in the HS group. The highest change in gene expression due to TM observed for HSPB1. This study presents a broader understanding of mechanisms underlying response to TM in broilers. The results suggest that HSPB1, HSPB5, HSPB8, and HSPB9 are involved in thermotolerance in broilers and SHSPs could be involved in the gene expression profiling of TM. It may propose the use of nutritional supplements in the poultry industry to modulate SHSPs.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102719,93,NA,NA,102719,"HSPB1; HSPB5; HSPB8; HSPB9, chicken; Thermal manipulation"

This was done not only for a specific dairy barn based on this indicator outside, but also in other dairy barns with a similar design, located in similar weather conditions. The results of the research indicate that the use of LR had a high accuracy of forecasting (93-96\%) the THI in NVB of various designs during the summer heat.

T-e was higher in open enclosures than in shaded enclosures. The T-b of lizards differed between the open and shaded enclosures in summer and autumn, but not in spring. In summer, crocodile lizards stayed in the water to avoid overheating, whereas in autumn, crocodile lizards perched on branches seeking optimal thermal environments. Crocodile lizards showed higher thermoregulatory effectiveness in open enclosures (with low thermal quality) than in shaded enclosures. Our study suggests that the crocodile lizard is capable of behavioural thermoregulation via microhabitat selection, although overall, it is not an effective thermoregulator.

According to WBE-theory suggested by West, Brown, and Enquist, E should be in the range from -0.6 to -0.7 eV. However, there are many examples of significant deviations of E from the predictions of the theory. Now we have conducted a study of this value using rats in different types of pharmacological hypothermia: 1. Short-term (for several hours) hypothermia induced by anesthetic xylazine; 2. Daily torpor-like state induced by the pharmacological composition developed in our previous study. It has been found that in pharmacological daily hypothermia E = -0.56 +/- 0.03 eV, which was close to that in daily heterotherms found in literature, E = -0.57 +/- 0.04 eV. In short-term hypothermia E was substantially lower, E = -0.17 +/- 0.071 eV. Our analysis revealed that in short-term hypothermia, changes in body temperature may lag behind changes in metabolic rate for a period Delta t affecting E. We propose an approach for estimating Delta t and obtaining an adjusted E = -0.68 +/- 0.17 eV, which corresponds to theoretical predictions. We assume that a similar consideration of t should be done when calculating E of daily heterotherms. We assume that in ectotherms, when the ambient temperature changes rapidly, changes in metabolic rate may lag behind changes in body temperature for a period (-).Delta t, that should also be considered in E calculations.

Since the survival time of patients with bony metastases has noticeably improved in recent years, these patients are at high risk of complications associated with this metastasis. Hence, the appropriate choice of treatment modality or combination of therapeutic approaches can lead to increasing bone pain relief, improving quality of life, etc. This study is aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of combined radiotherapy and hyperthermia for the treatment response of patients with painful bony metastases. Patients and methods: In a single-arm clinical trial, 23 eligible patients (14 female and 9 male) with the mean age of 67 years old and suffering from bony metastases were enrolled in the study. Two hours after radiotherapy, the patients underwent hyperthermia for 1 h in the supine position. All the patients completed the brief pain inventory (BPI) assessment tool and quality of life questionnaire (QLQ-C30) from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) at the baseline, end of the treatment and 1, 2 and 3 months thereafter. The response to the treatment was assessed as the zero score (complete response) or two or more than two-point drop of the worst pain within the preceding 24 h (partial response) during the 3-month posttreatment. Results: All the pain intensity and interference scores, except the pain interference with the enjoyment of life score, significantly decreased. A total of 18 out of 23 patients (78\%) achieved complete or partial response. The number of patients using pain relief medications decreased from 74\% (n =17) at the baseline to 48\% (n =11) 3 months later. Moreover, except for nausea and vomiting, appetite loss, diarrhea and financial impact problems, the patients' quality of life improved significantly in all the functional scales and symptoms within 3 months.

Dietary manipulation of curcumin has been proposed to ameliorate the immune status of chickens under heat stress. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effect of curcumin supplementation on TLR4 mediated non-specific immune response in liver of laying hens under high-temperature conditions. Experimental groups contained two controls groups (high temperature and thermo-neutral control (HC and NC) fed basal diet) and three high-temperature curcumin treatments groups (HT100, HT200 and HT300).

Pathological lesions and DNA damage of immune tissues were decreased in heat stress curcumin supplementation as compared to HC and NC group. Furthermore, PCNA, TLR4 and its downstream gene expression as well as protein expression (TLR4, NF-kappa B and PCNA) were significantly down regulated in heat stress curcumin supplemented group as compared to HC and NC group.

So, there was no need to feed it with experimental data to assess the whole-body thermal sensation. Meanwhile, in this method, the overall thermal sensation was predicted taking into account the cutaneous TRs thermal responses.
