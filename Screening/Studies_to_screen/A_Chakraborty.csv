article,Fish swimming mode and body morphology affect the energetics of swimming in a wave-surge water flow,"Schakmann, Mathias and Korsmeyer, Keith E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Fish swimming modes and the shape of both the fins and body are expected to affect their swimming ability under different flow conditions. These swimming strategies and body morphologies often correspond to distributional patterns of distinct functional groups exposed to natural and variable water flows. In this study, we used a swimming-respirometer to measure energetic costs during prolonged, steady swimming and while station holding in a range of simulated oscillatory wave-surge water flows, within the natural range of flow speeds and wave frequencies on coral reefs. We quantified the net cost of swimming (NCOS, metabolic costs above resting) for four reef fish species with differences in swimming mode and morphologies of the fin and body: a body and caudal fin (BCF) swimmer, the Hawaiian flagtail, Kuhlia xenura, and three pectoral fin swimmers, the kole tang, Ctenochaetus strigosus, the saddle wrasse, Thalassoma duperrey, and the Indo-Pacific sergeant major, Abudefduf vaigiensis. We found that the BCF swimmer had the highest rates of increase in NCOS with increasing wave frequency (i.e. increased turning frequency) compared with the pectoral fin swimmers. The wrasse, with a more streamlined, higher body fineness, had lower rates of increase in NCOS with increasing swimming speeds than the low body fineness species, but overall had the highest swimming NCOS, which may be a result of a higher aerobic swimming capacity. The deep-bodied (low fineness) pectoral fin swimmers (A. vaigiensis and C. strigosus) were the most efficient at station holding in oscillating, wave-surge water flows.",2023,10.1242/jeb.244739,226,6,NA,jeb244739,Wave surge; Cost of swimming; Respirometry; Maneuvering; Body fineness; Labriform
article,Light from down under,"Fine, Maoz and Sabbah, Shai and Shashar, Nadav and Hoegh-Guldberg, Ove",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Coral-algae symbiosis is a key feature of tropical corals and is highly dependent on the efficiency with which solar energy is attenuated by the coral. Scleractinian corals are among the most efficient light collectors in nature because of the modulation of the internal light field in the coral skeleton. Interestingly, coral skeleton particles composing the sandy bottoms in reef margins sustain these optical characteristics. In the present study, we examined two free-living coral species - Heterocyathus aequicostatus (Caryophyllidae) and Heteropsammia cochlea (Dendrophylliidae) - common on biogenic coarse carbonate sand of the Great Barrier Reef but absent from fine sand at the same depth. In coarse carbonate sand, light penetrates a few millimeters below the surface and propagates along horizontal distances of a few centimeters. In fine sand, almost all of the light is reflected back to the water column. For photosynthetic sand-dwelling organisms such as the studied species, with over one-third of their surface area facing the substrate, light flux to their underside may be beneficial. A correlation was found between the diameter of these corals and the distance that light may travel in the sand under the coral. Laboratory and field measurements show that the symbiotic algae on the underside of the corallites are photosynthetically active even when the coral is partially buried, implying sufficient light penetration. Other organisms in the study site, such as fungid corals and foraminiferans, with different morphologies, have different light-trapping strategies but are also photosynthesizing on their underside. The importance of the substrate type to the performance of the three main partners of the symbiosis (coral, endosymbiotic algae and a sipunculan worm) is highlighted, and is a striking example of co-evolution.",2013,10.1242/jeb.025106,216,23,4341-4346,NA,coral; light; Great Barrier Reef; Heterocyathus; Heteropsammia; Aspidosyphon
article,Identification and characterisation of a functional aquaporin water channel (<i>Anomala cuprea</i> DRIP) in a coleopteran insect,"Nagae, Tomone and Miyake, Seiji and Kosaki, Shiho and Azuma, Masaaki",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Water transport across the plasma membrane depends on the presence of the water channel aquaporin (AQP), which mediates the bulk movement of water through osmotic and pressure gradients. In terrestrial insects, which are solid and/or plant feeders, the entrance and exit of water is primarily executed along the alimentary tract, where the hindgut, particularly the rectum, is the major site of water conservation. A cDNA encoding the homologue of the water-specific Drosophila AQP [}Drosophila integral protein (DRIP)] was identified through the RT-PCR of RNA isolated from the rectum of the cupreous chafer larvae, Anomala cuprea, a humus and plant root feeder. This gene (Anocu AQP1) has a predicted molecular mass of 26.471 kDa, similar to the DRIP clade of insect AQPs characterised from caterpillars, flies and several liquid-feeding insects. When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, Anocu AQP1 showed the hallmarks of aquaporin-mediated water transport but no glycerol or urea permeability, and the reversible inhibition of elevated water transport through 1 mmol l(-1) HgCl2. This is the first experimental demonstration of the presence of a water-specific AQP, namely DRIP, in the Coleoptera. The genome of the model beetle Tribolium castaneum contains six putative AQP sequences, one of which (Trica-1a, XP\_972862) showed the highest similarity to Anocu AQP1 (similar to 60\% amino acid identity). Anocu AQP1 is predominantly expressed in the rectum. Using a specific antibody raised against DRIP in the silkworm Bombyx mori (AQP-Bom1), Anocu AQP1 was localised to the apical plasma membrane of rectal epithelial cells, and lacking in the midgut and gastric caecal epithelia. Based on the BeetleBase prediction, there are three putative AQPs (Trica-3a, 3b, 3c: XP\_970728, 970912, 970791) that are homologous to B. mori aquaglyceroporin {[} AQP-Bom2 (GLP)]. The immunocytochemical studies using the specific anti-peptide antibody against AQP-Bom2 revealed the presence of the GLP homologue at the apical plasma membrane of enterocytes in the midgut and gastric caeca. Thus, DRIP (Anocu AQP1) and the putative GLP share epithelial fluid-transporting roles along the alimentary tract in cupreous chafer larvae.",2013,10.1242/jeb.083386,216,14,2564-2572,NA,Drosophila integral protein; DRIP; aquaglyceroporin; rectum; midgut; gastric caeca; excretion; coleopteran AQP
article,Archer fish jumping prey capture: kinematics and hydrodynamics,"Shih, Anna M. and Mendelson, Leah and Techet, Alexandra H.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Smallscale archer fish, Toxotes microlepis, are best known for spitting jets of water to capture prey, but also hunt by jumping out of the water to heights of up to 2.5 body lengths. In this study, high-speed imaging and particle image velocimetry were used to characterize the kinematics and hydrodynamics of this jumping behavior. Jumping used a set of kinematics distinct from those of in-water feeding strikes and was segmented into three phases: (1) hovering to sight prey at the surface, (2) rapid upward thrust production and (3) gliding to the prey once out of the water. The number of propulsive tail strokes positively correlated with the height of the bait, as did the peak body velocity observed during a jump. During the gliding stage, the fish traveled ballistically; the kinetic energy when the fish left the water balanced with the change in potential energy from water exit to the maximum jump height. The ballistic estimate of the mechanical energy required to jump was comparable with the estimated mechanical energy requirements of spitting a jet with sufficient momentum to down prey and subsequently pursuing the prey in water. Particle image velocimetry showed that, in addition to the caudal fin, the wakes of the anal, pectoral and dorsal fins were of nontrivial strength, especially at the onset of thrust production. During jump initiation, these fins were used to produce as much vertical acceleration as possible given the spatial constraint of starting directly at the water's surface to aim.",2017,10.1242/jeb.145623,220,8,1411-1422,NA,Prey capture; Jumping; Archer fish; Rapid maneuvering; Particle image velocimetry
article,"Dehydration enhances multiple physiological defense mechanisms in a desert lizard, <i>Heloderma suspectum</i>","Moeller, Karla T. and Demare, Guillaume and Davies, Scott and DeNardo, Dale F.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The physiological challenges associated with dehydration can induce an increase in plasma glucocorticoid concentrations, a response thought to provide the mechanism for dehydration suppressing immune function. However, a comprehensive examination of the inter-relationship of dehydration, stress and immune function has not been conducted within a single species. We previously demonstrated that Gila monsters (Heloderma suspectum), which inhabit a xeric environment with a predictable seasonal drought, have enhanced measures of innate immunity when dehydrated. These results suggest that, in this species, dehydration may not induce a glucocorticoid response, but, instead, enhances physiological defense mechanisms. To explore this possibility, we examined multiple measures of innate immunity as well as initial and reactive plasma concentrations of glucocorticoids in captive and free-ranging Gila monsters at various hydration states. Our results show that, in this species, dehydration alone does not cause a substantial increase in plasma glucocorticoids, and we provide broader evidence that dehydration enhances defensive mechanisms including stress reactivity and various measures of innate immune function. These findings suggest that physiological responses to dehydration may depend heavily on an organism's ecology. More research on the effects of dehydration on the glucocorticoid response and immunity will help clarify the interactive roles they play in response to hydration challenges and whether adaptations to water-limited environments influence these interactions.",2017,10.1242/jeb.150367,220,12,2166-2174,NA,Dehydration; Innate immunity; Corticosterone; Reptile
article,Aquatic burst locomotion by hydroplaning and paddling in common eiders (<i>Somateria mollissima</i>),"Gough, William T. and Farina, Stacy C. and Fish, Frank E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Common eiders (Somateria mollissima) are heavy sea-ducks that spend a large portion of their time swimming at the water surface. Surface swimming generates a bow and hull wave that can constructively interfere and produce wave drag. The speed at which the wavelengths of these waves equal the waterline length of the swimming animal is the hull speed. To increase surface swimming speed beyond the hull speed, an animal must overtake the bow wave. This study found two distinct behaviors that eider ducks used to exceed the hull speed: (1) `steaming', which involved rapid oaring with the wings to propel the duck along the surface of the water, and (2) `paddle-assisted flying', during which the ducks lifted their bodies out of the water and used their feet to paddle against the surface while flapping their wings in the air. An average hull speed (0.732 +/- 0.046 m s(-1)) was calculated for S. mollissima by measuring maximum waterline length from museum specimens. On average, steaming ducks swam 5.5 times faster and paddle-assisted flying ducks moved 6.8 times faster than the hull speed. During steaming, ducks exceeded the hull speed by increasing their body angle and generating dynamic lift to overcome wave drag and hydroplane along the water surface. During paddle-assisted flying, ducks kept their bodies out of the water, thereby avoiding the limitations of wave drag altogether. Both behaviors provided alternatives to flight for these ducks by allowing them to exceed the hull speed while staying at or near the water surface.",2015,10.1242/jeb.114140,218,11,1632-1638,NA,Eider duck; Surface swimming; Ground effect; Hull speed; Steaming
article,Insight into post-transcriptional gene regulation: stress-responsive microRNAs and their role in the environmental stress survival of tolerant animals,"Biggar, Kyle K. and Storey, Kenneth B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Living animals are constantly faced with various environmental stresses that challenge normal life, including: oxygen limitation, very low or high temperature, as well as restriction of water and food. It has been well established that in response to these stresses, tolerant organisms regularly respond with a distinct suite of cellular modifications that involve transcriptional, translational and post-translational modification. In recent years, a new mechanism of rapid and reversible transcriptome regulation, via the action of non-coding RNA molecules, has emerged into post-transcriptional regulation and has since been shown to be part of the survival response. However, these RNA-based mechanisms by which tolerant organisms respond to stressed conditions are not well understood. Recent studies have begun to show that non-coding RNAs control gene expression and translation of mRNA to protein, and can also have regulatory influence over major cellular processes. For example, select microRNAs have been shown to have regulatory influence over the cell cycle, apoptosis, signal transduction, muscle atrophy and fatty acid metabolism during periods of environmental stress. As we are on the verge of dissecting the roles of non-coding RNA in environmental stress adaptation, this Commentary summarizes the hallmark alterations in microRNA expression that facilitate stress survival.",2015,10.1242/jeb.104828,218,9,1281-1289,NA,Anoxia; Environmental stress; Freeze-tolerance; Hibernation; Hypometabolism; MicroRNA

K. and Mouline, K.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Aestivation and dispersive migration are the two strategies evoked in the literature to explain the way in which malaria vectors Anopheles coluzzii and A. gambiae survive the harsh climatic conditions of the dry season in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the physiological mechanisms regulating these two strategies are unknown. In the present study, mosquito species were exposed to controlled environmental conditions mimicking the rainy and dry seasons of south western Burkina Faso. Survival strategies were studied through morphometric (wing length), ecophysiological (respiratory gas exchanges), biochemical (cuticular hydrocarbons composition) and molecular (AKH mRNA expression levels) parameters, variations of which are usually considered to be hallmarks of aestivation and dispersion mechanisms in various insects. Our results showed that ecophysiological and morphometric adjustments are made in both species to prevent water losses during the dry season. However, the usual metabolic rate modifications expected as signatures of aestivation and migration were not observed, highlighting specific and original physiological mechanisms sustaining survival in malaria mosquitoes during the dry season. Differences in epicuticular hydrocarbon composition and AKH levels of expression were found between the permanent and temporary A. coluzzii populations, illustrating the great phenotypic plasticity of this mosquito species. Altogether, our work underlines the diverse and complex pattern of changes occurring in the two mosquito species and at the population level to cope with the dry season and highlights potential targets of future control tools.",2018,10.1242/jeb.174433,221,6,NA,jeb174433,Aestivation; Migration; Adipokinetic hormone (AKH); Cuticular hydrocarbons; Metabolic rate
article,"Thyroid hormones correlate with field metabolic rate in ponies, <i>Equus ferus caballus</i>","Brinkmann, Lea and Gerken, Martina and Hambly, Catherine and Speakman, John R. and Riek, Alexander",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"During winter, free-living herbivores are often exposed to reduced energy supply at the same time that energy needs for thermoregulation increase. Several wild herbivores as well as robust horse breeds reduce their metabolism during times of low ambient temperature and food shortage. Thyroid hormones (THs) affect metabolic intensity and a positive effect of THs on basal metabolic rate (BMR) has been demonstrated in mammals and birds. As BMR and field metabolic rate (FMR) are often assumed to be intrinsically linked, THs may represent a reliable indicator for FMR. To test this hypothesis, 10 Shetland pony mares were kept under semi-extensive central European conditions. During the winter season, one group was fed 60\% and one group 100\% of their maintenance energy requirements. We measured FMR, locomotor activity, resting heart rate and TH levels in summer and winter. FMR, locomotor activity, resting heart rate and total T-3 concentrations decreased substantially in winter compared with summer, whereas total T-4 increased. Food restriction led to a reduced FMR and resting heart rate, while THs and locomotor activity were not affected. Across both seasons, FMR, resting heart rate and locomotor activity were positively correlated with total T-3 but negatively and more weakly correlated with total T-4.",2016,10.1242/jeb.138784,219,16,2559-2566,NA,Energy expenditure; Food restriction; Resting heart rate; Horses; Locomotor activity; Thyroxine; Triiodothyronine
article,Divergent physiological responses in laboratory rats and mice raised at high altitude,"Jochmans-Lemoine, Alexandra and Villalpando, Gabriella and Gonzales, Marcelino and Valverde, Ibana and Soria, Rudy and Joseph, Vincent",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Ecological studies show that mice can be found at high altitude (HA - up to 4000 m) while rats are absent at these altitudes, and there are no data to explain this discrepancy. We used adult laboratory rats and mice that have been raised for more than 30 generations in La Paz, Bolivia (3600 m), and compared their hematocrit levels, right ventricular hypertrophy (index of pulmonary hypertension) and alveolar surface area in the lungs. We also used whole-body plethysmography, indirect calorimetry and pulse oxymetry to measure ventilation, metabolic rate (O-2 consumption and CO2 production), heart rate and pulse oxymetry oxygen saturation (p(O2, sat)) under ambient conditions, and in response to exposure to sea level P-O2 (32\% O-2 = 160 mmHg for 10 min) and hypoxia (18\% and 15\% O-2 = 90 and 75 mmHg for 10 min each). The variables used for comparisons between species were corrected for body mass using standard allometric equations, and are termed mass-corrected variables. Under baseline, compared with rats, adult mice had similar levels of p(O2), sat, but lower hematocrit and hemoglobin levels, reduced right ventricular hypertrophy and higher mass-corrected alveolar surface area, tidal volume and metabolic rate. In response to sea level P-O2 and hypoxia, mice and rats had similar changes of ventilation, but metabolic rate decreased much more in hypoxia in mice, while p(O2), sat remained higher in mice. We conclude that laboratory mice and rats that have been raised at HA for > 30 generations have different physiological responses to altitude. These differences might explain the different altitude distribution observed in wild rats and mice.",2015,10.1242/jeb.112862,218,7,1035-1043,NA,Chronic hypoxia; Metabolism; Physiology; Respiration; Rodents
article,Gestation increases the energetic cost of breathing in the lizard <i>Tiliqua rugosa</i>,"Munns, Suzanne L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"High gestational loads result in fetuses that occupy a large proportion of the body cavity and may compress maternal organs. Compression of the lungs results in alterations in breathing patterns during gestation, which may affect the energetic cost of breathing. In this study, the energetic cost of breathing during gestation was determined in the viviparous skink Tiliqua rugosa. Radiographic imaging showed progressive lung compression during gestation and a 30\% reduction in the lung inflation index (rib number at which the caudal margin of the lung was imaged divided by total rib number). Pneumotachography and open flow respirometry were used to measure breathing patterns and metabolic rates. Gestation induced a twofold increase in minute ventilation via increases in breathing frequency, but no change in inspired tidal volume. The rates of O-2 consumption and CO2 production did not change significantly during gestation. Together, these results suggest that a relative hyperventilation occurs during gestation in T. rugosa, which in turn suggests that diffusion and/or perfusion limitations may exist at the lung during gestation. The energetic cost of breathing was estimated as a percentage of resting metabolic rate using hypercapnia to stimulate ventilation at different stages of pregnancy. The energetic cost of breathing in non-pregnant lizards was 19.96 +/- 3.85\% of resting metabolic rate and increased threefold to 62.80 +/- 10.11\% during late gestation. This significant increase in the energetic cost of breathing may have significant consequences for energy budgets during gestation.",2013,10.1242/jeb.067827,216,2,171-180,NA,ventilation; breathing pattern; oxygen consumption; hypercapnia; reptile; lung
article,"Allatostatin A-like immunoreactivity in the nervous system and gut of the larval midge <i>Chironomus riparius</i>: modulation of hindgut motility, rectal K<SUP>+</SUP> transport and implications for exposure to salinity","Robertson, Lisa and Chasiotis, Helen and Galperin, Vladimir and Donini, Andrew",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Evidence for the presence of allatostatin (AST) A-like neuropeptides in the larval midge Chironomus riparius is reported. Immunohistochemical studies on the nervous system and gut revealed the presence of AST A-like immunoreactive (AST-IR) cells and processes. The nerve cord contained AST-IR processes that originated from cells in the brain and travelled the length of nerve cord to the terminal ganglion. Within each ganglion, these processes gave rise to varicosities, suggesting that they formed synapses with neurons in the ganglia. Endocrine cells containing AST-IR were present in three regions of the midgut: near the attachment of the Malpighian tubules, between the anterior and posterior midgut, and in the vicinity of the gastric caecae. The terminal ganglion also contained four AST-IR cells that gave rise to axons that projected onto the hindgut and posterior midgut. Application of a cockroach AST to the semi-isolated hindgut of larval C. riparius led to dose-dependent inhibition of muscle contractions with an EC50 of similar to 10 nmol l(-1) and a decrease in rectal K+ reabsorption resulting from reduced rectal Na+/K+-ATPase and vacuolar type H+-ATPase activities. The results suggest the presence of endogenous AST-like neuropeptides in larval C. riparius, where these factors play a role in the function of the gut. Furthermore, regulation of ion reabsorption by ASTs at the rectum could serve as an ideal mechanism of ion regulation in the face of abrupt and acute elevated salt levels.",2014,10.1242/jeb.108985,217,21,3815-3822,NA,Na+/K+-ATPase; V-ATPase; Ion transport; Epithelium; Muscle; Ion regulation

Variation in melanisation has been linked with stress resistance, especially desiccation, in D. melanogaster and other species. As melanism has a genetic component, we selected melanic and non-melanic phenotypes of D. melanogaster in order to confirm the association of desiccation resistance and rate of water loss with cuticular melanisation previously reported for this species. A bidirectional selection experiment for dark (D-1-D-4) and light (L-1-L-4) body colour in D. melanogaster was conducted for 60 generations. We observed a 1.6-fold increase in abdominal melanisation in selected dark strains and a 14-fold decrease in selected light strains compared with control populations. Desiccation resistance increased significantly in the dark-selected morphs as compared with controls. The observed increase in desiccation resistance appeared as a consequence of a decrease in cuticular permeability. Our results show that traits related to water balance were significantly correlated with abdominal melanisation and were simultaneously selected bidirectionally along with melanisation.",2013,10.1242/jeb.076166,216,7,1244-1254,NA,artificial selection experiment; abdominal melanisation; correlated responses; desiccation resistance; Drosophila melanogaster
article,Similar foraging energetics of two sympatric albatrosses despite contrasting life histories and wind-mediated foraging strategies,"Kroeger, Caitlin E. and Crocker, Daniel E. and Orben, Rachael A. and Thompson, David R. and Torres, Leigh G. and Sagar, Paul M. and Sztukowski, Lisa A. and Andriese, Timothy and Costa, Daniel P. and Shaffer, Scott A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Understanding the environmental and behavioral factors that influence how organisms maintain energy balance can inform us about their potential resiliency to rapid environmental changes. Flexibility in maintaining energy balance is particularly important to long-lived, central-place foraging seabirds that are constrained when locating food for offspring in a dynamic ocean environment. To understand the role of environmental interactions, behavioral flexibility and morphological constraints on energy balance, we used doubly labeled water to measure the at-sea daily energy expenditure (DEE) of two sympatrically breeding seabirds, Campbell (Thalassarche impavida) and grey-headed (Thalassarche chrysostoma) albatrosses. We found that species and sexes had similar foraging costs, but DEE varied between years for both species and sexes during early chick rearing in two consecutive seasons. For both species, greater DEE was positively associated with larger proportional mass gain, lower mean wind speeds during water take-offs, greater proportions of strong tailwinds (>12 m s(-1)), and younger chick age. Greater proportional mass gains were marginally more costly in male albatrosses that already have higher wing loading. DEE was higher during flights with a greater proportion of strong headwinds for grey-headed albatrosses only. Poleward winds are forecasted to intensify over the next century, which may increase DEE for grey-headed albatrosses that heavily use this region during early chick rearing. Female Campbell albatrosses may be negatively affected by forecasted slackening winds at lower latitudes due to an expected greater reliance on less energy efficient sit-and-wait foraging strategies.

article,Parental stressor exposure simultaneously conveys both adaptive and maladaptive larval phenotypes through epigenetic inheritance in the zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>),"Bautista, Naim M. and Burggren, Warren W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Genomic modifications occur slowly across generations, whereas short-term epigenetic inheritance of adaptive phenotypes may be immediately beneficial to large numbers of individuals, acting as a bridge for survival when adverse environments occur. In the present study, crude oil was used as an example of an environmental stressor. Adult zebrafish (P-0) were dietarily exposed for 3 weeks to no, low, medium or high concentrations of crude oil. The F-1 offspring obtained from the P-0 groups were then assessed for transgenerational epigenetic transfer of oil-induced phenotypes. The exposure did not alter body length, body and organ mass or condition factor in the P-0 groups. However, the P-0 fecundity of both sexes decreased in proportion to the amount of oil fed. The F-1 larvae from each P-0 were then exposed from 3 hpf to 5 dpf to oil in their ambient water. Remarkably, F-1 larvae derived from oil-exposed parents, when reared in oiled water, showed a 30\% enhanced survival compared with controls (P<0.001). Unexpectedly, from day 3 to 5 of exposure, F-1 larvae from oil-exposed parents showed poorer survival in clean water (up to 55\% decreased survival). Additionally, parental oil exposure induced bradycardia (presumably maladaptive) in F-1 larvae in both clean and oiled water. We conclude that epigenetic transgenerational inheritance can lead to an immediate and simultaneous inheritance of both beneficial and maladaptive traits in a large proportion of the F-1 larvae. The adaptive responses may help fish populations survive when facing transient environmental stressors.",2019,10.1242/jeb.208918,222,17,NA,jeb208918,Transgenerational inheritance; Crude oil; Epigenetics; Hypoxia; Larva; Heart rate; Environmental stressor

Triploid fish have been reported to exhibit lower thermal tolerance than diploids, offering a potential model organism to better understand the physiological drivers of thermal tolerance. Here, we compared triploid and diploid juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in freshwater to investigate the proposed link between aerobic capacity and thermal tolerance. We measured specific growth rates (SGR) and resting (aerobic) metabolic rates (RMR) in freshwater at 3, 7 and 9 weeks of acclimation to 10, 14 and 18 degrees C. Additionally, maximum metabolic rates (MMR) were measured at 3 and 7 weeks of acclimation, and critical thermal maxima (CTmax) were measured at 9 weeks. Mass, SGR and RMR differed between ploidies across all temperatures at the beginning of the acclimation period, but all three metrics were similar across ploidies by week 7. Aerobic scope (MMR-RMR) remained consistent across ploidies, acclimation temperatures and time. At 9 weeks, CTmax was independent of ploidy, but correlated positively with acclimation temperature despite the similar aerobic scope between acclimation groups. Our findings suggest that acute thermal tolerance is not modulated by aerobic scope, and the altered genome of triploid Atlantic salmon does not translate to reduced thermal tolerance of juvenile fish in freshwater.",2018,10.1242/jeb.166975,221,5,NA,jeb166975,Critical thermal maxima; Elevated temperature; Oxygen consumption; Salmonids; Ploidy

Here, we examined the structure and function of Hbs in an amphibious, facultative airbreathing fish, the blue-spotted mudskipper (Boleophthalmus pectinirostris). We also characterized the genomic organization of the globin gene clusters of the species and we integrated phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses to unravel the duplicative history of the genes that encode the subunits of structurally distinct mudskipper Hb isoforms (isoHbs). The B. pectinirostris isoHbs exhibit high intrinsic O-2 affinities, similar to those of hypoxia-tolerant, water-breathing teleosts, and remarkably large Bohr effects. Genomic analysis of conserved synteny revealed that the genes that encode the alpha-type subunits of the two main adult isoHbs are members of paralogous gene clusters that represent products of the teleost-specific whole-genome duplication. Experiments revealed no appreciable difference in the oxygenation properties of co-expressed isoHbs in spite of extensive amino acid divergence between the alternative alpha-chain subunit isoforms. It therefore appears that the ability to switch between aquatic and aerial respiration does not necessarily require a division of labor between functionally distinct isoHbs with specialized oxygenation properties.",2020,10.1242/jeb.217307,223,2,NA,jeb217307,Air-breathing fish; Bimodal breathing; Bohr effect; Blood-oxygen transport; Hemoglobin; Whole-genome duplication

P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Dietary restriction (DR) is a key focus in ageing research. Specific conditions and genotypes were recently found to negate lifespan extension by DR, questioning its universal relevance. However, the concept of dietary reaction norms explains why the effects of DR might be obscured in some situations. We tested the importance of dietary reaction norms by measuring longevity and fecundity on five diets in five genotypes, with and without water supplementation in female Drosophila melanogaster (N>25,000). We found substantial genetic variation in the response of lifespan to diet. Flies supplemented with water rescued putative desiccation stress on the richest diets, suggesting that water availability can be an experimental confound. Fecundity declined on these richest diets, but was unaffected by water, and this reduction is thus most likely to be caused by nutritional toxicity. Our results demonstrate empirically that a range of diets need to be considered to conclude an absence of the DR longevity effect.",2020,10.1242/jeb.230185,223,23,NA,jeb230185,Ageing; Dietary restriction; Fruit fly; Overfeeding; Reaction norm; Starvation

Thus, because tropical birds have higher annual survival and lower rates of metabolism, we hypothesized that cells from tropical species would have greater cellular resistance to chemical injury than cells from temperate species. We cultured dermal fibroblasts from 26 tropical and 26 temperate species of birds and examined cellular resistance to cadmium, H2O2, paraquat, thapsigargin, tunicamycium, methane methylsulfonate (MMS) and UV light. Using ANCOVA, we found that the values for the dose that killed 50\% of cells (LD50) from tropical birds were significantly higher for H2O2 and MMS. When we tested for significance using a generalized least squares approach accounting for phylogenetic relationships among species to model LD50, we found that cells from tropical birds had greater tolerance for Cd, H2O2, paraquat, tunicamycin and MMS than cells from temperate birds. In contrast, tropical birds showed either lower or no difference in tolerance to thapsigargin and UV light in comparison with temperate birds. These findings are consistent with the idea that natural selection has uniquely fashioned cells of long-lived tropical bird species to be more resistant to forms of oxidative and non-oxidative stress than cells from shorter-lived temperate species.",2013,10.1242/jeb.079889,216,8,1373-1380,NA,tropical birds; temperate birds; life-history variation; cellular resistance
article,Fat content of striped mice decreases during the breeding season but not during the food-restricted dry season,"Rimbach, Rebecca and Blanc, Stephane and Zahariev, Alexandre and Robin, Jean-Patrice and Pillay, Neville and Schradin, Carsten",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Individuals that are capable of accumulating appropriate fat stores are assumed to have selective advantages when food becomes scarce. Similarly to species from temperate zones, some species inhabiting arid areas accumulate fat stores prior to periods of food limitation. Yet, we have little knowledge concerning seasonal variation in body composition and the relationship between fat store size and disappearance risk in species from arid habitats. Using the water dilution method, we examined the body composition of African striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio) living in a seasonal habitat with a long food-restricted dry season. We tested for seasonal changes in body composition (N=159 measurements of 113 individuals) and whether dry season survival was related to fat mass (N=66 individuals). Fat stores were similar in size at the onset and the end of the dry season, but surprisingly smaller at the onset of the moist breeding season. Fat stores showed a negative relationship with food availability. Individual variation in fat stores was not associated with disappearance risk, but there was a positive association of disappearance risk with body mass. Increased disappearance risk of heavy individuals suggests elevated dispersal rates in competitive individuals. This study suggests that non-breeding philopatric striped mice do not accumulate large fat stores prior to the food-limited dry season but that they might mobilize fat stores at the onset of the breeding season to satisfy the energetic demands of reproduction and/or to decrease costs associated with larger fat stores, such as increased predation risk.",2019,10.1242/jeb.208504,222,24,NA,jeb208504,Disappearance; Energetics; Fat reserves; Lipid analysis; Method validation; Survival

Mammals were found to share similar high rates of Na+ flux (3.0-3.7 nmol Na+ mg(-1) protein min(-1)) at their normal body temperatures (36-39 degrees C). These Na+ flux rates were significantly greater (P<0.0004-0.0001) than those of the ectotherms, which shared similar low rates of Na+ flux (0.7-1.3 nmol Na+ mg(-1) protein min(-1)) at their very different normal acclimated body temperatures (15 degrees C for trout, 25 degrees C for toad and 37 degrees C for the lizard species). Trout, which possess highly unsaturated membranes (similar to those ofmammals), showed a Na+ flux with high thermal sensitivity at low temperatures similar to that found in mammals at higher temperatures. The thermal sensitivity of toad Na+ flux was significantly less (P<0.05-0.01) than that of rat and rabbit. Trout Na+ flux did not increase with increasing temperature much above 20 degrees C, whereas all other species measured increased their Na+ flux with increasing temperature up to 40 degrees C. In conclusion, at normal operating body temperatures, the rate of Na+ flux is much lower in ectotherms.",2016,10.1242/jeb.136747,219,14,2098-2102,NA,Tissue metabolism; Sodium pump metabolism; Hepatocytes; Lizard; Toad; Rat; Mouse; Trout; Rabbit
article,The fallacy of the <i>P</i><sub>crit</sub> - are there more useful alternatives?,"Wood, Chris M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"P-crit - generally defined as the P-O2 below which the animal can no longer maintain a stable rate of O-2 consumption ((M)over dot(O2)), such that (M)over dot(O2) becomes dependent upon P-O2 - provides a single number into which a vast amount of experimental effort has been invested. Here, with specific reference to water-breathers, I argue that this focus on the P-crit is not useful for six reasons: (1) calculation of P-crit usually involves selective data editing; (2) the value of P-crit depends greatly on the way it is determined; (3) there is no good theoretical justification for the concept; (4) P-crit is not the transition point from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism, and it disguises what is really going on; (5) P-crit is not a reliable index of hypoxia tolerance; and (6) P-crit carries minimal information content. Preferable alternatives are loss of equilibrium (LOE) tests for hypoxia tolerance, and experimental description of full (M)over dot(O2) versus P-O2 profiles accompanied by measurements of ventilation, lactate appearance and metabolic rate by calorimetry. If the goal is to assess the ability of the animal to regulate (M) over dot(O2 )from this profile in a mathematical fashion, promising, more informative alternatives to P-crit are the regulation index and Michaelis-Menten or sigmoidal allosteric analyses.",2018,10.1242/jeb.163717,221,22,NA,jeb163717,Critical oxygen tension; Standard metabolic rate; Routine metabolic rate; Active metabolic rate; Regulation index; Michaelis-Menten analysis; Oxyconformation; Oxyregulation; Water-breathers

This study presents a 1H/2H-NMR methodology for measuring lipid synthesis in black soldier fly larvae using diluted deuterated water (2H2O) as a stable isotopic tracer delivered through the feeding media. This approach was validated by measuring 2H incorporation into the larvae's body water and consequent labelling of FA esterified into triacylglycerols. A 5\% 2H enrichment in the body water, adequate to label the FA, is achieved after 24 h in a substrate with 10\% 2H2O. A standard feeding trial using an invasive macroalgae was designed to test this method, revealing de novo lipogenesis was lower in larvae fed with macroalgae, probably related to the poor nutritional value of the diet.",2024,10.1242/jeb.247941,227,12,NA,jeb247941,De novo lipogenesis; Deuterated water; Edible insects; Gracilaria vermiculophylla; Metabolic flux; Stratiomyidae; BSF
article,The utility and determination of <i>P</i><sub>crit</sub> in fishes,"Ultsch, Gordon R. and Regan, Matthew D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The critical O-2 tension (P-crit) is the lowest P-O2 at which an animal can maintain some benchmark rate of O-2 uptake (<(M)under dot>(O2)). This PO2 has long served as a comparator of hypoxia tolerance in fishes and aquatic invertebrates, but its usefulness in this role, particularly when applied to fishes, has recently been questioned. We believe that Pcrit remains a useful comparator of hypoxia tolerance provided it is determined using the proper methods and hypoxia tolerance is clearly defined. Here, we review the available methods for each of the three steps of P-crit determination: (1) measuring the most appropriate benchmark <(M)under dot>(O2) state for Pcrit determination (<(M)under dot>(O2,std), the <(M)under dot>(O2) required to support standard metabolic rate); (2) reducing water PO2; and (3) calculating Pcrit from the <(M)under dot>(O2) versus P-O2 curve. We make suggestions on best practices for each step and for how to report Pcrit results to maximize their comparative value. We also discuss the concept of hypoxia tolerance and how Pcrit relates to a fish's overall hypoxia tolerance. When appropriate methods are used, Pcrit provides useful comparative physiological and ecological information about the aerobic contributions to a fish's hypoxic survival. When paired with other hypoxia-related physiological measurements (e.g. lactate accumulation, calorimetry-based measurements of metabolic depression, loss-of-equilibrium experiments), Pcrit contributes to a comprehensive understanding of how a fish combines aerobic metabolism, anaerobic metabolism and metabolic depression in an overall strategy for hypoxia tolerance.",2019,10.1242/jeb.203646,222,22,NA,jeb203646,Critical oxygen tension; Fish; Hypoxia; P-crit Respirometry; Standard metabolic rate

The ability of insect ionoregulatory organs (e.g. the Malpighian tubules) to maintain ion balance in the cold has been linked to improved chill tolerance, and many neuroendocrine factors are known to influence ion transport rates of these organs. Injection of micromolar doses of CAPA (an insect neuropeptide) have been previously demonstrated to improve Drosophila cold tolerance, but the mechanisms through which it impacts chill tolerance are unclear, and low doses of CAPA have been previously demonstrated to cause anti-diuresis in insects, including dipterans. Here, we provide evidence that low (femtomolar) and high (micromolar) doses of CAPA impair and improve chill tolerance, respectively, via two different effects on Malpighian tubule ion and water transport. While low doses of CAPA are anti-diuretic, reduce tubule K+ clearance rates and reduce chill tolerance, high doses facilitate K+ clearance from the haemolymph and increase chill tolerance. By quantifying CAPA peptide levels in the central nervous system, we estimated the maximum achievable hormonal titres of CAPA and found further evidence that CAPA may function as an antidiuretic hormone in Drosophila melanogaster. We provide the first evidence of a neuropeptide that can negatively affect cold tolerance in an insect and further evidence of CAPA functioning as an anti-diuretic peptide in this ubiquitous insect model.",2018,10.1242/jeb.185884,221,19,NA,jeb185884,Abiotic stress; Insect; Ion homeostasis; Temperature; Neuropeptides
article,Nutrient depletion and heat stress impair the assimilation of nitrogen compounds in a scleractinian coral,"Crehan, Oscar and Davy, Simon K. and Grover, Renaud and Ferrier-Pages, Christine",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Concentrations of dissolved nitrogen in seawater can affect the resilience of the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis to climate change-induced bleaching. However, it is not yet known how the assimilation and translocation of the various nitrogen forms change during heat stress, nor how the symbiosis responds to nutrient depletion, which may occur due to increasing water stratification. Here, the tropical scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata , in symbiosis with dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium , was grown at different temperatures (26 degrees C, 30 degrees C and 34 degrees C), before being placed in nutrient-replete or -depleted seawater for 24 h. The corals were then incubated with 13 C-labelled sodium bicarbonate and different 15 N-labelled nitrogen forms (ammonium, urea and dissolved free amino acids) to determine their assimilation rates. We found that nutrient depletion inhibited the assimilation of all nitrogen sources studied and that heat stress reduced the assimilation of ammonium and dissolved free amino acids. However, the host assimilated over 3fold more urea at 30 degrees C relative to 26 degrees C. Overall, both moderate heat stress (30 degrees C) and nutrient depletion individually decreased the total nitrogen assimilated by the symbiont by 66\%, and combined, they decreased assimilation by 79\%. This led to the symbiotic algae becoming nitrogen starved, with the C:N ratio increasing by over 3fold at 34 degrees C, potentially exacerbating the impacts of coral bleaching.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246466,227,8,NA,jeb246466,Coral bleaching; Dinoflagellate; Ammonium; Urea; Amino acids; Stylophora pistillata

For one such predator the medicinal leech, Hirudo verbana - behavioral responses to visual and mechanical cues from water waves are well documented. Here, we quantitatively characterized the response patterns of a multisensory interneuron, the S cell, to mechanically and visually cued water waves. As a function of frequency, the response profile of the S cell replicated key features of the behavioral prey localization profile in both visual and mechanical modalities. In terms of overall firing rate, the S cell response was not direction selective, and although the direction of spike propagation within the S cell system did follow the direction of wave propagation under certain circumstances, it is unlikely that downstream neuronal targets can use this information. Accordingly, we propose a role for the S cell in the detection of waves but not in the localization of their source. We demonstrated that neither the head brain nor the tail brain are required for the S cell to respond to visually cued water waves.",2018,10.1242/jeb.171728,221,4,NA,jeb171728,Hirudo verbana; Electrophysiology; S cell; Sensory systems; Aquatic predators
article,"Cardiorespiratory interactions in the Pacific spiny dogfish, <i>Squalus suckleyi</i>","Acharya-Patel, Neha and Deck, Courtney A. and Milsom, William K.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Elasmobranchs are a group of cartilaginous fish with no direct sympathetic innervation of the heart or gills. Fast cardiorespiratory regulation is controlled solely by the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system. Cardiovascular changes associated with ventilation are commonly present in the form of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and as cardiorespiratory synchrony (CRS. in which there is a 1:1 beat to breath ratio). The latter has been hypothesized to maximize oxygen uptake, coupling the pulsatile flows of blood and water in the gills. Given this, we hypothesized that CRS should be more prevalent in situations of low oxygen supply and RSA should be abolished by vagotomy. To test this, we investigated the role of the vagus nerve in mediating cardiorespiratory responses to changing environmental oxygen conditions in the elasmobranch Squalus suckleyi. Hypoxia and hyperoxia had little effect on heart rate but did alter breathing frequency and amplitude. Atropine yielded an overall tachycardia in all oxygen conditions and abolished all heart rate variability (HRV), suggesting that HRV solely reflects fluctuating vagal tonus on the heart. Regardless of the presence of atropine, hypoxia still induced an increase in ventilation rate and depth. CRS was only found during progressive hyperoxia post-atropine, when heart rate was uninhibited and ventilation was slowed owing to the increase in oxygen supply, suggesting that in S. suckleyi, CRS is an epiphenomenon and not actively regulated to maximize gas exchange efficiency.",2018,10.1242/jeb.183830,221,17,NA,jeb183830,Cardiorespiratory synchrony; Dogfish; Hypoxia; Hyperoxia; Heart rate variability; Vagus nerve
article,Altered thermoregulation as a driver of host behaviour in glochidia-parasitised fish,"Horky, Pavel and Slavik, Ondrej and Douda, Karel",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Parasites alter their host behaviour and vice versa as a result of mutual adaptations in the evolutionary arms race. One of these adaptations involves changes in host thermoregulation, which has the potential to harm the parasite and thereby act as a defence mechanism. We used a model of the brown trout (Salmo trutta) experimentally parasitised with glochidia ectoparasitic larvae from the endangered freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera) to reveal whether parasitisation alters fish behavioural thermoregulation. A study using radiotelemetry temperature sensors was performed during almost one year of the M. margaritifera parasitic stage. Glochidia-infested S. trutta altered their thermoregulation through active searching for habitats with different thermal regimes. The general preference for temperatures in infested fish varied and was either above or below the temperature preferred by uninfested individuals. Infested fish also preferred different temperatures across localities, whereas uninfested fish maintained their thermal preference no matter which stream they inhabited. Glochidia further induced the expression of a behavioural syndrome among S. trutta personality traits, suggesting that it might increase the probability that the fish host would occur in the glochidia temperature optimum. Our findings present the first evidence that thermoregulation plays a fundamental role in the relationship of affiliated mussels and their fish hosts. Incorporating thermoregulation as a factor in the study of this relationship can help to interpret results from previous behavioural studies, as well as to optimise management measures related to endangered mussels.",2019,10.1242/jeb.184903,222,1,NA,jeb184903,Host-parasite interaction; Thermoregulation; Behavioural fever; Freshwater pearl mussel; Telemetry
article,The analysis and interpretation of critical temperatures,"Kingsolver, Joel G. and Umbanhowar, James",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Critical temperatures are widely used to quantify the upper and lower thermal limits of organisms. But measured critical temperatures often vary with methodological details, leading to spirited discussions about the potential consequences of stress and acclimation during the experiments. We review a model based on the simple assumption that failure rate increases with increasing temperature, independent of previous temperature exposure, water loss or metabolism during the experiment. The model predicts that mean critical thermal maximal temperature (CTmax) increases non-linearly with starting temperature and ramping rate, a pattern frequently observed in empirical studies. We then develop a statistical model that estimates a failure rate function (the relationship between failure rate and current temperature) using maximum likelihood; the best model accounts for 58\% of the variation in CTmax in an exemplary dataset for tsetse flies. We then extend the model to incorporate potential effects of stress and acclimation on the failure rate function; the results show how stress accumulation at low ramping rate may increase the failure rate and reduce observed values of CTmax. We also applied the model to an acclimation experiment with hornworm larvae that used a single starting temperature and ramping rate; the analyses show that increasing acclimation temperature significantly reduced the slope of the failure rate function, increasing the temperature at which failure occurred. The model directly applies to critical thermal minima, and can utilize data from both ramping and constant-temperature assays. Our model provides a new approach to analyzing and interpreting critical temperatures.",2018,10.1242/jeb.167858,221,12,NA,jeb167858,Critical maximum and minimum temperatures; Critical thermal maximum; Heat stress; Statistical model
article,Physiological and behavioral evidence for multiple spectral channels in the larval stomatopod visual system,"McDonald, Marisa S. and Cohen, Jonathan H. and Porter, Megan L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Larval stomatopods have generally been described as having a typical larval crustacean compound eye, which lacks the visual pigment diversity and morphological specializations of the well-studied stomatopod adult eye. However, recent work has suggested that larval stomatopod eyes are more complex than previously described. In this study, we provide physiological and behavioral evidence of at least three distinct photoreceptor classes in three species of larval stomatopods: Gonodactylellus n. sp., Gonodactylaceus falcatus and Pullosquilla n. sp. First, electroretinogram recordings were used to measure the spectral sensitivity of each species. Evidence for at least three spectral classes were identified in each: an ultraviolet, peaking at 340-376 nm; a short-wavelength blue, peaking at 455-464 nm; and a long-wavelength orange, peaking at 576-602 nm. Next, the behavioral response to light was investigated. We found that each species demonstrated positive phototactic responses to monochromatic stimuli across the UV-visible spectrum. In wavelength preference trials, distinct preferences among species were identified when different colored light stimuli were presented simultaneously. All species displayed a strong response to the UV stimulus, as well as responses to blue and orange stimuli, although at different response strengths, but no response to green. The results of this study demonstrate that larval stomatopods not only have multiple physiologically active spectral classes but they also display clear and distinct responses to wavelengths across the spectrum. We propose that the spectral classes demonstrated in each are related to visually guided ecological tasks of the larvae, which may differ between species.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245371,226,10,NA,jeb245371,KEY WORDS; Vision; Electroretinogram; Phototaxis; Stomatopod; Larvae
article,Are the surface areas of the gills and body involved with changing metabolic scaling with temperature?,"Li, Ge and Lv, Xiao and Zhou, Jing and Shen, Cong and Xia, Danyang and Xie, Hang and Luo, Yiping",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The metabolic-level boundaries (MLB) hypothesis proposes that metabolic level mediates the relative influence of surface area (SA)versus volume-related metabolic processes on the body-mass scaling of metabolic rate in organisms. The variation in the scaling of SA may affect how metabolic level affects the metabolic scaling exponent. This study aimed to determine the influence of increasing metabolic level at a higher temperature on the metabolic scaling exponent of the goldfish and determine the link between metabolic scaling exponents and SA parameters of both gills and body. The SA of gills and body and the resting metabolic rate (RMR) of the goldfish were assessed at 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C, and their mass scaling exponents were analyzed. The results showed a significantly higher RMR, with a lower scaling exponent, in the goldfish at a higher temperature. The SA of the gills and the total SA of the fish (TSA) were reduced with the increasing temperature. The scaling exponent of RMR (b(RMR)) tended to be close to that of the TSA at a higher temperature. This suggests that temperature positively affects metabolic level but negatively affects b(RMR). The findings support the MLB hypothesis. The lower scaling exponent at a higher temperature can be alternatively explained as follows: the higher viscosity of cold water impedes respiratory ventilation and oxygen uptake and reduces metabolic rate more in smaller individuals than in larger individuals at lower temperature, thus resulting in a negative association between temperature and b(RMR).",2018,10.1242/jeb.174474,221,8,NA,jeb174474,Fish; Body size; Respiration; Allometric

The ecological success of this economically valuable species may depend on their ability to tolerate hypoxia and perform fitness-dependent activities in hypoxic waters. We tested whether there is a link between hypoxia tolerance (HT) and oxygen consumption rate (M-O2) of juvenile striped bass measured while swimming in normoxic and hypoxic water, and to identify the interindividual variation and repeatability of these measurements. HT (loss of equilibrium) of fish (N=18) was measured twice collectively, 11 weeks apart, between which M-O2 was measured individually for each fish while swimming in low flow (10.2 cm s(-1)) and high flow (similar to 67\% of critical swimming speed, U-crit) under normoxia and hypoxia. Both HT and M-O2 varied substantially among individuals. HT increased across 11 weeks while the rank order of individual HT was significantly repeatable. Similarly, M-O2 increased in fish swimming at high flow in a repeatable fashion, but only within a given level of oxygenation. M-O2 was significantly lower when fish were swimming against high flow under hypoxia. There were no clear relationships between HT and M-O2 while fish were swimming under any conditions. Only the magnitude of increase in HT over 11 weeks and an individual's M-O2 under low flow were correlated. The results suggest that responses to the interacting stressors of hypoxia and exercise vary among individuals, and that HT and change in HT are not simple functions of aerobic metabolic rate.",2020,10.1242/jeb.217125,223,5,NA,jeb217125,Metabolic rate; Exercise; Oxygen consumption rate

The accumulation of cold-induced injuries by hemimetabolous insects is associated with loss of Na+ and K+ homeostasis. Here we show that this model holds true for Drosophila; cold exposure increases haemolymph {[}K+] in D. melanogaster, and cold-acclimated flies maintain low haemolymph {[}Na+] and {[}K+], both at rest and during a cold exposure. This pattern holds across 24 species of the Drosophila phylogeny, where improvements in cold tolerance have been consistently paired with reductions in haemolymph {[}Na+] and [}K+]. Cold-acclimated D. melanogaster have low activity of Na+/K+- ATPase, which may contribute to the maintenance of low haemolymph [}Na+] and underlie improvements in cold tolerance. Modifications to ion balance are associated with both phenotypic plasticity within D. melanogaster and evolutionary differences in cold tolerance across the Drosophila phylogeny, which suggests that adaptation and acclimation of cold tolerance in insects may occur through similar mechanisms. Coldtolerant flies maintain haemolymph osmolality despite low haemolymph [}Na+] and {[}K+], possibly through modest accumulations of organic osmolytes. We propose that this could have served as an evolutionary route by which chill-susceptible insects developed more extreme cold tolerance strategies.",2015,10.1242/jeb.115790,218,3,423-432,NA,Critical thermal minimum; Osmotic homeostasis; Sodium pump; Water balance
article,Acute stress and restricted diet reduce bill-mediated heat dissipation in the song sparrow (<i>Melospiza melodia</i>): implications for optimal thermoregulation,"Zuluaga, Juan D. and Danner, Raymond M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"We used thermal imaging to show that two environmental factors acute stress and diet - influence thermoregulatory performance of a known thermal window, the avian bill. The bill plays important roles in thermoregulation and water balance. Given that heat loss through the bill is adjustable through vasoconstriction and vasodilation, and acute stress can cause vasoconstriction in peripheral body surfaces, we hypothesized that stress may influence the bill's role as a thermal window. We further hypothesized that diet influences heat dissipation from the bill, given that body condition influences the surface temperature of another body region (the eye region). We measured the surface temperature of the bills of song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) before, during and after handling by an observer at 37 degrees C ambient temperature. We fed five birds a restricted diet intended to maintain body mass typical of wild birds, and we fed six birds an unrestricted diet for 5 months prior to experiments. Acute stress caused a decrease in the surface temperature of the bill, resulting in a 32.4\% decrease in heat dissipation immediately following acute stress, before recovering over approximately 2.3 min. The initial reduction and subsequent recovery provide partial support for the hemoprotective and thermoprotective hypotheses, which predict a reduction or increase in peripheral blood flow, respectively. Birds with unrestricted diets had larger bills and dissipated more heat, indicating that diet and body condition influence bill-mediated heat dissipation and thermoregulation. These results indicate that stress-induced vascular changes and diet can influence mechanisms of heat loss and potentially inhibit optimal thermoregulation.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245316,226,3,NA,jeb245316,Thermal window; Bird; Thermal imaging; Body condition; Disturbance; Thermovascular physiology
article,The teleost fish intestine is a major oxalate-secreting epithelium,"Whittamore, Jonathan M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Oxalate is a common constituent of kidney stones, but the mechanism of its transport across epithelia is not well understood. With prior research on the role of the intestine focused on mammals, the present study considered oxalate handling by teleost fish. Given the osmotic challenge of seawater (SW), marine teleosts have limited scope for urinary oxalate excretion relative to freshwater (FW) taxa. The marine teleost intestine was hypothesized as the principal route for oxalate elimination, thus demanding epithelial secretion. To test this, intestinal C-14-oxalate flux was compared between FW- and SW-acclimated sailfin molly (Poecilia latipinna). In SW, oxalate was secreted at remarkable rates (367.90 +/- 22.95 pmol cm(-2) h(-1)), which were similar following FW transfer (387.59 +/- 27.82 pmol cm(-2) h(-1)), implying no regulation by salinity. Nevertheless, this ability to secrete oxalate at rates 15-19 times higher than the mammalian small intestine supports this proposal of the teleost gut as a major, previously unrecognized excretory pathway.",2020,10.1242/jeb.216895,223,12,NA,jeb216895,Bicarbonate secretion; Sic26; Anion exchange; Calcium carbonate; Ussing chamber; DIDS
article,Contrasting strategies of osmotic and ionic regulation in freshwater crabs and shrimps: gene expression of gill ion transporters,"Mantovani, Milene and McNamara, John Campbell",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Owing to their extraordinary niche diversity, the Crustacea are ideal for comprehending the evolution of osmoregulation. The processes that effect systemic hydro-electrolytic homeostasis maintain hemolymph ionic composition via membrane transporters located in highly specialized gill ionocytes. We evaluated physiological and molecular hyper- and hypo-osmoregulatory mechanisms in two phylogenetically distant, freshwater crustaceans, the crab Dilocarcinus pagei and the shrimp Macrobrachium jelskii, when osmotically challenged for up to 10 days. When in distilled water, D. pagei survived without mortality, hemolymph osmolality and {[}Cl-] increased briefly, stabilizing at initial values, while {[}Na+] decreased continually. Expression of gill V-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), Na+/K+-ATPase and Na+/K+/2Cl(-) symporter genes was unchanged. In M. jelskii, hemolymph osmolality, {[}Cl-] and {[}Na+] decreased continually for 12 h, the shrimps surviving only around 15-24 h exposure. Gill transporter gene expression increased 2- to 5-fold. After 10 days exposure to brackish water (25 parts per thousand S), D. pagei was isosmotic, iso-chloremic and iso-natriuremic. Gill V-ATPase expression decreased while Na+/K+-ATPase and Na+/K+/2Cl(-) symporter expression was unchanged. In M. jelskii (20 parts per thousand S), hemolymph was hypo-regulated, particularly {[}Cl-]. Transporter expression initially increased 3- to 12-fold, declining to control values. Gil V-ATPase expression underlies the ability of D. pagei to survive in fresh water while V-ATPase, Na+/K+-ATPase and Na+/K+/2Cl(-) symporter expression enables M. jelskii to confront hyper/ hypo-osmotic challenges.

article,Photoreceptors and diurnal variation in spectral sensitivity in the fiddler crab <i>Gelasimus dampieri</i>,"Jessop, Anna-Lee and Ogawa, Yuri and Bagheri, Zahra M. and Partridge, Julian C. and Hemmi, Jan M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Colour signals, and the ability to detect them, are important for many animals and can be vital to their survival and fitness. Fiddler crabs use colour information to detect and recognise conspecifics, but their colour vision capabilities remain unclear. Many studies have attempted to measure their spectral sensitivity and identify contributing retinular cells, but the existing evidence is inconclusive. We used electroretinogram (ERG) measurements and intracellular recordings from retinular cells to estimate the spectral sensitivity of Gelasimus dampieri and to track diurnal changes in spectral sensitivity. G. dampieri has a broad spectral sensitivity and is most sensitive to wavelengths between 420 and 460 nm. Selective adaptation experiments uncovered an ultraviolet (UV) retinular cell with a peak sensitivity shorter than 360 nm. The species' spectral sensitivity above 400 nm is too broad to be fitted by a single visual pigment and using optical modelling, we provide evidence that at least two medium-wavelength sensitive (MWS) visual pigments are contained within a second blue-green sensitive retinular cell. We also found a similar to 25 nm diurnal shift in spectral sensitivity towards longer wavelengths in the evening in both ERG and intracellular recordings. Whether the shift is caused by screening pigment migration or changes in opsin expression remains unclear, but the observation shows the diel dynamism of colour vision in this species. Together, these findings support the notion that G. dampieri possesses the minimum requirement for colour vision, with UV and blue/green receptors, and help to explain some of the inconsistent results of previous research.",2020,10.1242/jeb.230979,223,23,NA,jeb230979,Uca; Colour vision; Screening pigment; Retinular cells; Opsin; Ultraviolet

From an ecological perspective, oxidative stress may serve as an important constraint to life-history traits, such as lifespan, reproduction and the immune system, and is gaining interest as a potential mechanism underlying life-history trade-offs. Of late, there has been much interest in understanding the role of oxidative stress in the ecology of wild animals, particularly during challenging periods such as reproduction. Here, we used a long-term study population of a fish with sole-male parental care, the smallmouth bass, Micropterus dolomieu, to examine the associations among oxidative stress indicators and life-history variables in nest-guarding males. In addition, we investigated the potential role of oxidative stress as a physiological mediator of the life-history trade-off decision of paternal smallmouth bass to stay with or abandon their brood. We found that oxidative stress was significantly related to the life history of paternal smallmouth bass, such that older, larger fish with greater reproductive experience and larger broods nesting in cooler water temperatures had lower levels of oxidative stress. However, we found no significant correlation between oxidative stress and nesting success, suggesting that oxidative stress may not be involved in the decision of male smallmouth bass to abandon their brood. Wild fish have been relatively understudied in the emerging field of oxidative ecology, and this study makes noteworthy contributions by revealing interesting connections between the life histories of paternal smallmouth bass and their oxidative status.",2017,10.1242/jeb.153775,220,10,1905-1914,NA,Oxidative stress; Smallmouth bass; Life history; 8-OHdG; Antioxidant
article,Fatty acid oxidation: a neglected factor in understanding the adjustment of mitochondrial function to cold temperatures,"Mast, Heather and Holody, Claudia D. and Lemieux, Helene",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"For ectothermic species, adaptation to thermal changes is of critical importance. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which leverages multiple electron pathways to produce energy needed for survival, is among the crucial metabolic processes impacted by temperature. Our aim in this study was to identify how changes in temperature affect the less-studied electron transferring flavoprotein pathway, fed by fatty acid substrates. We used the planarian Dugesia tignna, acclimated for 4 weeks at 10 degrees C (cold acclimated) or 20 degrees C (normothermic). Respirometry experiments were conducted at an assay temperature of either 10 or 20 degrees C to study specific states of the OXPHOS process using the fatty acid substrates palmitoylcarnitine (long chain), octanoylcarnitine (medium chain) or acetylcarnitine (short chain). Following cold acclimation, octanoylcarnitine exhibited increases in both the OXPHOS and electron transfer (ET, non-coupled) states, indicating that the pathway involved in medium-chain length fatty acids adjusts to cold temperatures. Acetylcarnitine only showed an increase in the OXPHOS state as a result of cold acclimation, but not in the ET state, indicative of a change in phosphorylation system capacity rather than fatty acid beta-oxidation. Palmitoylcarnitine oxidation was unaffected. Our results show that cold acclimation in D. tignna caused a specific adjustment in the capacity to metabolize medium-chain fatty acids rather than an adjustment in the activity of the enzymes carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase, carnitine acyltransferase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-2. Here, we provide novel evidence of the alterations in fatty acid beta-oxidation during cold acclimation in D. tignna.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244934,225,21,NA,jeb244934,Mitochondrial respiration; Thermal acclimation; OXPHOS
article,Diet mediates thermal performance traits: implications for marine ectotherms,"Hardison, Emily A. and Kraskura, Krista and Van Wert, Jacey and Nguyen, Tina and Eliason, Erika J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Thermal acclimation is a key process enabling ectotherms to cope with temperature change. To undergo a successful acclimation response, ectotherms require energy and nutritional building blocks obtained from their diet. However, diet is often overlooked as a factor that can alter acclimation responses. Using a temperate omnivorous fish, opaleye (Gireila nigricans), as a model system, we tested the hypotheses that (1) diet can impact the magnitude of thermal acclimation responses and (2) traits vary in their sensitivity to both temperature acclimation and diet. We fed opaleye a simple omnivorous diet (ad libitum Aftemia sp. and Ulva sp.) or a carnivorous diet (ad libitum Artemia sp.) at two ecologically relevant temperatures (12 and 20 degrees C) and measured a suite of whole-animal (growth, sprint speed, metabolism), organ (cardiac thermal tolerance) and cellular-level traits (oxidative stress, glycolytic capacity). When opaleye were offered two diet options compared with one, they had reduced cardiovascular thermal performance and higher standard metabolic rate under conditions representative of the maximal seasonal temperature the population experiences (20 degrees C). Further, sprint speed and absolute aerobic scope were insensitive to diet and temperature, while growth was highly sensitive to temperature but not diet, and standard metabolic rate and maximum heart rate were sensitive to both diet and temperature. Our results reveal that diet influences thermal performance in trait-specific ways, which could create diet trade-offs for generalist ectotherms living in thermally variable environments. Ectotherms that alter their diet may be able to regulate their performance at different environmental temperatures.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242846,224,21,NA,jeb242846,Temperature; Thermal acclimation; Fish; Thermal limits; Girella nigricans; Omnivore

Here, we examined the spatial pattern of opsin expression and photoreceptor spectral sensitivities in Heliconius erato, a nymphalid with duplicate ultraviolet opsin genes, UVRh1 and UVRh2. We found that the H. erato compound eye is sexually dimorphic. Females express the two UV opsin proteins in separate photoreceptors, but males do not express UVRh1. Intracellular recordings confirmed that females have three short wavelength-sensitive photoreceptors (lambda(max)= 356, similar to 390 and 470 nm), while males have two (lambda(max)= 390 and similar to 470 nm). We also found two long wavelength-sensitive photoreceptors (green, lambda(max)similar to 555 nm, and red, lambda(max) similar to 600 nm), which express the same LW opsin. The red cell's shifted sensitivity is probably due to perirhabdomal filtering pigments. Sexual dimorphism of the UV-absorbing rhodopsins may reflect the females' need to discriminate conspecifics from co-mimics. Red-green color vision may be used to detect differences in red coloration on Heliconius wings, or for host-plant identification. Among nymphalids so far investigated, only H. erato is known to possess five spectral classes of photoreceptor; sexual dimorphism of the eye via suppression of one class of opsin (here UVRh1 in males) has not - to our knowledge - been reported in any animal.",2016,10.1242/jeb.136523,219,15,2377-2387,NA,Rhodopsin; Opsin; Electrophysiology; Nymphalidae; Insect; Color vision
article,Embryo oxygenation in pipefish brood pouches: novel insights,"Braga Goncalves, Ines and Ahnesjo, Ingrid and Kvarnemo, Charlotta",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The pipefish brood pouch presents a unique mode of parental care that enables males to protect, osmoregulate, nourish and oxygenate the developing young. Using a very fine O-2 probe, we assessed the extent to which males of the broad-nosed pipefish (Syngnathus typhle) oxygenate the developing embryos and are able to maintain pouch fluid O-2 levels when brooding in normoxia (100\% O-2 saturation) and hypoxia (40\% O-2 saturation) for 24 days. In both treatments, pouch fluid-O-2 saturation levels were lower compared with the surrounding water and decreased throughout the brooding period, reflecting greater offspring demand for O-2 during development and/or decreasing paternal ability to provide O-2 to the embryos. Male condition (hepatosomatic index) was negatively affected by hypoxia. Larger males had higher pouch fluid O-2 saturation levels compared with smaller males, and levels were higher in the bottom section of the pouch compared with other sections. Embryo size was positively correlated with O-2 availability, irrespective of their position in the pouch. Two important conclusions can be drawn from our findings. First, our results highlight a potential limitation to brooding within the pouch and dismiss the notion of closed brood pouches as well-oxygenated structures promoting the evolution of larger eggs in syngnathids. Second, we provide direct evidence that paternal care improves with male size in this species. This finding offers an explanation for the documented strong female preference for larger partners because, in terms of oxygenation, the brood pouch can restrict embryo growth.",2015,10.1242/jeb.120907,218,11,1639-1646,NA,Embryo development; Fish; Hypoxia; Male size; Normoxia; Paternal care; Syngnathidae

We tested the hypothesis that these trade-offs are mediated by environmental heterogeneity, using isogenic strains of the amphibious fish Kryptolebias marmoratus that vary in the amount of time each can survive out of water. Consistent with pace of life theory, the strain that survived air exposure the longest generally exhibited a `slow' phenotype, including the lowest metabolic rate, largest scope for metabolic depression, slowest consumption of energy stores and least investment in reproduction under standard conditions. Growth rates were fastest in the otherwise slow strain. however. We then tested for fitness trade-offs between last' and `slow' strains using microcosms where fish were held either with constant water availability or under fluctuating conditions where water was absent for half of the experiment. Under both conditions the slow strain grew larger and was in better condition, and under fluctuating conditions the slow strain produced more embryos. However, the fast strain had larger adult population sizes under both conditions, indicating that fecundity is not the sole determinant of population size in this species. We conclude that genetically based differences in the pace of life of amphibious fish determine survival duration out of water. Relatively slow fish tended to perform better under conditions of limited water availability, but there was no detectable cost under control conditions.

The functional cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis, which forms coral reefs, is based on the bi-directional exchange of nutrients. During thermal stress this exchange breaks down; however, major gaps remain in our understanding of the roles of free metabolite pools in symbiosis and homeostasis. In this study we applied gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to explore thermally induced changes in intracellular pools of amino and non-amino organic acids in each partner of the model sea anemone Aiptasia sp. and its dinoflagellate symbiont. Elevated temperatures (32 degrees C for 6 days) resulted in symbiont photoinhibition and bleaching. Thermal stress induced distinct changes in the metabolite profiles of both partners, associated with alterations to central metabolism, oxidative state, cell structure, biosynthesis and signalling. Principally, we detected elevated pools of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the symbiont, indicative of modifications to lipogenesis/lysis, membrane structure and nitrogen assimilation. In contrast, reductions of multiple PUFAs were detected in host pools, indicative of increased metabolism, peroxidation and/or reduced translocation of these groups. Accumulations of glycolysis intermediates were also observed in both partners, associated with photoinhibition and downstream reductions in carbohydrate metabolism. Correspondingly, we detected accumulations of amino acids and intermediate groups in both partners, with roles in gluconeogenesis and acclimation responses to oxidative stress. These data further our understanding of cellular responses to thermal stress in the symbiosis and generate hypotheses relating to the secondary roles of a number of compounds in homeostasis and heat-stress resistance.",2016,10.1242/jeb.128660,219,4,516-527,NA,Aiptasia; Symbiodinium; Photoinhibition; Coral; GC-MS
article,Distinct physiological strategies are used to cope with constant hypoxia and intermittent hypoxia in killifish (<i>Fundulus heteroclitus</i>),"Borowiec, Brittney G. and Darcy, Kimberly L. and Gillette, Danielle M. and Scott, Graham R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Many fish encounter hypoxia on a daily cycle, but the physiological effects of intermittent hypoxia are poorly understood. We investigated whether acclimation to constant (sustained) hypoxia or to intermittent diel cycles of nocturnal hypoxia (12 h normoxia: 12 h hypoxia) had distinct effects on hypoxia tolerance or on several determinants of O-2 transport and O-2 utilization in estuarine killifish. Adult killifish were acclimated to normoxia, constant hypoxia, or intermittent hypoxia for 7 or 28 days in brackish water (4 ppt). Acclimation to both hypoxia patterns led to comparable reductions in critical O-2 tension and resting O-2 consumption rate, but only constant hypoxia reduced the O-2 tension at loss of equilibrium. Constant (but not intermittent) hypoxia decreased filament length and the proportion of seawater-type mitochondrion-rich cells in the gills (which may reduce ion loss and the associated costs of active ion uptake), increased blood haemoglobin content, and reduced the abundance of oxidative fibres in the swimming muscle. In contrast, only intermittent hypoxia augmented the oxidative and gluconeogenic enzyme activities in the liver and increased the capillarity of glycolytic muscle, each of which should facilitate recovery between hypoxia bouts. Neither exposure pattern affected muscle myoglobin content or the activities of metabolic enzymes in the brain or heart, but intermittent hypoxia increased brain mass. We conclude that the pattern of hypoxia exposure has an important influence on the mechanisms of acclimation, and that the optimal strategies used to cope with intermittent hypoxia may be distinct from those for coping with constant hypoxia.",2015,10.1242/jeb.114579,218,8,1198-1211,NA,Hypoxia tolerance; Respiration; Energy metabolism; Gill morphology; Haematology; Muscle histology

W. and Couturier, Christine S. and Nilsson, Goeran E. and Farrell, Anthony P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The aneural heart of the Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii, varies heart rate fourfold during recovery from anoxia. Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, which play an important role in establishing the pacemaker rate of vertebrate hearts, were postulated to be present in this ancestral vertebrate heart, and it was also theorized that changes in hagfish heart rate with oxygen availability involved altered HCN expression. Partial gene cloning revealed six HCN isoforms in the hagfish heart. Hagfish representatives of HCN2, HCN3 and HCN4 were discovered, with HCN2 and HCN3 existing as isoforms designated as HCN2a, HCN2b, HCN3a, two paralogs of HCN3b, and HCN3c. Phylogenetic analysis revealed HCN3b and HCN3c to be ancestral, followed by HCN3a, HCN4 and HCN2. Moreover, HCN3a expression was dominant in both the atrial and ventricular chambers, suggesting that the HCN4 dominance in adult mammalian hearts appeared after hagfish divergence. HCN expression was higher in the atrium than in the ventricle, as might be expected given that atrial beating rate is known to be faster than the ventricular rate. In addition, mRNA expression under normoxic conditions was compared with that following 24 h of anoxia, and either a 2-h or 36-h recovery in normoxic water. In the ventricle, anoxia decreased HCN3a but not HCN4 expression. In contrast, atrial HCN3a expression significantly increased following 2 h of recovery, before returning to control levels following 36 h of recovery, possibly contributing to heart rate changes previously observed under these conditions.",2013,10.1242/jeb.094912,216,23,4462-4472,NA,fish; cardiac control; pacemaker; real-time reverse transcriptase PCR; anoxia; HCN channel; phylogeny
article,Ammonia excretion in aquatic invertebrates: new insights and questions,"Weihrauch, Dirk and Joseph, Garett and Allen, Patrick",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Invertebrates employ a variety of ammonia excretion strategies to facilitate their survival in diverse aquatic environments, including freshwater, seawater and the water film surrounding soil particles. Various environmental properties set innate challenges for an organism's ammonia excretory capacity. These include the availability of NaCl and the respective ion-permeability of the organism's transport epithelia, and the buffering capacity of their immediate surrounding medium. To this end, some transporters seem to be conserved in the excretory process. This includes the Na+/K+(NH4+)-ATPase (NKA), the NH3/CO2 dual gas-channel Rhesus (Rh)-proteins and novel ammonia transporters (AMTs), which have been identified in several invertebrates but appear to be absent from vertebrates. In addition, recent evidence strongly suggests that the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated K+ channel (HCN) plays a significant role in ammonia excretion and is highly conserved throughout the animal kingdom. Furthermore, microtubule-dependent vesicular excretion pathways have been found in marine and soil-dwelling species, where, unlike freshwater systems, acid-trapping of excreted ammonia is difficult or absent owing to the high environmental buffering capacity of the surroundings. Finally, although ammonia is known to be a toxic nitrogenous waste product, certain marine species readily maintain potentially toxic hemolymph ammonia as a sort of ammonia homeostasis, which suggests that ammonia is involved in physiological processes and does not exist simply for excretion. Such findings are discussed within this Commentary and are hypothesized to be involved in acid-base regulation. We also describe excretory organs and processes that are dependent on environmental constraints and indicate gaps in the current knowledge in these topics.",2018,10.1242/jeb.169219,221,2,NA,jeb169219,Ammonia excretion; Ammonia transporters; Rhesus proteins; Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel; Microtubule network

K.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In nature, the green crab exhibits emersion and terrestrial activity at low tide. Treadmill exercise in air (20-23 degrees C) of crabs acclimated to 32 ppt seawater (13 degrees C) revealed an inverse relationship between velocity and duration: 2.0 body lengths (BL) s(-1) was sustainable for several minutes, and 0.25 BL s(-1) was sustainable for long periods. Fatigue was not due to dehydration. Physiological responses over an 18 h recovery in seawater after near-exhaustive exercise (0.25 BL s(-1), 1 h) in air were compared with responses after quiet emersion (1 h) in air. Exercising crabs exhibited transient scaphognathite slowing and progressive increases in heart rate, whereas emersed crabs exhibited persistent inhibition of ventilation and transient heart slowing. Upon return to seawater, all these rates increased above both control and treatment levels. Post-exercise disturbances were more marked and/or longer lasting (e.g. EPOC, hyperventilation, tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, lactate elevation, ionic disturbances) than those after simple air exposure. However, an increase in net acidic equivalent excretion to the environment occurred after emersion but not after exercise. Instead, post-exercise crabs relied on carapace buffering, signalled by elevated haemolymph Ca2+ and Mg2+. Prolonged lowering of haemolymph P-CO2 associated with hyperventilation also played a key role in acid-base recovery. EPOC after exercise was 3-fold greater than after emersion, sufficient to support resting (M)over dot(O2) for >14 h. This reflected clearance of a large lactate load, likely by glycogen re-synthesis rather than oxidation.

article,Bats coordinate sonar and flight behavior as they forage in open and cluttered environments,"Falk, Benjamin and Jakobsen, Lasse and Surlykke, Annemarie and Moss, Cynthia F.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Echolocating bats use active sensing as they emit sounds and listen to the returning echoes to probe their environment for navigation, obstacle avoidance and pursuit of prey. The sensing behavior of bats includes the planning of 3D spatial trajectory paths, which are guided by echo information. In this study, we examined the relationship between active sonar sampling and flight motor output as bats changed environments from open space to an artificial forest in a laboratory flight room. Using high-speed video and audio recordings, we reconstructed and analyzed 3D flight trajectories, sonar beam aim and acoustic sonar emission patterns as the bats captured prey. We found that big brown bats adjusted their sonar call structure, temporal patterning and flight speed in response to environmental change. The sonar beam aim of the bats predicted the flight turn rate in both the open room and the forest. However, the relationship between sonar beam aim and turn rate changed in the forest during the final stage of prey pursuit, during which the bat made shallower turns. We found flight stereotypy developed over multiple days in the forest, but did not find evidence for a reduction in active sonar sampling with experience. The temporal patterning of sonar sound groups was related to path planning around obstacles in the forest.

However, it is widely overlooked despite recent evidence that some marine ectotherms may be demonstrating climate-driven bathymetric range shifts. Wide-ranging effects of increased hydrostatic pressure have been observed from the molecular through to the behavioural level. Still, no study has simultaneously examined these multiple levels of organisation in a single experiment in order to understand the kinetics, hierarchy and interconnected nature of such responses during an acute exposure, and over a subsequent recovery period. Here, we quantify the transcription of a set of previously characterised genes during and after acute pressure exposure in adults of the shrimp Palaemonetes varians. Further, we perform respiratory rate and behavioural analysis over the same period. Increases in expression of genes associated with stress and metabolism were observed during and after high-pressure exposure. Respiratory rate increased during exposure and into the recovery period. Finally, differential behaviour was observed under elevated hydrostatic pressure in comparison to ambient pressure. Characterising generalised responses to acute elevated pressure is a vital precursor to longer-term, acclimation-based pressure studies. Results provide a novel insight into what we term the overall stress response (OSR) to elevated pressure; a concept that we suggest to be applicable to other environmental stressors.

However, the mechanism behind this mitochondrial flexibility is not well understood. Here, we used three insect species with different thermal tolerances (the honey bee, Apis mellifera ; the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster ; and the potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata ) to characterize the thermal sensitivity of different metabolic enzymes. Specifically, we measured activity of enzymes involved in glycolysis (hexokinase, HK; pyruvate kinase, PK; and lactate dehydrogenase, LDH), pyruvate oxidation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (pyruvate dehydrogenase, PDH; citrate synthase, CS; malate dehydrogenase, MDH; and aspartate aminotransferase, AAT), and the electron transport system (Complex I, CI; Complex II, CII; mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, mG3PDH; proline dehydrogenase, ProDH; and Complex IV, CIV), as well as that of ATP synthase (CV) at 18, 24, 30, 36, 42 and 45 degrees C. Our results show that at high temperature, all three species have significantly increased activity of enzymes linked to FADH 2 oxidation, specifically CII and mG3PDH. In fruit flies and honey bees, this coincides with a significant decrease of PDH and CS activity, respectively, that would limit NADH production. This is in line with the switch from NADH-linked substrates to FADH 2 -linked substrates previously observed with mitochondrial oxygen consumption. Thus, we demonstrate that even though the three insect species have a different metabolic regulation, a similar response to high temperature involving CII and mG3PDH is observed, denoting the importance of these proteins for thermal tolerance in insects.",2024,10.1242/jeb.247221,227,10,NA,jeb247221,Metabolic pathways; Honey bee; Fruit fly; Potato beetle; Temperature; Glycolysis; Tricarboxylic acid cycle; Mitochondria

The thermal history of a species sums the evolutionary history and, importantly, the thermal events recently experienced by individuals, including short-term acclimation to environmental variations. Thermal history is perhaps of greatest importance for species inhabiting thermally challenging environments and therefore assumed to be living close to their thermal limits, such as in the tropics. To test the importance of thermal history, the responses of the tropical oyster Isognomon nucleus to short-term differences in thermal environments were investigated. Critical and lethal temperatures and oxygen consumption were improved in oysters that previously experienced elevated air temperatures, and were associated with an enhanced heat shock response, indicating that recent thermal history affects physiological performance as well as inducing short-term acclimation to acute conditions. These responses were, however, associated with trade-offs in feeding activity, with oysters that experienced elevated temperatures showing reduced energy gain. Recent thermal history, therefore, seems to rapidly invoke physiological mechanisms that enhance survival of short-term thermal challenge but also longer term climatic changes and consequently needs to be incorporated into assessments of species' thermal performances.",2016,10.1242/jeb.128892,219,5,686-694,NA,Ecological relevance; Energy absorption efficiency; Heat-shock response; Microclimate; Thermal response; Trade-offs
article,Glyphosate impairs learning in <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquito larvae a field-realistic doses,"Baglan, Hugo and Lazzari, Claudio R. and Guerrieri, Fernando J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide in the world. Over the past few years, the number of studies revealing deleterious effects of glyphosate on non-target species has been increasing. Here, we studied the impact of glyphosate at field-realistic doses on learning in mosquito larvae (Aedes aegypti). Larvae of A. aegypti live in small bodies of water and perform a stereotyped escape response when a moving object projects its shadow on the water surface. Repeated presentations of an innocuous visual stimulus induce a decrease in response due to habituation, a non-associative form of leaming. In this study, different groups of larvae were reared in water containing different concentrations of glyphosate that are commonly found in the field (50 mu g l(-1),100 mu g l(-1), 210 mu g l(-1) and 2 mu g l(-1)). Larvae reared in a glyphosate solution of 2 mg l(-1) (application dose) could complete their development. However, glyphosate at a concentration of 100 mu g l(-1) impaired habituation. A dose-dependent deleterious effect on leaming ability was observed. This protocol opens new avenues to further studies aimed at understanding how glyphosate affects non-target organisms, such as insects. Habituation in mosquito larvae could serve as a parameter for testing the impact of pollutants in the water.",2018,10.1242/jeb.187518,221,20,NA,jeb187518,Habituation; Ecotoxicology; Pesticide; Herbicide; Fresh-water; Behaviour; Bio-indicator
article,The microbiome buffers tadpole hosts from heat stress: a hologenomic approach to understand host-microbe interactions under warming,"Fontaine, Samantha S. and Kohl, Kevin D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Phenotypic plasticity is an important strategy that animals employ to respond and adjust to changes in their environment. Plasticity may occur via changes in host gene expression or through functional changes in their microbiomes, which contribute substantially to host physiology. Specifically, the presence and function of host associated microbes can impact how animals respond to heat stress. We previously demonstrated that `depleted' tadpoles, with artificially disrupted microbiomes, are less tolerant to heat than `colonized' tadpoles, with more natural microbiomes. However, the mechanisms behind these effects are unclear. Here, we compared gene expression profiles of the tadpole gut transcriptome, and tadpole gut microbial metagenome, between colonized and depleted tadpoles under cool or warm conditions. Our goal was to identify differences in host and microbial responses to heat between colonized and depleted tadpoles that might explain their observed differences in heat tolerance. We found that depleted tadpoles exhibited a much stronger degree of host gene expression plasticity in response to heat, while the microbiome of colonized tadpoles was significantly more heat sensitive. These patterns indicate that functional changes in the microbiome in response to heat may allow for a dampened host response, ultimately buffering hosts from the deleterious effects of heat stress. We also identified several specific host and microbial pathways that could be contributing to increased thermal tolerance in colonized tadpoles including amino acid metabolism, vitamin biosynthesis and ROS scavenging pathways. Our results demonstrate that the microbiome influences host plasticity and the response of hosts to environmental stressors.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245191,226,1,NA,jeb245191,KEY WORDS; Gut microbes; Thermal tolerance; Transcriptomics; Metagenomics; Amphibians
article,Scavenging of reactive oxygen species mimics the anoxic response in goldfish pyramidal neurons,"Pillai, Varshinie and Buck, Leslie and Lari, Ebrahim",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Goldfish are one of a few species able to avoid cellular damage during month-long periods in severely hypoxic environments. By suppressing action potentials in excitatory glutamatergic neurons, the goldfish brain decreases its overall energy expenditure. Coincident with reductions in O-2 availability is a natural decrease in cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which has been proposed to function as part of a low-oxygen signal transduction pathway. Using live-tissue fluorescence microscopy, we found that ROS production decreased by 10\% with the onset of anoxia in goldfish telencephalic brain slices. Employing whole-cell patch-clamp recording, we found that, similar to severe hypoxia, the ROS scavengers N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and MitoTEMPO, added during normoxic periods, depolarized membrane potential (severe hypoxia -73.6 to -61.4 mV, NAC -76.6 to -66.2 mV and MitoTEMPO -71.5 mV to -62.5 mV) and increased whole-cell conductance (severe hypoxia 5.7 nS to 8.0 nS, NAC 6.0 nS to 7.5 nS and MitoTEMPO6.0 nS to 7.6 nS). Also, in a subset of active pyramidal neurons, these treatments reduced action potential firing frequency (severe hypoxia 0.18 Hz to 0.03 Hz, NAC 0.27 Hz to 0.06 Hz and MitoTEMPO 0.35 Hz to 0.08 Hz). Neither severe hypoxia norROS scavenging impacted action potential threshold. The addition of exogenous hydrogen peroxide could reverse the effects of the antioxidants. Taken together, this supports a role for a reduction in {[}ROS] as a low-oxygen signal in goldfish brain.",2021,10.1242/jeb.238147,224,10,NA,jeb238147,Anoxia tolerance; Membrane potential; Action potential; Whole-cell conductance; Patch-clamp electrophysiology; Fluorescence imaging
article,Dissecting cause from consequence: a systematic approach to thermal limits,"MacMillan, Heath A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Thermal limits mark the boundaries of ectotherm performance, and are increasingly appreciated as strong correlates and possible determinants of animal distribution patterns. The mechanisms setting the thermal limits of ectothermic animals are under active study and rigorous debate as we try to reconcile new observations in the lab and field with the knowledge gained from a long history of research on thermal adaptation. Here, I provide a perspective on our divided understanding of the mechanisms setting thermal limits of ectothermic animals. I focus primarily on the fundamental differences between high and low temperatures, and how animal form and environment can place different constraints on different taxa. Together, complexity and variation in animal form drive complexity in the interactions within and among levels of biological organization, creating a formidable barrier to determining mechanistic cause and effect at thermal limits. Progress in our understanding of thermal limits will require extensive collaboration and systematic approaches that embrace this complexity and allow us to separate the causes of failure from the physiological consequences that can quickly follow. I argue that by building integrative models that explain causal links among multiple organ systems, we can more quickly arrive at a holistic understanding of the varied challenges facing animals at extreme temperatures.",2019,10.1242/jeb.191593,222,4,NA,jeb191593,Comparative physiology; Critical thermal limits; Ecophysiology; Ectotherm performance

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the small passerine the white-shouldered starling (Sturnus sinensis) can modulate basal metabolism under temperature acclimation by changing the morphological, physiological and biochemical state of its tissues and organs. We measured the effects of temperature on body mass, basal metabolic rate (BMR), wet mass of various internal organs, state 4 respiration (S4R) and cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) activity in the pectoral muscle and organs, metabolites in the pectoral muscle, energy intake, histological dynamics and the activity of duodenal digestive enzymes. Warm acclimation decreased BMR to a greater extent than cold acclimation. At the organ level, birds in the cold-acclimated group had significantly heavier intestines but significantly lighter pectoral muscles. At the cellular level, birds in the cold-acclimated group showed significantly higher S4R in the liver and heart and CCO activity in the liver and kidney at both the mass -specific and whole-organ levels. A metabolomic analysis of the pectoral tissue revealed significantly higher lipid decomposition, amino acid degradation, ATP hydrolysis, and GTP and biotin synthesis in cold-acclimated birds. Acclimation to cold significantly increased the gross energy intake (GEI), feces energy (FE) and digestive energy intake (DEI) but significantly decreased the digestive efficiency of these birds. Furthermore, cold-acclimated birds had a higher maltase activity and longer villi in the duodenum. Taken together, these data show that white-shouldered starlings exhibit high phenotypic flexibility in metabolic adjustments and digestive function under temperature acclimation, consistent with the notion that small birds cope with the energy challenges presented by a cold environment by modulating tissue function in a way that would affect BMR.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246214,227,1,NA,jeb246214,Cold acclimation; Thermogenesis; Sturnus sinensis; Basal metabolic rate; Digestive function

To understand its proposed role in metabolic suppression, we measured free H2S and bound sulfane sulfur (BSS) in tissues of the freshwater turtle Trachemys scripta elegans, a species undergoing strong metabolic suppression when cold and anoxic. In warm normoxic turtles, free H2S was higher in red blood cells (RBCs) and kidney (similar to 9-10 mu mol l(-1)) than in brain, liver and lung (similar to 1-2 mu mol l(-1)). These values overall aligned with the tissue H2S-generating enzymatic activity. BSS levels were similar in all tissues (similar to 0.5 mu mol l(-1)) but similar to 100-fold higher in RBCs, which have a high thiol content, suggesting that RBCs function as a circulating H2S reservoir. Cold acclimation caused significant changes in free and bound H2S in liver, brain and RBCs, but anoxia had no further effect, except in the brain. These results show tissue-dependent sulfide signaling with a potential role in brain metabolic suppression during anoxia in turtles.",2019,10.1242/jeb.203976,222,12,NA,jeb203976,Anoxia; Gasotransmitter; Red blood cell; Metabolic suppression; Trachemys scripta

Here, we demonstrate that heat stability of function (indexed by the Michaelis-Menten constant of the cofactor NADH, K-M(NADH)) and structure (indexed by rate of denaturation) of cytosolic malate dehydrogenases (cMDHs) of two congeners (E. malaccana and E. radiata) exceeds values previously found for orthologs of this protein from less thermophilic species. The ortholog of E. malaccana is more heat stable than that of E. radiata, in keeping with the congeners' thermal environments. Only two inter-congener differences in amino acid sequence in these 332 residue proteins were identified. In both cases (positions 48 and 114), a glycine in the E. malaccana ortholog is replaced by a serine in the E. radiata protein. To explore the relationship between structure and function and to characterize how amino acid substitutions alter stability of different regions of the enzyme, we used molecular dynamics simulation methods. These computational methods allow determination of thermal effects on fine-scale movements of protein components, for example, by estimating the root mean square deviation in atom position over time and the root mean square fluctuation for individual residues. The minor changes in amino acid sequence favor temperature-adaptive change in flexibility of regions in and around the active sites. Interspecific differences in effects of temperature on fine-scale protein movements are consistent with the differences in thermal effects on binding and rates of heat denaturation.",2017,10.1242/jeb.156935,220,11,2066-2075,NA,Adaptation; Echinolittorina; Enzyme kinetics; Lethal temperatures; Molecular dynamics simulation; Temperature
article,Electrosensory and metabolic responses of weakly electric fish to changing water conductivity,"Wiser, Shannon D. and Markham, Michael R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Weakly electric gymnotiform fishes use self -generated electric organ discharges (EODs) to navigate and communicate. The electrosensory range for these processes is a function of EOD amplitude, determined by the fish's electric organ (EO) output and the electrical conductivity of the surrounding water. Anthropogenic activity, such as deforestation, dams and industrial/agricultural runoff, are known to increase water conductivity in neotropical habitats, likely reducing the electrosensory range of these fish. We investigated whether fish modulate EO output as means of reexpanding electrosensory range after a rapid increase in water conductivity in the pulse -type Brachyhypopomus gaude \& nacute;o and the wave -type Eigenmannia virescens . Furthermore, because EOD production incurs significant metabolic costs, we assessed whether such compensation is associated with an increase in metabolic rate. Following the conductivity increase, B. gaude \& nacute;o increased EOD amplitude by 20.2 +/- 4.3\% over 6 days but with no associated increase in metabolic rate, whereas the EOD amplitude of E. virescens remained constant, accompanied by an unexpected decrease in metabolic rate. Our results suggest that B. gaude \& nacute;o uses a compensation mechanism that requires no metabolic investment, such as impedance matching, or a physiological trade-off wherein energy is diverted from other physiological processes to increase EO output. These divergent responses between species could be the result of differences in reproductive life history or evolutionary adaptations to different aquatic habitats. Continued investigation of electrosensory responses to changing water conditions will be essential for understanding the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on gymnotiforms, and potential physiological mechanisms for adapting to a rapidly changing aquatic environment.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246269,227,10,NA,jeb246269,Gymnotiformes; Water quality; Electric organ discharge; Energetics; Anthropogenic disturbances

As a response, social clustering combined with nest use (=communal nesting) is a common strategy for heat conservation. To quantify the actual amount of energy that is saved by this strategy, we studied the social marsupial Dromiciops gliroides (monito del monte), an endemic species of the cold forests of southern South America. It is hypothesized that sociability in this marsupial was driven by cold conditions, but evidence supporting this hypothesis is unclear. Here, we used taxidermic models ('mannequins') to experimentally test the energetic benefits of clustering combined with nest use. To do this, we fitted and compared cooling curves of solitary and grouped mannequins, within and outside of a nest, at the typical winter ambient temperatures of their habitat (5 degrees C). We found that the strategy that minimized euthermic cost of maintenance was the combination of nest use and clustering, thus supporting communal nesting as a social adaptation to cope with the cold. Considering the basal metabolic rate of monitos, our estimates suggest that the savings represents almost half of energy consumption per day (in resting conditions).

article,Chronic warm exposure impairs growth performance and reduces thermal safety margins in the common triplefin fish (<i>Forsterygion lapillum</i>),"McArley, Tristan J. and Hickey, Anthony J. R. and Herbert, Neill A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Intertidal fish species face gradual chronic changes in temperature and greater extremes of acute thermal exposure through climate-induced warming. As sea temperatures rise, it has been proposed that whole-animal performance will be impaired through oxygen and capacity limited thermal tolerance {[}OCLTT; reduced aerobic metabolic scope (MS)] and, on acute exposure to high temperatures, thermal safety margins may be reduced because of constrained acclimation capacity of upper thermal limits. Using the New Zealand triplefin fish (Forsterygion lapillum), this study addressed how performance in terms of growth and metabolism (MS) and upper thermal tolerance limits would be affected by chronic exposure to elevated temperature. Growth was measured in fish acclimated (12 weeks) to present and predicted future temperatures and metabolic rates were then determined in fish at acclimation temperatures and with acute thermal ramping. In agreement with the OCLTT hypothesis, chronic exposure to elevated temperature significantly reduced growth performance and MS. However, despite the prospect of impaired growth performance under warmer future summertime conditions, an annual growth model revealed that elevated temperatures may only shift the timing of high growth potential and not the overall annual growth rate. While the upper thermal tolerance (i.e. critical thermal maxima) increased with exposure to warmer temperatures and was associated with depressed metabolic rates during acute thermal ramping, upper thermal tolerance did not differ between present and predicted future summertime temperatures. This suggests that warming may progressively decrease thermal safety margins for hardy generalist species and could limit the available habitat range of intertidal populations.",2017,10.1242/jeb.162099,220,19,3527-3535,NA,Climate change; Thermal tolerance; OCLTT; Oxygen and capacity limited thermal tolerance; Metabolic scope; Respirometry
article,Tropical flatback turtle (<i>Natator depressus</i>) embryos are resilient to the heat of climate change,"Howard, Robert and Bell, Ian and Pike, David A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Climate change is threatening reproduction of many ectotherms by increasing nest temperatures, potentially making it more difficult for females to locate nest sites that provide suitable incubation regimes during embryonic development. Elevated nest temperatures could increase the incidence of embryonic mortality and/or maladaptive phenotypes. We investigated whether elevated nest temperatures reduce hatching success in tropical flatback turtles (Natator depressus) nesting in the Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia. Egg incubation treatments began at 29.5 degrees C and progressively increased in temperature throughout incubation, up to maxima of 31, 32, 33, 34 and 35 degrees C. Elevated nest temperatures did not reduce hatching success or hatchling body size relative to control temperatures (29.5 degrees C), but did speed up embryonic development. A combination of sudden exposure to high temperatures during the first 2 weeks of incubation (>36 degrees C for 48 h) and prolonged warming throughout incubation (from 29.5-35 degrees C) did not reduce hatching success. We also recorded an unusually high pivotal sex-determining temperature in this flatback turtle population relative to other sea turtle populations: an equal ratio of male and female hatchlings is produced at similar to 30.4 degrees C. This adaptation may allow some flatback turtle populations to continue producing large numbers of hatchlings of both sexes under the most extreme climate change scenarios. Some tropical populations of nesting flatbacks may possess important adaptations to high-temperature incubation environments, which are not found in more southerly temperate populations.",2015,10.1242/jeb.118778,218,20,3330-3335,NA,Embryonic development; Hatching success; Lethal thermal limits; Marine turtle; Metabolic heating; Thermal mortality; Thermal tolerance
article,Cardiovascular contributions and energetic costs of thermoregulation in ectothermic vertebrates,"Parlin, Adam F. and Schaeffer, Paul J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Ectothermic vertebrates use a suite of physiological and behavioral mechanisms to thermoregulate, which result in various thermoregulatory strategies from thermoconformity to thermoregulation. Here, we present a novel synthesis of theoretical and empirical methods to determine cardiovascular contributions to heat transfer in free-living ectothermic vertebrates. We start by identifying the fundamental components of heat transfer and the cardiovascular mechanisms for physiological modulation of heat exchange, and then integrate these components into a single, integrative framework: the cardiovascular heat exchange framework (CHEF). We demonstrate that this framework can identify details of the thermoregulatory strategy in two turtle species, most notably the preponderance of instances where turtles use physiological mechanisms to avoid overheating, suggesting vulnerability to climate change. As modulated physiological contributions to heat flow incur a greater energy demand than relying on unmodulated passive heat transfer, we then asked whether we could characterize the energetic costs of thermoregulation. We measured field metabolic rate (FMR) in free-living turtles and used the CHEF to determine FMR while actively or passively thermoregulating. Comparing an individual's actual FMR to the rate calculated assuming absence of thermoregulation revealed that painted turtles, a partial thermoregulator, elevate their daily energy expenditure (DEE) by about 25\%, while box turtles, a thermoconformer, have a DEE that is nearly unchanged as a result of thermoregulation. This integrative framework builds a new paradigm that provides a mechanism to explain correlations between energy demand and thermoregulatory strategy, quantifies the energetic costs of thermoregulation, and identifies the role of cardiovascular contributions to thermoregulation in free-living animals.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243095,225,"1, SI",NA,jeb243095,Thermoconformer; Thermoregulator; Biologging; Field metabolic rate; Heart rate; Modeling heat transfer; Daily energy expenditure; Big data

Most studies characterizing thermal stress in bivalves focus on evaluating the responses to a single stress event. This does not accurately reflect the reality faced by bivalves, which are often subject to intermittent heat waves. Here, we investigated the effect of intermittent heat stress on mitochondrial functions of the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, which play a key role in setting the thermal tolerance of ectotherms. Specifically, we measured changes in mitochondrial oxygen consumption and H2O2 emission rates before, during and after intermittent 7.5 degrees C heat shocks in oysters acclimated to 15 and 22.5 degrees C. Our results showed that oxygen consumption was impaired following the first heat shock at both acclimation temperatures. After the second heat shock, results for oysters acclimated to 15 degrees C indicated a return to normal. However, oysters acclimated to 22.5 degrees C struggled more with the compounding effects of intermittent heat shocks as denoted by an increased contribution of FAD-linked substrates to mitochondrial respiration as well as high levels of H2O2 emission rates. However, both acclimated populations showed signs of potential recovery 10 days after the second heat shock, reflecting a surprising resilience to heat waves by C. virginica.

article,Plasticity in parental effects confers rapid larval thermal tolerance in the estuarine anemone <i>Nematostella vectensis</i>,"Rivera, Hanny E. and Chen, Cheng-Yi and Gibson, Matthew C. and Tarrant, Ann M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Parental effects can prepare offspring for different environments and facilitate survival across generations. We exposed parental populations of the estuarine anemone, Nematostella vectensis, from Massachusetts to elevated temperatures and quantified larval mortality across a temperature gradient. We found that parental exposure to elevated temperatures resulted in a consistent increase in larval thermal tolerance, as measured by the temperature at which 50\% of larvae die (LT50), with a mean increase in LT50 of 0.3 degrees C. Larvae from subsequent spawns returned to baseline thermal thresholds when parents were returned to normal temperatures, indicating plasticity in these parental effects. Histological analyses of gametogenesis in females suggested that these dynamic shifts in larval thermal tolerance may be facilitated by maternal effects in non-overlapping gametic cohorts. We also compared larvae from North Carolina (a genetically distinct population with higher baseline thermal tolerance) and Massachusetts parents, and observed that larvae from heat-exposed Massachusetts parents had thermal thresholds comparable to those of larvae from unexposed North Carolina parents. North Carolina parents also increased larval thermal tolerance under the same high-temperature regime, suggesting that plasticity in parental effects is an inherent trait for N. vectensis. Overall, we find that larval thermal tolerance in N. vectensis shows a strong genetic basis and can be modulated by parental effects. Further understanding of the mechanisms behind these shifts can elucidate the fate of thermally sensitive ectotherms in a rapidly changing thermal environment.",2021,10.1242/jeb.236745,224,5,NA,jeb236745,Acclimation; Cnidaria; LT50; Maternal effects; Paternal effects; Thermal limits

Here, we investigate the relative and combined effects of maternal and developmental exposure to mild hypoxia (65 and 74\% air saturation, respectively) on the growth and development of embryos of the marine gastropod Littorina littorea. Differences in embryo morphological traits were driven by the developmental environment, whereas the maternal environment and interactive effects of maternal and developmental environment were the main driver of differences in the timing of developmental events. While developmental exposure to mild hypoxia significantly increased the area of an important respiratory organ, the velum, it significantly delayed hatching of veliger larvae and reduced their size at hatching and overall survival. Maternal exposure had a significant effect on these traits, and interacted with developmental exposure to influence the time of appearance of morphological characters, suggesting that both are important in affecting developmental trajectories. A comparison between embryos that successfully hatched and those that died in mild hypoxia revealed that survivors exhibited hypertrophy in the velum and associated preoral cilia, suggesting that these traits are linked with survival in low-oxygen environments. We conclude that both maternal and developmental environments shape offspring phenotype in a species with a complex developmental life history, and that plasticity in embryo morphology arising from exposure to even small reductions in oxygen tensions affects the hatching success of these embryos.",2020,10.1242/jeb.221895,223,20,NA,jeb221895,Developmental plasticity; Gastropod; Maternal effects; Planktotroph

Clay and Van Leeuwen, Travis E. and Brownscombe, Jacob W. and Cooke, Steven J. and Eliason, Erika J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Species invasions threaten global biodiversity, and physiological characteristics may determine their impact. Specific dynamic action (SDA; the increase in metabolic rate associated with feeding and digestion) is one such characteristic, strongly influencing an animal's energy budget and feeding ecology. We investigated the relationship between SDA, scope for activity, metabolic phenotype, temperature and feeding frequency in lionfish (Pterois spp.), which are invasive to western Atlantic marine ecosystems. Intermittent-flow respirometry was used to determine SDA, scope for activity and metabolic phenotype at 26 degrees C and 32 degrees C. Maximum metabolic rate occurred during digestion, as opposed to exhaustive exercise, as in more athletic species. SDA and its duration (SDA(dur)) were 30\% and 45\% lower at 32 degrees C than at 26 degrees C, respectively, and lionfish ate 42\% more at 32 degrees C. Despite a 32\% decline in scope for activity from 26 degrees C to 32 degrees C, aerobic scope may have increased by 24\%, as there was a higher range between standard metabolic rate (SMR) and peak SDA (SDA(peak); the maximum postprandial metabolic rate). Individuals with high SMR and low scope for activity phenotypes had a less costly SDA and shorter SDA(dur) but a higher SDA(peak). Feeding frequently had a lower and more consistent cost than consuming a single meal, but increased SDA(peak). These findings demonstrate that: (1) lionfish are robust physiological performers in terms of SDA and possibly aerobic scope at temperatures approaching their thermal maximum, (2) lionfish may consume more prey as oceans warm with climate change, and (3) metabolic phenotype and feeding frequency may be important mediators of feeding ecology in fish.",2019,10.1242/jeb.209437,222,19,NA,jeb209437,Invasive species; Metabolic phenotype; Specific dynamic action; Thermal physiology; Temperature

The electrocardiogram (ECG) and expression of excitationcontraction coupling genes were studied in fish acclimatised to normoxia in summer (+ 18 degrees C) or winter (+ 2 degrees C), and in winter fish after 1, 3 and 6 weeks of anoxia. Anoxia induced a sustained bradycardia from a heart rate of 10.3 +/- 0.77 beats min(-1) to 4.1 +/- 0.29 beats min(-1) (P<0.05) after 5 weeks, and heart rate slowly recovered to control levels when oxygen was restored. Heart rate variability greatly increased under anoxia, and completely recovered under reoxygenation. The RT interval increased from 2.8 +/- 0.34 s in normoxia to 5.8 +/- 0.44 s under anoxia (P<0.05), which reflects a doubling of the ventricular action potential (AP) duration. Acclimatisation to winter induced extensive changes in gene expression relative to summer-acclimatised fish, including depression in those genes coding for the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump (Serca2a\_q2) and ATP-sensitive K+ channels (Kir6.2) (P<0.05). Genes of delayed rectifier K+ (kcnh6) and Ca2+ channels (cacna1c) were up-regulated in winter fish (P<0.05). In contrast, the additional challenge of anoxia caused only minor changes in gene expression, e. g. depressed expression of Kir2.2b K+ channel gene (kcnj12b), whereas expression of Ca2+ (cacna1a, cacna1c and cacna1g) and Na+ channel genes (scn4a and scn5a) was not affected.

article,The effect of temperature on haemoglobin-oxygen binding affinity in regionally endothermic and ectothermic sharks,"Morrison, Phillip R. and Bernal, Diego and Sepulveda, Chugey A. and Brauner, Colin J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Haemoglobin (Hb)-O2 binding affinity typically decreases with increasing temperature, but several species of ectothermic and regionally endothermic fishes exhibit reduced Hb thermal sensitivity. Regionally endothermic sharks, including the common thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus) and lamnid sharks such as the shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus), can maintain select tissues and organs warmer than ambient temperature by retaining metabolic heat with vascular heat exchangers. In the ectothermic bigeye thresher shark (Alopias superciliosus), diurnal movements above and below the thermocline subject the tissues, including the blood, to a wide range of operating temperatures. Therefore, blood-O2 transport must occur across internal temperature gradients in regionally endothermic species, and over the range of environmental temperatures encountered by the ectothermic bigeye thresher shark. While previous studies have shown temperature-independent Hb-O2 affinity in lamnid sharks, including shortfin mako, the Hb-O2 affinity of the common and bigeye thresher sharks is unknown. Therefore, we examined the effect of temperature on whole-blood Hb-O2 affinity in common thresher shark and bigeye thresher shark. For comparison, analyses were also conducted on the shortfin mako shark and two ectothermic species, blue shark (Prionace glauca) and spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias). Blood-O2 binding affinity was temperature independent for common thresher shark and shortfin mako shark, which should prevent internal temperature gradients from negatively affecting blood-O2 transport. Blue shark and spiny dogfish blood-O2 affinity decreased with increasing temperature, as expected, but bigeye thresher shark blood exhibited both a reduced temperature dependence and a high Hb-O2 affinity, which likely prevents large changes in environment temperature and low environmental oxygen from affecting O2 uptake.",2023,10.1242/jeb.244979,226,2,NA,jeb244979,Hb thermal sensitivity; Blood-O2 transport; Lamnidae; Alopiidae; Blood; Regional endothermy

Improved efficiency of mitochondrial bioenergetics,"Roussel, Damien and Marmillot, Vincent and Monternier, Pierre-Axel and Bourguignon, Aurore and Toullec, Gaelle and Romestaing, Caroline and Duchamp, Claude",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"At fledging, juvenile king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) must overcome the tremendous energetic constraints imposed by their marine habitat, including during sustained extensive swimming activity and deep dives in cold seawater. Both endurance swimming and skeletal muscle thermogenesis require high mitochondrial respiratory capacity while the submerged part of dive cycles repeatedly and greatly reduces oxygen availability, imposing a need for solutions to conserve oxygen. The aim of the present study was to determine in vitro whether skeletal muscle mitochondria become more `thermogenic' to sustain heat production or more `economical' to conserve oxygen in sea-acclimatized immature penguins (hereafter immatures, compared with terrestrial juveniles. Rates of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation were measured in permeabilized fibers and mitochondria from the pectoralis muscle. Mitochondrial ATP synthesis and coupling efficiency were measured in isolated muscle mitochondria. The mitochondrial activities of respiratory chain complexes and citrate synthase were also assessed. The results showed that respiration, ATP synthesis and respiratory chain complex activities in pectoralis muscles were increased by sea acclimatization. Furthermore, muscle mitochondria were on average 30-45\% more energy efficient in sea-acclimatized immatures than in pre-fledging juveniles, depending on the respiratory substrate used (pyruvate, palmitoylcamitine). Hence sea acclimatization favors the development of economical management of oxygen, decreasing the oxygen needed to produce a given amount of ATP. This mitochondrial phenotype may improve dive performance during the early marine life of king penguins, by extending their aerobic dive limit.",2020,10.1242/jeb.233684,223,21,NA,jeb233684,Bioenergetics; Marine birds; Mitochondria; Oxidative phosphorylation

The aim of this study was to determine whether the high fasting endurance of winter-acclimatized king penguin chicks (Aptenodytes patagonicus) is associated with an adjustment of mitochondrial bioenergetics in pectoralis muscle, the largest skeletal muscle in penguins. The rates of mitochondrial oxygen consumption, and ATP synthesis and mitochondrial efficiency (ATP/O ratio) were measured in winter-acclimatized chicks. We used pyruvate/malate and palmitoyl-L-carnitine/malate as respiratory substrates and results from naturally fasted chicks were compared to experimentally re-fed chicks. Bioenergetics analysis of pectoralis muscle revealed that mitochondria are on average 15\% more energy efficient in naturally fasted than in experimentally fed chicks, indicating that fasted birds consume less nutrients to sustain their energy-demanding processes. We also found that moderate reductions in temperature from 38 C to 30 C further increase by 23\% the energy coupling efficiency at the level of mitochondria, suggesting that king penguin chicks realize additional energy savings while becoming hypothermic during winter. It has been calculated that this adjustment of mitochondrial efficiency in skeletal muscle may contribute to nearly 25\% of fasting-induced reduction in mass-specific metabolic rate measured in vivo. The present study shows that the regulation of mitochondrial efficiency triggers the development of an economical management of resources, which would maximize the conservation of endogenous fuel stores by decreasing the cost of living in fasted winter-acclimatized king penguin chicks.",2014,10.1242/jeb.104505,217,15,2691-2697,NA,Bird; Skeletal muscle; Mitochondria; Energy efficiency; Starvation
article,Hypoxia impairs blood glucose homeostasis in naked mole-rat adult subordinates but not queens,"Ojaghi, Mohammad and Pamenter, Matthew E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Naked mole -rats (NMRs) are among the most hypoxia-tolerant mammals and metabolize only carbohydrates in hypoxia. Glucose is the primary building block of dietary carbohydrates, but how blood glucose is regulated during hypoxia has not been explored in NMRs. We hypothesized that NMRs mobilize glucose stores to support anaerobic energy metabolism in hypoxia. To test this, we treated newborn, juvenile and adult (subordinate and queen) NMRs in normoxia (21\% O 2 ) or hypoxia (7, 5 or 3\% O 2 ), while measuring metabolic rate, body temperature and blood [}glucose]. We also challenged animals with glucose, insulin or insulin -like growth factor1 (IGF-1) injections and measured the rate of glucose clearance in normoxia and hypoxia. We found that: (1) blood {[}glucose] increases in moderate hypoxia in queens and pups, but only in severe hypoxia in adult subordinates and juveniles; (2) glucose tolerance is similar between developmental stages in normoxia, but glucose clearance times are 2- to 3 -fold longer in juveniles and subordinates than in queens or pups in hypoxia; and (3) reoxygenation accelerates glucose clearance in hypoxic subordinate adults. Mechanistically, (4) insulin and IGF-1 reduce blood {[}glucose] in subordinates in both normoxia but only IGF-1 impacts blood {[}glucose] in hypoxic queens. Our results indicate that insulin signaling is impaired by hypoxia in NMRs, but that queens utilize IGF-1 to overcome this limitation and effectively regulate blood glucose in hypoxia. This suggests that sexual maturation impacts blood glucose handling in hypoxic NMR queens, which may allow queens to spend longer periods of time in hypoxic nest chambers.",2024,10.1242/jeb.247537,227,10,NA,247537,Insulin; Development; Juvenile; Pup; Breeder
article,Is hypoxia vulnerability in fishes a by-product of maximum metabolic rate?,"Esbaugh, Andrew J. and Ackerly, Kerri L. and Dichiera, Angelina M. and Negrete, Benjamin",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The metabolic index concept combines metabolic data and known thermal sensitivities to estimate the factorial aerobic scope of animals in different habitats, which is valuable for understanding the metabolic demands that constrain species' geographical distributions. An important assumption of this concept is that the O-2 supply capacity (which is equivalent to the rate of oxygen consumption divided by the environmental partial pressure of oxygen: (M) over dotO(2)/PO2) is constant at O-2 tensions above the critical O-2 threshold (i.e. the PO2 where O-2 uptake can no longer meet metabolic demand). This has led to the notion that hypoxia vulnerability is not a selected trait, but a by-product of selection on maximum metabolic rate. In this Commentary, we explore whether this fundamental assumption is supported among fishes. We provide evidence that O-2 supply capacity is not constant in all fishes, with some species exhibiting an elevated O-2 supply capacity in hypoxic environments. We further discuss the divergent selective pressures on hypoxia- and exercise-based cardiorespiratory adaptations in fishes, while also considering the implications of a hypoxia-optimized O-2 supply capacity for the metabolic index concept.",2021,10.1242/jeb.232520,224,13,NA,jeb232520,Metabolic index; Aerobic scope; Exercise; Critical oxygen threshold; Climate change; Ocean warming

To assess the effects of cold or heat stress on amphibians, giant spiny frogs (Quasipaa spinosa) were acclimated at 22 degrees C followed by exposure to 5 degrees C or 30 degrees C for 0, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h, respectively. Histological alterations, apoptotic index, generation of mitochondria! reactive oxygen species (ROS), antioxidant activity indices and stress-response gene expression in frog livers were subsequently determined. Results showed that many fat droplets appeared after 12 h of heat stress and the percentage of melanomacrophage centres significantly changed after 48 h at both stress conditions. Furthermore, the mitochondrial ROS levels were elevated in a time-dependent manner up to 6 h and 12 h in the cold and heat stress groups, respectively. The activities of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase were successively increased with increasing periods of cold or heat exposure, and their gene expression levels showed similar changes in both stress conditions. Most tested heat shock protein (HSP) genes were sensitive to temperature exposure, and the expression profiles of most apoptosis-related genes was significantly upregulated at 3 and 48 h under cold and heat stress, respectively. Apoptotic index at 48 h under cold stress was significantly higher than that under heat stress. Notably, lipid droplets, HSP30, HSP70 and HSP110 might be suitable bioindicators of heat stress. The results of these alterations at physiological, biochemical and molecular levels might contribute to a better understanding of the stress response of Q. spinosa, and perhaps amphibians more generally, under thermal stress.",2018,10.1242/jeb.186379,221,21,NA,jeb186379,Amphibian; Thermal stress; Histological alterations; Oxidative stress; Apoptosis; Stress response gene
article,"The engineering of the giant dragonflies of the Permian: revised body mass, power, air supply, thermoregulation and the role of air density","Cannell, Alan E. R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"An engineering examination of allometric and analogical data on the flight of giant Permian insects (Protodonata, Meganeura or griffinflies) indicates that previous estimates of the body mass of these insects are too lowand that the largest of these insects (wingspan of 70 cm or more) would have had a mass of 100-150 g, several times greater than previously thought. Here, the power needed to generate lift and fly at the speeds typical of modern large dragonflies is examined together with the metabolic rate and subsequent heat generated by the thoracic muscles. This evaluation agrees with previous work suggesting that the larger specimens would rapidly overheat in the high ambient temperatures assumed in the Permian. Various extant mechanisms of thermoregulation are modelled and quantified, including behaviour, radiation and the constraints on convective respiration and evaporation imposed by air flow through spiracles. However, the effects of these on cooling an overheated insect are found to be limited. Instead, an examination of the heat budget in the flight medium indicates that, at about 1.6 bar (160 kPa), thermoregulation supply enters into equilibrium and, even at high ambient temperatures, overheating can be avoided and enough oxygen sourced. This approach indicates how fossil biology can be used to examine past atmospheres.",2018,10.1242/jeb.185405,221,19,NA,jeb185405,Protodonata; Flight; Meganeura; Atmospheric density
article,Seasonal variation in the thermal responses to changing environmental temperature in the world's northernmost land bird,"Nord, Andreas and Folkow, Lars P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Arctic homeotherms counter challenges at high latitudes using a combination of seasonal adjustments in pelage/plumage, fat deposition and intricate thermoregulatory adaptations. However, there are still gaps in our understanding of their thermal responses to cold, particularly in Arctic birds. Here, we have studied the potential use of local heterothermy (i.e. tissue cooling that can contribute to significantly lower heat loss rate) in Svalbard ptarmigan (Lagopus muta hyperborea) - the world's northernmost land bird. We exposed birds kept under simulated Svalbard photoperiod to low ambient temperatures (T-a; between 0 and -30 degrees C) during three seasons (early winter, late winter, summer), whilst recording resting metabolic rate (RMR), core temperature (T-c) and several cutaneous temperatures. Leg skin temperature varied the most, but still only by up to similar to 15 degrees C, whereas body trunk skin temperature changed < 1 degrees C when T-a decreased from 0 to -30 degrees C. At the same time, Tc increased by 0.9 degrees C, concomitant with increased RMR. This was probably driven by the triggering of cerebral thermosensors in response to cooling of the poorly insulated head, the skin of which was 5.4 degrees C colder at -30 degrees C than at 0 degrees C. Thermal conductance in winter was higher in yearlings, probably because they were time/resource constrained from acquiring a high-quality plumage and sufficient fat reserves as a result of concomitant body growth. In conclusion, Svalbard ptarmigan do not employ extensive local heterothermy for cold protection but instead rely on efficient thermogenesis combined with excellent body insulation. Hence, cold defence in the world's northernmost land bird is not mechanistically much different from that of its lower latitude relatives.",2018,10.1242/jeb.171124,221,1,NA,jeb171124,Arctic; Heterothermy; Heat loss rate; Peripheral temperature; Seasonal acclimatization; Thermoregulation
article,"Maternal basking regime has complex implications for birthdate and offspring phenotype in a nocturnally foraging, viviparous gecko","Cree, Alison and Hare, Kelly M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Maternal basking regime can affect gestation length in viviparous squamates, but effects on offspring phenotype in species with extended pregnancies and ability to delay the birth season are unclear. We investigated the effects of three maternal basking regimes on maternal thermoregulation, gestation length, pregnancy outcome and offspring phenotype in the gecko Woodworthia `Otago/Southland'. This long-lived (30+ years), nocturnal forager has field pregnancies lasting up to 14 months, with fully developed offspring maintained in utero over winter. Within regimes, we also compared outcomes for spontaneous (early) deliveries with those from induced (late) deliveries to test the `adaptive prolongation of pregnancy' hypothesis. Although a cool regime significantly extended gestation, the effect was reduced by increased maternal basking, and embryonic development under the cool regime was just as successful. Offspring from spontaneous births (but not induced births) were smaller and grew more slowly when from the cool regime. However, induced offspring did not differ in consistent ways from those delivered spontaneously and offspring from all groups had high viability, similar use of warm retreat sites and similar sprint speeds. Thus, consistent evidence for adaptive prolongation of pregnancy was lacking. Unusually for squamates, pregnant females can begin vitellogenesis before giving birth, and a profound drop in maternal body temperature near the end of pregnancy (similar to 6.3 degrees C, confirmed under the warm regime) may assist survival of embryos in utero. Female lizards that maintain fully developed embryos in utero have the potential to make complex trade-offs among birthdate, offspring phenotype and future reproduction.",2016,10.1242/jeb.140020,219,18,2934-2943,NA,Developmental plasticity; Gestation; Selected temperature; Vitellogenesis; Viviparity; Woodworthia
article,Aerobic scope increases throughout an ecologically relevant temperature range in coho salmon,"Raby, Graham D. and Casselman, Matthew T. and Cooke, Steven J. and Hinch, Scott G. and Farrell, Anthony P. and Clark, Timothy D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Aerobic scope (AS) has been proposed as a functional measurement that can be used to make predictions about the thermal niche of aquatic ectotherms and hence potential fitness outcomes under future warming scenarios. Some salmonid species and populations, for example, have been reported to exhibit different thermal profiles for their AS curves such that AS peaks around the modal river temperature encountered during the upriver spawning migration, suggesting species-and population-level adaptations to river temperature regimes. Interestingly, some other salmonid species and populations have been reported to exhibit AS curves that maintain an upwards trajectory throughout the ecologically relevant temperature range rather than peaking at a modal temperature. To shed further light on this apparent dichotomy, we used adult coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) to test the prediction that peak AS coincides with population-specific, historically experienced river temperatures. We assessed AS at 10 and 15 degrees C, which represent a typical river migration temperature and the upper limit of the historically experienced temperature range, respectively. We also examined published data on AS in juvenile coho salmon in relation to new temperature data measured from their freshwater rearing environments. In both cases, AS was either maintained or increased modestly throughout the range of ecologically relevant temperatures. In light of existing evidence and the new data presented here, we suggest that when attempting to understand thermal optima for Pacific salmon and other species across life stages, AS is a useful metric of oxygen transport capacity but other thermally sensitive physiological indices of performance and fitness should be considered in concert.",2016,10.1242/jeb.137166,219,12,1922-1931,NA,Oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance; OCLTT; Thermal ecology; Oncorhynchus kisutch; Metabolism; Respirometry; Swim tunnel; Exercise; Fish

Here, we examined the thermal sensitivity of cardiorespiratory performance for three closely related species of sculpins that inhabit the Arctic waters, two of which, Gymnocanthus tricuspis and Myoxocephalus scorpioides, have adapted to a restricted range within the Arctic, whereas the third species, Myoxocephalus scorpius, has a wider distribution. We tested the hypothesis that the fish restricted to Arctic cold waters would show reduced cardiorespiratory scope in response to an increase in temperature, as compared with the more eurythermal M. scorpius. As expected from their biogeography, M. scorpioides and G. tricuspis maximised cardiorespiratory performance at temperatures between 1 and 4 degrees C, whereas M. scorpius maximised performance over a wider range of temperatures (1-10 degrees C). Furthermore, factorial scope for cardiac output collapsed at elevated temperature for the two high-latitude species, negatively impacting their ability to support aerobically driven metabolic processes. Consequently, these results concurred with our hypothesis, suggesting that the sculpin species restricted to the Arctic are likely to be negatively impacted by increases in ocean temperatures.",2013,10.1242/jeb.087130,216,22,4251-4255,NA,cardiovascular; scope; temperature; conservation physiology

After tag implantation under anaesthesia, heart rate (f(H)) required 60 h to recover to a stable value in a holding tank. Subsequently, when undisturbed under control conditions (normoxia, 21 degrees C), mean f(H) was always significantly lower in the tank than in the respirometers. In progressive hypoxia (100\% to 15\% oxygen saturation), mean f(H) in the tank was significantly lower than in the respirometers at oxygen levels down to 40\%, with significant bradycardia in both holding conditions below this level. Simultaneous logging of tri-axial body acceleration revealed that spontaneous activity, inferred as the variance of external acceleration (VAR(m)), was low and invariant in hypoxia. Warming (21 to 31 degrees C) caused progressive tachycardia with no differences in f(H) between holding conditions. Mean VAR(m) was, however, significantly higher in the tank during warming, with a positive relationship between VAR(m) and f(H) across all temperatures. Therefore, spontaneous activity contributed to raising f(H) of fish in the tank during warming. Mean f(H) in respirometers had a highly significant linear relationship with mean rates of oxygen uptake, considering data from hypoxia and warming together. The high f(H) of confined seabream indicates that respirometry techniques may bias estimates of metabolic traits in some fishes, and that biologging on free-swimming fish will provide more reliable insight into cardiac and behavioural responses to environmental stressors by fish in their natural environment.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242397,224,14,NA,jeb242397,Heart rate; Acceleration; Biologging; Respirometry; Star-Oddi; Confinement; Oxygen saturation; Teleost

To identify the biochemical changes affected by increasing temperature fluctuations and subsequent heat shock, we acclimated P. cinctipes for 30 days to one of three temperature regimes: (1) constant 10 degrees C, (2) daily temperature fluctuations between 10 and 20 degrees C ( 5 h up- ramp to 20 degrees C, 1 h down-ramp to 10 degrees C) and (3) 10-30 degrees C (up-ramp to 30 degrees C). After acclimation, animals were exposed to either 10 degrees C or a 30 degrees C heat shock to analyze the proteomic changes in claw muscle tissue. Following acclimation to 10- 30 degrees C (measured at 10 degrees C), enolase and ATP synthase increased in abundance. Following heat shock, isoforms of arginine kinase and glycolytic enzymes such as aldolase, triose phosphate isomerase and glyceraldehyde 3- phosphate dehydrogenase increased across all acclimation regimes. Full- length isoforms of hemocyanin increased abundance following acclimation to 10- 30 degrees C, but hemocyanin fragments increased after heat shock following constant 10 degrees C and fluctuating 10-20 degrees C, possibly playing a role as antimicrobial peptides. Following constant 10 degrees C and fluctuating 10- 20 degrees C, paramyosin and myosin heavy chain type-B increased in abundance, respectively, whereas myosin light and heavy chain decreased with heat shock. Actin- binding proteins, which stabilize actin filaments (filamin and tropomyosin), increased during heat shock following 10-30 degrees C; however, actin severing and depolymerization proteins (gelsolin and cofilin) increased during heat shock following 10-20 degrees C, possibly promoting muscle fiber restructuring. RAF kinase inhibitor protein and prostaglandin reductase increased during heat shock following constant 10 degrees C and fluctuating 10- 20 degrees C, possibly inhibiting an immune response during heat shock. The results suggest that ATP supply, muscle fiber restructuring and immune responses are all affected by temperature fluctuations and subsequent acute heat shock in muscle tissue. Furthermore, although heat shock after acclimation to constant 10 degrees C and fluctuating 10-30 degrees Cshowed the greatest effects on the proteome, moderately fluctuating temperatures (10-20 degrees C) broadened the temperature range over which claw muscle was able to respond to an acute heat shock with limited changes in the muscle proteome.",2015,10.1242/jeb.112250,218,3,388-403,NA,Actin-binding proteins; ATP-buffering; Claw muscle; Energy metabolism; Immune response; Proteomics; Systems biology

article,From perplexing to predictive: are we ready to forecast insect disease susceptibility in a warming world?,"Ferguson, Laura V. and Adamo, Shelley A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Insects are critical to our ecosystems, but we do not fully understand their future in our warming world. Rising temperatures are affecting insect physiology in myriad ways, including changes to their immune systems and the ability to fight infection. Whether predicted changes in temperature will contribute to insect mortality or success, and the role of disease in their future survival, remains unclear. Although heat can enhance immunity by activating the integrated defense system (e.g. via the production of protective molecules such as heat-shock proteins) and accelerating enzyme activity, heat can also compromise the immune system through energetic-resource trade-offs and damage. The responses to heat are highly variable among species. The reasons for this variability are poorly known, and we are lagging in our understanding of how and why the immune system responds to changes in temperature. In this Commentary, we highlight the variation in insect immune responses to heat and the likely underlying mechanisms. We suggest that we are currently limited in our ability to predict the effects of rising temperatures on insect immunity and disease susceptibility, largely owing to incomplete information, coupled with a lack of tools for data integration. Moreover, existing data are concentrated on a relatively small number of insect Orders. We provide suggestions for a path towards making more accurate predictions, which will require studies with realistic temperature exposures and housing design, and a greater understanding of both the thermal biology of the immune system and connections between immunity and the physiological responses to heat.",2023,10.1242/jeb.244911,226,4,NA,jeb244911,Climate change; Heat; Immunity; Infection; Insect

However, despite living close to their thermal maxima, stress response mechanisms found in these organisms are poorly understood. We used a novel physiological-proteomic approach for sponges to describe the stress response mechanisms of the lagoon-inhabiting sponge Amphimedon navalis, when exposed to elevated seawater temperatures of +2 degrees C and +4 degrees C relative to a 26 degrees C ambient temperature for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks of thermal exposure, the buoyant weight of the sponge experienced a significant decline, while its pumping rates and oxygen consumption rates significantly increased. Proteome dynamics revealed 50 differentially abundant proteins in sponges exposed to elevated temperature, suggesting that shifts in the sponge proteome were potential drivers of physiological dysfunction. Thermal stress promoted an increase in detoxification proteins, such as catalase, suggesting that an excess of reactive oxygen species in sponge cells was responsible for the significant increase in oxygen consumption. Elevated temperature also disrupted cellular growth and cell proliferation, promoting the loss of sponge biomass, and the high abundance of multiple a-tubulin chain proteins also indicated an increase in cytoskeletal activities within sponge cells, which may have induced the increase in sponge pumping rate. Our results show that sustained thermal exposure in susceptible lagoonal sponges may induce significant disruption of cellular homeostasis, leading to physiological dysfunction, and that a combined physiological-proteomic approach may provide new insights into physiological functions and cellular processes occurring in sponges.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242820,224,22,NA,jeb242820,Sponge; Physiology; Proteomics; Thermal stress; Lagoon; Climate change

To test whether the rate and rhythm of the heart acclimatize to seasonal temperature changes, thermal sensitivity of cardiac excitation in a eurythermal teleost, the roach (Rutilus rutilus), was examined. Excitability of the heart was determined from in vivo electrocardiograms and in vitro microelectrode recordings of action potentials (APs) from winter and summer roach acclimatized to 4 and 18 degrees C, respectively. Under heat ramps (3 degrees C h(-1)), starting from the acclimatization temperatures of the fish, heart rate increased to maximum values of 78 +/- 5 beats min(-1) (at 19.8 +/- 0.5 degrees C) and 150 +/- 7 beats min(-1) (at 28.1 +/- 0.5 degrees C) for winter and summer roach, respectively, and then declined in both groups. Below 20 degrees C, heart rate was significantly higher in winter than in summer roach (P<0.05), indicating positive thermal compensation. Cardiac arrhythmias appeared with rising temperature as missing QRS complexes, increase in variability of heart rate, episodes of atrial tachycardia, ventricular bradycardia and complete cessation of the heartbeat (asystole) in both winter and summer roach. Unlike winter roach, atrial APs of summer roach had a distinct early repolarization phase, which appeared as shorter durations of atrial AP at 10\% and 20\% repolarization levels in comparison to winter roach (P<0.05). In contrast, seasonal acclimatization had only subtle effects on ventricular AP characteristics.

In this study, we tested how adult zebrafish exposure to diel cycles of thermal stress (27-36 degrees C), hypoxia (20-85\% dissolved oxygen) or the combined treatment affects maternal and embryonic levels of cortisol and heat shock proteins (HSPs). While parental exposure to the thermal, hypoxic or combined treatment for 2 weeks did not affect whole-body cortisol levels, the combined exposure increased ovarian cortisol levels by 4-fold and reduced embryonic cortisol content by 60\%. The combined treatment also elicited 3-and 19-fold increases in embryo transcripts involved in cortisol breakdown (11bhsd2) and export (abcb4), respectively. The thermal stress and combined exposure also elicited marked increases in ovary and embryo hsp70a (20-to 45-fold) and HSP70 (3-to 7-fold), and smaller increases in ovary and embryo hsp90aa and hsp47 (2-to 4-fold) and in embryo HSP90 and HSP47 (2-to 6-fold). In contrast, except for increases in ovary hsp90aa (2-fold) and embryo HSP90 (3-fold), the hypoxia treatment had little effect on HSP expression and transfer. Overall, while the embryonic deposition of HSPs largely paralleled the ovarian cellular stress response, the inverse relationship between ovary and embryo cortisol levels suggests the existence of barriers against cortisol deposition in response to environmental stressors. We conclude that the endocrine and cellular stress responses make stressor-specific and distinct contributions to non-genetic inheritance.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244715,225,21,NA,jeb244715,Non-genetic inheritance; Cellular stress response; Glucocorticoids; Environmental stressors; Diel cycling; Fish
article,Aerobic scope does not predict the performance of a tropical eurythermal fish at elevated temperatures,"Norin, Tommy and Malte, Hans and Clark, Timothy D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Climate warming is predicted to negatively impact fish populations through impairment of oxygen transport systems when temperatures exceed those which are optimal for aerobic scope (AS). This concept of oxygen-and capacity-limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT) is rapidly gaining popularity within climate change research and has been applied to several fish species. Here, we evaluated the relevance of aerobic performance of juvenile barramundi (Lates calcarifer) in the context of thermal preference and tolerance by (1) measuring standard and maximum metabolic rates (SMR and MMR, respectively) and AS of fish acclimated to 29 degrees C and acutely exposed to temperatures from 23 to 38 degrees C, (2) allowing the fish to behaviourally select a preferred temperature between 29 and 38 degrees C, and (3) quantifying alterations to AS after 5 weeks of acclimation to 29 and 38 degrees C. SMR and MMR both increased continuously with temperature in acutely exposed fish, but the increase was greater for MMR such that AS was highest at 38 degrees C, a temperature approaching the upper lethal limit (40-41 degrees C). Despite 38 degrees C eliciting maximum AS, when given the opportunity the fish selected a median temperature of 31.7 +/- 0.5 degrees C and spent only 10 +/- 3\% of their time at temperatures > 36 degrees C. Following acclimation to 38 degrees C, AS measured at 38 degrees C was decreased to the same level as 29 degrees C-acclimated fish measured at 29 degrees C, suggesting that AS may be dynamically modulated independent of temperature to accommodate the requirements of daily life. Together, these results reveal limited power of the OCLTT hypothesis in predicting optimal temperatures and effects of climate warming on juvenile barramundi.",2014,10.1242/jeb.089755,217,2,244-251,NA,Barramundi; Climate change; Lates calcarifer; Metabolic rate; Oxygen and capacity-limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT); Oxygen consumption rate
article,The closed spiracle phase of discontinuous gas exchange predicts diving duration in the grasshopper <i>Paracinema tricolor</i>,"Gudowska, Agnieszka and Boardman, Leigh and Terblanche, John S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The discontinuous gas exchange (DGE) pattern of respiration shown by many arthropods includes periods of spiracle closure (C-phase) and is largely thought to serve as a physiological adaptation to restrict water loss in terrestrial environments. One major challenge to this hypothesis is to explain the presence of DGE in insects in moist environments. Here, we show a novel ecological correlate of the C-phase, namely, diving behaviour in mesic Paracinema tricolor grasshoppers. Notably, maximal dive duration is positively correlated with C-phase length, even after accounting for mass scaling and absolute metabolic rate. Here, we propose that an additional advantage of DGE may be conferred by allowing the tracheal system to act as a sealed underwater oxygen reservoir. Spiracle closure may facilitate underwater submersion, which, in turn, may contribute to predator avoidance, the survival of accidental immersion or periodic flooding and the exploitation of underwater resources.",2016,10.1242/jeb.135129,219,16,2423-2425,NA,Respiratory gas exchange; Submersion; CT scan; Scaling; Orthoptera

Among ectotherms, (V) over dot(O2, max) is primarily affected by body size and body temperature, but it should also co-adapt with behavior, ecology and life history aspects. We compiled published data from 11 different families of lizards, including 58 species and 7 populations (total of 65 data points) and tested whether (V) over dot(O2, max) was related to diet (herbivore, insectivore, insectivore/carnivore, carnivore and omnivore), climate (tropical, temperate and arid), noctumality, viviparity or family. We fitted models that included body mass and measurement temperature as covariates, and all possible combinations of other independent variables using ordinary least squares (OLS) and phylogenetic regressions assuming an Ornstein- Uhlenbeck model of residual trait evolution (RegOU). The sum of Akaike weights for each independent variable revealed viviparity (Sigma w(i)=0.996) and the combined set of dummy variables coding for helodermatids, varanids and skinks (Sigma w(i) =0.996) as the most important predictors. These three families had relatively high (V) over dot(O2, max) and are composed mainly of active foragers that probably benefit from higher (V) over dot(O2, max). Viviparity had a negative effect on (V) over dot(O2, max). Ecological or behavioral factors associated with viviparity (e.g. activity levels), but not included here, may explain this effect. The average allometric slope of (V) over dot(O2, max) from the top eight models (which accounted for 99\% of the cumulative evidence) was 0.803, which is similar to that reported previously for lizards and for mammals in general.",2020,10.1242/jeb.229013,223,24,NA,jeb229013,Aerobic capacity; Allometry; Comparative method; Evolutionary physiology; Metabolism; Viviparity
article,Body surface temperature responses to food restriction in wild and captive great tits,"Winder, Lucy A. and White, Stewart A. and Nord, Andreas and Helm, Barbara and McCafferty, Dominic J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"During winter at temperate and high latitudes, the low ambient temperatures, limited food supplies and short foraging periods mean small passerines show behavioural, morphological and physiological adaptations to reduce the risk of facing energy shortages. Peripheral tissues vasoconstrict in low ambient temperatures to reduce heat loss and cold injury. Peripheral vasoconstriction has been observed with food restriction in captivity but has yet to be explored in free-ranging animals. We experimentally food restricted both wild and captive great tits (Parus major) during winter months and measured surface temperatures of the bill and eye region using thermal imaging, to investigate whether birds show rapid local heterothermic responses, which may reduce their thermoregulatory costs when facing a perceived imminent food shortage. Our results of a continuously filmed wild population showed that bill temperature was immediately reduced in response to food restriction compared with when food was available ad libitum, an apparent autonomic response. Such immediacy implies a `pre-emptive' response before the bird experiences any shortfalls in energy reserves. We also demonstrate temporal variation in vasoconstriction of the bill, with bill temperature gradually rising throughout the food restriction after the initial drop. Eye-region temperature in the wild birds remained at similar levels throughout food restriction compared with unrestricted birds, possibly reflecting the need to maintain steady circulation to the central nervous and visual systems. Our findings provide evidence that birds selectively allow the bill to cool when a predictable food supply is suddenly disrupted, probably as a means of minimising depletion of body reserves for a perceived future shortage in energy.",2020,10.1242/jeb.220046,223,8,NA,jeb220046,Thermoregulation; Thermoneutral zone; Heterothermy; Thermal imaging; Winter

Climate change is predicted to cause increases in the frequency of heat and cold wave events, which could increase the likelihood that birds will face an environmental mismatch. Here, we examined seasonality and the effects of acute and chronic heat shock to 33 degrees C and subsequent recovery from heat shock on the ultrastructure of the superficial pectoralis muscle fiber diameter, myonuclear domain (MND) and capillary density in two temperate bird species of differing body mass, the black-capped chickadee (Poecile atricapillus) and the rock pigeon (Columba livia). We found that muscle fiber ultrastructure did not change with heat treatment. However, in black-capped chickadees, there was a significant increase in fiber diameter in spring phenotype birds compared with summer phenotype birds. In rock pigeons, we saw no differences in fiber diameter across seasons. Capillary density did not change as a function of fiber diameter in black-capped chickadees, but did change seasonally, as did MND. Across seasons, as fiber diameter decreased, capillary density increased in the pectoralis muscle of rock pigeons. For both species in this study, we found that as fiber diameter increased, so did MND. Our findings imply that these two temperate birds employ different muscular growth strategies that may be metabolically beneficial to each.",2019,10.1242/jeb.201855,222,12,NA,jeb201855,Seasonality; Fiber diameter; Capillary density; Myonuclear domain; Temperate resident birds
article,Energetics of communal roosting in chestnut-crowned babblers: implications for group dynamics and breeding phenology,"Chappell, Mark A. and Buttemer, William A. and Russell, Andrew F.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"For many endotherms, communal roosting saves energy in cold conditions, but how this might affect social dynamics or breeding phenology is not well understood. Using chestnut-crowned babblers (Pomatostomus ruficeps), we studied the effects of nest use and group size on roosting energy costs. These 50 g cooperatively breeding passerine birds of outback Australia breed from late winter to early summer and roost in huddles of up to 20 in single-chambered nests. We measured babbler metabolism at three ecologically relevant temperatures: 5 degrees C (similar to minimum nighttime temperatures during early breeding), 15 degrees C (similar to nighttime temperatures during late breeding) and 28 degrees C (thermal neutrality). Nest use alone had modest effects: even for solitary babblers at 5 degrees C, it reduced nighttime energy expenditures by <15\%. However, group-size effects were substantial, with savings of up to 60\% in large groups at low temperatures. Babblers roosting in groups of seven or more at 5 degrees C, and five or more at 15 degrees C, did not need to elevate metabolic rates above basal levels. Furthermore, even at 28 degrees C (thermoneutral for solitary babblers), individuals in groups of four or more had 15\% lower basal metabolic rate than single birds, hinting that roosting in small groups is stressful. We suggest that the substantial energy savings of communal roosting at low temperatures help explain why early breeding is initiated in large groups and why breeding females, which roost alone and consequently expend 120\% more energy overnight than other group members, suffer relatively higher mortality than communally roosting group mates.",2016,10.1242/jeb.144972,219,21,3321-3328,NA,Cooperative breeding; Energy expenditure; Group size; Metabolic rate; Oxygen consumption; Thermoregulatory costs
article,The importance of incorporating natural thermal variation when evaluating physiological performance in wild species,"Morash, Andrea J. and Neufeld, Claire and MacCormack, Tyson J. and Currie, Suzanne",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Environmental variability in aquatic ecosystems makes the study of ectotherms complex and challenging. Physiologists have historically overcome this hurdle in the laboratory by using `average' conditions, representative of the natural environment for any given animal. Temperature, in particular, has widespread impact on the physiology of animals, and it is becoming increasingly important to understand these effects as we face future climate challenges. The majority of research to date has focused on the expected global average increase in temperature; however, increases in climate variability are predicted to affect animals as much or more than climate warming. Physiological responses associated with the acclimation to a new stable temperature are distinct from those in thermally variable environments. Our goal is to highlight these physiological differences as they relate to both thermal acclimation and the `fallacy of the average' or Jensen's inequality using theoretical models and novel empirical data. We encourage the use of more realistic thermal environments in experimental design to advance our understanding of these physiological responses such that we can better predict how aquatic animals will respond to future changes in our climate.",2018,10.1242/jeb.164673,221,14,NA,NA,Climate change; Environment; Growth; Metabolism; Aquatic; Ectotherm
article,Geographical differences in maternal basking behaviour and offspring growth rate in a climatically widespread viviparous reptile,"Cadby, Chloe D. and Jones, Susan M. and Wapstra, Erik",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In reptiles, the thermal environment during embryonic development affects offspring phenotypic traits and potentially offspring fitness. In viviparous species, mothers can potentially manipulate the embryonic thermal environment through their basking behaviour and, thus, may be able to manipulate offspring phenotype and increase offspring fitness. One way in which mothers can maximise offspring phenotype (and thus potentially affect offspring fitness) is by fine-tuning their basking behaviour to the environment in order to buffer the embryo from deleterious developmental temperatures. In widespread species, it is unclear whether populations that have evolved under different climatic conditions will exhibit different maternal behaviours and/or thermal effects on offspring phenotype. To test this, we provided extended or reduced basking opportunity to gravid spotted skinks (Niveoscincus ocellatus) and their offspring from two populations at the climatic extremes of the species' distribution. Gravid females fine-tuned their basking behaviour to the basking opportunity, which allowed them to buffer their embryos from potentially negative thermal effects. This fine-tuning of female basking behaviour appears to have led to the expression of geographical differences in basking behaviour, with females from the cold alpine regions being more opportunistic in their basking behaviour than females from the warmer regions. However, those differences in maternal behaviour did not preclude the evolution of geographic differences in thermal effects: offspring growth varied between populations, potentially suggesting local adaptation to basking conditions. Our results demonstrate that maternal effects and phenotypic plasticity can play a significant role in allowing species to cope in changing environmental conditions, which is particularly relevant in the context of climate change.",2014,10.1242/jeb.089953,217,7,1175-1179,NA,Maternal effect; Maternal buffering; Climate change; Phenotypic plasticity; Population; Spotted skink
article,Evolved changes in maternal care in high-altitude native deer mice,"Robertson, Cayleih E. and McClelland, Grant B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"At high altitude (HA), unremitting low oxygen and persistent cold push small mammals close to their metabolic ceilings, leaving limited scope for aerobically demanding activities. However, HA breeding seasons are relatively short and endemic rodents compensate with larger litters than low altitude (LA) conspecifics. Rodent mothers are the sole source of heat and nutrition for altricial offspring and lactation is energetically costly. Thus, it is unclear how HA females balance energy allocation during the nursing period. We hypothesized that HA female rodents invest heavily in each litter to ensure postnatal survival. We measured maternal energetic output and behaviour in nursing deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) native to LA (400 m a.s.l.) and HA (4350 m a.s.l.) under control (24 degrees C, 760 mmHg) and cold hypoxia conditions, simulating HA (5 degrees C, 430 mmHg). Strikingly, resting metabolic rates of lactating HA and LA females under cold hypoxia were 70-85\% of their maximum aerobic capacity. In cold hypoxia, LA mothers increased both nursing time and milk fat content, however their pups were leaner and severely growth restricted at weaning. HA mothers also increased nursing in cold hypoxia but for far less time than LA mothers. Despite receiving less care, HA pups in cold hypoxia only experienced small growth restrictions at weaning and maintained body composition. As adults, HA mice raised in cold hypoxia had increased aerobic capacity compared to controls. These data suggest that HA mothers prioritize their own maintenance costs over investing heavily in their offspring. Pups compensate for this lack of care, likely by reducing their own metabolic costs during development.",2021,10.1242/jeb.235218,224,7,NA,jeb235218,Maternal behaviour; Lactation; Developmental plasticity; Maternal-offspring conflict; Peromyscus

Studies testing this hypothesis have largely focused on measuring short-term performance responses in animals under acute exposure to critical thermal maximums. The OCLTT hypothesis, however, emphasises the importance of sustained animal performance over acute tolerance. The present study tested the effect of chronic hypoxia and hyperoxia during development on moderate to long-term performance indicators at temperatures spanning the optimal temperature for growth in the speckled cockroach, Nauphoeta cinerea. In contrast to the predictions of the OCLTT hypothesis, development under hypoxia did not significantly reduce growth rate or running performance, and development under hyperoxia did not significantly increase growth rate or running performance. The effects of developmental temperature and oxygen on tracheal morphology and metabolic rate were also not consistent with OCLTT predictions, suggesting that oxygen delivery capacity is not the primary driver shaping thermal tolerance in this species. Collectively, these findings suggest that the OCLTT hypothesis does not explain moderate to long-term thermal performance in N. cinerea, which raises further questions about the generality of the hypothesis.",2020,10.1242/jeb.208306,223,11,NA,jeb208306,Hyperoxia; Hypoxia; Metabolic rate; OCLTT; Thermal performance; Growth rate

However, the reduction of oxygen partial pressure with increase in elevation represents an important physiological constraint that may limit colonization of such habitats, even if the thermal niche is appropriate. To test the mechanisms underlying the response to ecologically relevant levels of hypoxia, we performed a translocation experiment with the common wall lizard (Podarcis muralis), a widespread European lizard amenable to establishing populations outside its natural range. We investigated the impacts of hypoxia on the oxygen physiology and reproductive output of gravid common wall lizards and the subsequent development and morphology of their offspring. Lowland females transplanted to high elevations increased their haematocrit and haemoglobin concentration within days and maintained routine metabolism compared with lizards kept at native elevations. However, transplanted lizards suffered from increased reactive oxygen metabolite production near the oviposition date, suggesting a cost of reproduction at high elevation. Transplanted females and females native to different elevations did not differ in reproductive output (clutch size, egg mass, relative clutch mass or embryonic stage at oviposition) or in post-oviposition body condition. Developing embryos reduced heart rates and prolonged incubation times at high elevations within the native range and at extreme high elevations beyond the current range, but this reduced oxygen availability did not affect metabolic rate, hatching success or hatchling size.

Yet, among amphibians, the physiological impacts of short-term temperature variation are largely unknown. Using an ex situ population of Cryptobranchus alleganiensis, an aquatic North American salamander, we tested the hypothesis that naturally occurring periods of temperature variation negatively impact amphibian health, either through direct effects on immune function or by increasing physiological stress. We exposed captive salamanders to repeated cycles of temperature fluctuations recorded in the population's natal stream and evaluated behavioral and physiological responses, including plasma complement activity (i.e. bacteria killing) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Aeromonas hydrophila. The best-fit model (Delta AIC(c)=0, w(i)=0.9992) revealed 70\% greater P. aeruginosa killing after exposure to variable temperatures and no evidence of thermal acclimation. The same model predicted 50\% increased E. coli killing, but had weaker support (Delta AIC(c)=1.8, w(i)=0.2882). In contrast, plasma defenses were ineffective against A. hydrophila, and other health indicators (leukocyte ratios, growth rates and behavioral patterns) were maintained at baseline values. Our data suggest that amphibians can tolerate, and even benefit from, natural patterns of rapid warming/cooling. Specifically, temperature variation can elicit increased activity of the innate immune system. This immune response may be adaptive in an unpredictable environment, and is undetectable by conventional health indicators (and hence considered cryptic).

Using great tits (Parus major) and four common methods with different levels of invasiveness (intraperitoneal, cloacal, subcutaneous, cutaneous), we evaluated the preciseness of body temperature measurements and effects on resting metabolic rate (RMR) over a 40 degrees C range of ambient temperatures. None of the methods caused overestimation or underestimation of RMR compared with un-instrumented birds, and body or skin temperature estimates did not differ between methods in thermoneutrality.

article,Anna's hummingbird (<i>Calypte anna</i>) physiological response to novel thermal and hypoxic conditions at high elevations,"Spence, Austin R. and LeWinter, Hannah and Tingley, Morgan W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Many species have not tracked their thermal niches upslope as predicted by climate change, potentially because higher elevations are associated with abiotic challenges beyond temperature. To better predict whether organisms can continue to move upslope with rising temperatures, we need to understand their physiological performance when subjected to novel high-elevation conditions. Here, we captured Anna's hummingbirds - a species expanding their elevational distribution in concordance with rising temperatures - from across their current elevational distribution and tested their physiological response to novel abiotic conditions. First, at a central aviary within their current elevational range, we measured hovering metabolic rate to assess their response to oxygen conditions and torpor use to assess their response to thermal conditions. Second, we transported the hummingbirds to a location 1200 m above their current elevational range limit to test for an acute response to novel oxygen and thermal conditions. Hummingbirds exhibited lower hovering metabolic rates above their current elevational range limit, suggesting lower oxygen availability may reduce performance after an acute exposure. Alternatively, hummingbirds showed a facultative response to thermal conditions by using torpor more frequently and for longer. Finally, post-experimental dissection found that hummingbirds originating from higher elevations within their range had larger hearts, a potential plastic response to hypoxic environments. Overall, our results suggest lower oxygen availability and low air pressure may be difficult challenges to overcome for hummingbirds shifting upslope as a consequence of rising temperatures, especially if there is little to no long-term acclimatization. Future studies should investigate how chronic exposure and acclimatization to novel conditions, as opposed to acute experiments, may result in alternative outcomes that help organisms better respond to abiotic challenges associated with climate-induced range shifts.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243294,225,10,NA,jeb243294,Calypte anna; Metabolic ecology; Range shifts; Trochilidae; Metabolic rate; Torpor

Despite its importance in driving physiological processes, there are few data on how much variation in T-b exists within populations of organisms, and whether this variation consistently differs among individuals over time (i.e. repeatability of a trait). Here, using thermal radio-frequency identification implants, we quantified the repeatability of T-b, both in the context of a fixed average environment (similar to 21 degrees C) and across ambient temperatures (6-31 degrees C), in a free-living population of tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor, n=16). By experimentally trimming the ventral plumage of a subset of female swallows (n=8), we also asked whether the repeatability of T-b is influenced by the capacity to dissipate body heat. We found that both female and male tree swallow T-b was repeatable at 21 degrees C (R=0.89-92), but female T-b was less repeatable than male T-b across ambient temperature (R-female =0.10, R-male =0.58), which may be due to differences in parental investment. Trimmed birds had on average lower T-b than control birds (by similar to 0.5 degrees C), but the repeatability of female T-b did not differ as a function of heat dissipation capacity. This suggests that trimmed individuals adjusted their T-b to account for the effects of heat loss on T-b.

We examined this issue in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) from a population native to high altitude. Mice were bred in captivity in one of three treatment groups: normoxia (controls), lifelong hypoxia (similar to 12 kPa O-2 from conception to adulthood) and parental hypoxia (normoxia from conception to adulthood, but parents previously exposed to hypoxia). Metabolic. therrnoregulatory and ventilatory responses to progressive stepwise hypoxia and haematology were then measured at post-natal day (P) 14 and 30 and/or in adulthood. Life-long hypoxia had consistent effects across ages on metabolism, attenuating the declines in O-2 consumption rate (<(V)over dot>(O2)) and body temperature during progressive hypoxia compared with control mice. However, life-long hypoxia had age-specific effects on breathing, blunting the hypoxia-induced increases in air convection requirement (quotient of total ventilation and <(V)over dot>(O2)) at P14 and P30 only, but then shifting breathing pattern towards deeper and/or less frequent breaths at P30 and adulthood. Hypoxia exposure also increased blood-O-2 affinity at P14 and P30, in association with an increase in arterial O-2 saturation in hypoxia at P30. In contrast, parental hypoxia had no effects on metabolism or breathing, but it increased blood-O-2 affinity and decreased red cell haemoglobin content at P14 (but not P30). Therefore. hypoxia exposure has some consistent effects across early life and adulthood, and some other effects that are unique to specific life stages.",2021,10.1242/jeb.237024,224,1,NA,jeb237024,Developmental plasticity; Parental effects; Hypoxic metabolic response; Hypoxic ventilatory response
article,Oxygen supply capacity in animals evolves to meet maximum demand at the current oxygen partial pressure regardless of size or temperature,"Seibel, Brad A. and Deutsch, Curtis",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The capacity to extract oxygen from the environment and transport it to respiring tissues in support of metabolic demand reportedly has implications for species' thermal tolerance, body size, diversity and biogeography. Here, we derived a quantifiable linkage between maximum and basal metabolic rate and their oxygen, temperature and size dependencies. We show that, regardless of size or temperature, the physiological capacity for oxygen supply precisely matches the maximum evolved demand at the highest persistently available oxygen pressure and this is the critical P-O2 for the maximum metabolic rate, Pcrit-max. For most terrestrial and shallow-living marine species, Pcrit-max is the current atmospheric pressure, 21 kPa. Any reduction in oxygen partial pressure from current values will result in a calculable decrement in maximum metabolic performance. However, oxygen supply capacity has evolved to match demand across temperatures and body sizes and so does not constrain thermal tolerance or cause the well-known reduction in mass-specific metabolic rate with increasing body mass. The critical oxygen pressure for resting metabolic rate, typically viewed as an indicator of hypoxia tolerance, is, instead, simply a rate-specific reflection of the oxygen supply capacity. A compensatory reduction in maintenance metabolic costs in warm-adapted species constrains factorial aerobic scope and the critical P-O2 to a similar range, between similar to 2 and 6, across each species' natural temperature range.

Additionally, the effects of temperature acclimation on haematocrit, haemoglobin oxygen affinity and gill morphology were assessed. Standard (M) over dot(O2) was higher, but air breathing was not increased, at 15 degrees C or after exercise at both temperatures. Fish acclimated to 5 degrees C or 1 degrees C increased air breathing to compensate and fully maintain standard (M) over dot(O2) in hypoxia. Fish were able to maintain (M) over dot(O2) through aquatic respiration when air was denied in normoxia, but when air was denied in hypoxia, standard (M) over dot(O2) was reduced by similar to 30-50\%. P-crit was relatively high (5 kPa) and there were no differences in P-crit, gill morphology, haematocrit or haemoglobin oxygen affinity at the two temperatures. Therefore, Alaska blackfish depends on air breathing in hypoxia and additional mechanisms must thus be utilised to survive hypoxic submergence during the winter, such as hypoxia-induced enhancement in the capacities for carrying and binding blood oxygen, behavioural avoidance of hypoxia and suppression of metabolic rate.",2014,10.1242/jeb.105023,217,24,4387-4398,NA,respiratory partitioning; bimodal respirometry; temperature acclimation; critical oxygen tension; haemoglobin oxygen affinity; gill remodelling
article,Exposure to low temperature prepares the turtle brain to withstand anoxic environments during overwintering,"Lari, Ebrahim and Buck, Leslie T.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In most vertebrates, anoxia drastically reduces the production of the essential adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to power its many necessary functions, and, consequently, cell death occurs within minutes. However, some vertebrates, such as the painted turtle (Chrysemys picta bellii), have evolved the ability to survive months without oxygen by simultaneously decreasing ATP supply and demand, surviving the anoxic period without any apparent cellular damage. The impact of anoxia on the metabolic function of painted turtles has received a lot of attention. However, the impact of low temperature has received less attention and the interactive effect of anoxia and temperature even less. In the present study, we investigated the interactive impacts of reduced temperature and severe hypoxia on the electrophysiological properties of pyramidal neurons in painted turtle cerebral cortex. Our results show that an acute reduction in temperature from 20 to 5 degrees C decreases membrane potential, action potential width and amplitude, and whole-cell conductance. Importantly, acute exposure to 5 degrees C considerably slows membrane repolarization by voltage-gated K+ channels. Exposing pyramidal cells to severe hypoxia in addition to an acute temperature change slightly depolarized membrane potential but did not alter action potential amplitude or width and whole-cell conductance. These results suggest that acclimation to low temperatures, preceding severe environmental hypoxia, induces cellular responses in pyramidal neurons that facilitate survival under low oxygen concentrations. In particular, our results show that temperature acclimation invokes a change in voltage-gated K+ channel kinetics that overcomes the acute inhibition of the channel.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242793,224,19,NA,jeb242793,Anoxia tolerance; Voltage-gated channels; Thermal adaptation; Membrane properties; Action potential
article,Nutrient and sediment loading affect multiple facets of functionality in a tropical branching coral,"Becker, Danielle M. and Silbiger, Nyssa J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Coral reefs, one of the most diverse ecosystems in the world, face increasing pressures from global and local anthropogenic stressors. Therefore, a better understanding of the ecological ramifications of warming and land-based inputs (e.g. sedimentation and nutrient loading) on coral reef ecosystems is necessary. In this study, we measured how a natural nutrient and sedimentation gradient affected multiple facets of coral functionality, including endosymbiont and coral host response variables, holobiont metabolic responses and percent cover of Pocillopora acuta colonies in Mo'orea, French Polynesia. We used thermal performance curves to quantify the relationship between metabolic rates and temperature along the environmental gradient. We found that algal endosymbiont percent nitrogen content, endosymbiont densities and total chlorophyll a content increased with nutrient input, while endosymbiont nitrogen content per cell decreased, likely representing competition among the algal endosymbionts. Nutrient and sediment loading decreased coral metabolic responses to thermal stress in terms of their thermal performance and metabolic rate processes. The acute thermal optimum for dark respiration decreased, along with the maximal performance for gross photosynthetic and calcification rates. Gross photosynthetic and calcification rates normalized to a reference temperature (26.8 degrees C) decreased along the gradient. Lastly, percent cover of P. acuta colonies decreased by nearly two orders of magnitude along the nutrient gradient. These findings illustrate that nutrient and sediment loading affect multiple levels of coral functionality. Understanding how local-scale anthropogenic stressors influence the responses of corals to temperature can inform coral reef management, particularly in relation to the mediation of land-based inputs into coastal coral reef ecosystems.",2020,10.1242/jeb.225045,223,21,NA,jeb225045,Nutrient loading; Sediment loading; Pocillopora acuta; Thermal performance curve; Land-based inputs; Coral physiology
article,Nitrite-induced reductions in heat tolerance are independent of aerobic scope in a freshwater teleost,"Rodgers, Essie M. and De Boeck, Gudrun",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Nitrite is a widespread form of pollution that directly lowers the blood oxygen carrying capacity of aquatically respiring species. It is unknown if this impairment of oxygen transport translates into an increased susceptibility to elevated temperatures. We hypothesised that nitrite exposure would lower blood oxygen carrying capacity and decrease both aerobic scope (maximum-standard metabolic rate) and heat tolerance. To test these hypotheses, juvenile European carp (Cyprinus catpio) were exposed to two levels of nitrite (0 mmol l(-1) or 1 mmol l(-1)) for 7 days and haematological parameters, critical thermal maxima (CTmax) and aerobic scope were assessed. Nitrite exposure reduced total haemoglobin by 32.9\%. Aerobic scope remained unchanged in fish exposed to nitrite; however, marked declines in CTmax. (1.2 degrees C reduction) were observed in nitrite-exposed fish. These findings demonstrate that nitrite exposure can significantly impair heat tolerance, even when aerobic capacity is maintained.",2019,10.1242/jeb.212035,222,23,NA,jeb212035,CTmax Critical thermal maxima; Thermal tolerance; Nitrite pollution; Nutrient pollution; Metabolism

To date, SusEI is thought to be limited either by the capacity of the mammary glands to produce milk (the peripheral limitation hypothesis) or by a female's ability to dissipate body heat (the heat dissipation hypothesis). In the present study. we examined the effects of litter size and ambient temperature on a set of physiological, behavioral and morphological indicators of Sushi and reproductive performance in lactating Swiss mice. Our results indicate that energy input, energy output and mammary gland mass increased with litter size, whereas pup body mass and survival rate decreased. The body temperature increased significantly, while food intake (18 g day(-1) at 21 degrees C versus 10 g day(-1) at 30 degrees C), thermal conductance (lower by 20-27\% at 30 degrees C than 21 degrees C), litter mass and milk energy output decreased significantly in the females raising a large litter size at 30 degrees C compared with those at 21 degrees C. Furthermore, an interaction between ambient temperature and litter size affected females' energy budget, imposing strong constraints on SusEI. Together, our data suggest that the limitation may be caused by both mammary glands and heat dissipation, i.e. peripheral limitation is dominant at room temperature, but heat dissipation is more significant at warm temperatures. Further, the level of the heat dissipation limits may be temperature dependent, shifting down with increasing temperature.",2017,10.1242/jeb.157107,220,12,2277-2286,NA,Heat dissipation limits; Lactation; Litter size; Sustained energy intake; Mammary gland; Temperature
article,Friends with benefits: the role of huddling in mixed groups of torpid and normothermic animals,"Nowack, Julia and Geiser, Fritz",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Huddling and torpor are widely used for minimizing heat loss by mammals. Despite the questionable energetic benefits from social heterothermy of mixed groups of warm normothermic and cold torpid individuals, the heterothermic Australian sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps) rests in such groups during the cold season. To unravel why they might do so, we examined torpor expression of two sugar glider groups of four individuals each in outside enclosures during winter. We observed 79 torpor bouts during 50 days of observation and found that torpor bouts were longer and deeper when all individuals of a group entered torpor together, and therefore infer that they would have saved more energy in comparison to short and shallow solitary torpor bouts. However, all gliders of either group only expressed torpor uniformly in response to food restriction, whereas on most occasions at least one individual per group remained normothermic. Nevertheless, the presence of warm gliders in mixed groups also appears to be of energetic advantage for torpid individuals, because nest box temperature was negatively correlated with the number of torpid gliders, and normothermic individuals kept the nest temperature at a value closer to the threshold for thermoregulatory heat production during torpor. Our study suggests that mixed groups of torpid and normothermic individuals are observed when environmental conditions are adverse but food is available, leading to intermediate energy savings from torpor. However, under especially challenging conditions and when animals are starving, energy savings are maximized by uniform and pronounced expression of torpor.",2016,10.1242/jeb.128926,219,4,590-596,NA,Disturbance; Energy saving; Social thermoregulation; Sugar glider
article,The cost of muscle power production: muscle oxygen consumption per unit work increases at low temperatures in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>,"Seebacher, Frank and Tallis, Jason A. and James, Rob S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Metabolic energy (ATP) supply to muscle is essential to support activity and behaviour. It is expected, therefore, that there is strong selection to maximise muscle power output for a given rate of ATP use. However, the viscosity and stiffness of muscle increases with a decrease in temperature, which means that more ATP may be required to achieve a given work output. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ATP use increases at lower temperatures for a given power output in Xenopus laevis. To account for temperature variation at different time scales, we considered the interaction between acclimation for 4 weeks (to 15 or 25 degrees C) and acute exposure to these temperatures. Cold-acclimated frogs had greater sprint speed at 15 degrees C than warm-acclimated animals. However, acclimation temperature did not affect isolated gastrocnemius muscle biomechanics. Isolated muscle produced greater tetanus force, and faster isometric force generation and relaxation, and generated more work loop power at 25 degrees C than at 15 degrees C acute test temperature. Oxygen consumption of isolated muscle at rest did not change with test temperature, but oxygen consumption while muscle was performing work was significantly higher at 15 degrees C than at 25 degrees C, regardless of acclimation conditions. Muscle therefore consumed significantly more oxygen at 15 degrees C for a given work output than at 25 degrees C, and plastic responses did not modify this thermodynamic effect. The metabolic cost of muscle performance and activity therefore increased with a decrease in temperature. To maintain activity across a range of temperature, animals must increase ATP production or face an allocation trade-off at lower temperatures. Our data demonstrate the potential energetic benefits of warming up muscle before activity, which is seen in diverse groups of animals such as bees, which warm flight muscle before take-off, and humans performing warm ups before exercise.",2014,10.1242/jeb.101147,217,11,1940-1945,NA,Muscle performance; Locomotion; Metabolic cost; Temperature; Thermal acclimation
article,Is cold acclimation of benefit to hibernating rodents?,"Egginton, Stuart and May, Shaun and Deveci, Durmus and Hauton, David",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The thermal challenge associated with cold acclimation (CA) and hibernation requires effective cardio-respiratory function over a large range of temperatures. We examined the impact of acute cooling in a cold-naive hibernator to quantify the presumed improvement in cardio-respiratory dysfunction triggered by CA, and estimate the role of the autonomic nervous system in optimising cardiac and respiratory function. Golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) were held at a 12h: 12h light: dark photoperiod and room temperature (21 degrees C euthermic control) or exposed to simulated onset of winter in an environmental chamber, by progression to 1h:23. h light: dark and 4 degrees C over 4. weeks. In vivo acute cooling (core temperature T-b=25 degrees C) in euthermic controls led to a hypotension and bradycardia, but preserved cardiac output. CA induced a hypertension at normothermia (T-b=37 degrees C) but on cooling led to decreases in diastolic pressure below euthermic controls and a decrease in cardiac output, despite an increase in left ventricular conductance. Power spectral analysis of heart rate variability suggested a decline in vagal tone on cooling euthermic hamsters (T-b=25 degrees C). Following CA, vagal tone was increased at T-b= 37 degrees C, but declined more quickly on cooling (T-b= 25 degrees C) to preserve vagal tone at levels similar to euthermic controls at T-b= 37 degrees C. For the isolated heart, CA led to concentric hypertrophy with decreased end-diastolic volume, but with no change in intrinsic heart rate at either 37 or 25 degrees C. Mechanical impairment was noted at 37 degrees C following CA, with peak developed pressure decreased by 50\% and peak rate-pressure product decreased by 65\%; this difference was preserved at 25 degrees C. For euthermic hearts, coronary flow showed thermal sensitivity, decreasing by 65\% on cooling (T= 25 degrees C). By contrast, CA hearts had low coronary flow compared with euthermic controls, but with a loss of thermal sensitivity. Together, these observations suggest that CA induced a functional impairment in the myocardium that limits performance of the cardiovascular system at euthermia, despite increased autonomic input to preserve cardiac function. On acute cooling this autonomic control was lost and cardiac performance declined further than for cold-nave hamsters, suggesting that CA may compromise elements of cardiovascular function to facilitate preservation of those more critical for subsequent rewarming.",2013,10.1242/jeb.079160,216,11,2140-2149,NA,hibernator; cardiac function; hypotension; hypothermia; capillarity

Lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, populations within the northern expanse of their range in Manitoba, Canada, may be susceptible to high temperature stress and pathogenic infection. We acclimated developing lake sturgeon for 22 days to two ecologically relevant, summer temperatures (16 and 20 \& DEG;C). Individuals from both acclimation treatments were then exposed to 0, 30 and 60 \& mu;g ml-1 bacterial lipopolysaccharides (endotoxins), as an immune stimulus, for 48 h and sampled 4 and 48 h during trial exposures and following a 7 day recovery period. We then measured whole-body transcriptional (mRNA) responses involved in the innate immune, stress and fatty acid responses following acute exposure to the bacterial endotoxins. Data revealed that overall levels of mRNA transcript abundance were higher in 20 \& DEG;C-reared sturgeon under control conditions. However, following exposure to a bacterial stimulus, lake sturgeon acclimated to 16 \& DEG;C produced a more robust and persistent transcriptional response with higher mRNA transcript abundance across innate immune, stress and fatty acid responses than their 20 \& DEG;C-acclimated counterparts. Additional whole-animal performance metrics (critical thermal maximum, metabolic rate, cortisol concentration and whole -body and mucosal lysozyme activity) demonstrated acclimation -specific responses, indicating compromised metabolic, stress and enzymatic capacity following the initiation of immune-related responses. Our study showed that acclimation to 20 \& DEG;C during early development impaired the immune capacity of developing lake sturgeon as well as the activation of molecular pathways involved in the immune, stress and fatty acid responses.

article,"Aerobic scope does matter in the temperature-size rule, but only under optimal conditions","Walczynska, Aleksandra and Sobczyk, Mateusz",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"We united theoretical predictions of the factors responsible for the evolutionary significance of the temperature-size rule (TSR). We assumed that (i) the TSR is a response to temperature-dependent oxic conditions, (ii) body size decrease is a consequence of cell shrinkage in response to hypoxia, (iii) this response enables organisms to maintain a wide scope for aerobic performance, and (iv) it prevents a decrease in fitness. We examined three clones of the rotifer Lecane inermis exposed to three experimental regimes: mild hypoxia, severe hypoxia driven by too high of a temperature, and severe hypoxia driven by an inadequate oxygen concentration. We compared the following traits in normoxia- and hypoxia-exposed rotifers: nuclear size (a proxy for cell size), body size, specific dynamic action (SDA, a proxy of aerobic metabolism) and two fitness measures, the population growth rate and eggs/female ratio. The results showed that (i) under mildly hypoxic conditions, our causative reasoning was correct, except that one of the clones decreased in body size without a decrease in nuclear size, and (ii) in more stressful environments, rotifers exhibited clone- and condition-specific responses, which were equally successful in terms of fitness levels. Our results indicate the importance of the testing conditions. The important conclusions were that (i) a body size decrease at higher temperatures enabled the maintenance of a wide aerobic scope under clone-specific, thermally optimal conditions, and (ii) this response was not the only option to prevent fitness reduction under hypoxia.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242884,224,23,NA,jeb242884,Aerobic scope; Body size; Fitness; Rotifers; SDA; Temperature-size rule

Recent declines in summer sea ice have resulted in walruses hauling out on land where they have to travel farther to access productive benthic habitat while potentially increasing energetic costs. Despite the need to better understand the impact of sea ice loss on energy expenditure, knowledge about metabolic demands of specific behaviours in walruses is scarce. In the present study, 3 adult female Pacific walruses (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) housed in professional care participated in flow-through respirometry trials to measure metabolic rates while floating inactive at the water surface during a minimum of 5 min, during a 180 s stationary dive, and while swimming similar to 90 m horizontally underwater. Metabolic rates during stationary dives (3.82 +/- 0.56 l O-2 min(-1)) were lower than those measured at the water surface (4.64 +/- 1.04 l O-2 min(-1)), which did not differ from rates measured during subsurface swimming (4.91 +/- 0.77 l O-2 min(-1)). Thus, neither stationary diving nor subsurface swimming resulted in metabolic rates above those exhibited by walruses at the water surface. These results suggest that walruses minimize their energetic investment during underwater behaviours as reported for other marine mammals. Although environmental factors experienced by free-ranging walruses (e.g. winds or currents) likely affect metabolic rates, our results provide important information for understanding how behavioural changes affect energetic costs and can be used to improve bioenergetics models aimed at predicting the metabolic consequences of climate change on walruses.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242993,224,23,NA,jeb242993,Metabolic rate; Energetics; Diving; Swimming; Odobenus rosmarus; Walrus
article,Economic thermoregulatory response explains mismatch between thermal physiology and behaviour in newts,"Gvozdik, Lumir and Kristin, Peter",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature is an important factor determining distribution and abundance of organisms. Predicting the impact of warming climate on ectotherm populations requires information about species' thermal requirements, i.e. their so-called `thermal niche'. The characterization of thermal niche remains a complicated task. We compared the applicability of two indirect approaches, based on reaction norm (aerobic scope curve) and optimality (preferred body temperature) concepts, for indirect estimation of thermal niche while using newts, Ichthyosaura alpestris, as a study system. If the two approaches are linked, then digesting newts should keep their body temperatures close to values maximizing aerobic scope for digestion. After feeding, newts maintained their body temperatures within a narrower range than did hungry individuals. The range of preferred body temperatures was well below the temperature maximizing aerobic scope for digestion. Optimal temperatures for factorial aerobic scope fell within the preferred body temperature range of digesting individuals. We conclude that digesting newts prefer body temperatures that are optimal for the maximum aerobic performance but relative to the maintenance costs.

This study tested how prolonged adult zebrafish exposure to combined diel cycles of thermal stress and hypoxia affect offspring early survival and development, parental investment of cortisol and heat shock proteins (HSPs), larval offspring stress responses, and both parental and offspring heat and hypoxia tolerance. Parental exposure to the combined stressor did not affect fecundity, but increased mortality, produced smaller embryos and delayed hatching. The combined treatment also reduced maternal deposition of cortisol and increased embryo hsf1, hsp70a, HSP70, hsp90aa and HSP90 levels. In larvae, basal cortisol levels did not differ between treatments, but acute exposure to combined heat stress and hypoxia increased cortisol levels in control larvae with no effect on larvae from exposed parents. In contrast, whereas larval basal hsf1, hsp70a and hsp90aa levels differed between parental treatments, the combined acute stressor elicited similar transcriptional responses across treatments. Moreover, the combined acute stressor only induced a marked increase in HSP47 levels in the larvae derived from exposed parents. Finally, combined hypoxia and elevated temperatures increased both thermal and hypoxia tolerance in adults and conferred an increase in offspring thermal but not hypoxia tolerance. These results demonstrate that intergenerational acclimation to combined thermal stress and hypoxia elicit complex carryover effects on stress responsiveness and offspring tolerance with potential consequences for resilience.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245583,226,16,NA,jeb245583,Non-genetic inheritance; Environmental stressors; Cortisol; Heat shock proteins; Thermal tolerance; Hypoxia resistance

As insect biogeography is tied to environmental temperature, understanding the limits of A. aegypti thermal tolerance and their capacity for phenotypic plasticity is important in predicting the spread of this species. In this study, we report on the chill coma onset (CCO) and recovery time (CCRT), as well as low-temperature survival phenotypes of larvae and adults of A. aegypti that developed or were acclimated to 15 degrees C (cold) or 25 degrees C (warm). Cold acclimation did not affect CCO temperatures of larvae but substantially reduced CCO in adults. Temperature and the duration of exposure both affected CCRT, and cold acclimation strongly mitigated these effects and increased rates of survival following prolonged chilling. Female adults were far less likely to take a blood meal when cold acclimated, and exposing females to blood (without feeding) attenuated some of the beneficial effects of cold acclimation on CCRT. Lastly, larvae suffered from haemolymph hyperkalaemia when chilled, but cold acclimation attenuated the imbalance. Our results demonstrate that A. aegypti larvae and adults have the capacity to acclimate to low temperatures, and do so at least in part by better maintaining ion balance in the cold. This ability for cold acclimation may facilitate the spread of this species to higher latitudes, particularly in an era of climate change.",2019,10.1242/jeb.214056,222,24,NA,jeb214056,Chill tolerance; Ionoregulation; Mosquito; Thermal plasticity

We investigated this hypothesis by studying the effects of acute temperature increases (16, 23, 30, 32.5 and 36 degrees C) on the thermal sensitivity of 10 key enzymes governing cardiac oxidative and glycolytic metabolism in two populations of European perch (Perca fluviatilis) field-acclimated to 15.5 and 22.5 degrees C, as well as the effects of acclimation on cardiac lipid composition. In both populations of perch, the activity of glycolytic (pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase) and tricarboxylic acid cycle (pyruvate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase) enzymes increased with acute warming. However, at temperatures exceeding 30 degrees C, a drastic thermally induced decline in citrate synthase activity was observed in the cold-and warm-acclimated populations, respectively, indicating a bottleneck for producing the reducing equivalents required for oxidative phosphorylation. Yet, the increase in aspartate aminotransferase and malate dehydrogenase activities occurring in both populations at temperatures exceeding 30 degrees C suggests that the malate-aspartate shuttle may help to maintain cardiac oxidative capacities at high temperatures. Warm acclimation resulted in a reorganization of the lipid profile, a general depression of enzymatic activity and an increased fatty acid metabolism and oxidative capacity. Although these compensatory mechanisms may help to maintain cardiac energy production at high temperatures, the activity of the electron transport system enzymes, such as complexes I and IV, declined at 36 degrees C in both populations, indicating a thermal limit of oxidative phosphorylation capacity in the heart of European perch.",2017,10.1242/jeb.150698,220,3,386-396,NA,Citrate synthase; Fatty acid oxidation; Lipid composition; Temperature acclimation; Tricarboxylic acid cycle

These chicks could benefit from using energy-conserving torpor, which is characterised by controlled reductions of metabolism and body temperature (T-b). We investigated at what age the precocial king quail Coturnix chinensis can defend a high T-b under a mild thermal challenge and whether they can express torpor soon after achieving endothermy to overcome energetic and thermal challenges. Measurements of surface temperature (T-s) using an infrared thermometer showed that king quail chicks are partially endothermic at 2-10 days, but can defend high T-b at a body mass of similar to 13 g. Two chicks expressed shallow nocturnal torpor at 14 and 17 days for 4-5 h with a reduction of metabolism by >40\% and another approached the torpor threshold. Although chicks were able to rewarm endogenously from the first torpor bout, metabolism and T-s decreased again by the end of the night, but they rewarmed passively when removed from the chamber. The total metabolic rate increased with body mass. All chicks measured showed a greater reduction of nocturnal metabolism than previously reported in quails. Our data show that shallow torpor can be expressed during the early postnatal phase of quails, when thermoregulatory efficiency is still developing, but heat loss is high.

Altricial mammals undergo a dramatic metabolic transition from ectothermy to endothermy in early post-natal life, which may influence the ontogenetic development of respiratory traits at high altitude. We examined the developmental changes in respiratory and haematological traits in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) native to high altitude, comparing the respiratory responses to progressive hypoxia between highland and lowland deer mice. Among adults, highlanders exhibited higher total ventilation and a more effective breathing pattern (relatively deeper tidal volumes), for mice that were caught and tested at their native altitudes and those lab-raised in normoxia. Lab-raised progeny of each population were also tested at post-natal day (P)7, 14, 21 and 30. Highlanders developed an enhanced hypoxic ventilatory response by P21, concurrent with the full maturation of the carotid bodies, and their more effective breathing pattern arose by P14; these ages correspond to critical benchmarks in the full development of homeothermy in highlanders. However, highlanders exhibited developmental delays in ventilatory sensitivity to hypoxia, hyperplasia of type I cells in the carotid body and increases in blood haemoglobin content compared with lowland mice. Nevertheless, highlanders maintained consistently higher arterial O-2 saturation in hypoxia across development, in association with increases in blood-O-2 affinity that were apparent from birth.

Phenotypic plasticity was initially thought to be beneficial to an organism's physiological fitness but several alternative hypotheses have been proposed with growing empirical support. In this study, we tested the full suite of hypotheses by investigating acclimation responses of locomotor performance for nine populations of five species of sub-Antarctic weevils, using static and fluctuating temperatures. Species showed typical locomotion thermal performance curves with temperature of the maximum speed (T-opt) ranging between 22.3 +/- 1.7 degrees C (mean +/- s.e.m.) and 31.1 +/- 0.7 degrees C. For most species, T-opt was not affected by acclimation. For maximum speed (U-max), significant, positive effects of acclimation were found for all species except a supralittoral one. Individuals acclimated to 0 degrees C showed much lower values than the other two acclimation treatments (15 degrees C and fluctuating 0-15 degrees C). Performance breadth (the index of the breadth of the curve, T-br) typically showed little response to acclimation. None of the traits of the supralittoral species was affected by acclimation treatment. Responses to stable and fluctuating temperature treatments were similar. Our findings also revealed that the mean estimated activation energy 0.40 +/- 0.015 eV (mean +/- s.e.m.) was lower than for other herbivores, the category to which these weevils belong, suggesting that some form of compensation in the rate-temperature relationship may be evident.

A growing number of recent studies have shown beneficial effects of exposing insects to recurrent brief warm pulses during low-temperature stress (fluctuating thermal regime, FTR). The physiological underpinnings of the beneficial effects of FTR on cold survival have been extensively studied over the past few years. Profiling with various `-omics' techniques has provided supporting evidence for different physiological responses between insects exposed to FTR and constant low temperature. Evidence from transcriptomic, metabolomic and lipidomic studies points to a system-wide loss of homeostasis at low temperature that can be counterbalanced by repair mechanisms under FTR. Although there has been considerable progress in understanding the physiological mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of FTR, here we discuss how many areas still lack clarity, such as the precise role(s) of heat shock proteins, compatible solutes or the identification of regulators and key players involved in the observed homeostatic responses. FTR can be particularly beneficial in applied settings, such as for model insects used in research, integrated pest management and pollination services. We also explain how the application of FTR techniques in large-scale facilities may require overcoming some logistical and technical constraints. FTR definitively enhances survival at low temperature in insects, but before it can be widely used, we suggest that the possible fitness and energy costs of FTR must be explored more thoroughly. Although FTR is not ecologically relevant, similar processes may operate in settings where temperatures fluctuate naturally.",2018,10.1242/jeb.164806,221,14,NA,NA,Cold storage; Physiological repair; Fluctuating temperature; Recovery
article,Warm preconditioning protects against acute heat-induced respiratory dysfunction and delays bleaching in a symbiotic sea anemone,"Hawkins, Thomas D. and Warner, Mark E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Preconditioning to non-stressful warming can protect some symbiotic cnidarians against the high temperature-induced collapse of their mutualistic endosymbiosis with photosynthetic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium spp.), a process known as bleaching. Here, we sought to determine whether such preconditioning is underpinned by differential regulation of aerobic respiration. We quantified in vivo metabolism and mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activity in the naturally symbiotic sea anemone Exaiptasia pallida preconditioned to 30 degrees C for > 7 weeks as well as anemones kept at 26 degrees C. Preconditioning resulted in increased Symbiodinium photosynthetic activity and holobiont (host+ symbiont) respiration rates. Biomassnormalised activities of host respiratory enzymes {[}citrate synthase and the mitochondrial electron transport chain (mETC) complexes I and IV] were higher in preconditioned animals, suggesting that increased holobiont respiration may have been due to host mitochondrial biogenesis and/or enlargement. Subsequent acute heating of preconditioned and ` thermally naive' animals to 33 degrees C induced dramatic increases in host mETC complex I and Symbiodinium mETC complex II activities only in thermally naive E. pallida. These changes were not reflected in the activities of other respiratory enzymes. Furthermore, bleaching in preconditioned E. pallida (defined as the significant loss of symbionts) was delayed by several days relative to the thermally naive group. These findings suggest that changes to mitochondrial biogenesis and/or function in symbiotic cnidarians during warm preconditioning might play a protective role during periods of exposure to stressful heating.",2017,10.1242/jeb.150391,220,6,969-983,NA,Coral bleaching; Aiptasia; Exaiptasia pallida; Thermal stress; Respiration; Cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis; Acclimation

We measured the effects of single heat shocks and of diurnally fluctuating or constant rearing temperatures on the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) for final instar larvae of Manduca sexta. Brief (2 h) heat shocks at temperatures of 35 degrees C and above significantly increased CTmax relative to control temperatures (25 degrees C). Increasing mean temperatures (from 25 to 30 degrees C) or greater diurnal fluctuations (from constant to +/- 10 degrees C) during larval development also significantly increased CTmax. Combining these data showed that repeated or continuous temperature exposure during development improved heat tolerance beyond the effects of a single exposure to the same maximum temperature.

article,"Hypoxia delays hematopoiesis: retention of embryonic hemoglobin and erythrocytes in larval rainbow trout, <i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>, during chronic hypoxia exposure","Bianchini, Kristin and Wright, Patricia A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In rainbow trout development, a switch occurs from high-affinity embryonic hemoglobin (Hb) and round, embryonic erythrocytes to lower-affinity adult Hb and oval, adult erythrocytes. Our study investigated the early ontogeny of rainbow trout blood properties and the hypoxia response. We hypothesized that hypoxia exposure would delay the ontogenetic turnover of Hb and erythrocytes because retention of high-affinity embryonic Hb would facilitate oxygen loading. To test this hypothesis we developed a method of efficiently extracting blood from individual embryos and larvae and optimized several techniques for measuring hematological parameters on microliter (0.5-2.0 mu l) blood samples. In chronic hypoxia (30\% of oxygen saturation), stage-matched embryos and larvae possessed half the Hb concentration, erythrocyte counts and hematocrit observed in normoxia. Hypoxia-reared larvae also had threefold to sixfold higher mRNA expression of the embryonic Hb alpha-1, beta-1 and beta-2 subunits relative to stage-matched normoxia-reared larvae. Furthermore, in hypoxia, the round embryonic erythrocytic shape persisted into later developmental stages. Despite these differences, Hb-oxygen affinity (P-50), cooperativity and the Root effect were unaltered in hypoxia-reared O. mykiss. The data support our hypothesis that chronic hypoxia delays the ontogenetic turnover of Hb and erythrocytes, but without the predicted functional consequences (i.e. higher than expected P-50). These results also suggest that the Hb-oxygen affinity is protected during development in chronic hypoxia to favor oxygen unloading at the tissues. We conclude that in early trout development, the blood-oxygen transport system responds very differently to chronic hypoxia relative to adults, possibly because respiration depends relatively more on oxygen diffusion than convection.",2013,10.1242/jeb.083337,216,23,4415-4425,NA,embryo; erythrocytes; hemoglobin; hypoxia; larva; rainbow trout

Y.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The trade off between energy gained and expended is the foundation of understanding how, why and when animals perform any activity. Based on the concept that animal movements have an energetic cost, accelerometry is increasingly being used to estimate energy expenditure. However, validation of accelerometry as an accurate proxy for field metabolic rate in free-ranging species is limited. In the present study, Australasian gannets (Morus serrator) from the Pope's Eye colony (38 degrees 16 ` 42 `' S 144 degrees 41 ` 48 `' E), south-eastern Australia, were equipped with GPS and tri-axial accelerometers and dosed with doubly labelled water (DLW) to measure energy expenditure during normal behaviour for 3-5 days. The correlation between daily energy expenditure from the DLW and vectorial dynamic body acceleration (VeDBA) was high for both a simple correlation and activity-specific approaches (R2=0.75 and 0.80, respectively). Varying degrees of success were observed for estimating at-sea metabolic rate from accelerometry when removing time on land using published energy expenditure constants (R2=0.02) or activity-specific approaches (R2=0.42). The predictive capacity of energy expenditure models for total and at-sea periods was improved by the addition of total distance travelled and proportion of the sampling period spent at sea during the night, respectively (R2=0.61-0.82). These results indicate that accelerometry can be used to estimate daily energy expenditure in free-ranging gannets and its accuracy may depend on the inclusion of movement parameters not detected by accelerometry.",2023,10.1242/jeb.246922,226,23,NA,jeb246922,Doubly labelled water; Tri-axial accelerometry; Field metabolic rate; Australasian gannet; Morus serrator
article,Highland deer mice support increased thermogenesis in response to chronic cold hypoxia by shifting uptake of circulating fatty acids from muscles to brown adipose tissue,"Lyons, Sulayman A. and McClelland, Grant B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"During maximal cold challenge (cold-induced VO2,max) in hypoxia, highland deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) show higher rates of circulatory fatty acid delivery compared with lowland deer mice. Fatty acid delivery also increases with acclimation to cold hypoxia (CH) and probably plays a major role in supporting the high rates of thermogenesis observed in highland deer mice. However, it is unknown which tissues take up these fatty acids and their relative contribution to thermogenesis. The goal of this study was to determine the uptake of circulating fatty acids into 24 different tissues during hypoxic cold-induced VO2,max, by using {[}1-14C]2- bromopalmitic acid. To uncover evolved and environment-induced changes in fatty acid uptake, we compared lab-born and -raised highland and lowland deer mice, acclimated to either thermoneutral (30 degrees C, 21 kPa O2) or CH (5 degrees C, 12 kPa O2) conditions. During hypoxic cold-induced VO2,max, CH-acclimated highlanders decreased muscle fatty acid uptake and increased uptake into brown adipose tissue (BAT) relative to thermoneutral highlanders, a response that was absent in lowlanders. CH acclimation was also associated with increased activities of enzymes citrate synthase and beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase in the BAT of highlanders, and higher levels of fatty acid translocase CD36 (FAT/CD36) in both populations. This is the first study to show that cold-induced fatty acid uptake is distributed across a wide range of tissues. Highland deer mice show plasticity in this fatty acid distribution in response to chronic cold hypoxia, and combined with higher rates of tissue delivery, this contributes to their survival in the cold high alpine environment.",2024,10.1242/jeb.247340,227,7,NA,jeb247340,[}1-14C]2-Bromopalmitic acid; Non-esterified fatty acids; Peromyscus maniculatus; Skeletal muscle; Heat production; Phenotypic plasticity
article,Cycling temperature treatments affect estimates of digestive performance in prairie lizards<i> (Sceloporus</i><i> consobrinus)</i>,"Litmer, Allison R. and Beaupre, Steven J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In nature, many organisms experience a daily range of body temperatures. Thermal performance at stable temperatures is often extrapolated to predict function in cyclical environments. However, temperature order and cyclicity may influence physiological processes. The current study compared energy intake, digestive passage time and energy budgets at a stable temperature (33 degrees C) and two temperature cycles in lizards (Sceloporus consobrinus), to determine (1) whether stable treatments adequately project performance in a cycling environment and (2) whether temperature order influences performance. Cycles had a mean temperature of 33 degrees C, and rotated through 30 degrees C, 33 degrees C and 36 degrees C daily, with equal durations of time at each temperature but differing temperature order, with warm days and cool nights in cycle 1 and cool days and warm nights in cycle 2. For analyses, performance in the stable treatment was compared with that during cycles. If temperature is the primary factor regulating performance, then performance from the stable treatment and cycles should compare favorably. However, physiological performance varied based on temperature treatment. Energy intake and budgets were similar between the stable trial and cycle 1 but not cycle 2. However, passage time did not differ. Notably, the two cycling regimes consistently varied in performance, indicating that temperature order plays a primary role in regulating performance. Physiological data collection requires careful consideration of effects of cycling versus stable temperature treatments. Stable temperatures do not consistently represent performance in cycling regimes and consideration should be paid not only to which temperatures animals experience but also to how temperature is experienced in nature.",2024,10.1242/jeb.247006,227,4,NA,jeb247006,Lizard; Energetics; Thermal performance; Constant; Passage; Consumption

Temperature is both the environmental parameter being sensed and the mechanism by which the pit membrane detects the signal. As snakes are ectotherms, temperature also has a strong influence on neurological and locomotor responses to the signal. This study of Pacific rattlesnakes (Crotalus oreganus) systematically examined the effect of body, target and background temperatures on response to a moving target. We presented each snake with a moving pendulum bob regulated at a series of six temperatures against a uniform background regulated at one of three temperatures. Snake body temperatures varied from 18 to 36 degrees C. As expected, we found stronger responses to positive contrasts (target warmer than background) than to negative contrasts, and stronger responses to greater contrasts. However, the effect of body temperature was contrary to expectations based on studies of the TRPA1 ion channel (believed to be the molecular basis for pit membrane temperature receptors) and typical thermal reaction norms for neural and motor performance. These predict (1) no response below the threshold where the TRPA1 channel opens, (2) response increasing as temperature increases, peaking near preferred body temperature, and (3) declining thereafter. Remarkably, this behavioral response decreased as body temperature increased from 18 to 36 degrees C, with no threshold or peak in this range.

The experimental protocols were designed to optimize the surgical protocol and minimize stress. First, minimally invasive heart rate (f(H)) measurements were made during a thermal ramp until cardiac failure in C. aceratus and compared with those from the closely related red-blooded black rockcod (Notothenia coriiceps). Then, integrative cardiovascular adjustments were more extensively studied using flow probes and intravascular catheters in C. aceratus during acute warming (from 0 to 8 degrees C) at rest and after imposed activity. Chaenocephalus aceratus had a lower routine f H than N. coriiceps (9 beats min(-1) versus 14 beats min(-1)) and a lower peak f(H )during acute warming (38 beats min' versus 55 beats min(-1)) with a similar cardiac breakpoint temperature (13 and 14 degrees C, respectively). Routine cardiac output ((Q) over dot) for C. aceratus at similar to 0 degrees C was much lower (26.6 ml min(-1) kg(-1)) than previously reported, probably because fish in the present study had a low f(H) (12 beats min(-1)) indicative of a high routine vagal tone and low stress. Chaenocephalus aceratus increased oxygen consumption during acute warming and with activity. Correspondingly, (Q) over dot increased considerably (maximally 86.3 ml min(-1) kg(-1)), as did vascular conductance (5-fold). Thus, unlike earlier suggestions, these data provide convincing evidence that icefish can mount a well-developed cardiovascular regulation of heart rate, cardiac output and vascular conductance, and this regulatory capacity provides flexibility during acute warming.",2018,10.1242/jeb.183160,221,15,NA,jeb183160,Cardiac output; Heart rate; Stroke volume; ECG; Warming; Sympathovagal balance
article,Diurnality as an energy-saving strategy: energetic consequences of temporal niche switching in small mammals,"van der Vinne, Vincent and Gorter, Jenke A. and Riede, Sjaak J. and Hut, Roelof A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Endogenous daily (circadian) rhythms allow organisms to anticipate daily changes in the environment. Most mammals are specialized to be active during the night (nocturnal) or day (diurnal). However, typically nocturnal mammals become diurnal when energetically challenged by cold or hunger. The circadian thermo-energetics (CTE) hypothesis predicts that diurnal activity patterns reduce daily energy expenditure (DEE) compared with nocturnal activity patterns. Here, we tested the CTE hypothesis by quantifying the energetic consequences of relevant environmental factors in mice. Under natural conditions, diurnality reduces DEE by 6-10\% in energetically challenged mice. Combined with night-time torpor, as observed in mice under prolonged food scarcity, DEE can be reduced by similar to 20\%. The dominant factor determining the energetic benefit of diurnality is thermal buffering provided by a sheltered resting location. Compared with nocturnal animals, diurnal animals encounter higher ambient temperatures during both day and night, leading to reduced thermogenesis costs in temperate climates. Analysis of weather station data shows that diurnality is energetically beneficial on almost all days of the year in a temperate climate region. Furthermore, diurnality provides energetic benefits at all investigated geographical locations on European longitudinal and latitudinal transects. The reduction of DEE by diurnality provides an ultimate explanation for temporal niche switching observed in typically nocturnal small mammals under energetically challenging conditions. Diurnality allows mammals to compensate for reductions in food availability and temperature as it reduces energetic needs. The optimal circadian organization of an animal ultimately depends on the balance between energetic consequences and other fitness consequences of the selected temporal niche.",2015,10.1242/jeb.119354,218,16,2585-2593,NA,Circadian; Circadian thermo-energetics hypothesis; Daily energy expenditure; Diurnal; Energetics; Temperature cycle; Temporal niche switching

We randomly assigned birds to four treatment groups varying in temperature (cold=3 degrees C; warm=24 degrees C) and photoperiod {[}short day (SD)=8 h: 16 h light: dark; long day (LD)=16 h: 8 h light: dark] in a two-by-two design. We measured body mass (M-b), flight muscle width and (M) over dot(sum) before and after 3 and 6 weeks of acclimation, and flight muscle and heart masses after 6 weeks. (M) over dot(sum) increased for cold-exposed, but not for warm-exposed, birds. LD birds gained more M-b than SD birds, irrespective of temperature. Flight muscle size and mass did not differ significantly among groups, but heart mass was larger in cold-exposed birds. Citrate synthase, carnitine palmitoyl transferase and beta-hydroxyacyl Co-A dehydrogenase activities in the pectoralis were generally higher for LD and cold groups. The cold-induced changes in (M) over dot(sum) and heart mass parallel winter changes for small birds, but the larger M-b and higher catabolic enzyme activities in LD birds suggest photoperiod-induced changes associated with migratory disposition.

Rivulus will leave their aquatic habitat for moist, terrestrial environments when water conditions are poor, or, as we show here, to capture terrestrial insects. Specimens were conditioned to eat pinhead crickets on one side of their aquaria. After 2 weeks of conditioning, a barrier with a slope of 15 deg was partially submerged in the middle of the tank, forcing the fish to transition from water to land and back into water in order to feed. Kinematics during the transition were recorded using Fastec high-speed video cameras (125-250 frames s(-1)). Videos were analyzed using Didge and ImageJ software programs. Transition behaviors were characterized and analyzed according to their specific type. Body oscillation amplitude and wave duration were quantified for movements along the substrate, along with initial velocity for launching behaviors. Kryptolebias marmoratus used a diverse suite of behaviors to transition from water to land. These behaviors can be categorized as launches, squiggles and pounces.

We subjected dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) to chronic cold acclimations of varying duration and subsequently quantified their metabolic rates, thermal conductance and ability to maintain normothermia. Cold-acclimated birds adjusted traits related to both heat generation (increased summit metabolic rate) and heat conservation (decreased conductance) to improve their body temperature regulation. Increases in summit metabolic rate occurred rapidly, but plateaued after 1 week of cold exposure. In contrast, changes to conductance occurred only after 9 weeks of cold exposure. Thus, the ability to maintain body temperature continued to improve throughout the experiment, but the mechanisms underlying this improvement changed through time.

Consequently, the ability to account for mussels' physiological responses to thermal stress affects ecologists' capacity to predict the impacts of a warming climate on this ecosystem. Here, we examined the effect of heating rate on cardiac thermal tolerance in the ribbed mussel, Mytilus californianus, comparing populations from high and low sites in the intertidal zone where emersion duration leads to different mean daily heating rates. Two temperature-related cardiac variables were examined: (1) the critical temperature (T-crit) at which heart rate (HR) precipitously declines, and (2) flatline temperature (FLT) where HR reaches zero. Mussels were heated in air at slow, moderate and fast rates, and HR was measured via an infrared sensor affixed to the shell. Faster heating rates significantly increased T-crit in high-but not low-zone mussels, and T-crit was higher in high-versus low-zone mussels, especially at the fastest heating rate. By contrast, FLT did not differ between zones, and was minimally affected by heating rate. As heating rate significantly impacted high-but not low-zone mussels' cardiac thermal tolerance, realistic zone-specific heating rates must be used in laboratory tests if those tests are to provide accurate information for ecological models attempting to predict the effects of increasing temperature on intertidal communities.",2019,10.1242/jeb.203166,222,17,NA,jeb203166,Critical temperature; Flatline temperature; Heart rate; Heat stress; Intertidal zone; Ramping rate

For instance, in multivoltine species, seasonal changes between and within generations may trigger morphological and physiological variation enhancing fitness under different environmental conditions. These seasonal changes may irreversibly affect adult phenotypes when experienced during development. Yet, the irreversible effects of developmental plasticity on adult morphology have rarely been linked to life-history traits even though they may affect different fitness components such as reproduction, mobility and self-maintenance. To address this issue, we raised larvae of Pieris napi butterflies under warm or cool conditions to subsequently compare adult performance in terms of reproduction performance (as assessed through fecundity), displacement capacity (as assessed through flight propensity and endurance) and self-maintenance (as assessed through the measurement of oxidative markers). As expected in ectotherms, individuals developed faster under warm conditions and were smaller than individuals developing under cool conditions. They also had more slender wings and showed a higher wing surface ratio. These morphological differences were associated with changes in the reproductive and flight performance of adults, as individuals developing under warm conditions laid fewer eggs and flew larger distances. Accordingly, the examination of their oxidative status suggested that individuals developing under warm conditions invested more strongly into self-maintenance than individuals developing under cool conditions (possibly at the expense of reproduction). Overall, our results indicate that developmental conditions have long-term consequences on several adult traits in butterflies. This plasticity probably acts on life-history strategies for each generation to keep pace with seasonal variations and may facilitate acclimation processes in the context of climate change.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243724,225,3,NA,jeb243724,Seasonality; Flight performance; Life-history patterns
article,Can temperature-dependent changes in myocardial contractility explain why fish only increase heart rate when exposed to acute warming?,"Gamperl, A. Kurt and Thomas, Alexander L. and Syme, Douglas A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Fish increase heart rate (f(H)), not stroke volume (V-S), when acutely warmed as a way to increase cardiac output (Q). To assess whether aspects of myocardial function may have some basis in determining temperature-dependent cardiac performance, we measured work and power (shortening, lengthening and net) in isolated segments of steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) ventricular muscle at the fish's acclimation temperature (14 degrees C), and at 22 degrees C, when subjected to increased rates of contraction (30-105 min(-1), emulating increased f(H)) and strain amplitude (8-14\%, mimicking increased V-S). At 22 degrees C, shortening power (indicative of 40) increased in proportion to f(H), and the work required to re-lengthen (stretch) the myocardium (fill the heart) was largely independent of f(H) . In contrast, the increase in shortening power was less than proportional when strain was augmented, and lengthening work approximately doubled when strain was increased. Thus, the derived relationships between f(H) , strain and myocardial shortening power and lengthening work, suggest that increasing f(H) would be preferable as a mechanism to increase Q at high temperatures, or in fact may be an unavoidable response given constraints on muscle mechanics as temperatures rise. Interestingly, at 14 degrees C, lengthening work increased substantially at higher f(H), and the duration of lengthening (i.e. diastole) became severely constrained when f(H) was increased. These data suggest that myocardial contraction/twitch kinetics greatly constrain maximal f(H) at cool temperatures, and may underlie observations that fish elevate V-S to an equal or greater extent than f(H) to meet demands for increased Q at lower temperatures.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243152,225,4,NA,jeb243152,Fish; Thermal tolerance; Diastolic filling; Contraction frequency; Stroke volume; Lengthening work

Methionine acts as a methylation agent across generations. For all groups, measurements were collected for three performance traits of individual thermal tolerance (upper sublethal thermal limit, lethal limit and dysregulation range) over two generations. The results showed that no treatment increased the upper thermal limit during acute thermal stress, although serotonin-treated and methionine-treated individuals outperformed controls across multiple thermal performance traits. Additionally, some effects were evident across generations. Together, these results suggest that phenotypic engineering provides complex outcomes, and if implemented with heat hardening can further influence performance in multiple thermal tolerance traits, within and across generations. Potentially, such techniques could be up-scaled to provide resilience and stability in populations susceptible to extreme temperature events.",2018,10.1242/jeb.174672,221,14,NA,174672,Phenotypic engineering; Thermal tolerance; Extreme heat events; Climate change; Artemia; Invertebrates
article,Multimodal <i>in situ</i> datalogging quantifies inter-individual variation in thermal experience and persistent origin effects on gaping behavior among intertidal mussels (<i>Mytilus californianus</i>),"Miller, Luke P. and Dowd, W. Wesley",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In complex habitats, environmental variation over small spatial scales can equal or exceed larger-scale gradients. This small-scale variation may allow motile organisms to mitigate stressful conditions by choosing benign microhabitats, whereas sessile organisms may rely on other behaviors to cope with environmental stresses in these variable environments. We developed a monitoring system to track body temperature, valve gaping behavior and posture of individual mussels (Mytilus californianus) in field conditions in the rocky intertidal zone. Neighboring mussels' body temperatures varied by up to 14 degrees C during low tides. Valve gaping during low tide and postural adjustments, which could theoretically lower body temperature, were not commonly observed. Rather, gaping behavior followed a tidal rhythm at a warm, high intertidal site; this rhythm shifted to a circadian period at a low intertidal site and for mussels continuously submerged in a tidepool. However, individuals within a site varied considerably in time spent gaping when submerged. This behavioral variation could be attributed in part to persistent effects of the mussels' developmental environment. Mussels originating from a wave-protected, warm site gaped more widely, and remained open for longer periods during high tide than mussels from a wave-exposed, cool site. Variation in behavior was modulated further by recent wave heights and body temperatures during the preceding low tide. These large ranges in body temperatures and durations of valve closure events - which coincide with anaerobic metabolism - support the conclusion that individuals experience `homogeneous' aggregations such as mussel beds in dramatically different fashion, ultimately contributing to physiological variation among neighbors.",2017,10.1242/jeb.164020,220,22,4305-4319,NA,Biologging; Body temperature; Bivalve; Inter-individual variation; Tidal rhythm; Valve gaping
article,Reversibility of developmental heat and cold plasticity is asymmetric and has long-lasting consequences for adult thermal tolerance,"Slotsbo, Stine and Schou, Mads F. and Kristensen, Torsten N. and Loeschcke, Volker and Sorensen, Jesper G.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The ability of insects to cope with stressful temperatures through adaptive plasticity has allowed them to thrive under a wide range of thermal conditions. Developmental plasticity is generally considered to be a non-reversible phenotypic change, e.g. in morphological traits, while adult acclimation responses are often considered to be reversible physiological responses. However, physiologically mediated thermal acclimation might not follow this general prediction. We investigated the magnitude and rate of reversibility of developmental thermal plasticity responses in heat and cold tolerance of adult flies, using a full factorial design with two developmental and two adult temperatures (15 and 25 degrees C). We show that cold tolerance attained during development is readily adjusted to the prevailing conditions during adult acclimation, with a symmetric rate of decrease or increase. In contrast, heat tolerance is only partly reversible during acclimation and is thus constrained by the temperature during development. The effect of adult acclimation on heat tolerance was asymmetrical, with a general loss of heat tolerance with age. Surprisingly, the decline in adult heat tolerance at 25 degrees C was decelerated in flies developed at low temperatures. This result was supported by correlated responses in two senescence-associated traits and in accordance with a lower rate of ageing after low temperature development, suggesting that physiological age is not reset at eclosion. The results have profound ecological consequences for populations, as optimal developmental temperatures will be dependent on the thermal conditions faced in the adult stage and the age at which they occur.",2016,10.1242/jeb.143750,219,17,2726-2732,NA,Longevity; Climate change; Heat tolerance; Cold tolerance; Phenotypic plasticity; Drosophila
article,Interactions between developmental and adult acclimation have distinct consequences for heat tolerance and heat stress recovery,"Willot, Quentin and Loos, Ben and Terblanche, John S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Developmental and adult thermal acclimation can have distinct, even opposite, effects on adult heat resistance in ectotherms. Yet, their relative contribution to heat-hardiness of ectotherms remains unclear despite the broad ecological implications thereof. Furthermore, the deterministic relationship between heat knockdown and recovery from heat stress is poorly understood but significant for establishing causal links between climate variability and population dynamics. Here, using Drosophila melanogaster in a full-factorial experimental design, we assessed the heat tolerance of flies in static stress assays, and document how developmental and adult acclimation interact with a distinct pattern to promote survival to heat stress in adults. We show that warmer adult acclimation is the initial factor enhancing survival to constant stressful high temperatures in flies, but also that the interaction between adult and developmental acclimation becomes gradually more important to ensure survival as the stress persists. This provides an important framework revealing the dynamic interplay between these two forms of acclimation that ultimately enhance thermal tolerance as a function of stress duration. Furthermore, by investigating recovery rates post-stress, we also show that the process of heat-hardening and recovery post-heat knockdown are likely to be based on set of (at least partially) divergent mechanisms. This could bear ecological significance as a trade-off may exist between increasing thermal tolerance and maximizing recovery rates post-stress, constraining population responses when exposed to variable and stressful climatic conditions.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242479,224,16,NA,jeb242479,Insects; Thermal biology; Acclimation; Heat stress; Heat coma; Thermal tolerance
article,Dynamic changes in cardiac mitochondrial metabolism during warm acclimation in rainbow trout,"Pichaud, Nicolas and Ekstrom, Andreas and Hellgren, Kim and Sandblom, Erik",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Although the mitochondrial metabolism responses to warm acclimation have been widely studied in fish, the time course of this process is less understood. Here, we characterized the changes of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) cardiac mitochondrial metabolism during acute warming from 10 to 16 degrees C, and during the subsequent warm acclimation for 39 days. We repeatedly measured mitochondrial oxygen consumption in cardiac permeabilized fibers and the functional integrity of mitochondria (i.e. mitochondrial coupling and cytochrome c effect) at two assay temperatures (10 and 16 degrees C), as well as the activities of citrate synthase (CS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at room temperature. LDH and CS activities significantly increased between day 0 (10 degrees C acclimated fish) and day 1 (acute warming to 16 degrees C) while mitochondrial oxygen consumption measured at respective in vivo temperatures did not change. Enzymatic activities and mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates significantly decreased by day 2, and remained stable during warm acclimation (days 2-39). The decrease in rates of oxygen between day 0 and day 1 coincided with an increased cytochrome c effect and a decreased mitochondrial coupling, suggesting a structural/functional impairment of mitochondria during acute warming. We suggest that after 2 days of warm acclimation, a new homeostasis is reached, which may involve the removal of dysfunctional mitochondria. Interestingly, from day 2 onwards, there was a lack of differences in mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates between the assay temperatures, suggesting that warm acclimation reduces the acute thermal sensitivity of mitochondria. This study provides significant knowledge on the thermal sensitivity of cardiac mitochondria that is essential to delineate the contribution of cellular processes to warm acclimation.",2017,10.1242/jeb.152421,220,9,1674-1683,NA,Warm acclimation; Electron transport system; Fish; Heart; Mitochondria; Temperature
article,Local thermal environment and warming influence supercooling and drive widespread shifts in the metabolome of diapausing <i>Pieris rapae</i> butterflies,"Mikucki, Emily E. and Lockwood, Brent L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Global climate change has the potential to negatively impact biological systems as organisms are exposed to novel temperature regimes. Increases in annual mean temperature have been accompanied by disproportionate rates of change in temperature across seasons, and winter is the season warming most rapidly. Yet, we know relatively little about how warming will alter the physiology of overwintering organisms. Here, we simulated future warming conditions by comparing diapausing Pieris rapae butterfly pupae collected from disparate thermal environments and by exposing P. rapae pupae to acute and chronic increases in temperature. First, we compared internal freezing temperatures (supercooling points) of diapausing pupae that were developed in common-garden conditions but whose parents were collected from northern Vermont, USA, or North Carolina, USA. Matching the warmer winter climate of North Carolina, North Carolina pupae had significantly higher supercooling points than Vermont pupae. Next, we measured the effects of acute and chronic warming exposure in Vermont pupae and found that warming induced higher supercooling points. We further characterized the effects of chronic warming by profiling the metabolomes of Vermont pupae via untargeted LC-MS metabolomics. Warming caused significant changes in abundance of hundreds of metabolites across the metabolome. Notably, there were warming-induced shifts in key biochemical pathways, such as pyruvate metabolism, fructose and mannose metabolism, and beta-alanine metabolism, suggesting shifts in energy metabolism and cryoprotection. These results suggest that warming affects various aspects of overwintering physiology in P. rapae and may be detrimental depending on the frequency and variation of winter warming events. Further research is needed to ascertain the extent to which the effects of warming are felt among a broader set of populations of P. rapae, and among other species, in order to better predict how insects may respond to changes in winter thermal environments.",2021,10.1242/jeb.243118,224,22,NA,jeb243118,Cold tolerance; Climate change; Diapause; Cryoprotectant; Metabolomics; Overwintering
article,"Mussel acclimatization to high, variable temperatures is lost slowly upon transfer to benign conditions","Moyen, Nicole E. and Somero, George N. and Denny, Mark W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Climate change is increasing the temperature variability animals face, and thermal acclimatization allows animals to adjust adaptively to this variability. Although the rate of heat acclimatization has received some study, little is known about how long these adaptive changes remain without continuing exposure to heat stress. This study explored the rate at which field acclimatization states are lost when temperature variability is minimized during constant submersion. California mussels (Mytilus califomianus) with different acclimatization states were collected from high- and low-zone sites (similar to 12 versus similar to 5 degrees C daily temperature ranges, respectively) and then kept submerged at 15 degrees C for 8 weeks. Each week, the cardiac thermal performance of mussels was measured as a metric of acclimatization state: critical (T-crit) and flatline (T-flat) temperatures were recorded. Over 8 weeks of constant submersion, the mean T(crit )of high-zone mussels decreased by 1.07 degrees C from baseline, but low-zone mussels' mean T-crit  was unchanged. High- and low-zone mussels' mean maximum heart rate (HR) and resting HR decreased similar to 12 and 35\%, respectively. T-flat was unchanged in both groups. These data suggest that T-crit  and HR are more physiologically plastic in response to the narrowing of an animal's daily temperature range than T(flat )is, and that an animal's prior acclimatization state (high versus low) influences the acdimatory capacity of T-crit  . Approximately 2 months were required for the cardiac thermal performance of the high-zone mussels to reach that of the low-zone mussels, suggesting that acclimatization to high and variable temperatures may persist long enough to enable these animals to cope with intermittent bouts of heat stress.",2020,10.1242/jeb.222893,223,13,NA,jeb222893,Common garden; Constant submersion; Critical temperature; Flatline temperature; Heart rate; Heat stress; Intertidal zone; Mollusk; Mytilus californianus; Physiological plasticity; Thermal tolerance
article,Thermal stress causes DNA damage and mortality in a tropical insect,"Lubawy, Jan and Drabuon, Virginie and Chowanski, Szymon and Slocinska, Malgorzata and Colinet, Herve",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Cold tolerance is considered an important factor determining the geographic distribution of insects. We have previously shown that despite its tropical origin, the cockroach Gromphadorinha coquereliana is capable of surviving exposures to cold. However, the freezing tolerance of this species had not yet been examined. Low temperature is known to alter membrane integrity in insects, but whether chilling or freezing compromises DNA integrity remains a matter of speculation. In the present study, we subjected the G. coquereliana adults to freezing to determine their supercooling point (SCP) and evaluated whether the cockroaches were capable of surviving partial and complete freezing. Next, we conducted single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assays to determine whether heat, cold and freezing altered hemocyte DNA integrity. The SCP of this species was high and around -4.76 degrees C, which is within the typical range of freezing-tolerant species. Most cockroaches survived to 1 day after partial ice formation (20\% mortality), but died progressively in the next few days after cold stress (70\% mortality after 4 days). One day after complete freezing, most insects died (70\% mortality), and after 4 days, 90\% of them had succumbed. The SCGE assays showed substantial levels of DNA damage in hemocytes. When cockroaches were heat-stressed, the level of DNA damage was similar to that observed in the freezing treatment, though all heat-stressed insects survived. The present study shows that G. coquereliana can be considered as moderately freeze-tolerant, and that extreme low temperature stress can affect DNA integrity, suggesting that this cockroach may possess an efficient DNA repair system.",2019,10.1242/jeb.213744,222,23,NA,jeb21374,Gromphadorhina coquereliana; Cockroach; Freezing; Heat stress; Comet assay; Supercooling point

D. and Denlinger, David L. and Lee, Jr., Richard E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Rapid cold hardening (RCH) is a type of beneficial phenotypic plasticity that occurs on extremely short time scales (minutes to hours) to enhance insects' ability to cope with cold snaps and diurnal temperature fluctuations. RCH has a well-established role in extending lower lethal limits, but its ability to prevent sublethal cold injury has received less attention. The Antarctic midge, Belgica antarctica, is Antarctica's only endemic insect and has a well-studied RCH response that extends freeze tolerance in laboratory conditions. However, the discriminating temperatures used in previous studies of RCH are far below those ever experienced in the field. Here, we tested the hypothesis that RCH protects against non-lethal freezing injury. Larvae of B. antarctica were exposed to control (2 degrees C), direct freezing (-9 degrees C for 24 h) or RCH (-5 degrees C for 2 h followed by -9 degrees C for 24 h). All larvae survived both freezing treatments, but RCH larvae recovered more quickly from freezing stress and had a significantly higher metabolic rate during recovery. RCH larvae also sustained less damage to fat body and midgut tissue and had lower expression of two heat shock protein transcripts (hsp60 and hsp90), which is consistent with RCH protecting against protein denaturation. The protection afforded by RCH resulted in energy savings; directly frozen larvae experienced a significant depletion in glycogen energy stores that was not observed in RCH larvae. Together, these results provide strong evidence that RCH protects against a variety of sublethal freezing injuries and allows insects to rapidly fine-tune their performance in thermally variable environments.",2019,10.1242/jeb.206011,222,15,NA,jeb206011,Acclimation; Antarctica; Freeze tolerance; Heat shock proteins; Phenotypic plasticity; Stress
article,Is there metabolic cold adaptation in terrestrial ectotherms? Exploring latitudinal compensation in the invasive snail <i>Cornu aspersum</i>,"Diego Gaitan-Espitia, Juan and Nespolo, Roberto",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Lower temperatures, extreme seasonality and shorter growing seasons at higher latitudes are expected to cause a decline in metabolic rates and annual growth rates of ectotherms. If a reduction in the rates of these biological processes involves a reduction in fitness, then organisms may evolve compensatory responses for the constraints imposed by high-latitude habitats. To test the existence of a latitudinal compensation in ectotherms, we used a common-garden experiment to investigate the extent to which the level of energy turnover (measured as standard metabolic rate, SMR) and the energy budget (energy allocation to growth) are affected by climatic constraints in three populations of the land snail Cornu aspersum, distributed across a latitudinal gradient of 1300 km in Chile. Our results did not support the existence of a latitudinal compensation in metabolic rates (metabolic cold adaptation). However, there was a countergradient variation (CnGV) for growth rate in which the highest latitudinal population exhibited greater growth rates than their counterparts from lower latitudes. Surprisingly, this CnGV pattern was accompanied by a lower apparent dry-matter digestibility, which could highlight a differential assimilation of ingested nutrients into somatic tissue, revealing enhanced growth efficiency in snails from the highest latitudinal habitat. Our evidence highlights that adjustments in energy allocation to the digestive machinery and to protein storage could act as a latitudinal compensation for enhanced growth efficiency in snails from the highest latitudinal population.",2014,10.1242/jeb.101261,217,13,2261-2267,NA,Metabolic rate; Countergradient variation; Energy allocation; Growth
article,Reduced ventricular excitability causes atrioventricular block and depression of heart rate in fish at critically high temperatures,"Haverinen, Jaakko and Vornanen, Matti",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"At critically high temperature, cardiac output in fish collapses as a result of depression of heart rate (bradycardia). However, the cause of bradycardia remains unresolved. To investigate this, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss; acclimated at 12 degrees C) were exposed to acute warming while electrocardiograms were recorded. From 12 degrees C to 25.3 degrees C, electrical excitation between different parts of the heart was coordinated, but above 25.3 degrees C, atrial and ventricular beating rates became partly dissociated because of 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) block. With further warming, atrial rate increased to a peak value of 188 +/- 22 beats min(-1) at 27 degrees C, whereas the ventricle rate peaked at 124 +/- 10 beats min(-1) at 25.3 degrees C and thereafter dropped to 111 +/- 15 beats min(-1) at 27 degrees C. In single ventricular myocytes, warming from 12 degrees C to 25 degrees C attenuated electrical excitability as evidenced by increases in rheobase current and the size of critical depolarization required to trigger action potential. Depression of excitability was caused by temperature-induced decrease in input resistance (sarcolemmal K+ leak via the outward l(K1 )current) of resting myocytes and decrease in inward charge transfer by the Na+ current (l(Na)) of active myocytes. Collectively, these findings show that at critically high temperatures AV block causes ventricular bradycardia owing to the increased excitation threshold of the ventricle, which is due to changes in the passive (resting ion leak) and active (inward charge movement) electrical properties of ventricular myocytes. The sequence of events from the level of ion channels to cardiac function in vivo provides a mechanistic explanation for the depression of cardiac output in fish at critically high temperature.",2020,10.1242/jeb.225227,223,12,NA,jeb225227,Fish heart; Electrocardiogram; Cardiac arrhythmia; Sodium current; Chronaxie; Rheobase
article,"Assessing the relative importance of environmental effects, carry-over effects and species differences in thermal stress resistance: a comparison of Drosophilids across field and laboratory generations","Schiffer, Michele and Hangartner, Sandra and Hoffmann, Ary A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"There is increasing interest in comparing species of related organisms for their susceptibility to thermal extremes in order to evaluate potential vulnerability to climate change. Comparisons are typically undertaken on individuals collected from the field with or without a period of acclimation. However, this approach does not allow the potential contributions of environmental and carry-over effects across generations to be separated from inherent species differences in susceptibility. To assess the importance of these different sources of variation, we here considered heat and cold resistance in Drosophilid species from tropical and temperate sites in the field and across two laboratory generations. Resistance in field-collected individuals tended to be lower when compared with F1 and F2 laboratory generations, and species differences in field flies were only weakly correlated to differences established under controlled rearing conditions, unlike in F1-F2 comparisons. This reflected large environmental effects on resistance associated with different sites and conditions experienced within sites. For the 8 h cold recovery assay there was no strong evidence of carry-over effects, whereas for the heat knockdown and 2 h cold recovery assays there was some evidence for such effects. However, for heat these were species specific in direction. Variance components for inherent species differences were substantial for resistance to heat and 8 h cold stress, but small for 2 h cold stress, though this may be a reflection of the species being considered in the comparisons. These findings highlight that inherent differences among species are difficult to characterise accurately without controlling for environmental sources of variation and carry-over effects. Moreover, they also emphasise the complex nature of carry-over effects that vary depending on the nature of stress traits and the species being evaluated.",2013,10.1242/jeb.085126,216,20,3790-3798,NA,plasticity; cold recovery; heat knockdown; epigenetic effects; transgenerational effects; acclimation

While little is known about their sensory capabilities, available knowledge suggests that spotted seals and other ice seals use sound to obtain information from the surrounding environment. To quantitatively assess their auditory capabilities, the hearing of two young spotted seals was tested using a psychophysical paradigm. Absolute detection thresholds for tonal sounds were measured in air and under water over the frequency range of hearing, and critical ratios were determined using octave-band masking noise in both media. The behavioral audiograms show a range of best sensitivity spanning four octaves in air, from approximately 0.6 to 11 kHz. The range of sensitive hearing extends across seven octaves in water, with lowest thresholds between 0.3 and 56 kHz. Critical ratio measurements were similar in air and water and increased monotonically from 12 dB at 0.1 kHz to 30 dB at 25.6 kHz, indicating that the auditory systems of these seals are quite efficient at extracting signals from background noise. This study demonstrates that spotted seals possess sound reception capabilities different from those previously described for ice seals, and more similar to those reported for harbor seals (Phoca vitulina). The results are consistent with the amphibious lifestyle of these seals and their apparent reliance on sound. The hearing data reported herein are the first available for spotted seals and can inform best management practices for this vulnerable species in a changing Arctic.",2014,10.1242/jeb.097469,217,5,726-734,NA,Spotted seal; Amphibious; Hearing; Arctic; Noise
article,Behaviour and muscle activity across the aquatic-terrestrial transition in <i>Polypterus senegalus</i>,"Lutek, Keegan and Foster, Kathleen L. and Standen, Emily M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Amphibious fishes moving from water to land experience continuous changes in environmental forces. How these subtle changes impact behavioural transitions cannot be resolved by comparisons of aquatic and terrestrial locomotion. For example, aquatic and terrestrial locomotion appear distinct in the actinopterygian fish Polypterus senegalus; however, it is unclear how gradual water level changes influence the transition between these locomotor behaviours. We tested the hypothesis in P. senegalus that swimming and walking are part of an incremental continuum of behaviour and muscle activity across the environmental transition from water to land rather than two discrete behaviours, as proposed by previous literature. We exposed P. senegalus to discrete environments from fully aquatic to fully terrestrial while recording body and pectoral fin kinematics and muscle activity. Anterior axial red muscle effort increases as water depth decreases; however, a typical swimming-like anterior-to-posterior wave of axial red muscle activity is always present, even during terrestrial locomotion, indicating gradual motor control changes. Thus, walking appears to be based on swimming-like axial muscle activity whereas kinematic differences between swimming and walking appear to be due to mechanical constraints. A discrete change in left-right pectoral fin coordination from in-phase to out-of-phase at 0.7 body depths relies on adductor muscle activity with a similar duty factor and adductor muscle effort that increases gradually as water depth decreases. Thus, despite distinct changes in kinematic timing, neuromuscular patterning is similar across the water depth continuum. As the observed, gradual increases in axial muscle effort reflect muscle activity changes between aquatic and terrestrial environments observed in other elongate fishes, a modified, swimming-like axial muscle activity pattern for terrestrial locomotion may be common among elongate amphibious fishes.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243902,225,23,NA,jeb243902,Amphibious fishes; Kinematics; Electromyography; Terrestrial locomotion; Polypterus; Locomotor transitions

However, little is known about physiological mechanisms mediating this interaction. To investigate the underpinnings of heat-hardening responses after acclimatization in warm seasons, we measured thermal tolerance plasticity, and compared transcriptomic and metabolomic changes after heat hardening at 33 or 37 degrees C followed by recovery of 3 or 24 h in an intertidal bivalve Sinonovacula constricta. Clams showed explicit heat-hardening responses after acclimatization in a warm season. The higher inducing temperature (37 degrees C) caused less effective heat-hardening effects than the inducing temperature that was closer to the seasonal maximum temperature (33 degrees C). Metabolomic analysis highlighted the elevated content of glycerophospholipids in all heat-hardened clams, which may help to maintain the structure and function of the membrane. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) tended to be upregulated after heat hardening at 37 degrees C but not at 33 degrees C, indicating that there was no complete dependency of heat-hardening effects on upregulated HSPs. Enhanced energy metabolism and decreased energy reserves were observed after heat hardening at 37 degrees C, suggesting more energy costs during exposure to a higher inducing temperature, which may restrict heat-hardening effects. These results highlight the mediating role of membrane lipid metabolism, heat shock responses and energy costs in the interaction between heat-hardening response and seasonal acclimatization, and contribute to the mechanistic understanding of evolutionary change and thermal plasticity during global climate change.",2021,10.1242/jeb.243031,224,19,NA,jeb243031,Climate change; Heat shock protein; Intertidal bivalve; Membrane lipids; Thermal plasticity

(l(K1)) ion currents (l(Na) is depressed at high temperatures while lK(1) is resistant to them). To examine the role of Na+ channel proteins in heat tolerance of l(Na), we compared temperature dependencies of zebrafish (Danio redo, warm-dwelling subtropical species) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss, cold-active temperate species) ventricular l(Na) and l(Na) generated by the cloned zebrafish and rainbow trout Na(v)1.4 and Na(v)1.5 Na+ channels in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings showed that zebrafish ventricular l(Na) has better heat tolerance and slower inactivation kinetics than rainbow trout ventricular l(Na). In contrast, heat tolerance and inactivation kinetics of zebrafish and rainbow trout Na(v)1.4 channels are similar when expressed in the identical cellular environment of HEK cells. The same applies to Na(v)1.5 channels. These findings indicate that thermal adaptation of ventricular l(Na) is largely achieved by differential expression of Na+ channel alpha subunits: zebrafish that tolerate higher temperatures mainly express the slower Na(v)1.5 isoform, while rainbow trout that prefer cold waters mainly express the faster Na(v)1.4 isoform. Differences in elasticity (stiffness) of the lipid bilayer and/or accessory protein subunits of the channel assembly may also be involved in thermal adaptation of l(Na).

However, experimental data supporting this hypothesis are scarce. Here, by using Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) as a model, the relationship between embryo vulnerability (to projected ocean acidification and warming) and homeostatic capacity was explored through parallel analyses of stage-specific mortality and in vitro activity and expression of major ion pumps (ATP-synthase, Na+/K+-ATPase, H+-ATPase) and co-transporters (NBC1, NKCC1). Immunolocalization of these transporters was used to study ionocyte morphology in newly hatched larvae. Treatment-related embryo mortality until hatching (+20\% due to acidification and warming) occurred primarily during an early period (gastrulation) characterized by extremely low ion transport capacity. Thereafter, embryo mortality decreased in parallel with an exponential increase in activity and expression of all investigated ion transporters. Significant changes in transporter activity and expression in response to acidification (+15\% activity) and warming (-30\% expression) indicate some potential for short-term acclimatization, although this is probably associated with energetic trade-offs. Interestingly, whole-larvae enzyme activity (supported by abundant epidermal ionocytes) reached levels similar to those previously measured in gill tissue of adult cod, suggesting that early-life stages without functional gills are better equipped in terms of ion homeostasis than previously thought. This study implies that the gastrulation period represents a critical transition from inherited (maternal) defenses to active homeostatic regulation, which facilitates enhanced resilience of later stages to environmental factors.",2020,10.1242/jeb.212589,223,11,NA,jeb212589,Ocean acidification; Early-life history; Ion regulation; Energy allocation; Critical period; Gastrulation; Atlantic cod
article,Self-supplementation and effects of dietary antioxidants during acute thermal stress,"Beaulieu, Michael and Haas, Anabel and Schaefer, H. Martin",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Thermal stress leads to increased production of reactive oxygen species. If an organism is not able to simultaneously mount an efficient antioxidant defense system, this may lead to increased oxidative damage, which is potentially deleterious in terms of health and fitness. Exposure to cold or heat is therefore expected to be associated with a high demand for antioxidants. In agreement, several studies have shown that supplementing the diet of thermally stressed organisms with antioxidants leads to a reduction of oxidative damage. However, whether organisms can actively supplement their diet with antioxidants to alleviate temperature-induced oxidative damage is unknown. Here, we show that captive Gouldian finches (Erythrura gouldiae) supplement their diet more with seeds rich in antioxidants below than within their thermoneutral zone. Moreover, having access to seeds rich in antioxidants at temperatures below thermoneutrality decreases their oxidative damage. These results indicate that, when facing a thermal challenge, animals are able to take advantage of the antioxidant properties of their food to improve their oxidative balance. Having access to food resources rich in antioxidants may therefore be of primary importance for organisms in their natural habitat, as it may help them to cope with oxidative constraints due to challenging temperature regimes.",2014,10.1242/jeb.092825,217,3,370-375,NA,Antioxidants; Birds; Diet; Feeding behavior; Temperature

We used bank voles (Myodes glareolus) from lines selected for high swim-induced aerobic metabolic rate, which have also increased basal metabolic rate, and unselected control lines. Adult females from three age classes - young (4 months), middle-aged (9 months) and old (16 months) - were maintained at room temperature (20 degrees C), and half of the lactating females were shaved to increase heat dissipation capacity. Old females from both selection lines had a decreased litter size, mass and growth rate. The peak-lactation average daily metabolic rate was higher in shaved than in unshaved mothers, and this difference was more profound among old than young and middle-aged voles (P=0.02). In females with large litters, milk production tended to be higher in shaved (least squares mean, LSM +/- s.e.: 73.0 +/- 4.74 kJ day-1) than in unshaved voles (61.8 +/- 4.78 kJ day-1; P=0.05), but there was no significan{''}t effect of fur removal on the growth rate [}4.47 +/- 2.29 g (4 days-1); P=0.45].

article,Effects of wave-driven water flow on the fast-start escape response of juvenile coral reef damselfishes,"Roche, Dominique G.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Fish often evade predators with a fast-start escape response. Studies typically examine this behaviour in still water despite water motion being an inherent feature of aquatic ecosystems. In shallow habitats, waves create complex flows that likely influence escape performance, particularly in small fishes with low absolute swimming speeds relative to environmental flows. I examined how wave-driven water flow affects the behaviour and kinematics of escape responses in juveniles of three coral reef damselfishes (Pomacentridae) with different body morphologies. Tropical damselfishes have similar fin and body shapes during early development, with the exception of body depth, a trait deemed important for postural control and stability. Wave-driven flow increased response latency in two of the three species tested: fish with a fusiform body responded 2.9 times slower in wave-driven flow than in still water, whereas this differencewas less pronounced in fish with an intermediate body depth (1.9 times slower response) and absent in fish with a laterally compressed body. The effect of wave-driven flow on swimming performance (cumulative escape distance and turning rate) was variable and depended on the timing and trajectory of escape responses in relation to the wave phase. Given intense predation pressure on juvenile coral reef fishes during settlement, interspecific differences in how wave-driven flow affects their ability to escape predators could influence the distribution and abundance of species across spatial and temporal scales.",2021,10.1242/jeb.234351,224,6,NA,jeb234351,Body morphology; Complex flow; Swimming performance; Postural disturbance; Predator-prey interactions; Turbulence

An extended heatwave and recovery time-series that incorporates multiple stressors and is environmentally realistic can provide enhanced predictive capacity for performance under climate change conditions. We exposed common reef-building corals in Hawai'i, Montipora capitata and Pocillopora acuta , to a 2-month period of high temperature and high P CO 2 conditions or ambient conditions in a factorial design, followed by 2 months of ambient conditions. High temperature, rather than high P CO 2 , drove multivariate physiology shifts through time in both species, including decreases in respiration rates and endosymbiont densities. Pocillopora acuta exhibited more significantly negatively altered physiology, and substantially higher bleaching and mortality than M. capitata . The sensitivity of P. acuta appears to be driven by higher baseline rates of photosynthesis paired with lower host antioxidant capacity, creating an increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. Thermal tolerance of M. capitata may be partly due to harboring a mixture of Cladocopium and Durusdinium spp., whereas P. acuta was dominated by other distinct Cladocopium spp. Only M. capitata survived the experiment, but physiological state in heatwaveexposed M. capitata remained significantly diverged at the end of recovery relative to individuals that experienced ambient conditions. In future climate scenarios, particularly marine heatwaves, our results indicate a species-specific loss of corals that is driven by baseline host and symbiont physiological differences as well as Symbiodiniaceae community compositions, with the surviving species experiencing physiological legacies that are likely to influence future stress responses.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246812,227,11,NA,jeb246812,Thermal tolerance; Ocean acidification; Coral-algal symbiosis; Coral bleaching; Symbiodiniaceae communities; Stress and recovery periods

Y.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Respiration rates of ectothermic organisms are affected by environmental temperatures, and sustainable metabolism at high temperatures sometimes limits heat tolerance. Organisms are hypothesized to exhibit acclimatory metabolic compensation effects, decelerating their metabolic processes below Arrhenius expectations based on temperature alone. We tested the hypothesis that either heritable or plastic heat tolerance differences can be explained by metabolic compensation in the eurythermal freshwater zooplankton crustacean Daphnia magna. We measured respiration rates in a ramp-up experiment over a range of assay temperatures (5-37 degrees C) in eight genotypes of D. magna representing a range of previously reported acute heat tolerances and, at a narrower range of temperatures (10-35 degrees C), in D. magna with different acclimation history (either 10 or 25 degrees C). We discovered no difference in temperature-specific respiration rates between heat-tolerant and heat-sensitive genotypes. In contrast, we observed acclimation-specific compensatory differences in respiration rates at both extremes of the temperature range studied. Notably, there was a deceleration of oxygen consumption at higher temperature in 25 degrees C-acclimated D. magna relative to their 10 degrees C-acclimated counterparts, observed in active animals, a pattern corroborated by similar changes in filtering rate and, partly, by changes in mitochondrial membrane potential. A recovery experiment indicated that the reduction of respiration was not caused by irreversible damage during exposure to a sublethal temperature. Response time necessary to acquire the respiratory adjustment to high temperature was lower than for low temperature, indicating that metabolic compensation at lower temperatures requires slower, possibly structural changes.",2021,10.1242/jeb.237727,224,4,NA,jeb237727,Acclimation; Daphnia; Plasticity; Respiration; Temperature
article,Cling performance and surface area of attachment in plethodontid salamanders,"O'Donnell, Mary Kate and Deban, Stephen M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Plethodontid salamanders inhabit terrestrial, scansorial, arboreal and troglodytic habitats in which clinging and climbing allow them to access additional food and shelter as well as escape from unfavorable temperature and moisture conditions and ground-dwelling predators. Although salamanders lack claws and toe pads found in other taxa, they successfully cling to and climb on inclined, vertical and inverted substrates in nature. Maximum cling angle was tested on smooth acrylic, and the relationship between cling angle, body mass and surface area of attachment (contact area) was investigated. This study found that many salamander spades can cling fully inverted using only a portion of their ventral surface area to attach. Salamanders fall into three functional groups based on mass and maximum cling angle: (1) high-performing, very small salamanders, (2) moderately high performing small and medium-sized salamanders and (3) low-performing large salamanders. They show significant differences in maximum cling angle, even between species of similar mass. In species of similar mass experiencing significantly different detachment stress (resulting from significantly different contact area), differences in morphology or behavior affect how much body surface is attached to the substrate. High performance in some species, such as Desmognathus quadramaculatus, is attributable to large contact area; low performance in a similarly sized species, Ensatina eschscholtzii, is due to behavior that negatively impacts contact area. There was no clear evidence of scaling of adhesive strength with increasing body size. Salamander maximum cling angle is the result of morphology and behavior impacting the detachment stresses experienced during clinging.",2020,10.1242/jeb.211706,223,17,NA,jeb211706,Adhesion; Contact area; Performance; Scansorial

Although the vast majority of pLGICs appear to be neurotransmitter receptors, the identification of pLGICs in non-neuronal tissues and homologous pLGIC-like proteins in prokaryotes points to biological functions, possibly ancestral, that are independent of neuronal signalling. Here, we report the molecular and physiological characterization of a highly divergent, orphan pLGIC subunit encoded by the pHCl-2 (CG11340) gene, in Drosophila melanogaster. We show that pHCl-2 forms a channel that is insensitive to a wide array of neurotransmitters, but is instead gated by changes in extracellular pH. pHCl-2 is expressed in the Malpighian tubules, which are non-innervated renal-type secretory tissues. We demonstrate that pHCl-2 is localized to the apical membrane of the epithelial principal cells of the tubules and that loss of pHCl-2 reduces urine production during diuresis. Our data implicate pHCl-2 as an important source of chloride conductance required for proper urine production, highlighting a novel role for pLGICs in epithelial tissues regulating fluid secretion and osmotic homeostasis.",2016,10.1242/jeb.141069,219,17,2629-2638,NA,pLGIC; Cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel; Renal; Diuresis
article,Water surface locomotion in tropical canopy ants,"Yanoviak, S. P. and Frederick, D. N.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Upon falling onto the water surface, most terrestrial arthropods helplessly struggle and are quickly eaten by aquatic predators. Exceptions to this outcome mostly occur among riparian taxa that escape by walking or swimming at the water surface. Here we document sustained, directional, neustonic locomotion (i.e. surface swimming) in tropical arboreal ants. We dropped 35 species of ants into natural and artificial aquatic settings in Peru and Panama to assess their swimming ability. Ten species showed directed surface swimming at speeds >3 body lengths s(-1), with some swimming at absolute speeds >10 cm s(-1). Ten other species exhibited partial swimming ability characterized by relatively slow but directed movement. The remaining species showed no locomotory control at the surface. The phylogenetic distribution of swimming among ant genera indicates parallel evolution and a trend toward negative association with directed aerial descent behavior. Experiments with workers of Odontomachus bauri showed that they escape from the water by directing their swimming toward dark emergent objects (i.e. skototaxis). Analyses of high-speed video images indicate that Pachycondyla spp. and O. bauri use a modified alternating tripod gait when swimming; they generate thrust at the water surface via synchronized treading and rowing motions of the contralateral fore and mid legs, respectively, while the hind legs provide roll stability. These results expand the list of facultatively neustonic terrestrial taxa to include various species of tropical arboreal ants.",2014,10.1242/jeb.101600,217,12,2163-2170,NA,Aquatic; Behavior; Forest; Formicidae; Neustonic; Skototaxis

In humans, mutations affecting monoamine oxidase (MAO), the serotonin-degrading enzyme, are highly deleterious. Yet, blind cavefish of the species Astyanax mexicanus carry a partial loss-of-function mutation in MAO (P106L) and thrive in their subterranean environment. Here, we established four fish lines, corresponding to the blind cave-dwelling and the sighted river-dwelling morphs of this species, with or without the mutation, in order to decipher the exact contribution of mao P106L in the evolution of cavefish neurobehavioral traits. Unexpectedly, although mao P106L appeared to be an excellent candidate for the genetic determinism of the loss of aggressive and schooling behaviors in cavefish, we demonstrated that it was not the case. Similarly, the anatomical variations in monoaminergic systems observed between cavefish and surface fish brains were independent from mao P106L, and rather due to other, morph-dependent developmental processes. However, we found that mao P106L strongly affected anxiety-like behaviors. Cortisol measurements showed lower basal levels and an increased amplitude of stress response after a change of environment in fish carrying the mutation. Finally, we studied the distribution of the P106L mao allele in wild populations of cave and river A. mexicanus, and discovered that the mutant allele was present - and sometimes fixed - in all populations inhabiting caves of the Sierra de El Abra. The possibility that this partial loss-of-function mao allele evolves under a selective or a neutral regime in the particular cave environment is discussed.",2020,10.1242/jeb.226092,223,18,NA,jeb226092,Cortisol; Dopamine; Environmental change; Serotonin

Despite the importance of understanding the mechanistic bases of growth, predicting size variation in early stages of development remains challenging. Pedigreed lines of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) were crossed to produce contrasting growth phenotypes to analyze the metabolic bases of growth variation in larval stages. Under controlled environmental conditions, substantial growth variation of up to 430\% in shell length occurred among 12 larval families. Protein was the major biochemical constituent in larvae, with an average protein-to-lipid content ratio of 2.8. On average, 86\% of protein synthesized was turned over (i.e. only 14\% retained as protein accreted), with a regulatory shift in depositional efficiency resulting in increased protein accretion during later larval growth. Variation in protein depositional efficiency among families did not explain the range in larval growth rates. Instead, changes in protein synthesis rates predicted 72\% of growth variation. High rates of protein synthesis to support faster growth, in turn, necessitated greater allocation of the total ATP pool to protein synthesis. An ATP allocation model is presented for larvae of C. gigas that includes the major components (82\%) of energy demand: protein synthesis (45\%), ion pump activity (20\%), shell formation (14\%) and protein degradation (3\%). The metabolic tradeoffs between faster growth and the need for higher ATP allocation to protein synthesis could be a major determinant of fitness for larvae of different genotypes responding to the stress of environmental change.",2018,10.1242/jeb.171967,221,10,NA,jeb171967,Protein synthesis; Development; Larvae; Pacific oyster; Pedigreed lines; Metabolic trade-offs
article,Hormonal responsiveness to stress is negatively associated with vulnerability to angling capture in fish,"Louison, Michael J. and Adhikari, Shivani and Stein, Jeffrey A. and Suski, Cory D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Differences in behavior and physiology amongst individuals often alter relative fitness levels in the environment. However, the ideal behavioral/physiological phenotype in a given environment may be altered by human activity, leading to an evolutionary response in the affected population. One example of this process can be found in fisheries (including recreational freshwater fisheries), where selective capture and harvest of individuals with certain phenotypes can drive evolutionary change. While some life history traits and behavioral tendencies influencing capture likelihood have been studied, the physiological mechanisms driving this vulnerability remain poorly understood. To address this, we assessed how two major physiological characteristics (hormonal responsiveness to stress and metabolic phenotype) and one behavioral characteristic (boldness) impact the likelihood of an individual being captured by anglers. Largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, derived from a population artificially selected for differential angling vulnerability were assessed for boldness and for stress responsiveness (as indicated by plasma cortisol levels) following an air-exposure challenge. Largemouth bass were then stocked into a pond where experimental angling trials took place, and a subset of captured and uncaptured fish were afterwards assessed for metabolic phenotype. The results showed that stress responsiveness was the primary driver of angling vulnerability, with individuals that experienced lower rises in cortisol following the air-exposure challenge more likely to be captured. Neither boldness nor metabolic phenotype influenced capture probability. The results from this study indicate that fisheries-induced selective pressure may act on physiology, potentially altering stress responsiveness and its associated behaviors in populations exploited by recreational anglers.",2017,10.1242/jeb.150730,220,14,2529-2535,NA,Fisheries-induced evolution; Largemouth bass; Stress-coping style; Behavioral syndromes; Metabolic rate

However, several gourami species also exhibit apparently similar `shooting' behaviour, spitting water up to 5 cm above the surface. In a series of experiments, we explored the shooting behaviour and aspects of its significance as a foraging ability in the dwarf gourami (Trichogaster lalius). We investigated sex differences in shooting abilities to determine whether gourami shooting is related to the sexspecific bubble nest manufacture where males mix air and water at the surface to form bubbles. We found that, actually, both sexes were equally able to shoot and could learn to shoot a novel target. In a second experiment, we presented untrained gouramis with opportunities to shoot at live prey and found they successfully shot down both fruit flies and crickets. Finally, we explored the effect of target height on shooting performance to establish potential constraints of shooting as a foraging ability. The frequency of attempted shots and success of hitting targets decreased with height, whereas latency to shoot increased. We also observed that repeatable individual differences account for variation in these measures of shooting performance. Together, our results provide evidence that gourami shooting has a foraging function analogous to that of archerfish. Gourami shooting may serve as an example of convergent evolution and provide opportunities for comparative studies into the, as yet unexplored, ecology and evolution of shooting in fishes.",2021,10.1242/jeb.243477,224,24,NA,jeb243477,Ballistic predation; Gourami; Shooting; Trichogaster lalius; Foraging adaptation
article,Distress sounds of thorny catfishes emitted underwater and in air: characteristics and potential significance,"Knight, Lisa and Ladich, Friedrich",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Thorny catfishes produce stridulation (SR) sounds using their pectoral fins and drumming (DR) sounds via a swimbladder mechanism in distress situations when hand held in water and in air. It has been argued that SR and DR sounds are aimed at different receivers (predators) in different media. The aim of this study was to analyse and compare sounds emitted in both air and water in order to test different hypotheses on the functional significance of distress sounds. Five representatives of the family Doradidae were investigated. Fish were hand held and sounds emitted in air and underwater were recorded (number of sounds, sound duration, dominant and fundamental frequency, sound pressure level and peak-to-peak amplitudes). All species produced SR sounds in both media, but DR sounds could not be recorded in air for two species. Differences in sound characteristics between media were small and mainly limited to spectral differences in SR. The number of sounds emitted decreased over time, whereas the duration of SR sounds increased. The dominant frequency of SR and the fundamental frequency of DR decreased and sound pressure level of SR increased with body size across species. The hypothesis that catfish produce more SR sounds in air and more DR sounds in water as a result of different predation pressure (birds versus fish) could not be confirmed. It is assumed that SR sounds serve as distress sounds in both media, whereas DR sounds might primarily be used as intraspecific communication signals in water in species possessing both mechanisms.",2014,10.1242/jeb.110957,217,22,4068-4078,NA,Water versus air; Sound characteristics; Doradidae; Stridulation sounds; Drumming sounds; Distress sounds; Predation

Despite their simple gross morphology, these appendages are physically distinct along the anterior-posterior axis, and ultrastructural evidence suggests zonation of function within the structures. Individual caeca from three sections (anterior, middle and posterior) were removed from the intestine of freshwater rainbow trout and investigated for ion transport and enzyme activity. Ca2+ absorption appeared as a combination of active and passive movement, with Michaelis-Menten kinetics observable under symmetrical conditions, and was inhibited by several pharmacological agents (ouabain, La3+ and a calmodulin antagonist). There was a decrease in ion transport function from adjacent to the intestine (proximal) to the distal tip of each caecum, along with decreasing transport from anterior to posterior for the proximal portion alone. Feeding increased the J(Max) and K-M for Ca2+ absorption within all sections, whereas ion-poor water (IPW) exposure further increased the J(Max) and K-M for Ca2+ transport in the anterior and middle sections. Increased Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) and citrate synthase (CS) activity rates paralleled trends seen in Ca2+ transport. Feeding in freshwater and IPW exposure increased the glycolytic capacity of the caeca via increased pyruvate kinase (PK) and decreased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, while amino acid metabolism increased with IPW exposure through increased glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) activity. Overall, feeding and IPW exposure each altered ionoregulation within the caeca of freshwater rainbow trout in a zone-specific pattern, with the anterior and proximal portions of the caeca being most affected. Increased carbohydrate and protein metabolism fueled the increased ATP demand of NKA through CS.",2019,10.1242/jeb.187484,222,7,NA,jeb187484,Digestion; Gastrointestinal tract; Ionoregulation; Ion-poor water; Metabolic enzymes

We tracked individual behaviour (a) in simultaneous double-choice chambers, where live conspecifics of each sex were presented in water and (b) of freely moving pairs on agar without water. We found that males, but not females, preferentially associated with opposite-sex individuals in trials conducted in water. In contrast, neither sex detected nor followed cues deposited on agar. In conclusion, our study suggests thatmate discrimination and approach are male-specific traits and are limited to waterborne chemical cues.

article,Multiplexed modulation of behavioral choice,"Palmer, Chris R. and Barnett, Megan N. and Copado, Saul and Gardezy, Fred and Kristan, Jr., William B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Stimuli in the environment, as well as internal states, influence behavioral choice. Of course, animals are often exposed to multiple external and internal factors simultaneously, which makes the ultimate determinants of behavior quite complex. We observed the behavioral responses of European leeches, Hirudo verbana, as we varied one external factor (surrounding water depth) with either another external factor (location of tactile stimulation along the body) or an internal factor (body distention following feeding). Stimulus location proved to be the primary indicator of behavioral response. In general, anterior stimulation produced shortening behavior, midbody stimulation produced local bending, and posterior stimulation usually produced either swimming or crawling but sometimes a hybrid of the two. By producing a systematically measured map of behavioral responses to body stimulation, we found wide areas of overlap between behaviors. When we varied the surrounding water depth, this map changed significantly, and a new feature - rotation of the body along its long axis prior to swimming - appeared. We found additional interactions between water depth and time since last feeding. A large blood meal initially made the animals crawl more and swim less, an effect that was attenuated as water depth increased. The behavioral map returned to its pre- feeding form after approximately 3 weeks as the leeches digested their blood meal. In summary, we found multiplexed impacts on behavioral choice, with the map of responses to tactile stimulation modified by water depth, which itself modulated the impact that feeding had on the decision to swim or crawl.",2014,10.1242/jeb.098749,217,16,2963-2973,NA,Leech; Behavioral choice; Feeding; Environmental context; Behavioral response map
article,Mechanical challenges to freshwater residency in sharks and rays,"Gleiss, Adrian C. and Potvin, Jean and Keleher, James J. and Whitty, Jeff M. and Morgan, David L. and Goldbogen, Jeremy A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Major transitions between marine and freshwater habitats are relatively infrequent, primarily as a result of major physiological and ecological challenges. Few species of cartilaginous fish have evolved to occupy freshwater habitats. Current thought suggests that the metabolic physiology of sharks has remained a barrier to the diversification of this taxon in freshwater ecosystems. Here, we demonstrate that the physical properties of water provide an additional constraint for this species-rich group to occupy freshwater systems. Using hydromechanical modeling, we show that occurrence in fresh water results in a two-to three-fold increase in negative buoyancy for sharks and rays. This carries the energetic cost of lift production and results in increased buoyancy-dependent mechanical power requirements for swimming and increased optimal swim speeds. The primary source of buoyancy, the lipid-rich liver, offers only limited compensation for increased negative buoyancy as a result of decreasing water density; maintaining the same submerged weight would involve increasing the liver volume by very large amounts: 3- to 4-fold in scenarios where liver density is also reduced to currently observed minimal levels and 8-fold without any changes in liver density. The first data on body density from two species of elasmobranch occurring in freshwater (the bull shark Carcharhinus leucas, Muller and Henle 1839, and the largetooth sawfish Pristis pristis, Linnaeus 1758) support this hypothesis, showing similar liver sizes as marine forms but lower liver densities, but the greatest negative buoyancies of any elasmobranch studied to date. Our data suggest that the mechanical challenges associated with buoyancy control may have hampered the invasion of freshwater habitats in elasmobranchs, highlighting an additional key factor that may govern the predisposition of marine organisms to successfully establish in freshwater habitats.",2015,10.1242/jeb.114868,218,7,1099-1110,NA,Buoyancy; Liver; Tissue density; Locomotion; Lift; Drag

The ventral eye may detect water by its polarization sensitivity, even if the insect is resting with its head slightly tipped down on a raised surface. The polarization sensitivity and polarotaxis in springtails (Collembola) have not been investigated. Therefore, we performed behavioural choice experiments to study them in P. aquatica. We found that the strength of phototaxis in P. aquatica depends on the polarization characteristics of stimulating light. Horizontally and vertically polarized light were the most and least attractive, respectively, while unpolarized stimulus elicited moderate attraction. We show that horizontally polarized light attracts more springtails than unpolarized, even if the polarized stimulus was 10 times dimmer. Thus, besides phototaxis, P. aquatica also performs polarotaxis with the ability to measure or at least estimate the degree of polarization.

We hereby provide the first comparative study of the physical properties of venom in spitting and non-spitting cobras. We measured the viscosity, protein concentration and pH of the venom of 13 cobra species of the genus Naja from Africa and Asia, alongside the spitting elapid Hemachatus haemachatus and the non-spitting viper Bitis arietans. By using published microCT scans, we calculated the pressure required to eject venom through the fangs of a spitting and a non-spitting cobra. Despite the differences in the modes of venom delivery, we found no significant differences between spitters and non-spitters in the rheological and physical properties of the studied venoms. Furthermore, all analysed venoms showed a Newtonian flow behaviour, in contrast to previous reports.

article,Surface tension dominates insect flight on fluid interfaces,"Mukundarajan, Haripriya and Bardon, Thibaut C. and Kim, Dong Hyun and Prakash, Manu",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Flight on the 2D air-water interface, with body weight supported by surface tension, is a unique locomotion strategy well adapted for the environmental niche on the surface of water. Although previously described in aquatic insects like stoneflies, the biomechanics of interfacial flight has never been analysed. Here, we report interfacial flight as an adapted behaviour in waterlily beetles (Galerucella nymphaeae) which are also dexterous airborne fliers. We present the first quantitative biomechanical model of interfacial flight in insects, uncovering an intricate interplay of capillary, aerodynamic and neuromuscular forces. We show that waterlily beetles use their tarsal claws to attach themselves to the interface, via a fluid contact line pinned at the claw. We investigate the kinematics of interfacial flight trajectories using high-speed imaging and construct a mathematical model describing the flight dynamics. Our results show that non-linear surface tension forces make interfacial flight energetically expensive compared with airborne flight at the relatively high speeds characteristic of waterlily beetles, and cause chaotic dynamics to arise naturally in these regimes. We identify the crucial roles of capillary-gravity wave drag and oscillatory surface tension forces which dominate interfacial flight, showing that the air-water interface presents a radically modified force landscape for flapping wing flight compared with air.",2016,10.1242/jeb.127829,219,5,752-766,NA,Interfacial flight; Biomechanics; Capillary waves; Capillary-gravity wave drag; Chaos
article,Physical gills in diving insects and spiders: theory and experiment,"Seymour, Roger S. and Matthews, Philip G. D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Insects and spiders rely on gas-filled airways for respiration in air. However, some diving species take a tiny air-store bubble from the surface that acts as a primary O-2 source and also as a physical gill to obtain dissolved O-2 from the water. After a long history of modelling, recent work with O-2-sensitive optodes has tested the models and extended our understanding of physical gill function. Models predict that compressible gas gills can extend dives up to more than eightfold, but this is never reached, because the animals surface long before the bubble is exhausted. Incompressible gas gills are theoretically permanent. However, neither compressible nor incompressible gas gills can support even resting metabolic rate unless the animal is very small, has a low metabolic rate or ventilates the bubble's surface, because the volume of gas required to produce an adequate surface area is too large to permit diving. Diving-bell spiders appear to be the only large aquatic arthropods that can have gas gill surface areas large enough to supply resting metabolic demands in stagnant, oxygenated water, because they suspend a large bubble in a submerged web.",2013,10.1242/jeb.070276,216,2,164-170,NA,physical gill; compressible gas gill; plastron; gill factor; respiration; model; optode; scaling

The `feature' being manipulated is the presence of a single blue circle among three circles marking the location of a small sucrose reward. That is, a `feature-negative' target had three white circles, while a `feature-positive' target had two white circles and one blue one. Two experiments were performed. In both experiments, each bee was tested under two different reward scenarios (treatments). In the first experiment, during the feature-positive treatment bees received 4 mu l of 2 mol l(-1) sucrose when choosing the feature-positive plate, but received 4 mu l of saturated NaCl solution (saltwater) when choosing the feature-negative plate. During the feature-negative treatment, bees were rewarded when visiting the feature-negative plate, while visitation to the feature-positive plate only offered bees the saltwater. The second experiment was a repeat of the first except that pure water was offered instead of saltwater in the non-rewarding feeding plate. As an experimental control, a set of bees was offered sequential trials where both the feature-positive and feature-negative plates offered the sucrose reward. Bee feeding plate choice differed between the feature-positive and feature-negative treatments in both experiments. Bees favored the feeding plate type with the sucrose reward in each treatment, and never consumed the saltwater or pure water when encountered in either treatment. Further, behavior of bees during both the feature-positive and feature-negative treatments differed from that of control bees. However, neither feature-positive nor feature-negative learning reached high levels of success. Further, a feature-positive effect was seen when pure water was offered; bees learned to solve the feature-positive problem more rapidly. When we tested bees using simply the choice of blue versus white targets, where one color held the sucrose reward and the other the saltwater, a bee's fidelity to the color offering the sucrose reward quickly reached very high levels.",2013,10.1242/jeb.069088,216,2,224-229,NA,Apis mellifera; feature-positive; feature-negative; discrimination conditioning

In vitro fertilization by an injection of cryopreserved sperm into eggs has been proven to be effective for the maintenance of strains in mammals. The technique of artificial egg activation is a prerequisite for the establishment of in vitro fertilization by sperm injection. We demonstrated that artificial egg activation is feasible in the malaria vector mosquito, Anopheles stephensi (Diptera, Culicidae). Nearly 100\% of eggs dissected from virgin females immersed in distilled water darkened, similar to normally oviposited fertilized eggs. It was revealed by the cytological examination of chromosomes that meiotic arrest was relieved in these eggs approximately 20 min after incubation in water. Biochemical examinations revealed that MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)/ERK (extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase) and MEK (MAPK/ERK kinase) were dephosphorylated similar to that in fertilized eggs. These results indicate that dissected unfertilized eggs were activated in distilled water and started development. Injection of distilled water into body cavity of the virgin blood-fed females also induced activation of a portion of eggs in the ovaries. The technique of artificial egg activation is expected to contribute to the success of in vitro fertilization in A. stephensi.",2013,10.1242/jeb.084293,216,15,2960-2966,NA,egg activation; meiosis; in vitro fertilization; insect; mosquito; Anopheles stephensi
article,Swimming in unsteady water flows: is turning in a changing flow an energetically expensive endeavor for fish?,"Schakmann, Mathias and Steffensen, John F. and Bushnell, Peter G. and Korsmeyer, Keith E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Unsteady, dynamic flow regimes commonly found in shallow marine ecosystems such as coral reefs pose an energetic challenge for mobile organisms that typically depend on station-holding for fitness-related activities. The majority of experimental studies, however, have measured energetic costs of locomotion at steady speeds, with only a few studies measuring the effects of oscillatory flows. In this study, we used a bidirectional swimming respirometer to create six oscillatory water flow regimes consisting of three frequency and amplitude combinations for both unidirectional and bidirectional oscillatory flows. Using the goldring surgeonfish, Ctenochaetus strigosus, a pectoral-fin (labriform) swimmer, we quantified the net cost of swimming (swimming metabolic rate minus standard metabolic rate) associated with station-holding under these various conditions. We determined that the swimming costs of station-holding in the bidirectional flow regime increased by 2-fold compared with costs based on swimming over the same range of speeds at steady velocities. Furthermore, as we found minimal differences in energetic costs associated with station-holding in the unidirectional, oscillating flow compared with that predicted from steady swimming costs, we conclude that the added acceleration costs are minimal, while the act of turning is an energetically expensive endeavor for this reef fish species.",2020,10.1242/jeb.212795,223,6,NA,jeb212795,Wave surge; Costs of swimming; Labriform; Respirometry
article,Heterogeneity of neuromasts in a fish without lateral line canals: the pufferfish (<i>Takifugu obscurus</i>) model,"Li, Chao and Wang, Xiaojie and Wu, Jianyong and Zhang, Xuguang and Fan, Chunxin and Guo, Hongyi and Song, Jiakun",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Fish detect water motion with their mechanosensory lateral line. The basic functional unit of the lateral line is the neuromast. In most fish species, neuromasts are located in lateral line canals (canal neuromasts) or on the skin (superficial neuromasts). In this paper, we describe the lateral line system of the pufferfish, Takifugu obscurus. If threatened, this fish inflates its body by sucking water into the esophagus. Pufferfish lack a canal system but have neuromasts located directly on the skin or in open grooves. Each groove houses tall, medium and short neuromasts, based on the height of their pedestal. One or more medium neuromasts were always located between two tall neuromasts, and the short neuromasts were scattered between them. Tall neuromasts showed phasic responses to water jets, similar to the canal neuromasts of other fish species. In contrast, the medium and short neuromasts showed tonic responses to water jets. The response properties of nerve fibers that innervated the medium and short neuromasts were similar to those of the superficial neuromasts found in other fish species. Our results suggest that each groove of a pufferfish has two functional groups of neuromasts. This may allow pufferfish to extract spatial and temporal hydrodynamic information, despite the changes in body shape that occur during and after inflation. The short neuromasts at the bottom of a groove most likely supplement the medium neuromasts when the body is maximally inflated.",2018,10.1242/jeb.186163,221,19,NA,jeb186163,Lateral line groove; Tall neuromast; Medium neuromast; Short neuromast; Neuromast pedestal
article,Field swimming behavior in largemouth bass deviates from predictions based on economy and propulsive efficiency,"Han, Angela X. and Berlin, Caroline and Ellerby, David J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Locomotion is energetically expensive. This may create selection pressures that favor economical locomotor strategies, such as the adoption of low-cost speeds and efficient propulsive movements. For swimming fish, the energy expended to travel a unit distance, or cost of transport (COT), has a U-shaped relationship to speed. The relationship between propulsive kinematics and speed, summarized by the Strouhal number (St=fA/U, where f is tail beat frequency, A is tail tip amplitude in m and U is swimming speed in ms(-1)), allows for maximal propulsive efficiency where 0.2<St<0.4. Largemouth bass adopted field speeds that were generally below the range predicted to minimize their COT. This may reflect speed modulation to meet competing functional demands such as enabling effective prey detection and capture. St exceeded the optimal range for the lowest observed swimming speeds. Mechanical and physiological constraints may prevent adoption of efficient St during low-speed swimming.",2017,10.1242/jeb.158345,220,18,3204-3208,NA,Kinematics; Micropterus; Strouhal number; Cost of transport; Field behavior

H. and Wienands, Charlotte E. and Wilburn, Brittany P. and Blob, Richard W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"During evolutionary reinvasions of water by terrestrial vertebrates, ancestrally tubular limb bones often flatten to form flippers. Differences in skeletal loading between land and water might have facilitated such changes. In turtles, femoral shear strains are significantly lower during swimming than during walking, potentially allowing a release from loads favoring tubular shafts. However, flipper-like morphology in specialized tetrapod swimmers is most accentuated in the forelimbs. To test whether the forelimbs of turtles also experience reduced torsional loading in water, we compared strains on the humerus of river cooters (Pseudemys concinna) between swimming and terrestrial walking. We found that humeral shear strains are also lower during swimming than during terrestrial walking; however, this appears to relate to a reduction in overall strain magnitude, rather than a specific reduction in twisting. These results indicate that shear strains show similar reductions between swimming and walking for forelimb and hindlimb, but these reductions are produced through different mechanisms.",2017,10.1242/jeb.156836,220,21,3873-3877,NA,Biomechanics; Bone strain; Pseudemys concinna; Evolution; Locomotion

J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Teleost fishes and mammalian lineages diverged 400 million years ago, and environmental requirements (water versus air) have resulted in marked differences in cardiovascular function between fish and mammals. Suggestions that the fish secondary vascular system (SVS) could be used as a model for the mammalian lymphatic system should be taken with caution. Despite molecular markers indicating similar genetic origin, functions of the SVS in teleost fish are probably different from those of the mammalian lymphatic system. We determined that, in resting glass catfish (Kryptopterus bicirrhis), plasma moves from the primary vascular system (PVS) to the SVS through small connecting vessels less than 10 m in diameter, smaller than the red blood cells (RBCs). During and following hypoxia or exercise, flow increases and RBCs enter the SVS, possibly via beta-adrenoreceptor-mediated dilation of the connecting vessels. The volume of the SVS can be large and, as RBCs flow into the SVS, the haematocrit of the PVS falls by as much as 50\% of the resting value. Possible functions of the SVS, including skin respiration, ionic and osmotic buffering, and reductions in heart work and RBC turnover, are discussed.",2014,10.1242/jeb.086348,217,5,751-757,NA,Lymphatic; Secondary vascular system; Stress

Here we have characterized three full-length aqp8 paralogs from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Bayesian inference revealed that each paralog is a representative of the three major classes of aqp8aa, aqp8ab and aqp8b genes found in other teleosts. The permeability properties were studied by heterologous expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes, and the expression levels examined by qPCR, immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, and immunoblotting of membrane fractions from intestines of SW-challenged smolts. All three Aqp8 paralogs were permeable to water and urea, whereas Aqp8ab and -8b were, surprisingly, also permeable to glycerol. The mRNA tissue distribution of each paralog was distinct, although some tissues such as the intestine showed redundant expression of more than one paralog. Immunofluorescence microscopy localized Aqp8aa(1+2) to intracellular compartments of the liver and intestine, and Aqp8ab and Aqp8b to apical plasma membrane domains of the intestinal epithelium, with Aqp8b also in goblet cells. In a control experiment with rainbow trout, immunoelectron microscopy confirmed abundant labeling of Aqp8ab and -8b at apical plasma membranes of enterocytes in the middle intestine and also in subapical vesicular structures. During SW challenge, Aqp8ab showed significantly increased levels of protein expression in plasma-membrane-enriched fractions of the intestine. These data indicate that the Atlantic salmon Aqp8 paralogs have neofunctionalized on a transcriptional as well as a functional level, and that Aqp8ab may play a central role in the intestinal transcellular uptake of water during SW acclimation.",2013,10.1242/jeb.087890,216,20,3873-3885,NA,aquaporin; evolution; osmoregulation; salmon; intestine; neofunctionalization

The objectives of this study were to (i) simultaneously evaluate the effects of environmental and individual variables on DEE and RMR in free-ranging eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) and (ii) quantify the correlation between DEE and RMR before and after controlling for common sources of variation. We found that the influence of individual factors on DEE and RMR is most often shared, whereas the influence of environmental factors tends to be distinct. Both raw and mass-adjusted DEE and RMR were significantly correlated, but this correlation vanished after accounting for the shared effect of reproduction on both traits. However, within reproductive individuals, DEE and RMR remained positively correlated after accounting for all other significant covariates. The ratio of DEE to RMR was significantly higher during reproduction than at other times of the year and was negatively correlated with ambient temperature.

article,"Effects of organism and substrate size on burial mechanics of English sole, <i>Parophrys vetulus</i>","Corn, Katherine A. and Farina, Stacy C. and Summers, Adam P. and Gibb, Alice C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Flatfishes use cyclic body undulations to force water into the sediment and fluidize substrate particles, displacing them into the water column. When water velocity decreases, suspended particles settle back onto the fish, hiding it from view. Burial may become more challenging as flatfishes grow because the area to be covered increases exponentially with the second power of length. In addition, particle size is not uniform in naturally occurring substrates, and larger particles require higher water velocities for fluidization. We quantified the effects of organism and particle-size scaling on burial behavior of English sole, Parophrys vetulus. We recorded burial events from a size range of individuals (5-32 cm total length, TL), while maintaining constant substrate grain size. Larger fish used lower cycle frequencies and took longer to bury, but overall burial performance was maintained (similar to 100\% coverage). To test the effect of particle size on burial performance, individuals of similar lengths (5.7-8.1 cm TL) were presented with different substrate sizes (0.125-0.710 mm). Particle size did not affect cycle frequency or time to burial, but fish did not achieve 100\% coverage with the largest particles because they could not fluidize this substrate. Taken together, these results suggest that both body size and substrate grain size can potentially limit the ability of flatfishes to bury: a very large fish (>150 cm) may move too slowly to fluidize all but the smallest substrate particles and some particles are simply too large for smaller individuals to fluidize.",2018,10.1242/jeb.176131,221,18,NA,jeb176131,Flatfish; Fluidization; Scaling
article,High complexity of aquatic irradiance may have driven the evolution of four-dimensional colour vision in shallow-water fish,"Sabbah, Shai and Troje, Nikolaus F. and Gray, Suzanne M. and Hawryshyn, Craig W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Humans use three cone photoreceptor classes for colour vision, yet many birds, reptiles and shallow-water fish are tetrachromatic and use four cone classes. Screening pigments, which narrow the spectrum of photoreceptors in birds and diurnal reptiles, render visual systems with four cone classes more efficient. To date, however, the question of tetrachromacy in shallow-water fish that, like humans, lack screening pigments, is still unsolved. We raise the possibility that tetrachromacy in fish has evolved in response to higher spectral complexity of underwater light. We compared the dimensionality of colour vision in humans and fish by examining the spectral complexity of the colour signal reflected from objects into their eyes. We show that fish require four to six cone classes to reconstruct the colour signal of aquatic objects at the accuracy level achieved by humans viewing terrestrial objects. This is because environmental light, which alters the colour signals, is more complex and contains more spectral fluctuations underwater than on land. We further show that fish cones are better suited than human cones to detect these spectral fluctuations, suggesting that the capability of fish cones to detect high-frequency fluctuations in the colour signal confers an advantage. Taken together, we propose that tetrachromacy in fish has evolved to enhance the reconstruction of complex colour signals in shallow aquatic environments. Of course, shallow-water fish might possess fewer than four cone classes; however, this would come with the inevitable loss in accuracy of signal reconstruction.",2013,10.1242/jeb.079558,216,9,1670-1682,NA,vertebrates; sensory systems; spectral reflectance; cone photoreceptor; opsin gene; underwater environment; tetrachromacy

Poisonous eggs from Pomacea apple snails have defensive macromolecules for protection. Here we isolated and characterized a novel lectin called PdPV1 that is massively accumulated in the eggs of Pomacea diffusa and seems part of its protective cocktail. The native protein, an oligomer of ca 256 kDa, has high structural stability, withstanding 15 min boiling and denaturing by SDS. It resists in vitro proteinase digestion and displays structural stability between pH 2.0 and pH 12.0, and up to 85 degrees C. These properties, as well as its subunit sequences, glycosylation pattern, presence of carotenoids, size and global shape resemble those of its orthologs from other Pomacea. Furthermore, like members of the canaliculata clade, PdPV1 is recovered unchanged in feces of mice ingesting it, supporting an anti-nutritive defensive function. PdPV1 also displays a strong hemagglutinating activity, specifically recognizing selected ganglioside motifs with high affinity. This activity is only shared with PsSC, a perivitelline from the same clade (bridgesii clade). As a whole, these results indicate that species in the genus Pomacea have diversified their egg defenses: those from the bridgesii clade are protected mostly by non-digestible lectins that lower the nutritional value of eggs, in contrast with protection by neurotoxins of other Pomacea clades, indicating that apple snail egg defensive strategies are clade specific. The harsh gastrointestinal environment of predators would have favored their appearance, extending by convergent evolution the presence of plant-like highly stable lectins, a strategy not reported in other animals.",2020,10.1242/jeb.231878,223,19,NA,jeb231878,Ampullariidae; Egg defense; Gastropods; Glycan array; Lectin activity; Protein structure
article,Developmental variation in sound production in water and air in the blue catfish <i>Ictalurus furcatus</i>,"Ghahramani, Zachary N. and Mohajer, Yasha and Fine, Michael L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Blue catfish, Ictalurus furcatus, the largest catfish in North America, produce pectoral stridulation sounds (distress calls) when attacked and held. They have both fish and bird predators, and the frequency spectrum of their sounds is better matched to the hearing of birds than to that of unspecialized fish predators with low frequency hearing. It is unclear whether their sounds evolved to function in air or water. We categorized the calls and how they change with fish size in air and water and compared developmental changes in call parameters with stridulation motions captured with a high-speed camera. Stridulation sounds consist of a variable series of pulses produced during abduction of the pectoral spine. Pulses are caused by quick rapid spine rotations (jerks) of the pectoral spine that do not change with fish size although larger individuals generate longer, higher amplitude pulses with lower peak frequencies. There are longer pauses between jerks, and therefore fewer jerks and fewer pulses, in larger fish, which take longer to abduct their spines and therefore produce a longer series of pulses per abduction sweep. Sounds couple more effectively to water (1400 times greater pressure in Pascals at 1 m), are more sharply tuned and have lower peak frequencies than in air. Blue catfish stridulation sounds appear to be specialized to produce underwater signals although most of the sound spectrum includes frequencies matched to catfish hearing but largely above the hearing range of unspecialized fishes.",2014,10.1242/jeb.112946,217,23,4244-4251,NA,Acoustic communication; Bioacoustics; Distress sounds; Ictaluridae; Predator-prey; Pectoral spine; Anti-predator adaptation
article,Measuring gill paracellular permeability with polyethylene glycol-4000 in freely swimming trout: proof of principle,"Robertson, Lisa M. and Wood, Chris M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The influence of swimming activity on gill paracellular permeability has not been measured previously in fishes. We critically assessed the use of tritium-labeled polyethylene glycol ({[}H-3]PEG-4000) for this purpose, a substance that is also a classic marker for extracellular fluid volume, glomerular filtration rate and drinking rate. Tests (8 h) on resting freshwater trout showed that when measuring {[}H-3]PEG-4000 clearance from the plasma in the efflux direction, correction for a large excretion via glomerular filtration was essential, necessitating urinary catheterization. When measuring {[}H-3]PEG-4000 clearance from the water in the influx direction, correction for a significant uptake by drinking was essential, necessitating terminal gut removal, whereas glomerular filtration losses were minimal. After correction for these alternate routes of loss and uptake, {[}H-3]PEG-4000 clearance rates by efflux from the plasma and by influx from the water were identical, showing that gill paracellular permeability is not rectified, and can be measured in either direction. The influx technique with terminal gut removal was used to assess gill paracellular permeability in trout without urinary catheters freely swimming at 1.2 body lengths s(-1) for 8 h. Branchial {[}H-3]PEG-4000 clearance rate (by influx from the water) increased significantly by similar to 80\% in accord with a similar measured increase in O-2 consumption rate.

Given this evolutionary history of minimal gravitational loading of fishes in water, it has been hypothesized that weight-responsive musculoskeletal systems evolved during the tetrapod invasion of land and are thus absent in fishes. Amphibious fishes, however, experience increased effective weight when out of water - are these fishes responsive to gravitational loading? Contrary to the tetrapod-origin hypothesis, we found that terrestrial acclimation reversibly increased gill arch stiffness (similar to 60\% increase) in the amphibious fish Kryptolebias marmoratus when loaded normally by gravity, but not under simulated microgravity. Quantitative proteomics analysis revealed that this change in mechanical properties occurred via increased abundance of proteins responsible for bone mineralization in other fishes as well as in tetrapods. Type X collagen, associated with endochondral bone growth, increased in abundance almost ninefold after terrestrial acclimation. Collagen isoforms known to promote extracellular matrix cross-linking and cause tissue stiffening, such as types IX and XII collagen, also increased in abundance. Finally, more densely packed collagen fibrils in both gill arches and filaments were observed microscopically in terrestrially acclimated fish. Our results demonstrate that the mechanical properties of the fish musculoskeletal system can be fine-tuned in response to changes in effective body weight using biochemical pathways similar to those in mammals, suggesting that weight sensing is an ancestral vertebrate trait rather than a tetrapod innovation.",2017,10.1242/jeb.161638,220,20,3621-3631,NA,Body support; Biomechanics; Microgravity; Collagen remodelling; Phenotypic plasticity

Three female walruses (670-1025 kg) voluntarily participated in spirometry trials while spontaneously breathing on land (sitting and lying down in sternal recumbency) and floating in water. While sitting, two walruses performed active respiratory efforts, and one animal participated in lung compliance measurements. For spontaneous breaths, V was lower when walruses were lying down (e.g. expiration: 7.1 +/- 1.2 l s(-1)) as compared with in water (9.9 +/- 1.4 l s(-1)), while tidal volume (V-T, 11.5 +/- 4.6I), breath duration (4.6 +/- 1.4 l s(-1)) and respiratory frequency (7.6 +/- 2.2 breaths min') remained the same. The measured VT and specific dynamic lung compliance (0.32 +/- 0.07 cmH(2)O(-1) ) for spontaneous breaths were higher than those estimated for similarly sized terrestrial mammals. V-T increased with body mass (allometric mass-exponent=1.29) and ranged from 3\% to 43\% of the estimated total lung capacity (TLCest) for spontaneous breaths. When normalized for TLCest, the maximal expiratory V (V-exp) was higher than that estimated in phocids, but lower than that reported in cetaceans and the California sea lion. V-exp, was maintained over all lung volumes during spontaneous and active respiratory manoeuvres.

article,Active touch in sea otters: in-air and underwater texture discrimination thresholds and behavioral strategies for paws and vibrissae,"Strobel, Sarah McKay and Sills, Jillian M. and Tinker, M. Tim and Reichmuth, Colleen J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Sea otters (Enhydra lutris) are marine predators that forage on a wide array of cryptic, benthic invertebrates. Observational studies and anatomical investigations of the sea otter somatosensory cortex suggest that touch is an important sense for detecting and capturing prey. Sea otters have two well-developed tactile structures: front paws and facial vibrissae. In this study, we use a two-alternative forced choice paradigm to investigate tactile sensitivity of a sea otter subject's paws and vibrissae, both in air and under water. We corroborate these measurements by testing human subjects with the same experimental paradigm. The sea otter showed good sensitivity with both tactile structures, but better paw sensitivity (Weber fraction, c=0.14) than vibrissal sensitivity (c=0.24). The sea otter's sensitivity was similar in air and under water for paw ( c(air) = 0.12, c(water) =0.15) and for vibrissae (c(air )= 0.24, c(water)=0.25). Relative to the human subjects we tested, the sea otter achieved similar sensitivity when using her paw and responded approximately 30-fold faster regardless of difficulty level. Relative to non-human mammalian tactile specialists, the sea otter achieved similar or better sensitivity when using either her paw or vibrissae and responded 1.5- to 15-fold faster near threshold. Our findings suggest that sea otters have sensitive, rapid tactile processing capabilities.

article,"Does aquatic performance predict terrestrial performance: a case study with an aquatic frog, <i>Xenopus laevis</i>","Araspin, Laurie and Measey, John and Herrel, Anthony",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The physical properties of the environment impose strong selection on organisms and their form-function relationships. In water and on land, selective pressures differ, with water being more viscous and denser than air, and gravity being the most important external force on land for relatively large animals such as vertebrates. These different properties of the environment could drive variation in the design and mechanics of the locomotor system of organisms. Animals that use multiple environments can consequently exhibit locomotion conflicts between the demands imposed by the media, leading to potential trade-offs. Here, we tested for the presence of such locomotor trade-offs depending on the environment (water or land) in a largely aquatic frog, Xenopus laevis. We focused on terrestrial and aquatic exertion capacity (time and distance swum or jumped until exhaustion) and aquatic and terrestrial burst capacity (maximal instantaneous swimming velocity and maximal force jump) given the ecological relevance of these traits. We tested these performance traits for trade-offs, depending on environments (water versus air) and locomotor modes (i.e. exertion and burst performance). Finally, we assessed the contribution of morphological traits to each performance trait. Our data show no trade-offs between the performance traits and between the environments, suggesting that X. laevis is equally good at swimming and jumping thanks to the same underlying morphological specialisations. We did observe, however, that morphological predictors differed depending on the environment, with variation in head shape and forelimb length being good predictors for aquatic locomotion and variation in hindlimb and forelimb segments predicting variation in jumping performance on land.",2023,10.1242/JEB.246545,226,24,NA,jeb246545,Locomotion; Morphology; Xenopus laevis; Exertion; Burst performance; Physical environment
article,Drink safely: common swifts<i> (Apus</i><i> apus)</i> dissipate mechanical energy to decrease flight speed before touch-and-go drinking,"Ruaux, Geoffrey and Monmasson, Kyra and Hedrick, Tyson L. and Lumineau, Sophie and de Margerie, Emmanuel",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Flight is an efficient way of transport over a unit of distance, but it can be very costly over each unit of time, and reducing flight energy expenditure is a major selective pressure in birds. The common swift (Apus apus) is one of the most aerial bird species, performing most behaviours in flight: foraging, sleeping and also drinking by regularly descending to various waterbodies and skimming over the surface. An energy-saving way to perform such touch-and-go drinking would be to strive to conserve mechanical energy, by transforming potential energy to kinetic energy during the gliding descent, touching water at high speed, and regaining height with minimal muscular work. Using 3D optical tracking, we recorded 163 swift drinking trajectories, over three waterbodies near Rennes, France. Contrary to the energy conservation hypothesis, we show that swifts approaching a waterbody with a higher mechanical energy (higher height and/or speed 5 s before contact) do not reach the water at higher speeds, but do brake, i.e. dissipate mechanical energy to lose both height and speed. Braking seems to be linked with sharp turns and the use of headwind to some extent, but finer turns and postural adjustments, beyond the resolving power of our tracking data, could also be involved. We hypothesize that this surprisingly costly behaviour results from a trade-off between energy expenditure and safety, because approaching a water surface requires fine motor control, and high speed increases the risk of falling into the water, which would have serious energetic and survival costs for a swift.",2023,10.1242/jeb.244961,226,6,NA,jeb244961,Air-brake; Wind; Kinematics
article,How temperature influences the viscosity of hornworm hemolymph,"Kenny, Melissa C. and Giarra, Matthew N. and Granata, Ellen and Socha, John J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Hemolymph is responsible for the transport of nutrients and metabolic waste within the insect circulatory system. Circulation of hemolymph is governed by viscosity, a physical property, which is well known to be influenced by temperature. However, the effect of temperature on hemolymph viscosity is unknown. We used Manduca sexta larvae to measure hemolymph viscosity across a range of physiologically relevant temperatures. Measurements were taken from 0 to 45 degrees C using a cone and plate viscometer in a sealed environmental chamber. Hemolymph viscosity decreased with increasing temperature, showing a 6.4-fold change (11.08 to 1.74 cP) across the temperature range. Viscosity values exhibited two behaviors. changing rapidly from 0 to 15 degrees C and slowly from 17.5 to 45 degrees C. To test the effects of large particulates (e.g. cells) on viscosity, we also tested hemolymph plasma alone. Plasma viscosity also decreased as temperature increased, but did not exhibit two slope regimes. suggesting that particulates strongly influence low-temperature shifts in viscosity values. These results suggest that as environmental temperatures decrease, insects experience dramatic changes in hemolymph viscosity, leading to altered circulatory flows or increased energetic input to maintain similar flows. Such physical effects represent a previously unrecognized factor in the thermal biology of insects.",2018,10.1242/jeb.186338,221,21,NA,jeb186338,Manduca sexta; Thermal biology; Plasma; Density; Insects
article,The implications of reduced metabolic rate in resource-limited corals,"Jacobson, Lianne M. and Edmunds, Peter J. and Muller, Erik B. and Nisbet, Roger M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Many organisms exhibit depressed metabolism when resources are limited, a change that makes it possible to balance an energy budget. For symbiotic reef corals, daily cycles of light and periods of intense cloud cover can be chronic causes of food limitation through reduced photosynthesis. Furthermore, coral bleaching is common in present-day reefs, creating a context in which metabolic depression could have beneficial value to corals. In the present study, corals (massive Porites spp.) were exposed to an extreme case of resource limitation by starving them of food and light for 20 days. When resources were limited, the corals depressed area-normalized respiration to 37\% of initial rates, and coral biomass declined to 64\% of initial amounts, yet the corals continued to produce skeletal mass. However, the declines in biomass cannot account for the declines in area-normalized respiration, as mass-specific respiration declined to 30\% of the first recorded time point. Thus, these corals appear to be capable of metabolic depression. It is possible that some coral species are better able to depress metabolic rates than others; such variation could explain differential survival during conditions that limit resources (e.g. shading). Furthermore, we found that maintenance of existing biomass, in part, supports the production of skeletal mass. This association could be explained if maintenance supplies needed energy (e.g. ATP) or inorganic carbon (i.e. CO2) that otherwise limits the production of skeletal mass. Finally, the observed metabolic depression can be explained as a change in pool sizes, and does not require a change in metabolic rules.",2016,10.1242/jeb.136044,219,6,870-877,NA,Scleractinia; Respiration; Porites spp.; Resource limitation; Starvation; Metabolic depression
article,Structure of the thoracic spiracular valves and their contribution to unidirectional gas exchange in flying blowflies <i>Calliphora vicina</i>,"Wasserthal, Lutz T. and Froehlich, Anja S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The operation of the thoracic spiracular valves was analysed using anatomical and physiological techniques. Dense spiracular filter trichomes impede a diffusive gas exchange. However, the hinged posterior filter flap of the metathoracic spiracle (Sp2) opens passively during upstroke of the wings and closes by the suction of the sub-atmospheric tracheal pressure during the downstroke, which supports a unidirectional respiratory airflow. The action of the interior spiracular valve lids was recorded by photocell sensors oriented above the enlarged spiracles and projected onto the screen of a video camera. The thoracic spiracles opened much quicker (approximately 0.1 s) than they closed (1 s), suggesting that the spiracular muscles are openers, as confirmed by experimental induction of muscle contraction. Simultaneous photocell measurement revealed that the first and second thoracic spiracles act concordantly. At rest, the spiracles were mostly closed or only slightly open (< 1\%). During intermittent short flights, the valves opened wide at the start of the flight for a short time, and in many cases opened again after the flight ended. Often, the opening was wider after the flight ended than during the flight itself. During long spontaneous continuous flight phases (up to 2 h), the valves were only slightly open (<5\%), widening shortly after transient increases of wing stroke intensity. It is an amazing paradox that the spiracles were only slightly open when the requirement for O-2 was high during sustained flight. The advantage of generating sub-atmospheric pressure, supporting a unidirectional airflow with a PO2 increase above the resting level, is discussed.",2017,10.1242/jeb.149013,220,2,208-219,NA,Auto-ventilation; Insect respiration; Tracheal pressure; Tracheae; Spiracles; Haemolymph; Opener muscle; Oxygen supply; CO2 release

Caenorhabditis japonica establishes a species-specific phoresy with Parastrachia japonensis. Dauer larvae (DL), the non-feeding and phoretic stage of C. japonica, are predominantly found on female phoretic hosts, but the mechanisms underlying the establishment of this phoresy remain unknown. To determine whether C. japonica DL are able to recognize and orient themselves to a host using a volatile cue from the host, we developed a Y-tube olfactory assay system in which C. japonica DL were significantly attracted to the air from P. japonensis but not to the air from three other insects or to CO2. These results demonstrated that C. japonica DL utilize volatiles for host recognition and orientation and that the presence of a specific volatile kairomone released by the host attracts C. japonica DL.",2014,10.1242/jeb.105353,217,18,3197-3199,NA,Dauer; Kairomone; Nictation; Olfactometer; Navigation
article,"Predator-driven intra-species variation in locomotion, metabolism and water velocity preference in pale chub (<i>Zacco platypus</i>) along a river","Fu, Cheng and Fu, Shi-Jian and Yuan, Xin-Zhong and Cao, Zhen-Dong",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Fish inhabit environments that vary greatly in terms of predation intensity, and these predation regimes are generally expected to be a major driver of divergent natural selection. To test whether there is predator-driven intra-species variation in the locomotion, metabolism and water velocity preference of pale chub (Zacco platypus) along a river, we measured unsteady and steady swimming and water velocity preference among fish collected from both high- and low-predation habitats in the Wujiang River. We also measured the routine metabolic rate (RMR), maximum metabolic rate (MMR) and cost of transport (COT) and calculated the optimal swimming speed (U-opt). The fish from the high-predation populations showed a shorter response latency, elevated routine metabolism, lower swimming efficiency at low swimming speed and lower water velocity preference compared with those from the low-predation populations. Neither of the kinematic parameters fast-start and critical swimming speed (U-crit) showed a significant difference between the high- and low-predation populations. The fish from the high-predation populations may improve their predator avoidance capacity primarily through an elevated routine metabolism and shorter response latency to achieve advanced warning and escape, rather than an improved fast-start swimming speed or acceleration. Thus, the cost of this strategy is an elevated RMR, and no trade-off between unsteady and steady swimming performance was observed in the pale chub population under various predation stresses. It was interesting to find that the high- predation fish showed an unexpected lower velocity preference, which might represent a compromise between predation avoidance, foraging and energy saving.",2015,10.1242/jeb.109561,218,2,255-264,NA,Critical swimming speed; Divergent natural selection; Fast-start escape response; Predation stress; Steady and unsteady swimming performance; Swimming efficiency

Many semi-aquatic invertebrates and plants have developed complex surface microstructures with water-repellent properties to overcome these problems, but equivalent adaptations of the skin have not been reported for vertebrates that encounter similar environmental challenges. Here, we document the first evidence of evolutionary convergence of hydrophobic structured skin in a group of semi-aquatic tetrapods. We show that the skin surface of semi-aquatic species of Anolis lizards is characterized by a more elaborate microstructural architecture (i.e. longer spines and spinules) and a lower wettability relative to closely related terrestrial species. In addition, phylogenetic comparative models reveal repeated independent evolution of enhanced skin hydrophobicity associated with the transition to a semi-aquatic lifestyle, providing evidence of adaptation. Our findings invite a new and exciting line of inquiry into the ecological significance, evolutionary origin and developmental basis of hydrophobic skin surfaces in semi-aquatic lizards, which is essential for understanding why and how the observed skin adaptations evolved in some and not other semi-aquatic tetrapod lineages.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242939,224,19,NA,jeb242939,Anolis; Functional surfaces; Non-wettability; Squamate integument

We examined the influences of flow and predator attack direction on the escape behavior of fish, using juveniles of the amphidromous Hawaiian goby Sicyopterus stimpsoni. In nature, these fish must escape ambush predation while moving through streams with high-velocity flow. We measured the escape performance of juvenile gobies while exposing them to a range of water velocities encountered in natural streams and stimulating fish from three different directions. Frequency of response across treatments indicated strong effects of flow conditions and attack direction. Juvenile S. stimpsoni had uniformly high response rates for attacks from a caudal direction (opposite flow); however, response rates for attacks from a cranial direction (matching flow) decreased dramatically as flow speed increased. Mechanical stimuli produced by predators attacking in the same direction as flow might be masked by the flow environment, impairing the ability of prey to detect attacks. Thus, the likelihood of successful escape performance in fishes can depend critically on environmental context.",2016,10.1242/jeb.137554,219,19,3100-3105,NA,Biomechanics; Locomotion; Hydrodynamics; Fineness ratio; Acceleration; Predator-prey interactions

However, hardly anything is known of the actual nature of these channels in crustaceans. In the present study, the identification of a hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated potassium channel (HCN) in the transcriptome of the green crab Carcinus maenas and subsequent performance of quantitative real-time PCR revealed the ubiquitous expression of this channel in this species. Even though mRNA expression levels in the cerebral ganglion were found to be approximately 10 times higher compared with all other tissues, posterior gills still expressed significant levels of HCN, indicating an important role for this transporter in branchial ion regulation. The relatively unspecific K+-channel inhibitor Ba2+, as well as the HCN-specific blocker ZD7288, as applied in gill perfusion experiments and electrophysiological studies employing the split gill lamellae revealed the presence of at least two different K+/NH4+-transporting structures in the branchial epithelium of C. maenas. Furthermore, HCN mRNA levels in posterior gill 7 decreased significantly in response to the respiratory or metabolic acidosis that was induced by acclimation of green crabs to high environmental P-CO2 and ammonia, respectively. Consequently, the present study provides first evidence that HCN-promoted NH4+ epithelial transport is involved in both branchial acid-base and ammonia regulation in an invertebrate.",2016,10.1242/jeb.134502,219,6,887-896,NA,Ammonia; Gill perfusion; HCN; Hypercapnia; HEA
article,Energetics and behavior of coral reef fishes during oscillatory swimming in a simulated wave surge,"Marcoux, Travis M. and Korsmeyer, Keith E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Oxygen consumption rates were measured for coral reef fishes during swimming in a bidirectional, oscillatory pattern to simulate station-holding in wave-induced, shallow-water flows. For all species examined, increases in wave intensity, as simulated by increases in frequency and amplitude of oscillation, yielded increased metabolic rates and net costs of swimming (NCOS; swimming metabolic rate minus standard metabolic rate). Comparing species with different swimming modes, the caudal fin swimming Kuhlia spp. (Kuhliidae) and simultaneous pectoral-caudal fin swimming Amphiprion ocellaris (Pomacentridae) tumed around to face the direction of swimming most of the time, whereas the median-paired fin (MPF) swimmers, the pectoral fin swimming Ctenochaetus strigosus (Acanthuridae) and dorsal-anal fin swimming Sufflamen bursa (Balistidae), more frequently swam in reverse for one half of the oscillation to avoid turning. Contrary to expectations, the body-caudal fin (BCF) swimming Kuhlia spp. had the lowest overall NCOS in the oscillatory swimming regime compared with the MPF swimmers. However, when examining the effect of increasing frequency of oscillation at similar average velocities, Kuhlia spp. showed a 24\% increase in NCOS with a 50\% increase in direction changes and accelerations. The two strict MPF swimmers had lower increases on average, suggestive of reduced added costs with increasing frequency of direction changes with this swimming mode. Further studies are needed on the costs of unsteady swimming to determine whether these differences can explain the observed prevalence of fishes using the MPF pectoral fin swimming mode in reef habitats exposed to high, wave-surge-induced water flows.",2019,10.1242/jeb.191791,222,4,NA,jeb191791,Respirometry; Unsteady swimming; Balistiform; Labriform; Wave stress

Most notably, they reverse normal net ion-absorbing mechanisms that are vital to water absorption, an important process for seawater teleost survival. The role of guanylin-peptide stimulation of the intestine remains unclear, but it is hypothesized to facilitate the removal of solids from the intestine by providing fluid to enable their removal by peristalsis. The present study used one member of this group of peptides - RGN - to provide evidence for the prominent role that protein kinase A (PKA) plays in mediating the effects of guanylin-peptide stimulation in the posterior intestine of the Gulf toadfish (Opsanus beta). Protein kinase G was found to not mediate the intracellular effects of RGN, despite previous evidence showing that GC-C activation leads to higher cyclic guanosine monophosphate formation. RGN reversed the absorptive short-circuit current and increased conductance in the Gulf toadfish intestine. These effects are correlated to increased trafficking of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl-channel to the apical membrane, which is negated by PKA inhibition. Moreover, RGN decreased HCO3- secretion, likely by limiting apical HCO3-/Cl- exchange (possibly by reducing SLC26a6 activity), a reduction that was enhanced by PKA inhibition. RGN seems to alter PKA activity in the posterior intestine to recruit CFTR to the apical membrane and reduce HCO3- secretion.",2018,10.1242/jeb.173948,221,6,NA,jeb173948,PKG; Cl- secretion; Guanylin peptides; Intestine; Seawater teleost

The H+/K+-ATPase (HKA), which is composed of the HK alpha 1 (gene: atp4a) and HK beta (gene: atp4b) subunits, has an established role in potassium and acid-base regulation in mammals and is well known for its role in gastric acidification. However, the role of HKA in extra-gastric organs such as the gill and kidney is less clear, especially in fishes. In the present study in Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, uptake of the K. surrogate flux marker rubidium (Rb+) was demonstrated in vivo; however, this uptake was not inhibited with omeprazole, a potent inhibitor of the gastric HKA. This contrasts with gill and kidney ex vivo preparations, where tissue Rb+ uptake was significantly inhibited by omeprazole and SCH28080, another gastric HKA inhibitor. The cellular localization of this pump in both the gill and kidney was demonstrated using immunohistochemical techniques with custom-made antioodies specific for Atp4a and Atp4b. Antibodies against the two subunits showed the same apical ionocyte distribution pattern in the gill and collecting tubules/ducts in the kidney. Atp4a antibody specificity was confirmed by western blotting. RT-PCT was used to confirm the expression of both subunits in the gill and kidney. Taken together, these results indicate for the first time K+ (Rb+) uptake in O. niloticus and that HKA is implicated, as shown through the ex vivo uptake inhibition by omeprazole and SCH28080, verifying a role for HKA in K+ absorption in the gill's ionocytes and collecting tubule/duct segments of the kidney.",2020,10.1242/jeb.214890,223,16,NA,jeb214890,Potassium regulation; Fresh water; Acid-base regulation
article,"Sensitivity of ventilation and brain metabolism to ammonia exposure in rainbow trout, <i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>","Zhang, Li and Nawata, C. Michele and Wood, Chris M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Ammonia has been documented as a respiratory gas that stimulates ventilation, and is sensed by peripheral neuroepithelial cells (NECs) in the gills in ammoniotelic rainbow trout. However, the hyperventilatory response is abolished in trout chronically exposed (1+ months) to high environmental ammonia {[}HEA; 250 mu mol l(-1) (NH4)(2)SO4]. This study investigates whether the brain is involved in the acute sensitivity of ventilation to ammonia, and whether changes in brain metabolism are related to the loss of hyperventilatory responses in trout chronically exposed to HEA ('HEA trout'). Hyperventilation (via increased ventilatory amplitude rather than rate) and increased total ammonia concentration ({[}T-Amm]) in brain tissue were induced in parallel by acute HEA exposure in control trout in a concentration-series experiment [}500, 750 and 1000 mu mol l(-1) (NH4)(2)SO4], but these inductions were abolished in HEA trout. Ventilation was correlated more closely to [}T-Amm] in brain rather than to {[}T-Amm] in plasma or cerebrospinal fluid. The close correlation of hyperventilation and increased brain [}T-Amm] also occurred in control trout acutely exposed to HEA in a time-series analysis {[}500 mu mol l(-1) (NH4)(2)SO4; 15, 30, 45 and 60 min], as well as in a methionine sulfoxamine (MSOX) pre-injection experiment {[}to inhibit glutamine synthetase (GSase)]. These correlations consistently suggest that brain {[}T-Amm] is involved in the hyperventilatory responses to ammonia in trout. The MSOX treatments, together with measurements of GSase activity, T-Amm, glutamine and glutamate concentrations in brain tissue, were conducted in both the control and HEA trout. These experiments revealed that GSase plays an important role in transferring ammonia to glutamate to make glutamine in trout brain, thereby attenuating the elevation of brain {[}T-Amm] following HEA exposure, and that glutamate concentration is reduced in HEA trout. The mRNAs for the ammonia channel proteins Rhbg, Rhcg1 and Rhcg2 were expressed in trout brain, and the expression of Rhbg and Rhcg2 increased in HEA trout, potentially as a mechanism to facilitate the efflux of ammonia. In summary, the brain appears to be involved in the sensitivity of ventilation to ammonia, and brain ammonia levels are regulated metabolically in trout.",2013,10.1242/jeb.087692,216,21,4025-4037,NA,Rh protein; ammonia; brain; fish; glutamine synthetase; ventilation
article,The hydrodynamics of swimming at intermediate Reynolds numbers in the water boatman (<i>Corixidae</i>),"Ngo, Victoria and McHenry, Matthew James",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The fluid forces that govern propulsion determine the speed and energetic cost of swimming. These hydrodynamics are scale dependent and it is unclear what forces matter to the tremendous diversity of aquatic animals that are between a millimeter and a centimeter in length. Animals at this scale generally operate within the regime of intermediate Reynolds numbers, where both viscous and inertial fluid forces have the potential to play a role in propulsion. The present study aimed to resolve which forces create thrust and drag in the paddling of the water boatman (Corixidae), an animal that spans much of the intermediate regime (10<Re<200). By measuring the force generated by tethered water boatmen, we found that thrust is generated primarily by drag on the paddling appendages, with a negligible contribution from the acceleration reaction force. Based on these findings, we developed a forward-dynamic model of propulsion in free swimming that accurately predicted changes in the body's center of mass over time. For both tethered and free swimming, we used non-linear optimization algorithms to determine the force coefficients that best matched our measurements. With this approach, the drag coefficients on the body and paddle were found to be up to three times greater than on static structures in fully developed flow at the same Reynolds numbers. This is likely a partial consequence of unsteady interactions between the paddles or between the paddles and the body. In addition, the maximum values for these coefficients were inversely related to the Reynolds number, which suggests that viscous forces additionally play an important role in the hydrodynamics of small water boatmen. This understanding for the major forces that operate at intermediate Reynolds numbers offers a basis for interpreting the mechanics, energetics and functional morphology of swimming in many small aquatic animals.",2014,10.1242/jeb.103895,217,15,2740-2751,NA,Modeling; Acceleration reaction; Thrust; Drag; Propulsion
article,Wind induces variations in spider web geometry and sticky spiral droplet volume,"Wu, Chao-Chia and Blamires, Sean J. and Wu, Chung-Lin and Tso, I-Min",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Trap building by animals is rare because it comes at a substantial cost. Using materials with properties that vary across environments maintains trap functionality. The sticky spiral silks of spider orb webs are used to catch flying prey. Web geometry, accompanied by compensatory changes in silk properties, may change across environments to sustain web functionality. We exposed the spider Cyclosa mulmeinensis to wind to test whether wind-induced changes in web geometry are accompanied by changes in aggregate silk droplet morphology, axial thread width or spiral stickiness. We compared: (i) web catching area, (ii) length of total silks, (iii) mesh height, (iv) number of radii, (v) aggregate droplet morphology and (vi) spiral thread stickiness, between webs made by spiders exposed to wind and those made by spiders not exposed to wind. We interpreted co-variation in droplet morphology or spiral stickiness with web capture area, mesh height or spiral length as the silk properties functionally compensating for changes in web geometry to reduce wind drag. Wind-exposed C. mulmeinensis built webs with smaller capture areas, shorter capture spiral lengths and more widely spaced capture spirals, resulting in the expenditure of less silk. Individuals that were exposed to wind also deposited larger droplets of sticky silk but the stickiness of the spiral threads remained unchanged. The larger droplets may be a product of a greater investment in water, or low molecular weight compounds facilitating atmospheric water uptake. Either way, droplet dehydration in wind is likely to be minimized.",2013,10.1242/jeb.083618,216,17,3342-3349,NA,environmental stress; spiral silk properties; orb webs; Cyclosa mulmeinensis

We examined how cyclic changes in water flow velocity affect the swimming performance and energetics of a labriform swimmer, the shiner surfperch, Cymatogaster aggregata, during station holding. Using intermittent-flow respirometry, we measured critical swimming speed (U-crit), oxygen consumption rates (MO2) and pectoral fin use in steady flow versus unsteady flows with either low-{[}0.5 body lengths (BL) s(-1)] or high-amplitude (1.0 BL s(-1)) velocity fluctuations, with a 5 s period. Individuals in low-amplitude unsteady flow performed as well as fish in steady flow. However, swimming costs in high-amplitude unsteady flow were on average 25.3\% higher than in steady flow and 14.2\% higher than estimated values obtained from simulations based on the non-linear relationship between swimming speed and oxygen consumption rate in steady flow. Time-averaged pectoral fin use (fin-beat frequency measured over 300 s) was similar among treatments. However, measures of instantaneous fin use (fin-beat period) and body movement in high-amplitude unsteady flow indicate that individuals with greater variation in the duration of their fin beats were better at holding station and consumed less oxygen than fish with low variation in fin-beat period. These results suggest that the costs of swimming in unsteady flows are context dependent in labriform swimmers, and may be influenced by individual differences in the ability of fishes to adjust their fin beats to the flow environment.",2014,10.1242/jeb.085811,217,3,414-422,NA,Complex flow; Critical swimming speed; Fin-beat frequency; Pectoral fin swimming; Oxygen consumption rate; Respirometry

Although these roundworms have been used for decades as genetic model systems, very little is known about their strategy to eliminate the toxic waste product ammonia from their bodies into the environment. The current study provides evidence that ammonia is at least partially excreted via the hypodermis. Starvation reduced the ammonia excretion rates by more than half, whereas mRNA expression levels of the Rhesus protein CeRhr-2, V-type H+-ATPase (subunit A) and Na+/K+-ATPase (a-subunit) decreased correspondingly. Moreover, ammonia excretion rates were enhanced in media buffered to pH 5 and decreased at pH 9.5. Inhibitor experiments, combined with enzyme activity measurements and mRNA expression analyses, further suggested that the excretion mechanism involves the participation of the V-type H+-ATPase, carbonic anhydrase, Na+/K+-ATPase, and a functional microtubule network. These findings indicate that ammonia is excreted, not only by apical ammonia trapping, but also via vesicular transport and exocytosis. Exposure to 1 mmol l(-1) NH4Cl caused a 10-fold increase in body ammonia and a tripling of ammonia excretion rates. Gene expression levels of CeRhr-1 and CeRhr-2, V-ATPase and Na+/K+-ATPase also increased significantly in response to 1 mmol l-1 NH4Cl. Importantly, a functional expression analysis showed, for the first time, ammonia transport capabilities for CeRhr-1 in a phylogenetically ancient invertebrate system, identifying these proteins as potential functional precursors to the vertebrate ammonia-transporting Rh-glycoproteins.",2015,10.1242/jeb.111856,218,5,675-683,NA,Vesicular transport; Na+/K+-ATPase; V-ATPase; Carbonic anhydrase
article,Functional diversity of the lateral line system among populations of a native Australian freshwater fish,"Spiller, Lindsey and Grierson, Pauline F. and Davies, Peter M. and Hemmi, Jan and Collin, Shaun P. and Kelley, Jennifer L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Fishes use their mechanoreceptive lateral line system to sense nearby objects by detecting slight fluctuations in hydrodynamic motion within their immediate environment. Species of fish from different habitats often display specialisations of the lateral line system, in particular the distribution and abundance of neuromasts, but the lateral line can also exhibit considerable diversity within a species. Here, we provide the first investigation of the lateral line system of the Australian western rainbowfish (Melanotaenia australis), a species that occupies a diversity of freshwater habitats across semi-arid northwest Australia. We collected 155 individuals from eight populations and surveyed each habitat for environmental factors that may contribute to lateral line specialisation, including water flow, predation risk, habitat structure and prey availability. Scanning electron microscopy and fluorescent dye labelling were used to describe the lateral line system in M. australis, and to examine whether the abundance and arrangement of superficial neuromasts (SNs) varied within and among populations. We found that the SNs of M. australis were present in distinct body regions rather than lines. The abundance of SNs within each body region was highly variable, and also differed among populations and individuals. Variation in SN abundance among populations was best explained by habitat structure and the availability of invertebrate prey. Our finding that specific environmental factors explain among-population variation in a key sensory system suggests that the ability to acquire sensory information is specialised for the particular behavioural needs of the animal.",2017,10.1242/jeb.151530,220,12,2265-2276,NA,Population variation; Altered flow regimes; Sensory evolution; Adaptation
article,Specific dynamic action: the energy cost of digestion or growth?,"Goodrich, Harriet R. and Wood, Chris M. and Wilson, Rod W. and Clark, Timothy D. and Last, Katja B. and Wang, Tobias",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The physiological processes underlying the post-prandial rise in metabolic rate, most commonly known as the `specific dynamic action' (SDA), remain debated and controversial. This Commentary examines the SDA response from two opposing hypotheses: (i) the classic interpretation, where the SDA represents the energy cost of digestion, versus (ii) the alternative view that much of the SDA represents the energy cost of growth. The traditional viewpoint implies that individuals with a reduced SDA should grow faster given the same caloric intake, but experimental evidence for this effect remains scarce and inconclusive. Alternatively, we suggest that the SDA reflects an organism's efficacy in allocating the ingested food to growth, emphasising the role of post-absorptive processes, particularly protein synthesis. Although both viewpoints recognise the trade-offs in energy allocation and the dynamic nature of energy distribution among physiological processes, we argue that equating the SDA with `the energy cost of digestion' oversimplifies the complexities of energy use in relation to the SDA and growth. In many instances, a reduced SDA may reflect diminished nutrient absorption (e.g. due to lower digestive efficiency) rather than increased `free' energy available for somatic growth. Considering these perspectives, we summarise evidence both for and against the opposing hypotheses with a focus on ectothermic vertebrates. We conclude by presenting a number of future directions for experiments",2024,10.1242/jeb.246722,227,7,NA,jeb246722,Postprandial metabolism; Energy allocation; Protein; synthesis; Metabolism
article,Crying a river: how much salt-laden jelly can a leatherback turtle really eat?,"Davenport, John",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) are capital breeders that accumulate blubber (33 kJ g(-1) wet mass) by hyperphagia on a gelatinous diet at high latitudes; they breed in the tropics. A jellyfish diet is energy poor (0.1-0.2 kJ g(-1) wet mass) so leatherbacks must ingest large quantities. Two published estimates of feeding rate {[}50\% body mass day(-1) (on Rhizostoma pulmo) and 73\% body mass day(-1) (on Cyanea capillata)] have been criticised as too high. Jellyfish have high salt and water contents that must be removed to access organic material and energy. Most salt is removed (as NaCl) by paired lachrymal salt glands. Divalent ions are lost via the gut. In this study, the size of adult salt glands (0.622 kg for a 450 kg turtle; relatively three times the size of salt glands in cheloniid turtles) was measured for the first time by computed tomography scanning. Various published values for leatherback field metabolic rate, body fluid composition and likely blubber accumulation rates are combined with known jellyfish salt, water and organic compositions to calculate feasible salt gland secretion rates and feeding rates. The results indicate that leatherbacks can produce about 10-15 ml secretion g(-1) salt gland mass h(-1) (tear osmolality 1800 mOsm kg(-1)). This will permit consumption of 80\% body mass day(-1) of C. capillata. Calculations suggest that leatherbacks will find it difficult/impossible to accumulate sufficient blubber for reproduction in a single feeding season.

These body components must regenerate their morphology and functionality quickly while subjected to different environmental stressors. Sea urchins live in high-energy environments where hydrodynamic conditions pose significant challenges. Adhesive tube feet provide secure attachment to the substratum but can be amputated by predation and hydrodynamic forces. Tube feet display functional and morphological plasticity in response to environmental conditions, but regeneration to their pre-amputation status has not been achieved under quiescent laboratory settings. In this study, we assessed the effect of turbulent water movement, periodic emersion and quiescent conditions on the regeneration process of tube foot morphology (length, disc area) and functionality (maximum disc tenacity, stem breaking force). Disc area showed significant plasticity in response to the treatments; when exposed to emersion and turbulent water movement, disc area was larger than that of tube feet regenerated in quiescent conditions. However, no treatment stimulated regeneration to pre-amputation sizes. Tube foot length was unaffected by treatments and remained shorter than non-amputated tube feet. Stem breaking force for amputated and non-amputated treatments increased in all cases when compared with pre-amputation values. Maximum tenacity (force per unit area) was similar among tube feet subjected to simulated field conditions and amputation treatments. Our results suggest a role of active plasticity of tube foot functional morphology in response to field-like conditions and demonstrate the plastic response of invertebrates to laboratory conditions.",2022,10.1242/jeb.242848,225,3,NA,jeb242848,Strongylocentrotus purpuratus; Reaction norm; Echinoderm adhesion; Tensile breaking force; Tenacity

Field studies on aquatic mammals and birds have shown that the intensity of bradycardia can vary depending on diving behaviour, such as the depth of dives and dive duration. However, in aquatic reptiles, the variation in heart rate during deep dives under natural conditions has not been fully investigated. In this study, we released five loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) outfitted with recorders into the sea and recorded their electrocardiogram, depth, water temperature and longitudinal acceleration. After 3 days, the recorders automatically detached from the turtles. The heart rate signals were detected from the electrodes placed on the surface of the plastron. The mean (+/- s.d.) heart rate of 12.8 +/- 4.1 beats min-1 during dives was significantly lower than that of 20.9 +/- 4.1 beats min-1 during surface periods. Heart rate during dives varied with dive depth, although it remained lower than that at the surface. When the turtle dived deeper than 140 m, despite the relatively high flipper stroke rate (approximately 19 strokes min-1), the heart rate dropped rapidly to approximately 2 beats min-1 temporarily. The minimum instantaneous heart rate during dives was lower at deeper dive depths. Our results indicate that loggerhead sea turtles show variations in the intensity of diving bradycardia depending on their diving behaviour, similar to that shown by marine mammals and birds.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246334,227,5,NA,jeb246334,Diving physiology; Diving bradycardia; Electrocardiogram; Caretta caretta; Free-ranging
article,"Passive regeneration of glutathione: glutathione reductase regulation in the freeze-tolerant North American wood frog, <i>Rana sylvatica</i>","Dawson, Neal J. and Storey, Kenneth B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Wood frogs inhabit a broad range across North America, extending from the southern tip of the Appalachian Mountains to the northern boreal forest. Remarkably, they can survive the winter in a frozen state, where as much as 70\% of their body water is converted into ice. Whilst in the frozen state, their hearts cease to pump blood, causing their cells to experience ischemia, which can dramatically increase the production of reactive oxygen species within the cell. To overcome this, wood frogs have elevated levels of glutathione, a primary antioxidant. We examined the regulation of glutathione reductase, the enzyme involved in recycling glutathione, in both the frozen and unfrozen (control) state. Glutathione reductase activity from both the control and frozen state showed a dramatic reduction in substrate specificity (K-m) for oxidized glutathione (50\%) when measured in the presence of glucose (300 mmol l(-1)) and a increase (157\%) when measured in the presence of levels of urea (75 mmol l(-1)) encountered in the frozen state. However, when we tested the synergistic effect of urea and glucose simultaneously, we observed a substantial reduction in the K-m for oxidized glutathione (43\%) to a value similar to that with glucose alone. In fact, we found no observable differences in the kinetic and structural properties of glutathione reductase between the two states. Therefore, a significant increase in the affinity for oxidized glutathione in the presence of endogenous levels of glucose suggests that increased glutathione recycling may occur as a result of passive regulation of glutathione reductase by rising levels of glucose during freezing.",2017,10.1242/jeb.159475,220,17,3162-3171,NA,Antioxidants; Enzyme kinetics; Freezing; Metabolic rate depression; Phosphorylation
article,"Continuous arterial <i>P</i><sub>O2</sub> profiles in unrestrained, undisturbed aquatic turtles during routine behaviors","Williams, Cassondra L. and Hicks, James W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Mammals and birds maintain high arterial partial pressure of oxygen (P-O2) values in order to preserve near-complete hemoglobin (Hb) oxygen (O-2) saturation. In diving mammals and birds, arterial O-2 follows a primarily monotonic decline and then recovers quickly after dives. In laboratory studies of submerged freshwater turtles, arterial O-2 depletion typically follows a similar pattern. However, in these studies, turtles were disturbed, frequently tethered to external equipment and confined either to small tanks or breathing holes. Aquatic turtles can alter cardiac shunting patterns, which will affect arterial P-O2 values. Consequently, little is known about arterial O-2 regulation and use in undisturbed turtles. We conducted the first study to continuously measure arterial P-O2 using implanted microelectrodes and a backpack logger in undisturbed red-eared sliders during routine activities. Arterial P-O2 profiles during submergences varied dramatically, with no consistent patterns. Arterial P-O2 was also lower than previously reported during all activities, with values rarely above 50 mmHg (85\% Hb saturation). There was no difference in mean P-O2 between five different activities: submerged resting, swimming, basking, resting at the surface and when a person was present. These results suggest significant cardiac shunting occurs during routine activities as well as submergences. However, the lack of relationship between P-O2 and any activity suggests that cardiac shunts are not regulated to maintain high arterial P-O2 values. These data support the idea that cardiac shunting is the passive by-product of regulation of vascular resistances by the autonomic nervous system.",2016,10.1242/jeb.141010,219,22,3616-3625,NA,Turtle; Arterial P-O2; Trachemys scripta; Cardiac shunt; Blood oxygen depletion; Diving

Developmental challenge is known to affect growth, development of several organs, and several physiological mechanisms (such as HPA responsiveness, oxidative stress or immunity), which may altogether affect adult metabolism. All of these developmental effects are likely to be mediated by glucocorticoids, but the impact of developmental glucocorticoid exposure on adult metabolism has rarely been studied and the results are equivocal. In this study, we examined the impact of developmental exposure to corticosterone (CORT, the main avian glucocorticoid hormone) on resting metabolic rate (RMR, measured in thermoneutrality, 25 degrees C) and thermoregulatory metabolic rate (TMR, measured in cold challenge conditions, 5 degrees C) in the house sparrow. Following experimental administration of CORT at the nestling stage, house sparrows were kept in captivity until adulthood, when their metabolism was measured. We found that post-natal CORT exposure decreased both RMR and TMR in adult sparrows. This CORT-mediated reduction of metabolism was also associated with a reduced overnight body mass loss. Therefore, our results suggest that developmental CORT exposure can orient the phenotype towards an energy-saving strategy, which may be beneficial in a constraining environmental context.",2019,10.1242/jeb.211771,222,22,NA,jeb211771,Early-life stress; Glucocorticoids; Energy expenditure; Metabolic rate
article,Run don't walk: locomotor performance of geckos on wet substrates,"Stark, Alyssa Y. and Ohlemacher, Jocelyn and Knight, Ashley and Niewiarowski, Peter H.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The gecko adhesive system has been under particular scrutiny for over a decade, as the field has recently attracted attention for its application to bio-inspired design. However, little is known about how the adhesive system behaves in ecologically relevant conditions. Geckos inhabit a variety of environments, many of which are characterized by high temperature, humidity and rain. The van der Waals-based gecko adhesive system should be particularly challenged by wet substrates because water can disrupt the intimate contact necessary for adhesion. While a few previous studies have focused on the clinging ability of geckos on wet substrates, we tested a dynamic performance characteristic, sprint velocity. To better understand how substrate wettability and running orientation affect locomotor performance of multiple species on wet substrates, we measured average sprint velocity of five species of gecko on substrates that were either hydrophilic or intermediately wetting and oriented either vertically or horizontally. Surprisingly, we found no indication that wet substrates impact average sprint velocity over 1 m, and rather, in some species, sprint velocity was increased on wet substrates rather than reduced. When investigating physical characteristics and behavior that may be associated with running on wet substrates, such as total number of stops, slips and wet toes at the completion of a race, we found that there may be habitat-related differences between some species. Our results show that in general, unlike clinging and walking, geckos running along wet substrates suffer no significant loss in locomotor performance over short distances.",2015,10.1242/jeb.120683,218,15,2435-2441,NA,Gecko; Adhesion; van der Waals; Wetting; Locomotion
article,The sugar meal of the African malaria mosquito <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> and how deterrent compounds interfere with it: a behavioural and neurophysiological study,"Kessler, Sebastien and Vlimant, Michele and Guerin, Patrick M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In this study, we show that female African malaria mosquitoes Anopheles gambiae starved for 3-5 h start to engorge on sucrose at concentrations between 50 and 75 mmol l(-1). Half of the feeding response (ED50) is reached at 111 mmol l(-1) and the maximum response (0.4. mg) occurs at 250 mmol l(-1). Two receptor cells in a trichoid sensillum of the labellum, called the `sucrose' and `water' neurones, are activated by sucrose and water, respectively. The electrophysiological response of the sucrose receptor cell starts well below the level of sugar necessary to induce engorgement. The sugar receptor cell is most sensitive to small increments in sucrose concentration up to 10 mmol l(-1) with a response plateau from 25 mmol l(-1). Fructose has a mild phagostimulatory effect on A. gambiae, whereas no significant differences in meal sizes between water and glucose were found. However, when 146 mmol. l(-1) fructose plus glucose are mixed, the same engorgement as on 146 mmol l(-1) sucrose is observed. Likewise, even though the sucrose receptor cell is not activated by either fructose or glucose alone, equimolar solutions of fructose plus glucose activate the neurone. We conclude that there is a behavioural and neurophysiological synergism between fructose and glucose, the two hexose sugars of sucrose. We show that some bitter-tasting products for humans have a deterrent effect on feeding in A. gambiae. When 1 mmol l(-1) quinidine, quinine or denatonium benzoate is added to 146 mmol l(-1) sucrose, feeding is almost totally inhibited. The effect of berberine is lower and no significant inhibition on engorgement occurs for caffeine. The deterrent effect depends on the concentration for both quinine and quinidine. Capillary feeding experiments show that contact chemosensilla on the mouthparts are sufficient for the detection of sucrose and bitter products. The feeding assay findings with deterrents correlate with the neurophysiological responses of the sucrose and water labellar neurones, which are both inhibited by the bitter compounds denatonium benzoate, quinine and berberine between 0.01 and 1 mmol l(-1), but not by the same concentrations of caffeine. In conclusion, sucrose stimulates feeding and activates the labellar sucrose neurone, whereas feeding deterrents inhibit both the sucrose and water neurones. This study provides an initial understanding of the physiological mechanisms involved in sugar feeding in A. gambiae and shows how some bitter products interfere with it.",2013,10.1242/jeb.076588,216,7,1292-1306,NA,Anopheles gambiae; malaria mosquito; insect gustation; taste neurone; nectar feeding; feeding deterrent
article,Vision is highly sensitive to oxygen availability in marine invertebrate larvae,"McCormick, Lillian R. and Levin, Lisa A. and Oesch, Nicholas W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"For many animals, evolution has selected for complex visual systems despite the high energetic demands associated with maintaining eyes and their processing structures. Therefore, the metabolic demands of visual systems make them highly sensitive to fluctuations in available oxygen. In the marine environment, oxygen changes over daily, seasonal and inter-annual time scales, and there are large gradients of oxygen with depth. Vision is linked to survival in many marine animals, particularly among the crustaceans, cephalopods and fish, and early life stages of these groups rely on vision for prey capture, predator detection and their distribution in the water column. Using in vivo electroretinogram recordings, we show that there is a decrease in retinal sensitivity to light in marine invertebrates when exposed to reduced oxygen availability. We found a 60-100\% reduction in retinal responses in the larvae of cephalopods and crustaceans: the market squid (Doryteuthis opalescens), the two-spot octopus (Octopus bimaculatus), the tuna crab (Pleuroncodes planipes) and the graceful rock crab (Metacarcinus gracilis). A decline in oxygen also decreases the temporal resolution of vision in D. opalescens. These results are the first demonstration that vision in marine invertebrates is highly sensitive to oxygen availability and that the thresholds for visual impairment from reduced oxygen are species-specific. Oxygen-impaired retinal function may change the visual behaviors crucial to survival in these marine larvae. These findings may impact our understanding of species' vulnerability to ocean oxygen loss and suggest that researchers conducting electrophysiology experiments should monitor oxygen levels, as even small changes in oxygen may affect the results.",2019,10.1242/jeb.200899,222,10,NA,jeb200899,Zooplankton; Phototransduction; Physiology; Electroretinogram; Hypoxia
article,Aquatic surface respiration and swimming behaviour in adult and developing zebrafish exposed to hypoxia,"Abdallah, Sara J. and Thomas, Benjamin S. and Jonz, Michael G.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Severe hypoxia elicits aquatic surface respiration (ASR) behaviour in many species of fish, where ventilation of the gills at the air-water interface improves O-2 uptake and survival. ASR is an important adaptation that may have given rise to air breathing in vertebrates. The neural substrate of this behaviour, however, is not defined. We characterized ASR in developing and adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) to ascertain a potential role for peripheral chemoreceptors in initiation or modulation of this response. Adult zebrafish exposed to acute, progressive hypoxia (P-O2 from 158 to 15 mmHg) performed ASR with a threshold of 30 mmHg, and spent more time at the surface as P-O2 decreased. Acclimation to hypoxia attenuated ASR responses. In larvae, ASR behaviour was observed between 5 and 21 days postfertilization with a threshold of 16 mmHg. Zebrafish decreased swimming behaviour (i.e. distance, velocity and acceleration) as P-O2 was decreased, with a secondary increase in behaviour near or below threshold P-O2. In adults that underwent a 10-day intraperitoneal injection regime of 10 mu g g(-1) serotonin (5-HT) or 20 mu g g(-1) acetylcholine (ACh), an acute bout of hypoxia (15 mmHg) increased the time engaged in ASR by 5.5 and 4.9 times, respectively, compared with controls. Larvae previously immersed in 10 mu mol l(-1) 5-HT or ACh also displayed an increased ASR response. Our results support the notion that ASR is a behavioural response that is reliant upon input from peripheral O-2 chemoreceptors.

article,Breathing versus feeding in the Pacific hagfish,"Eom, Junho and Lauridsen, Henrik and Wood, Chris M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Hagfish represent the oldest extant connection to the ancestral vertebrates, but their physiology is not well understood. Using behavioural (video), physiological (respirometry, flow measurements), classical morphological (dissection, silicone injection) and modem imaging approaches (micro-MRI, DICE micro-CT), we examined the interface between feeding and the unique breathing mechanism (nostril opening, high-frequency velum contraction, low-frequency gill pouch contraction and pharyngo-cutaneous duct contraction) in the Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii. A video tour via micro-MRI is presented through the breathing and feeding passages. We have reconciled an earlier disagreement as to the position of the velum chamber, which powers inhalation through the nostril, placing it downstream of the merging point of the food and water passage, such that the oronasal septum terminates at the anterior end of the velum chamber. When feeding occurs by engulfment of large chunks by the dental plates, food movement through the chamber may transiently interfere with breathing. Swallowing is accelerated by peristaltic body undulation involving the ventral musculature, and is complete within 5 s. After a large meal (anchovy, 20\% body mass), hagfish remain motionless, defaecating bones and scales at 1.7 days and an intestinal peritrophic membrane at 5 days. O-2 consumption rate approximately doubles within 1 h of feeding, remaining elevated for 12-24 h. This is achieved by combinations of elevated O-2 utilization and ventilatory flow, the latter caused by varying increases in velar contraction frequency and stroke volume. Additional imaging casts light on the reasons for the trend for greater O-2 utilization by more posterior pouches and the pharyngo-cutaneous duct in fasted hagfish.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243989,225,6,NA,jeb243989,DICE micro-CT; Engulfment; Gill pouches; Oxygen consumption rate; (M)over dot(O2); Micro-MRI; Ventilation
article,Archerfish use their shooting technique to produce adaptive underwater jets,"Dewenter, Jana and Gerullis, Peggy and Hecker, Alexander and Schuster, Stefan",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Archerfish are renowned for dislodging aerial prey using well-aimed shots of water. Recently it has been shown that these fish can shape their aerial jets by adjusting the dynamics of their mouth opening and closing. This allows the fish to adjust their jet to target distance so that they can forcefully hit prey over considerable distances. Here, we suggest that archerfish use the same technique to also actively control jets under water. Fired from close range, the underwater jets are powerful enough to lift up buried food particles, which the fish then can pick up. We trained fish so that we could monitor their mouth opening and closing maneuvers during underwater shooting and compare them with those employed in aerial shooting. Our analysis suggests that the fish use the same dynamic mechanism to produce aerial and underwater jets and that they employ the same basic technique to adjust their jets in both conditions. When food is buried in substrate that consists of large particles, the fish use a brief pulse, but they use a longer one when the substrate is more fine-grained. These findings extend the notion that archerfish can flexibly shape their jets to be appropriate in different contexts and suggest that archerfish shooting might have been shaped both by constraints in aerial and underwater shooting.",2017,10.1242/jeb.146936,220,6,1019-1025,NA,Animal tool use; Water jet; Animal cognition; Biomechanics; Evolution
article,Long-day photoperiod interacts with vasopressin and food restriction to modulate reproductive status and vasopressin receptor expression of male golden spiny mice,"Ben-Zaken, Israel and Haim, Abraham and Zubidat, Abed E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"We tested the effects of photoperiod, water and food availability on body mass, reproductive status and arginine vasopressin receptor 1A (Avpr1a) mRNA expression in males of desert-adapted golden spiny mice, Acomys russatus. In Experiment 1, males were acclimated to short-day (SD; 8 h: 16 h light: dark) or long-day (LD; 16 h: 8 h light: dark) photoperiods with either saline (control) or vasopressin treatment for 3 weeks. The results of this experiment revealed that under control conditions, SD mice increased body mass by similar to 5\% while LD mice decreased it by similar to 4\%. SD photoperiod had no effect on reproductive status and leptin levels, whereas LD males increased testes mass and serum testosterone, but the photoperiod had no effect on leptin levels. Vasopressin administration decreased LD-induced reproductive enhancement. Because no consistent effect of SD treatment was found on reproductive status, Experiment 2 was carried out only on LD-acclimated males kept under 75\% food restriction (decrease from ad libitum) with saline or leptin treatment. Body mass, testes mass, serum testosterone, leptin concentrations and Avpr1a mRNA expression were measured. Food restriction remarkably decreased body mass, with a more potent effect in leptin-treated males, showing enhanced reproductive status and a significant increase in serum leptin compared with controls. Avpr1a expression was significantly upregulated in LD, vasopressin-treated and food-restricted males, with higher levels in the hypothalamus compared with the testes. We conclude that in A. russatus, LD photoperiod interacts with water and food availability to advance reproductive responses. Avpr1a is suggested to integrate nutritional and osmotic signals to optimize reproduction by modulating reproductive and energetic neuroendocrine axes at the central level.

J. and Marvelde, Luc To and Gienapp, Phillip",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Reproduction is energetically expensive and to obtain sufficient energy, animals can either alter their metabolic system over time to increase energy intake (increased-intake hypothesis) or reallocate energy from maintenance processes (compensation hypothesis). The first hypothesis predicts a positive relationship between basal metabolic rate (BMR) and energy expenditure (DEE) because of the higher energy demands of the metabolic system at rest. The second hypothesis predicts a trade-off between different body functions, with a reduction of the BMR as a way to compensate for increased daytime energetic expenditure. We experimentally manipulated the workload of wild pied flycatchers by adding or removing chicks when chicks were 2 and 11 days old. We then measured the feeding frequency (FF). DEE and BMR at day 11, allowing us to assess both short- and long-term effects of increased workload. The manipulation at day 2 caused an increase in FF when broods were enlarged, but no response in DEE or BMR, while the manipulation at day 11 caused an increase in FF, no change in DEE and a decrease in BMR in birds with more chicks. Our results suggest that pied flycatchers adjust their workload but that this does not lead to a higher BMR at night (no support for the increased-intake hypothesis). In the short term, we found that birds reallocate energy with a consequent reduction of BMR (evidence for the compensation hypothesis). Birds thus resort to short-term strategies to increase energy expenditure, which could explain why energy expenditure and hard work are not always correlated in birds.",2019,10.1242/jeb.199513,222,14,NA,jeb199513,Ficedula hypoleuca; Increased-intake hypothesis; Compensation hypothesis; Basal metabolic rate; Daily energy expenditure; Feeding frequency

article,"Rapid cold hardening improves recovery of ion homeostasis and chill coma recovery time in the migratory locust, <i>Locusta migratoria</i>","Findsen, Anders and Andersen, Jonas Lembcke and Calderon, Sofia and Overgaard, Johannes",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Chill tolerance of insects is defined as the ability to tolerate low temperature under circumstances not involving freezing of intracellular or extracellular fluids. For many insects chill tolerance is crucial for their ability to persist in cold environments and mounting evidence indicates that chill tolerance is associated with the ability to maintain ion and water homeostasis, thereby ensuring muscular function and preventing chill injury at low temperature. The present study describes the relationship between muscle and haemolymph ion homeostasis and time to regain posture following cold shock (CS, 2 h at -4 degrees C) in the chill-susceptible locust Locusta migratoria. This relationship was examined in animals with and without a prior rapid cold-hardening treatment (RCH, 2 h at 0 degrees C) to investigate the physiological underpinnings of RCH. CS elicited a doubling of haemolymph {[}K+] and this disturbance was greater in locusts pre-exposed to RCH. Recovery of ion homeostasis was, however, markedly faster in RCH-treated animals, which correlated well with whole-organism performance as hardened individuals regained posture faster than non-hardened individuals following CS. The present study indicates that loss and recovery of muscular function are associated with the resting membrane potential of excitable membranes as attested by the changes in the equilibrium potential for K+ (E-K) following CS. Both hardened and non-hardened animals regained movement once K+ homeostasis had recovered to a fixed level (E-K approximate to-41 mV). RCH is therefore not associated with altered sensitivity to ion disturbance but instead is correlated to a faster recovery of haemolymph {[}K+].",2013,10.1242/jeb.081141,216,9,1630-1637,NA,Nernst potential; Orthoptera; acute cold shock survival; LT50; reproductive behaviour; threshold potential
article,A cognitive map in a poison frog,"Liu, Yuxiang and Day, Lainy B. and Summers, Kyle and Burmeister, Sabrina S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"A fundamental question in cognitive science is whether an animal can use a cognitive map. A cognitive map is a mental representation of the external world, and knowledge of one's place in this world, that can be used to determine efficient routes to any destination. Many birds and mammals are known to employ a cognitive map, but whether other vertebrates can create a cognitive map is less clear. Amphibians are capable of using beacons, gradients and landmarks when navigating, and many are proficient at homing. Yet only one prior study directly tested for a cognitive map in amphibians, with negative results. Poison frogs exhibit unusually complex social and spatial behaviors and are capable of long-distance homing after displacement, suggesting that they may be using complex spatial navigation strategies in nature. Here, we trained the poison frog Dendrobates auratus in a modified Morris water maze that was designed to suppress thigmotaxis to the maze wall, promoting exploration of the arena. In our moat maze, the poison frogs were able to use a configuration of visual cues to find the hidden platform. Moreover, we demonstrate that they chose direct paths to the goal from multiple random initial positions, a hallmark of a cognitive map. The performance of the frogs in the maze was qualitatively similar to that of rodents, suggesting that the potential to evolve a cognitive map is an evolutionarily conserved trait of vertebrates.",2019,10.1242/jeb.197467,222,11,NA,jeb197467,Parallel map theory; Sketch map; Spatial cognition; Morris water maze; Trajectory analysis; Amphibian; Poison dart frog
article,Potential sources of intra-population variation in the overwintering strategy of painted turtle (<i>Chrysemys picta</i>) hatchlings,"Riley, Julia L. and Tattersall, Glenn J. and Litzgus, Jacqueline D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Many temperate animals spend half their lives in a non-active, overwintering state, and multiple adaptations have evolved to enable winter survival. One notable vertebrate model is Chrysemys picta, whose hatchlings display dichotomous overwintering strategies: some hatchlings spend their first winter aquatically after nest emergence in the autumn, whereas others overwinter terrestrially within their natal nest with subsequent emergence in the spring. The occurrence of these strategies varies among populations and temporally within populations; however, factors that determine the strategy employed by a nest in nature are unknown. We examined potential factors that influence intra-population variation in the overwintering strategy of C. picta hatchlings over two winters in Algonquin Park, Ontario. We found that environmental factors may be a trigger for the hatchling overwintering strategy: autumn-emerging nests were sloped towards the water and were surrounded by a relatively higher percentage of bare ground compared with spring-emerging nests. Autumn-emerging hatchlings were also relatively smaller. Overwintering strategy was not associated with clutch oviposition sequence, or mammalian or avian predation attempts. Instead, autumn emergence from the nest was associated with the direct mortality threat of predation by sarcophagid fly larvae. Body condition and righting response, measured as proxies of hatchling fitness, did not differ between overwintering strategies. Costs and benefits of overwintering aquatically versus terrestrially in hatchling C. picta are largely unknown, and have the potential to affect population dynamics. Understanding winter survival has great implications for turtle ecology, thus we emphasize areas for future research on dichotomous overwintering strategies in temperate hatchling turtles.",2014,10.1242/jeb.111120,217,23,4174-4183,NA,Body condition; Fitness; Freeze tolerance; Maternal effects; Nest environment; Nest predators; Supercooling; Temperature
article,Mallard landing behavior on water follows a \_?-constant braking strategy,"Whitehead, John G. and Worrell, Terrell and Socha, John J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Many flying animals use optic flow to control their flight. During landing maneuvers, pigeons, hummingbirds, bats, Draco lizards and bees use the \_tau-constant braking strategy. This strategy regulates the approach by keeping the ratio of distance to an object and the rate of change of that distance constant. In keeping this ratio, \_tau, constant, a variety of deceleration profiles can lead to different collision avoidance behaviors. The landing behaviors listed above all qualify as controlled collisions, where the animal is decelerating into the object. We examined whether the same regulatory strategy is employed by mallards when landing on water. Video of mallard landing behavior was recorded at a local pond and digitized. Kinematic and tau parameters were calculated for each landing (N=177). The Pearson correlation coefficient for tau with respect to time to land was 0.99 +/- 0.02, indicating mallards employ a controlled -collision strategy. This result implies regulation by the birds to fix tau\_ as constant while landing (on average, 0.90 +/- 0.13). In comparison with other active flyers, mallards use a higher value of tau\_ when landing (0.775 +/- 0.109, 0.710 +/- 0.132 and 0.702 +/- 0.052 for pigeons, hummingbirds and bats, respectively). This higher tau\_ may reflect physical differences in substrate from solid to liquid. The higher compliance of water in comparison to a solid substrate may reduce impact forces that could be injurious on a solid substrate, thereby enabling mallards to approach faster and expend less energy for costly, slow flight.",2023,10.1242/jeb.244256,226,5,NA,jeb244256,Controlled collision; Anas platyrhynchos; Tau theory; Optic flow; Kinematics

A. and Riley, Julia L. and Senior, Alistair M. and Warner, Daniel A. and While, Geoffrey M. and Schwanz, Lisa E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"During the vulnerable stages of early life, most ectothermic animals experience hourly and diel fluctuations in temperature as air temperatures change. While we know a great deal about how different constant temperatures impact the phenotypes of developing ectotherms, we know remarkably little about the impacts of temperature fluctuations on the development of ectotherms. In this study, we used a meta-analytic approach to compare the mean and variance of phenotypic outcomes from constant and fluctuating incubation temperatures across reptile species. We found that fluctuating temperatures provided a small benefit (higher hatching success and shorter incubation durations) at cool mean temperatures compared with constant temperatures, but had a negative effect at warm mean temperatures. In addition, more extreme temperature fluctuations led to greater reductions in embryonic survival compared with moderate temperature fluctuations. Within the limited data available from species with temperature-dependent sex determination, embryos had a higher chance of developing as female when developing in fluctuating temperatures compared with those developing in constant temperatures. With our meta-analytic approach, we identified average mean nest temperatures across all taxa where reptiles switch from receiving benefits to incurring costs when incubation temperatures fluctuate. More broadly, our study indicates that the impact of fluctuating developmental temperature on some phenotypes in ectothermic taxa are likely to be predictable via integration of developmental temperature profiles with thermal performance curves.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243369,225,"1, SI",NA,jeb243369,Developmental stability; Phenotypic plasticity; Phenotypic variance; Squamate; Systematic review; Turtle
article,"Increase in cardiac myosin heavy-chain (MyHC) alpha protein isoform in hibernating ground squirrels, with echocardiographic visualization of ventricular wall hypertrophy and prolonged contraction","Nelson, O. Lynne and Rourke, Bryan C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Deep hibernators such as golden-mantled ground squirrels (Callospermophilus lateralis) have multiple challenges to cardiac function during low temperature torpor and subsequent arousals. As heart rates fall from over 300 beats min(-1) to less than 10, chamber dilation and reduced cardiac output could lead to congestive myopathy. We performed echocardiography on a cohort of individuals prior to and after several months of hibernation. The left ventricular chamber exhibited eccentric and concentric hypertrophy during hibernation and thus calculated ventricular mass was similar to 30\% greater. Ventricular ejection fraction was mildly reduced during hibernation but stroke volumes were greater due to the eccentric hypertrophy and dramatically increased diastolic filling volumes. Globally, the systolic phase in hibernation was similar to 9.5 times longer, and the diastolic phase was 28x longer. Left atrial ejection generally was not observed during hibernation. Atrial ejection returned weakly during early arousal. Strain echocardiography assessed the velocity and total movement distance of contraction and relaxation for regional ventricular segments in active and early arousal states. Myocardial systolic strain during early arousal was significantly greater than the active state, indicating greater total contractile movement. This mirrored the increased ventricular ejection fraction noted with early arousal. However, strain rates were slower during early arousal than during the active period, particularly systolic strain, which was 33\% of active, compared with the rate of diastolic strain, which was 67\% of active. As heart rate rose during the arousal period, myocardial velocities and strain rates also increased; this was matched closely by cardiac output. Curiously, though heart rates were only 26\% of active heart rates during early arousal, the cardiac output was nearly 40\% of the active state, suggesting an efficient pumping system. We further analyzed proportions of cardiac myosin heavy-chain (MyHC) isoforms in a separate cohort of squirrels over 5 months, including time points before hibernation, during hibernation and just prior to emergence. Hibernating individuals were maintained in both a 4 degrees C cold room and a 20 degrees C warm room. Measured by SDS-PAGE, relative percentages of cardiac MyHC alpha were increased during hibernation, at both hibernacula temperatures. A potential increase in contractile speed, and power, from more abundant MyHC alpha may aid force generation at low temperature and at low heart rates. Unlike many models of cardiomyopathies where the alpha isoform is replaced by the beta isoform in order to reduce oxygen consumption, ground squirrels demonstrate a potential cardioprotective mechanism to maintain cardiac output during torpor.",2013,10.1242/jeb.088773,216,24,4678-4690,NA,hibernation; MyHC; echocardiogram; atrial contraction; cardiac function
article,Modelling colour constancy in fish: implications for vision and signalling in water,"Wilkins, Lucas and Marshall, N. Justin and Johnsen, Sonke and Osorio, D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Colour vision and colour signals are important to aquatic animals, but light scattering and absorption by water distorts spectral stimuli. To investigate the performance of colour vision in water, and to suggest how photoreceptor spectral sensitivities and body colours might evolve for visual communication, we model the effects of changes in viewing distance and depth on the appearance of fish colours for three teleosts: a barracuda, Sphyraena helleri, which is dichromatic and two damselfishes, Chromis verater and Chromis hanui, which are trichromatic. We assume that photoreceptors light-adapt to the background, thereby implementing the von Kries transformation, which can largely account for observed colour constancy in humans and other animals, including fish. This transformation does not, however, compensate for light scattering over variable viewing distances, which in less than a metre seriously impairs dichromatic colour vision, and makes judgement of colour saturation unreliable for trichromats. The von Kries transformation does substantially offset colour shifts caused by changing depth, so that from depths of 0 to 30 m modelled colour changes (i.e. failures of colour constancy) are sometimes negligible. However, the magnitudes and directions of remaining changes are complex, depending upon the specific spectral sensitivities of the receptors and the reflectance spectra. This predicts that when judgement of colour is important, the spectra of signalling colours and photoreceptor spectral sensitivities should be evolutionarily linked, with the colours dependent on photoreceptor spectral sensitivities, and vice versa.",2016,10.1242/jeb.139147,219,12,1884-1892,NA,Colour; Vision; Fish; Colour constancy; Communication; Evolution
article,Defensive slime formation in Pacific hagfish requires Ca<SUP>2+</SUP>- and aquaporin-mediated swelling of released mucin vesicles,"Herr, Julia E. and Clifford, Alexander M. and Goss, Greg G. and Fudge, Douglas S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Hagfishes defend themselves from fish predators via the rapid deployment of a fibrous slime that adheres to and clogs gills. The slime transforms from a thick glandular exudate to a fully hydrated product in a fraction of a second through a process that involves the swelling and rupture of numerous mucin vesicles. Here we demonstrate that the vesicle membrane plays an important role in regulating the swelling of mucin granules, and provide evidence that the membrane contains proteins that facilitate the movement of ions and water molecules. By exposing isolated mucin vesicles to varying combinations of inorganic ions, organic compounds and membrane channel inhibitors, we found that the majority of hagfish mucin vesicles require Ca2+ to rupture. We also show that Ca2+-dependent rupture can be pharmacologically inhibited, which suggests a role for Ca2+-activated membrane transporters. We demonstrate that the aquaporin inhibitor mercuric chloride reduces the rate of vesicle swelling by an order of magnitude, which suggests that aquaporins facilitate the influx of water during vesicle deployment. Molecular evidence of two aquaporin homologues expressed in the slime glands further supports this idea. We propose a model of hagfish slime mucin vesicle rupture that involves Ca2+-activated transporters and aquaporins, and suggest that the presence of these proteins is an adaptation for increasing the speed of vesicle rupture and, consequently, the speed of the sliming response of hagfishes.",2014,10.1242/jeb.101584,217,13,2288-2296,NA,Mucin; Transporter; Holocrine secretion; Mucus; Slime gland
article,Previous motor activity affects the transition from uncertainty to decision making in snails,"Korshunova, Tatiana A. and Vorontsov, Dmitry D. and Dyakonova, Varvara E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"One of the most widely accepted benefits of enhanced physical activity is an improvement in the symptoms of depression, including the facilitation of decision making. Up until now, these effects have been shown in rodents and humans only. Little is known about their evolutionary origin or biological basis, and the underlying cellular mechanisms also remain relatively elusive. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that preceding motor activity accelerates decision making in an invertebrate, the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis. To investigate decision making in a novel environment, snails, which normally live in water, were placed on a flat dry surface to simulate the potentially threatening consequence of being in an arid environment. This stimulus initiated two distinct phases in snail behaviour: slow circular movements, followed by intense locomotion in a chosen direction. The first phase was prolonged when the test arena was symmetrically lit, compared with one with an apparent gradient of light. However, forced muscular locomotion for 2 h prior to the test promoted the transition from random circular motions to a directional crawl, accompanied by an increase in crawling speed but with no effect on the choice of direction. Intense locomotion for 2 h also produced a strong excitatory effect on the activity of serotonergic neurons in L. stagnalis. Our results suggest that the beneficial effects of physical exercise on cognitive performance in mammals might have deep roots in evolution, granting the opportunity to unravel the origins of such effects at the single-neuron and network levels.",2016,10.1242/jeb.146837,219,22,3635-3641,NA,Locomotion; Arousal; Novelty; Behavioural choice; Behavioural modulation; Antidepressant effects

Bat forelimbs are elongated to function as wings, which makes them vulnerable to heat loss and exaggerates regional heterothermy. A tropical bat species, Carollia perspicillata, flies with distal wing muscles that are substantially (>10 degrees C) cooler than proximal wing muscles and significantly less temperature sensitive. We hypothesized that the difference between proximal and distal wing muscles would be even more extreme in a temperate bat species that is capable of flight at variable environmental temperatures. We measured the contractile properties of the proximal pectoralis muscle and distal extensor carpi radialis muscle at a range of temperatures in the big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, and compared their thermal dependence with that of the same muscles in C. perspicillata. We found that, overall, temperature sensitivities between species were remarkably similar. The sole exception was the shortening velocity of the pectoralis muscle in E. fuscus, which was less temperature sensitive than in C. perspicillata. This decreased temperature sensitivity in a proximal muscle runs counter to our prediction. We suggest that the relative lability of body temperature in E. fuscus may make better pectoralis function at low temperatures advantageous.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243987,225,11,NA,jeb243987,Chiroptera; Contractile properties; Flight; Muscle physiology; Muscle temperature
article,Thermal acclimation offsets the negative effects of nitrate on aerobic scope and performance,"Isaza, Daniel F. Gomez and Cramp, Rebecca L. and Franklin, Craig E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Rising temperatures are set to imperil freshwater fishes as climate change ensues unless compensatory strategies are employed. However, the presence of additional stressors, such as elevated nitrate concentrations, may affect the efficacy of compensatory responses. Here, juvenile silver perch (Bidyanus bidyanus) were exposed to current-day summer temperatures (28 degrees C) or a future climate-warming scenario (32 degrees C) and simultaneously exposed to one of three ecologically relevant nitrate concentrations (0, 50 or 100 mg l(-1)). We measured indicators of fish performance (growth, swimming), aerobic scope (AS) and upper thermal tolerance (CTmax) to test the hypothesis that nitrate exposure would increase susceptibility to elevated temperatures and limit thermal compensatory responses. After 8 weeks of acclimation, the thermal sensitivity and plasticity of AS and swimming performance were tested at three test temperatures (28, 32, 36 degrees C). The AS of 28 degrees C-acclimated fish declined with increasing temperature, and the effect was more pronounced in nitrate-exposed individuals. In these fish, declines in AS corresponded with poorer swimming performance and a 0.8 degrees C decrease in CTmax compared with unexposed fish. In contrast, acclimation to 32 degrees C masked the effects of nitrate; fish acclimated to 32 degrees C displayed a thermally insensitive phenotype whereby locomotor performance remained unchanged, AS was maintained and CTmax was increased by 1 degrees C irrespective of nitrate treatment compared with fish acclimated to 28 degrees C. However, growth was markedly reduced in 32 degrees C-acclimated compared with 28 degrees C-acclimated fish. Our results indicate that nitrate exposure increases the susceptibility of fish to acute high temperatures, but thermal compensation can override some of these potentially detrimental effects.",2020,10.1242/jeb.224444,223,16,NA,jeb224444,Climate change; Cross-tolerance; Eutrophication; Multiple stressors; Plasticity; Swimming performance

To determine whether f(H) also predicts oxygen consumption (V-O2) during torpor, we simultaneously measured V-O2,f(H) and subcutaneous body temperature (T-sub) of a hibernator, Gould's long-eared bats (Nyctophilus gouldi, 9 g, N=18), at ambient temperatures (T-a) between 0 and 25 degrees C. At rest, f(H) of normothermic resting bats was negatively correlated with T-a, with maximum fH of 803 beats min(-1) (T-a=5 degrees C). During torpor, the relationship between f(H) and T-a was curvilinear, and at low T-sub (similar to 6 degrees C), f(H) fell to a minimum average of 8 beats min-1. The minimum average values for both V-O2 and f(H) in torpor reported here were among the lowest recorded for bats. The relationship between f(H) and V-O2 was significant for both resting (r(2)=0.64, P<0.001) and torpid bats (r(2)=0.84, P<0.001), with no overlap between the two states. These variables were also significantly correlated (r(2)=0.44, P<0.001) for entire torpor bouts. Moreover, estimates of V-O2 from f(H) did not differ significantly from measured values during the different physiological states. Our study is the first to investigate the accuracy of f(H) as a predictor of V-O2 during torpor and indicates the reliability of this method as a potential measure of energy expenditure in the field.

Elizabeth and Willett, Christopher S. and Kingsolver, Joel G.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Extreme high temperatures associated with climate change can affect species directly, and indirectly through temperature-mediated species interactions. In most host-parasitoid systems, parasitization inevitably kills the host, but differences in heat tolerance between host and parasitoid, and between different hosts, may alter their interactions. Here, we explored the effects of extreme high temperatures on the ecological outcomes - including, in some rare cases, escape from the developmental disruption of parasitism - of the parasitoid wasp, Cotesia congregata, and two co-occurring congeneric larval hosts, Manduca sexta and M. quinquemaculata. Both host species had higher thermal tolerance than C. congregata, resulting in a thermal mismatch characterized by parasitoid (but not host) mortality under extreme high temperatures. Despite parasitoid death at high temperatures, hosts typically remain developmentally disrupted from parasitism. However, high temperatures resulted in a partial developmental recovery from parasitism (reaching the wandering stage at the end of host larval development) in some host individuals, with a significantly higher frequency of this partial developmental recovery in M. quinquemaculata than in M. sexta. Hosts species also differed in their growth and development in the absence of parasitoids, with M. quinquemaculata developing faster and larger at high temperatures relative to M. sexta.

Metabolic rate increased as diapause progressed, and acclimation to variable conditions altered both metabolic intensity and thermal sensitivity. However, incorporating these two types of metabolic plasticity into energy use models did not improve energy use estimates, validated by empirical measurements of energy stores. While metabolic rate-temperature relationships are plastic during winter, the magnitude of inter-individual variability in energy stores overshadows the effects of incorporating plasticity into energy use models, highlighting the importance of within-population variation in energy reserves.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243422,225,4,NA,jeb243422,Climate change; Diapause; Metabolic intensity; Snow cover; Thermal sensitivity; Ecophysiological model

Survival to pupation declined with increasing number of heat waves. Multiple (but not single) heat waves significantly reduced development time and pupal mass; the best models for the data indicated that both the number and developmental timing of heat waves affected performance.

Feather-clipped females reduced the number of feeding visits and increased levels of constitutive innate immunity compared with unclipped females but did not fledge smaller nestlings. Thus, they increased self-maintenance without compromising current reproductive output. In contrast, feather clipping did not affect the number of feeding visits or innate immune function in males, despite increased heat loss rate.

Through simultaneous measurement of heart rate (f(H)) and oxygen consumption <(V)over dot>(O2), we show that the relationship between oxygen transport and cardiac function is substantially altered in thermoregulating torpid bats between 1 and -2 degrees C, compared with thermoconforming torpid bats at mild ambient temperatures (T-a 5-20 degrees C).

Below T-crit, animals began to thermoregulate, as indicated by a considerable but disproportionate increase in both f(H) and <(V)over dot>(O2). The maximum increase in fH was only 4-fold greater than the average thermoconforming minimum, compared with a 46-fold increase in <(V)over dot>(O2). The differential response of fH and <(V)over dot>(O2) to low T-a was reflected in a 15-fold increase in oxygen delivery per heart beat (cardiac oxygen pulse). During torpor at low T-a, thermoregulating bats maintained a relatively slow f(H) and compensated for increased metabolic demands by significantly increasing stroke volume and tissue oxygen extraction. Our study provides new information on the relationship between metabolism and f(H) in an unstudied physiological state that may occur frequently in the wild and can be extremely costly for heterothermic animals.",2018,10.1242/jeb.170894,221,1,NA,jeb170894,Oxygen consumption; Thermoregulation; Hibernation; Endotherm; Oxygen pulse; Thermoregulation; Thermogenic capacity
article,Effects of heat acclimation on cardiac function in the intertidal mussel <i>Mytilus californianus</i>: can laboratory-based indices predict survival in the field?,"Moyen, Nicole E. and Somero, George N. and Denny, Mark W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Thermal performance curves are commonly used to investigate the effects of heat acclimation on thermal tolerance and physiological performance. However, recent work indicates that the metrics of these curves heavily depend on experimental design and may be poor predictors of animal survival during heat events in the field. In intertidal mussels, cardiac thermal performance (CTP) tests have been widely used as indicators of animals' acclimation or acclimatization state, providing two indices of thermal responses: critical temperature (T-crit ; the temperature above which heart rate abruptly declines) and flatline temperature (T-flat; the temperature where heart rate ceases). Despite the wide use of CTP tests, it remains largely unknown how T-crit and T-flat change within a single individual after heat acclimation, and whether changes in these indices can predict altered survival in the field. Here, we addressed these issues by evaluating changes in CTP indices in the same individuals before and after heat acclimation. For control mussels, merely reaching T-crit was not lethal, whereas remaining at T-crit for >= 10 min was lethal. Heat acclimation significantly increased Tcrit only in mussels with an initially low T-crit (<35 degrees C), but improved their survival time above T-crit by 20 min on average. T-flat increased by similar to 1.6 degrees C with heat acclimation, but it is unlikely that increased Tflat improves survival in the field. In summary, T-crit and T-flat per se may fall short of providing quantitative indices of thermal tolerance in mussels; instead, a combination of T-crit and tolerance time at temperatures =T-crit better defines changes in thermal tolerance with heat acclimation.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243050,225,9,NA,jeb243050,Critical temperature; Flatline temperature; Heat stress; Physiological plasticity; Thermal performance curve; Thermal tolerance
article,Developmental effects of heatwave conditions on the early life stages of a coral reef fish,"Spinks, Rachel K. and Munday, Philip L. and Donelson, Jennifer M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Marine heatwaves, which are increasing in frequency, duration and intensity owing to climate change, are an imminent threat to marine ecosystems. On coral reefs, heatwave conditions often coincide with periods of peak recruitment of juvenile fishes and exposure to elevated temperature may affect their development. However, whether differences in the duration of high temperature exposure have effects on individual performance is unknown. We exposed juvenile spiny damselfish, Acanthochromis poiyacanthus, to increasing lengths of time (3, 7, 30 and 108 days post-hatching) of elevated temperature (+2 degrees C). After 108 days, we measured escape performance at present-day control and elevated temperatures, standard length, mass and critical thermal maximum. Using a Bayesian approach, we show that 30 days or more exposure to +2 degrees C leads to improved escape performance, irrespective of performance temperature, possibly owing to developmental effects of high temperature on muscle development and/or anaerobic metabolism. Continued exposure to elevated temperature for 108 days caused a reduction in body size compared with the control, but not in fish exposed to high temperature for 30 days or less. By contrast, exposure to elevated temperatures for any length of time had no effect on critical thermal maximum, which, combined with previous work, suggests a short-term physiological constraint of similar to 37 degrees C in this species. Our study shows that extended exposure to increased temperature can affect the development of juvenile fishes, with potential immediate and future consequences for individual performance.",2019,10.1242/jeb.202713,222,16,NA,jeb202713,Developmental plasticity; Climate change; Exposure duration; Escape response; Body size; Bayesian analysis
article,Cost of transport is a repeatable trait but is not determined by mitochondrial efficiency in zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>),"Jahn, Miki and Seebacher, Frank",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The energy used to move a given distance (cost of transport; CoT) varies significantly between individuals of the same species. A lower CoT allows animals to allocate more of their energy budget to growth and reproduction. A higher CoT may cause animals to adjust their movement across different environmental gradients to reduce energy allocated to movement The aim of this project was to determine whether CoT is a repeatable trait within individuals, and to determine its physiological causes and ecological consequences. We found that CoT is a repeatable trait in zebrafish (Danio redo). We rejected the hypothesis that mitochondrial efficiency (P/O ratios) predicted CoT. We also rejected the hypothesis that CoT is modulated by temperature acclimation, exercise training or their interaction, although CoT increased with increasing acute test temperature. There was a weak but significant negative correlation between CoT and dispersal, measured as the number of exploration decisions made by fish, and the distance travelled against the current in an artificial stream. However, CoT was not correlated with the voluntary speed of fish moving against the current. The implication of these results is that CoT reflects a fixed physiological phenotype of an individual, which is not plastic in response to persistent environmental changes. Consequently, individuals may have fundamentally different energy budgets as they move across environments, and may adjust movement patterns as a result of allocation trade-offs. It was surprising that mitochondrial efficiency did not explain differences in CoT, and our working hypothesis is that the energetics of muscle contraction and relaxation may determine CoT. The increase in CoT with increasing acute environmental temperature means that warming environments will increase the proportion of the energy budget allocated to locomotion unless individuals adjust their movement patterns.",2019,10.1242/jeb.201400,222,9,NA,jeb201400,Oxygen consumption; Temperature; Exercise; Locomotion; Acclimation; Allocation trade-off
article,Sirtuins regulate proteomic responses near thermal tolerance limits in the blue mussels <i>Mytilus galloprovincialis</i> and <i>Mytilus trossulus</i>,"Vasquez, M. Christina and Beam, Michelle and Blackwell, Shelley and Zuzow, Marcus J. and Tomanek, Lars",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The blue mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis and M. trossulus are competing species with biogeographical ranges set in part by environmental exposure to heat and hyposalinity. The underlying cellular mechanisms influencing interspecific differences in stress tolerance are unknown, but are believed to be under regulation by sirtuins, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+))-dependent deacylases that play a critical role in the cellular stress response. A comparison of the proteomic responses of M. galloprovincialis and M. trossulus to an acute heat shock in the presence and absence of the sirtuin inhibitor suramin (SIRT1, 2 and 5) showed that sirtuins affected molecular chaperones, oxidative stress proteins, metabolic enzymes, cytoskeletal and signaling proteins more in the heat-sensitive M. trossulus than in the heat-tolerant M. galloprovincialis. Interactions between sirtuin inhibition and changes in the abundance of proteins of beta-oxidation and oxidative stress in M. trossulus suggest a greater role of sirtuins in shifting metabolism to reduce the production of reactive oxygen species near thermal limits. Furthermore, RNA-binding proteins initiating and inhibiting translation were affected by suramin in M. galloprovincialis and M. trossulus, respectively. Western blot analysis showed that the levels of mitochondrial sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) were generally three times higher and increased with acute heat stress in response to sirtuin inhibition in M. trossulus but not in M. galloprovincialis, suggesting a possible feedback response in the former species and a greater reliance on SIRT5 for its stress response. Our findings suggest that SIRT5 plays an important role in setting interspecific differences in stress tolerance in Mytilus by affecting the stress proteome.",2017,10.1242/jeb.160325,220,23,4515-4534,NA,Acylation; beta-oxidation; Heat shock; Oxidative stress; RNA-binding proteins; Suramin; Proteomics
article,Flies developed small bodies and small cells in warm and in thermally fluctuating environments,"Czarnoleski, Marcin and Cooper, Brandon S. and Kierat, Justyna and Angilletta, Jr., Michael J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Although plasma membranes benefit cells by regulating the flux of materials to and from the environment, these membranes cost energy to maintain. Because smaller cells provide relatively more membrane area for transport, ectotherms that develop in warm environments should consist of small cells despite the energetic cost. Effects of constant temperatures on cell size qualitatively match this prediction, but effects of thermal fluctuations on cell size are unknown. Thermal fluctuations could favour either small or large cells; small cells facilitate transport during peaks in metabolic demand whereas large cells minimize the resources needed for homeoviscous adaptation. To explore this problem, we examined effects of thermal fluctuations during development on the size of epidermal cells in the wings of Drosophila melanogaster. Flies derived from a temperate population were raised at two mean temperatures (18 and 25 degrees C), with either no variation or a daily variation of +/- 4 degrees C. Flies developed faster at a mean temperature of 25 degrees C. Thermal fluctuations sped development, but only at 18 degrees C. An increase in the mean and variance of temperature caused flies to develop smaller cells and wings. Thermal fluctuations reduced the size of males at 18 degrees C and the size of females at 25 degrees C. The thorax, the wings and the cells decreased with an increase in the mean and in the variance of temperature, but the response of cells was the strongest. Based on this pattern, we hypothesize that development of the greater area of membranes under thermal fluctuations provides a metabolic advantage that outweighs the greater energetic cost of remodelling membranes.",2013,10.1242/jeb.083535,216,15,2896-2901,NA,body size; cell size; Drosophila melanogaster; homeoviscous adaptation; oxygen permeability; phenotypic plasticity; plasma membrane; thermal adaptation
article,Rapid decline of cold tolerance at young age is associated with expression of stress genes in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>,"Colinet, Herve and Siaussat, David and Bozzolan, Francoise and Bowler, Kenneth",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Many endogenous factors influence thermal tolerance of insects. Among these, age contributes an important source of variation. Heat tolerance is typically high in newly eclosed insects, before declining dramatically. It is not known whether this phenomenon relates to cold tolerance also. In addition, the underlying mechanisms of this variation are unresolved. In this study, we tested whether cold tolerance declines in Drosophila melanogaster females aged from 0 to 5. days. We also assessed whether expression (basal and induced) of eight stress genes (hsp22, hsp23, hsp40, hsp68, hsp70Aa, hsp83, Starvin and Frost) varied post-eclosion in correspondence with changes found in cold tolerance. We report that cold tolerance was very high at eclosion and then it rapidly declined in young flies. hsp23 and hsp68 showed a dramatic age-related variation of basal expression that was associated with cold tolerance proxies. Significant age-related plasticity of cold-induced expression was also found for hsp22, hsp23, hsp68, hsp70Aa, Frost and Starvin. Induced expression of hsp22 and hsp70Aa was high in newly enclosed phenotypes before declining dramatically, whilst opposite age-related patterns were found for hsp23, hsp68, Starvin and Frost. This study shows a marked within-stage variation in cold tolerance.

H. and Blasco, Felipe Rocco and Johansen, Jacob L. and Steffensen, John F. and Domenici, Paolo",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In intertidal environments, the recurring hypoxic condition at low tide is one of the main factors affecting fish behaviour, causing broad effects on ecological interactions. We assessed the effects of hypoxia on lateralization (e.g. the tendency to turn left or right), a behaviour related to brain functional asymmetry, which is thought to play a key role in several life history aspects of fish. Using staghorn sculpin (Leptocottus armatus), a benthic fish that typically inhabits the intertidal zone, we found that hypoxia affects behavioural lateralization at the population level. On average, staghorn sculpins showed a distinct preference for right turns under normoxic conditions (>90\% oxygen saturation), but an equal probability of turning right or left after exposure to hypoxia for 2 h (20\% oxygen saturation). The specific turning preference observed in the staghorn sculpin control population is likely to have an adaptive value, for example in predator-prey interactions by enhancing attack success or survival from predatory attacks. Therefore the alteration of lateralization expressed by staghorn sculpins under hypoxic conditions may have far-reaching implications for species ecology and trophic interactions. Moreover, our work raises the need to study this effect in other species, in which a hypoxia-driven disruption of lateralization could affect a wider range of behaviours, such as social interactions and schooling.",2014,10.1242/jeb.111229,217,23,4115-4118,NA,Hypoxia; Lateralization; Detour test; Staghorn sculpin

While a single biologging dataset can have the potential to test hypotheses spanning physiology, ecology, evolution and theoretical physics, explicit illustrations of this flexibility are scarce and this has arguably hindered the full realization of the power of biologging tools. Here we present a small set of examples from studies that have collected data on two parameters widespread in biologging research (depth and acceleration), but that have interpreted their data in the context of extremely diverse phenomena: from tests of biomechanical and diving-optimality models to identifications of feeding events, Levy flight foraging strategies and expanding oxygen minimum zones.

In a two-factorial experimental design, we investigated the long-term effect of daily flight training and the immediate effect of a short exercise bout on a set of haematological variables: haemoglobin (Hb) content, haematocrit (Het), and red blood cell number (RBCcount) and size (RBCarea) in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). For a period of 6 weeks, birds were either trained daily for 3 h in a flight arena or remained untrained. Subsequently, half of each group was blood sampled either in the resting condition or after a 5 min exercise bout in a flight-hover wheel. We found significantly lower Hb content, Hct and RBCcount compared with that in untrained controls in response to training, while RBCarea did not differ between treatments. Response to an exercise bout revealed the opposite pattern, with significantly higher Hb content and Hct compared with that in non-exercised birds. Additionally, RBCarea was significantly smaller immediately after exercise compared with that in non-exercised birds, and such short-term flexibility represents a novel finding for birds. This contrasting response in erythrocyte characteristics with respect to long-term training and short exercise bouts appears as a clear pattern, presumably underlain by changes in water balance. We infer alterations of blood flow to be involved in adequate oxygen supply. During an exercise bout, RBCarea flexibility may not only enhance oxygen delivery through improved erythrocyte surface area to volume ratio but also improve blood flow through a compensatory effect on blood viscosity.",2019,10.1242/jeb.193227,222,4,NA,jeb193227,Birds; Exercise training; Acute exercise; Aerobic flight activity; Red blood cell variables

C. and Thomson, Jack S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"As climate change -induced heatwaves become more common, phenotypic plasticity at multiple levels is a key mitigation strategy by which organisms can optimise selective outcomes. In ectotherms, changes to both metabolism and behaviour can help alleviate thermal stress. Nonetheless, no study in any ectotherm has yet empirically investigated how changing temperatures affect among -individual differences in the associations between these traits. Using the beadlet anemone (Actinia equina), an intertidal species from a thermally heterogeneous environment, we investigated how individual metabolic rates, linked to morphotypic differences in A. equina, and boldness were related across changing temperatures. A crossed -over design and a temporal control were used to test the same individuals at a non -stressful temperature, 13 degrees C, and under a simulated heatwave at 21 degrees C. At each temperature, short-term repeated measurements of routine metabolic rate (RMR) and a single measurement of a repeatable boldness -related behaviour, immersion response time (IRT), were made. Individual differences, but not morphotypic differences, were highly predictive of metabolic plasticity, and the plasticity of RMR was associated with IRT. At 13 degrees C, shy animals had the highest metabolic rates, while at 21 degrees C, this relationship was reversed. Individuals that were bold at 13 degrees C also exhibited the highest metabolic rates at 21 degrees C. Additional metabolic challenges during heatwaves could be detrimental to fitness in bold individuals. Equally, lower metabolic rates at non -stressful temperatures could be necessary for optimal survival as heatwaves become more common. These results provide novel insight into the relationship between metabolic and behavioural plasticity, and its adaptive implications in a changing climate.",2024,10.1242/jeb.244662,227,3,NA,jeb244662,Climate change; Boldness; Metabolism; Pace of life; Marine invertebrate

To discern the cardiophysiological adjustments that permit this behaviour, we quantified the effect of acclimation from 15 degrees C to 5 degrees C in normoxia (15N and 5N fish), as well as chronic hypoxic submergence (6-8 weeks; similar to 6.3-8.4 kPa; no air access) at 5 degrees C (5H fish), on in vivo and spontaneous heart rate (f(H)), electrocardiogram, ventricular action potential (AP) shape and duration (APD), the background inward rectifier (I-K1) and rapid delayed rectifier (I-Kr) K+ currents and ventricular gene expression of proteins involved in excitation-contraction coupling. In vivo f(H) was similar to 50\% slower in 5N than in 15N fish, but 5H fish did not display hypoxic bradycardia. Atypically, cold acclimation in normoxia did not induce shortening of APD or alter resting membrane potential. Rather, QT interval and APD were similar to 2.6-fold longer in 5N than in 15N fish because outward I-K1 and I-Kr were not upregulated in 5N fish. By contrast, chronic hypoxic submergence elicited a shortening of QT interval and APD, driven by an upregulation of I-Kr. The altered electrophysiology of 5H fish was accompanied by increased gene expression of kcnh6 (3.5-fold; K(v)11.2 of I-Kr), kcnj12 (7.4-fold; K(ir)2.2 of I-K1) and kcnj14 (2.9-fold; K(ir)2.4 of I-K1). 5H fish also exhibited a unique gene expression pattern that suggests modification of ventricular Ca2+ cycling.

article,Drinking made easier: honey bee tongues dip faster into warmer and/or less viscous artificial nectar,"Shi, Lianhui and Nicolson, Susan W. and Yang, Yunqiang and Wu, Jianing and Yan, Shaoze and Wu, Zhigang",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Optimal concentrations for nectar drinking are limited by the steep increase in the viscosity of sugar solutions with concentration. However, nectar viscosity is inversely related to temperature, which suggests there are advantages to foraging from flowers that are warmer than the surrounding air. The honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) dips nectar using a hairy tongue. However, the microscopic dynamics of the tongue while the bee ingests nectar of varying concentration, viscosity and temperature are unknown. In this study, we found that honey bees respond to the variation of nectar properties by regulating dipping frequency. Through high-speed imaging, we discovered that the honey bee traps warmer sucrose solutions with a quicker tongue. The honey bee dips the warmest and most dilute solution (40 degrees C and 25\% w/w sucrose) 1.57 times as fast as the coldest and thickest solution (20 degrees C and 45\% w/w sucrose). When the viscosity of different sucrose concentrations was kept constant by adding the inert polysaccharide Tylose, honey bees dipped nectar at constant frequency. We propose a fluid mechanism model to elucidate potential effects on sucrose intake and show that higher dipping frequency can increase the volumetric and energetic intake rates by 125\% and 15\%, respectively. Our findings broaden insights into how honey bees adapt to foraging constraints from the perspective of tongue dynamics, and demonstrate that elevated intrafloral temperatures and lower nectar viscosity can improve the volumetric and energetic intake rates of pollinators.",2020,10.1242/jeb.229799,223,18,NA,jeb229799,Pollinator; Apis mellifera; Temperature; Viscosity; Dipping frequency

article,Cold acclimation improves chill tolerance in the migratory locust through preservation of ion balance and membrane potential,"Andersen, Mads Kuhlmann and Folkersen, Rasmus and MacMillan, Heath A. and Overgaard, Johannes",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Most insects have the ability to alter their cold tolerance in response to temporal temperature fluctuations, and recent studies have shown that insect cold tolerance is closely tied to the ability to maintain transmembrane ion gradients that are important for the maintenance of cell membrane potential (V-m). Several studies have therefore suggested a link between preservation of V-m and cellular survival after cold stress, but none has measured V-m in this context. We tested this hypothesis by acclimating locusts (Locusta migratoria) to high (31 degrees C) and low temperature (11 degrees C) for 4 days before exposing them to cold stress (0 degrees C) for up to 48 h and subsequently measuring ion balance, cell survival, muscle V-m, and whole animal performance. Cold stress caused gradual muscle cell death, which coincided with a loss of ion balance and depolarization of muscle V-m. The loss of ion balance and cell polarization were, however, dampened markedly in cold-acclimated locusts such that the development of chill injury was reduced. To further examine the association between cellular injury and V-m we exposed in vitro muscle preparations to cold buffers with low, intermediate, or high {[}K+]. These experiments revealed that cellular injury during cold exposure occurs when V-m becomes severely depolarized. Interestingly, we found that cellular sensitivity to hypothermic hyperkalaemia was lower in cold-acclimated locusts that were better able to defend V-m whilst exposed to high extracellular {[}K+]. Together these results demonstrate a mechanism of cold acclimation in locusts that improves survival after cold stress: increased cold tolerance is accomplished by preservation of V-m through maintenance of ion homeostasis and decreased K+ sensitivity.",2017,10.1242/jeb.150813,220,3,487-496,NA,Cold resistance; Cold stress; Ion homeostasis; Membrane polarization; Chilling injury; Locusta migratoria

To fill this gap, we used the marine polychaete Ophryotrocha labronica to investigate the influence of maternal temperature on offspring upper and lower thermal tolerance limits, and assess whether maternal influence changed according to the stage of offspring pre-zygotic development at which a thermal cue was provided. Measurements were taken on adult offspring acclimated to 18 or 30 degrees C, produced by mothers previously reared at 24 degrees C and then exposed to 18 or 30 degrees C at an early and late stage of oogenesis. When the shift from 24 degrees C was provided early during oogenesis, mothers produced offspring with greater cold and heat tolerance whenever mother-offspring temperatures did not match, with respect to when they matched, suggesting the presence of an anticipatory maternal effect triggered by the thermal variation. Conversely, when the cue was provided later during oogenesis, more tolerant offspring were observed when temperatures persisted across generations. In this case, maternal exposure to 18 or 30 degrees C may have benefited offspring performance, while limitations in the transmission of the thermal cue may account for the lack of correlation between maternal experiences and offspring performance when mother-offspring environments did not match. Our results provided evidence for a trans-generational effect of temperature on physiological performance characterised by a high context dependency, and are discussed in the light of maternal pre-reproductive experiences.",2014,10.1242/jeb.094474,217,11,2004-2012,NA,Ectotherms; Maternal effects; Oogenesis; Polychaetes; Thermal tolerance limits

article,Limits to sustained energy intake. XXVIII. Beneficial effects of high dietary fat on lactation performance in mice,"Kagya-Agyemang, James K. and Vaanholt, Lobke M. and Hambly, Catherine and Krol, Elzbieta and Mitchell, Sharon E. and Speakman, John R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Maximal animal performance may be limited by the ability of an animal to dissipate heat: the heat dissipation limitation (HDL) theory. Because the incidental heat produced during digestion {[}specific dynamic action (SDA)] varies among diets, the HDL theory predicts that lactating female mice consuming diets with lower SDA should have increased reproductive performance. Dietary fat has a lower SDA than dietary carbohydrate. Female mice were fed low (LF), medium (MF) or high (HF) fat diets (10, 45 and 60\% energy from fat, respectively) from days 4-18 of lactation. HF- and MF-fed mice weaned significantly heavier litters than LF mice. This was because they not only consumed more energy {[}metabolisable energy intake (E-mei); HF: 306.5 +/- 25.0, MF: 340.5 +/- 13.5 kJ day(-1)] at peak lactation. but also delivered more milk energy to their pups {[}milk energy output (E-milk); HF: 203.2 +/- 49.9, MF 229.3 +/- 42.2 kJ day(-1)] than the LF-fed mice (E-mei =266.7 +/- 4.5, E-milk =164.60 +/- 30.59 kJ day(-1)). A mathematical model based on the predictions from the HDL theory showed that this effect was greater than predicted from differences in SDA between the diets. Fatty acid profiles of the diets, milk and pups showed significant correlations between the profiles. Besides reduced SDA, HF- and MF-fed mice were probably able to directly transfer absorbed dietary fat into milk, reducing the heat production of lactogenesis and enabling them to perform better than expected from the HDL model. In summary, HF and MF diets had beneficial effects on reproductive performance compared with the LF diet because they enabled mice to generate milk more efficiently with less incidental heat production.",2018,10.1242/jeb.180828,221,16,NA,jeb180828,Central and peripheral limits; Heat dissipation limit; Dietary fat; Asymptotic food intake; Digestibility; Lactation performance; Laboratory mouse

In the CTSmax protocol, warming caused a profound increase in the rate of oxygen uptake (M?O2), culminating in a gait transition from steady aerobic towards unsteady anaerobic swimming, then fatigue at 30.3 \& PLUSMN;0.4 \& DEG;C (mean \& PLUSMN;s.e.m.). Gait transition and fatigue presumably indicate an oxygen limitation, which reflects the inability to meet the combined demands of swimming plus warming. The CTmax protocol also elicited an increase in M?O2, culminating in LOE at 34.0 \& PLUSMN;0.4 \& DEG;C, which is significantly warmer than fatigue at CTSmax. The maximum M?O2 achieved in the CTmax protocol was, however, less than 30\% of that achieved in the CTSmax protocol. Therefore, the static CTmax did not exploit full cardiorespiratory capacity for oxygen supply, indicating that LOE was not caused by systemic oxygen limitation. Consequently, systemic oxygen supply can be significant for tolerance of acute warming in seabass but this depends upon the physiological context and the endpoint used.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245210,226,11,NA,jeb245210,Critical thermal maximum; Fish; Oxygen uptake; Swimming
article,Suppression of reactive oxygen species generation in heart mitochondria from anoxic turtles: the role of complex I <i>S</i>-nitrosation,"Bundgaard, Amanda and James, Andrew M. and Joyce, William and Murphy, Michael P. and Fago, Angela",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Freshwater turtles (Trachemys scripta) are among the very few vertebrates capable of tolerating severe hypoxia and re-oxygenation without suffering from damage to the heart. As myocardial ischemia and reperfusion causes a burst of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mammals, the question arises as to whether, and if so how, this ROS burst is prevented in the turtle heart. We find that heart mitochondria isolated from turtles acclimated to anoxia produce less ROS than mitochondria from normoxic turtles when consuming succinate. As succinate accumulates in the hypoxic heart and is oxidized when oxygen returns, this suggests an adaptation to lessen ROS production. Specific S-nitrosation of complex I can lower ROS in mammals and here we show that turtle complex I activity and ROS production can also be strongly depressed in vitro by S-nitrosation. We detect in vivo endogenous S-nitrosated complex I in turtle heart mitochondria, but these levels are unaffected upon anoxia acclimation. Thus, while heart mitochondria from anoxia-acclimated turtles generate less ROS and have a lower aerobic capacity than those from normoxic turtles, this is not due to decreases in complex I activity or expression levels. Interestingly, in-gel activity staining reveals that most complex I of heart mitochondria from normoxic and anoxic turtles forms stable super-complexes with other respiratory enzymes and, in contrast to mammals, these are not disrupted by dodecyl maltoside. Taken together, these results show that although S-nitrosation of complex I is a potent mechanism to prevent ROS formation upon re-oxygenation after anoxia in vitro, this is not a major cause of the suppression of ROS production by anoxic turtle heart mitochondria.",2018,10.1242/jeb.174391,221,8,NA,jeb174391,Anoxia; Respiration; Complex I; S-nitrosation; Mitochondria; Reactive oxygen species

If these challenges are not overcome quickly, the stressed organism can die. To better understand the earliest tissue-level responses to heat stress, we examined the proteomic response of gill from Geukensia demissa, an extremely eurythermal mussel from the temperate intertidal zone of eastern North America. We exposed 15 degrees C-acclimated individuals to an acute near-lethal heat stress (45 degrees C) for 1 h, and collected gill samples from 0 to 24 h of recovery. The changes in protein expression we found reveal a coordinated physiological response to acute heat stress: proteins associated with apoptotic processes were increased in abundance during the stress itself (i.e. at 0 h of recovery), while protein chaperones and foldases increased in abundance soon after (3 h). The greatest number of proteins changed abundance at 6 h; these included oxidative stress proteins and enzymes of energy metabolism. Proteins associated with the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix also changed in abundance starting at 6 h, providing evidence of cell proliferation, migration and tissue remodeling. By 12 h, the response to acute heat stress was diminishing, with fewer stress and structural proteins changing in abundance. Finally, the proteins with altered abundances identified at 24 h suggest a return to the pre-stress anabolic state.",2016,10.1242/jeb.141176,219,17,2673-2686,NA,Acute heat stress; Apoptosis; Geukensia demissa; Intertidal zone; Oxidative stress; Proteomics

Increasing temperatures in particular can affect mitochondrial bioenergetics and rates of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Our aim was to test whether different rates of temperature increase affect mitochondrial bioenergetics and modulate oxidative stress. We exposed zebrafish (Danio rerio) to warming from 20 degrees C to 28 degrees C over 3, 6, 24 or 48 h, and compared these with a control group that was kept at constant 20 degrees C. Fish exposed to the fastest (3 h) and slowest (48 h) rates of warming had significantly higher rates of H2O2 production relative to the control treatment, and the proportion of O-2 converted to H2O2 (H2O2/O-2 ratio) was significantly greater in these groups. However, ROS production was not paralleled by differences in mitochondria! substrate oxidation rates, leak respiration rates or coupling (respiratory control ratios). Increased rates of ROS production did not lead to damage of proteins or membranes, which may be explained by a moderate increase in catalase activity at the fastest, but not the slowest, rate of warming. The increase in ROS production at the slowest rate of warming indicates that even seemingly benign environments may be stressful. Understanding how animals respond to different rates of temperature change is important, because the rate determines the time period for phenotypic adjustments and it also alters the environmental thermal signal that triggers compensatory pathways.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243740,225,6,NA,jeb243740,Mitochondria; Temperature; Reactive oxygen species; Catalase; Oxidative damage; Respiratory control ratio

We investigated the effects of acute H/R stress (15 min at similar to 0\% O-2 and 10 min reoxygenation) on isolated mitochondria from the gill and the digestive gland of C. gigas respiring on different substrates (pyruvate, glutamate, succinate, palmitate and their mixtures). Gill mitochondria showed better capacity for amino acid and fatty acid oxidation compared with mitochondria from the digestive gland. Mitochondrial responses to H/R stress strongly depended on the substrate and the activity state of mitochondria. In mitochondria oxidizing NADH-linked substrates, exposure to H/R stress suppressed oxygen consumption and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the resting state, whereas in the ADP-stimulated state, ROS production increased despite little change in respiration. As a result, electron leak (measured as H2O2 to O-2 ratio) increased after H/R stress in the ADP-stimulated mitochondria with NADH-linked substrates. In contrast, H/R exposure stimulated succinate-driven respiration without an increase in electron leak. Reverse electron transport (RET) did not significantly contribute to succinate-driven ROS production in oyster mitochondria except for a slight increase in the OXPHOS state during post-hypoxic recovery. A decrease in NADH-driven respiration and ROS production, enhanced capacity for succinate oxidation and resistance to RET might assist in post-hypoxic recovery of oysters mitigating oxidative stress and supporting rapid ATP re-synthesis during oxygen fluctuations, as is commonly observed in estuaries and intertidal zones.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243304,225,1,NA,jeb243304,Mollusks; Mitochondria; Bioenergetics; Oxidative stress; Metabolism; Reverse electron transport
article,Reproductive fitness of <i>Drosophila</i> is maximised by optimal developmental temperature,"Klepsatel, Peter and Girish, Thirnahalli Nagaraj and Dircksen, Heinrich and Galikova, Martina",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Whether the character of developmental plasticity is adaptive or non-adaptive has often been a matter of controversy. Although thermal developmental plasticity has been studied in Drosophila for several traits, it is not entirely clear how it affects reproductive fitness. We, therefore, investigated how developmental temperature affects reproductive performance (early fecundity and egg-to-adult viability) of wild-caught Drosophila melanogaster. We tested competing hypotheses on the character of developmental thermal plasticity using a full-factorial design with three developmental and adulthood temperatures within the natural thermal range of this species. To account for potential intraspecific differences, we examined flies from tropical (India) and temperate (Slovakia) climate zones. Our results show that flies from both populations raised at an intermediate developmental temperature (25 degrees C) have comparable or higher early fecundity and fertility at all tested adulthood temperatures, while lower (17 degrees C) or higher developmental temperatures (29 degrees C) did not entail any advantage under the tested thermal regimes. Importantly, the superior thermal performance of flies raised at 25 degrees C is apparent even after taking two traits positively associated with reproductive output into account: body size and ovariole number. Thus, in D. melanogaster, development at a given temperature does not necessarily provide any advantage in this thermal environment in terms of reproductive fitness. Our findings strongly support the optimal developmental temperature hypothesis, which states that in different thermal environments, the highest fitness is achieved when an organism is raised at its optimal developmental temperature.",2019,10.1242/jeb.202184,222,10,NA,jeb202184,Developmental plasticity; Acclimation; Thermal performance; Fecundity; Viability; Ovariole number; Body size

Turtles were subjected to hypothermia using a cooling followed by freezing protocol. Body temperature measurements ranged between -1 and -2 degrees C while core body temperature was -1 degrees C. Ice crystal formation was never observed. A protective reflex to noxious stimuli, the eyeblink response, was recorded from in vitro brainstem preparations subjected to cold. At 5-6 degrees C, reflex responses were suppressed, demonstrating minimal synaptic transmission in brain circuits above temperatures used for hypothermia induction.

These hematological traits often differ between taxa that are native to different elevational zones, but it is often unknown whether the observed physiological differences reflect fixed, genetically based differences or environmentally induced acclimatization responses (phenotypic plasticity). Here, we report measurements of hematological traits related to blood-O-2 transport in populations of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) that are native to high- and low-altitude environments. We conducted a common-garden breeding experiment to assess whether altitude-related physiological differences were attributable to developmental plasticity and/or physiological plasticity during adulthood. Under conditions prevailing in their native habitats, high-altitude deer mice from the Rocky Mountains exhibited a number of pronounced hematological differences relative to low-altitude conspecifics from the Great Plains: higher hemoglobin concentrations, higher hematocrits, higher erythrocytic concentrations of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (an allosteric regulator of hemoglobin-oxygen affinity), lower mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentrations and smaller red blood cells. However, these differences disappeared after 6. weeks of acclimation to normoxia at low altitude. The measured traits were also indistinguishable between the F-1 progeny of highland and lowland mice, indicating that there were no persistent differences in phenotype that could be attributed to developmental plasticity. These results indicate that the naturally occurring hematological differences between highland and lowland mice are environmentally induced and are largely attributable to physiological plasticity during adulthood.",2013,10.1242/jeb.079848,216,7,1167-1173,NA,physiological plasticity; high altitude; hemoglobin; hematocrit; hypoxia; Peromyscus maniculatus; red blood cell

Since the strike is produced by a latch-mediated spring-actuated system and not directly driven by muscle action, we predicted that strikes performed in air would be faster than underwater as a result of reduction in the medium's drag. Using high-speed video analysis of stereotyped strikes elicited from Squilla mantis, we found the exact opposite: strikes are much slower and less powerful in air than in water. S. mantis strikes in air have a similar mass and performance to latch-mediated spring-actuated jumps in locusts, suggesting a potential threshold for the energetics of a 1-2 g limb rotating in air.

For the study, 16 male Wistar rats, chow-fed and kept under standard laboratory conditions, were divided into 2 equal groups. The rats from a control group drank tap water, whereas those from a sucrose overfed group were allowed to drink 10\% sucrose solution for 21 days. Structural changes of BAT were analysed at the level of light and electron microscopy on routinely prepared tissue sections or using immunohistochemical staining, in combination with stereological methods. Obtained results have shown that the significantly increased energy intake in sucrose overfed rats did not result in a higher gain of body mass compared with controls. The light microscopy analysis revealed that the BAT acquired the appearance of a thermogenically active tissue, with intensified vascularisation, reduced size of brown adipocytes and increased multilocularity. At the ultrastructural level, mitochondria of brown adipocytes became more abundant, enlarged and contained more cristae in comparison to control animals. The immunoexpression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and noradrenaline, as markers of BAT thermogenic status, was increased, whereas the pattern of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1 alpha) was slightly modified. Taken together, the results of this investigation indicated that BAT possesses the ability to increase thermogenic capacity/activity in response to high energy intake and to prevent body mass gain. These findings are particularly relevant in view of recent reports on the existence of functional BAT in adult humans and its potential use to combat obesity.",2018,10.1242/jeb.166538,221,9,NA,jeb166538,Brown adipose tissue; Rat; Sucrose overfeeding; Immunohistochemistry; Ultrastructure

We investigated whether genetic variants in haemoglobin (Hb) that contribute to high-altitude adaptation in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) are associated with evolved changes in the control of breathing. We created F-2 inter-population hybrids of highland and lowland deer mice to test for phenotypic associations of alpha- and beta-globin variants on a mixed genetic background. Hb genotype had expected effects on Hb-O-2 affinity that were associated with differences in arterial O-2 saturation in hypoxia. However, high-altitude genotypes were also associated with breathing phenotypes that should contribute to enhancing O-2 uptake in hypoxia. Mice with highland alpha-globin exhibited a more effective breathing pattern, with highland homozygotes breathing deeper but less frequently across a range of inspired O-2, and this difference was comparable to the evolved changes in breathing pattern in deer mouse populations native to high altitude. The ventilatory response to hypoxia was augmented in mice that were homozygous for highland beta-globin. The association of globin variants with variation in breathing phenotypes could not be recapitulated by acute manipulation of Hb-O-2 affinity, because treatment with efaproxiral (a synthetic drug that acutely reduces Hb-O-2 affinity) had no effect on breathing in normoxia or hypoxia. Therefore, adaptive variation in Hb may have unexpected effects on physiology in addition to the canonical function of this protein in circulatory O-2 transport.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243595,225,2,NA,jeb243595,Evolutionary physiology; Hypoxia acclimation; Pulmonary ventilation; Ventilatory acclimatization to hypoxia
article,Naked mole-rats reduce the expression of ATP-dependent but not ATP-independent heat shock proteins in acute hypoxia,"Vu Chau Nguyen and Deck, Courtney A. and Pamenter, Matthew E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Naked mole-rats are one of the most hypoxia-tolerant mammals identified, and putatively experience intermittent and severe hypoxia in their underground burrows. Systemic physiological adaptions to hypoxia have begun to be investigated in this species; however, the cellular adaptations that underlie this tolerance remain poorly understood. Hypoxia compromises cellular energy production, and the maintenance of protein integrity when ATP generation is limited poses a major challenge. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are cellular chaperones that are cytoprotective during hypoxia, and we hypothesized that their expression would increase during acute hypoxia in naked mole-rats. To test this hypothesis, we used qPCR and western blot approaches to measure changes in gene and protein expression, respectively, of HSP27, HSP40, HSP70 and HSP90 in the brain, heart, liver and temporalis muscle from naked mole-rats following exposure to normoxia (21\% O-2) or hypoxia (7\% O-2 for 4, 12 or 24 h). Contrary to our expectations, we observed significant global reductions of ATP-dependent HSP70 and HSP90 (83\% and 78\%, respectively) after 24 h of hypoxia. Conversely, the expression of ATP-independent HSP27 and HSP40 proteins remained constant throughout the 24-h hypoxic treatment in brain, heart and muscle. However, with prolonged hypoxia (24 h), the expression of Hsp27 and Hsp40 genes in these tissues was also reduced, suggesting that the protein expression of these chaperones may also eventually decrease in hypoxia. These results suggest that energy conservation is prioritized over cytoprotective protein chaperoning in nakedmole-rat tissues during acute hypoxia. This unique adaptation may help naked mole-rats to minimize energy expenditure while still maintaining proteostasis in hypoxia.",2019,10.1242/jeb.211243,222,22,NA,jeb211243,Molecular chaperone; Proteostasis; Metabolic rate suppression; Unfolded protein response
article,Central nervous system shutdown underlies acute cold tolerance in tropical and temperate <i>Drosophila</i> species,"Andersen, Mads Kuhlmann and Jensen, Nikolaj Johannes Skole and Robertson, R. Meldrum and Overgaard, Johannes",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"When cooled, insects first lose their ability to perform coordinated movements (CTmin) after which they enter chill coma (chill coma onset, CCO). Both these behaviours are popular measures of cold tolerance that correlate remarkably well with species distribution. To identify and understand the neuromuscular impairment that causes CTmin and CCO we used inter- and intraspecific model systems of Drosophila species that have varying cold tolerance as a consequence of adaptation or cold acclimation. Our results demonstrate that CTmin and CCO correlate strongly with a spreading depolarization (SD) within the central nervous system (CNS). We show that this SD is associated with a rapid increase in extracellular {[}K+] within the CNS causing neuronal depolarization that silences the CNS. The CNS shutdown is likely to be caused by a mismatch between passive and active ion transport within the CNS and in a different set of experiments we examine inter- and intraspecific differences in sensitivity to SD events during anoxic exposure. These experiments show that cold adapted or acclimated flies are better able to maintain ionoregulatory balance when active transport is compromised within the CNS. Combined, we demonstrate that a key mechanism underlying chill coma entry of Drosophila is CNS shutdown, and the ability to prevent this CNS shutdown is therefore an important component of acute cold tolerance, thermal adaptation and cold acclimation in insects.",2018,10.1242/jeb.179598,221,12,NA,jeb179598,CNS; Spreading depression; Ion balance; Chill coma; Chill tolerance; CTmin

N. and Mahalingam, Sajeni and Borowiec, Brittney G. and Scott, Graham R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Many fish encounter hypoxia in their native environment, but the role of mitochondrial physiology in hypoxia acclimation and hypoxia tolerance is poorly understood. We investigated the effects of hypoxia acclimation on mitochondrial respiration, O-2 kinetics, emission of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and antioxidant capacity in the estuarine killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus). Killifish were acclimated to normoxia, constant hypoxia (5 kPa O-2) or intermittent diel cycles of nocturnal hypoxia (12 h: 12 h normoxia: hypoxia) for 28-33 days and mitochondria were isolated from liver. Neither pattern of hypoxia acclimation affected the respiratory capacities for oxidative phosphorylation or electron transport, leak respiration, coupling control or phosphorylation efficiency. Hypoxia acclimation also had no effect on mitochondrial O-2 kinetics, but P-50 (the O2 tension at which hypoxia inhibits respiration by 50\%) was lower in the leak state than during maximal respiration, and killifish mitochondria endured anoxia-reoxygenation without any impact on mitochondrial respiration. However, both patterns of hypoxia acclimation reduced the rate of ROS emission from mitochondria when compared at a common O-2 tension. Hypoxia acclimation also increased the levels of protein carbonyls and the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase in liver tissue (the latter only occurred in constant hypoxia).

To determine whether changes in mitochondrial properties could underlie shifts in thermal limits, we examined how mitochondrial properties are affected by thermal acclimation in the eurythermal killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus - a species with substantial plasticity in whole-organism thermal limits. We hypothesized that thermal acclimation would result in functional changes in the mitochondria that could result in trade-offs in function during acute thermal shifts. We measured the mitochondrial respiration rate ((V)over dot(O2)) through multiple complexes of the electron transport system following thermal acclimation (to 5, 15, 33 degrees C) and assessed maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta p) and rates of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production as an estimate of costs. Acclimation to 5 degrees C resulted in a modest compensation of mitochondrial respiration at low temperatures, but these mitochondria were able to maintain Delta p with acute exposure to high temperatures, and ROS production did not differ between acclimation groups, suggesting that these increases in mitochondrial capacity do not alter mitochondrial thermal sensitivity. Acclimation to 33 degrees C suppressed mitochondrial respiration as a result of effects on NADH dehydrogenase (complex I). These high-temperature acclimated fish nonetheless maintained levels of Delta p and ROS production similar to those of the other acclimation groups. This work demonstrates that killifish mitochondria can successfully acclimate to a wide range of temperatures without incurring major functional trade-offs during acute thermal shifts and that high-temperature acclimation results in a suppression of metabolism, consistent with patterns observed at the organismal level.",2015,10.1242/jeb.120444,218,11,1621-1631,NA,Mitochondria; Thermal acclimation; ROS; Proton leak kinetics; Killifish; Ectotherm

Developmental variation in environmentally sensitive performance, and thermal sensitivity in particular, has been well documented in holometabolous insects. For example, thermal performance in adults and juvenile stages exhibit little genetic correlation ( genetic decoupling) and can evolve independently, resulting in divergent thermal responses. Yet, we understand very little about how this genetic decoupling occurs. We tested the hypothesis that genetic decoupling of thermal physiology is driven by fundamental differences in physiology between life stages, despite a potentially conserved cellular stress response. We used RNAseq to compare transcript expression in response to a cold stressor in Drosophila melanogaster larvae and adults and used RNA interference (RNAi) to test whether knocking down nine target genes differentially affected larval and adult cold tolerance. Transcriptomic responses of whole larvae and adults during and following exposure to -5 degrees C were largely unique both in identity of responding transcripts and in temporal dynamics. Further, we analyzed the tissue-specificity of differentially expressed transcripts from FlyAtlas 2 data, and concluded that stage-specific differences in transcription were not simply driven by differences in tissue composition. In addition, RNAi of target genes resulted in largely stage-specific and sometimes sex-specific effects on cold tolerance. The combined evidence suggests that thermal physiology is largely stage-specific at the level of gene expression, and thus natural selection may be acting on different loci during the independent thermal adaptation of different life stages.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244063,225,11,NA,jeb244063,Adaptive decoupling; Thermal physiology; Cold stress; Gene expression; RNAi

Here, we studied the stress-induced activation of p53 in anoxic crayfish (Faxonius virilis). Relative levels of target proteins and mRNAs involved in the DNA damage response were measured in normoxic control and anoxic hepatopancreas and tail muscle. Phosphorylation levels of p53 were assessed using immunoblotting at sites known to be phosphorylated (serine 15 and 37) in response to DNA damage or reduced oxygen signaling. The capacity for DNA binding by phosphorylated p53 (p-p53) was also measured, followed by transcript analysis of a potentially pro-apoptotic downstream target, the etoposide induced (ei24) gene. Following this, both inhibitor (MDM2) and activator (p19-ARF) protein levels in response to low-oxygen stress were studied. The results showed an increase in p-p53 levels during anoxia in both hepatopancreas and tail muscle. Increased transcript levels of ei24 support the activation of p53 under anoxic stress. Cytoplasmic accumulation of Ser15 phosphorylated p53 was observed during anoxia when proteins from cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were measured. Increased cytoplasmic concentration is known to initiate an apoptotic response, which can be assumed as a preparatory step to prevent autophagy. The results suggest that p53 might play a protective role in crayfish defense against low-oxygen stress.

During the transition to ex ovo life, thyroid hormone levels naturally increase, peaking at hatching, and then decline. To better understand the role of the natural increase in thyroid hormone at hatching in regulating the developmental trajectory of the Pekin duck's endothermic phenotype, we examined development of O-2 consumption (<(V)over dot>(O2)) and ventilation (frequency, tidal volume and minute ventilation) while inhibiting the developmental increase in thyroid hormones that occurs at hatching via administration of the thyroid-peroxidase inhibitor methimazole (MMI) or accelerating the developmental increase via triiodothyronine (T-3) supplementation. Animals were dosed only on day 24 of a 28-day incubation period and studied on incubation day 25, during external pipping (EP) and 1 day post-hatching (dph). On day 25, there was an increase in <(V)over dot>(O2) in the hyperthyroid treatment compared with the other two treatments. During the EP stage, there was a significant effect of thyroid status on <(V)over dot>(O2), with hyperthyroid <(V)over dot>(O2) being highest and hypothyroid <(V)over dot>(O2) the lowest. By 1 dph, the supplemented T-3 and control animals had similar <(V)over dot>(O2) responses to cooling with comparable thermal neutral zones followed by increased <(V)over dot>(O2). Hypothyroid 1 dph hatchlings had a lower resting <(V)over dot>(O2) that did not increase to the same extent as the supplemented T-3 and control animals during cooling. During EP, inhibiting the rise in T-3 resulted in embryos with lower ventilation frequency and tidal volume than control and supplemented T-3 embryos. At 1 dph, ventilation frequency of all animals increased during cooling, but tidal volume only increased in supplemented T-3 and control hatchlings. Our data support the role of the late incubation increase in T-3 in regulating the systemic development of endothermic metabolic capacity and associated control of ventilation occurring at hatching of the Pekin duck.",2020,10.1242/jeb.237701,223,22,NA,jeb237701,Development of endothermy; Metabolism; Triiodothyronine; Ventilation development
article,Intracapsular algae provide fixed carbon to developing embryos of the salamander <i>Ambystoma maculatum</i>,"Graham, Erin R. and Fay, Scott A. and Davey, Adam and Sanders, Robert W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Each spring, North American spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) females each lay hundreds of eggs in shallow pools of water. Eggs are surrounded by jelly layers and are deposited as large gelatinous masses. Following deposition, masses are penetrated by a mutualistic green alga, Oophila amblystomatis, which enters individual egg capsules, proliferates and aggregates near the salamander embryo, providing oxygen that enhances development. We examined the effects of population density of intracapsular O. amblystomatis on A. maculatum embryos and show that larger algal populations promote faster embryonic growth and development. Also, we show that carbon fixed by O. amblystomatis is transferred to the embryos, providing the first evidence of direct translocation of photosynthate from a symbiont to a vertebrate host.",2013,10.1242/jeb.076711,216,3,452-459,NA,Oophila amblystomatis; Ambystoma maculatum; algae; salamander; carbon translocation; symbiosis

C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Understanding how tropical corals respond to temperatures is important to evaluating their capacity to persist in a warmer future. We studied the common Pacific coral Pocillopora over 44 degrees of latitude, and used populations at three islands with different thermal regimes to compare their responses to temperature using thermal performance curves (TPCs) for respiration and gross photosynthesis. Corals were sampled in the local autumn from Moorea, Guam and Okinawa, where mean +/- s.d. annual seawater temperature is 28.0 +/- 0.9 degrees C, 28.9 +/- 0.7 degrees C and 25.1 +/- 3.4 degrees C, respectively. TPCs for respiration were similar among latitudes, the thermal optimum ( T opt ) was above the local maximum temperature at all three islands, and maximum respiration was lowest at Okinawa. TPCs for gross photosynthesis were wider, implying greater thermal eurytopy, with a higher T opt in Moorea versus Guam and Okinawa. T opt was above the maximum temperature in Moorea, but was similar to daily temperatures over 13\% of the year in Okinawa and 53\% of the year in Guam. There was greater annual variation in daily temperatures in Okinawa than Guam or Moorea, which translated to large variation in the supply of metabolic energy and photosynthetically fixed carbon at higher latitudes. Despite these trends, the differences in TPCs for Pocillopora spp. were not profoundly different across latitudes, reducing the likelihood that populations of these corals could better match their phenotypes to future more extreme temperatures through migration. Any such response would place a premium on high metabolic plasticity and tolerance of large seasonal variations in energy budgets.",2024,10.1242/jeb.247090,227,11,NA,jeb247090,Pacific; Scleractinia; TPC; Climate change; Metabolism
article,Tolerance of aquifer stoneflies to repeated hypoxia exposure and oxygen dynamics in an alluvial aquifer,"Malison, Rachel L. and DelVecchia, Amanda G. and Woods, H. Arthur and Hand, Brian K. and Luikart, Gordon and Stanford, Jack A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Aquatic insects cope with hypoxia and anoxia using a variety of behavioral and physiological responses. Most stoneflies (Plecoptera) occur in highly oxygenated surface waters, but some species live underground in alluvial aquifers containing heterogeneous oxygen concentrations. Aquifer stoneflies appear to be supported by methane-derived food resources, which they may exploit using anoxia-resistant behaviors. We documented dissolved oxygen dynamics and collected stoneflies over 5 years in floodplain wells of the Flathead River, Montana. Hypoxia regularly occurred in two wells, and nymphs of Paraperla frontalis were collected during hypoxic periods. We measured mass-specific metabolic rates (MSMRs) at different oxygen concentrations (12, 8, 6, 4, 2, 0.5 mg l(-1), and during recovery) for 111 stonefly nymphs to determine whether aquifer and benthic taxa differed in hypoxia tolerance. Metabolic rates of aquifer taxa were similar across oxygen concentrations spanning 2 to 12 mg l(-1) (P>0.437), but the MSMRs of benthic taxa dropped significantly with declining oxygen (P<0.0001; 2.9-times lower at 2 vs. 12 mg l(-1)). Aquifer taxa tolerated short-term repeated exposure to extreme hypoxia surprisingly well (100\% survival), but repeated longer-term (>12 h) exposures resulted in lower survival (38-91\%) and lower MSMRs during recovery. Our work suggests that aquifer stoneflies have evolved a remarkable set of behavioral and physiological adaptations that allow them to exploit the unique food resources available in hypoxic zones. These adaptations help to explain how large-bodied consumers might thrive in the underground aquifers of diverse and productive river floodplains.",2020,10.1242/jeb.225623,223,16,NA,jeb225623,Aquifer and benthic stoneflies; Plecoptera; River floodplain; Hypoxia; Physiology; Adaptation; Metabolic rate

The goal of this study was to compare aspects of ROS metabolism in response to O-2 variability (6 h hypoxia or hyperoxia, with subsequent normoxic recovery) in two species of intertidal sculpin fishes (Cottidae, Actinopterygii) that can experience O-2 fluctuations in their natural environment and differ in whole-animal hypoxia tolerance. To assess ROS metabolism, we measured the ratio of glutathione to glutathione disulfide as an indicator of tissue redox environment, MitoP/MitoB ratio to assess in vivo mitochondrial ROS generation, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) for lipid peroxidation, and total oxidative scavenging capacity (TOSC) in the liver, brain and gill. In the brain, the more hypoxia-tolerant Oligocottus maculosus showed large increases in TBARS levels following hypoxia and hyperoxia exposure that were generally not associated with large changes in mitochondrial H2O2. In contrast, the less-tolerant Scorpaenichthys marmoratus showed no significant changes in TBARS or mitochondrial H2O2 in the brain. More moderate increases were observed in the liver and gill of O. maculosus exposed to hypoxia and hyperoxia with normoxic recovery, whereas S. marmoratus had a greater response to O-2 variability in these tissues compared with the brain.

article,Evolutionary capacity of upper thermal limits: beyond single trait assessments,"Blackburn, Shaun and van Heerwaarden, Belinda and Kellermann, Vanessa and Sgro, Carla M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Thermal tolerance is an important factor influencing the distribution of ectotherms, but we still have limited understanding of the ability of species to evolve different thermal limits. Recent studies suggest that species may have limited capacity to evolve higher thermal limits in response to slower, more ecologically relevant rates of warming. However, these conclusions are based on univariate estimates of adaptive capacity. To test these findings within an explicitly multivariate context, we used a paternal half-sibling breeding design to estimate the multivariate evolutionary potential for upper thermal limits in Drosophila melanogaster. We assessed heat tolerance using static (basal and hardened) and ramping assays. Additive genetic variances were significantly different from zero only for the static measures of heat tolerance. Our G matrix analysis revealed that any response to selection for increased heat tolerance will largely be driven by static basal and hardened heat tolerance, with minimal contribution from ramping heat tolerance. These results suggest that the capacity to evolve upper thermal limits in nature may depend on the type of thermal stress experienced.",2014,10.1242/jeb.099184,217,11,1918-1924,NA,Thermal tolerance; Heritability; Genetic correlation; G matrix
article,Why do insects enter and recover from chill coma? Low temperature and high extracellular potassium compromise muscle function in <i>Locusta migratoria</i>,"Findsen, Anders and Pedersen, Thomas Holm and Petersen, Asbjorn Graver and Nielsen, Ole Baekgaard and Overgaard, Johannes",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"When exposed to low temperatures, many insect species enter a reversible comatose state (chill coma), which is driven by a failure of neuromuscular function. Chill coma and chill coma recovery have been associated with a loss and recovery of ion homeostasis (particularly extracellular {[}K+], {[}K+](o)) and accordingly onset of chill coma has been hypothesized to result from depolarization of membrane potential caused by loss of ion homeostasis. Here, we examined whether onset of chill coma is associated with a disturbance in ion balance by examining the correlation between disruption of ion homeostasis and onset of chill coma in locusts exposed to cold at varying rates of cooling. Chill coma onset temperature changed maximally 1 degrees C under different cooling rates and marked disturbances of ion homeostasis were not observed at any of the cooling rates. In a second set of experiments, we used isolated tibial muscle to determine how temperature and {[}K+](o), independently and together, affect tetanic force production. Tetanic force decreased by 80\% when temperature was reduced from 23 degrees C to 0.5 degrees C, while an increase in {[}K+](o) from 10 mmol l(-1) to 30 mmol l(-1) at 23 degrees C caused a 40\% reduction in force. Combining these two stressors almost abolished force production. Thus, low temperature alone may be responsible for chill coma entry, rather than a disruption of extracellular K+ homeostasis. As {[}K+] also has a large effect on tetanic force production, it is hypothesized that recovery of {[}K+] o following chill coma could be important for the time to recovery of normal neuromuscular function.",2014,10.1242/jeb.098442,217,8,1297-1306,NA,Cold tolerance; Critical thermal minimum; Grashoppers; Isometric force; Membrane potential; Neuromuscular junction
article,"Temperature and photoperiod as environmental cues affect body mass and thermoregulation in Chinese bulbuls, <i>Pycnonotus sinensis</i>","Hu, Shi-Nan and Zhu, Ying-Yang and Lin, Lin and Zheng, Wei-Hong and Liu, Jin-Song",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Seasonal changes in temperature and photoperiod are important environmental cues used by small birds to adjust their body mass (M-b) and thermogenesis. However, the relative importance of these cues with respect to seasonal adjustments in M-b and thermogenesis is difficult to distinguish. In particular, the effects of temperature and photoperiod on energy metabolism and thermoregulation are not well known in many passerines. To address this problem, we measured the effects of temperature and photoperiod on M-b, energy intake, resting metabolic rate (RMR), organ mass and physiological and biochemical markers of metabolic activity in the Chinese bulbul (Pycnonotus sinensis). Groups of Chinese bulbuls were acclimated in a laboratory to the following conditions: (1) warm and long photoperiod, (2) warm and short photoperiod, (3) cold and long photoperiod, and (4) cold and short photoperiod, for 4 weeks. The results indicate that Chinese bulbuls exhibit adaptive physiological regulation when exposed to different temperatures and photoperiods. M-b, RMR, gross energy intake and digestible energy intake were higher in cold-acclimated than in warm-acclimated bulbuls, and in the short photoperiod than in the long photoperiod. The resultant flexibility in energy intake and RMR allows Chinese bulbuls exposed to different temperatures and photoperiods to adjust their energy balance and thermogenesis accordingly. Cold-acclimated birds had heightened state-4 respiration and cytochrome c oxidase activity in their liver and muscle tissue compared with warmacclimated birds indicating the cellular mechanisms underlying their adaptive thermogenesis. Temperature appears to be a primary cue for adjusting energy budget and thermogenic ability in Chinese bulbuls; photoperiod appears to intensify temperature-induced changes in energy metabolism and thermoregulation.",2017,10.1242/jeb.143842,220,5,844-855,NA,Acclimation; Resting metabolic rate; Cytochrome c oxidase; Mitochondria; State-4 respiration
article,The gastric caecum of larval <i>Aedes aegypti</i>: stimulation of epithelial ion transport by 5-hydroxytryptamine and cAMP,"D'Silva, Natalie M. and O'Donnell, Michael J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"We report measurements of ion transport across the gastric caecum of larvae of Aedes aegypti, a vector of yellow fever that inhabits a variety of aquatic habitats ranging from freshwater to brackish water. We provide the first measurements of the effect of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) on transepithelial potential (TEP), luminal ion concentrations and electrochemical potentials, as well as basolateral membrane potential and H+, Na+ and K+ fluxes. TEP, basolateral membrane potential, and H+, K+ and Na+ fluxes across the gastric caeca declined within 3-6 min after isolation of the entire midgut from the larva. 5-HT restored both the TEP and active accumulation of H+, K+ and Na+ in the lumen. Additionally, 5-HT restored H+, K+ and Na+ fluxes across the distal caecum of freshwater larvae, and restored H+ fluxes across the distal caecum of brackish water larvae. There was no effect of 5-HT on ion fluxes across the proximal caecum. We have also shown that 5-HT restores the basolateral membrane potential in cells of the distal, but not proximal, caecum. Effects of 5-HT on TEP and basolateral membrane potential were mimicked by application of cAMP but not by a phorbol ester. We provide a working model which proposes that 5-HT and cAMP stimulate the vacuolar H+-ATPase of the distal caecum. Our results provide evidence that the gastric caecum is functionally distinct from the adjacent anterior midgut and we discuss possible roles of the gastric caecum in osmoregulation. We also describe similarities in the arrangement of ion transporters in the caecum with those of the Malpighian tubules.",2018,10.1242/jeb.172866,221,4,NA,jeb172866,Serotonin; 5-HT; Mosquito; Gastric caeca; Ion transport; cAMP
article,Daily temperature extremes play an important role in predicting thermal effects,"Ma, Gang and Hoffmann, Ary A. and Ma, Chun-Sen",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Organisms in natural environments experience diel temperature fluctuations, including sporadic extreme conditions, rather than constant temperatures. Studies based mainly on model organisms have tended to focus on responses to average temperatures or short-term heat stress, which overlooks the potential impact of daily fluctuations, including stressful daytime periods and milder night-time periods. Here, we focus on daily maximum temperatures, while holding night-time temperatures constant, to specifically investigate the effects of high temperature on demographic parameters and fitness in the English grain aphid Sitobion avenae. We then compared the observed effects of different daily maximum temperatures with predictions from constant temperature-performance expectations. Moderate daily maximum temperatures depressed aphid performance while extreme conditions had dramatic effects, even when mean temperatures were below the critical maximum. Predictions based on daily average temperature underestimated negative effects of temperature on performance by ignoring daily maximum temperature, while predictions based on daytime maximum temperatures overestimated detrimental impacts by ignoring recovery under mild night-time temperatures. Our findings suggest that daily maximum temperature will play an important role in regulating natural population dynamics and should be considered in predictions. These findings have implications for natural population dynamics, particularly when considering the expected increase in extreme temperature events under climate change.",2015,10.1242/jeb.122127,218,14,2289-2296,NA,Average temperature; Climate change; Life history trait; Mild temperature; Model prediction; Temperature extreme

Most of post-resuscitation related deaths are due to post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS). After cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) leads to renal ischemia-reperfusion injury, also known as PCAS. Many studies have focused on brain and heart injuries after ROSC, but renal failure has largely been ignored. Therefore, we investigated the protective effects of therapeutic hypothermia (TH) on asphyxial CA-induced renal injury in rats. Thirty rats were randomly divided into five groups: 1) the control group (sham); 2) the normothermic CA (nor.); 3) a normothermic CA group that received TH immediately within 2 h after CPR (Hypo. 2 hrs); 4) a normothermic CA group that received TH within 4 h after CPR (Hypo. 4 hrs); and 5) a normothermia CA group that received TH within 6 h after CPR (Hypo. 6 h). One day after CPR, all rats were sacrificed. Compared with the normothermic CA group, the TH groups demonstrated significantly increased survival rate (P < 0.05); decreased serum blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase levels; and lower histological damage degree and malondialdehyde concentration in their renal tissue. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling stain revealed that the number of apoptotic cells significantly decreased after 4 h and 6 h of TH compared to the results seen in the normothermic CA group. Moreover, TH downregulated the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 in the renal cortex compared to the normothermic CA group one day after CPR.

This study investigated ventilatory responses after WBC and examined the role of sex and anthropometric characteristics in 22 recreationally active male and female participants. Thermal sensation {[}TS], heart rate, blood pressure and ventilatory measures (expired volume {[}(V)over dotE], oxygen consumption {[}(V)over dotO(2)], respiratory exchange ratio and metabolic equivalents of task {[}METS]) were evaluated pre- and post-WBC, compared to a control condition. (V)over dotE increased by 10.8 L.min(-1) following WBC compared to 0.1 L.min(-1) in the control session (p=.001). (V)over dotO(2) increased by 0.4 L.min(-1) following WBC compared to 0.0 L.min(-1) in the control session (p<.001).

S.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Herein we describe two experiments in which the recruitment and pressure-induced modifications of human eccrine sweating were investigated. In one experiment, the longstanding belief that glandular recruitment follows a gradual, caudal-to-rostral (dermatomal) recruitment pattern was re-evaluated. The onset of sweating was simultaneously determined (ventilated capsules) from four spinal (dermatomal) segments (forehead, dorsal hand, lower chest and dorsal foot) during the passive heating of supine participants (N = 8). No evidence was found to support either dermatomal or simultaneous glandular recruitment patterns. Instead, the results were more consistent with individualised (random) patterns of regional activation (P > 0.05), with significant time delays among sites. Such delays in the appearance of discharged sweat may reflect differences in neurotransmitter sensitivity, precursor sweat production or ductal reabsorption. In the second experiment, the pressure-induced hemihidrotic reflex (contralateral sudomotor enhancement) was revisited, using pressures applied over 10 cm(2) areas of the chest (left side: 6 N cm(-2)) and left heel (3 N cm(-2)) during both supine and seated postures (N = 12). Participants were passively heated and thermally clamped before pressure application. Hemihidrosis was not observed from the contralateral surfaces within the same (chest) or lower spinal segments (abdomen; both P > 0.05) during chest pressure, but a generalised enhancement followed heel pressure when supine. We suggest that previous observations of hemihidrosis possibly resulted from elevated heat storage, rather than a neural reflex. Chest pressure significantly inhibited ipsilateral sweating (forehead, hand, chest; all P < 0.05), and that influence is hypothesised to result from interactions between ascending mechanoreceptor afferents and the descending sudomotor pathways.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.03.008,82,NA,52-62,NA,Hemihidrosis; Posture; Pressure; Sweating; Sudomotor; Thermoregulation

After analyzing physiological, biochemical parameters and expression profile of heat shock response (HSR) genes of animals in response to different THI, it was evident from the study that animal undergoes few or little changes at THI 72, but major physiological changes occurred after THI reached 74. At THI range 74-79, no drastic change in these parameters occurred suggesting animals undergo transient acclimatization in this range to maintain homeostasis. Once THI reached and crossed 80, this homeostasis was perturbed and animals experienced major physiological changes again. Overall, the study suggests that THI values indicating level of heat stress are dependent on the geographic location, as well as type of animal and therefore, existing THI should be recalibrated for different climatic region for accurate assessment of the heat stress.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.03.017,82,NA,99-106,NA,Heat stress; Temperature humidity index; Thermal imaging; Hsp70; Hsf
