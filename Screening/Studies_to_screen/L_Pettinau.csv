article,Interacting effects of ambient temperature and food quality on the foraging ecology of small mammalian herbivores,"Camp, Meghan J. and Shipley, Lisa A. and Milling, Charlotte R. and Rachlow, Janet L. and Forbey, Jennifer S.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Both temperature and diet quality play an important role in the time and energy budgets of small mammalian herbivores. However, little is known about how temperature and diet quality interact to influence diet selection, nutrient extraction, and energetics, and how these effects might differ among species. Therefore, we examined the effects of diet quality and temperature on aspects of the foraging ecology of two species of lagomorphs, pygmy rabbits (Brachyiagus idahoensis), which are small dietary specialists, and mountain cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus nuttallii), which are larger dietary and habitat generalists. In a series of feeding experiments, we investigated 1) the effects of temperature on selection of plant fiber and the plant secondary metabolite 1,8 cineole in their diets, 2) effects of temperature and plant fiber on daily intake, digestion, and passage of food, 3) effects of plant fiber and 1,8 cineole on resting metabolic rate, and 4) how these interactions differ between the rabbit species. Both species chose to eat more total food and a greater proportion of high fiber food that passed more quickly through the digestive system in colder temperatures. However, temperature did not affect how much 1,8 cineole the rabbits consumed nor how thoroughly they digested food. Food quality affected how well they digested the dry matter in the food, but not their resting metabolic rate. Understanding how the interactions between ambient temperature and food quality affect selection of diets and intake by small mammalian herbivores, and the physiological mechanisms governing these choices, is useful for predicting how these species might respond to changes in both temperature and food quality and inform conservation and restoration strategies.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.10.021,71,NA,83-90,NA,Mountain cottontail rabbit; Fiber; Plant secondary metabolite; Pygmy rabbit; Sagebrush; Specialist; Thermal environment
article,Locomotor and energetic consequences of behavioral thermoregulation in the sanguivorous leech Hirudo verbana,"Hitchcock, Amanda C. and Connolly, Erin M. and Darakananda, Karin and Jeong, Janet W. and Quist, Arbor J. L. and Robbins, Allison B. and Ellerby, David J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Medicinal leeches (Hirudo uerbana) thermoregulate with respect to their sanguivorous feeding behavior. Immediate postprandial preferences are for warmer than their initial acclimation temperature (T-a, 21 degrees C, Petersen et al. 2011), while unfed leeches have a lower preferred temperature (T-pref 12.5 degrees C). This may reduce energy expenditure and defer starvation if feeding opportunities are limited. Energetic benefits may have an associated cost if low temperatures reduce mobility and the ability to locate further hosts. These costs could be limited if mobility is unimpaired at low temperatures, or if acclimation can restore locomotor performance to the levels at T-a. The transition from T-a to the unfed T-pref significantly reduced speed and propulsive cycle frequency during swimming, and extension and retraction rates during crawling. Aerobic metabolic rate was also reduced from 0.20 +/- 0.03 W kg(-1) at Ta to 0.10 +/- 0.03 W kg(-1) at T-pref The Q(10), values of 1.7-2.9 for energetic and swimming parameters indicate a substantial temperature effect, although part of the decline in swimming performance can be attributed to temperature-related changes in water viscosity. 6 weeks at To resulted in no detectable acclimation in locomotor performance or aerobic metabolism. The energetic savings associated with a lower T-pref in unfed leeches effectively doubled the estimated time until depletion of energy reserves. Given that some mobility is still retained at T-pref and that acclimation is in itself costly, the energetic benefits of selecting cooler temperatures between feedings may outweigh the costs associated with reduced locomotor performance.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.01.007,65,NA,1-7,NA,Acclimation; Locomotion; Behavioral thermoregulation; Hirudo uerbana
article,Population level differences in thermal sensitivity of energy assimilation in terrestrial salamanders,"Clay, Timothy A. and Gifford, Matthew E.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Thermal adaptation predicts that thermal sensitivity of physiological traits should be optimized to thermal conditions most frequently experienced. Furthermore, thermodynamic constraints predict that species with higher thermal optima should have higher performance maxima and narrower performance breadths. We tested these predictions by examining the thermal sensitivity of energy assimilation between populations within two species of terrestrial-lungless salamanders, Plethodon albagula and P. montanus. Within P. albagula, we examined populations that were latitudinally separated by > 450 km. Within P. montanus, we examined populations that were elevationally separated by > 900 m. Thermal sensitivity of energy assimilation varied substantially between populations of P. albagula separated latitudinally, but did not vary between populations of P. montanus separated elevationally. Specifically, in P. albagula, the lower latitude population Had a higher thermal optimum, higher maximal performance, and narrower performance breadth compared to the higher latitude population. Furthermore, across all individuals as thermal optima increased, performance maxima also increased, providing support for the theory that ``hotter is better{''",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.12.006,64,NA,1-6,NA,Thermal performance curve; Hotter is better; Thermal sensitivity; Plethodon
article,Expression of HSP70 genes in skin of zebu (Tharparkar) and crossbred (Karan Fries) cattle during different seasons under tropical climatic conditions,"Maibam, Uttarani and Hooda, O. K. and Sharma, P. S. and Mohanty, A. K. and Singh, S. V. and Upadhyay, R. C.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Skin is most important environmental interface providing a protective envelope to animals. It's always under the influence of both internal and external stressors. Heat shock proteins (HSP) are highly conserved stress proteins which play crucial roles in environmental stress tolerance and thermal adaptation. Present study was planned to observe the relative mRNA expression of inducible (HSP70.1 and HSP70.2) and constitutive (HSP70.8) HSP in skin of zebu (Tharparkar) and crossbred (Karan Fries) cattle during different seasons. Skin biopsies were collected from rump region of each animal, aseptically during winter, spring and summer season. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction was performed to examine the gene expression of constitutive (HSP70.8) and inducible (HSP70.1 and HSP70.2) HSP in skin of both the breeds during different seasons. Present study observed higher expression of both constitutive and inducible HSP genes in both the breeds during summer and winter than spring season, but magnitude of increase was higher during summer than winter. During summer season, expression pattern of HSP5 in skin showed breed differences, where constitutive HSP expression was higher in Tharparkar than Karan Fries and that of inducible HSP was higher in Karan Fries than Tharparkar. Hence, present study suggested that HSP may be conveniently used as biomarkers for assessing protective response of skin against heat stress in zebu and crossbred cattle. Variation in expression between breeds is associated with their heat tolerance and thermal adaptability. In summary, skin of zebu cattle (Tharparkar) is more resistant to summer stress than crossbred (Karan Fries), providing greater protection against heat stress during summer season. Superior skin protective mechanism of zebu (Tharparkar) than crossbred (Karan-Fries) cattle against heat stress may contribute to superior adaptability of zebu cattle to tropical climatic conditions than crossbreed.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.11.007,63,NA,58-64,NA,Heat stress; Tharparkar; Karan Fries; HSP; Skin
article,Thermal development of <i>Cephalonomia tarsalis</i> (Hymenoptera: Bethylidae) parasitoid of the saw-toothed stored product beetles of the genus <i>Oryzaephilus</i> sp (Coleoptera: Sylvanidae).,"Eliopoulos, Panagiotis A. and Kontodimas, Dimitrios C.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The effect of temperature on the development and survival of Cephalonomia tarsalis (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Bethylidae), larval ectoparasitoid of beetles of Oryzaephilus sp. (Coleoptera: Silvanidae) was studied in the laboratory. Durations of the development of the egg, larva and pupa were measured in eight constant temperatures (15, 17.5, 20, 25, 30, 32.5, 35 and 37.5 degrees C) parasitizing larvae of the saw-toothed beetle Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.) (Coleoptera: Silvanidae). The duration of development was decreased with temperature increase within the range 17.5-32.5 degrees C. Survival was higher when immatures were exposed to medium temperatures (20-30 degrees C) compared with those lived in a more extreme temperature regime ( <20 and > 30 degrees C). Wasps failed to complete their development at 15 and 37.5 degrees C. Thermal parameters (upper, lower and optimum developmental threshold, thermal constant) were estimated by fitting the linear and a non-linear (Logan I) model to our data. Upper and lower developmental thresholds ranged between 35.1-37.0 degrees C and 13.2-13.8 degrees C, respectively. The optimum temperature for development was estimated between 33.6 degrees C and 34.6 degrees C. Tests for developmental rate isomorphy (DRI) showed that change in the average proportion of time spent in each developmental stage was marginally significant, proving that development of C. tarsalis is probably incompatible with DRI. However, this conclusion is questionable given that lower developmental thresholds did not differ significantly among various developmental stages (bootstrap test). Thermal constant for total development was calculated 212.4 degree-days. Our results are discussed not only on the basis of thermal biology, but also of improving the efficiency of C tarsalis as biocontrol agent. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Thermoregulatory strategies in an aquatic ectotherm from thermally-constrained habitats: An evaluation of current approaches,"Piasecna, Karin and Poncova, Alena and Tejedo, Miguel and Gvozdik, Lumir",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Many ectotherms employ diverse behavioral adjustments to effectively buffer the spatio-temporal variation in environmental temperatures, whereas others remain passive to thermal heterogeneity. Thermoregulatory studies are frequently performed on species living in thermally benign habitats, which complicate understanding of the thermoregulation-thermoconformity continuum. The need for new empirical data from ectotherms exposed to thermally challenging conditions requires the evaluation of available methods for quantifying thermoregulatory strategies. We evaluated the applicability of various thermoregulatory indices using fire salamander larvae, Salamandra salamandra, in two aquatic habitats, a forest pool and well, as examples of disparate thermally-constrained environments. Water temperatures in the well were lower and less variable than in the pool. Thermal conditions prevented larvae from reaching their preferred body temperature range in both water bodies. In contrast to their thermoregulatory abilities examined in a laboratory thermal gradient, field body temperatures only matched the mean and range of operative temperatures, showing thermal passivity of larvae in both habitats. Despite apparent thermoconformity, thermoregulatory indices indicated various strategies from active thermoregulation, to thermoconformity, and even thermal evasion, which revealed their limited applicability under thermally-constrained conditions. Salamander larvae abandoned behavioral thermoregulation despite varying opportunities to increase their body temperature above average water temperatures. Thermoconformity represents a favored strategy in these ectotherms living in more thermally-constrained environments than those examined in previous thermoregulatory studies. To understand thermal ecology and its impact on population dynamics, the quantification of thermoregulatory strategies of ectotherms in thermally-constrained habitats requires the careful choice of an appropriate method to avoid misleading results.

article,"Male yaks adapt to heat stress with enhancement of immunomodulation, anti-oxidation, and blood oxygen delivery","Gu, Zhaobing",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Yaks adapt to extremely low temperatures, but they are more susceptible to heat stress (HS). The adaptive mechanisms with crucial plasma protein markers regulating the response to HS remain elusive. In this study, data-independent acquisition proteomics were used to evaluate the thermal adaptability under chronic HS and thermal-neutral conditions. As a result, yaks increased body temperatures and respiratory rates in response to HS. Eight differential proteins mainly related to vasodilatation were decreased by HS, but another four proteins associated with blood oxygen delivery were presented at higher levels. Complement and coagulation cascades pathway was activated by HS, and more proteins were upregulated to protect against inflammation and oxidative stress by higher levels of antioxidant proteins. It is likely that yaks react to HS with enhancement of immunomodulation, anti-oxidation, and blood oxygen delivery, which is conducive to taking appropriate environment and nutrition management strategies to get healthy and high-performing yaks in low-altitude regions during summer.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103879,123,NA,NA,103879,Heat stress; Proteomics profile; Yaks; Adaptive mechanisms
article,How turtles keep their cool: Seasonal and diel basking patterns in a tropical turtle,"Kidman, Rosie and Mcknight, Donald T. and Schwarzkopf, Lin and Nordberg, Eric J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Behavioural thermoregulation by ectotherms is an important mechanism for maintaining body temperatures to optimise physiological performance. Experimental studies suggest that nocturnal basking by Krefft's river turtles (Emydura macquarii krefftii) in the tropics may allow them to avoid high water temperatures, however, this hypothesis has yet to be tested in the field. In this study, we examined the influence of environmental temperature on seasonal and diel patterns of basking in E. m. krefftii in tropical north Queensland, Australia. Wildlife cameras were used to document turtle basking events for seven consecutive days and nights for each month over a year (April 2020-March 2021). Air and water temperatures were recorded simultaneously using temperature loggers. We used a negative binomial mixed effects model to compare mean basking durations (min) occurring among four environmental temperature categories based on population thermal preference (26 degrees C): 1) air temperature above and water temperature below preferred temperature; 2) air temperature below and water temperature above preferred temperature; 3) air and water temperatures both above preferred temperature; and 4) air and water temperatures both below preferred temperature. Basking behaviour was influenced significantly by the relationship between air and water temperature. During the day, turtles spent significantly less time basking when both air and water temperatures were above their preferred temperatures. Conversely, at night, turtles spent significantly more time basking when water temperatures were warm and air temperatures were cool relative to their preferred temperature. This study adds to the growing body of work indicating pronounced heat avoidance as a thermoregulatory strategy among tropical reptile populations.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103834,121,NA,NA,103834,Australia; Ectotherm; Tropical reptile; Nocturnal basking; Thermoregulation; Thermoregulatory cooling; Heat avoidance

Majharul and Abdelazim, Aaser M. and Mahboub, Heba H. and Shahjahan, Md",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Hypoxic aquatic environments occur more frequently as a result of climate change, thereby exerting challenges on the physiological and metabolic functions of aquatic animals. In this study, a model fish, zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) was used to observe the climate -induced hypoxic effect on the upper thermal limit (critical thermal maximum; CTmax), hemoglobin, and blood glucose levels, and abnormalities of erythrocytes at cellular and nuclear level. The value of CTmax decreased significantly under hypoxia (39.10 +/- 0.96 degrees C) compared to normoxia (43.70 +/- 0.91 degrees C). At CTmax, hemoglobin levels were much lower (9.33 +/- 0.60 g/dL) and blood glucose levels were significantly higher (194.20 +/- 11.33 mg/L) under hypoxia than they were under normoxia and at the beginning of the experiment. Increased frequencies of abnormalities in the erythrocytes at both cellular (fusion, twin, elongated, spindle and tear drop shaped) and nuclear (micronucleus, karyopyknosis, binuclei, nuclear degeneration and notched nuclei) levels were also found under hypoxia compared to normoxia. These results suggest that hypoxic conditions significantly alter the temperature tolerance and subsequent physiology in zebrafish.

article,Nightly reductions in body temperature and effect of transmitter attachment method in free-living welcome swallows (<i> Hirundo</i> neoxena ),"Barratt, Alice and Turbill, Christopher",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Small birds and mammals face similar energetic challenges, yet use of torpor to conserve energy while resting is considered less common among birds, especially within the most specious order Passeriformes. We conducted the first study to record the natural thermoregulatory physiology of any species from the family Hirundinidae, which we predicted would use torpor because of their specialised foraging by aerial pursuit of flying insects, that are less active during cold or windy weather. We used temperature telemetry on wild -living welcome swallows ( Hirundo neoxena , 13 to 17 g) and found that skin temperature declined during nightly resting by an average by 5 degrees C, from daytime minima of 41.0 +/- 0.8 degrees C to nightly minima of 36.3 +/- 0.8 degrees C, and by a maximum of 8 degrees C to a minimum recorded skin temperature of 32.0 degrees C. The extent of reduction in skin temperature was greater on cold nights and following windy daytime (foraging) periods. Further, we found that transmitters glued directly to the skin between feather tracts (i.e., an apterium) provided a less variable and probably also more accurate reflection of body temperature than transmitters applied over closely trimmed feathers. A moderate decrease in skin temperature, equivalent to shallow torpor, would provide energy savings during rest. Yet, deeper torpor was not observed, despite a period of extreme rainfall that presumedly decreased foraging success. Further studies are needed to understand the resting thermoregulatory energetics of swallows under different environmental conditions. We advocate the importance of measuring thermal biology in wild -living birds to increase our knowledge of the physiology and ecological importance of torpor among passerine birds.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103792,120,NA,NA,103792,Energetics; Hirundinidae; Passerine; Telemetry; Torpor; Winter
article,Anti-oxidant effects of herbal residue from Shengxuebao mixture on heat-stressed New Zealand rabbits,"He, Yu and Yu, Jingao and Song, Zhongxing and Tang, Zhishu and Duan, Jin-Ao and Zhu, Huaxu and Liu, Hongna and Zhou, Jianping and Cao, Zhaojun",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Heat stress can lead to hormonal imbalances, weakened immune system, increased metabolic pressure on the liver, and ultimately higher animal mortality rates. This not only seriously impairs the welfare status of animals, but also causes significant economic losses to the livestock industry. Due to its rich residual bioactive components and good safety characteristics, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) residue is expected to become a high-quality feed additive with anti-oxidative stress alleviating function. This study focuses on the potential of Shengxuebao mixture herbal residue (SXBR) as an anti-heat stress feed additive. Through the UPLC (ultra performance liquid chromatography) technology, the average residue rate of main active ingredients from SXBR were found to be 25.39\%. SXBR were then added into the basal diet of heat stressed New Zealand rabbits at the rates of 5\% (SXBRl), 10\% (SXBRm) and 20\% (SXBRh). Heat stress significantly decreased the weight gain, as well as increased neck and ear temperature, drip loss in meat, inflammation and oxidative stress. Also, the hormone levels were disrupted, with a significant increase in serum levels of CA, COR and INS. After the consumption of SXBR in the basal diet for 3 weeks, the weight of New Zealand rabbits increased significantly, and the SXBRh group restored the redness value of the meat to a similar level as the control group. Furthermore, the serum levels T3 thyroid hormone in the SXBRh group and T4 thyroid hormone in the SXBRm group increased significantly, the SXBRh group showed a significant restoration in inflammation markers (IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha) and oxidative stress markers (total antioxidant capacity, HSP-70, MDA, and ROS) levels. Moreover, the real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR analysis found that, the expression levels of antioxidant genes such as Nrf2, HO-1, NQO1, and GPX1 were significantly upregulated in the SXBRh group, and the expression level of the Keap1 gene was significantly downregulated. Additionally, the SXBRm group showed significant upregulation in the expression levels of HO-1 and NQO1 genes. Western blot experiments further confirmed the up-regulation of Nrf2, Ho-1 and NQO1 proteins. This study provides a strategy for the utilization of SXBR and is of great significance for the green recycling of the TCM residues, improving the development of animal husbandry and animal welfare.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103752,119,NA,NA,103752,Heat stress; Herb residue; Antioxidant stress; Feed additives; Western blot
article,Assessment of vertical cooling performance of trees over different surface covers,"Wang, Wei and He, Bao-Jie",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Tree-induced cooling benefits are associated with various factors, such as canopy morphology, surface cover, and environmental configuration. However, limited studies have analyzed the sensitivity of tree-induced cooling effects to the combination of such factors. Most studies have focused on 1.5-m cooling performance, and few studies on the variability of the under-tree vertical cooling performance. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the vertical cooling performance of different combinations of trees and surface covers. The study was completed in Chongqing, China, with field experiments capturing vertical air temperature and wind speed at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 m under two typical combinations of ``tree + grass{''} (ComA) and ``tree + shrubs{''} (ComB), and capturing 1.5 m microclimatic environments of a control group with hard pavement without tree shade (REF). The results show that at an average ambient temperature of 33 degrees C, the maximum air-cooling temperatures for ComA and ComB were 2.46 degrees C and 1.78 degrees C, respectively. An increase in the ambient temperature corresponded to a decrease in the cooling effect difference between ComA and ComB. ComA had a maximum vertical temperature difference of 1.01 degrees C between H1.5m and H2.0m. Between H2.5m and H2.0m , the maximum vertical temperature difference for ComB was 1.64 degrees C. This study explored the changing patterns of under-tree vertical temperatures under different tree and surface cover combinations, conducive to clarifying the key elements affecting tree cooling performance.

The use of non-invasive methods, such as infrared thermography and real-time ultrasonography, are widely used to evaluate indicators in animal production, without the need to slaughter the animals. Thus, we aimed to assess the effect of the thermal environment on the physiological parameters and carcass characteristics of Dorper sheep with positive and negative residual feed intake (RFI) using infrared thermography and real-time ultrasonography techniques. Twenty uncastrated male Dorper sheep (17.8 +/- 2.4 kg) were confined for 40 days for RFI classification. Sheep were separated into positive RFI (n = 10) and negative RFI (n = 10). The experimental design was in randomized blocks, in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement, with 2 thermal environments (full sun or shade) and two feed efficiency groups (positive RFI or negative RFI), with 5 replications. The sheep remained in confinement for 60 days. The animals were slaughtered at the end of the experiment and the carcasses dissected for tissue separation. Rectal temperature (RT) and respiratory rate (RR) were measured at two times (14:00 h and 18:00 h) for periods of 5 days. The RR was determined by indirect auscultation of heart sounds at the level of the laryngotracheal region. The RT was measured introduced a digital clinical thermometer into the animal's rectum. Surface temperature (ST) was obtained using a thermographic infrared camera, collecting the temperatures of the eyeball and skin surface in the regions of the head, ribs, rump, flank and shin. Sheep confined in full sun showed higher RR (P = 0.0001), ST ribs (P = 0.0020), ST rumb (P = 0.0055), ST flank (P = 0.0001) and heat tolerance coefficient (HTC) (P = 0.0010). For sheep confined in full sun, a strong correlation was observed between the RR and the mean ST (MST; r = 0.6826; P = 0.0236) and between the final loin eye area (LEAf) with the real LEA (LEAr) (r = 0.9263; P = 0.0001) and slaughter body weight (SBW) (r = 0.7532; P = 0.0325).

In the experiment, chickens were exposed to two temperature rooms with a heated room of 32 \& PLUSMN; 1.2 degrees C from 11:00 to16:00 h and a normal room temperature with an average maximum and minimum of 23.8 \& PLUSMN; 3 degrees C and 16.6 \& PLUSMN; 1.6 degrees C, respectively, and a relative humidity between 34.5 \& PLUSMN; 4 and 44.8 \& PLUSMN; 3\%. The chickens were supplemented with 0, 5, and 10 g/kg of coriander seed powder. The results showed that the group of Koekoek chickens placed in a heated room had significantly lower (P < 0.05) feed intake and weight gain and significantly higher (P < 0.05) feed conversion ratio than the groups placed at normal room temperature. Water intake was 1.8\% higher in the groups placed in a heated room than those placed at normal room temperature. Supplementation with coriander seed powder enhanced growth performance and carcass traits. The carcass weight and breast percentage were higher (P < 0.05) in the groups that received 10 g/kg coriander seed powder. The growth performance of the Koekoek groups supplemented with 10 g/kg coriander seed powder in a heated room also improved significantly compared to groups in a heated room without supplementation.

article,"Intensity of adaptations to heat stress in poultry farms: A behavioural analysis of farmers in Ondo state, Nigeria","Olutumise, Adewale Isaac",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The detrimental consequences of heat stress due to high ambient temperatures, particularly in the poultry in-dustry, have led to the invention of several adaptation strategies. However, there is still limited information on the intensity of adaptations and the likely behavioural factors that influence farmers' decisions. Thus, under-standing the practical adaptation behaviours of poultry farmers would improve our knowledge of the funda-mental mechanisms for developing effective interventions. To fill this void, using a count data model, the study empirically examines the farmers' behavioural factors and the intensity of heat stress adaptation strategies' adoption among poultry farmers in Ondo State, Nigeria. The data were drawn from a survey of 150 poultry farmers using a multistage sampling procedure. The empirical results show that the majority of the farmers perceived an increase in temperature, frequently experienced heat stress, and believed that heat stress is induced by climate change. An average of six adaptation strategies were simultaneously adopted to mitigate heat stress in the area. The results of the count regression model reveal that farm-level factors such as permanent water sources, the quantity of feed, and bird stock density exert a significant effect on the intensity of adaptations. Climate-related factors such as access to climate information, training participation, perceived increases in temperature, attitudes toward climate change, and motives for adoption have a significant behavioural effect on the intensity of adaptations. Likewise, variables such as poultry farming experience, educational status, and access to credit are accounted for as socioeconomic behavioural factors that influence the intensity of adopting heat stress adaptation strategies in the area. This concludes that behavioural factors are crucial in addressing heat stress adaptations and assisting in improving environmental management, which would form a key variable in the policy interventions.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103614,115,NA,NA,103614,Adaptation strategies; Behavioural factors; Climate change; Heat stress; Poultry farms; Nigeria
article,Some like it hotter: Differential thermal preferences among lizard color morphs,"Thompson, Asher and Kapsanaki, Vassiliki and Liwanag, Heather E. M. and Pafilis, Panayiotis and Wang, Ian J. and Brock, Kinsey M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature rules the lives of ectotherms. To perform basic biological functions, ectotherms must make behavioral adjustments to keep their body temperatures near a preferred temperature (Tpref). Many color polymorphic lizards are active thermoregulators and exhibit morph differences in traits related to thermoreg-ulation, such as color, body size, and microhabitat use. The Aegean wall lizard, Podarcis erhardii, is a heliothermic lizard with orange, white, and yellow color morphs that differ in size, behavior, and microhabitat use. Here, we tested whether P. erhardii color morphs from the same population from Naxos island, Greece, differ in Tpref. We hypothesized that orange morphs would prefer lower temperatures than white and yellow morphs because or-ange morphs are often found on cooler substrates and in microhabitats with more vegetation cover. We obtained Tpref for 95 individuals using laboratory thermal gradient experiments of wild-caught lizards and found that orange morphs do, indeed, prefer cooler temperatures. Average orange morph Tpref was 2.85 degrees C lower than average white and yellow morph Tpref. Our results add support to the idea that P. erhardii color morphs have multivariate alternative phenotypes and present the possibility that thermally heterogeneous environments play a role in the maintenance of color polymorphism in this species.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103532,113,NA,NA,103532,Aegean wall lizard; Alternative phenotypes; Polymorphism; Podarcis erhardii; Preferred temperature; Thermoregulation
article,Effects of heat exposure on the thermoregulatory responses of young children,"Tsuzuki, Kazuyo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether young children's thermoregulation during heat exposure varies with age and body size. A total of 34 young children (aged 6 months-8 years)-18 boys and 16 girl-s-participated in the study. They were divided into five groups according to age (<1 year, 1 year, 2-3 years, 4-5 years, and 8 years). The participants sat for 30 min in a 27 degrees C, 50\% rh room, then moved to a 35 degrees C, 70\% rh room and remained seated for at least 30 min. They then returned to the first 27 degrees C room and remained stationary for 30 min. Rectal temperature (Tre) and skin temperature (Tsk) were continuously recorded, and the amount of whole-body sweat rate (SR) was measured. Local SR of the back and upper arm were collected with filter paper to calculate local sweating volume, and Na + concentration was measured later. The smaller the age, the signifi-cantly greater the increase in Tre. There was no significant difference in the amount of whole-body SR and the increase in Tsk during the heating among the five groups. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in whole-body SR per increase in Tre during heating between the five groups, but a significant difference was found in back local SR per increase in Tre with age. Difference in local SR between upper arm and back was observed at age 2 years and above, and difference in Na+ concentrations in sweat was observed at age 8 years. The devel-opment of thermoregulatory responses with growth was observed. The results indicate that the thermoregulatory response is disadvantaged by immature mechanisms and small body size in younger children.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103507,113,NA,NA,103507,Child; Heat exposure; Skin temperature; Rectal temperature; Sweating rate
article,Dry response and acclimated characteristics of people ascending the Tibetan Plateau,"Wang, Dengjia and Sun, Xin and Song, Cong and Wang, Yingying and Duan, Guannan and Hu, Jiale",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Due to a long period of low humidity, exposure to the dry environment of the Tibetan Plateau can cause skin and respiratory diseases and threaten human health. To examine the characteristics of acclimatization response to humidity comfort in visitors to the Tibetan Plateau based on an examination of the targeted effect and mechanism of the dry environment. A scale corresponding to local dryness symptoms was proposed. Eight participants were selected to conduct a two-week plateau experiment and a one-week plain experiment under six humidity ratios, respectively, to explore the characteristics of dry response and acclimatization of people entering the plateau. The results indicate that duration has a significant effect on human dry response. On the sixth day after entering Tibet, the degree of dryness reached the maximum, and acclimatization to the plateau environment began on the 12th day. The sensitivity of different body parts to the change in a dry environment was different. When the indoor humidity ratio increased from 9.04 g/kg to 21.77 g/kg, the symptoms of dry skin were most significantly relieved by 0.5 units of scale. After de-acclimatization, the degree of dryness in the eyes was most significantly alleviated, reducing by nearly one scale. The analysis of human symptom indicators in a dry environment shows that subjective and physiological indices are influential and essential in measuring human comfort in a dry environment. This study extends our understanding of dry environment responses and cognition of human comfort and lays a solid foundation for humid built environments in the plateau.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103493,113,NA,NA,103493,Humidity comfort; Physiological response; Altitude; Acclimatization; Dryness

Whereas numerous studies have investigated temperature effects on animal life histories, assessments of their immune function are limited. In the size-and colour-dimorphic black scavenger (or dung) fly Sepsis thoracica (Diptera: Sepsidae), we experimentally studied how developmental temperature and larval density influence phenoloxidase (PO) activity, a key enzyme in insect pigmentation, thermoregulation, and immunity. Flies from five latitudinal European populations were raised at three developmental temperatures (18, 24, 30 degrees C). PO ac-tivity increased with developmental temperature differently in the sexes and the two male morphs (black and orange), altering the sigmoid relationship between melanism, i.e. colouration and fly size. PO activity further positively correlated with larval rearing density, potentially because of higher risks of pathogen infection or greater developmental stress following stronger resource competition. Populations varied somewhat in PO ac-tivity, body size and colouration, however with no clear latitudinal pattern. Overall our results indicate that morph-and sex-specific PO activity, and thus likely immune function, in S. thoracica depends on temperature and larval density, modifying the underlying putative trade-off between immunity and body size. The strong dampening of the immune system of all morphs at cool temperatures suggests low-temperature stress in this warm-adapted species common in southern Europe. Our results also support the population density dependent prophylaxis hypothesis, which predicts higher investment in immunity when facing limited resource availability and increased pathogen infection probability.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103473,112,NA,NA,103473,Alternative reproductive phenotypes; Body size; Colouration; Density dependence; Dimorphism; Immune defense; Melanin; Phenoloxidase; Temperature; Trade-off
article,Hypoxia-inducible factor-1? is involved in the response to heat stress in lactating dairy cows,"Zhang, Xu and Wang, Diming and Liu, Jianxin",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) is important in maintaining cellular oxygen homeostasis and cellular heat tolerance. To explore the role of HIF-1 alpha in the response to heat stress (HS) in dairy cows, 16 Chinese Holstein cows (milk yield: 32 \& PLUSMN; 4 kg/d, days in milk: 272 \& PLUSMN; 7 d, parity: 2-3) were used to collect coccygeal vein blood and milk samples when cows were under mild (temperature-humidity index = 77) and moderate HS (temperature-humidity index = 84), respectively. Compared to cows under mild HS, the respiratory rate (P < 0.01), rectal temperature (P < 0.01), and blood concentrations of heat shock protein (HSP)70 (P < 0.01) and HSP27 (P < 0.01) were higher, but oxygen saturation (P = 0.02) and hemoglobin (P < 0.01) were lower in cows under moderate HS. Blood HIF-1 alpha concentration was greater (P < 0.01) during moderate HS, indicating that HIF-1 alpha is involved in lactating cows' response to HS. To confirm these findings, we collected coccygeal vein blood and milk samples from 59 dairy cows under moderate HS. The HIF-1 alpha levels were correlated with the levels of heat shock transcription factor (HSF) (r = 0.7857, P < 0.01), HSP70 (r = 0.4543, P < 0.01) and HSP27 (r = 0.8782, P < 0.01). A comparison of 15 cows with higher HIF-1 alpha (> 482 ng/L) and 15 cows with lower HIF-1 alpha levels (< 439 ng/L) showed that reactive oxidative species were higher (P = 0.02), but superoxide dismutase (P < 0.01), total antioxidation capacity (P = 0.02) and glutathione peroxidase (P < 0.01) were lower in higher HIF-1 alpha cows. These results suggested that HIF-1 alpha may be indicative of the risk of oxidative stress in heat-stressed cows and may participate in the response of cows to HS by synergistically activating the expression of the HSP family with HSF.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103460,112,NA,NA,103460,Hypoxia-inducible factor-1?; Heat stress; Dairy cows
article,Analytical and numerical analysis of the dual-pulse lag heat transfer in a three-dimensional tissue subjected to a moving multi-point laser beam,"Partovi, Babak and Ahmadikia, Hossein and Mosharaf-Dehkordi, Mehdi",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"An extensive algorithm based on both analytical and numerical solution methodologies is proposed to obtain transient temperature distributions in a three-dimensional living tissue subjected to a moving single-point and multi-point laser beam by considering metabolic heat generation and blood perfusion rate. Here, the dual-phase lag/Pennes equation is analytically solved by using the method of Fourier series and the Laplace transform. The ability to model single-point or multi-point laser beams as an arbitrary function of place and time is a significant advantage of the proposed analytical approach, which can be used to solve similar heat transfer problems in other living tissues. Besides, the related heat conduction problem is numerically solved based on the finite element method. The effects of laser beam transitional speed, laser power, and the number of laser points on the temperature distribution within the skin tissue are investigated. Moreover, the temperature distribution predicted by the dual-phase lag model is compared with that of the Pennes model under different working conditions. For the studied cases, it is observed that the maximum tissue temperature decreased about 63\% by an increase of 6 mm/s in the speed of the laser beam. An increase in the laser power from 0.8 W/cm3 to 1.2 W/cm3 results in a 28 degrees C increase in the maximum temperature of the skin tissue. It is observed that the maximum temperature predicted by the dual-phase lag model is always lower than that of the Pennes model and the temperature variations over time are sharper, while their results are entirely consistent over the simulation time. The obtained numerical results indicated that the dual-phase lag model is preferred in heating processes occurring at short intervals. Among the investigated parameters, the laser beam speed has the most considerable effect on the difference between the results of the Pennes and the dual-phase lag models.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103431,112,NA,NA,103431,Biological heat transfer; Dual phase lag model; Multi-point laser beam; Moving laser; Analytical solution; Laplace transform
article,Mathematical modelling and analysis of thermoregulation effects on blood viscosity under magnetic effects and thermal radiation in a permeable stretching capillary,"Priyadharsini, M. and Gururaj, A. David Maxim",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The current study deals with the mathematical modelling and analysis of the effects of thermoregulation on blood viscosity under magnetic and thermal radiation effects on a permeable, stretching blood capillary. The model comprises the governing equations of the resulting boundary layer problem, which is a set of nonlinear partial differential equations, and this is transformed into a coupled system of nonlinear differential equations using similarity transformation. The numerical solution of the problem is attained by the fourth-order Runge Kutta method with the shooting method. The current work examines the velocity and temperature profile of blood flow with the impact of varying temperature-dependent blood viscosity, involving the variation of several physical parameters such as magnetic field, radiation parameter, permeability parameter, Prandtl number, and surface temperature, as well as their physical interpretation. During certain therapies, the thermoregulation mechanism in humans causes a change in blood flow behaviour. Also, blood flow must be regulated during pathological conditions with the help of radiation, heat, or magnetic effects. It is found that, due to the varying viscosity parameter, the magnetic field effect inhibits heat transport in the body. It has also been found that increasing the permeability parameter enhances mass and heat transfer. The results of this paper could be important in analysing and regulating blood flow and body temperature during hypothermia and hyperthermia therapies.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103398,111,NA,NA,103398,MHD blood flow; Variable viscosity; Thermoregulation; Thermal radiation; Permeable porous lumen; Stretching capillary

Climate change is driving insect exposure to temperature extremes and understanding the effect of extreme temperatures on the biology of invasive agricultural pests will be key to predicting the effect of temperature increases. Here, we simulated diurnal cycles with different lengths of exposure times to maximum temperatures experienced in summer in different locations of California on the survivorship and development of the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) (Diaphorina citri Kuwayama). ACP is the invasive vector of Huanglongbing disease (HLB), a lethal bacterial pathogen of citrus which is currently spreading in the Los Angeles, California basin. We also tested the effect of high or low humidity at high temperatures on ACP survival and development and the effect of high temperatures on short-distance dispersal. ACP were able to complete their life cycle in all temperature treatments (28-43 degrees C) except in daily cycles when 43 degrees C was maintained for 6 h. Temperature and exposure time significantly decreased adult emergence above 40 degrees C. High temperatures significantly increased development time with longer development as exposure times to high temperatures increased. The interaction between low humidity and high temperature increased the number of emerging adults and decreased developmental times. ACP short-distance dispersal increased over time but was not affected by temperature. These results indicate that ACP are capable to develop in temperatures higher than previously reported, suggesting that increasing temperatures may reduce the invasive capacity of ACP in regions where maximum daily temperatures are increasing along with the duration of such temperatures throughout the day.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103354,110,NA,NA,103354,Temperature tolerance; Climate change; Huanglongbing; Vector dispersion; Heatwave; Invasion ecology; Thermal stress

Few studies have reported on the thermomechanical stress of biological specimens in a pre-freezing supercooled state, which is a widespread phenomenon in slow-rate freezing cryopreservation. Here, we develop a thermomechanical coupling model to study transient thermal and mechanical fields of supercooled biological specimens experiencing freezing procedures. The results show that cryoprotectant accumulation in insects causes pronounced supercooled phenomena with severe deformation and thermo-mechanical stress in the initial state of phase transition. However, the loss of freezable water induced that final deformation and stress decrease, which is beneficial to organism survival after freezing. This numerical method is proved to be a guideline for optimizing slow-rate freezing cryopreservation protocols efficiently and economi-cally. These results reveal survival mechanisms of insects with supercooled phenomena after freezing and assist researchers in exploring more valuable cryopreservation methods for biological specimens.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103352,110,NA,NA,103352,Cryopreservation; Supercooling; Phase transition; Multi-physical field coupling model; Thermomechanical stress
article,Metabolic responses to increased temperatures in three semi-aquatic turtle species from the southeastern United States,"Haskins, David L. and Tuberville, Tracey D.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Physiological maintenance of ectotherms is largely dependent on temperature. Abrupt changes in environmental conditions can cause shifts in energy budgets, with higher temperatures requiring more energy be devoted to maintenance functions, making less energy available for other activities. As a group, freshwater turtles are of conservation concern; thus, it is important to understand their physiological responses to temperature shifts, particularly given current climate change predictions. We quantified metabolic rates (MR) for three species of semi-aquatic turtles that vary in their degree of terrestriality and propensity to aestivate: chicken turtles (Deir-ochelys reticularia), eastern mud turtles (Kinosternon subrubrum), and eastern musk turtles (Sternotherus odoratus). Metabolic trials were performed using a flow-through respirometer at three environmentally-relevant temper-atures: 25 degrees C, 30 degrees C, and 35 degrees C. As expected, MRs of turtles were significantly and positively associated with increases in mass and temperature. Pairwise comparisons revealed that D. reticularia exhibited significantly higher oxygen consumption rates (VO2) relative to K. subrubrum , which had significantly higher VO2 than S. odoratus. The combination of higher metabolic rates, the tendency to terrestrially aestivate, and declining quantity of high quality thermal habitats may place some semi-aquatic turtles at a disadvantage when consid-ering future climate scenarios. Our findings, when combined with knowledge of other ecological traits, may be a useful tool for predicting relative sensitivities of turtle species to predicted climate change, particularly those species inhabiting seasonal wetlands.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103331,109,NA,NA,103331,Metabolic rate; Aestivation; Deirochelys reticularia; Kinosternon subrubrum; Sternotherus odoratus; Seasonal wetlands

The thermal responses of New Zealand cicadas do not show the same variability as cicada species in similarly diverse environments in Africa, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America nor the correlation to elevation as seen in some North American cicadas. Behavioral thermoregulation appears to be the mechanism permitting the distribution of species into specific habitats so that diverging thermal adaptation was not necessary as speciation occurred.

Its culture is seriously affected by increasing summer temperatures in recent years. Aim to investigate the effects of heat stress on apoptosis, oxidative stress, and the immune response in pikeperch. the fish were heat stressed at 30 degrees C, 32 degrees C and 34 degrees C for 2h respectively, followed by a 48h recovery period. The results showed that as temperature increased, the contents of malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the liver increased significantly. Meanwhile, acute heat stress results in progressive deleterious alterations in liver tissue, especially vascular rupture, blood infiltration, and severe vacuolation at 34 degrees C. TUNEL staining revealed that the apoptosis level increased significantly with the rising temperature. Acute heat stress significantly induced the mRNA expression of apoptosis-related genes, including tumor suppressor (p53), B-cell lymphoma-2 (bcl-2), bcl-2associated X (bax), apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (apaf-1), cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase (caspase-3 and caspase-9), and the expression of p53 was also positively correlated with bax expression and the bax/ bcl-2 ratio. Additionally, caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity increased significantly at 34 degrees C compared with the control group (23 degrees C). Innate immune genes, including tumor necrosis factor (tnf-alpha), interleukins (il-7, il-8, il-10 and il-1 beta), complement 3 (c3) were activated under acute heat stress, and H2O2 content was positively correlated with the expressions of tnf-alpha and il-1 beta. After the temperature reached again 23 degrees C, most measured indexes in heat-stressed groups didn't return to stress-free levels, and liver tissue also didn't return to its normal state in the histopathology. It was found that p53-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis pathway was triggered in pikeperch under acute heat stress, and there may be a vicious cycle between oxidative stress and inflammation.

Environmental changes, such as thermal climate change, have an adverse effect on honeybee survival. Insects can be pre-heat-treated (rapid heat hardening) with a mild heat stressor to induce Hsp gene expression and protect them from future stresses. Sixty accepted mother queen (MQ) larvae at the age of 7 days were selected and divided into two incubation treatment groups (n = 30). The control group (non-heat-treated mother queens, nH-T MQ) was maintained at 34.5 degrees C for 15 min and 70\% relative humidity (RH), and the preheat-treated (pre-heat-treated mother queens, pH-T MQ) group was subjected to 41 degrees C for 15 min and 70\% RH.

Organisms inhabiting shallow water environments, such as the commercially relevant ditch shrimp Palaemon varians, are expected to be the most affected by rising temperatures. Thus, addressing species' thermal ecology and climate extinction-risk is crucial to foster climate-smart conservation strategies for shallow water ecosystems. Here, we estimated sex-specific upper thermal tolerance limits for P. varians via the Critical Thermal Maximum method (CTmax), using loss of equilibrium as endpoint. We further calculated thermal safety margins for males and females and tested for correlations between upper thermal limits and shrimps' body size. To determine sex-biased variation in P. varians' traits (CTmax, weight and length), we compared trait variation between females and males through the coefficient of variation ratio (InCVR). Females displayed an average CTmax value 1.8\% lower than males (CTmax(females) = 37.0 degrees C vs CTmax(males) = 37.7 degrees C). This finding may be related to the larger body size exhibited by females (156\% heavier and 39\% larger than males), as both length and weight had a significant effect on CTmax. The high energetic investment of females in offspring may also contribute to the differences recorded in thermal tolerance. Overall, organisms with a smaller body-size displayed a greater tolerance to elevated temperature, thus suggesting that smaller individuals may be positively selected in warmer environments. This selection may result in a reduction of size-at-maturity and shifts in sex ratio, given the sexual dimorphism in body size of shrimps. The thermal safety margin of P. varians was narrow (similar to 2.2 degrees C for males and similar to 1.5 degrees C for females), revealing the vulnerability of this species to ocean warming and heatwaves.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103151,103,NA,NA,103151,Critical thermal maximum; Thermal safety margin; Intraspecific variability; Temperature; Global change
article,Quantitative assessment of Bell's palsy-related facial thermal asymmetry using infrared thermography: A preliminary study,"Liu, Xulong and Feng, Jinghui and Zhang, Ruohui and Luan, Jingmin and Wu, Zhenying",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The temperature distribution of normal human skin is symmetrical. Facial paralysis generally changes this thermal symmetry. The aim of this study is to analyze facial thermal asymmetry during the early onset of Bell's palsy, and to assess the feasibility of the diagnosis of early-onset Bell's palsy using infrared thermography (IRT). Fifteen subjects with Bell's palsy and 15 healthy volunteers were considered in this study. The infrared thermal images of the front, left, and right sides of all the subjects were collected and analyzed. Each group of facial thermograms was divided into 16 symmetrical regions of interest (ROIs) with respect to the left and right sides. Three different temperature difference calculation methods were used to express the degree of thermal symmetry between the left-and right-side ROIs, namely, the mean temperature difference (Delta T-roi), maximum temperature difference (Delta T-max), and minimum temperature difference (Delta T-min). Among the facial ROIs, there were significant differences in the thermal symmetries of the frontal region, medial canthus region, and infraorbital region between subjects with and without Bell's palsy (p < 0.05). Based on the results, Delta T-roi was more effective than the other two methods for the diagnosis of early-onset Bell's palsy. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of Delta T-roi in the infraorbital region was 0.818; and the sensitivity and specificity were 0.867 and 0.800, respectively. Subjects with early-onset Bell's palsy exhibited thermal asymmetry on the left and right sides of their faces. The diagnosis of early-onset Bell's palsy using IRT is therefore necessary. Nevertheless, more effective thermal symmetry analysis methods will be investigated further in future research.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103070,100,NA,NA,103070,Infrared thermal imaging; Facial paralysis; Thermal symmetry; Skin temperature; Temperature difference
article,The heat shock response shows plasticity in embryonic lake whitefish (<i>Coregonus clupeaformis</i>) exposed to repeated thermal stress,"Sessions, Katherine J. and Whitehouse, Lindy M. and Manzon, Lori A. and Boreham, Douglas R. and Somers, Christopher M. and Wilson, Joanna Y. and Manzon, Richard G.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"We examined the impact of repeated thermal stress on the heat shock response (HSR) of thermally sensitive lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) embryos. Our treatments were designed to mimic temperature fluctuations in the vicinity of industrial thermal effluents. Embryos were either maintained at control temperatures (3 degrees C) or exposed to a repeated thermal stress (TS) of 3 or 6 degrees C above control temperature every 3 or 6 days throughout embryonic development. At 82 days post-fertilisation, repeated TS treatments were stopped and embryos received either a high level TS of 12, 15, or 18 degrees C above ambient temperature for 1 or 4 h, or no additional TS. These treatments were carried out after a 6 h recovery from the last repeated TS. Embryos in the no repeated TS group responded, as expected, with increases in hsp70 mRNA in response to 12, 15 and 18 degrees C high-level TS. However, exposure to repeated TS of 3 or 6 C every 6 days also resulted in a significant upregulation of hsp70 mRNA relative to the controls. Importantly, these repeated TS events and the associated elevations in hsp70 attenuated the upregulation of hsp70 in response to a 1 h, high-level TS of 12 degrees C above ambient, but not to either longer (4 h) or higher (15 or 18 degrees C) TS events. Conversely, hsp90 alpha mRNA levels were not consistently elevated in the no repeated TS groups exposed to high-level TS. In some instances, hsp90 alpha levels appeared to decrease in embryos exposed to repeated TS followed by a high-level TS. The observed attenuation of the HSR in lake whitefish embryos demonstrates that embryos of this species have plasticity in their HSR and repeated TS may protect against high-level TS, but the response differs based on repeated TS treatment, high-level TS temperature and duration, and the gene of interest.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103036,100,NA,NA,103036,Repeated thermal stress; Embryos; Lake whitefish; Heat shock proteins; Plasticity

E. and van Jaarsveld, Barry and Bennett, Nigel C. and Hart, Daniel W.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The effect of the macro- and micmclimate on small mammal thermoregulation in the past has been studied independently instead of investigating the dual effect of both the components. This study addresses this dearth in knowledge by exploring the dual effect of both micro- and macro-climate on the thermoregulatory responses of two subterranean rodent species belonging to the family Bathyergidae, namely the more arid dwelling Mahali mole-rat (Cryptomys hottentotus mahali) and less arid dwelling Highveld mole-rat (C. h. pretoriae). Open flow through respirometry was used to quantify resting metabolic rates (RMR), evaporative water loss (EWL), core body temperature (Tb), the ratio between the evaporative heat loss and metabolic heat production (EHL/MHP: evaporative cooling capacity) and conductance (C-dry) over a range of increasing ambient temperatures (T-a; 20-42 degrees C). Furthermore, RMR, EWL, T-b, EHL/MHP and C-dry were measured at the mole-rat's thermal maxima (43 degrees C). At cooler temperatures, the arid-dwelling C. h. mahali possesses a broader thermoneutral zone (similar to 5 degrees C; 27.2-32.1 degrees C), while C. h. pretoriae possess a single thermoneutral point (33.6 degrees C). This is in response to the greater selection pressure to conserve energy in the more arid regions inhabited by C. h. mahali. Contrastingly, at hotter temperatures, there were no significant thermoregulatory differences in EWL, EHL/MHP or C-dry responses between the two sub-species, as expected due to the limitations bestowed by the buffered microclimates (burrow systems). Thus, neither macro-climate, nor micro-climate singularly moulds the thermoregulatory adaptations, but rather, it appears to be a combined effect from both climates. Other small endotherms may share this dual response, and therefore, it is crucial to incorporate the effect of both macro- and microclimates into future climate models when determining the ecological capabilities and persistence of a species.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103025,99,NA,NA,103025,Thermoregulation; Macroclimate; Microclimate; Mole-rat; Heat dissipation; Thermoneutral zone

Notothenioid fish have been proposed as particularly sensitive to temperature increases related to global climate change. However, there are large gaps in our understanding of the thermal responses of these extreme cold-adapted fish in assays with heating rates. We evaluated the effects of two commonly used heating rates (0.3 and 1 degrees C/min) on the cellular stress responses in the intertidal Antarctic fish Harpagifer antarcticus immediately after CTMax was reached, and at 2 and 4 h of recovery time in ambient water. We compared CTMax values, the relative transcript expression of genes relvant to heat shock response (Hsc70, Hsp70, Grp78), hypoxia (Hif1-alpha, LDHa, GR), ubiquitination (Ube2), and apoptosis (SMAC/DIABLO), and five plasma parameters - glucose, lactate, total protein, osmolality and cortisol. CTMax values between the two heating rates are not significantly different, and both rates elicited a similar stress response at molecular and physiological levels. We found a lack of up-regulated response of heat shock proteins, consistent with other Antarctic notothenioids. The general transcriptional pattern trended to downregulation, which was more evident in the slower 0.3 degrees C/min rate, and instances of upregulation were mainly related to ubiquitination. The faster 1 degrees C/min rate, rarely used for Antarctic fish, can be suitable for studying cold-adapted stenothermic fish without overestimating thermal tolerance or inducing damage from longer heat exposure.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103021,99,NA,NA,103021,Global climate change; Ectotherms; Plunder fish; Physiology; mRNA

As T. catalanensis is subjected to variable thermal conditions along its distribution and may be jeopardized by the climate change, we measured its thermal preferences after exposure to milder (17 degrees C-27 degrees C) and warmer (22 degrees C-32 degrees C) thermal conditions to evaluate acclimatory responses and tolerances and vulnerabilities to warming. Field body temperatures tended to be similar to minimum preferred body temperatures, and microhabitat and body temperatures in the field were cooler in the remaining comparisons with thermal preferences {[}preferred (T-pref), set-point range (T-set), minimum preferred (T-pref\_min) and maximum preferred (T-pref\_max) body temperatures], suggesting there was a constraint to warming up in nature. The minimum preferred body temperatures may be a threshold separating proper functioning from markedly noxious impacts due to progressive impairment by the cooling. Difficulties to warm and keep suitable body temperatures may jeopardize overall ecophysiological and behavioral processes with implications for maintenance, fitness, and survival. The constraints to warm may impact T. catalanensis differently depending on its body size and its properties of heat conservation (thermal inertia). Smaller and larger T. catalanensis may respectively cool down easier and have difficulties to warm up, being jeopardized by the constraints due to the cold. The warmer preferred body temperatures coupled with the cooler microhabitats and bodies in nature complicate to anticipate how individuals will respond to climate change, but the acclimation to the warmer temperatures led six of them to death, suggesting they had limited tolerance to heat and would be vulnerable to global warming.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102903,98,NA,NA,102903,Body temperature; Body temperature regulation; Microhabitat temperature; Thermal preferences; Thermal tolerance; Thermoregulation

For the hatching study, eggs were incubated in four temperatures (17, 20, 23, and 26 degrees C). The total hatching and free-swimming larvae percentage were higher at 23 degrees C (p < 0.05). Experiment I (for validation of the CTmax method) was carried out by incubating eggs at 17 degrees C and 23 degrees C. The CTmax was estimated in response to different warming rates (1-18 degrees C h(-1)), acclimation temperatures (17 and 23 degrees C), and the age of fishes (8, 15, 35 dph). The results suggested that a warming rate of 18 degrees C h(-1) could be used for the thermal tolerance study of yolk-sac larvae (8 dph) and 35 dph larvae, but for free-swimming larvae (15 dph) up to 3 degrees C h(-1) is suitable. Experiment II (for growth, SMR and thermal tolerance) was carried by acclimatizing 15 dph larvae in five temperatures (15, 19, 23, 27, and 31 degrees C) for 60 days. The mean growth rate increased with the increase in temperature from 15 degrees C to 27 degrees C (1.30-3.58\% day(-1)) and decreased at 31 degrees C. The mean SMR of the chocolate mahseer in the above acclimation temperatures was ranged from 1.14 +/- 0.36 to 2.81 +/- 0.15 mu gO(2)h(-1)mg(-1) and were significantly different (p < 0.01). The Q(10) with the SMR of the fish suggested the preferred temperature ranged between 23 and 27 degrees C, and the optimum temperature for growth (ToptG) was estimated to be 25 degrees C. Chocolate mahseer is an eurythermal species which is advantageous for aquaculture practices due to its wide thermal tolerance zone (411.68 degrees C-2 in 15 to 31 degrees C acclimation temperature range) and high ARR values (0.49 - 0.54).",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102942,98,NA,NA,102942,CTmax; CTmin; Warming rate; Thermal polygon; Incubation temperature; Growth; SMR

However, until now, no study has tested the effect of the fungicide mancozeb (MZ) on thermal tolerance and its relationship with the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs). MZ is the best-selling broad-spectrum fungicide in the world, which negatively affects non-target organisms. Here, we tested for the first time the effects of MZ on critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and its relationship to the expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in tadpoles of Physalameus henselii, a colder-adapted species in southernmost of the Neotropical region. A sublethal concentration of 2 mg/L was used. We found that the CTmax of the MZ-treated group was lower than that of the control group. In addition, there was an increase in HSP70 expression in tadpoles exposed to MZ and in tadpoles that underwent heat treatment. However, tadpoles subjected to MZ and heat treatment showed no induced HSP70 protein expression. Our results demonstrated that sublethal doses of the fungicide MZ negatively affected the thermal physiology and heat shock protein expression in tadpoles of P. henselii by inducing an increase in HSP70 concentration and by reducing the critical CTmax supported by tadpoles. It is important to understand the relationship between environmental contamination and physiological thermal limits in our current scenario of high rates of habitat conversion associated with unrestricted use of agrochemicals, as well as the challenging environmental changes induced by global warming.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102911,98,NA,NA,102911,Ecotoxicity; Thermal tolerance; CTmax; Agrochemical contamination; Neotropical anuran

In chickens, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the av-UCP (avian UCP) gene has been reported to be associated with body weight gain and increased abdominal fat. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the av-UCP gene SNP and heat production in chicks. Methods: C/C and T/T male chicks (Rhode Island Red) of av-UCP gene SNP (g. 1270, C > T) were exposed to a low temperature environment (16 degrees C for 15 min) and their physiological responses were compared. Results: After cold exposure, mean rectal temperatures of C/C chicks were higher than those of T/T chicks. In pectoral muscle, genes expression of av-UCP and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 were higher in C/C chicks than T/T chicks. Hypothalamic expression levels of thyrotropin-releasing hormone and proopiomelanocortin genes were higher in C/C chicks than T/T chicks. Expression of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone, arginine vasotocin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neuropeptide Y genes did not differ between C/C and T/T chicks. In addition, plasma free fatty acid levels in C/C chicks were lower than those of T/T chicks. Conclusion: These results suggest that the av-UCP gene SNP affects non-shivering heat production via the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid axis and fatty acid metabolism in the chicken.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102909,98,NA,NA,102909,Avian UCP; Polymorphism; Thermogenesis; Cold stress; Chicks

This paper presents the novel use of thermography in ophthalmology - using a thermal camera to assess correct intraocular pressure measurement depending on the position of the patient?s head during non-contact tonometry. For the analysed group of 10 healthy subjects, thermographic images of the face were recorded before and after intraocular pressure testing. Pressure was tested with a non-contact tonometer with a Scheimpflug camera. For the acquired 20: 2D images (thermograms), an analysis of the characteristic areas of the face determined temperature changes of the patient?s face in contact with the tonometer frame. Analysis and processing of the acquired thermograms was carried out in MATLAB? with the Image Processing Toolbox. The results clearly showed a decrease in the patient?s face temperature where the face was in contact with tonometer supports. Temperature changes in the patient?s face provide valuable information about the correct position of their head in the device, which directly translates into measurement quality.

However, the reestablishment of scrotal thermoregulation and the dynamics of sperm defects emergence after stress are not completely known in buffaloes. Thus, the study aimed to evaluate the effect of short-term heat stress over scrotal thermoregulation and sperm attributes, relating them to spermatogenesis stages. Five buffalo bulls went through scrotal insulation during 48 h (from day 0 to day 2). Semen samples were collected every 7 days (from day 7 to day 49) and analyzed about the progressive motility, viability, and sperm morphology. Heat stress significantly destabilized scrotal thermoregulation (P < 0.001). Scrotal temperature was from 4.2 to 6.3 degrees C lower than the core body temperature, except on insulation days (P < 0.001), and returned to the basal condition five days after the removal of the stressing stimulus. More significant deleterious effects were observed in sperm morphology than in cell concentration, motility, and viability. The chronology of morphologic defects expression demonstrated tail defects (days 7-14), cytoplasmic droplets (days 14-28), and head defects (day 28), returning to pre-insulation condition 35 days after the thermal challenge. Thus, hyperthermia harmed more intensely spermatozoa in epididymal transit, elongated spermatids, and secondary spermatocytes. It is concluded that water buffalo bulls present a peculiar manifestation of sperm morphology after short-term stress, indicating an important difference related to the bovine species. Therefore, during the andrological evaluation of buffalo bulls, it is necessary to avoid the allometric extrapolation between these species.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102842,96,NA,NA,102842,Thermal stress; Thermoregulation; Water buffalo; Spermiogram; Sperm morphology

Deaths caused by heatwaves were found to be higher than those resulting from avalanches, exposure to cold, cyclone, tornado, starvation due to natural calamity, earthquake, epidemic, flood, landslide, torrential rain and forest fire. The study revealed that there are regional variations in the number deaths due to heatstroke. From the perspective of disaster preparedness, it is important to note that deaths from heat strokes occur every year. With rising temperatures, the numbers are likely to increase.

article,Are southern African solitary mole-rats homeothermic or heterothermic under natural field conditions?,"Okrouhlik, Jan and Sumbera, Radim and Gardner, Brett and Schoemann, Keegan and Lovy, Matej and Bennett, Nigel Charles",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Abandoning of a stable body temperature (T-b), a phenomenon known as hetemthermy, is an adaptation to cope mainly with a lack of food and water, especially in species inhabiting daily or seasonally variable environments. There is increasing evidence that African mammals avoid adverse conditions by heterothermy and eventually by entering torpor. Members of subterranean rodent family, the African mole-rats (Bathyergidae), are suitable candidates to study both phenomena, because of the diversity of their strategies in respect of maintaining stable T-b ranging from homeothermic species to a mammal with the most labile T-b, the naked mole-rat. Currently, there are field data on daily and seasonal T-b in one social species only and such information are lacking for any solitary mole-rat. In our study, we recorded yearly T-b in two solitary bathyergids, the Cape mole-rat Georychus capensis and the Cape dune mole-rat Bathyergus suillus from South Africa using intraperitoneally implanted dataloggers. Since this region is characterised by changing ecological characteristics, we expected either decreases of T-b within 24 h indicating daily torpor and/or longer-term decreases of T-b, which would indicate multiday torpor. Although we found seasonally phase shifted low amplitude daily T-b cycles, we did not find any remarkable and regular daily and/or seasonal T-b deviations, likely showing an absence of torpor in both species. Due to absence of this energy saving mechanism, we may speculate that both species could be vulnerable to ongoing global climatic change.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102810,95,NA,NA,102810,Bathyergus suillus; Body temperature; Georychus capensis; Heterothermy; Torpor

In aquaculture this frequently manifests in an animal welfare crisis, with fish increasingly farmed under high production, high stress conditions. These intense environments can result in fish stocks having a high susceptibility to infection, with parasites and associated disease one of the main factors limiting industry growth. Prediction of infection dynamics is key to preventative treatment and mitigation. Considering the climatic and technology driven changes facing aquaculture, an understanding of how parasites react across a spectrum of conditions is required. Here we assessed the impact of temperature, infection density and host species on the life history traits of Argulus foliaceus, a common palearctic fish louse, representative of a parasite group problematic in freshwater aquaculture and fisheries worldwide. Temperature significantly affected development, growth and survival; parasites hatched and developed faster at higher temperatures, but also experienced shorter lifespans when maintained off the host. At high temperatures, these parasites will likely experience a short generation time as their life history traits are completed more rapidly. A. foliaceus additionally grew faster on natural hosts and at lower infection densities. Ultimately such results contribute to prediction of population dynamics, aiding development of effective control to improve animal welfare and reduce industry loss.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102687,92,NA,NA,102687,Life history; Aquaculture; Climate change; Fish pathogen; Infectious disease

Reptiles inhabiting tropical highlands face extreme fluctuating daily temperatures, and extreme values and intervals of fluctuations vary with altitude. Anolis heterodermus occurs between 1800 m to 3750 m elevation in the tropical Andes, and is the Anolis species found at the highest altitude known. We evaluated which strategies populations from elevations of 2200 m, 2650 m and 3400 m use to cope with environmental temperatures. We measured body, preferred, critical maximum and minimum temperatures, and sprint speed at different body temperatures of individuals, as well as operative temperatures. Anolis heterodermus exhibits behavioral adjustments in response to changes in environmental temperatures across altitudes. Likewise, physiological traits exhibit intrapopulation variations, but they are similar among populations, tended to the ``static{''} side of the evolution of thermal traits spectrum. The thermoregulatory behavioral strategy in this species is extremely plastic, and lizards adjust even to fluctuating environmental conditions from day to day. Unlike other Anolis species, at low thermal quality of the habitat, lizards are thermoconformers, particularly at the highest altitudes, where cloudy days can intensify this strategy even more. Our study reveals that the pattern of strategies for dealing with thermal ambient variations and their relation to extinction risks in the tropics that are caused by global warming is perhaps more complex for lizards than previously thought.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102498,89,NA,NA,102498,Temperature fluctuation; Physiological traits; Behavioral strategy; Tropical highlands; Anolis

The purpose of the present study is to delineate the physiological response and changes in energy allocation strategy of Bellamya bengalensis, a freshwater gastropod in the anticipated summer elevated temperature in the future by measuring the growth, body conditions (change in total weight, change in organ to flesh weight ratio), physiological energetics (ingestion rate, absorption rate, respiration rate, excretion rate and Scope for Growth) and thermal performance, Arrhenius breakpoint temperature (ABT), thermal critical maxima (CTmax), warming tolerance (WT) as well as thermal safety margin (TSM) through a mesocosm experiment. We exposed the animals to three different temperatures, 25 degrees C (average habitat temperature for this animal) and elevated temperatures 30 degrees C, 35 degrees C for 30 days and changes in energy budget were measured twice (on 15th and 30th day). Significant changes were observed in body conditions as well as physiological energetics. The total body weight as well as the organ/flesh weight ratio, ingestion followed by absorption rate decreased whereas, respiration and excretion rate increased with elevated temperature treatments resulting in a negative Scope for Growth in adverse conditions. Though no profound impact was found on ABT/CTmax, the peak of thermal curve was considerably declined for animals that were reared in higher temperature treatments.

article,"Accuracy of an inexpensive, compact infrared thermometer for measuring skin surface temperature of small lizards","Chukwuka, Christian O. and Virens, Evelyn and Cree, Alison",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Studies of thermal sensitivity in ectotherms require accurate measurements of body temperature using a reliable device, including in field situations. In this study, we tested the accuracy of a compact and inexpensive mini-infrared thermometer (mini-IRT, 22.3 g) at close distance (within 5 mm) for measuring skin surface temperature of small lizards or their models (painted copper bars). First, we used copper bars to assess the effect of model width on the accuracy of the measurement. We placed the heated models on a cool background, and then surface temperatures were measured with a mini-IRT for comparison with a thermogram from an infrared camera (IRC). We also assessed the accuracy of the mini-IRT for measuring skin temperature for two species of small lizards in the laboratory and in the field, in comparison with the skin surface temperature measured with the IRC and with cloacal temperature measured with a thermocouple thermometer. Our results with inanimate models show that the accuracy of the mini-IRT at a distance within 5 mm is biologically acceptable (within +/- 1.0 degrees C of the mean value obtained using a more expensive, calibrated device) when the width is >= 7 mm. For live lizards, we observed highly significant relationships between skin surface temperature measured with the mini-IRT and temperatures measured with the two other devices. The mean discrepancies between the mini-IRT and other devices were acceptably small for geckos but larger for the smaller and more slender skinks. Taken together, our results suggest that skin temperature measured with the mini-IRT at a close distance is acceptable for field studies on lizards with an abdominal width >= 7 min, serving as an inexpensive proxy for core body temperature in situations where portability and affordability of equipment and minimal animal handling are paramount. Nonetheless, calibration of mini-IRTs before use is strongly recommended.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.016,84,NA,285-291,NA,Copper model; Thermogram; Body temperature; Gecko; Skink; Infrared camera
article,Combined local hypothermia and recanalization therapy for acute ischemic stroke: Estimation of brain and systemic temperature using an energetic numerical model,"Lutz, Yannick and Loewe, Axel and Meckel, Stephan and Doessel, Olaf and Cattaneo, Giorgio",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Local brain hypothermia is an attractive method for providing cerebral neuroprotection for ischemic stroke patients and at the same time reducing systemic side effects of cooling. In acute ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusion, combination with endovascular mechanical recanalization treatment could potentially allow for an alleviation of inflammatory and apoptotic pathways in the critical phase of reperfusion. The direct cooling of arterial blood by means of an intra-carotid heat exchange catheter compatible with recanalization systems is a novel promising approach. Focusing on the concept of ``cold reperfusion{''}, we developed an energetic model to calculate the rate of temperature decrease during intra-carotid cooling in case of physiological as well as decreased perfusion. Additionally, we discussed and considered the effect and biological significance of temperature decrease on resulting brain perfusion. Our model predicted a 2 degrees C brain temperature decrease in 8.3, 11.8 and 26.2 min at perfusion rates of 50, 30 and 10 ml/100g.min , respectively. The systemic temperature decrease - caused by the venous blood return to the main circulation - was limited to 0.5 degrees C in 60 min. Our results underline the potential of catheter-assisted, intracarotid blood cooling to provide a fast and selective brain temperature decrease in the phase of vessel recanalization. This method can potentially allow for a tissue hypothermia during the restoration of the physiological flow and thus a ``cold reperfusion{''} in the setting of mechanical recanalization.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.06.011,84,NA,316-322,NA,Stroke; Target temperature management; Heat transfer; Bio heat equation; Mechanical thrombectomy; Physiological regulation

However, in warm adaptation, ambient temperature cannot directly activate BAT by sympathetic nervous system. Mongolian gerbils exhibit a wider thermoneutral zone (26.5-38.9 degrees C). We hypothesized that BAT atrophied near the lower critical temperature and further atrophied near the upper critical temperature. Male gerbils were acclimated to 23 degrees C, 27 degrees C or 37 degrees C, respectively, for 3 weeks. Results showed that regulatory non-shivering thermogenesis did not change in gerbils acclimated to 27 degrees C compared with 23 degrees C group, whereas it was reduced by 43.5\% in gerbils acclimated to 37 degrees C. Bigger lipid droplet in BAT was observed in gerbils acclimated to 27 degrees C and 37 degrees C compared with 23 degrees C group, while the expression of uncoupling protein 1 and tyrosine hydroxylase was only reduced in gerbils acclimated to 37 degrees C. Further, thermoneutral acclimation did not change BAT thermogenesis by down-regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha, PR domain containing 16, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha or peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma gene expression in BAT. In addition, body temperature was reduced in gerbils acclimated to 37 degrees C compared with 23 degrees C group, which was associated with a decreased resting metabolic rate and regulatory non-shivering thermogenesis. In conclusion, BAT does not atrophy near the lower critical temperature, whereas it atrophies near the upper critical temperature, suggesting that BAT may play thermoregulatory role within the TNZ in Mongolian gerbils.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.02.015,81,NA,137-145,NA,Brown adipose tissue; Thermoneutral zone; Uncoupling protein 1; Tyrosine hydroxylase; Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus)
article,Exploring the human thermoneutral zone - A dynamic approach,"Pallubinsky, H. and Schellen, L. and Lichtenbelt, W. D. van Marken",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"To date, the position and shape of the human thermoneutral zone (TNZ) remain uncertain. Indications exist that the individual TNZ might be influenced by age, body composition and level of acclimatisation. The objective of the present study was to explore the individual metabolic TNZ, using dynamic thermal conditions to assess both metabolic lower and upper critical temperatures (LCT and UCT) and, secondly, to test the effect of passive mild heat acclimation on the human metabolic TNZ. A dynamic protocol consisting of two experimental conditions was designed: starting from a thermoneutral condition (28.8 +/- 0.3 degrees C), temperature gradually increased to 37.5 +/- 0.6 degrees C during warming (UP) or decreased to 17.8 +/- 0.6 degrees C during cooling (DOWN). For six participants, temperature increased further to 41.6 +/- 1.0 degrees C during UP. Eleven healthy men (19-31 y) underwent UP and DOWN twice, i.e. before and after passive mild heat acclimation (PMHA, 7 days at similar to 33 degrees C for 6 h/day). Energy expenditure, body temperatures and heart rate were measured during UP and DOWN. We show that the generally assumed LCT of approximately 28 degrees C for an average male person does not match the dynamically assessed LCTs in this study, as those were considerably lower in most cases (23.3 +/- 3.2 degrees C pre-acclimation; 23.4 +/- 2.0 degrees C post-acclimation). Distinct inter-individual variation of the dynamic LCT was evident (range pre-PMHA:9.7 degrees C; post-PMHA:5.4 degrees C). Regarding the metabolic response to increasing temperatures, only minor or no increases in energy metabolism occurred. PMHA did not significantly change the positioning of the LCTs, but lowered Tcore (pre-PMHA: -0.13 +/- 0.13 degrees C, P = 0.011; post-PMHA: -0.14 +/- 0.15 degrees C, P = 0.026) and affected skin temperature distribution. The applied method allowed for the determination of individual dynamic LCTs, however, distinct metabolic UCTs were not evident in humans. For a better understanding of the human UCT, future studies should incorporate individualised temperature ranges and also a measurement of evaporative heat loss, to allow for a two-factor analysis of both metabolic and evaporative human UCT.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.12.014,79,NA,199-208,NA,NA

Despite the broad, negative impact of prolonged hyperthermia little is known about underlying pathological mechanisms leading to negative health outcomes, which has limited the development of etiological interventions and left clinicians and producers with only cooling and rehydration strategies. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the extent to which prolonged environment-induced hyperthermia altered autophagy in oxidative skeletal muscle in a large animal model, serving the dual purpose of accurately modeling human physiology as well as agricultural production. We hypothesized that prolonged hyperthermia would induce autophagy in skeletal muscle, independent of the accompanying caloric restriction. To test this hypothesis pigs were treated as follows: thermoneutral (20 degrees C), heat stress (35 degrees C), or were held under thermoneutral conditions but pair-fed to the heat stress group for seven days. Upon euthanasia the red portion of the semitendinosus was collected. We found that prolonged hyperthermic exposure increased oxidative stress without a corresponding change in antioxidant enzyme activities. Hyperthermia prevented initiation of autophagy despite increased markers of nucleation, elongation and autophagosome formation. However, p62 relative protein abundance, which is inversely correlated with autophagic degradation, was strongly increased suggesting suppressed degradation of autophagosomes. Markers of mitophagy and mitochondrial abundance were largely similar between groups. These data indicate that faulty autophagy plays a key role in hyperthermic muscle dysfunction.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.03.007,74,NA,160-169,NA,Heat stress; Oxidative stress; Autophagy; Mitochondria; Mitophagy
article,A new method of estimating thermal performance of embryonic development rate yields accurate prediction of embryonic age in wild reptile nests,"Rollinson, Njal and Holt, Sarah M. and Massey, Melanie D. and Holt, Richard C. and Nancekivell, E. Graham and Brooks, Ronald J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature has a strong effect on ectotherm development rate. It is therefore possible to construct predictive models of development that rely solely on temperature, which have applications in a range of biological fields. Here, we leverage a reference series of development stages for embryos of the turtle Chelydra serpentina, which was described at a constant temperature of 20 degrees C. The reference series acts to map each distinct developmental stage onto embryonic age (in days) at 20 degrees C. By extension, an embryo taken from any given incubation environment, once staged, can be assigned an equivalent age at 20 degrees C. We call this concept ``Equivalent Development{''}, as it maps the development stage of an embryo incubated at a given temperature to its equivalent age at a reference temperature. In the laboratory, we used the concept of Equivalent Development to estimate development rate of embryos of C. serpentina across a series of constant temperatures. Using these estimates of development rate, we created a thermal performance curve measured in units of Equivalent Development (TPCED). We then used the TPCED to predict developmental stage of embryos in several natural turtle nests across six years. We found that 85\% of the variation of development stage in natural nests could be explained. Further, we compared the predictive accuracy of the model based on the TPCED to the predictive accuracy of a degree-day model, where development is assumed to be linearly related to temperature and the amount of accumulated heat is summed over time. Information theory suggested that the model based on the TPCED better describes variation in developmental stage in wild nests than the degree-day model. We suggest the concept of Equivalent Development has several strengths and can be broadly applied. In particular, studies on temperature-dependent sex determination may be facilitated by the concept of Equivalent Development, as development age maps directly onto the developmental series of the organism, allowing critical periods of sex determination to be delineated without invasive sampling, even under fluctuating temperature.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.03.008,74,NA,187-194,NA,Thermal performance; Incubation; Reptile; Heat units; Fluctuating temperature; Turtle; Sex determination
article,Temperature effects on aerobic scope and cardiac performance of European perch (<i>Perca fluviatilis</i>),"Jensen, Denise Lyager and Overgaard, Johannes and Wang, Tobias and Gesser, Hans and Malte, Hans",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Several recent studies have highlighted how impaired cardiac performance at high temperatures and in hypoxia may compromise the capacity for oxygen transport. Thus, at high temperatures impaired cardiac capacity is proposed to reduce oxygen transport to a degree that lowers aerobic scope and compromises thermal tolerance (the oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT) hypothesis). To investigate this hypothesis, we measured aerobic and cardiac performance of a eurythermal freshwater teleost, the European perch (Perca fluviatilis). Rates of oxygen consumption were measured during rest and activity at temperatures between 5 degrees C and 27 degrees C, and we evaluated cardiac function by in vivo measurements of heart rate and in vitro studies to determine contractility of myocardial strips. Aerobic scope increased progressively from 5 degrees C to 21 degrees C, after which it levelled off. Heart rate showed a similar response. We found little difference between resting and active heart rate at high temperature suggesting that increased cardiac scope during activity is primarily related to changes in stroke volume. To examine the effects of temperature on cardiac capacity, we measured isometric force development in electrically paced myocardial preparations during different combinations of temperature, pacing frequency, oxygenation and adrenergic stimulation. The force-frequency product increased markedly upon adrenergic stimulation at 21 and 27 degrees C (with higher effects at 21 degrees C) and the cardiac preparations were highly sensitive to hypoxia. These findings suggest that at (critically) high temperatures, cardiac output may diminish due to a decreased effect of adrenergic stimulation and that this effect may be further exacerbated if the heart becomes hypoxic. Hence cardiac limitations may contribute to the inability to increase aerobic scope at high temperatures in the European perch (Perca fluviatilis).",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.04.006,68,"B, SI",162-169,NA,NA

Sympatric lizards often partition their niche and select different microhabitats. These microhabitats, however, usually differ in their thermal conditions and lizards have to adapt their thermoregulation behavior accordingly. Here, we evaluated the impact of habitat partitioning on the thermal biology of three syntopic, congeneric lacertids (Podarcis peloponnesiacus, P. tauricus and P. muralis) from central Peloponnese, Greece. We assessed thermoregulation effectiveness (E) using the three standard thermal parameters: body (T-b), operative (T-e) and preferred (T-pref) temperatures. We hypothesized that the microhabitats used by each species would differ in thermal quality. We also predicted that all species would effectively thermoregulate, as they inhabit a thermally challenging mountain habitat. As expected, the partition of the habitat had an effect on the thermoregulation of lizards since microhabitats had different thermal qualities. All three species were effective and accurate thermoregulators but one of them achieved smaller E values as a result of the lower T-b in the field. This discrepancy could be attributed to the cooler (but more benign) thermal microhabitats that this species occupies.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.02.014,65,NA,130-137,NA,Microhabitat; Lacertidae; Sympatry; Thermal adaptation; Greece
article,Has contemporary climate change played a role in population declines of the lizard <i>Ctenophorus decresii</i> from semi-arid Australia?,"Walker, Samantha and Stuart-Fox, Devi and Kearney, Michael R.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Whilst contemporary climatic changes are small in magnitude compared to those predicted for the coming decades, they have already been linked to species range shifts and local extinctions. Elucidating the drivers behind species' responses to contemporary climate change will better inform management strategies for vulnerable and pest species alike. A recent proposal to explain worldwide local extinctions in lizards is that increasing maximum temperatures have constrained lizard activity time in the breeding season beyond extinction thresholds. Here we document a significant population decline and potential local extinction at the warm (northern) range margin of the tawny dragon, Ctenophorus decresii, a rock-dwelling lizard from the Flinders Ranges in semi-arid Australia. We developed and tested a biophysical model of tawny dragon thermoregulatory behaviour and drove the model with daily weather data for the period 1990-2009 across the Flinders Ranges. Our results indicate that potential annual activity time has likely increased over this period throughout the historic range, with within-season declines only in the summer months at the northern range limit. However, populations that have declined since 2000 have also likely experienced higher active body temperatures and more stringent retreat-site requirements (deeper crevices) than have regions where the species remains common, during a period of declining rainfall. Our laboratory estimates of thermal preference in this species were insensitive to altered nutritional and hydric state. Thus it is possible that recent population declines are linked to desiccation stress driven by higher body temperatures and declining rainfall. Our study illustrates that simple indices of the impact of climate warming on animals, such as activity restriction, may in fact reflect a variety of potential mechanisms whose ultimate outcome will be contingent on other factors such as water and shelter availability.

article,"Influence of water temperature and waterborne cadmium toxicity on growth performance and metallothionein-cadmium distribution in different organs of Nile tilapia, <i>Oreochromis niloticus</i> (L.)","Abdel-Tawwab, Mohsen and Wafeek, Mohammed",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Cadmium (Cd) is believed to be one of the most abundant and ubiquitously distributed toxins in the aquatic system. This metal is released to the aquatic environment from both anthropogenic sources, such as industrial, agricultural and urban effluents as well as natural sources, such as rocks and soils. Otherwise, the temperature increase of water bodies, which has been observed due to global climatic changes, has been shown to increase Cd toxicity for several aquatic animal species including fish. In the present study. Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloricus (L), (26.0 +/- 0.38 g) were reared at 20, 24, 28, or 32 degrees C and exposed to 0.0 or 0.5 mg Cd/L for 8 weeks to investigate effects of water temperature, Cd toxicity and their interaction on fish performance as well as metallothionein (MT) and Cd distribution in different fish organs. It was found that fish reared in Cd-free group at 28 degrees C showed the optimum growth and feed intake, while Cd-exposed fish showed low growth and feed intake irrespective to water temperature. A synergetic relationship between water temperature and Cd toxicity was observed where Cd toxicity increased as water temperature increased and the worse growth was obtained in Cd-exposed fish reared at 32 degrees C. Additionally, the highest Cd residues in different fish organs were detected in Cd-exposed fish reared at 32 degrees C. Similarly, MT concentrations in different fish organs increased as water temperature increased especially in Cd-exposed fish groups. A high positive correlation between MT and Cd concentrations in fish organs was detected. The distribution of MT and Cd levels was in the order of liver > kidney > gills > muscles. The present study revealed that the optimum water temperature suitable for Nile tilapia growth is 28 degrees C. Additionally, Cd exposure had a deteriorate effect on the growth and health of Nile tilapia. This hazardous effect increased as water temperature increased. Further, liver and kidney were the prime sites of Cd accumulation, while Cd load in the muscles was the lowest as compared to the other investigated organs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study we evaluated and described the effects of temperature during early development of E. chloroticus, identifying the optimum temperature range and upper thermal limit for successful development. The temperature range evaluated was between 15-24 degrees C which included the normal seawater temperatures during the spawning season in northern New Zealand, as well as the highest temperature projected by the IPCC for this region due to global warming (1-3 degrees C by the year 2100). Gametes from several females and males were used in the experiment. Fertilization was carried out at different temperatures and development was monitored at different time points after fertilization in each temperature. The development rate of E. chloroticus increased with an increase in seawater temperature. However, at temperatures higher than 21.5 degrees C the amount of abnormal development reached similar to 30\%. The optimum temperature for early development was between 15-21 degrees C, whereas the upper thermal limit was similar to 24 degrees C. Therefore, early development of E. chloroticus is negatively affected by an increase in seawater temperature of similar to 3-4 degrees C above current seawater temperature levels in northern New Zealand. The thermal sensitivity of early life stages of E. chloroticus could affect survival rates during early development of this species in a global warming scenario, which could impair recruitment in populations which are exposed to higher temperatures, leading to possible distributional shifts of this species.

Studies of phenotypic flexibility have focused on winter acclimatization and cold endurance, and there are fewer data on summer acclimatization and adjustments in heat dissipation capacity, especially in Temperate-Zone species. We used indirect calorimetry and thermometry to test if thermoregulation at high air temperatures (Ta) T a ) varies between spring and summer in four species of European vespertilionid bats: Nyctalus noctula, , Pipistrellus nathusii, , P . pygmaeus, , and P . pipistrellus. . We measured subcutaneous body temperature (Tsub), T sub ), evaporative water loss, and resting metabolic rate while exposing bats to a stepped profile of increasing T a , from 28 degrees C-48 degrees C. We predicted that during summer, bats increase heat tolerance and evaporative cooling capacity, to better tolerate hotter T a s. In contrast, we found lower maximum ratios of evaporative heat loss (EHL) to metabolic heat production (MHP) during summer, but no seasonal differences in maximum T a tolerated or T sub . The main cause of this seasonal difference in maximum EHL/MHP seems to be from bats increasing EWL more gradually with increasing T a in summer than spring, particularly in the smaller Pipistrellus species. Therefore, this seasonal variation in heat-dissipation strategies may reflect enhanced water conservation during summer to avoid dehydration, as bats are confined to roosts for longer and hotter days compared to spring.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103911,123,NA,NA,103911,NA

Such data are particularly important for understanding invasion risks of tropical species introduced to temperate climates and identifying whether they can survive outside tropical regions. A breeding population of the tropical clawed frog ( Xenopus tropicalis ) was recently discovered in west-central Florida, U.S.A. This fully aquatic species is native to the rainforest belt of west Africa and has not been documented outside its native range. Because of the lack of invasion history, data are sparse on the thermal limits for this species. We used chronic lethal and critical thermal methodologies to investigate thermal tolerance on adult stages and critical thermal methods on tadpoles. Because of our use of both chronic and critical methodologies, we also examined the literature to reveal common methods used to investigate thermal minimum and maximum temperature in amphibians, which were found to be dominated by the critical maximum. Chronic lethal temperatures for adult X. tropicalis were 9.73 degrees C and 36.68 degrees C. Critical temperatures were affected by acclimation temperature and life stage; adults were more tolerant of extreme temperatures. Based on these critical thermal data and the fact that breeding tends to occur when temperatures are suitable for survival, tadpole stages are unlikely to be affected by extreme temperatures. Instead, range expansion in Florida will likely be limited by the adult stages.

In rodents, TRPV4 senses warmth (25-34 degrees C), TRPV1 senses heat (>42 degrees C), TRPA1 putatively senses cold (<17 degrees C), and TRPM8 senses cool -cold (18-26 degrees C). We investigated if knockout (KO) mice lacking these TRP channels exhibited changes in thermal preference. Thermal preference was tested using a dual hot -cold plate with one thermoelectric surface set at 30 degrees C and the adjacent surface at a temperature of 15-45 degrees C in 5 degrees C increments. Blinded observers counted the number of times mice crossed through an opening between plates and the percentage of time spent on the 30 degrees C plate. In a separate experiment, observers blinded as to genotype also assessed the temperature at the location on a thermal gradient (1.83 m, 4-50 degrees C) occupied by the mouse at 5- or 10 -min intervals over 2 h. Male and female wildtype mice preferred 30 degrees C and significantly avoided colder (15-20 degrees C) and hotter (40-45 degrees C) temperatures. Male TRPV1KOs and TRPA1KOs, and TRPV4KOs of both sexes, were similar, while female WTs, TRPV1KOs, TRPA1KOs and TRPM8KOs did not show significant thermal preferences across the temperature range. Male and female TRPM8KOs did not significantly avoid the coldest temperatures. Male mice (except for TRPM8KOs) exhibited significantly fewer plate crossings at hot and cold temperatures and more crossings at thermoneutral temperatures, while females exhibited a similar but non -significant trend. Occupancy temperatures along the thermal gradient exhibited a broad distribution that shrank somewhat over time. Mean occupancy temperatures (recorded at 90-120 min) were significantly higher for females (30-34 degrees C) compared to males (26-27 degrees C) of all genotypes, except for TRPA1KOs which exhibited no sex difference.

While the initiation of cytoprotective mechanisms including the process of autophagy and the heat shock response (HSR) is crucial to cellular survival during periods of stress, age -related decrements in these systems may underlie cold -induced cellular vulnerability in older adults. Moreover, whether potential sex -related differences in autophagic regulation influence the human cold stress response remain unknown. We evaluated the effect of age and sex on mechanisms of cytoprotection (autophagy and the HSR) and cellular stress (apoptotic signaling and the acute inflammatory response) during ex vivo hypothermic cooling. Venous blood samples from 20 healthy young (10 females; mean {[}SD]: 22 {[}2] years) and 20 healthy older (10 females; 66 {[}5] years) adults were either isolated immediately (baseline) for peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or exposed to water bath temperatures maintained at 37, 35, 33, 31, or 4 degrees C for 90 min before PBMC isolation. Proteins associated with autophagy, apoptosis, the HSR, and inflammation were analyzed via Western blotting. Indicators of autophagic initiation and signaling (LC3, ULK1, and beclin-2) and the HSR (HSP90 and HSP70) increased when exposed to hypothermic temperatures in young and older adults (all p <= 0.007). Sex -related differences were only observed with autophagic initiation (ULK1; p = 0.015). However, despite increases in autophagic initiators ULK1 and beclin-2 (all p < 0.001), this was paralleled by autophagic dysfunction (increased p62) in all groups (all p < 0.001). Further, apoptotic (cleaved-caspase-3) and inflammatory (IL -6 and TNF- alpha) signaling increased in all groups (all p < 0.001). We demonstrated that exposure to hypothermic conditions is associated with autophagic dysfunction, irrespective of age or sex, although there may exist innate sex -related differences in cytoprotection in response to cold exposure as evidenced through altered autophagic initiation.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103831,121,NA,NA,103831,Macroautophagy; Apoptosis; Cold; Hypothermia; Aging

The objective of this study was to focus on the combined effects of temperature (14, 18 and 22 degree celsius) and food quality on the performance of larvae produced by 5 young (0+) and 5 old (I+) Palaemon serratus females. We prepared 3 diets based on Artemia, in decreasing order of total fatty acid content: freshly hatched nauplii (N), unenriched metanauplii (M) and metanauplii enriched with a mixture of microalgae (ME). At hatching, the larvae produced by I+ females had a higher biomass but a similar fatty acid concentration to those produced by 0+ females. Larvae survived better and developed relatively faster as temperature increased, and the longer they waited to metamorphose, the greater their weight at metamorphosis. These performances were diet-dependent, with more survival and more growth in less time with diet N than with the other two. Larvae from I+ females performed better than those from 0+ females, especially under the most stressful conditions. The greater biomass of the larvae of I+ females seems to have enabled them to follow a shorter, and therefore faster, development path than those of 0+ females. The larvae's diet also had an impact on post-metamorphic composition: larvae eating a diet richer in fatty acids produced richer juveniles and those eating a poorer diet produced juveniles with slightly more essential fatty acids. This study supports the high plasticity of caridean shrimp larval development and the importance of maternal effects on the fitness of offspring.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103796,119,NA,NA,103796,Larval development; Artemia; Fatty acids; Temperature; Food quality; Maternal effects
article,How plastic are upper thermal limits? A comparative study in tsetse (family: Glossinidae) and wider Diptera,"Weaving, Hester and Terblanche, John S. and English, Sinead",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Critical thermal maximum (CTmax) describes the upper thermal tolerance of an animal where biological functions start to fail. A period of acclimation can enhance CTmax through plasticity, potentially buffering animals from extreme temperatures caused by climate change. Basal and acclimated CTmax vary within and between species and may be explained by traits related to thermal physiology, such as body size and sex. Differences in CTmax have not been established among species of tsetse fly (Glossina spp.), vectors of animal and human African trypanosomiasis. Here, we investigated basal CTmax and its plasticity for five tsetse species following adult acclimation at constant 25 or 30 degrees C for five days. We then set our findings in context using a meta-analysis on 33 species of Diptera. We find that, of the five tsetse species considered, only Glossina palpalis gambiensis and Glossina brevipalpis exhibited plasticity of CTmax, with an increase of 0.12 degrees C and 0.10 degrees C per 1 degrees C acclimation respectively. Within some species, higher basal CTmax values were associated with larger body size and being female, while variation in plasticity (i.e., response to the acclimation temperature) could not be explained by sex or size. Our broader meta-analysis across Diptera revealed overall CTmax plasticity of 0.06 degrees C per 1 degrees C acclimation, versus a similar 0.05 degrees C mean increase in tsetse. In contrast, there was greater CTmax plasticity in males compared to females in Diptera. Our study highlights that CTmax and its plasticity varies even among closely related species. Broader patterns across groups are not always reflected at a finer resolution; we thus emphasise the need for detailed experimental studies across a wide range of insect species to capture their capacity to cope with rapidly warming temperatures.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103745,118,NA,NA,103745,Heat tolerance; Acclimation; Critical thermal maximum; Body size; Temperature stress
article,Exploring the impact of temporal heat stress on skeletal muscle hypertrophy in bovine myocytes,"Kim, Won Seob and Kim, Jongkyoo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The primary aim of this investigation was to explore the impact of different temporal stress conditions on the regulators associated with skeletal muscle hypertrophy in bovine myocytes. Bovine satellite cells (BSCs) were extracted from three-month-old Holstein bull calves and subjected to myogenic differentiation under three thermal treatments: 38 C (control; CON), 39.5 C (moderate heat stress; MHS), and 41 C (extreme heat stress; EHS) for a duration of 3 or 48 h. Exposure to EHS resulted in elevated (P < 0.01) expression levels of heat shock protein (HSP)20, HSP27, HSP70, and HSP90, along with increased (P < 0.01) protein levels. Moreover, cells exposed to MHS and EHS exhibited enhanced (P < 0.01) gene expression of myoblast determination protein 1 (MyoD), while myogenin (MyoG) was overexpressed (P < 0.01) in cells exposed to EHS. These findings suggest that heat exposure can potentially induce myogenic differentiation through the modulation of myogenic regulatory factors. Furthermore, our investigations revealed that exposure to EHS upregulated (P < 0.01) myosin heavy chain (MHC) I expression, whereas MHC IIA (P < 0.01) and IIX (P < 0.01) expression were increased; P < 0.01) under MHS conditions. These observations suggest that the temperature of the muscle may alter the proportion of muscle fiber types. Additionally, our data indicated that EHS activated (P < 0.01) the expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and triggered the activation of the Akt/mTOR/S6KB1 pathway, a known anabolic pathway associated with cellular protein synthesis. Consequently, these altered signaling pathways contributed to enhanced protein synthesis and increased myotube size. Overall, the results obtained from our current study revealed that extreme heat exposure (41 C) may promote skeletal muscle hypertrophy by regulating myogenic regulatory factors and IGF-1-mediated mTOR pathway in bovine myocytes.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103684,117,NA,NA,103684,Bovine satellite cells; Heat stress; Skeletal muscle
article,"Effect of abnormal values of three temperature indicators on ischemic stroke hospital admissions in Guangzhou, China","Wang, Guobin and Lin, Geng and Yang, Fiona Fan and Wang, Zhuoqing",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Abnormal temperature has important effects on the occurrence of ischemic stroke (IS). However, relatively less efforts have been taken to systematically unravel the association between various abnormal temperature and IS hospital admission. Focusing on three temperature indicators (i.e., mean temperature, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature), this study attempts to analyse how their abnormal values affect IS hospital admission. The dataset covers the period between September 17, 2012 and August 28, 2018, and includes a total of 1464 cases who were admitted to the hospital for the first onset of IS and lived in the main urban area of Guangzhou. The study adopts the time-stratified case-crossover analysis. Abnormal values of temperature were measured using the 2.5th and 97.5th quantile values of each temperature indicator, with the former refers to a low value whereas the latter a high one. The effects of abnormal temperature on IS hospital admission were assessed through calculating the relative risks induced by the low and high values (the median values of each temperature indicators were taken as the references). The results show that the risk window periods for IS hospital admission associated with the low values of the temperature indicators are the lags of 3-7 days and 18-19 days. The risks of high temperature values on IS admission, however, are insignificant with either one-day lag or cumulative lag. As to different population groups, females show higher risks of IS hospital admission at low temperature values than males; and elderly people, compared with young people, are more vulnerable to low temperature values. To cities with similar climate of Guangzhou, particular attention should be paid to the impact of low temperature values, especially the low value of minimum temperature, on IS admission, and to females and elderly people who are more sensitive to abnormal temperatures.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103649,116,NA,NA,103649,Ischemic stroke; Mean temperature; Maximum temperature; Minimum temperature; Abnormal temperature values; Case-crossover study
article,Thermal biology in the Upper Galili Mountain blind mole rat (Nannospalax galili) and an overview of spalacine energetics,"Sumbera, Radim and Lovy, Matej and Nevo, Eviatar and Okrouhlik, Jan",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Several hundred mammalian species thrive in complex burrow systems, which protect them from climatic ex-tremes and predation. At the same time, it is also a stressful environment due to low food supply, high humidity, and, in some cases, a hypoxic and hypercapnic atmosphere. To face such conditions, subterranean rodents have convergently evolved low basal metabolic rate, high minimal thermal conductance and low body temperature. Although these parameters have been intensively studied in the last decades, such information is far from being well-known in one of the most studied groups of subterranean rodents, the blind mole rats of the genus Nan-nospalax. The lack of information is particularly noticeable for parameters such as the upper critical temperature and the width of the thermoneutral zone. In our study, we analysed the energetics of the Upper Galilee Mountain blind mole rat Nannospalax galili and found its basal metabolic rate of 0.84 \& PLUSMN; 0.10 mL O2xg-1 x h-1, thermoneutral zone between 28 and 35 degrees C, mean Tb within the zone of 36.3 \& PLUSMN; 0.6 degrees C, and minimal thermal conductance equal to 0.082 mL O2xg-1 x h-1 x C-1. Nannospalax galili is a truly homeothermic rodent well adapted to face lower ambient temperatures, because its Tb was stable down to the lowest temperature measured (10 degrees C). At the same time, a relatively high basal metabolic rate and relatively low minimal thermal conductance for a subterranean rodent of such body mass, and the difficulty of surviving ambient temperatures slightly above upper critical temperature, indicates problems with sufficient heat dissipation at higher temperatures. This can easily lead to overheating, that is relevant mainly during the hot-dry season. These findings suggest that N. galili can be threatened by ongoing global climate change.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103618,115,NA,NA,103618,Nannospalax; Subterranean mammal; Energetics; Risk of overheating; Climate change

These especially impacts ectotherms, such as insects, which are the most susceptible animals to changes in environmental temperature, affecting their physiology and reproduction. Thus, we investigated the effects of a 96-h exposure to constant temperatures (CT: 27, 30.5, 34, 39, 41, or 43 degrees C) and fluctuating temperatures (FT: 27/34 degrees C, 12/12 h) on the survival, metabolic rate, and oviposition of the female cricket Gryllus (Gryllus) assimilis (Orthoptera: Gryllidae). Mortality, body mass and water content of females and males were quantified and compared. It was found that CT27, CT34 and FT27/34 do not cause mortality in females of G. (G.) assimilis. CT30.5 (average temperature between 27 and 34), despite causing mortality of 5.0 +/- 3.5\%, do not differ from CT27, CT34 or FT27/34. CT39 causes a mortality of 8.3 +/- 5.5\%. Estimated lethal temperature for 50\% of the population of females (LT50Temp) is 40 degrees C, and 43 degrees C promotes 100\% mortality in 96 h. Comparing mortality between sexes, females present higher LT50Temp and thermotolerance than males. In addition, FT27/34 and CT34 do not differ in the metabolic rate, but both have higher values than CT27. CT34 strongly reduces oviposition in females, however FT27/34 does not. We suggest that CT34 reduces oviposition in females in two ways: by affecting the endocrine system related to egg production, or by causing behavioral egg retention, as a strategy to survive thermal stress. Moreover, females had a higher wet body mass and present a lower average weight loss than males. In conclusion, despite females present a higher mortality at temperatures above 39 degrees C, they are more thermotolerant than males. Furthermore, CT34 is detrimental to the oviposition of G.

Fasting decreases Tb in thermoneutral and cold conditions and facilitates thermoregulatory behavior in the cold in rats; however, the mechanism is unknown. We focused on ghrelin, a hormone secreted by the stomach during fasting, in two circulatory forms: acyl ghrelin (AG) and des-acyl ghrelin (DAG). AG is called active ghrelin, while DAG, the non-active ghrelin, was unknown for a long time before its many functions were recently clarified. In the present review, we present the modulation of AG and DAG on autonomic and behavioral thermoregulation at various Ta and discuss the differences between their modulation on thermoregulation. AG decreases Tb in thermoneutral and cold conditions but does not affect the thermoregulatory behavior of rodents in cold conditions. The DAG decreases Tb in thermoneutral and hot conditions, but it does not affect Tb and facilitates the thermoregulatory behavior of rodents in the cold. These findings indicate that the actions of AG and DAG on thermoregulation are similar in thermoneutral conditions but are different in cold conditions.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103543,113,NA,NA,103543,Acyl ghrelin; Des-acyl ghrelin; Cold; Hot; Thermoregulation

Based on the generalized dual-phase lag (GDPL) model, a non-linear governing equation of tissue temperature with variable thermal physical properties is proposed. The effective procedure constructed on an explicit finite difference scheme is then developed to predict numerically the thermal response and thermal damage irradiated by a pulse laser as a therapeutic heat source.

Due to challenging comparability, reproducibility, and objectivity, investigations considering different exercise types and intensities, and automatic ROI analysis are currently needed. Thus, we aimed to examine surface radiation temperature (Tsr) variations during different exercise types and intensities in the same individuals, ROI, and environmental conditions. Ten healthy, active males performed a cardiopulmonary exercise test on a treadmill in the first week and on a cycling ergometer the following week. Respiration, heart rate, lactate, rated perceived exertion, the mean, minimum, and maximum Tsr of the right calf (CTsr (degrees C)), and the surface radiation temperature pattern (CPsr) were explored. We executed two-way rmANOVA and Spearman's rho correlation analyses. Across all IRT parameters, mean CTsr showed the highest association to cardiopulmonary parameters (E.g., oxygen consumption: rs =-0.612 (running);-0.663 (cycling); p < .001). A global significant difference of CTsr was identified between all relevant exercise test increments for both exercise-types (p < .001; eta 2p = .842) and between both exercise-types (p = .045; eta 2p = .205). Differences in CTsr between running and cycling significantly appeared after a 3-min recovery period, whereas lactate, heart rate, and oxygen consumption were not different. High correlations between the CTsr values extracted manually and the CTsr values processed automatically by a deep neural network were identified. The applied objective time series analysis enables crucial insights into intra-and interindividual differences between both tests. CTsr variations indicate different physiological demands between incremental running and cycling exercise testing. Further studies applying automatic ROI analyses are needed to enable the extensive analysis of inter-and intraindividual factors influencing the CTsr variation during exercise to allow determine the criterion and predictive validity of IRT parameters in exercise physiology.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103498,113,NA,NA,103498,Thermal imaging; Infrared thermography; Endurance exercise; Convolutional neural networks; Exercise radiomics

Methods: We incubated eggs from natural nests at ten semi-constant temperatures between 22.26 +/- 1.01 degrees C and 37.37 +/- 0.38 degrees C (2013) and at six temperatures between 25.75 +/- 0.22 degrees C and 36.17 +/- 0.15 degrees C (2016). In 2013, we raised hatchling for 90 days to evaluate effects of temperature on early hatchling growth. We evaluated maternal effects in 2016.Results: P. sextuberculata displays temperature-dependent sex determination and produces males at colder and females at warmer temperatures (TSD Ia). The estimated pivotal temperature was 33.73 +/- 0.15 degrees C and the transitional range of temperatures (TRT) 1.16 +/- 0.59 degrees C. Semi-constant temperatures below 26 degrees C and above 38 degrees C were lethal. Intermediate temperatures (32.25 degrees C and 31.5 degrees C, respectively) were optimal for hatching success and produced larger hatchlings that grew slower early in life compared to colder or warmer conditions, which produced smaller hatchlings. Warmer incubation temperatures within the optimal range (28 degrees C-37 degrees C) accelerated embryonic development. In contrast, comparisons of 30, 60 and 90 days-old suggests that warmer incubation temperatures reduced growth and mass gain rates post-hatching, such that incubation temperature effects on body size at emergence disappeared by 3 months of age.Conclusions: Six-tubercled Amazon River turtles showed the highest pivotal temperature reported for any turtle. The relatively narrow TRT may limit the evolutionary potential of this vulnerable turtle in the face of global warming. Future incubation experiments at a finer scale (33 degrees C-36 degrees C) are warranted to refine the sex-ratio re-action norm. Field studies that monitor natural nests are imperative to evaluate conservation measures and the effect of female-biased illegal hunting and climate change.

Sixty-seven dogs of different sex, breed, body weight and age were enrolled: 14 healthy dogs and 53 dogs affected by disc pathologies. The study examined three regions of interest (ROIs): the total image of the spine (IMAGE), the spinal cord area from 1st thoracic vertebra to the last lumbar vertebra (AR01) and the surgery wound or spinal cord lesion area (AR02). Significant BST variations between healthy and SCI were reported in T degrees max and T degrees max-min (Delta T) values in IMAGE (P < 0.05). In SCI group, AR01 and AR02 assessment showed an increase in temperature ate the sited of the injured area and adjacent body structures. In SCI, a significant effect of water-treadmill exercise in AR01 and AR02 was reported. In fact, both AR01 and AR02 reported higher BST (T degrees max, T degrees mean, T degrees min and Delta T) during the physical exercise (T1), representing the response to physical activity of the spine vascularization, muscles and column contiguous tissues. Furthermore, in T2, the same areas reported a significant lower BST (T degrees max, T degrees mean, and Delta T), related to a decrease in tissue inflammation on the target area of the water treadmill physiotherapy. This study highlights how IRT can detect BST variations associated with injured areas. In addition, IRT revealed a positive effect of water-treadmill exercise on the injured spinal cord areas, thus it could be a viable non-invasive and rapid method to support both clinical examination and assessment of the effectiveness of medical treatment in SCI.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103247,106,NA,NA,103247,Dog; Spinal cord injuries; Infrared thermography; Physiotherapy; Body surface temperature
article,Temperature-dependent phenology of Campaea margaritaria (L) (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) derived from field data,"Govers, Harrie A. J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"A new phenology model, using thermal sums of triangulated daily temperatures, was applied to the derivation and validation of lower temperature threshold limit and thermal constants of bivoltine Campaea margaritaria (L) from 70 observed flight peak days in The Netherlands (period of 1986-2020) and daily ambient air temperatures of 10 weather stations. Development was assumed to be controlled directly by temperature for the summer generation. During fall a diapause of young larvae was assumed and confirmed. A lower threshold limit of TL = 6.70 +/- 0.06 degrees C was found and a mean thermal winter and summer generation constant of K1,m = 838 +/- 9 and K2, m = 848 +/- 6 degrees C.day, respectively, for the reference period of 1993-2013. Generation differences could not be explained with temperature-size rules in ectotherm organisms. Threshold limit and thermal constants depended slightly on the period of derivation indicating short-term plasticity. Flight peak days were calculated with root mean square errors of 2.2-3.0 days for both generations. Changing temperatures of the reference period led to temperature dependences of flight peak days of -6.4 and -8.7 day/degrees C of the winter and summer generation, respectively. Neglecting physiological changes a complete third generation would require an increase of 3.7 degrees C, a single generation a decrease of 4.1 degrees C.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103208,105,NA,NA,103208,Long-term thermal requirements; Flight peaks; Voltinism; Plasticity; Climate; Thermal sum model; Campaea margaritaria (L)
article,Thermal acclimation alters both basal heat shock protein gene expression and the heat shock response in juvenile lake whitefish (<i>Coregonus clupeaformis</i>),"Manzon, Lori A. and Zak, Megan A. and Agee, Matthew and Boreham, Douglas R. and Wilson, Joanna Y. and Somers, Christopher M. and Manzon, Richard G.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Long-term temperature shifts associated with seasonal variability are common in temperate regions. However, these natural shifts could place significant strain on thermal stress responses of fishes when combined with mean increases in water temperatures predicted by climate change models. We examined the relationship between thermal acclimation, basal expression of heat shock protein (hsp) genes and the activation of the heat shock response (HSR) in lake whitefish (LWF; Coregonus clupeaformis), a cold water species of cultural and commercial significance. Juveniles were acclimated to either 6, 12, or 18 degrees C water for several months prior to the quantification of hsp mRNA levels in the presence or absence of acute heat shock (HS). Acclimation to 18 degrees C increased basal mRNA levels of hsp70 and hsp47, but not hsc70 or hsp90 beta in gill, liver and white muscle, while 6 degrees C acclimation had no effect on basal hsp transcription. Fish in all acclimation groups were capable of eliciting a robust HSR following acute HS, as indicated by the upregulation of hsp70 and hsp47. An increase of only 2 degrees C above the 18 degrees C acclimation temperature was required to trigger these transcriptional changes, suggesting that the HSR may be frequently initiated in LWF populations living at mildly elevated temperatures. Collectively, these expression profiles show that environmental temperature influences both basal hsp levels and the HSR in LWF, and indicate that these fish may have a greater physiological and ecological susceptibility to elevated temperatures than to cooler temperatures.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103185,104,NA,NA,103185,Thermal acclimation; Lake whitefish; Heat shock proteins; Heat shock response; Juveniles

Three hundred sixty day old unsexed broiler chicks of CARIBROVISHAL strain were assigned to five treatment groups each comprising nine replicates of 8 chicks. The experiment was carried out during the hot humid summer season (Mid-April to May) under deep litter rearing system with uniform managemental conditions. Birds were administered orally with Spirulina through drinking water in the morning (06:00-12:00 PM) on daily basis throughout the experimental period at 5, 10, 15 and 20 gL(-1) concentration. Spirulina supplementation neither improved nor compromised production performance of broilers reared during hot climatic condition. Results based on one way analysis of variance indicated a significant effect on haemoglobin and total red blood cell count. Serum lipid content and transaminases were reduced, while serum protein concentration was higher (P < 0.01) in the groups administered with 15 and 20 gL(-1) of Spirulina. The extent of imparting shank pigmentation was improved in all the supplemented groups. Cell mediated and humoral immunity against Phytoheamagglutunin-P and Newcastle disease vaccination respectively were maximized (P < 0.05) at 20 gL(-1). These findings provide direct evidence of dose-related modulation of production, physiological and immunological attributes by Spirulina engendering its further investigation as a potential source of drinking water supplement for stress alleviation in broilers. From the results, it may concluded that Spirulina can be incorporated at 15 or 20 gL(-1) for achieving optimal improvement of health and welfare attributes in broilers reared during hot summer without compromising production.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103100,103,NA,NA,103100,Broilers; Drinking water; Spirulina; Performance; Heat stress
article,Inhibition of swarming motility using <i>in vitro</i> hyperthermia,"Gazel, Deniz and Zer, Yasemin and Manay, Ayse Buyuktas and Akdogan, Huseyin",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Hyperthermia is a therapeutic technique in which body tissue is exposed to temperatures in the region of 40-45 degrees C to induce a physiological or biological effect. Swarming motility is an important virulence factor for Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and swarming phenomenon is a coordinated multicellular move-ment of differentiated bacterial population over semi-solid surfaces. In this study, we aimed to investigate the inhibitory effect of hyperthermia on bacterial swarming motility using a modified thermobiogram method and show the potential of this thermal method to treat bacterial infections. Ten P. mirabilis and 10 P. aeruginosa clinical isolates were included in the study. Sheep blood agar (SBA) plates were prepared and inoculated with bacterial suspensions of clinical isolates. Inoculated SBA plates were incubated inside 2 different incubators; at 37 degrees C and 45 degrees C for 20 h. The diameter of bacterial growing zones (swarming diameters) were measured every 2 h and noted. Finally, Gram stains of the isolates were prepared for microscopic examination. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the swarming inhibition rates of the isolates incubated at 37 degrees C and 45 degrees C. Regarding P. mirabilis species, a significant difference was found between two different temperatures (P = 0.0078). So, a temperature at the level of hyperthermia significantly inhibited the swarming motility of P. mirabilis isolates. In addition, transformation to coccus form was observed at 45 degrees C. We speculate that these findings might be useful for employing thermal therapies including hyperthermia method to treat infectious diseases caused by swarming bacterial pathogens in the future.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102955,100,NA,NA,102955,Hyperthermia; Swarming; Inhibition; P. mirabilis; P. aeruginosa

The generalized DPL bio-heat transfer model predicts different results from those by the classical DPL model and Pennes model.

article,"Effects of recent thermal history on thermal behaviour, thermal tolerance and oxygen uptake of Yellowtail Kingfish (<i>Seriola lalandi</i>) juveniles","Larios-Soriano, Ernesto and Re-Araujo, Ana Denisse and Diaz, Fernando and Lopez-Galindo, Laura L. and Rosas, Carlos and Ibarra-Castro, Leonardo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"This study determined the physiological and metabolic responses of cultivated Yellowtail Kingfish (Seriola lalandi) juveniles in accordance with their recent thermal history. The fish were acclimated at 20, 23, 26, 29 and 32 degrees C for 21 days to determine the final preferred temperature, thermal tolerance and the effect of acclimation temperatures on their oxygen uptake and aerobic scope. The final preferred temperature of juveniles was established at 26 degrees C. The critical thermal maximum (CTmax) ranged from 34.2 to 36.9 degrees C, while the critical thermal minimum (CTmin) ranged from 10.9 to 17.3 degrees C, depending on acclimation temperature. With the CTmax and CTmin values, the thermal window was determined to have an area of 258 degrees C-2, which is characteristic of subtropical organisms. Although, the metabolic rate was relatively constant (ranging 390.6-449.8 mg O-2 kg(-0.8)h(-1)) between 20 and 26 degrees C (Q(10) = 1.6, 1.0), an increase to 544.8 mg O-2 kg(-0.8)h(-1) at 29 degrees C (Q(10) = 1.9) and decrease of 478.4 mg O-2 kg(-0.8)h(-1) at 32 degrees C (Q10 = 0.6) were observed. The maximum value obtained for aerobic scope was 310.9 mg O-2 kg(-0.8)h(-1) degrees C. These results suggest that the acclimation temperature of 26 degrees C is an optimum thermal condition for a physiological and metabolic performance of yellowtail kingfish juveniles. On the contrary, the response observed during the evaluation of critical temperatures, oxygen uptake and aerobic scope indicated that yellowtail kingfish in the juvenile state could be vulnerable when it experiences for long periods (e.g., >21 days) temperatures above 29 degrees C. According to our results, the thermoregulatory behaviour of yellowtail kingfish in the juvenile stages could be one of the most important mechanisms to maintain its optimal physiological performance by actively selecting a stable thermal environment close to 26 degrees C. In addition, it was determined the limits of the pejus state of juvenile yellowtail kingfish at 29 degrees C, where an increase of oxygen uptake to maintain the aerobic energy metabolism was observed, this could certainly affect the growth of juveniles in culture systems if they do not return in a thermal range of 23-26 degrees C. These results can contribute to infer the different effects of acclimation temperature on the growth, thermal tolerance and respiratory capacity of S. lalandi juveniles on aquaculture systems.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103023,99,NA,NA,103023,Yellowtail Kingfish juveniles; Preferred temperature; Critical temperatures; Thermal window; Aerobic scope

This study evaluates the effectiveness of roof mounting misting fans to improve heat and humidity index which reduces heat stress in a cowshed. Local climatic conditions were monitored and cooling system ability to control heat stress were assessed. Measurements were conducted at different cooling zones and levels comparing with shaded and open zones. The temperature and humidity index measurements outside the cowshed THIout showed that animals exposed to high degrees of heat stress during most of the day. The average value of THIout was 87.49, whereas the average value of adjusted outside temperature and humidity index THIadj was greater than THIout by 10\% when solar radiation was considered. The maximum difference of hourly averages for temperature and humidity indices THIadj and THI occurred at noon when the intensity of solar radiation was highest. The average value for temperature and humidity index under misting fans THIfan was 82.27 whereas inside the cowshed under shade THIshade was 85.20.

We observed upstream Brook Trout and Brown Trout population shifts during the summer, with thermal habitats showing an increased number of Brown Trout, while some sites also displayed a decrease in the number of Brook Trout. Overall, there was an increased incidence of overlapping habitat occupation at the end of the summer. Brown Trout occupied optimal resting and feeding thermal habitat locations, which can potentially affect growth rates and Brook Trout's survival. Population shifts did not occur at elevated water temperatures as expected but seem driven by temperatures that are optimal for growth. Observed population shifts can lead to increased interactions between the two species throughout the summer.

article,When insect pests build their own thermal niche: The hot nest of the pine processionary moth,"Poitou, Laura and Robinet, Christelle and Suppo, Christelle and Rousselet, Jerome and Laparie, Mathieu and Pincebourde, Sylvain",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature strongly drives physiological and ecological processes in ectotherms. While many species rely on behavioural thermoregulation to avoid thermal extremes, others build structures (nests) that confer a shelter against climate variability and extremes. However, the microclimate inside nests remains unknown for most insects. We investigated the thermal environment inside the nest of a temperate winter-developing insect species, the pine processionary moth (PPM), Thaumetopoea pityocampa. Gregarious larvae collectively build a silken nest at the beginning of the cold season. We tested the hypothesis that it provides a warmer microenvironment to larvae. First, we monitored temperature inside different types of nests varying in the number of larvae inside. Overall, nest temperature was positively correlated to global radiation and air temperature. At noon, when global radiation was maximal, nest temperature exceeded air temperature by up to 11.2-16.5 degrees C depending on nest type. In addition, thermal gradients of amplitude from 6.85 to 15.5 degrees C were observed within nests, the upper part being the warmest. Second, we developed a biophysical model to predict temperature inside PPM nests based on heat transfer equations and to explain this important temperature excess. A simple model version accurately predicted experimental measurements, confirming that nest temperature is driven mainly by radiation load. Finally, the model showed that nest temperature increases at the same rate as air temperature change. We conclude that some pest insects already live in warm microclimates by building their own sheltering nest. This effect should be considered when studying the impact of climate change on phenology and distribution.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102947,98,NA,NA,102947,Microclimate; Pine processionary moth; Biophysical ecology; Heat gain; Nest; Thermal niche

This study used DSC to assess potential alterations in the plasma heat capacity profile of albumin and globulins during extremely demanding physical exercise. We monitored the changes in denaturation profiles of those plasma proteins for five consecutive days of an extraordinary exercise training schedule in 14 young male Special Forces volunteers, as well as after a 30-day recovery period. The major effect of the prolonged intense exercise was the continuous upward shift of the albumin peak by 2??3 ?C on the initial days of exercise, with a tendency to plateau circa the 5th day of exercise. In addition, some redistribution of the denaturational enthalpy was observed upon exercise, where the globulins peak increased relative to the albumin peak. Noteworthy, the alterations in the plasma proteome denaturational profiles were not persistent, as virtually full recovery of the initial status was observed after 30 days of recovery. Our findings indicate that 5 days of exhaustive physical exercise of highly trained individuals enhanced the thermal stability of plasma albumin shifting its denaturational transition to higher temperatures. We surmise that these effects may be a result of increased blood oxygenation during the prolonged intense exercise and, consequently, of albumin oxidation as part of the overall adaptation mechanisms of the body to extreme physical and/ or oxidative stress.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102860,96,NA,NA,102860,DSC; Exhaustive exercise; Protein denaturation; Special forces

We housed three groups of captive-born ground squirrels from Aug. 2017 to Aug. 2018 under constant photoperiod (12 h L:12 h D) at 5, 16 or 25 degrees C, and monitored hibernation using body temperature loggers. At 5 and 16 degrees C all animals hibernated from autumn to spring with no differences in date of first/last torpor or duration of interbout euthermic periods (IBE), but torpor bout duration was 25\% shorter at 16 degrees C. One of 4 animals housed at 25 degrees C did not hibernate. For the other three 25 degrees C animals, the first torpor date did not differ from the other groups, but the last torpor bout (5 Feb.) occurred almost 8 weeks earlier. These animals aroused from torpor more frequently and IBE lasted significantly longer, so the total time spent torpid was less than 50\% of the other groups. Unlike the 5 or 16 degrees C animals, 25 degrees C animals reentered torpor in late spring 2018.

article,"Microhabitats choice in intertidal gastropods is species-, temperature- and habitat-specific","Moisez, Emilie and Spilmont, Nicolas and Seuront, Laurent",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Understanding how behavioural adaptations can limit thermal stress for intertidal gastropods will be crucial for climate models. Some behavioural adaptations are already known to limit desiccation and thermal stresses as shell-lifting, shell-standing, towering, aggregation of conspecifics or habitat selection. Here we used the IRT (i.e. infrared thermography) to investigate the thermal heterogeneity of a rocky platform, with four different macrohabitats (i.e. bare rock, rock with barnacles, mussels and mussels incrusted by barnacles) over four thermally contrasted months. We investigated the body temperature of Littorina littorea and Patella vulgata found on this platform and the temperature of their microhabitat (i.e. the substratum within one body length around of each individual). We also considered the aggregation behaviour of each species and assessed the percentage of thermal microhabitat choice (i.e choice for a microhabitat with a temperature different than the surrounding substrate). We did not find any aggregation of L. littorea on the rocky platform during the four studied months. In contrast, P. vulgata were found in aggregates in all the studied periods and within each habitat, but there was no difference in body temperature between aggregated and solitary individuals. These two gastropods species were preferentially found on rock covered by barnacles in the four studied months. The presence of a thermal microhabitat choice in L. littorea and P. vulgata is habitat-dependent and also season-dependent. In June, July and November the choice was for a microhabitat with temperatures lower than the temperatures of the surrounding substrate whereas in December, individuals choose microhabitats with higher temperatures than the temperatures of their substratum. Taken together, these results suggest that gastropods species are able to explore their environment to find sustainable thermal macrohabitats and microhabitats and adapt this behaviour in function of the conditions of temperatures.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102785,94,NA,NA,102785,Gastropods; Behaviour; Temperature; Microhabitat choice; Aggregation
article,Nakagami imaging with related distributions for advanced thermogram pseudocolorization,"Alpar, Orcan",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Pseudocoloring algorithms embedded in the software of thermal cameras gradually colorize original intensity thermograms generated by detecting temperatures and contrast. Maximum and minimum based algorithms, however, executed by thresholding, applied to intensity thermograms for revealing and coloring the outliers instead. Although the common pseudocoloring protocols employed for general purposes may provide crucial information on the superficial contrast between radiation emitted by various sources; their common kernel is not sufficient for detecting and differentiating high radiated regions from surrounding areas, which is mandatory for recognition of abnormalities. Therefore, we propose novel imaging methodology based on Nakagami and related distributions, including gamma, Rayleigh, Weibull, chi-square and exponential, for enhancing thermal images and also for creating adequate discrimination. We initially define the boundaries of tumor and surrounding area in a synthetically generated breast thermogram already diagnosed as retroareolar tumor. Using Nakagami and transformations supported by mathematical foundations, we conducted several experiments to find the discrimination factor of the pseudocoloring techniques by calculating difference of average contrast between the tumor and the surrounding area. The performance is greatly encouraging that we achieved considerably better discrimination factor, designated for this study, up to 106.80 compared to the results of existing built-in pseudocolorization methods computed as 11.56.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102704,93,NA,NA,102704,Nakagami imaging; Infrared thermography; Distribution-based image processing; Advanced pseudocoloring; Lesion detection

Forest patterns are likely to interact with this process, but very few studies have examined their contribution in determining distribution limits. 2: We examined the role played by thermal physiology and forest cover in determining the elevational ranges of a lizard, Eutropis longicaudata. We integrated this species' thermal traits in simulating its maximum activity time under different conditions of forest cover and elevation using a NicheMapR model. In addition, we evaluated the influence of winter temperatures on the range limit by examining the simulated soil temperatures at the occurrence sites. 3: Laboratory experiments showed that E. longicaudata has a high preferred body temperature and low cold tolerance. The model predicts that maximum activity time decreases with elevation and forest cover. Although unforested areas may provide longer active time in all simulated elevations, mountain areas in Taiwan are heavily forested and are predicted to allow only a very short period of activity above 1000 m elevation. 4: All sightings were indeed located in areas below 1000 m elevation, in which the predicted average soil temperature is above 10 degrees C in January in cold years. 5: Our results show that reptile physiological response does respond strongly to the change of microclimate induced by forest cover and elevation.

This study aimed to compare the thermal comfort indices in grass monoculture and integrated systems. The three systems were pasture under full sunlight (PFS), integrated (triple-row) livestock-forestry (ILFT), and integrated (single-row) livestock-forestry (ILFs), across four seasons, for two years, from June 2017 to June 2019. We assessed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), air temperature, relative humidity, black globe temperature, and wind speed. Thermal comfort indices such as temperature-humidity index (THI), black globe temperature-humidity index (BGHI), and radiant thermal load (RTL) were calculated based on microclimate data daily-collected from 8:00 to 16:00. The ILFT mean THI (76.8) was slightly lower than ILFS and PFS. The BGHI and RTL values decreased as shading increased (PFS > ILFs > ILFT). The most challenging heat stress conditions for grazing animals occurred predominately during winter and autumn. In conclusion, the presence of trees in pastures of the southern Amazon improved the microclimate and, consequently, the thermal comfort indices.

article,A canine thermal model for simulating temperature responses of military working dogs,"Potter, Adam W. and Berglund, Larry G. and O'Brien, Catherine",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Military working dogs (MWDs) are often required to operate in dangerous or extreme environments, to include hot and humid climate conditions. These scenarios can put MWD at significant risk of heat injury. To address this concern, a two-compartment (core, skin) rational thermophysiological model was developed to predict the temperature of a MWD during rest, exercise, and recovery. The Canine Thermal Model (CTM) uses inputs of MWD mass and length to determine a basal metabolic rate and body surface area. These calculations are used along with time series inputs of environmental conditions (air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation and wind velocity) and level of metabolic intensity (MET) to predict MWD thermoregulatory responses. Default initial values of core and skin temperatures are set at neutral values representative of an average MWD; however, these can be adjusted to match known or expected individual temperatures. The rational principles of the CTM describe the heat exchange from the metabolic energy of the core compartment to the skin compartment by passive conduction as well as the application of an active control for skin blood flow and to tongue and lingual tissues. The CTM also mathematically describes heat loss directly to the environment via respiration, including panting. Thermal insulation properties of MWD fur are also used to influence heat loss from skin and gain from the environment. This paper describes the CTM in detail, outlining the equations used to calculate avenues of heat transfer (convective, conductive, radiative and evaporative), overall heat storage, and predicted responses of the MWD. Additionally, this paper outlines examples of how the CTM can be used to predict recovery from exertional heat strain, plan work/rest cycles, and estimate work duration to avoid overheating.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102651,91,NA,NA,102651,Fur; Heat strain; Thermoregulation; Panting; Hyperthermia

The sows were analyzed in the gestation sector at Agua Limpa Farm from University of Brasilia; the sows were housed in paddocks of 1000 m(2) each containing artificial and natural shading structures, where air temperature (T-air, degrees C), wind speed, relative humidity (R-H, \%) and black globe temperatures (T-G, degrees C) were collected for the environment characterization in 20-min-intervals. From the black globe temperature, the Mean Radiant Temperature (T-MR, degrees C) and the Radiant Heat Load (R-HL, W m(-2)) were calculated in the sun and under the shade structures. The total short-wave irradiance was calculated through the sum of direct, diffuse and reflected radiations. For the behavioral evaluation, an ethogram was elaborated, taking in consideration where the animals were in the paddocks, body posture, and the activity performed. The physiological variables such as respiratory rate (breaths.min(-1)), surface and rectal temperatures (degrees C) were measured during the experiment. The data was statistically analyzed through analysis of variance and frequency analysis. There was a difference at 11a.m., 2 and 3p.m., with values above 40 degrees C under the shade and above 70 degrees C in the sun for the T-MR.

article,Does oxidative stress determine the thermal limits of the regeneration niche of <i>Vriesea friburgensis</i> and <i>Alcantarea imperialis</i> (Bromeliaceae) seedlings?,"Duarte, Alexandre Aparecido and da-Silva, Cristiane Jovelina and Marques, Andrea Rodrigues and Modolo, Luzia Valentina and Lemos Filho, Jose Pires",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The predicted environmental changes may be detrimental to initial seedling growth, particularly the expected increase in air temperature. We therefore investigated the thermal limits for growth and development of Vriesea friburgensis and Alcantarea imperialis seedlings in the context of oxidative stress. The optimal temperatures for the growth of V. friburgensis and A. imperialis were 25 and 25-30 degrees C, respectively. Extreme temperatures (15, 30, or 35 degrees C) induced oxidative stress in both species with significant accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and nitric oxide (NO). Under oxidative stress, the amount of chlorophyll decreased in both species, more prominently in V. friburgensis, while carotenoid levels dramatically increased in A. imperialis. Notably, the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase increased in A. imperialis at extreme temperatures. Similar results were observed for V. friburgensis; however, the activity of CAT remained unaffected regardless of temperature. Seedlings of A. imperialis survived at a wider range of temperatures than V. friburgensis, which had greater than 40\% mortality when growing at 30 degrees C. Overall, precise control of cellular H2O2 and NO levels takes place during the establishment of A. imperialis seedlings, allowing the species to cope with relatively high temperatures. The thermal limits of the fundamental niches of the species investigated, determined based on the ability of seedlings to cope with oxidative stress, were distinct from the realized niches of these species. The results suggest that recruitment success is dependent on the ability of seedlings to handle extreme temperature-triggered oxidative stress, which limits the regeneration niche.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.02.003,80,NA,150-157,NA,Thermal limits; Oxidative stress; Nitric oxide; Hydrogen peroxide; Seedling growth; Abiotic stress

We quantified the thermal microenvironments around tree branches in the tropical rainforest canopy, and explored the effects of substrate color on the internal body temperature and species composition of arboreal ants. Branch temperatures during the day (09:00-16:00) were hottest (often > 50 degrees C) and most variable on the upper surface, while the lowest and least variable temperatures occurred on the underside. Temperatures on black substrates declined with increasing distance above the surface in both the field and the laboratory. By contrast, a micro-scale temperature inversion occurred above white substrates. Wind events (ca. 2 m s(-1)) eliminated these patterns. Internal temperatures of bodies of Cephalotes atratus workers experimentally heated in the laboratory were 6 degrees C wanner on white vs. black substrates, and 6 degrees C cooler than ambient in windy conditions. The composition of ant species foraging at baits differed between black-painted and unpainted tree branches, with a tendency for smaller ants to avoid the significantly hotter black surfaces. Collectively, these outcomes show that ants traversing canopy branches experience very heterogeneous thermal microenvironments that are partly influenced in predictable ways by branch surface coloration and breezy conditions.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.06.002,69,NA,32-38,NA,Ants; Species composition; Boundary layer; Temperature; Wind
article,Physical mechanism or evolutionary trade-off? Factors dictating the relationship between metabolic rate and ambient temperature in carabid beetles,"Gudowska, Agnieszka and Schramm, Bartosz W. and Czarnoleski, Marcin and Kozlowski, Jan and Bauchinger, Ulf",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The tight association between ambient temperature (T) and metabolic rate (MR) is a common occurrence in ectotherms, but the determinants of this association are not fully understood. This study examined whether the relationship between MR and T is the same among individuals, as predicted by the Universal Temperature Dependence hypothesis, or whether this relationship differs between them. We used flow-through respirometry to measure standard MR and to determine gas exchange patterns for 111 individuals of three Carabidae species which differ in size (Abax ovalis, Carabus linnei and C. coriaceus), exposed to four different temperatures (ten individuals of each species measured at 6, 11, 16 and 21 degrees C). We found a significant interaction between In body mass and the inverse of temperature, indicating that in a given species, the effect of temperature on MR was weaker in larger individuals than in smaller individuals. Overall, this finding shows that the thermal dependence of MR is not body mass invariant. We observed three types of gas exchange patterns among beetles: discontinuous, cyclic and continuous. Additionally, the appearance of these patterns was associated with MR and T. Evolution in diverse terrestrial environments could affect diverse ventilation patterns, which accommodate changes in metabolism in response to temperature variation. In conclusion, explaining the variance in metabolism only through fundamental physical laws of thermodynamics, as predicted by the Universal Temperature Dependence hypothesis, appears to oversimplify the complexity of nature, ignoring evolutionary trade-offs that should be taken into account in the temperature metabolism relationship.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.11.009,68,A,89-95,NA,Energy expenditure; Breathing patterns; Ectotherms; Metabolic Theory of Ecology
article,"Heat stress is associated with disruption of ion balance in the migratory locust, <i>Locusta migratoria</i>","O'Sullivan, James D. B. and MacMillan, Heath A. and Overgaard, Johannes",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Thermal tolerance is important in determining the spatial and temporal distributions of insects but the mechanisms which determine upper thermal limits remain poorly understood. In terrestrial insects heat tolerance is unlikely to be limited by oxygen supply but in some arthropods, heat stress has been shown to cause haemolymph hyperkalaemia which is known to have detrimental effects on neuromuscular excitability. It is however unresolved if heat-induced hyperkalemia is the cause or the result of cellular heat injury. To address the putative role of heat-induced hyperkalemia we quantified changes in ion and water balance in haemolymph and muscle tissue of the migratory locust during exposure to two static temperatures clustered around the CTmax (48 degrees C and 50 degrees C). We show that heat stress caused a loss of ion balance and severe haemolymph hyperkalaemia which coincided with the onset of heat stupor. Locusts were able to maintain their haemolymph volume throughout exposure, suggesting it is unlikely that osmoregulatory failure is responsible for haemolymph hyperkalaemia. When locusts were allowed to recover from heat stupor, they recovered ion balance quickly but were still unable to function optimally after 24 h. The results therefore indicate that both the haemolymph hyperkalaemia and associated depression of muscular function (heat stupor) are secondary results of cellular heat injury and that the cause of heat stupor most be sought elsewhere.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.04.001,68,"B, SI",177-185,NA,Heat stress; Potassium balance; Muscle resting membrane potential; Water balance; Cellular heat injury; Heat stupor

The animals tend to maintain homeostasis through physiological adjustments in a hot environment (maximum temperature reaches up to 47.5 degrees C). Therefore, the present study was carried out to assess the effect of thermal exposure on physiological adaptability and seminal attributes of rams under semi-arid environment. The experiment was conducted for eight weeks involving sixteen Malpura crossbred rams (GMM: Garole X Malpura X Malpura). The rams were divided equally into two groups, designated as GI and G2, respectively. The rams in GI (Control) group were kept in a sheep shed under naturally prevailing environment without artificial manipulation of ambient temperature (Temperature 30.48 +/- 0.38 degrees C; Relative Humidity 28.59 +/- 1.15\%). The rams of G2 group were exposed to different temperature at different hours of the day (38 degrees C at 1000-1100 h; 40 degrees C at 1100-1200 h; 42 degrees C at 12:00-1300 h; 43 degrees C at 1300-1400 h; 44 degrees C at 1400-1500 h and 42 degrees C at 1500-1600 h) in a climatic chamber for thermal exposure. Physiological responses, blood biochemical profile, blood endocrine profile, sexual behavior and seminal attributes were measured for both the groups. Thermal exposure significantly (P <0.05) increased the water intake; respiration rate, rectal temperature and skin temperature at afternoon in rams. Exposure of rams to thermal stress (G2) significantly (P < 0.05) increased cortisol level and decreased tri-ido-thyronine level. The latency period after the first ejaculation, decreased significantly (P < 0.05) in G2. The percentage of rapid motile sperm, linearity and average path velocity of sperm were also altered significantly (P < 0.05) in thermal exposed rams as compared to control.

article,Comparison of abdominal skin temperature between fertile and infertile women by infrared thermography: A diagnostic approach,"Jo, Junyoung and Kim, Hyunho",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the differences in abdominal temperature (AT) between fertile (n=206; age) and infertile (n=250) women between the ages of 30 and 39 years. We evaluated the differences in two distinctive skin temperatures by thermography: Delta T-1 (CV8 index) - difference in temperature between the mid-abdomen (CV8 acupuncture area) and ventral upper arm (VUA) and Delta T-2 (CV4 index) - difference in temperature between the lower abdomen (CV4 acupuncture area) and VUA. The results indicated that the Delta T-1 and Delta T-2 of infertile women were significantly lower (by 1.05 degrees C and 0.79 degrees C, respectively; p < 0.001, both) compared to those of fertile women. Additionally, the area under the curve of Delta T-1 (0.78) was greater compared to that of Delta T-2 (0.736), and its threshold was set at 0.675 degrees C, by which, the sensitivity and specificity of Delta T-1 for determination of fertility were found to be 80.8\% and 68.4\%, respectively. In conclusion, infertility is associated with lower AT. The decrease in AT in infertile women might be due to poor blood perfusion to the core muscles and tissues of the body. These findings provide a basis for further research for evaluation of clinical feasibility of thermography for analysis of infertility in women. Further evaluation of the influence of AT on fertility outcomes is required to determine the causal relationship between AT and infertility. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

article,"The peak of thermoregulation effectiveness: Thermal biology of the Pyrenean rock lizard, <i>Iberolacerta bonnali</i> (Squamata, Lacertidae)","Ortega, Zaida and Mencia, Abraham and Perez-Mellado, Valentin",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"We studied, at 2200 m altitude, the thermal biology of the Pyrenean rock lizard, lberolacerta bonnali, in the glacial cirque of Cotatuero (National Park of Ordesa, Huesca, Spain). The preferred thermal range (PTR) of I. bonnali indicates that it is a cold-adapted ectotherm with a narrow PTR (29.20-32.77 degrees C). However, its PTR (3.57 degrees C) is twice as wide as other lberolacerta lizards, which may be explained by its broader historical distribution. The studied area is formed by a mosaic of microhabitats which offer different operative temperatures, so that lizards have, throughout their entire daily period of activity, the opportunity to choose the most thermally suitable substrates. I bonnali achieves an effectiveness of thermoregulation of 0.95, which makes it the highest value found to date among the Lacertidae, and one of the highest among lizards. Their relatively wide distribution, their wider PTR, and their excellent ability of thermoregulation, would make I. bonnali lizards less vulnerable to climate change than other species of lberolacerta. Thanks to its difficult access, the studied area is not visited by a large number of tourists, as are other areas of the National Park. Thus, it is a key area for the conservation of the Pyrenean rock lizard. By shuttling between suitable microhabitats, lizards achieve suitable body temperatures during all day. However, such thermally suitable microhabitats should vary in other traits than thermal quality, such as prey availability or predation risk. Hence, it seems that these not-thermal traits are not constraining habitat selection and thermoregulation in this population. Therefore, future research in this population may study the causes that would lead lizards to prioritize thermoregulation to such extent in this population. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Sprint performance is maximal within a certain range of body temperatures in ectotherms, whose thermal upkeep relies on exogenous thermal sources. Ectotherms can respond to diverse thermal environments either by shifting their thermal preferences or maintaining them through different adaptive mechanisms. Here, we tested whether maximum sprint speed of a lizard that shows conservative thermal ecology along a 2200-meter elevational gradient differs with body temperature in lizards from different elevations. Lizards ran faster at optimum than at suboptimum body temperature. Notably, high-elevation lizards were not faster than mid- and low-elevation lizards at suboptimum body temperature, despite their low-quality thermal environment. This result suggests that both preferred body temperature and thermal dependence of speed performance are co-adapted along the elevational gradient. High-elevation lizards display a number of thermoregulatory strategies that allow them to achieve high optimum body temperatures in a low thermal-quality habitat and thus maximize speed performance. As for reproductive condition, we did not find any effect of it on sprint speed, or any significant interaction with elevation or body temperature. However, strikingly, gravid females were significantly slower than males and non-gravid females at suboptimum temperature, but performed similarly well at optimal temperature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

article,"Effect of warming rate on the critical thermal maxima of crabs, shrimp and fish","Vinagre, Catarina and Leal, Ines and Mendonca, Vanessa and Flores, Augusto A. V.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The threat of global warming has prompted numerous recent studies on the thermal tolerance of marine species. A widely used method to determine the upper thermal limit has been the Critical Thermal Maximum (CTMax), a dynamic method, meaning that temperature is increased gradually until a critical point is reached. This method presents several advantages over static methods, however, there is one main issue that hinders interpretation and comparison of CTMax results: the rate at which the temperature is increased. This rate varies widely among published protocols. The aim of the present work was to determine the effect of warming rate on CTMax values, using different animal groups. The influence of the thermal niche occupied by each species (intertidal vs subtidal) and habitat (intertidal vs subtidal) was also investigated. CTMax were estimated at three different rates: 1 degrees C min(-1),1 degrees C 30 min(-1) and 1 degrees C h(-1), in two species of crab, Eurypanopeus abbreviatus and Menippe nodifrons, shrimp Palaemon northropi and Hippolyte obliquimanus and fish Bathygobius soporator and Parablennius marmoreus. While there were significant differences in the effect of warming rates for some species, for other species warming rate produced no significant differences (H. obliquimanus and B. soporator). While in some species slower warming rates lead to lower CTMax values (P. northropi and P. marmoreus) in other species the opposite occurred (E. abbreviatus and M. nodifrons). Biological group has a significant effect with crabs' CTMax increasing at slower warming rates, which did not happen for shrimp and fish. Subtidal species presented lower CTMax, at all warming rates tested. This study highlights the importance of estimating CTMax values at realistic rates that species encounter in their environment and thus have an ecological value. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

article,"Effects of autonomic blockade on acute thermal tolerance and cardioventilatory performance in rainbow trout, <i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>","Ekstrom, Andreas and Jutfelt, Fredrik and Sandblom, Erik",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Predicted future increases in global temperature may impose challenges for ectothermic animals like fish, but the physiological mechanisms determining the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) are not well understood. One hypothesis suggests that impaired cardiac performance, limited by oxygen supply, is an important underlying mechanism. Since vagal bradycardia is suggested to improve cardiac oxygenation and adrenergic stimulation may improve cardiac contractility and protect cardiac function at high temperatures, we predicted that pharmacological blockade of cardiac autonomic control would lower CTmax. Rainbow trout was instrumented with a flow probe and a ventilation catheter for cardioventilatory recordings and exposed to an acute thermal challenge until CTmax following selective pharmacological blockade of muscarinic or beta-adrenergic receptors. Contrary to our prediction, CTmax (similar to 26 degrees C) was unchanged between treatments. While beta-adrenergic blockade reduced heart rate it did not impair cardiac stroke volume across temperatures suggesting that compensatory increases in cardiac filling pressure may serve to maintain cardiac output. While warming resulted in significant tachycardia and increased cardiac output, a high cholinergic tone on the heart was observed at temperatures approaching CTmax. This may represent a mechanism to maintain scope for heart rate and possibly to improve myocardial contractility and oxygen supply at high temperatures. This is the first study evaluating the importance of autonomic cardiac control on thermal tolerance in fish. While no effects on CTmax were observed, this study raises important questions about the underlying mechanisms determining thermal tolerance limits in ectothermic animals. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We found no significant difference in heat or cold tolerance in populations originating from a continental climate in China and from Finland with moderate temperature variation. Acclimation to large-amplitude temperature variation increased heat tolerance in both populations, but decreased cold tolerance and increased hsp70-2 expression in the Chinese population only. The latter result indicates a genotypic effect in the response to temperature variation.

Brian and Power, Michael",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Predicted increases in temperature associated with climate change are expected to have consequences for fish, in particular for Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, a cold-adapted fish species. Despite differences in predicted hydroecological responses to climate change in fluvial and lacustrine environments, little is known of whether fluvial and lacustrine Arctic charr populations may respond differently to increasing temperatures. In order to compare growth and thermal habitat use between habitat types, otolith-inferred average water temperatures estimated from whole otoliths and fork lengths at capture were measured for young-of-the-year (YOY) Arctic charr obtained from two proximal fluvial and lacustrine sites in Labrador, Canada. Otolith-inferred average experienced water temperatures were not significantly correlated with air temperatures at both sites, suggestive of behavioural thermoregulation by YOY. The majority of Kogluktokoluk Brook (fluvial) YOY were found using water temperatures consistent with laboratory determined preferred temperatures for juvenile Arctic charr, whereas most Tom's Pond (lacustrine) YOY were found using temperatures ranging between preferred temperatures and optimal temperatures for growth. There was no consistent difference between mean water temperatures used between YOY from the two sites. Otolith-inferred average experienced water temperatures were only correlated to fork lengths in Tom's Pond YOY. The lack of correlation in Kogluktokoluk Brook YOY is argued to reflect resource partitioning occurring as a result of territoriality known to occur among stream salmonids. The limited range of temperatures used by fluvial YOY in this study, particularly the lack of cooler temperatures, also suggests that fluvial YOY may face barriers to thermal refugia, and as a result may be particularly vulnerable to climate change.

Its development in avian chicks is influenced by numerous factors. Furthermore, it is suggested that altricial chicks develop their thermoregulatory capacity post-hatching, while precocial chicks develop aspects of this in the egg. We investigated the development of thermoregulation of four co-occurring seabird species in the Seychelles; namely white, ground-nesting white-tailed tropicbirds (Phaethon lepturus) and tree-nesting fairy terns (Gygis alba); and dark plumaged, tree-nesting lesser noddies (Anous tenuirostris) and ground-and tree-nesting brown noddies (A. stolidus). White-tailed tropicbirds have semi-altricial chicks, while the remaining species have semiprecocial chicks. Cloacal temperatures (Tb) were measured at five day intervals from newly hatched chicks and compared over time, and with adult Tbs. Initial Tbs of all chicks, except fairy terns, were lower than those taken when chicks were older. Brooding cessation generally coincided with feather development, as did an increase in Tb. Mean chick Tb was significantly lower than mean adult Tb for all species, but only white-tailed tropicbird and brown noddy chicks in tree nests differed significantly from mean adult Tb when chick Tb at five day intervals were considered. There was a significant interactive effect of nest site and age on brown noddy chick Tb, but chick colour did not have a significant effect on Tb. However, brown noddy chicks on dune crests maintained a constant Tb sooner than chicks in tree nests. Our results demonstrate that tropical seabird species have a more delayed onset of thermoregulatory capabilities when compared with those in temperate environments, perhaps as nest sites are less thermally challenging.

The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of wearing a newly designed hybrid cooling Vest (HCV) between two bouts of exercise. Inside a climatic chamber set at an air temperature of 37 degrees C and a relative humidity of 60\%, twelve male participants underwent two bouts of intermittent exercise interspersed with a 30 min between-bout recovery session, during which HCV or a passive rest without any cooling (PAS) was administered.

By exposing spider embryos to alternating temperatures of 14 and 32 degrees C for the first 10 days of embryonic development, we obtained eight two-headed individuals, subsequently divided into three groups according to morphological differences. We described in detail morphological abnormalities of the prosoma identified in members of each group. Histological examination confirmed a close relationship between morphological deformities and the brain structure of teratogenically changed spiders. The fusion of appendages (pedipalps and chalicerae) was accompanied by the fusion of corresponding ganglia. The absence of appendages (pedipalps) was accompanied by the absence of corresponding ganglia. This correlation may have resulted from previously impaired neuromere development which led to changes in the morphological structure of the prosoma. Since no deformities were identified in control animals, it can be concluded that bicephaly was caused by exposing embryos to alternating temperatures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

article,"Temperature-induced changes in fatty acid dynamics of the intertidal grazer <i>Platychelipus</i> <i>littoralis</i> (Crustacea, Copepoda, Harpacticoida): Insights from a short-term feeding experiment","Werbrouck, Eva and Van Gansbeke, Dirk and Vanreusel, Ann and Mensens, Christoph and De Troch, Marleen",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Dietary lipids, and in particular the essential fatty acids (EFA), EPA (20:5 omega 3) and DHA (22:6 omega 3), guarantee the well-being of animals and are recognized for their potential bottom-up control on animal populations. They are introduced in marine ecosystems through primary producers and when grazed upon, they are consumed, incorporated or modified by first-level consumers. As the availability of EFA in the ecosystem is affected by ambient temperature, the predicted rise in ocean temperature might alter the availability of these EFA at the basis of marine food webs. Despite the FA bioconversion capacity of certain benthic copepod species, their lipid (FA) response to varying temperatures is understudied. Therefore, the temperate, intertidal copepod Platychelipus littoralis was offered a mono and mixed diatom diet at 4, 15 degrees C (normal range) and at 24 degrees C (elevated temperature) to investigate the combined effects of temperature and resource availability on its FA content and composition. P. littoralis showed a flexible thermal acclimation response. Cold exposure increased the degree of FA unsaturation and the EPA\%, and induced a shift towards shorter chain FA in the copepod's membranes. Furthermore, a mixed diet reduced the impact of heat stress on the copepod's membrane FA composition. Temperature affected the trophic transfer of EPA and DHA differently. While dietary resources could fully compensate for the temperature effects on total lipid and EPA content in the copepods, no such counterweigh was observed for the DHA dynamics. Heat stress lowered the DHA concentration in copepods regardless of the resources available and this implies negative effects for higher trophic levels. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Simulation of scalp cooling by external devices for prevention of chemotherapy-induced alopecia,"Pliskow, Bradley and Mitra, Kunal and Kaya, Mehmet",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Hypothermia of the scalp tissue during chemotherapy treatment (scalp cooling) has been shown to reduce or prevent chemotherapy-induced hair loss. In this study, numerical models are developed to investigate the interaction between different types of external scalp cooling devices and the human scalp tissue. This work focuses on improving methods of modeling scalp cooling devices as it relates specifically to the prevention of chemotherapy-induced alopecia. First, the cooling power needed for any type of device to achieve therapeutic levels of scalp hypothermia is investigated. Subsequently, two types of scalp cooling devices are simulated: a pre-cooled/frozen cap design and a liquid-cooled cap design. For an average patient, simulations show that 38.5 W of heat must be extracted from the scalp tissue for this therapy in order to cool the hair follicle to 22 degrees C. In practice, the cooling power must be greater than this amount to account for thermal losses of the device. Simulations show that pre-cooled and liquid-cooled cap designs result in different tissue temperatures over the course of the procedure. However, it is the temperature of the coolant that largely determines the resulting tissue temperature. Simulations confirm that the thermal resistance of the hair/air layer has a large impact on the resulting tissue temperatures. The results should be correlated with experimental data as an effort to determine the optimal parameter choices for this model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

article,"Simultaneous estimation of size, radial and angular locations of a malignant tumor in a 3-D human breast - A numerical study","Das, Koushik and Mishra, Subhash C.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"This article reports a numerical study pertaining to simultaneous estimation of size, radial location and angular location of a malignant tumor in a 3-D human breast. The breast skin surface temperature profile is specific to a tumor of specific size and location. The temperature profiles are always the Gaussian one, though their peak magnitudes and areas differ according to the size and location of the tumor. The temperature profiles are obtained by solving the Pennes bioheat equation using the finite element method based solver COMSOL 4.3a. With temperature profiles known, simultaneous estimation of size, radial location and angular location of the tumor is done using the curve fitting method. Effect of measurement errors is also included in the study. Estimations are accurate, and since in the inverse analysis, the curve fitting method does not require solution of the governing bioheat equation, the estimation is very fast. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Suitability of frequency modulated thermal wave imaging for skin cancer detection-A theoretical prediction,"Bhowmik, Arka and Repaka, Ramjee and Mulaveesala, Ravibabu and Mishra, Subhash C.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"A theoretical study on the quantification of surface thermal response of cancerous human skin using the frequency modulated thermal wave imaging (FMTWI) technique has been presented in this article. For the first time, the use of the FMTWI technique for the detection and the differentiation of skin cancer has been demonstrated in this article. A three dimensional multilayered skin has been considered with the counter-current blood vessels in individual skin layers along with different stages of cancerous lesions based on geometrical, thermal and physical parameters available in the literature. Transient surface thermal responses of melanoma during FMTWI of skin cancer have been obtained by integrating the heat transfer model for biological tissue along with the flow model for blood vessels. It has been observed from the numerical results that, flow of blood in the subsurface region leads to a substantial alteration on the surface thermal response of the human skin. The alteration due to blood flow further causes a reduction in the performance of the thermal imaging technique during the thermal evaluation of earliest melanoma stages (small volume) compared to relatively large volume. Based on theoretical study, it has been predicted that the method is suitable for detection and differentiation of melanoma with comparatively large volume than the earliest development stages (small volume). The study has also performed phase based image analysis of the raw thermograms to resolve the different stages of melanoma volume. The phase images have been found to be clearly individuate the different development stages of melanoma compared to raw thermograms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Cold-induced vasodilation and vasoconstriction in the finger of tropical and temperate indigenes,"Lee, Joo-Young and Bakri, Ilham and Matsuo, Asako and Tochihara, Yutaka",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"While heat acclimatization reflects the development of heat tolerance, it may weaken an ability to tolerate cold. The purpose of this study was to explore cold-induced vasodilation (CIVD) responses in the finger of tropical indigenes during finger cold immersion, along with temperate indigenes. Thirteen tropical male indigenes (subjects born and raised in the tropics) and 11 temperate male indigenes (subjects born and raised in japan and China) participated. Subjects immersed their middle finger at 4.3 +/- 0.8 degrees C water for 30 min. Rectal temperature, skin temperatures, finger skin blood flow, blood pressure and subjective sensations were recorded during the test. The results showed that: (1) the tropical group demonstrated a lower minimum (T-min), maximum (T-max) and mean finger temperature (T-mean) compared to those of the temperate group (P < 0.05): (2) seven tropical indigenes demonstrated a late-plateau type of CIVD pattern, which is characterized by a pronounced 1st vasoconstriction and a single CIVD with a faint and weak 2nd vasoconstriction, whereas no temperate indigene demonstrated the late-plateau type; and (3) the hand temperature at the end of finger immersion was 3 degrees C lower in the tropical than the temperate group (P < 0.05). These results indicate that tropical indigenes have less active responses of arterio-venous anastomoses in the finger and weaker vasoconstrictions after the first CIVD response during finger cold immersion, which can be considered as being more vulnerable to cold injury of the periphery in severe cold.

The current study investigated the effects of Moringa oleifera leaf powder (MOLP) supplementation on productive performance and intestinal health of rabbits under chronic heat stress (HS). Young New Zealand White rabbits (male) at the age of 32 weeks (n = 21, mean body weight of 3318 +/- 171 g) for four weeks' period were reared on commercial pelleted diet and divided into three groups: control (CON, 25 degrees C), HS (35 +/- 1 degrees C) and HS (35 +/- 1 degrees C) with MOLP (HSM) supplemented orally (200 mg/kg body weight). The results demonstrated that rabbits in the HSM group had reduced rectal temperature, respiration rate and improved FCR due to improved daily gain and better crude fiber (NDF) digestibility (P < 0.05) compared with HS group. MOLP improved intestinal integrity and function as indicated by lower serum diamine oxidase level and increased jejunal weight, length, villus height and ratio of villus height to crypt depth than heat-stressed rabbits. MOLP reversed the increased levels of serum cortisol, metabolic indicators i.e. glucose, insulin, and reduced concentrations of serum triiodothyronine. MOLP supplementation also significantly down-regulated the mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (alpha), heat shock protein A2, glutathione peroxidase-1, interleukin (IL)-1 alpha and increased the expression of IL-6.

Following thermal injury, all tissues are exposed to ischemia, and as a result, resuscitation and reperfusion occur during the burning shock. Burn damage starts systemic inflammatory reactions that produce toxins and reactive oxygen radicals that lead to peroxidation. This study aimed to investigate, for the first time, the possible antioxidant effects of Myrtus communis ethanol extract on burn-induced oxidative distant organ injury orally. The thermal trauma was generated under ether anesthesia by exposing the dorsum of rats to 90 degrees C water bath for 10 s. 100 mg/kg/day Mrytus communis ethanol extract was applied orally for two days. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels, glutatinone-S-transferase (GST), superoxidedismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities were determined to detect the possible antioxidant effects of myrtle on small intestine and lung tissues. Burn damage significantly increased MDA levels in lung and small intestine tissues, and significantly decreased GSH levels, CAT and GST activities in the small intestine and lung tissues compared to control group. Mrytus communis ethanol extract decreased MDA level and increased GSH level, SOD, CAT and GST activities significantly in either small intestine or lung tissues. Mrytus communis extract may be an ideal candidate to be used as an antioxidant adjunct to improve oxidative distant organ damage to limit the systemic inflammatory response and decreasing the recovery time after thermal injury.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102685,93,NA,NA,102685,Burn; Lung; Small intestine; Mrytus communis; Burn wound healing activity; Antioxidant activity

We determined whether curcumin supplementation in the diets of laying hens under cold stress and naturally infected with Escherichia coli would control infection, and would have positive effects on overall health, as well as egg production and quality. We allocated 36 chickens that had been naturally infected with E. coli into two groups, with six replicates and three chickens per repetition: control group and curcumin group (200 mg curcumin/kg). The experimental period lasted 42 days, and fecal, blood and egg samples were collected at 1, 21 and 42 days We found that feces and eggs had lower total bacterial counts, E. coli counts and total coliform counts in the curcumin group at 21 and 42 days. In fresh eggs, the brightness and yellow intensity (b+) were significantly higher in the curcumin group. In stored eggs, higher specific gravity, albumen height and lower yolk pH were observed in the curcumin group. Fresh eggs collected and stored on day 42 showed lower levels of lipid peroxidation in the curcumin group, while the total antioxidant capacity in the stored eggs was significantly higher in the curcumin group. The curcumin group showed lower total leukocyte counts as a result of lower numbers of neutrophils and lymphocytes, as well as lower levels of total protein, alkaline phosphatase and alanine aminotransferase. Lower serum lipoperoxidation at 42 days was observed in the curcumin group, probably because of the higher activity of glutathione peroxidase and glutathione transferase in other words, because of antioxidant stimulation.

article,Thermal and oxygen conditions during development cause common rough woodlice (<i>Porcellio scaber</i>) to alter the size of their gas-exchange organs,"Antol, Andrzej and Labecka, Anna Maria and Horvathova, Terezia and Zielinski, Bartosz and Szabla, Natalia and Vasko, Yaroslav and Pecio, Anna and Kozlowski, Jan and Czarnoleski, Marcin",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Terrestrial isopods have evolved pleopodal lungs that provide access to the rich aerial supply of oxygen. However, isopods occupy conditions with wide and unpredictable thermal and oxygen gradients, suggesting that they might have evolved adaptive developmental plasticity in their respiratory organs to help meet metabolic demand over a wide range of oxygen conditions. To explore this plasticity, we conducted an experiment in which we reared common rough woodlice (Porcellio scaber) from eggs to maturation at different temperatures (15 and 22 degrees C) combined with different oxygen levels (10\% and 22\% O-2). We sampled animals during development (only females) and then examined mature adults (both sexes). We compared woodlice between treatments with respect to the area of their pleopod exopodites (our proxy of lung size) and the shape of Bertalanffy's equations (our proxy of individual growth curves). Generally, males exhibited larger lungs than females relative to body size. Woodlice also grew relatively fast but achieved a decreased asymptotic body mass in response to warm conditions; the oxygen did not affect growth. Under hypoxia, growing females developed larger lungs compared to under normoxia, but only in the late stage of development. Among mature animals, this effect was present only in males. Woodlice reared under warm conditions had relatively small lungs, in both developing females (the effect was increased in relatively large females) and among mature males and females. Our results demonstrated that woodlice exhibit phenotypic plasticity in their lung size. We suggest that this plasticity helps woodlice equilibrate their gas exchange capacity to differences in the oxygen supply and metabolic demand along environmental temperature and oxygen gradients. The complex pattern of plasticity might indicate the effects of a balance between water conservation and oxygen uptake, which would be especially pronounced in mature females that need to generate an aqueous environment inside their brood pouch.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102600,90,NA,NA,102600,Air breathing; Gas exchange; Hypoxia; Isopods; Land adaptation; Respiratory organs

The ability to measure body temperature at peripheral locations may also be important in the development of minimally invasive tools for remote temperature measurement in livestock. This study aimed to investigate how well body temperature measured at peripheral sites reflected a commonly used core measurement (vaginal temperature) and the circadian rhythmicity of the body temperature of sheep with a view to practical application in extensive sheep production systems. Eleven crossbred ewes were implanted with peripheral temperature sensing microchips (LifeChip (R)) which were positioned transversely in the sternocleidomastoid (neck) muscle and subcutaneously under the tail. iButton (R) temperature loggers were placed intravaginally to record core body temperature measurements (Tv). The body temperature measurements observed at the peripheral sites in the neck (Tn) and tail (Tt) differed significantly to those measured at the core site, Tv (P < 0.05), with Tn lower than Tv and Tt lower than both Tv and Tn. Similarities in circadian rhythm patterns were observed across the day between Tv, Tn and Tt in repeated measures analysis, with a short period of difference between Tv and Tn (from 1400 to 1600 h) and a long period of difference between Tv and Tt (from 1000 to 2100 h) (P < 0.05). These results suggest that neck muscle temperature measurements may have utility in detecting circadian rhythm patterns in core temperature in sheep, but may not accurately reflect absolute core temperatures. Peripheral measures may require adjustment or correction to more accurately reflect absolute core temperature with respect to determining accurate clinical thresholds relative to the expected normal temperature for the time of day observed. Further investigation into the utility and application of peripheral measurement of body temperature is warranted.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102606,90,NA,NA,102606,Body temperature; Diurnal rhythm; Sheep; Remote sensor; Microchip; iButton

The sweat gland epithelium (mu m), glandular portion length (mu m), sweat gland duct length (mu m), gland depth (mu m), and sweat gland density (cm(2)) were determined. Principal component analyses were performed to address the overall structure of breed's group, together with confirmatory analyses by the least squares procedures. Exploratory analysis showed that cattle breeds presented patterns of dissimilarity in the changes in their skin and sweat glands traits between winter and summer seasons. Breeds were separated into three groups under the two principal components, which represented 77.26\% of the total variance. The first group was composed of Sindh and Guzerat cattle, which did not present modifications in the parameters assessed between seasons.

article,Remarkable insensitivity of acorn ant morphology to temperature decouples the evolution of physiological tolerance from body size under urban heat islands,"Yilmaz, Aaron R. and Chick, Lacy D. and Perez, Abe and Strickler, Stephanie A. and Vaughn, Selby and Martin, Ryan A. and Diamond, Sarah E.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Environmental temperature can alter body size and thermal tolerance, yet the effects of temperature rise on the size-tolerance relationship remain unclear. Terrestrial ectotherms with larger body sizes typically exhibit greater tolerance of high (and low) temperatures. However, while warming tends to increase tolerance of high temperatures through phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary change, warming tends to decrease body size through these mechanisms and thus might indirectly contribute to worse tolerance of high temperatures. These contrasting effects of warming on body size, thermal tolerance, and their relationship are increasingly important in light of global climate change. Here, we used replicated urban heat islands to explore the size-tolerance relationship in response to warming. We performed a common garden experiment with a small acorn-dwelling ant species collected from urban and rural populations across three different cities and reared under five laboratory rearing temperatures from 21 to 29 degrees C. We found that acorn ant body size was remarkably insensitive to laboratory rearing temperature (ant workers exhibited no phenotypic plasticity in body size across rearing temperature) and among populations experiencing cooler rural versus warmer urban environmental temperatures (no evolved differences in body size between urban and rural populations). Further, this insensitivity of body size to temperature was highly consistent across each of the three cities we examined. Because body size was robust to temperature variation, previously described plastic and evolved shifts in heat (and cold) tolerance in acorn ant responses to urbanization were shown to be independent of shifts in body size. Indeed, genetic (colony-level) correlations between heat and cold tolerance traits and body size revealed no significant association between size and tolerance. Our results show how typical trait correlations, such as between size and thermal tolerance, might be decoupled as populations respond to contemporary environmental change.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102426,85,NA,NA,102426,Body size; CTmax; CTmin; Thermal tolerance; Global change; Urban heat island

The tumor is assumed to be in the form of a sphere with a small radius. In order that the determined intensity of the heat source does not damage healthy tissue, different temperature distributions as a function of time are anticipated at the tumor's border. The mathematical tools used are based on the Trefftz method.

Hemoglobin and hematocrit were significantly decreased when the temperature was higher than 28 degrees C. Plasma calcium, glucose, cholesterol, glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, and glutamic pyruvic transaminase were significantly elevated at high temperatures, whereas total protein was substantially lower. Superoxide dismutase and glutathione-S-transferase activities in the liver and gills were significantly elevated at high temperatures, whereas glutathione was significantly lower. This indicates that temperatures greater than 26 degrees C induced hematological changes and oxidative stress in the juvenile P. olivaceus in biofloc.

article,"Effect of the valine-to-lysine ratio on the performance of sows and piglets in a hot, humid environment","Zhao, Liangyu and Li, Yansen and Li, Zhaojian and Wu, Shen and Huang, Kai and Chen, Jiaqin and Li, Chunmei",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"To determine the effect of the valine-to-lysine (Val: Lys) ratio on the performance of sows and piglets in a hot, humid environment, eleven Large White x Landrace sows (parity 2 or 3) were selected and randomly assigned to 3 groups. The diets contained total dietary Val: Lys ratios of 0.72, 0.87, or 1.01:1. Sows were fed from d 29 prepartum to d 21 postpartum in a hot, humid environment (temperature: 22-31 degrees C, relative humidity: 69-96\%). The results showed that dietary valine improved the average daily feed intake (ADFI) of the sows in wk3 of the lactation and the average daily gain (ADG) of the piglets from day 7-14 after farrowing. Dietary valine increased the concentrations of lactose in colostrum and immunoglobulin M (IgM) in piglet serum. Additionally, dietary valine affected metabolite and metabolic hormone concentrations. The increase in the ratio of dietary Val: Lys decreased the blood urea nitrogen and increased serum glucose in the sows and increased serum albumin in the piglets. In addition, increasing dietary Val: Lys increased the serum concentration of estradiol-17 beta in the sows. In conclusion, in a hot, humid environment, dietary valine could improve the performance of sows and piglets by increasing colostrum lactose and serum immunoglobulin concentration in piglets and by influencing serum glucose in sows.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.02.021,81,NA,89-97,NA,Sows; Heat; Valine; Piglet growth; Metabolite

M. K.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Sheep reared in hot semi-arid environments are generally exposed to heat and nutritional stress in some seasons of the year, which affects both production and reproduction. To assess the effect of high ambient temperature and feed scarcity on superovulation, 16 adult Malpura ewes were randomly divided into two groups of 8 animals each. G1 (control) was kept under a shed and offered a maintenance diet, and G2 (combined stress) was subjected to both nutritional (30\% less of maintenance diet) and heat (38-44 degrees C for 6 h/day) stress. Ewes were superovulated without estrus synchronization by a combination of single injection of 200 IU eCG and 8 injections of FSH (Folltropin-V) at 12-h intervals in tapering doses of 5 mg/kg body weight, starting from the day 7 of natural estrus. eCG was given with the first injection and PGF2 alpha (10 mg) was given with the second last FSH injection. G2 increased respiration rate and rectal temperature (P < 0.01), and blood urea level (P < 0.05), whereas it decreased average daily gain, plasma T4 concentration (P < 0.01) and body weight (P < 0.05). Plasma estradiol level was lower (P < 0.05) in G2 ewes as compared to control (G1) ewes. However, the number of ewes showed a superovulatory response (88 vs 66\% ewes >= 3 corpus luteum), ovulation rate (8.75 vs 5.88) and embryo production (5.5 vs 19) decreased, and the number of large follicles (anovulation) increased (1.0 vs 2.14) in G2 ewes. G2 had a comparable effect on the superovulatory response compared to control ewes although physiological changes occurred as an adaptive mechanism to stress. Therefore, the well-adapted cyclic sheep of the semi-arid region may be used for superovulation despite the stressful condition of heat exposure and nutritional insufficiency.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.02.007,80,NA,158-163,NA,Superovulation; Sheep; Heat stress; Respiration rate; Blood metabolites

Neal and Edwards, J. Lannett",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Hyperthermia occurring 10-12 h after LH surge reduces quality of maturing oocyte, thereby reducing fertility. Objective was to examine consequences of an acute heat stress and the influence of certain hormones on the thermoregulatory responses of lactating cows during this critical period. Between the months of February through May, cows were transported to a facility and maintained at a temperature-humidity index (THI) of 65.9 +/- 0.2 (thermoneutral) or exposed to changes in THI to simulate what may occur during an acute heat stress event (71-86 THI; heat stress); cows were rapidly cooled thereafter. Mixed model regressions with repeated measures were used to test respiration rates (RR) and rectal temperature (RT). Within 40 and 110 min of increasing THI, RR increased in a quadratic fashion (P < 0.001); RT increased by 0.04 +/- 0.1 degrees C (P < 0.001) per unit THI. Changes in RR lagged THI and preceded rises in RT. Average THI 3-days before treatment (prior THI) influenced RR (P = 0.050) and RT (P < 0.001) changes. Increased RR was more noticeable in heat stressed cows when prior THI was in the 40 s. Rectal temperature of heat-stressed cows was 0.8 +/- 0.02 degrees C lower when prior THI was in the 40 s versus low 60 s. Levels of progesterone and luteinizing hormone before treatment were predictive of thermoregulatory response in heat-stressed cows. Rapid cooling decreased RR by 0.6 +/- 0.1 bpm (P < 0.001) and RT by 0.02 +/- 0.002 degrees C per min (P < 0.002). Speed and magnitude of thermoregulatory changes to an acute heat stress and after sudden cooling emphasizes importance of strategic cooling before ovulation. Efforts to do so when prior THI approaches levels expected to induce mild stress are especially important.

article,Social thermoregulation and socio-physiological effect in the subterranean Mashona mole-rat (<i>Fukomys darlingi</i>),"Wiedenova, Pavlina and Sumbera, Radim and Okrouhlik, Jan",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"A strict underground style of life is one of the greatest challenges for mammals partly due to the high energetic cost of obtaining food by digging through a mechanically resistant substrate. Any energy saving adaptation, for example the effect of social thermoregulation, is thus very important for subterranean mammals. It has also been suggested that social mammals may suffer from ``isolation stress{''} if measured alone, because the presence of other family member(s) may decrease the stress levels and thus their metabolic rates. This phenomenon known as a socio-physiological effect should be conspicuous when the metabolism of huddling individuals is measured within a species' thermoneutral zone (TNZ), where no energetic costs for body warming or cooling exist. In our study, we measured the resting metabolic rates of a social species of African mole-rat, the Mashona mole-rat (Fukomys darlingi), in individuals, pairs and groups of three to eight individuals. Measurements were carried out at ambient temperature below the species' TNZ (20 degrees C) to test the effect of social thermoregulation and at a temperature within the species' TNZ (30 degrees C) to test the socio-physiological effect. In pairs, the Mashona mole-rat saved 25\% of its individual energetic expenses at the temperature below the TNZ. With increasing group size, energetic savings rose up to four animals, but no savings were found in larger groups. At the temperature within the TNZ, mole-rats saved 10\% of individual energetic expenses in pairs, but the difference was not significant. Also, no energetic savings were found in larger groups within the TNZ. Our results on thermoregulatory savings in the TNZ are in contrast with extremely high energetic savings found by other authors in different mole-rat species.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.10.020,78,NA,367-373,NA,Fukomys darlingi; Bathyergidae; Social thermoregulation; Socio-physiological effect; Resting metabolic rate; Sociality

article,The influence of body composition on exercise-associated skin temperature changes after resistance training,"Weigert, Martin and Nitzsche, Nico and Kunert, Felix and Loesch, Christiane and Schulz, Henry",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Resistance exercise leads to an increase in skin temperature (T-skin) in the area of the exercised muscle. Infrared thermography seems to be applicable to identify these primary used functional muscles with measuring T-skin, changes. The aim of the current study was to investigate the influence of body composition on T-skin patterns after resistance exercise. 38 male subjects (19-32 years, BMI 20.4-55.2 kg/m(2)) participated. Body fat percentage and biceps skinfold thickness were calculated. The subjects were divided into two groups: lean group (LG) with body fat percentage < 25\%, obese group (OG) with body fat percentage >= 25\%. All participants completed three sets with ten repetitions of unilateral biceps curl at 50\% of the one repetition maximum. To represent exercise-induced changes of T-skin to rest (T-rest), the algebraic difference of each time point toT(rest) was calculated. The resulting delta values (Delta) are as follows: immediately after the first, second, and third set (Delta T-set1, Delta T-set2, Delta T-set3), and at 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,15,20,25,30 min after the third set (Delta T-1- Delta T-30). The maximum positive difference to T-rest was defined as Delta T-max  and the time to reach Delta T-max  was defined as Time to Delta T-max. LG and OG differed significantly at T-rest (32.8 +/- 0.9 vs. 31.1 +/- 1.4 degrees C), Delta T-max (1.9 +/- 0.4 vs. 0.9 +/- 0.8 degrees C), Time to Delta T-max (4.5 +/- 2.0 vs. 17.6 +/- 10.2 min) and at Delta T-set2 to Delta T-15 (p < 0.005). Correlations between body composition (BMI, body fat percentage, biceps skinfold thickness) and T-rest, Delta T-set2, Delta T-set3, Delta T-max (- 0.47 < r < -0.74, p <0.005) and Time to Delta T-max (0.52 0.70, p < 0.005) could be shown. In LG, a homogeneous load-induced T(skin )pattern was found in all subjects, whereas heterogeneous T-skin progressions were shown in the OG. In conclusion, a greater body fat percentage and a greater skinfold thickness are associated with delayed and lower increases in T skin after resistance exercise.

An isofemale line design permitted to submit each line (full sibs) to the four thermal regimes. Under cold stress, the pigmentation was similar to the value observed at constant 25 degrees C, suggesting a kind of functional dominance of the high temperature phase. In all cases, thermal stresses increased the individual environmental variance, i.e., increased the developmental instability. Genetic correlations between lines were not modified by the stresses but provided some unexpected and surprising results, which should be confirmed by further investigations: for example, negative correlations between pigmentation and body size or sternopleural bristle number. As a whole, the data do not confirm the hypothesis that under stressing conditions a hidden genetic variability could be unravelled, permitting a faster adaptation to environmental changes.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.01.005,72,NA,118-126,NA,Alternating temperatures; Pigmentation; Isofemale lines; Heritability; Evolvability; Genetic correlations
article,Latitudinal patterns in temperature-dependent growth rates of a forest pathogen,"Pimentel, Carla S. and Ayres, Matthew P.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Direct effects of temperature on plant pathogens can be crucial to determine the onset and epidemiology of disease. The pinewood nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, the causal agent of the pine wilt disease (PWD), has a wide geographical distribution in Eurasia and East Asia, and local temperatures are considered determinant for the onset of the PWD. However, direct effects of temperature on this pathogen are never considered when forecasting its distribution and impact. In the present study we assessed: 1) at which temperatures is the development of wild populations of the pinewood nematode optimized; 2) if there is niche divergence on different populations from its wide distribution area. For this we studied two populations originated from different latitudes in eastern North America (NA), and used multi-model inference to evaluate the contributions of temperature, diet, and nematode population toward the growth rates of B. xylophilus. Although population origin had some effect on the predictive models, there seems to be niche conservatism, with temperatures of 28-29 degrees C maximizing the growth rates of the pathogen. Thus, the use of the number of days in the summer with temperatures between 25 and 31 degrees C would probably help to improve models forecasting B. xylophilus dispersion and PWD. The present work highlight the importance of considering adaptations to temperatures in forest pathogens with large geographical distributions, when building models forecasting the impact of climate on these organisms.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.11.018,72,NA,39-43,NA,Bursaphelenchus xylophilus; Climate; Multimodal inference; North America; Pine forests; Plant pathogen

The approaches of the models are different, however, they both aim at providing predictions of the thermophysiological responses to thermal environments of an average person. The aim of this study was to compare and analyze predictions of the two models against experimental data. The analysis also includes a gender comparison. The experimental data comprised of ten participants (5 males, 5 females, average anthropometric values were used as input) conducting an intermittent protocol of rotating tasks (cycling, stacking, stepping and arm crank) of moderate metabolic activities (134-291 W/m(2)) with breaks in-between in a controlled environmental condition (34 degrees C, 60\% RH). The validation consisted of the predictions' comparison against experimental data from 2.5 h of data of rectal temperature and mean skin temperature based on contact thermometry from four body locations. The PHS model over-predicted rectal temperatures during the first activity for males and the cooling effectiveness of sweat in the recovery periods, for both males and females. As a result, the PHS simulation underestimated the thermal strain in this context. The Fiala model accurately predicted the rectal temperature throughout the exposure. The fluctuation of the experimental mean skin temperature was not reflected in any of the models. However, the PHS simulation model showed better agreement than the Fiala model. As both models predicted responses more accurately for males than females, we suggest that in future development of the models it is important to take this result into account.

Post-translational inhibition of PDH activity via three serine phosphorylation sites (pS232, pS293, and pS300) regulate the metabolic flux through the TCA cycle, decrease glucose utilization, and facilitate lipid metabolism during times of nutrient deprivation. As metabolic readjustment is necessary to survive hibernation, the purpose of this study was to explore the post translational regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase and the expression levels of four mitochondrial serine/ threonine kinases (PDHICs), during torpor-arousal cycles in liver, heart, and skeletal muscle of 13-lined ground squirrels. A combination of Luminex multiplex technology and western immunoblotting were used to measure the protein expression levels of total PDH, three phosphorylation sites, S232, 293, 300, and the expression levels of the corresponding PDH kinases (PDHK1-4) during euthermic control, entrance, late torpor, and interbout arousal. Liver and heart showed strong inhibitory PDH regulation, indicating a possible decrease in glucose utilization and a possible preference for 13-oxidation of fatty acids during periods of low temperature and starvation. On the contrary, skeletal muscle showed limited PDH regulation via phosphorylation, possibly due to alternate controls. Phosphorylation of PDH may play an important role in regulating aerobic and anaerobic metabolic responses during hibernation in the 13-lined ground squirrel.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.07.010,69,NA,199-205,NA,PDH; Hibernation; Metabolism; Phosphorylation; Fat metabolism; Glycolysis
article,Paralysis and heart failure precede ion balance disruption in heat-stressed European green crabs,"Jorgensen, Lisa B. and Overgaard, Johannes and MacMillan, Heath A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Acute exposure of ectotherms to critically high temperatures causes injury and death, and this mortality has been associated with a number of physiological perturbations including impaired oxygen transport, loss of ion and water homeostasis, and neuronal failure. It is difficult to discern which of these factors, if any, is the proximate cause of heat injury because, for example, loss of ion homeostasis can impair neuromuscular function (including cardiac function), and conversely impaired oxygen transport reduces ATP supply and can thus reduce ion transport capacity. In this study we investigated if heat stress causes a loss of ion homeostasis in marine crabs and examined if such loss is related to heart failure. We held crabs (Carcinus maenas) at temperatures just below their critical thermal maximum and measured extracellular (hemolymph) and intracellular (muscle) ion concentrations over time. Analysis of Arrhenius plots for heart rates during heating ramps revealed a breakpoint temperature below which heart rate increased with temperature, and above which heart rate declined until complete cardiac failure. As hypothesised, heat stress reduced the Nernst equilibrium potentials of both and Nat, likely causing a depolarization of the membrane potential. To examine whether this loss of ion balance was likely to cause disruption of neuromuscular function, we exposed crabs to the same temperatures, but this time measured ion concentrations at the individual-specific times of complete paralysis (from which the crabs never recovered), and at the time of cardiac failure. Loss of ion balance was observed only after both paralysis and complete heart failure had occurred; indicating that the loss of neuromuscular function is not caused by a loss of ion homeostasis. Instead we suggest that the observed loss of ion balance may be linked to tissue damage related to heat death.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.08.001,68,"B, SI",186-194,NA,Ion balance; Sodium; Potassium; Heat stress; Crustacean

Amphibians are particularly sensitive to climatic changes due to their physiological, ecological and behavioral characteristics. Here we performed a laboratory experiment to investigate how temperature affects ovipositing females, eggs and hatchlings in two syntopic populations of alpine newts, Ichthyosaura alpestris, and smooth newts, Lissotriton vulgaris. Female newts were assigned to two different oviposition temperatures (11 degrees C and 14 degrees C) for the duration of their oviposition period. Deposited eggs were equally divided and assigned to three different incubation temperatures (11 degrees C, 14 degrees C and 17 degrees C). We hypothesized that oviposition will be affected by temperature, that the combination of different oviposition and incubation temperatures may have an effect on embryonic and hatchling traits (embryonic mortality, days to hatch and hatchling length), and that these effects might differ between the two newt species. Temperature affected the number of deposited eggs in smooth newts, but not in alpine newts. Larval hatching success was not affected by oviposition or incubation temperature. Temperature effects on hatching time and hatchling length differed between the two species.

article,Cerebral responses to exercise and the influence of heat stress in human fatigue,"Robertson, Caroline V. and Marino, Frank E.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"There are a number of mechanisms thought to be responsible for the onset of fatigue during exercise-induced hyperthermia. A greater understanding of the way in which fatigue develops during exercise could be gleaned from the studies which have examined the maintenance of cerebral blood flow through the process of cerebral autoregulation. Given that cerebral blood flow is a measure of the cerebral haemodynamics, and might reflect a level of brain activation, it is useful to understand the implications of this response during exercise and in the development of fatigue. It is known that cerebral blood flow is significantly altered under certain conditions such as altitude and exacerbated during exercise induced - hyperthermia. In this brief review we consider the processes of cerebral autoregulation predominantly through the measurement of cerebral blood flow and contrast these responses between exercise undertaken in normothermic versus heat stress conditions in order to draw some conclusions about the role cerebral blood flow might play in determining fatigue.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.10.001,63,NA,10-15,NA,Brain; Blood flow; CNS; Fatigue; Temperature
article,Changes of brain monoamine levels and physiological indexes during heat acclimation in rats,"Nakagawa, Hikaru and Matsumura, Takeru and Suzuki, Kota and Ninomiya, Chisa and Ishiwata, Takayuki",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Brain monoamines, such as noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA), and serotonin (5-HT), regulate many important physiological functions including thermoregulation. The purpose of this study was to clarify changes in NA, DA, and 5-HT levels in several brain regions in response to heat acclimation while also recording body temperature (Tb), heart rate (HR), and locomotor activity (Act). Rats were exposed to a heated environment (32 degrees C) for 3 h (3H), 1 day (1D), 7 days, 14 days (14D), 21 days, or 28 days (28D). After heat exposure, each of the following brain regions were immediately extracted and homogenized: the caudate putamen (CPu), preoptic area (PO), dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), frontal cortex (FC), and hippocampus (Hip). NA, DA, and 5-HT levels in the extract were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Although Tb increased immediately after heat exposure, it decreased about 14D later. HR was maintained at a low level throughout heat exposure, and Act tended to increase near the end of heat exposure. After 3H, we observed a marked increase in NA level in the CPu. Although this response vanished after 1D, the level increased again after 28D. DA level in the CPu decreased significantly from 1D to 28D. 5-HT level in the PO and DMH decreased from 1D to 14D. It returned to control levels after 28D with increment of DA level. 5-HT level in the FC decreased at the start of heat exposure, but recovered after 28D; a time point at which DA level also increased. Monoamine levels in the Hip were unchanged after early heat exposure, but both 5-HT and DA levels increased after 28D. These results provide definitive evidence of changes in monoamines in individual brain regions involved in thermoregulation and behavioral, cognitive, and memory function during both acute and chronic heat exposure.

article,Effect of <i>in vitro</i> zinc supplementation on HSPs expression and Interleukin 10 production in heat treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells of transition Sahiwal and Karan Fries cows,"Sheikh, Aasif Ahmad and Aggarwal, Anjali and Aarif, Ovais",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The changing climatic scenario with apprehended rise in global temperature is likely to affect the livestock adversely vis-a-vis production and reproduction. This has prompted more focus in addressing the unfavorable effects of thermal stress in livestock system. Presuming that the trace element zinc is in-dispensible for cellular antioxidant system and immune function, the present study was designed to investigate the effect of zinc treatment on heat stress alleviation and immune modulation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of indigenous and crossbred transition cows. Twelve cows, six each of Sahiwal and Karan Fries (KF) in their second parity with confirmed pregnancy were selected for the experiment. The blood samples were collected at -21, 0 and +21 days in relation to expected date of calving. The experiment was carried out in vitro after isolating PBMC from whole blood. The 48 h cultured PBMC were subjected to assorted levels of exposures viz. 37 degrees C, 42 degrees C to impose heat stress and 42 degrees C+ zinc to alleviate heat stress and modulate immunity. The PBMC viability was 86\%, 69\% and 78\%, respectively. The mRNA expression of heat shock proteins (HSP 40, 70 and 90 alpha) and Interleukin-10 (IL-10) production varied between the two breeds vis-vis days and levels of exposure. The mRNA expression of HSP40 and HSP70 was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in Karan Fries than the Sahiwal cows. Both the breeds showed maximum expression of HSP on the day of parturition, more so in KF than Sahiwal. There was a significant (P < 0.05) difference in the HSP mRNA expression at different levels of exposure. Zinc treatment to heat stressed PBMC caused a significant (P < 0.05) down regulation of HSP. For immune status, anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10 in the culture supernatant was accessed. The IL-10 was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in Karan Fries (168.18 +/- 14.09 pg/ml) than the Sahiwal cows (147.24 +/- 11.82 pg/m1). The IL-10 concentration was highest on the day of calving.

article,Thermal acclimation in the perch (<i>Perca fluviatilis</i> L.) immunity,"Marnila, Pertti and Lilius, Esa-Matti",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Fish immune systems must be able to cope with pathogens over a wide temperature range. Earlier research suggest that fish are more dependent on innate immune responses based on pattern recognition than acquired functions with specific recognition. If this applies to phagocytes, then opsonins (serum factors that augment phagocytosis e.g. immunoglobulins and complement proteins) attached on zymosan (Z) particles should be recognized better at higher temperatures than Z only. Z is recognized by glucan receptor representing pattern recognition. In this study perch were acclimated to 5 degrees C or 16 degrees C for 3-5 weeks. The recognition and activation of respiratory burst reaction of peripheral blood phagocytes was examined at seven different measurement temperatures (5, 10, 16, 20, 24 27, and 30 degrees C) when the cells were stimulated with Z and serum opsonized zymosan (OZ). Respiratory burst was measured as luminol chemiluminescence (CL) from diluted whole blood. OZ-induced CL per volume of blood was on average approximately 4.6 times higher in 16 degrees C acclimated fish than 5 degrees C acclimated perch (P < 0.0001). Z-induced CL was approximately 3 times higher at lower temperatures in 16 degrees C acclimated perch than 5 degrees C acclimated fish and 6-9 times higher at 27 degrees C and 30 degrees C (P < 0.001), respectively. CL reaction kinetics were faster in perch acclimated to 5 degrees C than 16 degrees C -acclimated fish, especially at low temperatures (P < 0.001). Thermal acclimation caused a 3-4 degrees C shift in temperature response curves of CL towards the acclimation temperature (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.053 in Z and OZ-induced CL, respectively). Serum opsonins activated perch phagocytes substantially better at higher temperatures in both acclimation groups, which is consistent with an earlier study in rainbow trout (O. mykiss). However, opsonin recognition was significantly better in 16 degrees C acclimated perch than 5 degrees C acclimated fish, which was seen as higher CLs for OZ compared to Z, especially at higher temperatures. This is opposite to previously reported results in rainbow trout. Differences between rainbow trout and perch in opsonin recognition by blood phagocytes suggest that the living habits of perch, which prefers approximately a 10 degrees C higher temperature than rainbow trout, may be reflected in immune cell functions. Results of the present examination suggest that also in fish phagocytes pattern recognition is the prevailing system at low temperatures, and specific recognition is more effective at high temperatures.

However, little is known about the changes in molecular processes impacted by incubation temperature in avians. In this study, we investigated the effects of increasing the incubation temperature by 1 degrees C from day 11-20 on the embryonic and posthatch skeletal muscle development of the Peking duck, and identified the differentially expressed genes using RNA-seq of leg muscle tissues. The results showed that altering the incubation temperature had immediate and long-lasting effects on phenotypic changes in the embryonic and post-hatching muscle development. It was shown that expression levels of total 1370 genes were altered in muscle tissues by the thermal treatments. The gene ontology (GO) analyses indicated that cellular processes including metabolism, cell cycle, catalytic activity, and enzyme regulatory activity may have involved in the muscle mass impacted by thermal manipulation. TGF-beta and insulin pathways as two classical muscle development related pathways may also involve in regulating muscle mass. These data may be helpful for understanding the physiological and biochemical processes of muscle development under environmental treatments in embryonic avians. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Effect of thermal manipulation during embryogenesis on liver heat shock protein expression in chronic heat stressed colored broiler chickens,"Vinoth, A. and Thirunalasundari, T. and Tharian, Jenny Anne and Shanmugam, M. and Rajkumar, U.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Thermal manipulation during embryogenesis has been shown to improve thermo tolerance in broilers. Heat shock proteins are a family of proteins produced in response to variety of stress and protect cells from damage. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of thermal manipulation (TM) during embryogenesis on HSP gene and protein expression in the embryos and in chronic heat stressed 42nd day old chicks. On 15th day of incubation, fertile eggs from two breeds-Naked neck (NN) and Punjab Broiler-2 (PB-2) were randomly divided in to two groups, namely Control (C) eggs were incubated under standard incubation conditions and Thermal Conditioning (TC) eggs were exposed to higher incubation temperature (40.5 degrees C) for 3 h on 15th, 16th and 17th day of incubation. The chicks so obtained from each group were further subdivided and reared from 15th-42nd day as normal (N; 25 +/- 1 degrees C, 70\% RH) and heat exposed (HE; 35 +/- 1 degrees C, 50\% RH) resulting in four treatment groups (CN, CHE, TCN and TCHE). Embryos of two groups (C and TC) on 17th day and birds from four treatment groups on 42nd day were sacrificed. Liver was collected for analysis of gene expression by real-time PCR and protein expression by Western blot of Heat Shock Proteins (HSP 90 alpha, HSP 90 beta, HSP 70, HSP 60, HSP 27 and ubiquitin). The plasma collected on 42nd day was analyzed for biochemical parameters. Thermal challenging of embryos of both the breeds caused significant (P <= 0.05) increase in all the HSPs gene and protein expression. The TCHE chicks had significantly (P <= 0.05) lower HSPs gene and protein expressions and oxidative stress compared to CHE groups in both NN and PB-2. Based on these findings it can be concluded that TM during incubation provides adaptation to broiler chicks during chronic heat stress. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein we studied the influence of fluctuating temperatures on biological parameters of V. canescens. Parasitized fifth-instar larvae of Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) were reared individually in incubators at six fluctuating temperature regimes (15-19.5 degrees C with a mean of 17.6 degrees C, 17.5-22.5 degrees C with a mean of 19.8 degrees C, 20-30 degrees C with a mean of 22.7 degrees C, 22.5-27.5 degrees C with a mean of 25 degrees C, 25.5-32.5 degrees C with a mean of 28.3 degrees C and 28.5-33 degrees C with a mean of 30 degrees C) until emergence and death of V. canescens adults. Developmental time from parasitism to adult eclosion, adult longevity and survival were recorded at each fluctuating temperature regime. In principle, developmental time decreased with an increase of the mean temperature of the fluctuating temperature regime. Upper and lower threshold temperatures for total development were estimated at 34.9 and 6.7 degrees C, respectively. Optimum temperature for development and thermal constant were 28.6 degrees C and 526.3 degree days, respectively. Adult longevity was also affected by fluctuating temperature, as it was significantly reduced at the highest mean temperature (7.0 days at 30 degrees C) compared to the lowest one (29.4 days at 17.6 degrees C). Survival was low at all tested fluctuating temperatures, apart from mean fluctuating temperature of 25 degrees C (37\%). Understanding the thermal biology of V. canescens under more natural conditions is of critical importance in applied contexts. Thus, predictions of biological responses to fluctuating temperatures may be used in population forecasting models which potentially influence decision-making in IPM programs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Modelling and quantification of the thermoregulatory responses of the developing avian embryo: Electrical analogies of a physiological system,"Youssef, Ali and Exadaktylos, Vasileios and Berckmans, Daniel",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Homeothermic animals, including birds, try to keep their body temperature at a constant level within certain boundaries by using thermoregulatory mechanisms. However, during incubation, the thermoregulatory system of the chicken embryo evolves through different stages from a poikilothermic to a homeothermic system. Hence, the thermal response of the fertile egg to changes in ambient temperature is different from one day to another during the embryonic development. The incubated egg can be considered as a physical (thermal) system, which transfers energy (heat) down a potential gradient (temperature difference). The heat flow between the micro-environment and the eggshell under a thermal driving force (temperature difference) has been studied in the past by using the analogy to the flow of electric charge under an electromotive-force. In this work, the thermal-response of incubated eggs to a step-increase in ambient-air temperature is studied and modelled. It is shown that the incubated egg is reacting as a first-order system between embryonic days ED01 and ED13, while, starting from ED14, the egg is reacting as a second-order system. This extends the existing RC (resistor-capacitor) circuit analogue to an RLC (resistor-inductor-capacitor) circuit analogue at the later stage of incubation. The concept of considering the fertile egg and its surrounding environment as an energy-handling device is introduced in this paper. It is suggested that the thermoregulation of the embryo has a thermal induction-like effect starting from ED14 and increasing gradually till hatching. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

article,The effect of seasonal temperature variation on behaviour and metabolism in the freshwater mussel (<i>Unio tumidus</i>),"Lurman, Glenn J. and Walter, Johanna and Hoppeler, Hans H.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature plays a critical role in determining the biology of ectotherms. Many animals have evolved mechanisms that allow them to compensate biological rates, i.e. adjust biological rates to overcome thermodynamic effects. For low energy-organisms, such as bivalves, the costs of thermal compensation may be greater than the benefits, and thus prohibitive. To examine this, two experiments were designed to explore thermal compensation in Unio tumidus. Experiment 1 examined seasonal changes in behaviour in U. tumidus throughout a year. Temperature had a clear effect on burrowing rate with no evidence of compensation. Valve closure duration and frequency were also strongly affected by seasonal temperature change, but there was slight evidence of partial compensation. Experiment 2 examined oxygen consumption during burrowing, immediately following valve opening and at rest in summer (24 degrees C), autumn (14 degrees C), winter (4 degrees C), and spring (14 degrees C) acclimatized U. tumidus. Again, there was little evidence of burrowing rate compensation, but some evidence of partial compensation of valve closure duration and frequency. None of the oxygen compensation rates showed any evidence of thermal compensation. Thus, in general, there was only very limited evidence of thermal compensation of behaviour and no evidence of thermal compensation of oxygen compensation rates. Based upon this evidence, we argue that there is no evolutionary pressure for these bivalves to compensate these biological rates. Any pressure may be to maintain or even lower oxygen consumption as their only defence against predation is to close their valves and wait. An increase in oxygen consumption will be detrimental in this regard so the cost of thermal compensation may outweigh the benefits. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

B. N.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Effects of fluctuations in habitat temperature (18-30 degrees) on mitochondrial respiratory behavior and oxidative metabolic responses in the euryhaline ectotherm Scylla serrate are not fully understood. In the present study, effects of different temperatures ranging from 12 to 40 degrees C on glutamate and succinate mediated mitochondrial respiration, respiratory control ratio (RCR), ATP generation rate, ratio for the utilization of phosphate molecules per atomic oxygen consumption (P/O), levels of lipid peroxidation and H2O2 in isolated gill mitochondria of S. serrata are reported. The pattern of variation in the studied parameters was similar for the two substrates at different temperatures. The values recorded for RCR ( >= 3) and P/O ratio (1.4-2.7) at the temperature range of 15-25 degrees C were within the normal range reported for other animals (3-10 for RCR and 1.5-3 for P/O). Values for P/O ratio, ATP generation rate and RCR were highest at 18 degrees C when compared to the other assay temperatures. However, at low and high extreme temperatures, i.e. at 12 and 40 degrees C, states III and IV respiration rates were not clearly distinguishable from each other indicating that mitochondria were completely uncoupled. Positive correlations were noticed between temperature and the levels of both lipid peroxidation and H2O2. It is inferred that fluctuations on either side of ambient habitat temperature may adversely influence mitochondria respiration and oxidative metabolism in S. serrata. The results provide baseline data to understand the impacts of acute changes in temperature on ectotherms inhabiting estuarine or marine environments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To understand the physiological and ecological adaptations of Eothenomys olitor, we measured their metabolic rate, thermal conductance, body temperature (T-b) and evaporative water loss at a temperature range of 5-30 degrees C in summer. The thermal neutral zone (TNZ) of E. olitor was 20-27.5 degrees C. and the mean body temperature was 35.81 +/- 0.15 degrees C. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) was 2.81 +/- 0.11 ml O-2/g h and mean minimum thermal conductance (C-m) was 0.18 +/- 0.01 ml O-2/g h degrees C. Evaporative water loss (EWL) in E. olitor increased when the ambient temperature increased. The maximal evaporative water loss was 6.74 +/- 0.19 mg H2O/g h at 30 degrees C. These results indicated that E. olitor have relatively high BMR, low body temperature, low lower critical temperature, and normal thermal conductance. EWL plays an inportant role in temperature regulation. These characteristics are closely related to the living habitat of the species, and represent its adaptive strategy to the climate of the Yunnan-Kweichow Plateau, a low-latitude, high-altitude region where annual temperature fluctuations are small, but daily temperature fluctuations are greater.

However, increasing taurine concentrations in the diet improved feed intake and egg production (P = 0.001), but also the apparent digestibilities (P <= 0.027) in quails reared under HS. The greater doses (5 g/kg) of taurine resulted in more responses.

As a result, some ground-nesting avian species have adapted behavioral strategies to maintain thermal regulation of eggs and themselves. We assessed the impact of sand temperature on shorebird nesting behaviors by installing video cameras and thermocouples at 52 Least Tern and 55 Piping Plover nests on the Missouri River in North Dakota during the 2014-2015 breeding seasons. Daily duration and frequency of shading behaviors exhibited a nonlinear relationship with temperature; therefore, we used segmented regressions to determine at what threshold temperature (mean temperature = 25.7 degrees C for shading behavior daily frequency and mean temperature = 25.1 degrees C for shading behavior daily duration) shorebird adults exhibited a behavioral response to rising sand temperatures. Daily nest attendance of both species decreased with increasing sand temperatures in our system.

article,Microclimate modelling of beach sand temperatures reveals high spatial and temporal variation at sea turtle rookeries,"Bentley, Blair P. and Kearney, Michael R. and Whiting, Scott D. and Mitchell, Nicola J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The continual development of ecological models and availability of high-resolution gridded climate surfaces have stimulated studies that link climate variables to functional traits of organisms. A primary constraint of these studies is the ability to reliably predict the microclimate that an organism experiences using macroscale climate inputs. This is particularly important in regions where access to empirical information is limited. Here, we contrast correlative models based on both ambient and sea surface temperatures to mechanistic modelling approaches to predict beach sand temperatures at depths relevant to sea turtle nesting. We show that mechanistic models are congruent with correlative models at predicting sand temperatures. We used these predictions to explore thermal variation across 46 mainland and island beaches that span the geographical range of sea turtle nesting in Western Australia. Using high resolution gridded climate surfaces and site-specific soil reflectance, we predict almost 9 degrees C variation in average annual temperatures between beaches, and nearly 10 degrees C variation in average temperatures during turtle nesting seasons. Validation of models demonstrated that predictions were typically within 2 degrees C of observations and, although most sites had high correlations (r(2) > 0.7), predictive capacity varied between sites. An advantage of the mechanistic model demonstrated here is that it can be used to explore the impacts of climate change on sea turtle nesting beach temperatures as, unlike correlative models, it can be forced with novel combinations of environmental variables.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102522,88,NA,NA,102522,Microclimate; Mechanistic model; Sea turtle; Rookery; Beach; Thermal environment

Galapagos Lava Lizards live in seasonal environments that are characterized by a warm and wet period when reproductive activity is maximal, and cooler and drier period. With the use of radiotelemetric techniques to record lizard surface temperatures (T-s), we studied the thermal ecology of the San Cristobal Lava Lizard (Microlophus bivittatus) during both the warm and cool seasons over two years. During the diel activity period and when operative temperatures exceeded Tset-min, at least on rock faces without canopy, 52\% or less of the T-s observations fell within the laboratory-determined T-set range (36-40 degrees C). Therefore, lizards may have avoided very warm midday temperatures in shaded microhabitats and the lag times in changes in T-s values occurred as operative temperatures rose rapidly during late morning warming phase. Lizards effectively thermoregulated during a year with moderate warm season temperatures and during a cool season that was unseasonably warm. In contrast, lizards less effectively thermoregulated during the warmest and coolest years of the study. We did not detect intersexual differences in thermoregulation although males may thermoregulate less effectively than do females during the cool season although we were unable to detect significant differences using our nonparametric statistical techniques.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102518,88,NA,NA,102518,Microlophus; Gala; Pagos; Thermal biology
article,Numerical analysis of power dissipation requirement in magnetic hyperthermia problems,"Liu, Kuo-Chi and Cheng, Po-Jen",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Control of the therapeutic temperature is essential in performing magnetic fluid hyperthermia. Thus, reliable predictions of the power dissipation are required to determine the correct dosage of magnetic particles to be injected into the cancerous tissue prior to treatment. To meet this requirement, the present study evaluates the power dissipation requirement for two magnetic hyperthermia problems reported in the literature. There is a significant challenge for solving the bio-heat transfer model for concentric bi-layered solid spheres. Consequently, the present study employs a hybrid technique based on Laplace transformation and a modified discretization scheme to solve the considered hyperthermia problems. Analytical solutions are provided to demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach. The unreliability of the results presented in the literature is then demonstrated using the proposed numerical scheme. In general, the results presented in this study show that the power dissipation required to maintain an effective temperature range in the tumor domain is related to the rate of temperature rise, the tumor size, the blood perfusion rate, and the tissue properties. In particular, the power dissipation should be increased for the cooling effect of blood perfusion or a smaller tumor volume.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102430,86,NA,NA,102430,Bi-layered solid sphere; Hyperthermia; Laplace transform; Power dissipation
article,Modeling operative temperature in desert tortoises and other reptiles: Effects imposed by habitats that filter incident radiation,"Snyder, S. J. and Tracy, C. R. and Nussear, K. E.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"We challenged the common practice of using a single mean absorptance based on unfiltered skylight spectra to model operative temperature for reptiles in filtered light habitats by examining the effects of plant canopies on light transmittance. To assess differences in light filtration over a range of microhabitats, spectra were recorded under canopies of desert plants, tropical plants, and under unfiltered skylight. Spectra were then integrated with absorptivity curves of desert reptiles to determine if differences in light quality among microhabitat types changed integrated mean absorptance. Finally, we used the desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) as a case study to investigate the effects of filtered microhabitats on paint choice for physical operative temperature models and determined the magnitude of error that could result from discrepancies between paint and animal absorptance. We found that light energy was partitioned similarly among microhabitats with like canopy types and that most variation was explained by differences in transmittance between the visible and near infrared wavelengths. Mean absorptance for reptiles was similar among microhabitats with the greatest differences observed between animals in unfiltered skylight and under tropical canopies. In most microhabitats paint and tortoise absorptances differed, but operative temperatures were nearly identical within microhabitats no matter the absorptance used in the model.

article,Exercise heat acclimation causes post-exercise hypotension and favorable improvements in lipid and immune profiles: A crossover randomized controlled trial,"Rivas, Eric and Crandall, Craig G. and Suman, Oscar E. and Moustaid-Moussa, Naima and Ben-Ezra, Vic",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Background: Passive hyperthermic exposure causes an acute hypotensive response following the cessation of heat stress. Chronic heat stress is well documented in animal studies to instigate metabolic and lipid alterations. However, it is unknown if exercise-heat acclimation also causes favorable chronic blood pressure, lipid, and immune responses in humans. Purpose: This project tested the hypothesis that 10-day exercise-heat acclimation (HA) would cause greater post-exercise reductions in arterial blood pressure and favorable metabolic, lipid, and immune responses compared to 10-day exercise under neutral conditions (CON). Methods: Thirteen healthy sedentary participants (8M/5F, 28 +/- 6y, 78 +/- 17 kg), completed a 10-day (90 min/day exercise bout) damped hyperthermia HA (increase internal temperature 1.5 degrees C, in 42 degrees C, 28\% Rh) and control (CON: 23 degrees C, 42\% Rh) protocols in a counterbalanced design with a 2 month washout. Pre- and postexercise HA/CON blood pressures were taken 1-h post-exercise on exercise days 1 and 10. Metabolic, lipid and immune panels were taken pre-post HA/CON. Results: Exercise under heat stress had greater post-exercise hypotension (systolic; -6 mmHg, diastolic; -8 mmHg; and mean arterial pressure; -7 mmHg) on both days 1 and 10 compared to exercise under neutral conditions (main effect for condition, P <= 0.004), Only from pre-to-post HA, total cholesterol (168 +/- 19 to 157 +/- 15; P < 0.03) and triglycerides (137 +/- 45 to 111 +/- 30; P < 0.03) were reduced, while absolute lymphocytes (-26\%), monocytes (- 22\%), and basophils (- 49\%) significantly decreased (each P <= 0.04). Relative values of neutrophils increased (18\%) and lymphocytes decreased (- 20\%) only after HA (P <= 0.04). Conclusion: These data indicate that exercise in the heat (regardless of acclimation status) causes a profound post-exercise hypotensive response, while HA causes favorable lipid, and immune profile changes. Further examination of exercise-heat acclimation on vascular, metabolic, and immune responses will offer insight for benefits in other clinical populations with vascular, metabolic and immune dysfunction.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.017,84,NA,266-273,NA,Hyperthermia; Blood pressure; Exercise heat therapy; Thermal stress
article,Effects of air temperatures on antioxidant defense and immunity in Mongolian gerbils,"Xu, De-Li and Xu, Meng-Meng and Wang, De-Hua",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature influences many physiological processes including antioxidant defense and immunity. The hypothesis that air temperatures has no effects on antioxidant defense and innate immunity in Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) was tested. Thirty-three male gerbils were randomly divided into the 4 degrees C (n = 11), 23 degrees C (n = 11) and 32 degrees C groups (n = 11), in which the treatment course lasted for 27 days. We found that air temperatures had no effects on body mass. At lower temperature, gross energy intake and the masses of most organs were higher, whereas fat free dry carcass and body fat were lower. H2O2 titres increased in liver but decreased in small intestine, and remained unchanged in heart, kidney and testis upon cold exposure. At lower temperature, malonaldehyde (MDA) content was higher in the liver, lower in kidneys and testis, and did not differ in the heart and small intestine. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in liver were higher in 4 degrees C group than 23 degrees C group, while liver catalase (CAT) activity was lower in the 4 degrees C group than in the 23 degrees C group. No significant difference was observed in the activities of SOD, CAT and T-AOC in the heart, kidney, testis and small intestine among the 4 degrees C, 23 degrees C and 32 degrees C groups. As expected, bacteria killing capacity indicating innate immunity, white blood cells and thymus mass were all not affected by air temperatures. Similarly, air temperatures had no effect on the levels of testosterone and corticosterone, both of which were not correlated with innate immunity, H2O2 and MDA levels, the activity of SOD, CAT, and T-AOC in all the detected tissues. In conclusion, air temperature affected antioxidant capacity, but not immune responses or serum concentrations of corticosterone and testosterone. Overall, up-regulation or maintenance of antioxidant defenses and immunity might be an important mechanism for gerbils to survive highly variable temperature.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.06.008,84,NA,111-120,NA,Antioxidant defense; Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus); Immunity; Temperature

The fish were fed four isonitrogenous (28\% crude protein), isocaloric (500 kcal/100 g) diets containing four lipid sources; fish oil (FO), corn oil (CO), coconut oil (COCO) or fish oil/ corn oil mixture (1:1 ratio) (oil mix). The diets were offered to the fish at a daily rate of 3\% of their body weights (BW), twice a day for two months. After the feeding trial, the fish were exposed to decreasing water temperature from 25 degrees C until the appearance of death symptoms. The results revealed that FO-based diets (FO and oil mix) produced the best growth rates and feed efficiency, followed by corn oil diet, while COCO resulted in the lowest performance. Fish fed on CO and oil mix showed higher body unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) and lower lethal temperature than those fed on FO- or COCO-based diets. These results indicate that cold shock can modify the lipid metabolism in Nile tilapia by lowering total body saturated fatty acids and raising n-6 and n-3 UFA. This finding suggests that the inclusion of high levels of plant oils in Nile tilapia feeds can enhance their cold tolerance.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.11.009,79,NA,50-55,NA,Nile tilapia; Growth; Fatty acids; Cold tolerance; Oil sources

article,Effects of developmental acclimation on fitness costs differ between two aphid species,"Cao, Jun-Yu and Xing, Kun and Liu, Hui-Ping and Zhao, Fei",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Most ectotherms are able to increase their tolerance to heat stress via the acclimation response. However, there is ongoing debate about whether the acclimation response is associated with fitness costs, and what factors can affect the consequences of acclimation are still unclear. To elucidate this, we sought to determine whether fitness costs varied with acclimation conditions in two cereal aphids, Sitobion avenae and Rhopalosiphum padi. Thus, the basal and inducible thermal tolerances (maximum critical temperature {[}CTmax]) and fitness traits (proportion of adult emergence, adult longevity, fecundity, and population parameters) of adult aphids were measured under three conditions of developmental acclimation: 1) 22 degrees C constant temperature (no acclimation), 2) 22 degrees C + 34 degrees C for 2 h per day (low daytime temperature), and 3) 22 degrees C + 38 degrees C for 2 h per day (high daytime temperature). We found that the thermal tolerances of both species were significantly higher following developmental acclimation, where higher basal and inducible thermal tolerances were observed in R. padi than in S. avenae. Low daytime temperature acclimation conditions (34 degrees C) resulted in negligible reproductive costs and improved the intrinsic rates of population increase in both species. In contrast, substantial fitness costs were detected in both species in response to high daytime temperature acclimation (38 degrees C), especially for S. avenae. Our results indicate that the effects of acclimation conditions on fitness costs differ between the two aphid species. These findings will not only enhance our understanding of species dynamics in the context of climate change but could also potentially improve pest control efforts.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.09.004,78,NA,58-64,NA,Acclimation response; Cereal aphid; Climate change; Cost; Thermal tolerance
article,Thermal preferences of bird schistosome snail hosts increase the risk of swimmer's itch,"Zbikowska, Elibieta and Marszewska, Anna",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Ambient temperature strongly affects host parasite interactions, especially when both are ectothermic. Bird schistosomes, which cercariae are known as agents of swimmer's itch and their snail hosts can be a good example of this phenomenon. The snails of these parasites play the key role, as the source of harmful larvae. Cercarial dermatitis is noted even in areas when prevalence of parasites in snail populations is very low. The main question is what adaptation in snail-fluke association can lead to a sufficient number of cercariae causing swimmer's itch in lake water? The influence of ambient temperature on snail survival and cercarial production as well as the thermal preferences of two host species naturally infected with bird schistosomes were studied. The 24-h preferences of Lymnaea stagnalis infected with Trichobilharzia szidati, and Planorbarius corneas infected with Bilharziella polonica were recorded using an oblong thermal gradient set (OTGS). Both cercariae releasing hosts of bird schistosomes preferred a significantly lower temperature than non-infected snails. Additionally, at a higher temperature, the survival of snail hosts was shortened as a result of the increase in daily cercarial expulsion. An especially interesting result concerns the release of a significantly larger total cercariae number by L. stagnalis at lower than at higher temperatures. These data indicate that preferences of infected snails to low temperature microhabitats can increase host survival and parasite success, as well as affecting the increase in the number of invasive larvae in the environment increasing the risk of swimmer's itch.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.08.023,78,NA,22-26,NA,Cercarial dermatitis; Bird schistosomes; Snail host; Thermal preferences

In this study, Nrf2 was first identified and characterized in the Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus). A. davidianus was exposed to a high ambient temperature of 30 degrees C for various periods of time (0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h). We investigated the effects of heat stress on alterations of the hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, the activities of lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), the histology of the liver, and the mRNA expression patterns of 11 genes involved in the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant pathway in A. davidianus. The results showed that both the hepatic LDH activity and MDA content significantly increased after heat exposure, indicating that heat stress could induce cell injury and oxidative damage. Histological analysis of the liver showed that heat stress caused hepatocyte abnormalities, fat accumulation and ultrastructural alterations of the hepatocytes, endoplasmic reticulum and nuclei. The expression patterns of genes involved in the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant pathway in the liver were distinct when A. davidianus was exposed to heat stress. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first on the characterization of Nrf2 in A. davidianus and even in amphibians. The results indicated that heat stress could induce oxidative damage, and the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway might play a critical role in the resistance against heat stress in A. davidianus.

article,Two-dimensional closed-form model for temperature in living tissues for hyperthermia treatments,"Dutta, Jaideep and Kundu, Balaram",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"This research article determines an exact analytical expression for 2-D thermal field in single layer living tissues under a therapeutic condition by means of Fourier and non-Fourier heat transfer approaches. An actual spatially dependent initial condition has been adopted to analyze the heat propagation in tissues. The exact analytical determination for this actual initial condition for temperature may be difficult. However, in this study, an approximate analytical method has newly been established for an appropriate initial condition. With this initial expression, an exact temperature distribution for 2-D heat conduction in plane co-ordinates has been investigated for the predefined therapeutic boundary condition to have knowledge for practical aspects of the thermal therapy. Laplace Transform Method (LTM) in conjunction with the Inversion Theorem is used for the analytical solution treatment. We have utilized both Pennes' bioheat equation (PBHE) and thermal wave model of bioheat equation (TWMBHE) for the analysis. The influence of thermo-biological behavior on 2-D heat conduction in tissues has been studied with the variation of several dependable parameters in relation to the Hyperthermia treatment protocol in a moderate temperature range (42-45 degrees C). The result in the present study has been evidenced for the biological heat transfer for the enforcement of different circumstances and also has been validated with the published value where the maximum temperature deviation of 2.6\% has been recorded. We conclude that the temperature curve for TWMBHE model shows a higher waveform nature for low thermal relaxation time and this wavy nature gradually diminishes with an increase in relaxation time. The maximum peak temperature attains 46.3 degrees C for the relaxation time = 2 s and with the increase in the relaxation time the peak temperature gradually falls.

The sub-lethal effects of water temperature on egg development was investigated in three syntopic mountain stream insects, viz. Lestagella penicillata (Ephemeroptera: Teloganodidae), Aphanicercella scutata (Plecoptera: Notonemouridae) and Chimarra ambulans (Trichoptera: Philopotamidae) from the winter rainfall Western Cape Province, South Africa. 2. Eggs of each species were incubated after fertilisation at six temperature treatments across the range of 5-30 degrees C. Total development time required for 50\% hatch, total hatch success, duration of the hatching period, upper and lower thermal limits for development, as well as thermal reaction norms were calculated for each species. 3. Successful egg development and hatching occurred between 10 and 20 degrees C for L. penicillata, with highest percentage hatch (90\%) at 10, 15 and 20 degrees C treatments. For A. scutata successful hatching also occurred between 10 and 20 degrees C but hatching success was reduced (30\%) at 20 degrees C compared to 80\% hatching success at 10 and 15 degrees C treatments. For degrees C. ambulans, successful development and hatching occurred over a wider range of temperatures (10-25 degrees C) but with lower (5-20\%) and more variable hatching success at all temperatures. 4. Thermal reaction norms in conjunction with egg hatch parameters showed that L. penicillata and particularly C. ambulans were warm adapted, while the A. scutata was cold adapted. These observed differences in egg development characteristics similarly relate to the different life-histories and their relation to developmental season. 5.

article,Phylogenetic analysis of the allometry of metabolic rate and mitochondrial basal proton leak,"Polymeropoulos, Elias T. and Oelkrug, R. and White, C. R. and Jastroch, M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The mitochondrial basal proton leak (MBPL) significantly contributes to high body temperatures (T-b) and basal metabolic rates (BMR) in endotherms. In endotherms at a given body mass (M), liver MBPL is higher than in ectotherms, supporting the notion that MBPL may partly explain the evolutionary increase in metabolic rate (MR), fostering endothermy. Here, we re-addressed this assumption by performing a phylogenetic analysis comparing all available liver MBPL data for ecto- and endotherms. While MBPL within endotherms negatively scales with M and BMR as shown previously, MBPL of ectotherms does not scale allometrically with M. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that this result is confounded by a positive scaling coefficient for MBPL with M for reptiles. Strikingly, the reptilian MBPL reaches endothermic levels above a body mass of 6.6 kg. Thus, phylogenetic scaling of MBPL supports previous claims of endotherm-like physiological characteristics in large reptiles. It appears that diversification of ancestral ectothermic tetrapods to a body mass of at least 6 kg may have been required to reach a MBPL that is beneficial for sustained high body temperatures. Novel MBPL data for the lesser hedgehog tenrec, a protoendothermic eutherian that displays reptile-like thermoregulatory patterns, fall within the endo- and ecto thermic allometric regressions. Finally, we add additional evidence that within endotherms, phylogenetic differences in MR do not correlate with MBPL. Collectively, these data suggest that MBPL does not universally scale with metabolic rate in ecto- or endotherms and that an increasing MBPL with M may have played an important physiological role in the evolutionary history of reptilian thermoregulation.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.01.013,68,A,83-88,NA,Mitochondrial proton leak; Metabolic rate; Allometry; Phylogeny; Scaling

Therefore, the aim of this study was to use dynamic infrared (IR) imaging to examine the relationship between dorsal and palmar hand skin temperature. The palmar and dorsal hand skin temperature before and after a cold stress test was measured with IR thermography in 112 healthy participants. Calculation of surface average temperature was made from nine regions of interest on each hand's dorsal and palmar side. Temperature values were recorded at baseline, directly after immersion of hands in vinyl gloves for one minute in water at 20 +/- 0.5 degrees C (gloves removed), and after eight minutes rewarming. Results showed that: a) the skin temperatures on the dorsal and palmar sides of the hand are strongly correlated; b) the correlation is stronger on the fingers than on the carpometacarpal (CMC) area; c) the palmar side of the CMC area is warmer than the dorsal side, but this is reversed in the fingers so that the nail bed is warmer than the finger pad; and d) the temperature difference Delta T between the dorsal and palmar sides of the fingers is independent of the skin temperature, though Delta T on the CMC area of the hand is temperature dependent. Such differences can be important in detailed investigations of thermal phenomena in the hand. In conclusion, results showed a strong correlation between the dorsal and palmar temperatures.

article,Thermal tolerance and preference of exploited turbinid snails near their range limit in a global warming hotspot,"Ab Lah, Roslizawati and Benkendorff, Kirsten and Bucher, Daniel",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Predicted global climate change has prompted numerous studies of thermal tolerances of marine species. The upper thermal tolerance is unknown for most marine species, but will determine their vulnerability to ocean warming. Gastropods in the family Turbinidae are widely harvested for human consumption. To investigate the responses of turbinid snails to future conditions we determined critical thermal maxima (CTMax) and preferred temperatures of Turbo militaris and Lunella undulata from the tropical-temperate overlap region of northern New South Wales, on the Australian east coast. CTMax were determined at two warming rates: 1 degrees C/30 min and 1 degrees C/12 h. The number of snails that lost attachment to the tank wall was recorded at ``each temperature increment. At the faster rate, T militaris had a significantly higher CTMax (34.0 degrees C) than L. undulata (32.2 degrees C). At the slower rate the mean of both species was lower and there was no significant difference between them (29.4 degrees C for T. militaris and 29.6 degrees C for L. undulata). This is consistent with differences in thermal inertia possibly allowing animals to tolerate short periods at higher temperatures than is possible during longer exposure times, but other mechanisms are not discounted. The thermoregulatory behaviour of the turban snails was determined in a horizontal thermal gradient. Both species actively sought out particular temperatures along the gradient, suggesting that behavioural responses may be important in ameliorating short-term temperature changes. The preferred temperatures of both species were higher at night (24.0 degrees C and 26.0 degrees C) than during the day (22.0 degrees C and 23.9 degrees C). As the snails approached their preferred temperature, net hourly displacement decreased. Preferred temperatures were within the average seasonal seawater temperature range in this region. However, with future predicted water temperature trends, the species could experience increased periods of thermal stress, possibly exceeding CTMax and potentially leading to range contractions.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.01.008,64,NA,100-108,NA,Critical thermal maximum; Thermal gradient; Global climate change; Turbo militaris; Lunella undulata; Eastern Australia
article,Numerical investigation of thermal response of laser-irradiated biological tissue phantoms embedded with gold nanoshells,"Phadnis, Akshay and Kumar, Sumit and Srivastava, Atul",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The work presented in this paper focuses on numerically investigating the thermal response of gold nanoshells-embedded biological tissue phantoms with potential applications into photo-thermal therapy wherein the interest is in destroying the cancerous cells with minimum damage to the surrounding healthy cells. The tissue phantom has been irradiated with a pico-second laser. Radiative transfer equation (RTE) has been employed to model the light-tissue interaction using discrete ordinate method (DOM). For determining the temperature distribution inside the tissue phantom, the RTE has been solved in combination with a generalized non-Fourier heat conduction model namely the dual phase lag bio-heat transfer model. The numerical code comprising the coupled RTE-bio-heat transfer equation, developed as a part of the current work, has been benchmarked against the experimental as well as the numerical results available in the literature. It has been demonstrated that the temperature of the optical inhomogeneity inside the biological tissue phantom embedded with gold nanoshells is relatively higher than that of the baseline case (no nanoshells) for the same laser power and operation time. The study clearly underlines the impact of nanoshell concentration and its size on the thermal response of the biological tissue sample. The comparative study concerned with the size and concentration of nanoshells showed that 60 nm nanoshells with concentration of 5 x 10(15) mm(-3) result into the temperature levels that are optimum for the irreversible destruction of cancer infected cells in the context of photo-thermal therapy. To. the best of the knowledge of the authors, the present study is one of the first attempts to quantify the influence of gold nanoshells on the temperature distributions inside the biological tissue phantoms upon laser irradiation using the dual phase lag heat conduction model.

article,Transcriptome profiling of two Iberian freshwater fish exposed to thermal stress,"Jesus, Tiago Filipe and Grosso, Ana Rita and Fonseca Almeida-Val, Vera Maria and Coelho, Maria Manuela",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The congeneric freshwater fish Squalius carolitertii and S. torgalensis inhabit different Iberian regions with distinct climates; Atlantic in the North and Mediterranean in the South, respectively. While northern regions present mild temperatures, fish in southern regions often experience harsh temperatures and droughts. Previous work with two hsp70 genes suggested that S. torgalensis is better adapted to harsher thermal conditions than S. carolitertii as a result of the different environmental conditions. We present a transcriptomic characterisation of these species' thermal stress responses. Through differential gene expression analysis of the recently available transcriptomes of these two endemic fish species, comprising 12 RNA-seq libraries from three tissues (skeletal muscle, liver and fins) of fish exposed to control (18 degrees C) and test (30 degrees C) conditions, we intend to lay the foundations for further studies on the effects of temperature given predicted climate changes. Results showed that S. carolitertii had more upregulated genes, many of which are involved in transcription regulation, whereas S. torgalensis had more downregulated genes, particularly those responsible for cell division and growth. However, both species displayed increased gene expression of many hsps genes, suggesting that they are able to deal with protein damage caused by heat, though with a greater response in S. torgalensis. Together, our results suggest that S. torgalensis may have an energy saving strategy during short periods of high temperatures, re-allocating resources from growth to stress response mechanisms. In contrast, S. carolitertii regulates its metabolism by increasing the expression of genes involved in transcription and promoting the stress response, probably to maintain homoeostasis. Additionally, we indicate a set of potential target genes for further studies that may be particularly suited to monitoring the responses of Cyprinidae to changing temperatures, particularly for species living in similar conditions in the Mediterranean Peninsulas.

article,Heat exposure increases circulating fatty acids but not lipid oxidation at rest and during exercise,"O'Hearn, Katharine and Tingelstad, Hans Christian and Blondin, Denis and Tang, Vera and Filion, Lionel G. and Haman, Francois",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Alterations in lipid oxidation during exercise have been well studied, but limited data exists on the effects of passive heat exposure and exercise in the heat on changes in lipid oxidation. This study was designed to examine: (1) the effects of heat exposure on lipid metabolism during passive heating and subsequent exercise in the heat by focusing on changes in whole-body lipid oxidation and plasma lipid concentrations, and (2) the effects of extended passive pre-heating on exercise performance in the heat. Male participants (n=8) were passively heated for 120 min at 42 degrees C, then exercised on a treadmill in the same temperature at 50\% (V) over dotO(2max) for 30 min (HEAT). This same procedure was followed on a separate occasion at 23 degrees C (CON). Results showed that lipid oxidation rates were not different between HEAT and CON during passive heating or exercise. However, non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations were significantly higher following passive heating (618 mu M, 95\% CI: 479-757) compared to CON (391 mu M, 95\% CI: 270-511). The same trend was observed following exercise (2036 mu M, 95\% CI: 1604-2469 for HEAT and 1351 mu M, 95\% CI: 1002-1699). Triacylglycerol, phospholipid and cholesterol levels were not different between HEAT and CON at any point. Four of 8 participants could not complete 30 min of exercise in HEAT, resulting in a 14\% decline in total external work. Rate of perceived exertion over the final 5 min of exercise was higher in HEAT (9.5) than CON (5). We conclude that: (1) heat exposure results in increased circulating NEFA at rest and during exercise without changes in whole-body lipid utilization, and (2) passive pre-heating reduces work capacity during exercise in the heat and increases the perceived intensity of a given workload.

article,"Thermal ecology of the post-metamorphic Andean toad (<i>Rhinella spinulosa</i>) at elevation in the monte desert, Argentina","Sanabria, Eduardo A. and Rodriguez, Cesar Y. and Vergara, Cristina and Ontivero, Emanuel and Banchig, Mariana and Navas, Ana L. and Herrera-Morata, Mario A. and Quiroga, Lorena B.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Rhinella spinulosa is an anuran toad species distributed latitudinal and altitudinal (1200-5000 m) from Peru to Argentina, inhabiting mountain valleys in the Andes. Considering the broad range of habitats where they live, it is important to understand the thermal physiological mechanisms, thermal tolerances and physiological adaptations for surviving in rigorous environments. We investigated the thermal parameters (field body temperature, selected body temperature, locomotor performance in field and laboratory conditions, and thermal extremes) during diurnal activity for a population of juvenile, post-meta-morphosed toads (Rhinella spinulosa) from the Monte Desert of San Juan, Argentina. Post-metamorphic toads are active from approximately 1100-1900 (in contrast to nocturnal adult toads). Our findings show that these toads have a wide thermal tolerance range, ranging from a critical thermal maximum of 36.9 degrees C to crystallization temperatures below 0 degrees C. During their active period, toads always showed suboptimal thermal conditions for locomotion. Despite the suboptimal condition for the locomotion, diurnal activity is likely to confer thermal advantages, allowing them to search for food and increase digestion and growth rates. We also found that the toads are capable of super-cooling, which prevents mortality from freezing when the environmental temperatures drop below 0 degrees C. The environmental temperatures are below zero at night, when toads are inactive and take refuge under rocks. In summary, this toad population demonstrates high thermal plasticity, as shown by a relatively high level of activity sustained over a wide range of ambient temperature (similar to 35 degrees C). These thermal adaptations allow this species of juvenile toads to inhabit a wide range of altitudes and latitudes.

article,Correction of the heat loss method for calculating clothing real evaporative resistance,"Wang, Faming and Zhang, Chengjiao and Lu, Yehu",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In the so-called isothermal condition (i.e., T-air {[}air temperature] = T-manikin {[}manikin temperature] = T-r {[}radiant temperature]), the actual energy used for moisture evaporation detected by most sweating manikins was underestimated due to the uncontrolled fabric `skin' temperature T-skf (i.e., T-skf<T-manikin). Thus, it must be corrected before being used to compute the clothing real evaporative resistance. In this study, correction of the real evaporative heat loss from the wet fabric `skin'-clothing system was proposed and experimentally validated on a Newton' sweating manikin. The real evaporative resistance of five clothing ensembles and the nude fabric `skin' calculated by the corrected heat loss method was also reported and compared with that by the mass loss method. Results revealed that, depending on the types of tested clothing, different amounts of heat were drawn from the ambient environment. In general, a greater amount of heat was drawn from the ambient environment by the wet fabric `skin'-clothing system in lower thermal insulation clothing than that in higher insulation clothing. There were no significant differences between clothing real evaporative resistances calculated by the corrected heat loss method and those by the mass loss method. It was therefore concluded that the correction method proposed in this study has been successfully validated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Repeatability of a running heat tolerance test,"Mee, Jessica A. and Doust, Jo and Maxwell, Neil S.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"At present there is no standardised heat tolerance test (HIT) procedure adopting a running mode of exercise. Current HTTs may misdiagnose a runner's susceptibility to a hyperthermic state due to differences in exercise intensity. The current study aimed to establish the repeatability of a practical running test to evaluate individual's ability to tolerate exercise heat stress. Sixteen (8M, 8F) participants performed the running HIT (RHTT) (30 min, 9 km h(-1), 2\% elevation) on two separate occasions in a hot environment (40 degrees C and 40\% relative humidity). There were no differences in peak rectal temperature (RHTF1: 38.82 +/- 0.47 degrees C, RHTT2: 38.86 +/- 0.49 degrees C, Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC)=0.93, typical error of measure (TEM)=0.13 degrees C), peak skin temperature (RHTT1: 38.12 +/- 0.45, RHTT2: 38.11 +/- 0.45 degrees C, ICC=0.79, TEM=0.30 degrees C), peak heart rate (RHTT1: 182 +/- 15 beats min(-1), RHIT2: 183 +/- 15 beats min(-1), ICC=0.99, TEM=2 beats min(-1)), nor sweat rate (1721 +/- 675 g h(-1), 1716 +/- 745 g h(-1), ICC=0.95, TEM=162 g h(-1)) between RHTT1 and RHTF2 (p>0.05). Results demonstrate good agreement, strong correlations and small differences between repeated trials, and the TEM values suggest low within-participant variability. The RHTT was effective in differentiating between individuals physiological responses; supporting a heat tolerance continuum. The findings suggest the RHIT is a repeatable measure of physiological strain in the heat and may be used to assess the effectiveness of acute and chronic heat alleviating procedures.

article,"A reduced core to skin temperature gradient, not a critical core temperature, affects aerobic capacity in the heat","Cuddy, John S. and Hailes, Walter S. and Ruby, Brent C.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of the core to skin temperature gradient during incremental running to volitional fatigue across varying environmental conditions. A secondary aim was to determine if a ``critical{''} core temperature would dictate volitional fatigue during running in the heat. 60 participants (n=49 male, n=11 female; 24 +/- 5 yrs, 177 +/- 11 cm, 75 +/- 13 kg) completed the study. Participants were uniformly stratified into a specific exercise temperature group (18 degrees C, 26 degrees C, 34 degrees C, or 42 degrees C) based on a 3-mile run performance. Participants were equipped with core and chest skin temperature sensors and a heart rate monitor, entered an environmental chamber (18 degrees C, 26 degrees C, 34 degrees C, or 42 degrees C), and rested in the seated position for 10 min before performing a walk/run to volitional exhaustion. Initial treadmill speed was 3.2 km h(-1) with a 0\% grade. Every 3 min, starting with speed, speed and grade increased in an alternating pattern (speed increased by 0.805 km h(-1), grade increased by 0.5\%). Time to volitional fatigue was longer for the 18 degrees C and 26 degrees C group compared to the 42 degrees C group, (58.1 +/- 9.3 and 62.6 +/- 6.5 min vs. 51.3 +/- 8.3 min, respectively, p < 0.05). At the half-way point and finish, the core to skin gradient for the 18 degrees C and 26 degrees C groups was larger compared to 42 degrees C group (halfway: 2.6 +/- 0.7 and 2.0 +/- 0.6 vs. 1.3 +/- 0.5 for the 18 degrees C, 26 degrees C and 42 degrees C groups, respectively; finish: 3.3 +/- 0.7 and 3.5 +/- 1.1 vs. 2.1 +/- 0.9 for the 26 degrees C, 34 degrees C, and 42 degrees C groups, respectively, p < 0.05). Sweat rate was lower in the 18 degrees C group compared to the 26 C, 34 degrees C, and 42 degrees C groups, 3.6 +/- 1.3 vs. 7.2 +/- 3.0, 7.1 +/- 2.0, and 7.6 +/- 1.7 g m(-2) min(-1), respectively, p <0.05. There were no group differences in core temperature and heart rate response during the exercise trials. The current data demonstrate a 13\% and 22\% longer run time to exhaustion for the 18 degrees C and 26 degrees C group, respectively, compared to the 42 degrees C group despite no differences in beginning and ending core temperatures or baseline 3-mile run time. This capacity difference appears to result from a magnified core to skin gradient via an environmental temperature advantageous to convective heat loss, and in part from an increased sweat rate.

article,Thermal ecology of two sympatric saxicolous lizards of the genus <i>Phymaturus</i> from the Payunia region (Argentina),"Corbalan, Valeria and Debandi, Guillermo and Kubisch, Erika",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"We evaluated the thermal biology of two sympatric saxicolous species of the genus Phymaturus, endemic from the Argentine Payunia region. Taking into account that the distributional range of Phymaturus roigorum (the largest species) is greater than the range of P. payuniae, we evaluated the habitat (type of rocks) used by these species. We recorded body temperature and operative temperatures in different habitats, and we determined the preferred body temperature in the laboratory. We compared the thermal quality of habitats occupied and not occupied by Phymaturus payuniae, and the accuracy and effectiveness of thermoregulation between species. P. roigorum was found on many different kinds of rocks, but P. payuniae was found mainly on two types or rocks and not found on dark basalts. No differences were found in habitat thermal quality or in preferred temperatures when comparing among populations or between species. Although both species are thermoregulators, P. payuniae demonstrated better accuracy and effectiveness. This is the first study to assess thermal biology in coexisting species of the genus Phymaturus and provides the first data on effectiveness of thermoregulation for the genus. The results obtained have importance from a conservation perspective, since both endemic species are vulnerable and no data on habitat or thermal requirements were available up till now.

article,Larval temperature experience determines sensitivity to cold-shock-induced wing color pattern changes in the blue pansy butterfly <i>Junonia orithya</i>,"Dhungel, Bidur and Otaki, Joji M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The butterfly wing color patterns are unique to a species but are modified in response to cold-shock and tungstate treatments at the pupal stage, producing characteristic temperature shock (TS) phenotypes that are distinct from the color patterns of seasonal polyphenism. In this study, we examined the efficiency of cold-shock and tungstate treatments for color pattern modifications at the pupal stage in relation to larval rearing conditions for the fall or summer morph using the blue pansy butterfly Junonia orithya. We found that larvae reared under the low-temperature condition that induces the fall morph exhibited hardiness against the color pattern changes imposed by cold-shock or tungstate treatment at the pupal stage. When larvae were fed an artificial diet containing tungstate under the high-temperature condition that induces the summer morph, they were still vulnerable to color pattern changes imposed by cold-shock or tungstate treatment at the pupal stage. Furthermore, larvae reared under the high-temperature condition were subjected to cold-shock or tungstate treatments at the pupal stage. In addition to the expected TS-type changes, these individuals exhibited a reduced number of eyespots in adults, which is a feature of the fall morph. These results suggest that the temperature condition experienced by the larvae, but not their consumption of tungstate, determines the sensitivity of the wing imaginal discs to cold-shock and tungstate treatments at the pupal stage.

article,To optimize the efficacy of bioheat transfer in capacitive hyperthermia: A physical perspective,"Jamil, Muhammad and Ng, E. Y. K.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"This paper presents the capacitive hyperthermia from physical perspective focusing on the geometric dimensions as parameters. For this purpose six parameters having three levels each, including two tunable parameters i.e. applied voltage, frequency together with four geometric parameters i.e. size of the tumor, location of the tumor, electrode size and relative position of the electrodes w.r.t tumor were considered for analysis. Taguchi based design of experiments approach was used for the aforementioned six parameters. Using Taguchi's standard 127 orthogonal array, the required results could be obtained employing least number of experiments. For this study temperature was taken as the quality characteristic to be optimized. Furthermore, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to quantify the effect of each parameter on the response variable and results were presented. To deal with the extent of thermal damage to the healthy tissue and tumor, the fraction of tissue experiencing thermal damage was calculated. For this purpose two indices namely treatment index and damage index were formulated. Finally it was concluded that maximum achieved temperature alone does not depict the effectiveness of the treatment. Rather, the combination of the maximum achieved temperature and accompanied thermal damage to the surrounding healthy tissue which should be considered. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Supplemental ascorbic acid does not affect inferred heat loss in broiler chickens exposed to elevated temperature,"McKee, Jeffrey S. and Harrison, Paul C.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The provision of supplemental ascorbic acid has been reported to lower the body temperature of chickens maintained at elevated environmental temperatures. Since body temperature is the net effect of heat production and heat loss, it is not known if the reductions in body temperature were due to a lower heat production or an increase in heat loss. The purpose of this work was to determine if supplemental ascorbic acid facilitates heat loss in chickens exposed to an elevated temperature. On day 12 post-hatch broiler chickens were implanted intra-abdominally with a thermo-sensitive radio transmitter. The following day, birds were placed inside an indirect calorimeter maintained at 34 C for 24 h and provided water containing 0 or 400 ppm ascorbic acid. Oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, heat production, respiratory exchange ratio, and body core temperature were measured for 3 h; beginning 21 h after the birds were placed inside the calorimeter. No differences were observed in heat production or body core temperature between birds provided or not and 400 ppm ascorbic acid. This suggests that ascorbic acid has no effect on heat loss. Birds provided ascorbic acid did exhibit a significantly lower respiratory exchange ratio suggesting a greater utilization of lipid for energy production. Although lipid has a lower heat increment compared with protein and carbohydrate, the significance of this finding to birds exposed to elevated temperature is not known. In conclusion, under the conditions of this study the provision of supplemental ascorbic acid to broiler chickens maintained at an elevated temperature did not affect heat loss as inferred from measured heat production and body core temperature.

article,Actual temperature during and thermal response after whole-body cryotherapy in cryo-cabin,"Savic, Miroslav and Fonda, Borut and Sarabon, Nejc",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Whole-body cryotherapy (WBC) involves exposing minimally dressed participants to very cold air (injecting liquid nitrogen with temperature -195 degrees C), either in a specially designed chamber (cryo-chamber) or cabin (cryo-cabin), for a short period of time. The aim of this study was to examine the actual temperature of the air in the cryo-cabin at different locations throughout the cabin by using human subjects and a manikin. Additionally, we monitored skin temperature before and for 60 min after the cryo-cabin session. Twelve subjects completed one 3 min cryo-cabin session. Temperature next to the skin was assessed during the session, while the skin temperature was monitored before, 3 min after and every 10 min for 60 min after completing the session. There was a statistically significant interaction (time x position) for temperature among the different body parts during the WBC, and for skin temperature among different body parts after the cryo-cabin session. Statistically significant time effects during and following cryo-cabin session were present for all body parts. We showed that actual temperature in the cryo-cabin is substantially different from the one reported by the manufacturer. Thermal response after cryo-cabin session is similar to response observed after cryo-chamber cold exposure reported in previously published studies. This could be of great practical value as cryo-cabins are less expensive and easier to use compared to cryo-chambers. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we investigated whether the introduced geckos in the subtropical/temperate region of southeastern Australia have shifted their thermal biology to cope with colder temperatures. In the lab, we measured the body temperatures of geckos from Thailand and Australia in a cost-free thermal gradient. Native H. frenatus from Thailand displayed a diel pattern of thermoregulation. Geckos maintained higher body temperatures during mid-afternoon and at dusk but selected cooler temperatures during the night. Introduced geckos showed a similar pattern of thermoregulation, but selected lower body temperatures in summer (mean = 28.9 degrees C) and winter (mean = 25.5 degrees C) than native geckos (mean = 31.5 degrees C). While the Asian house geckos from Thailand did not alter their body temperatures after feeding, their conspecifics from southeastern Australia selected body temperatures that were 1.6-3.1 degrees C higher after feeding. In conclusion, our study shows that invasive house geckos in Australia have shifted their preferred body temperatures downwards relative to their native conspecifics in Thailand, presumably as a result of plasticity or natural selection. Our findings suggest that these tropical geckos have adapted to colder regions, and thus, they may spread much further than expected for a tropical ectotherm.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102625,91,NA,NA,102625,Thermal preference; Thermoregulation; Adaptation; Invasive species; Ectotherm
article,Critical THI thresholds based on the physiological parameters of lactating dairy cows,"Pinto, Severino and Hoffmann, Gundula and Ammon, Christian and Amon, Thomas",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The severity of heat stress conditions in high-yielding dairy cows is currently underestimated. The present study aimed to determine the heat load threshold of the temperature-humidity index (THI) on physiological parameters of lactating Holstein-Friesian cows under a continental climatic zone in Germany. Physiological parameter measurements, such as respiration rate (RR), measured hourly, and heart rate (HR) and rectal temperature (RT), both measured twice daily, were performed in a total of 139 multiparous cows on three randomly chosen measurement days per week. In addition, the ambient temperature and relative humidity of the barn were recorded every 5 min to calculate the current THI. The physiological parameter data were linked to the THI, and the heat load thresholds were determined using the broken-stick model. The heat load duration effect of each physiological parameter was obtained by regression analysis. Considering the increases in the physiological parameters, our study provided reliable data to determine heat load thresholds for lactating high-yielding dairy cows in a moderate climatic zone. The heat load threshold could be determined for RR in standing cows (THI = 70) and lying cows (THI = 65) and for HR (THI = 72) and RT (THI = 70) in standing cows. The heat load duration also demonstrated a significant effect on the increases in physiological parameters among dairy cows. In particular, the present study enabled a strategy to be devised to initiate heat mitigation in high-yielding dairy cows when they are exposed to THIs above 65.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102523,88,NA,NA,102523,Respiration rate; Heart rate; Rectal temperature; Temperature-humidity index; Heat load

To investigate the potential roles of HSPs in the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana (L.), an important native pest of forests in North America, we found eight ATP-dependent HSP transcripts (CfHSPs). Based on molecular characteristics, the identified HSP genes were classified into HSP70 and HSP90 families, and phylogenetic results showed that they had orthologues in other insects. The transcript levels of these HSPs were measured using RT-qPCR under normal and stressful conditions in the laboratory. Under normal conditions, three HSP genes were consistently expressed in all life stages, whereas expression of the other five genes was dependent on the developmental stage. In the larvae, most CfHSP transcripts displayed similar expression levels among different tissues. Under heat shock conditions, one HSP70 gene and one HSP90 gene were upregulated in all life stages. One HSP70 gene was upregulated after cold injury in the larval stage. With starvation, HSP gene expression exhibited complex expression patterns; most of them were downregulated. These results suggest that the ATP-dependent HSPs have multiple roles during normal development as well as under stressful conditions including heat, cold injury and starvation.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102493,88,NA,NA,102493,Spruce budworm; HSP70; HSP90; Heat shock protein; Stress response

The lung tissue is cooled by a cryoprobe by imposing its surface at a constant temperature or a constant heat flux or a constant heat transfer coefficient. The freezing starts and the domain is distributed into three stages namely: unfrozen, mushy and frozen regions. In stage I where the only unfrozen region is formed, our problem is an initial-boundary value problem of the hyperbolic partial differential equation. In stage II where mushy and unfrozen regions are formed, our problem is a moving boundary value problem of parabolic partial differential equations and in stage III where frozen, mushy, and unfrozen regions are formed, our problem is a moving boundary value problem of parabolic partial differential equations. The solution consists of the three-step procedure: (i) transformation of problem in non-dimensional form, (ii) by using finite differences, the problem converted into ordinary matrix differential equation and moving boundary problem of ordinary matrix differential equations, (iii) applying Legendre wavelet Galerkin method the problem is transferred into the generalized system of Sylvester equations which are solved by applying Bartels-Stewart algorithm of generalized inverse.

article,Rating of perceived exertion increases synergistically during prolonged exercise in a combined heat and hypoxic environment,"Levine, Ashley and Buono, Michael J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The purpose of this study was to determine the cardiovascular, thermoregulatory, and perceived exertion responses during 2 h of moderate intensity exercise in a combined high heat (38 degrees C, 40\% relative humidity) and hypoxic (15\% O-2) environment. Ten healthy volunteers completed 2 h of treadmill walking at 40\% of maximal oxygen uptake in four different conditions, each separated by approximately 1 week: (1) control, 23 degrees C/20.9\% O-2, (2) heat, 38 degrees C/20.9\% O-2, (3) hypoxia, 23 degrees C/15\% O-2, and (4) combined heat/hypoxia, 38 degrees C/15\% O-2. Compared to the responses seen in each condition alone, heart rate (HR) and core temperature (T-core) showed an additive increase in the combined heat and hypoxic environment after 2 h of moderate intensity exercise. The most important new finding was that the mean rating of perceived exertion (RPE) increased synergistically 3.3 units when exercising in the combined high heat and hypoxic environment, compared to 1.9 units in the heat condition alone. The results suggest that RPE is a conscious perception of effort that plays a regulatory function to ensure that the work rate remains at an intensity that can be safely sustained, rather than simply a marker of exercise intensity.

The main aim of this work was to explore whether intermittent wetting clothing can be served as an ecologically valid cooling strategy to mitigate heat stress on inactive vulnerable populations not having access to air-conditioning during a severe heatwave. Ten young male subjects underwent two 90-min separate trials: a dry clothing trial (i.e., CON) and a wetted clothing cooling trial (i.e., WEC). A set of light summer wear was chosen and intermittently wetted by tap water at intervals of every 30 min. Physiological and perceptual responses of subjects were examined and compared. All trials were performed in a chamber with an air temperature of 43 +/- 0.5 degrees C, RH = 57 +/- 5\% and an air velocity of 0.15 +/- 0.05 m/s (WBGT=37.35 degrees C). Results demonstrated that WEC, compared with CON, could significantly reduce both the mean skin temperature and the core temperature throughout the 5-90th min and 25-90th min of the trial, respectively (p < 0.05). Besides, WEC could also remarkable reduce local skin temperatures at those body sites covered by wet clothing (p < 0.05). In comparison, no significant difference was found between WEC and CON on perceptual responses. Further, it was also found from PHS simulations that conditions with a partial water vapour pressure <= 3.1-3.5 kPa would not induce pronounced core temperature rises at 43 degrees C. Finally, it may be concluded that intermittent wetting clothing could be served as an ecologically valid cooling strategy to reduce thermo-physiological strain of vulnerable populations while seating during humid heatwaves and thereby improve their health and safety.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.11.012,79,NA,33-41,NA,Heatwave; Vulnerable population; Cooling strategy; Evaporative cooling; Thermoregulatory responses; Heat strain

Ejaculates from 109 Murrah bulls maintained at three semen stations were evaluated for: ejaculate volume, sperm concentration (SCON), initial motility (IM), percent live sperm (LIVE), acrosome integrity of fresh semen (AIFS), plasma membrane integrity of fresh semen (PMIFS), head abnormalities of fresh semen (HAFS), midpiece abnormalities of fresh semen (MPAFS), tail abnormalities of fresh semen (TAFS), post-thaw motility (PTM), acrosome integrity of post-thawed semen (AIPT) and plasma membrane integrity of post-thawed semen (PMIPT). Scrotal and ocular surface temperatures were acquired during rainy, winter and summer seasons, using an FLIR i5 infrared camera. Thermographic images were analyzed with Quick Report 1.2 SP2 software and temperature data acquired. Daily mean temperature and mean relative humidity were used to determine the temperature-humidity index (THI). Environmental factors were analyzed using CORR to determine collinearity among independent variables. There was a high correlation among THI, proximal, mid and distal scrotal temperatures (r >= 0.73). Therefore, distal pole temperature (DPT), THI, temperature gradient (TG) and ocular temperature (OcT) were used in the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and in regression analysis of dependent variables. The THI, DPT, TG and OcT had significant influences on sperm abnormalities, acrosome and plasma membrane integrity of fresh as well as post-thawed semen. The TG had significant effects on LIVE and SCON. All semen quality parameters were predicted (regression analysis) as a function of the three independent factors. We concluded that scrotal infrared thermography was useful for assessing influences of thermal stress and environmental factors on characteristics of buffalo semen.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.09.003,78,NA,51-57,NA,Infrared thermography; Murrah bulls; Temperature-humidity index; Semen quality

(1758)","Samaras, Athanasios and Papandroulakis, Nikos and Lika, Konstadia and Pavlidis, Michail",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The effects of water temperature (15, 20 and 25 degrees C) on the stress response of European sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax, were studied. Blood and water samples were collected prior and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 h post-stress for hormonal and biochemical analysis. Water temperature affected the resting concentrations of all stress indicators examined, as well as their response after stress, apart from lactate which response was unaffected by temperature. Cortisol showed the response with the highest outcome at 15 degrees C, and the fastest at 25 degrees C. Cortisol release rate in the water was also faster and of higher magnitude at higher temperatures. Glucose had both the fastest and higher in magnitude response at 25 degrees C, while lactate responded similarly in all temperatures tested. Finally, osmolality changed only at the highest temperature. These results suggest that temperature should be taken into consideration when evaluating the resting levels of stress indicators of European sea bass in laboratory, rearing and field conditions. Additionally, the present results show that temperature affects the stress response, suggesting that fish can differ in their susceptibility to stress depending on the acclimatization temperature. Moreover, it was shown that cortisol release rate in the water, a non-invasive stress indicator, can depict the effects of temperature on cortisol stress response.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.09.006,78,NA,84-91,NA,Cortisol; Cortisol release rate; European sea bass; Glucose; Temperature

The purpose was to compare fluid intake during heat acclimation by promoting dehydration (DEH = 0.5 mL kg(-1) 15 min(-1), similar to 2.4\% dehydration per acclimation session) compared to euhydration (EUH = 2.0 mL kg(-1) 15 min(-1), similar to 1.4\% dehydration per acclimation session) following four heat acclimation bouts on thermal strain, and exercise performance. Thirteen males completed 90 min heat stress tests (HST) at 50\% VO2max (40 degrees C, 30\%RH) before and after three 90 min heat acclimation trials, involving consecutive bouts with 4-fold less fluid (DEH) or EUH. DEH and EUH trials were separated by 48 h and assigned in a random crossover design separated by a 5 week washout. Wildland firefighter (WLFF) Nomex: shirt, pants, and a cotton T-shirt baselayer were worn. Peak core temperature (T-c) from the HST significantly decreased following both DEH (39.5 +/- 0.1-39.0 +/- 0.1 degrees C: P < 0.001) and EUH acclimation (39.5 +/- 0.1-38.9 +/- 0.1 degrees C: P < 0.001). HR, RPE, physiological strain index (PSI), and total work (J) completed in a graded exercise test to exhaustion were improved (P < 0.001) in effect for acclimation, but not different when comparing DEH or EUH fluid delivery. SBF was unchanged (P = 0.313). Sweat rate increased greater following DEH (1.52 +/- 0.06-1.89 +/- 0.09 L h(-1)) compared to EUH acclimation (1.57 +/- 0.06-1.79 +/- 0.08 L h(-1): P = 0.015).

A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of dietary acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) supplementation on performance, carcasses and some blood metabolites of growing quails exposed to heat stress. Three hundred sixty mix sexed Japanese quail chicks at 2 wk of age with average initial body weight of 77.4 g were randomly allotted to six dietary groups in a 3 x 2 factorial design with three dietary ASA doses (0, 0.5 and 1 g ASA/kg diet) and two ambient temperatures (one normal at 23 +/- 2 degrees C and other high at 33 +/- 2 degrees C). Body weight, daily body weight gain and feed consumption reduced in quails exposed to heat stress (33 degrees C) during 2-4 wk of age, but not during 4-6 wk of age and during total period (2-6 wk of age). Growth rate and feed utilization were not influenced by ASA supplementation or interaction between ASA supplementation and house temperature at all ages (P > 0.05). All carcass parameters were not affected (P > 0.05) by temperature or dietary ASA or their interactions except dressing percent was decreased (P = 0.025) by ASA. Plasma cholesterol and total lipid were affected by the interaction effect, which were elevated in birds exposed to high ambient temperature (P = 0.004 or 0.022) and ASA supplementation (P = 0.041 or P = 0.003). Glucose concentrations were also influenced by interaction effect, which increased due to ASA supplementation at normal temperature, but were not affected at high temperature. The effect of high ambient temperature or its interaction with ASA did not affect hepatic enzymes and thyroid hormones of growing quails. Diets supplemented with ASA (1000 mg/kg) decreased plasma contents of aspartate transaminase, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxin (T4) compared with the control. It is concluded that applications of ASA in quail diets are not suitable in mitigating the disturbances induced by heat stress in the most studied parameters.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.02.011,74,NA,6-13,NA,Acetylsalicylic acid; Carcass trait; Heat stress; Hematology; Performance; Quail
article,A new local thermal bioheat model for predicting the temperature of skin thermoreceptors of individual body tissues,"Khiavi, Negin Moallemi and Maerefat, Mehdi and Zolfaghari, Seyed Alireza",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Under non-uniform environments, the human body thermal perception depends on the thermal responses of cutaneous thermoreceptors (TRs) in different body parts. However, skin TRs thermal response includes static and dynamic parts depending on TRs temperature and its change rate, respectively. Thus, it is necessary to evaluate the time-dependent temperatures of cutaneous TRs in different body parts. The Pennes equation is one of the most important bioheat equations for computing the temperature of biological bodies, but, it has been used for evaluating the mean temperature of the whole body, considering average properties for all body parts. In the present study, the Pennes equation was solved for 16 body parts by considering appropriate thermal/physiological properties for each segment. In addition, a controlling system was added to the Pennes equation by applying the thermoregulatory mechanisms of 65-node Tanabe (65MN) model. The time-dependent skin temperatures of the 16 body segments were obtained by solving the localized thermoregulatory bioheat equation. The validation of the present model was carried out using published experimental data and a good agreement was found.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.04.006,74,NA,290-302,NA,Local bioheat model; Local temperature of cutaneous thermoreceptors; Non-uniform environment
article,Heat shock response and shape regulation during newt tail regeneration,"Radugina, Elena and Grigoryan, Eleonora",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Regenerating newt tail has recently been found to react to hypergravity in a stable and reproducible way by curving downwards. Such morphogenetic effect of non-specific physical factor applied to a complex structure of an adult animal is a rare phenomenon with unknown molecular basis. For the first steps of unraveling this basis we've chosen heat shock proteins (HSPs) as promising candidates. Morphometrical analysis of tail regeneration was performed in aquarium (control), on substrate (relative hypergravity) and in aquarium under weekly application of heat shock. HSPs were inhibited pharmacologically during regeneration in aquarium and on substrate. Hsp70, 90 gene expression and protein localization were analyzed in the studied conditions. Weekly application of heat shock to newts regenerating tails in otherwise normal conditions led to development of curved tails (both upwards and downwards), suggesting that similar mechanisms are at play in both hyper gravity-altered and heat shock-altered morphogenesis. Heat shock protein inhibitor KNK437 didn't affect tail shape during normal regeneration, but prevented the formation of tail curve in appropriate conditions. It was shown that HSP70 and HSP90 proteins are present in muscle and connective tissue of intact tails as well as regenerates, but only appear in epidermis in hypergravity-altered regenerates and heated tails. Based on our data, we hypothesize, that different external factors (e.g. hypergravity and heat shock) are received, analyzed and transmitted further to affect morphogenesis by similar mechanisms that utilize a set of HSP in epidermal cells.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.11.009,71,NA,171-179,NA,Regeneration; Morphogenesis; HSP; Heat shock; KNK437

At each temperature, three tanks were modified to generate exercise activity in the specimens and force the fish to swim under a current speed of 27.5 cm s(-1). At the end of the experiment, the following metrics were evaluated: fish performance, morphometry (length, width, height and perimeter in different body positions), and the diameter and density of muscle and subcutaneous ventral adipose tissues. At 28 degrees C, pacus were both heavier and had greater weight gain after 240 days of cultivation. Additionally, exercise improved the feed conversion. An increase of 4 degrees C (30 degrees C) did not provide any improvement in the performance of the fish. However, swimming exercise improved the performance of pacus, providing increases of 38\% and a 15\% improvement in feed conversion.

First, embryos were subject to one of three different TS temperatures (6, 9, or 12 degrees C above control) at 4 points in development (21, 38, 60 and 70 days post-fertilisation (dpf)) for 2 h followed by a 2 h recovery to understand the ontogeny of the HSR. A second experiment explored the effects of repeated TS on the HSR in embryos from 15 to 75 dpf. Embryos were subjected to one of two TS regimes; +6 degrees C TS for 1 h every 6 days or +9 degrees C TS for 1 h every 6 days. Following a 2 h recovery, a subset of embryos was sampled. Our results show that embryos could initiate a HSR via upregulation of heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) mRNA at all developmental ages studied, but that this response varied with age and was only observed with a TS of +9 or + 12 degrees C. In comparison, when embryos received multiple TS treatments, hsp70 was not induced in response to the 1 h TS and 2 h recovery, and a downregulation was observed at 39 dpf. Downregulation of hsp47 and hsp90a mRNA was also observed in early age embryos. Collectively, these data suggest that embryos are capable of initiating a HSR at early age and throughout embryogenesis, but that repeated TS can alter the HSR, and may result in either reduced responsiveness or a downregulation of inducible hsps.

article,Effects of increasing temperature on antioxidant defense system and oxidative stress parameters in the Antarctic fish Notothenia coriiceps and Notothenia rossii,"Klein, Roberta Daniele and Borges, Vinicius Dias and Rosa, Carlos Eduardo and Colares, Elton Pinto and Robaldo, Ricardo Berteaux and Martinez, Pablo Elias and Bianchini, Adalto",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Antioxidant defense system (ADS) and oxidative stress parameters were evaluated in the Antarctic fish Notothenia rossii and N. coriiceps exposed to increasing temperature. Acclimated fish were kept at 0 degrees C or exposed to 4 degrees C for 1 day (N. rossii) or to 2 and 4 degrees C for 1 and 6 days (N. coriiceps). Measurements were assessed in brain, gills, liver, white muscle and erythrocytes. Parameters analyzed included antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP); reduced glutathione (GSH) and metallothionein-like proteins (MTLP) concentration; superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-Stransferase (GST) and glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL) activity; lipid peroxidation (LPO) level and protein carbonyl (PC) concentration. Increased liver GST activity was observed in N. rossii exposed to 4 degrees C for 1 day. Increased muscle GPx activity was observed in N. coriiceps after exposure to 2 degrees C for 1 day. Reduced gill GPx activity and increased liver SOD activity were observed after exposure to 4 degrees C for 1 day. In N. coriiceps, increased gill GCL activity and reduced gill GPx activity, as Well as reduced liver MTLP were observed after exposure to 2 degrees C for 6 days. Reduced brain SOD activity and increased brain LPO; reduced gill ACAP, GSH concentration and GPx activity, as well as increased gill GCL activity; reduced liver ACAP, MTLP, SOD activity, GST activity and increased liver and erythrocytes LPO were observed after exposure to 4 degrees C for 6 days. These findings indicate that ADS is more responsive to short-term increasing temperature in the sluggish N. coriiceps than in the active N. rossii. However, responses of N. coriiceps to long-term increasing temperature were transient and did not prevent tissue oxidative damage. Considering the predicted increase in temperature in the Southern Ocean over the next decades, our findings suggest that Antarctic fishes are sensitive to ocean warming, displaying tissue oxidative damage associated with the thermal stress.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.02.016,68,A,110-118,NA,Antarctica; Antioxidant defense system; Fish; Oxidative stress; Temperature

E. and Garcia, Emerson Silami and Bouzas Marins, Joao Carlos",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Research into obtaining a fast, valid, reliable and non-invasive measure of core temperature is of interest in many disciplinary fields. Occupational and sports medicine research has attempted to determine a non-invasive proxy for core temperature particularly when access to participants is limited and thermal safety is of a concern due to protective encapsulating clothing, hot ambient environments and/or high endogenous heat production during athletic competition. This investigation aimed to determine the validity of inner canthus of the eye temperature (T-EC) as an alternate non-invasive measure of intestinal core temperature (T-C) during rest, exercise and post-exercise conditions. Twelve physically active males rested for 30 min prior to exercise, performed 60 min of aerobic exercise at 60\% (V) over dotO(2max) and passively recovered a further 60 min post-exercise. T-EC and T-C were measured at 5 min intervals during each condition. Mean differences between T-EC and T-C were 0.61 degrees C during pre-exercise, -1.78 degrees C during exercise and -1.00 degrees C during post-exercise. The reliability between the methods was low in the pre-exercise (ICC=0.49 {[}-0.09 to 0.82]), exercise (ICC=-0.14 {[}-0.65 to 0.44]) and post-exercise (ICC=-0.25 {[}-0.70 to 0.35]) conditions. In conclusion, poor agreement was observed between the T-EC values measured through IRT and T-C measured through a gastrointestinal telemetry pill.

In this study, we assessed the, mate choice, reproductive success, and offspring colouration of typical (T) and melanic (M) morphs of the ladybird Menochilus sexmaculatus paired at three temperatures 15 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 35 degrees C. Mating success of the two morphs and the consequences for offspring fitness and offspring phenotype under these temperature regimes were evaluated. Melanic adults of both sexes achieved significantly higher mating success at 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C, but at 35 degrees C no influence of adult morph on mate selection was observed. Melanic females were more fecund than typical females at all temperatures. Offspring of melanic parents developed faster than those of typicals at 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C, but not at 35 degrees C. Evidence was also found of phenotypic plasticity in colour form at 15 degrees C and 35 degrees C. At 25 degrees C the parents of pure (T) and (M) morphs produced offspring of the same morph. However, low temperature induced partial melanisation among the offspring of typical parents (T). Whereas at 35 degrees C the offspring of (T) parents became paler in colour with very fine zigzag lines on elytra, i.e. they decrease the degree of melanisation. Pure melanics (M) compensated for elevated temperature stress by producing offspring that were either pure melanic but small or large with reduced melanisation. Our results on offspring phenotype variation indicate that the degree of melanism in morphs is a result of environmentally regulated expression of the parental genotype. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Ice slurry ingestion reduces both core and facial skin temperatures in a warm environment,"Onitsuka, Sumire and Zheng, Xinyan and Hasegawa, Hiroshi",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Internal body cooling by ingesting ice slurry has recently attracted attention. Because ice slurries are ingested through the mouth, it is possible that this results in conductive cooling of the facial skin and brain. However, no studies have investigated this possibility. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ice slurry ingestion on forehead skin temperature at the point of conductive cooling between the forehead skin and brain. Eight male subjects ingested either 7.5 g/kg of ice slurry (-1 degrees C; ICE), a cold sports drink (4 degrees C; COOL), or a warm sports drink (37 degrees C; CON) for 15 min in a warm environment (30 degrees C, 80\% relative humidity). Then, they remained at rest for 1 h. As physiological indices, rectal temperature (T-re), mean skin temperature, forehead skin temperature (T-head), heart rate, nude body mass, and urine specific gravity were measured. Subjective thermal sensation (TS) was measured at 5-min intervals throughout the experiment. With ICE, T-re and T-head were significantly reduced compared with CON and COOL conditions (p < 0.05). The results of the other physiological indices were not significantly different. TS with ICE was significantly lower than that with CON and COOL (p < 0.05) and was correlated with T-re or T-head (p < 0.05). These results indicate that ice slurry ingestion may induce conductive cooling between forehead skin and brain, and reduction in core and forehead skin temperature reduced thermal sensation.

article,Stage- and sex-specific heat tolerance in the yellow dung fly <i>Scathophaga stercoraria</i>,"Blanckenhorn, Wolf U. and Gautier, Roland and Nick, Marcel and Puniamoorthy, Nalini and Schaefer, Martin A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Thermal tolerance varies at all hierarchical levels of biological organization: among species, populations, individuals, and even within individuals. Age- or developmental stage-and sex-specific thermal effects have received relatively little attention in the literature, despite being crucial for understanding thermal adaptation in nature and responses to global warming. We document stage- and sex-specific heat tolerance in the yellow dung fly Scathophaga stercoraria (Diptera: Scathophagidae), a species common throughout the northern hemisphere that generally favours cool climates. Exposure of eggs to temperatures up to 32 degrees C did not affect larval hatching rate, but subsequent egg-to-adult survival at a benign temperature was reduced. Permanent transfer from benign (18 degrees C) to hot temperatures (up to 31 degrees C) at different larval and pupal stages strongly decreased egg-to-adult survival, though survival continuously improved the later the transfer occurred. Temporary transfer for only two days increased mortality more weakly, survival being lowest when temperature stress was imposed early during the larval or pupal stages. Adult flies provided with sugar and water tolerated 31 degrees C longer than previously thought (5 days in males to 9 days in females). Eggs were thus less susceptible to thermal stress than larvae, pupae or adults, in agreement with the hypothesis that more mobile stages require less physiological protection against heat because they can behaviourally thermoregulate. The probability of mating, of laying a clutch, and hatching success were generally independently reduced by exposure of females or males to warm temperatures (24 degrees C) during the juvenile or adult stages, with some interactions evident. High temperature stress thus affects survival differentially depending on when it occurs during the juvenile or the pre-reproductive adult life stage, and affects reproductive success via the mating behaviour of both sexes, female physiology in terms of oviposition, and fertility via sperm and/or egg quality. Our results illustrate that temperature stress, even when moderate and temporary, during early development can have profound lethal and non-lethal fitness-consequences later in life.

article,Monitoring changes in skin temperature associated with exercise in horses on a water treadmill by use of infrared thermography,"Yarnell, Kelly and Fleming, Jennifer and Stratton, Tim D. and Brassington, Rebecca",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Infrared thermography (IRT) was used to assess surface temperature change as an indirect measure of muscle activity and exercise associated changes in blood flow in the working hind limb muscles of horses (n=7) undergoing water treadmill exercise. Three treatments were investigated including the treadmill ran dry (TD), water at the height of the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) and water at the height of the carpus (CP). Maximum skin surface temperature was recorded from the region of the semitendinosus muscle during exercise at each water height. There was a significant difference in surface hind limb temperature between exercise on the water treadmill ran dry and with water at the height of the PIP and CP (P < 0.0001) with hotter temperatures recorded during the TD treatment. There was a greater increase in surface temperature of the hind limbs from pre exercise to maximum temperature during the PIP and CP treatments when compared to the TD treatment, however, this was not significant (P=0.58). There was no significant difference in surface hind limb temperature found between exercise in water at the height of the PIP and water at the height of the CP. The findings from this study suggest that IRT is able to non-invasively detect muscle activity and associated changes in blood flow whilst horses are exercised on a water treadmill. IRT could potentially be used as an alternative method to assess muscle activity and temperature change in an aquatic environment where existing methods present methodological challenges.

article,"Thermal responses to feeding in a secretive and specialized predator (Gila monster, <i>Heloderma suspectum</i>)","Gienger, C. M. and Tracy, C. Richard and Zimmerman, Linda C.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"We investigate how a unique dietary specialist, the Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum), uses behavioral thermoregulation to elevate body temperature (T-b) after feeding. Lizards in a laboratory thermal gradient were fed rodent meals of three different sizes (5, 10, or 20\% of body mass), or sham fed (meal of 0\% body mass), and T(b)s were recorded for three days before feeding and seven days after feeding. Gila monsters selected a mean T-b of 25.2 degrees C while fasting (set-point range 23.6-27.1), and increased T(b)s after feeding. The magnitude and duration of post-prandial T-b increases are positively related to meal size, and Gila monsters selected mean T(b)s up to 3.0 degrees C higher and maintain elevated T(b)s for 3-6 days after feeding. Selection of T-b does not appear to differ between day and night time periods, and because the lizards are both diurnal and nocturnal (at different times of year), photoperiod may not be an important influence on T-b selection.

article,"Thermal relations of dwarf caiman, <i>Paleosuchus palpebrosus</i>, in a hillside stream: Evidence for an unusual thermal niche among crocodilians","Campos, Zilca and Magnusson, William E.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Body temperatures of 13 Paleosuchus palpebrosus, 7 males and 6 females, were monitored by radiotelemetry during cold periods (dry season) and warm periods (wet and dry seasons) in a stream draining into the Brazilian Pantanal. The mass of the caimans varied from 2.5 to 20.0 kg, and snout-vent length from 47.5 to 95.0 cm. Mean monthly body temperature was 21.6 degrees C, and varied from 20.1 to 25.6 degrees C throughout the year. Body temperature was correlated with air and water temperature but did not differ between males and females. Unlike all other crocodilians investigated in detail to date, the caimans did not show evidence of attempts to obtain higher body temperatures when ambient temperatures were low, and had low and generally constant temperatures in relation to the surrounding air and water throughout the year. The caimans remained in burrows during cold periods in the dry season, which may explain why they did not seek higher temperatures. Tolerance of relatively low and constant body temperatures may be a key adaptation of species of Paleosuchus, allowing them to occupy environments inhospitable to other crocodilians.

article,Thermoregulation of nutrient-restricted hair ewes subjected to heat stress during late pregnancy,"Macias-Cruz, U. and Alvarez-Valenzuela, F. D. and Correa-Calderon, A. and Diaz-Molina, R. and Mellado, M. and Meza-Herrera, C. and Avendano-Reyes, L.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In summers with severe hot environmental temperatures, thermoregulation is expected to be critical during the last third of gestation of hair ewes, and this effect can be overstated by suboptimal feeding conditions. Twenty-four multiparous hair sheep ewes with approximately 100 d of pregnancy were randomly assigned to two treatments to evaluate the effects of nutritional restriction (NR) during late gestation on some serum metabolites, physiological variables, and thyroid hormone concentrations under intense heat load (maximum temperature 42-45 degrees C). Treatments were as follows: (1) control, ewes fed free choice wheat straw plus a concentrate at a rate of 500 g/d, and (2) nutritionally-restricted (NR) ewes, which were offered wheat straw only ad libitum. Body weight of NR ewes dropped 5.1 kg (P<0.05), while control ewes gained 4.7 kg during the study period. Rectal temperature was not affected (P>0.05) by feeding regime either in the morning or afternoon hours. Respiration rate was greater (P<0.05) in control ewes (20 and 40 breaths/min higher in the day and night, respectively) on d 130 and 145 of pregnancy compared to NR ewes. Skin temperatures during the morning and afternoon were affected (P<0.05) by feeding regime at d 130 and 145 of pregnancy. In the morning, NR ewes presented greater (P<0.05) head and rump temperature at day 145 of gestation, and lower (P<0.05) udder temperatures at d 130 and 145 than control ewes. In the afternoon, skin temperatures of NR ewes were higher (P<0.05) in head and right flank on d 130 and 145 of pregnancy, and in udder at day 145 compared to control ewes. Serum glucose was higher (P<0.05) in NR ewes than control animals at day 145 of pregnancy. Serum cholesterol, triglyceride and thyroid hormones were not affected by nutritional restriction. Overall, it was found that nutritionally restricted ewes were less affected by intense heat loads than well-fed ewes, apparently due to the lower metabolic heat produced by this underfed animals. Also, it was apparent that the lower respiration rate of NR ewes was compensated by a greater body surface temperature. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Twenty-nine male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: rest at 24 degrees C and exercise at 13 degrees C, 24 degrees C or 31 degrees C. The exercise consisted of a 90-min treadmill run at 15 m/min, and different ambient temperatures were used to produce distinct levels of exercise-induced hyperthermia. Before the experimental trials, the rats were treated by gavage with diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid labeled with technetium-99 metastable as a radioactive probe. The rats' core body temperature (T-CORE) was measured by telemetry. Immediately after the trials, the rats were euthanized, and the intestinal permeability was assessed by measuring the radioactivity of blood samples. The mRNA levels of occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) genes were determined in duodenum samples. Exercise at 24 degrees C increased T-CORE to values close to 39 degrees C, without changing permeability compared with the resting trial at the same environment. Meanwhile, rats' T-CORE exceeded 40 degrees C during exercise at 31 degrees C, leading to greater permeability relative to those observed after exercise in the other ambient temperatures (e.g., 0.0037\%/g at 31 degrees C vs. 0.0005\%/g at 13 degrees C; data expressed as medians; p < 0.05). Likewise, the rats exercised at 31 degrees C exhibited higher mRNA levels of ZO-1 and occludin genes than the rats exercised at 24 degrees C or 13 degrees C. The changes in permeability and gene expression were positively and significantly associated with the magnitude of hyperthermia. We conclude that marked hyperthermia caused by exercise in the warmer environment increases intestinal permeability and mRNA levels of tight junction genes.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102610,91,NA,NA,102610,Cold; Heat; Temperature; Thermoregulation; Tight junction proteins; Treadmill running

H. and Jayaweera, H. and Wijesinghe, M. R.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Inter-population disparities in a species have been shown to occur as an adaptation to different thermal regimes in the environment. We investigated the thermal sensitivities of the tropical toad Duttaphrynus melanostictus (Asia Common Toad) from two populations at different altitudes: Nuwara-Eliya - 1870 m, and Polonnaruwa - 25 m, above mean sea level. The two locations were separated by what may be considered a short direct distance - 110 km. Thermal sensitivity trials were conducted at six temperatures between 12 and 39 degrees C. Assessments were made using the performance indicators jump distance, jump force, contact time on the test plate following stimulus to jump, and righting time after being overturned. Optimum performance is taken to be the greatest jump distance and jump force, the least contact time on the test plate, and the least righting time. The populations at the two altitudes had markedly different thermal sensitivities - toads in the cool area (Nuwara-Eliya) performed at an optimal level under low temperatures, whereas the toads in the warm area (Polonnaruwa) performed optimally under high temperatures. The finding that the thermal optima (i.e., the temperatures at which the optimal performance for the four performance indicators was recorded) of the toads in Polonnaruwa were below the mean maximum ambient temperature at this location suggests that these toads would be more susceptible to global warming than those in Nuwara-Eliya whose thermal optima were above the mean maximum ambient temperature in that location. This was consistent with the narrower thermal safety margin (i.e., difference between the mean optimum temperature and mean ambient temperature) of toads in Polonnaruwa, compared to those in Nuwara-Eliya. Importantly, these findings demonstrate that, although thermal sensitivity is considered a conservative trait, differentiation does occur even over a small spatial scale presumably because it offers an adaptive advantage to the population concerned.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102568,89,NA,NA,102568,Thermal sensitivity; Thermal safety margin; Climate change; Tropical toad

article,Daily rumination time of lactating dairy cows under heat stress conditions,"Mueschner-Siemens, Theresa and Hoffmann, Gundula and Ammon, Christian and Amon, Thomas",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The dairy industry in regions with moderate climates, such as Central Europe, will be increasingly challenged in the future by climate change. The problem of heat stress will especially affect dairy husbandry in naturally ventilated barns (NVB). The approach of the study was to determine a heat stress threshold of the average daily temperature-humidity index (THI) that results in changes in the daily rumination time (RT) of lactating, high-yielding cows. The data set was composed of a high sample size of 183 cows and long-duration measurements of 21240 daily observations over two years from June 2015 to May 2017, which were collected in an NVB in Groli Kreutz, Germany. The THI was calculated in 5-min intervals by data from several sensors in different positions inside the barn. Additionally, every cow from the herd of an average of 53 cows in the experimental procedure was wearing a neck collar with a Lely Qwes HR system that provided the RT 24 h a day (12 2-h recordings were summarized). The study showed that heat stress also negatively influenced RT in moderate climates. The heat stress threshold of 52 THI was determined by broken-stick regression and indicated changes of RT of lactating dairy cows in Germany. During the experimental period, the heat stress threshold for RT was reached from April to September for up to 720 h per month. The changes in RT to the heat stress threshold will be affected by cows' characteristics. Therefore, we considered several cow-related factors, such as milk yield (MY), lactation number (LN), lactation stage (days in milk, or DIM) and pregnancy stage (P) to better understand cows' individual reactions to heat stress. Multiparous, high-yielding cows in later lactation stages are potentially more strongly affected than other cows.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102484,88,NA,NA,102484,Heat stress; Rumination time; Temperature-humidity index; Cow-related factors

Male normotensive Wistar rats (NWRs) and SHRs were used at 16 weeks of age. Their arterial pressure was measured by tail plethysmography prior to the experiments to confirm the hypertensive status of the SHRs. Then, the rats underwent implantation of an abdominal temperature sensor to measure T-abd and a guide cannula in the frontal cortex to enable the insertion of a thermistor to measure T-brain. After a familiarization period, each animal was subjected to incremental speed exercises until fatigue in either a temperate (25 degrees C) or warm (32 degrees C) environment, followed by a 60-min post-exercise period at the same temperature at which they exercised. T-brain, T-abd and tail-skin temperature (T-skin) were measured every min throughout the experiments. SHRs exhibited higher T-abd values than NWRs, and these higher values were transiently and persistently observed at 25 degrees C and 32 degrees C, respectively. For example, at 32 degrees C, T-abd was 0.84 degrees C higher in SHRs at the 25th min (large effect size). In contrast, regardless of the ambient temperature, SHRs exhibited similar T-brain, values as NWRs, indicating preserved T-brain regulation following exercise in hypertensive rats. SHRs presented higher T-skin during the last half of the post-exercise period at 25 degrees C, whereas no inter-group differences were observed at 32 degrees C. In conclusion, the present results highlight that SHRs, an animal model that mimics uncontrolled essential hypertension in humans, exhibited greater impairments in regulating T-abd than T-brain during the post-exercise period.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.04.011,83,NA,30-36,NA,Hypertension; Hyperthermia; Post-exercise; Recovery; Thermoregulation; Warm environment

article,A new look at survival times during cold water immersion,"Xu, Xiaojiang and Giesbrecht, Gordon G.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"This paper presents an expanded dataset for survival times during cold water immersion. In 1946, the first set of human data for cold water survival was derived from the US Navy medical reports during WWII. Although this is the largest and most widely used data source, it has only 23 data points and immersion times are less than 5.5 h for water temperature below 20 degrees C. For the new dataset, data (i.e., immersion times, water temperatures, clothing worn, and in some cases, body masses, heights, and survival times for the deaths witnessed by survivors) was retrieved from 12 well-documented incidents of accidental immersions which involved 22 survivors and 21 deaths. These data were combined with the 1946 dataset to create the expanded dataset which included 122 data points. Analysis of the dataset revealed critical details pertinent to cold water survival: 1) immersion times, up to 75 h, at water temperatures below 20 degrees C, were longer than most immersion times documented in the 1946 dataset; 2) thermal protection (wetsuit or drysuit), high body mass, and partial immersion may significantly impact survival during immersion in cold water; 3) twenty-one actual survival times until witnessed death are added. A maximal survival time curve was derived to represent the survival limit which many victims are unlikely to approach and few can exceed except under unique circumstances.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.08.022,78,NA,100-105,NA,Cold shock response; Hypothermia; Cold stress; Drowning; Survival prediction

The effects of flow rate, inhalation temperature and particle diameter were studied. It showed that the oral cavity is more likely to be affected by the inlet air conditions. The mucosa in the oral, pharynx and larynx are more likely to cause the thermal injury. The inspiration flow rate significantly influences the airflow fields, temperature distributions and particle deposition fraction interior of the human upper airway model, especially in the pharynx-larynx region. The rising flow rate, inhalation air temperature and particle diameter all contribute to boosting the total deposition fraction in the model.

article,Determination of time of death in forensic science via a 3-D whole body heat transfer model,"Bartgis, Catherine and LeBrun, Alexander M. and Ma, Ronghui and Zhu, Liang",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"This study is focused on developing a whole body heat transfer model to accurately simulate temperature decay in a body postmortem. The initial steady state temperature field is simulated first and the calculated weighted average body temperature is used to determine the overall heat transfer coefficient at the skin surface, based on thermal equilibrium before death. The transient temperature field postmortem is then simulated using the same boundary condition and the temperature decay curves at several body locations are generated for a time frame of 24 h. For practical purposes, curve fitting techniques are used to replace the simulations with a proposed exponential formula with an initial time delay. It is shown that the obtained temperature field in the human body agrees very well with that in the literature. The proposed exponential formula provides an excellent fit with an R-2 value larger than 0.998. For the brain and internal organ sites, the initial time delay varies from 1.6 to 2.9 h, when the temperature at the measuring site does not change significantly from its original value. The curve-fitted time constant provides the measurement window after death to be between 8 h and 31 h if the brain site is used, while it increases 60-95\% at the internal organ site. The time constant is larger when the body is exposed to colder air, since a person usually wears more clothing when it is cold outside to keep the body warm and comfortable. We conclude that a one-size-fits-all approach would lead to incorrect estimation of time of death and it is crucial to generate a database of cooling curves taking into consideration all the important factors such as body size and shape, environmental conditions, etc., therefore, leading to accurate determination of time of death.

article,The effects of a heat acclimation protocol in persons with spinal cord injury,"Trbovich, Michelle B. and Kiratli, Jenny B. and Price, Mike J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Persons without spinal cord injury (SCI) physiologically acclimate between seven to fourteen consecutive days of exercise in the heat. Decreased resting and exercise core temperature, decreased heart rate, increased plasma volume and increased thermal comfort during exercise are changes consistent with heat acclimation. Autonomic dysfunction after SCI impairs heat dissipation through sweating and vasodilation. The purpose of this study is to determine if seven consecutive days of exercise in the heat would result in physiologic changes consistent with heat acclimation in persons with SCI. Ten persons with SCI divided into two groups: tetraplegia (n=5) and paraplegia (n=5) exercised in 35 degrees C using an arm ergometer at 50\% W-peak for 30 min followed by 15 min rest. This protocol was repeated over seven consecutive days. Heart rate (HR), skin temperature, aural temperature (T-aur), rate of perceived exertion (RPE), rate of perceived thermal strain (RPTS), and plasma volume (PV) were measured throughout the protocol. There were no significant differences in resting T-aur exercise T-aur, mean skin temperature, HR, PV, RPE or RPTS over the 7 days for either the tetraplegic or paraplegic group. Participants with SCI did not demonstrate the ability to dissipate heat more efficiently over 7 days of exercise at 35 degrees C. The lack of heat acclimation seen in persons with SCI has implications for the athlete and non-athlete alike. For the SCI athlete, inability to acclimate will impair performance and endurance especially in warm environments, compared to the person without SCI. For the SCI non-athlete, there is a greater risk of heat-related illness in warm environments that cad negatively affect participation in outdoor activities and thus quality of life.",2016,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.10.006,62,A,56-62,NA,Thermoregulatory dysfunction; Heat acclimation; Spinal cord injury; Thermal strain
article,Thermal variation and factors influencing vertical migration behavior in <i>Daphnia</i> populations,"Glaholt, Stephen P. and Kennedy, Meghan L. and Turner, Elizabeth and Colbourne, John K. and Shaw, Joseph R.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The antipredator behavior diel vertical migration (DVM), common in aquatic keystone species Daphnia, involves daily migration from warmer surface waters before dawn to cooler deeper waters after dusk. Plasticity in Daphnia DVM behavior optimizes fitness via trade-offs between growth, reproduction, and predator avoidance. Migration behavior is affected by co-varying biotic and abiotic factors, including light, predator cues, and anthropogenic stressors making it difficult to determine each factor's individual contribution to the variation in this behavior. This study aims to better understand this ecologically significant behavior in Daphnia by: (1) determining how Daphnia pulicaria thermal preferences vary within and among natural populations; (2) distinguishing the role of temperature verses depth in Daphnia vertical migration; and (3) defining how two anthropogenic stressors (copper and nickel) impact Daphnia migratory behavior. Simulated natural lake stratification were constructed in 8 L (0.5 m tall, 14.5 cm wide) water columns to monitor under controlled laboratory conditions the individual effects of temperature gradients, depth, and metal stressors on Daphnia vertical migration. Three major findings are reported. First, while no difference in thermal preference was found among the four populations studied, within lake populations variability among isolates was high. Second, decoupling temperature and depth revealed that depth was a better predictor of Daphnia migratory patterns over temperature. Third, exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of copper or nickel inhibited classic DVM behavior. These findings revealed the high variability in thermal preference found within Daphnia populations, elucidated the individual roles that depth and temperature have on migratory behavior, and showed how copper and nickel can interfere with the natural response of Daphnia to fish predator cues. Thus contributing to the body of knowledge necessary to predict how natural populations of Daphnia will be affected by climate related changes in lake temperatures and increased presence of anthropogenic stressors.

article,Nest thermoregulation of the paper wasp <i>Polistes dominula</i>,"Hoecherl, Nicole and Kennedy, Shawn and Tautz, Juergen",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Wasps of the genus Polistes build combs without any cover and hence are insufficiently protected against temperature fluctuations. Due to this fact, different types of thermoregulation of Polistes dominula nests were investigated using the modern method of thermography. The study of active mechanisms for nest thermoregulation revealed no brood incubation or clustering behaviour of P. dominula. Furthermore, we found out that wing fanning for cooling the nest was almost undetectable (4 documented cases). However, we could convincingly record that water evaporation is most effective for nest cooling. By the direct comparison of active (with brood and adults) and non-active (without brood and adults) nests, the start of cooling by water evaporation was detected above maximum outside temperatures of 25 degrees C or at nest temperatures above 35 degrees C. The powerful role of water in nest cooling was manifested by an average decrease of temperature of single cells of about 8 degrees C and a mean duration of 7 min until the cells reached again their initial temperature. The investigation of passive thermoregulatory mechanisms revealed that the architecture of the nest plays an important role. Based on the presented results, it can be assumed that the vertical orientation of cells helps maintaining the warmth of nests during the night, whereas the pedicel assists in cooling the nest during the day. Therefore, our study of nest thermoregulation has revealed that P. dominula wasps regulate the temperature of their nest actively by evaporative cooling and passively by a careful site selection and the architecture of their nests.

article,An efficient and inexpensive method for measuring long-term thermoregulatory behavior,"Sauer, Erin L. and Sperry, Jinelle H. and Rohr, Jason R.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Thermoregulatory ability and behavior influence organismal responses to their environment. By measuring thermal preferences, researchers can better understand the effects that temperature tolerances have on ecological and physiological responses to both biotic and abiotic stressors. However, because of funding limitations and confounders, measuring thermoregulation can often be difficult. Here, we provide an effective, affordable (similar to\$50 USD per unit), easy to construct, and validated apparatus for measuring the long-term thermal preferences of animals. In tests, the apparatus spanned temperatures from 9.29 to 33.94 degrees C, and we provide methods to further increase this range. Additionally, we provide simple methods to non-invasively measure animal and substrate temperatures and to prevent temperature preferences of the focal organisms from being confounded with temperature preferences of its prey and its humidity preferences. To validate the apparatus, we show that it was capable of detecting individual level consistency and among individual-level variation in the preferred body temperatures of Southern toads (Anaxyrus terrestris) and Cuban tree frogs (Osteopilus septentrionalis) over three-weeks. Nearly every aspect of our design is adaptable to meet the needs of a multitude of study systems, including various terrestrial amphibious, and aquatic organisms. The apparatus and methods described here can be used to quantify behavioral thermal preferences, which can be critical for determining temperature tolerances across species and thus the resiliency of species to current and impending climate change.

It is also known that local changes in skin and subcutaneous temperature can affect fat metabolism. This study aimed to explore the potential effects of surrounding thermal environment on fat by investigating cell viability, lipid oxidation, and lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and palmitate-treated adipocytes after 4 h incubation. No significant differences of viability in 3T3-L1 adipocytes were detected under different temperature conditions. Despite no significant increase being observed under warm temperature (39 degrees C) conditions, a similarly significant suppression of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation were found in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and palmitate-treated adipocytes under 4 h exposure to cooler temperatures of 31-33 degrees C (P < 0.01). ROS, chemically reactive molecules containing oxygen, are currently understood to be a major contributor to oxidantive stress in obesity. Additionally, cooler temperatures (31-33 degrees C) could improve the size of lipid droplets in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (P < 0.01), but no significant effect was generated by temperature change on lipid droplets in palmitate-treated adipocytes. In the palmitate-induced adiposity model, although excessive ROS and lipid peroxidation has been attenuated by temperature decrease (P < 0.01), it still does not positively modulate lipid droplet size (P > 0.05) and remedy the palmitate damage induced cell death (P < 0.01). These findings provide preliminary support for potential interventions based on temperature manipulation for cell metabolism of adipocytes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A third group was pair-fed to HS dams in TN conditions (PFTN; 22.2 +/- 0.1 degrees C; n=8) from d4 to d19 of gestation. HS increased dam rectal temperature (p=0.01; 1.3 degrees C) compared to TN and PFTN mothers, and reduced FI (p=0.01; 33\%) compared to TN ad libitum fed controls. Although litter size was similar (p = 0.97; 10.9 pups/litter), pup birth weight was reduced (p = 0.03; 15.4\%) in HS compared to PFTN and TN dams. Two male pups per dam {[}n=8 in utero TN (IUTN); n=8 IUHS; n=8 in utero PFTN (IUPFTN)] were selected from four dams per treatment based on similar gestation length, and body composition was determined using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) on d26, d46, and d66 of postnatal life. Whole-body fat content increased (p=0.01; 11.2\%), and whole-body lean tissue decreased (p=0.01; 2.6\%) in IUPFTN versus IUTN and IUHS offspring.

Thus, rapid and reversible phenotypic modifications at different organizational levels are key for an efficient use of resources and survival. In this study, we provide a quantitative description of thermoregulatory capacities and energy-saving strategies in the Chilean marsupial Dromiciops gliroides. In particular, we evaluated the effect of thermal acclimation on basal metabolic rate (BMR), thermal conductance (C) and torpor patterns, as well as the presence of non-shivering thermogenesis (NST) as a rewarming mechanism in this marsupial. Non-significant effects of thermal acclimation were observed in BMR. C and body mass, but cold-acclimated individuals exhibited significantly longer torpor bouts. Also, minimum body temperature during torpor, inter-bout body temperature and arousal reviarming rate were lower in cold-acclimated animals. Furthermore, we found that D. gliroides did not display NSF in response to Norepinephrine. Hence, despite the high regulation of torpor of other species. D. gliroides shows low flexibility in the ability to adjust energy expenditure and insulation properties, and (as in other marsupials) NST do not seems to be important as thermoregulatory mechanism.

The thermal adaptation and thermal comfort index play a significant role in evaluating the outdoor thermal comfort. In this study, the aim is to capture the thermal sensation of respondents at outdoor environment through questionnaire survey and to determine the discomfort index (DI) to measure the thermal discomfort level. The results indicated that most respondents had thermally accepted the existing environment conditions although they felt slightly warm and hot. A strong correlation between thermal sensation and measured DI was also identified. As a result, a new discomfort index range had been proposed in association with local climate and thermal sensation of occupants to evaluate thermal comfort. The results had proved that the respondents can adapt to a wider range of thermal conditions. Validation of the questionnaire data at Putrajaya was done to prove that the thermal sensation in both Putrajaya and UTM was almost similar since they are located in the same tropical climate region. Hence, a quantitative field study on building layouts was done to facilitate the outdoor human discomfort level based on newly proposed discomfort index range. The results showed that slightly shaded building layouts of type- A and B exhibited higher temperature and discomfort index. The resultant adaptive thermal comfort theory was incorporated into the field studies as well. Finally, the study also showed that the DI values were highly dependent on ambient temperature and relative humidity but had fewer effects for solar radiation intensity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The optimal water temperature for embryonic development of this population is 21 degrees C However, in some cases, the temperatures of the spawning grounds during bream spawning are much higher, becoming semi-lethal or even lethal for bream embryos. The aim of the study was to investigate the natural and artificial spawning effectiveness of bream during a 4-year study regarding the reproductive effectiveness of the wild bream population in relation to thermal fluctuation (optimal and semi-lethal) of their ecosystem during the natural spawning season. During four following seasons, the bream spawners, as well as the eggs, were collected from the spawning grounds and incubated at optimal (21 degrees C) and semi-lethal (23 degrees C) temperatures. The spawning of mature bream was artificially induced and the obtained eggs were also incubated at the same temperatures. The period of observed spawners on the spawning grounds was different in different years: the longest time of bream spawning was in the second year of the study and the shortest was during the third year of the study. In the last year, a decrease in water temperature caused a break in the spawning. Thermal changes in water temperature during the spawning season may have caused a high mortality level of bream embryos and decreased the recruitment of the next species generation.

Natural arousal from torpor occurs spontaneously with highly predictable timing. However, animals can also be induced to arouse prematurely in response to various disturbances. While many investigations have used natural and induced arousals synonymously, direct comparisons of these two types of arousal have been limited. We address the question of whether natural and prematurely induced arousals generate the same patterns of warming at the level of the whole organism. We compare the effects of ambient temperature on the dynamics of natural versus induced arousals. Arousal duration, maximum rewarming rate, and the variance associated with increases in body temperature differed between natural and induced arousals. Prematurely inducing arousal also alters the duration of the interbout aroused (IBA) period.

article,Arginine vasopressin does not mediate heat loss in the tail of the rat,"Yang, Yong-Lu and Hu, Xiao-Song and Zan, Wang and Sheng, Zi-Ling and Huang, Tao and Wei, Ya-Jun",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"It has been reported that hypothermia induced by arginine vasopressin (AVP) is brought about by a coordinated response of reduced thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and increased heat loss through the tail of rats. However, it is well known that AVP is one of the strongest peripheral vasoconstrictors. Whether the AVP-induced hypothermia is associated with an increase in heat loss through the tail is questionable. Therefore, the present study assessed the relationship between the effects of AVP on tail skin temperature and the induced hypothermic response, and to determine if peripheral AVP administration increases heat loss from the tail. Core, BAT and tail skin temperature were monitored by telemetry in male Sprague-Dawley rats before and after intraperitoneal administration of AVP or vasopressin receptor antagonist. We also analyzed simultaneously of the time-course of AVP-induced hypothermic response and its relationship with changes in BAT temperature, and effect of AVP on grooming behavior. The key observations in this study were: (1) rats dosed with AVP induced a decrease in heat production (i.e., a reduction of BAT thermogenesis) and an increase of saliva spreading for evaporative heat loss (i.e., grooming behavior); (2) AVP caused a marked decrease in tail skin temperature and this effect was prevented by the peripheral administration of the vasopressin Via receptor antagonist, suggesting that exogenous AVP does not increase heat loss in the tail of rats; (3) the vasopressin V1a receptor antagonist could elevate core temperature without affecting tail skin temperature, suggesting that endogenous AVP is involved in suppression of thermogenesis, but not mediates heat loss in the tail of rats. Overall, the present study does not support the conclusion of previous reports that AVP increased tail heat loss in rats, because AVP-induced hypothermia in the rat is accompanied by a decrease in tail skin temperature. The data indicate that exogenous AVP-induced hypothermia attributed to the suppression of thermoregulatory heat production and the increase of saliva spreading for evaporative heat loss.

Therefore, there are many factors to consider when implementing genetic selection programs aimed at improving egg production under tropical conditions. So, trial is trying to improve the productivity and eggshell quality traits of the Fayoumi chicken under high ambient temperatures via selection programs and gene expression. In the present study, day-old Fayoumi chicks were raised either under normal temperature (control) or conditions of thermal stress (the heated group). At 35 weeks, male and female chickens from the control group were mated randomly and females selected for higher egg production and eggshell strength were mated to male siblings to obtain the progeny of the first generation (F-1). F-1 birds were further selected and mated to obtain the progeny of the second generation. Our results show that egg production and eggshell strength traits improved over successive generations via selection under conditions of heat stress. Furthermore, the reduction in egg production and eggshell strength as a result of heat stress declined from one generation to the next in birds selected for good heat tolerance, and an inverse relationship was observed between the OC-17 and eggshell strength. Additionally, levels of HSP90 and gene expression increased in the two successive generations, indicating that both productivity and heat tolerance were enhanced due to selection in birds raised under conditions of thermal stress. Moreover, generation exerted an important effect on this trait. Thus, desirable traits such as improved heat tolerance in producing lines were observed in Fayoumi chickens exposed to conditions of thermal stress via selection.

article,An altered Bioheat model for persons with cervical spinal cord injury,"Mneimneh, Farah and Ghaddar, Nesreen and Ghali, Kamel and Omeis, Ibrahim and Moussalem, Charbel",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The objective of this work is to develop a Bioheat model to predict the thermal responses of people with tetraplegia (TP) under hot, cold and neutral ambient conditions as well as different physical activities suitable for their level of injury. The focus is on TP with impairment or loss of motor and/or sensory function in C1 to C7 segments of the spinal cord due to damage of neural elements within the spinal canal. Starting from transient multi-segmented Bioheat model of able-bodied (AB) people, specific modifications were performed reflecting the changes in physiology due to the injury affecting the blood circulation system, energy expenditure, and thermoregulatory functions in the body. The TP Bioheat model predicts the TP thermal responses under steady and transient thermal conditions, and different activity levels that are appropriate for the level of injury. The model was validated with published experimental data reporting physiological and thermal data measurements on cases of people with complete and incomplete tetraplegia under controlled environmental conditions and activity levels. In both transient and steady state environmental conditions, the predicted core and mean skin temperature values were compared against the experimental data with maximum error of 0.86 degrees C and 0.9 degrees C respectively. The TP Bioheat model can be used as a tool to propose appropriate personal cooling strategies for TP.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.08.007,77,NA,96-110,NA,Bioheat modelling; Thermoregulatory functions; Persons with tetraplegia thermal response
article,Thermal modelling of controlled scalp hypothermia using a thermoelectric cooling cap,"Baldry, Mark and Timchenko, Victoria and Menictas, Chris",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"This study presents a novel, thermoelectric cryotherapy cap that aims to provide effective and controlled scalp cooling to prevent hair loss for chemotherapy patients. The cap's design consists of multiple thermoelectric coolers (TECs) evenly spaced and bonded to a soft thermal interface material, tightly fitted to a patient's head. A numerical model is developed to assess the performance of alternative cap designs in relation to their ability to achieve hair follicle hypothermia. Under ideal conditions, 26.5 W of heat removal from the scalp is required to achieve the clinically-significant follicle temperature target of 22 degrees C. Temperature maps of the subcutaneous tissue are generated to visualise the development of hypothermic follicles, and thereby assess the effectiveness of the cap design. Transient studies show that cooling to the therapeutic temperature can be achieved within 40 min. To avoid the possibility of cold-induced tissue damage, individual thermoelectric cooling modules should not be operated at a cooling flux beyond approximately 3175 W/m(2). This may be achieved with 38 modules evenly spaced in a checkerboard arrangement, each providing 0.7 W of cooling to the scalp.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.06.008,76,NA,8-20,NA,Scalp cooling; Numerical model; Alopecia; Thermoelectric; Peltier; Chemotherapy
article,Effects of fabric thickness and material on apparent `wet' conductive thermal resistance of knitted fabric `skin' on sweating manikins,"Wang, Faming and Lai, Dandan and Shi, Wen and Fu, Ming",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Currently, no published standard and research work have addressed the basic requirements on knitted fabric `skin' on sweating manikins. In this study, we performed 252 experiments to investigate the influence of fabric thickness and material on the apparent `wet' conductive (or effective) thermal resistance of the fabric `skin' using a `Newton' manildn. Four types of cotton fabric `skin' (fabric thickness: 0.38, 0.54, 0.92 and 1.43 mm) and three types of polyester fabric `skin' (fabric thickness: 0.41, 0.54 and 1.0 mm) were selected and their `wet' conductive thermal resistance was determined. Empirical equations were also developed for each fabric `skin' to predict wet fabric `skin' surface temperatures. It was found that both fabric thickness and material significantly affected the apparent `wet' conductive thermal resistance. Clothing total evaporative resistance determined using thin fabric `skin' (e.g., CO1, CO2) was normally lower than that determined using thick fabric `skin' (e.g., CO4). Besides, synthetic fabric `skin' tended to have a larger apparent `wet' conductive thermal resistance than the cotton fabric `skin' due to a smaller amount of moisture contained. Hence, there is a great need to standardize the fabric `skin' to eliminate the influence of fabric `skin' on the measurement of clothing evaporative resistance by means of a sweating manikin.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.03.004,70,"A, SI",69-76,NA,Sweating manikin; Evaporative resistance; Fabric `skin'; Thickness; Fabric porosity; `wet' conductive thermal resistance

The study also investigated the influence of differing ambient temperatures on the temperature difference between joints: this was measured ipsilaterally (i.e. between the carpal and fetlock joints along each forelimb) and contralaterally (i.e. between the same joints of the left and right forelimbs). Sixty-four healthy racehorses were monitored over 10 months. At each session, three thermographic images were taken of the dorsal, lateral and medial aspects of the distal forelimbs. Temperature measurements were made from regions of interest (ROIs) covering the carpal and fetlock joints. There was a strong correlation between ambient temperature and absolute joint temperature at all ROIs. The study also observed a moderate correlation between ambient temperature and the ipsilateral temperature differences between joints when measured from the medial and lateral aspects. No significant correlation was noted when measured dorsally. The mean contralateral temperature differences between joints were all close to 0 degrees C.

article,Sinoaortic denervation attenuates vasopressin-induced hypothermia and reduction of sympathetic nerve activity innervating brown adipose tissue in rats,"Yang, Yong-Lu and Liu, Xin and Luo, Rong and Xu, Jian-Hui and Liu, Chang",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"It is well known that sympathetic nerve activity innervating brown adipose tissue (BAT sympathetic nerve activity) plays an important role in BAT thermogenesis. We have found that peripheral administration of arginine vasopressin (AVP) induced hypothermia by reduced thermogenesis in BAT. However, little is known about AVP-induced hypothermic response and its relationship with BAT sympathetic nerve activity. Because increases in baroreceptor inputs inhibit peripheral sympathetic nervous activity, we hypothesized that AVP-induced hypothermia is related to baroreceptor reflex suppression of BAT sympathetic nerve activity. To test this hypothesis, Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to sinoaortic denervation or sham denervation, and implanted with radiotelemetry transmitters to assess the effects of peripheral administration of AVP on BAT sympathetic nerve activity, core and BAT temperatures. In sham-operated rats, an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 10 mu g/kg AVP led to a significant decrease in core and BAT temperatures. However, sinoaortic denervation significantly reduced the fall of core and BAT temperatures induced by AVP, compared with levels in sham-operated rats. AVP (10 mu g/kg i.p.) rapidly decreased BAT sympathetic nerve activity in control and sham-operated rats, with the greatest levels of suppression occurring at 35min and these lowest levels attained were with 30.6\% and 29.24\%, respectively. Furthermore, we found that sinoaortic denervation attenuated the suppressive effects of AVP (10 mu g/kg i.p.) on BAT sympathetic nerve activity. The greatest level of suppression was only 20.8\% occurring at 35min after AVP. Therefore, these results indicate that the hypothermic effects of peripheral administration of AVP are partially mediated by the arterial baroreceptor reflex suppression of BAT sympathetic nerve activity and BAT thermogenesis.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.03.008,66,NA,10-16,NA,Arginine vasopressin; Hypothermia; BAT sympathetic nerve activity; BAT thermogenesis

article,The effect of skin reflectance on thermal traits in a small heliothermic ectotherm,"Matthews, Genevieve and Goulet, Celine T. and Delhey, Kaspar and Chapple, David G.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Variation in colour patterning is prevalent among and within species. A number of theories have been proposed in explaining its evolution. Because solar radiation interacts with the pigmentation of the integument causing light to either be reflected or absorbed into the body, thermoregulation has been considered to be a primary selective agent, particularly among ectotherms. Accordingly, the colour-mediated thermoregulatory hypothesis states that darker individuals will heat faster and reach higher thermal equilibria while paler individuals will have the opposite traits. It was further predicted that dark colouration would promote slower cooling rates and higher thermal performance temperatures. To test these hypotheses we quantified the reflectance, selected body temperatures, performance optima, as well as heating and cooling rates of an ectothermic vertebrate, Lampropholis delicata. Our results indicated that colour had no influence on thermal physiology, as all thermal traits were uncorrelated with reflectance. We suggest that crypsis may instead be the stronger selective agent as it may have a more direct impact on fitness. Our study has improved our knowledge of the functional differences among individuals with different colour patterns, and the evolutionary significance of morphological variation within species.

R. and Kumar, Suresh and Deb, Rajib",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In a tropical country like India, thermal stress is one of the major factors which significantly affects the productivity of dairy cattle. The present study was aimed to identify the effect of heat and cold stress on cell viability, mitogen stimulation indices, nitric oxide production and HSP70 expression in Sahiwal and Holstein crossbred (Frieswal) population in India. The results indicated that the Sahiwal breed can better withstand the effect of heat and cold stress significantly (P < 0.05) when compared to the crossbred cattle due to the higher survivability of the Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) and Phytohemagglutinin (PHA-P) mitogen based stimulation indices. The study also revealed the significant differences (P < 0.05) in the level of nitric oxide (mu M) production amongst the pre and post thermal stressed samples of Sahiwal and Frieswal crossbred samples. Further, the expression of HSP70 was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in Sahiwal compared to Frieswal immediately after heat/cold shock to 6 h of recovery as indirect ELISA analysis showed gradual rise in the Hsp70 protein concentration (ng/ml) immediately after heat and cold stress (0 h) and reached the peak at 6 h of recovery. Western blot and immune fluorescent assay results were also corroborated with the findings of indirect ELISA. In Sahiwal cattle the mRNA expression of HSP70 and its protein concentration were higher (P < 0.05) during peak summer (44 degrees C) and winter (10 degrees C) as compared to Frieswal cattle.

article,Effect of heat on firefighters' work performance and physiology,"Larsen, Brianna and Snow, Rodney and Aisbett, Brad",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Wildland firefighters often perform their duties under both hot and mild ambient temperatures. However, the direct impact of different ambient temperatures on firefighters' work performance has not been quantified. This study compared firefighters' work performance and physiology during simulated wildland firefighting work in hot (HOT; 32 degrees C, 43\% RH) and temperate (CON; 19 degrees C, 56\% RH) conditions. Firefighters (n=38), matched and allocated to either the CON (n=18) or HOT (n=20) condition, performed simulated self-paced wildland fire suppression tasks (e.g., hose rolling/dragging, raking) in firefighting clothing for six hours, separated by dedicated rest breaks. Task repetitions were counted (and converted to distance or area). Core temperature (T-c), skin temperature (T-sk), and heart rate were recorded continuously throughout the protocol. Urine output was measured before and during the protocol, and urine specific gravity (USG) analysed, to estimate hydration. Ad libitum fluid intake was also recorded. There were no differences in overall work output between conditions for any physical task. Heart rate was higher in the HOT (55 +/- 2\% HRmax) compared to the CON condition (51 +/- 2\% HRmax) for the rest periods between bouts, and for the static hose hold task (69 +/- 3\% HRmax versus 65 +/- 3\% HRmax). T-c and T-sk were 0.3 +/- 0.1 degrees C and 3.1 +/- 0.2 degrees C higher in the HOT compared to the CON trial. Both pre- and within- shift fluid intake were increased two-fold in the heat, and participants in the heat recorded lower USG results than their CON counterparts. There was no difference between the CON and HOT conditions in terms of their work performance, and firefighters in both experimental groups increased their work output over the course of the simulated shift. Though significantly hotter, participants in the heat also managed to avoid excessive cardiovascular and thermal strain, likely aided by the frequent rest breaks in the protocol, and through doubling their fluid intake. Therefore, it can be concluded that wildland firefighters are able to safely and efficiently perform their duties under hot conditions, at least over six hours. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

M. and Hammill, Mike O. and Burns, Jennifer M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Heat balance can be difficult for young and/or small animals in polar regions because environmental conditions in combination with small body size or physiological immaturity can increase heat loss. We investigated bow thermoregulatory patterns change with ontogeny in 5 age classes of harp seal (Pagophilus groenlandicus) from birth to post-molt to further understand the timing of thermoregulatory development in relation to their potential vulnerability to ongoing fluctuations in the extent and stability of Arctic pack ice. We measured changes in the amount, conductivity, and resistance of the seal pups' insulative layers (blubber and fur), the potential for endogenous heat-generation by shivering (muscle enzyme activity), and nonshivering thermogenesis (NST; brown adipose tissue (BAT) uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression and mitochondrial density). There was no significant difference in blubber conductivity among age classes, though the amount of blubber insulation significantly increased from birth to weaning. Pelage conductivity was low (0.12 +/- 0.01 W m(-1) degrees C-1) except in 9-day old pups (0.40 +/- 0.08 W m(-1) degrees C-1); the significantly higher conductivity may signal the beginning of the molt, and this age group may be the most vulnerable to early water entry. Citrate synthase activity significantly increased (49.68 +/- 3.26 to 75.08 +/- 3.52 mu mol min(-1) g wet weight(-1)) in the muscle; however it is unlikely that increasing a single enzyme greatly impacts heat generation. BAT of younger pups contained UCP1, though expression and mitochondrial density quickly declined, and the ability of pups to produce heat via NST was lost by weaning. While total thermal resistance did not differ, neonatal and early nursing animals gained the majority of their thermal resistance from lanugo (82.5 +/- 0.03\%); however, lanugo is not insulative when wet, and NST may be important to maintain euthermia and dry the coat if early immersion in water occurs. By late nursing, blubber seems sufficient as insulation (75.87 +/- 0.01\% of resistance after 4 weeks), but high conductivity of fur may be responsible for retention of UCP1 expression. Weaned animals rely on blubber insulation, and no longer need NST, as wetted fur is no longer a threat to euthermia. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Heart rate, end-tidal PCO2, cerebral oxygenation, a marker of blood-brain barrier integrity ({[}S100 beta]), cognition (Stroop test) and perceptions were recorded at rest, Cycles1 and 2, and 5 h post-exercise. MF had less cerebral deoxygenation during exercise (MF: -5 +/- 14, HF: 8 +/- 7 mu M L-1), but {[}S100 beta] was unchanged across fitness and colostrum supplementation. Hypocapnia was evident from Cycle1 to Run2 with end-tidal PCO2 decreasing from 36 +/- 5 to 31 +/- 5 mmHg in both trials. Response time to simple and complex tasks decreased during exercise by similar to 83 and similar to 301 ms, compared to rest in both fitness groups in both trials. The time difference between complex and simple tasks (i.e. decision-making time) also decreased from 724 +/- 200 (Rest) to 552 +/- 326 (Cycle1), 565 +/- 148 (Cycle2) and 515 +/- 216 ms (post-exercise; pooled results). We conclude that fitness per se does not modulate cognitive executive function or blood-brain barrier permeability during comparable, relative-intensity exercise in the heat, and that colostrum supplementation had negligible effect on performance, cognitive or cerebrovascular functioning.

Kisspeptin receptor (Kiss1r) knockout (KO) mice display an obese phenotype in adulthood compared to wild-type (WT) controls due to reduced energy expenditure. Additionally, experimental evidence shows that the temperature of typical rodent housing conditions (22 degrees C) increases the metabolism of mice above basal levels. Female Kiss1r KO mice show reduced core temperature and impaired temperature adaptation to an acute cold challenge, suggesting their temperature homeostasis processes are altered. The present study examined the phenotype of gonadectomised Kiss1r KO mice at both sub-thermoneutral and thermoneutral temperature (22 degrees C and 30 degrees C). Our results confirmed the obese phenotype in Kiss1r KO mice at 22 degrees C, and revealed a sexually dimorphic effect of thermal neutrality on the phenotype. In female KO mice, the obesity observed at 22 degrees C was attenuated at 30 degrees C. Plasma leptin levels were higher in KO than WT female mice at 22 degrees C (P < 0.001) but not at 30 degrees C. Importantly, the expression of Ucp1 mRNA in brown adipose tissue was lower in KO mice compared to WT mice at 22 degrees C (P < 0.05), but not different from WT at 30 degrees C. In male KO mice, a metabolic phenotype was observed at 22 degrees C and 30 degrees C. These results provide further evidence for kisspeptin-mediated regulation of adiposity via altered energy expenditure. Moreover, thermoneutral housing alleviated the obese phenotype in female Kiss1r KO mice, compared to WT, indicating the impairment in these mice may relate to an inability to adapt to the chronic cold stress that is experienced at 22 degrees C.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102592,90,NA,NA,102592,Kisspeptin; Metabolism; GPR54; Kiss1; Leptin
article,Does dietary supplementation with phytases affect the thermoregulatory and behavioral responses of pullets in a tropical environment?,"de Sena, Thais Lucas and Bastos Leite, Silvana Cavalcante and de Vasconcelos, Angela Maria and Rodrigues Bezerra, Maria Mislane and de Abreu, Claudia Goulart and Silva de Farias, Maria Rogervania and Freitas Silveira, Robson Mateus",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Dietary supplementation of two types of phytases (fungal and bacterial) with different dosages (300 and 900 FTUs) was evaluated in the thermoregulatory and behavioral responses of replacement pullets in a tropical environment. 288 Hy-Line White laying birds with a mean weight of 639.60 +/- 6.05 g, clinically healthy, and eight weeks old were used in the study. Respiratory rate (RR, breaths. min(-1)), Cloacal temperature (CT, degrees C), Surface temperature with feathers (STWF, degrees C), and Surface temperature featherless (STF, degrees C) were measured in the morning and afternoon. Behavioral data were observed through the following activities: sitting, eating, drinking, exploring feathers (EF), non-aggressive pecking (NAP), and object pecking (OP) recorded every 10 min from 6 a. m. to 5 p.m. Environmental variables were measured along with thermoregulatory and behavioral responses. There was an interaction for RR between phytase and period of the day (P < 0.05). The lowest RR (morning) was observed in fungal phytase. STF and STWF were higher (P < 0.05) in the afternoon. Birds supplemented with fungal phytase showed lower STWF (P < 0.05). The variables that contributed to explain physiological and behavioral responses are shown in order of importance for (i) periods of day: morning (sitting, STWF, drinking, eating, and CT) and afternoon (STF, STWF, OP, drinking, eating, RR and sitting); (ii) phytases: fungal (STF, STWF, RR, sitting, eating and drinking); and bacterial (RR, STF, STWF, CT and sitting). Thermoregulatory and behavioral responses were similar between dosages, but different between types of phytases. Birds supplemented with fungal phytase used sensible heat dissipation mechanisms and exhibited thermal comfort behaviors. The 300 and 900 FTUs phytase doses did not influence the thermoregulatory and behavioral responses of birds, while they showed natural heat dissipation and heat stress behaviors in the afternoon.

article,"The origin, significance and plasticity of the thermoeffector thresholds: Extrapolation between humans and laboratory rodents","Taylor, Nigel A. S. and Gordon, Christopher J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In this review, there is an overarching emphasis on the extrapolation of knowledge from one physiological regulator to another, with a particular emphasis on autonomic thermoregulation in humans and rodents. Through mammalian phylogenetics, one finds evidence for the gradual acquisition of an ability to maintain whole-body thermal stability, with discrete autonomic mechanisms arising for the generation, retention and dissipation of thermal energy. The sequential attainment of those thermoeffectors, over aeons, makes it unlikely that they are controlled by a common central processor, so the presence of a single activation switch is perhaps inconceivable. Instead, effector activation is associated with the arrival at lower and upper critical (threshold) body temperatures, with regions between those points defining zones of mammalian thermoneutrality. As thermal energy content deviates from thermoneutrality, there is a progression from purely passive (physical) heat exchanges through to autonomic (thermoeffector) recruitment. That activation is morphologically dependent, with an obligatory greater basal metabolic heat production evident in smaller individuals within both hypo- and normothermic states. Indeed, a first-principles, morphological case is presented for the existence of an effector recruitment cascade, with human observations providing the empirical support. That sequential activation is consistent with the presence of multiple central controllers, and both animal and human experiments supporting that possibility are reviewed. Finally, the case is presented that mammals possess multiple thermoreceptive fields, thermoeffectors with discrete neural pathways and several central, but independent, controllers of thermoeffector function. Those concepts are summarised in updated conceptual and neuronal models for human thermoregulation.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.08.003,85,NA,NA,102397,Evaporative heat loss; Non-evaporative heat loss; Thermoeffector thresholds; Thermogenesis; Sudomotor; Vasoconstriction; Vasodilatation

The objectives of this study were to evaluate protective effects of baicalin on testicular tissue damage of mice subjected to heat stress and its related mechanisms. In this experiment, A total of forty mice were divided into four groups, including control group (C), baicalin group (B), heat stressed group (H) and heat stress with baicalin treatment (H + B) group. Morphological changes, activities of antioxidant enzymes and apoptosis-related parameters in the mice testes tissue were monitored. The results showed that the process of spermatogenesis in mice testis was impaired and the cellular apoptosis increased due to acute heat stress at 41 degrees C. Interestingly, the tissue damage was alleviated with the significant (P < 0.05) increase in the activities of SOD, CAT and GSH-Px enzymes, decrease (P < 0.05) in MDA content and number of cellular apoptosis recorded in mice of H + B group compared with those in mice from H group. In addition, the Fas, FasL and P-JNK protein expressions were significantly (P < 0.05) increased; and apaf-1, caspase-3, -9 were slightly expressed in the H group, while there was no difference in Bcl-2 expression, compared with C, B and H + B groups. The above results clearly indicate that heat stress induces macroscopic/apoptotic and oxidative changes in the testicular tissue of mice; these changes are alleviated by Baicalin through increasing anti-oxidative enzyme activities and possibly through blocking Fas/FasL pathway.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.03.009,82,NA,63-69,NA,Heat stress; Mice testis; Baicalin; Redox imbalance; Fas/FasL pathway
article,Field study of neutrality cabin temperature for Chinese passenger in economy class of civil aircraft,Pang Liping and Zhang Jie and WanYan Xiaoru and Fan Jun and Li Shuxin,JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Cabin thermal comfort is an important factor for the competitiveness of civil aviation. It has become a hot topic in recent years. However, there are still no clear standards for the thermal comfort in the aircraft cabin. In this paper, the cabin thermal comfort of passengers in 30 flights was investigated. Both objective and subjective data were collected in order to obtain a neutrality cabin temperature, T-nc. The investigation shows that the distribution of Thermal Sensation Votes (TSVs) was approximately symmetric around the ``Neutral{''} vote. The clothing insulation value of passengers, I-CLO, was affected by the outdoor mean new effective temperature of departure city, ET{*}. T-nc also changed with the outdoor ET{*}. According to this field surveys, a linear relationship is built between T-nc and ET{*} as an adaptive model for the civil aircraft cabin. This adaptive model can be used as a reference to control the cabin operative temperature around the passengers. In this way, the cabin thermal comfort requirement may be satisfied for most of the passengers.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.10.006,78,NA,312-319,NA,Civil aircraft cabin; Neutrality adaptation temperature; Thermal comfort; Field study
article,Supercooling point is an individually fixed metric of cold tolerance in <i>Pyrrhocoris apterus</i>,"Ditrich, Tomas",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Measuring the supercooling point (SCP) is a standard procedure to describe the cold tolerance of freeze-avoiding arthropods. The SCP of an individual animal is a stochastic event that will occur with increasing probability as the temperature is lowered below the freezing point of that animal. Nevertheless, the repeatability and extent of stochasticity of the SCP has not previously been determined. The repeatability of the SCP in post-diapause, laboratory cold-acclimated and naturally acclimated field-collected linden bugs (Pyrrhocoris apterus; Heteroptera: Pyrrhocoridae) was investigated in this study. Two methods were used: (a) repeated freezing of previously frozen and thawed individuals, and (b) repeated cooling of groups of individuals to the population median SCP. The results showed a significant positive correlation between the SCP and repeated SCP. All individuals died when frozen, whereas none died at temperatures above the SCP. Most of the individuals survived repeated cooling to the population median SCP. Survivorship increased from 85\% to 97\% (first to fourth repeated cooling to the population median SCP) when individuals were frozen to within 0.5 degrees C above the population median SCP. The SCP in post-diapause, cold-acclimated insects is a fixed, intrinsic cold tolerance metric with slight individual stochastic variance (SD < 1 degrees C).",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.04.004,74,NA,208-213,NA,Cold tolerance; SCP; Freeze avoidance; Repeated cooling
article,Developing a new individualized 3-node model for evaluating the effects of personal factors on thermal sensation,"Davoodi, Farzin and Hasanzadeh, Hasan and Zolfaghari, Seyed Alireza and Maerefat, Mehdi",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Individual differences, such as weight, height, gender, age, and Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), between human subjects can significantly affect body thermoregulatory mechanisms. Therefore, application of common population-based thermal comfort models cannot provide accurate results for an individual's thermal sensation. Based on the standard thermal models, including those of Fanger and Gagge, individual parameters are not considered in the evaluation of thermal sensations. Thus, these simplified standard models have some limitations under varied individual conditions. In this study, a new individualized thermal comfort model is presented on the basis of a simplified 3-node model. This model was developed by regarding the effects of individual characteristics, such as age, gender, Body Mass Index (BMI), and BMR on the thermal sensations of the bare and clothed parts of the body. A good agreement was found in the current model, which was verified based on the experimental data. In conclusion, the results indicated that the mean error in the prediction of skin temperature decreased from 1.2 degrees C to 0.4 degrees C when using the new individual model instead of a non-individualized 3-node model.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.05.004,69,NA,1-12,NA,Thermal comfort; Individual parameters; Three-node model; Thermal sensation

Y. and Dufresne, F. and Blier, P. U. and Lemieux, H.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"This study assessed the thermal sensitivity of mitochondrial respiration in the small crustacean Daphnia pulex. More specifically, we wanted to determine if clones that inhabit different latitudes and habitats showed differences in the thermal sensitivity of their mitochondrial function. The experimental design included two clones from temperate environments (Fence from Ontario and Hawrelak from Alberta) and two clones from subarctic environments (A24 from Manitoba and K154 from Quebec). The integrated mitochondrial function was measured with high-resolution respirometry following whole-animal permeabilization. Mitochondrial respiration was performed under six different temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 degrees C) in the clone Hawrelak and at two temperatures (10 and 20 degrees C) in the three other clones. In the clone Hawrelak, complexes I and II respiration showed higher sensitivity to temperature variation compared to complex IV respiration. Interestingly, the threshold plot showed no excess capacity of complex IV at 20 degrees C in this clone. The clones showed significant divergence in the ability to oxidize the complex I and complex N substrates relative to the maximal oxidative phoshorylation capacity of mitochondria. More importantly, some of the clonal divergences were only detected under low assay temperatures, pointing toward the importance of this parameter in comparative studies.

Altitude shows an inverse relationship with thermal responses. Comparison of thermal responses of species emerging early or late in the season within the same habitat show increases in the thermal responses along with the increasing environmental temperatures late in the summer. However, behavior, specifically the use of endothermy as a thermoregulatory strategy, can influence the values determined in a particular habitat.

article,Indirect hand and forearm vasomotion: Regional variations in cutaneous thermosensitivity during normothermia and mild hyperthermia,"Burdon, Catriona A. and Tagami, Kyoko and Park, Joonhee and Caldwell, Joanne N. and Taylor, Nigel A. S.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In this experiment, hand and forearm vasomotor activity was investigated during localised, but stable heating and cooling of the face, hand and thigh, under open-loop (clamped) conditions. It was hypothesised that facial stimulation would provoke the most potent vascular changes. Nine individuals participated in two normothermic trials (mean body temperature clamp: 36.6 degrees C; water-perfused suit and climate chamber) and two mildly hyperthermic trials (37.9 degrees C). Localised heating (+5 degrees C) and cooling (-5 degrees C) stimuli were applied to equal surface areas of the face, hand and thigh (perfusion patches: 15 min), while contralateral forearm or hand blood flows (venous-occlusion plethysmography) were measured (separate trials). Thermal sensation and discomfort votes were recorded before and during each thermal stimulation. When hyperthermic, local heating induced more sensitive vascular responses, with the combined thermosensitivity of both limb segments averaging 0.011 mL{''}100 mL(-1).min(-l) mmHg(-1). degrees C-1, and 0.005 mL{''}100 mL(-1)min(-1)mmHg(-1). degrees C-1 during localised cooling (P < 0.05). Inter-site comparisons among the stimulated sites yielded minimal evidence of variations in local thermal sensation, and no differences were observed for vascular conductance (P> 0.05). Therefore, regional differences in vasomotor and sensory sensitivity appeared not to exist. When combined with previous observations of sudomotor sensitivity, it seems that, during mild heating and cooling, regional representations within the somatosensory cortex may not translate into meaningful differences in thermal sensation or the central integration of thermoafferent signals. It was concluded that inter -site variations in the cutaneous thermosensitivity of these thermolytic effectors have minimal physiological significance over the ranges investigated thus far.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.02.015,65,NA,95-104,NA,Skin blood flow; Skin temperature; Thermoregulation; Thermosensitivity; Vasomotor

Zinc is an essential trace element in animal nutrition. Here we investigate the effects of dietary zinc on epididymal structure and function in Bama miniature pigs treated with heat exposure and investigate approaches to improve the reproductive performance in summer. Male Bama miniature pigs (n=18; aged 6 months; bodyweight=10.79 +/- 0.06 kg) were randomly allocated to 3 groups: control group (Control), heat treatment group (HT), and the diet-supplemented and heat treatment group (H+Zn). The Control and HT groups were fed with basal diet and the H+Zn group were fed with basal diet plus 1500 mg/kg zinc daily. After being fed with these 2 different diets for 30 days, pigs in the HT and H+Zn groups were exposed to 5 h of 40 C heat treatment for 8 days. Rectal temperature and jugular venous blood were collected 3 h after onset of heat exposure on days 1, 4 and 8. Pigs were sacrificed after the termination of heat exposure. Heat treatment increased serum testosterone concentration on day 1 and 4 (P < 0.01). In addition, the HT group displayed an increase in the clear cell count and a decrease in epithelium thickness in the caput epithelium (P < 0.01, P < 0.05), and dietary zinc protected the boars from these impairments (P < 0.01, P=0.29). Evaluation of oxidative states showed that heat exposure increased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) in the epididymis (P < 0.01, P < 0.05), while dietary zinc reduced this elevation (P < 0.01, P < 0.01). Heat exposure enhanced the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression in the nuclei of principal and basal cells (P < 0.01, P < 0.01) while dietary zinc attenuated the GR immunoreactivity intensity (P < 0.01, P < 0.01).

article,Fire service instructor's undergarment choice to reduce Interleukin-6 and minimise physiological and perceptual strain,"Watkins, Emily R. and Richardson, Alan J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Fire Service Instructors frequently experience high levels of physiological and perceptual strain during live fire exposures. Instructors are also at risk of cardiovascular illnesses, with cardiac death being the greatest cause of fire fighter death. Current practice for UK instructors is to select undergarment type based on personal preference, between a boiler suit (BOILER) and a wicking base layer (WBL). Research suggests that shorts and t-shirt (SHORTS) may also be a beneficial alternative undergarment choice. The UK South East Fire Service requested an investigation to identify if undergarment selection can lessen the Strain experienced by instructors, and reduce the acute inflammatory response to fire exposures. Eight males completed three 45 min sessions in a heat chamber (49.5 +/- 1.4 degrees C and 16.9 +/- 4.3\% RH) whilst performing intermittent walking. At the end of heat exposure change in heart rate was not effected by garment type (p=0.061, eta p(2)=0.373). Change in rectal temperature was different between garments (p=0.009, eta(2)(p)=0.271), with trends suggesting that BOILER resulted in a greater change (1.03 +/- 0.60 degrees C) than SHORTS (0.76 +/- 0.37 degrees C, p=0.589, d=0.21) and WBL (0.72 0.33 degrees C, p=0.545, d=0.25). Interleukin-6 post exposure was greater for BOILER (6.96 +/- 0.28 pg mL(-1)) than both SHORTS (6.59 +/- 0.30 pg mL(-1), p=0.043, d=0.42) and WBL (6.45 +/- 0.43 pg mL(-1), p=0.031, d=0.51). Overall, undergarment type had little impact on physiological or perceptual strain. However, wearing WBL or SHORTS may reduce the inflammatory response, and consequently decrease the risk of cardiovascular events.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.11.004,63,NA,41-48,NA,Fire service; Heat exposure; Clothing; Occupational health
article,Brown adipose tissue thermogenesis does not explain the intra-administration hyperthermic sign-reversal induced by serial administrations of 60\% nitrous oxide to rats,"Al-Noori, Salwa and Ramsay, Douglas S. and Cimpan, Andreas and Maltzer, Zoe and Zou, Jessie and Kaiyala, Karl J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Initial administration of >= 60\% nitrous oxide (N2O) to rats promotes hypothermia primarily by increasing whole-body heat loss. We hypothesized that the drug promotes heat loss via the tail and might initially inhibit thermogenesis via brown adipose tissue (BAT), major organs of thermoregulation in rodents. Following repeated administrations, N2O inhalation evokes hyperthermia underlain by increased whole body heat production. We hypothesized that elevated BAT thermogenesis plays a role in this thermoregulatory sign reversal. Using dual probe telemetric temperature implants and infrared (IR) thermography, we assessed the effects of nine repeated 60\% N2O administrations compared to control (con) administrations on core temperature, BAT temperature, lumbar back temperature and tail temperature. Telemetric core temperature, telemetric BAT temperature, and IR BAT temperature were reduced significantly during initial 60\% N2O inhalation (p <= 0.001 compared to con). IR thermography revealed that acute N2O administration unexpectedly reduced tail temperature (p=0.0001) and also inhibited IR lumbar temperature (p < 0.0001). In the 9th session, N2O inhalation significantly increased telemetric core temperature (p=0.007) indicative of a hyperthermic sign reversal, yet compared to control administrations, telemetric BAT temperature (p=0.86), IR BAT temperature (p=0.85) and tail temperature (p=0.47) did not differ significantly. Thus, an initial administration of 60\% N2O at 21 degrees C may promote hypothermia via reduced BAT thermogenesis accompanied by tail vasoconstriction as a compensatory mechanism to limit body heat loss. Following repeated N2O administrations rats exhibit a hyperthermic core temperature but a normalized BAT temperature, suggesting induction of a hyperthermia-promoting thermogenic adaptation of unknown origin.

article,"Physiological responses to changes in relative humidity under thermally neutral, warm and hot conditions","Kakitsuba, Naoshi",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Four hypothetical thermophysiological responses to changes in relative humidity (Rh) under thermally neutral, warm, and hot conditions were proposed for a person at rest. Under thermally neutral and warm conditions, the first hypothetical response to an increase in Rh was a decrease in mean skin temperature ((T) over bar (sk)) due to increase in mean evaporation rate ((E) over bar (sk)), and the second hypothetical response to a decrease in Rh was a decrease, an increase, or no change in (T) over bar (sk), depending on changes in the (E) over bar (sk). Under hot conditions, the third hypothetical response to an increase in the Rh was an increase in (T) over bar (sk) or decrease in (T) over bar (sk) upon decrease in the Rh due to changes in (E) over bar (sk), and the forth hypothetical response to an increase in Rh was an increase in (T) over bar (sk) due to increase in the peripheral blood flow rate (SkBF). To test these hypotheses, the (T) over bar (sk) and (E) over bar (sk) of four young male volunteers were measured at 28 degrees C, 30 degrees C, or 32 degrees C while the Rh was maintained at 40\% or 80\% Rh for 60 min after 20 min exposure at 60\% Rh (control condition). In a second experiment, the (T) over bar (sk), (E) over bar (sk), and SkBF of five young male volunteers were measured at 34 degrees C-40\% Rh or 36 degrees C-40\% Rh, or 34 degrees C-70\% Rh or 36 degrees C-70\% Rh for 60 min after 20 min exposure at 28 degrees C-60\% Rh (control condition). The first hypothesis was partly supported by the findings that the (T) over bar (sk) was lower than the control values at 28 degrees C-80\% Rh and the (E) over bar (sk) was higher than the control values at 80\% Rh at any tested temperature. The second hypothesis was partly supported by the findings that the (T) over bar (sk) was lower than the control values at 28 degrees C-40\% Rh, and there were small changes in both (T) over bar (sk) and (E) over bar (sk) at 30 degrees C-40\% Rh. The third and fourth hypotheses were supported by the findings that the (T) over bar (sk) at 36 degrees C-70\% Rh was significantly higher (p < 0.01) than at 36 degrees C-40\% Rh, the <(E)over bar>(sk) was significantly higher (p < 0.01) at 70\% Rh than at 40\% Rh, and SkBF was positively correlated with <(T)over bar>(sk).

article,Source term prediction in a multilayer tissue during hyperthermia,"Baghban, M. and Ayani, M. B.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"One of the major challenges in the use of hyperthermia to treat cancer is determining the desired heating power of external source in such a way that the thermal injury is confined to the unhealthy tissue. In this study, an inverse method based on the sequential method is proposed to estimate the desired heating power as a function of time for a successful hyperthermia treatment. In order to simulate the measured temperature, the direct problem is solved for a multilayer skin tissue to obtain the temperature data at the skin surface. These data are employed in the inverse problem to estimate the heating power of external source. Two examples are considered to examine the accuracy of the inverse analysis. In addition, the effect of measurement errors is investigated. Results show that the proposed inverse algorithm is able to determine the desired heating power of external source accurately, even in the presence of measurement errors. However, for noisy data, more temperature measurements are required to achieve reliable results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The Alentejana showed significant increases in sweating rate (156 g m(2) h(-1)) that played a major role in homeothermy. The Mertolenga showed a superior stability of body temperature, even in the period of highest heat stress (from 38.5 degrees C to 39.1 degrees C). Uncommonly, the maintenance of homeothermy during moderate heat stress was achieved primarily by intense tachypnea (122 mov/min). The sweating rate remained abnormally low under conditions of moderate heat stress, rising significantly (110 g m(-2) h(-1)) without evidence of stabilization, only when tendency for heat storage occurred. This unusual response of the evaporative heat loss pathways infers a different thermoregulatory strategy, suggesting a different adaptation to semi-arid environment and strong association with water metabolism.

article,"Seasonal changes in the composition of storage and membrane lipids in overwintering larvae of the codling moth, <i>Cydia pomonella</i>","Rozsypal, Jan and Kostal, Vladimir and Berkova, Petra and Zahradnickova, Helena and Simek, Petr",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The codling moth (Cydia pomonella) is a major insect pest of apples worldwide. It overwinters as a diapausing fifth instar larva. The overwintering is often a critical part of the insect life-cycle in temperate zone. This study brings detailed analysis of seasonal changes in lipid composition and fluidity in overwintering larvae sampled in the field. Fatty acid composition of triacylglycerol (TG) depots in the fat body and relative proportions of phospholipid (PL) molecular species in biological membranes were analyzed. In addition, temperature of melting (T-m) in TG depots was assessed by using differential scanning calorimetry and the conformational order (fluidity) of PL membranes was analyzed by measuring the anisotropy of fluorescence polarization of diphenylhexatriene probe in membrane vesicles. We observed a significant increase of relative proportion of linoleic acid (C18:2n6) at the expense of palmitic acid (C16:0) in TG depots during the larval transition to diapause accompanied with decreasing melting temperature of total lipids, which might increase the accessibility of depot fats for enzymatic breakdown during overwintering. The fluidity of membranes was maintained very high irrespective of developmental mode or seasonally changing acclimation status of larvae. The seasonal changes in PL composition were relatively small. We discuss these results in light of alternative survival strategies of codling moth larvae (supercooling vs. freezing), variability and low predictability of environmental conditions, and other cold tolerance mechanisms such as extending the supercooling capacity and massive accumulation of cryoprotective metabolites.

article,"Effect of temperature, photoperiod, and feeding on the rate of tail regeneration in a semiaquatic plethodontid salamander","Marvin, Glenn A. and Lewis, Mattie",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Salamander tail autotomy improves survival, but loss of the tail can subsequently be costly. For example, burst swimming speed is significantly slower after autotomy in desmognathan salamanders, which may increase predation risk in aquatic habitats. However, any long-term cost of tail loss is contingent on the rate of tail regeneration. To examine variation among seasons and environments in the cost of tail autotomy, we tested the effect of temperature, photoperiod, and feeding on tail-length re-growth in the semiaquatic plethodontid salamander Desmognathus conanti. Eight experimental groups (n=15 each, equivalent in body size) were tested. After acclimation for four weeks at one of two temperatures (either 10 degrees C or 20 degrees C) and one of two photoperiods (either L:D 9.5:14.5 h or 14.5:9.5 h), 60\% of the tail length was autotomized for each individual. After autotomy, each experimental group was maintained under unique conditions of temperature (either 10 C or 20 C), photoperiod (either L:D 9.5:14.5 h or 14.5:9.5 h), and feeding (either fasting or weekly feeding). The length of the regenerated tail portion for each individual was measured each week until the group with the fastest re-growth had regenerated 50\% of the lost tail length. Low temperature had a large, negative effect, fasting had a small, negative effect, but photoperiod had no significant effect on tail re-growth. The large thermal effect resulted from a combination of delayed initiation of tail-length re-growth and reduced regeneration rate thereafter at low temperature. We conclude that the cost of salamander tail autotomy differs among seasons and environments based on variation in temperature and food availability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Seasonal acclimatization to the hot summer over 60 days in the Republic of Korea suppresses sweating sensitivity during passive heating,"Lee, Jeong-Beom and Kim, Tae-Wook and Min, Young-Ki and Yang, Hun-Mo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The main objective of this study was to determine the central mechanisms involved in suppression of thermal sweating after seasonal acclimatization (SA) during passive heating (immersing the legs in 43 degrees C hot water for 30 min). Testing was performed in July (before-SA) and August (after-SA) 125.2 +/- 2.2 degrees C, 73.9 +/- 10.3\% relative humidity (RH), Cheonan (Chungnam, 126 degrees 52'N, 33.38'E), in the Republic of Korea. All experiments were carried out in an automated climatic chamber (25.0 +/- 0.5 degrees C and RH 60.0 +/- 3.00\%). Twelve healthy men (height, 174.6 +/- 5.40 cm; weight, 65.4 +/- 5.71 kg; age, 22.7 +/- 2.90 yr) participated. The local sweat onset time was delayed in the after-SA compared to that in the before-SA (p < 0.001). The local sweat rate and whole body sweat loss volume decreased in the after-SA compared to those in the before-SA (p < 0.001). In addition, evaporative loss volume decreased significantly in the after-SA compared to that in the before-SA {[}chest, upper-back, thigh and forearm (p < 0.001)]. Changes in tympanic temperature and mean body temperature were significantly lower (p < 0.05) and the basal metabolic rate decreased significantly in the after-SA compared to those in the before-SA (p < 0.001). These results suggest that maintenance of a lower body temperature and basal metabolic rate can occur and blunt the central sudomotor mechanisms following seasonal acclimatization, which suppresses sweating sensitivity.

article,Could the intrinsic rate of increase represent the fitness in terrestrial ectotherms?,"Shi, Peijian and Sandhu, Hardev S. and Ge, Feng",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) has been considered as an important indicator of fitness in terrestrial ectotherms since long. It is actually an equivalent to the instantaneous growth rate of the exponential equation for describing the density-independent population growth. In terrestrial ectotherms, r(m) has been demonstrated to be temperature-dependent. The temperature at which r(m) was maximal, was considered to be the ``optimal{''} temperature for fitness in Amarasekare and Savage (2012), but this definition needs further analysis. Only r(m) cannot provide thorough representation of fitness. Because body size can affect the competitive abilities in many terrestrial ectotherms, both population size and body size should be considered in measuring the fitness of ectotherms. The rule of ``bigger is better{''} requires relatively low temperature to increase in body size, whereas relatively high temperature is required for a rapid increase in population size. Thus, there is presumably a trade-off in temperature for adjusting individual body size and population size to achieve maximum fitness. We hypothesized that this temperature could be reflected by the intrinsic optimum temperature for developmental rate in the Sharpe-Schoolfield-lkemoto model, and it led to a temperature estimate around 20 degrees C. However, the traditional viewpoint based on the temperature corresponding to the maximal intrinsic rate of increase provides a temperature estimate around 30 degrees C. This study suggests that a low temperature around 20 degrees C might authentically represent the optimal ambient temperature for fitness in terrestrial ectotherms. It implies that thermal biologists who are interested in the effect of temperature on the fitness in terrestrial ectotherms should pay more attention to their performance at low temperature rather than high temperature.

M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Ectothermy in reptiles involves strong environmental temperature dependence to maintain body temperature. High mountains are extreme habitats which, because of their marked temperature decrease with altitude, impose difficulties for reptile thermoregulation, as the number of optimum-temperature days diminish in altitude. We studied the activity patterns of the lizard Psammodromus algirus, which has a wide altitudinal distribution, at six sampling stations that spanned an altitudinal range from 300 to 2500 m asl in Sierra Nevada (SE Iberian Peninsula). We performed censuses of the species during the seasonal and daily activity period, and measured lizard body temperature and environmental temperature in the six sampling plots along the altitude gradient. The body temperature of the lizards remained closely the same even though environmental temperature decreased around 9 C along that gradient. Seasonal activity peaked at the beginning of the activity period in highlands, but in the middle of the season in middle and lowland regions. However, newborns appeared in the field almost at the same time along the altitude gradient. We suggest that the thermoregulatory strategies of the lizards must vary along this altitudinal gradient, permitting lizards to keep their body temperature close to a very similar optimum and thus, develop very similar circa-annual activity patterns.

Another potential agent of selection in the lab is exposure to constant thermal environments. Here, we examined changes in growth, critical thermal maximum (CTmax), and food consumption under constant (25 degrees C) and fluctuating (22-28 degrees C and 19-31 degrees C) conditions in two populations of fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas: one that has been kept in a laboratory setting for over 120 generations (similar to 40 years) and a corresponding wild one. We found that under thermal fluctuations, domesticated fathead minnows grew faster than their wild counterparts, but also exhibited lower thermal tolerance. Food consumption was significantly higher in the lab population under the constant and large fluctuation thermal treatments.

article,Infrared thermal imaging based study of localized cold stress induced thermoregulation in lower limbs: The role of age on the inversion time,"Lahiri, B. B. and Bagavathiappan, S. and Philip, John",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Thermoregulatory control of human body temperature is of paramount importance for normal bodily functions. Exposure of the upper and lower limbs to localized cold stress can cause cold-induced injuries and often lower limbs are more susceptible to damages from cold-induced injuries. In this study, we use infrared thermal imaging to probe localized cold stress induced cutaneous vasoconstriction of lower limbs in 33 healthy subjects. The cold stress is actuated by applying ice to the plantar surfaces of the lower limbs for 180 s and after removal of the cold stress, infrared thermography is utilized to non-invasively monitor the time-dependent variations in vein pixel temperatures on the dorsal surfaces of the stimulated and non-stimulated feet. It is observed that the vein pixel temperature of the stimulated foot showed a non-monotonic variation with time, consisting of an initial decrease and the presence of an inversion time, beyond which temperature is regained. The initial decrease in vein pixel temperature of the stimulated foot is attributed to the reduced blood flow caused by the cold stress induced severe vasoconstriction. Beyond the inversion time, the vein pixel temperature is found to increase due to rewarming of the surrounding skin. Experimental findings indicate that the inversion time linearly increased with the age of the subject, indicating a reduced thermoregulatory efficiency for the aged subjects. This study provides a thermal imaging-based insight into the skin temperature re-distribution during the early stages of blood perfusion in lower limbs, after an exposure to a localized acute cold stress. Statistical analyses reveal that subject height, weight, body-mass index and gender do not influence the inversion time significantly. The experimental findings are important towards rapid evaluation of personnel fitness for deployment in extreme cold environment, treatment of cold-induced injuries and probing of thermoregulatory impairments.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102781,94,NA,NA,102781,Infrared thermography; Localized cold stress; Cutaneous vasoconstriction; Rewarming phase; Thermoregulation; Inversion time

The edaphoclimatic zoning was based on the overlapping of maps that characterize the average annual air temperature obtained by multiple linear regression, annual water deficiency calculated by the Thornthwaite and Matter method (1955) and favorable soil classes to the development of papaya. The results indicated that as regards the edaphoclimatic zoning for the papaya crop it was observed that 71.70\% of the area is classified as apt for its development. In relation to agrometeorological favorability for the occurrence of fungal diseases, there was a favorability of 7.64\% for the development without restrictions of the oidium and a predominance of 64, 56\% of favorability with thermal restriction. For the early blight fungus, it was observed that the zones of favorability without restriction correspond to 11.66\% of the area apt for the papaya cultivation and that 55.13\% of the area has favorability with restriction of humidity. The edaphoclimatic zoning for the papaya crop showed compatibility with the most productive areas of this crop in the state of Espirito Santo. The zoning of thermal favorability for the occurrence of papaya fungal diseases proved to be a valuable tool for studies of plant diseases, allowing the establishment of plans for the allocation of resistant varieties, in order to minimize the risks of loss of crop productivity due to the disease.

One-day-old Arbor Acres (AA) male broilers (n = 100) were acclimated for 3 weeks and then randomly allocated into two groups, normal control (NC) group (22 +/- 1 degrees C, 24 h/day) and HS group (32 +/- 1 degrees C, 10 h/day lasted for 2 weeks). At 35 d of age, intestinal segments (duodenum, jejunum and ileum) and cecal digesta were collected for detection. HS affected intestinal morphology, inducing epithelial cell abscission, inflammatory cell infiltration, and lamina propria edema. Compared with the NC group, HS significantly decreased (P < 0.01) villus height (VH) and the VH-to-crypt depth (CD) ratio (VCR), increased (P < 0.05) CD in the duodenum and ileum, but had no effect on the VH in the jejunum. Moreover, HS induced oxidative stress with antioxidant enzymes activity decreasing (P < 0.05) while malondialdehyde (MDA) content increasing (P < 0.05) in small intestine. Pearson's correlation analysis indicated that MDA content was negatively correlated with VH (P < 0.05). The result of 16S rRNA sequencing showed that HS exposure impacted cecal microbiota alpha diversity (phylogenetic diversity whole-tree index) and beta diversity.

Parabacteroides, Saccharimonas, Romboutsia and Weissella were reduced, while Anaerofustis, Pseudonocardia, Rikenella and Tyzzerella were enriched in heat-stressed broilers.

The deduced protein has 220 amino acids with a signal peptide of 20 amino acids. Expression of mMnSOD was analyzed in hepatopancreas, gills and muscle, where gills had highest expression in normoxic conditions. In addition, shrimp were subjected to high temperature, hypoxia and reoxygenation to analyze the effect on the expression of mMnSOD and SOD activity in mitochondria. High temperature and hypoxia showed a synergistic effect in the up-regulation on expression of mMnSOD in gills and hepatopancreas. Moreover, induction in SOD activity was found in the mitochondrial fraction from gills of normoxia at high temperature, probably due to an overproduction of reactive oxygen species caused by an elevated metabolic rate due to the stress temperature.

These equations were derived for low activity levels (0.8 - 1 met) and mostly in sitting or supine position. This study validates and discusses the prediction of foot SBF during activities of 1 - 3 met in male and females, and the effect on the foot skin temperature prediction (Delta T-skin,T- foot) using the thermophysiological simulation model ThermoSEM. The SBF at the foot was measured for ten male and ten female human subjects at baseline and during three activities (sitting, walking at 1 km/h, preferred walking around 3 km/h). Additional measurements included the energy expenditure, local skin temperatures (T-skin,T- loc), environmental conditions and body composition. Measured, normalized foot SBF is 2-8 times higher than the simulated SBF during walking sessions. Also, SBF increases are significantly higher in females vs. males (preferred walking: 4.8 +/- 1.5 versus 2.7 +/- 1.4, P < 0.05). The quality of Delta T-skin,T- foot using the simulated foot SBF is poor (median deviation is - 4.8 degrees C, maximumum deviation is - 6 degrees C). Using the measured SBF in ThermoSEM results in an improved local skin temperature prediction (new maximum deviation is - 3.3 degrees C). From these data a new SBF model was developed that includes the walking activity level and gender, and improves SBF prediction and Delta T-skin,T- foot of the thermophysiological model.

Amphibious fishes have a variety of strategies, both physiological and/or behavioural, to cope with a broad range of thermal conditions. This study examined the relationship between prolonged (5 weeks) exposure to a range of temperatures (22, 25, 28, or 32 degrees C) on oxygen uptake rate and movement behaviours (i.e., thermoregulation and emergence) in a common amphibious fish, the barred mudskipper (Periophthalmus argentilneatuis). At the highest temperature examined (32 degrees C, approximately 5 degrees C above their summer average temperatures), barred mudskippers exhibited 33.7-97.7\% greater oxygen uptake rates at rest ((M) over dotO(2Rest)), emerged at a higher temperature (CTe; i.e., a modified critical thermal maxima (CTMax) methodology) of 41.3 +/- 0.3 degrees C relative to those maintained at 28, 25, or 22 degrees C. The 32 degrees C-maintained fish also ceased movement activity at the highest holding temperature suggesting that prolonged submergence at elevated temperatures is physiologically and energetically stressful to the individual. Using exhaustive exercise protocols with and without air exposure to simulate a predatory chase, the time to recovery was examined for all individuals. When submerged, mudskippers required 2.5x longer recovery time to return to resting oxygen uptake from exhaustive exercise than those fully emerged in air. Oxygen uptake data revealed that air exposure did not accrue oxygen debt, thereby allowing faster return to resting oxygen consumption rates. If the option to emerge was not available, mudskippers preferentially sought more benign water temperatures (26.7 +/- 2.1 degrees C), resembling those experienced by these fish during the Austral autumn, regardless of prolonged exposure higher or lower temperatures. These results add to our understanding of the strategies that amphibious fishes may use to mitigate extra costs associated with living in warm waters, and could be the key to understanding how such species will cope with increasing temperatures in the future.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.09.005,78,NA,65-72,NA,Temperature preference; Behaviour; Movement; Oxygen consumption; Metabolism; Emergence
article,Effects of pre-exercise sucrose ingestion on thermoregulatory responses to near-maximal 5-km running,"Wilson, Patrick B.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Research has shown that carbohydrate consumption can increase body temperature at rest and, in some cases, during exercise. Most exercise studies, however, haven't matched exercise intensity between carbohydrate and placebo conditions. The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was to examine whether pre-exercise carbohydrate consumption independently accelerates the usual temperature rise with intense exercise. Twenty-eight runners self-reported 5-km performance (16-23 min) and were randomized, using a matched-pairs design, to 750 ml water containing 100 g sucrose or 0.8 g aspartame. Beverages were consumed 60 min before running at 93\% of maximum 5-km speed in temperate conditions. Gastrointestinal temperature, Thermal Sensation Scale (TSS) and Feeling Scale (FS) were recorded before ingestion, every 10 min during 60 min of rest, and every 1-km during the 5-km run. Rating of Perceived Exertion was recorded every 1-km. Independent samples t-tests and two-way mixed ANOVAs with repeated measures assessed whether there were baseline differences or treatment effects. Gastrointestinal temperature didn't differ between carbohydrate (38.7 +/- 0.4 degrees C) and placebo (38.6 +/- 0.4 degrees C) by the end of the 5-km (p = 0.49). No group x time interactions or main group effects were found, except for a modest interaction for TSS (F = 2.1, p = 0.02, partial eta(2 )= 0.075). Time effects were found for all outcomes, with temperature, TSS, and RPE increasing, and FS decreasing, during the run. Ingesting 100 g of sucrose prior to intense running lasting < 25 min didn't influence gastrointestinal temperature and therefore doesn't likely impact on the risk of heat illness.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.08.006,77,NA,62-66,NA,Carbohydrate; Endurance exercise; Running; Sport nutrition; Thermoregulation
article,Heat death in poikilotherms: Is there a common cause?,"Bowler, Ken",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The primary aim of this contribution is to make the case for membrane impairment as the outcome of the exposure of poikilotherms to damaging high temperatures that result in organism heat death. The paper emphasises that heat death points are not fixed but are altered by acclimation, acclimatization, heat shock and hardening. The definition of these terms is revisited as there is confusion in their usage in the literature. That poikilotherm heat death points depend on acclimation temperature is one of the most demonstrated outcomes. However, fewer studies have been made into the underlying cause(s) of heat death. Most studies have clearly shown that membrane function is impaired early in heat treatment, leading to knock-on effects at the physiological level. As heat death points are subject to acclimation status, then what is changed by acclimation must be directly related to what fails in heat death. Many comparative studies have shown that acclimation in a variety of species changes the phospholipid (PL) profile of membranes, such that cold acclimation results in an increase in the fluidity of membrane lipids. This increase in membrane fluidity would also lower the heat death point as membrane damage would occur at a lower temperature. This is consistent with the premise that membrane structure/function is changed by acclimation and that this is the site of the primary lesion in heat death. Breakdown in cellular homeostasis will have consequences at the physiological level that will depend on the life style of the organism. I therefore propose that heat death is a cellular membrane event common to poikilotherms.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.06.007,76,NA,77-79,NA,NA
article,Arthropods life cycle and temperature: Beyond isomorphy hypothesis,"Bonato, Olivier and Chadoeuf, Joel",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In poikilotherms, developmental time and adult lifespan are biological traits driven by temperature although their underlying physiological mechanisms differ. The developmental theory of ageing predicts a positive correlation between these two traits without confirming a genetic or causal relationship. The developmental rate isomorphy hypothesis established that the proportionality in the duration of each pre-imaginal stage with respect to total developmental time does not vary with temperature. This may have important evolutionary implications. We conducted an analysis with arthropods of agronomic interest to study if the hypothesis could be extended to the total lifespan of poikilotherms, including adult lifespan. We showed that isomorphy could be acceptable for a global description of this relationship. However a general model of power law type is more appropriate for characterizing the relationship between developmental time and adult lifespan. In this model, the shape of the curve is a constant characteristic, but the parameters that control it depend on the functional type of the arthropod (phytophagous, predator or parasitoid). Presumably this power law could be extended to all arthropods of agricultural interest, and more generally to all arthropod.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.05.004,75,NA,1-6,NA,Ageing; Developmental constraints; Life-history traits; Thermal requirements; Power law
article,Inter-individual variation in the adaptive response to heat acclimation,"Corbett, Jo and Rendell, Rebecca A. and Massey, Heather C. and Costello, Joseph T. and Tipton, Michael J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Aim: To investigate inter-individual variance in adaptive responses to heat acclimation (HA). Methods: 17 males (VO2max = 58.8(8.4) mL.kg(-1).min(-1)) undertook 10-days (exercise + heat-stress {[}40 degrees C, 50\% RH]) HA. Adaptation was assessed by heat stress tests (HST; 60-minutes cycling, 35\% peak power output) pre- and post-HA. Results: Inter-individual variability was evident in adaptive responses e.g. mean(range) reduction in end-exercise T-re = - 0.70(-0.20 to -1.32) degrees C, but, in the main, the variance in adaptation was unrelated across indices (thermal, sudomotor, cardiovascular, haematological), indicating independence between adaptation indices. Variance in adaptive responses was not correlated with aerobic capacity, history of previous HA, or the accrued thermal-dose. Some responses to the initial HST were related to the subsequent adaptations e.g. Delta(T) over bar (sk) during the initial HST and the reduction in the within HST Delta T-re, after HA (r = -0.676), but responses to the initial HST may also have been influenced by HST design e.g. Delta T-re, correlated with metabolic heat production (r = 0.609). Metabolic heat production also correlated with the reduction in the within HST Delta T-re after HA (r = -0.514). Summary: HA indices are mainly independent; `low', or `high', responders on one index do not necessarily demonstrate similar response across other indices. Variance in HA responses was not related to aerobic capacity, previous HA, or thermal-dose. Thermo-physiological responses to a HST might identify individuals who will benefit from HA. However, some initial responses are influenced by HST design, which may also affect the scope for demonstrating adaption. Conclusion: Variance in the HA response remains largely unaccounted for and future studies should identify factors contributing to this variance.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.03.002,74,NA,29-36,NA,Acclimatization; Adaptation; Thermal; Responders; Non-responders
article,Comparative thermoregulation between different species of dung beetles (Coleoptera: Geotrupinae),"Gallego, Belen and Verdu, Jose R. and Lobo, Jorge M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Insects can use thermoregulation to keep their body temperatures within a certain range in response to thermal stress situations. The mechanisms to regulate internal temperature depend on whether species are endothermic or ectothermic species, i.e., if the heat source is internal and/or external. In this study, the thermal stress response due to excess heat was examined in individuals belonging to different species of the Geotrupinae subfamily by using a standardized protocol based on infrared thermography. All the measured heat stress variables allow discrimination among the considered species to a greater or lesser extent. The body heating rate in the heat stress range, the critical thermal maximum and the stress start temperature were the most important variables in discriminating between apterous and winged individuals (R-2 = 52.5\%, 51.1\% and 50.0\%, respectively). Examining the degree of association between the physiological similarity of individuals and some species traits suggest that flying capability and daily activity are related with different thermal responses. Based on the obtained results, the Geotrupinae subfamily can be divided into three ecophysiological groups: good, medium and non-thermoregulators. Within these groups, apterism appears mainly in those species with the ability to actively decrease their body temperature. Our results indicate that this ability may be partially due to the management of water loss related with evaporative cooling.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.03.009,74,NA,84-91,NA,Heat thermal stress; Infrared thermography; Thermoregulation ability; Overheating; Thermal tolerance
article,The effect of acclimation on heat tolerance of <i>Lasioderma serricorne</i> (Fabricius) (Coleoptera: Anobiidae),"Li, Meng and Li, Xiao-Juan and Lu, Jian-Hua and Huo, Ming-Fei",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Lasioderma serricorne (Fabricius) (Coleoptera: Anobiidae) is an important economic insect of various stored products worldwide. With the restricted use of methyl bromide and the increasing negative effects of repeated use of phosphine fumigation, heat treatment becomes the main approach to control stored-product insects. We investigated effect of the acclimation to sublethal high temperature of 36 degrees C and 42 degrees C for different times on heat tolerance of L. serricorne adults, pupae, larvae, and eggs to lethal high temperature of 50 degrees C in laboratory. The acclimation of L. serricorne pupae, larvae, and eggs, but not adults, to 36 degrees C improved their survival when exposed to lethal high temperature of 50 degrees C. The acclimation of all life stages of L. serricorne to 42 degrees C significantly improved their survival when exposed to 50 degrees C. For eggs, larvae, and adults, the protective effectiveness of acclimation to 42 degrees C was much more profound than that of to 36 degrees C. LT50 and LT90 of all life stages increased with increasing acclimation time to 42 degrees C in general. The LT50 of L serricorne adults, pupae, larvae, and eggs acclimation to 42 degrees C for 20 h were 2.2, 2.2, 3.4, and 4.8 times higher than that of insects without acclimation, respectively. The results suggest that acclimation to sublethal high temperatures can significantly improve the heat tolerance of L. serricorne by the means of increasing their survival when confronting lethal high temperatures. In the face of global warming, the protective effects induced by acclimation to sublethal high temperatures should be fully considered when design or apply heat treatment to control L. serricorne.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.11.007,71,NA,153-157,NA,Lasioderma serricorne; Sublethal high temperature; Acclimation; Heat tolerance; Mortality
article,Dietary supplementation of enzymatically treated <i>Artemisia annua</i> could alleviate the intestinal inflammatory response in heat-stressed broilers,"Song, Zhihua and Cheng, Kang and Zhang, Lili and Wang, Tian",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of enzymatically treated Artemisia annua (EA) on the intestinal inflammatory response of heat-stressed broilers. A total of 144 male Arbor Acres broilers aged 21 days were randomly divided into 3 groups with 6 replicates per group and 8 broilers in each replicate. The 3 treatment groups were as follows: the control group, in which broiler chickens were raised at 22 +/- 1 degrees C and fed basal diets, the heat stress (HS) and HS-EA groups, in which broiler chickens were raised at 34 +/- 1 degrees C for 8 h (0900-1700 h) and 22 +/- 1 degrees C for 16 h, and fed basal diets supplemented with 0 or 1 g/kg EA, respectively. From 22 to 41 days, the heat treatment lasted for 20 consecutive days. Compared with the control group, HS increased the activity of plasma diamine oxidase (P < 0.05) and the concentration of intestinal interleuldn-1 beta, and up-regulated (P < 0.05) the mRNA expression of intestinal interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, interferon-gamma, toll-like receptor 4 and heat shock protein 70, down-regulated (P < 0.05) jejunal zonula occludens-1 and ileal occluding mRNA abundances and intestinal interleukin-10 at both protein and transcriptional levels. However, EA treatment significantly decreased (P < 0.05) plasma diamine oxidase activity, the mRNA expression of heat shock protein 70, toll-like receptor 4, interleukin-6, interleukin-1 beta and interferon-gamma in intestine of heat-stressed broilers, whereas upregulated (P < 0.05) the mRNA expression of ileal occluding, jejunal zonula occludens-1 and occluding. In addition, both protein and transcriptional levels of interleukin-10 in jejunum and ileum were increased (P < 0.05) by EA treatment in the HS group. In conclusion, dietary EA supplementation could alleviate the intestinal inflammatory response, and improve the intestinal barrier function in broilers during the heat stress period.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.07.015,69,NA,184-190,NA,Enzymatically treated Artemisia annua; Inflammatory response; Intestine; Heat stress; Broilers
