article,Support vector machine based methodology for classification of thermal images pertaining to breast cancer,"Periyasamy, Shobhana and Prakasarao, Aruna and Menaka, M. and Venkatraman, B. and Jayashree, M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Breast cancer has been and continues to be a cause of major health concern for women. It is more prevalent in old age, but its incidence has increased in recent years in groups below 50 years old, as in India. According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) 2020, 50\% of all the cases are in the age group of 25-50 where the numbers are staggering and constantly rising. The increase in incidence over the years indicates an urging need for innovative approaches to enhance breast cancer detection early. Thermography is non-contact imaging modalities and has potential to detect breast cancer at an early stage. Though thermography has capable of detecting breast cancer early, the challenge lies in the interpretation of the breast thermograms with respect to features and subsequent analysis. The present work discusses image acquisition, image processing related pre-processing, segmentation, and feature extraction. The extracted features were analyzed using ANOVA (Anal-ysis of variance) statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were done in order to find the appropriate feature on the whole and quadrant breast. Statistical analysis results clearly reveal existence of thermal symmetry for the healthy subjects (p value > .05) in both whole and quadrant breast regions. In the case of abnormal subjects, whole breast analyses revealed the significance (p value < .05) for features like mean, variance, standard de-viation, kurtosis, skewness, entropy, energy, homogeneity and contrast whereas upper outer quadrant analyses showed significance for all above features except contrast. The well correlated features of upper outer quadrant and whole breast were given as input for the Support Vector Machine - Radial Basis Function (SVM - RBF) classifier with grid search method. The results revealed that whole breast analysis has achieved 92.86\% accuracy and upper outer quadrant breast analysis has achieved 85.71\% accuracy. The results clearly indicate the involvement of upper outer quadrant and whole breast in early detection of breast cancer using thermal imaging.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103337,110,NA,NA,103337,Breast cancer; Grid search method; Quadrant analysis; SVM classifier; Thermography
article,Skin temperature response to thermal stimulus in patients with hyperhidrosis: A comparative study,"Carvalho, Fatima and Magalhaes, Carolina and Fernandez-Llimos, Fernando and Mendes, Joaquim and Goncalves, Jorge",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"ABS TRACT Primary hyperhidrosis (HH), the excessive sweating exceeding physiological demand, has been associated to a complex dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system which may explain the disfunction in sweating but may also cause unrevealed alterations in skin blood flow regulation. In fact, HH patients present a sympathetic over-function with less reflex bradycardia in response to the Valsalva maneuver and higher sympathetic skin re-sponses. We aimed to identify response patterns to room thermal stimulus in HH patients compared to a control group in order to investigate putative differences in blood flow assuming that skin temperature in glabrous (non-hairy) areas reflect the sympathetic tone in arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs). Infrared thermography images were obtained from a cohort of patients diagnosed with HH, followed at a hospital pediatric surgical department and to a sex-and age-matched control group of patients admitted for other surgical procedures. With the par-ticipants in Fowler's position, a set of 3 images were captured simultaneously and 44 regions of interest were analyzed, distributed on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, axilla, and inner canthus. After an acclima-tization period at 20 ?C, the room temperature was increased to 24, 28 and 32 ?C to obtain similar sets of thermograms. A total of 37 patients with HH and 16 participants in the control group were included in the study. At baseline (20 ?C), body core temperature (measured in the inner canthus) was significantly higher in the HH patients compared to the controls (p = 0.019 and p = 0.003 in right and left inner canthi, respectively), without any significant differences in the other thermograms. When room temperature was increased, differences in core temperature disappeared, while differences appeared in axilla and palms of the hands with HH patients pre-senting significantly lower temperature at the three thermal stimulus stages. Patients with HH presented a lower thermoregulatory response when submitted to room temperature increase, which may reflect a vasomotor sympathetic over-function in AVAs.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103322,109,NA,NA,103322,Hyperhidrosis; Skin temperature; Thermography; Thermoregulatory response
article,Numerical estimation of temperature response with step heating of a multi-layer skin under the generalized boundary condition,"Chaudhary, Rajneesh Kumar and Chaurasiya, Vikas and Singh, Jitendra",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In this article, we discussed a one-dimensional bioheat transfer mathematical model that describes the process of temperature distribution in tissue for the multi-layer skin under the step heating generalized boundary condition. The finite difference scheme is used to estimate the temperature profile along with time and distance. We discussed the stability of the numerical scheme and also validated the accuracy of the numerical code by comparing the present results with the previous reference results. To remove heat from the skin is considered by the surface temperature, heat flux, and ambient temperature to be zero with the help of the unit step like function. Then, we observed that the skin temperature in the second kind boundary condition was slowly decreasing over time as compared to the first and third kind boundary conditions. The temperature or heat flux at the skin surface is assumed to be high then there is negligible effect of the blood perfusion rate on the temperature response over a short time period and the effect of blood perfusion rate is visible when the time duration is long. Effect of blood perfusion rate, heating and after removal of heating, water diffusion, and generalized boundary condition for the analysis of the behavior of temperature response in multi-layer skin are discussed in detail and the results obtained are presented graphically.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103278,108,NA,NA,103278,Multi-layer skin; Finite difference scheme; Stability analysis; Interface condition; Generalized boundary condition; Blood perfusion rate

N. and Ruiz, Jonatan R.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Purpose: Brown adipose tissue (BAT) increases metabolic heat production in response to cold exposure. Body size and composition are involved in the human cold response, yet the influence of BAT herein have not fully been explored. Here, we aimed to study the association of the cold-induced shivering threshold time with body composition, BAT, the perception of shivering and skin temperature in young adults. Methods: 110 young healthy adults (81 females; age = 21.7 +/- 2.1 years, BMI = 24.2 +/- 4.3 kg/m2) underwent 2 h of individualized cooling, followed by the quantification of BAT using a18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ({[}18F]FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan. Body mass index (BMI), lean mass, fat mass and body surface area (BSA) were also measured. Shivering threshold time was defined as the time until shivering occurred using an individualized cooling protocol. Results: The shivering threshold time was on average 116.1 min for males and 125.8 min for females, and was positively associated to BMI (beta = 3.106; R2 = 0.141; p = 0.001), lean mass (beta = 2.295; R2 = 0.128; p = 0.001) and fat mass (beta = 1.492; R2 = 0.121; p = 0.001) in females, but not in males (all p >= 0.409). The shivering threshold time was positively associated with BSA in males (p = 0.047) and females (p = 0.001), but it was not associated with BAT volume or {[}18F]FDG uptake nor with the perception of shivering and skin temperature perception in both sexes. Conclusion: The shivering threshold time is positively associated with whole-body adiposity and lean mass in females, but not in males. The shivering threshold time was positively associated with BSA, but no association was observed with BAT nor with the perception of shivering or skin temperature. Future research should consider the influence of body composition when applying cooling protocols among individuals with different phenotypical features.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103277,108,NA,NA,103277,brown fat; Cold perception; Shivering time; Thermogenesis

The population's persistence depends on the maintenance of essential activities, which is notably driven by phenotypic adaptation to local environments. Metabolic rate - that increases with temperature in ectotherms is a key physiological proxy for the energy available to fuel individuals' activities. Cold-adapted ectotherms can exhibit a higher resting metabolism than warm-adapted ones to maintain functionality at higher elevations or latitudes, known as the metabolic cold-adaptation hypothesis. How climate change will affect metabolism in species inhabiting contrasting climates (cold or warm) is still a debate. Therefore, it is of high interest to assess the pace of metabolic responses to global warming among populations adapted to highly different baseline climatic conditions. Here, we conducted a physiological experiment in the endemic Pyrenean brook newt (Calotriton asper). We measured a proxy of standard metabolic rate (SMR) along a temperature gradient in individuals sampled among 6 populations located from 550 to 2189 m a.s.l. We demonstrated that SMR increased with temperature, but significantly diverged depending on populations' origins. The baseline and the slope of the relationship between SMR and temperature were both higher for high-elevation populations than for low elevation populations. We discussed the stronger metabolic response observed in high-elevation populations suggesting a drop of performance in essential life activities for these individuals under current climate change. With the increase of metabolism as the climate warms, the metabolic-cold adaptation strategy selected in the past could compromise the sustainability of cold-adapted populations if short-term evolutionary responses do not allow to offset this evolutionary legacy.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103166,103,NA,NA,103166,Metabolic rate; Temperature; Elevation; Ectotherms
article,"Effective accumulative temperature affects gonadal maturation by controlling expression of GnRH, GnRH receptor, serotonin receptor and APGWamide gene in Pacific abalone, <i>Haliotis discus hannai</i> during broodstock conditioning in hatcheries","Sukhan, Zahid Parvez and Cho, Yusin and Sharker, Md. Rajib and Hossen, Shaharior and Rha, Sung-Ju and Kho, Kang Hee",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Water temperature is a crucial environmental factor that influences reproductive function of abalone. Broodstock conditioning exposed to effective accumulative temperature (EAT) is a common practice in abalone hatcheries. To understand the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of gonadal maturation and reproduction of Haliotis discus hannai exposed to EAT and induced spawning period, changes in expression of neuroendocrine genes encoding two gonadotropin releasing hormone (Hdh-GnRH, GnRH-like peptide), GnRH receptor (HdhGnRH-R), serotonin receptor (5-HTHdh) and Hdh-APGWamide in neural ganglia and gonadal tissues were examined. Gonadosomatic index (GSI) was significantly increased with increasing EAT degrees C-days. Expression levels of Hdh-GnRH, GnRH-like peptide, HdhGnRH-R, 5-HTHdh and Hdh-APGWamide mRNA were significantly increased with increasing EAT degrees C-days in ganglion (where the gene synthesized) and gonadal tissues. The significant increase in mRNA expression of each examined gene started from EAT 500 to 750 degrees C-days, reached an initial peak at 1000 degrees C-days, suggesting gonadal maturation started from the onset of EAT and slowly continued until 750 degrees C-days, then at 1000 degrees C-days reached to initial peak developmental period. The maturation reached to spawning state at 1000 degrees C-days and peaked at 1500 degrees C-days. Hdh-GnRH showed significantly higher mRNA expression in pleuropedal ganglion and branchial ganglion, whereas GnRH like peptide showed higher expression in cerebral ganglion, and HdhGnRH-R, 5-HTHdh and Hdh-APGWamide showed higher expression in pleuropedal ganglion. All genes were expressed higher at higher EAT degrees C-days. During induced spawning period, higher mRNA expression of examined genes was observed at the time of spawning; however, a sharp decrease occurred after spawning, suggesting that these genes are involved in spawning activities. Taken together, these results indicate that an increase of EAT degrees C-days can increase expression of neuroendocrine genes and enhance gonadal maturation. Besides all these genes are involved in the process of spawning induction, and increase of GSI has a positive correlation with the increase of gene expression.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103037,100,NA,NA,103037,EAT; Neuroendocrine gene; Gene expression; Gonadal development; Haliotis discus hannai
article,Color lightness of velvet ants (Hymenoptera: Mutillidae) follows an environmental gradient,"Lopez, Vinicius Marques and Tosta, Thaina Aparecida Azevedo and da Silva, Guilherme Gonzaga and Bartholomay, Pedro Reck and Williams, Kevin Andrew and Guillermo-Ferreira, Rhainer",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Color traits are highly influenced by environmental conditions along the distributional range of many species. Studies on the variation of animal coloration across different geographic gradients are, therefore, fundamental for a better understanding of the ecological and evolutionary processes that shape color variation. Here, we address whether color lightness in velvet ants (Hymenoptera: Mutillidae) responds to latitudinal gradients and bioclimatic variations, testing three ecogeographic rules: The Thermal melanism hypothesis; the Photoprotection hypothesis; and Gloger's rule. We test these hypotheses across the New World. We used photographs of 482 specimens (n = 142 species) of female mutillid wasps and extracted data on color lightness (V). We analyzed whether variation in color is determined by bioclimatic factors, using Phylogenetic Generalized Least Square analysis. Our explanatory variables were temperature, ultraviolet radiation, humidity, and forest indicators. Our results were consistent with the Photoprotection hypothesis and Gloger's rule. Species with darker coloration occupied habitats with more vegetation, higher humidity, and UV-B radiation. However, our results refute one of the initial hypotheses suggesting that mutillids do not respond to the predictions of the Thermal melanism hypothesis. The results presented here provide the first evidence that abiotic components of the environment can act as ecological filters and as selective forces driving the body coloration of velvet ants. Finally, we suggest that studies using animals with melanin-based colors as a model for mimetic and aposematic coloration hypotheses consider that this coloration may also be under the influence of climatic factors and not only predators.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103030,100,NA,NA,103030,Batesian; Behavior; Biogeography; Climate change; Mullerian; Parasitoid
article,"The influences of Tylosine and licorice dietary supplementation in terms of the productive performance, serum parameters, egg yolk lipid profile, antioxidant and immunity status of laying Japanese quail under heat stress condition","Dosoky, Waleed M. and Zeweil, Hassan S. and Ahmed, Mohamed H. and Zahran, Soliman M. and Ali, Abdallah M. and Abdelsalam, Nader R. and Naiel, Mohammed A. E.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"By reducing feed consumption, animals suffering from heat stress prefer to reduce their heat output. Heat exposure has also contributed to major adverse effects on the productive and reproductive performance of quails. Therefore, this research was intended to estimate the preventive function of licorice as a safe feed additive against the negative effects caused by heat stress conditions on laying quail productivity. A total number of 180 Japanese quail birds (120 females and 60 males), nine-weeks old were divided into five groups. Each group contained 36 birds in four replicates (nine birds) with completely randomized design. The dietary treatments were a basal diet without supplementation as control (T-1), basal diet + 100 mg Tylosine kg(-1) diet (T-2), (T-3), (T-4) and (T-5) fed basal diet + 250, 500 and 1000 mg licorice kg(-1) diet, in respect. The results indicated that dietary supplementation with different feed additives had no significant effects on egg-laying rate, egg number, average egg weight, egg mass and feed conversion ratio compared with control. Also, different treatments showed no significant variations on serum IgG, total protein, globulin, albumin, creatinine, ALT and TAC and caused significant (P <= 0.05) improvement in IgM, AST, ALP, uric acid and MDA concentrations as compared to the control. Results indicated that total serum lipids, triglycerides, total cholesterol and LDL concentrations were significantly decreased due to different feed additives. However, HDL concentrations and HDL/LDL ratios were markedly increased by the other treatments than the control group. In addition, yolk total lipids were significantly (P <= 0.001) decreased with increasing licorice root powder's dietary levels compared with the control group. Also, a significant (P <= 0.01) reduction in egg yolk cholesterol level was observed in the group fed with 500 mg licorice compared to other treatments. In conclusion, fortified laying quail diets with licorice powder could be a useful strategy to alleviate adverse effects induced by heat stress as alternative to antibiotics on laying Japanese quail.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103015,99,NA,NA,103015,Quail; Licorice; Laying performance; Lipid profile; Antioxidant; Immunity

Invasive reptiles, which have temperature-dependent physiology, are expected to be greatly impacted by climate warming, though data supporting this is limited. We investigated the potential impact of a warmer climate on an invasive lizard, Eutropis multifasciata, in Taiwan. A mechanistic model, NicheMapR, was used to simulate the maximum activity time available at three elevations, with varying forest densities, under the current climate and a warmer scenario. The results show that climate warming will provide this species more time for activity in the currently occupied lowland region but not in the mountain areas, which are covered with dense forests. However, if the landscape becomes more open in mountain areas, it will become more suitable for this species and may enable an expansion upslope. Our results show that climate warming has a positive impact on this species, and that landscape's characteristics profoundly modulate its impact and the possibilities for elevational expansion in the future.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102948,98,NA,NA,102948,Elevational distribution; Temperature; Cold tolerance; Biophysical modelling; Eutropis multifasciata

Because the availability of suitable thermal resources is limited and more variable at high-elevation environments than at lower elevations, we expect high -elevation lizards to be constrained in their thermoregulation relative to lizards at lower elevations by the fewer available thermal resources to reach optimal temperatures (colder environment). We studied the thermal biology of an endemic and Critically Endangered lizard, Liolaemus aparicioi, to assess its thermal responses along a 1000 m elevational gradient in La Paz Valley from May to August of 2015 (dry season). We took field body and microhabitat temperatures at capture sites (substrate and air above ground), and body size (snout-vent length and mass) of individuals at Taypichullo (3000 m asl), Gran Jardin de la Revoluci ` on Municipal Park (3500 m asl), and Taucachi (4000 m asl) localities. Operative temperatures were taken from calibrated models deployed in different available microhabitats. Preferred temperatures and thermal tolerance limits were determined in lab-oratory settings for lizards from each locality. Field body, microhabitat, and operative temperatures decreased with increasing elevation and differed between sexes. Lizards at the high elevation locality had the lowest thermoregulatory efficiency as compared with the mid and lower elevation localities. In laboratory measure-ments, while the preferred temperatures varied between sexes, pooled preferred temperatures and thermal tolerances were similar in all localities. Although thermal resources at high elevation can limit thermoregulatory possibilities in L. aparicioi, behavioral microhabitat use, time allocated to thermoregulation, and physiological adjustments seem to be possible strategies to counteract thermal costs along elevational gradients.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102940,99,NA,NA,102940,Elevation; Lizards; Thermal tolerance limits; Thermoregulatory efficiency
article,Short- and long-term dynamics of the physiological and behavioral response to heat stress and thymol supplementation in Japanese quail,"Emilia Fernandez, Maria and Carla Labaque, Maria and Orso, Gabriel and Hector Marin, Raul and Melissa Kembro, Jackelyn",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Organisms have evolved endogenous timing systems that enable them to predict temporal changes and to coordinate complex internal processes. However, temporal dynamics of biological responses are most often ignored in fields such as dietary supplementation of farm animals exposed to artificial environmental challenges. Herein, we hypothesized that the potential for thymol (2-isopropyl-5-methylphenol) to alleviate physiological and behavioral consequences of heat stress is time-dependent on both long-term (i.e. weeks) and short-term (i.e. within day) time scales. First, during 3-weeks adult female Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) were exposed daily to 9h of increased environmental temperature (34.2 +/- 0.1 degrees C). Controls remained at standard temperatures (23.6 +/- 0.1 degrees C). Simultaneously, half received thymol dietary supplementation and the other half a control basal diet. On day 4, both thymol and heat stress decreased body weight and feed intake respect to controls (basal, standard temperature). After three weeks, feed intake recovered for thymol groups. Therefore, we performed a second experiment focused on the critical first week of treatment, sampling variables three times a day. The beneficial effects of thymol supplementation were mainly observed during the morning, including prevention of high respiratory rates and reduction in the weight of droppings induced by heat stress, and increased walking under both temperatures. In summary, thymol's potential for alleviating heat stress consequences is timedependent, and can be conceived as an emergent property resulting from the complex interplay between the dynamics of the biological response to thymol and heat stress. Findings highlight the importance of considering time-related factors when developing supplementation protocols to mitigate environmental challenges.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102876,97,NA,NA,102876,Poultry; Environmental temperature; Dietary supplementation; Temporal dynamics; Heat stress; Thymol

article,Thermoregulation and heat exchange in ospreys<i> (Pandion</i><i> haliaetus)</i>,"Rogalla, Svana and Shawkey, Matthew D. and Vanthournout, Bram and D'Alba, Liliana",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The osprey (Pandion haliaetus) is a cosmopolitan and long-distant migrant, found at all thermal extremes ranging from polar to tropical climates. Since ospreys may have an unusually flexible thermal physiology due to their migration over, and use of, a wide range of habitats, they represent an interesting study system to explore thermoregulatory adaptations in a raptor. In this study, we investigated the efficiency of heat exchange between body and environment in ospreys using micro-computed tomography (?-CT), infrared thermography and behavioral observations. ?-CT revealed that the osprey bill has its largest potential for heat exchange at the proximal bill region, where arteries are situated most closely under the surface. However, thermal images of 10 juvenile ospreys showed that the bill contributes to only 0.3\% of the bird?s total heat exchange. The long legs and protruding claws played a more prominent role as heat dissipation areas with a contribution of 6\% and 7\%, respectively. Operative thresholds, i.e. the ambient temperature below which heat is lost, were high (>38.5 ?C) in these body parts. However, we found no indication of active regulation of heat exchange. Instead we observed multiple behavioral adaptations starting at relatively low ambient temperatures. At 26.3 ?C ospreys had a 50\% probability of showing panting behavior and above 27.9 ?C they additionally spread their wings to enable heat dissipation from the less insulated ventral side. The thermal images revealed that at an ambient temperature of 32.1 ?C ospreys had a 50\% probability of developing a >2 ?C and up to 7.5 ?C colder stripe on the head, which was likely caused by cutaneous evaporation. Our observations suggest that ospreys more strongly rely on behavioral mechanisms than on active thermal windows to cope with heat stress. This study not only improves our understanding of the role of different body parts in ospreys? total heat exchange with the environment but further provides an insight about additional adaptations of this raptor to cope with heat stress.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102857,96,NA,NA,102857,Bill tomography; Thermography; Heat exchange; Operative temperature; Behavioral thermoregulation; Heat stress; Pandion haliaetus
article,"Radiated temperature from thermal imaging is related to feed consumption, growth rate and feed efficiency in grower pigs","Cook, Nigel and Chabot, Brady and Liu, Tong and Froehlich, Denise and Basarab, John and Juarez, Manuel",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Individual feed consumption and animal weight were continuously recorded in grower pigs using an automated feeding system. Infrared images were recorded each time a pig entered the feeding system and infrared thermography provided radiated thermal measurements of the dorsal surface of each animal. Feed was withdrawn and the animals fasted for a period of 24 h three times during the growth of the animals at body weights of approximately 35, 65 and 105 kg. There was a significant reduction of 0.28 degrees C in the maximum surface temperature (Tmax), and 0.48 degrees C in the average surface temperature (Tmean) during the periods of fasting. Maximum and average pig temperatures exhibited negative correlations to feed consumption and growth variables. There were negative correlations of residual feed intake (RFI) to Tmax and Tmean radiated temperatures. There were positive correlations of residual gain (RG) and residual intake and gain (RIG) with Tmax and Tmean. The Tmax and Tmean temperature responses to fasting were negatively associated with feed consumption and growth variables. Absolute temperature and temperature response variables were positively associated with RFI and negatively associated with residual intake and gain (RIG).

Specifically, growth performance, skeletal bone characteristics, skeletal muscles size, intestinal villus-crypt structure, intestinal bacteria, growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), cholesterol, and glucose. A total of 1200 one day old Ross 308 male broilers were randomly distributed into 4 treatments, with 12 replicates per treatment and 25 birds per replicate. A 2 x 2 factorial arrangement was used; the main factors were environmental temperature (thermoneutral or heat stress) and diet (control or control + B. subtilis; 3 x 10(7) cfu/kg of feed). From d 22 to 35 of age, birds were either exposed to thermoneutral conditions (21 degrees C) or chronic heat stress (30 degrees C). During the same period, each group was divided into 2 subgroups and fed either the control diet or the B. subtilis supplemented diet. The results demonstrated that B. subtilis had positive effects (P < 0.05) on the body weight gain, feed conversion ratio, villus height, crypt depth, villus surface area, absorptive epithelial cell area and viable counts of intestinal beneficial bacteria. B. subtilis increased (P < 0.05) serum GH, IGF-1 and maintain normal levels of cholesterol and glucose under heat stress conditions.

This is particularly relevant for organisms restricted to high elevations because they are adapted to cold temperatures and low oxygen availability. Therefore, evaluating trait plasticity of mountain specialists is fundamental to understand their vulnerability to environmental change. We transplanted mountain lizards, Iberolacerta cyreni, 800 m downhill to evaluate the plastic response in body condition, thermoregulation traits, haemoglobin level, and haemoparasite load. Initial measurements of body mass, total haemoglobin concentration ({[}Hb]), hematic parasite intensities, dorsal luminance, and thermoregulatory behaviour were resampled after two and four weeks of acclimation. We also tested whether an anti-parasitic drug reduced haemoparasite intensity. After only two weeks of acclimation to a lower elevation, lizards decreased 42\% in {[}Hb], had 17\% less parasite intensities, increased body condition by 25\%, and raised by similar to 3\% their mean preferred temperatures and their voluntary thermal maximum. The anti-parasitic treatment had no significant effect on the intensity of hematic parasites, but our results suggest that negative effects of haemoparasites on {[}Hb] are relaxed at lower elevation. The rapid plastic changes observed in thermal preferences, body condition, {[}Hb], and parasite intensity of I. cyreni demonstrate a potential plastic response of a mountain specialist. This may be adaptive under the climatic extremes typical of mountain habitats. However, there is uncertainty in whether the observed plasticity can also help overcome long term environmental changes.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102656,92,NA,NA,102656,Conservation; Ectotherm; Parasites; Phenotypic plasticity; Physiology

Flexible thermoregulatory behavior might be a plausible mechanism to mitigate the effects of extreme temperatures. We experimentally evaluated thermoregulatory behavior in the bunchgrass lizard, Sceloporus aeneus, at three different environmental temperatures (25, 35 and 45 degrees C) both with and without a thermal refuge. We recorded themoregulatory behaviors (body posture and movement between hot and cold patches) and compared individual lizards across all experimental temperature and shelter combinations. Behavioral thermoregulation in S. aeneus was characterized by the expression of five body postures, whose frequencies varied based on environmental temperature and microthermal conditions. Behavioral responses allowed lizards to maintain a mean body temperature <40 degrees C, the critical thermal maximum for temperate species, even at extreme environmental temperatures (45 degrees C). Although S. aeneus express an array of behavioral postures that provide an effective mechanism to cope with elevating temperatures, the presence of a thermal refuge was important to better achieve this. Together, our study offers a novel method to evaluate microhabitat preference that encompasses both behavioral observations and time-space analysis based on the ambient thermal distribution, a consideration that can aid in the formulation of more accurate predictions on ectotherm vulnerability related to increasing global environmental temperatures.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102572,89,NA,NA,102572,Ectotherms; Global warming; Environmental temperature; Flexibility; Heterogeneous environment
article,Latitudinal comparison of the thermal biology in the endemic lizard <i>Liolaemus multimaculatus</i>,"Anibal Stellatelli, Oscar and Vega, Laura E. and Block, Carolina and Rocca, Camila and Juan Bellagamba, Patricio and Benjamin Cruz, Felix",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Thermoregulation in ectotherms may be modulated by climatic variability across geographic gradients. Environmental temperature varies along latitudinal dines resulting in heterogeneous thermal resource availability, which generally induces ectotherms to use compensatory mechanisms to thermoregulate. Lizards can accommodate to ambient temperature changes through a combination of adaptive evolution and behavioral and physiological plasticity. We studied the thermal ecology of the endangered endemic lizard Liolaemus multi-maculatus at six different sites distributed from the northern to southern areas of the distribution (700 km) in the Atlantic dune barriers of Argentina, and even including the borders areas of the distribution range. Environmental temperatures and relative humidity showed a strong contrast between northern and southern limits of the distribution range. The northern localities had operative temperatures (Te) above the range of preferred temperatures (Tset), instead, the southern localities had large proportion of Tes within the Tset. Although these different climatic conditions may constrain the thermal biology of L. multimaculatus, individuals from all localities maintained relatively similar field body temperatures (XTb = 34.07 +/- 3.02 degrees C), suggesting that this parameter is conservative. Thermal preference partially reflected latitudinal temperature gradient, since lizards from the two southernmost localities showed the lowest Tsel and Tset. Thermoregulatory efficiency differed among localities, since E values in the northern localities (E = 0.53-0.69) showed less variability than those of southern localities (E = 0.14-0.67). Although L. multimaculatus employed a strategy of having a conservative Tb and being able to acclimatize the thermal preference to copes with latitudinal changes in the thermal environment, other local factors, such as ecological interactions, may also impose limitations to thermoregulation and this may interfered in the interpretation of results at wider spatial scale.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102485,88,NA,NA,102485,Endangered species; Geographic gradient; Reptile; Temperature change; Thermoregulation

E. and St-Hilaire, A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"As water temperature is projected to increase in the next decades and its rise is clearly identified as a threat for cold water fish species, it is necessary to adapt and optimize the tools allowing to assess the quantity and quality of habitats with the inclusion of temperature. In this paper, a fuzzy logic habitat model was improved by adding water temperature as a key determinant of juvenile Atlantic salmon parr habitat quality. First, salmon experts were consulted to gather their knowledge of salmon parr habitat, then the model was validated with juvenile salmon electrofishing data collected on the Sainte-Marguerite, Matapedia and Petite-Cascapedia rivers (Quebec, Canada). The model indicates that when thermal contrasts exist at a site, cooler temperature offered better quality of habitat. Our field data show that when offered the choice, salmon parr significantly preferred to avoid both cold areas (<15 degrees C) and warm areas (>20.5 degrees C). Because such thermal contrasts were not consistently present among the sites sampled, the model was only validated for less than 60\% of the sites. The results nevertheless indicate a significant correlation between median Habitat Quality Index and parr density for the Sainte-Marguerite River (R-2 = 0.38). A less important, albeit significant (F-test; p = 0.036) relationship was observed for the Petite-Cascapedia river (R-2 = 0.14). In all instances, the four-variable (depth, velocity, substrate size and temperature) model provided a better explanation of parr density than a similar model excluding water temperature.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102471,87,NA,NA,102471,Fuzzy logic; Habitat quality model; Atlantic salmon; Parr; Water temperature

Majharul and Al-Emran, Md and Rahman, Mohammad Shadiqur and Hossain, Mostafa Ali Reza",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Rise of water temperature as a consequence of global warming is anticipated to affect the physiological activities of fish, especially in tropical regions. In the present experiment, we exposed the Indian major carp, rohu Labeo rohita to three different temperature regimes (30 degrees C as control and 33 degrees C and 36 degrees C) for 60 days and observed the effects of these temperature on: major hemato-biochemical indices (Hemoglobin; Hb, Red blood cell; RBC, White blood cell; WBC and blood glucose levels), erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA), and erythrocytic cellular abnormalities (ECA) of peripheral erythrocytes along with the formation of differential leucocytes in the blood. Fish were sacrificed at day 7, 15, 30 and 60 after the start of exposure to the temperature regimes. Hb decreased significantly on days 7 and 15 at 36 degrees C. Throughout the study period, the decrease of RBC and increase of WBC were significant at 36 degrees C. Blood glucose level increased significantly initially at day 7 but decreased significantly at day 60 at 36 degrees C. Frequencies of ENA (binucleated, nuclear bud, nuclear bridge, karyopyknosis and notched nuclei) and ECA (twin, fusion, echinocytic, spindle, tear drop and elongated shaped) were significantly increased at the highest temperature (36 degrees C) at almost all of the sampling days. In the case of differential leucocyte count, high temperature caused a significant increase in the number of neutrophils and a significant decrease in the number of lymphocytes. Overall, these results indicate that chronic exposure to high temperature (36 degrees C) induces a number of stress responses in rohu and that temperature should be kept below 36 degrees C in the aquaculture setting to avoid damage to the fish.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102450,86,NA,NA,102450,Labeo rohita; High temperature; Hematological parameters; Blood glucose; Erythrocytes; Leukocytes

However, it still remains elusive how widespread the symbiotic interactions with Actinobacteria in other organisms are and how these partnerships benefit the hosts in terms of the growth and survival. We characterized a drastic temperature-induced change in the occurrence of Actinobacteria in the gut of the terrestrial isopod Porcellio scaber reared under two different temperature (15 degrees C and 22 degrees C) and oxygen conditions (10\% and 22\% O-2) using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We show that the relative abundance of actinobacterial gut symbionts correlates with increased host growth at lower temperature. Actinobacterial symbionts were almost completely absent at 22 degrees C under both high and low oxygen conditions. In addition, we identified members of nearly half of the known actinobacterial families in the isopod micro-biome, and most of these include members that are known to produce antibiotics. Our study suggests that hosting diverse actinobacterial symbionts may provide conditions favorable for host growth.

However, the impact of HS on metabolomic profiles of sows during late gestation is not fully understood. We present here, a study investigating the productive performance and metabolic responses in sows when exposed to HS during late gestation. Twelve first-parity Landrace x Large White Fl sows were randomly assigned into two environmental treatments including the thennoneutral (TN) (18-22 degrees C; n = 6) and HS (28-32 degrees C; n = 6) conditions from 85 d of gestation until farrowing. Rectal temperature (RT), respiration rates (RR), and surface temperature (ST) were measured every 4 h from 0800 h to 2000 h during the 2nd week. Farrowing and litter Data, as well as duration of eating, were monitored to assess sows' productive performance. Blood biochemical parameters and urinary metabolomic profiles were measured on d107 of gestation to analyze the host metabolic responses. Our results show that HS increased RT, RR, and ST (P < 0.0001). Duration of parturition was prolonged during the delivery in HS group (P < 0.05). Piglet body weight (SW) at d 10 and weaning were reduced by 18\% and 17\% respectively due to maternal HS (P < 0.001). Duration of eating increased as a result of HS (P < 0.001), consistent with the significant changes observed in serum ghrelin (P < 0.05). Moreover, serum ACTH, cortisol, insulin, creatinine, and BUN saw increase as well (P < 0.05). Plasma NEFA were elevated by HS (P < 0.001).

K. and Kumar, Paritosh and Sharma, Rupam and Baitha, Raju and Singh, Dilip Kumar and Singh, Narendra Pratap",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Unexpected fluctuations in weather parameters due to global climate change have been observed in all ecosystems worldwide. The aquatic ecosystem shelters a great diversity of fishes in the upper region of the ecosystem which adversely get affected due to their poikilothermic nature. The present study was designed to elucidate the impact of critical temperature minima (CTMin), lethal temperature minima (LTMin), critical temperature maxima (CTMax), and lethal temperature maxima (LTMax) on Channa striatus. Biologically synthesized silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) were evaluated for their potential to enhance thermal tolerance and improve the activities of biochemical enzymes of C. striatus reared under lead (Pb) and high temperature (34 degrees C) for 50 days. Three iso-caloric and iso-nitrogenous diets which included a basal diet and two supplemented diets with Ag-NPs @ 0.5 mg/kg, and 1 mg/kg were used in the study. Results suggested that CTMin and LTMin were significantly (p < 0.01) reduced and CTMax and LTMax were enhanced in the group fed with 0.5 mg/kg Ag-NPs supplemented feed. Pre-exposure to high temperature led to enhanced CTMax and LTMax in C. striatus. The biochemical enzymes involved in protein metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, acetylcholine esterase and antioxidant activities were found to be normal in fish fed with 0.5 mg/kg Ag-NPs supplemented diet. Bioaccumulation of silver and Pb was determined in different fish tissues and experimental water. Overall, the incorporation of Ag-NPs at 0.5 mg/kg in diet can confer protection to fish against Pb and thermal stress and enhance thermal tolerance of C. striatus.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.08.011,77,NA,111-121,NA,Silver nanoparticles; Thermal tolerance; Stress biomarkers; Abiotic stress; Channa striatus
article,Speed of exposure to rapid cold hardening and genotype drive the level of acclimation response in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>,"Gerken, Alison R. and Eller-Smith, Olivia C. and Morgan, Theodore J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Comparing methodologies that attempt to mimic natural conditions is important when evaluating thermal tolerances of ectotherms, as exposing animals to different artificial thermal regimes may provide conflicting information of an insect's thermal profile. Rapid cold hardening (RCH) occurs in ectotherms and typically increases survivorship to extreme cold exposure through a short, pre-treatment to a non-lethal cold temperature. Here we assess survivorship in a set of genotypes from the Drosophila melanogaster Reference Panel for direct and ramping RCH pre-treatments at cooling rates occurring under more natural conditions (0.1 degrees C/min and 0.5 degrees C/min) in combination with a direct and ramped rewarming treatment post cold exposure. We find that all three pretreatment exposures alone significantly increase survivorship. We find significant correlations in survivorship among treatments across genotypes, suggesting that regardless of the pre-treatment, individuals of a given genotype have an innate level of acclimation. When rewarming is introduced, survivorship significantly decreased relative to pre-treatment alone and correlations of survival between phenotypes were not significant. Our results suggest that rewarming and slow RCH are costly to survival while a quicker RCH may impart physiological benefits more consistently across genotypes.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.06.011,76,NA,21-28,NA,Ecologically relevant; Thermal tolerance; Genotypic variation
article,Computational modeling of the effect of temperature variations on human pancreatic β-cell activity,"Farashi, Sajjad and Sasanpour, Pezhman and Rafii-Tabar, Hashem",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The effect of temperature variations on the pancreatic beta-cell activity and the role of different model compartments in temperature sensing have been investigated using a computational modeling approach. The results of our study show that temperature variations by several degrees can change the dynamical states of the beta-cell system. In addition, temperature variations can alter the characteristic features of the membrane voltage, which correlates with insulin secretion. Simulation results show that the ion channels such as the L-type calcium, the hERG potassium, sodium channels and the glycolysis pathway are the possible sites for sensing temperature variation. Results indicate that for a small temperature change, even though the frequency and amplitude of electrical activity are altered, the area under the membrane potential curve remains almost unchanged, which implies the existence of a thermoregulatory mechanism for preserving the amount of insulin secretion. Furthermore, the computational analysis shows that the beta-cell electrical activity exhibits a bursting pattern in physiological temperature (37 degrees C) while in vitro studies reported almost the spiking activity at lower temperatures. Since hormone-secreting systems work more efficient in bursting mode, we propose that the pancreatic beta-cell works better in the physiological temperature compared with the reference temperature (33 degrees C).",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.05.006,75,NA,69-87,NA,Computational modeling; Temperature effect; Pancreatic beta-cell; Mathematical modeling; Q10 coefficient

article,The effect of ice slurry ingestion on body temperature and cycling performance in competitive athletes,"Mejuto, Gaizka and Chalmers, Samuel and Gilbert, Stephanie and Bentley, David",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The effects of pre cooling on endurance performance are widely known. In contrast, the approach of cooling during endurance exercise in combination with pre-exercise cooling has been poorly understood. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the effects of precooling and cooling during exercise enhance exercise performance compared to the ingestion of a thermo-neutral beverage (20 degrees C) or precooling alone in cycling performance. This was an experimental study using a randomised crossover design in which 7 cyclists underwent three trials comprising of 45 min steady state cycling (SS) at 70\% VO2 max and a subsequent 10 km time trial (TT) in hot conditions (32 degrees C, 50\% relative humidity). Rectal temperature (T-re), heat storage (HS), heart rate (HR), blood lactate concentration (BLA) and thermal sensation (TS) were measured. The intervention consisted of: (1) ingestion of thermo-neutral beverage before and during SS cycling (TN), (2) ingestion of ice slurry beverage and application of iced towels (precooling) prior to exercise, and then ingestion of thermo-neutral beverage during SS (PRE) and (3) precooling strategy as above plus ice slurry ingestion during SS cycling (PRE + MID). The intake of thermo-neutral or ice slurry beverage (14 g/kg) occurred over 30 min before and every 15 min during SS cycling. There was no significant difference in TT performance between all the conditions (P = 0.72). However, PRE and PRE + MID caused a significant decrease in T-re (P < 0.05) from TN during exercise. Accordingly, both precooling and a combination of precooling and mid-cooling during exercise in hot conditions may be a practical and effective way of reducing core temperature.

article,"Thermoregulatory challenges in the habitat of the world's smallest tortoise, <i>Chersobius signatus</i>","Loehr, Victor J. T.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Ectotherms have various means of dealing with low environmental temperatures, but relatively few species have been rigorously investigated. Consequently, we have little information to predict how ectotherm populations might respond to global temperature changes. Tortoises from temperate and subtropical regions often overcome periodically cool conditions by hibernation, but speckled dwarf tortoises (Chersobius signatus) need to remain active to exploit ephemeral resources in their arid winter-rainfall habitat. This study investigated how dwarf tortoises cope with low temperatures in winter and spring, by measuring thermal habitat quality and thermoregulation based on differently-sized operative temperature models in sun, shade, and in deep crevices. Investigations continued in summer and autumn to obtain a year-round picture of thermoregulatory challenges. Although large models (i.e., larger than dwarf tortoises) were expected to have lower operative temperatures than smaller models, due to the former's larger thermal inertia, all model sizes had similar temperatures. Hence, the species' small body size does not appear constrained by obtainable body temperatures in cool seasons. Nevertheless, low operative temperatures in winter posed a challenge for the tortoises, which reached their field preferred body temperature for an average of only 0.8-0.9 h per day. Moreover, a low thermoregulation effectiveness suggested that tortoises traded-off physiological benefits of favourable body temperatures against predation risk. Spring and autumn provided higher temperatures, but summer caused the greatest thermoregulatory challenge. Although summer body temperatures were closer to field-preferred body temperature than in any other season, tortoises required rock crevices to avoid overheating. The small size of dwarf tortoises might help them utilise crevices. In summer, maximum operative temperatures in crevices were similar to field-preferred body temperature, indicating that an increase in environmental temperatures might be detrimental to dwarf tortoises. In light of projected temperature rises, future studies should assess if dwarf tortoises can cope with higher environmental temperatures in summer.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.10.018,71,NA,62-68,NA,Body temperature; Ectotherm; Herbivore; Homopus; Rupicolous; Thermoregulation
article,A test of the thermal coadaptation hypothesis with ultimate measures of fitness in flour beetles,"Halliday, William D. and Blouin-Demers, Gabriel",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Whole-organism performance of ectotherms depends on body temperature, which is tightly linked to environmental temperatures. Individuals attempting to optimize fitness must thus select appropriate temperatures. The thermal coadaptation hypothesis posits that To for traits closely linked to fitness should match temperatures selected by a species (T-set) and should coevolve with T-set. To may mismatch T-set, if the thermal reaction norm for fitness is asymmetric. In this study, we examined six traits related to fitness in red and in confused flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum and T. confusum, respectively), including longevity, lifetime reproductive success, reproductive rate, and development time at four temperatures between 23 and 32 degrees C. For reproductive traits, To matched Tset whereas for longevity To was lower than T-set Triboliwn species have a strongly r-selected life history strategy, therefore reproductive traits are likely more tightly linked to fitness than longevity due to high predation rates at early life stages. We therefore provide support for the thermal coadaptation hypothesis for reproductive traits that are tightly linked to fitness.

article,An assessment of skin temperature gradients in a tropical primate using infrared thermography and subcutaneous implants,"Thompson, Cynthia L. and Scheidel, Caleb and Glander, Kenneth E. and Williams, Susan H. and Vinyard, Christopher J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Infrared thermography has become a useful tool to assess surface temperatures of animals for thermoregulatory research. However, surface temperatures are an endpoint along the body's core-shell temperature gradient. Skin and fur are the peripheral tissues most exposed to ambient thermal conditions and are known to serve as thermosensors that initiate thermoregulatory responses. Yet relatively little is known about how surface temperatures of wild mammals measured by infrared thermography relate to subcutaneous temperatures. Moreover, this relationship may differ with the degree that fur covers the body. To assess the relationship between temperatures and temperature gradients in peripheral tissues between furred and bare areas, we collected data from wild mantled howling monkeys (Alouatta palliata) in Costa Rica. We used infrared thermography to measure surface temperatures of the furred dorsum and bare facial areas of the body, recorded concurrent subcutaneous temperatures in the dorsum, and measured ambient thermal conditions via a weather station. Temperature gradients through cutaneous tissues (subcutaneous-Surface temperature) and surface temperature gradients (surface-ambient temperature) were calculated. Out results indicate that there are differences in temperatures and temperature gradients in furred versus bare areas of mantled howlers. Under natural thermal conditions experienced by wild animals, the bare facial areas were warmer than temperatures in the furred dorsum, and cutaneous temperature gradients in the face were more variable than the dorsum, consistent with these bare areas acting as thermal windows. Cutaneous temperature gradients in the dorsum were more closely linked to subcutaneous temperatures, while facial temperature gradients were more heavily influenced by ambient conditions. These findings indicate that despite the insulative properties of fur, for mantled howling monkeys surface temperatures of furred areas still demonstrate a relationship with subcutaneous temperatures. Given that most mammals possess dense fur, this provides insight for using infrared imaging in thermoregulatory studies of wild animals lacking bare skin.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.11.005,63,NA,49-57,NA,Subcutaneous temperature; Thermoregulation; Core-shell model; Heat loss; Howling monkey; Thermal windows
article,Local weather conditions have complex effects on the growth of blue tit nestlings,"Mainwaring, Mark C. and Hartley, Ian R.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Adverse weather conditions are expected to result in impaired nestling development in birds, but empirical studies have provided equivocal support for such a relationship. This may be because the negative effects of adverse weather conditions are masked by parental effects. Globally, ambient temperatures, rainfall levels, and wind speeds are all expected to increase in a changing climate and so there is a need for a better understanding of the relationship between weather conditions and nestling growth. Here, we describe a correlative study that examined the relationships between local temperatures, rainfall levels and wind speeds and the growth of individual blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) nestlings in relation to their hatching order and sex. We found that changes in a range of morphological characters were negatively related to both temperature and wind speed, but positively related to rainfall. These patterns were further influenced by the hatching order of the nestlings but not by nestling sex. This suggests that the predicted changes in local weather conditions may have complex effects on nestling growth, but that parents may be able to mitigate the adverse effects via adaptive parental effects. We therefore conclude that local weather conditions have complex effects on avian growth and the implications for patterns of avian growth in a changing climate are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

G.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"There is a controversy about whether the thermal constants, lower developmental threshold, rate of development and corresponding degree days required for development, change when a species is reared under different developmental conditions. We present a more precise way of measuring these constants using the linear relationship between the rate of development and temperature. First we use the equation proposed by lkemoto and Takai (2000) to determine the linear phase of development and then a generalised linear model having a different variance at low and high temperatures, specific for each condition, to estimate the parameters of the linear relationship. Using this method, we show that providing the difference in food quality is sufficiently great, an aphidophagous ladybird develops significantly faster and starts developing at a significantly lower temperature on a good than on a poor quality diet. Adaptive significance of the thermal constants not remaining constant is discussed in terms of a trade-off between growth and rate of development, when temperature and food quality varies.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Osteoarthritis (OA) mostly affect the joints of the hand and knee which result in lifelong pain, inability to climb, walk, etc. In the early stages, these diseases attack the synovial membrane and synovial fluid, and further it destroys the soft tissues and bone structure. By early diagnosis, we can start the treatment in the early stage which may cure these diseases with such extreme consequences. As per clinical studies of previous literature, it is observed that synovial fluid imbalance appears in the early stage of such diseases and Hyaluronic Acid (HA) concentration also decreases for that. Therefore, estimation of HA is a significant key to arthritis disease classification and grading. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid framework for classification of arthritic knee joints based on the analysis of the discontinuous appearances of the HA concentration using infrared imaging technology. To meet up the specific necessities, firstly we have proposed a modified K-Means clustering algorithm for extraction of the region of interest (ROI) i.e., the knee joint surface. Secondly, a mathematical formulation is proposed to calculate the concentration of HA from the segmented ROIs. This experimental process was implemented on the publicly available IR (Infrared) Knee Joint Dataset and for further evaluation of the novelty of mathematical formulation, we have extended the proposed work to the classification of healthy and arthritis affected knee joints depending on significant discriminative characteristics of the HA concentration with respect to the existing significant imaging features. Experimental results and analysis demonstrates that concentration of HA has the dominant potential for classifying healthy and arthritic knee joints using infrared holistic images. Our experimental analysis reveals that estimation and combination of the HA concentration features with conventional handcrafted and deep features increases the classification performance with an average accuracy of 91\% and 97.22\% respectively as compared to the each individual feature sets.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103915,123,NA,NA,103915,Arthritis; Synovial fluid; Hyaluronic acid; Concentration; Infrared thermograms; Classification
article,A generalized risk assessment index for forecasting insect population under the effect of temperature,"Ndjomatchoua, Frank T. and Guimapi, Ritter A. Y. and Rossini, Luca and Djouda, Byliole S. and Pedro, Sansao A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Life history traits have been studied under various environmental factors, but the ability to combine them into a simple function to assess pest response to climate is still lacking complete understanding. This study proposed a risk index derived by combining development, mortality, and fertility rates from a stage -structured dynamic mathematical model. The first part presents the theoretical framework behind the risk index. The second part of the study is concerned with the application of the index in two case studies of major economic pest: the brown planthopper ( Nilaparvata lugens ) and the spotted wing drosophila ( Drosophila suzukii ), pests of rice crops and soft fruits, respectively. The mathematical calculations provided a single function composed of the main thermal biodemographic rates. This function has a threshold value that determines the possibility of population increase as a function of temperature. The tests carried out on the two pest species showed the capability of the index to describe the range of favourable conditions. With this approach, we were able to identify areas where pests are tolerant to climatic conditions and to project them on a geospatial risk map. The theoretical background developed here provided a tool for understanding the biogeography of Nilaparvata lugens and Drosophila suzukii . It is flexible enough to deal with mathematically simple ( N. lugens ) and complex ( D. Suzukii ) case studies of crop insect pests. It produces biologically sound indices that behave like thermal performance curves. These theoretical results also provide a reasonable basis for addressing the challenge of pest management in the context of seasonal weather variations and climate change. This may help to improve monitoring and design management strategies to limit the spread of pests in invaded areas, as some non -invaded areas may be suitable for the species to develop.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103886,122,NA,NA,103886,Physiologically -based models; Integrated pest management; Space distribution models; Compartmental models; Temperature -dependent development; Thermal performance
article,Thermal tolerance of cultured and wild Icelandic arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) at self-selected flow rates,"Nelson, Jay A. and Thorarensen, Helgi Thor",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Climate change is predicted to change not only the temperature of many freshwater systems but also flow dynamics. Understanding how fishes will fare in the future requires knowing how they will respond to both extended variations of temperature and flow. Arctic charr have had their thermal tolerance measured, but never with respect to flow. Additionally, this circumpolar species has multiple populations exhibiting dramatic phenotypic plasticity which may mean that regional differences in thermal tolerance are unaccounted for. In Iceland, Arctic charr populations have experienced highly variable flow and temperature conditions over the past 10,000 years. The Icelandic climate, topography and geothermal activity have created a mosaic of freshwater habitats inhabited by charr that vary substantially in both temperature and flow. Our purpose was to test whether populations from these varied environments had altered thermal tolerance and whether phenotypic plasticity of thermal tolerance in charr depends on flow. We raised cultured Icelandic charr from hatch under a 2 X 2 matrix of flow and temperature and compared them to wild charr captured from matching flow and temperature environments. Wild fish were more thermally tolerant than cultured fish at both acclimation temperatures and were more thermally plastic. Icelandic Arctic charr were more thermally tolerant than comparison charr populations across Europe and North America, but only when acclimated to 13 degrees C; fish acclimated to 5 degrees C compared equably with comparison charr populations. Icelandic Arctic charr were also more thermally plastic than all but one other salmonine species. Neither flow of rearing or the flow selected during a thermal tolerance (CTmax) test factored into thermal tolerance. Thermal tolerance was also independent of body size, condition factor, heart and gill size. In summary, wild Icelandic Arctic charr have greater thermal tolerance and plasticity than predicted from the literature and their latitude, but artificial selection for properties like growth rate or fecundity may be breeding that increased tolerance out of cultured fish. As the world moves toward a warmer climate and increased dependence on cultured fish, this is a noteworthy result and merits further study.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103863,121,NA,NA,103863,Thermal tolerance; Plasticity; Iceland; Charr

Materials \& methods: Bony metastatic patients with pain score >= 4 on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) underwent RT of 30 Gy in 10 fractions in combination with WBH with nursing care under medical supervision versus RT-alone. WBH application time was 3-4 h in three fractions with at least 48-h intervals. All patients were stratified primary site, breast or prostate cancer vs others, BPI score, and exclusion criteria. The primary endpoint was complete response (CR) (BPI equal to zero with no increase of analgesics) within two months of follow-up. Results: Based on this study, the RT-alone group showed the worst pain. The study was terminated after the enrollment of a total of 61 patients, 5 years after the first enrollment (April 2016 to February 2021). Finally, the CR rate in RT + WBH revealed the most significant difference with RT-alone, 47.4\% versus 5.3\% respectively within 2 months post -treatment (P -value <0.05).

However, whether fish acclimate in the laboratory similarly as they acclimatize in the field under comparable thermal variation is unclear. We used temperature data from a tidal salt marsh to design 21-day labacclimation treatments (static: 12, 17, 22, 27 degrees C; daily variation with mean 22 degrees C: i) range 17-27 degrees C, ii) range 1727 degrees C with irregular extremes within 12-32 degrees C). We compared thermal limits in lab-acclimated and fieldacclimatized eurythermal arrow goby (Clevelandia ios). Variable temperature-acclimated and acclimatized fish had similar CTmin and CTmax. Notably, arrow gobies showed rapid plasticity in their absolute thermal tolerance within one tidal cycle. The daily mean and max temperatures experienced were positively related to CTmax and CTmin, respectively.

Forty sheep, non-castrated, with an average body weight of 18.85 kg (SD = 2.80 kg) and an average age of 5 months were assigned to a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement, comprising 2 diets (high- and low-energy) and 2 water offers (ad libitum and 50\% water restriction), with 10 replicates. Thermoregulatory responses were evaluated in two periods (morning and afternoon). There was an interaction effect of Diet x Water supply x Periods on respiratory rate (P < 0.05). High-energy diets resulted in increased heart rate, idleness, dry matter feeding and rumination efficiency, and water intake. Low-energy diets increased feeding time, rumination time, the number of ruminal cuds, chews per day, total chewing time, neutral detergent fiber intake and rumination efficiency, number of ruminations per day, average duration of rumination, and defecation frequency. Water supply affected heart rate and idleness (P < 0.05). Sheep had higher values of heart rate and rectal and surface temperatures during the afternoon (P < 0.05).

C. and Delorme, Natali J. and Ericson, Jessica A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Marine heatwaves (MHW) are projected for the foreseeable future, affecting aquaculture species, such as the New Zealand green-lipped mussel (Perna canaliculus). Thermal stress alters mussel physiology highlighting the adaptive capacity that allows survival in the face of heatwaves. Within this study, adult mussels were subjected to three different seawater temperature regimes: 1) low (sustained 18 degrees C), 2) medium MHW (18-24 degrees C, using a +1 degrees C per week ramp) and 3) high MHW (18-24 degrees C, using a +2 degrees C per week ramp). Sampling was performed over 11 weeks to establish the effects of temperature on P. canaliculus survival, condition, specific immune response parameters, and the haemolymph metabolome. A transient 25.5-26.5 degrees C exposure resulted in 61 \% mortality, with surviving animals showing a metabolic adjustment within aerobic energy production, enabling the activation of molecular defence mechanisms. Utilisation of immune functions were seen within the cytology results where temperature stress affected the percentage of superoxide-positive haemocytes and haemocyte counts. From the metabolomics results an increase in antioxidant metabolites were seen in the high MHW survivors, possibly to counteract molecular damage. In the high MHW exposure group, mussels utilised anaerobic metabolism in conjunction with aerobic metabolism to produce energy, to uphold biological functions and survival. The effect of exposure time was mainly seen on very long-, and long chain fatty acids, with increases observed at weeks seven and eight. These changes were likely due to the membrane storage functions of fatty acids, with decreases at week eleven attributed to energy metabolism functions. This study supports the use of integrated analytical tools to investigate the response of marine organisms to heatwaves. Indeed, specific metabolic pathways and cellular markers are now highlighted for future investigations aimed at targeted measures.

Twelve participants were exposed to Thermoneutral Normoxic (24 degrees C; FiO2 21\%), Cold Normoxic (10 degrees C; FiO2 21\%), and Cold Hypoxic (10 degrees C; FiO214\%) conditions for 30min before performing pistol marksmanship at distances of 6.40 and 13.72m and a pistol magazine reload task before and after 3 sets of sandbag deadlifts at 50\% body mass. Thermal perception and hand temperatures were collected before and after the physical exertion task. There were no significant differences in Pistol Accuracy performance at distances of 6.40 and 13.72m due to physical exertion, cold, or hypoxia. Following physical exertion, Pistol Accuracy was similar between Thermoneutral and Cold Normoxic conditions but lead to 17\% and a 10\% reduction in performance during the Cold Hypoxic condition, compared to Thermoneutral and Cold Normoxic conditions. There was no change in Pistol Accuracy for the Thermoneutral Normoxic condition. The pistol magazine reload task was not impacted by physical exertion, but there was a reduction in performance in Cold Normoxic 21\% (4.04s) and Cold Hypoxic 16\% (3.08s) conditions. Physical exertion did not impact hand temperature but did increase thermal perception scores for all conditions. These findings indicate that cold exposure reduced both tactical dexterity and pistol marksmanship, however, physical exertion may offset these deficits via an increase in thermal perception. Additionally, hypoxemia was the primary mediator of marksmanship performance in cold hypoxic environments following an acute bout of physical exertion. Thus, in cold mountainous environments, marksmen should be aware of their elevation and utilize brief episodes of physical activity to enhance their thermal state when marksmanship is a priority for operational success.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103676,117,NA,NA,103676,NA

article,Heat-avoidance behavior associates with thermal sensitivity rather than tolerance in aphid assemblages,"Bai, Xue and Wang, Xue-Jing and Ma, Chun-Sen and Ma, Gang",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"How to predict animals' heat-avoidance behaviors is critical since behavior stands the first line for animals dealing with frequent heat events under ongoing climate warming. However, the discrepancy between the scarcity of research on heat-avoidance behaviors and the commonness of eco-physiological data for thermal tolerance and for thermal sensitivity such as the temperature-dependent survival time makes it difficult to link physiological thermal traits to heat-avoidance behavior. Aphids usually suck plant sap on a fixed site on the host plants at moderate temperatures, but they will leave and seek cooler feeding sites under stressful temperatures. Here we take the cereal aphid assemblages comprising different species with various development stages as a model system. We tested the hypotheses that heat tolerance (critical thermal maximum, CTmax) or heat sensi-tivity (temperature-dependent declining rate of survival time, similarly hereinafter) would associate with the temperature at which aphid activate heat-avoidance behavior. Specifically, we hypothesized the aphids with less heat tolerance or greater heat sensitivity would take a lower heat risk by leaving the host plant earlier. By mimicking the linear increase in ambient temperature during the daytime, we measured the CTmax and the heat -avoidance temperature (HAT, at which aphids leave the host plant to find cooler places) to understand their heat tolerance and heat-avoidance behavior. Then, we tested the survival time of aphids at different temperatures and calculated the slope of survival time declining with temperature to assess their heat sensitivity (HS). Finally, we examined the relationships between CTmax and HAT and between HS and HAT to understand if the heat -avoidance behavior associates with heat tolerance or with heat sensitivity. The results showed that HS and HAT had a strong correlation, with more heat sensitive individuals displayed lower HAT. By contrast, CTmax and HAT had a weak correlation. Our results thus provide evidence that heat sensitivity is a more reliable indicator than thermal tolerance linking with the heat-avoidance behavior in the aphid assemblages. Most existing studies use the indexes related to thermal tolerance to predict warming impacts. Our findings highlight the urgency to incorporate thermal sensitivity when predicting animal responses to climate change.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103550,114,NA,NA,103550,Behavioral thermoregulation; Climate change; Decision-making; Metopolophium dirhodum; Schizaphis graminum; Sitobion avenae

The mechanisms involved in heat pro-duction by cancer cells include neoangiogenesis, increased metabolic rate, vasodilation, and the release of nitric oxide and pro-inflammatory substances. Currently, thermography has been widely studied in humans as a screening tool for skin and breast cancer, with positive results.

The deviation direction of TSV in winter was to the warm sensation side, which was opposite to the inherent cold and hot impression of people in winter and summer. The association between dimensionless dopamine (DA{*}), TSV and MST were described as follows: DA{*} was the U-shaped change with exposure times when MST was not greater than 31 degrees C, and TSV was at-2 and-1, and DA{*} increased with exposure times when MST was greater than 31 degrees C, and TSV was at 0, 1 and 2. The changes in the body heat storage and autonomous thermal regulation under temperature step changes may potentially be related to the concentration of DA. The human state on thermal nonequilibrium and stronger thermal regulation would correspond to a higher concentration of DA. This work is conducive to exploring the human regulation mechanism in a transient environment.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103447,112,NA,NA,103447,Temperature step change; Thermal comfort; Skin temperature; Endogenous dopamine
article,Determining the different phases of torpor from skin- or body temperature data in heterotherms,"Fjelldal, Mari Aas and Stawski, Clare and Soras, Rune and Wright, Jonathan",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Technological innovations have made heat-sensitive data-loggers smaller, more efficient and less expensive, which has led to a growing body of literature that measures the skin-or body temperatures of small animals in their natural environments. Studies of this type on heterothermic endotherms have prompted much debate regarding how to best define `torpor' expressions from skin-or body temperature data alone. We propose a new quantitative method for defining torpor `entries', `arousals' and `stable torpor periods' whilst comparing the results to `torpor bout' durations identified using only the torpor cut-off method. By decomposing a torpor bout into `entries', `stable torpor periods', and `active arousals', we avoid biases introduced by using strict threshold temperature values for the onset of torpor, thereby allowing better insight into individual use of torpor. We present our method as an easy-to-use function written in R-code, offering an un-biased and consistent meth-odology to be applied on skin-or body temperature measurements across datasets and research groups. When testing the function on a large dataset of skin temperature data collected on three bat species in Norway (Plecotus auritus: Nind = 39; Eptesicus nilssonii: Nind = 11; Myotis brandtii: Nind = 10), we identified 461 complete torpor bouts across species. More than 40\% of the torpor bouts (Nbouts = 192) did not contain stable torpor periods, because the bats aroused before they had reached a stable skin temperature level. Furthermore, only considering `torpid' and `euthermic' temperature values by applying strict cut-off thresholds led to potentially large un-derestimations of torpor bout durations compared to our quantitative determination of the onset and termination of each torpor bout. We highlight the importance of differentiating between torpor phases, especially for active arousals that can be very energetically expensive and may alter our evaluation of the actual energetic savings gained by an individual employing torpor.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103396,111,NA,NA,103396,Heterothermy; Radiotelemetry; Cooling rates; Rewarming rates; Chiroptera

While a negative correlation between water temperatures and the time required between constitutive nesting events (termed the internesting interval) has been previously reported in loggerhead Caretta caretta and green turtles Chelonia mydas, it is not understood whether this relationship remains constant across other sea turtle species. Here, we expanded upon these pre-vious studies on loggerhead and green turtles by using larger sample sizes and including data from species with a wider range of body-sizes; specifically: hawksbill Eretmochelys imbricata, leatherback Dermochelys coriacea, and olive ridley turtles Lepidochelys olivacea. In total, we compiled temperature data from biologgers deployed over internesting intervals on 23 loggerhead, 22 green, 7 hawksbill, 26 leatherback and 11 olive ridley turtles from nesting sites in 8 different countries. The relationship between the duration of the internesting interval and water temperatures in green and loggerhead turtles were statistically similar yet it differed between all other turtle species. Specifically, hawksbill turtles had much longer internesting intervals than green or loggerhead turtles even after controlling for temperature. In addition, both olive ridley and leatherback turtles exhibited thermal independence of internesting intervals presumably due to the large body-size of leatherback turtles and the unique capacity of ridley turtles to delay oviposition. The observed interspecific differences in the relationship between the length of the internesting interval and water temperatures indicate the complex and variable re-sponses that each sea turtle species may exhibit due to environmental fluctuations and climate change.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103342,110,NA,NA,103342,Sea turtles; Reproduction; Phenology; Climate change; Biologgers; Inter -nesting period
article,Developmental timing of Drosophila pachea pupae is robust to temperature changes,"Lefevre, Benedicte M. and Mienanzambi, Stecy and Lang, Michael",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Rearing temperature is correlated with the timing and speed of development in a wide range of poikiloterm animals that do not regulate their body temperature. However, exceptions exist, especially in species that live in environments with high temperature extremes or oscillations. Drosophila pachea is endemic to the Sonoran desert in Mexico, in which temperatures and temperature variations are extreme. We wondered if the developmental timing in D. pachea may be sensitive to differing rearing temperatures or if it remains constant. We determined the overall timing of the Drosophila pachea life-cycle at different temperatures. The duration of pupal development was similar at 25 degrees C, 29 degrees C and 32 degrees C, although the relative progress differed at particular stages. Thus, D. pachea may have evolved mechanisms to buffer temperature effects on developmental speed, potentially to ensure proper development and individual's fitness in desert climate conditions.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103232,106,NA,NA,103232,Drosophila pachea; Pupal development; Temperature; Heterochrony

This study investigated whether L-citrulline can exert these functions in heat-stressed chickens. Arbor acre broilers were fed either basal diets (Control) or basal diets supplemented with 1\% L-citrulline (L-Cit). At 28 d old, broilers were subjected to two environmental temperatures, 35 ? for 8 h/d (HS) or 24 ? for 24 h/d (TNZ) for 2 weeks. The experiment was designed as a 2 by 2 factorial arrangement. Results showed that HS increased the core body temperature (CBT) and rectal temperature of broilers compared to the TNZ condition. The CBT and mean CBT decreased by similar to 0.5? in TNZ + L-Cit broilers compared to the TNZ + Control group (P < 0.05). L-Cit supplementation at TNZ significantly (P < 0.05) lowered the plasma malondialdehyde content but this was increased during HS. Exposure to HS significantly (P < 0.05) elevated plasma malondialdehyde compared to TNZ condition. Plasma immunoglobulin A, G, and M were increased (P < 0.05) by TNZ + L-Cit compared to the TNZ + Control group. Plasma nitric oxide and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity was increased during HS, whereas the total and inducible NOS enzymes were decreased. In addition, L-Cit supplementation increased both the inducible and endothelial NOS isoforms (P < 0.05). The mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha, avian uncoupling protein, cytochrome C oxidase subunit 3, and ATP synthase F1 subunit beta (ATP5 beta) in the breast muscle were downregulated (P < 0.05) during HS. However, L-Cit supplementation upregulated the mitochondrial transcription factor A and during HS, L-Cit increased ATP5 beta expression similar to TNZ housed broilers. Therefore, this study demonstrates that dietary L-Cit can lower the body temperature, decrease lipid peroxidation and promote the immune status of broilers under thermoneutrality. Also, L-Cit would act to promote muscle ATP generation during heat stress in broilers.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103227,105,NA,NA,103227,L-Citrulline; Body temperature; Mitochondrial biogenesis; ATP generation; Nitric oxide; Heat stress

In the intertidal zone, species are already living at their thermal limits, being vulnerable even to small increases in maximum habitat temperatures. Knowledge of the mechanisms by which many intertidal zone species cope with elevated temperatures is limited. We analysed the molecular thermal stress response of the limpet Patella vulgata under slight and frequent (one-day), and extreme and rare (three-day) warming events. Using RNA-seq to assess differential gene expression among treatments, differing molecular responses were obtained in the two treatments, with more changes in gene expression after the three-day event; with one-third of the differentially expressed transcripts being down regulated. However, across treatments we observed shifts in gene expression for common aspects of the heat stress response including intra-cellular communication, protein chaperoning, proteolysis and cell cycle arrest. Of the 71,675 transcripts obtained, only 259 were differentially expressed after both heating events. From these, 218 defined the core group (i.e. genes induced by thermal stress with similar expression patterns irrespective of the magnitude of the warming event). The core group was composed of already well-studied genes in heat stress responses in intertidal organisms (e.g. heat shock proteins), but also genes from less explored metabolic pathways, e.g. the ubiquitin system, which were also fundamental regardless of the magnitude of the imposed warming. Moreover, we have also identified 41 signaling genes (i.e. a set of genes responding to both events and with expression patterns specific to the intensity of thermal stress), principally including genes involved in the maintenance of extracellular structure that have previously not been identified as part of the response to thermal stress in intertidal zone organisms.

article,Human thermophysiological models: Quantification of uncertainty in the output quantities of the passive system due to uncertainties in the control equations of the active system via the Monte Carlo method,"Basdanis, Thanasis and Tatsios, Giorgos and Valougeorgis, Dimitris",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Uncertainty propagation analysis in the Fiala thermophysiological model is performed by the Monte Carlo Method. The uncertainties of the output quantities of the passive system, due to imported uncertainties in the coefficients of the control equations of the active system, caused by the variation of the experimental data, are computed. The developed and implemented in-house code is accordingly validated. The effect of the input uncertainties, in each of the four main responses (shivering, vasodilatation, vasoconstriction, sweating) of the active system, is separately examined by simulating the human exposure from neutral conditions to cold and hot environments. It is predicted that the maximum output uncertainties of the response mechanisms may be of the same order of magnitude as the imported ones, while the corresponding maximum uncertainties in core and skin temperatures always remain less than 2\%. The maximum absolute deviations of the rectal (core) temperatures from their estimated mean values may be up to 0.72 degrees C and 0.22 degrees C, due to input uncertainties in shivering and sweating respectively, while the corresponding deviations due to uncertainties in vasomotion processes are negligible. The deviations, particularly the ones due to shivering, are significant, since differences of a few tenths of a degree may have large impact in human health. The maximum absolute deviations of the skin temperatures are 0.42 degrees C in the hands due to uncertainties in shivering and 0.69 degrees C in the feet due to uncertainties in vasodilatation. These deviations are less significant than the core ones, but they may still affect human thermal sensation and comfort. The present analysis provides a better insight in the dynamic response of the model and indicates which response mechanism needs to be further investigated by more accurate estimates in order to improve model reliability. It can be also applied in other human thermophysiological models.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103045,100,NA,NA,103045,Bioheat equation; Human thermoregulation; Thermophysiological models; Fiala model; Skin and rectal temperatures; Uncertainty propagation analysis
article,The effect of cold exposure on serum cholesterol is dependent upon ApoE,"He, Fang and Su, Wenquan and Wu, Rongrong and Li, He and Lou, Lixia and Wu, Aiming and Xie, Lifang and Du, Yawei and Wu, Shengxian",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Background: Several lines of evidence indicate that cold stimulation may not only activate brown adipose tissue (BAT) and the white adipose tissue (WAT), but also regulate the lipid metabolism and influence the development of atherosclerosis. However, the study of cold exposure affecting cholesterol metabolism have opposite results in different experiments, and Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) may play an important role. There is still a lack of complete research to illustrate this problem. Methods: In this study, we first analyzed and discussed the activation of interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT), inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) and epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) under cold exposure (4 degrees C) in male wild-type C57BL/6 J (WT) and ApoE-deficient mice (ApoE-/- ) fed high-fat diet (HFD) for 4 weeks. Subsequently, we investigated the effect of cold exposure on blood lipid profiles in both models. We further explored whether cold exposure can reduce serum cholesterol. Results: In both WT and ApoE- /- mice, cold exposure activates iBAT and iWAT, as well as hardly affects eWAT. In WT mice,4 weeks cold exposure (4 degrees C) reduces serum triglyceride by 28\%, cholesterol by 30\% and LDLcholesterol by 63\%. In ApoE- /- mice, cold stimulation decreases serum triglyceride by 59\%, but increases cholesterol by 20\% and LDL-cholesterol by 25\%.

This study aims to determine the similarity of measurement performance between three models of IRT camera during assessment of skin temperature before and after physical exercise. Three models of FLIR thermographic cameras (E60bx, Flir-One Pro LT, and C2) were tested. Thermal images were taken of the foot sole, anterior leg, and anterior thigh from 12 well-trained men, before and after a 30-min run on a treadmill. Image files were blinded and processed by three evaluators to extract the mean, maximum, and standard deviation of skin temperature of the region of interest. Time for data processing and rate of perceived effort was also recorded. Data processing was slower on the E60bx (CI95\% E60 vs C2 {[}0.2, 2.6 min], p = 0.02 and ES = 0.6); vs. Flir-One {[}0.0, 3.4 min], p = 0.03 and ES = 0.6) and was associated with lower effort perception (E60 3.0 +/- 0.1 vs. Flir-One 5.6 +/- 0.2 vs C2 7.0 +/- 0.2 points; p 0.001 and ES 0.8). The C2 and FlirOne cameras underestimated the temperature compared with the E60. In general, measuring mean temperature provided higher camera and examiner intra-class correlations than maximum and standard deviation, especially before exercise. Moreover, post exercise mean skin temperatures provided the most consistent values across cameras and evaluators. We recommend the use of mean temperature and caution when using more than one camera model in a study.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102913,98,NA,NA,102913,Thermal imaging; Physical exercise; Infrared thermography; Running; Thermoregulation

Changes in temperature have an important effect on the growth and development and energy metabolism of amphibians. The aim of this study is to unravel the effects of temperature on the leptin signaling pathway of Bufo gargarizans and its molecular mechanisms. Our results showed that high temperature accelerated the development rate of tadpoles, but reduced body size and mass, while low temperature deferred the development of tadpoles, but increased size and mass. Both high temperature and low temperature exposure caused pathological damage of the liver in B. gargarizans. The results of RT-qPCR revealed that the high temperature treatment significantly upregulated the transcript levels of genes related to thyroid hormone (DIO2 (D2), Thyroid Hormone Receptor-? (TR?)) and the leptin signaling pathway (Leptin Receptor (LepR), Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), Tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), Signal Transducer And Activator Of Transcription 3 (STAT3), Signal Transducer And Activator Of Transcription 3.1 (STAT3.1), and Signal Transducer And Activator Of Transcription 6 (STAT6)), while there was a decrease of mRNA expression of these genes (TR?, Thyroid Hormone Receptor-Beta (TR?), LepR, JAK1, and TYK2) in the liver of tadpoles exposed to high temperature compared with the intermediate temperature treatment. Therefore, our results suggested that temperature extremes might interfere with the thyroid and leptin signaling pathways and affect the growth and development of B. gargarizans. Furthermore, tissue injury of the liver could occur due to exposure to temperature extremes.

The capacity for temperature-induced developmental plasticity is determined by the thermal adaptation of a population. Multiple factors such as physiological responses to changing environmental conditions, however, might influence this capacity as well. In anuran larvae, thyroid hormone (TH) levels control growth and developmental rate and changes in TH status are a well-known stress response to sub-optimal environmental conditions. We investigated how chemically altered TH levels affect the capacity to exhibit temperature-induced developmental plasticity in larvae of the African clawed frog (Xenopus ktevis) and the common frog (Rana ternporaria). In both species, TH level influenced growth and developmental rate and modified the capacity for temperature-induced developmental plasticity. High TH levels reduced thermal sensitivity of metamorphic traits up to 57\% (R. temporaria) and 36\% (X. laevis). Rates of growth and development were more plastic in response to temperature in X. laevis (+30\%) than in R. temporaria (+6\%). Plasticity in rates of growth and development is beneficial to larvae in heterogeneous habitats as it allows a more rapid transition into the juvenile stage where rates of mortality are lower. Therefore, environmental stressors that increase endogenous TH levels and reduce temperature-dependent plasticity may increase risks and the vulnerability of anuran larvae. As TH status also influences metabolism, future studies should investigate whether reductions in physiological plasticity also increases the vulnerability of tadpoles to global change.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102599,90,NA,NA,102599,Metamorphosis; Amphibian decline; Climate change; Temperature-size-rule; Tadpoles; Thermal adaptation

Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to examine the impact of a cooling strategy combining forearm water immersion and a low dose of ice slurry ingestion on physiological response and subsequent exercise performance in the heat. Eight non-heat-acclimated males participated in this study. After reaching a rectal temperature of 38.5 degrees C through a bout of cycling exercise in the heat (35 degrees C, 60\% relative humidity), the participants were subjected to one of the following four conditions for a 15-min period: W: forearm cooling; ICE: ice slurry (-1 degrees C) ingestion; MIX: both W and ICE, and CON: no cooling intervention. After the intervention, the participants performed time to exhaustion (TTE) cycling exercise at 75\% (V) over dotO(2max).The rate of decrease in rectal temperature in the MIX group was significantly lower than that in the CON group from 6 min to the end of the cooling intervention period (P < 0.05). In addition, mean skin temperature, heart rate, physiological strain index, and perceptual strain were significantly reduced for MIX and W compared with ICE and CON.

Temperature rise due to climate change affects seasonal activity times, leading to a discordance of phenology among species and changing the strength of interaction between species. Understanding how temperature changes will affect the length of a species' activity period is essential in order to forecast its response to climate warming. 2. We investigated the thermal physiology and monthly activity of a skink from subtropical areas in Taiwan, Scincella formosensis. In addition, we predicted its response to climate warming and potential landscape vegetation changes using a mechanistic model, Niche Mapper (TM). We incorporated the animals' thermal traits and climatic data to simulate thermally suitable time for activity each month in two sites (open area, dense forest). 3. We found that this species restricts its activity to the cool months of the year, and that juveniles emerge in June. The thermally suitable period for activity is predicted to be longer in cool months than warm months. 4. Our model predicts that a 3 degrees C increase in temperature will curtail the thermally suitable time for activity in open areas in late spring and result in very minimal time for activity in the summer, even when dense forest is available.

article,Critical thermal tolerance of invasion: Comparative niche breadth of two invasive lizards,"Litmer, Allison R. and Murray, Christopher M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Understanding the evolution of thermal tolerance in ectotherms is particularly important given the current period of rapid change in the environment and thermal climate. Specifically, introduced species have the potential to evolve different thermal tolerances than native populations due to rapid evolution and novel selection pressures. Our study examined critical thermal tolerance in two introduced lizard species, the European wall lizard (Podarcis muralis) in Ohio and Kentucky, and the Mediterranean gecko (Hemidactylus turcicus) from Texas through Alabama. We tested the hypotheses that critical thermal maximum, minimum, and breadth varies among introduced populations of P. muralis and H. turcicus, and that critical thermal tolerance broadens when moving away from the introduction site, because dispersal across novel environments may remove dispersers with narrow thermal tolerances. We found that among P. muralis populations, CTmin and thermal breadth were significantly different. Specifically, when moving away from the introduction site, lizards exhibited increased cold tolerance and broader thermal breadth. Variability in thermal parameters were also lowest at the site closest to the introduction point in P. muralis. In contrast, H. turcicus had no significant differences in critical thermal minimum, maximum, or breadth among sites, or with respect to distance from introduction point. However, we did find little variability in thermal maximum, compared to greater variability in overall tolerance and critical thermal minimums. Thus, this study shows that selection on thermal tolerance and dispersal characteristics occur in novel climatic environments. Understanding how thermal tolerance changes over time can aid in predicting establishment and movement of introduced species, with applications for native species during a time of global climatic change.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102432,86,NA,NA,102432,Biogeography; Physiology; Evolution; Lizard; Introduced; Climate

Here, we explored the ranges of the preferred and avoidance temperatures of C. kolensis from two geographically isolated populations. Thermal tolerance was measured in a thermogradient installation and compared to the temperatures at which members of these populations occurred in their source waterbodies. Temperature preference was determined using the ``chronic{''} method. Individuals of C. kolensis possessed a bimodal final temperature preferendum of 2-6 degrees C and 13-21 degrees C, which corresponds to the optimal thermal conditions of the species in a pond. These ranges were the same for individuals of both populations irrespective of the geographical location and water temperature of their source waterbodies. The temperature range of normal performance was 2-4 to 21-25 degrees C, and the pessimal temperature ranges were from 1 - 2 to 3-4 degrees C and from 22-25 degrees C to 26-30 degrees C. These temperature ranges coincide with field observations over a recent 20-year period of temperature conditions under which the species develops in nature.

article,Ornate tree lizards (<i>Urosaurus ornatus</i>) thermoregulate less accurately in habitats of high thermal quality,"Lymburner, Alannah H. and Blouin-Demers, Gabriel",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature plays a critical role for ectotherm performance and thus for fitness. Ectotherms, since unable to regulate their body temperature internally, use behavioural thermoregulation to maintain their body temperature within a range that maximizes performance. According to the cost-benefit model of thermoregulation, investment into thermoregulation is dictated by the trade-off between the costs and benefits of thermoregulating. The thermal quality of the environment is a major cost of thermoregulation because it directly affects the amount of time and energy that must be invested by an individual to achieve and maintain an optimal body temperature. Thus, in habitats of poor thermal quality, lizards should thermoregulate less. Using Urosaurus ornatus living at 10 sites each straddling two adjacent habitats (wash and upland), we tested the hypothesis that investment in thermoregulation is dependent on the thermal quality of the habitat. We found that the wash habitat had higher thermal quality indicated by a longer duration when optimal body temperatures could be reached.

article,Thermal acclimation of flies from three populations of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> fails to support the seasonality hypothesis,"Angilletta, Jr., Michael J. and Condon, Catriona and Youngblood, Jacob P.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In seasonal environments, natural selection should favor genotypes that acclimate to slow and predictable changes in temperature. Selective pressure for acclimation should be especially strong for animals that complete many generations per year, because seasonal warming or cooling causes offspring to experience different temperatures than their parents did. Here, we studied variation in acclimation capacity among three populations of Drosophila melanogaster. We used a reverse acclimation design to see whether developmental acclimation persisted throughout adulthood. Flies developed from fertilization to adulthood at either 16 degrees or 26 degrees C. Then, flies either remained at the same temperature or moved to the other temperature for 7 days. We measured fecundity at seven temperatures ranging from 14 degrees to 36 degrees C. Genotypes from North Carolina and Vermont laid more eggs at 16 degrees C after spending the larval and adult stages at 16 degrees C, instead of 26 degrees C. In both populations, the benefit of acclimation to 16 degrees C during development was erased by acclimation to 26 degrees C during adulthood. In contrast to our prediction, genotypes from Indiana laid fewer eggs at 16 C or 26 degrees C after developing at this temperature. Overall, these data provide only weak support for the models of optimal acclimation in seasonal environments.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.02.009,81,NA,25-32,NA,Acclimation; Local adaptation; Plasticity; Performance curve; Temperature

C.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"We evaluated the thermotolerance (LT50) of adult green-lipped mussels (Perna canaliculus) following an acute thermal challenge in the summer of 2012 and the winter of 2013. Mussels were grouped into two treatments, naive (N, no prior heat treatment) and heat-hardened (HH = 1 h at 29 degrees C, 12 h recovery at ambient) before being immersed for 3 h in water of varying temperature, i.e. Ambient (Control), 25, 29, 31, 33, and 35 degrees C with subsequent mortality monitored for 30 days. As expected, naive mussels were less thermotolerant than heat-hardened i.e. Summer LT50, N = 31.9, HH = 33.5 degrees C; Winter LT50, N = 31.4, HH = 33.8 degrees C. Moreover, at 33 degrees C no heat-hardened mussels died compared to 100\% mortality in naive specimens. At 35 degrees C all mussels died regardless of treatment. For the `Summer' mussels, metabolite abundances in gill tissues of both naive and heat-hardened mussels were quantified. For mussels at 33 degrees C, succinic acid was significantly higher in naive mussels than heat-hardened mussels, indicating perturbations to mitochondrial pathways in these thermally stressed mussels. Additionally, analysis of biochemical pathway activity suggested a loss of neural control i.e. significantly reduced GABAergic synapse activity, in naive vs. heat-hardened mussels at 33 degrees C. Taken together these findings suggest that heat hardening improves mussel survival at higher temperatures by delaying the onset of cellular anaerobic metabolism, and by maintaining inhibition of neural pathways. Such results offer new perspectives on the complex suite of sub-cellular stress responses operating within thermally stressed organisms.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.03.006,74,NA,37-46,NA,Greenshell (TM) mussel; Acute thermal challenge; Thermal tolerance; Anaerobic metabolism

Thermal physiology plasticity may compensate for climate variation and favor performance while minimizing behavioral costs in sub-optimal conditions. The Tandilia's lizard, Liolaemus tandiliensis, occurs in an isolated mountain range of the Argentinean temperate Pampas. In this study, we compared the thermal biology of L. tandiliensis between late spring (December) and mid-summer (February). The habitats' thermal quality was lower in late spring than in mid-summer. The lizard's field-body temperature (Tb) was 2-3 degrees C higher than the operative temperature (Te). Overall, the mean preferred temperature (Tsel) was 37.4 degrees C {[}preferred range (Tset): 36.2-38.7 degrees C], and was similar to other Liolaemus species. The Tset and Tsel of females in late spring were 1.8 degrees C lower than in mid-summer. In the case of males, the Tsel did not vary among seasons, while the Tset had a difference of 2.5 degrees C between seasons. Adults were moderate thermoregulators, but females were more efficient only in late spring (E-males = 0.69; E-females = 0.58), compared to mid-summer (E-males = 0.68; E-females = 0.50). Juveniles did not show temporal differences in temperature preferences and had a relatively higher efficiency in late spring (E = 0.38) compared to mid-summer (E = 0.28). An increased proportion of juveniles and adults shifted their Tb near to the Tset in late spring respect to mid-summer. The adults also matched their preferred temperatures to their current body temperature.

Ectotherms are sensitive to temperature change and, although predictions indicate that tropical species are highly vulnerable to global warming, they remain one of the least studied groups with respect to the extent of physiological variation and local extinction risks. We model the extinction risks for a tropical heliothermic teiid lizard (Kentropyx calcarata) integrating previously obtained information on intraspecific phylogeographic structure, eco-physiological traits and contemporary species distributions in the Amazon rainforest and its ecotone to the Cerrado savannah. We also investigated how thermal-biology traits vary throughout the species' geographic range and the consequences of such variation for lineage vulnerability. We show substantial variation in thermal tolerance of individuals among thermally distinct sites. Thermal critical limits were highly correlated with operative environmental temperatures. Our physiological/climatic model predicted relative extinction risks for local populations within clades of K. calcarata for 2050 ranging between 26.1\% and 70.8\%, while for 2070, extinction risks ranged from 52.8\% to 92.8\%. Our results support the hypothesis that tropical-lizard taxa are at high risk of local extinction caused by increasing temperatures. However, the thermo-physiological differences found across the species' distribution suggest that local adaptation may allow persistence of this tropical ectotherm in global warming scenarios. These results will serve as basis to further research to investigate the strength of local adaptation to climate change. Persistence of Kentropyx calcarata also depends on forest preservation, but the Amazon rainforest is currently under high deforestation rates. We argue that higher conservation priority is necessary so the Amazon rainforest can fulfill its capacity to absorb the impacts of temperature increase on tropical ectotherms during climate change.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.01.013,73,NA,50-60,NA,Amazon; Cerrado; Ecophysiology; Global warming; Preferred temperature; Performance

However, their relationship in testes under oxidative stress is unclear. In this study, we conducted testes injection for autophagy alteration and heat exposure to reveal the interaction between autophagy and the Nrf2-antioxidant system. Male mice were injected once with normal saline as control (Cont group), autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA group) or autophagy inducer rapaihycin (Rapa group). Then, each group was divided into two parts: one received a 2-h 42 degrees C heat treatment for eight days (HT groups), and the other was kept thermal neutral (NT groups). Heat-exposed mice showed significantly increased rectal, scrotal surface and body surface temperatures. Histology of the testes revealed many vacuoles inserted in the seminiferous tubules in the HT Cont group and two 3-MA groups. Ultrastructural changes in germ cells revealed autophagosomes in two 3-MA groups. Immunohistochemical detection of Nrf2 and p62/SQSTM1 proteins showed prominent expression in Leydig cells. Heat exposure increased Nrf2 protein and mRNA levels. 3-MA and Rapa testes injection also resulted in Nrf2 cytoplasm accumulation. Massive conversion of LC3 (microtubule-associated protein light chain 3)1 to LC3II was detected in two 3-MA groups, accompanied by decreased ATG5 (autophagy related gene 5) mRNA levels in the HT 3-MA group.

It feeds on coffee plant vegetative parts and berries leading to a direct reduction in coffee yield and quality. This study aimed to determine A. thunbergii thermal requirements, and to obtain new information on the pest demography as influenced by temperature. Temperature-dependent models were developed using the Insect Life Cycle Modelling software (ILCYM) through a complete life table study at seven constant temperatures in the range 18-32 degrees C. Non-linear functions were fitted to A. thunbergii development, mortality, fecundity and senescence. Model parameters and demographic variables obtained from the models were given for each temperature and development stage. Life table parameters were estimated for nine constant temperatures, from 18 degrees C to 26 degrees C, using stochastic simulations. The minimum temperature threshold (T-min) and the thermal constant (k) for the development from egg to adult were estimated from a linear function at 12.1 degrees C and 666.67 days, respectively. The maximum temperature threshold (T-max) was estimated at 33.9 degrees C from a Logan model. The optimum temperature for immature stages' survival was estimated to be between 22.4 and 24.7 degrees C. The maximum fecundity was 147.7 eggs female(-1) at 21.2 degrees C. Simulated A. thunbergii life table parameters were affected by temperature, and the maximum value of intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) was 0.029 at 22 degrees C and 23 degrees C. In general, the life cycle data, models and demographic parameters we obtained were in line with previous reports for antestia bugs or other stink bug species.

article,Sitting in the sun: Nest microhabitat affects incubation temperatures in seabirds,"Hart, Lorinda A. and Downs, Colleen T. and Brown, Mark",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"During incubation parent birds are committed to a nest site and endure a range of ambient conditions while regulating egg temperatures. Using artificial eggs containing temperature loggers alongside ambient temperature (T-a) controls, incubation profiles were determined for four tropical seabird species at different nest site locations. Camera traps were used for ad-hoc behavioural incubation observations. Eggs experienced a range of temperatures during incubation and varied significantly between species and in some cases between different microhabitats within a species. Such variation has important consequences in the phenotypic expression of both physical and physiological traits of chicks, and ultimately species fitness. Exposed nest sites were more strongly correlated to T(a)s. Camera traps highlighted different incubation strategies employed by these species that could be related to trade-offs in predator defence, feeding habits, and temperature regulation of eggs. This study provides evidence that species with similar breeding habits could be affected by environmental stressors in similar ways and that the differences shown in nest site selection could negate some of these effects. We propose that habitats providing suitable nest microclimates will become increasingly important for the successful breeding of seabird species, particularly under predicted climate change scenarios.

article,Artificial selection on chill-coma recovery time in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>: Direct and correlated responses to selection,"Gerken, Alison R. and Mackay, Trudy F. C. and Morgan, Theodore J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Artificial selection can be used to create populations with extreme phenotypic responses to environmental stressors. When artificial selection is applied to a single component of a stress response, this selection may result in correlated responses in other stress responses, a phenomenon called cross-tolerance, which is ultimately controlled by the genetic correlations among traits. We selected for extreme responses to cold tolerance by selecting for chill-coma recovery time from a single temperate population of Drosophila melanogaster. Chill-coma recovery time is a common metric of low, but non-lethal, cold temperature tolerance. Replicated divergent artificial selection was applied to a genetically variable base population for 31 generations, resulting in two cold resistant, two cold susceptible, and two unselected control lines. To quantify the relationship between selection on chill-coma recovery and other metrics of thermal performance, we also measured survivorship after acute cold exposure, survivorship after chronic cold exposure, survivorship after cold exposure following a pre-treatment period (rapid cold hardening), starvation tolerance, and heat tolerance. We find that chill-coma recovery time is heritable within this population and that there is an asymmetric response to increased and decreased chill-coma recovery time. Surprisingly, we found no cross-tolerances between selection on chill-coma recovery time and the other environmental stress response traits. These results suggest that although artificial selection has dramatically altered chill-coma recovery time, the correlated response to selection on other stress response phenotypes has been negligible. The lack of a correlated response suggests that chill-coma recovery time in these selection lines is likely genetically independent from measures of cold survivorship tested here.

Sex, size, and diel periods had no effect on thermal occupancy of adult walleye in either lake. Thermal occupancy differed between lakes and seasons. Walleye from Lake Erie generally experienced higher temperatures throughout the spring and summer months than did walleye in Lake Huron, due to limnological differences between the lakes. Tagged walleye that remained in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron (i.e., adjacent to the release location), as opposed to those migrating to the main basin of Lake Huron, experienced higher temperatures, and thus accumulated more thermal units (the amount of temperature units amassed over time) throughout the year. Walleye that migrated toward the southern end of Lake Huron occupied higher temperatures than those that moved toward the north. Consequently, walleye that emigrated from Saginaw Bay experienced thermal environments that were more favorable for growth as they spent more time within their thermal optimas than those that remained in Saginaw Bay. Results presented in this paper provide information on the thermal experience of wild fish in a large lake, and could be used to refine sex- and lake-specific bioenergetics models of walleye in the Great Lakes to enable the testing of ecological hypotheses.

Forty-four runners performed two running tests lasting 30 min (10 min of warm-up and 20 min at 75\% of their maximal aerobic speed) with and without graduated compressive stockings. Skin temperature was measured in 12 regions of interest on the lower limb by infrared thermography before and after running. Heart rate and perception of fatigue were assessed during the last minute of the running test. Compression stockings resulted in greater increase of temperature (p=0.002 and ES=2.2, 95\% CI {[}0.11-0.45 degrees C) not only in the body regions in contact (tibialis anterior, ankle anterior and gastrocnemius) but also in the body regions that were not in contact with the garment (vastus lateralis, abductor and semitendinosus). No differences were observed between conditions in heart rate and perception of fatigue (p>0.05 and ES<0.8). In conclusion, running with graduated compression stockings produces a greater increase of skin temperature without modifying the athlete's heart rate and perception of fatigue.

However, given that temperature changes will not occur in isolation of other stressors, it is necessary to explore the potential consequences of stress on the thermal tolerances and preferences of tropical marine fish in order to understand the thresholds for survival, and predict the associated coastal ecological consequences. In this study, we used exogenous cortisol injections to investigate the effects of a thermal challenge on checkered puffers (Sphoeroides testudineus) as a secondary stressor. There were no significant differences between control and cortisol-treated fish 48 h following cortisol treatment for swimming ability (using a chase to exhaustion protocol), blood glucose concentrations or standard metabolic rate. In the lab, control and cortisol-treated puffers were exposed to ambient (29.1 +/- 1.5 degrees C), ambient +5 degrees C (heat shock) and ambient -5 degrees C (cold shock) for 4 h and to evaluate the consequences of abrupt temperature change on puff performance and blood physiology. Following cold shock, control fish exhibited increases in cortisol levels and weak `puff' performance. Conversely, fish dosed with cortisol exhibited consistently high cortisol levels independent of thermal treatment, although there was a trend for an attenuated cortisol response in the cortisol-treated fish to the cold shock treatment. A 20-day complementary field study conducted in the puffer's natural habitat, a tidal creek in Eleuthera, The Bahamas, revealed that cortisol-injected fish selected significantly cooler temperatures, measured using accumulated thermal units, when compared to controls. These results, and particularly the discrepancies between consequences documented in the laboratory and the ecological trends observed in the field, highlight the need to establish the link between laboratory and field data to successfully develop management policies and conservation initiatives with regards to anthropogenic climate change.

article,Nest temperatures in a loggerhead nesting beach in Turkey is more determined by sea surface than air temperature,"Girondot, Marc and Kaska, Yakup",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"While climate change is now fully recognised as a reality, its impact on biodiversity is still not completely understood. To predict its impact, proxies coherent with the studied ecosystem or species are thus required. Marine turtles are threatened worldwide (though some populations are recovering) as they are particularly sensitive to temperature throughout their entire life cycle. This is especially true at the embryo stage when temperature affects both growth rates and sex determination. Nest temperature is thus of prime importance to understand the persistence of populations in the context of climate change. We analysed the nest temperature of 21 loggerheads (Caretta caretta) originating from Dalyan Beach in Turkey using day-lagged generalised mixed models with autocorrelation. Surprisingly, the selected model for nest temperature includes an effect for sea surface temperature 4-times higher than for air temperature. We also detected a very significant effect of metabolic heating during development compatible with what is already known about marine turtle nests. Our new methodology allows the prediction of marine turtle nest temperatures with good precision based on a combination of air temperature measured at beach level and sea surface temperature in front of the beach. These data are available in public databases for most of the beaches worldwide. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Shade as a thermoregulatory resource for captive chimpanzees,"Duncan, Luke Mangaliso and Pillay, Neville",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In nature, the thermoregulatory strategies of species have evolved in response to the environmental conditions in which they live. Primates display extensive behavioural flexibility but few have examined the role of this behavioural flexibility with regard to thermoregulation. Chimpanzees, under free-living conditions, utilise natural vertical light/thermal gradients in rainforest canopies as a means of thermoregulation, moving along the gradient to maintain homoeostasis. In contrast, captive chimpanzees are often housed at latitudes outside their natural range under conditions that do not allow for this natural behavioural thermoregulation. We investigated the use of shade by captive chimpanzees as a behavioural thermoregulatory strategy at the Johannesburg Zoo, South Africa. We performed behavioural observations over the austral winter/spring period on a group of captive chimpanzees recording their behaviour in relation to shade use. Despite experiencing temperatures in Johannesburg below or just within their thermoneutral zone, chimpanzees consistently spent more time in shade than in direct sun. This pattern of shade use was most pronounced for the hotter midday period than for other times, was not dependent on the overall availability of shade within the enclosure and was not predicted by mean daily or hourly temperatures nor thermal maxima or minima. Instead, ultraviolet radiation and humidity levels appear to predict the observed patterns of shade utilisation and these findings suggest that chimpanzees in captivity adopt a sun-avoidance strategy, possibly as a result of the rapid heat gain associated with their dark skin and pelage. The findings suggest that chimpanzees are flexible when responding to the thermal challenges associated with housing outside of their natural environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Does shade cover availability limit nest-site choice in two populations of a turtle with temperature-dependent sex determination?,"Refsnider, Jeanine M. and Warner, Daniel A. and Janzen, Fredric J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Shifts in resource use may be an important mechanism by which organisms can adjust to novel environmental conditions, such as those imposed by climate change. However, for such shifts to be possible, environmental space must exist into which organisms can move. Habitat that ensures successful survival and reproduction is one such critical resource. We studied resource selection of shade cover over nest sites by painted turtles in populations in Illinois (center of range) and New Mexico (southern edge of range). We targeted this habitat feature because shade can influence hatching success and offspring phenotype (including sex in the study species) by affecting nest microenvironments. We found that while turtles in both populations selected nest sites that were shadier than average available sites, overall resource selection differed between the populations. This disparity may have been due to differences in structure of vegetation that provides shade at each site, because areas with high shade cover in New Mexico (low dense thickets) were much more difficult for turtles to access than those in Illinois (dense tree canopy cover). Further, shade cover predicted different parameters of incubation regime at each site, suggesting that turtles must assess dissimilar components of shade cover in order to choose nest sites and predict their future incubation regimes. Our results suggest that shade cover within nesting areas is a key component of painted turtle habitat, and that accessible, highly-shaded nest sites may be limited at the New Mexico site. Maintaining a range of shade cover from which turtles can select nest sites would permit plasticity in nest-site choice to be expressed, which may be important in preventing sex ratio skews due to climate change.

article,Effects on the thermoregulatory efficiency of two native lizards as a consequence of the habitat modification by the introduction of the exotic tree <i>Acacia longifolia</i>,"Stellatelli, Oscar A. and Vega, Laura E. and Block, Carolina and Cruz, Felix B.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Habitat modification alters several aspects of the original fauna, among them the opportunity for thermoregulation. Here, we studied the thermal biology of sympatric populations of two lizard species (Liolaemus multimaculatus and Liolaemus wiegmannii) in two different situations; a grassland without trees (natural habitat) and in a grassland plus the exotic tree Acacia longifolia (modified habitat), aiming to assess whether the structural alteration of native Pampean coastal grasslands of Argentina affects the thermal biology of these lizards. Field body temperatures, laboratory preferred temperatures, microenvironmental temperatures, operative temperatures, thermoregulatory efficiency and spatial distribution of each species were analyzed in both habitats. Environmental operative temperature was 0.64 degrees C lower in the modified habitat (Te = 38.39 degrees C) than in the natural (Te = 39.03 degrees C). Thermoregulatory efficiency (E) of L wiegmannii was lower in modified sites (E = 0.58) than in natural sites (E = 0.70). This difference may be because this lizard occupied shaded microhabitats under acacias, with suboptimal thermal features. In contrast, L multimaculatus in the modified habitat restricted its activity to open microenvironments that retained a similar structure to that of the native habitat, while maintaining high thermoregulatory efficiency in both habitat types (E-modified = 0.92; E-natural = 0.96). Although these two lizard species are phylogenetically close, they respond differently to human-induced changes in their thermal environments. The introduction of A. longifolia into coastal grasslands for L wiegmannii in particular, this introduction converts its native habitat into a suboptimal thermal environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

On the other hand, when analyzing the values difference between the average temperature at the IC of the temperature in the five evaluated ROIs on the right and left foot, the GT2DM group showed significantly lower values than the CG for for ROI 2 (forefoot) p = 0.0429 and ROI 4 (hindfoot) p = 0.009 on the right foot and for ROI 1 (forefoot) p = 0.0338; ROI 2 (forefoot) p = 0.0392 and ROI 5 (hindfoot) p = 0.0377 on the left foot. In conclusion, GT2DM presented a Tskin\_Feet closer to the core temperature (IC) indicating a higher temperature.

article,Assessment of the effects of heat stress on the production of dairy cows by using two comfort thermal indices in Southern Chile,"Arias, Rodrigo A. and Soto, Fernando and Keim, Juan Pablo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Heat stress has been recognized as a serious problem in dairy farms around the world due to the increasing heat waves and higher genetic potential of dairy cows. In Chile, milk production is concentrated in the southern regions of the country, where animals graze all year around, consequently being exposed directly to environmental conditions. Nevertheless, there are few studies conducted in Chile that have evaluated at the commercial level the impact of heat stress on milk production. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of summer conditions, across periods, on the milk production of cows at different stages of lactation in a dairy farm located in Southern Chile. Daily meteorological and milk yield records of three summers from a dairy farm were collected to characterize the relationship between two thermal stress indices and milk yield. The thermal comfort indices used were the comprehensive climate index (CCI), and the adjusted temperature humidity index (THIadj). The average values of CCI and THIadj were dependent on the period (P < 0.0001) with maximum CCI of 40.2 degrees C, 31.7 degrees C, and 27.5 degrees C for the 2012-2013, 2015-2016, and 2016-2017 periods, respectively. A similar response was recorded when THIadj was used (85.5, 78.0, and 73.9, respectively). In the 2012-2013 summer, 44.4\% of the days presented conditions of heat stress (CCI >= 23), a value that fell to 26.7\% in the summer of 2015-2016 and only 5.6\% in the 2016-2017. On the opposite, when the THIadj was used, these values were 50\%, 48.9\%, and 5.6\%, respectively. In conclusion, both comfort thermal indices are good tools to determine the risk of thermal stress in dairy cows, with a large variation between the three summer periods but also between indices. Likewise, cows in the early and mid-lactation periods are more affected in terms of milk yield.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103942,124,NA,NA,103942,Heat waves; Animal welfare; Milk yield; Thermoregulation; Thermoneutrality

All groups performed incremental load tests (ILT) in both environments before (pre-ET) and after four and eight weeks of ET. In the pre-ET period, H impaired (similar to 30 \%) performance variables (maximum speed and external work) and increased (1.3 degrees C) maximum abdominal body temperature compared with T. In T, after four weeks, although ET/H exercised at a lower (similar to 30 \%) absolute intensity than ET/T, performance variables and aerobic power (peak oxygen uptake, VO2peak) were similarly increased in both ET groups compared with SED/T. After eight weeks, the external work was higher in both ET groups compared with SED/T. Only ET/T significantly increased VO2peak (similar to 11 \%) relative to its pre-ET period. In H, only after eight weeks, both ET groups improved (similar to 19 \%) maximum speed and reduced (similar to 46 \%) post-ILT blood lactate concentrations compared with their respective pre-ET values. Liver glycogen content increased (34 \%) in both ET groups and SED/H compared with SED/T. Thus, ET/H was performed at a lower absolute intensity but promoted similar effects to ET/T on metabolism, aerobic power, and running performance.

Notably, the time series analysis of core body temperature fluctuations may indicate thermoregulation alterations. This study aims to assess the effects of oxytocin on changes in the core body temperature by analyzing the fluctuations of the temperature time series of endotoxemic rats.Twelve hours of continuous core body temperature fluctuations time series were obtained from adult male Dark Agouti rats implanted with a telemetric transmitter under the following treatment: lipopolysaccharide (LPS); oxytocin (O); lipopolysaccharide + oxytocin (LPS + O), and vehicle or control (C). The temperature fluctuations time series were analyzed using the Extended Poincare ` Plot Analysis (EPPA), a novel approach for measuring nonlinear features, to compute the autocorrelation by Pearson's correlation coefficient r, the standard deviation perpendicular to the line of identity (SD1), and the standard deviation parallel to the line of identity (SD2).The autocorrelation of the temperature fluctuations assessed by Pearson's coefficient was significantly higher in the LPS group compared to control rats (C). Likewise, the co-administration of oxytocin during endotoxemia (LPS + O) significantly reduced the autocorrelation and increased the short-term variability (SD1) of temperature fluctuations compared to those recorded with a single dose of LPS. Thus, we concluded that oxytocin may introduce thermoregulatory changes under LPS-induced endotoxemia. The EPPA is a simple and powerful approach to assess physiological variability that can provide valuable insights into changes in thermoregulation.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103756,119,NA,NA,103756,Temperature fluctuations; Endotoxemia; Oxytocin; LPS; Poincareanalysis

The species' metabolic changes during subzero exposure remain unclear. Therefore, we exposed B. pulchella to cooling and recovery, assessing plasma and tissue metabolite changes. Cooling significantly reduced urea concentrations in plasma (P = 0.033), muscle (P = 0.001), heart (P = 0.009), and brain (P = 0.041) compared to acclimation.

This study investigated the influences of microenvironmental factors around a waterbody on thermal perceptions, using questionnaires and meteorological measurements at the Central Lake of Southwest University of Science and Technology (SWUST) in Mianyang. Microenvironmental factors included sky view factor (SVF) and distance from the lake (DFL). It was found that people felt most comfortable in the shade of trees although some volunteers voted artificial canopy as their preferred thermal adaptation element. In addition, a linear regression yielded an NT of 28.44 \& DEG;C in Mianyang during the summer of 2022. There were NT variations among different measurement sites (e.g., on the east shore, it was 28.18 \& DEG;C on the waterside, 27.11 \& DEG;C away from the lake, and 25.53 \& DEG;C far from the lake; while it was 27.57 \& DEG;C under the tree crown, 25.11 \& DEG;C on the lawn, and 29.13 \& DEG;C in the square). This variation may be due to human adaptation towards microenvironmental factors and their effects on microclimate. The variation in thermal responses owing to microenvironmental differences (different NTs at various types of sites) might be a novel finding in the field of OTC.

We explored the relationship between frequency of burrow use and environmental conditions, including burrow and surface temperatures, relative tidal height, and time of day, by twenty male M. pugnax in breeding areas around Flax Pond, New York, USA. We found a highly significant positive correlation between burrow use and surface temperature, with a clear shift to longer times underground above 32 degrees C degrees. We also experimentally heated live crabs in the laboratory and allowed them to retreat into cooled artificial burrows while continuously measuring Tb. Laboratory data on cooling times were compared to field observations of burrow retreat durations. The median burrow duration in the field of 2.74 min was enough time for our laboratory crabs to capture over 70\% of the cooling potential of artificial burrows 10 or 15 degrees C below Tb. Because crab bodies in burrows experience exponential declines in Tb due to Newton's law of cooling, there are diminishing returns to remaining in a burrow, and many crabs probably leave before coming to equilibrium. For M. pugnax, burrow retreats reduce time spent feeding and courting, activities that only occur on the surface. Current concerns about the impacts of climate change on animals include whether compensatory mechanisms, like more frequent and longer burrow retreats, will come at the cost of other behaviors necessary for survival and reproduction.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103639,116,NA,NA,103639,NA
article,Bat-derived cells use glucose as a cryoprotectant,"Nemcova, Monika and Seidlova, Veronika and Zukal, Jan and Dundarova, Heliana and Bednarikova, Sarka and Pikula, Jiri",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Evolution of heterothermy in environments with variable temperatures has allowed bats to survive food scarcity during seasonal climatic extremes by using torpor as a hibernation strategy. The controlled reduction of body temperature and metabolism through complex behavioural and physiological adaptations at organismal, organ, cellular and molecular levels includes the ability of tissues and cells to adapt to temperature alterations. Based on the prediction that cells of different tissues cultured in vitro would differ in their ability to withstand freezing and thawing of the medium, we determined the survival rate of bat-derived cells following exposure to -20 degrees C for 24 h in media with no cryoprotective agents or medium supplemented by glucose in concentration range 0-3333 mM. Cell survival rates were determined in relation to availability of glucose in the medium, organ origin, cell concentration and bat species. In general, increased glucose helped cells survive at sub-zero temperatures, though concentrations up to 80-fold higher than those found in chiropterans were needed. However, cells in glucose-free phosphate buffered saline also survived, suggesting that other mechanisms may be contributing to cell survival at low temperatures. Highest in vitro viability was observed in nervus olfactorius-derived cell cultures, with high survival rates and rapid re-growth under optimal conditions after exposure to -20 degrees C. Kidney cells from different bat species showed comparable overall survival rate patterns, though smaller chiropteran species appeared to utilise lower glucose levels as a cryoprotectant than larger species. Our in vitro data provide evidence that cells of heterothermic bats can survive sub-zero temperatures and that higher glucose levels in important tissues significantly improve hibernation survival at extremely low temperatures.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103652,115,NA,NA,103652,Heterothermy; Hibernation; In vitro model; Cell culture; Cryoprotectant; Glucose
article,Thyroid hormone manipulation influences development of endothermy and hatching in white leghorn chickens (Gallus gallus),"Rippamonti, Jessica and Dzialowski, Edward M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Chickens experience rapid change in their physiology and metabolism during hatching. We propose that thyroid hormones play a major role in regulating the developmental changes associated with attaining endothermy. To better understand the role thyroid hormones play in hatch timing and development of thermogenic capacity and metabolic rate we manipulated plasma thyroid hormone levels in chicken embryos beginning at 80\% development (day 17 of a 21-day incubation) with either a single dose of triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) or the thyroperoxidase inhibitor methimazole (MMI). Manipulation of thyroid hormones altered the timing of hatching, accelerating hatching under hyperthyroid conditions, and prolonging hatching with hypothyroid conditions. Effect sizes comparisons of morphological variables between treatment groups revealed larger heart and body masses in hyperthyroid 1-day post hatch animals. Thyroid hormone manipulation influenced the thermal neutral zone for O2 consumption and body temperature during gradual cooling from 35 to 15 degrees C of externally pipped embryos and 1-day post hatch chicks. Hyperthyroid EP animals had a wider thermal neutral zone during cooling when compared to control animals. At the temperatures tested, the hypothyroid animals did not exhibit a thermal neutral zone. Similar differences between treatments in the breadth of the thermal neutral zone carried through to 1-day post hatch chickens. These findings suggest that thyroid manipulations influence the timing and development of the animal's thermogenic response to cooling.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103582,114,NA,NA,103582,Gallus gallus; Thyroid hormone; Endothermy; Development

Three international walkers performed a rectangular test, where body temperature was measured at rest, and after the 5th, 10th and 15th run using an infrared thermographic camera in room temperatures at 17 and 28 degrees C.

One-day-old Ross 308 male broiler chickens (n = 1200) were reared using standard management practices. On d 22 of age, birds were divided into 2 main groups and kept either under thermoneutral temperature (21 +/- 1 degrees C) or chronic heat stress (30 +/- 1 degrees C). Each group was further divided into 2 sub-groups and fed either the control diet (Con) or the casein (3 g/kg) supplemented diet (CAS). The study consisted of four treatments; each treatment was replicated 12 times with 25 birds per replicate. The treatments were as follow; CCon: control temperature + control diet, CCAS: control temperature + casein diet, HCon: heat stress + control diet, and HCAS: heat stress + casein diet. The casein and heat stress protocols were applied from d 22 to d 35 of age. Casein increased the growth performance of the HCAS (P < 0.05) when compared to the HCon. Additionally, the maximum feed conversion efficiency was exhibited (P < 0.05) by the HCAS. Compared with CCon, heat stress increased (P < 0.05) the levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Casein lowered (P < 0.05) the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and increased (P < 0.05) the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines in response to heat exposure. Heat stress decreased (P < 0.05) villus height, crypt depth, villus surface area, and absorptive epithelial cell area. Casein increased (P < 0.05) villus height, crypt depth, villus surface area, and absorptive epithelial cell area in CCAS and HCAS. Furthermore, casein improved intestinal microflora balance by enhancing (P < 0.05) the growth of intestinal beneficial bacteria and decreasing (P < 0.05) the intestinal colonization with the pathogenic bacteria.

Preserving vegetation by establishing protected areas may mitigate these effects. We used remote sensing to test these ideas in the Sierra de Huautla Biosphere Reserve (REBIOSH) and surrounding areas. First, we determined whether vegetation cover was higher in the REBIOSH compared to adjacent unprotected areas to the north (NAA) and south (SAA). Then, we used a mechanistic niche model to test whether simulated Sceloporus horridus lizards in the REBIOSH experienced a cooler microclimate, higher thermal safety margin, longer foraging duration, and lower basal metabolic rate compared to adjacent unprotected areas. We compared these variables between 1999, when the reserve was declared, and 2020. We found that vegetation cover increased from 1999 to 2020 in all three areas; it was higher in the REBIOSH than in the more anthropized NAA, and was intermediate in the less anthropized SAA in both years. The microclimate temperature decreased from 1999 to 2020 and was lower in the REBIOSH and SAA than in the NAA. Thermal safety margin increased from 1999 to 2020; it was higher in the REBIOSH than in the NAA and intermediate in the SAA. Foraging duration increased from 1999 to 2020 and was similar among the three polygons. Basal metabolic rate decreased from 1999 to 2020 and was higher in the NAA than in the REBIOSH and SAA. Our results suggest that the REBIOSH provides cooler microclimates that increase the thermal safety margin and lower the metabolic rate of this generalist lizard compared to the NAA, and that the REBIOSH could contribute to increased vegetation cover in its surroundings.

From a physiological standpoint, higher temperatures often enhance biological processes that can induce the production of reactive oxygen species and result in a state of cellular oxidative stress. Temperature alters interspecific interactions, including species hybridization. Hybridization under different thermal conditions could amplify parental (genetic) incompatibilities, thus affecting a hybrid's development and distribution. Understanding the impact of global warming on the physiology of hybrids and particularly their oxidative status could help in predicting future scenarios in ecosystems and in hybrids. In the present study, we investigated the effect of water temperature on the development, growth and oxidative stress of two crested newt species and their reciprocal hybrids. Larvae of Triturus macedonicus and T. ivanbureschi, and their T. macedonicus-mothered and T. ivanbureschi-mothered hybrids were exposed for 30 days to temperatures of 19 degrees C and 24 degrees C. Under the higher temperature, the hybrids experienced increases in both growth and developmental rates, while parental species exhibited accelerated growth (T. macedonicus) or development (T. ivanbureschi). Warm conditions also had different effects on the oxidative status of hybrid and parental species. Parental species had enhanced antioxidant responses (catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione Stransferase and SH groups), which allowed them to alleviate temperature-induced stress (revealed by the absence of oxidative damage). However, warming induced an antioxidant response in the hybrids, including oxidative damage in the form of lipid peroxidation. These findings point to a greater disruption of redox regulation and metabolic machinery in hybrid newts, which can be interpreted as the cost of hybridization that is likely linked to parental incompatibilities expressed under a higher temperature. Our study aims to improve mechanistic understanding of the resilience and distribution of hybrid species that cope with climate-driven changes.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103474,112,NA,NA,103474,Amphibians; Antioxidant system; Hybridization; Global warming; Oxidative status; Triturus

Subcutaneous adipocytes from Simental cattle (Bos taurus) were then isolated and cultured at a normal body temperature (37 degrees C) and at a cold temperature (31 degrees C) in vitro. In the in vivo study, cold exposure stimulated subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) browning by reducing adipocyte sizes and up-regulating the expression levels of browning-specific makers (UCP1, PRDM16, and PGC-1 alpha) in cattle. In addition, cold-exposed cattle displayed lower lipogenesis transcriptional regulator levels (PPAR gamma and CEBP alpha) and higher lipolysis regulator levels (HSL) in sWAT. In the in vitro study, cold temperature inhibited subcutaneous white adipocytes (sWA) adipogenic differentiation by reducing lipid contents and decreasing the expression of adipogenic marker genes and proteins. Furthermore, cold temperature led to sWA browning which was characterized by increased browning-related genes, mitochondrial contents, and mitochondrial biogenesis-specific markers. In addition, p38 MAPK signaling pathway activity was stimulated by the incubation in cold temperature for 6 h in sWA. We concluded that the cold-induced browning of the subcutaneous white fat was beneficial to the production of heat and the maintenance of body temperature regulation in cattle.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103446,112,NA,NA,103446,Cold temperature; Subcutaneous white adipose tissue; Adipocytes; Browning; Thermogenesis; Mitochondrial biogenesis

article,"Thermal tolerance of western corn rootworm: Critical thermal limits, knock-down resistance, and chill coma recovery","Roeder, Karl A. and Daniels, Jesse D.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, is one of the most economically important crop pests in the world with estimates of damage and control approximating over \$1 billion USD annually. Despite an abundance of research devoted to studying rootworm biology in the central Corn Belt of the United States, key aspects on their thermal ecology are still lacking. Here we address this knowledge gap by measuring critical thermal limits, knock-down resistance, and chill coma recovery. In doing so, we also address methodological questions sur-rounding measurements of thermal tolerance using a variety of dynamic and static assays. The average critical thermal maxima across all trials was 43.0 degrees C, while the average critical thermal minima was 2.5 degrees C. Critical thermal limits were relatively invariant across all treatments except at faster ramping rates. Knock-down resis-tance decreased with increasing temperature as survival dropped from 100\% at 39 degrees C to 0\% within 10 min at 44 degrees C. Recovery from chill coma increased by 1.62 min for each hour of exposure at 0 degrees C, while survival decreased by 50\% after only 24 h. Combined, our results present the first composite picture of different thermal traits for western corn rootworm, which will be vital for predicting their survival and potential spread under future climate change scenarios.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103338,109,NA,NA,103338,CTmax; CTmin; Diabrotica virgifera virgifera; Ramping rate; Temperature

The combined effects of high temperature and endotoxemia on bovine monocyte-derived macrophages remain almost undisclosed. This study aims to unravel the molecular and functional responses of bovine monocyte-derived macrophages to thermal cum lipopolysaccharide induced stress challenge in vitro. The cells were incubated at 37 degrees C or 40 degrees C with lipopolysaccharide (1.0 mu g/mL) for 24 h and 48 h. At the end of each treatment, cell viability, apoptotic rate, mitochondrial membrane potential, oxidative activity, phagocytosis, and autophagy functions were assessed and mRNA abundance of genes related to heat shock (HSP 70), inflammation (IL1 beta, IL6, IL 12, TNF, INF gamma), cell signalling (TLR4), cell viability (Bax, Bcl2), nitric oxide synthesis (NOS2) and natural resistant associated macrophage protein were quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The results revealed the increased apoptosis, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, and cell viability, decreased oxidative and phagocytosis ability in cells co-stimulated with LPS and thermal stimuli. Upregulation of HSP 70 gene and downregulation of natural resistant associated macrophage protein, cell signalling, and inflammation related genes mRNA expressions were also identified due to these stressors.

Here we investigated how the capacity for temperature-induced developmental plasticity varies with latitude and whether population-specific biogeographic background accounts for the different degree of plastic responses to temperature. We carried out a combined analysis based on the data from 150 studies (93 articles) performed on 64 amphibian species. We collected empirical data for age and size at metamorphosis in amphibian larvae acclimated to different temperatures during development and found that all larvae from all populations in these studies revealed a change in metamorphic traits with a given change in temperature and thus, were able to exhibit temperature-induced developmental plasticity. Age at metamorphosis was more affected by temperature than size at metamorphosis. Age and size at the onset of metamorphosis were generally lowest at warmest temperatures during development. Furthermore, populations from tropical latitudes were less sensitive to a change in developmental temperature compared to populations from higher latitudes. Accordingly, we suggest tropical populations to be the most vulnerable to increasing temperatures during metamorphosis. Our analyses reveal biases with respect to taxonomy, biogeographic distribution of species, and study design. Data from tropical populations are underrepresented and thus, the capacity for developmental plasticity of the most threatened species probably remains poorly understood. Future studies should focus on under-represented regions, most threatened species, and include a broader range of temperatures during development in order to make robust projections on future sensitivity of populations to climate change.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103233,106,NA,NA,103233,Phenotypic plasticity; Climate change; Metamorphosis Conservation physiology; Temperature-size-rule; Taxonomic bias

However, one unclear aspect is whether females may use male temperature to discriminate sick from healthy partners. We tested this by using Tenebrio molitor beetles whose females use the intensity of male antennal and leg stroking that take place during mating, to discriminate among partners. We predicted that females will not choose males that are too hot and/or will penalize these male partners in terms of a reduced egg number and hatching success. We manipulated males by infecting them with an entomopathogenic fungus, and exposed these males versus control males to females. Infected and non-infected males increased their temperature during copulation but females did not choose on the basis of male's temperature or infection status. However, females laid fewer eggs and/or had a reduced hatching success after mating with infected males that had a body temperature higher than ca. 24 ?.

Dietary betaine has received a lot of attention owing to its osmoprotectant, methionine-sparing and antioxidant properties. Betaine is extensively assessed concerning performance and body composition. The tolerance to high temperatures, flock livability, and breast meat output is among the factors frequently mentioned in the literature as being altered by betaine. Betaine, a multi-nutritional agent, may help poultry resist heat stress and poor management. A common subject of betaine research is the idea of betaine saving some methionine. Although research on betaine may not always come to the same results, some discoveries repeat themselves. Because of their effectiveness in increasing growth performance, feed utilization, meat quality, and alleviating heat stress in chicken farms, betaine and methionine are extensively used as feed supplements in poultry diets.

Shrews are among the smallest of mammals and have adopted different behavioral and physiological strategies to deal with cold temperatures. In this study, we assessed the use of an external heat source in the thermoregulatory strategy of two Crocidurinae species, Crocidura russula and C. suaveolens, and one Soricinae species, Sorex araneus. Crocidura russula inhabits western Europe and is better adapted to a Mediterranean climate; C. suaveolens inhabits central Europe; and S. araneus inhabits northern Europe and is better adapted to a Palearctic climate. We predicted that C. russula (most southern species) would spend larger amounts of time using an external heat source because it is the most cold-sensitive species, while S. araneus (most northern species) would spend less time using an external heat source or not respond to it. Shrews were experimentally tested in captivity inside a terrarium where they had access to a heat rock, which could be turned off (cold) or on (heated), depending on treatment. Our results confirmed our initial prediction: C. russula was the species that spent significantly more time on the heated rock, followed by C. suaveolens. Only a quarter of S. araneus individuals spent large amounts of time on the heat rock, which suggests this thermoregulation strategy is not generally adopted by this species, but may be rather associated with some individual personalities. We also analyzed the influence of the heat rock on rewarming from heterothermy, but heterothermy was not different between rock treatments. Overall, our results show that shrew species use external heat sources for thermoregulation according to their sensitivity to cold.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103193,104,NA,NA,103193,Basking behavior; Behavioral thermoregulation; Heat rock; Individual plasticity; Soricidae; Thermal preference

Delta 9 desaturase catalyzes the synthesis of oleic acid from stearic acid by introducing double bonds in the 9th and 10th carbon chains, thereby increasing the content of MUFAs in the body. In order to explore the main function of the Delta 9 desaturase gene under low temperature stress, RACE-PCR technology was used in this study to clone the full-length sequence of the CqFAD9-like from the hepatopancreas of red claw crayfish, Cherax quadricarinatus. The full length of the sequence is 1236 bp, and the open reading frame is 1041 bp, encoding 346 amino acid residues. The 5 `UTR is 116 bp, the 3'UTR is 79 bp, and the 3'UTR contains a PloyA tail. The predicted theoretical isoelectric point and molecular weight are 8.68 and 40.28 kDa, respectively. Homology analysis showed that the sequence had the highest similarity with FAD9 from crustaceans. The results of real-time PCR showed that the expression level of this gene was highest in the hepatopancreas, which was significantly higher than other tissues, followed by the ovaries, brain ganglion and stomach. At the same time, the expression of the CeAD9-like in hepatopancreas of crayfish cultured at 25, 20, 15 and 9 degrees C for four weeks was detected. The results showed that expression of the FAD9 gene increased gradually with decreasing temperature, indicating that metabolic desaturation might play a regulatory role during cold stress.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103122,102,NA,NA,103122,Cherax quadricarinatus; Delta 9 fatty acid desaturase; Molecular cloning; Cold stress; Expression analysis

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are currently believed to have anti-inflammation and immunomodulatory effects. Therefore, we aimed to explore the protective effect and mechanism of MSCs on heat stroke induced excessive inflammation and neurological dysfunction. We established a heat stroke model in rats under conditions of continuous high temperature and high humidity. After modeling, rats were randomly divided into heat stroke model group, MSCs treatment group and normal temperature control group without any treatment. We performed survival analysis, neurological deficit score, histological staining of hippocampus and cerebellum, immunofluorescence staining of microglia, detection of inflammatory and chemokine levels in the hippocampus and cerebellum in each group. We found that MSCs treatment not only significantly reduced early (day 3) and late (day 28) mortality, but also prominently reduced nerve injury in heat stroke rats, and improved pathology and neuronal cell damage in the hippocampus and cerebellum. In addition, MSCs treatment can significantly inhibit the over-activation of hippocampal microglia in heat stroke rats and the levels of pro inflammatory factors and chemokines in the hippocampus. Early treatment of MSCs can greatly promote the activation of cerebellar microglia in heat stroke rats. Meanwhile, MSCs treatment has an inhibitory effect on the level of chemokine in the cerebellum of rats in the early stage of heat stroke. In conclusion, the application of MSCs in the treatment of heat stroke in rats can significantly reduce mortality and neurological deficits and improve hippocampal damage, possibly by inhibiting the excessive activation of hippocampal microglia in heat stroke rats.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103081,101,NA,NA,103081,Mesenchymal stem cells; Heat stroke; Microglia cells; Hippocampal; Central nervous system
article,Testicular thermoregulation with respect to spermatogenesis and contraception,"Pham, Stephanie and Schultz, Jerome S.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"There has been some evidence that a short heating exposure of the testicles can lead to temporary sterility. However, little attention has been paid to analyzing the temperature/time pattern throughout the testicle and how metabolism and blood perfusion affect the temperature profile. We use the Penne bioheat equation that accounts for the elements of conduction, perfusion, and metabolism along with the COMSOL Finite Element Method for the analysis of this thermoregulation problem. Typically, the testicles were modeled as two uniform spheres and exposed to an increase in surface temperature of 42 degrees C for 30 min. We found that heat produced by tissue metabolism had a minor effect on the temperature pattern. However, blood flow from the core (at 37 degrees C) could prevent the region where the testicles touch each other from reaching the target temperature of 42 degrees C. Further, we found that for animals, as rodents and monkeys that are used for contraception studies, the temperature distribution on heating testicles is much more uniform than for humans. Thus, extrapolation results from animal models to humans should be done with caution.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102954,99,NA,NA,102954,Testicle; Heat; Spermogenesis

The latencies to open the cones (R and UR) and proportion of cones opened were recorded. A long-lasting effect was tested a week after exposure to TR. TR had a significant effect on RT, WT and ET. The motivation to turn over R cones was weaker in birds exposed to 36-38 degrees C than birds exposed to 22-24 degrees C. Also, the proportion of R cones opened were fewer in birds that experienced TR of 36-38 degrees C compared to birds exposed to 22-24 degrees C and 30-32 degrees C specifically on two out of the three cognitive test days (Days 1 and 3). Latency and proportion of UR cones opened was not affected by TR. RT, WT and ET were all negatively and significantly correlated with latency to open the UR cones.

The mRNA expression of the GABAA receptors, GABAAR-alpha 1 and GABAAR-gamma, but not that of GABABR, significantly decreased in the diencephalon after central injection of taurine. Subsequently, we found that picrotoxin, a GABAAR antagonist, attenuated taurine-induced hypothermia.

article,A mathematical model to investigate heat transfer in footwear during walking and jogging,"Nemati, H. and Moghimi, M. A. and Naemi, Roozbeh",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Foot temperature during activities of daily living affects the human performance and well-being. Footwear thermal characteristics affect the foot temperature inside the shoe during activities of daily living. The temperate at the sole of the foot (plantar temperature) is influenced by different thermal properties such as heat capacity, heat diffusivity, and thermal conductivity of the shoe sole in addition to its mechanical properties. Hence the purpose of this study was to propose a method to allow investigating the effect of footwear thermal characteristics on the foot temperature during activities of daily living, like walking or jogging. The transient heat transfer between the foot and the ground was studied to drive the governing equation for heat transfer modelling in footwear and to predict foot sole temperature during walking, and jogging. Different thermo-mechanical properties of shoe sole, as well as geometrical parameters, were investigated. The proposed model showed to be able to adequately predict the plantar temperature at the ball of the foot when compared to the results from experimental measurements. Finally, using the proposed method, the thermal behaviour of two different shoes with two different sole materials EVA08 and EVA12 were compared. It was shown that heat capacity as compared to the thermal conductivity of the shoe sole is more effective in reducing the plantar temperature increase in short term. The proposed method proved to be able to accurately predict the thermal behaviour of shoes and can provide a tool to predict footwear thermal comfort.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102778,97,NA,NA,102778,Footwear; Thermal comfort; Heat transfer; Foot sole temperature; Plantar soft tissue

As a result, animals regulate their body temperature and adapt to different environmental conditions through various physiological strategies. These adaptations are crucial in all organisms, although they are more relevant in those that have reached a great adaptive diversity such as scorpions. Within scorpions, the genus Urophonius presents species with winter activity, being this a peculiarity within the Order and an opportunity to study the strategies deployed by these organisms when facing different temperatures. Here, we explore three basic issues of lipid remodeling under high and low temperatures, using adults and juveniles of Urophonius achalensis and U. brachycentrus. First, as an indicator of metabolic state, we analyzed the lipidic changes in different tissues observing that low temperatures generate higher quantities of triacylglycerols and fewer amount of structural lipids and sphyngomielin. Furthermore, we studied the participation of fatty acids in adaptive homeoviscosity, showing that there are changes in the quantity of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids at low temperature (mainly 16:0, 18:0, 18:1 and 18:2). Finally, we observe that there are quantitative and qualitative variations in the cuticular hydrocarbons (with possible water barrier and chemical recognition function).

In this study, the rapid amplification of cDNA ends was used to obtain a full-length cDNA of the turbot p53 gene (Sm-p53) and perform bioinformatics analysis. The results showed that the cDNA of the Sm-p53 gene was 2928 bp in length, encoded a 381 amino acid protein, with a theoretical isoelectric point of 6.73. It was composed of a DNA binding and a tetramerization domain. Expression of Sm-p53 in different tissues was detected and quantified by qRT-PCR, and was highest in the liver. We also investigated the expression profiles of Sm-p53 in different tissue and TK cells after thermal stress. These result suggested that Sm-p53 plays a key role, and provides a theoretical basis for Sm-p53 changes in environmental stress responses in the turbot.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102560,90,NA,NA,102560,Sm-p53; Thermal stress; DNA damage; Apoptosis; Turbot Scophthalmus maximus

Increased water temperature up-regulates oxygen consumption and metabolic rates, and alters the physiological processes. In this study, we identified the critical thermal maxima (CTmax) and physiological responses under normoxia and hypoxia in Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus. CTmax was 41.25 degrees C under hypoxia and 44.50 degrees C under normoxia. Compared to normoxia, lower values of hemoglobin (Hb) and red blood cells (RBCs) were observed at the CTmax under hypoxia. In contrast, higher values of white blood cells (WBCs) and blood glucose (Glu) levels were observed at the CTmax under hypoxia. Consequently, higher frequencies of micronucleus, cellular and nuclear abnormalities of erythrocytes were observed at the CTmax under hypoxia. These results suggest that high temperature tolerance and subsequent physiology are significantly affected by the oxygen supply in Nile tilapia.

article,Effects of constant and fluctuating incubation temperatures on hatching success and hatchling traits in the diamondback terrapin (<i>Malaclemys terrapin</i>) in the context of the warming climate,"Rowe, Christopher L. and Liang, Dong and Woodland, Ryan J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"As global temperatures continue to rise, so too will the nest temperatures of many species of turtles. Yet for most turtle species, including the estuarine diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin), there is limited information on embryonic sensitivity to elevated temperature. We incubated eggs of M. terrapin at three, mean temperatures (31, 34, 37 degrees C) under two thermal exposure regimes (constant or semi-naturally fluctuating temperature) and measured hatching success, developmental rate, and hatchling size. Hatching success was 100\% at 31 degrees C and 67\% at 34 degrees C, respectively; at 37 degrees C, all eggs failed early in the incubation period. These values were unaffected by exposure regime. The modeled LT50 (temperature that was lethal to 50\% of the test population) was 34.0 degrees C in the constant and 34.2 degrees C in the fluctuating thermal regime, reflecting a steep decline in survival between 33 and 35 degrees C. Hatchlings having been incubated at a constant 34 degrees C hatched sooner than those incubated at 31 degrees C under either constant or fluctuating temperature. Hatchlings were smaller in straight carapace length (CL) and width after having been incubated at 34 degrees C compared to 31 degrees C. Larger (CL) hatchlings resulted from fluctuating temperature conditions relative to constant temperature conditions, regardless of mean temperature. Based upon recent temperatures in natural nests, the M. terrapin population studied here appears to possess resiliency to several degrees of elevated mean nest temperatures, beyond which, embryonic mortality will likely sharply increase. When considered within the mosaic of challenges that Maryland's M. terrapin face as the climate warms, including ongoing habitat losses due to sea level rise and impending thermal impacts on bioenergetics and offspring sex ratios, a future increase in embryonic mortality could be a critical factor for a population already experiencing ecological and physiological challenges due to climate change.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102528,88,NA,NA,102528,Climate change; Global warming; Hatching success; Incubation; Lethal temperature; Thermal tolerance

Five healthy dromedary bulls (400 kg and 4 years-old) were used to examine the interrelationship of sweating rate (SR) with ten thermal parameters measured (and/or estimated) every 3-hr for a 24-hr time period under natural and shaded environmental conditions, in order to subsequently identify the potential thermal drivers of sudomotor in this species. Results revealed that all parameters, including SR, had clearly (P < 0.001) exhibited monophasic circadian rhythms. Moreover, the obtained findings pointed out that strong/moderate positive correlations were existed between SR and eight parameters {[}i.e. ambient (T-a) rectal (T-r), body (T-b), skin (T-sk), coat (T-ct) temperatures as well as total (ambient-to-body, BTG(ex)), external (ambient-to-skin, BTG(ex)), and internal (skin-to-body, BTG(in)) body thermal gradients] suggesting that they may all be good indicators of sweating activity. Nonetheless, out of those highly-correlated parameters, merely six (i.e. T-a, T-b, T-sk, BTG(t), and BTG(ex)) showed superior coefficients of determination (R-2 >= 0.90; P < 0.000) when interrelated with SR; thereby, implying that they have the potential to drive sudomotor. Notably, however, results were more probably allude that sudomotor is regulated through BTG,. Accordingly, the onset of sweating (i.e. threshold) and its effective level was determined using BTG(t). A method of how SR can be regulated through BTG(t)was proposed according to Webb's theory of controlling body-heat content. Some shortcomings prevent confirming that BTG(t) is the best thermal driver of sudomotor in this species were noted.

Our objective was to investigate the association between meteorological variables and ambulance attendance in the event of cardiovascular diseases using time-series analyses. We used a time series analysis to investigate the relationship between meteorological variables and ambulance attendance in the event of cardiovascular diseases from 2010 to 2015. To examine the effect of high temperatures on ambulance attendance, we investigated the relative risk of the daily volume of high temperature attendance, the 99th temperature percentile compared to the 75th temperature percentile. Upon examining the effect of cold temperatures on ambulance attendance, or the relative risk of the daily volume of attendance with low temperatures, the 1st temperature percentile compared to the 25th temperature percentile. In 1826 days, from March 21, 2010 to March 19, 2015, there were 7051 emergency calls for cardiovascular diseases. Significant variations were identified in the monthly (P < 0.001) and seasonal (P < 0.001) distributions. The highest seasonal incidence occurred in the winter and lowest was observed in the summer. With regard to association between cold temperature and calls for ambulance attendance in the event of cardiovascular diseases according to lag days, our findings showed a significant increase in lag 7 ((RR, 1.026; 95\% CI, 1.003 to 1.050), lag 8 (RR, 1.023; 95\% CI, 1.005 to 1.041) and lag 9 (RR, 1.019; 95\% CI, 1.002 to 1.036) respectively.

article,Repeatability of thermal reaction norms for spontaneous locomotor activity in juvenile newts,"Baskiera, Senka and Gvozdik, Lumir",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Locomotor activity is a major attribute of animals. Although this trait determines important ecological processes, such as dispersal and species interactions, the sources of its variation are not fully understood. We examined the influence of body temperature (13, 18, 23, and 28 degrees C) and individual identity on spontaneous locomotor activity in juvenile alpine newts, Ichthyosaura alpestris, over three consecutive weeks. Locomotor activity was characterized by four parameters: distance covered, mean velocity, frequency of movements, and total activity rate (all directional and non-directional movements). Apart from total activity rate, thermal reaction norms for locomotor parameters had convex or concave curvilinear shapes. During the first trial series, i.e. across the four body temperatures that were tested, individual identity explained less variation in thermal reaction norms than during the second series. Individual means, i.e. the vertical positions of individual thermal reaction norms, were repeatable between trial series in all locomotor activity parameters but the frequency of movements. We conclude that spontaneous locomotor activity is a complex trait, which can be characterized by several parameters with varying individual repeatability and thermal dependency. This information should be considered for planning further locomotor activity experiments, conservation strategies, and modeling ectotherm responses to climate change.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.01.010,80,NA,126-132,NA,Amphibians; Behavioral plasticity; Behavioral reaction norms; Dispersal; Intermittent locomotion; Movement velocity; Thermal performance curves
article,Differential effects of water loss and temperature increase on the physiology of fiddler crabs from distinct habitats.,"Principe, Silas C. and Augusto, Alessandra and Costa, Tania Marcia",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature is one of the main environmental constraints to organism distribution, affecting physiology and survival. Organisms that inhabit the intertidal zone are exposed to temperature variation and, with climate change, they should face different conditions which include higher temperatures, leading to higher rates of water loss through evaporation and then fitness reduction or mortality. Here we tested the effects of desiccation and increased temperature in two fiddler crabs species that occupy distinct habitats in regard to vegetation cover and position on the intertidal zone and thus may respond differently to these stressors. Leptuca thayeri, which is restricted to the mid-tide zone and vegetated areas, had higher desiccation and mortality rates than Minuca rapax, a generalist species, when exposed to desiccation for 120 min. Also, compared to M. rapax, L. thayeri had a more permeable carapace. Temperature elevation of 10 degrees C and 20 degrees C for 72 h caused no mortality in either species. However, there were changes in hemolymph osmolality and muscle hydration in both species. Leptuca thayeri osmolality was low in the intermediate temperature, suggesting that at this temperature this species has a better salt secretion capability. Minuca rapax, however, had an increase in hemolymph osmolality at the highest temperatures with no LDH increase, which indicates that osmotic control in this species is more sensitive to temperature increase. Our results show that L. thayeri suffers more from desiccation, due to a more permeable carapace. However, because of this higher permeability L. thayeri is capable of lowering its temperature more than M. rapax. As temperature elevation produces great physiological changes in M. rapax, a reduced ability to keep a low temperature can be an issue for this species if temperature increases. However, higher water loss to keep body temperature low may decrease L. thayeri survivability in the same scenario.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.02.004,73,NA,14-23,NA,Thermal ecology; Thermal physiology; Desiccation; Leptuca thayeri; Minuca rapax

The L. cuprina hsp60 gene/protein expression pattern was analyzed in various tissues, either at normal temperature (25 +/- 1 degrees C) or after exposure to heat stress (42 degrees C). The analysis of nucleotide sequence of Lchsp60 gene revealed absence of intron and the nuclear localizing signal (NLS). The deduced amino acid sequence showed presence of unique conserved sequences, such as those for mitochondrial localization, ATP binding, etc. Unlike Drosophila, Lucilia showed presence of only one isoform, i.e., hsp60A. Phylogenetic analysis of hsp60 gene homologues from different species revealed Lchsp60 to have >88.36\% homology with D. melanogaster, 76.86\% with L. sericata, 58.31\% with mice, 57.99\% with rat, and 57.72\% with human.

We investigated the developmental, survival and reproductive traits of H. axyridis when its eggs were exposed to 25 (control), 37, 39 and 41 degrees C for 1 h, and then transferred to ambient condition (25 degrees C). The effects of heat stress on the hatching success greatly differed among temperature treatments. No H. axyridis larvae hatched out at 41 degrees C. The development, survival, weight, reproduction and longevity of H. axyridis exhibited significant differences with temperature treatment and gender. The survival rate of immatures declined, while the adult fresh weight of both sexes markedly increased with the increase of temperature. Heat exposure of the eggs caused a subsequent reduction in longevity, oviposition period and reproduction, while the pre-oviposition period became longer as the temperature increased. These may imply that the reproductive investment increased in higher level stressful environments, and the response of adult individuals could be linked to the experiences from early stages of the life history. Our findings provide useful information for predicting population dynamics and understanding the potential for H. axyridis as a biological control agent under variable environments.

article,Functional role of metabolic suppression in avian thermoregulation in the heat,"Voges, Jochen J. and Freeman, Marc T. and Wolf, Blair O. and McKechnie, Andrew E.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Hypometabolism arising from active metabolic suppression occurs in several contexts among endotherms, particularly during heterothermic states such as torpor. However, observed Q(10) approximate to 1 for avian resting metabolic rate within the thermoneutral zone, values far below the Q(10) = 2-3 expected on the basis of Arrhenius effects, suggests hypometabolism also plays a role in birds' thermoregulation at environmental temperatures approaching or exceeding normothermic body temperature (T-b). We evaluated the occurrence of hypometabolism during heat exposure among birds by re-analysing literature data to quantify changes in T-b and resting metabolic rate (RMR) near the upper boundary of the thermoneutral zone, at air temperatures (T-air) between the inflection above which T-b increases above normothermic levels (T-b.inf) and the upper critical limit of thermoneutrality (T-uc). Among the similar to 55 \% of species in which T-uc - T-b.inf > 0, Q(10) < 2-3 occurred in nine of 10 orders for which suitable data exist, indicating that hypometabolism during heat exposure is widespread across the avian phylogeny. Values of Q(10) < 2-3 were not restricted to small body mass, as previously proposed. Our findings support the idea that metabolic suppression reduces avian metabolic heat production and hence evaporative cooling requirements during heat exposure, with reductions of 20-30 \% in RMR in some species. Moreover, these findings add to evidence that hypometabolism is an important component of heat tolerance among endotherms such as birds and tropical arboreal mammals.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103924,123,NA,NA,103924,NA

Hence, this guided our search for quantifying heat stress' impact on Mehsana buffaloes using the best THI model and evaluating sires' performance. Fertility records (days open converted to daughter pregnancy rate) were collected in the span of over 24 years, w.e.f. 1989 to 2012. Finally, 3070 records of first lactation cows, daughters of 117 sires from DURDA, Gujarat, India, were used in the analysis. Meteorological data were retrieved from IMD, Pune, to understand the relationship between daughter pregnancy rate (DPR) and heat stress indicators. Several heat stress models were compared based on R-2, adjusted R-2, AIC, and BIC values, and the impact of heat stress was quantified. The year was classified into different heat stress zones, viz., Non heat stress zone (NHSZ), Heat stress zone (HSZ), and critical heat stress zone (CHSZ), drawing from the findings of DPR and THI. The THI 4th model based on dry and wet bulb temperature was identified as the best-fit model, and DPR significantly changed (P < 0.01) by 1.14\% per unit change in THI value based on the month of calving.

article,"Canopy coverage, light, and moisture affect thermoregulatory trade-offs in an amphibian breeding habitat","Spranger, Regina R. and Raffel, Thomas R. and Sinervo, Barry R.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"When amphibians thermoregulate, they face a fundamental trade-off between the ability to maintain activity and an increased rate of dehydration at higher temperatures. Canopy coverage affects both the thermal and hydric conditions of the environment and can therefore influence amphibian thermoregulation. Frogs require proper conditions to thermoregulate to successfully grow, survive, and reproduce. But while we know how canopy and environmental variables typically affect operative temperature, less is known about effects on amphibian water loss rates. In this study, we measure the effect of canopy coverage on the conditions available for thermoregulation at a breeding pond of the California red-legged frog, Rana draytonii. We use agar frog models to estimate the thermal and hydric capacities frogs would experience in locations with different canopy coverage and microhabitats. At each site, we deployed models under four microhabitat treatments: wet/sun, wet/shade, dry/sun, and dry/shade. We modeled how environmental variables affected operative temperature and evaporative water loss from agar frogs. We found positive effects of air temperature, the sun treatment, and reduced canopy cover on operative temperature, and negative direct or indirect effects of these variables on evaporative water loss, consistent with the hypothesized trade-off between thermoregulatory behavior to increase temperature and the increased desiccation risk due to higher water loss. Additionally, our results indicate that the availability of wet microhabitats can allow frogs to reduce water loss, potentially mitigating the risk of desiccation when thermoregulating to achieve higher operative temperatures. Our findings suggest, that with access to proper microhabitats, amphibians can mitigate the fundamental trade-off and receive benefits of thermoregulating at high temperatures.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103864,122,NA,NA,103864,Canopy coverage; Evaporative water loss; Operative temperature; Thermoregulation; Canopy management; Microhabitats

Organisms with flexible thermoregulatory behaviours may be able to mitigate the effects of extreme temperatures by moving among microhabitats, yet little work has tracked movement patterns of desert ectotherms in the wild over diurnal scales or compared behaviour among seasons. Here, we used camera traps to track the thermoregulatory behaviour and microhabitat choices of 30 desert lizards ( Messalina bahaldini ) in custom, outdoor arenas that provided access to open, rock, and bush microhabitats. We found that in the summer, lizards preferred to move to the shaded microhabitats and remain there under warmer conditions. During winter, however, lizards' activity was not related to temperature, and lizards mostly chose to remain in the open habitat. Interestingly, in both seasons, lizards tended to remain in their current microhabitat and moved infrequently between certain combinations of microhabitats. Our study shows that thermoregulation (shade -seeking behaviour) is a major factor during summer, helping lizards to avoid extreme temperatures, but not during winter, and shows a novel effect of current microhabitat on movement, suggesting that other biotic or abiotic factors may also drive microhabitat choice.

Commercial formulations of chlorpyrifos (COM) are the pesticides most widely used in agricultural activities, with a high toxic potential on amphibians. However, little is known about the separate effects of the active ingredient (CPF) and adjuvants (AD). We studied the thermal sensitivity at different concentrations and pesticide fractions in Rhinella arenarum tadpoles, on thermal tolerance limits (CT max = Critical thermal maximum and CT min = Critical thermal minimum), swimming speed (S s ), Optimum temperature (T o p ), and Thermal breadth 50 (B 50 ). Our results demonstrate that the pesticide active ingredient, the adjuvants, and the commercial formulation of chlorpyrifos differentially impair the thermal sensitivity of R. arenarum tadpoles. The pesticide fractions affected the heat and the cold tolerance (CT max and CT min ), depending on the concentrations they were exposed to. The locomotor performance (S s , T op , and B 50 ) of tadpoles also varied among fractions, treatments, and environmental temperatures. In the context of climate change, the outcomes presented are particularly relevant, as mean temperatures are increasing at unprecedented rates, which suggests that tadpoles inhabiting warming and polluted ponds are currently experiencing deleterious conditions. Considering that larval stages of amphibians are the most susceptible to changing environmental conditions and the alarming predictions about environmental temperatures in the future, it is likely that the synergism between high temperatures and pesticide exposure raise the threat of population deletions in the coming years.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103816,120,NA,NA,103816,Argentina; Chlorpyrifos; Ecotoxicology; Performance; Thermal extremes

The role of heat shock protein 72 (Hsp72) in heat stress-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy has been well demonstrated; however, the precise mechanisms remain unclear. Essential amino acids, such as leucine, mainly mediate muscle protein synthesis. We investigated the effects of pre-heating and increased Hsp72 expression on the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and protein synthesis following leucine administration in rat gastrocnemius muscle. To ensure increased Hsp72 expression in both the red and white portions of the muscle, one leg of male Wistar rats (10-week-old, n = 23) was heat-stressed in 43(degrees )C water for 30 min twice at a 48-h-interval (heat-stressed leg, HS leg). The contralateral leg served as a non-heated internal control (CT leg). After the recovery period (48 h), rats were divided into the pre-administration or oral leucine administration groups. We harvested the gastrocnemius muscle (red and white parts) prior to administration and 30 and 90 min after leucine treatment (n = 7-8 per group) and intramuscular signaling responses to leucine ingestion were determined using western blotting. Heat stress significantly upregulated the expression of Hsp72 and was not altered by leucine administration. Although the phosphorylation levels of mTOR/S6K1 and ERK were similar regardless of heating, 4E-BP1 was less phosphorylated in the HS legs than the CT legs after leucine administration in the red portion of the muscles (P < 0.05). Moreover, c-Myc expression differed significantly after leucine administration in both the red and white portions of the muscles.

Hence, ectotherms can drastically limit their exposure to thermal extremes by selecting a narrower range of temperatures, which includes their preferred temperature (Tpref). Despite evidence that behavioural thermoregulation can be adjusted by phenotypic plasticity or constrained by natural selection, intraspecific Tpref variations across environmental gradients remain overlooked as compared to other thermal traits like thermal tolerance. Here, we analyzed Tpref variation of spider populations found along a gradient of urban heat island (UHI) which displays large thermal variations over small distances. We measured two components of the thermal preference, namely the mean Tpref and the Tpref range (i.e., standard deviation) in 557 field-collected individuals of a common ground-dwelling spider (Pardosa saltans, Lycosidae) using a laboratory thermal gradient. We determined if Tpref values differed among ten populations from contrasting thermal zones. We showed that endogenous factors such as body size or sex primarily determine both mean Tpref and Tpref range. The Tpref range was also linked to the UHI intensity to a lesser extent, yet only in juveniles. The absence of relationship between Tpref metrics and UHI in adult spiders suggests a Bogert effect according to which the ability of individuals to detect and exploit optimal microclimates weakens the selection pressure of temperatures (here driven by UHI) on their thermal physiology. Alternatively, this lack of relationship could also indicate that temperature patterns occurring at the scale of the spiders' micro-habitat differ from measured ones. This study shows the importance of considering both inter-individual and inter-population variations of the Tpref range when conducting Tpref experiments, and supports Tpref range as being a relevant measure to inform on the strength of behavioural thermoregulation in a given population.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103706,117,NA,NA,103706,Behavioural thermoregulation; Bogert effect; Climate change; Ectotherm; Pardosa saltans; Urbanization; Selected temperature
article,Thermal niche breadth and their relationship with sturnira bat species diversification,"Carballo-Morales, Jorge D. and Saldana-Vazquez, Romeo A. and Villalobos, Federico and Herrera-Alsina, Leonel",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The interaction between climatic conditions and the ability of organisms to maintain homeostasis regulates the distribution of species on the planet. However, its influence on macroevolutionary dynamics is not well un-derstood. It has been suggested that diversification rates will be different in lineages with narrow thermal niches (specialists) to diversification rates in generalist lineages, but the evidence for this is elusive. Here, we tested this hypothesis by using the most diverse (in species richness and geographic range variation) tropical bat genus within the Phyllostomidae family. We estimated the realized thermal niche breadth of Sturnira species from their geographic range and categorized them as generalists, cold specialists, or warm specialists. We compared dy-namic evolutionary models that differ in 1) niche breadth evolution, 2) parental niche breadth inheritance, and 3) whether niche breadth evolution is associated with shifts in diversification rates. Our best-performing model indicates that most Sturnira species arose as specialists in warm climates and that over time, their niche breadth broadens, and just a subset of those species becomes specialists in cold environments. We found that the evo-lution of realized thermal niche breadth causes fluctuations in per-lineage rates of diversification, where warm specialists boast the highest speciation rates. However, we found no evidence of these changes in niche neither triggering nor being a result of speciation events themselves; this suggests that diversification events in Sturnira could instead depend on allopatric speciation processes such as the development of geographic barriers.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103697,117,NA,NA,103697,Chiroptera; Phyllostomidae; Frugivores; Neotropics; Macroevolution
article,A simulated heat wave-but not herbicide exposure-alters resource investment strategy in an insect,"Stahlschmidt, Z. R. and Choi, J. and Choy, B. and Perez, P. L. and Whitlock, J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Animals are increasingly exposed to potential stressors related to environmental change, and multiple stressors may alter the dynamics by which animals acquire resources and invest those resources into important life-history traits. Stress may lead to the prioritization of current reproduction to maximize lifetime reproduction (i.e., terminal investment {[}TI]) or, in contrast, prioritize somatic investment over current reproduction to facilitate future reproductive opportunities (i.e., reproductive restraint {[}RR]). Tests of the TI and RR hypotheses typically use immune challenges as stressors, and have not been explicitly tested in the context of environmental change even though warming influences resource allocation patterns across taxa. Further, the multiple-stressor framework has been a useful construct to clarify the costs of complex environmental shifts to animals, but it has not been leveraged to understand such effects on investment strategy. Thus, we tested the TI and RR hypotheses by manipulating widespread features of environmental change-glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH; Roundup \& REG;) exposure and a simulated heat wave-in the variable field cricket (Gryllus lineaticeps). A simulated heat wave affected the life-history tradeoff between investment into reproduction and soma. Specifically, heat wave prioritized investment into ovary mass over non-reproductive tissue, even after accounting for food consumption, in support of the TI hypothesis. In contrast, GBH exposure did not affect any measured trait, and crickets did not discriminate between tap water and GBH solution during drinking. Therefore, some-but not all-aspects of environmental change may alter resource investment strategies in animals. We encourage continued integration of the multiple-stressor framework and life-history theory to better understand how animals respond to their rapidly changing environments.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103670,116,NA,NA,103670,Environmental change; Glyphosate; Life history; Multiple-stressor; Resource allocation; Temperature

In particular, Asian sand dust (ASD) exposure has been related to an increase in mortality and hospital admissions for respiratory diseases. In this study, we investigated the effects of ASD on metabolic tissues in comparison to diesel particulate matter (DPM) that is known to cause adverse health effects. We found that larger lipid droplets were accumulated in the brown adipose tissues (BAT) of ASD-administered but not DPMadministered mice. Thermogenic gene expression was decreased in these mice as well. When ASDadministered mice were exposed to the cold, they failed to maintain their body temperature, suggesting that the ASD administration had led to impairments in cold-induced adaptive thermogenesis. However, impaired thermogenesis was not observed in DPM-administered mice. Furthermore, mice fed a high-fat diet that were chronically administered ASD demonstrated unexplained weight loss, indicating that chronic administration of ASD could be lethal in obese mice. We further identified that ASD-induced lung inflammation was not exacerbated in uncoupling protein 1 knockout mice, whose thermogenic capacity is impaired. Collectively, ASD exposure can impair cold-induced adaptive thermogenic responses in mice and increase the risk of mortality in obese mice.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103675,116,NA,NA,103675,Asian sand dust; Thermogenesis; brown adipose tissue; Ucp1; Obesity; Cold exposure
article,Passive heat diffusion in nests with downward-facing cells: Implications for early colony development in social wasps,"Bouchebti, Sofia and Domer, Adi and Bodner, Levona and Levin, Eran",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Social insects employ a variety of active and passive mechanisms for nest thermoregulation. Many social wasp species exhibit a particular nest-architecture by building their nests with cells facing downward. By using thermal imaging to characterize the heat diffusion throughout Oriental hornet nests from different angular positions, we show that the heat diffusion along the vertical gradient of nests is more efficient when the cell openings face downward than when facing sideways or upward, demonstrating the efficiency of this specific architecture in increasing the nest temperature. This passive thermoregulation mechanism could be especially important during the initial stage of the colony, when the queen is alone to rear her first brood. Among the social insects that build cells to raise their brood, we suggest that wasps can take advantage of the thermal benefits of this particular architecture of their cells as, unlike bees, they do not usually store food in them.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103657,116,NA,NA,103657,Nest architecture; Social insects; Thermoregulation; Vespa orientalis; Vespinae

This condition often occurs in the tropical areas due to a higher THI rate throughout seasons. The major objective of the study was to investigate the different responses in milk yield and composition, chewing activities, and health parameters in dairy cows under the dry and wet seasons of tropical climate zone in Indonesia. Twenty mid-lactating Indonesian Holstein-Friesian cows (139.3 \& PLUSMN; 24.63 DIM; 10 primiparous and 10 multiparous; 441 \& PLUSMN; 21.5 kg BW) were randomly subjected to 2 groups, dairy cows under dry (n = 10) and wet season (n = 10). Both groups received the same diets throughout the experiment. To determine the heat stress condition, the THI values were recorded daily. Overall, a higher number of THI was more pronounced in wet season. A lower dry matter intake (DMI) and milk yield were observed in wet season group. A tendency towards higher milk protein contents was found in dairy cows under dry season compared to cows under wet season. The other milk compositions such as fat, lactose, and SNF remained unchanged in both dry and wet season groups. The comparison between both groups at several time points of eating and ruminating time revealed significantly higher in cows under dry season. Overall, a higher chewing per bolus was observed in cows under dry season than their counterparts. Furthermore, a tendential greater extent rectal temperature pointed in the wet season group compared to the dry season group relatively. Data suggest that a stronger heat stress condition in wet season was more pronounced compared to dry season, with adversely affecting stronger declined DMI, milk yield, and chewing activities of dairy cows.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103608,114,NA,NA,103608,Dairy cow; THI; DMI; Milk yield; Chewing activities

Temperature is the main environmental factor that influences sex determination in most teleost fish. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of rearing temperature (thermocycle (TC) vs. constant (CTE)) on development and a posterior thermal shock throughout the period of sex differentiation of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Embryos and larvae were kept under two temperature regimes: TC of 31 degrees C:25 degrees C day:night vs. CTE of 28 degrees C from 0 to 11 dpf. After this period, the larvae from each group were subjected to either heat treatment (HT, 36 degrees C for 12 days) or kept under the same rearing temperatures until 23 dpf (Control, C). Then all the groups remained at constant temperature until 270 dpf, when blood and gonads were collected. Larval samples were used to examine the expression of genes related to male (amh, ara, sox9a, dmrt1a) and female (cyp19a1a, foxl2, era) sexual differentiation. In juveniles, sex was characterized by histology, the gonadal expression of the genes involved in the sex steroid synthesis was analyzed by qPCR, and plasma testosterone (T) and estradiol (E2) levels were analyzed by ELISA. In larvae, daily TCs increased the survival rate against HT and up-regulated the expression of ovarian differentiation genes. In juveniles, TC + C induced a higher proportion of females and higher cyp19a1a expression compared to CTE + C. HT induced changes in the CTE group by up-regulating testicular differentiation genes and down-regulating female promoting genes, which did not occur in the TC group. Juveniles from TC + C group presented a higher proportion of females with higher E2 and cyp19a1a than CTE + HT. Fish from the CTE + HT group showed a higher percentage of males with highest T and amh. These findings indicate that daily TCs during larval development promote ovarian differentiation and diminish the masculinizing effects of HT.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103596,115,NA,NA,103596,Oreochromis niloticus; Heat treatment; Sex reversal; Daily thermocycles; Sex ratio; Temperature-sex determination

Although there have been many reports on the disparate effects of heat stress, its effects on mammalian muscle stem cells are still unclear. In this study, we isolated porcine muscle satellite cells (PMSCs) from the femurs of 1-day-old piglets, and cultured them under three temperature conditions: 37 degrees C, 39 degrees C, and 41 degrees C. Exposure to HS not only decreased the viability and proliferation rates of PMSCs, but also regulated the cell cycle and induced apoptosis. High-temperature culture conditions decreased both protein and gene expression of Pax7, a proliferation and maintenance marker of muscle satellite cells, whereas it increased both protein and gene expression of MyoG, a differentiation marker, and promoted myotube formation in the early stage of differentiation induction. In addition, the protein and gene expression of several heat shock proteins (HSPs) in PMSCs increased due to heat treatment. In conclusion, HS induced the cell cycle arrest of PMSCs, thereby reducing the proliferation rate. In addition, high-temperature culture conditions promoted the formation of myotubes at the early stage of differentiation of PMSCs without additives.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103569,114,NA,NA,103569,Porcine; Muscle satellite cell; Heat stress; Heat shock protein; Differentiation
article,Interactions between winter temperatures and duration of exposure may structure Arctic microarthropod communities,"Coulson, Stephen James and Convey, Peter and Schuuring, Sil and Lang, Simone Iris",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The Arctic has a diverse terrestrial microarthropod fauna which overwinters in situ in soil and vegetation. This fauna is involved in key ecosystem processes, for example decomposition and pollination, and has tolerance to the Arctic's winter conditions. However, the Arctic is undergoing rapid change. Svalbard is experiencing warming rates up to four times the global average as well as alterations in precipitation (quantity and form; snow or rain) and wind direction. These will modify the conditions experienced by the overwintering fauna. Since laboratory experiments often fail to capture the diversity of environmental stressors, we employed a manipu-lation experiment using the naturally accumulating snow pack to moderate soil winter soil temperatures, combined with an extended incubator treatment, to map the duration limits of naturally induced cold tolerance. We demonstrate that the Collembola fauna can tolerate temperatures of-25 degrees C but that, in areas devoid of snow accumulation and when soil temperatures dip below-30 degrees C there is significant mortality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that exposure to a further extended 12 month period at-6 degrees C, as a simple model of a situation where snow cover is not lost during the short Arctic summer, results in additional mortality with relatively few Collembola surviving. By contrast, while oribatid mites displayed similar survival over a natural winter as the Collembola, they were highly resistant to the extended exposure at-6 degrees C, with no additional mortality occur-ring. We also documented survival amongst other invertebrate groups, including Nematocera and Brachycera larvae, Hemiptera (Acyrthosiphon svalbardicum), Coleoptera (Isochnus flagellum), and Araneae (Linyphiidae). We conclude that snow depth and winter air temperatures interact to regulate soil microarthropod populations over local scales and therefore the functioning of the Arctic soil ecosystem. Moreover, the environmental changes currently being observed in polar regions will continue to modify this fauna and its local and micro-scale distribution.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103499,114,NA,NA,103499,Polar; Snow; Climate change; Soil; Invertebrate

Reptiles depend on environmental temperature to regulate their body temperature, so geographic variation in environmental temperature can affect the biology of these organisms in the short and long term. We may expect physiological and behavioral responses to temperature change to be especially important in ectotherms inhab-iting temperate zones, where different seasons present different thermal challenges. High-mountain temperate systems represent a natural laboratory for studies of evolutionary and plastic variation in thermal biology. The aim of the present study is to evaluate operative temperature with biophysical models, active body temperature under field conditions, preferred temperature in a thermal gradient in the laboratory, and thermal indexes in Sceloporus grammicus lizards along an elevational gradient. We measured these traits in three populations at 2500, 3400, and 4100 m elevation at different seasons of the year (spring, summer and autumn). Our results showed that operative temperature varied with season and elevation, with greater variation at middle and high elevations than at low elevations. Body temperature and preferred temperature varied with altitude and season but did not differ between sexes. Thermal quality was lowest in the high-altitude population and in the summer season. Thermoregulatory efficiency was highest in the three populations in the autumn. Our results suggest that thermoregulatory strategies vary with elevation and season, allowing individual lizards to confront annual fluctuations in the thermal environment and conflicting with some previous descriptions of Sceloporus lizards as thermally conservative.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103539,114,NA,NA,103539,Thermoregulation; Thermal preference; Sceloporus grammicus; Season; Altitudinal gradient; Body temperature

In this study, we examined the effects of two allicin (AL) and lycopene (LP) levels on performance index, a liver tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) gene expression, histological parameters of liver, and small intestine of V-line growing rabbits exposed to thermal stress.Methods: In nine replications of three rabbits per pen under thermal stress, 135 male rabbits (5 weeks old, average weight 772.02 +/- 6.41 g) were randomly allocated to five dietary treatments in nine replications of three rabbits per pen under thermal stress (temperature-humidity index average 31.2). The 1st group served as the control, receiving no supplements; The 2nd and 3rd groups received 100 and 200 mg AL/kg of diet supplements; and the 4th and 5th groups were supplemented with 100 and 200 mg LP/kg diet, respectively.Results: show that AL and LP rabbits had the best final body weight, body gain, and feed conversion ratio compared with the control. compared with control, rabbit liver TNF-alpha levels significantly decreased in diets containing AL and LP In contrast, AL rabbits were slightly more effective in downregulating the expression of the TNF-alpha gene than LP groups. Furthermore, dietary supplementation of AL and LP significantly improved antibody titers against sheep red blood titers. Compared with other treatments, AL100 treatment significantly improved immune responses to phytohemagglutinin. In all treatments, histological analysis revealed a significant reduction in binuclear hepatocytes. The diameter of the hepatic lobules, villi height, crypt depth, and absorption surface of heat-stressed rabbits were all positively affected by both doses of LP (100-200 mg/kg diet).Conclusion: rabbit dietary supplementation with AL or LP could positively affect performance, TNF-alpha, immunity, and histological parameters of growing rabbits under thermal stress.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103521,113,NA,NA,103521,Heat stress; Histological parameters; Tumor necrosis factor; Cecum bacteria count

This righting behavior has been used as a repeatable and reliable indicator to assess echinoderms performance across environmental conditions, including thermal sensitivity and thermal stress. The current study aims at evaluating and comparing the thermal reaction norm for righting behavior (time for righting (TFR) and capacity to self-right) of three common sea urchins from high latitude, the Patagonian sea urchins Loxechinus albus and Pseudechinus magellanicus, and the Antarctic sea urchin Sterechinus neumayeri. In addition, to infer the ecological implications of our experiments, we compared laboratory-based and in situ TFR of these three species. We observed that populations of the Patagonian sea urchins L. albus and P. magellanicus presented similar trend of righting behavior, overly accelerating with increasing temperature (from 0 to 22 degrees C). Little variations and high inter-individual variability were observed below 6 degrees C in the Antarctic sea urchin TFR, and righting success strongly decreased between 7 and 11 degrees C. For the three species, TFR was lower in in situ experiments compared to the laboratory. Overall, our results suggest that the populations of Patagonian sea urchin exhibit a wide thermal tolerance and, based on S. neumayeri's TFR, aligning with the narrow thermal tolerance of Antarctic benthos.

For exploring the effect of non-linear expansion in the phase lag times, the Taylor's series of second-order expansion was applied. The resulting equation involves mixed derivative terms and higher-order derivatives of temperature with respect to time.

Given an age-related decline in whole-body heat loss, older adults are at an elevated risk of developing heat injuries that may be exacerbated by hypertension (HTN) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Elevated irisin production may play a role in mitigating the excess oxidative stress and acute inflammation associated with physically demanding work in the heat. However, the effects of HTN and T2D on this response remain unclear. Therefore, we evaluated serum irisin before and after 3-h of moderate intensity exercise (metabolic rate: 200 W/m2) and at the end of 60-min of post-exercise recovery in a temperate (wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) 16 degrees C) and high-heat stress (WBGT 32 degrees C) environment in 12 healthy older men (mean +/- SD; 59 +/- 4 years), 10 men with HTN (60 +/- 4 years), and 9 men with T2D (60 +/- 5 years). Core temperature (Tco) was measured continuously. In the heat, total exercise duration was significantly lower in older men with HTN and T2D (both, p < 0.049). Despite Tco not being different be-tween groups, Tco was higher in the hot compared to the temperate condition for all groups (p < 0.001). Similarly, serum irisin concentrations did not differ between groups under either condition but were elevated relative to the temperate condition during post-exercise and end-recovery in the heat (+93.9 pg/mL SEM 26 and + 70.5 pg/mL SEM 38 respectively; both p < 0.014). Thus, our findings indicate similar irisin responses in HTN and T2D compared to healthy, age-matched controls, despite reduced exercise tolerance during prolonged ex-ercise in the heat. Therefore, older workers with HTN and T2D may exhibit greater cellular stress during pro-longed exercise in the heat, underlying greater vulnerability to heat-induced cellular injury.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103344,110,NA,NA,103344,Heat stress; Temperature; Physical activity; Hypertension; Type 2 diabetes; Irisin; Myokine

With the temperature being a reliable indicator of the seasonal changes, an attempt to explore the variations in the life history strategies of the pest snail Allopeas gracile (Hutton, 1834) (Gastropoda: Subulinidae) was carried out under four constant temperature grades - 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 30 degrees C and 35 degrees C (+/- 1 degrees C) temperatures throughout with laboratory temperature as controlled environment. The snail A. gracile was unable to complete their life cycle at 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C, without reaching reproductive maturity. In contrast, A. gracile maintained at laboratory temperatures (range 25-29 degrees C) exhibited long life span, longer reproductive period and longer generation time. However, the reproductive rate was highest at temperature 30 degrees C. Perhaps, the warmer environment facilitated rapid growth, fast onset of reproduction with larger body size at early age. At a constant higher temperature of 35 degrees C a state of inactivation was imposed when growth and reproduction became static.

We determined the thermal preference of virgin, sexually mature Mediterranean fruit flies, Ceratitis capitata, and found that males preferred a significantly higher temperature (23.8 +/- 0.3 degrees C) than that of females (22.1 +/- 0.3 degrees C). We then tested predictions for the difference in thermal preference related to the energetic demands of reproduction over a range of temperatures. The frequency and duration of calling bouts by male C. capitata were optimal at 26 degrees C. Mating propensity and latency, and copula duration, were optimal over the range of 22-28 degrees C. When mating occurred, temperature had little effect on the incidence of sperm storage by females, but there was a notable decline in the number stored at 28 degrees C. Female lifespan was highest at 18 degrees C, but lifetime egg production was optimal at 24 degrees C. These results illustrate temperature-related differences in the reproductive fitness of the sexes in C. capitata, although the optima for male traits align best with their thermal preference.

J. and Bols, Niels C.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"How temperature influences fish physiological systems, such as the intestinal barrier, is important for understanding and alleviating the impact of global warming on fish and aquaculture. Monolayers of the rainbow trout cell line, RTgutGC, with or without linear 500 mu m wide gaps (wounds) were the in vitro models used to study the integrity and healing of intestinal epithelial sheets at different temperatures. Cultures at hypothermic (4 degrees C) or hyperthermic (> 26 degrees C) temperatures were compared to normothermic control cultures (18-22 degrees C). Monolayers remained intact for at least a week at temperatures from 4 to 28 degrees C, but had lost their integrity after 3 h at 32 degrees C as the cells pulled away from one another and from the plastic surface. F-actin appeared as prominent stress fibers in cells at 28 degrees C and as blobs in cells at 32 degrees C. At normothermia and at 26 degrees C, cells migrated as sheets into the gaps and closed (healed) the gaps within 5-6 days. By contrast, wounds took 14 days to heal at 4 degrees C. At 28 degrees C some cells migrated into the gap in the first few days but mainly as single cells rather than collectively and wounds never healed. When monolayers with wounds were challenged at 32 degrees C for 3 h and returned to 18-22 degrees C, cells lost their shape and actin organization and over the next 6 days detached and died. When monolayers were subjected to 26 degrees C for 24 h and challenged at 32 degrees C for 3 h prior to being placed at 18-22 degrees C, cell shape and actin cytoskeleton were maintained, and wounds were healed over 6 days. Thus, intestinal epithelial cells become thermostabilized for shape, cytoskeleton and migration by a prior heat exposure.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103147,103,NA,NA,103147,Fish; Intestinal cell line; Heat shock; Actin cytoskeleton; Thermotolerance; Collective cell migration; Wound healing

It is important to make clear of the effects of temperatures on the development of this aphid parasitoid for the future using as a aphid biological control agent. So the thermal requirements, lower developmental threshold (t), thermal constant (K), upper developmental threshold (T-m) and optimum developmental temperature (T-o) for the egg-mummy, mummy-adult and egg-adult periods of A. maculatus were established under the laboratory conditions. The studies were conducted at five constant temperatures (13, 18, 23, 28, and 33 degrees C) and with a 16 L: 8D photo period. Lower developmental threshold (t) and thermal constant (K) were estimated by fitting linear model. Upper developmental threshold (T-m) and optimal developmental temperature (T-o) were estimated by fitting Logan I non-linear model. The results turned out that the lower (t) and the upper developmental thresholds (Tm) for egg-adult period were 5.59 degrees C and 28.17 degrees C, respectively. The thermal constants (K) for egg-mummy, mummy-adult, and egg-adult periods were estimated at 121.51, 127.88, and 243.90 degree-days, respectively. The optimal developmental temperature (T-o) for egg-adult period was 27.45 degrees C calculated by the model, but the survival rate was only 40.68\% at the temperature of 28 degrees C. The highest survival rate was 74.32\% at temperature of 23 degrees C, implying that A. maculatus preferentially developed at the temperate regions of temperature.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103097,101,NA,NA,103097,Aphelinus maculatus; Myzus persicae; Temperature; Development; Survival
article,"The effects of cow-related factors on rectal temperature, respiration rate, and temperature-humidity index thresholds for lactating cows exposed to heat stress","Yan, Geqi and Liu, Kaixin and Hao, Ze and Shi, Zhengxiang and Li, Hao",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of the cow-related factors on rectal temperature (RT) and respiration rate (RR) of lactating dairy cows under different heat stress (HS) conditions and establish the temperature-humidity index (THI) thresholds at which RT and RR begin to increase for cows in China. Cowrelated factors included body posture (standing and lying), milk yield (<26 kg/d, > 26-39 kg/d, and >39 kg/ d), days in milk (<60 d, > 60 and < 150 d, and >150 d), and parity (1, 2, and >3). Records of RT, RR, and individual characteristics were collected from July to October 2020 on a commercial dairy farm in Northern China, where 826 Holstein lactating cows were measured. Using the broken-stick regression models and the entire dataset, the THI thresholds for RT and RR were 69.8 and 67.1, respectively. Therefore, the heat stress conditions during this study were classified according to the THI levels as thermoneutrality (TN, 60 < THI < 67), mild (67 < THI < 72), moderate (72 < THI < 80), and severe (80 < THI < 86). Results showed that lying cows exhibited the higher RT and RR but the lower THI threshold for RT (68.8 vs. 70.7) and RR (65.6 vs. 68.4) than standing cows; milk yield is positively associated with the values of RT and RR under TN or HS conditions, and the THI thresholds for RT (70.2 vs. 70.0 vs. 68.0) and RR (68.1 vs. 64.7 vs. 64.7) were progressively lower for low-yielding, middle-yielding, and high-yielding cows; there was a significant increase in RT and RR in earlylactation cows compared to late-lactation cows under TN or HS conditions (P < 0.001), and the lowest THI threshold (67.8 for RT and 64.7 for RR) was observed in early-lactation cows, followed by mid-lactation cows (68.2 for RT and 65.3 for RR) and late-lactation cows (70.0 for RT and 67.3 for RR); the effects of parity were not significant on RT (P > 0.05), but significant on RR (P < 0.001). The THI thresholds for RT (69.2) and RR (66.0) were lowest for cows in 3rd-parity and higher, followed by cows in 2nd-parity (70.0 for RT and 68.9 for RR) and 1st-parity (70.7 for RT and 66.6 for RR). This study highlighted the great significance of considering the cowrelated factors in heat stress responses and THI threshold assessment.

In this study, B. gargarizans (Bufo gargarizans) tadpoles were reared at three different water temperature (15, 22 and 29 degrees C) from Gosner stages 28-46. We investigated the effects of temperature on growth, development, survival, metamorphic duration, size and skeletal ossification at Gosner stage 40, 42, and 46, as well as thyroid tissue reached metamorphic climax (Gs42). Besides, we examined the transcription levels of endochondral ossificationrelated genes in hind limb at metamorphic climax (Gs42). Our results showed that the growth and development of tadpoles conform to the temperature-size rule (TSR). While warm temperature resulted in the decrease in body size and hind limb length, and shorten larval period, cold temperature led to increase in body size and hind limb length but prolonged larval period. Histological examinations revealed that warm and cold temperatures caused damage to thyroid tissue. Also, warm and cold temperatures inhibited the degree of ossification with the double staining methodology. Additionally, the real-time PCR results suggested that warm and cold temperatures significantly up-regulated Runx2, VEGF and VEGFR mRNA levels, and down-regulated TR beta, MMP9, MMP13 and Runx3 mRNA levels. The up-regulation of Dio2 level and down-regulation of Dio3 level were observed in warm temperature. TR alpha mRNA level was significantly increased in warm temperature, but decreased in cold temperature. Collectively, these observations demonstrated that warm and cold temperatures affected endochondral ossification in B. gargarizans tadpoles, which might influence their capacity to terrestrial locomotion.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103020,99,NA,NA,103020,Temperature; Bufo gargarizans; Hind limb; Growth; Development; Endochondral ossification

These enzymes affect the efficiency of UPP during stress conditions. P53 has important control of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to cellular stress; these modifications are critical for the stability and transcriptional activity of p53 as the protein activates downstream target genes that dictate the cellular response. However, few studies have investigated the effects of thermal stress in turbot (Scophthalmus maximus), specifically the UPP signaling pathway, and the crosstalk between the ube2h and p53. In this study, the rapid amplification of cDNA ends was used to obtain a full-length cDNA of the turbot UBE2H gene (Sm-ube2h) and perform bioinformatics analysis. Our results showed that the cDNA of the Sm-ube2h was 718 bp in length, encoding a 189 amino acid protein, with a theoretical isoelectric point of 4.77. It also contained a catalytic (UBCc) domain. Expression of Sm-ube2h in different tissues was detected and quantified by qPCR, which was highest in the spleen and lowest in the liver. We also investigated the Sm-ube2h expression profiles in the liver and heart after thermal stress, and changes in Sm-ube2h and p53 under thermal stress, upon RNA interference. Our data speculated that Sm-ube2h and p53 exhibited antagonistic effects under normal temperature conditions after ube2h interference, but displayed synergistic effects under thermal stress, suggesting the crosstalk between UPP and p53 signaling pathway.

These organisms have a temperature range where their physiological processes are more efficient, this range is usually a requirement set phylogenetically even though they vary in the use of habitats. This research compares the thermal ecophysiology of Basiliscus galeritus (western basilisk) in two populations with altitudinal differences in the northwestern of Ecuador. The results suggest that the difference of altitude between the two locations (500 m) influences the thermal ecophysiology of the species since the body temperature (T-b), operative temperature (T-e) and preferred body temperature (T-set) showed significative differences. Furthermore, B. galeritus obtains its T-b through heliothermy and it behaves as an active thermoregulator. On the other hand, the crest temperatures reach higher values than their T-set, the results suggested that the species uses the crest as an alternative to regulate its body temperature when exceeding its T-set.

Rhythmicity has been examined in many mole-rat species in the laboratory, but field reports are relatively scarce. We implanted Natal mole-rats with temperature loggers in summer and winter to record core body temperature (Tb), before releasing the animals again. Animals were recaptured after two months to recover the loggers. Natal mole-rats can maintain rhythmicity of their Tb in their natural habitat and display seasonal differences in their Tb rhythms. During winter mole-rats have unimodal Tb rhythms, whereas in summer many animals have bimodal Tb patterns, which may be related to temperatures in the foraging burrows close to the soil surface. Individuals from the same colonies frequently exhibited similar rhythms, especially in the larger colonies, which may indicate social entrainment of rhythms. Males and females differ in their seasonal variation of Tb, with males having more variation in winter, while the opposite was true for females. Entire colonies may undergo sporadic torpor bouts, presumably to conserve energy, but the trigger for these events is unknown. This is the first report of torpor occurring in an African mole-rat species.

Thirty Large White piglets of both sexes, aged 10-14 days, served as the experimental subjects. The rectal and surface body temperatures were recorded concurrently with those of the ambient dry- and wet-bulbs, during the day at 06:00, 09:00, 12:00, 15:00 and 18:00 h (GMT +1). There were significant (P < 0.05) diurnal variations in all body and ambient temperature readings, with the highest values obtained in the afternoon (at 15:00 h GMT + 1). The mean diurnal rectal and body surface temperatures in the piglets at 09:00-18:00 h were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than the corresponding values at 06:00 h. The overall mean rectal temperature (39.00 +/- 0.04 degrees C) was higher (P < 0.01) than body surface temperature recorded for the eye (38.05 +/- 0.04 degrees C), ear (38.10 +/- 0.07 degrees C), head (37.97 +/- 0.05 degrees C), nose (35.68 +/- 0.13 degrees C), scapula (38.16 +/- 0.06 degrees C), thigh (38.00 +/- 0.06 degrees C), back (38.02 +/- 0.06 degrees C) and hoof (36.83 +/- 0.07 degrees C). The largest and smallest mean difference between rectal and body surface temperatures was -3.32 +/- 0.12 degrees C and -0.84 +/- 0.06 degrees C for the temperature of the nose and scapula, respectively. The positive correlation (P < 0.05) between body temperatures (rectal and surface) of the piglets with ambient temperature implied that the later had a tremendous effect on the former. Body surface temperatures at the region of eye, ear, head, nose, scapula, thigh, back and hoof had significantly (P < 0.0001) linear and positive relationships with rectal temperature.

We have aimed to assess skin temperature evolution during transition phases of different durations before a typical front crawl effort and to investigate its relationship with performance. Following a standardized warm-up, nine adolescent male swimmers performed three maximal randomized 100 m maximum front crawl trials after 10, 20 and 45 min transition phases. Skin temperature, performance (time, stroke frequency, length and index, and propelling efficiency), heart rate, lactate and perceived effort were assessed. Data showed a skin temperature log increase over time (R2 0.6, p 0.05) for the studied transition phases.

Daily and seasonal environmental temperature fluctuations are amplified in desert and semi-desert species. As ectotherms, they can ameliorate physiological constrains through behavioral thermoregulation. Herein, we explored the thermal biology and behavioral related aspects of the endangered sand lizard Liolaemus scapularis and compared it between austral spring and summer seasons. The study was carried out in a north sector of Medanos de Cafayate in the SW of Salta province, Argentina. Mean field-body temperature (Tb) of L. scapularis was 35.72 degrees C ranging from 29.10 to 41.10 degrees C. Regression analyzes showed that substrate temperature (Ts) was the parameter that best explained the variability of the Tb. Body temperature in spring was only positively related to Ts, whereas in summer the Tb was positively related to air temperature (Ta). Despite GLMs indicated that the Tb of L. scapularis result statistically unchanged through seasons sampled and sexes, microenvironmental temperatures were different for males and females between sampled seasons. The behavioral thermoregulation trait assessed, sun exposure, revealed that the use of patches with different sun input varied with temperature parameters and between seasons. This behavioral trait seems to have a crucial role in the thermal strategy of these lizards in order to maintain an optimal homeostatic state avoiding overheating; still the Tb recorded for the studied population places Liolaemus scapularis in the upper range for the genus.

Twenty-eight crossbred cows were evaluated twice a day for one week using IRT. Three thermal images were obtained for each cow, referring to the anatomical regions of the right and left fore udder and rear udder. A computer program was used to analyze the images and obtain the right fore udder temperature (RFUT, degrees C), left fore udder temperature (LFUT, degrees C), rear udder temperature (RUT, degrees C), and average udder temperature (AUT, degrees C). In addition, samples of milk from each quarter of the udder were collected for somatic cell count (SCC) to correlate the diseases observed on the thermal image with any infection in the udder region. The results obtained using IRT were subjected to regression and correlation analyses. It was observed that LFUT, RAQT, RUT, and AUT were adjusted in quadratic polynomial models with good prediction of SCC (i.e., infection) with R-2 = 0.92, 0.97, 0.86, and 0.94, respectively. The region of the anterior quarters of the udder was the most promising for imaging, stronger correlations were obtained between LFUT and RFUT with SCC (r = 0.87 and 0.88, respectively). The IRT is a practical technology capable of detecting cases of mastitis in dairy cows with good precision, especially with thermal images from the anatomical region of the front quarters of the udder.

We used a central composite experimental design and response surface methodology. The experimental ranges were 18-36 degrees C for T and 0-24 h for Pp. The results show that the quadratic effects of T and Pp were highly significant for serum E-2 and P contents, GSI, and the ratio of stage III to stage II oocytes (P < 0.01), and that the linear effects of T and Pp were also significant for these indicators (P < 0.05). The T x Pp interaction significantly affected serum E-2 content (P < 0.05). Serum E-2 and P content, GSI, and the ratio of stage III to stage II oocytes increased and then decreased with increasing T or Pp. The best combination of T and Pp for egg development was 28.6 degrees C/14.29 h. We observed the part of ovarian tissue containing stage V oocytes that are about to be discharged. Shortening the photoperiod or lowering the water temperature delayed the development of ovarian tissue so that most oocytes remained at stage II, and there were many atretic follicles.

article,Thermal infrared imaging based facial temperature in comparison to ear temperature during a real-driving scenario,"Xuan, Rebecca Pham and Xiong, Yuxin and Brietzke, Adrian and Marker, Stefanie",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Motion Sickness is associated with a variety of symptoms, which differ in occurrence rate and intensity between individuals. In order to research the cause of car sickness and develop countermeasures, it is important to determine symptoms and their severity objectively. A tool for this purpose could be the assessment of physiological reactions due to motion sickness. This paper describes and discusses a methodology to identify changes in facial skin temperatures in a real-driving study. Common techniques had to be adjusted in order to meet the requirements given by the challenges of in-car-recording. The examined data was generated in a previous study, which was designed to research motion sickness in a driving environment. A pre-processing technique had to be developed to magnify features on the face and subsequently improve the tracking in thermal imagery. After the pre-processing, regions of interest (ROI) were manually marked and tracked in thermal images. The thereby assessed facial skin temperatures were compared to tympanic temperatures. Derived temperatures from the forehead as well as from the 20 hottest pixels within the face indicated a better tracking, while the nose tip was more affected by detection errors. The correlation of the three features with the tympanic temperature showed remarkable differences between a baseline measurement and the actual driving. Less than 10\% of the data derived during the driving and up to 30\% of the data during the baseline measurement correlated highly. It is concluded that detecting changes in facial skin temperature using thermal infrared imaging in a moving car is challenging and results are hardly comparable to tympanic temperatures. Future research should aim at the different influencing factors of skin and tympanic temperature, while enhancing tracking or detection of ROI could be achieved by reducing the passengers? movements or choosing the target area more carefully.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102806,96,NA,NA,102806,Facial temperature; Real-driving study; Thermal infrared imaging; Tracking method; Tympanic temperature

Therefore, the main aim of this research is to evaluate the potential wind-cooling effect on human outdoor thermal conditions. Accordingly, the current research attempts determine the best wind directions for thermal comfort at the studied stations and how these factors will be changed under the effects of global warming. Outdoor thermal conditions were modeled based on the physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) thermal index using RayMan software for the decades of the 2000s and the 2040s in different climate types of Iran (Csb, BWh, Csa, and BSh) To estimate the potential cooling effect of wind, the PET was calculated (1) under actual wind conditions, and (2) under calm wind (0.05 m/s) conditions. Then, the Delta PET for these two conditions, which indicates the cooling potential effect (CPE) of the wind, was calculated for four representative stations (Ardebil, Bandar Abbas, Gorgan, and Shiraz). In comparison with the 2000s, the results indicated that by the 2040s, the predicted wind cooling potential will have increased in Ardebil, Shiraz, Bandar Abbas and Gorgan (CPE of 1 3.2 degrees C, 13.1 degrees C, 11.2 degrees C, and 11 degrees C, respectively). Based on the overall average of two climate change scenarios (A2 and B1) used in this study, the occurrence of ``comfortable{''} conditions by the 2040s will have increased in Bandar Abbas, Shiraz, and Ardebil by 1.1\%, 0.4\%, and 0.3\%, respectively, while it will have decreased in Gorgan by 1.5\%. Accounting for the cooling effect of wind, the comfort cooling potential of wind is predicted to rise by an average of 1.6 degrees C in the 2040s compared with the 2000s in all the studied stations. Therefore, this will affect the microclimates positively and could reduce the urban heat island effects.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102660,92,NA,NA,102660,Physiological equivalent temperature index; Climate change; Cooling effect; Urban climate; Typical meteorological year

These data included rectal temperature (RT) and respiratory rate (RR).

article,Thermotolerance indicators related to production and physiological responses to heat stress of holstein cows,"Amamou, Hajer and Beckers, Yves and Mahouachi, Mokhtar and Hammami, Hedi",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Heat stress (HS) adversely influences dairy cattle welfare and productivity. This study aimed to investigate the effects of HS on production and physiological parameters of Holstein cows. Two experiments each lasted 6 weeks were conducted in four Tunisian farms, firstly during summer under HS (n = 80; THI = 77) and later during autumn under thermo-neutral (n = 80, THI = 54) conditions. Respiration rate (RR), skin temperature (ST), rectal temperature (RT) and milk yield were measured, and milk samples were collected on 2 days every week during each experimental period. Temperature and relative humidity were measured inside the barn to calculate the temperature-humidity index (THI). Mixed models were used to evaluate the effects of period and the relationships between THI and physiological and production traits. Reaction norm models were applied to quantify the individual responses of cows across the trajectory of THI during the HS period. A clustering methodology was developed to identify tolerant and sensitive cows to HS based on their slope for response of physiological and production traits during HS period. In summer, RR (61 breaths/min) and ST (37.7 degrees C) were 2.3- and 1.3-fold higher, whereas milk yield per milking was 24\% lower compared with thermo-neutral conditions. Linear relationship between THI and RR, ST and RT was observed and showed increases by 2 breaths/min, 0.5 degrees C and 0.04 degrees C per increase in one THI unit, respectively. Inversely, milk, fat and protein yields showed a drop of 0.13 kg, 0.4 g and 0.3 g per milking per increase in one THI unit, respectively. Cows qualified to be heat tolerant by our work tended to have higher RR, ST, and RT and lower to almost no decay in milk yield compared to cows qualified to be heat sensitive. Specifically, RR could be used as a reliable indicator for thermotolerance.

Through Sept-Dec 2016 we monitored temperature and humidity at 11 badger setts (burrow systems), using thermal probes inserted over 4-13 sett entrances to a depth of ca. 2 m, supplemented by continuous daily logging at one entrance per sett. Setts were cooler than exterior conditions Sept-Oct, and warmer than exterior conditions Nov-Dec. Setts cooled down when badgers left them to forage by night, and warmed up when badgers occupied them by day. Soil type and aspect also influenced sett temperature. Sett temperature did not affect the weight or body-condition of either adults or maturing cubs in autumn. However, cubs born into seas that were relatively warmer through the preceding autumn-winter were heavier in the following spring than contemporaries born in cooler setts (badgers exhibit delayed implantation), and so warmer setts might benefit early cub growth. We posit that sett quality may be important in providing badgers with a stable thermal refuge from variable weather conditions.

Objective: We examined the association between maternal exposure to ambient air temperature during pregnancy and lifetime pneumonia in the offspring. Methods: We conducted a cohort study of 2598 preschool children aged 3-6 years in Changsha, China. The lifetime prevalence of pneumonia was assessed using questionnaire. We backwards estimated each child's exposure to air temperature during prenatal and postnatal periods. Multiple regression model was used to examine the association between childhood pneumonia and exposure to air temperature in terms of odd ratios (OR) and 95\% confidence interval (CI). Results: Prevalence of childhood pneumonia in Changsha was high up to 38.6\%. We found that childhood pneumonia was significantly associated with prenatal exposure to air temperature, with adjusted OR (95\% CI) = 1.77 (1.23-2.54) for an interquartile range (IQR) increase in temperature, particularly during the second trimester with adjusted OR (95\% CI) = 2.26 (1.32-3.89). Boys are more susceptible to the risk of pneumonia due to air temperature than girls.

H.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Physiological or behavioural adjustments are a prerequisite for ectotherms to cope with different thermal environments. One of the world's steepest environmental gradients in temperature and precipitation can be found in southeastern Madagascar. This unique gradient allowed us to study the compensation of thermal constraints in the heliothermic lizard Oplurus quadrimaculatus on a very small geographic scale. The lizard occurs from hot spiny forest to intermediate gallery and transitional forest to cooler rain forest and we investigated whether these habitat differences are compensated behaviourally or physiologically. To study activity skin temperature (as proxy for body temperature) and the activity time of lizards, we attached temperature loggers to individuals in three different habitats. In addition, we calculated field resting costs from field resting metabolic rate to compare energy expenditure along the environmental gradient. We found no variation in activity skin temperature, despite significant differences in operative environmental temperature among habitats. However, daily activity time and field resting costs were reduced by 35\% and 28\% in the cool rain forest compared to the hot spiny forest. Our study shows that O. quadrimaculatus relies on behavioural mechanisms rather than physiological adjustments to compensate thermal differences between habitats. Furthermore, its foraging activity in open, sun exposed habitats facilitates such a highly effective thermoregulation that cold operative temperature, not energetically expensive heat, presents a greater challenge for these lizards despite living in a hot environment.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.01.005,68,A,21-26,NA,Metabolic rate; Operative environmental temperature; Energy expenditure; Reptiles; Behavioural compensation; Physiological adjustment
article,Thermal emissivity of avian eggshells,"Bjorn, Lars Olof and Bengtson, Sven-Axel and Li, Shaoshan and Hecker, Christoph and Ullah, Saleem and Roos, Arne and Nilsson, Annica M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The hypothesis has been tested that evolution has resulted in lower thermal emissivity of eggs of birds breeding openly in cold climates than of eggs of birds that nest under protective covering or in warmer climates. Directional thermal emissivity has been estimated from directional-hemispherical reflectance spectra. Due to several methodological difficulties the absolute emissivity is not accurately determined, but differences between species are obvious. Most notably, small waders of the genus Calidris, breeding in cold climates on the tundra, and in most cases with uniparental nest attendance, have low directional emissivity of their eggshells, about 0.92 when integration is carried out for wavelengths up to 16 mu m. Species belonging to Galloanserinae have the highest directional emissivity, about 0.96, of their eggs. No differences due to climate or breeding conditions were found within this group. Eggs of most other birds tested possess intermediate emissivity, but the values for Pica pica and Corvus corone cornix are as low as for Calidris. Large species-dependent differences in spectral reflectance were found at specific wavelengths. For instance, at 4.259 mu m the directional-hemispherical reflectance for galliforms range from 0.05 to 0.09, while for Fratercula arctica and Fulmarus glacialis it is about 0.3. The reflection peaks at 6.5 and 11.3 mu m due to calcite are differentially attenuated in different species. In conclusion, the hypothesis that evolution has resulted in lower thermal emissivity of bird eggs being exposed in cold climates is not supported by our results. The emissivity is not clearly related to nesting habits or climate, and it is unlikely that the small differences observed are ecologically important. The spectral differences between eggs that nevertheless exist should be taken into account when using infrared thermometers for estimating the surface temperature of avian eggs.

O. and Faerovig, P. J. and Rognerud, B. and Andersen, T. and Stordal, F.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Small water bodies in cold climate respond fast to global warming, and species adapted to such habitats may be valuable indicators for climate change. We investigated the geographical and physiological temperature limits of the Arctic fairy shrimp (Branchinecta paludosa), which is common in cold water arctic ponds, but at present retracts its range in alpine areas along its southern outreach of Norway. Seasonal logging of water temperatures along an altitudinal transect revealed an upper temperature limit of 12.7 degrees C for its presence, which closely matched a calculated upper temperature limit of 12.9 degrees C throughout its entire Norwegian range. Field data hence point to cold stenotherm features, which would be consistent with its Arctic, circumpolar distribution. Lab experiments, on the other hand, revealed a linear increase in respiration over 10-20 degrees C. When fed ad libitum somatic growth increased with temperature, as well, without negative physiological impacts of higher temperatures. The absence of Branchinecta paludosa in ponds warmer than 13 degrees C could still be due to a mismatch between temperature dependent metabolism and limited energy supply in these ultraoligotrophic water bodies. We discuss the concept of cold stenothermy in this context, and the impacts of regional warming on the future distribution of the Arctic fairy shrimp. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This modulates the ecology and distribution of organisms that inhabit the continental shelf. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of different acclimation temperatures on the thermal biology of prey as mollusc, crustacean (Melongena corona bispinosa, Strombus pugilis, Callinectes similis, Libinia dubia) and predators as fish (Ocyurus chlysurus, Centropomus undecimalis) of Octopus maya. Octopus prey preferred temperatures between 23.5 degrees C and 26.0 degrees C, while predators preferred temperatures 26.4-28.5 degrees C. The species with largest thermal windows were M. corona bispinosa (328.8 degrees C-2), C simi/is (322.8 degrees C-2), L. dubia (319.2 degrees C-2), C. undecimalis (288.6 degrees C-2), 0. chrysurus (237.5 degrees C-2), while the smallest thermal window was for S. pugilis (202.0 degrees C-2). The acclimation response ratios (ARR)-estimated for prey ranged from 0.24-0.55 in animals exposed to CTMax and 0.21-0.65 in those exposed to CTMin. Amongst predators, ARR ranged from 0.30 to 0.60 and 0.41 to 0.53 for animals exposed to CTMax and CTMin, respectively. Correlating the optimal temperature limits of prey and predators with surface temperatures on the continental shelf and those 4 m deep showed that the main prey, Callinectes similis and L dubia, shared a thermal niche and that an increase in temperature could force these species to migrate to other sites to find optimal temperatures for their physiological functions. As a consequence the continental shelf community would undergo a structural change. Predators were found to be near their optimal temperatures in surface temperatures on the continental shelf. We conclude that they would remain in the area in a warming scenario. The size of the thermal window was related to the type of ecosystem inhabited by these species. These ARR intervals allowed us to categorize the species as temperate or tropical, according to the oceanographic conditions that prevail on the Yucatan Peninsula. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Temporal patterns of cardiac performance and genes encoding heat shock proteins and metabolic sensors of an intertidal limpet <i>Cellana toreuma</i> during sublethal heat stress,"Zhang, Shu and Han, Guo-dong and Dong, Yun-wei",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Intertidal invertebrates develop effective physiological adaptations to cope with the rapidly changing thermal environment in the intertidal zone. In the present study, the temporal patterns of heart rate, protein carbonyl groups, and genes encoding heat shock proteins (hsp70 and hsp90) and metabolic sensors (ampka, ampk beta and sirt1) were measured to study the effect of sublethal heat stress on the cardiac function, oxidative stress, heat shock response and cellular metabolism of an intertidal limpet Cellana toreuma. All the physiological parameters are sensitive to temperature and duration of heat stress. Spearman correlation analysis revealed that the correlations between heart rate and levels of heat shock proteins mRNA and metabolic sensors mRNA were statistically significant. These results further suggest that cardiac function plays crucial roles in cellular energy metabolism and heat shock responses. The significant increase of protein carbonyl groups at 34 degrees C after 4 h exposure indicated that the failure of cardiac function and the increase of anaerobic metabolism partly leads to the increase of protein carbonyl groups. Generally, the physiological responses to heat stress are sensitive to temperature and are energy-consumptive, as indicated by the upregulation of metabolic sensors mRNA. However, the upregulation of heat shock proteins and metabolic sensors at the post-transcriptional level and related functions need to be confirmed in further experiments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We found that field body temperature was determined largely by the temperature of the micro-environment. Field body temperatures of juveniles of P. nebulosum were below selected body temperature. The locomotor performance curve was maximized and reaches a plateau between 30 and 35 degrees C, with 35 degrees C being the temperature at which maximum performance was obtained for analyzed individuals. The plateau values were close to the selected body temperature (T-sel) obtained for the studied frogs. In field conditions the locomotor performance was determinated by the substrate temperature. Apparently, juveniles of P. nebulosum show thermal coadaptation because the selected body temperature and the optimum temperature for locomotion had close values.

The aim of this study was to develop highdensity body maps of temperature sensitivity in pwMS to inform the design of patient -centred personal comfort systems. Fourteen pwMS (6 M/8 F; 48.6 +/- 10.0 y) and 13 healthy individuals (CTR; 5 M/8 F; 47.8 +/- 10.4) underwent a quantitative sensory test in a thermoneutral environment, during which they rated their local thermal sensations arising from the application of warm (39 degrees C) and cold (27 degrees C) stimuli to 115 bilateral body sites across the face, torso, upper and lower limbs. We used a z -transformation to create maps of hypo- and hyper -sensitivity for each individual MS participant using normative CTR data. We found that 50\% of pwMS (N = 7/14) presented a loss of cold sensitivity over the upper limb, and a loss of warm sensitivity over the feet. Furthermore, 36\% of pwMS (N = 5) presented warm hyper -sensitivity over the upper limb. Finally, cold sensitivity loss and warm sensitivity gain were more evenly distributed and affected a greater proportion of skin sites in MS (i.e. cold hypo -sensitivity = 44\% of tested sites; warm hyper -sensitivity = 14\%) than warm sensitivity loss (i.e. 10\%), which was more focused on sites such as the feet.

article,The carryover effects of embryonic incubation temperature on subsequent growth and thermal tolerance in white sturgeon,"Cheung, Katherine and Nelson-Flower, Martha J. and Mcadam, Steve and Brauner, Colin J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Environmental variation experienced during early periods of development can lead to persistent phenotypic alteration, known as carryover effects. Such effects increase concern for threatened or endangered species such as the white sturgeon ( Acipenser transmontanus ), particularly considering expected thermal changes due to climate change. We evaluated how temperature during embryonic development affects physiological parameters such as larval and early juvenile growth and thermal tolerance. Nechako River white sturgeon embryos were incubated at different environmental temperatures (T e ) of 12 degrees C (the natural spawning temperature of this population), 15 degrees C (the hatchery incubation temperature), and 18 degrees C (representing potential increases in river temperatures given global climate change). After hatch, fish were reared at a common 15 degrees C for 80 days post -hatch (dph). Individuals from each temperature treatment were tested for thermal tolerance using the critical thermal maximum method (CT max ), euthanized, and measured. Fish were examined at regular intervals from 13 to 80 dph, which bridged the time from the start of exogenous feeding through the transition into early juveniles. We found carryover effects of high embryonic T e in the short term for both thermal tolerance and growth. Fish that developed at 18 degrees C had the lowest thermal tolerance during the start of exogenous feeding. However, differences in thermal tolerance were small for early juveniles and were unlikely to be ecologically relevant in the longer term. Fish that developed at 18 degrees C were smallest over the observation period, indicating a possible cost for survival from increasing environmental temperatures during embryonic development. This research represents a window into a critical period of development during which fish are particularly vulnerable to climatic variation, and shows that cooler temperatures (12 degrees C) during incubation are optimal for this population. The results can inform environmental managers on the best strategies to help conserve current white sturgeon populations across their range.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103860,121,NA,NA,103860,White sturgeon; Critical thermal maximum; Thermal tolerance; Carryover effects; Embryonic developmental temperature; Acclimation; Acipenser transmontanus

Our results show an induction of autophagy in healthy fibroblasts and PBMCs from healthy donors and ME/CFS patients. ME/CFS patients have higher mitochondrial function compared to healthy donors.

article,Thermal limits along tropical elevational gradients: Poison frog tadpoles show plasticity but maintain divergence across elevation,"Paez-Vacas, Monica I. and Funk, W. Chris",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature is arguably one of the most critical environmental factors impacting organisms at molecular, organismal, and ecological levels. Temperature variation across elevation may cause divergent selection in physiological critical thermal limits (CTMAX and CTMIN). Generally, high elevation populations are predicted to withstand lower environmental temperatures than low elevation populations. Organisms can also exhibit phenotypic plasticity when temperature varies, although theory and empirical evidence suggest that tropical ectotherms have relatively limited ability to acclimate. To study the effect of temperature variation along elevational transects on thermal limits, we measured CTMAX and CTMIN of 934 tadpoles of a poison frog species, Epipedobates anthonyi, along two elevational gradients (200-1700 m asl) in southwestern Ecuador to investigate their thermal tolerance across elevation. We also tested if tadpoles could plastically shift their critical thermal limits in response to exposure to different temperatures representing the range of temperatures they experience in nature (20 degrees C, 24 degrees C, and 28 degrees C). Overall, we found that CTMAX did not change across elevation. In contrast, CTMIN was lower at higher elevations, suggesting that elevational variation in temperature influences this thermal trait. Moreover, all populations shifted their CTMAX and CTMIN according to treatment temperatures, demonstrating an acclimation response. Overall, trends in CTMIN among high, mid, and low elevation populations were maintained despite plastic responses to treatment temperature. These results demonstrate that, for tadpoles of E. anthonyi across tropical elevational gradients, temperature acts as a selective force for CTMIN, even when populations show acclimation abilities in both, CTMAX and CTMIN. Our findings advance our understanding on how environmental variation affects organisms' evolutionary trajectories and their abilities to persist in a changing climate in a tropical biodiversity hotspot.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103815,120,NA,NA,103815,Thermal limits; Tropical mountains; Aquatic ectotherms; Acclimation; Amphibians

article,Weak sex-specific evolution of locomotor activity of<i> Sepsis</i><i> punctum</i> (Diptera: Sepsidae) thermal experimental evolution lines,"Kjaersgaard, Anders and Blanckenhorn, Wolf U. and Berger, David and Esperk, Toomas",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Elevated temperatures are expected to rise beyond what the physiology of many organisms can tolerate. Behavioural responses facilitating microhabitat shifts may mitigate some of this increased thermal selection on physiology, but behaviours are themselves mediated by physiology, and any behavioural response may trade-off against other fitness-related activities. We investigated whether experimental evolution in different thermal regimes (Cold: 15 degrees C; Hot: 31 degrees C; Intergenerational fluctuation 15/31 degrees C; Control: 23 degrees C) resulted in genetic differentiation of standard locomotor activity in the dung fly Sepsis punctum. We assessed individual locomotor performance, an integral part of most behavioral repertoires, across eight warm temperatures from 24 degrees C to 45 degrees C using an automated device. We found no evidence for generalist-specialist trade-offs (i.e. changes in the breadth of the performance curve) for this trait. Instead, at the warmest assay temperatures hot-selected flies showed somewhat higher maximal performance than all other, especially cold-selected flies, overall more so in males than females. Yet, the flies' temperature optimum was not higher than that of the cold-selected flies, as expected under the `hotter-is-better' hypothesis.

article,Negative effects of the spatial clumping of thermal resources on lizard thermoregulation in a fragmented habitat,"Llanos-Garrido, Alejandro and Santos, Tomas and Diaz, Jose A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In ecosystems threatened by the expansion of croplands, habitat fragmentation and climate change, two of the main extinction drivers, may have thermoregulation-mediated interacting effects on demographic trends of terrestrial ectotherms. We studied the thermal biology of a metapopulation of the widespread Mediterranean lacertid Psammodromus algirus in ten fragments of evergreen or deciduous oak forests interspersed among cereal fields. We obtained thermoregulation statistics (selected temperature range, body and operative temperatures, thermal quality of the habitat, and precision, accuracy, and effectiveness of thermoregulation) that could be compared among fragments and with conspecific populations living in unfragmented habitat. We also measured the selection (use vs. availability) and spatial distribution of sunlit and shaded patches used for behavioral thermoregulation in fragments, and we estimated operative temperatures and thermal habitat quality in the agricultural matrix surrounding the fragments. Variation of the thermal environment was much larger within fragments than among them, and thermoregulation was accurate, precise, and efficient throughout the fragmented landscape; its effectiveness was similar to that of previously studied unfragmented populations. The average distance between sunlit and shaded patches was shorter in deciduous than in evergreen fragments, producing a more clumped distribution of the mosaic of thermal resources. Consequently, in evergreen habitat the cost of thermoregulation was higher, because lizards were more selective in their choice of sunlit sites (i.e. they used sunlit patches closer to shade and refuge than expected at random, and the extent of such selection was larger than at deciduous habitat). Temperatures available in croplands were too high to allow lizard dispersal, at least in the post-breeding season. This result confirms the role of croplands as a thermal barrier that promotes inbreeding and associated fitness losses in isolated fragments, and it forecasts a dark future for populations of forest lizards in agricultural landscapes under the combined effects of habitat fragmentation and global warming.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103604,115,NA,NA,103604,Croplands; Habitat fragmentation; Lacertidae; Refuge availability; Thermal barrier; Thermoregulation

A total of 3024 data were obtained for the physiological variables of the sheep exposed to the eight thermal conditions in the climatic chamber and in ambient condition, kept three days in each thermal condition. A principal component analysis summarized the measurements of physiological variables into only one variable (y1).

article,Ranavirus infection does not reduce heat tolerance in a larval amphibian,"Dallas, Jason W. and Warne, Robin W.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Extreme heat events and emerging infectious diseases negatively impact wildlife populations, but the interacting effects of infection and host heat tolerance remain understudied. The few studies covering this subject have demonstrated that pathogens lower the heat tolerance of their hosts, which places infected hosts at a greater risk experiencing lethal heat stress. Here, we studied how ranavirus infection influenced heat tolerance in larval wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus). In line with similar studies, we predicted the elevated costs of ranavirus infection would lower heat tolerance, measured as critical thermal maximum (CTmax), compared to uninfected controls. Ranavirus infection did not reduce CTmax and there was a positive relationship between CTmax and viral loads. Our results demonstrate that ranavirus-infected wood frog larvae had no loss in heat tolerance compared to uninfected larvae, even at viral loads associated with high mortality rates, which contradicts the common pattern for other pathogenic infections in ectotherms. Larval anurans may prioritize maintenance of their CTmax when infected with ranavirus to promote selection of warmer temperatures during behavioral fever that can improve pathogen clearance. Our study represents the first to examine the effect of ranavirus infection on host heat tolerance, and because no decline in CTmax was observed, this suggests that infected hosts would not be under greater risk of heat stress.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103584,114,NA,NA,103584,CTmax; Ranavirus; Thermal tolerance; Viral loads; Wood frogs

Santa Ines rams (n = 6) underwent evaluation of general and testicular physiological parameters (heart and respiratory rates, internal and scrotal temperatures, internal-scrotal temperature gradient, scrotal distention, and color Doppler ultrasound evaluation of the spermatic cords and spectral analyses of testicular arteries) over six consecutive weeks per season at three separate times daily (morning = 8:00 a.m., noon = 12:00 p.m., and afternoon = 5:00 p.m.) during the RS and LS. Climatic air temperature and relative humidity data were recorded, and the temperature and humidity index (THI) was calculated. Higher thermal challenge was observed in LS relative to RS (air temperature = 28.0 vs. 30.9 degrees C; relative humidity = 84.1 vs. 69.9\%; THI = 80.0 vs. 82.5; P < 0.05). In both seasons, respiratory rate and internal temperature were normal, demonstrating the animals' adaptability. In RS, however, a higher scrotal temperature was recorded in relation to LS (35.0 vs. 34.7 degrees C; P < 0.05), with a gradual increase from morning to afternoon. Lower resistivity (0.40 vs. 0.64; P < 0.05) and pulsatility (0.55 vs. 1.14; P < 0.05) indices, and a higher rate of high-velocity blood flow of testicular arteries (71.1 vs. 60.6\%; P < 0.05) were observed in RS compared to LS.

We studied the body heating of six butterfly species of the genus Erebia (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) that co-occur in the European Alps. We tested whether butterfly physical characteristics (body size, wing loading) are responsible for the inter-specific differences in body temperatures recorded previously under natural conditions. We used a thermal camera to measure body heating of wild butterfly individuals in a laboratory experiment with artificial light and heating sources. We revealed that physical characteristics had a small effect on explaining inter-specific differences in mean body temperatures recorded in the field. Our results show that larger butterflies, with higher weight and wing loading, heated up more slowly but reached the same asymptotic body temperature as smaller butterflies. Altogether, our results suggest that differences in body temperatures among Erebia species observed in the field might be caused mainly by species-specific microhabitat use and point towards an important role of active behavioural thermoregulation in adult butterflies. We speculate that microclimate heterogeneity in mountain habitats facilitates behavioural thermoregulation of adults. Similarly, microclimate structuring might also increase survival of less mobile butterfly life stages, i.e., eggs, larvae and pupae. Thus, landscape hetero-geneity in management practices may facilitate long term survival of montane invertebrates under increased anthropogenic pressures.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103502,113,NA,NA,103502,Alpine species; Ecophysiology; Habitat use; Lepidoptera; Thermal camera

Twelve participants wearing firefighting protective equipment with the liquid cooling garment (LCG group) and without the liquid cooling garment (CON group) were recruited to conduct human trials in a climate chamber. During the trials, physiological parameters (mean skin temperature (Tsk), core temperature (Tc), and heart rate (HR)) and psychological parameters (thermal sensation vote (TSV), thermal comfort vote (TCV), and rating of perceived exertion (RPE)) were measured continuously. The heat storage, sweating loss, physiological strain index (PSI), and perceptual strain index (PeSI) were calculated. The results indicated that the liquid cooling garment decreased the mean skin temperature (maximum value of 0.62 degrees C), scapula skin tem-perature (maximum value of 1.90 degrees C), sweating loss (26\%), and PSI (0.95 scales) with a significant difference (p < 0.05) at some time points when compared with the CON group. Moreover, the liquid cooling garment had little influence (p > 0.05) on core temperature, heart rate, TSV, TCV, RPE, and PeSI. The association analysis indicated that psychological strain had the potential to predict physiological heat strain with an R2 value of 0.86 between the PeSI and PSI.

Such modulation may be particularly important in the case of hosts that modify the physical habitat structure. By transforming the habitats, ecosystem engineers alter resource availability and modulate environmental conditions which, in turn, indirectly shape the community associated with that habitat. Endolithic cyanobacteria are known to reduce the body temperatures of infested mussels and here, we assessed whether the thermal benefits of endoliths on the intertidal reef-building mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis extends to the invertebrate community utilising mussel beds as habitat. Artificial reefs of biomimetic mussels either colonised or not colonised by microbial endoliths were used to test whether infauna species (the limpet Patella vulgata, the snail Littorina littorea and mussel recruits) in a mussel bed with symbionts experience lower body temperatures than those within a bed composed of mussels without symbionts. We found that infaunal individuals benefitted from being surrounded by mussels with symbionts, an effect that may be particularly critical during intense heat stress.

This study was designed to delineate the effects of prenatal thermal stress on serum levels of acute-phase proteins (APPs), namely ceruloplasmin (CPN) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), the regulation of brain mRNA levels of heat shock protein (Hsp) 70, and serum levels of corticosterone (CORT) in embryos and neonatal chicks. Hatching eggs were subjected to three thermal treatments; (i) standard optimum temperature throughout (SS: 37.8 degrees C and 56 \% RH), (ii) heat stress for 12 h daily (HS: 40.0 degrees C and 56 \% RH), and (iii) cold stress for 12 h daily 18 (CS: 30.2 degrees C and 56 \% RH). The heat and cold stress treatments were imposed from the 10th to the 18th day of incubation (ED). Results showed that thermal stress had a negligible effect on hatchability rate and body temperatures of neonatal chicks. The CS treatment was detrimental to embryonic growth. The HS treatment elevated AGP (ED 16, ED 18, and post-hatch day 1), CPN (on post-hatch day 1), and CORT (ED 14). On the contrary, the CS embryos had reduced AGP (ED14, ED16, ED18, and post-hatch day 1), CPN (ED 16), and CORT (ED 14, ED 16, ED 18).

The results showed that acclimation temperature improves growth and feed utilization with a quadratic effect (P < 0.05). The highest performance was observed at 32 degrees C, but fish acclimated at 37 degrees C decreased growth and feed utilization. In addition, skin darkening was observed in fish acclimated with increasing temperatures.

Yet, developmental thermal acclimation can play an important role in shaping physiological, morphological, and behavioral traits at the adult stage. We explored how three rearing temperatures (10, 20, and 28 degrees C) affected host-foraging behaviors and associated traits under warm conditions in the parasitoid Aphidius colemani, a key model in behavioral ecology and an important natural enemy of aphids. Developmental time was longer at lower temperatures, resulting in bigger emerging parasitoids, with higher egg-loads. Parasitism rates, emergence rates, and parasitoid survival (once placed at high temperature) were the highest for parasitoids developed at 20 degrees C. When exposed to 28 degrees C, the expression of all behavioral items (time spent walking searching for hosts, number of antennal and ovipositor contacts with hosts) was higher for parasitoids reared at 20 degrees C, followed by those reared at 10 degrees C, then those reared at 28 degrees C. Finally, we showed that parasitoid residence time on aphid patches was determined by both developmental temperatures and the number of host encounter without oviposition, representative of the resource quality. We revealed that developing at 28 degrees C did not lead to increased adult performance at this temperature, probably because of complex interactions and trade-offs between developmental costs at high temperature and optimal foraging behaviors (e.g., parasitoid size and host-handling capacities). Our results strengthen the idea that thermal developmental plasticity may play an important role in insect behavioral responses to varying temperatures, and is important to consider in the context of climate change.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103140,103,NA,NA,103140,Rearing temperature; Developmental plasticity; Acclimation; Aphid; Climate change; Heat; Behavior
article,Nature versus nurture in heat stress induced learning between inbred and outbred populations of Lymnaea stagnalis,"Rivi, Veronica and Batabyal, Anuradha and Benatti, Cristina and Mc Blom, Johanna and Lukowiak, Ken",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Changing environmental conditions often lead to microevolution of traits that are adaptive under the current selection pressure. Currently, one of the major selection pressures is the rise in temperatures globally that has a severe impact on the behavioral ecology of animals. However, the role of thermal stress on neuronal plasticity and memory formation is not well understood. Thermal tolerance and sensitivity to heat stress show variation across populations of the same species experiencing different thermal regimes. We used two populations of the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis: one lab-bred W-snails and the other wild Delta snails to test heat shock induced learning and memory formation for the Garcia effect learning paradigm. In Garcia effect, a single pairing of a heat stressor (30 degrees C for 1h) with a novel taste results in a taste-specific negative hedonic shift lasting 24h as longterm memory (LTM) in lab bred W-snails. In this study we used a repeated heat stress procedure to test for increased or decreased sensitivity to the heat before testing for the Garcia effect. We found that lab-bred W-snails show increased sensitivity to heat stress after repeated heat exposure for 7days, leading to enhanced LTM for Garcia effect with only 15min of heat exposure instead of standard 1h. Surprisingly, the freshly collected wild snails do not show Garcia effect. Additionally, F1 generation of wild snails raised and maintained under laboratory conditions still retain their heat stress tolerance similar to their parents and do not show a Garcia effect under standard learning paradigm or even after repeated heat stressor. Thus, we found a differential effect of heat stress on memory formation in wild and lab bred snails.

article,Asian gypsy moth (<i>Lymantria dispar</i> L.) populations: Tolerance of eggs to extreme winter temperatures,"Ananko, G. G. and Kolosov, V, A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Gypsy moth Lymantria dispar (GM) is a polyphagous insect and one of the most significant pests in the forests of Eurasia and North America (U.S. and Canada). Accurate information on GM cold-hardiness is needed to improve methods for the prediction of population outbreaks, as well as for forecasting possible GM range displacements due to climate change. As a result of laboratory and field studies, we found that the lower lethal temperature (at which all eggs die) range from -29.0 degrees C to -29.9 degrees C for three studied populations of L. dispar asiatica, and no egg survived cooling to -29.9 degrees C. These limits agree, to within one degree, with the previously established cold-hardiness limits of the European subspecies L. dispar, which is also found in North America. This coincidence indicates that the lower lethal temperature of L. dispar is conservative. Thus, we found that the Siberian populations of GM inhabit an area where winter temperatures go beyond the limits of egg physiological tolerance, because temperatures often fall below -30 degrees C. Apparently, it is due to the flexibility of ovipositional behavior that L. dispar asiatica survives in Siberia: the lack of physiological tolerance of eggs is compensated by choosing warm biotopes for oviposition. One of the most important factors contributing to the survival of GM eggs in Siberia is the stability of the snow cover.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103123,102,NA,NA,103123,Gypsy moth; Insect cold-hardiness; Winter survival; Temperature extremes; Forest insect outbreaks; Climatic constraints
article,"Thermal tolerance of cyprinids along an urban-rural gradient: Plasticity, repeatability and effects of swimming and temperature shock","Nelson, Jay A. and Rieger, Kelly J. and Gruber, Danielle and Cutler, Melinda and Buckner, Bailee and Oufiero, Christopher E.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Urbanization changes the thermal profile of streams in much the same way that climate change is predicted to with higher temperatures, more varied flow and rapid temperature pulses with precipitation events. Whether exceptional tolerance to these altered thermal conditions is a pre-requisite for a fish species to inhabit urban streams or if urbanization has changed the thermal physiology of those fish species that persist in urban streams is unknown, but could help predict the outcome of future climate disruption. To test whether residence in urban streams is associated with altered thermal tolerance, we compared thermal tolerance (CTMax) and phenotypic plasticity of thermal tolerance (Delta CTMax/Delta acclimation temperature) in five populations of an urban-tolerant cyprinid, the blacknose dace (Rhinichthys atratulus), from multiple watersheds along an urban/rural gradient. Thermal tolerance of these stream fish was tested while swimming at 10 cm{*}s(-1) but also in static water and after thermal shocks of 4 degrees-6 degrees C simulating precipitation events. To test whether blacknose dace as a species has unusual thermal tolerance or thermal plasticity, we also compared two blacknose dace populations with two co-resident, co-familiars (creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) and rosyside dace (Clinostomus funduloides), that don't persist in urban streams at three different acclimation temperatures. Thermal tolerance of blacknose dace, as measured by a critical thermal maximum test (CTMax), was independent of size and activity level, i.e. individuals had identical thermal tolerance whether swimming or resting and CTMax was significantly repeatable across two levels of activity. Although there was some variance among populations, blacknose dace from streams of varied urbanization generally exhibited comparable thermal tolerances, ability to acclimate to different temperatures and were unaffected by thermal shocks. Rosyside dace had significantly lower thermal tolerance than the other two species but plasticity of thermal tolerance was uniform across the three cyprinid species. Our conclusions are that exceptional thermal tolerance or ability to thermally acclimate are not pre-requisite characters for a given cyprinid species to survive in urban streams, nor has thermal tolerance undergone directional selection in this urban environment.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103047,100,NA,NA,103047,Thermal tolerance; Plasticity; Urbanization; Cyprinid; CTMax
article,Integrated metabolome and transcriptome analyses revealing the effects of thermal stress on lipid metabolism in juvenile turbot <i>Scophthalmus maximus</i>,"Zhao, Tingting and Ma, Aijun and Yang, Shuangshuang and Huang, Zhihui",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"To gain insights into the influence of heat stress on lipid metabolism in juvenile turbot (Scophthalmus maximus), we analyzed the correlations between data obtained by transcriptome sequencing and metabolome sequencing of the kidney under different high temperature stimuli (20 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 28 degrees C) and control conditions (14 degrees C). We identified the differentially expressed genes and metabolites, which were found to be enriched in seven pathways (steroid hormone biosynthesis, primary bile acid biosynthesis, glycerophospholipid metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, glycerolipid metabolism and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids) associated with lipid metabolism, according to KEGG pathway analysis. After correlation analysis of these differentially expressed genes, the most representative genes (lpcat2, Etnk1, TAZ, SCP2, ch25hl and gpd1l) and metabolites (citicoline, UPD-6-sulfoquinovose, dihydroxyacetone, taurine and o-phosphocholine) were selected according to their correlation coefficients. These genes and metabolites were found to be the key points to regulate lipid deposition and maintain lipid homeostasis through varying degrees of up-regulation or downregulation under heat stress, so as to relieve the disorder of lipid metabolism caused by heat stress, which is of great significance for breeding new heat-resistant varieties of turbot and provides a reliable theoretical basis for optimizing actual production.

Fifty-three uncastrated and clinically healthy bulls with birth and weaning weight of 34.0 ? 3.32 kg and 215.5 ? 44.75 kg, respectively, were evaluated. Fifteen canonical correlations were estimated, but only six were significant: thermal environment ? thermoregulatory responses (rc = 0.4635; P = 0.0413); thermal environment ? performance (rc = 0.4338; P = 0.0218); thermoregulatory responses ? performance (rc = 0.5119; P = 0.0071); hair coat characteristics ? performance (rc = 0.4939; P = 0.0273); hormone ? carcass traits (rc = 0.5408; P = 0.0698); and performance ? carcass traits (rc = 0.9644; P < 0.0001). Thermal environment, thermoregulatory responses and hair coat morphology influence of 18.81\%, 21.49\% and 24.40\%, respectively, were found in the performance. We also concluded that (i) rectal temperature (RT) is a homoeothermic indicator; (ii) sweating rate (SR) is an important heat dissipation mechanism to explain the adaptation of zebu animals in the tropics and is related to weight at 550 days (W550); (iii) coat morphology, especially length (HL), diameter (HD) and hair density (ND) are related to animal performance; and (iv) hormonal profile, mainly T4, influences the carcass traits (yield, weight, subcutaneous fat and marble meat).",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102814,96,NA,NA,102814,Adaption; Beef cattle; Bos indicus; Hair coat; Homeostasis; Hot climate; Thyroid

In this study, we analyse how laboratory populations of the ectotherm species Drosophila subobscura, originally from two distinct latitudes and evolving for several generations in a stable thermal environment (18 degrees C), respond plastically to new thermal challenges. We measured adult performance (fecundity traits as a fitness proxy) of the experimental populations when exposed to five thermal regimes, three with the same temperature during development and adulthood (15-15 degrees C, 18-18 degrees C, 25-25 degrees C), and two where flies developed at 18 degrees C and were exposed, during adulthood, to either 15 degrees C or 25 degrees C. Here, we test whether (1) flies undergo stress at the two more extreme temperatures; (2) development at a given temperature enhances adult performance at such temperature (i.e. acclimation), and (3) populations with different biogeographical history show plasticity differences. Our findings show (1) an optimal performance at 18 degrees C only if flies were subjected to the same temperature as juveniles and adults; (2) the occurrence of developmental acclimation at lower temperatures; (3) detrimental effects of higher developmental temperature on adult performance; and (4) a minor impact of historical background on thermal response. Our study indicates that thermal plasticity during development may have a limited role in helping adults cope with warmer - though not colder - temperatures, with a potential negative impact on population persistence under climate change. It also emphasizes the importance of analysing the impact of temperature on all stages of the life cycle to better characterize the thermal limits.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102580,90,NA,NA,102580,Thermal plasticity; Heat stress; Cold stress; Developmental acclimation; Fecundity; Drosophila
article,Standardized ethograms and a device for assessing amphibian thermal responses in a warming world,"Meza-Parral, Yocoyani and Garcia-Robledo, Carlos and Pineda, Eduardo and Escobar, Federico and Donnelly, Maureen A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Most predictions of how populations and species of ectotherms will respond to global warming are based on estimates of the temperature at which organisms lose motor control (i.e., CTmax - the Critical Thermal Maximum). Here, we describe a non-lethal protocol and ethograms to estimate the relative tolerance of amphibians to increasing temperatures. These methods-suitable for field or laboratory conditions-are replicable, inexpensive and applicable to both post-metamorphic stages and organisms with direct development. We illustrate the use of this standardized protocol for four amphibians from a tropical cloud forest in Veracruz, Mexico with contrasting life histories: a lungless salamander (Aquiloeurycea cafetalera: Plethodontidae), a leaf-litter frog (Craugastor rhodopis: Craugastoridae), a semiaquatic frog (Lithobates berlandieri: Ranidae), and a tree frog (Rheohyla miotympanum: Hylidae). We identified four behavioral responses preceding CTmax for all amphibians included in this study: 1) Optimal Activity Range, 2) Supra-optimal Activity Range, 3) Heat Stress Range, and 4) Involuntary Movements Range. Additionally, we identified a fifth parameter associated with resilience to heat shock: 5) Recovery Stage after reaching CTmax. We conclude that the behavioral responses preceding the Critical Thermal Maximum are as informative as CTmax. Using behavioral responses to estimate thermal tolerance has the additional advantage of reducing the risk of injury or death of amphibians during physiological experiments.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102565,89,NA,NA,102565,Amphibians; Behavioral responses; Frogs; Salamanders; Thermal tolerance arena; Thermal stress

J. and Tomberlin, Jeffery K. and Tarone, Aaron M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Determining the thermal tolerance of an organism is important when assessing its activity time and survival rate in a given environment. However, thermal tolerance is not a static trait and may be influenced by a number of environmental and organismal factors. We report the results of three experiments investigating the effects of environmental temperature, exposure duration, age, sex, and nutrient availability on the upper thermal tolerance of the adult secondary screwworm, Cochliomyia macellaria. The probability of knockdown and survival was determined using a static method for different environmental temperatures (22, 40, 42, 44, or 45 degrees C), exposure durations (1, 2, 4, or 6 h), and nutrient availabilities (no food or water, water only, or both food and water) for both sexes and two age classes (young = 7-9 days post pupal emergence, old = 10-12 days post pupal emergence). In general, environmental temperature and exposure duration had the greatest effects on both the probability of knockdown and survival. As temperature or duration increased, the probability of knockdown increased while the probability of survival decreased. The availability of nutrients (water only or food and water) increased thermal tolerance at moderate temperatures (42 and 44 degrees C), but had no effect at 45 degrees C. Female flies were more thermally tolerant than males, regardless of nutrient availability. And age exhibited negligible effects on the probabilities of knockdown or survival, regardless of nutrient availability. These data show multiple environmental factors affected the thermal tolerance of C. macellaria.

For this purpose, five hundred and forty apparently healthy O. niloticus were allocated into nine groups fed three DRLM-supplemented diets (0,1, and 3\%) and reared at three water temperature (18, 24, and 32 degrees C) in a 3 x 3 total randomized factorial design. The results revealed that exposure of fish to low (18 degrees C) or high (32 degrees C) temperatures for 30 days evoked significant growth retardation, depleted antioxidant enzymes activities (Catalase; CAT and super oxide dismutase; SOD), lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde; MDA), immunosuppression, altered cortisol level compared to those reared at 24 degrees C. Moreover, a marked down-regulation of oxidative stress related genes with up-regulation of interleukin 1 beta gene were apparent. In contrast, DRLM incorporation, particularly at 3\%, in heat or cold stressed fish diets significantly enhanced growth, restored IgM and lysozymes levels, and SOD and CAT activities. Also, both the MDA and cortisol levels were significantly depressed. Furthermore, both antioxidant and immune-related genes expression were significantly corrected.

article,Heat tolerance of Fire Service Instructors,"Watkins, Emily R. and Hayes, Mark and Watt, Peter and Richardson, Alan J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Objectives: Fire Service Instructors (FSI) experience repeated fire exposures a median of 13 +/- 8 times a month; consequently they may develop an acclimatised state. However, the chronic immunological implications of heat acclimation are yet to be understood. This study aimed to establish whether FSI exhibit an increased heat tolerance and altered immunological response to heat exposures, compared to non-exposed individuals. The study also aimed to identify if heat tolerance is related to symptoms of ill health. Methods: Twenty-two participants were recruited: 11 FSI (age: 41 +/- 7 yrs, body mass: 77.4 +/- 12.2 kg, height: 174.1 +/- 8.2 cm) and 11 non-exposed controls (CON) (age: 41 +/- 7 yrs, body mass: 75.9 +/- 12.2 kg, height: 177.0 +/- 8.1 cm). Participants completed a 40 min heat occupational tolerance test (HOTT) exercising at 6 W kg(-1) (50.0 +/- 1.0 degrees C, 12.3 +/- 3.3\% relative humidity) on two occasions, separated by 2 months. Physiological and perceptual measures were collected throughout and venous blood samples were collected prior to and post exposure. Results: FSI displayed significantly reduced peak rectal temperature (T-re) (-0.42 degrees C), change in T-re (-0.33 degrees C), and thermal sensation (-1.0) and increased sweat rate (+0.25 L h(-1)) at the end of the HOTT compared to CON (p < 0.05). FSI exhibited similar responses to the HOTT as CON for all haematological variables. However, resting interleukin-6, interleukin-1 beta, and immunoglobulin G were significantly greater in FSI than CON. There was no difference in responses following the 2 month working period. FSI peak T-re was negatively correlated with symptoms of ill health (r(pb) = -0.473, p = 0.026) and the number of fire exposures in the previous 2 weeks (r(s) = -0.589, p = 0.004).

Our study aimed to identify the environmental variables influencing cavity temperatures during summer (June-July) in quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) in southeastern Idaho. We collected temperature data between June 22 and July 27, 2015 using iButtons distributed across 30 tree cavities in 30 aspen stands in the Craters of the Moon National Monument, Idaho. We used every third day of data to ensure temporal independence amongst readings from the same cavity. We used a multi-model selection framework to examine how environmental characteristics might influence cavity thermal environments, and we modeled how environmental variables, tree, and cavity characteristics might influence daily maximum cavity temperatures. Cavity temperatures ranged as low as 1 degrees C to as high as 46 degrees C. Approximately 13\% of the cavities experienced temperatures above 40 degrees C for at least an hour, and these temperatures are noted to be lethal to developing avian embryos. The two top competing models explaining the daily maximum cavity temperatures included tree diameter at cavity height, canopy cover, cavity orientation, and daily maximum ambient temperature. Daily maximum cavity temperatures were significantly associated with daily maximum ambient temperatures and canopy cover; warmer cavities were positively associated with wanner ambient temperatures and negatively associated with canopy cover. Because cavities in aspen are an important resource for multiple species, understanding the factors that influence the microdimate of tree cavities can have broad implications for cavity using species in the context of changing climates.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.02.011,81,NA,41-48,NA,Microclimate; Aspen; Woodpeckers; Cavity users; Birds; Bats
article,"The costs of living in a thermal fluctuating environment for the tropical haematophagous bug, <i>Rhodnius prolixus</i>","Rolandi, Carmen and Schilman, Pablo E.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Environmental temperature is an abiotic factor with great influence on biological processes of living beings. Jensen's inequality states that for non-lineal processes, such as most biological phenomena, the effects of thermal fluctuations cannot be predicted from mean constant temperatures. We studied the effect of daily temperature fluctuation (DTF) on Rhodnius prolixus, a model organism in insect physiology, and an important vector of Chagas disease. We measured development time from egg to adult, fecundity, fertility, body mass reduction rate (indirect measurement of nutrient consumption rates) and survival after a single blood meal. Insects were reared at constant temperature (24 degrees C), or with a DTF (17-32 degrees C; mean = 24 degrees C). Taking into account Jensen's inequality as well as the species tropical distribution, we predict that living in a variable thermal environment will have higher costs than inhabiting a stable one. Development time and fertility were not affected by DTF. However, fecundity was lower in females reared at DTF than at constant temperature, and males had higher body mass reduction rate and lower survival in the DTF regime, suggesting higher costs associated to fluctuating thermal environments. At a population and epidemiological level, higher energetic costs would imply an increase in nutrient consumption rate, biting frequency, and, consequently increasing disease transmission from infected insects. On the contrary, lower fecundity could be associated with a decrease in population growth. This knowledge will not only provide basic information to the field of insect ecophysiology, but also could be a useful background to develop population and disease transmission models.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.03.022,74,NA,92-99,NA,Rhodnius prolixus; Survival time; Chagas disease; Constant temperature; Fluctuating temperature; Phenotypic plasticity

Gl, G2, and G3) and were kept in the different microenvironment by manipulation of shelter design. The G1 lambs were maintained at lower minimum temperature (8.59 0.71 C) in asbestos roofed shed, while G2 lambs were maintained at higher minimum temperature (14.59 0.54 C) in local handmade bamboo dome structure, and G3 lambs were kept at a medium minimum temperature (11.84 0.64 C) in thermocol insulated roofed shed from evening 18:30 h to morning 07:00 h. The study was carried out for one month between January and February. The parameters studied were physiological response (respiration rate, pulse rate, rectal temperature), skin temperature, blood metabolites and endocrine profile. The data were analyzed by general linear models. Higher average daily weight gain was recorded in the lambs kept in higher minimum temperature groups (20.54\% higher in G2 and 24.68\% higher in G3) as compared to G1 lambs. Microenvironment manipulation had no significant (P > 0.05) effect on most of the physiological response and skin temperature except morning respiration rate within low -temperature range. The present study reveals that Hb, PCV, T3, and cortisol level were significantly (P < 0.05) influenced by microenvironment manipulation.

In this study, the survival strategies of T. granarium fourth instar larvae were investigated at different sub-zero temperatures following different cooling rates, acclimation to different relative humidity (RH) and different starvation times. Our results show that larvae of T. granarium are freeze-intolerant. There was a strong link between cooling rates and supercooling point, which means the slower the decrease in temperature, the lower the supercooling point. Trehalose content was greater in insects cooled at a rate of 0.5 degrees C/min. According to results, the RH did not affect supercooling point. However, acclimation to an RH of 25\% increased mortality following exposure to - 10 degrees C/24 h. The time necessary to reach 95\% mortality was 1737 h and 428 h at - 5 degrees C and - 10 degrees C. The lowest lipid and trehalose content was detected in insects acclimated to 25\% RH, although, the different RH treatments did not significantly affect glycogen content of T. granarium larvae. The supercooling point of larvae was gradually increased following starvation. By contrast, fed larvae had the greatest lipid, glycogen, and trehalose content, and insects starved for eight days had the lowest energy contents. There was a sharp decline in the survival of larvae between 11 and - 18 degrees C after 1 h exposure.

Here we considered the whitefly Bemisia tabaci (MEAM 1), a phloem feeder and invasive species whose molecular stress response is an important mechanism for overcoming heat stress. We assessed the expression of the hsp23, 40, 70 and 90 genes at the mRNA level when submitted to heat shocks of 40 and 44 degrees C/1 h (control at 25 degrees C). For this, we evaluated a set of available and suitable reference genes in order to perform data normalization using the real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) technique, and then confirmed the production of HSP70 protein based on Western blot. Results were compared with the hardening capacity of B. tabaci, measured by fitness components as a response to heat shocks, using 40 degrees C as the induction temperature. Three of the four genes (hsp23, 70 and 90) were upregulated by heat stress at mRNA, showing differential expression patterns. Hsp70 expression was confirmed at the protein level. Hardening significantly increased fitness following heat stress, suggesting that HSPs may contribute to hardening capacity in B. tabaci.

We calculated the accuracy of thermoregulation, that is, the extent to which body temperatures are close to species' thermal optima, the thermal quality of the habitat as the proximity of operative temperatures to thermal optima and effectiveness of thermoregulation, as the extent to which accuracy is higher than thermal quality of the habitat We found that seasonality affects thermoregulation differently, depending on the lizard population. Those effects are consistent for all thermal parameters under study. The effects of seasonality were significantly stronger in Aire than in Colom islet. Many factors may be responsible for this different effect of seasonality, from differences on physiological traits to differences in the environmental conditions of the two islets, as their resource availability, predator pressure or habitat structure. Identifying the factors that boost or inhibit those seasonal changes would be important to understand thermoregulation in lizards.

The purpose of this research was to reveal the effects of clothing thermal resistance and operative temperature on local skin temperature (LST) and mean skin temperature (MST). The LSTs (at 32 sites) in stable condition were measured for different clothing thermal resistances 1.39, 0.5 and 0.1 do. To study the effect of environmental temperature on LST and MST, the LSTs were also measured for operative temperatures 23, 26 and 33 degrees C. The experimental data showed that the effect of clothing thermal resistance on the foot was greater compared to the other human parts, and the effect of operative temperature on many parts of the human body was great, such as foot, hand, trunk, and arm. The MSTs measured on the conditions that air speed was under 0.1 m/s, RH was about 30-70\%, and metabolic rate was about 1 met, were collected from previous studies. On the basis of these experimental data, a MST prediction equation with the operative temperature and clothing thermal resistance as independent variables, was obtained by multiple linear regression. This equation was a good alternative and provided convenience to predict the MST in different operative temperatures and clothing thermal resistances. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

article,N-acetylcysteine stimulates the proliferation and differentiation in heat-stressed skeletal muscle cells,"Lu, Jiawei and Zhao, Peng and Ding, Xiuhu and Li, Huixia",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is known for its beneficial effects on health due to its antioxidant and antiapoptotic properties. This study explored the protective effects of NAC against oxidative stress in heat-stressed (HS) skeletal muscle cells and its role in promoting muscle development. NAC reduced the heat shock response by decreasing the expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in HS-induced muscle cells during proliferation and differentiation. NAC also mitigated HS-induced oxidative stress via increasing the antioxidant enzyme levels and reducing oxidant enzyme levels. Treatment with NAC at 2 mM increased cell viability from 43.68\% f 5.14\%- 66.69\% f 14.43\% and decreased the apoptosis rate from 7.89\% f 0.53\%-5.17\% f 0.11\% in skeletal muscle cells. Additionally, NAC promoted the proliferation and differentiation of HS-induced skeletal muscle cells by upregulating the expression of PAX7, MYF5, MRF4 and MYHC. These findings suggest that NAC alleviates HSinduced oxidative damage in skeletal muscle cells and support muscle development.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103958,124,NA,NA,103958,N-Acetylcysteine; Skeletal muscle cells; Heat stress; Oxidative stress; Muscle development
article,Influence of thermal heat load accumulation on daily rumination time of lactating Holstein cows in a zone with temperate climate,"Mueschner-Siemens, Theresa and Palmini, Andrea and Heinicke, Julia and Hoffmann, Gundula and Belik, Vitaly and Amon, Thomas",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In the future, conflicts between animal welfare and climate change will gradually intensify. In the present study, we investigated the daily rumination time (RT) of lactating Holstein-Friesian cows in a zone with temperate climate and the effects of heat load duration and heat load intensity. Responses of individual cows to heat load were assessed, adjusting for milk yield, lactation number, days in milk as well as reproductive status and season. A total of 27,149 data points from 183 cows in a naturally ventilated barn in Brandenburg, Germany, were collected from June 2015 to May 2017. Ambient temperature and relative humidity were recorded at eight positions inside the barn every 5 min, and the temperature-humidity index (THI) was calculated. Based on THI, the degree of heat load was determined, using critical thresholds of THI = 68, 72, and 80. Daily RT was measured with a microphone-based sensor system (collar) on the cow's neck. The analysis models included autocorrelations in time series as well as individual cow-related effects. With each 5 min exposure to contemporaneous heat load, a decrease of approximately 1.17 min d(-1) in RT per cow from non-heat stress to heat stress conditions by exceeding THI >= 68 (p < 0.01). This effect was intensified by exceeding the critical THI thresholds of 68 and 72. As heat load duration and intensity increased, daily RT decreased in comparison to daily RT under non-stress conditions. High-yielding (>38.4 kg milk/day) cows were more influenced in rumination time than low-yielding (<= 28.8 kg milk/day) cows. With moderate contemporaneous heat load, RT decreased by 0.14 min d(-1) per 5 min in high-yielding cows compared to low-yielding cows under moderate heat load. A decrease of 0.1 min d(-1) was found in daily RT of mid-yielding cows. However, the delayed effects of heat load (one to three days after the heat stress event) were associated with days in milk and reproduction status. When the heat load duration lasted for several days, the responses were less pronounced than the impacts of contemporaneous heat load (when the heat stress event lasted for one day). Delayed mild heat load resulted in an increase in RT by 0.13 min d(-1) in lactating cows <= 60 DIM. This was also found with delayed moderate heat load. Lactating cows <= 60 DIM showed a rise of 0.09 min d(-1) in RT. RT also showed interactions with reproduction status of cows under delayed moderate heat stress. Lactating cows with <= 180 days of pregnancy showed an increase of 0.61 min d(-1) in RT. Similarly, cows with >180 days of pregnancy had 0.64 min d(-1) more RT compared to non-pregnant cows. Further analysis with higher temporal resolution of RT than data accumulation in 24-h blocks as well as the assessment of the correlation between feed composition, intake and rumination will elucidate the influence of heat load on daily RT.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103856,122,NA,NA,103856,Heat load duration; Heat load intensity; Rumination time; Cow -related effects

Along these lines, in this work, their comprehensive impact on people's overall comfort was systematically explored. Pedestrians' outdoor neutral points on various environmental parameters were found by performing linear regressions. Similarly, people's thermal perceptions (indicated by neutral temperatures, NT) were found to vary for both acoustic and light environments. They would be increasingly heat sensitive (R2 increases) in a noisier environment while the NTs varied for either sound or light intensity levels. From our analysis, it was demonstrated that people's overall comforts were negatively correlated with these parameters in different degrees.

Here, by using nickel chloride (NiCl2), a non-specific blocker of extracellular Ca2+ influx, we studied the input of extracellular Ca2+ on the regulation of papillary muscle (PM) contractility under normal and hypothermic conditions in ground squirrels (GS), and rats. By measuring isometric force of contraction, we studied how NiCl2 affects force-frequency relationship and the rest effect in PM of these species at 30degree celsius and 10degree celsius. We found that at 30degree celsius 1.5 mM NiCl2 significantly reduced force of contraction across entire frequency range in active GS and rats, whereas in hibernating GS force of contraction was reduced at low and high frequency range. Additionally, NiCl2 evoked spontaneous contractility in rats but not GS PM. The rest effect was significantly reduced by NiCl2 for active GS and rats but not hibernating GS. At 10 C, NiCl2 fully reduced contractility in active GS and, to a lesser extent, in rats, whereas in hibernating GS it was significant only at 0.3 Hz. The rest effect was significantly reduced by NiCl2 in both active and hibernating GS, whereas it was unmasked in rats that had high contractility under hypothermic conditions in control. Our results show a significant contribution of extracellular Ca2+ to myocardial contractility in GS not only in active but also in hibernating states, especially under hypothermic conditions, whereas limitation of extracellular Ca2+ influx in rats under hypothermia can play protective role for myocardial contractility.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103785,119,NA,NA,103785,Papillary muscle; Hypothermia; Force-frequency relation; Rest effect; Ni2+ cations; Hibernation

Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the thermographic profiles of the back of sport practitioners from different disciplines and compare it with those of sedentary healthy individuals. Method: The back of 160 healthy subjects were evaluated, and participants were grouped considering their sport practice: team sport (TS), individual sport (IS), weight training (WT), inactive (I). Three regions of interest were identified to analyze the cervical, thoracic and lumbar temperatures of the back. Results: The Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) resulted significant showing statistical differences for the cervical (p < 0.001), dorsal (p = 0.0011), and lumbar areas (p = 0.0366). The Tukey post-hoc test for pairwise comparison showed statistically significant differences between groups. For the cervical area significance was found between the IN and WT group (p = 0.002), the IN and IS group (p < 0.001), IN and TS group (p = 0.020). The dorsal area resulted significant between the IN and WT group (p = 0.007), the IN and IS group (p < 0.001), IN and TS group.

Currently, there is no effective and targeted approach for the treatment of HS. Despite growing evidence that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may reduce multiorgan damage and improve survival through immunomodulatory effects in several diseases, no one has tested whether MSCs have immunomodulatory effects in heatstroke. The present study focused on pathological changes and levels of the cytokines and immuno-globulins to investigate the mechanisms underlying the protective effect and the anti-inflammatory effects of MSCs. We found that MSCs treatment significantly reduced the 28-day mortality rate (P < 0.05), the levels of hepatic and renal function markers on day 1 (P < 0.01) and the pathological lesion scores of multiple organs in HS rats. The levels of IgG1, IgM, and IgA of the HS + MSC group was significantly higher than that in HS group on days 3 and 28(P < 0.05).

article,Effect of quilt thermal resistance on bedding system and sleep thermal comfort,"Yan, Fangying and Zheng, Qing and Ke, Ying",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Ambient temperature and the bedding thermal resistance are two key factors affecting sleepers' thermal comfort. Six duvets with thermal resistance of 3.81, 5.12, 6.19, 7.81, 8.75 and 8.93 clo were included to investigate the effects of duvet thermal resistance on the sleep thermal comfort zone. Six males and six females were enrolled in a whole night sleep experiment, and the ambient temperature of the sleep room was adjusted to be thermally comfortable. Skin temperature, bed climate temperature and sleep stages were all acquired. Subjective evaluations including thermal perception and sleep quality were also assessed through questionnaires. The results indicated that increasing the thermal resistance of duvets widened the thermal comfort zone of ambient temperature, with the highest thermal resistance ranging from 8.2 to 17.7 degrees C and the lowest from 16.4 to 22.2 degrees C. The upper and lower temperature limits of the comfort zone did not significantly differ in their effect on sleep quality.

In this context, this work proposes a new method for extracting characteristics for the temperature matrix obtained using IRT data from regions of the body surface of cows which, if associated with environmental variables through a machine learning algorithm it generates computational classifiers for heat stress condition. IRT data were collected from different parts of the body of 18 lactating cows housed in a free-stall, monitored for 40 non-consecutive days, three times a day (5:00 a.m., 1:00 p.m., and 7:00 p.m.), during summer and winter, along with physiological data (rectal temperature and respiratory rate) and meteorological data for each time. The IRT data is used to create a descriptor vector based on frequency, accounting for temperatures for a pre-defined range, referred to in the study as `Thermal Signature' (TS). The generated database was used for training and assessing computational models based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify heat stress conditions. The models were built using the following predictive attributes for each instance: TS, air temperature, black globe temperature and wet bulb temperature. The goal attribute used for supervised training was the heat stress level classification generated from the rectal temperature and respiratory rate values measured. The models based on different ANN architectures were compared through metrics of the confusion matrix between predicted and measured data, obtaining better results with 8 TS ranges. The best accuracy for classification into four heat stress levels (Comfort, Alert, Danger, and Emergency) was 83.29\% using the TS of the ocular region. The classifier for two heat levels of stress (Comfort and Danger) obtained accuracy of 90.10\% also using the 8 TS bands of the ocular region.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103609,115,NA,NA,103609,Infrared thermography; Animal welfare; Non-invasive measurement; Data mining; Artificial intelligence
article,Cutaneous warmth and hotness thresholds to radiation heat exposure at a distance of 10 cm from 17 body regions,"Kwon, JuYoun and Cho, Kayoung and Jung, Dahee and Lee, Joo-Young",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The purpose of the present study was to evaluate body regional differences in cutaneous warmth and hotness thresholds in relation to radiant heat exposure. Fourteen male subjects participated in this study (age: 25 \& PLUSMN; 5 y, height: 176.6 \& PLUSMN; 5.5 cm, body weight: 70 \& PLUSMN; 5.8 kg). Cutaneous warmth and hotness thresholds were measured on the forehead, neck, chest, abdomen, upper back, lower back, upper arm, forearm, palm, back of hand, front thigh, shin, top of foot, buttock, back thigh, calf, and sole. The forehead (34.8 \& PLUSMN; 0.2 degrees C), lower back (34.1 \& PLUSMN; 1.2 degrees C) and palm (34.3 \& PLUSMN; 0.7 degrees C) had the highest warmth thresholds, whereas the foot (29.8 \& PLUSMN; 1.9 degrees C) and sole (28.0 \& PLUSMN; 2.1 degrees C) had the lowest values among the 17 regions (P<0.001). Higher warmth thresholds were related to higher initial skin temperatures (Tsk) (r=0.972, P<0.001). Increases in Tsk for detecting warmth sensation were smaller for the lower back with a rise of 0.2 \& PLUSMN; 0.4 degrees C and the abdomen (0.3 \& PLUSMN; 0.3 degrees C) than for the buttock (0.9 \& PLUSMN; 0.8 degrees C) and sole (0.8 \& PLUSMN; 0.6 degrees C) (P<0.05). Increases in Tsk for detecting hotness sensation ranged from 0.5 to 1.5 <degrees>C. Warmth and hotness thresholds on the abdomen or sole had significant relationships with body mass index, indicating that the overweight are less sensitive to detecting radiant heat on the abdomen or sole.

Given its contribution in central pathways involved in thermoregulation, orexin A could play a role in the regulation of core body temperature during and after exercise. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the effect of exercise, performed at two times of day, on core temperature and on the amount of orexin A in the production zone, i.e., the dorsal hypothalamus. Forty-nine male Wistar rats underwent forced treadmill exercise during the HG phase and HL phase of core temperature. Basal core temperature was recorded continuously for 48 h by implanted telemetric sensors in 11 rats. Regulation of core temperature during exercise (20 min) and after each exercise (60 min) was modeled with a modified logistic-type function. During HG exercise, core temperature curve reached a significantly higher maximum (asymptote: +0.70 +/- 0.10 degrees C) and took longer to attain the strongest inclination of the core temperature regulation curve (Xmid: 3.46 +/- 0.72 min). After HG exercise, time of recovery was significantly longer than after HL exercise. In male rats, thermoregulatory response to acute physical exercise was influenced by the time of day. There was no effect of either physical activity or time of day on the level of orexin A in the dorsal hypothalamus. Our results suggest that orexin A in the dorsal hypothalamus is not involved in the effects of physical exercise on thermoregulation.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103522,114,NA,NA,103522,Thermoregulation; Core body temperature; Hypocretin-1; Physical activity; Dorsal hypothalamus

Organisms regulate their body temperature within a range of temperatures to enhance physiological function. The capacity of ectotherms, such as lizards, to maintain their body temperature within their preferred range influences physiological traits such as speed, various reproductive patterns, and critical fitness components, such as growth rates or survival. Here, we evaluate the influence of temperature on locomotor performance, sperm morphology and viability in a high elevation lizard species (Sceloporus aeneus). Whereas maximal values for sprint speed coincides with field active and preferred body temperature, short-term exposure at the same range of temperatures produces abnormalities in sperm morphology, lower sperm concentration and diminishes sperm motility and viability. In conclusion, we confirmed that although locomotor performance is maximized at preferred temperatures, there is a trade-off with male reproductive attributes, which may cause infertility. As a consequence, prolonged exposure to preferred temperatures could threaten the persistence of the species through reduced fertility. Persistence of the species is favored in environments with access to cooler, thermal micro -habitats that enhance reproductive parameters.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103526,113,NA,NA,103526,Acclimation; Ectotherms; Locomotor performance; Sperm parameters

In this study, the responses to heat exposure of heat-tolerant Vechur and Kasaragod cattle found in Kerala state in India (also known as dwarf Bos taurus indicus) were compared to crossbred cattle (crosses of Bos t. taurus with Bos t. indicus). At various time points during heat exposure, rectal temperature and the expression of HSPA1A were determined, and the relationship between them was characterized. We characterized HSPA1A mRNA in Vechur cattle and performed molecular clock analysis. The expression of HSPA1A between the lineages and at different temperature humidity index (THI) was significant. There were significant differences between the expression profiles of HSPA1A in Kasaragod and crossbred (p < 0.01) and Vechur and crossbred (p < 0.01) cattle, but no significant difference in expression was observed between Vechur and Kasaragod cattle.

The two-spotted stink bug, Bathycoelia distincta Distant, is a significant pest of macadamia. The main goal of this study was to investigate the thermal tolerance of B. distincta across different life stages. Thermal tolerance indices investigated included critical thermal maximum (CTmax), critical thermal minimum (CTmin), effects of acclimation on CTmax and CTmin at 20, 25, and 30 degrees C, and rapid heat hardening (RHH), and rapid cold hardening (RCH). The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to explore the effects of life stage and acclimation on CTmax and CTmin and Generalized Linear Models (GLM) for the probability of survival after pre-exposure to RHH at 41 degrees C for 2 h and RCH at -8 degrees C for 2 h. CTmax and CTmin varied significantly between life stages at all acclimation temperatures, but CTmin (3.5 degrees C) varied more than CTmax (2.1 degrees C). Higher acclimation temperatures resulted in larger variations between life stages for both CTmax and CTmin. A significant acclimation response was observed for the CTmax of instar 2 (1.7 degrees C) and CTmin of females (2.7 degrees C) across acclimation temperatures (20-30 degrees C). Pre-exposure significantly improved the heat and cold survival probability of instar 2 and the cold survival probability of instar 3 and males. The response between life stages was more variable in RCH than in RHH. Instar 2 appeared to be the most thermally plastic life stage of B. distincta. These results suggest that the thermal plastic traits of B. distincta life stages may enable this pest to survive in temperature regimes under the ongoing climate change, with early life stages (except for instar 2) more temperature sensitive than later life stages.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103395,111,NA,NA,103395,CT min; Acclimation; RHH; RCH; CTmax

The study was aimed at investigating the impact of road transportation on puppies and the beneficial effects of melatonin supplementation. Fourteen (14) apparently healthy Nigerian indigenous breed of dogs (puppies) divided into two groups, group I (control) and group II (pretreated with Melatonin at 10 mg/kg) were transported by road during the hotdry season. Vital parameters; respiratory rate (RR), pulse rate (PR) and rectal temperature (RT) were taken before, during and immediately after commencement of the journey. Blood sample was also collected from each puppy before and immediately after the journey, part of which was used to analyzed for some hematological parameters and oxidative biomarkers such as the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). The result revealed that road transportation caused moderate to severe stress on the puppies as observed with the discomfort index (DI) (27.75-34.64 oC). The dry-bulb temperature during the study period was 33.23 +/- 0.13 oC, while the relative humidity was 73.85 +/- 0.60\%. The RT, PR and RR also increased significantly (p < 0.05) during and immediately after the transportation compared to before commencement of the transportation. The result further revealed that total leucocyte counts and Neutrophil:Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were elevated immediately after the transportation. The MDA concentration was also significantly (P < 0.05) elevated immediately after the transportation compared to before commencement in the control group. The activities of SOD and CAT and the concentration of GSH was lowered immediately after the transportation compared to before commencement. Supplementation with melatonin before the transportation ameliorated the stress posed by road transportation on the puppies as can be observed in the lowering of the elevated RT, PR and RR, total leucocyte count, NLR and MDA concentration. Pretreated with melatonin also increased the depleted activities of SOD and CAT, and the concentration of GSH immediately after the transportation. The results showed that road transportation is stressful for puppies and supplementation with melatonin mitigated the stress posed on the puppies, probably through the ability of melatonin to scavenge reactive oxygen species generated during the transportation. The results further showed that melatonin may be used to enhance the welfare of puppies subjected to road transportation under adverse thermal conditions.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103376,110,NA,NA,103376,Road transportation; Puppies; Oxidative stress; Melatonin; Discomfort index; Physiological parameters

The UKNIIS data are obtained by questionnaire from immersion incidents around the British Isles. The survey has been in operation since 1991 and at the time of writing contained almost 1600 cases. The aim of the present work was to analyse these cases with the aim of establishing a model for the prediction of survival time in water. This analysis is described in this paper: two model approaches are presented and their strengths and weaknesses are discussed. Recommendations for the use and development of such models are made.,2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103349,110,NA,NA,103349,Cold water survival time; Immersion; Search \&amp; rescue
article,Separate extraction of human eccrine sweat gland activity and peripheral hemodynamics from high- and low-quality thermal imaging data,"Sagaidachnyi, Andrey and Mayskov, Dmitriy and Fomin, Andrey and Zaletov, Ivan and Skripal, Anatoly",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Sweat gland activity and peripheral hemodynamics, which characterize the function of sympathetic cholinergic nerve fibers and the manifestation mechanisms of vascular tone regulation, respectively, can be detected via dy-namic thermography of the skin. Thus, they are useful parameters for diagnosing various forms of neuropathy and functional circulatory disorders. Both parameters affect the dynamics of the skin temperature; therefore, for an adequate description of thermographic data, it is necessary to build models that consider both these coexisting components simultaneously.Purpose: The objective of this study was to determine the spatiotemporal and statistical features of dynamic thermograms of skin areas with sweat glands and to develop methods for the extraction of temperature com-ponents mediated by sweat gland activity (Tsweat) separately from hemodynamics (Tblood) based on thermograms of high and low temperature resolutions.Methods: To separate the Tsweat and Tblood components, simultaneous thermographic and photoplethysmographic (PPG) measurements were performed in the area of the fingers during a deep inspiratory gasp (DIG). PPG data, which were obtained solely by hemodynamics, were converted into a temperature signal (Tblood) using the spectral filtering approach. By calculating the difference between the skin (Tskin) and blood (Tblood) temperature components, the Tsweat component was determined, which characterizes sweat gland activity and the integrity of the cholinergic sympathetic nerve fibers that innervate them. The Tsweat component was compared with the active sweat pore count curve, which was determined by the adaptive detection of local temperature minima. Thermographic and PPG measurements were performed for 3 min on a group of 15 volunteers during the DIG test. The skin temperature was measured using a cooled thermal imaging camera in the spectral range of 8-9 um with a temperature sensitivity of 0.02 degrees C. PPG measurements were performed using a reflectance sensor with a central wavelength of 800 nm. Wavelet analysis with the Morlet basis function was used to preliminarily determine the spectrum of spontaneous temperature oscillations in an area of the skin with and without sweat pores. Statistical parameters of the histogram, such as the standard de-viation and the statistical pore activation index (SPAI) -which is proposed in this paper were used in the DIG test to detect sweat gland activity with low-temperature resolution thermograms. The temporal dynamics of the statistical parameters were compared with the dynamics of the sweat pore count.Results: The Tsweat component was correlated with the sweat pore count on the thermogram with a coefficient of 0.75, confirming the dependence of this temperature component on the sweat gland activity and the need for considering this activity in the analysis of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the human skin temperature. The use of the proposed SPAI and standard deviation allows the detection of sweat gland activity even with thermograms of a low temperature resolution. The use of an integrated map of the sweat gland activity will help the specialist to assess the degree of integrity of the innervation of skin areas in a single image. The primary assessment of the spectrum of temperature oscillations at rest indicated that spontaneous sweat gland activity is accompanied by high-frequency oscillations in the skin temperature localized in the area of sweat pores, within the frequency range of 0.07-0.3 Hz. This suggests the possibility of spectral separation of the temperature component mediated by sweat gland activity from the hemodynamic component, which dominates in the region of <0.1 Hz. The proposed two-component approach for the analysis of skin temperature dynamics allows separate assessment of sympathetic innervation and rhythms of hemodynamic regulation using dynamic thermograms.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103351,110,NA,NA,103351,Infrared thermography; Skin temperature; Sweat glands; Sudomotor; Wavelet analysis; Deep inspiratory gasp
article,Thermal comfort analyses on jogging trails: The effect of trail direction and tree shading on trial surface and physiological equivalent temperatures,"Alawadhi, Esam M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Jogging trails have been constructed in residential areas in Kuwait City to encourage people to exercise in outdoor spaces. The weather is hot and arid for most of the year. To create a comfortable and healthy local microclimate condition, trails were constructed along a certain direction with respect to the direction of the main prevailing wind and shaded with trees. In this study, the combined effects of tree shading and trail direction on trail surface temperature and physiological equivalent temperature (PET) were investigated. The prime focus is on a PET thermal comfort range between 21.6 degrees C and 30.1 degrees C and the period between 5:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. The results indicate that the shade of trees effectively protects the trail surface if the shaded trail is along the N-S direction, but it is ineffective if the shaded trail is along the E-W direction. PET analyses indicate that tree shading is irrelevant to thermal comfort only in spring, during which the thermal comfort of all trials was neutral between 5:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. E-W is the most comfortable trail in winter and summer. The trees along the E-W direction trail slow down wind speed and increase the relative humidity, which is desirable in arid envi-ronments. The E-W trail is the most comfortable because the trees protect people from hot winds in the summer and cold winds in winter. The results of the present investigation provide information of interest for urban designers, who can attain comfortable and healthy local microclimate conditions by choosing the correct trail direction and considering tree shading.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103358,110,NA,NA,103358,Jogging trails; Outdoor thermal comfort; Tree shading; Surface temperature; Physiological equivalent temperature
article,Thermal tolerance of two Diptera that pollinate thermogenic plants,"Leclerc, Mathieu A. J. and Guivarc'h, Luca and Lazzari, Claudio R. and Pincebourde, Sylvain",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Pollinating insects can be exposed to temperatures far from ambient air when visiting flowers, reducing their warming tolerance. Typically, such scenario occurs when flowers are exposed to solar radiation. The case of thermogenic flowers is particular because they warm up even when they are not exposed to solar energy. The flowers of Arum attract their pollinators with a deceptive method and trap them for a whole day, thereby imposing elevated temperature to visiting insects. Therefore, we predict a relatively high basal thermal tolerance in those insects. The aim of this study was to assess the thermal tolerance and warming tolerance of females of two fly species (genus Psychoda) pollinating Arum sp. (thermogenic plant). We measured their critical temper-ature (CTmax) and its response to rate of temperature increase as well as acclimation period to moderate temperature of 25 degrees C. We found relatively low CTmax (33.7 degrees C on average) for both species, and a weak response to acclimation period and ramping rate. In general, the thermal tolerance increased with a rapid ramping in temperature. To evaluate the warming tolerance, we compared thermal tolerance limits to flower temperatures measured in the field. We highlighted that the temperature of the thermogenic floral organ could reach values close to the thermal tolerance threshold of pollinators. This discovery raises questions about the sustainability of the interaction between these thermogenic plants and their pollinators.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103339,109,NA,NA,103339,Critical thermal maximum; Plasticity; Heat tolerance; Thermal limit; Wild pollinator

This study investigates the effects of water temperature and food availability on growth, sex ratio and gonadal development of the convict cichlid (Amatitlania nigrofasciata) which is an ornamental fish that may be a useful lab model. For this experiment, 180 juvenile convict cichlid (0.3 +/- 0.02 g) were held at three different temperatures (26, 29 and 32 degrees C as T1, T2 and T3) and fed to satiation (S) or a restricted diet (R: half satiation) during a 56-day experimental period. Specific growth rate was significantly higher in T2S treatment than the other groups. The highest and lowest mean oocyte sizes were recorded in T1S and T3R groups, respectively. The sex ratio of fish held at 29 degrees C was male biased (female, 21.0\%; male, 78.9\%), but this was not seen at 26 degrees C (female, 47.6\%; male, 52.4\%) or 32 degrees C (female, 57.1\%; male, 42.9\%). In T1S and T1R treatments, oocytes developed more than the other treatments and in T2S group testicular development was more advanced than other groups. These results demonstrate the complex interplay of temperature and food availability on growth and reproductive development in the convict cichlid.

Forecasts indicate a worldwide temperature rise of 1.4-6 degrees C by 2100, and an increase in heatwave frequency is expected. This study investigated the effects of constant temperatures (CT; 27, 34, 39, 40 and 41 degrees C) and fluctuating temperature (FT; 27/34 degrees C: 12/12 h) on the survival, metabolic rate, locomotor activity, gas exchange pattern, heat loss and water content of the male Jamaican field cricket, Gryllus assimilis (Fabricius, 1775) (Orthoptera: Gryllidae). It was found that 39 degrees C was the estimated lethal temperature for 50\% of the population and that 41 degrees C was considered the thermal limit, causing 100\% mortality in 96 h. Furthermore, FT caused slightly higher mortality (8.9 +/- 3.8\%) than CT27 (0\%) and CT34 (1.43 +/- 1.43\%). FT caused a greater increase in the metabolic rate and locomotor activity than CT27. It was found that G. assimilis males had a continuous gas exchange as a standard at CT27; however, CT34 changed the gas exchange pattern from continuous to cyclic in 27\% of crickets. FT decreased heat loss in crickets more than CT34; however, no significant differences were found in locomotor activity and metabolic rate. In addition, no significant differences between CT27, CT34 and FT were observed in terms of water content, thus suggesting no difference in water loss. Thus, it is suggested that FT, despite involving a modest warming, increased the climate sensitivity of G. assimilis males and led to a change in their optimum temperature, pushing it beyond its usual thermal limits. However, higher mortality in FT compared to CT27 (control) and CT34 must be interpreted with caution. In addition, the risk of higher mortality of G. assimilis males is predicted, especially in South America, where this cricket is widely distributed.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103145,105,NA,NA,103145,Climate change; Locomotor activity; VCO2; Evaporative cool; Heat wave
article,Exercise in the heat induces similar elevations in serum irisin in young and older men despite lower resting irisin concentrations in older adults,"McCormick, James J. and King, Kelli E. and Notley, Sean R. and Fujii, Naoto and Boulay, Pierre and Sigal, Ronald J. and Kenny, Glen P.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Irisin is thought to play a cytoprotective role during acute stressors, such as exercise, by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Relative to young adults, older individuals exhibit an impaired capacity to dissipate heat during exercise, which can exacerbate elevations in oxidative stress and the acute inflammatory response especially in the heat. In turn, this could induce a greater increase in circulating irisin. Thus, we evaluated agerelated differences in irisin expression during prolonged exercise in a non-heat stress and high-heat stress environment. Specifically, we assessed serum irisin in 12 young (22 +/- 3 years) and 12 older (59 +/- 4 years) men before and after 3-h moderate-intensity exercise (metabolic rate: 200 W/m2) and 60-min post-exercise recovery in temperate (wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) 16 degrees C) and hot (WBGT 32 degrees C) environments. Core temperature (Tco) was measured continuously. Post-exercise Tco was similarly higher in the hot compared to the temperate condition for both groups (p < 0.001), although Tco remained elevated at end-recovery in the heat in older but not young adults (p = 0.006). Absolute serum irisin concentrations were significantly higher (p < 0.002) under all conditions in the young relative to older adults. Post-exercise and end-recovery irisin was elevated above baseline in both groups in the hot (+39.3 pg/mL SEM 8 and + 48.9 pg/mL SEM 10, respectively; both p < 0.043) but not the temperate condition. When comparing between conditions, the change in irisin concentrations at post-exercise did not differ, although serum irisin was elevated in the hot (+48.9 pg/mL SEM 10) relative to the temperate (+0.88 pg/mL SEM 0.2) condition in both groups at end-recovery (p = 0.004). Our findings indicate that irisin concentrations were elevated after exercise compared to rest in hot, but not temperate conditions across groups. However, older adults may still have greater cellular vulnerability to heat stress given their blunted circulating irisin levels.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103189,104,NA,NA,103189,Heat stress; Temperature; Physical activity; Aging; Irisin; Myokine

Eccentric muscle actions, such as those performed during plyometric jumps, induce muscle damage and consequently a rise in skin temperature (Tsk). Thus, the purpose of this study is to assess the response of infrared thermography measurement as an indirect marker of muscle damage after a protocol of plyometric jumps in physically active subjects. Therefore, for the aim of this study ten male subjects with no previous experience in plyometric training participated in the research (age 22.5 +/- 3.3 years, weight 71.7 +/- 11.0 kg, height 171.1 +/- 5.3 cm, and fat mass 15.5 +/- 4.7\%). To assess the muscle damage, countermovement jump (CMJ), creatine kinase (CK), delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and infrared thermography (IRT) were measured at 24, 48, and 72 h after plyometric exercise. The acute exercise protocol of plyometric jumps induced muscle damage, as shown by the CK and DOMS (24 and 48 h, p < 0.05) but no statistical difference was shown between the moments analyzed in Tsk (warm zone). Nevertheless, when comparing baseline to 48h, a moderate effect was found in the Tsk (warm zone) for anterior right thigh (ES = 1.1) and posterior left thigh (ES = 0.9) and large effect was found for anterior left thigh (ES = 1.4) and posterior right thigh (ES = 1.3). A moderate effect in the Tsk (warm zone) was found for posterior right and left thigh (ES = 0.9 and ES = 1.1, respectively) when comparing baseline to 72h of IRT. These results suggest that a plyometric jumping session alters CK and DOMS, as well as the thigh's skin temperature in an evident way, bringing up a possible relation with markers of muscle damage.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103187,104,NA,NA,103187,Muscle damage; Plyometric jumps; Infrared thermography

The population growth of this species is affected by temperature. However, there are no data on comparative demographic parameters (i.e., net reproductive rate, intrinsic rate of increase, finite rate of increase, mean generation time and doubling time) in different temperatures, parameters that allow the in-depth exploration of its survival, mortality and reproduction patterns. This study evaluated egg-to-adult development, adult mortality and female fecundity on white soft wheat flour at 20, 25, 30 and 32.5 degrees C. The net reproductive rate increased from 0.08 females/female at 20 degrees C to 11.77 females/female at 25 degrees C and 102.07 females/female at 30 degrees C, followed by a decrease to 10.73 females/female at 32.5 degrees C. The lowest values of the intrinsic rate of increase and the finite rate of increase were observed at 20 degrees C (- 0.0105 females/female/day and 0.9895, respectively) and the highest at 30 degrees C (0.0348 females/female/day and 1.0354, respectively). While the mean generation time did not differ significantly between 20 and 25 degrees C (249.9 and 225.5 days, respectively), this decreased to 132.8 and 115.1 days at 30 and 32.5 degrees C, respectively. The value of the doubling time was negative at 20 degrees C (- 67.5 days), increased to 19.9, 34.0 and 63.9 days at 30, 32.5 and 25 degrees C, respectively. Using the non-linear Briere model, the lower threshold for T. castaneum population increase was estimated to be 22.2 degrees C, the upper threshold at 33.2 degrees C, and the temperature for maximum growth rate was 30.1 degrees C. Survival analysis indicated that temperature also affected the mortality risk of T. castaneum. The mean survival time increased from 112.1 days at 20 degrees C to 462.4 days at 25 degrees C, followed by a decrease to 206.5 and 64.5 days at 30 and 32.5 degrees C, respectively.

To determine the significant role of antioxidant defense and non-specific immune defense in freezing survival of this species, we assayed parameters of oxidative damage, antioxidant defense and non-specific immune enzymes during freezing exposure (-2 degrees C for 12 h) in five organs (heart, brain, liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle). The results showed that freezing led to a significant rise in the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and carbonyl groups (CG) in brain, liver and kidney tissues. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) increased significantly in brain and liver tissues with an augmentation of total antioxidant capacity (TAOC). Apparent increments in muscle SOD activity and liver GST activity were also observed during freezing exposure. Vitamin C content significantly decreased in liver and kidney but a significant increase occurred in brain. Activities of non-specific immune enzymes, acid phosphatase (ACP) and alkaline phosphatase (AKP), were also assessed. ACP activity was significantly reduced in all five tissues tested whereas AKP activity decreased significantly in four tissues but rose in brain. In summary, freezing is accompanied by oxidative stress in the highaltitude frog, N. parkeri, as documented by increases in the content of MDA and CG in tissues. Freezing exposure also induced tissue-specific changes in the antioxidant defenses showing that activation of antioxidant systems is a part of the survival strategy of this in a high-altitude frog during freezing. Such up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes suggests a particularly important role for them in the liver and brain, serving as an anticipatory mechanism to deal with the ROS challenge during freeze/thaw episodes. Our findings contribute to extending the current understanding of the mechanisms of freeze tolerance in high-altitude frogs.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103132,102,NA,NA,103132,Nanorana parkeri; Freeze exposure; Oxidative stress; Antioxidant defense

Heat stress may occur as repeated small-scale events or as a single prolonged event, which may cause different outcomes to the organism. Here, we subjected Helicoverpa punctigera (Wallengren) pupae to two temperatures (44.2 degrees C and 43 degrees C) and two exposure treatments - a single 3-h prolonged exposure prolonged and three repeated 1-h exposure period with 24 h recovery time between bouts - to assess the biological traits of individuals. The maximum temperatures were used as they were just below the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) 47.3 degrees C +/- 0.3 degrees C of pupae for which they could survive exposure. Adults in the prolonged and repeated heat-stressed treatments had 1.70 and 3.34 more days to emergence and 1.57 and 3.30 days extended life span compared to those kept under a constant 25 degrees C temperature (control treatment). Both pre-oviposition and oviposition periods were extended in the heat-stressed groups. Fecundity in the prolonged and repeated heat-stressed females was reduced by 34.7\% and 65.5\% eggs in the 43 degrees C treatment group and by 94.3\% and 93.6\% eggs in the 44.2 degrees C treatment group compared to the control group. No eggs from females in either the prolonged and repeated heat-stress groups hatched. We establish that heat stress on pupae can influence the population dynamics of H. punctigera by reducing fecundity as well as extending the pre oviposition period, and affecting adult development. Also, as heat exposure on the parent generation resulted in no offspring production, it is critical to assess cross-generational responses to extreme heat stress.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103099,101,NA,NA,103099,Helicoverpa punctigera; Heat stress; Exposure type; Longevity; Fecundity; Mating frequency
article,Calculation method of mean skin temperature weighted by temperature sensitivity of various parts of human body,"Liu, Guodan and Liang, Shuwei and Hu, Songtao",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Skin temperature is an important physiological parameter, and its calculation methods are varied, and the results are different. At present, the area weighting method is mostly used to calculate the mean skin temperature. However, the skin of various parts of the human body has different degrees of sensitivity to temperature changes. Based on this, this article proposes two calculation methods using the weighting of the cold and heat sensitivity coefficients. This article conducted experiments with different ambient temperatures (18 degrees C/20 degrees C/22 degrees C), clothing thermal resistances (1.10 clo/1.31 clo/1.44 clo), and activity levels (sitting/standing/walking) to obtain the subjects' local skin temperature. And then compared and analyzed the calculation results of the abovementioned two sensitivity coefficient methods and the traditional area weighting method. The results found that there is no significant difference between the two sensitivity coefficient methods proposed in this article (the absolute difference is up to 0.09 degrees C, and the relative difference is less than 0.4\%), but there is a certain difference with the traditional area weighting method. The ANOVA shows that the deviation is mainly affected by the ambient temperature (P 0.01), and the thermal resistance of clothing and activity level have no significant effects (P 0.05). By studying the relationship between mean skin temperature and thermal sensation voting, it is found that when the human skin temperature changes due to environmental temperature changes, the mean skin temperature and thermal sensation calculated by new method have a higher linearity (correlation coefficient R2 > 0.92), and the slope is larger, which can better reflect the influence of thermal environment changes on the human body's thermal sensation.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102995,100,NA,NA,102995,Mean skin temperature; Sensitivity coefficient weighting method; Five-point method

Its upper critical thermal limit is not well defined, especially when combined with extreme salinities. The cumulative mortalities of the progenies of wild C. virginica from four nGoM estuaries differing in mean annual salinity, acclimated to low (4.0), moderate (20.0), and high (36.0) salinities at 28.9 degrees C (84 degrees F) and exposed to increasing target temperatures of 33.3 degrees C (92 degrees F), 35.6 degrees C (96 degrees F) or 37.8 degrees C (100 degrees F), were measured over a three-week period. Oysters of all stocks were the most sensitive to increasing temperatures at low salinity, dying quicker (i.e., lower median lethal time, LT50) than at the moderate and high salinities and resulting in high cumulative mortalities at all target temperatures. Oysters of all stocks at moderate salinity died the slowest with high cumulative mortalities only at the two highest temperatures. The F1 oysters from the more southern and hyper saline Upper Laguna Madre estuary were generally more tolerant to prolonged higher temperatures (higher LT50) than stocks originating from lower salinity estuaries, most notably at the highest salinity. Using the measured temperatures oysters were exposed to, 3-day median lethal Celsius degrees (LD50) were estimated for each stock at each salinity. The lowest 3-day LD50 (35.1-36.0 degrees C) for all stocks was calculated at a salinity of 4.0, while the highest 3-day LD50 (40.1-44.0 degrees C) was calculated at a salinity of 20.0.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103072,100,NA,NA,103072,Crassostrea virginica; Climate change; Upper critical thermal limit; Median lethal time (LT50); Median lethal celsius degree (LD50)

The technical assessment of organismal thermal niches in form of now so-called thermal performance curves (TPC) thus has a long tradition in biological research. Nevertheless, several traits do not display the idealized, intuitive dome-shaped TPC, and in practice assessments often do not cover the entire realistic or natural temperature range of an organism. We here illustrate this by presenting comprehensive sex-specific TPCs for the major (ju-venile) life history traits of yellow dung flies (Scathophaga stercoraria; Diptera: Scathophagidae). This concerns estimation of prominent biogeographic rules, such as the temperature-size-rule (TSR), the common phenomenon in ectothermic organisms that body size decreases as temperature increases. S. stercoraria shows an untypical asymptotic TPC of continuous body size increase with decreasing temperature without a peak (optimum), thus following the TSR throughout their entire thermal range (unlike several other insects presented here). Egg-to -adult mortality (our best fitness estimator) also shows no intermediate maximum. Both may relate to this fly entering pupal winter diapause below 12 degrees C. While development time presents a negative exponential rela-tionship with temperature, development rate and growth rate typify the classic TPC form for this fly. The hitherto largely unexplored close relative S. suilla with an even more arctic distribution showed very similar responses, demonstrating large overlap among two ecologically similar, coexisting dung fly species, thus implying limited utility of even complete TPCs for predicting species distribution and coexistence.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103069,100,NA,NA,103069,Body size; Coexistence; Development; Growth; Survival; Temperature-size-rule; Thermal niche

Ophidiomyces ophidiicola causes SFD and manifests clinically by the formation of heterophilic granulomas around the mouth and eyes, weight loss, impaired vision, and sometimes death. Field observations have documented early seasonal basking behaviors in severely infected snakes, potentially suggesting induction of a behavioral febrile response to combat the mycosis. This study tested the hypothesis that snakes inoculated with Ophidiomyces ophidiicola would seek elevated basking temperatures to control body temperature and behaviorally induce a febrile response. Eastern ribbon snakes (Thamnophis saurita, n = 29) were experimentally or sham inoculated with O. ophidiicola. Seven days after inoculation, snakes were tested on a thermal gradient and the internal body temperature and substrate temperature of each snake was recorded over time. Quantitative PCR was used when snakes arrived, during pre-inoculation, and post-inoculation to test snakes for the presence of O. ophidiicola. Some snakes arrived with O. ophidiicola and were subsequently inoculated, allowing for an assessment of secondary exposure effects. Snake thermoregulatory behavior was compared between 1) O. ophidiicola inoculated vs. sham inoculated treatments, 2) infected vs. disease negative groups, and 3) disease naive vs. pre-exposed immune response categories.

article,Muscle temperature is least altered during total sleep deprivation in rats,"Sharma, Binney and Sengupta, Trina and Vishwakarma, Lal Chandra and Akhtar, Nasreen and Mallick, Hruda Nanda",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"It has often been said that the brain is mostly benefitted from sleep. To understand the importance of sleep, extensive studies on other organs are too required. One such unexplored area is the understanding of muscle physiology during the sleep-wake cycle. Changes in muscle tone with different sleep phases are evident from the rapid eye movement sleep muscle atonia. There is variation in brain and body temperature during sleep stages, the brain temperature being higher during rapid eye movement sleep than slow-wave sleep. However, the change in muscle temperature with different sleep stages is not known. In this study, we have implanted pre-calibrated K-type thermocouples in the hypothalamus and the dorsal nuchal muscle, and a peritoneal transmitter to monitor the hypothalamic, muscle, and body temperature respectively in rats during 24 h sleep-wake cycle. The changes in muscle, body, and hypothalamic temperature during total sleep deprivation were also monitored. During normal sleep-wake stages, the temperature in the decreasing order was that of the hypothalamus, body, and muscle. Total sleep deprivation by gentle handling caused a significant increase in hypothalamic and body temperature, while there was least change in the muscle temperature. The circadian rhythm of the hypothalamic and body temperature in the sleep-deprived rats was disrupted, while the same was preserved in the muscle temperature. The results of our study show that muscle atonia during rapid eye movement sleep is a physiologically regulated thermally quiescent muscle state offering a conducive environment for muscle rest and repair.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102910,98,NA,NA,102910,Sleep wake cycle; Total sleep deprivation; Dorsal nuchal muscle; Circadian variation

Four isonitrogenous (275 g kg-1 crude protein), isocaloric (18.5 MJ kg-1) diets containing a mixture of fish oil and corn oil (1:1 ratio) at different levels (70, 85, 110 and 130 g kg- 1) were prepared and fed to Nile tilapia reared at a fixed water temperature 25 ? 1 ?C for two months. After the feeding trial, the fish were exposed to a cold challenge. The best growth rates and feed utilization were achieved at 70 and 85 g kg- 1 dietary lipid, whereas the lowest results were recorded at higher lipid levels (110 and 130 g kg- 1). The ability of Nile tilapia to survive the acute cold stress was significantly improved as the lipid level increased from 70 to 110 g kg- 1 and decreased with further increase in lipid levels. During the cold stress, saturated fatty acids (SFA) significantly decreased, while unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) tended to increase.

article,Repeated thermal conditioning during the neonatal period affects behavioral and physiological responses to acute heat stress in chicks,"Ouchi, Yoshimitsu and Tanizawa, Hiroshi and Shiraishi, Jun-ichi and Cockrem, John F. and Chowdhury, Vishwajit S. and Bungo, Takashi",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of repeated thermal conditioning (RTC) at an early age on physiological and behavioral responses in chicks. Methods: Birds were assigned to one of the four treatments in which the RTC was exposure to 40 degrees C for 15 min daily. The treatments were 1) no thermal conditioning (control); 2) early exposure group (EE; RTC from 2 to 4 days of age); 3) later exposure group (LE; RTC from 5 to 7 days of age); or 4) both early and later exposure (BE; RTC from 2 to 7 days of age). All groups of chicks were challenged with high ambient temperature (40 degrees C for 15 min) at two weeks of age. Results: During heat challenge, initiation times of dissipation behaviors (panting and wing-drooping) were measured. Rectal temperature and respiration rate were measured after and before heat challenge. Hypothalamic samples and blood were collected at the end of heat challenges. Initiation times of dissipation behaviors and rectal temperature were not affected by the treatments. Increases in respiration rate in response to heat challenge were suppressed by early RTC treatment. There was no clear pattern of glucose levels in relation to thermal conditioning, whereas plasma corticosterone levels were decreased by early treatment (EE and BE groups). Hypothalamic thyrotropin releasing hormone gene expression was suppressed by early and later thermal conditioning and suppressed further by both early and later exposure. Neuropeptide Y gene expression in the BE group was lower than in the other groups, with a similar trend for corticotropin releasing hormone expression. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the effect of repeated thermal conditioning on the central thermoregulatory system depends on the number of times that chicks experienced conditioning. In addition, repeated thermal conditioning has greater effects on the acquisition of thermotolerance when conditioning occurs in chicks of two to four days of age in comparison with chicks of five to seven days of age.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102759,94,NA,NA,102759,Thermal conditioning; Thermotolerance; Heat stress; Early exposure; Chicks

Relatively lowa-bundance proteins with particular functions in biological processes are changed by CHS. The present study aimed to quantify the differences in low-abundance proteins of crossbred dairy buffaloes under CHS and thermalneutral (TN) conditions. With label-free quantification, 344 low-abundance proteins were identified in serum. Of these, 17 differentially expressed low-abundance proteins with known functions were detected, and six of the differentially expressed proteins related to heat stress were validated with parallel reaction monitoring. Lipase (LPL), glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3), cathelicidin-2 (CATHL2), ceruloplasmin (CP), and hemoglobin subunit alpha 1 (HBA1) cooperatively played roles in the thermal fitness of dairy buffalo by decreasing heat production and increasing blood oxygen delivery.

article,Evaporative water loss in seven species of fossorial rodents: Does effect of degree of fossoriality and sociality exist?,"Luna, Facundo and Sumbera, Radim and Okrouhlik, Jan and Mladenkova, Nella and Daniel Antenucci, C.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In terrestrial endotherms, evaporation is a significant mechanism of water loss in hot environments. Although water is passively lost by evaporation, individuals can regulate it at different levels. Inhabiting a relatively stable environment characterized by mild ambient temperature (T-a) and high humidity can ensure a balanced water budget. Many fossorial rodents are well adapted to live in such conditions. In this study, evaporative water loss (EWL) of fossorial rodent species with different degree of adaptations to underground life (from strictly subterranean to those with regular surface activity) was evaluated. By measuring EWL, the specific contribution of either evaporative or non-evaporative components of heat loss can be determined. With the exception of the silvery mole-rat (Heliophobius argenteocinereus), in all tested rodents EWL is relatively stable below and within the thermoneutral zone (TNZ). As T(a)s increase above TNZ, EWL increases as does total thermal conductance, but conductance increases several times more than EWL. In addition, non-evaporative routes seem to be more important than evaporative heat loss in the analyzed species. No clear pattern of EWL in relation to a species degree of fossoriality or sociality was detected. In this context, atmosphere of burrows could affect EWL, since the high humidity found inside tunnels can establish limits on evaporation to favor water rather than thermal balance.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102564,89,NA,NA,102564,Evaporative water loss; Thermoregulation; Thermal conductance; Fossorial rodents; Subterranean rodents

article,HSP70 plays a role in the defense of acute and chronic heat stress in Mongolian gerbils (<i>Meriones unguiculatus</i>),"Lou, Shu-Lei and Zhang, Xue-Ying and Wang, De-Hua",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) show a wide thermal neutral zone (TNZ, 26.5-38.9 degrees C). Whether heat shock proteins (HSPs) are involved in thermal tolerance for gerbils has still been unknown. We investigated the effects of acute and chronic high temperature within and above TNZ on the expressions of HSP70 and HSP90 and oxidative status in Mongolian gerbils, to test the hypothesis that the gerbils need increase the expression in HSPs to defense the acute and chronic heat stress. In experiment I, 50 Mongolian gerbils were exposed to 23 degrees C, 27 degrees C, 37 degrees C, 40 degrees C and 43.5 degrees C for 80 min respectively, and then sacrificed 12 h after treatment. HSP70 expression in the liver increased at 40 degrees C compared to that at 23 degrees C, but did not change after 27 degrees C, 37 degrees C or 43.5 degrees C exposure. There were no differences in HSP90 expression, oxidative stress parameters such as malonaldehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), or antioxidant parameters such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in the liver. HSP70 and HSP90 expression both in the heart and brain showed no differences among groups. In experiment H, another set of 30 gerbils were acclimated to 23 degrees C, 27 degrees C and 37 degrees C for 21 days, respectively. During chronic acclimation, HSP70 expression increased and H2O2 level decreased in the liver in 37 degrees C group compared to other two groups. Both H2O2 and SOD in the brain decreased in 37 degrees C group, but there were no differences in HSP70, MDA or T-AOC in the brain. These data indicate that Mongolian gerbils can maintain basal levels of HSPs after acute exposure to temperatures within the wide TNZ, but rely on increased HSP70 in the liver to protect from heat damage at temperatures above TNZ and during chronic heat acclimation. The increased HSP70 expression in the liver may contribute to keeping from heat damage in desert rodents.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102452,86,NA,NA,102452,High temperature; Heat shock proteins (HSPs); Oxidative stress; Thermal neutral zone (TNZ); Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus)
article,Extract from <i>Coriolus versicolor</i> fungus partially prevents endotoxin tolerance development by maintaining febrile response and increasing IL-6 generation,"Jedrzejewski, Tomasz and Piotrowski, Jakub and Pawlikowska, Malgorzata and Wrotek, Sylwia and Kozak, Wieslaw",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Endotoxin tolerance is defined as a reduced endotoxin-induced fever following repeated injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Clinical examples of endotoxin tolerance include sepsis or cystic fibrosis. This state is characterized by inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines production and decrease in nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) activation. Extract from Coriolus versicolor (CV) fungus is classified as a biological response modifier, which exhibits various biological activities, including immunopotentiating properties. The aim of study was to examine the effect of CV extract injection on body core temperature of Wistar rats during LPS-induced endotoxin tolerance. Body temperature was measured using biotelemetry. CV extract was injected intraperitoneally (100 mg kg(-1)) 2 h prior to the first LPS peritoneal administration (50 mu g/kg). Endotoxin tolerance was induced by three consecutive daily injections of LPS at the same dose. We also investigated the influence of CV extract pre-injection on the properties of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from LPS-treated rats in response to LPS stimulation ex vivo. PBMCs were isolated 2 h after the first LPS injection. After 24 h pre-incubation, the cells were stimulated with LPS (1 mu g ml(-1)) for 4 h. Our results revealed that CV extract partially prevents endotoxin tolerance through maintaining febrile response in rats following consecutive exposure to LPS. This state was accompanied by the ability of PBMCs isolated from rats injected with CV extract and LPS to release larger amounts of interleukin 6 and greater NF-kappa B activation in response to LPS stimulation ex vivo compared with the cells derived from rats injected only with LPS. Data also showed that CV extract augmented mitogenic effect of LPS on PBMCs and caused increase in reactive oxygen species generation. We concluded that CV extract, by a modifying effect on body temperature during endotoxin tolerance, can be consider as the immunostimulating agent, which prevents the non-specific refractoriness described in patients with sepsis or ischemia.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.05.005,83,NA,69-79,NA,Coriolus versicolor; Endotoxin tolerance; Lipopolysaccharide; Fever; Peripheral blood mononuclear cells; Rat

In this study we aimed to assess the effect of heat and heat waves on mortality using attributable risks during 2005-2017. Nine heat waves were defined using a combination of severity and duration of mean daily temperature. Heat wave effects were assessed using added and main effects. Added effects were assessed as a binary variable and main effects were assessed by comparing the median temperature (in heat wave days) to Minimum Mortality Temperature (MMT). The effects of heat, mild heat and extreme heat on mortality were also assessed. Distributed Lag Non-linear Models were used to assess the relations in a bi-dimensional perspective in which the quadratic b-spline was chosen as the basis function for the dimension of the exposure and the natural cubic b-spline was chosen for lag dimension. The backward perspective was used to estimate the attributable risks. The total mortality attributed to non-optimal temperatures for all days was 1.91\% (CI 95\%: -6.36, 8.47). The attributable risks (AR) were 2.23\%, 2.02\% and 0.25\% for heat, mild heat and extreme heat days, respectively. AR was more for females and the above 65 years old groups than other groups in heat, mild heat and extreme heat days. While the stronger heat waves defined based on temperature above the 95 and 98th percentile had a significant attributable risk for total mortality in the added effects; the weaker heat waves (defined based on temperature above of the 90th percentile (HW1, HW2, HW3) had higher attributable risks, significant for HW1 and HW2, in the main effects. Apparently weaker heat waves show more immediate effects, while stronger heat waves increase mortality over several days.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.03.013,82,NA,76-82,NA,Heat; Heat wave; Mortality; Attributable risk
article,Cow individual activity response to the accumulation of heat load duration,"Heinicke, Julia and Ibscher, Stephanie and Belik, Vitaly and Amon, Thomas",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In the course of predicted climate change, the welfare of dairy cows and heat load to which they are exposed have become increasingly important even under moderate climate conditions. The objective of this study was to investigate the cow individual activity response to heat load in terms of the heat load duration and intensity in lactating, high-yielding Holstein-Friesian cows in a moderate climate zone. The study was conducted from June 2015 to April 2017 in a naturally ventilated barn in Brandenburg, Germany. The determined temperature-humidity index (THI) inside the barn was used to define the heat load. The heat load was characterized by the average daily THI as well as the duration and intensity of the defined THI levels. In addition to the heat load on the measurement day, we studied the cow individual activity response to the heat load accumulated over the three days preceding the measurement day. The activity of the cows (n = 196) was measured by accelerometers and described the resting behavior and the number of steps per cow and day. The analysis models included autocorrelations in time series as well as individual cow factors. An increase in the duration and intensity of heat load on the measurement day led to a decrease in the lying time and an increase in the number of steps. The cows showed a reduced activity response to heat load when there was additional heat load accumulation over the three days preceding the measurement day. The cows in an advanced stage of lactation were more sensitive to heat load than cows in the early lactation stage. Multiparous cows showed less pronounced activity responses than primiparous cows. Heat load accumulation and individual cow-related factors should be considered in prediction models for the sensitive animal-specific recognition of heat load on the basis of activity responses.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.03.011,82,NA,23-32,NA,Temperature-humidity index; Heat load accumulation; Activity; Time series analysis

The penetration rate for cells treated with targeted nanoparticles was shown to be more than that of non-targeted nanoparticles. Moreover, it was revealed that the treatment of cells with >= 50 mu g/ml FA-PG-SPIONs in combination with hyperthermia induced cytotoxicity in comparison to control cells. The results also showed that increasing the concentrations of targeted nanoparticles (FA-PG-SPIONs) and heating time would increase the value of thermal enhancement factor (TEF). In contrast, TEF values were not increased with increasing heating time and concentrations of non-targeted nanoparticles (PG-SPIONs). On the other hand, TEF values were increased with increasing concentrations and heating time so that the maximum TEF value was obtained at the highest concentration (FA-PG-SPION, 200 mu g/ml) as well as the longest heating duration (60 min).

article,Source of environmental data and warming tolerance estimation in six species of North American larval anurans,"Katzenberger, Marco and Hammond, John and Tejedo, Miguel and Relyea, Rick",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The current global warming scenario has led to a renewed interest in determining which species are more vulnerable to climate change. Hence, it is important to understand which factors can affect estimates of species vulnerability. We determined the critical thermal maxima (CTmax) for six species of North American anuran larvae and measured the environmental temperatures to which they are exposed during their aquatic stage to estimate their warming tolerance (WT; difference between the critical thermal maximum and the macro- and microhabitat maximum environmental temperatures). Our results indicate that these species exhibited CTmax values (37.8-41.7 degrees C) that were similar to other temperate species and positively correlated only with environmental temperatures measured at the microclimate scale. This indicates that microclimatic variables are better predictors of CTmax variation than macroclimate data. Moreover, most of the CTmax variation found was associated with higher taxonomic levels, indicating that related species may show similar CTmax values due to phylogenetic inertia. Studied species also exhibited high values of WT (10.3-22.6 degrees C), similar to temperate amphibian species from other bioregions. This indicates that there is a considerable gap between the species' critical thermal maximum and maximum environmental temperature, whether using datalogger (microclimate) or WorldClim (macroclimate) environmental data. However, WT estimates based on datalogger data were not related to those based on macroclimate environmental data. Finally, variation associated with the type of environmental data used (macro- vs. microclimate) had a profound influence on WT estimates. Hence, our perception of which species are more vulnerable to global warming changes may depend on the scale of the climate data used.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.07.005,76,NA,171-178,NA,Critical thermal maximum; Amphibians; Macroclimate; North America; Microclimate

Broilers in the control and HS groups were fed a basal diet, and in the MOS group were given the basal diet supplemented with 1 g/kg MOS for 42 days, respectively. The temperature was maintained 32-33 degrees C for the first 3 days for all broilers, and it was gradually reduced by 3 degrees C per week to a final temperature of 20 degrees C in the control group, whereas it remained unchanged for 8 h and reduced to the same level to the control group for the remaining 16 h daily in the both HS and MOS groups. Compared with the control group, cyclic HS resulted in retarded growth performance and increased serum corticosterone level (P < 0.05). The supplementation of MOS promoted growth performance and reduced serum corticosterone concentration in broilers subjected to cyclic HS (P < 0.05). Cyclic HS increased drip loss(48 h), cooking loss, malondialdehyde accumulation, and moisture content, whereas decreased pH(24 h) value, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity, and crude protein content in the breast muscle (P < 0.05).

In the case of ectotherms in particular, the very important parameter of thermal biology has to be taken into account. Here we investigated the thermoregulatory effectiveness (E) of two endemic Greek lizards (Hellenolacerta graeca and Podarcis peloponnesiacus) that live syntopically on a rocky cliff in the Peloponnese. We presumed that the two species would select different microhabitats, to avoid interspecific competition, and follow a similar thermoregulation pattern as they experience the same conditions. We also expected that E values for both species would differ depending on the season. Overall, we found that the two species had similar E values for each season but differentiated partial thermoregulatory attributes. Though they both occurred in the same types of microhabitat, H.graeca selected higher sites (average 99 cm above ground) than P. peloponnesiacus (average 44 cm). Also, the latter achieved higher preferred temperatures during summer and winter.

Their behaviour can provide a relief under heat stress, and increase their survival through thermoregulation. Here, we used infrared imaging to reveal the thermoregulatory behavioural strategies used by the snail Littorina saxatilis (Olivi) on different microhabitats of a high shore boulder field in Finistere (western France) in summer. On our study site, substrate temperature is frequently greater than L. saxatilis upper physiological thermal limits, especially on sun exposed microhabitats. To maintain body temperatures within their thermal tolerance window, withdrawn snails adopted a flat posture, or elevated their shells and kept appended to the rock on the outer lip of their aperture with dried mucous (standing posture). These thermal regulatory behaviours lowered snail body temperatures on average by 1-2 degrees C. Aggregation behaviour had no thermoregulatory effect on L. saxatilis in the present study. The occupation of biogenic microhabitats (barnacles) was associated with a 1 degrees C decrease in body temperatures.

We used native Canadian Pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) sunfish, and non-native Pumpkinseed introduced into the milder climate of Spain 100 years ago, to assess genetic differences in thermal physiology in response to the warmer non-native climate. We compared temperature performance reaction norms of two Canadian and two Spanish Pumpkinseed populations born and raised within a common environment. We found that Canadian Pumpkinseed had higher routine metabolic rates when measured at seasonally high temperatures (15 degrees C in winter, 30 degrees C in summer), and that Spanish Pumpkinseed had higher critical thermal maxima when acclimated to 30 degrees C in the summer. Growth rates were not significantly different among populations, however Canadian Pumpkinseed tended to have faster growth at the warmest temperatures measured (32 degrees C). The observed differences in physiology among Canadian and Spanish populations at the warmest acclimation temperatures are consistent with the introduced populations being better suited to the warmer non-native climate than native populations. The observed differences could be the result of either founder effects, genetic drift, and/or contemporary adaptive evolution in the warmer nonnative climate.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.12.010,64,NA,48-57,NA,Climate change; Invasive species; Fish; Thermal adaptation; Countergradient variation

Yet, some studies suggest that the thermal behavior of some lizard species is evolutionarily rigid. During two successive years, we compared the thermal biology of two populations of Liolaemus pictus living at the northern (warmer) and one population living at the southern (colder) range limits, thus spanning an 800 km latitudinal distance. Populations at the two range margins belong to two deeply divergent evolutionary clades. We quantified field body temperatures (T-b), laboratory preferred body temperatures (PBT), and used operative temperature data (T-e) to calculate the effectiveness of thermoregulation (E). During one year in all populations, we further exposed half of the lizards to a cold or a hot acclimation treatment to test for plasticity in the thermal behavior. The environment at the southern range limit was characterized by cooler weather and lower T-e. Despite that, females had higher T-b and both males and females had higher PBT in the southernmost population (or Glade) than in the northernmost populations. Acclimation to cold conditions led to higher PBT in all populations suggesting that plastic responses to thermal conditions, instead of evolutionary history, may contribute to geographic variation. Lizards regulated moderately well their body temperature (E approximate to 0.7): they avoided warm microhabitats in the northern range but capitalized on warm microhabitats in the southern range.

article,Using GAMM to examine inter-individual heterogeneity in thermal performance curves for <i>Natrix natrix</i> indicates bet hedging strategy by mothers,"Vickers, Mathew J. and Aubret, Fabien and Coulon, Aurelie",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The thermal performance curve (TPC) illustrates the dependence on body- and therefore environmental temperature of many fitness-related aspects of ectotherm ecology and biology including foraging, growth, predator avoidance, and reproduction. The typical thermal performance curve model is linear in its parameters despite the well-known, strong, non-linearity of the response of performance to temperature. In addition, it is usual to consider a single model based on few individuals as descriptive of a species-level response to temperature. To overcome these issues, we used generalized additive mixed modeling (GAMM) to estimate thermal performance curves for 73 individual hatchling Natrix natrix grass snakes from seven clutches, taking advantage of the structure of GAMM to demonstrate that almost 16\% of the deviance in thermal performance curves is attributed to inter-individual variation, while only 1.3\% is attributable to variation amongst clutches. GAMM allows precise estimation of curve characteristics, which we used to test hypotheses on tradeoffs thought to constrain the thermal performance curve: hotter is better, the specialist-generalist trade off, and resource allocation/acquisition. We observed a negative relationship between maximum performance and performance breadth, indicating a specialist-generalist tradeoff, and a positive relationship between thermal optimum and maximum performance, suggesting ``hotter is better{''}. There was a significant difference among matrilines in the relationship between Area Under the Curve and maximum performance- relationship that is an indicator of evenness in acquisition or allocation of resources. As we used unfed hatchlings, the observed matriline effect indicates divergent breeding strategies among mothers, with some mothers provisioning eggs unequally resulting in some offspring being better than others, while other mothers provisioned the eggs more evenly, resulting in even performance throughout the clutch. This observation is reminiscent of bet-hedging strategies, and implies the possibility for intra-clutch variability in the TPCs to buffer N. natrix against unpredictable environmental variability.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.11.003,63,NA,16-23,NA,Inter-individual variation; Snake; Reptile; Ectotherm; Evolutionary; Specialist-generalist tradeoff
article,"Regional warming and the thermal regimes of American crocodile nests in the Tempisque Basin, Costa Rica","Murray, Christopher M. and Easter, Michael and Padilla, Sergio and Marin, Mahmood Sasa and Guyer, Craig",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Spatial variation in global climate change makes population-specific responses to this enigmatic threat pertinent on a regional scale. Organisms with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) potentially possess a unique physiological susceptibility that threatens population viability if rapid environmental effects on sex ratios render populations non-viable. A heavily male-biased sex ratio for hatchling American crocodiles of the Tempisque Basin, Costa Rica requires assessment of how nest temperature affects sex determination at this site, how females might compensate for these effects when creating nests, and how current patterns of climate change might alter future sex ratios and survival in hatchling cohorts. We demonstrate high within-nest variation in temperature but predict a female bias at hatching based on nest temperatures quantified here. Further, our data suggest that egg size and metabolic heating associated with this factor outweighs microhabitat parameters and depth in influencing nest thermal regimes. Finally, we document regional warming in the Tempisque Basin over the last 15 years and project that further heating over the next 15 years will not yield hatchling sex ratios as male biased as those currently found at this site. Thus, we find no support for nest temperature or climate change as likely explanations for male-biased American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) sex ratios in the Tempisque Basin. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

X. and Yang, R. Q.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"We evaluated the effect of cold shock on the fatty acid composition, antioxidant enzymes, and physiological responses of genetically improved farmed tilapia (GIFT). Experimental GIFT tilapia, a warm-water teleost, were initially acclimated at 28 degrees C and then transferred directly to 13 degrees C. Stress responses were monitored for 120 h. There was a significant change in all parameters in response to the cold stressor (P < 0.05). Serum cortisol levels increased from 336.93 ng/ml to a peak of 1165.31 ng/ml 24 h after the initial cold shock, and declined rapidly thereafter. Serum glucose and cholesterol levels were significantly lower in the low temperature group than the control group at 120 h (P < 0.05). Acute low temperature stress enhanced superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and glutathione levels in the liver of GIFT tilapia. The GIFT tilapia were able to selectively metabolize fatty acids for energy needs during the early period of exposure to low-temperature stress. During this time, they primarily used saturated fatty acids for energy. However as the duration of the stressor and loss of muscle fat increased, the fish began to metabolize long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Increased malondialdehyde was produced by oxidation of these fatty acids leading to oxidative damage. Our results provide insight into the changes in fatty acid metabolism physiology that allow GIFT tilapia juveniles to adapt to short-term cold stress. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

S. and Ambasankar, K. and Krishnani, K. K. and Rana, R. S.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Endosulfan is an organochlorine pesticide commonly found in aquatic environments that has been found to reduce thermal tolerance of fish. Lipotropes such as the food additive, Lecithin has been shown to improve thermal tolerance in fish species. This study was conducted to evaluate the role of lipotropes (lecithin) for enhancing the thermal tolerance of Chanos chanos reared under sublethal low dose endosulfan-induced stress. Two hundred and twenty-five fish were distributed randomly into five treatments, each with three replicates. Four isocaloric and isonitrogenous diets were prepared with graded levels of lecithin: normal water and fed with control diet (En0/L0), endosulfan-treated water and fed with control diet (En/L0), endosulfan-treated water and fed with 1\% (En/L1\%), 1.5\% (En/L1.5\%) and 2\% (En/L2\%) lecithin supplemented feed. The endosulfan in treated water was maintained at the level of 1/40th of LC50 (0.52 ppb). At the end of the five weeks, critical temperature maxima (CTmax), lethal temperature maxima (LTmax), critical temperature minima (CTmin) and lethal temperature minima (LTmin) were Determined. There was a significant (P < 0.01) effect of dietary lecithin on temperature tolerance (CTmax, LTmax, CTmin and LTmin) of the groups fed with 1, 1.5 and 2\% lecithin-supplemented diet compared to control and endosulfan-exposed groups. Positive correlations were observed between CT max and LTmax (R-2=0.934) as well as between CTmin and LTmin (R-2=0.9313). At the end of the thermal tolerance study, endosulfan-induced changes in cellular stress enzymes (Catalase, SOD and GST in liver and gill and neurotansmitter enzyme, brain AChE) were significantly (p < 0.01) improved by dietary lecithin.

article,Black wildebeest seek shade less and use solar orientation behavior more than do blue wildebeest,"Lease, Hilary M. and Murray, Ian W. and Fuller, Andrea and Hetem, Robyn S.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Many ungulates, including wildebeest, seek shade and orient their bodies relative to incoming solar radiation in order to reduce environmental heat loads. Blue (Connochaetes taurinus) and black wildebeest (Connochaetes gnou), which co-exist artificially in some reserves in South Africa, are thought to adopt different thermoregulatory behaviors to mitigate high environmental heat loads. However, whether or not blue and black wildebeest use different behaviors to reduce heat loads in regions where they co-occur has never previously been examined. We compared the shade seeking and solar orientation behavior of free-ranging blue and black wildebeest in summer at three locations in South Africa where both species co-occur. We found that blue wildebeest exhibited more shade seeking behavior than did black wildebeest at all times of day, at all study sites. Black wildebeest remained in the sun but were more likely than blue wildebeest to orient their bodies parallel to the sun at all study sites, a behavior which reduces the amount of surface area exposed to incoming radiation. Black wildebeest were most likely to employ parallel solar orientation during the hottest times of the day when the sun was not directly overhead (i.e., solar noon +/- 1 hour). We thus demonstrate that co-occurring blue and black wildebeest use different thermoregulatoty behaviors to reduce high heat loads. It is possible that the lack of shade in the historical distribution of black wildebeest led to selective pressure for reliance on solar orientation. Differences in thermoregulatory behavior can affect species-specific heat loads, habitat use, body mass, fitness and grazing activity. Such differences may also allow blue and black wildebeest to inhabit separate microclimates within the same habitat, provided there is sufficient heterogeneity in vegetation structure, potentially facilitating reproductive isolation.

When oxygen demand exceeds oxygen availability, animals may experience functional hypoxia regardless of environmental oxygen levels. In the current study, we aimed to assess if oxidative or thermal restrictions exist when winter-acclimated Haliotis midae juveniles are re-acclimated to temperatures within their thermal tolerance range, but with one temperature outside the average daily temperatures they would experience in winter. At each acclimation temperature (14, 16 and 19 degrees C), we also manipulated dissolved oxygen levels to obtain oxygen saturation levels of 82\%, 98\% and 126\%. Our results indicate growth restrictions and hypometabolism at all oxygen treatments at 19 degrees C. Efficiency of mitochondrial respiration, as indicated by an increase in cytochrome c oxidase subunits 1 and 2 (cox1 and cox2) transcript level, was improved at 19 degrees C, 98\% oxygen. A change in substrate utilisation, from a glycogen/lipid-driven metabolism to almost exclusively protein-driven metabolism provided the fuel for more effective cellular respiration. A further decrease in metabolic rate at 19 degrees C, 126\% oxygen, this time without an increase in cox1 and cox2 transcripts, may indicate some improvement in gas exchange, but without improvement in growth. We propose that 19 degrees C is nearing a long-term limiting temperature for winter-acclimated SA abalone, and that animals survive this condition by re-allocating available energy to survival mechanisms instead of growth. This species, already threatened by over-harvesting, may be further threatened by increases in surface seawater temperatures. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Also, the impact of climatic conditions on milk yield and productive and reproductive status was assessed. An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was used in data fitting to predict future monthly herd milk yield and reproductive status using data from 2014 to 2020. Based on the annual total milk output, the highest predicted percentage of milk yield based on the yearly milk production was in February (9.1\%; 95\% CI = 8.3-9.9) and the lowest in August (6.9\%; 95\% CI = 6.0-7.9). The predicted highest percentage of pregnant cows for 2021 was in May (61.8; 95\% CI = 53.0-70.5) and the lowest for November (33.2\%; 95\% CI = 19.9-46.5). The monthly percentage of dry cows in this study showed a steady trend across years; the predicted highest percentage was in September (20.1\%; CI = 16.4-23.7) and the lowest in March (7.5\%; 4.0-11.0). The predicted days in milk (DIM) were lower in September (158; CI = 103-213) and highest in May (220; 95\% CI = 181-259).

The current study was conducted to estimate the threshold of temperature humidity index (THI)1 and genetic features for milk yield of first-lactation Mehsana buffaloes using an univariate repeatability test-day model. The data included 130,475 first lactation test-day milk yield (FLTDMY) records of 13,887 Mehsana buffaloes and the daily temperature and humidity.

The early lactating Holstein cows (42 +/- 2 days in milk, 29.27 +/- 0.38 kg/day milk yield, 1.21 +/- 0.05 parity) were subjected to two 14-day periods, each consisting of 7 days of adaptation and 7 days of heat stress. Conditions were set to 22 degrees C and 50\% humidity during adaptation, followed by heat stress periods with low-temperature, low-humidity (LTLH, 71 THI) and high-temperature, high-humidity (HTHH, 86 THI) treatments.

In the study, the HTHH group displayed marked physiological and biochemical changes on 14 days of heat stress exposure compared to the LTLH group. Firstly, the HTHH group's dry matter intake decreased by approximately 12\% while their water intake increased by about 23\%. Secondly, both milk yield and milk protein production in the HTHH group decreased by 10\% and 20\%, respectively. Thirdly, there was a reduction in white blood cells, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and platelets in the HTHH group, with concurrent increases in glucose, non-esterified fatty acids, and albumin concentrations. Additionally, the HTHH group exhibited elevated plasma concentrations of cortisol and haptoglobin. Moreover, the gene expression of heat shock protein 70 and heat shock protein 90 was significantly upregulated in the HTHH group's peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Lastly, key physiological indicators such as rectal temperature, heart rate, and skin temperature showed substantial elevations in the HTHH group.

While sheep have innate mechanisms to manage heat stress, prolonged exposure impairs their performance and health. This study evaluated the influence of varying doses of Curcumin Nano-Micelle (CNM) on heat-stressed fattening lambs in northeastern Iran over three months, examining the relationship between CNM doses and growth performance, feeding behavior, physiological responses, immune function, and antioxidant status. Thirty-two crossbred male lambs were included in a completely randomized design with four treatments and eight replications. The experimental treatments were as follows: 1) CTRL: No dietary inclusion of CNM, (control group); 2) T20: Dietary inclusion of 20 mg of CNM per head per day; 3) T40: Dietary inclusion of 40 mg of CNM per head per day; and 4) T80: Dietary inclusion of 80 mg of CNM per head per day. The results revealed that dietary supplementation with 20 and 40 mg of CNM significantly improved live body weight, weight gain, average daily gain (ADG), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) compared to the control treatment. Regression analysis demonstrated quadratic models between growth performance parameters and the Temperature-Humidity Index (THI), indicating a correlation between CNM doses and the animals' responses to heat stress. Regarding eating behavior, CNM doses of 40 and 80 mg/day significantly reduced eating time while increasing ruminating time. Blood analysis indicated significant reductions in glucose levels across all treatments, with T40 significantly reducing both cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) levels. Additionally, CNM supplementation decreased serum malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities, indicating enhanced antioxidant status. Physiological responses were influenced by CNM, notably reducing rectal temperature (RT), skin temperature (ST), respiration rate (RR), while pulse rate (PR) increased across various time intervals, particularly in the T80 group.

We have analysed the oxygen isotope composition of bioapatite phosphate (delta 18Op) from one permanent tooth and from thirty-six skeletal elements of one adult male harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) from the Baie de Somme (Hauts-de-France, France). We propose that the observed intra-skeletal delta 18Op variability reflects tissue temperature heterogeneities typical of the pinniped regional heterothermy strategy. Our delta 18Op data indicate that bone hydroxylapatite from harbour seal autopod skeletal elements (metacarpals, metatarsals, and phalanxes) mineralises at a lower temperature than that of the bone from the axial skeleton (e.g. vertebrae, ribs, and girdle bones). The results suggest that it is possible to locate a history of regional heterothermies in amphibious marine vertebrates using the delta 18Op values of their mineralised tissues. This enables direct evaluation of the thermophysiology of both modern and fossil Pinnipedia from their skeletons opening perspectives on understanding their thermal adaptation to the marine environment in the fossil record.

At the cellular level, exposure to varying temperatures affects the mitochondrial functional properties of poikilothermic organisms. Metabolic enzymes that supply reduced substrates to the electron transport chain and elements of the oxidative phosphorylation system must therefore adjust their activity and flux rates to the altered temperature conditions. In the present study, Daphnia magna respiration was analyzed in response to acute and chronic changes in ambient temperature. Oxygen consumption as well as substrate and electron flux rates were measured at the animals' acclimation temperature and at two additional acute temperatures. High activity of citrate synthase (CS) in cold-acclimated animals (10 degrees C) may have resulted from mitochondrial quantitative adjustments. However, thermal sensitivity of the functional properties of mitochondrial enzymes was greater in warm-acclimated animals (30 degrees C). In whole animals, temperature-induced changes were partly compensated by acclimation, but these changes were promoted by acclimation in the case of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Thus, respiration realised in whole animals was limited by the provision of reduced substrates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle rather than by restrictions of the respiratory chain complexes. This may minimize production of reactive oxygen species and resulting damage and reduce waste of substrates from the animals' energy reserves. Still, the integrated biomarker response indicated increased defense against oxidative stress at elevated temperatures.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103761,119,NA,NA,103761,Mitochondria; Temperature acclimation; OROBOROS; OXPHOS; Respiration; Metabolism

There are several hypotheses to explain species' energy allocation. One prominent hypothesis suggests higher energy expenditure in winter due to increased thermoregulatory costs. The ``reallocation{''} hypothesis suggests no net difference in seasonal energy requirements, while the ``increased demand{''} hypothesis predicts higher energy requirements during the breeding season. Birds are expected to adjust their mass and/or metabolic intensity in ways that are consistent with their energy requirements. Here, we look for metabolic signatures of seasonal variation in energy requirements of a resident passerine of a temperate-zone (great tit, Parus major). To do so, we measured whole-body and mass-independent basal (BMR), summit (Msum), and field (FMR) metabolic rates during late winter and during breeding in Belgian great tits. During the breeding season, birds had on average 10\% higher whole-body BMR and FMR compared to winter, while their Msum decreased by 7\% from winter to breeding. Mass-independent metabolic rates showed a 10\% increase in BMR and a 7\% decrease in Msum from winter to breeding. Whole-body BMR was correlated with Msum, but this relationship did not hold for mass-independent metabolic rates. The modest seasonal change we observed suggests that great tits in our temperature study area maintain a largely stable energy budget throughout the year, which appears mostly consistent with the reallocation hypothesis.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103748,118,NA,NA,103748,Great tit; Energy expenditure; Metabolic rates

Turtles selected warmer locations compared to those available in aquatic and terrestrial habitats only within home ranges, but did not show any temperature preferences when selecting home ranges at the larger scale. Turtles selected locations that were less thermally-variable than their surroundings, both at the home range scale and within home ranges. Thermal habitat selection was strongest during colder and more thermally-variable pre-nesting season compared to later periods. Despite differences in thermal mass between species, both species responded similarly to temperature variation. We conclude that freshwater turtles at their northern range margin select suitable microclimates within the suite of conditions that are naturally available.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103725,118,NA,NA,103725,Animal behaviour; Ectotherm; Thermal biology; Spatial scale; Thermoregulation

Test fish with an initial body weight range of 17.60-18.78 g were reared in 5 independent recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) with three tanks (50 fish/tank) for 8 weeks. The water temperature of the RAS was set at 14 \& DEG;C, 18 \& DEG;C, 22 \& DEG;C, 26 \& DEG;C, and 30 \& DEG;C, respectively. At conclusion of the feeding trial, the effects of water temperature on C. guichenoti were analyzed based on survival, growth performance, digestive enzymes activities, and antioxidant capacity. The results showed that the fish survived in all temperature groups. The fish in the groups (26 \& DEG;C and 30 \& DEG;C) had higher values of body length, body weight, specific growth rate, weight gain rate, and daily gain than those in the group (22 \& DEG;C). The lowest values of growth performance were observed in the groups (14 \& DEG;C and 18 \& DEG;C) among the 5 groups. The lowest values of feed conversion ratio (FCR) were observed in the group (26 \& DEG;C). Regression analysis identified the minimum FCR at 26.55 \& DEG;C. The feeding rates (FR) were increased gradually with the increase of temperature. Regression analysis identified the maximum FR at 28.33 \& DEG;C. The activities of protease and lipase in the gut were higher than those in the liver, while amylase activity was lower in the gut than that in the liver. There were no significant differences in ac-tivities of protease and lipase among different parts of the intestinal tract at the temperatures range from 18 to 26 \& DEG;C. When the temperature was out the optimal range, C. guichenoti would be under chronic stress, resulting in decreased lysozyme activity and cortisol concentration. Inconclusion, the optimal temperature for juvenile C. guichenoti is 26.55-28.33 \& DEG;C based on the maximal growth performance and feed utilization.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103595,115,NA,NA,103595,Temperature; Coreius guichenoti; Growth; Digestive enzymes; Serum indices
article,Constant-temperature predictions underestimate growth of a fungal amphibian pathogen under individual host thermal profiles,"Greenspan, Sasha E. and Roznik, Elizabeth A. and Edwards, Lexie and Duffy, Richard and Berger, Lee and Bower, Deborah S. and Pike, David A. and Schwarzkopf, Lin and Alford, Ross A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Ectotherm body temperatures fluctuate with environmental variability and host behavior, which may influence host-pathogen interactions. Fungal pathogens are a major threat to ectotherms and may be highly responsive to the fluctuating thermal profiles of individual hosts, especially cool-loving fungi exposed to high host temperatures. However, most studies estimate pathogen thermal performance based on averages of host or surrogate environmental temperatures, potentially missing effects of short-term host temperature shifts such as daily or hourly heat spikes. We recorded individual thermal profiles of Australian rainforest frogs using temperaturesensitive radio-transmitters. We then reproduced a subset of individual thermal profiles in growth chambers containing cultures of the near-global amphibian pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) to investigate how realistic host temperature profiles affect Bd growth. We focused on thermal profiles that exceed the thermal optimum of Bd because the effects of realistic heat spikes on Bd growth are unresolved. Our laboratory incubation experiment revealed that Bd growth varied in response to relatively small differences in heat spike characteristics of individual frog thermal profiles, such as a single degree or a few hours, highlighting the importance of individual host behaviors in predicting population-level disease dynamics. The fungus also grew better than predicted under the most extreme and unpredictable frog temperature profile, recovering from two days of extreme (nearly 32 degrees C) heat spikes without negative effects on overall growth, suggesting we are underestimating the growth potential of the pathogen in nature. Combined with the previous finding that Bd reduces host heat tolerance, our study suggests that this pathogen may carry a competitive edge over hosts in the face of anthropogenic climate change.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103394,111,NA,NA,103394,Amphibian; Australian Wet Tropics; Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; Thermal performance; Body temperature; Chytridiomycosis; Incubator; Incubation experiment

However, the analyses of thermal images often request manual actions, and little is known about the effect of the evaluator's experience on analysis thermal images. Here, we determine the reproducibility of IRT images analysis performed by evaluators with different levels of experience. Eight evaluators (GE, group experienced, n = 4; GN, group novice, n = 4) analyzed thermograms from 40 healthy participants recorded before and after exercise to determine the mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, and range of skin temperature in the anterior thigh and posterior leg. Before and after exercise, mean temperature showed excellent reproducibility for both groups for the anterior thigh (ICC >0.98) and posterior leg (ICC >0.94), and maximum temperature showed excellent reproducibility for both groups in the posterior leg (ICC >0.91). The influence of experience level was not significant considering the anterior thigh. Similarly, experience level did not affect the mean, maximum, and standard deviation tem-perature determined for the posterior leg. For the posterior leg, minimum temperature presented lower values and the range was higher among novice evaluators. Mean skin temperature showed narrower 95\% limits of agreement than minimum and maximum for both regions and moments. Caution is advised when temperature ranges and minimums are determined by different evaluators. We conclude that for IRT analysis by evaluators with different levels of experience, the mean and maximum temperatures should be prioritized due to their better reproducibility.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103345,110,NA,NA,103345,Infrared camera; Mean skin temperature; Maximum skin temperature; Physical exercise; Thermal images
article,A study of physical factors influencing park cooling intensities and their effects in different time of the day,"Zhang, Jian and Gou, Zhonghua and Cheng, Bin and Khoshbakht, Maryam",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The quality of residents' lives have been negatively affected by problems resulting from global warming and urban heat island. Investigators have explored several ways to mitigate those problems. They found that vege-tation (especially trees) and water surfaces played a significant role in the adjustments of climate. Sites with more vegetation and larger-size waterbodies were cooler. However, the cooling effects of these elements were affected by contextual factors. For instance, cooling intensities of both vegetation and water surfaces fluctuated through the day. To further explore this phenomenon, this study investigated the cooling effects of trees and large waterbodies at different times of the day by means of field measurement. It was found that leaf area index (LAI) and distance from the sea (DFS) had a significant impact on park cooling intensities (PCI). Park points with more trees (indicated higher LAI) and those located closer to the sea were cooler. In addition, their cooling effects varied depending on the time of the day. LAI showed significant microclimatic adjusting effects late in the evening. Increasing the LAI by 1 point could help increase the PCI by 0.31 degrees C (18:00, R2 = 0.2421). In contrast, rising DFS resulted in PCI decrease by more than 2 degrees C (12:00 p.m., R2 = 0.4327). Cooling performances of the two factors were significant at different time periods of the day, that is, in the noon (the sea) and evening (trees) respectively. Further, the cooling effects of the trees might be affected by the distance from the sea. Findings from this study provided new understandings towards the climatic conditions of waterside cities.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103336,109,NA,NA,103336,Park cooling intensity; Coastal cities; Leaf area index; Distance from the sea; Parks

Rectal and body surface (eye, head and trunk) temperatures as well as the differences between rectal and surface (DBRS) temperatures were determined in 39 kids, having equal number of Red Sokoto, Sahel and West African Dwarf (WAD) goats during daytime nadir (07:00 h) and zenith (13:00 h) in ambient temperatures. All variables and blood samples were obtained from birth to Day 20, post-natal. Results revealed significantly (P < 0.05) lower values of morning and afternoon rectal temperatures at birth with subsequent post-natal increase, attaining higher stable values after Day 2. Morning head surface temperature decreased significantly after birth, whereas, DBRS temperatures were lower at birth and increased in subsequent days. From birth, diurnality was distinct (P < 0.05) in all body surface and DBRS temperatures, while, diurnality in rectal temperature was only observed on Days 1-8 (P < 0.05). All body temperatures (rectal, eye, head and trunk) recorded during the afternoon hours in the late neonatal life (Days 10-20) were significantly higher in WAD than Red Sokoto and Sahel kids. Buck-kids had higher (P < 0.05) values of morning rectal temperature than doelings.

article,Temporal climatic variability predicts thermal tolerance in two sympatric lizard species,"Clifton, Ian T. and Refsnider, Jeanine M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Thermal acclimatization, plastic shifts in thermal physiology in response to recent climatic conditions, is thought to be adaptive in highly seasonal environments where thermal variability is high but predictable. Thus, lizards from mid-latitude, desert environments should exhibit plasticity in their thermal tolerance limits, the upper (CTmax) and lower (CTmin) body temperatures they can withstand while maintaining physiological functioning, associated with changes in seasonal changes in climatic variation (i.e., when daily fluctuations in temperature are greater, lizards should have wider thermal tolerance breadths [}CTmax-CTmin]). We measured the thermal tolerance limits of two Phrynosomatid lizard species, Uta stansburiana and Sceloporus tristichus, occurring in sympatry at three time points to test for temporal variation in thermal physiology in response to climatic variation. We found that lizards of both species measured during times when climatic variability was high had wider thermal tolerance breadths than lizards measured when climatic variability was lower.

Three experiments were conducted using male broiler chickens (n = 720) aged 19-42 d. The design of two of the experiments was fully randomized in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement with two forms of feed (mash and pellet) and two nutritional levels (13.19 MJ/kg and 194.8 g/kg CP - normal level and 13.61 MJ/kg and 210.3 g/kg CP - high level). The experiments took place in a climate-controlled room: Experiment 1 at thermoneutrality (21-23 degrees C and 58-60\% relative humidity) for 24 h/day; Experiment 2 under thermal stress cycle (31-32 degrees C and 63-65\% relative humidity), for 6h/day and thermoneutrality (21-23 degrees C, 58-60\% relative humidity) for 18h/day. The nutrient digestibility and performance was analyzed. The design of the third experiment was fully randomized with two ambient condition treatments (thermoneutral and thermal stress) on heat production, caloric increment and net energy. Pellet feed obtained higher digestibility of dry matter, digestibility of crude protein, AME and AMEn (P < 0.05) than mash feed for broilers reared in the thermoneutral environment. At the high nutritional level there was no effect of treatments on the coefficient of dry matter and crude protein (DCCP) (P > 0.05), while the highest digestibility of AME and AMEn were obtained by the high nutritional level diet (P < 0.05).

Among these, environmental challenges are one of the most severe hurdles impacting the growth and productivity of poultry. In particular, the increasing frequency and severity of heat waves over the past few years represent a major challenge, and this is expected to worsen in the coming decades. Chickens are highly susceptible to high ambient temperatures (thermal stress), which negatively affect their growth and productivity, leading to enormous economic losses. In the light of global warming, these losses are expected to increase in the near future. Specifically, the worsening of climate change and the rise in global temperatures have augmented the adverse effects of heat on poultry production worldwide. At present, the world population is approximately 7.9 billion, and it has been predicted to reach 9.3 billion by 2050 and approximately 11 billion by 2100, implying a great demand for protein supply; therefore, strategies to mitigate future poultry challenges must be urgently devised. To date, several mitigation measures have been adopted to minimize the negative effects of heat stress in poultry. Of these, thermal acclimation at the postnatal stage or throughout the embryonic stages has been explored as a promising approach; however, for large-scale application, this approach warrants further investigation to determine the suitable temperature and poultry age. Moreover, molecular mechanisms governing thermal conditioning are poorly understood. To this end, we sought to expand our knowledge of thermal conditioning in poultry, which may serve as a valuable reference to improve the thermotolerance of chickens via nutritional management and vitagene regulation. Vitagenes regulate the responses of poultry to diverse stresses. In recent years, nutritionists have paid close attention to bioactive compounds such as resveratrol, curcumin, and quercetin administered alone or in combination. These compounds activate vitagenes and other regulators of the antioxidant defense system, such as nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2. Overall, thermal conditioning may be an effective strategy to mitigate the negative effects of heat stress. In this context, the present review synthesizes information on the adverse impacts of thermal stress, elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying thermal conditioning and its effects on the acquisition of tolerance to acute heat stress in later life. Finally, the role of some polyphenolic compounds, such as resveratrol, curcumin, and quercetin, in attenuating heat stress through the activation of the antioxidant defense system in poultry are discussed.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103169,103,NA,NA,103169,Heat Stress; Thermal conditioning; Vitagenes; Mitigation strategies; Poultry

Physiology of temperate and subtropical populations of blue crabs are well studied; however, a lack of information exists on tropical populations. Given the low locomotion capabilities of C. sapidus adult blue crabs, natural selection should favor traits that shape a particular thermal niche reflected through tolerance modulation to dissolved oxygen (DO). This study was designed to evaluate the thermal window and hypoxia sensitivity of the blue crab population in the southern Gulf of Mexico. The effect of acclimation temperatures from 20 degrees C to 34 degrees C on thermal preference (TP), critical thermal limits (CT), and thermal metabolic scope (TMS) was assessed in normoxia. Metabolic rate regulation over oxygen partial pressure (pO(2)) gradient was evaluated through oxygen consumption measurements at different degrees of acute hypoxia. Callinectes sapidus was observed tending to specialize towards higher temperatures, showing a mean TP from 26 degrees C to 33 degrees C. The lowest performance of aerobic pathways was observed at the coldest regimes and the highest at the warmest ones with mean TMS value being 35 \% greater at 34 degrees C than 20 degrees C. Patterns for metabolic regulation were dependent on the interaction between environmental temperature and DO, in which the interval from 29 degrees C to 34 degrees C provoked a 50 \% reduction in oxygen consumption when exposed to similar to 20\% air saturation levels. The results obtained showed that blue crabs distributed in the southern Gulf of Mexico could be close to their oxygen-temperature tolerance limits, which has important implications when climate change effects on species re-distribution is considered.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103078,102,NA,NA,103078,Callinectes sapidus; Oxy-regulation; Thermal tolerance; Local adaptation

Methods: 24 subjects performed 3 visits of 2 h walking (3mph/7\% grade) in an environmental chamber (33 degrees C/ 10\% relative humidity). In random order, subjects consumed water (W), electrolytes (Gatorade Zero; E), or electrolytes+carbohydrates (Gatorade; E+C). Throughout exercise (EX), subjects carried a 23 kg pack and drank ad-libitum. Pre-and post-EX, body mass (BM) and plasma osmolality (pOsm) were measured. Physiological Strain Index (PSI) and core temperature (T-C) were recorded every 15 min. Plasma glucose (GLU) was measured every 30 min. Cognitive processing (SCWT) was measured post-EX and compared to baseline (BL). A subset of 8 subjects performed a normothermic (N) protocol (21 degrees C/ambient humidity) to ascertain how the exercise stimulus influenced hydration status and cognition without heat. Results: There were no significant differences between fluid conditions (W, E, E+C) for BM loss (Delta 2.5 +/- 0.2, 2.5 +/- 0.2, 2.3 +/- 0.2 kg), fluid consumption (1.9 +/- 0.2, 1.9 +/- 0.2, 1.8 +/- 0.2L), pOsm (Delta 1.5 +/- 2.7, 2.2 +/- 2.4, 2.0 +/- 1.5 mmol/L), peak-PSI (7.5 +/- 0.4, 7.0 +/- 0.6, 7.9 +/- 0.5), and peak-TC (38.7 +/- 0.1, 38.6 +/- 0.2, 38.8 +/- 0.2 degrees C). GLU decreased significantly in W and E, whereas it increased above BL in E+C at 60, 90, and 120 min (P < 0.05). Compared to BL values (43.6 +/- 26 ms), SCWT performance significantly decreased in all conditions (463 +/- 93, 422 +/- 83, 140 +/- 52 ms, P < 0.05). Importantly, compared to W and E, the impairment in SCWT was significantly attenuated in E+C (P < 0.05). As expected, when compared to the heat-stress protocol (W, E, E+C), N resulted in lower BM loss, fluid consumption, and peak-PSI (1.1 +/- 0.1 kg, 1.2 +/- 0.7L, 4.8, respectively), and improved SCWT performance. Conclusions: These data are the first to suggest that, independent of supplementation variety, cognitive processing significantly decreases immediately following long-duration exercise in the heat in healthy humans. Compared to water and fluids supplemented with only electrolytes, fluids supplemented with carbohydrates significantly blunts this decrease in cognitive function.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103026,100,NA,NA,103026,Exercise heat stress; Heat stress; Cognitive function; Cognitive decline; Dehydration; Cardiovascular strain; Thermal strain; Ad libitum; physiological Strain index; Glucose ingestion; Stroop effect; Memory

Metabolic rate is one metric we can examine to improve our understanding of how well fish perform in different habitats, including across temperature gradients, as metabolism can be directly influenced by environmental temperatures in ectotherms. We estimated the standard metabolic rate, maximum metabolic rate, and aerobic scope of lab-reared juvenile Brook Trout (similar to 1 year) using intermittent-flow respirometry across a range of temperatures (5-23 degrees C) likely experienced in the wild. We included a diurnal temperature cycle of +/- 1.5 degrees C for each treatment temperature to simulate temporal variation observed in natural waterbodies. Standard metabolic rate and maximum metabolic rate both increased with acclimation temperature before appearing to plateau around 20 degrees C, while mass specific aerobic scope was found to increase from a mean of 287.25 +/- 13.03 mg O2.kg(-1).h (-1) at 5 degrees C to 384.85 +/- 13.31 mg O2.kg(-1).h (-1) at 15 degrees C before dropping at higher temperatures. Although a slight peak was found at 15 degrees C, the generally flat thermal performance curve for aerobic scope suggests Brook Trout are capable of adjusting to a relatively wide range of thermal regimes, appearing to be eurythermal, or a thermal generalist, at least for salmonids. The ability of this population to maintain similar physiological performance across a wide range of temperatures may help explain why Brook Trout succeed in a variety of different thermal habitats.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102929,99,NA,NA,102929,Aerobic scope; Brook trout; Temperature variation; Thermal generalist

article,Long term genetic selection for reproductive success affects neonatal lamb vitality across cold stress conditions,"Nel, Cornelius L. and Cloete, Schalk W. P. and Kruger, Annelie C. M. and Dzama, Kennedy",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Adverse weather conditions are important contributors to mortality in new-born lambs. Previous studies have shown variation between lambs in their ability to cope with circumstances of cold stress, and genetic selection could be a viable option for improving animal robustness. The Elsenburg Merino flock was divergently selected on number of lambs weaned (NLW). This resulted in divergent responses in reproduction and lamb survival. This study evaluated lamb vitality and mortality of positively selected H-Line relative to the negatively selected L-Line in response to cold stress. Traits included lamb rectal temperature (RT), surface temperature (ST), shiver score (SS), lamb vigor score (LVS), breaths per minute (BPM), mortality to three days of age (M3) and to weaning (TM). Cold stress was described by a chill index derived from daily rainfall, wind speed and ambient temperature, and represented as the mean of the one (CI), two (CI-2) or three (CI-3) days since parturition. Overall, HLine lambs had a higher neonatal RT and were less likely to succumb than L-Line contemporaries. In a significant (P < 0.05) interaction, the predicted RT of L-Line showed a non-linear decline with increased levels of CI-2, while H-Line lambs better maintained their core temperature. M3 was also affected by a significant interaction between CI-3 and selection line, further suggesting that observed lower mortality rates in the H-Line depends on H-Line lambs' improved ability to cope with stressful environments. Long term selection for NLW in the H-Line led to improvements in both adaptations associated with lower lamb losses. The continued recording of viability traits to produce larger datasets amenable to genetic analysis is recommended, specifically for rectal temperature.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102908,98,NA,NA,102908,Sheep; Lamb survival; Chill index; Heat loss; Selection; Lamb viability

It is critical to identify specific stressors to assess a species vulnerability to extinction, especially in species with distinctive natural histories. Here, we present a combination of field, laboratory, and modeling approaches to evaluate the potential consequences of climate change on two endemic, fossorial lizards species (Anniella geronimensis and Bipes biporus) from Baja California, Mexico. We also include soil type in our models to refine the suitable areas using our mechanistic models. Results suggest that both species are at high risk of extinction by global climate change based on the thermal habitat suitability. The forecast for species persistence is most grave under the RCP8.5 scenario. On the one hand, suitable habitat for A. geronimensis diminishes at its southern distribution, but potential suitable expands towards the north. On the other hand, the suitable habitat for B. biporus will contract significantly with a concomitant reduction in its potential distribution. Because both species have low mobility and are restricted to low elevation, the potential for elevational and latitudinal dispersal to mitigate extinction risk along the Baja California Peninsula is unlikely. In addition each species has specialized thermal requirements (i.e., stenothermic) and soil type preferences to which they are adapted.

Unfortunately, BSA is difficult to quantify, and existing prediction methods are not optimized for contemporary populations. Methods: The present study analyzed data body measurements from 5603 male and female participants of a US Army Anthropometric Survey to determine optimal methods for estimating BSA in modern US Army Soldiers. This data included 94 individual body measurements as well as three dimensional (3D) whole body scans for each participant. We used this data to assess and compared 15 existing equations to the measured data. We also derived best fitting nonlinear regression models for estimating BSA from different combinations of sex, height, and weight and iteratively included the remaining 91 measurements to determine which combinations resulted in the highest goodness-of-fit. Results: We found that inclusion of armspan measurements as a third body dimension maximized the model goodness-of-fit. Conclusion: Some of the existing formulae provide reasonable estimates of 3D-scanner derived BSA; while our new formulae derived from this study allows for more accurate estimates of BSA using one or more common input variables.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102650,92,NA,NA,102650,BSA; Anthropometrics; Predictive modeling; Surface scan
article,Thermal preferences of subtropical <i>Aedes aegypti</i> and temperate <i>Ae</i>. <i>japonicus</i> mosquitoes,"Verhulst, Niels O. and Brendle, Alexsandra and Blanckenhorn, Wolf U. and Mathis, Alexander",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature is an important determinant affecting the capacity of disease vectors like mosquitoes (Culicidae) to transmit disease agents. Although the impact of temperature on vector-borne disease dynamics has been studied intensively, the actual temperature encountered by the vector in a heterogeneous landscape is rarely taken into account. If disease vectors have temperature preferences and therefore select specific microhabitats, this would substantially influence key life history traits that determine transmission intensity. The thermal preferences of subtropical Aedes aegypti and temperate Ae. japonicus mosquitoes were investigated in a temperature gradient setup consisting of a Plexiglas box on top of an aluminium plate on two thermal regulators. Blood-fed (one day after feeding) and unfed (non-blood-fed) mosquitoes were released in small (15-20 degrees C, 20-25 degrees C, 25-30 degrees C) and large (15-30 degrees C, 30-45 degrees C) temperature gradients to assess their thermal preferences after 15 min. Additionally, the effect of humidity was investigated in a two-choice chamber setup. Both mosquito species avoided higher temperatures, pronouncedly dangerously high temperatures in the 30-45 degrees C gradient. At lower temperatures, blood-fed mosquitoes preferred the cooler sides of the 20-25 degrees C and 25-30 degrees C gradient, which were all below their rearing temperature. In the lowest gradient of 15-20 degrees C, no preferences were found. The thermal preference of unfed mosquitoes was similar to that of the blood-fed mosquitoes. No humidity preference or effect of humidity on temperature preferences was observed within the tested range (40-90\%). The set-up allows for assessing the thermal preference of mosquitoes under controlled conditions. The observed preference of mosquitoes for cooler temperatures would increase their longevity and slow down pathogen development. If similar micmhabitat selection is observed in the field, vector borne disease models should be adjusted accordingly.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102637,91,NA,NA,102637,Behaviour; Culicidae; Humidity; Microclimate; Temperature preference; Vector
article,Thermal plasticity in the invasive south American tomato pinworm <i>Tuta absoluta</i> (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae),"Tarusikirwa, Vimbai L. and Mutamiswa, Reyard and English, Sinead and Chidawanyika, Frank and Nyamukondiwa, Casper",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"South American tomato pinworm, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) is a devastating invasive global insect pest of tomato, Solanum lycopersicum (Solanaceae). In nature, pests face multiple overlapping environmental stressors, which may significantly influence survival. To cope with rapidly changing environments, insects often employ a suite of mechanisms at both acute and chronic time-scales, thereby improving fitness at sub-optimal thermal environments. For T. absoluta, physiological responses to transient thermal variability remain under explored. Moreso, environmental effects and physiological responses may differ across insect life stages and this can have implications for population dynamics. Against this background, we investigated short and long term plastic responses to temperature of T. absoluta larvae (4th instar) and adults (24-48 h old) from field populations. We measured traits of temperature tolerance vis critical thermal limits {[}critical thermal minima (CTmin) and maxima (CTmax)], heat knockdown time (HKDT), chill coma recovery time (CCRT) and supercooling points (SCP). Our results showed that at the larval stage, Rapid Cold Hardening (RCH) significantly improved CTmin and HKDT but impaired SCP and CCRT. Heat hardening in larvae impaired CTmin, CCRT, SCP, CTmax but not HKDT. In adults, both heat and cold hardening generally impaired CTmin and CTmax, but had no effects on HKDT, SCP and CCRT. Low temperature acclimation significantly improved CTmin and HKDT while marginally compromising CCRT and CTmax, whereas high temperature acclimation had no significant effects on any traits except for HKDT in larvae. Similarly, low and high temperature acclimation had no effects on CTmin, SCPs and CTmax, while high temperature acclimation significantly compromised adult CCRT. Our results show that larvae are more thermally plastic than adults and can shift their thermal tolerance in short and long timescales. The larval plasticity reported here could be advantageous in new envirnments, suggesting an asymmetrical ecological role of larva relative to adults in facilitating T. absoluta invasion.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102598,90,NA,NA,102598,Acclimation; Environmental stress; Hardening; Invasive species; Pinworm; Thermal tolerance

It is the aim of the present study to assess the health effects of cold and hot temperatures on the population living in the city of Isfahan. Daily data on average temperature and mortalities during the nine-year period 2008-2016 were obtained. Mortalities were stratified by causes (non-accidental, cardiovascular, respiratory, and stroke) and by age groups (0-14 years, 15-64 years, and >= 65 years). A standard time-series analysis was conducted using the Poisson model for cause-age-specific mortality effects of temperature, adjusted for seasonal and long-term trends as well as day of the week. Moreover, a distributed non-linear lag model (DNLM) with a 21-day lag time was used to determine the cumulative effects of cold and hot temperatures on mortality using the minimum mortality temperature (hereafter MMT) as the reference. A meta-analytical model was then used to pool the data thus obtained. Extreme temperatures were defied using cutoffs at 2.5th and 97.5th temperature percentiles and mortalities were reported as attributable to temperatures below and above MMT. A U-shaped curve was derived capturing the relationship between average temperature, on the one hand, and all the age and all the mortality cause groups, on the other. MMT was found to vary substantially for different age and cause groupings. Both cold and hot temperatures were found to increase the mortality risks, with a stronger effect of extreme temperatures. Cold temperature was responsible for a higher portion of the mortality than heat was. The cold effect on respiratory and stroke mortalities was higher than that on non-accidental and cardiovascular mortalities. Exposure to cold and hot temperatures increased relative risks of mortality in all age and cause groupings in Isfahan. Our findings can have important implications for mortality prevention in Isfahan.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102453,86,NA,NA,102453,Temperature; Mortality; Relative risk; Isfahan
article,The effect of small-scale morphology on thermal dynamics in coral microenvironments,"Ong, Robert H. and King, Andrew J. C. and Mullins, Benjamin J. and Caley, M. Julian",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The thermal microenvironments of corals is a topic of current interest given their relationship to coral bleaching. We present computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of corals with both smooth and rugged polyp surface topographies for two species of massive corals (Leptastrea purpurea and Platygyra sinensis) in order to predict their microscale surface warming. This study explores whether variation in polyp depth (PD) may directly effect a coral overall surface area-to-volume (A/V) ratio and consequently its surface warming. Validation of our models was made against detailed laboratory measurements of coral surface warming and thermal boundary layer thickness. Our results suggested that while differences in surface warming exist between smooth surfaces and surfaces covered in micro-polyps (5 mm depth), the variation in terms of surface warming is small ((similar to)0.18-0.19 degrees C) and it can be largely attributed to increasing A/V ratios. Our results demonstrated good agreement with measurements of surface temperatures on living corals and that ignoring the presence of polyps by modelling heat transfer associated with a smooth surface makes no material difference to the values obtained or the interpretation of the processes leading to surface warming.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102433,86,NA,NA,102433,Micro-scale morphology; Polyp thermal dynamics; CFD; Coral microenvironments

Therefore, it is important to find blood biomarkers to predict susceptibility to EHS. We compared gene expression profiling from blood cells between two groups of participants - those with and those without a history EHS - by using genome-wide microarray analysis. Subjects with a history of EHS (n = 6) and non-EHS controls without a history of EHS (n = 18) underwent a heat tolerance test and a thermoneutral exercise challenge on separate days. The heat tolerance test comprised of 2-h of walking, at 5 km/h and 2\% incline, with ambient conditions set at 40 degrees C, 40\% relative humidity; the thermoneutral test was similar, but had ambient conditions set at 22 degrees C. Next, we examined gene expression profiles, quantified based on arithmetic differences (post minus pre) during the heat test minus changes during the thermoneutral test. Genes related to interleukins and cellular stress were significantly down-regulated in participants with a history of EHS compared to their non-EHS counterparts. Suppression of these genes may be associated with susceptibility to exertional heat injury. Prospective research is required to determine whether similar gene expression profiling can be potentially used as blood biomarkers to predict susceptibility to EHS.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102423,85,NA,NA,102423,NA

Twelve healthy non-lactating Morada Nova ewes (3 +/- 1.2 years old, body mass 32.7 +/- 3.7 kg) were assigned in two 12 x 12 Latin square designs (from 07:00 to 19:00 h and from 19:00 to 07:00 h, respectively) for assessments of their biothermal responses during 24 consecutive days. There was a monophasic pattern in the ambient temperature (T-A), which ranged between 21 and 38 degrees C, thereby exposing the ewes to different levels of surrounding T-A over the day and influencing several of their bio-thermal responses (P = 0.0001). Their body temperatures (i.e., rectal, skin, and hair coat surface temperatures) gradually increased (P = 0.0001) from 04:00 h. The mean peak for rectal temperature (39.3 degrees C) was recorded at 19:00 h, while for skin and hair coat surface temperatures it occurred at 13:00 and 14:00 h, respectively. The sensible heat loss by long wave radiation and surface convection exceeded the metabolism of ewes when the T-A was below 24 degrees C, which usually occurred between 24:00 and 06:00 h. During exposure to higher ambient temperatures, the sheep increased respiratory evaporative heat loss, without panting. In conclusion, the sheep regulated rectal temperature within a relatively narrow range of 1.4 degrees C over 24 h, and appear to be well adapted to coping with heat. Minimum 24 h body temperature was correlated with minimum T-A, indicating that heat conservation strategies are likely to be important for Morada Nova sheep in a tropical biotype at night, when rates of sensible heat loss exceed the heat generated by metabolism.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.05.024,84,NA,83-91,NA,Morada nova sheep; Body temperature; Metabolism; Nycthemeral cycle; Sensible heat loss; Adaptation
article,Acclimation capability inferred by metabolic performance in two sea cucumber species from different latitudes,"Kuehnhold, Holger and Novais, Sara C. and Alves, Luis M. F. and Kamyab, Elham and Lemos, Marco F. L. and Slater, Matthew J. and Kunzmann, Andreas",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The notion that thermal specialists from tropical regions live closer to their temperature limits than temperate eurytherms, seems too generalized. Species specific differences in physiological and biochemical stress reactions are linked to key components of organism fitness, like metabolic capacity, which indicates that acclimation potential across latitudes might be highly diverse rather than simplistic. In this study the exposure of a tropical (Holothuria scabra) and a temperate (Holothuria forskali) sea cucumber species to identical cold- and warm-acclimation stress was compared using the key metabolic parameters, respiration rate, enzyme activity (ETS, LDH, IDH), and energy reserve fractions (lipid, carbohydrate and protein). Results show much broader respiratory adjustments, as response to temperature change, in H. scabra (2-30 mu gO(2){*}gww(-1){*}h(-1)) compared to H. forskali (1.5-6.6 mu gO(2){*}gww(-1){*}h(-1)). Moreover, the tropical species showed clearly pronounced up and down regulation of metabolic enzymes and shifts in energy reserves, due to thermal acclimation, while the same metabolic indicators remained consistent in the temperate species. In summary, these findings indicate enhanced metabolic plasticity in H. scabra at the cost of elevated energy expenditures, which seems to favor the tropical stenotherm in terms of thermal acclimation capacity. The comparison of such holistic metabolic analyses between conspecifics and congeners, may help to predict the heterogeneous effects of global temperature changes across latitudinal gradients.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.019,84,NA,407-413,NA,Eurytherms; Stenotherms; Holothuria scabra; Holothuria forskali; Energy metabolism; Temperature stress
article,Floor space and betaine supplementation alter the nutrient digestibility and performance of Japanese quail in a tropical environment,"Ratriyanto, Adi and Prastowo, Sigit",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"This study investigated the effects of floor space and betaine supplementation on the nutrient digestibility and performance of laying quail, at an advanced stage of production, in a tropical environment. In total, 408 laying quail (23 weeks old) were distributed in 3 x 2 factorial arrangements with four replicates. The first factor was floor space (250 cm(2) {[}FS-1], 221 cm(2) {[}FS-2], and 200 cm(2) per bird [}FS-3]) by allocating 15, 17, and 19 birds per cage (cage size: 3750 cm(2)). The second factor was betaine supplementation, administered at levels of 0 (Control) and 0.12\% (Betaine). The birds were housed under a natural, tropical environment that was outside the predominant thermoneutral zone, indicating heat stress conditions. Interactions were found between floor space and betaine on crude fiber digestibility, egg production, and eggshell thickness, with the highest values being yielded in FS-2 group supplemented with betaine. Reducing the floor space to 200 cm(2) negatively affected nutrient digestibility and performance. The birds kept in FS-3 had lower (P < 0.05) dry matter, crude protein, crude fat, and calcium digestibility values than those kept in FS-1 and FS-2. Birds housed in FS-2 exhibited higher egg weight than those in FS-3 (P < 0.05), although they did not differ from those in FS-1. Furthermore, a lower eggshell weight in FS-3, compared with FS-1 and FS-2, was observed (P < 0.01). Betaine supplementation enhanced the dry matter, crude protein, crude fat, crude ash, and calcium digestibility values (P < 0.05). Accordingly, betaine improved feed intake, egg weight, feed conversion, and protein and energy efficiency ratios (P < 0.01). Betaine also resulted in higher albumen, yolk, and eggshell weights (P < 0.01).

However, this technique presents several drawbacks which negatively affect participant's health. The aim of the present work is to determine whether supraclavicular skin temperature can be used as an indirect marker of cold-induced BAT and skeletal muscle F-18-FDG uptake in adults, while taking into account body composition. We performed a personalized cooling protocol just before an F-18-FDG-PET/CT scan, and we measured supraclavicular skin temperature before (in warm conditions) and after the cooling protocol in 88 adults (n = 57 women, mean age: 21.9 +/- 2.1 years old, body mass index: 24.5 +/- 4.3 km/m(2)). We found that supraclavicular skin temperature at the warm and cold periods was weakly and positively associated with BAT activity (SUVmean and SUVpeak: beta = 3.000; R-2 = 0.072; P = 0.022 and beta = 2.448; R-2 = 0.060; P = 0.021), but not with skeletal muscle F-18-FDG uptake, after controlling for body composition. We performed further analyses and the positive associations persisted only in the group of women. In conclusion, supraclavicular skin temperature in warm and cold conditions seems to be related with cold-induced F-18-FDG uptake by BAT only in women, although the low explained variance of these associations means that there are other factors involved in the supraclavicular skin temperature.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.04.006,82,NA,178-185,NA,brown fat; ibutton; Data-logger; Temperatus

In these systems and in a full-sun pasture, photosynthetically active radiation transmission, air temperature, relative humidity, black globe temperature, and wind speed were measured. These variables were used to calculate black globe temperature and humidity index (BGHI) and radiant thermal load (RU). Higher animal thermal comfort was observed in the silvopastoral systems due to changes in the microclimate induced by the trees; notably, a decrease in solar radiation transmission. Fewer hours of potential animal thermal stress (BGHI > 79) were observed in the silvopastoral systems than under the full-sun conditions, with differences up to 3 h per day. The silvopastoral systems presented lower radiant thermal load than the full-sun pasture with differences up to 22\% achieved. The assessed silvopastoral systems may help livestock adapt to climate change, since they achieved the limit of BGHI considered to cause stress to animals following an increase of 2.2 degrees C in air temperature, compared with full-sun pastures.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.12.015,79,NA,103-111,NA,Shading; Black globe temperature and humidity index; Radiant thermal load; Eucalyptus; Native trees
