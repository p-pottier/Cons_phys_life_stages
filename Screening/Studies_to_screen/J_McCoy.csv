article,Influence of temperature on swimming performance and respiration rate of the cold-water cyclopoid copepod<i> Cyclops</i><i> vicinus</i>,"Svetlichny, Leonid and Obertegger, Ulrike",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Little is known on the swimming activity and respiration rate of the cyclopoid copepod Cyclops vicinus. Here, the swimming speed and respiration rate of C. vicinus were measured at different temperatures using a high speed (up to 1200 frames per second) camera and a closed-system respirometry, respectively. For cruise and escape swimming, log-linear relationships were found between temperature (range 1-22 C) and duration, speed, and frequency of locomotor acts, respectively. The respiration rate of immobilized and active individuals showed log -linear relationships with temperature (range of 2-20 C) and a thermal coefficient Q10 \& AP;2 was found. The maximum respiration rate of swimming females was 7.8 and 6.4 times higher than that of immobilized in-dividuals at 2 and 20 C, respectively. To better understand how temperature affects the energy efficiency of copepod swimming, the mechanical energy of movement was estimated from sswimming speed and the meta-bolic energy was estimated from the amount of oxygen consumed during swimming. Linear relationships be-tween swimming speed and mechanical and metabolic energy, respectively, were found at all experimental temperatures. At 20 C, the maximum mechanical and metabolic energy costs for movement was 15.2 x 10-5 and 37.7 x 10-4 J h-1, respectively. In the range of 2-20 C, the mechanical energy attributed to swimming represented only a small portion (4.0-8.2\%) of the total metabolic energy. Cold-water specialization probably limited the increase of the swimming speed of C. vicinus at high temperatures compared to that of warm-water adapted species.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103320,109,NA,NA,103320,Cyclopidae; Kinematic of jumps; Oxygen consumption; Energetic cost of swimming; Thermal effect
article,Evaluation of the feasibility of using skin temperature to predict overall thermal sensation in non-uniform thermal environments,"Wang, Yuemei and Chang, Haoyu and Lian, Zhiwei",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Skin temperature is an important physiological parameter that reflects human thermal sensation. However, it is uncertain whether it can evaluate overall thermal sensation in non-uniform thermal environments. This study aims to explore the feasibility of using skin temperature to predict overall thermal sensation in non-uniform environments. The overall thermal sensation votes and skin temperatures were obtained in a non-uniform thermal environment with local cooling on the chest in a climate chamber. The predictive power of the representative skin temperature (RST) estimated from five different methods was examined by analysing its sensitivity and the correlation between the overall thermal sensation and the RST. The RSTs estimated from the 7-point method with the measurement site of trunk assigned on the chest and the 1-point method with a measurement site at the centre of the chest had high sensitivity and coefficients of determination. They could reflect overall thermal sensation in the non-uniform environments with local cooling on the chest. The results imply that skin temperature could be used to evaluate overall thermal sensation in non-uniform environments. The overall thermal sensation in non-uniform environments can be evaluated by the RST if, when determining the RST, the measuring site exposed to local cooling is involved and given a high weight.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103254,106,NA,NA,103254,Non-uniform thermal environment; Skin temperature; Thermal sensation
article,Thermal ecology of Northern Water Snakes (<i>Nerodia sipedon</i>) in a northern wetland in central Michigan,"Rowe, John W. and Goerge, Tyler M. and Martin, Chelsea E. and Mulligan, William P.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Semi-aquatic north-temperate reptiles experience challenging environmental conditions for thermoregulation on both seasonal and daily bases. We studied the thermal biology of north-temperate Northern Water Snakes (Nerodia sipedon) in central Michigan by remote radiotelemetry monitoring of snake body temperature (T-b) using surgically implanted thermally-sensitive radio-transmitters and by measuring operative temperatures (T-e) across a range of microhabitats using biophysical models. Our goals included evaluation of thermoregulatory capabilities at a locality that we viewed to be a fine-grained thermal environment, seasonal variations in patterns of thermoregulation, and the effects of sex on thermoregulation. During summer, snakes showed diel T-b cycling apparently using the open Sphagnum mat for late morning warming and shuttling among different microhabitats until early evening when a monotonic decline in T-b ensued and continued through the early morning hours. Snakes attained T-b within their laboratory-determined preferred body temperature range (T-set = 28-33 degrees C) mostly during late afternoon and with average percentages of T-b values for individual snakes within T-set range when permitted by operative temperatures (E-x) between 68 and 70\% of the time depending on method of measurement. Relatively high investment in thermoregulation when thermal conditions were poor occurred only during September but declined thereafter as snakes prepared to overwinter. We did not detect differences in thermoregulation among reproductive females, non-reproductive females, and males. Relative to a population of N. sipedon at a higher latitude in Ontario our snakes showed a relatively high T-set range and thermoregulated more effectively, particularly during the daylight hours. It remains unclear how much inter-population variation in thermoregulation is due to potential adaptations to latitude, to habitat differences, or variations in methodologies.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103204,105,NA,NA,103204,Thermoregulation; Snakes; Nerodia
article,"Seasonal changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics and physiological performance of the bluegill sunfish, Lepomis macrochirus, from a shallow, Midwest river","Lamptey, I, Derick and Sparks, Ryan W. and De Oca, Rolando Monte and Skolik, Robert and Menze, Michael A. and Martinez, Eloy",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"As global temperature shifts due to anthropogenic impacts, seasonal temperatures in shallow aquatic ecosystems are expected to increase. Previous studies on freshwater fishes that experience significant temperature changes during the annual seasons found pronounced physiological restructuring not observed in animals inhabiting more thermally stable environments. Studies evaluating mitochondrial bioenergetics in fish are often performed on animals acclimated to constant temperatures in the laboratory. However, natural habitats are much more complex. Fishes may experience substantial daily and seasonal variation in temperature, energy requirements and resource availability, which are impossible to emulate on acclimation studies. Our study explores the effects of these more complex natural environments on whole-organism thermal tolerance and mitochondrial bio-energetics in bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus), a native fish to the temperate zone of North America. Compensatory mechanisms and variations in physiological thresholds were observed in specimens acclimatized to the fall season compared to specimens acclimatized to spring and summer seasons. Somatic indices, such as relative weights and hepatosomatic indices, showed significant differences across seasons and critical thermal maxima significantly decreased in the cold acclimatized specimens. Liver mitochondria from L. macrochirus also showed significantly higher uncoupled proton conductance, cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity, and reduced respiratory control ratios in individuals sampled in the colder season. These findings suggest that mechanisms regulating proton conductance and COX activity modulate mitochondrial function across seasons to sustain physiological fitness in ectotherms inhabiting shallow, inland aquatic habitats.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103186,104,NA,NA,103186,COX4; Thermal stress; Respiration; OXPHOS; Sunfish; Mitochondria
article,"Incubating green turtle (<i>Chelonia mydas</i>) eggs at constant temperatures: Hatching success, hatchling morphology and post-hatch growth","Yao, Yun-Tao and Du, Yu and Pan, Jia-Xin and Lin, Chi-Xian and Ji, Xiang and You, Wen-Hui",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Past studies applying constant-temperature incubation of eggs have involved all species of sea turtles, but rarely can we find a single one incubating eggs at three or more temperatures. Here, we incubated green turtle (Chelonia mydas) eggs from Ganquan Island, South China Sea, at five constant temperatures (26, 28, 30, 32 and 34 degrees C) to determine hatching success, incubation length and hatchling phenotype at each test temperature and temperatures optimal for embryonic development. Temperature affected hatching success, incubation length and all seven examined hatchlings traits, and clutch origin affected three (head length, fore-flipper length and hind flipper length) of the seven. Hatching success was lowest at 34 degrees C and none of hatchlings hatched at this temperature was normal and survived over one week. The rate of embryonic development and the rate of post-hatch growth both were lowest at 26 degrees C. Given that low survival and growth rates can translate into reduced individual fitness, we conclude that both 26 degrees C and 34 degrees C are unsuitable for incubation of C. mydas eggs. Post-hatch growth was fastest in hatchlings incubated at 30 degrees C, and eggs of C. mydas incubated at temperatures around 30 degrees C are more likely to produce mixed sexes. Accordingly, we conclude that temperatures within the range from 28 degrees C to 32 degrees C are generally optimal for embryonic development of C. mydas.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103182,104,NA,NA,103182,Embryonic thermosensitivity; Ganquan island; Hatching; Hatchling phenotype; Incubation; Sea turtle
article,Developmental temperature affects thermal dependence of locomotor activity in <i>Drosophila</i>,"Klepsatel, Peter and Galikova, Martina",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In their natural environments, animals have to cope with fluctuations in numerous abiotic and biotic factors, and phenotypic plasticity can facilitate survival under such variable conditions. However, organisms may differ substantially in the ability to adjust their phenotypes in response to external factors. Here, we investigated how developmental temperature affects the thermal performance curve for locomotor activity in adult fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster). We examined the thermal dependence of spontaneous activity in individuals originating from two natural populations (from tropical (India) and temperate climate zone (Slovakia)) that developed at three different temperatures (19 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 29 degrees C). Firstly, we found that developmental temperature has a significant impact on overall activity - flies that developed at high temperature (29 degrees C) were, on average, less active than individuals that developed at lower temperatures. Secondly, developmental acclimation had a population-specific effect on the thermal optimum for activity. Whereas the optimal temperature was not affected by thermal conditions experienced during development in flies from India, developmental temperature shifted thermal optimum in flies from Slovakia. Thirdly, high developmental temperature broadened performance breadth in flies from the Indian population but narrowed it in individuals from the Slovak population. Finally, we did not detect a consistent effect of acclimation temperature on circadian rhythms of spontaneous activity. Altogether, our results demonstrate that developmental temperature can alter different parameters (maximum performance, thermal optimum, performance breadth) of the thermal performance curve for spontaneous activity. Since adult fruit flies are highly vagile, this sensitivity of locomotion to developmental conditions may be an important factor affecting fitness in changing environments.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103153,103,NA,NA,103153,Thermal performance curve; Acclimation; Optimal temperature; Performance breadth; Developmental plasticity; Locomotion
article,Tolerance to high temperature by arboreal mammals using nest boxes in southern Australia,"Goldingay, Ross L. and Thomas, Karen J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Nest boxes are used to manage populations of tree-cavity dependent birds and mammals. Concerns have been raised that due to their poor insulative properties nest boxes may cause heat stress and occasionally death during summers of extreme maximum temperatures. Our study investigated whether this nest box heat stress hypothesis applies to two small cavity-dependent mammals (brush-tailed phascogales and sugar gliders). Focusing on days when ambient temperature reached >= 40 degrees C, we recorded: i) temperatures within occupied nest boxes, ii) temperatures within nearby unoccupied tree cavities, iii) the duration of temperatures of >= 40 degrees C within nest boxes, iv) whether direct mortality was observed, and v) the relative abundance of these species in nest boxes before and after a very hot summer. When ambient temperature reached >= 40 degrees C, nest boxes were equivalent to ambient or 1-2 degrees C cooler, whereas tree cavities were 3-7 degrees C cooler than ambient. Exposure in nest boxes to temperatures of >= 40 degrees C lasted an average of 2-8 h. We observed no mortality over 65 records of phascogales and 31 records of gliders in nest boxes on days when ambient reached >= 40 degrees C. No decline in abundance was recorded after a summer with 11 days of temperatures >= 40 degrees C, with each species subsequently occupying >40 nest boxes. Our observations suggest these species are tolerant of the high temperatures that occurred. Nonetheless, provision of nest boxes designed to minimise summer heating is recommended.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102899,98,NA,NA,102899,Heat stress; Phascogale; Petaurus

These effects may be aggravated by climate change. Stress responses to nonspecific systemic actions lead to perturbation of molecular pathways in the organism. The molecular response is regulated in a dynamic and synchronized manner that assurances robustness and flexibility for the restoration of functional and structural homeostasis in stressed cells and tissues. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are micro molecules of small non-coding RNA that control gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Recently, various studies have discovered precise types of miRNA that regulate cellular machinery and homeostasis under various types of stress, suggesting a significant role of miRNA in thermal stress responses in animals. The miRNAs revealed in this paper could serve as promising candidates and biomarkers for heat stress and could be used as potential pharmacological targets for mitigating the consequences of thermal stress. Stress miRNA pathways may be associated with thermal stress, which offers some potential approaches to combat the negative impacts of thermal stress in livestock. The review provides new data that can assist the elucidation of the miRNA mechanisms that mediate animals? responses to thermal stress.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102859,96,NA,NA,102859,Thermal stress; Livestock; microRNA
article,Changing of haemostatic system in a pig model during different types of hypothermic circulatory arrest,Li Lei and Guan Xinliang and Gong Ming and Wang Xiaolong and Liu Yuyong and Liu Yang and Wu Zining and Lan Feng and Li Haiyang and Zhang Hongjia,JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Background: Hypothermic circulatory arrest is usually used in aortic surgery, congenital heart defect repairs and other complex surgeries. It is frequently associated with excessive postoperative bleeding and the transfusion of allogeneic blood products. The physiopathology of hypothermic circulatory arrest-induced coagulopathy has never been systematically studied. The aim of the study was to investigate this phenomenon in a pig model. Methods: Ten pigs were randomly assigned to 30 min of hypothermic circulatory arrest at either 15 degrees C (n = 5) or 25 degrees C (n = 5). Detection of apoptosis and haemostatic system assays were performed in this experiment. Enzymelinked immunosorbent assays were performed at ten time points in each group to study the changes in the coagulation system in hypothermic circulatory arrest. All of the statistical analyses were performed in SPSS software, version 18.0, and as bilateral tests, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: There was no significant difference in the effect of different types of hypothermic circulatory arrest on routine laboratory tests and tissue sample analysis (p > 0.05, for all). Our results demonstrated that more severe systemic activation of the coagulation system (TAT and F1+2) was applied in the deep hypothermic circulatory arrest group but not in the moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest group (TAT/p = 0.01, F1+2/p = 0.03). However, this activation of the coagulation system (AT III and PC) was not associated with changes in the anticoagulation pathway (AT III/p = 0.24, PC/p = 0.33). In addition, analysis of biomarkers of the haemostatic system revealed that the consumption of coagulation is more concentrated on extrinsic coagulation factors (FVII/p = 0.01). Conclusions: Moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest is more suitable for patients with coagulation dysfunction. We believe the application of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest should pay more attention to changes in coagulation rather than the anticoagulation pathway. Extrinsic coagulation factor supplementation is more effective after deep hypothermic circulatory arrest.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102817,95,NA,NA,102817,Haemostatic system; Cardiopulmonary bypass; Hypothermic circulatory arrest; Aortic dissection; Extrinsic coagulation factor
article,Validation of ThermoHuman automatic thermographic software for assessing foot temperature before and after running,"Requena-Bueno, Lara and Priego-Quesada, Jose Ignacio and Jimenez-Perez, Irene and Gil-Calvo, Marina and Perez-Soriano, Pedro",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The aim of the study was to evaluate an automatic thermographic software package (ThermoHuman (R)) for assessing skin temperature on the soles of the feet before and after running and to compare it with two manual definitions of the regions of interest (ROIs). 120 thermal images of the soles of the feet of 30 participants, at two measurement points (before and after running 30 min) and on two measurement days were analyzed. Three different models of thermographic image analyses were used to obtain the mean temperature of 9 ROIs: A) ThermoHuman (automatic definition of ROIs using ThermoHuman (R) software), B) Manual (manual delimitation of ROIs by proportion criteria), and C) Manual-TH (manual delimitation of ROIs in an attempt to replicate the regions analyzed by ThermoHuman). ThermoHuman resulted in an 86\% reduction in time involved compared to manual delimitation. Fourteen of the 120 images (12\%) presented some error in one or more of the ROI delimitations. Although the three procedures presented significant differences between them (53\% in the comparison between ThermoHuman and Manual, 47\% between ThermoHuman and Manual-TH, and 28\% between Manual and Manual-TH), all differences had a small effect size (ES 0.2-0.4) or lower (ES < 0.2). Bland-Altman plots showed similar 95\% limits of agreement between the three procedures before and after running. Intraclass correlation coefficient analysis of the three procedures presented excellent reliability (ICC>0.8). In conclusion, ThermoHuman (R) software was observed to be time-saving for image analysis with excellent reliability. Although results suggest that ThermoHuman (R) and manual methods are both valid in themselves, combining them is not recommended due to the differences observed between them.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102639,92,NA,NA,102639,Infrared thermography; Thermal image; Feet; Exercise; Analysis
article,"Temperature tolerance and oxygen consumption of two South American tetras, <i>Paracheirodon innessi</i> and <i>Hyphessobrycon herbertaxelrodi</i>","Cooper, Cassidy J. and Mueller, Casey A. and Eme, John",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature is a primary factor affecting species' ability to thrive in a particular ecological niche, but thermal conditions have changed dramatically in recent decades. Fishes shift their thermal tolerance range with a maximum and minimum temperature correlated to their recent thermal acclimation history, and species can show a reduced temperature quotient (Q(10)) following chronic thermal acclimation. Neon tetra (Paracheirodon innesi) and Black Neon tetra (Hyphessobrycon herbertaxelrodi) are popular hobbyist aquarium fishes, and both species are examples of freshwater teleosts native to South American river systems that are potentially affected by changing thermal conditions. We acclimated these species to three different constant temperatures (26 degrees C, 29 degrees C, and 31 degrees C) for 15.4 +/- 2.1 days, then measured acute critical thermal maxima (CTMax) and acute oxygen consumption rate (Mo-2) at each acclimation temperature. We also estimated chronic lethal thermal maximum (CLT) for both species following a 2-week acclimation to 30.4 degrees C. Mean CTMax of both species were found to increase with acclimation temperature from 38.5 to 39.6 degrees C for Neon tetra and from 39.5 to 41.0 degrees C for Black Neon tetra, gaining 0.24 (Neon tetra) or 0.29 degrees C (Black Neon tetra) of tolerance per 1 degrees C of acclimation. However, Black Neon tetra demonstrated consistently higher CTMax (1.0-1.4 degrees C). CLT was lower for Neon tetra (33.5 degrees C), compared to Black Neon tetra (35.9 degrees C). Mean Mo-2 were statistically similar across acclimation temperatures within species; Q(10) between 26-31 degrees C were 1.92 and 1.22 for Neon and Black Neon tetra, respectively. Neon and Black Neon tetras physiologically acclimated to changing thermal demands, and although they demonstrate robust CTMax responses, CLT responses indicated both species are unable to survive temperatures 4-5 degrees C above current average natural values. The demonstrated metabolic plasticity and CTMax values provide a moderate cushion for both species to combat changing temperatures due to climate change, but CLT values suggest vulnerability to projected climate trends.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102434,86,NA,NA,102434,Acclimation; South America; Climate change; Critical thermal tolerance; Fish; Metabolism
article,Impact of natural resource extraction on thermal properties of wood turtle (<i>Glyptemys insculpta</i>) habitat,"Hughes, Geoffrey N. and Litzgus, Jacqueline D.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"One of the main threats to freshwater turtle populations is habitat destruction, which occurs as a result of human activities such as infrastructure development, forestry, aggregate extraction, and agriculture. However, the impacts of these activities on thermoregulatory opportunities for turtles are not well understood. We examined the impacts of forestry and aggregate extraction on thermal characteristics of wood turtle (Glyptemys insculpta) habitat in the Sudbury District, Ontario, by measuring the differences in absolute temperature, thermal landscape structure, and habitat thermal quality among relatively undisturbed sites (N = 2), harvested forestry sites (N = 2), and aggregate pits (N = 2) in 2015. We also tested the potential use of the thermal landscape concept as a predictor of habitat thermal quality. Undisturbed habitats were of higher thermal quality than impacted sites in terms of temperatures experienced in situ by wild wood turtles in their natural home ranges, and never reached temperatures that would be injurious to turtles (i.e., below CTMIN or above CTMAX). The undisturbed sites were of lower quality in terms of optimal temperatures (i.e., T-set) and were generally cooler and their temperatures less variable than those in impacted habitats. The thermal landscape concept provided a useful predictor of habitat thermal quality when the influence of time of day was factored into the predictive model. Our data are important to the conservation and management of wood turtles because they provide a preliminary quantification of the thermal impacts of natural resource extraction on the habitat of an endangered species, and can guide the development of mitigation and rehabilitation plans by providing measures of, and targets for, thermal habitat quality.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.031,84,NA,469-478,NA,Aggregates; Forestry; Habitat; Species at risk; T-set; Temperature; Thermal landscape
article,Contrasting thermal strategies of montane Neotropical bats at high elevations,"Garin, I. and Chaverri, G. and Jimenez, L. and Castillo-Salazar, C. and Aihartza, J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In the Neotropics, captive vespertilionid bats substantially reduce their metabolic rate at low ambient temperatures, similar to their temperate counterparts, whereas the ability of phyllostomids to lower metabolic rate seems to be more limited, even in mountain species. Nevertheless, field data on the thermal behaviour of syntopic individuals from these two families is lacking. Consequently, we aimed to test whether torpor was more common and deeper in vesper bats compared to leaf-nosed bats by studying skin temperature (Tsk) variation in individuals experiencing the same environmental conditions at a mountain area. Bats experienced ambient temperatures below 15 degrees C. Average Tsk was 10 degrees C in Myotis oxyotus gardneri (Vespertilionidae) during the day, while Sturnira burtonlimi (Phyllostomidae) regulated diurnal Tsk above 30 degrees C. Constant food availability may explain why diurnal Sturnira burtonlimi pay the high energetic cost required to remain normothermic and to defend a wide Ta-Tsk gap but further studies are needed to elucidate additional strategies that may be employed by these bats to reduce the energetic demands of normothermy. Our study shows that the contrasting thermal strategies and torpor use adopted by vespertilionid insectivores and phyllostomid frugivores in captive settings also occur in free-ranging conditions, thus providing a basis to develop further studies with predictions more accurately rooted in field data.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.10.017,78,NA,352-355,NA,Phyllostomidae; Vespertilionidae; Thermal behaviour; Torpor; Skin temperature
article,"<i>In ovo</i> L-leucine administration stimulates lipid metabolisms in heat-exposed male, but not female, chicks to afford thermotolerance","Han, Guofeng and Yang, Hui and Bungo, Takashi and Ikeda, Hiromi and Wang, Yunhao and Nguyen, Linh T. N. and Eltahan, Hatem M. and Furuse, Mitsuhiro and Chowdhury, Vishwajit S.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Thermal manipulation declined embryonic brain and liver concentrations of leucine (Leu). L-Leu in ovo injection afforded thermotolerance in male broiler chicks. This study aimed to examine the role of in ovo injection of L-Leu in metabolic functions, and differences between male and female broiler chicks in thermotolerance. L-Leu injection was performed in ovo on embryonic day (ED) 7 to reveal its role in metabolic activity in embryos and in post-hatch male and female broiler chicks under heat stress. To examine the metabolic activity of embryos, oxygen (O-2) consumption, carbon dioxide (CO2) production, heat production and plasma metabolites were analyzed. Rectal temperature, food intake and plasma metabolites were also analyzed in heat-exposed (35 +/- 1 degrees C for 180 min) male and female broiler chicks. It was found that O-2 consumption, heat production, and plasma triacylglycerol (TG) and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations in ED 14 embryos were significantly increased by in ovo injection of L-Leu in comparison with the controls. Plasma glucose concentration was significantly increased in both male and female chicks under heat stress, but in ovo injection of L-Leu attenuated the increase in male chicks. In contrast, plasma TG, NEFA, and ketone body concentrations were significantly higher in male chicks injected in ovo with L-Leu, but not in similarly injected female chicks, compared with control chicks, all under heat stress. Rectal temperature and food intake were significantly lower in male, but not female, chicks under heat stress injected in ovo with L-Leu. In conclusion, in ovo L-Leu administration enhanced the prenatal metabolic rate and lipid metabolisms, which possibly appeared as sex-dependent fashion to facilitate thermotolerance in males. A reduction in heat production through lowered food intake in heat-exposed male, but not female chicks injected in ovo with L-Leu may help to afford thermotolerance in male broiler chicks under heat stress.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.10.020,71,NA,74-82,NA,L-Leucine; In ovo injection; Lipid metabolism; Thermotolerance; Chicks
article,Effect of the timing of ice slurry ingestion for precooling on endurance exercise capacity in a warm environment,"Takeshima, Keisuke and Onitsuka, Sumire and Zheng Xinyan and Hasegawa, Hiroshi",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"It has been demonstrated that precooling with ice slurry ingestion enhances endurance exercise capacity in the heat. However, no studies have yet evaluated the optimal timing of ice slurry ingestion for precooling. This study aimed to investigate the effects of varying the timing of ice slurry ingestion for precooling on endurance exercise capacity in a warm environment. Ten active male participants completed 3 experimental cycling trials to exhaustion at 55\% peak power output (PPO) after 15 min of warm-up at 30\% PPO at 30 degrees C and 80\% relative humidity. Three experimental conditions were set: no ice slurry ingestion (CON), pre-warm-up ice slurry ingestion (-1 degrees C; 7.5 g kg(-1)) (PRE), and post-warm-up ice slurry ingestion (POST). Rectal and mean skin temperatures at the beginning of exercise in the POST condition (37.1 +/- 0.2 degrees C, 33.8 +/- 0.9 degrees C, respectively) were lower than those in the CON (37.5 +/- 0.3 degrees C; P < 0.001, 34.8 +/- 0.8 degrees C; P < 0.01, respectively) and PRE (37.4 +/- 0.2 degrees C; P <0.01, 34.6 +/- 0.7 degrees C; P <0.01, respectively) conditions. These reductions increased heat storage capacity and resulted in improved exercise capacity in the POST condition (60.2 +/- 8.7 min) compared to that in the CON (52.0 +/- 11.9 min; effect size [}ES]=0.78) and PRE (56.9 +/- 10.4 min; ES=0.34) conditions. Ice slurry ingestion after warm-up effectively reduced both rectal and skin temperatures and increased cycling time to exhaustion in a warm environment.

article,Ecological insights from assessments of phenotypic plasticity in a Neotropical species of <i>Drosophila</i>,"Przybylska, Maria Stefania and de Brito, Felipe Alves and Tidon, Rosana",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Several authors have called attention to the evolutionary importance of phenotypic plasticity and niche construction, because such phenomena require a new status and a new perspective. Drosophila species are traditionally used as models in investigations of phenotypic plasticity, although the majority of such research has been conducted with species of the subgenus Sophophora, primarily Drosophila melanogaster. In this study, we investigated the phenotypic plasticity of Drosophila cardini, a Neotropical species of the subgenus Drosophila, and focused on the wing size, wing shape, thorax length and wing: thorax ratio of lines that were collected in the Brazilian savanna and exposed to different temperatures during growth. All of the analyzed traits presented plasticity to temperature, and the reaction norms were similar to those previously found in other drosophilid species; in addition, the maximum values were consistent with the temperature variations at the collection sites. The specimens that emerged at low temperatures were larger and had more rounded wings compared with those that emerged at high temperatures, which were smaller and had narrower wings. We hypothesized that the differences observed in the shape of the wings might be associated with flight performance. Nevertheless, further investigation of the relationships among wing shape, wing loading and flight performance is required. Investigations on phenotypic plasticity using species with diverse ecologies should help us to better understand how this phenomenon operates in nature, and studies of this type must be encouraged.",2016,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.06.026,62,A,7-14,NA,Flight performance; Growth temperature; Insecta; Morphological traits; Reaction norm; Wing loading
article,Physiological responses of <i>Corythucha ciliata</i> adults to high temperatures under laboratory and field conditions,"Ju, Rui-Ting and Gao, Lei and Zhou, Xu-Hui and Li, Bo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Under high temperature conditions, insects can tolerate to survive through various physiological mechanisms, which have been well documented in laboratory studies. However, it is still unclear as to whether these laboratory data can scale up to those in the field. Here we studied dynamics of heat-induced metabolites in Corythucha ciliata adults under both laboratory and field conditions to examine their significance in thermal tolerance of the species. We compared the effects of controlled thermal treatments (2 h at 33-43 degrees C at 2 degrees C intervals in the laboratory) and naturally increasing thermal conditions (10:00-14:00 at 2-h intervals (33.5-37.2 degrees C) on a hot summer day in a field in Shanghai, China) on water content and levels of water-soluble protein, triglycerides, mannitol, and sorbitol in the adult bodies. The results showed that water content significantly decreased and all other metabolic parameters significantly increased in response to temperature stresses with similar patterns in both the laboratory and field, although the respective threshold temperatures were different under the two conditions. The close linkage observed in the two conditions suggests that a short period of heat stress induces water loss and accumulation of thermal metabolites in C. ciliata adults.

article,"The overwintering biology of the acorn weevil, <i>Curculio glandium</i> in southwestern Ontario","Udaka, Hiroko and Sinclair, Brent J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The acorn weevil, Curculio glandium, is a widespread predator of acorns in eastern North America that overwinters in the soil as a larva. It is possible that low temperatures limit its northern geographic range, so we determined the cold tolerance strategy, seasonal variation in cold tolerance, and explored the physiological plasticity of overwintering larvae. Weevil larvae were collected from acorns of red and bur oak from Pelee Island, southwestern Ontario in fall 2010 and 2011. C. glandium larvae are freeze avoidant and larvae collected from bur oak acorns had lower supercooling points (SCPs: -7.6 +/- 0.36 degrees C, LT50: -7.2 degrees C) than those collected from red oak acorns (SCPs: -6.1 +/- 0.40 degrees C, LT50: -6.1 degrees C). In the winter of 2010-2011, SCPs and water content decreased, however these changes did not occur in 2011-2012, when winter soil temperatures fluctuated greatly in the absence of the buffering effect of snow. To examine whether larvae utilize cryoprotective dehydration, larvae from red oak acorns were exposed to -5 degrees C in the presence of ice for seven days. These conditions decreased the SCP without affecting water content, suggesting that SCP and water content are not directly coupled. Finally, long-term acclimation at 0 degrees C for six weeks slightly increased cold tolerance but also did not affect water content. Thus, although larval diet affects cold tolerance, there is limited plasticity after other treatments. The soil temperatures we observed were not close to lethal limits, although we speculate that soil temperatures in northerly habitats, or in years of reduced snow cover, has the potential to cause mortality in the field.

article,Thermal acclimation of broiler birds by intermittent heat exposure,"Abdelqader, Anas and Al-Fataftah, Abdur-Rahman",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Heat stress impairs the performance of broilers which increases the economic losses. Effect of duration of heat exposure on performance and acclimatory responses in broiler birds was investigated. At 21 d of age 160 Hubbard birds (80 males + 80 females) were equally distributed into 5 treatments (T). The T1, T2, T3 and T4 were acclimated by daily exposure to heat (38 +/- 1 degrees C, 62 +/- 2\% RH) for 1, 2, 3 and 4 h/d, respectively, for 14 d. TO was the non-acclimated control (kept at 22 +/- 2 degrees C, 65 +/- 2\% RH). At 36 d of age the thermotolerance of all birds was evaluated under simulated heat wave conditions by exposing them to an acute heat stress (43 +/- 1 degrees C, 55 +/- 3\% RH) for 4 h. Body weight (BW), average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) were not affected in T2 and T3, while T3 and T4 showed significant reductions in BW, ADG and ADFI compared to the control. Daily changes in ADFI/kg of metabolic BW (ADFI/BW0.75), rectal temperature (Tr), rate of increase in rectal temperature (RITr) and evaporative water loss (EWL) showed biphasic patterns of acclimatory responses. The 2 phases were distinctly differentiated by plateau days. Phase 1 characterized by a sharp decline in ADFI/BW0.75 followed by a gradual increase until the plateau, while Tr, RITr and EWL increased sharply followed by gradual decreases until the plateau. Beyond the plateau (phase 2), homeostatic responses in ADFI/BW0.75, Tr, RITr and EWL were observed toward the end of the study. Acclimated birds were able to withstand the simulated heat wave with 0\% mortality, lower Tr, and longer survival time compared to the control. In conclusion, acclimation could protect birds from acute heat waves and associated heat stress mortality until marketing age. However, applicability of these results towards the industry needs further investigations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Does temperature modify slow and fast development in two aphidophagous ladybirds?,"Singh, Neha and Mishra, Geetanjali and Omkar",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Development within a population is known to vary with abiotic and biotic factors. However, instances of slow and fast development, i.e. different development rates within the same egg batch or cohort, have not yet been rigorously investigated in many organisms. The present study was undertaken to assess the influence of an exogenous cue, temperature (15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C), on slow and fast development and its effect on reproductive attributes in two ladybird species, Menochilus sexmaculatus (Fabricius) and Propylea dissecta (Mulsant) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). A clear bimodal pattern of distribution with two peaks was found at each temperature where the first peak represented the fast developers and the second peak slow developers. Variation in ratio and development of slow and fast developers within a cohort at different temperatures was observed to ascertain whether the phenomenon has a purely genetic basis or is environmentally influenced. The ratio of slow and fast developers in a cohort differed with temperature but not with species. Slow developers showed a female biased sex ratio and low body mass. Fast developing females laid higher numbers of eggs with higher egg viability than slow developing ones. More slow developers were found at low temperature (15 and 20 degrees C), equal numbers at medium temperature (25 degrees C) and less at higher temperature (30 and 35 degrees C). Results of the study are indicative of stability of the slow and fast development in the egg batch and the likelihood that the variation observed at emergence was owing to exogenous cues influenced differential rates of mortality.

article,The upper limit of thermoneutrality is not indicative of thermotolerance in bats,"Welman, Shaun and Breit, Ana M. and Levesque, Danielle L. and Nowack, Julia",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"To assess the vulnerability of birds and mammals to climate change recent studies have used the upper critical limit of thermoneutrality (T-UC) as an indicator of thermal tolerance. But, the association between T-UC and thermal tolerance is not straightforward and most studies describe T-UC based solely on a deviation in metabolism from basal levels, without also considering the onset of evaporative cooling. It was argued recently that certain torpor-using bat species who survived prolonged exposure to high ambient temperatures (i.e. high thermal tolerance) experienced during extreme heat events did so by entering torpor and using facultative heterothermy to thermoconform and save on body water. Assuming that T-UC is indicative of thermal tolerance, we expect T-UC in torpor-using species to be higher than that of species which are obligate homeotherms, albeit that this distinction is based on confirmation of torpor use at low temperatures. To test this prediction, we performed a phylogenetically informed comparison of bat species known to use torpor (n = 48) and homeothermic (n = 16) bat species using published thermoregulatory datasets to compare the lower critical limit of thermoneutrality (T-LC) and T-UC in relation to body temperature. The influence of diet, biogeographical region, body mass and basal metabolic rate (BMR) was also considered. Body mass had a positive relationship with BMR, an inverse relationship with T-LC and no relationship with T-UC. Normothermic body temperature scaled positively with BMR, T-LC and T-UC. There was no relationship between diet or region and BMR, but both influenced thermal limits. Torpor-using bats had lower body mass and body temperatures than homeothermic bats, but there was no difference in BMR, T-LC and T-UC between them. Exceptional examples of physiological flexibility were observed in 34 torpor-using species and eight homeothermic species, which included 15 species of bats maintaining BMR-level metabolism at ambient temperatures as high as 40 degrees C (and corresponding body temperatures similar to 39.2 degrees C). However, we argue that T-UC based on metabolism alone is not an appropriate indicator of thermal tolerance as it disregards differences in the ability of animals to tolerate higher levels of hyperthermia, importance of hydration status and capacity for evaporative cooling. Also, the variability in T-UC based on diet challenges the idea of evolutionary conservatism and warrants further consideration.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103933,124,NA,NA,103933,Heat stress; Torpor; Evaporative cooling; Diet; Global warming; Mammals
article,"Behavioral responses during sickness in amphibians and reptiles: Concepts, experimental design, and implications for field studies","Cabanzo-Olarte, Laura Camila and Bicego, Kenia Cardoso and Iannini, Carlos Arturo Navas",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In ectothermic vertebrates, behavioral fever, where an individual actively seeks warmer areas, seems to be a primary response to pathogens. This is considered a broad and evolutionarily conserved response among vertebrates. Recent population declines in amphibians are associated with an increase of infectious disease driven largely by climate change, habitat degradation, and pollution. Immediate action through research is required to better understand and inform conservation efforts. The literature available, does not provide unifying concepts that can guide adequate experimental protocols and interpretation of data, especially when studying animals in the field. The aim of this review is to promote common understanding of terminology and facilitating improved comprehension and application of key concepts about the occurrence of both sickness behavior or behavioral fever in ectothermic vertebrates. We start with a conceptual synthesis of sickness behavior and behavioral fever, with examples in different taxa. Through this discussion we present possible paths to standardize terminology, starting from original use in endothermic tetrapods which was expanded to ectothermic vertebrates, particularly amphibians and reptiles. This conceptual expansion from humans (endothermic vertebrates) and then to ectothermic counterparts, gravitates around the concept of `normality'. Thus, following this discussion, we highlight caveats with experimental protocols and state the need of a reference value considered normal (RVCN), which is different from experimental control and make recommendations regarding experimental procedures and stress the value of detailed documentation of behavioral responses. We also propose some future directions that could enhance interaction among disciplines, emphasizing relationships at different levels of biological organization. This is crucial given the increasing convergence of fields such as thermal physiology, immunology, and animal behavior due to emerging diseases and other global crises impacting biodiversity.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103889,123,NA,NA,103889,Amphibian; Disease; Fever; Squamata; Thermoregulation
article,Intra and interspecific variation in thermal performance and critical limits in anurans from southern Chile,"Vidal, Marcela A. and Rezende, Enrico L. and Bacigalupe, Leonardo D.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The relationship between temperature and performance can be illustrated through a thermal performance curve (TPC), which has proven useful in describing various aspects of ectotherms' thermal ecology and evolution. The parameters of the TPC can vary geographically due to large-scale variations in environmental conditions. However, only some studies have attempted to quantify how thermal performance varies over relatively small spatial scales, even in the same location or consistently among individuals within a species. Here, we quantified individual and species variation in thermal sensitivity of locomotor performance in five amphibia Eupsophus species found in the temperate rainforests of southern Chile and compared their estimates against co-occurring species that exhibit a substantially more extensive distributional range. We measured critical thermal limits and jumping performance under five different temperatures. Our results suggest that thermal responses are relatively conserved along the phylogeny, as the locomotor performance and thermal windows for activity remained narrow in Eupsophus species when compared against results observed for Batrachyla taeniata and Rhinella spinulosa. Additionally, we found significant individual differences in locomotor performance within most species, with individual consistency in performance observed across varied temperatures. Further analyses explored the influence of body size on locomotor performance and critical thermal limits within and between species. Our results suggest a trade-off scenario between thermal tolerance breadth and locomotor performance, where species exhibiting broader thermal ranges might have compromised performance. Interestingly, these traits seem partly mediated by body size variations, raising questions about potential ecological implications.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103851,121,NA,NA,103851,Critical thermal limits; Individual variation; Locomotor performance; Latitudinal gradient; Thermal performance curve

Though the effects of climate change is widely anticipated in the diverse but fragile ecosystem of the Himalayas, very less research has been conducted on the indoor environment of the buildings in these regions. In this study, a pre-validated model of 3storey concrete residential building was used to study the indoor performance and thermal comfort in the face of climate change in the 8 (eight) different hill towns (hill stations) located from west to the east. Rise in ambient and indoor conditions were evident as a part of climate change with colder locations being affected the most. The thermal comfort assessment using both the climate chamber based PMV model and adaptive models revealed the decrease in cold related discomfort and increase in hot related discomfort. On an overall, the indoor conditions improved in these cold locations. The indoor and outdoor thermal condition and thermal comfort plummeted significantly with latitude and elevation. The heating demand in the future climate reduced by about 50-70 \% in warmer locations, while the cooling demand increased by as much as 1000-2000 \% in cold locations, respectively. Additionally, it was seen that the thermal environment and comfort both declined more rapidly with elevation in the locations lying in the western Himalayas as compared to those in the eastern Himalayas.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103809,120,NA,NA,103809,Thermal comfort; Indoor environment; Climate change; Himalayas; Cold climate
article,A single rapid heat stress episode does not result in prolonged elevations in salivary cortisol and C-reactive protein production in firefighters,"Coehoorn, Cory J. and Cruz, Diana and Mueller, Schaefer and Kamberov, Lilly Anne D. and Danzy, Jillian and Bouchereau-Lal, Naina and Poole, Daniel and Adams, Aaron",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In the present experiment, we evaluated the impact of rapid heat stress (RHS) on salivary cortisol and C-reactive protein production pre-RHS, post-RHS, and 24 and 48 h post-RHS exposure among firefighters. Previous research has demonstrated that RHS increases salivary cortisol during RHS and immediately post-RHS exposure. However, no research has evaluated the duration necessary to return to baseline cortisol levels following RHS. Additionally, no studies have analyzed the impact of RHS on inflammatory biomarkers, such as C-reactive protein. This study hypothesized that salivary cortisol and C-reactive protein levels would increase following RHS and then return to pre-RHS levels within 24 h post-exposure. Twenty-four participants performed a steady-state treadmill protocol in an environmental chamber (35 degrees C; 45\% humidity) in full firefighter personal protective equipment until reaching either a core temperature (T-c) of 39 degrees C or a volitional maximum. The subjects had their saliva collected via the passive drool protocol pre-RHS, post-RHS, and 24 and 48 h post-RHS. Pre-RHS of 0.23 +/- 0.03 mu g/dL increased post-RHS to 0.51 +/- 0.06 mu g/dL (p < 0.001). This finding supports previous literature demonstrating the immediate impact of RHS. There were no changes in C-reactive protein. The novel finding of this study is that salivary cortisol levels return to baseline in the 24 h post-RHS exposure. This indicates that 24 h is recommended to recover from RHS and should be applied to prevent the chronic stress response.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103805,119,NA,NA,103805,Heat stress; Firefighting; Stress; Hyperthermia; Cortisol; Saliva

A complete understanding of the heat transfer process and the associated thermal and mechanical effects on the patient's skin tissues is critical to ensuring the effective applications of thermal therapy techniques and procedures. The surface boundary of the half-space undergoes a heat flux characterized by an exponentially decaying pulse, while maintaining a condition of zero traction. The utilization of Laplace and Fourier transformations is employed, and the resulting formulations are then applied to human tissues undergoing regional hyperthermia treatment for cancer therapy. To perform the inversion process for Laplace and Fourier transforms, a numerical programming method based on Stehfest numerical inverse method is employed. The findings demonstrate that blood perfusion rate and thermal relaxation time significantly influence all the analyzed distributions. Numerical findings suggest that thermo-mechanical waves propagate through skin tissue over finite distances, which helps mitigate the unrealistic predictions made by the Pennes' model.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103777,119,NA,NA,103777,Analytical solutions; Thermomechanical interactions; Two-dimensional skin tissue; Laplace; fourier transformations; Numerical programming; Thermal relaxation time

article,Thermal compensation reduces DNA damage from UV radiation,"Hird, Coen and Cramp, Rebecca L. and Franklin, Craig E.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Increases in ultraviolet radiation (UVR) correlate spatially and temporally with global amphibian population declines and interact with other stressors such as disease and temperature. Declines have largely occurred in high-altitude areas associated with greater UVR and cooler temperatures. UVR is a powerful mutagenic harming organisms largely by damaging DNA. When acutely exposed to UVR at cool temperatures, amphibian larvae have increased levels of DNA damage. Amphibians may compensate for the depressive effects of temperature on DNA damage through acclimatisation, but it is unknown whether they have this capacity. We reared striped marsh frog larvae (Limnodynastes peronii) in warm (25 degrees C) and cool (15 degrees C) temperatures under a low or moderate daily dose of UVR (10 and 40 mu W cm-2 UV-B for 1 h at midday, respectively) for 18-20 days and then measured DNA damage resulting from an acute high UVR dose (80 mu W cm-2 UV-B for 1.5 h) at a range of temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 degrees C). Larvae acclimated to 15 degrees C and exposed to UVR at 15 degrees C completely compensated UVRinduced DNA damage compared with 25 degrees C acclimated larvae exposed to UVR at 25 degrees C. Additionally, warmacclimated larvae had higher DNA damage than cold-acclimated larvae across test temperatures, which indicated a cost of living in warmer temperatures. Larvae reared under elevated UVR levels showed no evidence of UVR acclimation resulting in lower DNA damage following high UVR exposure. Our finding that thermal acclimation in L. peronii larvae compensated UVR-induced DNA damage at low temperatures suggested that aquatic ectotherms living in cool temperatures may be more resilient to high UVR than previously realised. We suggested individuals or species with less capacity for thermal acclimation of DNA repair mechanisms may be more at risk if exposed to changing thermal and UVR exposure regimes.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103711,117,NA,NA,103711,Active plasticity; Amphibian declines; DNA repair; Ecophysiology; Temperature acclimation
article,Greater post-exercise hypotension in healthy young untrained men after exercising in a hot compared to a temperate environment,"Horiuchi, Masahiro and Oliver, Samuel J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"This research examined the effects of exercising in a hot compared to a temperate environment on post-exercise hemodynamics in untrained men. We hypothesized exercise in a hot compared to a temperate environment would elicit greater post-exercise hypotension, and this would be attributable to higher cutaneous vascular conductance and sweat loss, and lower heart rate variability (HRV) and cardiac baroreflex sensitivity (cBRS). In a randomized counterbalanced order, 12 untrained healthy men completed two trials involving 40-min leg-cycling exercise at either 23 C (CON) or 35 C (HOT). Post-exercise participants rested supine for 60 min at 23 C whilst hemodynamic and thermoregulatory measurements were assessed. Post-exercise hypotension was greater after exercising in a hot than a temperate environment as indicated by a lower mean arterial pressure at 60 min recovery (CON 83 +/- 5 mmHg, HOT 78 +/- 5 mmHg, Mean difference [}95\% confidence interval], -5 {[}-8, -3] mmHg). Throughout recovery, cutaneous vascular conductance was higher, and cBRS and HRV were lower after exercising in a hot than in a temperate environment (P < 0.05). Sweat loss was greater on HOT than on CON (P < 0.001). Post-exercise hypotension after exercising in the hot environment was associated with sweat loss (r = 0.66, P = 0.02), and changes in cutaneous vascular conductance (r = 0.64, P = 0.03), and HRV (Root mean square of the successive difference in R-R interval {[}RMSSD]) r=0.75, P = 0.01 and and log high frequency {[}HF] r=0.66, P = 0.02), but not cBRS (all, r <= 0.2, P > 0.05).

Taurine is one of the most abundant free amino acids in mammals which has antiinflammatory properties. This study aimed to explore the effect of taurine pretreatment on heat stress-induced mammary epithelial integrity disruption and inflammatory damage. In our first experiment on dairy cows our results showed that compared with animals under autumn thermoneutral condition (THI = 62.99 \& PLUSMN; 0.71), summer heat stress (THI = 78.01 \& PLUSMN; 0.39) significantly reduced milk yield and disrupted mammary epithelial integrity as revealed by increased concentrations of serotonin and lactose in plasma, and increased levels of SA and Na+/K+ in milk. In our second study, 36 lactating mice were randomly divided into three groups (n = 12) for a 9d experiment using a climate chamber to establish a heat stress model. Our findings suggest taurine pretreatment could attenuate heat stress-induced mammary histopathological impairment, inflammation response, and enhance mammary epithelium integrity, which was mainly achieved by promoting the secretion of ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-3 through inhibiting activation of the ERK1/2-MLCK signaling pathway in the mammary gland. Overall, our findings indicated that heat stress induced mammary epithelium dysfunction in dairy cows, and emphasized the protective effect of taurine on mammary health under heat stress conditions using a mouse model, which may be achieved by alleviating the mammary epithelium integrity damage and inflammation response.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103587,116,NA,NA,103587,Heat stress; Taurine; ERK1; 2-MLCK; Mammary epithelium; Dairy cow

G. and Crezee, J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Introduction: Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is an ablation modality that applies short, high-voltage electric pulses to unresectable cancers. Although considered a non-thermal technique, temperatures do increase during IRE. This temperature rise sensitizes tumor cells for electroporation as well as inducing partial direct thermal ablation. Aim: To evaluate the extent to which mild and moderate hyperthermia enhance electroporation effects, and to establish and validate in a pilot study cell viability models (CVM) as function of both electroporation parameters and temperature in a relevant pancreatic cancer cell line. Methods: Several IRE-protocols were applied at different well-controlled temperature levels (37 degrees C \& LE; T \& LE; 46 degrees C) to evaluate temperature dependent cell viability at enhanced temperatures in comparison to cell viability at T = 37 degrees C. A realistic sigmoid CVM function was used based on thermal damage probability with Arrhenius Equation and cumulative equivalent minutes at 43 degrees C (CEM43 degrees C) as arguments, and fitted to the experimental data using ``Non-linear-least-squares{''}-analysis. Results: Mild (40 degrees C) and moderate (46 degrees C) hyperthermic temperatures boosted cell ablation with up to 30\% and 95\%, respectively, mainly around the IRE threshold Eth,50\% electric-field strength that results in 50\% cell viability. The CVM was successfully fitted to the experimental data.

Power and phase data of 93 treatments of 20 head and neck patients treated with the HYPERcollar3D applicator were used. The impact on predicted median temperature T50 inside the target region was analysed with maximum allowed temperature of 44 degrees C in healthy tissue. The robustness of predicted T50 for the three models against the influence of blood perfusion, thermal conductivity and the assumed hotspot temperature level was analysed.Results: We found an average predicted T50 of 41.0 \& PLUSMN; 1.3 degrees C (constant baseline model), 39.9 \& PLUSMN; 1.1 degrees C (constant thermal stress model) and 41.7 \& PLUSMN; 1.1 degrees C (temperature dependent model). The constant thermal stress model resulted in the best agreement between the predicted power (P = 132.7 \& PLUSMN; 45.9 W) and the average power measured during the hyperthermia treatments (P = 129.1 \& PLUSMN; 83.0 W).Conclusion: The temperature dependent model predicts an unrealistically high T50. The power values for the constant thermal stress model, after scaling simulated maximum temperatures to 44 degrees C, matched best to the average measured powers. We consider this model to be the most appropriate for temperature predictions using the HYPERcollar3D applicator, however further studies are necessary for developing of robust temperature model for tissues during heat stress.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103625,115,NA,NA,103625,Hyperthermia; Temperature prediction; Head and neck

The body model preserves the geometric shapes of 13 organs and tissues, including skin, muscles, fat, bones, heart, lungs, brain, bladder, intestines, stomach, kidneys, liver, and eyes. Heat balance within the body is described by the bio-heat transfer equation. Heat exchange at the skin surface includes conduction, convection, radiation, and sweat evaporation. Vasodilation, vasoconstriction, sweating, and shiv-ering are controlled by afferent and efferent signals to and from the skin and hypothalamus.Results: the model was validated with measured physiological data during exercise and rest in thermoneutral, hot, and cold conditions. Validations show the model predicted the core temperature (rectal and tympanic temperatures) and mean skin temperatures with acceptable accuracy (within 0.5 degrees C and 1.6 degrees C, respectively)Conclusion: this female FETM predicted high spatial resolution temperature distribution across the female body, which provides quantitative insights into human thermoregulatory responses in females to non-uniform and transient environmental exposure.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103477,113,NA,NA,103477,Bio-heat transfer; Simulation; Heat strain; Finite element method; Control of body temperature; Thermal physiology

We evaluated the thermoregulatory patterns of Massese ewes and identified the changes due to environmental variations. Data was collected from 159 healthy ewes from herds of four farms/institutions. For thermal environmental characterization, air tem-perature (AT), relative humidity (RH) and wind speed were measured, and Black Globe Temperature, Humidity Index (BGHI) and Radiant Heat Load (RHL) were calculated. The thermoregulatory responses evaluated were: respiratory (RR), heart rate (HR), rectal temperature (RT) and coat surface temperature (ST). All variables were subjected to analysis of variance with repeated measures over time. A factor analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between environmental and thermoregulatory variables. Multiple regression analyses were also examined using General Linear Models, and Variance Inflation Factors were calculated. Logistic and Broken line non-linear regressions for RR, HR and RT were analyzed. The RR and HR values were outside reference values and associated with normal values of RT. In the factor analysis, most environmental variables were seen to affect the thermoregulation pattern of the ewes, except for RH. In the logistic regression analysis, RT was not affected by any of the variables studied, maybe because BGHI and RHL were not sufficiently high enough. Nevertheless, BGHI and RHL affected RR and HR.

In intensive shrimp culture, it is of great importance to know the thermal tolerance of cultured species and their oxygen consumption since this affects the physiological condition. In this study, the thermal tolerance of Litopenaeus vannamei was determined by dynamic and static thermal methodologies at different acclimation temperatures (15, 20, 25, and 30 degrees C) and salinities (10, 20, and 30 ppt). The oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was also measured to determine the standard metabolic rate (SMR) of shrimp. Accli-mation temperature significantly affected the thermal tolerance and SMR of Litopenaeus vannamei (P < 0.01). Salinity had a large effect on SMR (P < 0.01) but did not influence the thermal acclimation of the shrimp (P > 0.01). Litopenaeus vannamei is a species that has high thermal tolerance and can survive at extreme temperatures (CTmin-CTmax: 7.2-41.9 degrees C) with its large dynamic (988, 992, and 1004 degrees C2) and static thermal polygon areas (748, 778 and 777 degrees C2) developed at the above temperature and salinity combinations and resistance zone (1001, 81 and 82 degrees C2). The optimal temperature range of Litopenaeus vannamei is the 25-30 degrees C range, where a decrease in standard metabolism is determined with increasing temperature. Given the SMR and optimal temperature range, the results of this study indicate that Litopenaeus vannamei should be cultured at 25-30 degrees C for effective production.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103429,112,NA,NA,103429,Litopenaeus vannamei; Pacific white shrimp; Acclimation temperature; Salinity; Thermal tolerance; Thermal polygon; Oxygen consumption; Standard metabolism

A total of 36 sows were randomly assigned into three groups: control group (CON, n = 12) without cooling system, low cooling air speed (2.24 \& PLUSMN; 0.11 m/s) group (LCAS, n = 12) with precision air supply cooling system, high cooling air speed (3.33 \& PLUSMN; 0.11 m/ s) group (HCAS, n = 12) with precision air supply cooling system. The average daily ambient temperature and relative humidity in experimental farrowing rooms were 28 C-32 C and 65\%-90\%, respectively, during daytime (8:00-20:00). The reproductive performance, respiratory rate (RR), body surface temperature (BST), rectal temperature (RT) salivary parameters and fecal microbiota of lactating sows were measured. The results showed that compared with CON group, average daily feed intake of sows and average daily gain of piglets were increased (P < 0.05) in LCAS and HCAS groups.

article,Modeling the impact of temperature on the population abundance of the ambrosia beetle <i>Xyleborus affinis</i> (Curculionidae: Scolytinae) under laboratory-reared conditions,"Rojano, Fernando and Ibarra-Juarez, Luis A. and Powell, James and Salazar, Raquel and Lira-Noriega, Andres",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Modeling the impact of temperature on each life stage of a beetle population represents a continuing challenge. This study evaluates the effects of five temperature treatments (20, 23, 26, 29 and 32 degrees C) on population abundance and timing of a colony of ambrosia beetles Xyleborus affinis reared under laboratory conditions and use this data to develop demographic and phenological models. Abundances at each life stage (eggs, larvae, pupae and adult) were examined through periodic destructive sampling; given that it was not possible to track individuals. To assess the effects of temperature on oviposition, development and survival rates we developed a novel estimation strategy based on cohorts, which does not require individual developmental data. Since oviposition was entirely unwitnessed, we assessed competing empirical ovipositional models. Rates of development were computed using a modal rate curve for each life stage, and rates were projected to cohorts in life stages assuming log-normal developmental variance. Temperature-driven survival rates were assumed to be logistic with a quadratic exponent to capture modal temperature dependence. Parameters were estimated simultaneously using minimum negative log posterior likelihood, assuming Poisson distribution of observations and using priors to inform unobserved developmental rates and enforce mechanistic constraints on oviposition models. A parabolic function best described oviposition rate. Optimal developmental temperatures were 30.5 degrees C, 29 degrees C and 27.5 degrees C, with maximum developmental rates of 0.26/day, 0.12/day and 0.23/day for eggs, larvae and pupae, respectively. The survival rates in the range 20-29 degrees C were equal to 1 in the eggs-to-larvae transition, from 0.72 to 0.35 in larvae-to-pupae transition, and from 0.2 to 0.89 in pupae-to-adults transition. This procedure effectively characterized the direct thermal effects on development and survival of each life stage in the X. affinis under laboratory conditions and would be suitable for estimating temperature dependence for other species in which individual observations are not possible.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103001,101,NA,NA,103001,Developmental rate; Insects; Ovipositional model; Phenology; Survival rate
article,Temporal specific coevolution of Hsp70 and co-chaperone stv expression in Drosophila melanogaster under selection for heat tolerance,"Telonis-Scott, Marina and Ali, Zeinab and Hangartner, Sandra and Sgro, Carla M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Heat shock proteins (Hsps) have long been candidates for ecological adaptation given their unequivocal role in mitigating cell damage from heat stress, but linking Hsps to heat tolerance has proven difficult given the complexity of thermal adaptation. Experimental evolution has been utilized to examine direct and correlated responses to selection for increased heat tolerance in Drosophila, often focusing on the major Hsp family Hsp70 and/or the master regulator HSF as a selection response, but rarely on other aspects of the heat shock complex. We examined Hsp70 and co-chaperone stv isoform transcript expression in Australian D. melanogaster lines selected for static heat tolerance, and observed a temporal and stv isoform specific, coordinated transcriptional selection response with Hsp70, suggesting that increased chaperone output accompanied increased heat tolerance. We hypothesize that the coordinated evolutionary response of Hsp70 and stv may have arisen as a correlated response resulting from a shared regulatory hierarchy. Our work highlights the complexity and specificity of the heat shock response in D. melanogaster. The selected lines examined also showed correlated responses for other measures of heat tolerance, and the coevolution of Hsp70 and stv provide new avenues to examine the common mechanisms underpinning direct and correlated phenotypic responses to selection for heat tolerance.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103110,102,NA,NA,103110,Heat shock; Hsp70; stv; Experimental evolution; Drosophila
article,Plasticity of thermal performance curves in a narrow range endemic water beetle,"Pallares, Susana and Verberk, Wilco C. E. P. and Bilton, David T.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Thermal history can plastically alter the response of ectotherms to temperature, and thermal performance curves (TPCs) are powerful tools for exploring how organismal-level performance varies with temperature. Plasticity in TPCs may be favoured in thermally variable habitats, where it can result in fitness benefits. However, thermal physiology remains insufficiently studied for freshwater insects despite freshwater biodiversity being at great risk under global change. Here, we assess how acclimation at either summer or winter average temperatures changes TPCs for locomotion activity and metabolism in Enochrus jesusarribasi (Hydrophilidae), a water beetle endemic to shallow saline streams in SE Spain. This beetle is a bimodal gas exchanger and so we also assessed how aerial and aquatic gas exchange varied across temperatures for both acclimation treatments. Responses of locomotory TPCs to thermal acclimation were relatively weak, but high temperature acclimated beetles tended to exhibit higher maximum locomotor activity and reduced TPC breadth than those acclimated at lower temperature. High temperature acclimation increased the thermal sensitivity of metabolic rates, contrary to the response generally found in aquatic organisms. Higher metabolic rates upon high temperature acclimation were achieved by increasing aerial, rather than aquatic oxygen uptake. Such plastic respiratory behaviour likely contributed to enhanced locomotor performance at temperatures around the optimum and thermal plasticity could thus be an important component in the response of aquatic insects to climate change. However, high temperature acclimation appeared to be detrimental for locomotion in subsequent exposure at upper sublethal temperatures, suggesting that this narrow range endemic may be vulnerable to future climate warming. This study demonstrates that TPCs are context-specific, differing with performance metric as well as thermal history. Such context dependency must be considered when using TPCs to predict organismal responses to climate change.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103113,102,NA,NA,103113,Acclimation; Metabolism; Locomotion; Climate change; Freshwaters; Insects

A. and Ramadan, Marwa M. and Lu, Jianhua and Hashem, Ahmed S.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature shocks have profound effects on biological and physiological functions at all levels of organization. However, the recovery periods from these shocks and their subsequent impacts remain unknown. Herein, our study investigated the effect of short temperature stress on survival, dormancy recovery time, nutritional indices, life traits and development rate for T. castaneum (larvae and adults) and S. oryzae adults. The results showed significant effects on survival rates of T. castaneum (larvae and adults) and S. oryzae adults. When both insects had been exposed to high-temperature shock, survival rates decreased with higher temperatures and longer periods of exposure. Furthermore, recovery times varied between and within the insect species, as prolonged exposure to thermal shocks increased recovery periods. Moreover, dormancy time resulting from the hightemperature shocks significantly affected food deterrence and food intake, regardless of the stage of development, species, exposure periods and temperature-exposure conditions. Subsequently, differences in body growth rates and food consumption rates are an appropriate indicator of differences in food conversion rates under hightemperature shocks, regardless of the species and developmental stages. On the other hand, our results indicated that as high-temperature shocks increased, the total development period increased of T. castaneum. Likewise, the pupal stage increased with increasing high-temperature shocks, and the larval stage decreased with increasing thermal shocks and increasing the periods of exposure. In summary, our study showed the importance of dormancy recovery time and its subsequent effects for improving disinfestation effectiveness of heat treatment, and understanding insect response to high temperatures.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103062,100,NA,NA,103062,High-temperature shocks; Dormancy recovery time; Stored pests; Tribolium castaneum; Sitophilus oryzae; Nutritional indices

Laser therapy is among the most commonly investigated types of ablative hyperthermia for treatment of cancer. In this method an external heat source provided by a laser fiber leads the cancerous tissue to the necrosis stage. For its simulation a cylindrical geometry of a breast tissue containing a tumor is acted upon by a Gaussian form of laser radiation. Then the feasibility of a fat layer injection around the tumor during the therapy is investigated numerically. In order to consider the finite speed of heat transfer, dual phase lag (DPL) model is implemented for prediction of the thermal results. The therapy is addressed with and without the presence of a fat layer around the breast tumor. Results show that the temperature in the tumor increases up to 15 \% by the injection of a fat layer. Also, the presence of a fat layer around the tumor shows that the irreversible ablation happens at a faster rate.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103073,100,NA,NA,103073,Breast cancer; Hyperthermia laser therapy; Fat layer; Dual phase lag model; Finite element method

Seventeen calves were used (32.2 +/- 5.2 kg of body weight) and the microchips were implanted four days after birth. The microchips were implanted at navel, ear and tail base (subcutaneous), neck (cleidocephalicus) and internal face of leg (gracilis) (intramuscular). Rectal temperature (RT, degrees C), obtained with a clinical thermometer, was considered as core temperature. Air temperature (AT), relative humidity (RH) and the temperature and humidity index (THI) were evaluated at the same time of rectal and microchip temperature measurements over 56 days. The range of AT, RH and THI was 7.6-34.4 degrees C, 17.5-99.0\% and 50.6 to 91.5. The average for rectum, ear, neck, tail, leg, and navel were 38.7; 36.9; 38.0; 37.0, 37.8 and 37.0 degrees C.

Studies have demonstrated the positive effects of diets supplemented with plant-based products that combat heat stress-induced oxidative damage. The aim of this study was to determine whether dietary supplementation with nerolidol prevents or reduces muscle oxidative damage and impairment of the fillet fatty acid profile of matrinxa exposed to heat stress. Plasma and muscle reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels were significantly higher in fish exposed to heat stress compared to fish not exposed to heat stress, while plasma superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity was significantly lower. The total content of saturated fatty acids (SFA) in fillets was significantly higher in fish exposed to heat stress compared to fish not exposed to heat stress, while he total content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) was significantly lower. Nerolidol prevented the increase of muscle LPO and plasma ROS and LPO levels in fish exposed to heat stress, and partially prevented the increase in muscle ROS levels. Diets containing nerolidol prevented the inhibition of muscle GPx activity in fish exposed to heat stress, and partially prevented the decrease of plasma GPx activity. The nerolidol-supplemented diet prevented the increase of fillet SFA in fish exposed to heat stress, while partially preventing the decrease of PUFA. We conclude that acute heat stress at 34 degrees C for 72 h causes plasma and muscular oxidative damage, and that homeoviscous adaptation to maintain membrane fluidity can represent a negative impact for fish consumers. A nerolidol diet can be considered a strategy to prevent heat stress-induced oxidative damage and impairment of muscle fatty acid profiles.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103003,99,NA,NA,103003,matrinxa; Climate changes; Water temperature; Food security; Oxidative damage; Fish physiology

Likewise, we found no evidence of within-environment trade-offs between heat tolerance and fitness-related traits in any of the environments. Neither short-term and long-term heat tolerance shows any consistent relationship with lipid fluorescence polarization and lipid peroxidation across clones or environments. Pervasive positive correlations between fitness-related traits indicate differences in genetic load rather than trade-off based local adaptation or thermal specialization. For heat tolerance such differences may be caused by either relaxation of stabilizing selection due to lower exposure to high temperature extremes, i.e., conditional neutrality, or by small effective population size followed by the recent range expansion.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102934,98,NA,NA,102934,Daphnia; Heat tolerance; Local adaptation; Trade-offs; Genetic load
article,Looking ahead of 2021 Tokyo Summer Olympic Games: How Does Humid Heat Affect Endurance Performance? Insight into physiological mechanism and heat-related illness prevention strategies,"Lei, Tze-Huan and Wang, Faming",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The combination of high humidity and ambient temperature of the 2021 Tokyo Summer Olympic Game will undoubtfully result in greater physiological strains and thereby downregulates the endurance performance of athletes. Although many research studies have highlighted that the thermoregulatory strain is greater when the environment is hot and humid, no review articles have addressed the thermoregulatory and performance differences between dry and humid heat and such lack of consensuses in this area will lead to increase the risk of heat-related injuries as well as suboptimal preparation. Furthermore, specific strategies to counteract this stressful environment has not been outlined in the current literature. Therefore, the purposes of this review are: 1) to provide a clear evidence that humid heat is more stressful than dry heat for both male and female athletes and therefore the preparation for the Tokyo Summer Olympic should be environmental specific instead of a one size fits all approach; 2) to highlight why female athletes may be facing a disadvantage when performing a prolonged endurance event under high humidity environment and 3) to highlight the potential interventional strategies to reduce thermal strain in hot-humid environment. The summaries of this review are: both male and female should be aware of the environmental condition in Tokyo as humid heat is more stressful than dry heat; Short-term heat acclimation may not elicit proper thermoregulatory adaptations in hot-humid environment; cold water immersion with proper hydration and some potential per-cooling modalities may be beneficial for both male and female athletes in hot-humid environment.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102975,99,NA,NA,102975,Tokyo olympic game; Heat stress; Endurance performance; Heat acclimation; per-cooling; Pre-cooling
article,"A nocturnally foraging gecko of the high-latitude alpine zone: Extreme tolerance of cold nights, with cryptic basking by day","Bertoia, Aaron and Monks, Joanne and Knox, Carey and Cree, Alison",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Lizards that inhabit high-latitude alpine zones are exposed to extreme temperatures and long winters and most are diurnal heliotherms. Yet some poorly known nocturnal species exist in such locations, including several viviparous geckos from New Zealand. We studied the orange-spotted gecko (Mokopirirakau `Roy's Peak'), a cryptic, nocturnal and viviparous lizard known only from the alpine zone (1150-1800 m a.s.l.) in the South Island (-44 degrees S). Our field study investigated (1) the influence of female reproductive condition and sex on daytime body temperatures, including relationships with microhabitat rock temperatures, (2) the influence of temperature and other weather conditions on gecko emergence by night and day, and (3) the thermal microclimates available year-round to orange-spotted geckos. Building a better understanding of these lizards aids in species conservation efforts, for example in developing monitoring programmes, and provides insights into the evolution of thermal mechanisms in cold environments. Reproductive females maintained higher daytime body temperatures than non-reproductive females and males, suggesting pregnancy-related thermophily. On summer days, all reproductive groups reached similar body temperatures to New Zealand geckos from lower elevations, suggesting similar thermal preferences. Using trail cameras, we obtained evidence of geckos openly basking during the day (previously undocumented for this species) when temperatures of exposed lizard models (=Texp) were 3.2-39.3 degrees C. We also observed emergence at night at low Texp (-0.8-14.6 degrees C), when some Tbs were probably 0-6 degrees C. Diurnal activity increased as Texp rose to peak at -30 degrees C before dropping again at higher temperatures, whereas nocturnal activity unexpectedly decreased with increasing Texp. Our study provides evidence of diurnal activity in a `nocturnal' gecko that may be essential to squamate viviparity at high-latitude, high-elevation sites. It also suggests remarkable capacity for locomotor activity at extremely low Tb.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102957,99,NA,NA,102957,Activity period; Alpine lizard; Cold environment; High-latitude; Thermoregulation viviparity

The day shift (morning and afternoon) was considered as a fixed effect in the factorial arrangement. Principal component analysis (P-CA), correspondence analysis (C-A) and canonical discriminant analysis (C-DA) were used. There was no interaction (P > 0.05) between phytases and dosages for thermoregulatory responses. Respiratory rate (R-R), cloacal temperature (C-T), and surface temperature with feathers (S-TWF) and featherless (S-TF) were higher (P < 0.001) in the afternoon. Birds show different thermoregulatory and behavioral responses in the two shifts of the day. We also observed that birds supplemented with bacterial and fungal phytase showed similar thermoregulatory and behavioral responses to the control group in both day shifts. Expression of the ``eating{'' activity was greater in the morning, while the birds remained sitting longer in the afternoon. Egg production was higher (P < 0.001) in birds supplemented with bacterial phytase. The phytase dosages had no effect on thermoregulatory, behavioral or performance responses. Egg production, feed conversion per dozen eggs corresponded to 81.1\% of the differences between bacterial and fungal phytase supplementation and group control. Thus, we conclude that: (i) phytase dietary supplementation has no effect on the thermoregulatory responses of laying hens reared in a hot environment; (ii) birds supplemented with bacterial phytase showed higher egg production; and (iii) phytases (450 and 900 FTU) do not interfere with productive, behavioral and thermoregulatory responses.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102773,94,NA,NA,102773,Egg production; Enzymes; Ethology; Homoeothermic; Multivariate analysis; Semi-arid
article,Quantifying the cooling effect of rain events on outdoor thermal comfort in the southern coastal stations of the Caspian Sea,"Roshan, Gholamreza and Moghbel, Masoumeh",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Pleasant outdoor thermal conditions depend on a wide range of climatic elements. The impact of rainfall events, as important climatic elements, on providing thermal comfort, has been less explored in the available literature. The work presented herein investigates the impact of Rainy Days as well as a Day Prior to (D-prior) and a Day Post rain (D-post) events on thermal conditions in the southern coastal region of the Caspian Sea. In this study, rainfall events during 1961-2017 observational period were categorized based on their intensity. Then, human thermal comfort during non-rainy (sunny) and rainy days was estimated and compared by using the radiation-driven Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) index, Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) and Perceived Temperature (PT) index. Furthermore, difference between the average of thermal conditions in rainy days compared to a day prior and a day post rain events was calculated separately for comfort, cold and heat stress thresholds of each bioclimatic index. Finally, the correlation between the average of indices for rainy days and the frequency of rainfall events of each specific year was computed. Results suggested that overall average of studied indices for all rainy days is lower than the average for days prior and post the rain events. PET index has shown to be most impacted and reduced as a result of rain events and therefore more indicative of a cool ing effect. The observed difference in total average of PET in rainy days compared to non-rainy days were 8.30 degrees C, 5.86 degrees C and 8.85 degrees C for Babolsar, Rahst and Gorgan stations, respectively. Generally, the cooling effect of rain events on the temperature for a day prior rain events is higher than a day post rainfall. Finally, the trend analysis on rainy days in the studied period revealed that the average of bioclimatic indices in western stations (Babolsar and Rasht) are increasing whereas a decreasing trend was observed for Gorgan as more of an eastern station.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102733,93,NA,NA,102733,Rainfall events; Thermal comfort; Cooling effect; Caspian sea; Iran
article,Variation of body temperature of active amphibians along elevation gradients in eastern Nepal Himalaya,"Khatiwada, Janak R. and Zhao, Tian and Jiang, Jianping",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Understanding the thermal ecology of active amphibians, as well as its relationship with habitat and environmental features, is a central theme in ecology. However, this topic has been poorly studied in eastern Himalaya, which is a global biodiversity hotspot. To bridge this gap, we investigated how the body temperatures of active amphibians varied along an elevation gradient in the Arun and Tamor River catchments in eastern Nepal Himalaya in the present study. Amphibian assemblages were sampled from May to July in both 2014 and 2015 using nocturnal time-constrained visual encounter surveys, and the body temperature of each individual was directly measured using a digital infrared thermometer in the field. A combination of linear regression and hierarchical partitioning analyses was used to determine the effects of elevation and environmental variables on the body temperatures of active amphibians. In total, the body temperatures of 599 amphibian individuals belonging to 28 species from six families were recorded. Our results indicated that amphibian body temperature exhibited monotonically declining trends with increasing elevations in eastern Nepal Himalaya. Interestingly, this tread was much more pronounced in subtropical (lowland) areas than in warm and cool temperate regions. Inter- and intraspecies variations in body temperature were large, which can be attributed to distinct habitat utilization among species and the change in vegetation cover in different bioclimatic zones. Among all environmental variables, substrate temperature and water temperature were the best predictors of the amphibian body temperature. Overall, this study revealed amphibian body temperature patterns along an elevation gradient in eastern Nepal Himalaya, which were principally driven by temperature-related environmental factors. We believe our results can provide important information on amphibian physiological traits, which may help ecologists predict their responses to future climate change and formulate protection strategies.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102653,92,NA,NA,102653,Eastern Nepal Himalaya; Amphibians; Thermal ecology; Spatial patterns

P. and Ujita, Aska and Faro, Lenira El",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Our aim was to evaluate the application of infrared thermography (IRT) to detect body surface temperature variation of body regions during the proestrus and estrus phases of the reproductive cycle of Gyr heifers and investigate environmental factors that could affect these measurements. Fifty-seven heifers were submitted to an ovulation synchronization protocol. This was followed by monitoring the heifers every 12 h over 60 h. Heifers were monitored for rectal and vaginal temperature using a digital thermometer. The surface temperature of the eye, vulva, and muzzle regions were monitored by IRT. Meteorological data was recorded for temperature and humidity. Observation of sexual behavior was performed to monitor estrus onset. Transrectal ultrasonography was used to identify the dominant follicle and confirm ovulation of all heifers. We observed a decrease in temperature of the rectum and vagina, as well as in the eye and vulva regions within the first 12 h after the completion of the synchronization. This period coincides with the expected proestrus phase of the estrous cycle. A progressive increase in all temperatures was noticed in the following 36 h, which coincides with the estrus phase of the reproductive cycle. The regions evaluated around the vulva and eye exhibited the highest temperature and experienced less environmental distortion than the muzzle area thermographs. Environmental factors, such as rainfall and temperature-humidity index, influenced the IRT readings altering the radiation patterns detected. In conclusion, IRT is an effective method to detect temperature variation during the proestrus and estrus phases in Gyr heifers. Furthermore, biological and environmental effects should be considered when collecting and interpreting IRT data in livestock.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102662,92,NA,NA,102662,Dairy cow; Heat detection; Livestock precision farming; Reproduction; Thermal sensor; Zebu cattle

Our study aims to provide information on the pest biology as influenced by temperature, determine thermal thresholds, and provide life table parameters for M. leuconotus reared in the laboratory. The life cycle of M. leuconotus was studied at seven constant temperatures in the range 15-35 degrees C, with 80 +/- 5\% RH and a photoperiod of L:D 12:12. Linear and nonlinear models were fitted to laboratory data to describe the impact of temperature on M. leuconotus development, mortality, fecundity and senescence. The complete life cycle was obtained between 18 and 30 degrees C, with the egg incubation period ranging 10.8-29.2 days. The development time was longest for the larva, with 194.2 days at 30 degrees C and 543.1 days at 18 degrees C. The minimum temperature threshold (T-min) was estimated at 10.7, 10.0 and 11.5 degrees C, for egg, larva and pupa, respectively. The maximum temperature threshold (T-max) was estimated at 37.4, 40.6 and 40.0 degrees C for egg, larva and pupa, respectively. The optimum temperature for immature stage survival was estimated between 23.0 and 23.9 degrees C. The highest fecundity was 97.8 eggs per female at 23 degrees C.

One quick screening method of a physiological thermal tipping point is the temperature at which maximum heart rate (f(Hmax)) can no longer scale predictably with warming and is referred to as the Arrhenius break temperature (T-AB). The use of this method has been successful for freshwater fish by using external electrodes to detect an electrocardiogram (ECG), however, the properties of this equipment pose challenges in salt water when evaluating marine fish. To overcome these challenges, this study aimed to explore the potential use of implantable heart rate loggers to quantify the T-AB of Chrysoblephus laticeps, a marine Sparid, following the ECG method protocols where f(Hmax) is monitored over an acute warming event and the T-AB is subsequently identified using a piece-wise linear regression model. Of the nine experimental fish, only five (56\%) returned accurate f(Hmax) data. The T-AB of successful trials was identified each time and ranged from 18.09 to 20.10 degrees C. This study therefore provides evidence that implantable heart rate loggers can estimate TAB of fish which can be applied to many marine species.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102524,89,NA,NA,102524,Conservation physiology; Climate change; Marine; Chrysoblephus laticeps
article,Infrared thermography provides insight into the thermal properties of bird nests,"Biddle, Lucia E. and Goodman, Adrian M. and Deeming, D. Charles",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Thermal properties of nests have been investigated using a variety of techniques. Infrared (IR) thermography has the advantage of being a non-invasive technique allowing the integrity of the nest wall to be retained during measurement. This study investigated the insulative properties of nests of the Eurasian Bullfinch (Pyrrhula pyrrhula), the Common Blackbird (Turdus merula) and the Song Thrush (Turdus philomelos) using IR thermography. Nests were inverted over a heat source and the temperature of the external nest surface was recorded. Bullfinch nests were less insulated than thrush nests. Including foil inside the nest cup decreased the amount of convection through the open walls of Bullfinch nests. Removal of the outer nest and cup lining of thrush nests only slightly decreased the degree of insulation offered by the nest indicating an important insulative role for the substantial `mud cup' in these nests. The results suggested that the nest wall is not sealed and convection currents may a play a significant role in nest insulation. In conjunction with a steady-state heat source IR thermography is useful in assessing the insulative properties of bird nests.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.07.008,76,NA,95-100,NA,Eurasian Bullfinch; Infrared thermography; Insulation; Nest construction; Thrush
article,The Humboldt Penguin (Spheniscus humboldti) Rete Tibiotarsale - A supreme biological heat exchanger,"Kazas, Shaked and Benelly, Moran and Golan, Saar",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Humans are unable to survive low temperature environments without custom designed clothing and support systems. In contrast, certain penguin species inhabit extremely cold climates without losing substantial energy to self-heating (emperor penguins ambient temperature plummets to as low as -45 degrees C). Penguins accomplish this task by relying on distinct anatomical, physiological and behavioral adaptations. One such adaptation is a blood vessel heat exchanger called the `Rete Tibiotarsale' - an intermingled network of arteries and veins found in penguins' legs. The Rete existence results in blood occupying the foot expressing a lower average temperature and thus the penguin loosing less heat to the ground. This study examines the Rete significance for the species thermal endurance. The penguin anatomy (leg and main blood vessels) is reconstructed using data chiefly based on the Humboldt species. The resulting model is thermally analyzed using finite element (COMSOL) with the species environment used as boundary conditions. A human-like blood vessel configuration, scaled to the penguin's dimensions, is used as a control for the study. Results indicate that the Rete existence facilitates upkeep of 25 - 65\% of the species total metabolic energy production as compared with the human-like configuration; thus making the Rete probably crucial for penguin thermal endurance. Here, we quantitatively link for the first time the function and structure of this remarkable physiological phenotype.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.04.011,67,NA,67-78,NA,Biological heat exchanger; Thermal endurance; Physiological adaptation; Finite elements
article,Assessing the reliability of thermography to infer internal body temperatures of lizards,"Barroso, Frederico M. and Carretero, Miguel A. and Silva, Francisco and Sannolo, Marco",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"For many years lizard thermal ecology studies have relied on the use of contact thermometry to obtain internal body temperature (T-b) of the animals. However, with progressing technology, an interest grew in using new, less invasive methods, such as InfraRed (IR) pyrometry and thermography, to infer T-b of reptiles. Nonetheless few studies have tested the reliability of these new tools. The present study tested the use of IR cameras as a noninvasive tool to infer T-b of lizards, using three differently body-sized lacertid species (Podarcis virescens, Lacerta schreiberi and Timon lepidus). Given the occurrence of regional heterothermy, we pairwise compared thermography readings of six body parts (snout, eye, head, dorsal, hind limb, tail base) to cloacal temperature (measured by a thermometer-associated thermocouple probe) commonly employed to measure T-b in field and lab studies. The results showed moderate to strong correlations (R-2=0.84-0.99) between all body parts and cloacal temperature. However, despite the readings on the tail base showed the strongest correlation in all three species, it was the eye where the absolute values and pattern of temperature change most consistently followed the cloacal measurements. Hence, we concluded that the eye would be the body location whose IR camera readings more closely approximate that of the animal's internal environment. Alternatively, other body parts can be used, provided that a careful calibration is carried out. We provide guidelines for future research using thermography to infer T-b of lizards.",2016,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.10.004,62,A,90-96,NA,Thermography; Thermal imaging; Infrared camera; Lizard body temperature; Regional heterothermy
article,Altitudinal variation in bumble bee (<i>Bombus</i>) critical thermal limits,"Oyen, K. Jeannet and Giri, Susma and Dillon, Michael E.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Organism critical thermal limits are often tightly linked to current geographic distribution and can therefore help predict future range shifts driven by changing environmental temperatures. Thermal tolerance of diverse organisms often varies predictably with latitude, with upper thermal limits changing little and lower thermal limits decreasing with latitude. Despite similarly steep gradients in environmental temperatures across altitude, few studies have investigated altitudinal variation in critical thermal limits. We estimated critical thermal minimum (CTmin), critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and recovery temperature (T-rec) by tracking righting response of three bumble bee species during thermal ramps: Bombus huntii collected from 2180 m asl, and Bombus bifarius and Bombus sylvicola collected from 3290 m asl in Wyoming, USA. Overall, larger bees could tolerate more extreme temperatures, likely due to a thermal inertia driven lag between core body temperatures and air temperatures. Despite their smaller size, high altitude bumble bees tolerated colder air temperatures: they had similar to 1 degrees C lower Crmin and recovered from cold exposure at similar to 3-4 degrees C lower air temperatures. Conversely, low altitude bees tolerated similar to 5 degrees C hotter air temperatures. These altitudinal differences in thermal tolerance parallel differences in average daily minimum (1.2 degrees C) and maximum (7.5 degrees C) temperatures between these sites. These results provide one of the few measurements of organism thermal tolerance across altitude and the first evidence for geographical differences in tolerance of temperature extremes in heterothermic bumble bees.

article,The effects of fasting on swimming performance in juvenile qingbo (<i>Spinibarbus sinensis</i>) at two temperatures,"Pang, Xu and Yuan, Xing-Zhong and Cao, Zhen-Dong and Fu, Shi-Jian",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"We measured the following variables to investigate the effects of fasting and temperature on swimming performance in juvenile qingbo (Spinibarbus sinensis): the critical swimming speed (U-ciit), resting metabolic rate (MO2rest) and active metabolic rate(MO2,(active),) of fish fasting for 0 (control), 1, 2 and 4 weeks at low and high acclimation temperatures (15 and 25 degrees C). Both fasting treatment and temperature acclimation had significant effects on all parameters measured (P < 0.05). Fasting at the higher temperature had a negative effect on all measured parameters after 1 week (P < 0.05). However,. when acclimated to the lower temperature, fasting had a negative effect on {[}Ark until week 2 and on (MO2rest), (MO2active) and metabolic scope (MS, (MO2active) (MO2rest)) until week 4 (P < 0.05). The values of all parameters at the lower temperature were significantly lower than those at the higher temperature in the identical fasting period groups except for (MO2rest) of the fish that fasted for 2 weeks. The relationship between fasting time (T) and U-crit was described as U-crit(15)= 0.302T(2) 0.800T+35.877 (r=0.781, n=32, P< 0.001) and Ucrit (25)=0.471T(2) 3.781T+ 50.097 (r=0.766, n=32, P < 0.001) at 15 and 25 degrees C, respectively. The swimming performance showed less decrease in the early stage of fasting but more decrease in the later stage at the low temperature compared to the high temperature, which might be related to thermal acclimation time, resting metabolism, respiratory capacity, energy stores, enzyme activity in muscle tissue and energy substrate utilization changes with fasting between low and high temperatures. The divergent response of the swimming performance to fasting in qingbo at different temperatures might be an adaptive strategy to seasonal temperature and food resource variation in their habitat.

article,Divergence for tolerance to thermal-stress related traits in two <i>Drosophila</i> species of immigrans group,"Parkash, Ravi and Ranga, Poonam",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"We investigated associations of the species specific divergence of thermal adaptations of Drosophila nasuta and Drosophila immigrans with seasonal as well as geographical changes in the relative abundance. In D. immigrans, cold resistance and egg-to-adult viability after a cold-shock have shown a positive dine with latitude, whereas no such clinal patterns were evident for heat resistance as well as egg-to-adult viability after heat stress. In contrast, basal heat tolerance and egg-to-adult viability after a heat-shock increased towards the equator i.e. from north to south in D. nasuta. Further, we also found species-specific divergence in seasonal climatic selection responses for heat as well as cold resistance i.e. warmer and higher humidity conditions of the rainy season have evidenced similar to 2-fold higher heat tolerance of D. nasuta, but lower temperature as well as lower humidity conditions of the autumn significantly increased (similar to 3-fold) cold tolerance of D. immigrans. Geographical variations were significant for the absolute and relative hardening capacity for cold tolerance in D. immigrans, but for heat resistance of D. nasuta. Results of multiple regression analysis of changes in thermal tolerance level in latitudinal populations as a simultaneous function of climatic variables ( T-ave and RH) have shown that average yearly relative humidity levels significantly affect heat tolerance of D. nasuta, but both T-ave and RH contribute to changes in the cold tolerance of D. immigrans. Thus, our results suggest that climatic selection responses for basal and hardened thermo-tolerance levels affect relative abundance of D. nasuta and D. immigrans across a latitudinal transect as well as seasons.

article,Does copper contamination change thermotaxis of the soil arthropod Folsomia candida (Collembola)?,"Ge, Jian and Slotsbo, Stine and Sorensen, Jesper Givskov and Holmstrup, Martin",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Behavioural thermoregulation (thermotaxis) is essential for soil invertebrates to evade thermal extremes in terrestrial environments. Extensive and continuous use of copper (Cu) based products has led to elevated Cu concentration in soils across the globe and in some areas reaching concentrations that are hazardous to soil invertebrates. We hypothesised that environmental stressors, for example, exposure to heavy metals may compromise the adaptive behavioural thermoregulation of organisms, but very little is known of such interactions. In this study, we chose Cu as a model toxicant and investigated the potential effect of Cu- contaminated soils on the behavioural thermoregulation of springtails ( Folsomia candida). ). We measured the distribution of springtails when placed on a temperature gradient ranging from 6 to 46 degrees C and estimated their thermal preference as an indicator of behavioural thermoregulation. Results showed that within 60 min of being introduced to the thermal gradient, the distribution of springtails was unimodal with slight skewness towards high temperature. Springtails exhibited a consistent preferred temperature range of approximately 21-23 degrees C across all Cu exposure levels and time points. However, Cu contamination increased the frequency of springtails recorded along the gradient where temperature was above 30 degrees C. We interpreted this observation as Cu-exposed animals having an elevated risk of entering heat coma and not being able to evade noxious temperatures.

article,Heat stress enhances the occurrence of erythromycin resistance of <i>Enterococcus</i> isolates in mice feces,"Yi, Lingxian and Xu, Rui and Yuan, Xiaowu and Ren, Zining and Song, Huihui and Lai, Huamin and Sun, Zhihua and Deng, Hui and Yang, Bo and Yu, Daojin",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Heat stress is a common environmental factor in livestock breeding that has been shown to impact the development of antibiotic resistance within the gut microbiota of both human and animals. However, studies investigating the effect of temperature on antibiotic resistance in Enterococcus isolates remain limited. In this study, specific pathogen free (SPF) mice were divided into a control group maintained at normal temperature and an experimental group subjected to daily 1-h heat stress at 38 degrees C, respectively. Gene expression analysis was conducted to evaluate the activation of heat shock responsive genes in the liver of mice. Additionally, the antibiotic-resistant profile and antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) in fecal samples from mice were analyzed. The results showed an upregulation of heat-inducible proteins HSP27, HSP70 and HSP90 following heat stress exposure, indicating successful induction of cellular stress within the mice. Furthermore, heat stress resulted in an increase in the proportion of erythromycin-resistant Enterococcus isolates, escalating from 0 \% to 0.23 \% over a 30-day duration of heat stress. The resistance of Enterococcus isolates to erythromycin also had a 128-fold increase in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) within the heated-stressed group compared to the control group. Additionally, a 2 similar to 8-fold rise in chloramphenicol MIC was observed among these erythromycin-resistant Enterococcus isolates. The acquisition of ermB genes was predominantly responsible for mediating the erythromycin resistance in these Enterococcus isolates. Moreover, the abundance of macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin (MLS) resistant-related genes in the fecal samples from the heat-stressed group exhibited a significant elevation compared to the control group, primarily driven by changes in bacterial community composition, especially Enterococcaceae and Planococcaceae, and the transfer of mobile genetic elements (MGEs), particularly insertion elements. Collectively, these results highlight the role of environmental heat stress in promoting antibiotic resistance in Enterococcus isolates and partly explain the increasing prevalence of erythromycin-resistant Enterococcus isolates observed among animals in recent years.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103786,120,NA,NA,103786,Heat stress; Antibiotic resistance; Enterococcus isolates; Intestinal flora

R.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Introduction: Passive heating is receiving increasing attention within human performance and health contexts. A low-cost, portable steam sauna pod may offer an additional tool for those seeking to manipulate physiological (cardiovascular, thermoregulatory and sudomotor) and perceptual responses for improving sporting or health profiles. This study aimed to 1) report the different levels of heat stress and determine the pods' inter-unit reliability, and 2) quantify the reliability of physiological and perceptual responses to passive heating. Method: In part 1, five pods were assessed for temperature and relative humidity (RH) every 5 min across 70 min of heating for each of the 9 settings. In part 2, twelve males (age: 24 +/- 4 years) completed two 60 min trials of passive heating (3 x 20 min at 44 degrees C/99\% RH, separated by 1 week). Heart rate (HR), rectal (T-rectal) and tympanic temperature (T-tympanic) were recorded every 5 min, thermal comfort (T-comfort) and sensation (T-sensation) every 10 min, mean arterial pressure (MAP) at each break period and sweat rate (SR) after exiting the pod. Results: In part 1, setting 9 provided the highest temperature (44.3 +/- 0.2 degrees C) and longest time RH remained stable at 99\% (51 +/- 7 min). Inter-unit reliability data demonstrated agreement between pods for settings 5-9 (intra-class correlation {[}ICC] >0.9), but not for settings 1-4 (ICC <0.9). In part 2, between-visits, high correlations, and low typical error of measurement (TEM) and coefficient of variation (CV) were found for T-rectal, HR, MAP, SR, and T-comfort, but not for T-tympanic or T-sensation. A peak T-rectal of 38.09 +/- 0.30 degrees C, HR of 124 +/- 15 b min(-1) and a sweat loss of 0.73 +/- 0.33 L were reported. No between-visit differences (p > 0.05) were observed for T-rectal, T-tympanic, T-sensation or T-comfort, however HR (+3 b.min(-1)) and MAP (+4 mmHg) were greater in visit 1 vs. 2 (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Portable steam sauna pods generate reliable heat stress between-units. The highest setting (44 degrees C/99\% RH) also provides reliable but modest adjustments in physiological and perceptual responses.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103743,118,NA,NA,103743,Hyperthermia; Heat therapy; Heat adaptation; Reliability; Passive heating

Fourteen young healthy adults (8 females) were recruited for this study where they underwent two trials with (Fan) and without an electric fan (No fan) during 50 min of passive heat stress. The skin temperature on forearm and abdomen was lower in Fan than in No fan (all p < 0.02), and the local skin temperature on the chest, and mean skin temperature were significantly lower in Fan than in No fan in the final 20 min (mean value of mean skin temperature: 34.77(0.15) degrees C vs 35.11(0.12) degrees C, respectively, all p < 0.03), whilst the rectal temperature was not different between trials (37.11(0.23) degrees C vs 37.08(0.27) degrees C, p = 0.78). The sensitivity of local sweat rate (LSR) with the increase of mean body temperature on the chest and forearm was significantly lower in Fan than No fan trials (all p < 0.02). The sum value of thermal sensation was lower and wetness was higher in Fan than in No fan in the final 25 min (thermal sensation: 7.50 (1.25) vs 5.00 (3.06), wetness: -6.57 (2.31) vs -5.21 (2.46), all p<0.03) whilst thermal discomfort did not differ significantly between trials (p = 0.12).

article,Differential effects of parental and developmental temperatures on larval thermal adaptation in oviparous and viviparous model fish species,"Xia, Jigang and Deng, Chuke and Zheng, Xueli and Huang, Yan and Elvidge, Chris K. and Fu, Shijian",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Phenotypic plasticity has been identified as a major mechanism of response to changing temperatures. Parental effects are potentially important drivers of ecological and evolutionary dynamics, while developmental plasticity also plays a key role in generating phenotypic variation. However, little is known of the interaction between parental effects and developmental plasticity on the thermal phenotypes of fishes with different reproductive modes (i.e. oviparous vs. viviparous). To understand the contributions of inter-and intra-generational plasticity of thermal phenotypes (preferred temperature, avoidance temperatures, critical thermal thresholds) in fishes with different reproductive modes, we carried out a factorial experiment in which both breeding parents and offspring were exposed to lower (22 degrees C) or higher (28 degrees C) temperatures, using zebrafish (Danio rerio) and guppies (Poecilia reticulata) as representative oviparous and viviparous species. We found that offspring thermal preference and avoidance of both species were significantly influenced by parental effects and developmental plasticity, with higher thermal preference and avoidance consistent with higher background (parental) temperature treatments. However, parental effects were only found to impose significant effect on the thermal tolerances of guppies. The findings suggest that phenotypic plasticity, both within and across generations, may be an important mechanism to adapt to rapid climate changes, and that future temperature fluctuations may impose more profound effects on viviparous fish species in general.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103695,117,NA,NA,103695,Climate change; Parental effects; Development; Thermal adaptation; Transgenerational plasticity (TGP)

A. and Shourrap, Mohamed",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Short Periods of Incubation During Egg Storage (SPIDES) approach improves chick quality and hatching rates. Also, embryonic thermal conditioning (TC) is a strategy for enhancing thermotolerance in avian species. Until now, evaluating the effect of either SPIDES or embryonic TC effects has only been separately conducted, so we hypothesized that combining TC and SPIDES may enhance the response of broilers to thermal stress. Eight hundred Ross broiler eggs were divided into two groups; the first one was kept under appropriate storage room conditions, S0 (control) The 2nd was subjected to SPIDES for 5 h at 37.8 OC \& PLUSMN; 0.1 three times at days 5, 10, and 15 (S1) after egg collection respectively. On the 14th day of incubation (DOI) each of the two main groups was randomly divided into two equal subgroups; the control one was left under the appropriate incubation settings (TC0) whereas the other received prenatal heat conditioning (TC1) at 39.5 OC \& PLUSMN; 0.1 for 6 h/d from the 14th to the 18th embryonic day (E), resulting finally in four experimental subgroups (S0TC0, S1TC0, S0TC1 \& S1TC1). Results: showed that SPIDES treatment improved the hatchability of the stored eggs by almost 20\% compared to untreated eggs. A combination of SPIDES and TC (S1TC1) increased significantly the levels of Immunoglobulin (IgG and IgM) production at hatch and heat-stressed birds. Our findings revealed that the hepatic heat shock proteins (hsp70, 90 A,90 B, 60 and hspA9), antioxidants-related genes (CAT, and SOD2), and NADPH4 were significantly downregulated in the thermally conditioned group that challenged with thermal stress conditions. As opposed to that, the SPIDES group showed a significant increase in hepatic heat shock proteins, antioxidants-related genes, and NADPH4 when subjected to thermal-stress conditions. In conclusion, the combination of SPIDES and TC has a positive effect on some pre and post-hatch traits of broiler chicks. Under heat stress challenge, thermal conditioning can modify the expression of antioxidant-related genes and Hsps, leading to the enhanced acquisition of thermotolerance as evidenced by lower expression of Hsps and NADPH4.

article,Potential for urban warming to postpone overwintering dormancy of temperate mosquitoes,"Fyie, Lydia R. and Tronetti, Hannah R. and Gardiner, Mary M. and Meuti, Megan E.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Cities are generally hotter than surrounding rural areas due to the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. These increases in temperature advance plant and animal phenology, development, and reproduction in the spring. However, research determining how increased temperatures affect the seasonal physiology of animals in the fall has been limited. The Northern house mosquito, Culex pipiens, is abundant in cities and transmits several pathogens including West Nile virus. Females of this species enter a state of developmental arrest, or reproductive diapause, in response to short days and low temperatures during autumn. Diapausing females halt reproduction and blood-feeding, and instead accumulate fat and seek sheltered overwintering sites. We found that exposure to increased temperatures in the lab that mimic the UHI effect induced ovarian development and blood-feeding, and that females exposed to these temperatures were as fecund as non-diapausing mosquitoes. We also found that females exposed to higher temperatures had lower survival rates in winter-like conditions, despite having accumulated equivalent lipid reserves relative to their diapausing congeners. These data suggest that urban warming may inhibit diapause initiation in the autumn, thereby extending the active biting season of temperate mosquitoes.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103594,115,NA,NA,103594,Northern house mosquito; Culex pipiens; Diapause; Urban Heat Island

The present study concerns the numerical study of phase change phenomena during cryosurgery using the three-phase lag (TPL) bioheat model in arbitrary soft tissue domains, i.e., circular (Gamma(1)), ameba-like (Gamma(2)), and multiconnected (Gamma(3)). We employ the effective heat capacity formulation to solve the nonlinear governing equation. The Gaussian radial basis function and Crank-Nicolson finite difference approximation are applied for spatial and time derivatives, respectively.

article,A scaled-down model of a dairy barn to imitate a livestock building for modelling and control of environmental conditions,"Beyhan, Selami",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Heat stress has vital importance in livestock farming due to the physiological changes on the animals so that meat and milk production is significantly degraded. Recently, the hereditary and mental effects of environmental conditions have also been discussed for future generations. Therefore, high-level automation solutions are required to keep the environmental conditions in the barns as optimal as possible. In this paper, a hangar-type scaled-down barn was experimentally designed for modelling and control of the environmental conditions. First, the temperature-humidity index (THI) which is a measure of the heat stress, was stabilized to its critical value in two regions of the barn by using proportional-integrative-derivative (PID) controller. The ventilation fans were controlled at variable speeds so that energy efficiency was also provided when compared to the on-off control. Second, we proposed the state-space modelling of the coupled temperature and humidity dynamics for the interior space of the barn so that the obtained model can be utilized for mathematical analysis and accurate control. Specifically, state monitoring and prediction, optimal control, and observer-based sensor-less control are to be applied based on its state-space model. The parameters of the state-space model were here estimated with an Extended-Kalman Filter (EKF). Performances are calculated in terms of mean square error (MSE), and the performance values were found to be less than 5\% for stabilization and less than 2\% for modelling, respectively. The proposed scaled-down barn model is a low-cost design that can be used as an example for those who work in this field to conduct experimental studies before making large investments. Barn design can also be modified for modelling, analysis, and control of new heat stress measures in the future.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103571,114,NA,NA,103571,Heat stress; THI index; Dairy barn model; PID control; State -space model

Sexually mature males of the desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria) in the Sahara Desert remain on the open ground, despite the ground temperatures exceeding their lethal limit, to form leks and to mate incoming gravid females during the daytime. Lekking male locusts apparently suffer from extreme heat stress and greatly fluctuating thermal conditions. The present study examined the thermoregulatory strategies of the lekking male S. gregaria. Our field observations showed that lekking males changed their body orientation toward the sun depending on the temperature and time of day. In the relatively cool morning, males basked by orienting perpendicular to the sun's rays, maximizing the area of body surface exposed to the sun's rays. In contrast, around midday, when the ground surface temperature exceeded lethal high temperatures, some males tended to shelter inside the plants or remain in the shade. However, the remainder stayed on the ground, stilted (i.e., extending their legs to raise their bodies off the hot ground) and oriented parallel to the sun's rays, which minimized radiative heating. Measurements of body temperature throughout the hot middle period of the day confirmed that the stilting posture prevented over-heating. Their critical lethal body temperature was as high as 54.7 degrees C. In this lekking system, gravid females enter male leks by flying. These incoming females usually landed on open ground, whereupon nearby males immediately approached, mounted, and mated the female, implying that males with greater heat-tolerance can increase mating chance. These results suggest that behavioral thermoregulation and physiologically high heat tolerance of male desert locusts allows them to endure extreme thermal conditions for lekking.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103466,112,NA,NA,103466,Coadaptation; Desert; Ecological niche; Lek; Phenotypic plasticity; Thermoregulation

The objective of this investigation was to evaluate thermo-adaptability between Tharparkar calves (TC), an indige-nous milch breed of India and crossbred calves (CC) during induced heat stress in controlled environment. For this purpose, 12 apparently healthy male calves (six in each group) aged 5-6 months, were selected. The experiment was conducted at physiologically comfortable temperature (25 degrees C), moderate HS (31 degrees C) and severe HS (37 degrees C) for 21 days each in a psychrometric chamber.

Adverse tem-peratures can decrease mating success and sperm transfer, leading to increased sex ratio (more males) in pop-ulations of haplodiploid organisms. We tested the effect of five temperatures on the reproduction of the egg parasitoid Anaphes listronoti. Temperatures above and below 24.5 degrees C decreased mating success by 30\%-80\%. Mating failures can arise from lack of encounters between sexes, absence of courting by the male, or the female refusing to mate. Both courtship and copulation duration decreased with increasing temperature. For mated females, there was no effect of mating temperature on offspring number and sex ratio. However, the increased number of virgin females at adverse temperatures did modify the simulated population sex ratio of the next generation, which increased from 0.2 at 24.5 degrees C to 0.4, 0.5, 0.4 and 0.8 at 15.7 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C and 35 degrees C, respectively.

Thus, tracking the temperature at the targeted site during thermal therapy is essential to avoid unnecessary damage to the neighbouring tissues. Therefore, to avoid difficulties in the experimental in-vivo analysis of the human body, more and more priority has been given to computational modelling. Dual-phase lag bioheat transfer modelling is one that pioneers the biological heat transfer problem to a new horizon where the non-Fourier approach makes the model near realistic. The present paper has developed a numerical model based on the Local Thermal Non-Equilibrium Bioheat Transfer model, as the phase lag values directly depend on the biological tissues' thermophysical properties. Besides the effect of vasodilation and vasoconstriction, metabolic heat generation, as well as muscle shivering, are also considered in the present numerical model. A modified spatial Gaussian heat distribution function has been adapted to model the external heat source and destroy the targeted tissue inside the skin layers. A numerical code is developed using MATLAB in a finite difference approach, which can evaluate the temperature data in an anisotropic medium like human skin.

In this study we tested the cold tolerance of the indigenous Drosophila pupal parasitoids Pachycrepoideus vindemmiae and Trichopria drosophilae at constant low temperature in the laboratory and exposed different preimaginal parasitoid stages in the field during winter. We evaluated whether semi-natural habitats promote overwintering via more favorable microclimatic conditions as well as higher host availability compared to orchards. Further, we studied the parasitoids' phenology in a semi-field experiment during autumn. We found that P. vindemmiae larvae and pupae were most cold tolerant under laboratory and field conditions, while all preimaginal stages of T. drosophilae displayed similar cold tolerance. Semi-natural habitats buffered temperature extremes, yet overwintering survival was not enhanced compared to orchards. Suitable overwintering hosts were present in all habitats at times when parasitoids were still active parasitizing. These results demonstrate that P. vindemmiae overwinters most likely as larva or pupa and that T. drosophilae can overwinter in a preimaginal life stage. Further, we provide evidence that both parasitoids can overwinter in a wide range of habitats and that the availability of hosts for overwintering is unlikely a limiting factor for the parasitoids during fall.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103231,106,NA,NA,103231,Hibernation; Semi-natural environment; Drosophila suzukii; Biological control agent; Pteromalidae; Diapriidae

Oxidative stress and fluid-salt balance are tightly associated with thermotolerance and productivity in domestic animals. The study aimed to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to oxidative stress and ion-channel regulation and their associations with semen quality and hormonal responses. In total, 28 SNPs within 11 candidate genes were identified to associate with hormonal changes and semen quality in both broiler-and layer-type Taiwan country chickens (TCCs) after exposure to acute heat stress at 38 C for 4 h. Acute heat stress significantly affected plasma levels of triiodothyronine and corticosterone and reduced sperm motility, viability, and concentrations in both strains at Day 1 after exposure. In the B-strain TCCs, five SNPs within NDUFA8 and DAB2IP had significant effects on plasma adrenaline and corticosterone levels, and six SNPs within TRPC1, SLC9A9, and TRPC7 markedly affected plasma corticosterone and triiodothyronine levels. In the L2 strain, 15 SNPs within PSMA2, TPK1, MTF1, and CUL1 exerted effects on plasma corticosterone and triiodothyronine levels. Five SNPs within CUL3, TRPC1, and SLC9A9 in the B strain and two SNPs within MTF1 in the L2 strain were associated with sperm concentrations at Day 1 after exposure to heat stress. In conclusion, acute heat stress impaired semen quality and altered plasma corticosterone and triiodothyronine levels in TCCs.

Charles and Eady, Paul E.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Sexual selection theory has proven to be fundamental to our understanding of the male-female (sperm-egg) interactions that characterise fertilisation. However, sexual selection does not operate in a void and abiotic environmental factors have been shown to modulate the outcome of pre-copularory sexual interactions. Environmental modulation of post-copulatory interactions are particularly likely because the form and function of primary reproductive traits appears to be acutely sensitive to temperature stress. Here we report the effects of developmental temperature on female reproductive architecture and the interaction between male and female developmental temperature on the outcome of sperm competition in the bruchid beetle Callosobruchus maculatus. When females were reared at developmental temperatures above and below typical temperatures the bursa copulatrix (site of spermatophore deposition) were smaller and, were either shorter and broader (high temperatures) or longer and thinner (low temperatures) than those reared at intermediate temperatures. Males and females reared at low developmental temperatures were less likely to mate than those reared at higher temperatures. Where copulation occurred, females reared at the highest temperature copulated for longest, whilst males reared at the lowest temperature spent longer in copula. Male developmental temperature had a significant impact on the outcome of sperm competition: males reared at 17 degrees C were largely unsuccessful in sperm competition against control (27 degrees C) males, although some of the variation in the outcome of sperm competition was a product of the interaction between male and female developmental temperature. Our results demonstrate that male-female interactions that characterise pre- and post-copulatory outcomes are sensitive to developmental temperature and that plasticity in cryptic female preferences could lead to heterogeneous selection on the male reproductive phenotype.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103155,103,NA,NA,103155,NA
article,Effect of fatigue strength exercise on anterior thigh skin temperature rewarming after cold stress test,"Munoz-Alcami, Mireia and Ignacio Priego-Quesada, Jose and Gimeno Raga, Marc and Duran Lozano, Alvaro and Gil-Calvo, Marina",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Although dynamic thermography skin temperature assessment has been used in medical field, scientific evidence in sports is scarce. The aim of the study was to assess changes in anterior thigh skin temperature in response to a cold stress test after a strength exercise fatiguing protocol. Ten physically active adults performed a familiarization session and two strength exercise sessions, one with dominant and the other with non-dominant lower limb. Participants performed bouts of 10 concentric and eccentric contractions of leg extensions in an isokinetic device until reaching around 30\% of force loss. Infrared thermographic images were taken at baseline conditions and after the fatigue level from both thighs after being cooled using a cryotherapy system. ROIs included vastus medialis, rectus femoris, adductor and vastus lateralis. Skin temperature rewarming was assessed during 180s after the cooling process obtaining the coefficients of the following equation: Delta Skin temperature = beta(0) + beta(1) {*} ln (T), being beta(0) and beta(1) the constant and slope coefficients, respectively, T the time elapsed following the cold stress in seconds, and Delta Skin temperature the difference between the skin temperature at T respect and the pre-cooling moment. Lower beta(0) and higher beta(1) were found for vastus lateralis and rectus femoris in the intervention lower limb compared with baseline conditions (p < 0.05 and ES > 0.6). Adductor only showed differences in 130 (p = 0.01 and ES = 0.92). The regressions models obtained showed that beta(0) and beta(1) had a direct relationship with age and muscle mass, but an inverse relationship with the number of series performed until 30\% of fatigue (R-2 = 0.8). In conclusion, fatigue strength exercise results in a lower skin temperature and a faster thermal increase after a cold stress test.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103098,101,NA,NA,103098,Dynamic thermography; Infrared thermography; Isokinetic exercise; Thermal image
article,Divergent incubation temperature effects on thermal sensitivity of hatchling performance in two different latitudinal populations of an invasive turtle,"Kang, Chun-Quan and Meng, Qin-Yuan and Dang, Wei and Lu, Hong-Liang",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The incubation temperature for embryonic development affects several aspects of hatchling performance, but its impact on the thermal sensitivity of performance attributes remains poorly investigated. In the present study, Trachemys scripta elegans hatchlings from two different latitudinal populations were collected to assess the effects of different incubation temperatures on the locomotor (swimming speed) and physiological (heart rate) performances, and the thermal sensitivity of these two attributes. The incubation temperature significantly affected the examined physiological traits. Hatchling turtles produced at low incubation temperature exhibited relatively higher cold tolerance (lower body temperatures at which the animals lose the ability to escape from the lethal conditions), and reduced heart rate and swimming speed. Furthermore, the effect of incubation temperature on the thermal sensitivity of swimming speed differed between the low- and high-latitude populations. At relatively high incubation temperatures, the high-latitude hatchling turtles exhibited reduced thermal sensitivities of swimming speed than those of the low-latitude ones. Reduced thermal sensitivity of locomotor performance together with high cold tolerance, exhibited by the high-latitude hatchling turtles potentially reflected local adaptation to relatively colder and more thermally-variable environments.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103079,100,NA,NA,103079,Trachemys scripta elegans; Incubation temperature; Thermal sensitivity; Hatchling performance; Heart rate

The aim of this study was to assess the nest temperatures of an American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) population on the central coast of Oaxaca state in Mexico. The fieldwork was carried out from February to June 2018 at Palmasola Lagoon, Oaxaca. Ten natural nests of C. acutus were carefully excavated to determine clutch size. When putting the eggs back in the nests, we placed a data logger in the center of the egg mass to determine the temperature parameters in the nest chamber environment, as well as the variation in temperature during the incubation period. All nests were revisited to count the number of hatched eggs (NHE) and to determine the hatching success (HS), along with the duration of the incubation period (IP). Hatching success was 89.04\%. The mean clutch size in the American crocodile nests was 30.7 +/- 7.83 eggs (ranging from 17 to 46 eggs), and the mean incubation period was 77.6 +/- 5.89 days. The mean nest incubation temperature throughout the reproductive season was significantly different among nests. Based on the average temperature during the middle third of the incubation period, the nests should have produced both sexes, but with a higher proportion of males. This study tried to elucidate the impact of nest temperatures during the incubation period on embryo survival, as well as hatchling sex ratio in a local climate on the central coast of Oaxaca.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103012,99,NA,NA,103012,Population ecology; Clutch size; Embryo survival; Incubation temperature; Sex ratio
article,Emerging evidence for the opposite role of circulating irisin levels and brown adipose tissue activity measured by infrared thermography in anthropometric and metabolic profile during childhood,"De Meneck, Franciele and de Souza, Livia Victorino and Brioschi, Marcos Leal and Franco, Maria do Carmo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Irisin is an adipomyokine that increases browning of adipose tissue and thermogenesis, thereby protecting against obesity and insulin resistance. However, the correlation between irisin, brown adipose tissue (BAT), and childhood obesity, as well as its association with an increased risk of developing metabolic diseases, has not been completely elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the association between irisin levels and BAT activity measured by infrared thermography among children and verify their correlation with anthropometric and metabolic parameters. This study included 42 children with normal weight and 18 overweight/obese children. Anthropometric data, irisin levels, lipid and glucose profile were evaluated. The percentage of the thermally active portion of the supraclavicular area (\%AreaSCR) before and after a cold stimulus was measured by infrared thermography, and the differences between the percentages of thermally active (Delta\%AreaSCR) was calculated as an index of BAT activation. The results were correlated with anthropometric and metabolic parameters. Circulating irisin levels was positive correlated with age (rho=0.327, P=0.011), body mass index (BMI) (rho=0.707, P<0.001), waist circumference (rho=0.624, P<0.001), total cholesterol (rho=0.361, P=0.044), triglycerides (rho=0.419, P=0.001), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) (rho=0.381, P=0.003). Active BAT was negatively correlated with BMI, waist circumference, triglycerides, LDLc and irisin levels. We observed that normal weight children increased significantly the Delta\% Area(SCR) as compared to overweight/obese children. In conclusion, circulating irisin levels and BAT activity appear to have opposing roles, since normal weight children had greater BAT activity and lower circulating levels of irisin.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103010,99,NA,NA,103010,Irisin; brown adipose tissue; Infrared thermography; Children; Obesity

People exposed to extremely cold exposure could suffer the threats of human health and safety like cold stress and injury. This study aims to investigate human physiological responses of exposure to extremely cold environments and the moment of temperature step. The experiments of 12 subjects exposed to three different cold exposure conditions (-5 degrees C, -10 degrees C, -15 degrees C) were carried out in a climate chamber. Most critical physiological parameters, including the core temperature, local skin temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate and blood oxygen saturation, were measured to evaluate human physiological responses. In the particular short term study, the results show that the local skin temperature and blood pressure are the most significant indexes for evaluating the risk of cold strain in extremely cold environment. The finger temperature is a critical index of hand and finger flexibility, and it will lead to serious injuries and reduced manual performance when exposed to below -5 degrees C for more than 20 min. The high physiological strain at the very beginning moment of cold exposure can significantly affect the ability to make correct judgment and action, and it is suggested that the personnel adapt for 3 min after entering into the extremely cold environment to stabilize physiological parameters and thus enhancing the safety and occupational performance.

The pest has invaded many countries, causing considerable impact on fruit production systems and commercialization. In this study we determined the relationship between temperature and development, survival and reproductive parameters of B. dorsalis on an artificial diet under laboratory conditions under 7 constant temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 33 and 35 degrees C) with 70 +/- 10\% relative humidity and a photoperiod of L12:D12. We validated the laboratory results with a full life table analysis under semi-natural conditions in a screenhouse. We used the Insect Life Cycle Modeling (ILCYM) software for all mathematical models and simulations applied to all life history parameters. Bactrocera dorsalis completed its development at temperatures ranging between 15 and 33 degrees C with the mean developmental time of egg, larva, and pupa ranging between 1.46 and 4.31 days, 7.14-25.67 days, and 7.18-31.50 respectively. The models predicted temperatures ranging between 20 and 30 degrees C as favorable for development and survival, and 20 to 25 degrees C for optimal fecundity of B. dorsalis. Life table parameters showed the highest gross reproductive rate (GRR), net reproductive rate (R-o), intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)), and finite rate of increase (lambda) between 25 and 31 degrees C while generation time (T) and doubling time (D-t) were low at this interval.

P. and Nehra, Anil Kumar",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Heat stress is an important environmental determinant which adversely affects the performance of poultry worldwide. The present communication reviews the impact of heat stress on production, reproduction and growth performance of poultry, and its alleviation using genetic strategies. The adverse effects of high environmental temperature on poultry include decrease in growth rate, body weight, egg production, egg weight, egg quality, meat quality, semen quality, fertility and hatchability, which cause vast financial losses to the poultry industry. High ambient temperature has an antagonistic effect on performance traits of the poultry. Thus, selection of birds for high performance has increased their susceptibility to heat stress. Additionally, heat burden during transportation of birds from one place to another leads to reduced meat quality, increased mortality and welfare issues. Molecular markers are being explored nowadays to recognize the potential candidate genes related to production, reproduction and growth traits for selecting poultry birds to enhance thermo-tolerance and resistance against diseases. In conclusion, there is a critical need of formulating selection strategies based on genetic markers and exploring more genes in addition to HSP25, 70, 90, H1, RB1CC, BAG3, PDK, ID1, Na, F, dw and K responsible for thermoregulation, to improve the overall performance of poultry along with their ability to tolerate heat stress conditions.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102867,97,NA,NA,102867,Climate change; Heat stress; Poultry; Production; Reproduction; Mitigation

Goals of this study were: (1) to evaluate cattle thermal comfort in agroforestry systems with different shade availability (2) to verify the spatiotemporal variations of infrared temperature inside agroforestry systems, and; (3) to test infrared ther-mography as a potential tool to assess animal thermal comfort indices in agroforestry systems. A trial was carried out between June 2015 and February 2016, covering Central-Brazil's dry winter and rainy summer seasons, respectively. The experimental area of Embrapa Beef Cattle is located in Campo Grande (Mato Grosso do Sul), coordinates 20 degrees 24'53 `' S, 54 degrees 42'26 `' W and 558 m altitude. The 12 ha plot has two agroforestry systems varying shade availability. Traditional Black Globe Temperature and Humidity Index, Heat Load Index and Radiation Thermal Load were determined, from measurements using digital thermo-hygrometers, with datalogger. Surface temperature and humidity of tree canopies and pasture were determined using an infrared thermographic camera. Results show spatiotemporal variations in infrared temperature. This means that the environment inside agroforestry systems is not homogeneously comfortable for cattle, and the system with the lowest shade avail-ability has the greatest heat accumulation area. Weak to strong associations were identified between infrared variables and thermal comfort indices (0.08 = r <= 0.75). Positive relationships were also obtained and equally well explained by the Black Globe Temperature and Humidity Index and Heat Load Index (0.55 = R-2 <= 0.94).

It occurs when the body cannot keep its temperature healthy in response to a hot climate and associated with oxidative stress. Testicular hyperthermia can induce apoptosis of sperm cells, affect sperm production and decrease sperm concentration, leading to sperm disorder, for this reason, we examined the protective impact of pycnogenol that it has a wide range of biological benefits, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities against the oxidative alterations that happen in testicular and brain tissues due to heat stress in rats. Study design: Forty-eight Wistar male rats, approximately around 6 weeks age were allocated randomly into four groups (12 in each) of control, HS (subjected to heat stress and supplemented orally with 50 mg of pycnogenol/kg b. w./day dissolved in saline for 21 days), and pycnogenol (rats supplemented orally with 50 mg of pycnogenol/kg b. w./day dissolved in saline for 21 days). Results: Data revealed a promising role of pycnogenol as an antioxidant, natural product to successfully reverse the heat-induced oxidative alterations in testicular and brain tissues of rats through significant upregulation of superoxide dismutase-2, catalase, reduced glutathione, and anti-apoptotic gene, while downregulating proapoptotic, and heat shock protein70.

To occur in different regions where ambient temperature varies, animals must adopt appropriate thermoregulatory mechanisms. Failure to adjust to environmental challenges may result in species distributional range shifts or decreased viability. African mole-rats (Bathyergidae) occupy various habitats in sub-Saharan Africa from deserts to montane regions to mesic coastal areas. We examined thermoregulatory characteristics of three African molerat species originating from disparate (montane, savannah, and arid/semi-arid) habitats. Animals were exposed to various ambient temperatures, whilst core body temperature and the surface temperature of different body parts were measured. Oxygen consumption was determined as a measure of heat production. Core body temperatures of Natal (montane) mole-rats (Cryptomys hottentotus natalensis) increased significantly at ambient temperatures >24.5 degrees C, while those of the highveld (Cryptomys hottentotus pretoriae) (savannah) and Damaraland (Fukomys damarensis) (arid/semi-arid) mole-rats remained within narrower ranges. In terms of surface temperature variation, while pedal surfaces were important in regulating heat loss in Natal and Damaraland mole-rats at high ambient temperatures, the ventral surface was important for heat dissipation in Damaraland and highveld mole-rats. This study provides evidence of the variation and limitations of thermo-physiological mechanisms for three mole-rat species relative to their habitats.

article,Generalist grasshoppers from thermally variable sites do not have higher thermal tolerance than grasshoppers from thermally stable sites - A study of five populations,"Preston, Devin B. and Johnson, Steven G.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Thermal tolerance allows many organisms, including insects, to withstand stressful temperatures. Thermal generalists are expected to have higher thermal tolerance than specialists, but the environmental conditions leading to the evolution of a thermal generalist life history are not fully understood. Thermal variability has been put forth as an evolutionary driver of high thermal tolerance, but rarely has this been empirically tested. We used a generalist agricultural pest grasshopper, Melanoplus differentialis, to test upper and lower thermal limits of populations that experienced different levels of thermal variability. We quantified thermal heterogeneity at five sites in a longitudinal transect in the Midwestern U.S. by examining, over a 101-year period, 1) variance in daily thermal maxima and minima; and 2) daily range. Also, as a measure of a biologically relevant thermal extreme, we depicted days per month at each site that reached a stressfully high temperature for M. differentially. We collected individuals from these sites and tested their upper and lower thermal limits. We found that most of our metrics of thermal heterogeneity differed among sites, while all sites experienced an average of at least two stressfully high temperature events per month. We found that heavier males from these sites were able to withstand both warmer and colder temperatures than smaller males, while heavier females had no thermal advantage over lighter females. However, site of origin had no effect on thermal tolerance. Our findings indicate three things: 1) there is no clear correlation between thermal variability and thermal tolerance in the populations we studied; 2) weight affects thermal tolerance range among sites for M. differentialis males, and 3) thermal extremes may be more important than thermal variability in determining CTMax in this species.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102527,88,NA,NA,102527,Thermoregulation; Variability; Climate; Grasshopper; Melanoplus; Thermal tolerance

However, relatively little is known about how and if thermoregulatory behavior is used across life stages in small ectothermic insects. Here we investigate differences between three specialized Drosophila species from temperate, tropical or desert habitats and one cosmopolitan species by estimating the preferred temperature (T-pref) and the breadth (T-breadth) of the distribution of adults, adult egg-laying, and larvae in thermal gradients. We also assess the plasticity of thermal preference following developmental acclimation to three constant temperatures. For egg-laying and larvae, we observe significant species differences in preferred temperature but this is not predicted by thermal ecology of the species. We corroborated this with previous studies of other Drosophila species and found that T-pref for egg laying and larvae have no relationship with annual mean temperature of the species' natural habitat. While adults have the greatest mobility, they show the greater variation in preference compared to juveniles contradicting common assumptions. We found evidence of developmental thermal acclimation in adult egg-laying preferred temperature, T-pref increasing with acclimation temperature, and in the breadth of the temperature preference distributions, T-breadth decreasing with increasing acclimation temperature. Together, these data provide a high resolution and comprehensive look at temperature preferences across life stages and in response to acclimation. Results suggest that thermal preference, particularly in the early life stages, is relatively conserved among species and unrelated to temperature at species origin.

Laboratory based studies investigating the mechanisms of thermoregulation in marine ectotherms, however, rarely consider key temporal elements of thermal exposure, such as the rate at which temperature changes. We tested the hypothesis that juvenile seahorses, Hippocampus erectus, from a tropical coastal lagoon in Yucatan, Mexico, would exhibit variations in physiological and behavioural descriptors of thermoregulation when submitted to contrasting regimes during 30 days: temperature constant at 25 degrees C (C 25); gradually increasing 1 degrees C every 5 days from 25 to 30 degrees C (GI 25-30); and constant at 30 degrees C (C 30). Immediately after exposure, critical maximum temperature, thermal preference, oxygen consumption, partial energy balance, growth rate and survival of seahorses were measured. Seahorses exposed to GI 25-30 showed a significantly higher critical thermal maxima (37.8 +/- 0.9 degrees C), preference (28.7 +/- 0.4 degrees C), growth (1.10 +/- 0.49\%) and survival (97.6\%) than those exposed to C 30 (36.5 +/- 1, 29.4 +/- 0.3 degrees C, 0.48 +/- 0.32\%, 73.8\%, respectively). Both high temperature regimes induced metabolic depression, but ramping resulted in a greater amount of energy assimilated (278.9 +/- 175.4 J g(-1) day(-1)) and higher energy efficiency for growth (89.8\%) than constant exposure to 30 degrees C (115.4 +/- 63.4 J g (-1) day(-1), 65.3\%, respectively). Gradually increasing temperature allowed physiological mechanisms of thermal adjustment to take place, reflecting the capacity of juvenile H. erectus to respond to environmental change. Despite its advantage, this capacity is limited in time, since the cumulative effect of thermal exposure affected metabolic performance, eventually compromising survival. The study of seahorse response to thermal variations in the context of ocean warming needs to consider the temporal elements of thermal exposure to foresee its vulnerability under future scenarios.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102406,85,NA,NA,102406,Sea horses; Thermal biology; Plasticity; Metabolism; Ramping

Animals primarily use behavior to avoid overheating, but biologists' means for measuring and interpreting behavioral signs of stress require more development. Herein, we develop the measurement of behavioral thermal tolerance using four species of lizards. First, we adapt the voluntary thermal maximum concept (VTM) to facilitate its measurement, interpretation, and comparison across species. Second, we evaluate the sensitivity of the VTM to diverse measurement options (warming rate, time of day, etc) across four species with highly different life histories. Finally, we clarify the interpretation of VTM in two ways. First, we show the effects of exposure to the VIM on panting behavior, mass loss, and locomotor function loss of two species. Second, we compared the VIM with the preferred body temperatures (PBT) and critical thermal maximum (CTMAX) intraspecifically. We found that the VTM can be consistently estimated through different methods and methodological options, only very slow warming rates affected its estimates in one species. Exposure to the VIM caused panting between 5 and 50 min and induced exceptionally high mass loss rates. Loss of locomotion function started after 205 min. Further, the VTM did not show intraspecific correlations with the PBT and CTMAX. Our study suggests the VTM is a robust and flexible measure of thermal tolerance and highlights the need for multispecies evaluations of thermal indices. The lack of correlation between the VIM, the PBT and CTMAX suggests the VIM may evolve relatively free between the other parameters.

We used three constant, viz. cold, optimum and hot (15 degrees C, 27 degrees C and 35 degrees C); two fluctuating with variation in mean temperature of the day (15 degrees C/27 degrees C, 35 degrees C /27 degrees C; 10/14 h) and three alternating (15 degrees C/27 degrees C, 35 degrees C/27 C, 15 degrees C/35 degrees C; 24/24 h) temperatures to evaluate their effects on these life attributes. Oviposition and percent egg viability along with offspring development (immature life stages developmental time and developmental rate) and elytral colouration pattern of adults were observed. The best response in terms of oviposition and percent egg viability was recorded at the constant temperature of 27 degrees C followed by the fluctuating regime with a mean temperature of 30.3 degrees C. The fastest development was found at a constant temperature of 35 degrees C, followed by a fluctuating temperature of 35 degrees C/27 degrees C for 10/14 h. Among the different temperature cycles, the most uncustomary trend of oviposition and percent egg viability was recorded on an alternate temperature of 15 degrees C/35 degrees C for 24/24 h. The constant (27 degrees C) and fluctuating (35 degrees C/27 C for 10/14 h) temperatures caused an incremental effect on reproductive output and developmental rate. This study demonstrates that M. sexmaculatus is able to adjust its physiology according to surrounding environmental conditions and acclimatizes well with the fluctuating/alternate temperatures suggesting its wide range of tolerance. The findings of present work would be helpful in augmenting population dynamics of this biocontrol agent to suppress insect pest.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.11.010,71,NA,180-188,NA,Temperature; Constant; Fluctuating; Alternate; Oviposition; Development
article,A stringent test of the thermal coadaptation hypothesis in flour beetles,"Halliday, William D. and Blouin-Demers, Gabriel",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Whole-organism performance depends on body temperature and ectotherms have variable body temperatures. The thermal coadaptation hypothesis posits that thermal reaction norms have coevolved with thermal preference such that organisms attain optimal performance under a narrow range of body temperatures commonly experienced in the wild. Since thermal reaction norms are often similar, researchers interested in the effects of temperature on fitness often use one easily measured thermal reaction norm, such as locomotor performance, and assume it is a good proxy for fitness when testing the thermal coadaptation hypothesis. The extent to which this assumption holds, however, is often untested. In this study, we provide a stringent test of the thermal coadaptation hypothesis in red and in confused flour beetles by comparing the thermal reaction norm for reproductive output to the preferred body temperature range. We also test the assumption that locomotor performance can serve as a proxy for the thermal reaction norm for reproductive output, a more ultimate index of fitness. In both species, we measured the number of eggs laid, righting time, and sprint speed at eight temperatures, as well as the thermal preference in a thermal gradient. The number of eggs laid increased with female sprint speed and with male righting time, and all three performances had similar thermal reaction norms, with 80\% of the maximum achieved between 23 and 37 degrees C. Red flour beetles had preferred body temperatures that matched the optimal temperature for performance; confused flour beetles had lower preferred body temperature than the optimal temperature for performance. We found support for the assumption that locomotor performance can serve as a proxy for reproductive output in flour beetles, but we only found evidence for thermal coadaptation in one of the two species.

This study investigates the effects of pregnancy status, seasonal variations, and diurnal shifts on the body temperature of different body parts in dairy cows. Using a structured approach, cows were categorized based on pregnancy status (pregnant vs. control) or estrous status (estrous vs. control), season (winter, spring, summer), and time of day (morning, noon, evening). The analysis revealed that pregnancy and estrous statuses significantly affect the body temperature, with pregnant and estrous cows displaying higher temperatures (39.+/- 0.03 and 38.+/- 0.06 degrees C, respectively) than controls (37.1 f 0.06 degrees C; p < 0.01). Seasonal impacts were also notable, with the highest temperatures observed in summer (38.3 f 0.07 degrees C) followed by spring (38.1 +/- 0.09 degrees C) and winter (37.7 +/- 0.06 degrees C; p < 0.01), indicating a strong environmental influence on physiological responses. Furthermore, diurnal analysis indicated temperature fluctuations throughout the day, peaking at noon (38.1 +/- 0.09 degrees C; p < 0.05) compared to morning and evening. High positive correlations were observed between the measured temperatures in different areas and rectal and vaginal temperatures, suggesting the skin surface is ideal for assessing thermal changes. These findings underscore the critical interplay between an animal's physiological state and external environmental factors in managing dairy cow health and reproduction. The study highlights the potential of non-invasive temperature monitoring as a tool for optimizing reproductive management and underscores the necessity of accounting for environmental and physiological variations in dairy management practices.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103972,125,NA,NA,103972,Infrared thermography; Estrus detection; Pregnancy detection; Dairy cows; Body temperature variations
article,"Heat hardening improves thermal tolerance in abalone, without the trade-offs associated with chronic heat exposure","Abbas, Ahmed S. A. and Collins, Michael and Ellis, Robert and Spicer, John I. and Truebano, Manuela",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Marine animals are challenged by chronically raised temperatures alongside an increased frequency of discrete, severe warming events. Exposure to repeated heat shocks could result in heat hardening, where sub-lethal exposure to thermal stress temporarily enhances thermotolerance, and may be an important mechanism by which marine species will cope with future thermal challenges. However, we have relatively little understanding of the effects of heat hardening in comparison to chronic exposure to elevated temperatures. Therefore, we compared the effects of heat hardening from repeated exposure to acute heat shocks and chronic exposure to elevated temperatures on thermal tolerance in the European abalone, Haliotis tuberculata. Adult abalones were exposed to either control temperature (15 degrees C), chronic warming (20 degrees C) or a regime of two events of repeated acute heat shock cycles (23-25 degrees C) during six months, and their thermal tolerance and performance, based upon cardiac activity, compared using a dynamic ramping assay. The cost associated with each treatment was also estimated via measurements of condition index (CI). Abalone exposed to both temperature treatments had higher upper thermal limits than the control, but heat-hardened individuals had significantly higher CI values, indicating an enhancement in condition status. Differences in the shape of the thermal performance curve suggest different mechanisms may be at play under different temperature exposure treatments. We conclude that heat hardening can boost thermal tolerance in this species, without performance trade-offs associated with chronic warming.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103963,124,NA,NA,103963,Stress conditioning; Frontloading; Ct(max); Heat shocks; Upper thermal limits; Heart rate; Thermal performance

Yet, this has been largely unexplored. To investigate whether and how the temperatures experienced by embryonic and larval stages affect their fitness at later developmental stages, we designed two experiments in which the embryos and larvae were treated with three temperatures (24, 18 and 12 degrees C), respectively. Then, the life history traits of the tadpoles during the metamorphotic climax in all treatments were evaluated, including growth rate, survival rate, morphology, thermal physiology, swimming performance, standard metabolic rate (SMR), oxidative and antioxidative system, and metabolic enzyme activities. The results revealed that elevated temperature accelerated metamorphosis but decreased body size at metamorphosis. Additionally, warming during the embryonic and larval stages decreased the thermal tolerance range and induced increased oxidative stress. Furthermore, high embryonic temperature significantly decreased the hatching success, but had no significant effect on swimming performance and SMR. Warming during larval periods was harmful to the survival and swimming performance of tadpoles. The effect size analysis revealed that the negative impacts of embryonic temperature on certain physiological traits, such as growth and development, survival and swimming performance, were more pronounced than those of larval temperature. Our results highlight the necessity for particular attention to be paid to the early stages of amphibians, notably the embryonic stages when evaluating the impact of global warming on their survival.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103895,123,NA,NA,103895,Temperature extremes; Larval development; Life history traits; Metamorphosis; Integrated biomarker response (IBR) index; Telomere length

For example, accentuated rises in TCORE caused by physical exercises under environmental heat stress increase the risk of heat illnesses. Thus, using valid and reproducible devices is essential to ensure safe sports practice. In this study, we assessed the validity and reproducibility of the Calera Research Sensor (CRS) in estimating the TCORE of male and female participants during cycling exercise in a hot environment. Seven male (age: 36.2 +/- 10.1 years) and eight female cyclists (age: 30.1 +/- 5.0 years) underwent two identical cycling trials in a dry-bulb temperature of 32 degrees C and relative humidity of 60\%. The protocol consisted of an initial 10-min rest followed by a 60-min exercise comprising 10 min at 20\%, 25 min at 55\%, and 25 min at 75\% of maximal aerobic power, and an additional 25 min of post-exercise recovery. TCORE was recorded simultaneously every minute using a gastrointestinal capsule (TGi) and the CRS (TSENSOR). Bland-Altman analysis was performed to calculate bias, upper (LCS) and lower (LCI) concordance limits, and the 95\% confidence interval (95\%CI). The maximum acceptable difference between the two devices was predetermined at +/- 0.4 degrees C. A mixed linear model was used to assess the paired differences between the two measurement systems, considering the participants, trials, and environmental conditions as random effects and the cycling stages as fixed effects. An intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.98 was recorded when analyzing data from the entire experiment. A non-significant bias value of 0.01 degrees C, LCS of 0.38 degrees C, LCI of -0.35 degrees C, and CI95\% of +/- 0.36 degrees C were found. When analyzing data according to the participants' sex, CRS reproducibility was high in both sexes: ICC values of 0.98 and 0.99 were reported for males and females, respectively. CI95\% was 0.35 degrees C in experiments with males and 0.37 degrees C with females, thereby falling within the acceptable margin of difference. Therefore, CRS was considered valid (compared to TGi) and reproducible in estimating TCORE in both sexes at various intensities of cycling exercise in the heat.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103907,123,NA,NA,103907,Physical training; Core temperature; Heatwaves; Heat illnesses; Human health

article,"Thermal sensitivity of digestion in Sceloporus consobrinus, with comments on geographic variation","Litmer, Allison R. and Beaupre, Steven J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Individual variation in energetics, environment, and genetics can influence population-level processes. However, it is often assumed that locally measured thermal and bioenergetic responses apply among broadly related species. Even closely related taxa may differ in the thermal sensitivity of performance, which in turn influences population persistence, population vital rates, and the ability to respond to environmental changes. The objectives of this project were to quantify the thermal sensitivity of digestive physiology in an Sceloporus lizards, to compare closely related, but geographically distinct, populations. Sceloporus lizards are a model organism, as they are known to exhibit thermally dependent physiologies and are geographically widespread. Digestive passage time, food consumption, fecal and urate production, metabolizable energy intake (MEI), and assimilated energy (AE) were compared for Sceloporus consobrinus in Arkansas and S. undulatus in South Carolina and New Jersey. Published data were acquired for NJ and SC lizards, while original data were collected for S. consobrinus. Comparisons of digestion among populations were made at 30 C, 33 C, or 36 C. Results suggest that digestive physiology differs among populations, with S. consobrinus being more efficient at warmer temperatures. In contrast, NJ and SC lizards had quicker passage times and lower fecal and urate production at 30 C in comparison to AR. The results of the current study exemplify how closely related organisms can differ in thermal sensitivity of performance. Such data are important for understanding how individual-level processes can vary in response to climate, with implications for understanding variation in physiological traits across the range of Sceloporus lizards.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103808,120,NA,NA,103808,Comparative; Bioenergetics; Ectotherm; Energy budget; Ecophysiology; Temperature

As a result, there is a growing body of research investigating the physiological and biological consequences of HS on these animals. Recent studies have specifically examined the effects of climate change, global warming, and HS on gametes. Heat stress has been shown to affect ram semen production, resulting in decreased sperm quality and volume in both fresh and stored samples. This is attributed to the effect of heat on hormone production in the testicles, which is critical for successful spermatogenesis. Such effects can have significant consequences on the fertility of female sheep, which could affect the farmers' revenue. Therefore, farmers and researchers are utilizing various strategies and laboratory techniques to mitigate these negative effects. This review aims to comprehensively evaluate the impact of HS on ram semen production and conservation and analyze the different mitigation strategies at various levels, including management and nutritional interventions.

Thus, finding a safe, effective and economical strategy to treat insulin resistance is urgently needed. This study aimed to investigate the effects of exercise combined with heat treatment on the insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle of diet-induced obese (DIO) rats. Obese rats were induced by a 10-week high-fat diet and were randomly divided into normal temperature + control (NC), normal temperature + exercise (NE), heat treatment + control (HC) and heat treatment + exercise (HE) groups for 7 weeks of incremental load endurance exercise and heat treatment (exposure to a high-temperature environment room). At the end of the 7-week intervention, we measured fasting blood glucose, serum fasting insulin, serum leptin, serum adiponectin, protein expression of HSF1/HSP27 and JAK2/STAT3 pathway in soleus (primarily composed of slow-twitch fibres) and extensor digitorum longus (primarily composed of fast-twitch fibres) muscles. The results showed that exercise combined with heat treatment can effectively improve insulin resistance by regulating HSF1/HSP27 and JAK2/STAT3 pathways in the slow-twitch muscle of DIO rats. Importantly, exercise combined with heat treatment is more effective in improving insulin resistance in DIO rats than exercise or heat treatment alone.

In the present study, the nymphal development time, sex ratio and wing dimorphism of the small brown planthopper Laodelphax striatellus were examined under the conditions of constant temperatures, naturally varying temperatures (or different generations), and different temperatures combined with different photoperiod. The results showed that from 18 to 28 degrees C, the developmental time of nymphs was gradually shortened with the increase of temperature, whereas the high temperatures of 30 and 32 degrees C in the third to fifth instar nymphal stages and high summer temperature of 28.8 and 29.7 degrees C significantly delayed developmental time and resulted in higher mortality of nymphs. In all treatments, the developmental time was longer in females than males. The nymphs took significantly longer time to develop in the short daylength of 12 h than in longer daylengths of 13, 14, 15 and 16. Differences in developmental time were also found between wing morph, with long-winged individuals being significantly longer than the short-winged individuals at lower temperatures and significantly shorter than the short-winged individuals at higher temperatures. In all treatments, the sex ratio was stable, approaching 1:1, without being affected by temperature, generations and photoperiod. Photoperiod and temperature had significantly influence on the wing dimorphism. Long daylength combined with different temperatures resulted in significantly higher proportions of long-winged morph, whereas the low temperatures combined with the short daylengths in autumn and winter resulted in significantly high proportion of short-winged morph.

The investigation was conducted in 48 patients, who were subdivided into four groups (n = 12). Two subgroups were healthy patients and two with Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome. For the diagnosis of the syndrome, a manual evaluation was performed using the Zohlen test and Q angle measurement. Subsequently, cold stress was applied for 10 min to a healthy subgroup and an experimental subgroup. The remaining two subgroups were subjected to heat stress for 15 min. Thermographic images of the lower extremities were acquired at seven time points, at baseline, immediately after application of thermal stress and then every 3 min until 15 min were completed. It was observed that patients presented Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome bilaterally. After statistical analysis, it was found that there were no significant differences in baseline temperature between the groups. However, for heat stress, a higher temperature was observed in the group with Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (p < 0.05) in the recovery period, and in the case of cold stress, only a lower temperature in the left knee immediately after the application.

The two frog species were isolated from the field during summer and hibernation time in winter. During hibernation it was notable the destitution of degenerated, pyknotic and vasogenic neurons in different brain areas with high rate nearby the pallium. The immunohistochemical expression of Na+/ K+-ATPase and Pax 6 is decreased during hibernation in different brain sub-regions in the two species suggesting their tendency for energy conservation strategy during hibernation. Additionally, RT-qPCR recorded the up regulation of a number of heat shock protein genes during hibernation with sharing increase between two species for hsp90 besides and the non-significant expression in summer and hibernation periods for hsp47 for both species.

article,Tolerance of high temperature and associated effects on reproduction in euedaphic Collembola,"Xie, Liyan and Slotsbo, Stine and Holmstrup, Martin",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Studies show that tropical and mid-latitude terrestrial ectotherms are more vulnerable to global warming than species from high latitudes. However, thermal tolerance studies from these regions still lack soil invertebrates. In the present study, we investigated six euedaphic species of Collembola (of the genera Onychiurus and Prota-phorura) sampled across latitudes ranging from 31 degrees N to 64 degrees N and determined their upper thermal limit (UTL) by static assays. In another experiment, we submitted springtails to high temperatures for exposure times, causing 5\% to 30\% mortality within each species. Survivors from this series of increasing heat injuries were used to determine the time-to-first-oviposition and the number of eggs produced following heat exposure. Two hy-potheses are tested in this study: 1) heat tolerance of species correlates positively with the environmental temperature of their habitat; 2) the most heat-tolerant species require less time to regain reproduction and produce more eggs than the least heat-tolerant species. Results showed that the UTL positively correlates to the soil temperature of the sampling site. The sequence of UTL60 (the temperature causing 50\% mortality after 60 min of exposure) from highest to least was O. yodai > P. fi mata > P. armata approximate to P. tricampata > P. macfadyeni > P. pseudovanderdrifti. Heat stress inflicted on springtails can delay reproduction in all species, and two species showed a reduced egg production rate after heat exposure. For heat stress causing up to 30\% mortality, the most heat-tolerant species did not have advantages over the least heat-tolerant species for what concerns the recovery of reproduction. The relation between UTL and recovery from heat stress is not linear.

Among them, the thermal variation of the ipsilateral foot and the thermal asymmetry variation between feet at each minute assessed and the starting time for each region of interest, were fed into 4 different machine learning classifiers: an Artificial Neuronal Network, K-Nearest Neighbours, Random Forest, and a Support Vector Machine.Results: All classifiers presented an accuracy and specificity higher than 70\%, sensitivity higher than 67\%, and AUC higher than 0.73, and the Artificial Neuronal Network classifier performed the best with a maximum accuracy of 88\%, sensitivity of 100\%, specificity of 84\% and AUC of 0.92, using 3 predictors.Conclusion: These results suggest thermal data retrieved from plantar feet combined with a machine learningbased methodology can be an effective tool to automatically classify LSBs performance.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103523,113,NA,NA,103523,Infrared thermography; Medicine; Complex regional pain syndrome; Sympathetic ganglia
article,Heat flux systems for body core temperature assessment during exercise,"Daanen, Hein A. M. and Kohlen, Veerle and Teunissen, Lennart P. J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Heat flux systems are increasingly used to assess core body temperature. However, validation of multiple systems is scarce. Therefore, an experiment was performed in which three commercially available heat flux systems (3 M, Medisim and Core) were compared to rectal temperature (Tre). Five females and four males performed exercise in a climate chamber set at 18 degrees C/50\% relative humidity until exhaustion. Exercise duration was 36.3 +/- 5.6 min (mean +/- standard deviation). Tre in rest was 37.2 +/- 0.3 degrees C. Medisim's-values were lower than Tre (36.9 +/- 0.4 degrees C, p < 0.05); 3 M (37.2 +/- 0.1 degrees C) and Core's (37.4 +/- 0.3 degrees C) did not differ from Tre. Maximal temperatures after exercise were 38.4 +/- 0.2 degrees C (Tre), 38.0 +/- 0.4 degrees C (3 M), 38.8 +/- 0.3 degrees C (Medisim) and 38.6 +/- 0.3 degrees C (Core); Medisim was significantly higher than Tre (p < 0.05). The temperature profiles of the heat flux systems during exercise differed to varying degree from the rectal profiles; the Medisim system showed a faster increase during exercise than Tre (0.48 +/- 0.25 degrees C in 20 min, p < 0.05), the Core system tended to show a systematic overestimation during the entire exercise period and the 3 M system showed large errors at the end of exercise, likely due to sweat entering the sensor. Therefore, the interpretation of heat flux sensor values as core body temperature estimates should be done with care; more research is required to elucidate the physiological significance of the generated temperature values.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103480,112,NA,NA,103480,Rectal temperature; Thermometry; Accuracy; Skin temperature

We compared the thermal niches of an invasive and native ant species. The Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) is an invasive species that has spread to Medi-terranean climates worldwide, where it is associated with losses in native arthropod biodiversity. In northern California, long-term surveys of ant biodiversity have shown that the winter ant (Prenolepis imparis) is the native species best able to coexist with Argentine ants. Both species tend hemipteran scales for food, and previous research suggests that these species' coexistence may depend on seasonal partitioning: winter ants are active primarily in the colder winter months, while Argentine ants are active primarily in the warmer months in northern California.We investigated the physiological basis of seasonal partitioning in Argentine and winter ants by a) measuring critical thermal limits, and b) comparing how ant walking speed varies with temperature. While both species had similar CTmax values, we found differences between the two species' critical thermal minima that may allow winter ants to remain functional at ecologically relevant temperatures between 0 and 2.5 degrees C. We also found that winter ants' walking speeds are significantly less temperature-dependent than those of Argentine ants. Winter ants walk faster than Argentine ants at low temperatures, which may allow the winter ants to remain active and forage at lower winter temperatures. These results suggest that partitioning based on differences in temperature tolerance promotes the winter ant's continued occupation of areas invaded by the Argentine ant.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103392,111,NA,NA,103392,Climate variability hypothesis; Invasive species; Thermal tolerance; CTmax; CTmin; Niche
article,Gender differences in thermal sensation and skin temperature sensitivity under local cooling,"Zhao, Qiantao and Lyu, Junmeng and Du, Heng and Lian, Zhiwei and Zhao, Zisheng",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Local cooling has proven to be an alternative to traditional comfort air conditioning to ensure users' thermal comfort while conserving energy. Few studies have investigated the gender differences in the applicable cooling temperatures and the applicable cooling locations and the differences in the sensitivity of skin temperature to thermal sensation under local cooling. Based on the design of orthogonal experiment, nine chamber experiments were conducted through different combinations of ambient temperature, cooling temperature, and cooling location. The subjective questionnaires and objective measurements were obtained in each experimental case. The results showed that the ambient temperature and the cooling location significantly affect the human overall thermal sensation of both genders under local cooling, while cooling temperature and cooling location signifi-cantly affect the local thermal sensation. For female, a neutral thermal sensation can be achieved by cooling the back at 24-26 degrees C when the ambient temperature is 31 degrees C. Back cooling at 22-26 degrees C is effective for male when the ambient temperature is 28 degrees C and 31 degrees C, and sole cooling with a higher cooling temperature is more acceptable at 34 degrees C. Moreover, female skin temperature is more sensitive to thermal sensation than that of males under local cooling. The upper arm skin temperature is most sensitive to thermal sensations for female, while the forearm skin temperature is most sensitive for male.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103401,111,NA,NA,103401,Local cooling; Gender difference; Thermal sensation; Skin temperature
article,Effects of multiple indoor environmental factors on anaerobic exercise performance,"Shi, Yongxiang and Lian, Zhiwei and Hu, Shengqian and Hu, Yingying",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Indoor stadium is an important place for physical exercise and sports practice, but few studies have considered the impact of indoor environment on exercise performance. Anaerobic exercise refers to exercise with high load intensity and instantaneous intensity. Many kinds of exercise performance are closely related to anaerobic exercise. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the influence of temperature, relative humidity and CO2 concentration on anaerobic exercise performance. Sixteen healthy participants (21.5 +/- 3.5 years) performed Wingate anaerobic test in 9 cases under the orthogonal experimental design. Temperature is a significant factor affecting peak power (p < 0.05) and average power (p < 0.05). The peak power at 22 degrees C and 25 degrees C is 5.4\% and 5.1\% higher than that at 28 degrees C, and the average power at 22 degrees C and 25 degrees C is 4.2\% and 4.3\% higher than that at 28 degrees C. Besides, temperature affected overall environmental satisfaction before and after exercise (p < 0.005, p < 0.005) as well as ear temperature in sedentary state and after warm-up exercise (p < 0.005, p < 0.005). The range of 22 degrees C-25 degrees C is closer to the neutral temperature, and it is suitable for anaerobic exercise.

The types of enriched environments used were: 1) without environmental enrichment (control); 2) classical music;3) PET plastic bottles with corn;4) suspended tires;5) logs of wood; and 6) all objects simultaneously. The air temperature, black globe tempeature and humidity index, and radiant heat load were higher (P < 0.05) during treatment with all objects simultaneously. The respiratory rate (RR) was higher (P = 0.001) in the control treatment compared to those with environmental enrichment. The rectal temperature (RT) was higher in the control and acoustic groups (P < 0.05), however it was lower with all objects. The coat surface temperature (CST) was higher (P < 0.01) in the control group and lower in the treatment with music, tires, logs of wood, PET bottles and all objects. The behaviors lying down, drinking water, urination, ruminating while standing, and defecating were similar (P > 0.05) between treatments.

article,Capacity for thermal adaptation in Nile tilapia (<i>Oreochromis niloticus</i>)<i>:</i> Effects on oxygen uptake and ventilation,"Leonard, Jonas Ndau and Skov, Peter Vilhelm",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Standard metabolic rate (SMR) and maximum metabolic rate (MMR) were determined for Nile tilapia acclimated to six different experimental temperatures from 18 degrees C to 38 degrees C. SMR increased exponentially with temperature, from 79.8 mg O-2 kg(-1) h(-1) at 18 degrees C, to 255.1 mg O-2 kg(-1) h(-1) at 38 degrees C (Q(10) = 1.79). The main increase in Q(10) occurred within the highest temperature range, whereas in the lower temperature from 18 degrees C to 22 degrees C, temperature did not significantly affect SMR. MMR showed a hyperbolic correlation with increasing temperature, rising from 240.5 mg O-2 kg(-1) h(-1) at 18 degrees C to a peak of 373.8 mg O-2 kg(-1) h(-1) at 30 degrees C, before decreasing again at higher temperatures. Absolute aerobic scope (AAS) peaked at 26.0 degrees C, which we conclude to be the optimal temperature for Nile tilapia. The optimal temperature range, defined as the thermal range where 80\% or more of the metabolic scope (MS) can be maintained, occurred between 19.5 and 32.1 degrees C. The lower (TCMIN) and upper (TCMAX) critical temperatures occurred at 13.1 degrees C and 38.8 degrees C. Nile tilapia showed a 4-fold scope for increasing ventilation frequency from 24 opercular beats min(-1) (OB min(-1)) during SMR at 18 degrees C, to a maximum of 100 OB min(-1) which occurred during MMR at 34 degrees C. f(V) during MMR increased with temperature, but above 30 degrees C became uncoupled with MO2, as fish were unable to sustain their rates of oxygen consumption despite a high f(V). There was a strong correlation between f(V) and SMR (r(2) = 0.83) across all temperatures indicating that fV is a good predictor of SMR. However, the correlation between MMR and f(V) was weak (r(2) = 0.06), due to a strong interacting effect of temperature. When selecting data from the thermal optimum range, a good correlation between f(V) and MO2 was obtained (r(2) = 0.74).",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103206,105,NA,NA,103206,Nile tilapia; Temperature; Metabolic rate; Ventilation; Aerobic scope; Thermal optimum
article,"Low activity levels are an adaptation to desert-living in the Grey Falcon, an endotherm that specializes in pursuing highly mobile prey","Schoenjahn, Jonny and Pavey, Chris R. and Walter, Gimme H.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Endothermic animals that live permanently in hot deserts must avoid harmful hyperthermia when their body temperature increases from heat gained through external and internal sources. This is true particularly for en-dotherms that are exclusively diurnal. We investigated the Grey Falcon (Falco hypoleucos), a predatory Australian endemic restricted to the hot arid/semi-arid zone. To understand how this species' entire population persists exclusively and permanently in this extreme environment we examined its activity levels and compared these with equivalent variables from the Peregrine Falcon (F. peregrinus), a cosmopolitan species that inhabits similar environments without being restricted to them. Further, we compared, across a selected group of Falco species, specific plumage characteristics (measured on museum specimens) that we anticipated would enhance the Grey Falcons' ability to cope with high heat loads. We found no morphological or physiological characteristics that would allow them to cope with heat better than other birds, but the chicks seem to have unusually high thermal tolerances. Grey Falcons do, however, possess a suite of unusual behavioural adaptations that, as we propose, enable them to cope with climatic extremes in arid environments. Specifically, throughout their lives Grey Falcons keep activity levels and thus physical exertion low. This behaviour contrasts strikingly with that of the Peregrine Falcon, which also actively hunts birds in flight. Keeping activity levels low is expected to minimize endogenous heat production and thus ease the Grey Falcon's thermoregulation during periods of high heat load. These birds may rely on low levels of relative humidity for efficient evaporative cooling, and this may explain their absolute restriction to hot arid/semi-arid zones.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103108,103,NA,NA,103108,Arid environment; Behavioural adaptation; Falco hypoleucos; Hyperthermia; Morphological adaptation

For this, we investigated the time course of changes in critical thermal tolerance thresholds and associated hepatic and renal transcript abundance of molecular markers related to cellular stress response, during high temperature acclimation. The experimental fish were initially acclimated to 17 degrees C and later exposed to a gradually raised elevated temperature regime (22 degrees C) for a period of 30 days. CTmax, CTmin and mRNA expression of candidate markers were examined before the thermal challenge (T0) and over the time-course (days) of high temperature exposure (T1, T3, T7, T15 and T30). With respect to organismal response, CTmax was significantly elevated at T3, but the degree of gain in heat tolerance was not persistent. Contrarily, we observed a gradual loss in cold tolerance with highest CTmin estimate at T30. Based on the time-course of mRNA expression, the studied markers could be categorized into those which were persistently elevated (hsp70a, hsp70b, hspa5, hsp90a, hsp90b, stip1 and serpinh1 in kidney and hsp90b in liver); those which concurred with changes in CTmin (hspbp1, hsp90b, stip1, gr1, hif1a, hyou1, tnfa and tlr5 in kidney); and those which concurred with changes in CTmax (hsp90a, serpinh1, tlr5 and lmo2 in liver). Apparently, transcriptional changes in kidney and liver reflected CTmin and CTmax trend, respectively. Expression profile of stip1 and tlr5 suggest that they are potential novel markers which could reflect thermal limits in rainbow trout. Hepatic metabolic markers were either initially elevated (alt, glud, g6pase1) or down-regulated at different time-points (ast2, gls1, fas, cpt1b, mtor), linked to gluconeogenesis and metabolic depression, respectively.

article,Effect of menstrual cycle and female hormones on TRP and TREK channels in modifying thermosensitivity and physiological functions in women,"Uchida, Yuki and Izumizaki, Masahiko",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Thermoregulation is crucial for human survival at various ambient temperatures. Transient receptor potential (TRP) and TWIK-related K+ (TREK) channels expressed in sensory neurons play a role in peripheral thermosensitivity for temperature detection. In addition, these channels have various physiological roles in the skeletal, nervous, immune, vascular, digestive, and urinary systems. In women, the female hormones estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4), which fluctuate during the menstrual cycle, affect various physiological functions, such as thermoregulation in hot and cold environments. The present review describes the effect of female hormones on TRP and TREK channels and related physiological functions. The P4 decreased thermosensitivity via TRPV1. E2 facilitates temporomandibular joint disease (TRPV1), breast cancer (TRPM8), and calcium absorption in the digestive system (TRPV5 and TRPV6), inhibits the facilitation of vasoconstriction (TRPM3), nerve inflammation (TRPM4), sweetness sensitivity (TRPM5), and menstrual disorders (TRPC1), and prevents insulin resistance (TRPC5) via each channel. P4 inhibits vasoconstriction (TRPM3), sweetness sensitivity (TRPM5), ciliary motility in the lungs (TRPV4), menstrual disorder (TRPC1), and immunity (TRPC3), and facilitates breast cancer (TRPV6) via each channel as indicated. The effects of female hormones on TREK channels and physiological functions are still under investigation. In summary, female hormones influence physiological functions via some TRP channels; however, the literature is not comprehensive and future studies are needed, especially those related to thermoregulation in women.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103029,100,NA,NA,103029,Menstrual cycle; Estradiol; Progesterone; TRP channels; TREK channels
article,Functional and post-translational characterization of pyruvate dehydrogenase demonstrates repression of activity in the liver but not skeletal muscle of the Richardson's ground squirrel (Urocitellus richardsonii) during hibernation,"Green, Stuart R. and Storey, Kenneth B.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Hibernation consists of a series of physiological and biochemical alterations in an animal that allows for reduced body temperatures down to near ambient levels and substantial fuel conservation allowing it to survive on stored fat supplies accumulated during the summer. The Richardson's ground squirrel is one such hibernator that undergoes such changes for as long as 9 months of the year. This study examines the role of regulation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) during hibernation in the skeletal muscle and liver of the Richardson's ground squirrel. The current study demonstrates a great reduction in the activity of PDC in the hibernating liver, but not in the skeletal muscle. This was matched by a significant increase in the phosphorylation on a regulatory serine residue (S300) of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) E1 alpha subunit. Examining the expression patterns of the relevant kinases for PDH and the associated phosphatase demonstrated some unexpected results. Specifically, an increase in PDKs 1 and 2 and a decrease in PDK4 was noted in the skeletal muscle tissue in response to hibernation and no alterations in the expression patterns of any of these enzymes were noted in the liver. This suggests that alternative modes of regulation of the kinases may be at play in hibernation to bring about the observed effects. Taken together this study demonstrates that PDH regulatory responses differ markedly between tissues and emphasize the importance of inhibition of the complex in the liver during hibernation.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102996,99,NA,NA,102996,PDH; Hibernation; Liver; Skeletal muscle; Metabolism; Phosphorylation
article,The effect of body surface area exposure to menthol on temperature regulation and perception in men,"Gillis, D. Jason and Moriarty, Jacob and Douglas, Nakiya and Ely, Brett R. and Silva, Kevin and Gallo, Joseph A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Introduction: In warm conditions topical application of menthol increases cool sensations and influences deep body temperature. The purpose of this experiment was to explore whether different body surface areas (BSA) exposed to menthol influence these responses. It was hypothesized that the forcing function exerted by menthol will be proportionally related to BSA. Method: Using a within-participant design, 13 participants underwent three BSA exposures (Small {[}S; finger]; Medium {[}M; arm]; Large {[}L; upper/lower body]) to 4.13\% menthol, and one Placebo exposure. During each exposure participants rested supine in a tent (30 degrees C, 50\%rh) for 30-min before their intervention and 30-min thereafter. Measures included thermal sensation, thermal comfort, irritation, skin blood flow (finger SkBF; laser Doppler flowmetry), rectal temperature (Tre), and skin temperature (chest, forearm, thigh, calf). The Area Under the Curve from minute 30 to 60 was calculated and analyzed using a one-way ANOVA or Friedman's test with post-hoc testing (0.05 alpha level). Results: There was no significant difference in any measure of thermometry (p > 0.05), while SKBF was significantly lowered in L, M, and S vs. P respectively (p < 0.05). Participants in L felt cooler vs. P and S (p < 0.05). Losses in thermal comfort were noted in L and M vs. P and S (p < 0.05), along with increased irritation in L vs. S (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Despite similar skin temperatures, larger BSA's exposed to menthol caused cooler sensations, likely due to the activation of a larger pool of menthol-sensitive neurons. This occurred in the absence of thermal discomfort and without perceptions of irritation exceeding `weak'. Larger BSA's also exhibited greater alterations in Tre, likely driven by a reduction in SkBF, but despite this mean body temperature was regulated suggesting the thermoregulatory system can cope with the range of BSA exposures studied herein.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102982,99,NA,NA,102982,Menthol; Body surface area; Thermal sensation; Thermal comfort; Irritation; Thermoregulation; Skin blood flow

Seventeen competitive-level male athletes performed a 20-km cycling time trial before (TT-PRE), immediately after (TT-POST1) and one week after (TT-POST2) a 5-day acclimation training program, including either RPE-regulated intermittent (HA-HIT, N = 9) or fixed and low-intensity (HA-LOW, N = 8) training sessions in the heat (39 degrees C; 40\% relative humidity). Total training volume was 23\% lower in HA-HIT compared to HA-LOW. Physiological responses were evaluated during a 40-min fixed-RPE cycling exercise performed before (HST-PRE) and immediately after (HST-POST) heat acclimation. All participants in HA-LOW group tended to improve mean power output from TT-PRE to TT-POST1 (+8.1 +/- 5.2\%; ES = 0.55 +/- 0.23), as well as eight of the nine athletes in HA-HIT group (+4.3 +/- 2.0\%; ES = 0.29 +/- 0.31) without difference between groups, but TT-POST2 results showed that improvements were dissipated one week after. Similar improvements in thermal sensation and lower elevations of core temperature in HST-POST following HA-LOW and HA-HIT training protocols suggest that high intensity and RPE regulated bouts could be an efficient strategy for short term heat acclimation protocols, for example prior to the competition. Furthermore, the modest impact of lowered thermal sensation on cycling performance confirms that perceptual responses of acclimated athletes are dissociated from physiological stress when exercising in the heat.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102935,98,NA,NA,102935,Cycling; Skin temperature; Core temperature; Rate of perceived exertion; Thermal perception
article,Thermal dependence and individual variation in tonic immobility varies between sympatric amphibians,"Baskiera, Senka and Gvozdik, Lumir",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Tonic immobility (TI) is an important antipredator response employed by prey in the last stages of a predation sequence. Evolution by natural selection assumes consistent individual variation (repeatability) in this trait. In ectotherms, which experience variable body temperatures, TI should be repeatable over a thermal gradient to be targeted by natural selection; however, information on thermal repeatability of this trait is missing. We examined thermal repeatability of TI in juveniles of two sympatric amphibians, smooth (Lissotriton vulgaris) and alpine (Ichthyosaura alpestris) newts. Both species showed disparate TI responses to body temperature variation (13-28 degrees C). While the proportion of TI response was repeatable in both taxa, it increased with body temperature in alpine newts but was temperature independent in smooth newts. Duration of TI decreased with body temperature in both taxa but was only repeatable in smooth newts.

The aims of this study were 1) to describe the pattern of reticulo-rumen temperature and activity variation in nullipamus Gyr heifers close to calving, and 2) to evaluate the predictive potential of these traits for calving in Gyr heifers. Forty pregnant Gyr heifers that had calved between August and December 2017 at the Gettilio Vargas Experimental Station, Empresa de Pesquisa Agropecunria de Minas Gerais (Epamig), Brazil, were used. The animals received a rumen bolus to monitor reticulo-rumen temperature (Trr) and activity (Act) at intervals of 10 min. Mixed linear models were used. A decrease in Trr and an increase in Act were observed on the days preceding calving. Differences in Trr and Act were more evident during the final 21 and 11 h previous to calving compared to 14 days before calving, measured at the same time of day. There was a decrease of about 0.20 degrees C in Trr at the time of calving when compared to baseline (14 days before calving measured at the same time of day). Environmental variables, such as temperature and air humidity, as well as biological factors such as circadian rhythm, may influence the interpretation of the data. In conclusion, variations exist in the Trr and Act of Gyr heifers in the hours before calving, which is preceded by a decrease in Trr and an increase in Act.

A. and Guedes, Raul Narciso C. and Hashem, Ahmed S.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Insects face several (environmental) abiotic stressors, including low temperature, which cause the failure of neuromuscular function. Such exposure leads insects toa reversible comatose state termed chill-coma, but the consequences of this state for the organism biology were little explored. Here, the consequences of the chill-coma phase were investigated in two of the main stored product pest species - the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (larvae and adults) and the rice weevil Sitophilus oryzae (adults). For this purpose, a series of low-temperature shocks were used to estimate the chill-coma recovery time (CCRT), survival, nutrition and weight gain/growth of T. castaneum (larvae and adults) and S. oryzae, as well as the development of T. castaneum life stages. The relatively long CCRT was characteristic of beetle larvae, at different low-temperature shocks, and CCRT increased with decreasing temperatures and increasing exposure intervals for both pest species. The survival was little affected by the low-temperature shocks applied, but such shocks affected insect feeding and growth. Tribolium castaneum larvae was more sensitive than adults of both insect species. Moreover, the relative consumption and weight gain of S. oryzae adults were lower than those of T. castaneum adults and mainly larvae, while feeding deterrence was not affected by low temperature shocks, unlike food conversion efficiency. Low-temperature shocks, even under short duration at some temperatures, significantly delayed development. The lower the temperature and the higher the exposure period, the more delayed the development. Thus, the physiological costs of chill-coma are translated into life-history consequences, with potential implications for the management of this insect pest species in stored products and even more so on red flour beetles and rice weevils.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102774,94,NA,NA,102774,Stored pests; Chill-coma; Low-temperature shocks; Nutritional indices; Developmental time

The objectives were to verify the morphological and physiological responses related to adaptation to heat of taurine breeds raised under in Brazilian meteorological conditions in different seasons of the year and day periods, and to detect differences within and between breeds to know breed is most adapted. Measurements were made of 74 young bulls (n = 31 Angus; n = 43 Simmental) for the morphological traits: hair length (HL), number of hairs (NH), and coat thickness (CT); and for the physiological traits: respiratory rate (RR) and hair coat surface temperature (ST). The temperature-humidity index (THI) was calculated. The data were subjected to analyses of variance, cluster analysis, and principal component analysis (PCA). The THI (< 74) indicates thermal comfort. In the winter, the HL and CT higher than in the spring season (P < 0.0001) in both breeds. Angus exhibited higher HL and CT (P < 0.0001). Within each breed, the animals differed from one another for HL (P < 0.0005). In the spring, CT was similar between the breeds, differing only in the winter season. Angus had higher values (P < 0.0005) of RR and lower values (P < 0.0001) of ST. Both breeds had higher (P < 0.0001) RR and ST in the afternoon. PCA showed that NH and HL better explained variation in adaptation. In general, the breeds have similar morphological responses in the hottest months, but have different physiological responses; Simmental proves to be more physiologically resistant. The afternoon was more stressful than the morning, even though the animals were in a thermal comfort zone. Measuring traits related to hair coat is sufficient for effective evaluation of adaptation, and the season affects the morphological and physiological traits of taurine cattle raised.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.02.017,81,NA,162-169,NA,Adaptability; Tropical; Taurine cattle; Thermoregulation

We defused a heat (or cold) wave by a continuous variable indicating the number of successive days with temperatures above (or below) a given threshold. For heat wave, the threshold was set to the 95th or 99th percentile of the mean daily temperature distribution and for cold wave to the 1st or 5th percentile. We collected female cattle mortality data by type of production and age classes between 2001 and 2015 for 100 iso-hygro-thermal areas in France. We used time-series analyses to estimate the area-specific heat wave- and cold wave-mortality relationships. Then, we applied meta-analyses to pool area-specific effects at the country level for each definition of heat and cold wave. For each type of production and age classes, our models predicted symmetrical relationships between temperature and mortality, with a temperature range of minimum mortality located approximately between 15 and 20 Cm] in most categories. Outside that range, relative risks between 1.3 and 2.5 were estimated for extreme cold temperatures and relative risks between 1.1 and 1.5 were estimated for extreme hot temperatures depending on age categories and production type. Our results indicated that a prolonged exposure to high (or low) temperatures caused a significant increase on mortality (up to 40\% during heat waves and 23\% for cold waves, depending on type of production and age classes), in addition to the effect of extreme temperature alone. This additional mortality risk increased along with the duration and intensity of the exposure. Our results suggest that not discriminating the effect of the prolonged exposure to extreme temperature, may overestimate the effect of temperature alone on mortality.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.11.001,78,NA,374-380,NA,Cattle mortality; Heat wave; Cold wave; Distributed Lag Non-Linear Model; Time series
article,Limited differentiation of fundamental thermal niches within the killifish assemblage from shallow temporary waters,"Zak, Jakub and Reichard, Martin and Gvozdik, Lumir",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The coexistence of ectothermic species is enabled among other factors by the differentiation of their thermal niches. While this phenomenon is well described from deep temperate lakes, it is unclear whether the same pattern applies to temporary pools. In this study, we examined fundamental thermal niches in three coexisting annual killifish species Nothobranchius furzeri, N. orthonotus and N. pienaari from temporary pools in southern Mozambique. We hypothesized that the disparate thermal requirements of the three congeneric species are a candidate niche component that facilitates their local coexistence. We estimated species' thermal requirements as preferred body temperatures (T-pref) in a horizontal thermal gradient. Under thermal gradient conditions, sympatric killifish maintained their body temperatures within similar T-pref ranges despite some variation in mean T-pref. The daily variation in water temperature in their native habitats enables killifish to thermoregulate at least for part of the diurnal cycle. We conclude that the coexistence of African annual killifish species is possible without the differentiation of their fundamental thermal niches.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.10.015,78,NA,257-262,NA,Nothobranchius spp.; Preferred body temperature; Species coexistence; Temporary waters; Thermal gradient

Amphibian species are highly dependent on external weather conditions, and the effect of global warming on these has been evaluated recently. The Great Chilean frog (Calyptocephalella gayi) is an endemic, monotypic species and genus whose conservation status is considered Vulnerable because of high extraction pressure for human consumption, lack of regulatory measures and comprehension by its consumers. Their populations have also declined due to the loss and destruction of their habitats. C. gayi has not been considered as an object of physiological study, so this large species is not known as one that can adapt to current environmental changes. In this study we analyze the thermoregulatory capacity and{''} thermal efficiency of C. gayi to determine its potential for climatic adaptation. The results indicate that this species is strictly a thermal-conformer; its thermal efficiency and its ability to withstand high temperatures allow it to sustain itself under a climate change scenario, however, it has thermal constraints that do not allow it to withstand temperatures greater than 30 degrees C. By modeling its ontogenetic conditions mathematically, we project that the larvae are not in danger, although there is a group of around 4\% which is very close to 30 degrees C, which is the highest temperature recorded for the species. However, about 40\% of subadults and approximately 47\% of adult frogs will not survive the change of 7 degrees C projected for the following 85 years, which will affect future generations.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.07.001,69,NA,110-117,NA,Global warming; Heating rate; Critical thermal maximum; Mathematical modeling; Thermal tolerance
article,The role of nest surface temperatures and the brain in influencing ant metabolic rates,"Andrew, Nigel R. and Ghaedi, Behnaz and Groenewald, Berlize",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Thermal limits of insects can be influenced by recent thermal history: here we used thermolimit respirometry to determine metabolic rate responses and thermal limits of the dominant meat ant, Ir-idomyrmex purpureus. Firstly, we tested the hypothesis that nest surface temperatures have a pervasive influence on thermal limits. Metabolic rates and activity of freshly field collected individuals were measured continuously while ramping temperatures from 44 degrees C to 62 degrees C at 0.25 degrees C/minute. At all the stages of thermolimit respirometry, metabolic rates were independent of nest surface temperatures, and CTmax did not differ between ants collected from nest with different surface temperatures. Secondly, we tested the effect of brain control on upper thermal limits of meat ants via ant decapitation experiments ('headedness'). Decapitated ants exhibited similar upper critical temperature (CTmax) results to living ants (Decapitated 503 +/- 1.2 degrees C: Living 50.1 +/- 1.8 degrees C). Throughout the temperature ramping process, `headedness' had a significant effect on metabolic rate in total (Decapitated (V) over dot CO2 140 +/- 30 mu l CO2 mg(-1) min(-1): Living (V) over dot CO2 250 +/- 50 CO2 mg(-1) min(-1)), as well as at temperatures below and above CTmax. At high temperatures (>44 degrees C) pre-CTmax the relationships between I. purpureus CTmax values and mass specific metabolic rates for living ants exhibited a negative slope whilst decapitated ants exhibited a positive slope. The decapitated ants also had a significantly higher Q(10):25-35 degrees C when compared to living ants (1.91 +/- 0.43 vs. 1.29 +/- 0.35). Our findings suggest that physiological responses of ants may be able to cope with increasing surface temperatures, as shown by metabolic rates across the thermolimit continuum, making them physiologically resilient to a rapidly changing climate. We also demonstrate that the brain plays a role in respiration, but critical thermal limits are independent of respiration levels. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We measured individual body size and examined if predictions for the temperature-size rule (TSR) were valid for different temperatures. All three organisms investigated follow the TSR, but only over a specific range between minimal and optimal temperatures, while maintenance at temperatures beyond this range showed the opposite pattern in these taxa. We consider minimal and optimal temperatures to be species-specific, and moreover delineate a physiological range outside of which an ectotherm is constrained against displaying size plasticity in response to temperature. This thermal range concept has important implications for general size-temperature studies. Furthermore, the concept of `operating thermal conditions' may provide a new approach to (i) defining criteria required for investigating and interpreting temperature effects, and (ii) providing a novel interpretation for many cases in which species do not conform to the TSR.

article,"The effects of acute versus chronic training status on pacing strategies of older men in a hot, humid environment","Chia, Eevon and Cannon, Jack and Marino, Frank E.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The combined effects of age and training on the regulation of exercise performance may be confounded by the additional challenge of thermoregulation. Thus, the objective of this study was to compare the pacing strategy of older men who have recently completed 12 weeks of exercise training (acute) to men who have been regularly ( > 3 times/week) training for at least 6 months (chronic) in a hot, humid environment and to observe disparity, if any, between acute and chronic exercise training on thermo-regulation. Eleven chronically trained men (OT) completed a familiarisation trial before returning after 7-10 days to repeat the protocol. Similarly, eight untrained men (OU-PRE) were familiarised and repeated the protocol before completing 12 weeks of exercise training. Post-training, the eight acutely trained men (OU-POST) returned to the laboratory for a third trial. All trials were conducted on a cycle ergometer at the same time of the day in a climate controlled chamber with a mean dry bulb temperature and relative humidity of 32.0 degrees C and 68\%, respectively. OT consumed more water than OU-POST and OU-PRE (P < 0.01) whilst no differences were observed in the OU with training. Voluntary activation of the knee extensors decreased by 11.3\% (P < 0.05) in the OU-PRE after the cycling time trial. However, the decrease in voluntary activation observed in the OU-POST and OT after the cycling time trial were not significant The OT maintained a higher power output compared with the OU-POST and OU-PRE except for the last sprint, whilst no significant differences in power output were observed between the OU-PRE and OU-POST. The rate of rise in core temperature was significantly higher in the OT compared with OU-POST (P < 0.001) and OU-PRE (P < 0.001). With more experience in training, the OT used an alternative hydration strategy compared with the OU-POST and OU-PRE to mitigate the effects of possible exercise hyperthermia, ultimately attaining a higher, but non-critical core temperature at the end of the cycling time trial. Twelve weeks of exercise training may not manifest in improved exercise performance per se, but could translate to improved performance of activities of daily and independent living.

article,"Within the optimal thermal range, temperature fluctuations with similar means have little effect on offspring phenotypes: A comparison of two approaches that simulate natural nest conditions","Hall, Joshua M. and Tiatragul, Sarin and Turner, Mallory K. and Warner, Daniel A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature influences nearly every aspect of organismal function. Because aspects of global change such as urbanization and climate change influence temperature, researchers must consider how altering thermal regimes will impact biodiversity across the planet. To do so, they often measure temperature in natural and/or human modified habitats, replicate those temperatures in laboratory experiments to understand organismal responses, and make predictions under models of future change. Consequently, accurately representing temperature in the laboratory is an important concern, yet few studies have assessed the consequences of simulating thermal conditions in different ways. We used nest temperatures for two urban-dwelling, invasive lizards (Anolis sagrei and A. cristatellus) to create two egg incubation treatments in the laboratory. Like most studies of thermal developmental plasticity, we created daily repeating thermal fluctuations; however, we used different methods to create temperature treatments that differed in the magnitude and breadth of thermal cycles, and then evaluated the effects of these different approaches on embryo development and hatchling phenotypes. Additionally, we measured embryo heart rate, a proxy for metabolism, across temperature to understand the immediate effects of treatments. We found that treatments had minimal effect on phenotypes likely because temperatures were within the optimal thermal range for each species and were similar in mean temperature. We conclude that slight differences in thermal treatments may be unimportant so long as temperatures are within a range appropriate for development, and we make several recommendations for future studies of developmental plasticity.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103949,125,NA,NA,103949,Anolis; Cardiovascular physiology; Developmental plasticity; Egg incubation; Heart rate; Methodological choices

This, like many other effects of climate change, is especially concerning for cold-adapted ectotherms living in rapidly warming polar regions. This study examines the effects of warmer temperatures on cold-adapted Diptera, using the long-lived sub-Antarctic sphaerocerid fly, Anatalanta aptera, , as a focal species. We conducted two experiments to assess heat stress in adult flies, one varying the intensity of the heat stress (daily heating from 4 degrees C to 8 degrees C, 20 degrees C, or 24 degrees C) and one varying the frequency of heat stress exposure (heating from 4 degrees C to 12 degrees C every one, two, or three days) and examined consequences for reproductive success and metabolic responses. We found that more heat stress reduced reproductive output, but not timing of reproduction. Surprisingly, individuals sampled at different times during heat stress exposure were undifferentiable when all metabolite concentrations were analysed with redundancy analysis, however some individual metabolites did exhibit significant differences.

Typically, cold stimuli induce browning of white adipose tissue mediated by adrenaline, promoting non-shivering thermogenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying differential response of pig breeds to norepinephrine are unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the differences and molecular mechanisms of the effects of norepinephrine (NE) treatment on adipocytes of Min pigs (a cold-resistant pig breed) and Duroc-Landrace-Yorkshire (DLY) pigs. Real time-qPCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence were performed following NE treatment on cell cultures of adipocytes originating from Min pigs (n = 3) and DLY pigs (n = 3) to assess the expressions of adipogenesis markers, beige fat markers, and mitochondrial biogenesis markers. The results showed that NE did not affect browning of adipocytes in DLY pigs, whereas promoted browning of adipocytes in Min pigs. Further, the expression of ADRB1 (Adrenoceptor Beta 1, ADRB1) was higher in subcutaneous adipose tissue and adipocytes of Min pigs than those of DLY pigs. Overexpression of ADRB1 in DLY pig adipocytes enhanced sensitivity to NE, exhibiting decreased adipogenesis markers, upregulated beige fat markers, and increased mitochondrial biogenesis. Conversely, adipocytes treated with ADRB1 antagonist in Min pigs resulted in decreased cellular sensitivity to NE. Further studies revealed differential CpG island methylation in ADRB1 promoter region, with lower methylation levels in Min pigs compared to DLY pigs. In conclusion, differential methylation of the ADRB1 promoter region leads to different ADRB1 expression, resulting in varying responsiveness to NE in adipocytes of two pig breeds.

article,Effects of a high cholesterol diet on chill tolerance are highly context-dependent in Drosophila,"Allen, Mitchell C. and Ritchie, Marshall W. and El-Saadi, Mahmoud I. and MacMillan, Heath A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Chill susceptible insects are thought to be injured through different mechanisms depending on the duration and severity of chilling. While chronic chilling causes ``indirect{''} injury through disruption of metabolic and ion homeostasis, acute chilling is suspected to cause ``direct{''} injury, in part through phase transitions of cell membrane lipids. Dietary supplementation of cholesterol can reduce acute chilling injury in Drosophila melanogaster (Shreve et al., 2007), but the generality of this effect and the mechanisms underlying it remain unclear. To better understand how and why cholesterol has this effect, we assessed how a high cholesterol diet and thermal acclimation independently and interactively impact several measures of chill tolerance. Cholesterol supplementation positively affected tolerance to acute chilling in warm-acclimated flies (as reported previously). Conversely, feeding on the high-cholesterol diet negatively affected tolerance to chronic chilling in both cold and warm acclimated flies, as well as tolerance to acute chilling in cold acclimated flies. Cholesterol had no effect on the ability of flies to remain active in the cold or recover movement after a cold stress. Our findings support the idea that dietary cholesterol reduces mechanical injury to membranes caused by direct chilling injury, and that acute and chronic chilling are associated with distinct mechanisms of injury. Feeding on a high-cholesterol diet may interfere with mechanisms involved in cold acclimation, leaving cholesterol augmented flies more susceptible to chilling injury under some conditions.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103789,119,NA,NA,103789,Cold tolerance; Cholesterol; Acclimation; Insect; Fruit fly; Diet
article,"Elevational variation in metabolic rate, feeding capacity and their associations in the Asiatic toad Bufo gargarizans","Zhang, Yuechan and Tan, Song and Fu, Jinzhong and Chen, Jingfeng",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Foraging behavior is known to place demands on the metabolic characteristics of anurans. Active foragers feeding on sedentary prey typically have high aerobic capacity and low anaerobic capacity, whereas sit-and-wait foragers feeding on active and mobile prey have the opposite pattern. Thus, the energetic demands of foraging may influence their metabolic adaptations to harsh environments, such as high elevations. Anurans that engage in active foraging have been found to increase maximum metabolic rate (MMR) and aerobic scope (AS, the difference between MMR and resting metabolic rate, RMR) at high elevations. However, data are lacking in amphibian ambush foragers. In this study, we examined the RMR, MMR, AS, and feeding capacity of a sit-andwait forager the Asiatic toad (Bufo gargarizans), from two populations that are in close geographic proximity but differ by 1350 m in elevation. Our results show that there is no elevational variation in RMR and feeding capacity in either males or females. However, there are sex-specific variations in MMR and AS along an elevational gradient; females from high elevations have lower MMR and smaller net AS than their counterparts from low elevations while males maintain similar MMR and net AS across elevations. Furthermore, aerobic performances do not appear to be associated with feeding capacity at either the individual or population level. Our results support the hypothesis that sit-and-wait foragers may not increase their aerobic capacity as a strategy in hypoxic and low food availability environments and the role of sex in these adaptive adjustments should not be overlooked.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103788,119,NA,NA,103788,High elevation; Maximum metabolic rate; Resting metabolic rate; Feeding capacity; Ambush forager; Bufo gargarizans

Over the years, selection has ensured development of high producing breeds, however, the thermotolerance ability of animals has been largely overlooked. In the past decade, the ill effects of climate change have made it pertinent to rethink the selection strategies to opt for climate resilient breeds, to ensure optimum production and reproduction. This has led to renewed interest in evaluation of the impacts of heat stress on cows and the underlying mechanisms that results in their acclimatization and adaptation to varied thermal ambience. The understanding of heat stress and associated responses at various level of animal is crucial to device amelioration strategies to secure optimum production and welfare of cows.

The aim of this study was to assess effects of water restriction of lactating Alpine goats during the daytime at pasture (8 h/d) on herd-level drinking water intake and individual milk production and grazing time. Goats remained in the barn between evening and morning milkings, where each animal was offered 600 g of concentrate and 400 g of hay each day, with free access to water. Twenty four goats were used in a crossover design, for two consecutive 14-d periods. The study was conducted in early summer, with a daily mean ambient temperature of 18.2 +/- 3.5 degrees C (range of 13-27 degrees C over all the study days), a mean temperature-humidity index of 64 +/- 4.9 (range of 56-76). Goats had access to a high-quality multispecies pasture with a mean of 216 +/- 44 g DM/kg fresh matter. Total drinking water intake averaged 5.57 L/d and did not differ significantly between treatments. Goats with water access at pasture drank a mean of 1.88 L of water per day during the grazing period, but drank 2.24 L less per day in the barn than goats without water access at pasture. Drinking water intake increased by 0.57 L per day for each degrees C increase in daily mean ambient temperature. Daily milk production, milk composition, body weight, and daily grazing time did not differ between treatments. Only the duration of the first morning meal at pasture differed significantly between treatments. Thus, water restriction for 8 h per day during grazing periods does not seem to influence the variables measured for Alpine dairy goats under temperate conditions.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103720,117,NA,NA,103720,Dairy goat; Drinking; Temperature; Grazing pattern; Lifecorder

We thus monitored the operative temperature of the intertidal limpets Cellana toreuma in both emergent rock and tidal pool microhabitats from June to October 2021, determined the variations of upper thermal limits of short-term acclimated and long-term acclimated limpets from different microhabitats (emergent rock and tidal pool), and further calculated the relationship between the upper thermal limits and acclimation capacity. Our results indicated that living on the emergent rock, limpets encountered more extreme events in summer. For the short-term acclimated samples, limpets on the emergent rock exhibited obvious variations of sublethal thermal limit (i.e., Arrhenius Break Point of cardiac performance, ABT) during summer months, however, this variation of ABT was absent in the limpets in the tidal pool. After the laboratory long-term acclimation, the ABTs and FLTs (Flat Line Temperature of cardiac performance, as an indicator of lethal temperature) of limpets both on the rock and in the tidal pool increased significantly in October, implying the potential existence of selection during the hot summer. Our results further showed that environmental temperature was an important driver of phenotypic plasticity. This study highlighted the changes in the thermal tolerance of intertidal limpets during summer in different microhabitats.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103686,117,NA,NA,103686,Environmental selection; Intertidal zone; Microhabitat; Physiological plasticity
article,Effective practices for thermal tolerance polygon experiments using mottled catfish Corydoras paleatus,"Conte, Madison and de Campos, Derek Felipe and Eme, John",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature is an important environmental factor that affects how organisms allocate metabolic resources to physiological processes. Laboratory experiments that determine absolute thermal limits for representative species are important for understanding how fishes are affected by climate change. Critical Thermal Methodology (CTM) and Chronic Lethal Methodology (CLM) experiments were utilized to construct a complete thermal tolerance polygon for the South American fish species, Mottled catfish (Corydoras paleatus). Mottled catfish showed Chronic Lethal Maxima (CLMax) of 34.9 +/- 0.52 degrees C and Chronic Lethal Minima (CLMin) of 3.8 +/- 0.08 degrees C. Fish were chronically acclimated (similar to 2 weeks) to 6 temperatures ranging from 7.2 +/- 0.05 degrees C -> 32.2 +/- 0.16 degrees C (7 degrees C, 12 degrees C, 17 degrees C, 22 degrees C, 27 degrees C, and 32 degrees C), and CTM used to estimate upper and lower acute temperature tolerance. Linear regressions of Critical Thermal Maxima (CTMax) and Minima (CTMin) data with each acclimation temperature were used along with CLMax and CLMin to create a complete thermal tolerance polygon. The highest CTMax was 38.4 +/- 0.60 degrees C for fish acclimated to 32.2 +/- 0.16 degrees C, and the lowest CTMin was 3.36 +/- 1.84 degrees C for fish acclimated to 7.2 +/- 0.05 degrees C. Mottled catfish have a polygon measuring 785.7 degrees C-2, and the slope of the linear regressions showed the species gained 0.55 degrees C and 0.32 degrees C of upper and lower tolerance per degree of acclimation temperature, respectively. We compared slopes of CTMax or CTMin regression lines to each other using a set of comparisons between 3, 4, 5, or 6 acclimation temperatures. Our data demonstrated that 3 acclimation temperatures were as sufficient as 4 -> 6 to pair with estimates of chronic upper and lower thermal limits for accurately determining a complete thermal tolerance polygon. Construction of this species' complete thermal tolerance polygon provides a template for other researchers. The following is sufficient to generate a complete thermal tolerance polygon: Three chronic acclimation temperatures that are spread somewhat evenly across a species' thermal range, include an estimation of CLMax and CLMin, and are followed by CTMax and CTMin measurements.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103616,115,NA,NA,103616,Acclimation; Cessation of eating; Climate change; Critical thermal tolerance; Fish; Physiology; South America; Temperature

Temperature strongly influences the physiology and life cycle of mosquitoes and also the pathogens they transmit. Thermoregulatory behaviour of mosquitoes has been addressed in a few laboratory studies. Here, we expand such studies by investigating the thermal preference when resting of Aedes japonicus, an invasive and putative vector species of many pathogens, in a semi-field setup during summers in a temperate climate. Blood-fed or sugar-fed Ae. japonicus females were released in the late afternoon in a large outdoor cage containing three resting boxes. The next morning, temperature treatments were applied to the boxes, creating a ``cool{''} (over all experiments around 18 degrees C), and a ``warm{''} (around 35 degrees C) microhabitat in addition to an untreated ``ambient{''} (around 26 degrees C) one. The mosquitoes resting within the three boxes were counted five times, every 2 h between 9h and 17h. The highest proportions of mosquitoes (e.g. up to 21\% of blood-fed ones) were found in the cool box while both blood-fed and sugar-fed mosquitoes avoided the warm box. The mean resting temperatures of Ae. japonicus were below the ambient temperatures measured by a nearby meteorological station, and this was more pronounced at higher outdoor temperatures and in blood-fed as compared to sugar-fed mosquitoes. Thus, over all experiments with blood-fed mosquitoes, the calculated average resting temperature was 4 degrees C below the outdoor temperature. As mosquitoes prefer cooler resting places than temperatures measured by weather stations in summer, models to predict mosquito-borne disease outbreaks need to account for the thermoregulatory behaviour of mosquitoes, especially in the wake of climate change.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103592,114,NA,NA,103592,Aedes japonicus; Behaviour; Feeding state; Microclimate; Preference; Resting site; Semi -field; Temperature; Vector

They migrate annually in spring from low elevation locations in southern Australia to the Australian Alps where they aestivate during summer. As summer ends they make their return journey to the breeding grounds where they mate, lay eggs, and die. Given the moth's extreme behaviour in seeking out cool alpine habitat and with the knowledge that average temperatures at their aestivation sites are rising because of climate change, we first asked whether increased temperatures affect bogong moth activity during aestivation. We found that moth behaviour patterns changed from showing peaks at dawn and dusk with supressed activity during the day at cooler temperatures to near-constant activity at all times of day at 15 degrees C. Second, we asked whether moth mass changes after aestivating at different temperatures for a week due to dehydration or consumption of body energy reserves. We found that moth wet mass loss increased with increasing temperature, but found no difference in dry mass among temperature treatments. Overall, our results suggest that bogong moth aestivation behaviour changes with temperature and that it may be lost at around 15 degrees C. The impact of warming on the likelihood of individuals to complete their aestivation in the field should be investigated as a matter of priority to better understand the impact of climate change on the Australian alpine ecosystem.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103538,113,NA,NA,103538,Physiology; Climate change; Alpine; Migration; Conservation
article,Biased assessment of thermal properties of birds from estimated body density,"Eichenwald, Adam J. and Reed, J. Michael",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Parameter approximation is often necessary when calculating species thermal properties, and researchers his-torically have assumed animals are spherical when estimating volume and density. We hypothesized that a spherical model would result in significantly biased measures of density for birds, which are generally longer than they are tall or wide, and that these inaccuracies would significantly alter the outputs of thermal models. We calculated the densities of 154 bird species using sphere and ellipsoid volume equations and compared these estimates to one another and to published bird densities measured using more exact volume displacement methods. We also calculated evaporative water loss as a percentage of body mass per hour, a variable known to be critical for bird survival, twice for each species, once with the sphere-based density and once with the ellipsoid-based density. We found that volume and density estimates were statistically similar between published densities and those estimated using the ellipsoid volume equation, suggesting that this method is suitable for approximating bird volume and calculating density. In contrast, the spherical model overestimated body volume and therefore underestimated body densities. This resulted in the spherical approach consistently overestimating evaporative water loss as a percent of mass lost per hour than the ellipsoid approach. This outcome would result in mischaracterizing thermal conditions as lethal for a given species, including overestimating vulnerability to increased temperatures due to climate change.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103472,112,NA,NA,103472,NicheMapR; Thermal properties; Climate change; Global warming; Evaporative water loss; Morphometrics
article,Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase or cystathionine gamma-lyase abolishes leptin-induced fever in male rats,"Hristov, Milen and Lazarov, Lyudmil",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Leptin is an adipokine that regulates energy balance and immune function. Peripheral leptin administration elicits prostaglandin E2-dependent fever in rats. The gasotransmitters nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are also involved in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced fever response. However, there is no data in the literature indicating if these gasotransmitters have a role in leptin-induced fever response. Here, we investigate the inhibition of NO and H2S enzymes neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) in leptin-induced fever response, respectively. Selective nNOS inhibitor 7-nitroindazole (7-NI), selective iNOS inhibitor aminoguanidine (AG), and CSE inhibitor dl-propargylglycine (PAG) were administered intraperitoneally (ip). Body temperature (Tb), food intake, and body mass were recorded in fasted male rats. Leptin (0.5 mg/kg ip) induced a significant increase in Tb, whereas AG (50 mg/kg ip), 7-NI (10 mg/kg ip), or PAG (50 mg/kg ip) caused no changes in Tb. AG, 7-NI, or PAG abolished leptin increase in Tb. Our results highlight the potential involvement of iNOS, nNOS, and CSE in leptin-induced febrile response without affecting anorexic response to leptin in fasted male rats 24 h after leptin injection. Interestingly, all the inhibitors alone had the same anorexic effect induced by leptin. These findings have implications for understanding the role of NO and H2S in leptin-induced febrile response.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103443,112,NA,NA,103443,Leptin; Nitric oxide; Hydrogen sulfide; Sickness response; Fever; Anorexia
article,Revisiting geographic variation in melanism of monarch butterfly larvae in North America using iNaturalist photos,"Davis, Andrew K. and Nibbelink, Nate and Deneka, Christian J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Monarch butterflies in North America have an exceptionally large breeding distribution, occupying regions west of the Rocky Mountains and throughout the eastern seaboard. An experimental study conducted 17 years ago and published in this journal appeared to show that western monarch larvae tend to have smaller black stripes than those from eastern parents, which at the time was thought to be an adaptation to higher solar exposure in California. Here, we revisit this question by measuring melanism of eastern and western larvae from online photographs submitted to iNaturalist by members of the public. We downloaded over 500 photos of larvae from 10 different states (4 in the west, 6 in the east) and used image analysis to quantify the size of each larva's black stripes (\% of surface covered by black). We compared average melanism level between east and west, while also accounting for temperature (at the photo location), seasonal effects, and latitude. Results showed larvae tended to be darker with lower development temperatures, and later in the season, though there was no significant difference between eastern and western larvae in their degree of melanism. It is not yet clear why findings here were different from the prior experimental study. Also, the wild larvae appeared to be notably lighter in color than the captive-reared larvae of the original study, suggesting that the captive environment does not truly replicate the developmental experience of wild larvae, at least in terms of cuticular development. Thus, if there truly are innate tendencies for western larvae to differ (morphologically) from eastern, they are not observable in nature.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103374,110,NA,NA,103374,NA
article,Periorbital temperature responses to natural air temperature variation in wild birds,"Soravia, Camilla and Ashton, Benjamin J. and Ridley, Amanda R.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"With global temperatures rapidly increasing, biologists require tools to assess how wild animals are responding to heat. Thermal imaging of the eye region offers a potential non-invasive alternative to traditional techniques to study thermoregulation and stress responses in wild animals. However, we currently have a poor understanding of how the temperature of the eye region is regulated under increasing temperature and whether this regulation differs among individuals. Here, we use thermal imaging to repeatedly measure the maximum temperature of the eye region (periorbital temperature) in 42 wild pied babblers (Turdoides bicolor) under natural air temperatures ranging from 14.3 to 42.5 C. Our aim was to determine the relationship between periorbital temperature and air temperature, whether this relationship is repeatable, and whether it differs according to individual attributes. Periorbital temperature showed a non-linear increase with air temperature, becoming independent of air temperature above 38 ?. Above 38 ?, periorbital temperature was not explained by any individual attributes. Below 38 ?, periorbital temperature increased more steeply in individuals with low body mass and it was lower in older compared to younger females. However, the effect of these individual attributes was small compared to the effect of wind speed, air temperature and head tilt. Additionally, the repeatability of individual periorbital temperature was low (R < 0.25) and non-significant both below and above 38 ?. Our findings warrant caution in the use of periorbital temperature to infer individual thermoregulatory responses to increasing temperatures, especially in the wild, where control over confounding non-physiological factors is limited.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103323,109,NA,NA,103323,Thermography; Thermoregulation; Pied babbler; Heat stress; Climate change; Repeatability
article,A modified Kalman filter-based model for core temperature estimation during exercise and recovery with/without personal cooling interventions,"Rizvi, Ikhtedar Husain and Udayraj",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"One of the most important parameters to consider while analysing heat related illness is the human body core temperature. It is therefore required to monitor real-time core temperature in an ambulatory situation for in-dustrial workers, athletes, military personnel, and a variety of other people. As conventional methods of monitoring core temperature are unsuitable for ambulatory use or prohibitively expensive, it is necessary to develop a reliable, inexpensive and non-invasive method for real-time measurement of core temperature. Kalman filter based models for core temperature estimation are found promising to meet these requirements. In this work, we have highlighted one of the major shortcomings of the existing extended Kalman filter model and proposed a modification. The modified extended Kalman filter based model has better performance compared to the existing model in estimating the core temperature as it considers two separate measurement models for exercise and recovery periods. The proposed modified model is validated using human trials data which includes participants wearing regular clothing and different types of personal cooling clothing. It is found that the pro-posed modified model can predict core temperature more accurately (bias=-0.03 to -0.06?, LoA=+/- 0.14 - +/- 0.32?, and RMSE=0.09-0.16?) as compared to the existing model (bias=-0.03 - 0.08C, LoA=+/- 0.26 - +/- 0.33?, and RMSE=0.14?-0.18?). Personal cooling intervention minimises core temperature rise significantly and thus helps in heat stress mitigation. It is observed that the proposed modified model can estimate core temperature more accurately for cooling intervention cases and intermittent working cases as compared to the existing model. It can be used effectively in an ambulatory setting, but for situations where higher accuracy is required and invasiveness of the method is not a concern, direct contact method of core temperature is always preferred as the proposed model has varying accuracy levels between individuals.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103307,109,NA,NA,103307,Core temperature estimation; Kalman filter; Extended Kalman filter; Non-invasive method; Personal cooling clothing; Real-time monitoring

To date, however, the effects of climatic (temperature-humidity index, THI) and environmental factors (landscaping trees) on the enrichment of captive settings have not been studied. Therefore, the present study explored the effects of browsing enrichment on the licking behavior of captive giraffes. From May 2019 to February 2020, three giraffes in the Kyoto City Zoo, Japan, were observed for 270 h over two consecutive seasons (pre- and post-deciduous). Overall, branch foraging behavior and licking behavior were weakly and negatively correlated. In the pre-deciduous period, THI was significantly and negatively correlated with giraffe activity, and some individuals exhibited significantly reduced foraging behavior. Therefore, browsing enrichment under extreme heat may not improve giraffe rearing environments. Moreover, in the post-deciduous period, with decreased availability of leaves on landscaping trees, the non-branch foraging behavior of giraffes was significantly increased, with a corresponding significant increase in licking behavior. Therefore, landscaping trees affect the foraging behavior of captive giraffes.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103190,104,NA,NA,103190,Zoo; Environmental enrichment; Oral stereotypy; Animal welfare; Climate
article,Supercooling points of freeze-avoiding bumble bees vary with caste and queen life stage,"Keaveny, Ellen C. and Waybright, Sarah A. and Rusch, Travis W. and Dillon, Michael E.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Bumble bees thrive in cold climates including high latitude and high altitude regions around the world, yet cold tolerance strategies are largely unknown for most species. To determine bumble bee cold tolerance strategy, we exposed bumble bees to a range of low temperatures and measured survival 72 h post-exposure. All bees that froze died within 72 h while only one bee died without freezing, suggesting that bumble bees are generally freeze-avoiding insects and may be slightly chill susceptible. We then assessed whether temperatures that cause internal ice formation (supercooling points, SCP) varied among bumble bee castes (drones, workers, and queens), or across queen life stages, collection elevation, species, or season. Males froze at significantly lower temperatures than workers or queens. Queens in pre-overwintering or overwintering states froze at significantly lower temperatures than queens stimulated to initiate ovary development by CO2 narcosis (i.e., ``spring{''} queens). We also tested whether the presence of water (i.e., wet or dry) or ramping rate affected SCP. As expected, queens inoculated with water froze at significantly higher temperatures than dry queens. SCP tended to be lower, but not significantly so, at faster ramping rates (0.5 degrees C/min vs 0.25 degrees C/min). We also found no differences in SCP between queen bumble bees collected in spring and fall, between queens collected at two sites differing in elevation by 1100 m, or between three field-caught bumble bee species. Bumble bees appear to have relatively high, invariable SCPs, likely making them highly susceptible to freezing across all seasons. As bumble bees are not freeze-tolerant and appear to lack the ability to prevent freezing at temperatures much below 0 degrees C, they may rely on season- and caste-specific micro-habitat selection to thrive in cold climates.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103196,104,NA,NA,103196,Freeze avoidant; Chill susceptible; Overwintering; Bombus; Cold tolerance

Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is a marker of neuroplasticity usually increased as response to acute exposure to human body stressors. Objective: Effect of a repeated hyperthermia exposure programme on changes in circulating irisin and serum BDNF in healthy humans. Design: Setting, Participants: Randomized, single-blind, cross-over trial in healthy humans conducted at Sechenov University Physiology Laboratory from April 2019. The treatment period was 2 weeks (wash-out 3 weeks). Researchers analysing serum biomarkers and questionnaires data were blinded to participants allocation.

An animal's ability to tolerate warm weather is difficult to measure naturally due to environmental variability and genetic variation between animals. In this study we developed a thermo-tolerance indicator (TTI) to define heat stress tolerance in pregnant sheep in a controlled environment. Next, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genomic regions and target genes associated with thermo-tolerance in sheep. Pregnant ColumbiaRambouillet crossbred ewes (n = 127) were heat-stressed inside a climate-controlled chamber for 57 days by increasing the temperature-humidity index to >= 30. Rectal temperature (RT) and feed intake (FI) data were collected daily and used for the predictive TTI analysis. After the tenth day of heat stress, the regression analyses revealed that FI was stable; however, when the ewe's RT exceeded 39.8 degrees C their FI was less than thermo-tolerant ewes. This average predicted temperature was used to classify each ewe as heat stress tolerant (<= 39.8 degrees C) and non-heat stress tolerant ( 39.8 degrees C). A GWAS analysis was performed and genomic regions were compared between heat stress tolerant and non-tolerant ewes. The single-marker genomic analysis detected 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associated with heat stress tolerance (P < 0.0001), whereas the multi-marker Bayesian analysis identified 8 overlapped 1-Mb chromosomal regions accounting for 11.39\% of the genetic variation associated with tolerance to heat stress. Four intragenic SNP showed a remarkable contribution to thermo-tolerance, and these markers were within the genes FBXO11 (rs407804467), PHC3 (rs414179061), TSHR (rs418575898) and STAT1 (rs417581105). In conclusion, genomic regions harboring four intragenic SNP were associated with heat stress tolerance, and these candidate genes are proposed to influence heat tolerance in pregnant ewes subjected to an artificially induced warm climate. Moreover, these genetic markers could be suitable for use in further genetic selection programs in sheep managed in semi-arid regions.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103095,101,NA,NA,103095,Heat stress; Molecular markers; Sheep; SNP; Thermo-tolerance indicator

Several non-linear functions were fitted to model species development, mortality, longevity and oviposition using the Insect Life Cycle Modeling (ILCYM) software. The established phenology models were stochastically simulated at variable temperatures to estimate the life table parameters. Fopius arisanus completed development from egg to adult at all the temperatures tested except at 35 degrees C. Mean developmental time from egg to adult was inversely proportional to the temperature. The minimum temperature threshold (Tmin) from egg to adult was 8.15 degrees C, while the maximum temperature threshold (Tmax) was estimated at 34.2 degrees C. The optimal temperature for immature stages survival was predicted for 20-30 degrees C. The optimum fecundity estimated was 251 eggs/female at 22 degrees C. Following the stochastic simulations under natural conditions of the selected agro-ecological zones, it appears that the Humid Forest with Bimodal Rainfall provides a suitable thermal condition for potential population growth of F. arisanus.

We analyzed both intraspecific (in Magicicada cassinii (Fisher, 1852)) and interspecific relationships of the wing morphology and the ability of the cicadas to fly in a large number of North American cicada taxa (n=119). A total of 109 species and 10 subspecies from 17 genera, six tribes, and three subfamilies including all major North American habitats were studied. Analyses show that wing morphology (wing length, wingspan, wing area and wing loading) scales to body size as predicted by geometric similarity (all P<0.0001) for all species and wing area and wing loading (both P<0.0001) in M. cassinii. Mass (P=0.0105), wing length (P=0.0006), wingspan (P=0.0006), wing area (P=0.0055), and wing loading (P=0.0455) all demonstrate a significant correlation to MFT between species, as would be predicted by aerodynamic theory, but not within species.

We performed a quasi-experimental double-blind protocol in which 24 physically active healthy men were measured (age: 24.1 +/- 6.0 yrs; BM: 75.3 +/- 14.4 kg; HT: 171.8 +/- 5.9 cm; BMI: 25.5 +/- 4.9 kg/m(2)). Infrared thermography (IRT) protocol was used to separate the participants into the groups according to the BAT activation: high (HBAT; n = 11) and low (LBAT; n = 13). All participants ingested a single supplement caffeine capsule (CAF) of 375 mg (similar to 5 mg/kg BM) or placebo (PLA). Our experimental protocol measured two groups (HBAT and LBAT) under two conditions (CAF and PLA), with intake 30-min before the data collection. BAT activity lasted 60-min (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 min) and was estimated by IRT in subclavicular (Delta SCV) and external (Delta EXT) regions of interest (ROI) and EE by indirect calorimetry. The main results indicated that HBAT at 40-min showed an increased EE versus the other groups and conditions (p = 0.009). There was a significant difference for BAT activation at the 30 (p = 0.019), 40 (p = 0.009), 50 (p = 0.007) and 60 min (p = 0.012) between HBAT-CAF vs. LBAT-CAF. There was also a significant difference at the 20 (p = 0.024), 30 (p = 0.036), 50 (p = 0.05) and 60 min (p = 0.011) between HBAT-CAF vs. HBAT-PLA.

article,Losers can win: Thermoregulatory advantages of regenerated claws of fiddler crab males for establishment in warmer microhabitats,"De Grande, Fernando Rafael and Fogo, Bruno Rafael and Costa, Tania Marcia",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Fiddler crab males present a hypertrophied claw, which is used for sexual and aggressive displays, fights with competitors, and has been proposed as an important thermoregulatory organ for heat control. Two claw morphologies can be observed within fiddler crab populations: brachychelous claws (unregenerated) and leptochelous claws (regenerated). The leptochelous morphotype presents less muscle mass and longer fingers, resulting in a less advantageous weapon in fights. Considering their slender shape, we hypothesized that the leptochelous morphotype would present lower thermal inertia and be more efficient at body heat dissipation. We evaluated the role of the fiddler crabs' claw shape as a heat sink and how this influences their distribution between unshaded and shaded microhabitats. We tested in the field whether the proportion of adult male Leptuca uruguayensis with leptochelous claws was higher in unshaded microhabitats than shaded ones. In the laboratory, we tested if heat transfer between the body and claw is higher in leptochelous males than in brachychelous males. Spontaneous waving behaviour and active time above the surface were compared between both morphotypes in the field during the hottest period of the day. Leptuca uruguayensis with regenerated claws comprised more than 60\% of the sampled male population of unshaded microhabitats compared to 18\% in shaded microhabitats. Leptochelous males showed a mean heat transfer between body to claw 35\% higher than that observed for brachychelous males. During the hottest period of the day, brachychelous males waved approximately 28\% more than leptochelous males. Moreover, brachychelous males spent less time under the sediment surface since the surface temperature increased, while activity of leptochelous males was not associated with a temperature increase. Therefore, regenerated claws may be advantageous for the establishment of L. uruguayensis males in warmer and unshaded microhabitats because they are more efficient for heat loss and allow crabs to cool down, spending less time waving. Our study shows the relevant context of winners and losers in the face of climate change and highlights the importance of morphological variations in thermoregulatory structures for the occupation of thermal niches.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102952,99,NA,NA,102952,Claw shape; Thermoregulatory organs; Thermal niches; Differential distribution; Climate change

This study investigated the bedroom environment and sleep quality of 41 households during summer in Shanghai. Bedroom environments were comprehensively evaluated through environmental perception questionnaires filled by participants after waking up every morning. Parameters, such as air temperature, relative humidity, CO2 concentration, and noise level were continuously monitored. Furthermore, participants' sleep quality was observed using both subjective questionnaires and physiological measures. Environmental measurements showed that the most comfortable air temperature and relative humidity was 24.8 degrees C and 64\%, respectively. Physiological measurements showed that the average duration of slow wave sleep (SWS) and sleep efficiency (SE) was 73.8 min and 86.7\%, respectively. Additionally, SWS was negatively correlated with air temperature (r = -0.377, p = 0.015) and CO2 concentration (r = -0.362, p = 0.02), and SE was negatively correlated with noise level (r = -0.32, p = 0.042). The subjective and objective results consistently indicated that higher air temperature, CO2 concentration, and noise level leads to poor sleep quality in summer. In addition, air temperature and CO2 concentration had a greater impact on the sleep quality of males, while noise level had a greater impact on the sleep quality of females.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102977,99,NA,NA,102977,Bedroom environment; Gender difference; Physiological parameters; Sleep quality; Subjective questionnaire

In trial 1, blood samples collected from days 29 to 36 post insemination were examined for the comparison of PAG concentrations between winter (n = 3721) and summer (n = 2388). In trial 2, embryo losses were assessed in winter (n = 144) and in summer (n = 133), in days 31 or 32 of pregnancy. Pregnancy diagnosis was carried out by ultrasonography on days 24 or 25, and it was repeated a week later; in the second occasion PAG concentration was also determined. In trial 3 the PAG and progesterone concentrations were assessed in days 33 to 36 in winter and summer. In trial 1 PAG levels did not differ between winter and summer, the conception rate and the proportion of uncertain pregnancies were higher in winter than summer. The likelihood of pregnancy was 10 to 15\% higher in winter. In trial 2, the embryo death rate was higher in summer, but the PAG levels of cows that had embryo loss in summer were higher than those in winter. In both seasons, lower PAG levels were associated with higher risk of pregnancy loss, while embryo death was five times more likely to occur in summer than in winter and lower PAG concentrations were positively associated with higher risk of embryo loss. In trial 3, mean PAG levels were higher and of progesterone were lower during the summer than during the winter. We infer that despite the devastating effects of heat stress on cows' fertility, those early embryos that survive under continuous heat stress can form a well-functioning placenta; hence, the high embryo mortality rate observed during the summer months could be mainly attributed to luteal insufficiency.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102951,98,NA,NA,102951,Heat stress; Progesterone; Pregnancy associated glycoproteins; Embryo death; Cattle
article,Variation in upper thermal tolerance among 19 species from temperate wetlands,"Katzenberger, Marco and Duarte, Helder and Relyea, Rick and Beltran, Juan Francisco and Tejedo, Miguel",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Communities usually possess a multitude of interconnected trophic interactions within food webs. Their regulation generally depends on a balance between bottom-up and top-down effects. However, if sensitivity to temperature varies among species, rising temperatures may change trophic interactions via direct and indirect effects. We examined the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) of 19 species from temperate wetlands (insect predators, amphibian larvae, zooplankton and amphipods) and determined if they vary in their sensitivity to warming temperatures. CTmax differed between the groups, with predatory insects having higher CTmax than amphibians (both herbivorous larval anurans and predatory larval salamanders), amphipods and zooplankton. In a scenario of global warming, these differences in thermal tolerance may affect top-down and bottom-up processes, particularly considering that insect predators are more likely to maintain or improve their performance at higher temperatures, which could lead to increased predation rates on the herbivores in the food web. Further studies are needed to understand how the energy flows through communities, how species? energy budgets may change and whether other physiological and behavioral responses (such as phenotypic plasticity and thermoregulation) can buffer or increase these changes in the top-down regulation of wetland food webs.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102856,96,NA,NA,102856,Critical thermal maximum; Top-down regulation; Amphibians; Insects; Zooplankton; Climate change
article,Effects of L-proline on cellular responses of hen erythrocytes subjected to thermal stress,"Szabelak, Aleksandra and Bownik, Adam and Knaga, Sebastian and Kasperek, Kornel",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Little is known on the protective effects of L-proline on hen erythrocytes. The aim of the study was to determine the protective effects of this amino acid at concentrations of 50 ?g/mL, 100 ?g/mL, 200 ?g/mL in hen erythrocytes subjected to temperatures 41 ?C, 43 ?C and 45 ?C for 1 h and 4 h. The following cellular parameters were determined: viability, morphological alterations, caspase 3/7 activity, heat shock protein HSP70 1A activity and glutathione level. The results showed that exposure to 43 ?C and 45 ?C resulted in a decrease of viability and increased morphological alterations of the non-treated erythrocytes. Caspase 3/7 activity was increased only at 45 ?C, however HSP70 1A activity and glutathione level were increased in the temperature-dependent manner. On the other hand, erythrocytes additionally exposed to L-proline showed alterations of the parameters when compared to the non-treated cells. L-proline at 50 ?g/mL and 100 ?g/mL increased caspase 3/7 activity at both 41 ?C and 43 ?C, however it was less augmented at all the concentrations at 45 ?C. Glutathione level was decreased in heat-stressed (at 43 ?C and 45 ?C) hen erythrocytes treated with L-proline (at 50 ?g/mL and 100 ?g/ mL) but it was increased at 200 ?g/mL. HSP70 1A activity was augmented in a concentration- and temperaturedependent manner. The results indicate that proapoptotic or antiapoptotic effects of L-proline depend on its concentration and temperature of heat stress and thermoprotective effects induced by the amino acid on some parameters in hen erythrocytes may be a result of stimulation of antioxidative defense and stimulation of HSP70 1A activity.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102855,96,NA,NA,102855,L-proline; Hen erythrocytes; Heat stress; Apoptosis; Glutathione; HSP70

As indicators of the level of generated reactive oxygen species in thermal stress, we estimated midgut and hemolymph activity of the antioxidative enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), as well as the detoxifying enzymes glutathione S-transferase (GST), carboxylesterase (CaE) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) from the midgut and brain tissue. We also examined the influence of induced thermotolerance as a species? ability to overcome the negative effects of this stressor. In larvae originating from the unpolluted forest, the midgut is the primary location of increased SOD and CAT activity and induced thermotolerance did not modified their activity in either tissue. In larvae from the polluted forest, in both tissues SOD activity was more sensitive to an increased temperature and induced thermotolerance than CAT. Carboxylesterase responded diversely to thermal stress depending on the analyzed tissue regardless the origin of larvae, while the activity of GST and AChE in tissue depended on the origin of larvae. Induced thermotolerance modified the activity of detoxifying enzymes in larvae originating from the polluted forest.

However, the effect of RR on thermoeffector activity is not well established. Here we evaluated the effect of RR on cold-defense thermoeffectors induced by menthol, an agonist of the cold-sensitive TRPM8 channel. Adult male Wistar rats were used. Epidermal treatment with menthol raised deep body temperature due to an increase in oxygen consumption (an index of thermogenesis), a reduction in heat loss index (an index of cutaneous vasoconstriction), and an induction in warmth-seeking behavior in a two-temperature choice apparatus. Pretreatment with RR attenuated the menthol-induced increase in deep body temperature and oxygen consumption, but it did not affect heat loss index and warmth-seeking behavior. To stimulate brown adipose tissue thermogenesis, rats were treated with CL 316,243, a potent and selective beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist. CL 316,243 increased deep body temperature, which was attenuated by RR pretreatment. We conclude that RR reduces brown adipose tissue thermogenesis induced by menthol and CL 316,243, independent of effects at the thermal sensor level (i.e., TRPM8).",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102779,95,NA,NA,102779,"CL 316,243; Menthol; TRPM8; Thermoregulation"

Broiler breeder eggs were incubated from day 13 until hatching under cold (36 degrees C), control (37.5 degrees C), or hot (39 degrees C) temperatures. Under these conditions, the eggshell temperatures were 37.4 +/- 0.1 degrees C, 37.8 +/- 0.15 degrees C, and 38.8 +/- 0.3 degrees C, respectively. Then, broiler chicks were reared under control, preferred (determined previously in thermal preference test), or high temperatures. At day 42 of age, the broilers were weighed and euthanized, and femora and tibiotarsi collected to measure weight, length, diaphysis perimeter, breaking strength, maximum flexion, rigidity, ash, phosphorus, and calcium. Rearing under the preferred temperature did not affect broiler body weight or femoral and tibiotarsal characteristics (P > 0.05). In contrast, high rearing temperature, decreased the body weight, mineral contents of both bones, femoral breaking strength, and tibiotarsal rigidity (P < 0.05). Regarding incubation temperature effects, egg exposure to cold and hot temperatures during the fetal period minimized or avoided a few effects of high rearing temperature, such as those on femoral and tibiotarsal morphological characteristics, mineral composition, and mechanical properties at slaughter age (P < 0.05), but not all.

article,"The reproductive period of tarantulas is constrained by their thermal preferences (Araneae, Theraphosidae)","Oca, Laura Montes de and Perez-Miles, Fernando and Clavijo-Baquet, Sabrina",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Locomotor and physiological performance of ectotherms are affected by temperature. Thermoregulation is achieved by changes in behavior and the selection of micro-habitats with adequate temperatures to maintain the body temperature (Tb) within a range of preference. Apart from this temperature dependence at spatial scales, ectotherms are also affected by temperature at temporal scale. For instance, ectotherms can only be active some months of the year, particularly in temperate environments. Tarantulas are ectotherms that live in burrows most of their life. Nevertheless, after the sexual maturation molt, males leave their refugia and start a wandering life searching for females to mate. The reproductive period varies among species. In some species walking males are seen in late spring or early summer, while in other species males are only seen during fall or winter. Apart from the differences in lifestyles after maturation, tarantulas exhibit sexual dimorphisms in longevity and body mass, having smaller, shorter-lived males. Thus, to optimize energetic budgets, decreasing thermoregulation costs, we hypothesize and examine a putative correlation between an individual's preferred body temperature (T-pref) and the environmental temperature during the reproductive period. Hence, we characterize T(pref )in seven tarantula species and analyze which factors (i.e., time of day, body mass, and sex) correlated with it. Furthermore, we assess putative correlated evolution of T-pref with ambient temperature (minima, mean, and maxima) during the reproductive period by means of phylogenetic independent contrasts. We did not find differences in thermal preferences between sexes; and only one species, Acanthoscurria suina, exhibited diel differences in T-pref. We found evidence of correlated evolution between T-pref and minimum temperature during the reproductive period among all seven species studied herein.

By summing the absolute differences across an entire video, we are able to assign quantitative activity assessments to thermal imaging data for comparison with simultaneous recordings of metabolic rates. We tested the accuracy and limits of this approach by analyzing movement of a metronome and provide an example application of the approach to a study of Darwin's finches.

In order to study skin models and different boundary aspects, two problems: the three-layer skin tissue in contact with a hot water source and a single-layer skin tissue exposed suddenly to a heat source generated by a laser are investigated. In both cases, the super-diffusion fractional non-Fourier model is used to simulate the heat transfer diffused through the skin tissue. In the first case, the governing equation is solved using an implicit method, and in the second problem, its governing equation is solved using a finite volume method. In the fractional non-Fourier model, the effect of the model's essential parameters (alpha and tau) on the prediction of temperature distribution in skin tissue is studied as well as the effect of other parameters such as the blood rate is studied. In addition, grid study has been investigated and the most efficient and appropriate gird is obtained. The results are validated against the DPL (Dual-Phase Lag) model's results.

S. and Olson, Sarah H. and Plowright, Raina K. and McGuire, Liam P.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Many species use stored energy to hibernate through periods of resource limitation. Hibernation, a physiological state characterized by depressed metabolism and body temperature, is critical to winter survival and reproduction, and therefore has been extensively quantified and modeled. Hibernation consists of alternating phases of extended periods of torpor (low body temperature, low metabolic rate), and energetically costly periodic arousals to normal body temperature. Arousals consist of multiple phases: warming, euthermia, and cooling. Warming and euthermic costs are regularly included in energetic models, but although cooling to torpid body temperature is an important phase of the torpor-arousal cycle, it is often overlooked in energetic models. When included, cooling cost is assumed to be 67\% of warming cost, an assumption originally derived from a single study that measured cooling cost in ground squirrels. Since this study, the same proportional value has been assumed across a variety of hibernating species. However, no additional values have been derived. We derived a model of cooling cost from first principles and validated the model with empirical energetic measurements. We compared the assumed 67\% proportional cooling cost with our model-predicted cooling cost for 53 hibernating mammals. Our results indicate that using 67\% of warming cost only adequately represents cooling cost in ground squirrel-sized mammals. In smaller species, this value overestimates cooling cost and in larger species, the value underestimates cooling cost. Our model allows for the generalization of energetic costs for multiple species using species-specific physiological and morphometric parameters, and for predictions over variable environmental conditions.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.01.013,81,NA,185-193,NA,Bats; Cooling; Energetic model; Hibernation; Torpor; Winter survival

To maintain optimal body temperature and ensure physiological performance, these organisms can use behavioral adjustments to keep the body temperature in their specific temperature range, so-called preferred temperature (T-pref). It is therefore crucial to describe and understand how T-pref vary within and amongst populations to predict the effects of climate change of altitudinal range shifts in organisms. We aimed at determining the altitudinal variations in T-pref in three ectothermic species (the Pyrenean brook salamander - a semi-aquatic and thigmothermic amphibian - the European common lizard and the wall lizard - both heliothermic species). Using an experimental approach where T-pref were measured along a temperature gradient in laboratory conditions, we used a cross-sectional approach to compare the variation of T-pref measured in populations sampled along the altitudinal gradient in the Pyrenees. We hypothesized a complex and highly variable intra-specific response of T pref along geographical dines, with a positive relationship between T-pref and altitude (as predicted by the countergradient variation), the reverse pattern (referring to the adaptation of local optima hypothesis), or no relationship at all. Our results corroborated partially the countergradient hypothesis in the salamander (middle to high elevation part). At high altitude level, individuals may compensate for lower opportunities of favorable conditions by choosing a high temperature which maximizes their activities. However, populations from low elevation level hence better supported the adaptation of local optima hypothesis, such as both lizard species, for which T(pref )tended instead to decrease with altitude. Lizards from cold climates may be physiologically adapted to low temperature, with the ability to reach optimal functioning at lower temperature than individuals from low altitude. Our findings suggest that predicting future niche models should therefore take into account the variability of T-pref, where species might be differently affected by global warming.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.08.002,77,NA,38-44,NA,Body preferred temperatures; Lizards; Amphibians; Altitude; Countergradient hypothesis; Thermal strategies

Studies on metabolic fuel inhibition of glucose by using 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) or fatty acid by mercaptoacetate (MA) in heterothermic mammals produced mixed outcomes. To examine the roles of availability of glucose and fatty acid in the initiation of torpor in desert hamsters (Phodopus roborovskii), we intraperitoneally administrated 2DG and MA to summer-acclimated male hamsters while body temperature (T-b), metabolic rate (MR) and respiratory quotient (RQ) were simultaneously recorded to monitor their thermoregulatory response. 2DG induced a reversible reduction of T-b in desert hamsters both at ambient temperature (T-a) of 23 degrees C and 5 degrees C. At T-a of 23 degrees C, T-b, MR and RQ decreased in a dose-dependent manner with a large T-b-T-a differential ( > 6.5 degrees C) and a lowest Tb of 28.0 degrees C which were comparable to those in fasted hamsters. At T-a of 5 degrees C, 2DG-treated hamsters also decreased T-b to the same level as at Ta 23 degrees C, but MR was significantly higher than that at T-a of 23 degrees C at each dose, suggesting doses of 2DG directly affected the hypothalamic T-b set-point. Different from fasted hamsters which maintain normothermic at Ta of 5 degrees C, 2DG-treated hamsters showed a substantial reduction of T-b at T-a 5 degrees C, indicating an overwhelming effect on the thermoregulatory system regardless of T-a. Furthermore, the rapid decrease of T-b and outstretched body posture in 2DG-treated hamsters suggest that the effects of 2DG were not simply mimicking the torpor pathways but that other mechanisms are involved. Interestingly, MA failed to induce a torpor-like state in male desert hamsters. Our results suggest that availability of glucose rather than fatty acid plays an important role for initiation of torpor in desert hamsters.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.11.011,71,NA,189-194,NA,Desert hamsters; 2-deoxy-D-glucose; Mercaptoacetate; Metabolic fuel; Daily torpor
article,Differential expression of stress candidate genes for thermal tolerance in the sea urchin <i>Loxechinus albus</i>,"Vergara-Amado, Jonathan and Silva, Andrea X. and Manzi, Catalina and Nespolo, Roberto F. and Cardenas, Leyla",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Marine ectotherms inhabiting intertidal and shallow subtidal environments are continuously exposed to diurnal tidal cycles and seasonal variability in temperature. These organisms have adaptive mechanisms to maintain cellular homeostasis, irrespective of thermal environmental variation. In this study, we describe the molecular responses to thermal stress in the edible sea urchin Loxechinus albus. In particular, we determined the differential expression of a set of molecular markers that have been identified as targets of stress-related responses. These include the heat shock proteins (hsp70 and hsp90), cell detoxification proteins (cytochrome P450), and osmorregulatory proteins (a and beta-Na+/K+ ATPase). We exposed individuals to different temperatures; a warm treatment (18 +/- 1.0 degrees C), a cold treatment (10 1.0 degrees C), and a control treatment (average local temperature of 14 +/- 1.0 degrees C) and differential expression was quantified after 2, 6, 12 and 48 h of exposure. Levels of mRNA were quantified by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and the relative expression of each gene was calculated using the 18S rRNA gene as a reference, and the control treatment as a calibrator. We found that the expression levels of all studied genes increased during exposure to warmth. The largest increase in expression was observed in cytochrome p450 genes (ca. sixteen-fold); this was followed by increases in the expression of the Na+/K+ ATPase (ca. eight-fold) and by the lisp (ca. six fold) genes. These results indicate that sea urchin thermal stress responses depend on differential gene-regulation, involving heat-shock, membrane potential, and detoxification genes that generate an integrated adaptive response to acute environmental changes.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.03.009,68,A,104-109,NA,Thermal stress; Ectotherms; Marine invertebrates; Gene expression; hsp

T.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Southern ground-hornbills Bucorvus leadbeateri inhabit savanna and bushveld regions of South Africa. They nest in the austral summer which coincides with the wet season and hottest daytime temperatures in the region. They are secondary cavity nesters and typically nest in large cavities in trees, cliffs and earth banks, but readily use artificial nest boxes. Southern ground-hornbills are listed as Endangered in South Africa, with reintroductions into suitable areas highlighted as a viable conservation intervention for the species. Nest microclimate, and the possible implications this may have for the breeding biology of southern ground-hornbills, have never been investigated. We used temperature dataloggers to record nest cavity temperature and ambient temperature for one artificial and 11 natural southern ground-hornbill tree cavity nests combined, spanning two breeding seasons. Mean hourly nest temperature, as well as mean minimum and mean maximum nest temperature, differed significantly between southern ground-hornbill nests in both breeding seasons. Mean nest temperature also differed significantly from mean ambient temperature for both seasons. Natural nest cavities provided a buffer against the ambient temperature fluctuations. The artificial nest provided little insulation against temperature extremes, being warmer and cooler than the maximum and minimum local ambient temperatures, respectively. Nest cavity temperature was not found to have an influence on the breeding success of the southern ground-hornbill groups investigated in this study. These results have potentially important implications for southern ground-hornbill conservation and artificial nest design, as they suggest that the birds can tolerate greater nest cavity temperature extremes than previously thought.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.03.003,66,NA,21-26,NA,Cavity nester; Temperature fluctuation; Nest temperature; Hornbill; Conservation

We determined the preferred body temperature (T-pref), critical thermals (CTmin, CTmax), and hours of restriction and activity. T-pref was 32.14 +/- 1.83 degrees C; CTmin was 8.31 degrees C in adults and 9.14 degrees C in juveniles, whereas CTmax was 43.28 degrees C in adults and 41.68 degrees C in juveniles. To assess extinction risk, we used the model created by Sinervo et al. (2010) and predicted that 16.7\% of populations will have a high risk of extinction by 2020, with an increase to 26.7\% by 2050. These results suggest that this species, despite being able to maintain its T-pref through behavioral thermoregulation and habitat selection, could be physiologically sensitive to climate warming; thus, the potential for local adaptation may be limited under a warmer climate. Further studies focusing on the ability of S. guentheri to evolve higher T-pref and thermal tolerances are needed to understand the ability of this species to respond to climate change.",2016,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.09.012,62,A,30-36,NA,Andes; Critical thermal; Extinction; Global warming; Lizard; Restriction hours

Its effects as a dietary supplement on cold tolerance were studied in Drosophila melanogaster Canton S. Two-day-old adult flies fed at larval and adult stages with AKG at moderate concentrations (5-10 mM) recovered faster from chill coma (0 degrees C for 15 min or 3 h) than control ones. The beneficial effect of AKG on chill coma recovery was not found at its higher concentrations, which suggests hormetic like action of this keto acid. Time of 50\% observed mortality after 2 h recovery from continuous cold exposure (-1 degrees C for 3-31 h) (LTi50) was higher for flies reared on 10 mM AKG compared with control ones, showing that the diet with AKG enhanced insect cold tolerance. In parallel with enhancement of cold tolerance, dietary AKG improved fly locomotor activity. Metabolic effects of AKG differed partly in males and females. In males fed on AKG, there were no differences in total protein and free amino acid levels, but the total antioxidant capacity, catalase activity and low molecular mass thiol content were higher than in control animals. In females, dietary AKG promoted higher total antioxidant capacity and higher levels of proteins, total amino acids, proline and low molecular mass thiols. The levels of lipid peroxides were lower in both fly sexes reared on AKG as compared with control ones. We conclude that both enhancement of antioxidant system capacity and synthesis of amino acids can be important for AKG-promoted cold tolerance in D. melanogaster. The involvement of AKG in metabolic pathways of Drosophila males and females is discussed.

article,Thermal energetics of the New-Guinean moss-forest rat (<i>Rattus niobe</i>) in comparison with other tropical murid rodents,"Genoud, Michel",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The thermal energetics of rodents from cool, wet tropical highlands are poorly known. Metabolic rate, body temperature and thermal conductance were measured in the moss-forest rat, Rattus niobe (Rodentia), a small murid endemic to the highlands of New Guinea. These data were evaluated in the context of the variation observed in the genus Rattus and among tropical murids. In 7 adult R. niobe, basal metabolic rate (BMR) averaged 53.6 +/- 6.6 mL O-2 h(-1), or 103\% of the value predicted for a body mass of 42.3 +/- 5.8 g. Compared to other species of Rattus, R. niobe combines a low body temperature (35.5 +/- 0.6 degrees C) and a moderately low minimal wet thermal conductance c(min) (5.88 +/- 0.7 mL O-2 h(-1) degrees C-1, 95\% of predicted) with a small size, all of which lead to reduced energy expenditure in a constantly cool environment. The correlations of mean annual rainfall and temperature, altitude and body mass with BMR, body temperature and c(min) were analyzed comparatively among tropical Muridae. Neither BMR, nor c(min) or body temperature correlated with ambient temperature or altitude. Some of the factors which promote high BMR in higher latitude habitats, such as seasonal exposure to very low temperature and short reproductive season, are lacking in wet montane tropical forests. BMR increased with rainfall, confirming a pattern observed among other assemblages of mammals. This correlation was due to the low BMR of several desert adapted murids, while R. niobe and other species from wet habitats had a moderate BMR. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Machine learning thermal comfort prediction models based on occupant demographic characteristics,"Kocaman, Ezgi and Erdem, Merve Kuru and Calis, Gulben",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"This study aims to investigate the predictive occupant demographic characteristics of thermal sensation (TS) and thermal satisfaction (TSa) as well as to find the most effective machine learning (ML) algorithms for predicting TS and TSa. To achieve this, a survey campaign was carried out in three mixed-mode buildings to develop TS and TSa prediction models by using six ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Na \& iuml;ve Bayes, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighborhood (KNN) and Support Vector Machine). The prediction models were developed based on six demographic characteristics (gender, age, thermal history, education level, income, occupation). The results show that gender, age, and thermal history are significant predictors of both TS and TSa. Education level, income, and occupation were not significant predictors of TS, but were significant predictors of TSa. The study also found that RF and KNN are the most effective ML algorithms for predicting TS, while DT and RF are the most effective ML algorithms for predicting TSa. The study found that the accuracy of TS prediction models ranges from 83\% to 99\%, with neutral being the most correctly classified scale.

This study investigated the effectiveness of two external cooling strategies (i.e., spraying water onto the body surface or using a cooling vest) on physiological and perceptual variables in tetraplegic athletes during and after an aerobic exercise session in a hot environment. Nine male wheelchair rugby players performed an incremental test to determine their maximum aerobic power output. After that, they were subjected to three experimental trials in a counter-balanced order: control (CON, no body cooling), cooling vest (CV), and water spraying (WS). During these trials, they performed 30 min of a submaximal exercise (at 65\% of their maximum aerobic power) inside an environmental chamber set to maintain the dry-bulb temperature at 32 degrees C. The following variables were recorded at regular intervals during the exercise and for an additional 30 min following the exertion (i.e., post-exercise recovery) with the participants also exposed to 32 degrees C: body core temperature (TCORE), skin temperature (TSKIN), heart rate (HR), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), thermal comfort (TC), and thermal sensation (TS). While exercising in CON conditions, the tetraplegic athletes had the expected increases in TCORE, TSKIN, HR, RPE, and TC and TS scores. HR, TC, and TS decreased gradually toward pre-exercise values after the exercise, whereas TCORE and TSKIN remained stable at higher values. Using a cooling vest decreased the temperature measured only on the chest and reduced the scores of RPE, TC, and TS during and after exercise but did not influence the other physiological responses of the tetraplegic athletes. In contrast, spraying water onto the athletes' body surface attenuated the exercise-induced increase in TSKIN, led to lower HR values during recovery, and was also associated with better perception during and after exercise. We conclude that water spraying is more effective than the cooling vest in attenuating physiological strain induced by exercise-heat stress. However, although both external cooling strategies do not influence exercise hyperthermia, they improve the athletes' thermal perception and reduce perceived exertion.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103896,123,NA,NA,103896,Anhidrosis; Heart rate; Paralympic athletes; Physical exertion; Spinal cord injuries; Temperature; Thermoregulation; Thermosensing
article,Post-exercise management of exertional hyperthermia in dogs participating in dog sport (canicross) events in the UK,"Carter, Anne J. and Hall, Emily J. and Bradbury, Jude and Beard, Sian and Gilbert, Sophie and Barfield, Dominic and O'Neill, Dan G.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Exercise is a common trigger of heat-related illness (HRI) events in dogs, accounting for 74\% of canine HRI cases treated under primary veterinary care in the United Kingdom. However, few empirical studies have evaluated the effectiveness of differing cooling methods for dogs with exertional hyperthermia or HRI. This study aimed to prospectively evaluate effects of ambient conditions and post-exercise management practices (cooling methods and vehicular confinement) on the post-exercise temperature change of dogs participating in UK canicross events. Canine temperature was recorded at three intervals post-exercise: as close as possible to 0- (immediately post-exercise), 5-, and 15-min post-exercise. Ambient conditions and post-exercise management were recorded for 115 cooling profiles from 52 dogs. In 28/115 (24.4\%) profiles, the dog's temperature increased during the first 5-min post-exercise. Overall, 68/115 (59.1\%) profiles included passive cooling (stood or walked outside), 35 (30.4\%) active cooling (cold-water immersion or application of a cooling coat), and 12 (10.4\%) involved no cooling and were immediately housed in vehicles. No dogs developed hypothermia during the study and no adverse effects were observed from any cooling method. In hyperthermic dogs, overall post-exercise body temperature change was significantly negatively associated (i.e. the dogs cooled more) with 0-min post-exercise body temperature (beta = -0.93, p < 0.001), and not being housed in a vehicle (beta = -0.43, p = 0.013). This study provides evidence cold-water immersion (in water at 0.1-15.0 degrees C) can be used to effectively and safely cool dogs with exertional hyperthermia. Progressive temperature increases in many dogs - even after exercise has terminated - supports the message to ``cool first, transport second{''} when managing dogs with HRI. When transporting dogs post-exercise or with HRI even after active cooling, care should be taken to cool the vehicle before entry and promote air movement around the dog during transport to facilitate ongoing cooling and prevent worsening of hyperthermia during travel.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103827,121,NA,NA,103827,Canine hyperthermia; Canine heat-related illness; Active cooling; Cold-water immersion; Evaporative cooling; Cooling dogs; Hot dogs; VetCompass

Results revealed that the combined effect of heat stress and water deprivation had affected all tested variables including the T-S, and once these animals gained access to water in the RE stage variables returned to their EU levels. Moreover, there were positive correlations between T-S and all variables with the exception of BTG. From these six variables, only three variables (i.e. the T-R, T-SK, and BTG) during the DE stage and two variables (i.e. the T-SK and BTG) throughout the experimental stages showed higher constancy (R-2 >= 0 75, P < 0 001; agreement intervals +/- 1 96 95 \% CI) with T-S. However, BTG appeared more closely correlated with T-S, representing the body-thermal status more realistically than other variables. In effect, the mean and thresholds of the BTG were predicted using the recorded T-S and were within 0.02 degrees C of original estimates. Collectively, these findings show that infrared thermography is appropriate for assessing body-thermal status, and thus the welfare, of these animals under the three conditions studied, and conclude that full-body T-S can be a surrogate proxy for BTG in these animals.

In this study, we demonstrate that thermal ablation, but not cryo-ablation, induces irreversible collagen denaturation in a neuroblastoma sphere model. Prolonged collagen denaturation resulted in a significant reduction in sphere stiffness, migration, and proliferation, and an increase in apoptosis. Mechanistic analysis revealed that collagen denaturation inhibited collagen cross-linking, reduced extracellular LOX/LOXL2 expression, and resulted in decreased phosphorylation of FAK.

Experimental data that characterize the aerobic power budget via an aerobic scope, thermal metabolic scope, or thermal preferences have been proposed as tools that can describe species distribution since they characterize species fitness or performance under different temperatures. This study tested the potential relationship between observed occurrences and different physiological studies in the Americas for 11 commer-cially important species in Mexico. Projections were also developed for Mexico's exclusive economic zone under different climate warming scenarios. The physiological data were fitted from optimum up to pejus temperatures and projected to sea surface temperatures for present (2003-2014) and Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, and RCP 8.5) for the period 2040-2050 and 2090-2100. For species with wide distributions in the Americas, the number of occurrences reported decreases at higher latitudes related to the decrease in species performance calculated from laboratory experiments. In addition, higher species oc-currences are usually reported around optimum temperatures. Overall, the results suggest that pejus tempera-tures likely restrict latitudinal distribution, at least for widely distributed taxons. Regarding Mexican projections, the results varied widely by species. For example, in the Atlantic Ocean, Octopus maya and Panulirus argus are vulnerable to warming scenarios, while Centropomus undecimalis is not.

G.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Benthic invertebrate predators play a key role in top-down trophic regulation in intertidal ecosystems. While the physiological and ecological consequences of predator exposure to high temperatures during summer low tides are increasingly well-studied, the effects of cold exposure during winter low tides remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we measured the supercooling points, survival, and feeding rates of three intertidal predator species in British Columbia, Canada - the sea stars Pisaster ochraceus and Evasterias troschelii and the dogwhelk Nucella lamellosa - in response to exposure to sub-zero air temperatures. Overall, we found that all three predators exhibited evidence of internal freezing at relatively mild sub-zero temperatures, with sea stars exhibiting an average supercooling point of -2.50 degrees C, and the dogwhelk averaging approximately -3.99 degrees C. None of the tested species are strongly freeze tolerant, as evidenced by moderate-to-low survival rates after exposure to -8 degrees C air. All three predators exhibited significantly reduced feeding rates over a two-week period following a single 3-h sublethal (-0.5 degrees C) exposure event. We also quantified variation in predator body temperature among thermal microhabitats during winter low tides. Predators that were found at the base of large boulders, on the sediment, and within crevices had higher body temperatures during winter low tides, as compared to those situated in other microhabitats. However, we did not find evidence of behavioural thermoregulation via selective microhabitat use during cold weather. Since these intertidal predators are less freeze tolerant than their preferred prey, winter low temperature exposures can have important implications for organism survival and predator-prey dynamics across thermal gradients at both local (habitat-driven) and geographic (climate-driven) scales.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103549,114,NA,NA,103549,Cold; Feeding; Freezing; Intertidal zone; Microhabitat; Predation
article,Inversion of spatio-temporal distribution heat flux and reconstruction of transient temperature field of three-layered skin tissue during hyperthermia,"Liu, Li and Liu, Chuang and Zhu, Qiaomiao and Li, Yanhao",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Hyperthermia (for example, high-intensity focused ultrasound, laser, radio-frequency) of cancerous cells from in vitro to in vivo requires accurately obtaining the heat distribution induced by external heating into the threelayered skin tissue. Obtaining the boundary heat flux into the three-layered skin tissue is a necessary condition to realize the measurement of tissue heat distribution. Considering the complexity of multiple boundary heat fluxes in spatio-temporal distribution, this study proposes an inversion scheme to predict the spatio-temporal distribution of multiple boundary heat fluxes into the three-layered skin tissue. In the inversion scheme, a multivariable prediction model is established to solve the spatio-temporal coupling problem between the inversed boundary heat flux and measurement temperature information. Furthermore, based on the dependence between the predicted temperature and inversed boundary heat flux, the inversion system is constructed to realize the simultaneous optimization inversion of multiple boundary heat fluxes in spatio-temporal distribution. To examine the feasibility and effectiveness of inversion scheme, numerical experiments are carried out to discuss the influence of future time steps and measurement errors on the inversion results of boundary heat flux. In addition, the transient temperature field of three-layered skin tissue is reconstructed by inversed boundary heat flux, which could provide an economical, effective, and non-invasive solution for the measurement of thermal field of three-layered skin tissue during hyperthermia.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103515,114,NA,NA,103515,Hyperthermia; Multiple boundary heat fluxes; Multivariable prediction model; Simultaneous optimization inversion
article,House-warming: Wild king cobra nests have thermal regimes that positively affect hatching success and hatchling size,"Dolia, Jignasu and Das, Abhijit and Kelkar, Nachiket",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Incubation temperature in nests of oviparous reptiles affects reproductive success indicators, including hatching time and success, offspring size, fitness, and behaviour. The female king cobra builds an above ground nest to incubate and protect its eggs. However, it is not clear how thermal regimes inside king cobra nests respond to external environmental temperature regimes, especially in subtropical regions that witness high diel and seasonal temperature fluctuations. To better understand the relationship between inside nest temperatures and hatching outcomes for this snake, we monitored the thermal regimes of 25 natural king cobra nests in the subtropical forests of the Western Himalayas in Uttarakhand state, northern India. We hypothesized that inside nest temperatures would be higher than outside (ambient) temperatures and that thermal regimes inside nests would affect hatching success and hatchling size. Internal and external temperatures at nest sites were measured every hour until hatching, via automatic data loggers. We then calculated hatching success of eggs and measured hatchling length and weight. Mean inside nest temperatures were consistently higher by about 3.0 degrees C than outside environmental temperatures. External temperature reduced with increasing elevation of nest sites and was the best determinant of inside nest temperature, which had a smaller range of variability. Physical characteristics of nests (size and leaf materials used) did not influence nest temperature significantly, but nest size was positively related to clutch size. Mean inside nest temperature was the best predictor of hatching success. Average daily minimum nest temperature, which indicates a possible lower threshold for thermal tolerance by eggs, was also correlated positively with hatching success. Mean daily maximum temperature was a significant predictor of mean length of hatchlings, but not of mean hatchling weight. Our study provides unequivocal evidence for the critical thermal benefits of king cobra nests for increased reproductive success, in subtropical environments with lower and sharply fluctuating temperature regimes.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103468,112,NA,NA,103468,King cobra; Snake; Thermal regimes; Nesting ecology; Reproductive fitness; Himalayan foothills
article,A modelling framework for local thermal comfort assessment related to bicycle helmet use,"Broede, Peter and Aerts, Jean-Marie and De Bruyne, Guido and Mayor, Tiago Sotto and Annaheim, Simon and Fiala, Dusan and Kuklane, Kalev",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Thermal discomfort due to accumulated sweat increasing head skin wettedness may contribute to low wearing rates of bicycle helmets. Using curated data on human head sweating and helmet thermal properties, a modelling framework for the thermal comfort assessment of bicycle helmet use is proposed. Local sweat rates (LSR) at the head were predicted as the ratio to the gross sweat rate (GSR) of the whole body or by sudomotor sensitivity (SUD), the change in LSR per change in body core temperature (Delta tre). Combining those local models with Delta tre and GSR output from thermoregulation models, we simulated head sweating depending on the characteristics of the thermal environment, clothing, activity, and exposure duration. Local thermal comfort thresholds for head skin wettedness were derived in relation to thermal properties of bicycle helmets. The modelling framework was supplemented by regression equations predicting the wind-related reductions in thermal insulation and evapo-rative resistance of the headgear and boundary air layer, respectively. Comparing the predictions of local models coupled with different thermoregulation models to LSR measured at the frontal, lateral and medial head under bicycle helmet use revealed a large spread in LSR predictions predominantly determined by the local models and the considered head region. SUD tended to overestimate frontal LSR but performed better for lateral and medial head regions, whereas predictions by LSR/GSR ratios were lower and agreed better with measured frontal LSR. However, even for the best models root mean squared prediction errors exceeded experimental SD by 18-30\%. From the high correlation (R > 0.9) of skin wettedness comfort thresholds with local sweating sensitivity re-ported for different body regions, we derived a threshold value of 0.37 for head skin wettedness. We illustrate the application of the modelling framework using a commuter-cycling scenario, and discuss its potential as well as the needs for further research.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103457,112,NA,NA,103457,Thermal comfort; Thermoregulation; Headgear; Sweating; Model; Local effects
article,Analysis of human thermoregulatory mechanisms using 2-D computational model,"Ahmed, Shaik Gulzar and Shine, S. R.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"A numerical investigation is reported comparing various human thermoregulation mechanisms under hot and cold stress. The passive system of the developed model consists of 12 spherical/cylindrical segments and is modeled using the Pennes bioheat equation and finite difference method. The active system accounts for all regulatory responses, including the counter current heat exchange between veins and arteries; the respiratory heat loss; and threshold, gain, and maximum intensity of response mechanisms. The developed code analyzes various thermoregulatory defense mechanisms under hot and cold environments. Results indicate that shivering and sweating are more effective than other defense mechanisms under cold and hot conditions, respectively. Suppressing shivering will be more effective than the stoppage of vasoconstriction for inducing therapeutic hypothermia. The normal basal metabolic heat generation is essential to maintain a constant body temperature. It is seen that the changes in threshold temperatures of thermoregulatory mechanisms significantly affect the core more than the peripheral regions. The result may be helpful for better management of therapeutic hypothermia, hot/cold stress management, and design of drug protocols.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103388,110,NA,NA,103388,Bioheat models; Human thermoregulation; Physiological response; Thermoeffector thresholds
article,Together or alone? Huddling energetic savings in three social mole-rat species of genus<i> Fukomys.</i> A dispersal perspective,"Vavruskova, Zuzana and Okrouhlik, Jan and Sumbera, Radim",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"African mole-rats (Bathyergidae) are strictly subterranean rodents distributed in sub-Saharan Africa. Although the soil layer provides a temperature buffer, the temperature in their burrows is usually below their thermo-neutral zone and thermogenesis is necessary to maintain a stable body temperature. In social bathyergids, an important mechanism for decreasing the thermoregulatory cost is social thermoregulation in the form of hud-dling. The effect of huddling may be of special importance during forming of a new family as only two adults are present and social species are known for higher heat losses from their bodies compared to solitary mole-rats. In our study, we measured the resting metabolic rate and energetic saving in three social bathyergid species which differ in body size. We compared animals that were housed individually and in pairs at two different ambient temperatures (Ta). At a temperature within their TNZ (Ta = 30 degrees C), no energetic savings were expected, whereas in Ta = 20 degrees C we expected energetic savings due to huddling. We found no energetic savings at 30 degrees C in any of the species, but almost 20\% in the two small bodied Fukomys species F. micklemi and F. anselli at 20 degrees C. In the largest species, F. mechowii, no significant energetic savings were observed. Our results confirm the importance of huddling for the energetic balance of social mole-rats and show that huddling with one partner can bring substantial energetic savings, which can be allocated to other activities such as extension of established burrow systems or reproduction to increase the workforce and fulfill the purpose of dispersal.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103385,110,NA,NA,103385,African mole-rats; Fukomys; Energetics; Huddling; Thermoregulation

A. and Baloyi, J. J. and Onagbesan, O. M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"This review summarizes the available information on the adaptation and the performance of White Fulani cattle in tropical environments. White Fulani cattle is an indigenous breed of cattle widely distributed in the humid tropical regions of Africa and plays significant roles in meat and milk production, as well as draught purposes. Poor management and the harsh environmental conditions in the tropics encumber the optimal productive and reproductive performance of the breed, having about 4.75 years age at first calving, 57\% calving rate, 18 months calving interval and 3 to 4 calves are born in a reproductive lifetime. The cattle breed adapts to these climatic patterns via physiological, morphological, behavioral, genetic, and metabolic responses. Different physiological mechanisms and morphological features such as their white coat color, hair coat thickness, and lengthy rump appear to play an important adaptive role. The distinct genetic traits (including the possession of seven genetic variants of HSP 90 gene) of the breed afford them some levels of thermotolerance and high resistivity to some endemic diseases (such as trypanosomiasis, liver fluke, brucellosis and foot and mouth disease) in the tropics constitute inherent characteristics that should be explored in detail using molecular assisted approaches. The productive performance of the breed under different systems is discussed. A better understanding of the adaptive characteristics of White Fulani cattle could provide crucial information on the best management approach/ techniques that should be adopted to improve the performance, productivity, and sustainability of this cattle breed. Therefore, this review aims to compile the various production, reproduction and adaptation traits of the breed and presents vital information underlying their thriving and survivability in tropical environments.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103372,110,NA,NA,103372,White fulani; Tropics; Stress; Adaptation; Environment; Physiology
article,Is torpor a water conservation strategy? Heterothermic responses to acute water and food deprivation are repeatable among individuals of <i>Phodopus sungorus</i>,"Noakes, Matthew J. and Przybylska-Piech, Anna S. and Wojciechowski, Michal S. and Jefimow, Malgorzata",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Energy conservation is a clear function of torpor. Although many studies imply that torpor is also a water-saving strategy, the experimental evidence linking water availability with torpor is inconclusive. We tested the relative roles of water and energy shortages in driving torpor, using the Siberian hamster Phodopus sungorus as a model species. To account for the seasonal development of spontaneous heterothermy, we used male hamsters acclimated to short (8L:16D, SP; n = 40) and long (16L:8D, LP; n = 36) photoperiods. We continuously measured body temperature (T-b) during consecutive 32 h of complete removal of water, food, or both, separated by 7.5 d recovery periods. We predicted that all deprivation types would increase the frequency of spontaneous torpor in SP, and induce torpor in LP-acclimated hamsters. Individuals underwent each deprivation type twice in random orders. Food and water deprivation did not induce torpor in LP-acclimated P. sungorus. Patterns of torpor expression varied among deprivation types in SP individuals. Torpor frequency was significantly lower, but bouts were similar to 2 h longer and 2.5 degrees C deeper, during water deprivation compared to food and food-and-water deprivation. Heterothermic responses to all deprivation types were repeatable among individuals. Different torpor patterns during water and food deprivation suggest that water and energy shortages are distinct physiological challenges. Deeper and longer bouts during water deprivation likely led to higher energy and water savings, while shorter and shallower bouts during fasting may reflect a trade-off between energy conservation and food-seeking activity. The lack of a difference between food- and food-and-water-deprived hamsters suggests a higher sensitivity to food than water shortage. This supports the traditional view that energy conservation is the major function of torpor, but suggests that water shortages may also modulate torpor use. The high repeatability of thermoregulatory responses to resource deprivation suggests that these may be heritable traits subject to natural selection.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103321,109,NA,NA,103321,Torpor; Heterothermy; Thermoregulation; Water conservation; Energy conservation; Repeatability

Thus, it has been frequently studied by investigators. This study explored people's thermal responses to environments and the subjective factors that might affect thermal comforts with respect to two urban parks in Xindu, a satellite city in the Chengdu Plain (CDP). CDP is located at the southwest of China, which has a subtropical climate. The environment from each of the two parks was studied using current micrometeorology and hoped-for landscape changes (tree canopies, artificial canopies, non-canopying plants, and water surfaces); subjective factors included gender, age, body mass index, clothing isolation, and physical activities. It was found that canopies were the most preferred objective cooling elements, while individual thermal perceptions varied subjectively by age. The highest proportion of volunteers voted for tree canopies as their favourite thermal adjusting element. It was observed that those aged above 55 showed low thermal sensitivity.

Single (n = 10) or twin (n = 12) Morada Nova lambs were evaluated after birth, during the first successful suckling (M0 = Timepoint 0), and at regular intervals of 20 min (M20, M40, M60). Lambs from single births had higher birth weight (3.09 vs 2.58 kg; P <= 0.05) and higher serum triiodothyronine concentration (267 vs 209 ng/dL; P <= 0.05) compared to twin lambs. There was a positive correlation between weight and blood glucose (0.57; P <= 0.05) for both single and twin lambs. The type of birth did not affect vitality, which was negatively associated with cortisol concentration (-0.53; P <= 0.05). Twin lambs had higher internal and ocular temperatures (39.29 vs 38.67 degrees C and 38.84 vs 38.13 degrees C; P <= 0.05, respectively).

R. and Moraes, Michele M. and Teixeira-Coelho, Francisco and Albuquerque, Maicon R. and Wanner, Samuel P.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Thermoregulatory changes may influence the rats' prolonged physical performance and are commonly evaluated during treadmill running. Therefore, we determined the reliability of performance and thermoregulatory parameters in rats subjected to incremental-speed exercises (i.e., we assessed whether the testing protocol provides measurements that are consistent and free from error). Twenty rats were subjected to two sessions of incremental exercises at 24 ?, separated by 48 h, until they were fatigued. The rats' performance and thermoregulatory responses were determined, and values concerning the reliability of these parameters {[}e.g., intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and minimal detectable change (MDC)] were calculated. Our data revealed that the core temperature (TCORE) at fatigue and heat loss threshold were the most reproducible parameters, showing good reliability (ICC between 0.75 and 0.90). Moreover, all performance parameters assessed, the change in TCORE, the rate of TCORE increase, and the TCORE increase-to-distance traveled ratio presented moderate reliability. We then investigated whether changes in performance and thermoregulation induced by a warm environment were greater than the MDC95\% values determined in the first experiment. Eight rats were subjected to incremental exercises at two environmental conditions: 24 C and 31 ?. Individual analyses showed that most rats presented thermoregulatory differences between exercises at 31 ? and 24 ? greater than the calculated MDC95\% values; this was not the case for their performance. In conclusion, we provide data on the reliability of rats' performance and thermoregulatory parameters during incremental-speed running.

The air distributions might create either positive or negative VTDs. However, no research has clearly revealed the effect of different directions of VTDs on human comfort. To create environments with positive and negative VTDs in this study, the air temperature of half of the body was maintained at an air temperature of 25 degrees C, whereas the other half of the body (the upper or lower body part, respectively) was exposed to air temperatures of 22 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 28 degrees C, and 31 degrees C, respectively. That is two series of experiments with the same VTD value but different directions were compared, based on 16 subjects seated in a climatic box in a climate chamber. The thermal sensations, sick building syndrome (SBS) symptoms, and physiological responses of occupants were studied. The results showed that subjects were more sensitive to the VTD at the upper body part in warm environments with respect to thermal sensations, perceived air quality, and sweat intensity. The analysis indicated that there were more discomfort and heat stress for positive VTDs than negative VTDs. Thus, the criterion for acceptable negative VTDs should be different with the positive VTDs incorporated in current standards. Overall, the directions of the VTDs were suggested to be considered for evaluating the thermally stratified air distributions based on both of thermal comfort and energy efficiency in buildings.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103276,108,NA,NA,103276,Vertical air temperature difference; Thermal direction; Thermal sensation; Physiological response; Skin temperature

Brain transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channels modulate both thermoregulation and animal behavior; however, the role of peripheral TRPV1 channels in regulating these responses during exposure to an anxiogenic environment has not been determined. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the involvement of abdominal TRPV1 channels in stress-induced hyperthermia and behavior in rats subjected to an unconditioned anxiety test. Desensitized rats (peripheral desensitization of TRPV1 channels with resiniferatoxin; RTX) and their respective controls were subjected to a 15-min open field (OF) test. The core body temperature (T-core), tail skin temperature (T-skin), and rats' movements inside the arena were recorded. The OF test induced a similar increase in T-core in both groups throughout the exposure time; however, at the recovery period, the RTX-treated rats had a slower reduction in T-core due to lower tail skin heat loss. T-skin decreased significantly in both groups during exposure to OF but, during recovery, the RTX-treated rats showed impaired skin vasodilation. Also, RTX-treated rats entered fewer times and spent less time in the OF center square, suggesting an anxiety-related behavior. Our findings indicate that, under stressful conditions, peripheral TRPV1 channels modulate thermoregulatory and behavioral responses. The TRPV1 desensitization induces a more prolonged hyperthermic response due to lower cutaneous heat dissipation, alongside a more evident anxiety-like behavior in rats subjected to the OF apparatus.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103191,106,NA,NA,103191,Anxiety; Open field test; Psychogenic fever; RTX; Thermoregulation; TRPV1

During the summer months, we observed a significantly lower proportion of oocytes reaching the GV3 stage and higher levels of DNA fragmentation in cumulus cell. As a result, blastocyst yield and quality were reduced during the summer months. In conclusion, summer negatively affected oocyte GV stage progression, cumulus cell quality, and embryo development.

We examined the effect of fluctuating temperatures on reproduction and survival under starvation, two important components of fitness. We used the red flour beetle as a model organism, which is a significant pest in grain mills around the world. Fluctuations around the optimal temperature were always negative for the adult survival under starvation. The effect of thermal fluctuations on the number of offspring reaching adulthood was negative as well but increased with the extent of exposure. It was the strongest when the adult parents were kept and the offspring were raised under fluctuating temperatures. However, the later the offspring were exposed to fluctuations during their development, the weaker the effect of fluctuating temperatures was. Moreover, raising the parents under fluctuating temperatures but keeping them after pupation at constant temperatures fully alleviated the negative effects of fluctuations on the offspring. Finally, we demonstrate that keeping the parents a few days under fluctuating temperatures is required to induce negative effects on the number of offspring reaching adulthood.

article,Cold arousal - A mechanism used by hibernating bats to reduce the energetic costs of disturbance,"Bachorec, Erik and Bartonicka, Tomas and Heger, Tomas and Pikula, Jiri and Zukal, Jan",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"During the season of hibernation, temperate bats alternate between prolonged bouts of torpor with reduced body temperature and short arousals with a return to normothermy. Hibernating bats are sensitive to non-tactile stimuli and arouse following changes in microclimatic conditions or disturbance from other bats, potential predators, or humans. Here, we used temperature data loggers to register the skin temperature of 38 Myotis myotis bats over two winters (between January and March), during which regular visits were made to the hibernaculum. Two kinds of arousal were observed, normothermic (T-sk > 25 degrees C) and cold (T-sk < 15 degrees C). Although bats responded to the presence of a researcher by arousals of both kinds, cold arousals were more frequent (63.8\%). We found that mass loss was not affected by the number of disturbances, however it was in positive relationship with the mass at the beginning of the observation and differed between sex and age categories. Furthermore normothermic bats crawling among cluster-mates initiated arousal cascades, which mainly consisted of cold arousals. We failed to detect any effect of age or sex on the number of arousals initiated by normothermic individuals. Warming by only a few degrees requires less energy than a normothermic arousal and we propose it is sufficient to activate the sensory system in order to assess the relevance of external stimuli.

The relationship between temperature and insect development has long been recognized as an important environmental parameter in modeling insect population dynamics. Although few studies have investigated the existence of developmental rate polymorphism within a cohort, the role of abiotic and biotic factors on such developmental variation has so far been meagerly investigated. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of thermal extremes on the developmental rate polymorphism and its influence on reproductive potential of Parthenium beetle, Zygogramma bicolorata Pallister (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). The study will also be helpful in solving hitherto whether the existence of slow and fast developers within a cohort has a purely genetic basis or this developmental polymorphism is presided by environmental factors. Our result reveals a clear bimodal pattern of distribution with two peaks at each temperature (20, 25, 27, 30 and 35 degrees C) where the first peak represents the fast developers and second peak represents the slow developers. Both developmental variants took the longest duration for development at 20 degrees C followed by 25, 27, 30 degrees C and minimum at 35 degrees C. More fast developers were found at higher temperatures. Slow developing individuals were heavier than the fast developing individuals regardless of rearing temperature.

F. and Pimenta, Eduardo M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"This study aimed to investigate the correlation between strength and skin temperature (T-sk) asymmetries in the lower limbs of elite soccer players before and after a competitive season. The sample (n = 20) was composed of elite male soccer players. Strength asymmetry and T-sk asymmetry was measured through the countermovement jump (CMJ) test and infrared thermography, respectively. Asymmetries were quantified using the symmetry angle (SA) equation. A strong correlation was found between the SA of rate of force development (RFD) and the SA of T-sk before (baseline) (r = 0.7; r(2) = 0.43; p = 0.03) and after (r = 0.6; r(2) = 0.42; p = 0.04) the competitive season. Moreover, after the competitive season there were significant decreases in Peak force (p < 0.018), Impulse (p < 0.04), RFD (p = 0.0001) and CMJ height (p = 0.05), and significant increases in T-sk (p < 0.03), C-reactive protein (p = 0.03), Creatine kinase = 0.0001) and Cortisol (p = 0.04), even after a 3-day rest interval (no training). These results suggest that the CMJ test can be combined with infrared thermography for monitoring strength asymmetry and contribute to the prevention of muscle injuries.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102919,99,NA,NA,102919,Injuries in athletes; Vertical jump; Infrared thermography; Biomarkers; Asymmetry; Football

Critical thermal maximum (CTmax), critical thermal minimum (CTmin), lethal thermal maximum (LTmax), lethal thermal minimum (LTmin), feeding intake (FI), feeding efficiency (FE), and specific growth rate (SGR) were assessed at three stable temperatures (17, 22 and 27 degrees C) and one variable temperature (22 +/- 5 degrees C) for 28 d. Better growth performance was observed under variable treatment compared to stable treatments. However, fish under the 27 degrees C treatment exhibited much weaker growth performance than those in the 17 degrees C treatment. Fish under variation temperature treatment fed like those under 22 degrees C treatment; the fish exhibited similar SGR but a higher gh and hsp70 level under variation temperature treatment. This may be due in part to a trade-off energy expenditure to deal with the temperature fluctuation. Together, these findings suggest that juvenile Schizothorax prenanti are resilient to daily fluctuations within the temperature tested here.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102918,98,NA,NA,102918,Schizothorax prenanti; Temperature; Thermal tolerance; Growth

For this purpose, we investigated the linkage between the daily rhythm of Per2 and UCP1 in ruminant and non-ruminant mammalian species. Five clinically healthy, not pregnant, and not lactating Maltese female goats and five clinically healthy, not pregnant, and not lactating Italian Saddle horses were enrolled in the study. All animals were housed under natural photoperiod (sunrise 05:05, sunset 20:55) and environmental temperature and humidity. Goats were kept individually in 3.0 x 2.0 m box, horses were housed individually in 3.5 x 3.5 m box; all boxes were equipped with an opening window. On each subject, blood samples were collected every 4 h for a 48-h period. The Per2 gene expression was determined on blood samples collected in PAX gene Blood RNA Tube, whereas UCP1 concentration was assessed on serum. Per2 and UCP1 levels were statistically influenced by the species (p < 0.0001) and the time of data collection (p < 0.0001), but not by the day of monitoring. Per2 showed daily rhythmicity, statistically different in mesor and amplitude between the two species, diurnal in goats, nocturnal in horses; with the same robustness. UCP1 did not show daily rhythmicity. During the experimental period the two parameters showed a negative correlation in horses. According to the findings herein obtained, we can claim that the role of Per2 in the thermogenesis induced by the beige adipocytes throughout UCP1 activation did not reflect what found in other mammal species, but further studies are required to establish their correlation in equids.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102891,97,NA,NA,102891,Daily rhythm; Equus caballus; Capra hyrcus; Per2; UCP1

Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element for animals and exerts most of its biological functions through selenoproteins. We previously demonstrated that the damage to C2C12 cells by HS accompanied with the response of selenoprotein encoding genes and proteins. The objective of this study was to investigate whether selenium supplementation (sodium selenite, SS and selenomethionine, SeMet) could alleviate the negative effect of heat stress on the differentiation of C2C12 cells, and interpret the potential corresponding selenoproteins response. The differentiated cells were cultured for 4 and 8 days under different condition: at 37 inverted perpendicular C, 41.5 degrees C and 41.5 degrees C with 0.5 ?mol Se/L SS or SeMet, and the HSP70, cell apoptosis, selenoproteins and cell differentiation-related gene or protein were detected. The result showed that HS up-regulated (P < 0.05) mRNA and protein levels of HSP70 and gene expression of AMPK alpha 1 and AMPK alpha 2, and down-regulated (P < 0.05) mRNA or protein levels of MYOGENIN and MYOD. Meanwhile, up to 15 and 17 selenoprotein genes expression were significantly changed response to 4-and 8-days HS challenge, respectively. Relative to the HS group, SS and SeMet supplementation down-regulated the mRNA and protein abundance of HSP70 to different degrees, and partly recovered (P < 0.05) the mRNA or protein abundance of MYOGENIN and MYOD at 4th and 8th day. Especially, 16 and 10 selenoprotein genes expression in cells affected by HS were altered by SS and SeMet supplementation, respectively. Both SS and SeMet supplementation modestly increased (P < 0.05) protein levels of GPX1 and SELENON in cells under HS. In summary, Se supplementation partly alleviated the negative impact of HS on myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells and the process may associate with the alternation of selenoprotein expression pattern, and SeMet exhibits better effect than SS.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102874,97,NA,NA,102874,C2C12 cells; Heat stress; Selenoprotein; Sodium selenite; Selenomethionine
article,Effects of heat stress on posture transitions and reproductive performance of primiparous sows during late gestation,"Liu, Longshen and Tai, Meng and Yao, Wen and Zhao, Ruqian and Shen, Mingxia",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"This study aimed to investigate the effects of heat stress on posture transitions of perinatal primiparous sows around the parturition period from 72 h prepartum to 24 h postpartum. The reproductive performance of sows was measured, and the relationship between posture transitions and reproductive performance was also analyzed. Ten primiparous sows were randomly assigned to thermoneutral (TN) (18?22 ?C; n = 5) or heat stress (HS) (28?32 ?C; n = 5) treatments. Posture transitioning, including the frequency of posture change, duration of dynamic posture (DP), and lateral lying with udder to the piglet creep box (PCB) during three periods (72 h prepartum, sub-partum, and 24 h postpartum, respectively), were recorded. Posture change frequency was significantly increased, starting from 24 h prepartum to the onset of farrowing in both the TN (P < 0.05) and HS (P < 0.01) groups. Moreover, the peak value of posture change frequency in the TN group was concentrated during the 12 h prepartum period, positively correlated with the quantities of head-first birth piglets and subpartum duration, respectively. DP duration increased during the period of 24 h prepartum and then decreased sharply (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05 for TN and HS groups, respectively). The duration of facing the udder to the PCB increased during sub-partum and postpartum TN (P < 0.001). The duration of sub-partum (P < 0.05) and delivery time of single piglets (P < 0.01) in the HS group was prolonged, and piglets from the HS group had a lower weight gain than the TN group both at d10 (P < 0.001) and weaning time (P < 0.001). In conclusion, HS had obvious adverse effects on nursery behavior and reproductive abilities in perinatal primiparous sows, which resulted in poor growth performance of lactating piglets.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102828,96,NA,NA,102828,Heat stress; Posture transitions; Reproductive performance; Perinatal primiparous sows
article,Beat the heat: Culex quinquefasciatus regulates its body temperature during blood feeding,"Reinhold, Joanna M. and Shaw, Ryan and Lahondere, Chloe",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Mosquitoes are regarded as one of the most dangerous animals on earth. Because they are responsible for the spread of a wide range of both human and animal pathogens, research of the underlying mechanisms of their feeding behavior and physiology is critical. Among disease vector mosquitoes, Culex quinquefasciatus, a known carrier of West Nile virus and Western Equine Encephalitis, remains relatively understudied. As blood-sucking insects, adaptations (either at the molecular or physiological level) while feeding on warm blood are crucial to their survival, as overheating can result in death due to heat stress. Our research aims to determine how Cx. quinquefasciatus copes with the heat associated with warm blood meal ingestion and possibly uncover the adaptations this species uses to avoid thermal stress. Through the use of thermographic imaging, we analyzed the body temperature of Cx. quinquefasciatus while blood feeding. Infrared thermography has allowed us to identify a cooling strategy, evaporative cooling via the production of fluid droplets, and an overall low body temperature in comparison to the blood temperature during feeding. Understanding Cx. quinquefasciatus? adaptations and the strategies they employ to reduce their body temperature while blood feeding constitutes the first step towards discovering potential targets that could be used for their control.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102826,96,NA,NA,102826,Thermography; Thermal stress; Disease vector mosquito; Hematophagy; Evaporative cooling; Heterothermy
article,Seasonal metabolic adjustments in an avian evolutionary relict restricted to mountain habitat,"Oswald, Krista N. and Lee, Alan T. K. and Smit, Ben",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"For endotherms, maintaining body temperature during cold winters is energetically costly.Greater increase in winter maximum thermogenic capacity (M sum ) has typically been correlated with improved cold tolerance. However, seasonal studies have shown equivocal direction change in basal metabolic rate (BMR) in winter, perhaps explained by latitude or phylogeny. We examined seasonal metabolic responses in the Cape rockjumper (Chaetops frenatus; ``rockjumper{''}), a range-restricted mountain bird. We hypothesized that, given their mountain habitat preference, rockjumpers would be physiologically specialized for cooler air temperatures compared to other subtropical passerines. We measured body condition (using the ratio of M-b/tarsus), BMR, and M-sum, in wild-living rockjumpers during winter and summer (n = 12 adults in winter - 4 females, 8 males; n = 12 adults in summer - 6 females, 6 males). We found birds had lesser BMR and thermal conductance, and greater M-sum and body condition, in winter compared to summer. These changes may help rockjumpers conserve energy in winter while still allowing birds to produce more metabolic heat during the coldest air temperatures. When compared with existing data on avian seasonal metabolic adjustments, mckjumper BMR fit general patterns observed in passerines, but their M sum was low compared with other members of the oscine Passeriformes. These patterns may be explained by the narrow temperature range of their habitat not requiring cold-adjustment, or perhaps by their basal placement within passerine phylogeny. Further work on the physiological phenotypic plasticity in habitat specialists across different latitudinal zones and taxa is needed to better understand the relationship between metabolism, habitat, and phylogeny.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102815,95,NA,NA,102815,Avian phylogeny; Avian metabolism; Basal metabolic rate; Seasonal physiological responses; Summit metabolism
article,ET<sub>A</sub> receptors are involved in the febrile response induced by high dose of bacterial endotoxin,"Lomba, L. A. and Leite-Avalca, M. C. G. and Zampronio, A. R.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Previous studies have demonstrated that endothelin-1 (ET-1) is involved in the febrile response induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in male and female rats. This peptide induces fever acting on ETB receptors in the central nervous system. However, during sepsis, endothelinergic ETA receptors in the brain also exert an important role reducing the mortality of the animals. The present study evaluated the participation of ETA receptors in the febrile response induced by different doses LPS in rats. Male Wistar rats were treated with the ETA receptor antagonist BQ123 before or after the injection of a low dose (10 mu g/kg) or a high dose (200 mu g/kg) of LPS intraperitoneally. The febrile response was evaluated. The treatment with BQ123, in both protocols did not change the febrile response induced by the lower dose of LPS. The pre-treatment with BQ123 also did not significantly change the febrile response induced by a higher dose of LPS but the post-treatment with the antagonist abolished the febrile response induced by this dose of LPS. These results suggest that even though ETA receptors are not recruited in the febrile response induced by lower doses of LPS, they are involved in the febrile response induced by high doses of this stimulus.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102804,95,NA,NA,102804,Endothelin-1; Fever; ETA receptor; Lipopolysaccharide

We monitored the rectal temperature, as well as the non-evaporative (radiative and convective pathways) and evaporative heat exchanges of males and females. The mean rectal temperature of females and males was 37.58 +/- 0.02 and 37.47 +/- 0.02 degrees C, respectively. We identified thermal windows by infrared thermography. The surface temperatures and the long-wave radiation heat exchanges were higher in the periocular, preocular, pinnae and vibrissae regions, in that order. The surface temperature of the periocular and preocular regions correlated positively with rectal temperature. Convective heat exchange was insignificant for thermoregulation by G. spixii. Evaporative heat loss increased when the thermal environment inhibited the radiative pathway. Females showed higher evaporative thermolysis than males at times of greater thermal challenge, suggesting a lower tolerance to heat stress. Therefore, infrared thermography identified the thermal windows, which represented the first line of defense against overheating in G. spixii.

The aim of this study was to propose equations for estimating the BGT, using meteorological data for different time scales and a bioclimatic evaluation of the Brazilian Northeast for breeding Saanen dairy goats. The data used in elaborating the equations were collected between 1 November 2014 and 31 October 2017. Data for BGT, incident global solar radiation (SR), air temperature (AT), relative humidity (RH) and wind speed were handled on a daytime, night-time, daily and monthly scale. One half of the database was used to adjust the equations and the other half in the evaluation. The bioclimatic diagnosis of the Brazilian Northeast was carried out based on mean monthly values of the black globe temperature and humidity index (BGHI) estimated for the four seasons of the year. For the daytime scale, an equation based on AT (BGT = 1.3897.AT-5.4421, r(2) = 0.80) and a multiplicative model combining the effects of AT and SR (BGT = {[}1.3897.AT-5.4421] (0.0384.In(SR) + 0.7935J, r(2) = 0.91) were obtained. AT adjusted well for BGT on the night-time scale (BGT = 0.995.AT-0.6964, r(2) = 0.99), daily scale (BGT = 1.1641.AT-1.5941, r(2) = 0.97) and monthly scale (BGT = 1.1550.AT-1.3498, r(2) = 0.98). The BGT can therefore be calculated from AT and/or SR for the daytime scale, and from AT only for the night-time, daily and monthly scales. In general, the west and centre-south of the state of Bahia offer the animals the most thermal comfort during each season of the year. In the state of Maranhao, heat stress occurs throughout the year, with the BGTI predominately in the range of 85-95. As such, strategies to combat heat stress should be encouraged to minimise the negative effects of climate on milk production in Saanen goats, and favour the milk-production chain in the northeast of Brazil.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102408,85,NA,NA,102408,Time scales; Indices and statistical errors; Regression; BGHI
article,Heat seekers: A tropical nocturnal lizard uses behavioral thermoregulation to exploit rare microclimates at night,"Nordberg, Eric J. and Schwarzkopf, Lin",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Environmental temperatures play a vital role in the physiological and behavioral activity of ectotherms. Behavioral thermoregulation allows animals to modify their body temperature to optimize functions critical to fitness, including digestion, growth, reproduction, and locomotor performance. Diurnal reptiles are a classic model system to answer questions related to thermal ecology, whereas behavioral thermoregulation in nocturnal species is thought to be strongly constrained by low environmental thermal heterogeneity at night. The few studies describing the thermal ecology of nocturnal reptiles indicate a majority of thermoregulatory behavior (if any) occurs during the day within diurnal retreats, but few examined this behavior throughout the night. In tropical systems, thermal heterogeneity may remain high, even at night, allowing nocturnal ectotherms to thermoregulate through conduction on surfaces that retain heat after sunset. We investigated the thermoregulatory behavior of a tropical nocturnal gecko (Australian house gecko, Gehyra dubia) by measuring its preferred temperature in a thermal gradient, and selected body temperatures using radio telemetry, in relation to available operative environmental temperatures obtained using thermal models. Preferred body temperatures of geckos ranged from 31.4 +/- 0.59-34.5 +/- 0.55 degrees C in a laboratory thermal gradient. In the field, during winter, geckos were more effective thermoregulators than in the summer. In low thermal quality habitats, geckos sought rare, warm microclimates at night to maintain body temperatures warmer than most available environmental temperatures, and were highly effective thermoregulators. For ectotherms, appropriate environmental temperatures are a vital resource for survival, similar to food or shelter. The ability to exploit rare microclimates is especially important for nocturnal species, as heterogeneity of environmental temperatures is reduced at night compared to the day. In a warming world, it is vital to understand the thermal ecology of nocturnal ectotherms, as other species may shift to become more nocturnal to avoid lethal diurnal temperatures.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.03.018,82,NA,107-114,NA,Australia; Ectotherm; Gecko; Preferred body temperature; Thermal ecology; Thigmotherm

Neither haematological parameters nor gill morphology showed the same improvement in performance at + 1.5 degrees C.

Sequence analyses indicated that HvCAT encodes a protein containing 507 amino acids, including a proximal active site sequence (FXRERIPERVVHAKGXGA), heme-ligand sequence (RLFSYNDTX), heme-binding residues (H73, S112, N146, F151, F159, R352, and Y356), and NADPH-binding residues (P149, H192, Y196, G199, R201, N211, H233, K235, I300, W301, P302, H303, Q442, and L445). A phylogenetic analysis indicated that CAT from lepidopteran species could be assigned to one well-supported cluster. Regarding its stage- and tissue-specific expression profiles, HvCAT was expressed at high levels in fifth-instar larvae, fat body of larvae, and abdomen of adults. Furthermore, when fifth-instar larvae were exposed to thermal stress at 35, 37, and 39 degrees C, hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde content significantly increased. HvCAT mRNA was upregulated when the larvae were exposed to temperatures of 31, 33, 35, 37, and 39 degrees C. The enzymatic activity of HvCAT was significantly elevated following thermal stress (35 and 37 degrees C). After the knockdown of HvCAT by double-stranded RNA interference, the expression of thioredoxin peroxidase (Tpx) increased, whereas that of copper zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/ZnSOD) decreased. Additionally, knocking down HvCAT transcripts in fifth-instar larvae resulted in accelerated death following thermal stress at 35 degrees C. In summary, the results suggest that HvCAT plays a major role in the thermotolerance of H. vitessoides.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.09.008,78,NA,114-121,NA,Heortia vitessoides; Catalase; Thermal stress; RNA interference

article,Thermoregulatory behavior and orientation preference in bearded dragons,"Black, Ian R. G. and Tattersall, Glenn J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The regulation of body temperature is a critical function for animals. Although reliant on ambient temperature as a heat source, reptiles, and especially lizards, make use of multiple voluntary and involuntary behaviors to thermoregulate, including postural changes in body orientation, either toward or away from solar sources of heat. This thermal orientation may also result from a thermoregulatory drive to maintain precise control over cranial temperatures or a rostrally-driven sensory bias. The purpose of this work was to examine thermal orientation behavior in adult and neonatal bearded dragons (Pogona vitticeps), to ascertain its prevalence across different life stages within a laboratory situation and its interaction with behavioral thermoregulation. Both adult and neonatal bearded dragons were placed in a thermal gradient and allowed to voluntarily select temperatures for up to 8 h to observe the presence and development of a thermoregulatory orientation preference. Both adult and neonatal dragons displayed a non-random orientation, preferring to face toward a heat source while achieving mean thermal preferences of similar to 33-34 degrees C. Specifically, adult dragons were more likely to face a heat source when at cooler ambient temperatures and less likely at warmer temperatures, suggesting that orientation behavior counter-balances local selected temperatures but contributes to their thermoregulatory response. Neonates were also more likely to select cooler temperatures when facing a heat source, but required more experience before this orientation behavior emerged. Combined, these results demonstrate the importance of orientation to behavioral thermoregulation in multiple life stages of bearded dragons.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.07.009,69,NA,171-177,NA,Behavioral thermoregulation; Ectotherm; Innate behavior; Sensory preference; Reptile; Lizardd

The mechanisms underlying these immune disturbances in obesity are not yet clarified. This study investigated the effects of in vitro heat shock (HS) on immune cells from the point of view of thymocyte apoptosis and T-cell mitogen-stimulated splenocyte cytokine production as well as the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) protein levels in diet-induced obese mice to explore a possible association between the disturbance of T cell immunity and HS response in obesity. Obese mice had increased apoptotic and necrotic thymocytes populations and increased splenocyte cytokine production of both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines compared with lean mice. The in vitro HS at 42 C decreased the rate of live cells in thymocytes, and the degree of the decrease was larger in obese mice compared with lean mice. The in vitro HS increased the intracellular and extracellular HSP70 protein levels in thymocytes and splenocytes, while the effects of obesity on the HSP70 protein levels were not obvious. The in vitro HS prior to T cell mitogen stimulation decreased IFN-y and IL-10 production by mitogen-stimulated splenocytes. This change in cytokine production due to HS was not affected by obesity. The obvious alteration of the HSP70 protein levels and association between cytokine production and the HS response in obesity were not found in this obesity model; however, our results indicate an association between the viability of thymocytes and an altered HS response in obesity and provide evidence that the increase in thymocyte apoptosis and acceleration of thymus involution in obesity could be, in part, due to the alteration of the HS response.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.07.004,69,NA,124-131,NA,Heat shock; HSP; Obesity; Immunity; Apoptosis; Cytokine

Here, we present a novel combination of field, laboratory, and modeling approaches to examine body temperature regulation, habitat thermal quality, and hours of thermal restriction on the activity of two sympatric, aridlands horned lizards (Phrynosoma cornutum and Phrynosoma modestum) at three contrasting Chihuahuan Desert sites in Mexico. Using these physiological data, we estimate local extinction risk under predicted climate change within their current geographical distribution. We followed the Hertz et al. (1993, Am. Nat., 142, 796-818) protocol for evaluating thermoregulation and the Sinervo et al. (2010, Science, 328, 894-899) eco-physiological model of extinction under climatic warming. Thermoregulatory indices suggest that both species thermoregulate effectively despite living in habitats of low thermal quality, although high environmental temperatures restrict the activity period of both species. Based on our measurements, if air temperature rises as predicted by climate models, the extinction model projects that P. cornutum will become locally extinct at 6\% of sites by 2050 and 18\% by 2080 and P. modestum will become extinct at 32\% of sites by 2050 and 60\% by 2080.

article,"How do outside-hosts-overwintering parasitoids, at the adult stage, cope with cold?","D'Ottavio, Marie and Labrie, Genevieve and Lucas, Eric",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Introduction: When overwintering, most endoparasitoids are protected from the cold inside their hosts. However, some endoparasitoids, along with ectoparasitoids, fall into the category called outside-hosts-overwintering parasitoids (OHOP) at immature or adult stages. We compared the cold-hardiness capacity and strategy between adult OHOP and their hosts (HOST) by examining their supercooling points (SCP), with acclimation periods and acclimation temperatures, and their lower lethal temperatures at 50\% mortality (LLT50). We hypothesized that OHOP are more cold-hardy than their HOST, with lower SCP and LLT50. Materials and methods: Throughout the summers of 2020, 2021, and 2022, adult cabbage seedpod weevils (HOST) were sampled with a sweep net at the canola pod stage, and thousands of pods were collected and placed in emergence boxes to retrieve the adult OHOP Trichomalus perfectus. Regarding SCP measures, OHOP and HOST were separated according to various treatments. Each treatment considered a target exposure temperature (5, 10, or 20 degrees C) or a target exposure period (5, 15 or 25 days) at 5 degrees C. Regarding LLT measures, OHOP and HOST were categorized into five treatments, each corresponding to a specific exposure temperature (-5, -10, -15, -20 or -25 degrees C). Results and conclusion: Acclimations to a lower temperature (5 degrees C) and a longer period (25 days) led to a significantly lower SCP of OHOP than HOST. Regarding OHOP, the average SCP was -19.71 degrees C when the acclimation temperature was 20 degrees C and significantly decreased to -23.20 degrees C when it was 5 degrees C. The average SCP was -18.82 degrees C when the acclimation period was five days and significantly decreased to -23.20 degrees C when it was 25 days. Conversely, the average SCP for HOST was never below -20 degrees C. At 20 degrees C acclimation temperature, HOST exhibited a significantly higher SCP of -14.64 degrees C compared to acclimations at 5 degrees C (-19.19 degrees C) and 10 degrees C (-20.00 degrees C), but there were no significant differences between 5 and 10 degrees C nor between acclimation periods. Therefore, the adult OHOP is more cold-hardy than its HOST. OHOP also exhibited a lower LLT50 than HOST, with -19.20 degrees C versus -17.59 degrees C. Finally, OHOP and HOST employ the same freeze-avoidance strategy, as evidenced by their SCP values (-19.57 degrees C versus -16.80 degrees C) which closely align with their respective LLT50. Adult OHOP better survive winter than their HOST in cold environments.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103940,124,NA,NA,103940,Insect physiology; Supercooling point; Acclimation; Lower lethal temperature; Pteromalidae; Curculionidae

Our study had revealed that stings frequency was significantly lower in cooler temperature compared to the medium and warm temperature. Threatening condition had no significant effect in medium and warmer temperature, the difference between the two conditions was only significant in the cooler temperature. Conversely, we had shown that venom expenditure in B. atlantis is regulated by both temperature and threatening conditions. Our results show that scorpions maintained in higher temperatures yielded the greatest amount of venom compared to those in lower temperatures. Analyses of proteins concentration according to temperature and diet variation had revealed that scorpions placed in intermediate (25 degrees C) and warmer temperature (40 degrees C) had a significantly higher venom proteins concentration when compared to the cooler temperature (10 degrees C).

article,Phenotypic plasticity and thermal efficiency of temperature responses in two conspecific springtail populations from contrasting climates,"Sengupta, Sagnik and Leinaas, Hans Petter",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature drives adaptation in life-history traits through direct effects on physiological processes. However, multiple life-history traits co-evolve as a life-history strategy. Therefore, physiological limitations constraining the evolution of trait means and phenotypic plasticity can be larger for some traits than the others. Comparisons of thermal responses across life-history traits can improve our understanding of the mechanisms determining the life-history strategies. In the present study, we focused on a soil microarthropod species abundant across the Northern Hemisphere, Folsomia quadrioculata (Collembola), with previously known effects of macroclimate. We selected an arctic and a temperate population from areas with highly contrasting climates - the arctic tundra and a coniferous forest floor, respectively - and compared them for thermal plasticity and thermal efficiency in growth, development, fecundity, and survival across four temperatures for a major part of their life cycle. We intended to understand the mechanisms by which temperature drives the evolution of life-history strategies. We found that the temperate population maximized performance at 10-15 degrees C, whereas the arctic population maintained its thermal efficiency across a wider temperature range (10-20 degrees C). Thermal plasticity varied in a trait-specific manner, and when considered together with differences in thermal efficiency, indicated that stochasticity in temperature conditions may be important in shaping the life-history strategies. Our study suggests that adopting a whole-organism approach and including physiological time considerations while analysing thermal adaptation will markedly improve our understanding of plausible links between thermal adaptation and responses to global climate change.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103914,123,NA,NA,103914,Adaptive and non -adaptive thermal plasticity; Soil mesofauna; Thermal reaction norms; Trait means; Day-degrees
article,The potential of therapeutic hyperthermia to eradicate<i> Staphylococcus</i><i> aureus</i> bacteria; an in vitro study,"Gazel, Deniz and Akdogan, Hueseyin and Manay, Ayse Bueyuektas and Erinmez, Mehmet and Zer, Yasemin",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most common infectious agents, causing morbidity and mortality worldwide. Most pathogenic bacteria are classified in the group of mesophilic bacteria and the optimal growth temperature of these bacteria changes between 33 and 41 degrees C. Increased temperature can inhibit bacterial growth and mobility, which in turn, can trigger autolysis and cause cell wall damage. Hyperthermia treatment is defined as a heat -mediated treatment method applied using temperatures higher than body temperature. Nowadays, this treatment method is used especially in the treatment of tumours. Hyperthermia treatment is divided into two groups: mild hyperthermia and ablative or high -temperature hyperthermia. Mild hyperthermia is a therapeutic technique in which tumour tissue is heated above body temperature to produce a physiological or biological effect but is often not aimed at directly causing significant cell death. The goal of this method is to achieve temperatures of 40-45 degrees C in human tissues for up to 2 h. Hyperthermia can be used in the treatment of infections caused by such bacterial pathogens. In addition, using hyperthermia in combination with antimicrobial drugs may result in synergistic effects and reduce resistance issues. In our study, we used two different temperature levels (37 degrees C and 45 degrees C). We assessed growth inhibition, some virulence factors, alteration colony morphologies, and antimicrobial susceptibility for several antibiotics with three methods (Kirby -Bauer, E -test and broth microdilution) under hyperthermia. In the study, we observed that hyperthermia affected the urease enzyme, antibiotic sensitivity levels showed synergy with hyperthermia, and changes occurred in colony diameters and affected bacterial growth. We hypothesise that hyperthermia might be a new therapeutic option for infectious diseases as a sole agent or in combination with different antimicrobials.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103812,120,NA,NA,103812,Hyperthermia; Antimicrobial; Staphylococcus aureus; Synergistic

However, this invasive test requires euthanasia, thereby precluding further investigations on the same animal. Due to these limitations, the integration of non-invasive tools such as IRT has been sought. Here, we aimed to evaluate the use of thermography in a common orofacial pain model that employs formalin as a chemical irritant to induce local orofacial inflammation. Male Hannover rats (290-300 g, N = 43) were used. In the first approach, radiometric images were taken before and after formalin administration, assessing temperature changes and extravasated Evans Blue. The second approach included capturing pre- and post-formalin test radiometric images, followed by cytokine measurements in excised vibrissae tissue. Rats were anesthetized for vibrissae tissue collection, allowing correlations between thermographic patterns, nocifensive behavior duration, and cytokine levels in this area. Our findings revealed a positive correlation between local temperature, measured via thermography, and vascular permeability in the contralateral (r2 = 0.3483) and ipsilateral (r2 = 0.4502) side, measured using spectrophotometry.

Methods: The plantar skin temperature of all participants was measured using a thermal camera following a 6min walking exercise. The data were subjected to frequency decomposition, resulting in two frequency ranges corresponding to endothelial and neurogenic mechanisms. Then, 40 thermal indicators were evaluated for each participant. ROC curve and statistical tests allowed to identify indicators able to detect the presence or absence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Results: The study included 33 participants living with diabetes. The results revealed that a 6-min walk exercise increased plantar foot temperature and highlighted a significant difference between people living with diabetes with and without peripheral neuropathy (p < 0.01). The results also revealed the advantages of using thermal images rather than single point measurements. Conclusions: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is linked to impairment of thermoregulatory mechanisms. This link can be highlighted after a dedicated 6-min walk exercise, enabling to activate these mechanisms, and measuring with a thermal camera the temporal plantar skin temperature.

article,Is bedding material a more effective thermal insulator than trap cover for small mammal trapping? A field experiment,"Torre, Ignasi and Bustamante, Paco and Flaquer, Carles and Oliverira, Flavio G.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Live trapping is a key technique for conducting ecological studies on small mammals. All-metal live traps are popular in monitoring schemes owing to their tested performance, lightweight design (aluminium) and foldability. However, capture represents a stressful situation for small mammals, particularly during cold seasons, when individuals are susceptible to cold weather starvation resulting from low temperature and insufficient food to maintain body temperature. Metal live traps provide limited protection against cold temperatures, and it is often recommended to use covers to buffer external temperature fluctuations and prevent entry of moisture. Here, we compared the insulative performance of a PVC cover designed for Sherman traps and of bedding material, using data loggers to record tem-perature and humidity inside traps. We conducted different experiments simulating field conditions (traps at night with a heat source inside) and different treatments (cover, bedding material) to test the thermal insulation capacity of three models of widely used commercial traps: Longworth, Sherman, and Heslinga. Our findings indicated that Longworth and Sherman traps were better insulated against ambient air temperature fluctuations than Heslinga traps (+2.0 degrees C warmer on average). Bedding material was paramount in reducing relative humidity and increasing thermal insulation capacity of traps (+3.1 degrees C), an effect that was strengthened when a PVC cover was additionally used (+4.2 degrees C). The covered traps prevented the direct entrance of rain and dew (reducing damp bedding), provided camouflage (reducing thefts), and improved thermal and humidity conditions of traps (potentially increasing survival of captive small mammals). Our results suggest that using covers and bedding materials can improve thermal and humidity conditions within live traps, thus reducing the metabolic costs of thermoregulation and increasing survival chances for trapped small mammals during cold seasons.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103738,118,NA,NA,103738,NA
article,Effects of dietary supplementation with L-arginine on the endogenous losses of amino acids in growing pigs exposed to heat stress,"Morales, Adriana and Valle, Jose A. and Castillo, Gilberto and Gonzalez, Fernanda and Hernandez, Cecilia and Htoo, John K. and Cervantes, Miguel",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Exposing pigs to heat stress (HS) provokes higher death of intestinal cells, resulting in elevated endogenous intestinal losses (EIL) of amino acids (AA) and damage to intestinal epithelia. Arginine (Arg) is precursor for the synthesis of polyamines, which are involved in proliferation of intestinal cells and restoration of the intestinal epithelia. Thus the effect of adding L-Arg to diets for HS pigs on the EIL of AA was analyzed. Twelve pigs (23.1 +/- 1.1 kg body weight) implanted with T-type cannulas at the end of ileum were individually housed and allowed 15-days for surgery recovery under thermoneutral (TN) conditions (22 +/- 2 degrees C). Following, the pigs were randomly assigned to one of three treatments: TN pigs fed a semi-purified, corn starch-3\% casein basal diet (TN-B); HS pigs with the basal diet (HS-B); HS pigs consuming the basal diet supplemented with 0.20\% L-Arg (HS-Arg). The experiment consisted of two 9-day periods; each period included 7-days of adaptation to their respective diet, followed by a 2-day ileal digesta collection period. Digesta was collected during 12 consecutive hours each day. The pigs were fed twice a-day. Ambient temperature (AT) inside the TN and HS rooms ranged from 18.6 to 27.6 degrees C and from 29.5 to 40.7 degrees C, respectively. Body temperature followed a pattern similar to that of AT. The daily EIL of indispensable AA increased (P < 0.01) in the HS-B pigs compared to both the TN-B and the HS-Arg pigs, however, there was no EIL difference between the TN-B and the HS-Arg pigs (P > 0.05). Likewise, with the exception of serine, daily losses of endogenous dispensable AA in the HS-B pigs were higher (P < 0.01) in comparison with those of TN-B and HS-Arg pigs. In summary, HS exposure compared to TN conditions increases the loss of endogenous AA, but dietary supplementation with L-Arg helped to counteract the negative HS effect.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103739,118,NA,NA,103739,Endogenous loss; Amino acids; Arg; Heat stress; Pigs
article,Effect of physiological hyperthermia on mitochondrial fuel selection in skeletal muscle of birds and mammals,"Barbe, Jessica and Roussel, Damien and Voituron, Yann",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Both birds and mammals have important thermogenic capacities allowing them to maintain high body temperatures, i.e., 37 degrees C and 40 degrees C on average in mammals and birds, respectively. However, during periods of high locomotor activity, the energy released during muscular contraction can lead to muscle temperature reaching up to 43-44 degrees C. Mitochondria are responsible for producing the majority of ATP through cellular respiration and metabolizing different substrates, including carbohydrates and lipids, to generate ATP. A limited number of studies comparing avian and mammalian species showed preferential utilization of specific substrates for mitochondrial energy at different metabolic intensities, but authors always measured at body temperature. The present study evaluated mitochondrial respiration rates and OXPHOS coupling efficiencies at 37 degrees C, 40 degrees C and 43 degrees C associated with pyruvate/malate (carbohydrate metabolism) or palmitoyl-carnitine/malate (lipid metabolism) as substrates in pigeons (Columba livia) and rats (Rattus norvegicus), a well-known pair in scientific literature and for their similar body mass. The data show different hyperthermia-induced responses between the two species with (i) skeletal muscle mitochondria from rats being more sensitive to rising temperatures than in pigeons, and (ii) the two species having different substrate preferences during hyperthermia, with rats oxidizing preferentially carbohydrates and pigeons lipids. By analyzing the interplay between temperature and substrate utilization, we describe a means by which endotherms deal with extreme muscular temperatures to provide enough ATP to support energy demands.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103719,117,NA,NA,103719,Mitochondrial respiration; Muscular temperature; Substrates; Endotherms; Sensitivity
article,Feeling the heat: Bumblebee workers show no acclimation capacity of upper thermal tolerance to simulated heatwaves,"Sepulveda, Yanet and Goulson, Dave",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Climate change is our most significant challenge in the 21st century and among the main drivers of biodiversity loss. Recent distributional shifts and declines in crucial pollinators, such as bumblebees, seem to be associated to this phenomenon. However, despite future climate projections on climate warming, few studies have assessed the ability of temperate bumblebees to acclimate to extreme weather events, such as heatwaves. This study estimates the upper critical thermal limits (Critical Thermal Maximum (CTmax) and Heat Coma Temperature (HCT)), of the bumblebee subspecies Bombus terrestris audax, and assesses whether CTmax increases following exposure to a simulated heatwave. The critical thermal maximum occurred between 48.9 and 52.7 degrees C, while the heat coma temperature varied between 50.7 and 53.4 degrees C. After measurement of HCT, around 23\% of bees survived 24 h or longer, but coordination was never recovered. There was no significant association between upper critical thermal limits and body mass, which highlights the need to investigate other factors to comprehend the mechanisms behind thermal tolerance limits. Furthermore, the heatwave treatments had no significant effect on the CTmax of bumblebee workers, indicating no acclimation capacity of upper thermal tolerance to simulated heatwaves. Our study provides insights into the upper thermal tolerance limits of Bombus terrestris audax and reveals that exposure to heatwave-like events does not change the upper thermal tolerance of bees, highlighting the need to develop effective strategies that might enable them to cope with extreme weather events.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103672,116,NA,NA,103672,Acclimation; Climate change; Heatwaves; Pollinators; Thermal tolerance

People exposed to extremely cold environments may suffer from cold damage, further aggravate trauma, trigger high disability and mortality rates, and even cause serious sequelae. To declare the effects and mechanisms of the extremely cold environment on the body after trauma, this paper reviews, firstly, physiological reaction of human body in an extremely cold environment. Then, the post-traumatic body response in an extremely cold environment was introduced, and finally, the sequelae of trauma in extremely cold environment was further summarized in the paper. The results indicated that extremely cold environment can cause a series of damage to the body, especially the body after trauma. The extremely cold factor is a double-edged sword, showing a favorable and unfavorable side in different aspects. Moreover, in addition to the trauma suffered by the body, the subsequent sequelae such as cognitive dysfunction, anxiety, depression and even posttraumatic stress disorder may also be induced.

In recent years, phase-change material (PCM) cooling devices have been increasingly used for rapid cooling after hyperthermia due to their superior capacity for heat absorption.Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the cooling performance and effectiveness of a PCM cooling blanket on heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) recovery after exercise-induced hyperthermia.Design: Randomized cross-over.Methods: The study participants were 12 male volunteers who were engaged in professional training and completed an endurance exercise for approximately 30 min in a hot and humid environment (temperature approximate to 30 degrees C; relative humidity approximate to 66\%). The participants underwent a 30-min cooling trial after exercise, receiving either treatment with a PCM cooling blanket (PCM group) or natural cooling (CON group). The Tcore, HR, and HRV time-domain indices were used for analysis.Results: The Tcore values were significantly lower in the PCM group during cooling. Reductions in the Tcore from precooling to 20 min of cooling were significantly greater in the PCM group than in the CON group. The HR in the PCM group was lower than that recorded in the CON group at 10 and 20 min of cooling. The reduction in HR during cooling from precooling was also significantly greater in the PCM group. HRV time-domain indices during cooling in the PCM group were significantly lower compared with the CON group while elevations in some HRV time-domain indices from precooling to postcooling were significantly greater in the PCM group than in the CON group.Conclusions: The PCM cooling blanket had good cooling performance and the ability to hasten recovery of both HR and HRV. It may serve as a feasible cooling choice during transport after exercise-induced hyperthermia.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103576,114,NA,NA,103576,Exertional heat stroke; Cooling performance; Heart rate; Heart rate variability; Recovery
article,ATP-induced hypothermia improves burn injury and relieves burn pain in mice,"Zhao, Yang and Liu, Junhao and Ding, Zhao and Ge, Wenhao and Wang, Shiming and Zhang, Jianfa",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Thermal burn injury is a severe and life-threatening form of trauma that presents a significant challenge to clinical therapy. Therapeutic hypothermia has been shown to be beneficial in various human pathologies. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) induces a hypothermic state that resembles hibernation-like suspended animation in mammals. This study investigates the potential protective role of ATP-induced hypothermia in thermal burn injury. Male C57BL/6 mice underwent a sham procedure or third-degree burn, and ATP-induced hypothermia was applied immediately or 1 h after burn injury. Our results show that ATP-induced hypothermia significantly improved burn depth progression and reduced collagen degradation. Moreover, hypothermia induced by ATP alleviated burn-induced hyperinfiammatory responses and oxidative stress. Metabolomic profiling revealed that ATP-induced hypothermia reversed the shifts of metabolic profiles of the skin in burn mice. In addition, ATP-induced hypothermia relieved nociceptive and infiammatory pain, as observed in the antinociceptive test. Our findings suggest that ATP-induced hypothermia attenuates burn injury and provides new insights into first-aid therapy after thermal burn injury.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103563,114,NA,NA,103563,ATP; Hypothermia; Skin; Burn; Oxidative stress; Pain
article,Hypothesised life cycle adaptation of stonefly (Plecoptera) in response to increased water temperatures,"Yoshimura, Mayumi",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Water temperature is the most important and critical factor for freshwater invertebrates and it fluctuates with an increase in air temperature. In this study, the effect of water temperature on egg development was clarified in Stavsolus japonicus, and the response to climate change in stoneflies with long egg periods were considered. Water temperatures prior to 43 days before hatching likely do not affect egg development in Stavsolus japonicus. Instead, they use egg diapause as an adaptive strategy to survive hot summer conditions. Increased water temperatures may cause migration to higher elevations for stoneflies that have lower adaptability in their egg development period, with populations eventually becoming stranded where no higher elevation or cooler habitat is available. Species extinction is expected to increase with increasing temperatures, leading to reduced biodiversity in many ecosystems. Indirect effects of water warming on maturation and reproduction may lead to substantial reductions in benthic invertebrate populations.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103533,113,NA,NA,103533,Benthic invertebrate; Diapause; Life cycle; Plecoptera; Stream; Water temperature
article,Effects of packing (load carrying) on body temperatures and their circadian rhythms in donkeys <i>(Equus asinus)</i> during the hot-dry season,"Ake, Ayodele Stephen and Ayo, Joseph Olusegun and Aluwong, Tagang and Mohammed, Aliyu",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The study aimed to evaluate the effects of packing (load carrying) on rectal and body surface temperatures and their circadian rhythmicity in donkeys during the hot-dry season. Twenty pack donkeys of both sexes (15 males and 5 non-pregnant females), aged 2-3 years, with average weight of 93 +/- 2.7 kg and divided into two groups randomly, served as experimental subjects. Group 1 donkeys (packing + trekking) were subjected to packing in addition to trekking, while group 2 (trekking only) did not carry any load. All the donkeys were trekked, covering a distance of 20 km. The procedure was repeated three times within the week, one day apart. During the experiment, dry-bulb temperature (DBT), relative humidity (RH) and temperature-humidity index (THI), wind speed and topsoil temperature were recorded; and rectal temperature (RT) and body surface temperature (BST) were measured before and immediately after packing. Starting from 16 h after the last packing, circadian rhythms of RT and BST were recorded at 3-h intervals for 27-h period. The RT and BST were measured by digital thermometer and non-contact infrared thermometer, respectively. The DBT and RH, especially after packing (35.83 +/- 0.2 degrees C and 20.00 +/- 0.0\%, respectively), were outside the thermoneutral zone for donkeys. The RT value (38.63 +/- 0.1 degrees C) in packing + trekking donkeys recorded immediately (15 min) after packing was higher (P < 0.05) than the value obtained in trekking only donkeys (37.27 +/- 0.1 degrees C). The overall mean RT recorded during the continuous 27-h period of measurement, starting from 16 h after the last packing procedure was higher (P < 0.05) in packing + trekking donkeys (36.93 +/- 0.2 degrees C) compared with trekking only donkeys (36.29 +/- 0.3 degrees C). The BSTs recorded in both groups were higher (P < 0.05) immediately after packing when compared with pre-packing values, but insignificant 16-h post-packing. The RT and BST values were generally higher in the photophase and lower during the scotophase in both groups of donkeys during the continuous recordings. The eye temperature was the closest to the RT, followed by scapular temperature, while the coronary band tem-perature was the farthest. The mesor of RT in packing + trekking donkeys (37.06 +/- 0.2 degrees C) was significantly higher than in donkeys that were trekked only (36.46 +/- 0.1 degrees C). The amplitude of RT in trekking only donkeys (1.20 +/- 0.1 degrees C) was wider (P < 0.05) than that obtained in packing + trekking donkeys (0.80 +/- 0.1 degrees C). The acrophase and bathyphase occurred later in packing + trekking donkeys (18:10 +/- 0.3 h and 6:10 +/- 0.3 h, respectively), compared to the trekking only donkeys (16:50 +/- 0.2 h and 4:50 +/- 0.2 h, respectively). In conclusion, exposure to thermally stressful prevailing environmental conditions during packing increased the body temperature responses, especially in packing + trekking donkeys. Packing significantly influenced the circadian rhythms of body temperatures in working donkeys, as evidenced by differences in circadian rhythm parameters in packing + trekking group, compared with trekking only donkeys during the hot-dry season.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103497,113,NA,NA,103497,Body surface temperature; Circadian rhythm; Heat stress; Packing; Rectal temperature

C. and Beaufils, R. and Chesneau, C. and Normand, H. and Bessot, N.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The main objective of this study was to validate gastrointestinal measurement with the e-Celsius (R) system composed of an ingestible electronic capsule and a monitor. Twenty-three healthy volunteers aged 18-59 years stayed at the hospital for 24 h under fasting conditions. They were only allowed for quiet activity and were asked to keep their sleeping habits. Subjects ingested a Jonah capsule and an e-Celsius (R) capsule, and a rectal probe and an esophageal probe were inserted. Mean temperature measured by the e-Celsius (R) device was lower than that measured by Vitalsense (R) (-0.12 +/- 0.22 degrees C; p < 0.001) and the rectal probe (-0.11 +/- 0.03<degrees>C; p = 0.003) and higher than that measured by the esophageal probe (0.17 +/- 0.05; p = 0.006). Mean difference (bias) and 95\% confidence intervals between temperature of e-Celsius capsule, Vitalsense Jonah capsule, esophageal probe, and rectal probe were computed using Bland and Altman procedure. The magnitude of the measurement bias is significantly greater when comparing the e-Celsius (R) and the Vitalsense (R) device pair with any other device pairs containing the esophageal probe. Amplitude of confidence interval between the e-Celsius (R) system and the Vitalsense (R) system was 0.67 degrees C. This amplitude was significantly lower than those of the esophageal probe-e-Celsius (R) pairing (0.83 degrees C; p = 0.027), of the esophageal probe-Vitalsense (0.78 degrees C; p = 0.046) and of the esophageal probe-rectal probe (0.83 degrees C; p = 0.002). The statistical analysis did not reveal any effect of time on the amplitude of bias, whatever the device concerned. When comparing missing data rate of the e-Celsius (R) system (0.23 +/- 0.15\%) and the Vitalsense (R) devices (0.70 +/- 0.11\%) during the whole experiment, no differences was observed (p = 0.09).

article,Thermal modeling of the respiratory turbinates in arctic and subtropical seals,"Flekkoy, Eirik G. and Folkow, Lars P. and Kjelstrup, Signe and Mason, Matthew J. and Wilhelmsen, Oivind",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Mammals possess complex structures in their nasal cavities known as respiratory turbinate bones, which help the animal to conserve body heat and water during respiratory gas exchange. We considered the function of the maxilloturbinates of two species of seals, one arctic (Erignathus barbatus), one subtropical (Monachus monachus). By means of a thermo-hydrodynamic model that describes the heat and water exchange in the turbinate region we are able to reproduce the measured values of expired air temperatures in grey seals (Halichoerus grypus), a species for which experimental data are available. At the lowest environmental temperatures, however, this is only possible in the arctic seal, and only if we allow for the possibility of ice forming on the outermost turbinate region. At the same time the model predicts that for the arctic seals, the inhaled air is brought to deep body temperature and humidity conditions in passing the maxilloturbinates. The modeling shows that heat and water conservation go together in the sense that one effect implies the other, and that the conservation is most efficient and most flexible in the typical environment of both species. By controlling the blood flow through the turbinates the arctic seal is able to vary the heat and water conservation substantially at its average habitat temperatures, but not at temperatures around-40 degrees C. The subtropical species has simpler maxilloturbinates, and our model predicts that it is unable to bring inhaled air to deep body conditions, even in its natural environment, without some congestion of the vascular mucosa covering the maxilloturbinates. Physiological control of both blood flow rate and mucosal congestion is expected to have profound effects on the heat exchange function of the max-illoturbinates in seals.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103402,112,NA,NA,103402,Respiratory turbinate; Water conservation; Body heat conservation; Arctic seal; Thermoregulation; Homeotherm
article,Dietary supplementation with chia polyphenols alleviates oxidative stress and improves egg nutritional quality in Japanese quails under heat stress,"Mas, Agustin Lucini and Bonansea, Rocio Ines and Fernandez, Maria Emilia and Kembro, Jackelyn Melissa and Labaque, Maria Carla and Wunderlin, Daniel Alberto and Baroni, Maria Veronica",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Heat stress in poultry is a major concern, especially in regions with hot summers and scarce cooling infrastructure. Dietary supplementation with antioxidants, such as polyphenols, has risen as a strategy to mitigate the physiological consequences of heat stress. A by-product of the extraction of oil from chia seeds, which is discarded if not used, could be a possible source of polyphenols. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of dietary supplementation with polyphenols from defatted chia seed cake on the general performance, and oxidative status of Japanese quail exposed to heat stress. Furthermore, productive performance, egg quality and yolk fatty acid composition were also assessed. A total of 36 females (96 days of age) were randomly assigned to different diets: BASAL (control), LDCP (low dose of chia polyphenols), or HDCP (high dose of chia polyphenols). Half the animals in each diet group were exposed to 34 degrees C for 9 h a day (Heat Stress; HS), while the other half remained at the standard 24 degrees C (No Heat Stress; NHS). After 23 days of experimental conditions, animals under HS showed higher body temperatures and time spent panting, but lower egg laying rate. Moreover, HS modulated the activity of catalase and glutathione peroxidase enzymes, increasing lipid peroxidation in serum and liver; and increased saturated fatty acids in egg yolk. Supplementation with chia polyphenols helped to mitigate the HS effects, especially on glutathione peroxidase activity, decreasing lipid peroxidation. In addition, supplementation with HDCP showed the highest proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids in liver and egg yolk. In conclusion, the use of defatted chia seed cake could represent a sustainable strategy to mitigate heat stress effects on Japanese quail, due to its capacity to decrease oxidative stress and improve the nutritional quality of egg, while decreasing the amount of waste generated by the food industry.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103421,111,NA,NA,103421,Chia; Heat stress; Egg quality; Fatty acid composition; Polyphenol; Poultry nutrition

In this paper, we used a thermal infrared camera to obtain continuous thermal images of death fertilized duck eggs (DFDE) on the 16th day of incubation and alive fertilized duck eggs (AFDE) hatched for 16-19 days in a 20 degrees C environment. By observing the temperature drop curve of egg surface, we extracted and visualized five features that could reflect the activity information of duck eggs. And we used K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naive Bayesian (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to establish the activity information detection models for different incubation days. The results showed that KNN could better distinguish the activity of eggs at the 16th and the 17th day of incubation, with F1-score of 85.43\% and 85.98\%, respectively. The SVM showed better results at the 18th and the 19th day of incubation, with F1-score of 90.57\% and 96.3\%, respectively.

In this study, we monitored the body temperature of healthy animals during RFR exposure in real time using an implantable iButton data logger. A reverberation chamber system for small animals was used for this radiofrequency (RF) exposure in vivo study. Healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into two groups: with versus without iButton implantation (n = 20 per group). Each group was further divided into a sham-exposed and RF-exposed group (n = 10 per sub-group). Rats were exposed to a 1,760-MHz long-term evolution (LTE) signal in the reverberation chamber system at a whole-body average specific absorption rate of 0 W/kg (sham-exposed) or 4 W/kg (RF-exposed) for 6 h. The body temperature of iButton-implanted rats was recorded using an intraperitoneally implanted iButton every minute over 6 h of RF exposure, whereas that of non-implanted rats was measured directly using a rectal thermometer immediately before and after the 6-h RF exposure period. The temperature values measured by the two types of thermometers were significantly positively correlated (r = 0.63, P < 0.01, linear regression), and changes in body temperatures recorded in iButton-implanted and non-implanted rats measured using two thermometers after 6 h of RF exposure were maintained within <1 degrees C (P = 0.87, general linear model, followed by univariate model). Similar results were obtained for rectal thermometer measurements (P = 0.12, paired t-test). These results suggest that RF exposure at a whole-body average specific absorption rate of 4 W/kg does not induce significant changes in body temperature in healthy rats over a 6-h RF exposure period.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103350,110,NA,NA,103350,Radiofrequency radiation; Body temperature; Thermometers; Rat
article,Validity of a wearable core temperature estimation system in heat using patch-type sensors on the chest,"Tokizawa, Ken and Shimuta, Toru and Tsuchimoto, Hirofumi",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"This study aimed to evaluate the reliability of a patch-type sensor on the upper chest region that uses a dual-heat -flux method to estimate core temperature under various heat conditions. The participants' esophageal and rectal temperatures (Teso and Trec) were measured with real-time monitoring of predicted core temperature (Tpre) using the patch. Twenty-one volunteers wearing work clothes and nine volunteers wearing protective clothing walked (5.0 km/h) for an hour at 35 degrees C. During exercise, Teso increased to 37.9 +/- 0.3 degrees C and 38.2 +/- 0.2 degrees C for each group, respectively. The root mean squared errors (RMSEs) were 0.18 +/- 0.05 degrees C and 0.25 +/- 0.08 degrees C between Teso and Tpre and were 0.31 +/- 0.10 degrees C and 0.34 +/- 0.11 degrees C between Trec and Tpre in each clothing condition, respectively. In addition, 11 volunteers walked for an hour at 30 degrees C or 40 degrees C. The Teso during exercise increased to 37.7 +/- 0.3 degrees C and 38.2 +/- 0.3 degrees C, respectively.

Nicolas",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Several days under the influence of high environmental temperature negatively impact on some immune-related variables of poultry species. However, it is little known whether this exposure affects differentially the immune response on different life stages. This study was aimed at characterizing the immune responses of juvenile and adult female Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix) when exposed to a cyclic chronic heat stressor. Independent sets of juvenile (24) and adult (21) female Japanese quail were bred under thermoneutral conditions or exposed to an increasing temperature from 24 degrees C to 34 degrees C, for 8 h along nine consecutive days (chronic heat stressor). The inflammatory response against a mitogen, the antibody production against a non-pathogenic antigen and the heterophil to lymphocyte (H/L) ratio were measured after the ninth day of chronic heat exposure. Adult females had a more robust inflammatory response compared to their juvenile counterpart. The inflammatory response, the production of antibodies, and the H/L ratio were suppressed by the chronic heat stressor in the juvenile females; while in their adult counterpart, the production of antibodies was not affected by the chronic heat stress. Under the exposure of high environmental temperatures, juvenile females would be more susceptible to potentially harmful pathogens that require a robust immune response, while their adult counterparts would be able to mount an optimal acquired immune response against pathogens requiring this type of response. Our findings suggest that while heat stress during breeding should be avoided in both juvenile and adult females, more precautions should be taken during early life stages.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103257,107,NA,NA,103257,Ontogeny; Heat stress; Immunity; Japanese quail; Development

Unraveling the physiological and metabolic responses to AHS could help to provide theoretical basis for developing strategies to mitigate hyperthermia-induced muscle damage. Here, we investigated the effects of different durations of AHS (45 degrees C for 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 h) on differentiated avian myotubes. Results indicated that AHS destroyed the morphology of differentiated myotubes, and the degree of damage increased with the prolongation of AHS. Dynamic transcriptomic profiling identified 67, 467, 1355 and 2627 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h of heat stress, respectively. Only 50 DEGs were regulated across all time points. In addition, genes involved in cell cycle, metabolic process and immune response were upregulated upon short-term heat stress (0.5 and 1 h). However, these thermal-tolerance responses were suppressed upon prolonged heat stress (2 and 4 h). Furthermore, the quick response of molecular chaperone genes might be major targets for acclimation to hyperthermia. Overall, the current transcriptome analyses reveal the dynamic changes of avian myotubes to AHS and promote an understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the heat stress response in poultry.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103235,106,NA,NA,103235,Acute heat stress; Myotube; Transcriptome; Heat shock protein

K.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The present investigation evaluated the effect of microclimate modification on feed intake, growth performance, and hemato-biochemical profile of Murrah buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) heifers during summer. Twenty-four buffalo heifers, between 15 and 20 months of age with an average body weight of 363.75 +/- 11.27 kg, were randomly assigned to 4 groups based on their age and body weight. The heifers of the T0 (control) group were kept under the shed without any cooling treatment, while the animals in group T1 were tied with a cooling jacket. Buffalo heifers of group T2 were subjected to a cooling jacket with forced ventilation and animals in group T3 were treated with intermittent sprinkling (10 min., at 2 h intervals) and forced ventilation between 9.00 AM and 6.00 PM during the experiment. The ambient temperature inside the shed and core body temperature were reduced in groups T1, T2, and T3 compared to T0. Heifers had higher dry matter intake when subjected to cooling treatments T1, T2, and T3, whereas water intake was reduced in T2 and T3 groups. The animals in T2 and T3 groups attained higher average daily weight gain, while the feed conversion was better in the T3 group compared to T0. The hematological measures such as hemoglobin, total erythrocyte count, and total leucocyte count were found higher in T0. The serum glucose, sodium, and potassium levels increasedand alkaline phosphatase activity decreased in groups T1, T2 and T3 when compared with T0. It can be concluded that the provision of intermittent sprinkling and cooling jacket in combination with forced ventilation could improve the microclimate, which in turn could enhance the performance of Murrah heifers during hot summer days in the tropics.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103163,104,NA,NA,103163,Buffalo heifers; Cooling jacket; Forced ventilation; Intermittent sprinkling; Microclimate

The traits are often affected by a multiplicity of species dependent and external factors. Our objective was to investigate thermal biology of Liolaemus ruibali in a high altitude cold desert at the arid Puna region, Argentina. We address the following question: do sex and seasonal variations in environmental temperature induce changes in the ecophysiological traits? We measured and compared the operative temperatures between fall and spring; and between sexes and seasons, we compared the ecophysiological traits of lizards, microenvironmental temperatures and thermoregulatory behavior. Air and operative temperatures were different between seasons. We found an effect of season-sex interaction on field body temperatures, preferred temperatures, panting threshold and thermal quality. The voluntary and critical temperatures presented seasonal variation in relation to changes in environmental temperatures, suggesting thermal acclimatization. We note behavioral changes between seasons, with the substrate being the main resource for gaining heat in spring. We conclude that Liolaemus ruibali is an efficient thermoregulator; it is a eurythermic lizard and presents phenotypic plasticity in different ecophysiological and behavioral traits induced by sex and seasonality.

article,Sub-critical limits are viable alternatives to critical thermal limits,"Braschler, Brigitte and Chown, Steven L. and Duffy, Grant A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Thermal traits are frequently used to explain variation in species distributions, abundance, and sensitivity to climate change. Due to their utility and ease of measurement, critical thermal limits in particular have proliferated across the ecophysiological literature. Critical limit assays can, however, have deleterious or even lethal effects on individuals and there is growing recognition that intermediate metrics of performance can provide a further, nuanced understanding of how species interact with their environments. Meanwhile, the scarcity of data describing sub-critical or voluntary limits, which have been proposed as alternatives to critical limits and can be collected under less extreme conditions, reduces their value in comparative analyses and broad-scale syntheses. To overcome these limitations and determine if sub-critical limits are viable proxies for upper and lower critical thermal limits we measured and compared the critical and sub-critical thermal limits of 2023 ants representing 51 species. Sub-critical limits in isolation were a satisfactory linear predictor for both individual and species critical limits and when species identity was also considered there were substantial gains in variance explained. These gains indicate that a species-specific conversion factor can further improve estimates of critical traits using sub-critical proxies. Sub-critical limits can, therefore, be integrated into broader syntheses of critical limits and confidently used to calculate common ecological metrics, such as warming tolerance, so long as uncertainty in estimates is explicitly acknowledged. Although lower thermal traits exhibited more variation than their upper counterparts, the stronger phylogenetic signal of lower thermal traits indicates that appropriate conversions for lower thermal traits can be inferred from congenerics or other closely related taxa.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103106,101,NA,NA,103106,Ectotherms; Formicidae; Insect physiology; Macrophysiology; Warming tolerance

Heat stress causes deleterious effects on welfare, immunology and physiology of farm animals with a resultant impact on their productivity as the use of body resources is re-organized and the metabolic priorities of animals shift away from production, growth, health and reproduction. It is imperative to understand the mechanisms involved in the thermoregulation of animals under tropical conditions in order to develop appropriate strategies for their improvement. This review focuses on the available data on the increasing global temperature and the adverse impact of tropical conditions on animals' adaptive mechanism affected during thermal stress on production performance, intestinal and ileal microbiome, physiological responses, antioxidant system, metabolic responses, cellular and molecular response, adaptive mechanism strategies to heat stress and also strategies to palliate environmental stress on livestock under humid tropical conditions including environmental manipulation, genetic opportunity, epigenetic and feeding modification. Overall, the present review has identified the disturbance in the physiological indices of tropical livestock and the need for concerted efforts in ameliorating the adverse impacts of high ambient temperature aggravated by high humidity on livestock in tropical environments. Further research is needed on genotype-by-environment interaction on the thermotolerance of different livestock species in the tropics.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103077,100,NA,NA,103077,Environment; Tropics; Performance; Intervention; Livestock
article,A simplified approach to describe the mean skin temperature variations during prolonged running exercise,"Tanda, Giovanni",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Skin blood flow and skin temperature play a fundamental role in the thermoregulatory processes and are expected to largely change in response to a prolonged running exercise. The skin temperature changes have been documented in the literature, mainly through infrared thermographic measurements performed before, after, and, in a limited number of studies, during the exercise. After an initial reduction probably ascribed to skin vasoconstriction, the further skin temperature modifications with time, measured in reference papers during a steady and prolonged run, do not show a common behaviour, probably due to different exercise intensities and environmental conditions reported in these studies. This research aimed to develop a simplified method for describing the skin temperature changes during running exercise through the theoretical solutions of the dynamic energy balance of the human body in the early and late time periods, i.e., close to the onset and the end of exercise. These two asymptotic solutions for the skin temperature, having a largely dissimilar trend, collide at a time instant likely associated with the switch from skin vasoconstriction to vasodilation. Examples of application of the proposed method, based on the intersection of asymptotes, were provided. It was also demonstrated its capability to interpret the experimental skin temperature variations with time for constant-load running exercises reported in the literature under different levels of exercise intensity and environmental conditions.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103005,99,NA,NA,103005,Constant-load running exercise; Prolonged running exercise; Skin temperature; Intersection of asymptotes
article,Within-patch and edge microclimates vary over a growing season and are amplified during a heatwave: Consequences for ectothermic insects,"Gols, R. and Ojeda-Prieto, L. M. and Li, K. and van Der Putten, W. H. and Harvey, J. A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Embedded in longer term warming are extreme climatic events such as heatwaves and droughts that are increasing in frequency, duration and intensity. Changes in climate attributes such as temperature are often measured over larger spatial scales, whereas environmental conditions to which many small ectothermic arthropods are exposed are largely determined by small-scale local conditions. Exposed edges of plant patches often exhibit significant short-term (daily) variation to abiotic factors due to wind exposure and sun radiation. By contrast, within plant patches, abiotic conditions are generally much more stable and thus less variable. Over an eight-week period in the summer of 2020, including an actual heatwave, we measured small-scale (1 m(2)) temperature variation in patches of forbs in experimental mesocosms. We found that soil surface temperatures at the edge of the mesocosms were more variable than those within mesocosms. Drought treatment two years earlier, amplified this effect but only at the edges of the mesocosms. Within a plant patch both at the soil surface and within the canopy, the temperature was always lower than the ambient air temperature. The temperature of the soil surface at the edge of a patch may exceed the ambient air temperature when ambient air temperatures rise above 23 degrees C. This effect progressively increased with ambient temperature. We discuss how microscale-variation in temperature may affect small ectotherms such as insects that have limited ability to thermoregulate, in particular under conditions of extreme heat.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103006,99,NA,NA,103006,Arthropods; Climate extremes; Drought; Global warming; Heatwaves; Insects; Microhabitat; Micro climate
article,Impact of intraspecific variation on measurements of thermal tolerance in bumble bees,"Maebe, Kevin and De Baets, Annelien and Vandamme, Peter and Vereecken, Nicolas J. and Michez, Denis and Smagghe, Guy",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Climate change is an important driver of bee decline despite the fact that many species might respond to climate change differently. One method to predict how a species will respond to climate change is to identify its thermal tolerance limits. However, differences in thermal tolerance might also occur among distant populations of the same species based on their local environment or even among castes of social insects. Here, we investigated intraspecific differences in thermal tolerance among subspecies of the large earth bumble bee, Bombus terrestris (Apidae). We determined the critical thermal minima and maxima (CTmin and CTmax, respectively) of workers and queens from three lab-reared B. terrestris subspecies (B. t. terrestris, B. t. audax, and B. t. canariensis) which originated from different thermal environments. Our results showed that caste has an influence on critical thermal minima, with queens being most cold-tolerant, but the values of critical thermal maxima were not correlated to caste or size. The thermal tolerance of workers did not differ among the subspecies. Although heat tolerance was similar in queens, B. t. canariensis queens (originating from the warmest environments) were the least cold tolerant. Overall, we showed that B. terrestris may be generally robust against climate warming, but that particular subspecies and/or populations may be more vulnerable to extreme temperature variability. Future research should focus on responses of B. terrestris populations to short, extreme thermal events.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103002,99,NA,NA,103002,Critical thermal limits; Thermal tolerance; Bombus terrestris; Subspecies; Castes; Body size

Methods: 12 trained male cyclists (age 31.2 +/- 7; weight 71.3 +/- 7 kg, VO2max: 58.4 +/- 3.7 mL/kg/min) randomly performed two Time to Exhaustion Tests (TTE) at 75\% of normothermic peak power output (PPO), one in normothermia (N,18 degrees C-50\% RH) and one in the heat (H,35 degrees C-50\% RH), before and after a VSTAP intervention, consisting of 3 days-90 min exercise (10min at 30\% of PPO+80 min at 50\% of PPO) in H (approximate to 4.5h of heat exposure). Performance time of TTEs and physiological and perceptual variables of both TTEs and training sessions (T1, T2 and T3) were evaluated. Results: Magnitude Based Inferences (MBI) revealed 92/6/1\% and 62/27/11\% chances of positive/trivial/ negative effects of VSTAP of improving performance in H (+17\%) and in N (+9\%), respectively. Heart Rate (HR) decreased from T1 to T3 (p < 0.001) and T2 to T3 (p < 0.001), whereas Tympanic Temperature (TyT) decreased from T1 to T2 (p = 0.047) and from T1 to T3 (p = 0.007). Furthermore, despite the increased tolerance to target Power Output (PO) throughout training sessions, RPE decreased from T1 to T3 (p = 0.032). Conclusions: The VSTAP determined meaningful physiological (i.e. decreased HR and TyT) and perceptual (i.e. decreased RPE) adaptations to submaximal exercise. Furthermore, showing good chances to improve performance in the heat, it represents a valid acclimation strategy to be implemented when no longer acclimation period is possible.

article,"Too hot to handle? Behavioural plasticity during incubation in a small, Australian passerine","Sharpe, Lynda L. and Bayter, Camilo and Gardner, Janet L.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Global warming and intensifying extreme heat events may affect avian reproductive success and costs, particularly in hot, arid environments. It is unclear how breeding birds alter their behaviour in response to rapid climate change, and whether such plasticity will be sufficient to offset rising temperatures. We examine whether a small, open-cup nesting, passerine - the Jacky Winter Microeca fascinans - in semi-arid Australia, exhibits similar levels of behavioural plasticity when incubating under high temperatures as low, and how heat impacts upon parental effort, body mass change and reproductive success. At high temperatures, female effort increased. Females doubled nest attendance between 28 degrees C and 40 degrees C, switching from incubating to shading eggs at approx. 30 degrees C. Egg-shading females panted to avoid hyperthermia. Panting increased with temperature and sun exposure. Male breeding effort was linked to temperature extremes. In cold conditions, males provisioned their mates heavily, buffering females from additional energetic costs, and males suffered a loss of body mass. In extreme heat, males helped shade eggs (although they never incubated). The likelihood of male egg-shading increased with temperature, but level of contribution was positively related to sun exposure. Hatching success declined with air temperatures >35 degrees C. Egg mortality reached 100 at air temperatures >42.5 degrees C. Parents continued to attend unviable eggs (for up to two weeks), suggesting egg-loss from heat exposure is a recent phenomenon. Although pairs exhibited considerable behavioural plasticity - including positioning nests to maximize afternoon shade - this was insufficient to counter extreme temperatures. In 2019, one hot day (45 degrees C) effectively terminated reproduction two months early, and was associated with a 50\% decrease in reproductive success. The increasing frequency, intensity and earlier arrival of extreme heat events is likely to pose a major threat to avifauna populations in hot, arid environments, due to increased parental costs, reduced reproductive success and direct mortality.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102921,98,NA,NA,102921,Behavioural plasticity; Climate change; Extreme heat events; Heat dissipation; Incubation; Thermoregulation

K.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The present experiment was aimed to study differential expression of miRNAs and related mRNAs during heat stress (HS) in buffalo heifers. Twelve Murrah buffalo heifers aged between 1.5 and 2.0 years, weighting between 250 and 300 Kg were randomly assigned into two equal groups. The animals were kept in the psychrometric chamber under Thermo-neutral (TN; THI = 72) and HS (THI = 87-90) conditions for 6 h every day between 1000 and 1600 h for 21 days. The blood sampling was done at 1500 h on 15th day of the experiment and physiological parameters viz. pulse rate (PR), respiratory rate (RR) and rectal temperature (RT) were recorded at 1500 h on day -5, -3, -1, 0, +1, +3, +5 with respect to blood sampling. PBMCs were used for extraction of miRNAs and total RNA; and first strand cDNA was synthesized. qPCR was performed for relative gene expression studies. Physiological, hematological (erythrocytic indices), biochemical (triglycerides, urea, ALT, AST, LDH), redox (SOD, ROS) and endocrine parameters (T-4) altered significantly (P < 0.05) during HS as compared to TN. Out of eight targeted miRNAs only four were expressed in buffalo heifers. The relative expression of bta-mir-142, btamir-1248 and bta-mir-2332 was significantly (P < 0.05) up-regulated whereas expression of bta-mir-2478 was significantly (P < 0.05) down-regulated during HS as compared to TN. The relative expression of the predicted target genes i.e. HSF1, HSP60, HSP70, HSPA8 and HSP90 were significantly (P < 0.05) up-regulated whereas HSF4 expression was significantly (P < 0.05) down-regulated during HS as compared to TN. It can be concluded that a THI of 87-90 could lead to a moderate HS in buffalo heifers.

Methods: 8 males performed heat stress tests (HST) (45 min of cycling at 50\% of VO2max in 40 degrees C, 40\% RH) before and after heat acclimation sessions. Acclimation sessions were either three consecutive bouts of HWI (40 min of submersion at 40 degrees C) or EHA (40 min of cycling at 50\% VO2max in 40 degrees C, 40\% RH). Results: Average change in tympanic temperature (T-Tympanic) was significantly higher following HWI (2.1 degrees C +/- 0.4) compared to EHA (1.5 degrees C +/- 0.4) (P < 0.05). Decreases in peak heart rate (HR) (HWI: -10 bpm +/- 8; EHA: -6 +/- 7), average HR (-7 bpm +/- 6; -3 +/- 4), and average core temperature (-0.4 degrees C +/- 0.3; -0.2 +/- 0.4) were evident following acclimation (P < 0.05), but not different between interventions (P > 0.05). Peak rate of perceived exertion (RPEPeak) decreased for HWI and EHA (P < 0.05). Peak thermal sensation (TSPeak) decreased following HWI (P < 0.05) but was not different between interventions (P > 0.05). Plasma volume increased in both intervention groups (HWI: 5.9\% +/- 5.1; EHA: 5.4\% +/- 3.7) but was not statistically different (P > 0.05). Conclusion: HWI induced significantly greater thermal strain compared to EHA at equivalent temperatures during time-matched exposures. However, the greater degree of thermal strain did not result in between intervention differences for cardiovascular, thermoregulatory, or perceptual variables. Findings suggest three HWI sessions may be a potential means to lower HR, TCore, and perceptual strain during exercise in the heat.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102898,97,NA,NA,102898,Acclimation; Heat stress; Heat illness; Hyperthermia; Thermoregulation; Passive
article,A novel cooling method using carbon dioxide-rich water after passive heating,"Hayashi, Keiji",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In the event of a marked rise in body temperature, it is often necessary to reduce the temperature quickly. One method to rapidly drop body temperature is cold water immersion. Because carbon dioxide (CO2)-rich water causes cutaneous vasodilation, it may be that CO2-rich water reduces body temperature faster than fresh water. To test that idea, I compared the effects of CO2-rich and tap water immersion on auditory canal temperature (Tac) after passive heating. Nine healthy male subjects participated in the study. Subjects were first immersed for 15 min in a tap water bath at 40 ?C to raise body temperature. They then moved to a tap water or CO2-rich water bath at 30 ?C to reduce body temperature. Immersion in 40 ?C tap water caused Tac to rise 0.64 ? 0.11 ?C in the tap water session and 0.71 ? 0.25 ?C in the CO2-rich water session (P 0.05). During the 30 ?C water immersion, Tac declined and was significantly lower in CO2-rich water than in tap water. Cooling rates were 0.06 ? 0.04 ?C/ min in tap water and 0.11 ? 0.05 ?C/min in CO2-rich water (P < 0.05). In addition, both thermal sensation (3.2 ? 1.0 vs. 2.1 ? 0.9; P < 0.01) and thermal comfort (1.2 ? 0.4 vs. 2.1 ? 0.8; P < 0.01) were significantly better in CO2-rich water than tap water. These results suggest that CO2-rich water immersion reduces Tac 1.7 times faster than tap water immersion, and that CO2-rich water immersion cools the body more comfortably than tap water immersion.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102843,96,NA,NA,102843,Body temperature; Cutaneous vasodilation; Cooling; Water immersion
article,Impaired autophagy following <i>ex vivo</i> heating at physiologically relevant temperatures in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from elderly adults,"McCormick, James J. and King, Kelli E. and Cote, Melissa D. and Meade, Robert D. and Akerman, Ashley P. and Kenny, Glen P.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"With the increasing threat of climate change and the accompanying rise in the frequency and severity of extreme heat events, there are growing health concerns for heat-vulnerable elderly adults. Elderly adults are at increased risk of developing heat-related injuries, in part due to age-related declines in thermoregulatory and cellular function. Regarding the latter, the process of autophagy is activated as a cellular protective mechanism to counter heat-induced stress, but the extent that heat stress activates autophagy in elderly adults is not known. Further, the interplay between autophagy, the heat shock response (HSR), the acute inflammatory response, and apoptosis remains poorly understood in elderly adults. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine changes in autophagy, the HSR, inflammation, and apoptosis following increasing levels of ex vivo heat stress representative of physiologically relevant increases in body core temperatures (37-41 degrees C). Whole blood from 20 elderly adults (72 + 4 years; 14 men, 6 women) was heated (via water immersion) to temperatures representative of normal resting conditions (normothermia; 37 degrees C), in addition to moderate and severe heat stress conditions (39, and 41 degrees C, respectively) for 90 min. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated and protein markers of autophagy, the HSR, acute inflammation, and apoptosis were examined. No significant increases in markers of autophagy or the HSR were observed following any temperature condition. However, an increase in acute inflammation was observed above baseline following moderate heat stress (39 degrees C), with further increases in inflammation and apoptosis observed during severe heat stress (41 degrees C). Our findings indicate that PBMCs from elderly adults do not exhibit increases in autophagy or the HSR following severe heat stress, potentially contributing to the elevated risk of cellular dysfunction seen in elderly adults during heat stress.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102790,95,NA,NA,102790,Autophagy; Heat shock response; HSP70; HSP90; Apoptosis; Inflammation; Aging

We have for the first time provided empirical data by using a combination of field and lab-based studies with a robust sample size (360 adults, 1000 tadpoles) for Hazara Torrent Frog (Allopaa hazarensis) and Murree Hills Frog (Nanorana vicina). In this study, we examined how tadpoles responded to different temperatures through metamorphosis, body size, developmental complications or deformities, fitness and survival. We found that the tadpoles of A. hazarensis and N. vicina showed the same response to elevated temperatures under laboratory conditions including faster metamorphosis, reduction in the body size, more frequent developmental complications or deformities such as edema and tail kinks, lower fitness and higher mortality at elevated temperatures (>26 degrees C). The comparison of thermal sensitivity between the two species showed that N. vicina was more sensitive to higher temperatures. Pakistan has been experiencing changes in climatic patterns, and the ecosystems in northern Pakistan are losing biodiversity due to increasing temperature, frequency of drought and intensity of floods.

article,Deep body and surface temperature responses to hot and cold environments in the zebra finch,"Szafranska, Paulina Anna and Andreasson, Fredrik and Nord, Andreas and Nilsson, Jan-Ake",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Global warming increasingly challenges thermoregulation in endothermic animals, particularly in hot and dry environments where low water availability and high temperature increase the risk of hyperthermia. In birds, unfeathered body parts such as the head and bill work as `thermal windows', because heat flux is higher compared to more insulated body regions. We studied how such structures were used in different thermal environments, and if heat flux properties change with time in a given temperature. We acclimated zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) to two different ambient temperatures, `cold' (5 degrees C) and `hot' (35 degrees C), and measured the response in core body temperature using a thermometer, and head surface temperature using thermal imaging. Birds in the hot treatment had 10.3 degrees C higher head temperature than those in the cold treatment. Thermal acclimation also resulted in heat storage in the hot group: core body temperature was 1.1 degrees C higher in the 35 degrees C group compared to the 5 degrees C group. Hence, the thermal gradient from core to shell was 9.03 degrees C smaller in the hot treatment. Dry heat transfer rate from the head was significantly lower in the hot compared to the cold treatment after four weeks of thermal acclimation. This reflects constraints on changes to peripheral circulation and maximum body temperature. Heat dissipation capacity from the head region increased with acclimation time in the hot treatment, perhaps because angiogenesis was required to reach peak heat transfer rate. We have shown that zebra finches meet high environmental temperature by heat storage, which saves water and energy, and by peripheral vasodilation in the head, which facilitates dry heat loss. These responses will not exclude the need for evaporative cooling, but will lessen the amount of energy expend on body temperature reduction in hot environments.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102776,94,NA,NA,102776,(Max 6): heat dissipation; Zebra finch; Thermal window; Hyperthermia; Thermoregulation; Thermal imaging

Experimental animals included 28 clinically healthy RSGs divided into treated group (n = 14); each administered L-glutamine at 0.2 g/kg body weight, dissolved in 10 mL distilled water, and control group (n = 14); each administered 10 mL distilled water, per os once daily for 21 days. The ambient temperature and relative humidity recorded daily for 4 weeks were used to calculate the temperature-humidity index. Three millilitres of blood sample was collected from each goat by jugular venipuncture for haematology, while rectal temperature (RT), heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) were also measured once weekly at weeks 0 (before), 1, 2, 3 (during) and 4 (after L-glutamine administration). The haematological, RT, HR and RR data obtained weekly were analysed using repeated-measures one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey's post-hoc test to evaluate differences between periods, and between treated and control groups. The PCV, haemoglobin concentration and RBC count were higher (P < 0.05) in the treated group compared to the control group during the period of L-glutamine administration. These differences were sustained till week 4.

Chronic and acute heat stresses cause extensive morphological damage in animals, but few reports have focused on the effects of chronic and acute heat stresses on ovarian function and heat shock protein (HSP) gene expression during ovarian injury. In this study, we subjected female mice to chronic and acute heat stresses; we then calculated the ovary index, examined ovary microstructure, and measured the expression of multiple HSP family genes. Chronic heat stress reduced whole-body and ovarian growth but had little effect on the ovarian index; acute heat stress did not alter whole-body or ovarian weight. Both chronic and acute heat stresses impaired ovary function by causing the dysfunction of granular cells. Small HSP genes increased rapidly after heat treatment, and members of the HSP40, HSP70, and HSP90 families were co-expressed to function in the regulation of the heat stress response.

article,Tumour shape-dependent microwave hyperthermia using a novel coaxial micro-cut slot antenna,"Shamekhi, Leila and Sayehvand, Habib-Olah and Karami, Hamidreza",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Given that the effectiveness of interstitial hyperthermia for cancer treatment is related to the temperature achieved during the ablation process, there is a need for an accurate understanding of the required temperature distribution which is affected by the physical shape and form of tumours. Although a maximum peak temperature value and minimum backward heating are desired, the temperature distribution needs to be not only high but also uniformly extended over a section instead of at one peak point, especially when a roughly oval-shaped tumour is aligned with the antenna. In this case, achieving a high temperature peak destroys only the central cancerous cells after the first minutes of ablation, leaving the cells on the side alive. In this paper, a complex model was extended for the study of the heat distribution of an antenna over a porous liver composed of blood, cancerous cells, and normal tissue. Three different types of antenna were analysed: single-slot, double-slot, and dipole-tip. A novel structure made up of the single-slot antenna with a micron cut, named the micro-cut slot (MCS) antenna, was proposed and analysed. Thanks to the new structure, high uniform temperature distribution with minimum backward heating was achieved. The extended model equations, which encompass a coupled nonlinear set of transient Maxwell's electromagnetic equations, extended Darcy-Brinkman equation, and local thermal non-equilibrium equations for porous medium approximation, were solved numerically using the novel alternating direction implicit, finite-difference time-domain approach. The results showed that each type of antenna could be useful if chosen according to the shape of the tumour. In comparison with previously used antennas, the MCS antenna presented a good combination of the required goals of achieving uniform high temperature distribution and minimum backward heating.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102473,88,NA,NA,102473,Microwave hyperthermia; Micro-cut slot antenna; Tumour shape; Blood-tissue interfaces

The course and outcome of many wildlife diseases are context-dependent, and therefore change depending on the behaviour of hosts and environmental response of the pathogen. 2. Contemporary declines in amphibian populations are widely attributed to chytridiomycosis, caused by the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Despite the thermal sensitivity of the pathogen and its amphibian hosts, we do not understand how host thermal regimes experienced by frogs in the wild directly influence pathogen growth. 3. We tested how thermal regimes experienced by the rainforest frog Litoria rheocola in the wild influence pathogen growth in the laboratory, and whether these responses differ from pathogen growth under available environmental thermal regimes. 4. Frog thermal regimes mimicked in the laboratory accelerated pathogen growth during conditions representative of winter at high elevations more so than if temperatures matched air or stream water temperatures. By contrast, winter frog thermal regimes at low elevations slowed pathogen growth relative to air temperatures, but not water temperatures. 5. The growth pattern of the fungus under frog thermal regimes matches field prevalence and intensity of infections for this species (high elevation winter > high elevation summer > low elevation winter > low elevation summer), whereas pathogen growth trajectories under environmental temperatures did not match these patterns. 6. If these laboratory results translate into field responses, tropical frogs may be able to reduce disease impacts by regulating their body temperatures to limit pathogen growth (e.g., by using microhabitats that facilitate basking to reach high temperatures); in other cases, the environment may limit the ability of frogs to thermoregulate such that individuals are more vulnerable to this pathogen (e.g., in dense forests at high elevations). 7. Species-specific thermoregulatory behaviour, and interactions with and constraints imposed by the environment, are therefore essential to understanding and predicting the spatial and temporal impacts of this global disease.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102472,87,NA,NA,102472,Amphibian chytrid fungus; Amphibian decline; Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; Body temperature regulation; Host thermoregulation; Litoria rheocola; Pathogen fitness; Physiological model
article,A preliminary investigation about the observation of regional skin temperatures following cumulative training loads in triathletes during training camp,"Ignacio Priego-Quesada, Jose and Oficial-Casado, Fran and Gandia-Soriano, Alexis and Carpes, Felipe P.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"There are controversial results in the literature concerning the concept that cumulative training load could affect basal skin temperature in the days following training sessions. The objective was to measure skin temperature in triathletes during a training camp with cumulative training load. Ten male recreational triathletes involved in a training camp underwent measurements of perception of pain and fatigue (visual analogue scale), skin temperature (infrared thermography), and jump performance (counter movement jump test) before, one day, and two days after the beginning of the training camp. All measurements were performed before the breakfast. Jump height did not differ between the days (p > 0.05). Fatigue perception increased after the first and second day of training for most of the body regions (p < 0.05). Pain perception increased after two days of training (p < 0.05). Mean and maximum skin temperature increased after the second day of training for most of the body regions (p < 0.05). Skin temperature in some body regions was directly related with muscle mass, weekly training volume, and inverse related with fatigue perception (p < 0.05 and R-2 > 0.4). Possible explanations of these results in comparison with previous studies may include the influence of control of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors related to the skin temperature assessment (for instance, the time of the day, lack of muscle soreness, daily activity control). These preliminary results have important implication on the use of skin basal temperature data to monitor exercise recovery, which claims for further research.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.035,84,NA,431-438,NA,Infrared thermography; Triathlon; Cycling; Swimming; Exercise; Recovery
article,"Interactive effects of experimental heating rates, ontogeny and body mass on the upper thermal limits of anuran larvae","Agudelo-Cantero, Gustavo A. and Navas, Carlos A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Biological and methodological factors influence the upper thermal limits (UTL) of ectothermic animals, but most factors have been studied independently. Few studies have integrated variables, so our understanding about sources of UTL variation remains fragmentary. Thereby, we investigated synergic effects of experimental protocols (heating rates, Delta Ts) and biological factors (ontogeny and body mass) on the UTL on the larvae of two anuran species (Physalaemus nattereri and Boana pardalis), specifically their Critical Thermal Maximum (CTmax). The species displayed slightly different responses to Delta Ts: In B. pardalis tadpoles both average and variance of CTmax increased at a fastest Delta T, the same response happened in P. nattereri tadpoles at slow and moderate Delta Ts. Also, the CTmax of P. nattereri declined at the end of metamorphosis independently of Delta T, but tadpoles at all developmental stages still displayed higher heat tolerance at the slow Delta T. Finally, we detected small, synergic effects of body mass and Delta Ts on the CTmax of both species. In small B. pardalis tadpoles and premetamorphic P. nattereri tadpoles, body mass had a positive effect on CTmax but only at slow and moderate Delta Ts, probably indicating physiological responses. A similar trend was observed in large B. pardalis tadpoles at the fast Delta T, but this result is likely to be influenced by thermal inertia. Our findings contribute to integrate the understanding of factors influencing UTL in small ectothermic animals. This understanding is critical to discuss the physiological component of vulnerability to climate change that is related to acute temperatures.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.03.010,82,NA,43-51,NA,Critical thermal maximum (CTmax); Warming tolerance (WT); Inter-individual variation; Small ectothermic animals; Thermal inertia

Clustering has significant physiological and ecological benefits, promoting successful hibernation of individuals. Such aggregations may help maintain optimal temperatures, allowing better energy utilisation than in solitarily bats. However, aroused bats in a cluster could conceivably disturb those still hibernating, starting an energy-demanding arousal process. Our study was conducted over two winters in two different hibernacula (cave and mine) in the Czech Republic, where Greater mouse-eared bats (Myotis myotis) have previously been diagnosed with white-nose syndrome. In 118 arousal episodes we recorded 193 individual arousals in which a warming phase was observed, 135 (69.9\%) being cold arousals, where bats ceased increasing their body temperatures at <= 10 degrees C. The remaining arousals were standard normothermic arousals, where body (fur) surface temperatures reached > 20 degrees C. Cold arousals occurred during the mid- and late hibernation periods, suggesting they were a response to disturbance by a neighbour in the same cluster. Arousal cascades, where bats aroused in series, were rare (12.7\%) and reached a maximum in mid-January. Our data suggest that Myotis bats prolong their torpor bouts using numerous cold arousals but few arousal cascades.

article,Low cold tolerance of the invasive lizard <i>Eutropis multifasciata</i> constrains its potential elevation distribution in Taiwan,"Lin, Te-En and Chen, Tai-Yu and Wei, Hsin-Lin and Richard, Romain and Huang, Shu-Ping",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"1. The invasive many-lined sun skink, Eutropis multifasciata, is established in much of southern Taiwan and is spreading northward. We investigated whether winter temperatures constrain further dispersion of this skink by comparing its cold tolerance to the spatial distribution of winter temperatures in Taiwan. 2. We measured the 28-day survival rate of this species at 4 constant temperatures (10-16 degrees C in 2 degrees C increments) and its critical thermal minimum (CTmin), i.e., the body temperature at which the righting reflex is lost during the cooling process. For comparison with the spatial distribution of temperatures over Taiwan, we used the biophysical model Niche Mapper (TM) in order to simulate the soil temperatures, where lizards are inactive in the winter, during the coldest month of the year, January, under three climatic scenarios (average temperature, average -3 degrees C, average +3 degrees C). 3. Our results indicate that this species has low tolerance to cold. Combining cold tolerance data with soil temperature data suggests that its upper elevation limit could range from 1000 m to 1500 m, above which the weather is lethal and precludes overwintering. The locations of sightings of E. multifasciata are consistent with this prediction, with no known locations above 500 m elevation. 4. This study highlights that the winter climate is a major factor in determining population establishment and hence in limiting this species' range.

article,Reliability of a wearable sweat rate monitor and routine sweat analysis techniques under heat stress in females,"Relf, Rebecca and Willmott, Ashley and Flint, Melanie S. and Beale, Louisa and Maxwell, Neil",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Introduction: The aim of the study was to evaluate the reliability of five different sweat analysis techniques which measure; whole body sweat rate {[}WBSR], local sweat rate {[}LSR] (via technical absorbent {[}TA] method and KuduSmart monitor), sweat conductivity {[}SC] and sweat gland activation {[}SGA] in a female population when exercising moderately under heat stress. Methods: Fourteen females (age; 26 +/- 7 years, body mass; 66.5 +/- 7.6 kg, height; 167.1 +/- 6.4 cm) completed a preliminary threshold walking test (to determine exercise intensity) and two main trials, separated by 2 days. Main trials consisted of 30-min seated rest in the environmental chamber (35 degrees C, 50\% relative humidity) in an upper body sauna-suit, before its removal, and walking at a moderate intensity (4 metabolic equivalents) for 30 min (speeds ranged from 4.8 to 6.5 km h(-1)). WBSR was measured via nude mass pre and post exercise. The TA and Tegaderm patches (for sweat sodium chloride) were placed on the back, forearm and chest for the entire 60 min, replicated for all participants for both trials. SGA was assessed following the 60-min trial and the KuduSmarta monitor was placed on the left arm for the 30-min of exercise. Results: WBSR, LSR methods and SC demonstrated no difference between trials (p > 0.05), good agreement (within limits), strong correlations (r >= 0.88) and low typical error of measurements {[}TEM] ( < 0.04 L min(-1), 0.13 mg min(-1) cm(-2) and 8 mmol L-1, respectively). SGA method showed moderate intra-class correlation (r = 0.80), with high TEM (5 glands) and large limits of agreement. Conclusion: Sudomotor function is reliable, as demonstrated by good reliability, small TEM and strong correlations. The use of these sweat techniques is appropriate and practical in females who are exercising at moderate intensity under heat stress, and so, may aid future interventions. SGA shows larger variation and should be used with caution.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.12.019,79,NA,209-217,NA,Sweat analysis; Heat stress; Exercise; Reliability; Females
article,Numerical investigation of the effect of vessel size and distance on the cryosurgery of an adjacent tumor,"Nabaei, Malikeh and Karimi, Mehrdad",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Cryosurgery is an efficient cancer treatment which can be used for non-invasive ablation of some internal tumors such as liver and prostate. Tumors are usually located near the large blood vessels and the heat convection may affect the progression of the ice ball. Hence it is necessary to predict the surgery procedure and its consequences earlier. In spite of the recent studies it is still unclear that which arteries will significantly affect the freezing treatment of tumors and which can be ignored. Therefore a numerical model of a spherical 3 cm diameter liver tumor, subjected to cryosurgery was developed. The specific thermophysical properties were applied to the tumor and healthy tissues in frozen and unfrozen states. A simplified Hepatic artery with different anatomical diameters was placed in different positions relative to the tumor and energy and momentum equations were solved. The temperature distribution and the shape of the resultant ice ball were discussed. The results showed that a 4 mm diameter artery in the vicinity of a tumor will increase the minimum temperature achieved at the tumor boundary by 12.5 degrees C and therefore significantly affects the cryosurgery outcome. This may cause insufficient freezing which leads to incomplete death of tumor cells, failure of the surgery and tumor regenesis. Eventually it was shown that injection of gold and Fe3O4 nanoparticles to the surrounding tissue of the artery can enhance the heat transfer and progression of the ice ball, making temperature distribution similar to the no vessel state. Development of computational models can provide the physicians an applicable tool which helps them recognize how efficient a treatment method will be for a specific case and design a suitable cryosurgery plan.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.08.001,77,NA,45-54,NA,Cryosurgery; Numerical model; Vascular network; Liver tumor; Nanoparticles
article,"It's about time: Linkages between heat tolerance, thermal acclimation and metabolic rate at different temporal scales in the freshwater amphipod <i>Gammarus fossarum</i> Koch, 1836","Semsar-kazerouni, Maryam and Verberk, Wilco C. E. P.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature has a profound impact on ectotherms. Warming increases the metabolic oxygen demand of ectotherms, which could result in a mismatch between their oxygen demand and their ability to extract and deliver sufficient oxygen to meet demand. This hypothesis has been mainly tested using short-term exposure to intense thermal stress. However, the thermal responses of organisms can be different on longer timescales, where physiological acclimation becomes increasingly important. Such thermal acclimation effects may reduce the vulnerability of ectotherms to warming on the long term. Thus, responses to intense, short-term thermal stress may be different from responses to moderate, prolonged thermal stress. Here, we examine the effect of thermal acclimation on heat tolerance and metabolism in the aquatic ectotherm Gammarus fossarum (Koch, 1836). Amphipods were acclimated to either 11.1 +/- 0.1 degrees C or 19.8 +/- 0.1 degrees C and after thermal acclimation we measured both their metabolism and their survival time at different temperatures. Our results show that metabolism strongly increased with increasing temperatures in the cold-acclimated group, but less so in the warm-acclimated group. Cold-acclimated amphipods were also more sensitive to thermal stress, especially during prolonged exposure. Thus, the differences between both thermal acclimation groups support the idea of oxygen-limited heat tolerance: cold-acclimated amphipods showed increased oxygen consumption and decreased thermal tolerance. However, across individuals, those that sharply increased oxygen consumption with increasing temperature did not differ in heat tolerance from individuals whose metabolism was much less sensitive to temperature. Thus, acclimation to different temperatures appeared to be beneficial, but a role for oxygen limitation could not be demonstrated unambiguously. Beneficial effect of acclimation were much larger during prolonged exposure, with the acclimation response ratio (ARR) ranging from 0.03 to over 0.5 depending on the time scale (minutes to months). Thus, the acclimatory capacity may have been underestimated by short-term experimental studies.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.04.016,75,NA,31-37,NA,Ectotherms; Gammarus fossarum; Thermal sensitivity; Acclimation; Metabolic rate
article,"Thermoconformity strategy in the freshwater turtle <i>Hydromedusa tectifera</i> (<i>Testudines</i>, <i>Chelidae</i>) in its southern distribution area","Molina, Francisco J. and Leynaud, Gerardo C.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Ectotherm species are not capable of generating metabolic heat; therefore, they present different strategies for regulating their body temperatures, ranging from a precise degree of thermoregulation to a passive thermoconformity with ambient temperatures. In reptiles, aerial basking is the most common mechanism for gaining heat. However, among aquatic reptiles, such as freshwater turtles, aquatic basking is also frequent. Hydromedusa tectifera is a turtle of exclusively aquatic and nocturnal habits widely distributed in South America. We studied the relationship between body temperature (Tb) of H. tectifera and its habitat, and explored the effects of sex, life stage and body size and mass on Tb. Fieldwork was conducted in two streams of a mountain area of central Argentina. We recorded cloacal temperature, size and mass of 84 turtles. We also determined individuals' sex and life stage (adult/juvenile). Regarding ambient temperatures, we measured water temperature on the surface (Tsurf) and at depth of turtle capture (Tdepth) and air temperature. Mean Tb was 18.58 degrees C (Min = 10.20 degrees C; Max = 25.70 degrees C). Tsurf and Tdepth were highly correlated. Multi-model analysis using Akaike criterion indicated that Tb was strongly associated with water temperature, whereas air temperature and body size and mass did not show a significant effect. There was also no effect of turtle sex or life stage on Tb. Our results indicate that H. tectifera is a thermoconformer and eurythermal species. A nocturnal pattern of activity and a fully aquatic lifestyle are suggested as determinant factors.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.07.008,69,NA,178-183,NA,Thermoregulation; Body temperature; Freshwater turtles; Chaco region; Argentina
article,The particularities of a remote islet shape the thermoregulatory profile of an endemic Mediterranean lizard,"Pafilis, Panayiotis and Lymberakis, Petros and Sagonas, Kostas and Valakos, Efstratios",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Environmental temperatures considerably affect the reptilian ability for thermoregulation and harsh climatic conditions may impose a highly effective body temperature regulation to lizards. Such demanding conditions are more common to extreme mainland habitats (e.g. deserts or mountains). To the contrary, islands have more benign climate conditions thanks to the thermal buffering effect of the surrounding sea. However, this favorable effect may be eliminated in small size islets where the scarcity of thermal shelters and exposure to high winds create challenging conditions. Here we investigate the impact of a tough islet habitat on the thermoregulation of Podarcis levendis, a lacertid lizard endemic to two rocky islets in the north Cretan Sea, Greece. To evaluate the thermoregulatory effectiveness of P. levendis we measured operative and body temperatures in the field and the preferred body temperatures in the lab. Analyses of the thermal data revealed an accurate, precise, and effective thermoregulator, achieving very high thermoregulation values (E =0.91, (d) over bar (e) - (d) over bar (b) =7.6). This high effectiveness comes to compensate living in an inhospitable habitat as the operative temperatures denote (d(e) =7.79). Our findings, together with the limited published literature, suggested the lack of a general pattern for all insular lizards and indicated a possible deviation for islet habitats.

article,Seasonal metabolic acclimatization in the herbivorous desert lizard <i>Uromastyx philbyi</i> (Reptilia: Agamidea) from western Saudi Arabia,"Zari, Talal A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Many ectotherms adjust their metabolic rate seasonally in association with variations in environmental temperatures. The range and direction of these seasonal changes in reptilian metabolic rates are thought to be linked to the seasonality of activity and energy requirements. The present study was conducted to measure the standard metabolic rate (SMR) of seasonally-acclimatized Uromastyx philbyi with different body masses at 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 degrees C using open-flow respirometry during the four seasons. SMR was mass-dependent. The mean exponent of mass, ``b{''}, in the metabolism-body mass relation was 0.76 (variance=0.0007). Likewise, SMR increased as temperature increased with low Q(10) values at high temperatures and high Q(10) values at low temperatures. The lowest and highest Q(10) values were achieved for temperature ranges of 30-35 degrees C for summer-acclimatized dhabbs (Q(10)=1.6) and 20-25 degrees C for winter acclimatized dhabbs (Q(10)=3.9). Seasonal acclimatization effects were obvious at all temperatures (20-40 degrees C). Winter-acclimatized dhabbs had the lowest metabolic rates at all temperatures. The seasonal acclimatization patterns displayed by U. philbyi may represent a valuable adaptation for herbivorous desert lizards that inhabit subtropical deserts to facilitate activity during their active seasons and to conserve energy during inactivity at low temperatures.

Ambient temperature has a profound effect on this balance, with species inhabiting colder climates often needing to invest more energy in thermoregulation to maintain body temperature. This leads to local behavioral and physiological adaptations that increase energetic efficiency. In this study, we investigated the role of activity, behavior and thermogenic capacity in the ability of the greater white-toothed shrew, Crocidura russula, to cope with seasonal changes. Individuals were captured in the Sintra-Cascais Natural Park, a Mediterranean region, and separated into three experimental groups: a control group, acclimated to a 12L:12D photoperiod and temperature of 18-20 degrees C; a winter group, acclimatized to natural winter fluctuations of light and temperature; and a summer group, acclimatized to natural summer fluctuations of light and temperature. No differences were found in resting metabolic rate and nonshivering thermogenesis between the three groups. However, winter shrews significantly reduced their activity, particularly at night, compared to the control and summer groups. Differences in torpor use were also found between groups, with winter shrews entering torpor more frequently and during shorter periods of time than summer and control shrews. Our results indicate C russula from Sintra relies on the flexibility of energy saving mechanisms, namely daily activity level and torpor use, to cope with seasonal changes in a Mediterranean climate, rather than mechanisms involving body heat production.

Y.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"This study aimed to investigate temperature effect on physiological and biochemical responses of the marine medaka Oryzias melastigma larvae. The fish were subjected to a stepwise temperature change at a rate of 1 degrees C/h increasing or decreasing from 25 degrees C (the control) to six target temperatures (12, 13, 15, 20, 28 and 32 degrees C) respectively, followed by a 7-day thermal acclimation at each target temperature. The fish were fed ad libitum during the experiment. The results showed that cumulative mortalities were significantly increased at low temperatures (12 and 13 degrees C) and at the highest temperature (32 degrees C). For the survivors, their growth profile closely followed the left-skewed `thermal performance curve'. Routine oxygen consumption rates of fish larvae were significantly elevated at 32 degrees C but suppressed at 13 and 15 degrees C (due to a high mortality, larvae from 12 degrees C were not examined). Levels of heat shock proteins and activities of malate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase were also measured in fish larvae exposed at 15, 25 and 32 degrees C. The activities of both enzymes were significantly increased at both 15 and 32 degrees C, where the fish larvae probably suffered from thermal discomfort and increased anaerobic components so as to compensate the mismatch of energy demand and supply at these thermal extremes. Coincidently, heat shock proteins were also up-regulated at both 15 and 32 degrees C, enabling cellular protection. Moreover, the critical thermal maxima and minima of fish larvae increased significantly with increasing acclimation temperature, implying that the fish could develop some degrees of thermal tolerance through temperature acclimation.

article,"Temperature-dependent development in <i>Chrysomela vigintipunctata</i> (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), a stenothermal early-season breeder","Kutcherov, Dmitry",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Chrysomela vigintipunctata (Scopoli) is a univoltine leaf beetle commonly encountered on willows across the Palearctic forest zone. The preimaginal development in this species takes place during a short time period, from May to June, because larvae are unable to consume mature leaves of the host plant. Therefore, the diet quality imposes a time constraint, and it was expected that the temperature dependence of development in C vigintipunctata should be adaptively adjusted to the shortness and cool conditions of the favorable season. It was experimentally determined that this leaf beetle was stenothermal at the larval stage, required 275.5 degree-days above the threshold of 9.0 degrees C for total development from oviposition to adult emergence, and attained greater body mass at lower temperatures. However, in all of these aspects, the thermal ecology of C vigintipunctata was similar to that of two related multivoltine species, C. populi and C. scripta. The interspecific similarity of thermal reaction norms for development rate and body size suggests that these reaction norms in C. vigintipunctata were unlikely to have been shaped by selection favoring faster development or growth early in the season. The results are discussed in terms of the ``ecological fitting{''} concept, which states that a species may be successful in exploiting novel environments while retaining ecophysiological traits evolved elsewhere.

There was no seasonal difference in body mass between consecutive seasons. The lower critical limit of thermoneutrality was lower in winter (23 degrees C) than in summer (28 degrees C), as expected for a small Afrotropical bird, In the first year of the study, mean whole animal basal metabolic rate (BMR) of Cape White-eyes was significantly lower in winter than in summer, while in the second year of the study this trend was reversed, and in the middle two seasons there was no significant difference in BMR.

The present study was conducted to identify major types of genes under the HSP70 family and other HSPs and to evaluate their expression pattern in Sahiwal and Tharparkar breeds of zebu cattle (Bos indicus) and Murrah buffalo (Bubalus bubails) with respect to different seasons. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction was performed to analyze the transcript variants of three HSP70 family genes (HSPA1A, HSPA1B, and HSPA8) and HSP10, HSP60,HSP90 and HSF1 in each breed. The major finding of this study was the higher abundance of all the studied HSP genes during summer and winter compared to spring season, but the magnitude of increase was higher during summer as compared to winter. HSPA1A and HSPA1B genes showed maximal induction (P < 0.001) during summer and winter while HSP60 and HSP10 were found to be the second most abundantly expressed HSPs. The relative mRNA abundance of HSF1 significantly increased (P < 0.001) in Murrah buffalo compared to Tharparkar and Sahiwal cattle during summer and winter. Expression pattern of heat shock protein genes indicated that amongst the breeds, the expression was higher in Murrah buffalo compared to Sahiwal and Tharparkar cattle, thereby indicating the more adaptive capacity of later during periods of stress. Hence, this study suggests that heat shock protein genes may be conveniently used as biomarkers for assessing stress response in cattle and buffalo and the expression is species and breed-specific. Furthermore, the variation in expression is associated with heat tolerance and adaptation to different climatic conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

After 60 days, various tests were conducted on the testicular tissue, sperm quality, oxidative status, gene activity, and in vivo fertility indexes to evaluate the effects of the treatments. Treatment with 0)6 and 0)3 could reduce abnormal morphology and DNA damage while increasing total and progressive motility, characteristics motility, viability, and plasma membrane functional impairment compared with HSexposed groups.

These groups included a negative control (Control) with broilers raised at a normal temperature (24 degrees C) on a basal diet, and positive control groups (S-LAB and L-LAB) with broilers under normal temperature receiving a lactic acid bacteria supplement (0.5 mL/L) from rye-grass in their drinking water. The heat stress group (HS) comprised broilers exposed to cyclic heat stress (5-7 h per day at 34-36 degrees C) on a basal diet, while the heat stress and probiotic groups (S-LAB/HS and L-LAB/HS) consisted of broilers under heat stress supplemented with the rye-grass-derived lactic acid bacteria. Results indicated that heat stress without supplementation (HS) led to reduced body weight gain, T3 levels, citrulline, and growth hormone levels, along with an increased feed conversion ratio, serum corticosterone, HSP70, ALT, AST, and leptin levels. Heat stress also negatively impacted cecal microbiota, decreasing lactic acid bacteria (LABC) while increasing E. coli and coliform bacteria (CBC) counts. Probiotic supplements (S-LAB/HS and L-LAB/HS) mitigated these effects by enhancing broilers' resilience to heat stress. In conclusion, rye grass-derived S-LAB and L-LAB probiotics can effectively support broiler chickens under heat stress, promoting growth, liver function, hormonal balance, gut health, and cecal microbiome ecology. These benefits are likely mediated through improved gut health.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103771,119,NA,NA,103771,Heat stress; Probiotics; Leptin; Ghrelin; Cecal ecology; Broilers
article,Terrestrial amphibians respond to rapidly changing temperatures with individual plasticity of exploratory behaviour,"Hubacek, Jiri and Gvozdik, Lumir",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Terrestrial ectotherms react to acute changes in environmental temperatures by adjusting their behaviour. Evaluating the adaptive potential of these behavioural adjustments requires information on their repeatability and plasticity. We examined behavioural response (exploration) to acute temperature change in two amphibian taxa, alpine (Ichthyosaura alpestris) and smooth (Lissotriton vulgaris) newts. These responses were investigated at both population and individual levels under multiple thermal contexts (dimensions), represented by the direction and range of changing temperature and rearing thermal regimes. Population-level analyses showed speciesspecific, non-additive effects of direction and range of temperature change on acute thermal reaction norms for exploration, but explained only a low amount (7-23\%) of total variation in exploration. In contrast, withinand among-individual variation in acute thermal reaction norm parameters explained 42-50\% of total variation in the examined trait. Although immediate thermal responses varied among individuals (repeatability = 0.07 to 0.53), they were largely shaped by environmental contexts during repeated trials. We conclude that these amphibians respond to acute temperature change through individual plasticity of behavioural traits. A repeatedmeasures approach under multiple thermal contexts will be needed to identify the selective and plastic potential of behavioural responses used by juvenile newts and perhaps other ectotherm taxa to cope with rapidly changing environmental temperatures.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103757,119,NA,NA,103757,Behavioural plasticity; Environmental change; Personality; Repeatability; Thermal performance curve

Ten Dorper rams were individually housed and exposed to thermoneutrality for 35 d in spring (23.6 +/- 5.6 degrees C, mean +/- SD) and outdoor heat stress (HS) for 35 d in summer (33.6 +/- 2.0 degrees C) to evaluate the effect of seasonal HS on physiological responses, testicular biometry, and seminal quality under desert climatic conditions. Rectal temperature, respiration rate and coat surface temperatures in different body regions were measured every 7 d (0600, 1200, and 1800 h); also, testicular biometry was registered at 0600 h. Semen was collected via an artificial vagina 3 d after physiological variables were measured and seminal traits were evaluated. Rectal temperature, respiration rate and coat surface temperatures were higher (P < 0.01) at each hour of measurement in summer compared to spring. Overall, scrotal length and circumference, as well as testicular volume were higher (P < 0.01) in summer than in spring. Compared to spring conditions, summer HS caused lower (P <= 0.05) sperm concentration and viability combined with a higher percentage of sperm abnormalities without affecting ejaculate volume. Both mass and sperm motility were similar between seasons in the first two sampling weeks, and then decreased (P <= 0.03) due to summer HS. In conclusion, Dorper rams developed testicle hyperthermia and, consequently, showed poor semen quality due to the high environmental temperatures prevailing in desert regions.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103737,118,NA,NA,103737,Fertility; Hair sheep; Sperm abnormalities; Testicular heat stress; Spermatogenesis
article,Numerical simulation of burn injuries with temperature-dependent thermal conductivity and metabolism under different surface heat sources,"Ansari, Faishal and Chaudhary, Rajneesh Kumar and Singh, Jitendra",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In the present paper, the phenomena of heat transport inside human forearm tissue are studied through a onedimensional nonlinear bioheat transfer model under the influence of various boundary and interface conditions. In this study, we considered temperature-dependent thermal conductivity and metabolic heat to predict temperature distribution inside the forearm tissue. We have studied the temperature distribution inside inner tissue and bone because it has been found that burn injuries are mostly affected by layer thickness. The temperature distribution inside human forearm tissue is analyzed using the finite difference and bvp4c numerical techniques. To examine the accuracy of present numerical code, we compare the obtained numerical result with the exact analytical result in a specific case and find an excellent agreement with the exact results. We also validated our present numerical code with a hybrid scheme based on Runge-Kutta (4,5) and finite difference technique and found it in good compliance. From the obtained results, we observed that the homogeneous heat flux has a greater impact on the temperature at the outer surface of the skin, but the sinusoidal heat flux has a greater impact on the temperature of the subcutaneous layer and inner tissue. It is found that there is no burn injury in the first type of heat source (Tw = 44 degrees C), but it may occur in the second and third types of heat sources. It has been observed that by raising the blood perfusion rate and reducing the values of reference metabolic heat, coefficient of thermal conductivity, and heat fluxes, we can manage and reduce burn injuries and achieve hyperthermia temperature.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103656,116,NA,NA,103656,Multi-layer forearm tissue; Temperature-dependent thermal conductivity; and body metabolism; Finite difference and bvp4c method; Interface condition
article,Thermal dependence of<i> Daphnia</i> life history reveals asymmetries between key vital rates,"Richard, Romain and Zhang, Yi-Kuan and Hung, Kuan-Wei",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature variation affects virtually every aspect of ectotherms' ecological performance, such as their foraging rate, reproduction, and survival. Although these changes influence what happens at higher levels of organizations, such as populations and communities, qualitative changes in dynamics usually require some degree of asymmetry between key vital rates, i.e. that different vital rates, such as growth, development, fecundity and mortality rates, respond differently to temperature. In order to identify possible asymmetries among vital rates and/or life stages, we characterized the thermal response of individuals a clone of Daphnia sinensis, drawn from a high-mountain environment in Taiwan, and examined the temperature dependence of growth, maturation, reproduction, and mortality rates, as well as fitness measures (r and R0) at eight temper-atures. Daphnia sinensis was able to maintain reproductive success over a broad range of temperatures, much wider than the one experienced in its environment. However, negative effects of temperature were perceptible at temperatures much lower than the highest one at which they can achieve reproductive success. Adult mortality greatly increased for temperatures above 23 degrees C, and other vital rates started to decelerate, resulting in a large drop in lifetime reproductive success. This finding implies that D. sinensis may be able to persist over a wide range of temperatures, but also that it may become more sensitive to the detrimental effect of species interactions at increased temperatures. Different vital rates responded relatively similarly at low temperatures, but the degree of asymmetry among these rates was much more pronounced at higher temperatures. In particular, rates associated with adult performance decelerated more strongly than juveniles' rates. These findings indicate that elevated temperatures affect the balance between juvenile and adult performance, which is known to have a crucial role in Daphnia population dynamics. We discuss the implications of these results for the dynamics of structured populations.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103653,115,NA,NA,103653,Individual energetics; Population dynamics; Thermal performance curve; Growth; Fecundity; Mortality
article,Temperature variability and metabolic adaptation in terrestrial and aquatic ectotherms,"Carter, Mauricio J. and Cortes, Pablo A. and Rezende, Enrico L.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Thermodynamics is a major factor determining rates of energy expenditure, rates of biochemical dynamics, and ultimately the biological and ecological processes linked with resilience to global warming in ectothermic organisms. Nonetheless, whether ectothermic organisms exhibit general adaptive metabolic responses to cope with worldwide variation in thermal conditions has remained as an open question. Here we combine a model comparison approach with a global dataset of standard metabolic rates (SMR), including 1,160 measurements across 788 species of aquatic invertebrates, insects, fishes, amphibians and reptiles, to investigate the association between metabolic rates and environmental temperatures in their respective habitats. Our analyses suggest that variation in SMR after removing allometric and thermodynamic effects is best explained by the temperature range encountered across seasons, which always provided a better fit than the average temperature for the hottest and coldest month and mean annual temperatures. This pattern was consistent across taxonomic groups and robust to sensitivity analyses. Nonetheless, aquatic and terrestrial lineages responded differently to seasonality, with SMR declining - 6.8\% degrees C- 1 of thermal range across seasons in aquatic organisms and increasing 2.8\% degrees C- 1 in terrestrial organisms. These responses may reflect alternative strategies to mitigate the impact of increments in warmer temperatures on energy expenditure, either by means of metabolic reduction in thermally homogeneous water bodies or effective behavioral thermoregulation to exploit temperature heterogeneity on land.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103565,115,NA,NA,103565,Global distribution; Metabolic rates; Temperature variability; Thermal adaptation; Thermodynamics
article,Can infrared thermography serve as an alternative to assess cumulative fatigue in women?,"Machado, Alvaro Sosa and da Silva, Willian and Priego-Quesada, Jose Ignacio and Carpes, Felipe P.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Muscle fatigue can limit performance both in sports and daily life activities. Consecutive days of exercise without a proper recovery time may elicit cumulative fatigue. Although it has been speculated that skin temperature could serve as an indirect indicator of exercise-induced adaptations, it is unclear if skin temperature measured by infrared thermography (IRT) could be an outcome related to the effects of cumulative fatigue. In this study, we recruited 21 untrained women and induced cumulative fatigue in biceps brachii over two consecutive days of exercise. We measured delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS, using a numeric rate scale), maximal strength (using a dynamometer), and skin temperature (using IRT) in exercise and non-exercise muscles. Cumulative fatigue reduced muscle strength and increased DOMS. Skin temperature in the arm submitted to cumulative fatigue was higher for minimum and mean temperature, being asymmetrical in relation to the control arm. We also observed that the variations in the minimum and mean temperatures correlated with the strength losses. In summary, skin temperature measured by IRT seems promising to help detect cumulative fatigue in untrained women, being useful to explain strength losses. Future studies should provide additional evidence for the potential applications not only in trained participants but also in patients that may not be able to report outcomes of scales or precisely report DOMS.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103612,115,NA,NA,103612,Exercise recovery; Muscle damage; Muscle fatigue; Skin temperature
article,The hyperthermic response to intra-preoptic area administration of agmatine in male rats,"Xu, Jianhui and Gao, Wenmin and He, Tianhui and Yao, Lan and Wu, Hanghong and Chen, Zhenwei and Lai, Yupei and Chen, Yajun and Zhang, Jie",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Agmatine is an endogenous biogenic amine that exerts various effects on the central nervous system. The hy-pothalamic preoptic area (POA, thermoregulatory command center) has high agmatine immunoreactivity. In this study, in conscious and anesthetized male rats, agmatine microinjection into the POA induced hyperthermic responses associated with increased heat production and locomotor activity. Intra-POA administration of agmatine increased the locomotor activity, the brown adipose tissue temperature and rectum temperature, and induced shivering as demonstrated by increased neck muscle electromyographic activity. However, intra-POA administration of agmatine almost had no impact on the tail temperature of anesthetized rats. Furthermore, there were regional differences in the response to agmatine in the POA. The most effective sites for the microinjection of agmatine to elicit hyperthermic responses were localized in the medial preoptic area (MPA). Agmatine microinjection into the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) and lateral preoptic nucleus (LPO) had a minimal effect on the mean core temperature. Analysis of the in vitro discharge activity of POA neurons in brain slices when perfused with agmatine showed that agmatine inhibited most warm-sensitive but not temperature-insensitive neurons in the MPA. However, regardless of thermosensitivity, the majority of MnPO and LPO neurons were not responsive to agmatine. The results demonstrated that agmatine injection into the POA of male rats, espe-cially the MPA, induced hyperthermic responses, which may be associated with increased BAT thermogenesis, shivering and locomotor activity by inhibiting warm-sensitive neurons.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103529,113,NA,NA,103529,Agmatine; Hyperthermia; Preoptic area; Discharge activity; Warm-sensitive neuron
article,An explorative study of inflammation-related proteins associated with kidney injury in male heat-stressed workers,"Hansson, Erik and Broberg, Karin and Wijkstrom, Julia and Glaser, Jason and Gonzalez-Quiroz, Marvin and Ekstrom, Ulf and Abrahamson, Magnus and Jakobsson, Kristina",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Chronic kidney disease of non-traditional origin (CKDnt) and acute kidney injury (AKI) often affect heat-stressed Mesoamerican manual workers. Inflammation occurs concurrently with AKI in this population, but its role remains unknown. To explore links between inflammation and kidney injury in heat stress, we compared levels of inflammation-related proteins in cutters with and without increasing serum creatinine levels during sugarcane harvest. These sugarcane cutters have previously been identified to be repeatedly exposed to severe heat stress during the five month harvest season. A nested case-control study was conducted among male Nicaraguan sugarcane cutters in a CKDnt hotspot. Cases (n = 30) were defined as having an increase in creatinine of >= 0.3 mg/dL across the five-month harvest. Controls (n = 57) had stable creatinine levels. Ninety-two inflammation-related proteins in serum were measured before and after harvest using Proximity Extension Assays. Mixed linear regression was used to identify differences in protein concentrations between cases and controls before harvest, differential trends during harvest, and association between protein concentrations and the urine kidney injury markers Kidney Injury Molecule (KIM)-1, Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein (MCP)-1 and albumin. One protein, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 23 (CCL23), was elevated among cases at pre-harvest. Changes in seven inflammation-related proteins (CCL19, CCL23, colony-stimulating factor 1 {[}CSF1], hepatocyte and fibroblast growth factors {[}HGF and FGF23], and tumor necrosis factor beta {[}TNFB] and TNF-related activation -induced cytokine {[}TRANCE]) were associated with case status and at least two out of three urine kidney injury markers (KIM-1, MCP-1 and albumin). Several of these have been implicated in myofibroblast activation, which likely is an important step in kidney interstitial fibrotic disease such as CKDnt. This study provides an initial exploration of immune system determinants of, and activation during, kidney injury experienced during prolonged heat stress.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103433,112,NA,NA,103433,NA

This is especially apparent in small endotherms that exhibit high mass-specific metabolic rates and live in unpredictable environments. Many of these animals use torpor, sub-stantially reducing their metabolic rate and often body temperature to cope with high energetic demands during non-foraging periods. In birds, when the incubating parent uses torpor, the lowered temperatures that thermally sensitive offspring experience could delay development or increase mortality risk. We used thermal imaging to noninvasively explore how nesting female hummingbirds sustain their own energy balance while effectively incubating their eggs and brooding their chicks. We located 67 active Allen's hummingbird (Selasphorus sasin) nests in Los Angeles, California and recorded nightly time-lapse thermal images at 14 of these nests for 108 nights using thermal cameras. We found that nesting females usually avoided entering torpor, with one bird entering deep torpor on two nights (2\% of nights), and two other birds possibly using shallow torpor on three nights (3\% of nights). We also modeled nightly energetic requirements of a bird experiencing nest temperatures vs. ambient temperature and using torpor or remaining normothermic, using data from similarly-sized broad-billed hum-mingbirds. Overall, we suggest that the warm environment of the nest, and possibly shallow torpor, help brooding female hummingbirds reduce their own energy requirements while prioritizing the energetic demands of their offspring.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103391,112,NA,NA,103391,Hummingbirds; Torpor; Thermal imaging; Nesting; Reproduction; Energy -modeling
article,<i>Cataglyphis</i> desert ants use distinct behavioral and physiological adaptations to cope with extreme thermal conditions,"Perez, Remy and Benbachir, Mohammed and Decroo, Corentin and Mascolo, Cyril and Wattiez, Ruddy and Aron, Serge",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Some ant species live in hot and arid environments, such as deserts and savannas. Worker poly-morphism-variation in worker size and/or morphology within colonies-is adaptive in such ecosystems because it enhances resistance to heat stress and increases the efficiency of resource exploitation. However, species with small, monomorphic workers are also frequently found in these environments. How species with distinct worker size and degrees of polymorphism deal with such stressful environments remains poorly studied.We investigated the behavioral, physiological, and molecular adaptations that may enhance heat and desic-cation tolerance in two sympatric species of Cataglyphis desert ants that differ dramatically in worker size and polymorphism: C. viatica is polymorphic, while C. cubica is small and monomorphic.We found that worker size, water content, water loss, and protein regulation play a key role in thermal resistance. (i) Large C. viatica workers better tolerated heat and desiccation stress than did small C. viatica or C. cubica workers. The former had greater water content and lost proportionally less water to evaporation under thermal stress. (ii) Despite their similar size distribution, workers of C. cubica are more heat tolerant than small C. viatica. This higher degree of tolerance likely stemmed from C. cubica workers having greater relative water content. (iii) Under thermal stress, small C. viatica workers metabolized larger quantities of fat and differentially expressed proteins involved in cellular homeostasis. In contrast, C. cubica downregulated the expression of numerous proteins involved in mitochondrial respiration likely reducing ROS accumulation. (iv) Consistent with these results, large C. viatica workers remained active throughout the day; C. cubica workers displayed a bimodal activity pattern, and small C. viatica remained poorly active outside the nest.Our study shows that ecologically similar ant species with different degrees of worker size polymorphism evolved distinct strategies for coping with extreme heat conditions.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103397,111,NA,NA,103397,Ants; Polymorphism; Thermal tolerance; Desiccation; Proteome; Heat shock response
article,Thermal limits of Africanized honey bees are influenced by temperature ramping rate but not by other experimental conditions,"Gonzalez, Victor H. and Oyen, Kennan and Avila, Omar and Ospina, Rodulfo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Interest in assessing the critical thermal limits of bees is rapidly increasing, as these physiological traits are good predictors of bees' potential responses to extreme temperature changes, which is relevant in the context of global climate change. However, estimates of thermal limits may be influenced by several factors and published studies differ in experimental methods and conditions, such as the rate of temperature change (ramping rate) and feeding status, which might yield inaccurate predictions and limit comparisons across taxa and regions. Using Africanized honey bees as a model organism, we assessed the effect of ramping rate (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 and 1.5 degrees C min-1) and length of starvation (recently fed vs. fasted for 6, 12, and 18 h) on foragers' lower (CTMin) and upper (CTMax) thermal limits, as well as the effect of cold stress on CTMax. In addition, we evaluated the two approaches currently used to assess CTMax with a water bath: floating or submerging the testing vials in the bath. We found that critical thermal limits were influenced by ramping rates but not by the other assessed experi-mental conditions. On average, at ramping rates faster than 0.5 degrees C min-1, bees displayed a CTMin 1.1-2.6 degrees C lower and a CTMax 5.3-6.9 degrees C higher than those of the slowest ramping rate.
