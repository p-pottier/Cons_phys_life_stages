article,Conserving threatened species during rapid environmental change: using biological responses to inform management strategies of giant clams,"Watson, Sue-Ann and Neo, Mei Lin",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Giant clams are threatened by overexploitation for human consumption, their valuable shells and the aquarium trade. Consequently, these iconic coral reef megafauna are extinct in some former areas of their range and are included in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species and Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. Now, giant clams are also threatened by rapid environmental change from both a suite of local and regional scale stressors and global change, including climate change, global warming, marine heatwaves and ocean acidification. The interplay between local- to regional-scale and global-scale drivers is likely to cause an array of lethal and sub-lethal effects on giant clams, potentially limiting their depth distribution on coral reefs and decreasing suitable habitat area within natural ranges of species. Global change stressors, pervasive both in unprotected and protected areas, threaten to diminish conservation efforts to date. International efforts urgently need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to avoid lethal and sub-lethal effects of global change on giant clams. Meanwhile, knowledge of giant clam physiological and ecological responses to local-regional and global stressors could play a critical role in conservation strategies of these threatened species through rapid environmental change. Further work on how biological responses translate into habitat requirements as global change progresses, selective breeding for resilience, the capacity for rapid adaptive responses of the giant clam holobiont and valuing tourism potential, including recognizing giant clams as a flagship species for coral reefs, may help improve the prospects of these charismatic megafauna over the coming decades.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab082,9,NA,NA,coab082,climate change; CO2; ocean acidification; light; Tridacna; Hippopus
article,Measuring the pulse of trees; using the vascular system to predict tree mortality in the 21st century,"Brodribb, Timothy J. and Cochard, Herve and Dominguez, Celia Rodriguez",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Tree mortality during hot and dry conditions presents a stark reminder of the vulnerability of plant species to climatic extremes. The current global warming trend makes predicting the impacts of hot/dry events on species survival an urgent task; yet, the standard tools for this purpose lack a physiological basis. This review examines a diversity of recent evidence demonstrating how physiological attributes of plant vascular systems can explain not only why trees die during drought, but also their distributional limits according to rainfall. These important advances in the science of plant water transport physiology provide the basis for new hydraulic models that can provide credible predictions of not only how but when, where and which species will be impacted by changes in rainfall and temperature in the future. Applying a recently developed hydraulic model using realistic parameters, we show that even apparently safe mesic forest in central France is predicted to experience major forest mortality before the end of the century.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz046,7,NA,NA,coz046,Drought; extinction; hydraulic; tree mortality
article,Zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) behaviour is largely unaffected by elevated pCO<sub>2</sub>,"Vossen, Laura E. and Jutfelt, Fredrik and Cocco, Arianna and Thornqvist, Per-Ove and Winberg, Svante",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Ocean acidification, the decrease in ocean pH caused by anthropogenic emission of carbon dioxide, can cause behavioural disturbances in marine teleost species. We investigated whether AB-strain zebrafish (Danio rerio) show similar behavioural disturbances in the presence of elevated CO2, because this model species could open up a toolbox to investigate the physiological and neurological mechanisms of CO2 exposure. We found no effect of elevated CO2 (similar to 1600 mu atm) on the behaviour of zebrafish in the open field test, indicating that zebrafish are largely insensitive to this elevated CO2 level. In the detour test of lateralization, however, zebrafish exposed to elevated CO2 swam more often to the right, whereas individuals exposed to control CO2 (similar to 400 mu atm) had no preference for left or right. This may indicate that some behaviours of some freshwater fishes can be altered by elevated CO2 levels. Given that elevated CO2 levels often occur in recirculating aquaculture and aquarium systems, we recommend that dissolved CO2 levels are measured and, if necessary, the aquarium water should be aerated, in order to exclude CO2 level as a confounding factor in experiments.",2016,10.1093/conphys/cow065,4,NA,NA,cow065,Behavioural lateralization; detour; gabazine; ocean acidification; open field; zebrafish
article,Respiratory acidosis and O<sub>2</sub> supply capacity do not affect the acute temperature tolerance of rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>),"Montgomery, Daniel W. and Finlay, Jennifer and Simpson, Stephen D. and Engelhard, Georg H. and Birchenough, Silvana N. R. and Wilson, Rod W.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"The mechanisms that determine the temperature tolerances of fish are poorly understood, creating barriers to disentangle how additional environmental challenges-such as CO2-induced aquatic acidification and fluctuating oxygen availability-may exacerbate vulnerability to a warming climate and extreme heat events. Here, we explored whether two acute exposures (similar to 0.5 hours or similar to 72 hours) to increased CO2 impact acute temperature tolerance limits in a freshwater fish, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). We separated the potential effects of acute high CO2 exposure on critical thermal maximum (CTmax), caused via either respiratory acidosis (reduced internal pH) or O-2 supply capacity (aerobic scope), by exposing rainbow trout to similar to 1 kPa CO2 (similar to 1\% or 10 000 mu atm) in combination with normoxia or hyperoxia (similar to 21 or 42 kPa O-2, respectively). In normoxia, acute exposure to high CO2 caused a large acidosis in trout (blood pH decreased by 0.43 units), while a combination of hyperoxia and similar to 1 kPa CO2 increased the aerobic scope of trout by 28\%. Despite large changes in blood pH and aerobic scope between treatments, we observed no impacts on the CTmax of trout. Our results suggest that the mechanisms that determine the maximum temperature tolerance of trout are independent of blood acid-base balance or the capacity to deliver O-2 to tissues.",2024,10.1093/conphys/coae026,12,1,NA,coae026,CO2; CTmax; hypercapnia; hyperoxia; OCLTT
article,Neural effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> in fishmay be amplified by a vicious cycle,"Schunter, Celia and Ravasi, Timothy and Munday, Philip L. and Nilsson, Goran E.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Maladaptive behavioural disturbances have been reported in some fishes and aquatic invertebrates exposed to projected future CO2 levels. These disturbances have been linked to altered ion gradients and neurotransmitter function in the brain. Still, it seems surprising that the relatively small ionic changes induced by near-future CO2 levels can have such profound neural effects. Based on recent transcriptomics data, we propose that a vicious cycle can be triggered that amplifies the initial disturbance, explaining howsmall pH regulatory adjustments in response to ocean acidification can lead to major behavioural alterations in fish and other water-breathing animals. The proposed cycle is initiated by a reversal of the function of some inhibitory GABA(A) receptors in the direction of neural excitation and then amplified by adjustments in gene expression aimed at suppressing the excitation but in reality increasing it. In addition, the increased metabolic production of CO2 by overexcited neurons will feed into the cycle by elevating intracellular bicarbonate levels that will lead to increased excitatory ion fluxes through GABA(A) receptors. We also discuss the possibility that an initiation of a vicious cycle could be one of the several factors underlying the differences in neural sensitivity to elevated CO2 displayed by fishes.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz100,7,NA,NA,coz100,Ocean acidification; hypercapnia; GABA; behaviour; fish; brain
article,Effects of ocean acidification on embryonic respiration and development of a temperate wrasse living along a natural CO<sub>2</sub> gradient,"Cattano, Carlo and Giomi, Folco and Milazzo, Marco",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Volcanic CO2 seeps provide opportunities to investigate the effects of ocean acidification on organisms in the wild. To understand the influence of increasing CO2 concentrations on the metabolic rate (oxygen consumption) and the development of ocellated wrasse early life stages, we ran two field experiments, collecting embryos from nesting sites with different partial pressures of CO2 {[}pCO(2); ambient (similar to 400 mu atm) and high (800-1000 mu atm)] and reciprocally transplanting embryos from ambient- to high-CO2 sites for 30 h. Ocellated wrasse offspring brooded in different CO2 conditions had similar responses, but after transplanting portions of nests to the high-CO2 site, embryos from parents that spawned in ambient conditions had higher metabolic rates. Although metabolic phenotypic plasticity may show a positive response to high CO2, it often comes at a cost, in this case as a smaller size at hatching. This can have adverse effects because smaller larvae often exhibit a lower survival in the wild. However, the adverse effects of increased CO2 on metabolism and development did not occur when embryos from the high-CO2 nesting site were exposed to ambient conditions, suggesting that offspring from the high-CO2 nesting site could be resilient to a wider range of pCO(2) values than those belonging to the site with present-day pCO(2) levels. Our study identifies a crucial need to increase the number of studies dealing with these processes under global change trajectories and to expand these to naturally high-CO2 environments, in order to assess further the adaptive plasticity mechanism that encompasses non-genetic inheritance (epigenetics) through parental exposure and other downstream consequences, such as survival of larvae.",2016,10.1093/conphys/cov073,4,NA,NA,cov073,Early development; global change; physiological performance; Symphodus ocellatus; temperate fish
article,Physiological responses of three species of unionid mussels to intermittent exposure to elevated carbon dioxide,"Hannan, Kelly D. and Jeffrey, Jennifer D. and Hasler, Caleb T. and Suski, Cory D.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Freshwater systems are at risk owing to increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, and one of the possible reasons for these elevations is the deployment of non-physical fish barriers to prevent invasive fish movements. Carbon dioxide barriers have the potential to create short, chronic and intermittent exposures of CO2 for surrounding freshwater biota. Although intermittent exposures to a stressor may be more ecologically relevant, the majority of laboratory tests use chronic or short-term time periods to determine how organisms will respond to an environmental stressor. Measurements of the physiological responses of three species of unionid mussel, giant floaters (Pyganodon grandis), threeridge (Amblema plicata) and plain pocketbook (Lampsilis cardium), exposed to control pCO(2) (similar to 1000 mu atm) or intermittent conditions of pCO(2) (ranging from similar to 1000 to similar to 55 000 mu atm) 12 times per day over a 28 day period were gathered. There was no indication of recovery in the physiological responses of mussels between applications of CO2, suggesting that the recovery time between CO2 pulses (1.5 h) was not sufficient for recovery from the CO2 exposure period (0.5 h). Observations of acid-base and stress responses were consistent with what has been observed in chronic studies of freshwater mussels exposed to elevated pCO(2) (i.e. elevations in HCO3-, Ca2+, Na+ and glucose, and decreases in Mg2+ and Cl-). However, species differences were observed across almost all variables measured, which emphasizes the need for multispecies studies.",2016,10.1093/conphys/cow066,4,NA,NA,cow066,Acid-base regulation; bivalve; freshwater acidification; ions
article,Aerobic performance of two tropical cephalopod species unaltered by prolonged exposure to projected future carbon dioxide levels,"Spady, Blake L. and Nay, Tiffany J. and Rummer, Jodie L. and Munday, Philip L. and Watson, Sue-Ann",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Squid and many other cephalopods live continuously on the threshold of their environmental oxygen limitations. If the abilities of squid to effectively take up oxygen are negatively affected by projected future carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in ways similar to those demonstrated in some fish and invertebrates, it could affect the success of squid in future oceans. While there is evidence that acute exposure to elevated CO2 has adverse effects on cephalopod respiratory performance, no studies have investigated this in an adult cephalopod after relatively prolonged exposure to elevated CO2 or determined any effects on aerobic scope. Here, we tested the effects of prolonged exposure (>= 20\% of lifespan) to elevated CO2 levels (similar to 1000 mu atm) on the routine and maximal oxygen uptake rates, aerobic scope and recovery time of two tropical cephalopod species, the two-toned pygmy squid, Idiosepius pygmaeus and the bigfin reef squid, Sepioteuthis lessoniana. Neither species exhibited evidence of altered aerobic performance after exposure to elevated CO2 when compared to individuals held at control conditions. The recovery time of I. pygmaeus under both control and elevated CO2 conditions was less than 1 hour, whereas S. lessoniana required approximately 8 hours to recover fully following maximal aerobic performance. This difference in recovery time may be due to the more sedentary behaviours of I. pygmaeus. The ability of these two cephalopod species to cope with prolonged exposure to elevated CO2 without detriment to their aerobic performance suggests some resilience to an increasingly high CO2 world.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz024,7,NA,NA,coz024,Aerobic scope; cephalopod; CO2 respirometry; ocean acidification; oxygen uptake
article,"Effects of elevated temperature and <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> on the respiration, biomineralization and photophysiology of the giant clam <i>Tridacna maxima</i>","Brahmi, Chloe and Chapron, Leila and Le Moullac, Gilles and Soyez, Claude and Beliaeff, Benoit and Lazareth, Claire E. and Gaertner-Mazouni, Nabila and Vidal-Dupiol, Jeremie",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Many reef organisms, such as the giant clams, are confronted with global change effects. Abnormally high seawater temperatures can lead to mass bleaching events and subsequent mortality, while ocean acidification may impact biomineralization processes. Despite its strong ecological and socio-economic importance, its responses to these threats still need to be explored. We investigated physiological responses of 4-year-old Tridacna maxima to realistic levels of temperature (+1.5 degrees C) and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) (+800 mu atm of CO2) predicted for 2100 in French Polynesian lagoons during the warmer season. During a 65-day crossed-factorial experiment, individuals were exposed to two temperatures (29.2 degrees C, 30.7 degrees C) and two pCO(2) (430 mu atm, 1212 mu atm) conditions. The impact of each environmental parameter and their potential synergetic effect were evaluated based on respiration, biomineralization and photophysiology. Kinetics of thermal and/or acidification stress were evaluated by performing measurements at different times of exposure (29, 41, 53, 65 days). At 30.7 degrees C, the holobiont O-2 production, symbiont photosynthetic yield and density were negatively impacted. High pCO(2) had a significant negative effect on shell growth rate, symbiont photosynthetic yield and density. No significant differences of the shell microstructure were observed between control and experimental conditions in the first 29 days; however, modifications (i.e. less-cohesive lamellae) appeared from 41 days in all temperature and pCO(2) conditions. No significant synergetic effect was found. Present thermal conditions (29.2 degrees C) appeared to be sufficiently stressful to induce a host acclimatization response. All these observations indicate that temperature and pCO(2) are both forcing variables affecting T. maxima's physiology and jeopardize its survival under environmental conditions predicted for the end of this century.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab041,9,NA,1-17,coab041,Giant clams; ocean acidification; photosynthetic yield; respiration; symbionts; thermal stress
article,How free-ranging ungulates with differing water dependencies cope with seasonal variation in temperature and aridity,"Boyers, Melinda and Parrini, Francesca and Owen-Smith, Norman and Erasmus, Barend F. N. and Hetem, Robyn S.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"We compared the behavioural and physiological flexibility of two sympatric species with different water dependencies to seasonal variation in temperature and aridity. Both species coped relativelywell with current fluctuations, but as water sources become less reliable under future climate change scenarios, the water-dependent species may risk extirpation. Large mammals respond to seasonal changes in temperature and precipitation by behavioural and physiological flexibility. These responses are likely to differ between species with differing water dependencies. We used biologgers to contrast the seasonal differences in activity patterns, microclimate selection, distance to potential water source and body temperature of the water-independent gemsbok (Oryx gazella gazella) and water-dependent blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus), free-living in the arid Kalahari region of Botswana. Gemsbok were more active nocturnally during the hot seasons than in the cold-dry season, while wildebeest showed no seasonal difference in their nocturnal activity level. Both species similarly selected shaded microclimates during the heat of the day, particularly during the hot seasons. Wildebeest were further than 10 km from surface water 30\% or more of the time, while gemsbok were frequently recorded >20 km from potential water sources. In general, both species showed similar body temperature variation with highmaximum24-h body temperaturewhen conditions were hot and low minimum 24-h body temperatures when conditions were dry, resulting in the largest amplitude of 24-h body temperature rhythm during the hot-dry period. Wildebeest thus coped almost as well as gemsbok with the fairly typical seasonal conditions that occurred during our study period. They do need to access surface water and may travel long distances to do sowhenlocal water sources becomedepleted during drought conditions. Thus, perennial water sources should be provided judiciously and only where essential.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz064,7,NA,NA,coz064,behaviour flexibility; biologging; Climate Change; thermoregulation
article,A new analysis of hypoxia tolerance in fishes using a database of critical oxygen level (<i>P</i><sub>crit</sub>),"Rogers, Nicholas J. and UrbinaLt, Mauricio A. and Reardon, Erin E. and McKenzie, David J. and Wilsonl, Rod W.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Hypoxia is a common occurrence in aquatic habitats, and it is becoming an increasingly frequent and widespread environmental perturbation, primarily as the result of anthropogenic nutrient enrichment and climate change. An in-depth understanding of the hypoxia tolerance of fishes, and how this varies among individuals and species, is required to make accurate predictions of future ecological impacts and to provide better information for conservation and fisheries management. The critical oxygen level (P-crit)m has been widely used as a quantifiable trait of hypoxia tolerance. It is defined as the oxygen level below which the animal can no longer maintain a stable rate of oxygen uptake (oxyregulate) and uptake becomes dependent on ambient oxygen availability (the animal transitions to oxyconforming). A comprehensive database of P-crit values, comprising 331 measurements from 96 published studies, covering 151 fish species from 58 families, provides the most extensive and up-to-date analysis of hypoxia tolerance in teleosts. Methodologies for determining Pcrit are critically examined to evaluate its usefulness as an indicator of hypoxia tolerance in fishes. Various abiotic and biotic factors that interact with hypoxia are analysed for their effect on P, including temperature, CO,, acidification, toxic metals and feeding. Salinity, temperature, body mass and routine metabolic rate were strongly correlated with P-crit; 20\% of variation in the P-crit, data set was explained by these four variables. An important methodological issue not previously considered is the inconsistent increase in partial pressure of CO, within a closed respirometer during the measurement of P-crit. Modelling suggests that the final partial pressure of CO, reached can vary from 650 to 3500 mu atm depending on the ambient pH and salinity, with potentially major effects on blood acid-base balance and P it itself. This database will form part of a widely accessible repository of physiological trait data that will serve as a resource to facilitate future studies of fish ecology, conservation and management.",2016,10.1093/conphys/cow012,4,NA,NA,cow012,Carbon dioxide; critical oxygen tension; metabolic rate; oxygen and capacity limitation of thermal tolerance; physiological trait
article,Effect of elevated carbon dioxide on shoal familiarity and metabolism in a coral reef fish,"Nadler, Lauren E. and Killen, Shaun S. and McCormick, Mark I. and Watson, Sue-Ann and Munday, Philip L.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Atmospheric CO2 is expected to more than double by the end of the century. The resulting changes in ocean chemistry will affect the behaviour, sensory systems and physiology of a range of fish species. Although a number of past studies have examined effects of CO2 in gregarious fishes, most have assessed individuals in social isolation, which can alter individual behaviour and metabolism in social species. Within social groups, a learned familiarity can develop following a prolonged period of interaction between individuals, with fishes preferentially associating with familiar conspecifics because of benefits such as improved social learning and greater foraging opportunities. However, social recognition occurs through detection of shoal-mate cues; hence, it may be disrupted by near-future CO2 conditions. In the present study, we examined the influence of elevated CO2 on shoal familiarity and the metabolic benefits of group living in the gregarious damselfish species the blue-green puller (Chromis viridis). Shoals were acclimated to one of three nominal CO2 treatments: control (450 mu atm), mid-CO2 (750 mu atm) or high-CO2 (1000 mu atm). After a 4-7 day acclimation period, familiarity was examined using a choice test, in which individuals were given the choice to associate with familiar shoal-mates or unfamiliar conspecifics. In control conditions, individuals preferentially associated with familiar shoal-mates. However, this association was lost in both elevated-CO2 treatments. Elevated CO2 did not impact the calming effect of shoaling on metabolism, as measured using an intermittent-flow respirometry methodology for social species following a 17-20 day acclimation period to CO2 treatment. In all CO2 treatments, individuals exhibited a significantly lower metabolic rate when measured in a shoal vs. alone, highlighting the complexity of shoal dynamics and the processes that influence the benefits of shoaling.",2016,10.1093/conphys/cow052,4,NA,NA,cow052,Calming effect; carbon dioxide; familiarity; respiratory physiology; shoaling; social recognition
article,"Dehydration risk is associated with reduced nest attendance and hatching success in a cooperatively breeding bird, the southern pied babbler <i>Turdoides bicolor</i>","Bourne, Amanda R. and Ridley, Amanda R. and McKechnie, Andrew E. and Spottiswoode, Claire N. and Cunningham, Susan J. and Cooke, Steven",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"High air temperatures have measurable negative impacts on reproduction in wild animal populations, including during incubation in birds. Understanding the mechanisms driving these impacts requires comprehensive knowledge of animal physiology and behaviour under natural conditions. We used a novel combination of a non-invasive doubly labelled water (DLW) technique, nest temperature data and field-based behaviour observations to test effects of temperature, rainfall and group size on physiology and behaviour during incubation in southern pied babblers Turdoides bicolor, a cooperatively breeding passerine endemic to the arid savanna regions of southern Africa. The proportion of time that clutches were incubated declined as air temperatures increased, a behavioural pattern traditionally interpreted as a benefit of ambient incubation. However, we show that (i) clutches had a <50\% chance of hatching when exposed to daily maximum air temperatures of >35.3 degrees C; (ii) pied babbler groups incubated their nests almost constantly (99\% of daylight hours) except on hot days; (iii) operative temperatures in unattended nests frequently exceeded 40.5 degrees C, above which bird embryos are at risk of death; (iv) pied babblers incubating for long periods of time failed to maintain water balance on hot days; and (v) pied babblers from incubating groups lost mass on hot days. These results suggest that pied babblers might leave their nests during hot periods to lower the risk of dehydration associated with prolonged incubation at high operative temperatures. As mean air temperatures increase and extreme heat events become more frequent under climate change, birds will likely incur ever greater thermoregulatory costs of incubation, leading to compromised nest attendance and increased potential for eggs to overheat, with implications for nest success and, ultimately, population persistence.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab043,9,NA,NA,coab043,Climate change; cooperative breeding; high temperatures; incubation; parental care; southern pied babbler
article,Mapping physiology: biophysical mechanisms define scales of climate change impacts,"Choi, Francis and Gouhier, Tarik and Lima, Fernando and Rilov, Gil and Seabra, Rui and Helmuth, Brian",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"The rocky intertidal zone is a highly dynamic and thermally variable ecosystem, where the combined influences of solar radiation, air temperature and topography can lead to differences greater than 15 degrees C over the scale of centimetres during aerial exposure at low tide. For most intertidal organisms this small-scale heterogeneity in microclimates can have enormous influences on survival and physiological performance. However, the potential ecological importance of environmental heterogeneity in determining ecological responses to climate change remains poorly understood. We present a novel framework for generating spatially explicit models of microclimate heterogeneity and patterns of thermal physiology among interacting organisms. We used drone photogrammetry to create a topographic map (digital elevation model) at a resolution of 2 x 2 cm from an intertidal site in Massachusetts, which was then fed into to a model of incident solar radiation based on sky view factor and solar position. These data were in turn used to drive a heat budget model that estimated hourly surface temperatures over the course of a year (2017). Body temperature layers were then converted to thermal performance layers for organisms, using thermal performance curves, creating `physiological landscapes' that display spatially and temporally explicit patterns of `microrefugia'. Our framework shows how non-linear interactions between these layers lead to predictions about organismal performance and survivorship that are distinct from those made using any individual layer (e.g. topography, temperature) alone. We propose a new metric for quantifying the `thermal roughness' of a site (RqT, the root mean square of spatial deviations in temperature), which can be used to quantify spatial and temporal variability in temperature and performance at the site level. These methods facilitate an exploration of the role of micro-topographic variability in driving organismal vulnerability to environmental change using both spatially explicit and frequency-based approaches.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz028,7,NA,NA,coz028,Biomechanics; ecophysiology; environmental heterogeneity; intertidal zone; microclimate; microhabitat
article,"Venous blood gas in free-living eastern box turtles (<i>Terrapene carolina carolina</i>) and effects of physiologic, demographic and environmental factors","Adamovic, Laura and Leister, Katie and Byrd, John and Phillips, Christopher A. and Allender, Matthew C.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Sustainable wildlife populations depend on healthy individuals, and the approach to determine wellness of individuals is multifaceted. Blood gas analysis serves as a useful adjunctive diagnostic test for health assessment, but it is uncommonly applied to terrestrial reptiles. This study established reference intervals for venous blood gas panels in free-living eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina carolina, N = 102) from Illinois and Tennessee, and modeled the effects of environmental and physiologic parameters on each blood gas analyte. Blood gas panels included pH, partial pressure of oxygen (pO(2)), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)), total carbon dioxide (TCO2), bicarbonate (HCO3-), base excess (BE) and lactate. Candidate sets of general linear models were constructed for each blood gas analyte and ranked using an information-theoretic approach (AIC). Season, packed cell volume (PCV) and activity level were the most important predictors for all blood gas analytes (P < 0.05). Elevations in PCV were associated with increases in pCO(2) and lactate, and decreases in pH, pO(2), HCO3-, TCO2 and BE. Turtles with quiet activity levels had lower pH and pO(2) and higher pCO(2) than bright individuals. pH, HCO3-, TCO2 and BE were lowest in the summer, while pCO(2) and lactate were highest. Overall, blood pH was most acidic in quiet turtles with elevated PCVs during summer. Trends in the respiratory and metabolic components of the blood gas panel tended to be synergistic rather than antagonistic, demonstrating that either (1) mixed acid-base disturbances are common or (2) chelonian blood pH can reach extreme values prior to activation of compensatory mechanisms. This study shows that box turtle blood gas analytes depend on several physiologic and environmental parameters and the results serve as a baseline for future evaluation.",2018,10.1093/conphys/coy041,6,NA,NA,coy041,Blood gas; chelonian; eastern box turtle; iSTAT; reptile; Terrapene carolina carolina

Here, we observed the response of respiration rate to abiotic stressors associated with global change-environmentally relevant temperature treatments (-0.8 degrees C, 4 degrees C) and pH treatments reflecting current-day and future modeled extremes (8.2, 7.95 and 7.7 pH at -0.8 degrees C; 8.11, 7.95 and 7.7 pH at 4 degrees C). Sampling repeatedly over a 14-day period in laboratory experiments and using microplate respirometry techniques, we found that the metabolic rate of juvenile pteropods increased in response to low-pH exposure (pH 7.7) at -0.8 degrees C, a near-ambient temperature. Similarly, metabolic rate increased when pteropods were exposed simultaneously to multiple stressors: lowered pH conditions ( pH 7.7) and a high temperature (4 degrees C). Overall, the results showed that pCO(2) and temperature interact additively to affect metabolic rates in pteropods. Furthermore, we found that L. h. antarctica can tolerate acute exposure to temperatures far beyond its maximal habitat temperature. Overall, L. h. antarctica appears to be susceptible to pH and temperature stress, two abiotic stressors which are expected to be especially deleterious for ectothermic marine metazoans in polar seas.",2017,10.1093/conphys/cox064,5,NA,NA,cox064,Limacina helicina; metabolic rate; ocean acidification; pH; pteropods; temperature
article,Microclimate drives intraspecific thermal specialization: conservation perspectives in freshwater habitats,"Bartolini, Fabrizio and Giomi, Folco",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Endemic and relict species are often confined to ecological refugia or over fragmented distributions, representing priority conservation subjects. Within these sites, the individual population may realize distinct niches to a varying degree of specialization. An emblematic example is provided by freshwater species segregated in thermal-mineral springs, where individuals may face highly diverse microclimates in limited geographic areas. Downscaling the characterization of physiological traits to microclimatic niches becomes pivotal to adopt effective conservation measures in these heterogeneous habitats. Melanopsis etrusca (Brot, 1862) is an endangered relict snail endemic to a small number of thermal-mineral streams in central Italy. Here we describe the thermal tolerance of two populations of M. etrusca inhabiting streams with distinctly different thermal regimes, investigating the extent of physiological and behavioural specialization to such diverse microclimatic niches. The comparison of oxygen consumption rates of a population dwelling in temperate streams, characterized by seasonal temperature fluctuations (12-27 degrees C), with a population experiencing constantly hot water (35-38 degrees C) revealed the absence of any seasonal or geographic effect on metabolic compensation. Conversely, mobility performances were maximized in the population inhabiting the hot stream. Interestingly, here, the snails exhibited emersion behaviour outside the water, triggered by temperatures above 37 degrees C. In the field, individuals of this population are observed inactive on stream banks, conceivably to minimize the metabolic cost that otherwise would be induced by remaining in the hot water. Only a few individuals from the temperate stream exhibited the same behaviour when exposed to elevated temperatures, suggesting the exaptation of a preexisting trait during the evolutionary process of adaptation to hot waters. The present results provide elements for the best practice in future programmes aimed at reintroducing stocks of threatened species across heterogeneous habitats. Our study further underlines the relevance of downscaling data collection for endangered species conservation in order to recognize microclimatic specializations.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab006,9,NA,NA,coab006,Freshwater snail; microclimatic niche; relict species; respiration; thermal adaptation; thermoregulatory behaviour
article,The role of salinity in recovery of white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) from stimulated angling stress,"Shartau, Ryan B. and Shu, Jacelyn and Baker, Daniel W.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"White sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) in the Lower Fraser River are the focus of a catch-and-release angling fishery in British Columbia, Canada. However, the lower region of the catch area includes areas where tidal waters invade, and the consequence of salinity levels on recovery from an angling challenge are not characterized in sturgeon, despite theoretical implications of its import. We acclimated white sturgeon to various salinities (0, 10 and 20 parts per thousand (parts per thousand)) to investigate the effects of acclimation on recovery from stimulated angling stress that was induced through manual chasing. This challenge elicited the traditional physiological responses such as ion homeostasis disturbance, increases in secondary stress indicators and metabolic acidosis; however, environmental salinity altered the timing of recovery in some of the parameters measured. In addition, the severity of the intracellular pH disturbance in both heart and red blood cell seemed to be mediated in fresh water, yet the recovery pattern of plasma chloride and bicarbonate ions seemed to be facilitated by higher salinity. In general, responses were similar but not identical, leading us to conclude that the role of salinity on recovery from exercise is complex but not insignificant. Salinity may be important to behaviours exhibited by white sturgeon (such as migrations) in their respective saline environments, but less so around the impact of an angling stressor. Further exploration of this response may provide insight on whether the current tidal boundaries for angling white sturgeon are appropriate. White sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) may be acclimated to different salinities in the Fraser River, which may impact their ability to recover from severe exercise induced by angling. Sturgeon acclimated to different salinities and subjected to stimulated angling stress showed differences in recovery rate of physiological parameters.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad009,11,1,NA,coad009,sturgeon; salinity; fish; exercise; angling stress; Acid-base regulation

We assessed the hydric physiology of these lizards in a drought year and demonstrated relatively low water loss rates and low hydration. Animals can respond to extreme climates by behaviourally avoiding it or by physiologically coping with it. We understand behavioural and physiological thermoregulation, but water balance has largely been neglected. Climate change includes both global warming and changes in precipitation regimes, so improving our understanding of organismal water balance is increasingly urgent. We assessed the hydric physiology of US federally endangered blunt-nosed leopard lizards (Gambelia sila) by measuring cutaneous evaporative water loss (CEWL), plasma osmolality and body condition. Measurements were taken throughout their active season, the short period of year when these lizards can be found aboveground. Compared to a more mesic species, G. sila had low CEWL which is potentially desert-adaptive, and high plasma osmolality that could be indicative of dehydration. We hypothesized that throughout the G. sila active season, as their habitat got hotter and drier, G. sila would become more dehydrated and watertight. Instead, CEWL and plasma osmolality showed minimal change for females and non-linear change for males, which we hypothesize is connected to sex-specific reproductive behaviours and changes in food availability. We also measured thermoregulation and microhabitat use, expecting that more dehydrated lizards would have lower body temperature, poorer thermoregulatory accuracy and spend less time aboveground. However, we found no effect of CEWL, plasma osmolality or body condition on these thermal and behavioural metrics. Finally, G. sila spends considerable time belowground in burrows, and burrows may serve not only as essential thermal refugia but also hydric refugia.",2024,10.1093/conphys/coae019,12,1,NA,coae019,Cutaneous evaporative water loss; Gambelia sila; hydration; hydroregulation; osmoregulation; plasma osmolality
article,Wetland fishes avoid a carbon dioxide deterrent deployed in the field,"Bzonek, P. A. and Mandrak, N. E.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"We deployed a CO2 deterrent in the field and captured over 2000 fishes representing 13 species. The deterrent reduced catch rates for all species except brown bullhead. Common carp catch rates decreased 10-fold. These results indicate that an inexpensive and rapidly operating deterrent can produce robust responses in the field. Biological invasions are poorly controlled and contribute to the loss of ecosystem services and function. Altered watershed connectivity contributes to aquatic invasions, but such hydrologic connections have become important for human transport. Carbon dioxide (CO2) deterrents have been proposed to control the range expansion of invasive fishes, particularly through altered hydrologic connections, without impeding human transport. However, the effectiveness of CO2 deterrents needs to be further evaluated in the field, where fishes are situated in their natural environment and logistical challenges are present. We deployed a proof-of-concept CO2 deterrent within a trap-and-sort fishway in Cootes Paradise, Ontario, Canada, to determine the avoidance responses of fishes attempting to disperse into a wetland. We aimed to describe deterrent efficiency for our target species, common carp, and for native fishes dispersing into the wetland. Our inexpensive inline CO2 deterrent was deployed quickly and rapidly produced a CO2 plume of 60 mg/l. Over 2000 fishes, representing 13 species, were captured between 23 May and 8 July 2019. A generalized linear model determined that the catch rates of our target species, common carp (n = 1662), decreased significantly during deterrent activation, with catch rates falling from 2.56 to 0.26 individuals per hour. Aggregated catch rates for low-abundance species (n < 150 individuals per species) also decreased, while catch rates for non-target brown bullhead (n = 294) increased. Species did not express a phylogenetic signal in avoidance responses. These results indicate that CO2 deterrents produce a robust common carp avoidance response in the field. This pilot study deployed an inexpensive and rapidly operating deterrent, but to be a reliable management tool, permanent deterrents would need to produce a more concentrated CO2 plume with greater infrastructural support.",2022,10.1093/conphys/coac021,10,1,NA,coac021,non-structural deterrent; non-physical barrier; invasive species; fishway; Cyprinus carpio; common carp; Carbon dioxide

Abstract In many aquatic systems, native fishes are in decline and the factors responsible are often elusive. In the San Francisco Estuary (SFE) in California, interactions among native and non-native species are key factors contributing to the decline in abundance of endemic, endangered Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus). Climate change and drought-related stressors are further exacerbating declines. To assess how multiple environmental changes affect the physiology of native Delta Smelt and non-native Mississippi Silverside (Menidia beryllina) and Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides), fishes were exposed to serial exposures of a single stressor (elevated temperature or salinity) followed by two stressors (elevated temperature and salinity) to determine how a single stressor affects the capacity to cope with the addition of a second stressor. Critical thermal maximum (CTMax; a measure of upper temperature tolerance) was determined after 0, 2, 4 and 7 days following single and multiple stressors of elevated temperature (16 degrees C vs. 20 degrees C) and salinity (2.4 vs. 8-12 ppt, depending on species). Under control conditions, non-native fishes had significantly higher CTMax than the native Delta Smelt. An initial temperature or salinity stressor did not negatively affect the ability of any species to tolerate a subsequent multiple stressor. While elevated salinity had little effect on CTMax, a 4 degrees C increase in temperature increased CTMax. Bass experienced an additive effect of increased temperature and salinity on CTMax, such that CTMax further increased under multiple stressors. In addition, Bass demonstrated physiological sensitivity to multiple stressors demonstrated by changes in hematocrit and plasma osmolality, whereas the physiology of Silversides remained unaffected. Non-native Bass and Mississippi Silversides showed consistently higher thermal tolerance limits than the native Delta Smelt, supporting their abundance in warmer SFE habitats. Continued increases in SFE water temperatures predicted with climate change may further impact endangered Delta Smelt populations directly if habitat temperatures exceed thermal limits.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coy076,7,NA,NA,coy076,climate change; Delta Smelt; Largemouth Bass; Mississippi Silverside; salinity; temperature
article,"Responses to saltwater exposure vary across species, populations and life stages in anuran amphibians","Albecker, Molly A. and McCoy, Michael W.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"To predict the impacts of environmental change on species, we must first understand the factors that limit the present-day ranges of species. Most anuran amphibians cannot survive at elevated salinities, which may drive their distribution in coastal locations. Previous research showed that coastal Hyla cinerea are locally adapted to brackish habitats in North Carolina, USA. Although Hyla squirella and Hyla chrysoscelis both inhabit coastal wetlands nearby, they have not been observed in saline habitats. We take advantage of naturally occurring microgeographic variation in coastal wetland occupancy exhibited by these congeneric tree frog species to explore how salt exposure affects oviposition site choice, hatching success, early tadpole survival, plasma osmolality and tadpole body condition across coastal and inland locations. We observed higher survival among coastal H. cinerea tadpoles than inland H. cinerea, which corroborates previous findings. But contrary to expectations, coastal H. cinerea had lower survival than H. squirella and H. chrysoscelis, indicating that all three species may be able to persist in saline wetlands. We also observed differences in tadpole plasma osmolality across species, locations and salinities, but these differences were not associated with survival rates in salt water. Instead, coastal occupancy may be affected by stage-specific processes like higher probability of total clutch loss as shown by inland H. chrysoscelis or maladaptive egg deposition patterns as shown by inland H. squirella. Although we expected salt water to be the primary filter driving species distributions along a coastal salinity gradient, it is likely that the factors dictating anuran ranges along the coast involve stage-, species- and location-specific processes that are mediated by ecological processes and life history traits.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad062,11,1,NA,coad062,Anuran; complex life cycle; environmental change; frog; salinization; sea level rise
article,"Eucalypt leaf litter impairs growth and development of amphibian larvae, inhibits their antipredator responses and alters their physiology","Burraco, Pablo and Iglesias-Carrasco, Maider and Cabido, Carlos and Gomez-Mestre, Ivan",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Consequences of human actions like global warming, spread of exotic species or resource consumption are pushing species to extinction. Even species considered to be at low extinction risk often show signs of local declines. Here, we evaluate the impact of eucalypt plantations, the best-known exotic tree species worldwide and its interaction with temperature and predators on amphibian development, growth, antipredator responses and physiology. For this purpose, we applied a fully factorial experiment crossing two types of leaf litter (native oak or eucalypt), two temperatures (15 and 20 degrees C) and presence/absence of native predators. We found that leachates of eucalypt leaf litter reduced amphibian development and growth, compromised their antipredator responses and altered their metabolic rate. Increased temperature itself also posed serious alterations on development, growth, antioxidant ability and the immune status of tadpoles. However, the combined effects of eucalypt leaf litter and increased temperature were additive, not synergistic. Therefore, we show that non-lethal levels of a globally spread disruptor such as leachates from eucalypt leaf litter can seriously impact the life history and physiology of native amphibian populations. This study highlights the need to evaluate the status of wild populations exposed to human activities even if not at an obvious immediate risk of extinction, based on reliable stress markers, in order to anticipate demographic declines that may be hard to reverse once started. Replacing eucalypt plantations with native trees in protected areas would help improving the health of local amphibian larvae.

article,An unusually high upper thermal acclimation potential for rainbow trout,"Adams, Olivia A. and Zhang, Yangfan and Gilbert, Matthew H. and Lawrence, Craig S. and Snow, Michael and Farrell, Anthony P.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Thermal acclimation, a compensatory physiological response, is central to species survival especially during the current era of global warming. By providing the most comprehensive assessment to date for the cardiorespiratory phenotype of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) at six acclimation temperatures from 15 degrees C to 25 degrees C, we tested the hypothesis that, compared with other strains of rainbow trout, an Australian H-strain of rainbow trout has been selectively inbred to have an unusually high and broad thermal acclimation potential. Using a field setting at the breeding hatchery in Western Australia, thermal performance curves were generated for a warm-adapted H-strain by measuring growth, feed conversion efficiency, specific dynamic action, whole-animal oxygen uptake (\& x1e40;O-2) during normoxia and hypoxia, the critical maximum temperature and the electrocardiographic response to acute warming. Appreciable growth and aerobic capacity were possible up to 23 degrees C. However, growth fell off drastically at 25 degrees C in concert with increases in the time required to digest a meal, its total oxygen cost and its peak \& x1e40;O-2. The upper thermal tipping points for appetite and food conversion efficiency corresponded with a decrease in the ability to increase heart rate during warming and an increase in the cost to digest a meal. Also, comparison of upper thermal tipping points provides compelling evidence that limitations to increasing heart rate during acute warming occurred well below the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and that the faltering ability of the heart to deliver oxygen at different acclimation temperatures is not reliably predicted by CTmax for the H-strain of rainbow trout. We, therefore, reasoned the remarkably high thermal acclimation potential revealed here for the Australian H-strain of rainbow trout reflected the existing genetic variation within the founder Californian population, which was then subjected to selective inbreeding in association with severe heat challenges. This is an encouraging discovery for those with conservation concerns for rainbow trout and other fish species. Indeed, those trying to predict the impact of global warming should more fully consider the possibility that the standing intra-specific genetic variation within a fish species could provide a high thermal acclimation potential, similar to that shown here for rainbow trout. We address a crucial question relevant to global climate change and of general interest to ecological and conservation physiologists: does a fish species normally regarded as a cold-loving species have sufficient standing intra-specific variation to form a warm-tolerant population that could perhaps thrive in a warmer world?",2022,10.1093/conphys/coab101,10,1,NA,coab101,standing variation; hypoxia; heart rate; growth; digestion; aerobic capacity

Future climate scenarios indicate that sub-tropical oceans will become more acidic, and the temperature and salinity will increase relative to current conditions. A large portion of previous work has focused on how future climate scenarios may impact shell-forming organisms and coral reef fish, with little attention given to fish that inhabit nearshore habitats; few studies have examined multiple challenges concurrently. The purpose of this study was to quantify the blood-based physiological response of nearshore fishes to a suite of seawater conditions associated with future climate change. Fish were exposed to an acute (30 min) increase in salinity (50 ppt), acidity (decrease in pH by 0.5 units) or temperature (7-10 degrees C), or temperature and acidity combined, and held in these conditions for 6 h. Their physiological responses were compared across seasons (i.e. summer vs. winter). Bonefish (Albula vulpes) exposed to environmental challenges in the summer experienced a suite of blood-based osmotic and ionic disturbances relative to fish held in ambient conditions, with thermal challenges (particularly in the summer) being the most challenging. Conversely, no significant treatment effects were observed for yellowfin mojarra (Gerres cinereus) or checkered puffer (Sphoeroides testudineus) in either season.

We aimed to better understand the seed biology and ecology of C. fraseri to determine the mechanisms by which seed dormancy might be alleviated, and the conditions that support germination to inform the use of this species in restoration. Dormancy breaking treatments (wet heat, dry heat, scarification) commonly applied to species with physical seed dormancy (PY) were tested along with stratification at 5-35 degrees C (nine treatments). Following dormancy alleviation, seeds were germinated at nine temperatures (5 to 40 degrees C) and five water potentials (0 to -0.8 MPa) to understand environmental thresholds that regulate germination physiology in non-dormant seeds. A proportion of seeds (<0.3) lose dormancy naturally in response to warm (25 to 35 degrees C) moist conditions, which dislodges the hypostase plug that prevents water uptake, whilst neither dry (>= 100 degrees C) nor wet (similar to 100 degrees C) heat were effective. Dormancy loss was also achieved by exposing seeds to concentrated (95-98\% v/v) sulphuric acid for 3-7 hours, after which high proportions (>0.75) of germination were observed. Cochlospermum fraseri seeds possess PY, which is alleviated by seasonal temperatures that occur when soil moisture is high, allowing seeds to employ a risk-adverse strategy and maximize establishment success in episodic environments with stochastic rainfall events. The understanding of dormancy alleviation requirements gained here adds to our knowledge of PY worldwide and recruitment dynamics in the Australian monsoonal tropics and will aid land managers and restoration practitioners by informing both seeding sites and optimal time for in situ sowing as well as the potential capacity of this species to form a persistent soil seed bank.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad057,11,1,NA,coad057,Dormancy; Northern Australia; physiology; restoration; thermal performance

C. and Rummer, Jodie L.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Atmospheric CO2 is increasing due to anthropogenic causes. Approximately 30\% of this CO2 is being absorbed by the oceans and is causing ocean acidification (OA). The effects of OA on calcifying organisms are starting to be understood, but less is known about the effects on non-calcifying organisms, notably elasmobranchs. One of the few elasmobranch species that has been studied with respect to OA is the epaulette shark, Hemiscyllium ocellatum. Mature epaulette sharks can physiologically and behaviourally tolerate prolonged exposure to elevated CO2, and this is thought to be because they are routinely exposed to diurnal decreases in O-2 and probably concomitant increases in CO2 in their coral reef habitats. It follows that H. ocellatum embryos, while developing in ovo on the reefs, would have to be equally if not more tolerant than adults because they would not be able to escape such conditions. Epaulette shark eggs were exposed to either present-day control conditions (420 mu atm) or elevated CO2 (945 mu atm) and observed every 3 days from 10 days post-fertilization until 30 days post-hatching. Growth (in square centimetres per day), yolk usage (as a percentage), tail oscillations (per minute), gill movements (per minute) and survival were not significantly different in embryos reared in control conditions when compared with those reared in elevated CO2 conditions.

F. and Grosell, Martin and Steffensen, John F.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Although considered a stenohaline freshwater species, European perch (Perca fluviatilis) inhabit brackish waters. The present study determined the maximum salinity tolerance and osmoregulatory capability on individuals originating from brackish water and from freshwater populations. The fish were acclimated for 3 weeks to salinities of 0, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5 and 20 after an initial stepwise increase to the target salinity. The maximum salinity tolerance was determined as the test salinity below which the fish could not acclimate and lost equilibrium. Blood plasma osmolality was measured if the fish had not lost equilibrium after the acclimation period. The maximum salinity tolerance was 17.5 for brackish water European perch and 10 for fresh water European perch. The high salinity tolerance of the brackish water European perch was caused by their ability to both hyper- and hypo-osmoregulate, whereas the freshwater originating fish could only hyper-osmoregulate. The results showed that maximum salinity tolerances and osmoregulatory capabilities depends on the origin habitat salinity. Due to genetic differentiation between European perch populations in brackish and fresh water, the possibility of brackish water European perch being a subspecies of European perch is discussed, yet vital knowledge concerning heritability of salinity tolerance traits is still missing. Regardless of species status, within-species plasticity in the ability to cope with varying salinities have substantial ecological and conservation implications and underlines the need for managing brackish water and freshwater European perch stocks separately.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz004,7,NA,NA,coz004,Brackish water; osmoregulation; plasticity
article,Does physiological tolerance to acute hypoxia and salinity change explain ecological niche in two intertidal crab species?,"Falconer, Thomas R. L. and Marsden, Islay D. and Hill, Jonathan V. and Glover, Chris N.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Intertidal biota is subjected to significant fluctuations in environmental parameters such as salinity and dissolved oxygen (DO). In the current study, the effects of salinity and DO on metabolic rate, critical oxygen partial pressure (P-crit), heart rate and osmoregulation in two intertidal crab species commonly found on New Zealand coastlines, Hemigrapsus crenulatus and Hemigrapsus sexdentatus, were measured. Based on its habitation of burrows in the lower intertidal zone, H. crenulatus was predicted to be more resilient to these environmental stressors than H. sexdentatus, which is distributed in the mid to high tidal zone. However, relative to the full-strength seawater control, there were no consistent salinity-dependent changes in respiratory or cardiovascular endpoints in either species following acute 6-h exposures mimicking a tidal cycle. Analysis of haemolymph osmolality and ions determined that both crab species were strong osmotic and ionic regulators over the 6-h exposure period. However, the threshold salinities at which significant changes in osmotic and ionic regulation occurred did differ and generally indicated that H. crenulatus was the better regulator. Respiratory and cardiovascular responses to DO were prominent, with a strong bradycardia observed in both species. Changes in osmolality and sodium ion regulation were also seen as DO declined. The effect on sodium ion levels had its onset at a higher oxygen partial pressure in H. sexdentatus than in H. crenulatus, indicative of a relatively poorer hypoxia tolerance in the former species. The relative resilience of respiratory, cardiovascular and osmoregulatory processes to salinity and DO variations likely contribute to distinct habitat distributions of the two crab species on New Zealand shorelines, although behaviour and inter-specific interactions may also play important roles.

The experiment revealed that warming and acidification triggers a stress response at the molecular level and decrease herring larvae size-at-stage. Global change puts coastal systems under pressure, affecting the ecology and physiology of marine organisms. In particular, fish larvae are sensitive to environmental conditions, and their fitness is an important determinant of fish stock recruitment and fluctuations. To assess the combined effects of warming, acidification and change in food quality, herring larvae were reared in a control scenario (11 \& DEG;C{*}pH 8.0) and a scenario predicted for 2100 (14 \& DEG;C{*}pH 7.6) crossed with two feeding treatments (enriched in phosphorus and docosahexaenoic acid or not). The experiment lasted from hatching to the beginning of the post-flexion stage (i.e. all fins present) corresponding to 47 days post-hatch (dph) at 14 \& DEG;C and 60 dph at 11 \& DEG;C. Length and stage development were monitored throughout the experiment and the expression of genes involved in growth, metabolic pathways and stress responses were analysed for stage 3 larvae (flexion of the notochord). Although the growth rate was unaffected by acidification and temperature changes, the development was accelerated in the 2100 scenario, where larvae reached the last developmental stage at a smaller size (-8\%). We observed no mortality related to treatments and no effect of food quality on the development of herring larvae. However, gene expression analyses revealed that heat shock transcripts expression was higher in the warmer and more acidic treatment. Our findings suggest that the predicted warming and acidification environment are stressful for herring larvae, inducing a decrease in size-at-stage at a precise period of ontogeny.

We quantified the realized microclimatic niches and the hydrothermal germination thresholds in four threatened taxa (Tetratheca erubescens, Tetratheca harperi, Tetratheca paynterae subsp. paynterae and Tetratheca aphylla subsp. aphylla) that are restricted to individual Banded Ironstone Formations in Western Australia. While T. aphylla subsp. aphylla largely failed to germinate in our trials, all other species demonstrated extended hydrothermal time accumulation (186-500 degrees C MPa days), cool minimum temperatures (7.8-8.5 degrees C), but broad base water potential thresholds (-2.46 to -5.41 MPa) under which germination occurred. These slow germination dynamics are suggestive of cool and wet winter months, where soil moisture is retained to a greater capacity in local microsites where these species occur, rather than the warmer and drier conditions in the surrounding arid environment. Hydrothermal time-to-event modelling showed that each species occupied unique hydrothermal germination niches, which correspond with the microclimatic differences the species are exposed to. Our results provide a baseline understanding for environmental and germination thresholds that govern the recruitment, and ultimately the population structure and persistence, of these short-range endemic plants.

Currently, many marine primary producers use HCO3- for photosynthesis, but this is energetically costly. Increasing passive CO2 uptake relative to HCO3- pathways could provide energy savings, leading to increased productivity and growth of marine plants. Inorganic-carbon-uptake mechanisms in the seagrass Amphibolis antarctica were determined using the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide (AZ) and the buffer tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (TRIS). Amphibolis antarctica seedlings were also maintained in current and forecasted CO2 concentrations to measure their physiology and growth. Photosynthesis of A. antarctica was significantly reduced by AZ and TRIS, indicating utilization of HCO3- -uptake mechanisms. When acclimated plants were switched between CO2 treatments, the photosynthetic rate was dependent on measurement conditions but not growth conditions, indicating a dynamic response to changes in dissolved CO2 concentration, rather than lasting effects of acclimation. At forecast CO2 concentrations, seedlings had a greater maximum electron transport rate (1.4-fold), photosynthesis (2.1-fold), below-ground biomass (1.7-fold) and increase in leaf number (2-fold) relative to plants in the current CO2 concentration. The greater increase in photosynthesis (measured as O-2 production) compared with the electron transport rate at forecasted CO2 concentration suggests that photosynthetic efficiency increased, possibly due to a decrease in photorespiration. Thus, it appears that the photosynthesis and growth of seagrasses reliant on energetically costly HCO3- acquisition, such as A. -antarctica, might increase at forecasted CO2 concentrations. Greater growth might enhance the future prosperity and rehabilitation of these important habitat-forming plants, which have experienced declines of global significance.",2014,10.1093/conphys/cou052,2,1,NA,cou052,Amphibolis antarctica; carbon dioxide; carbonic anhydrase; electron transport rate; oxygen evolution; photosynthesis

Habitat specialists may also be particularly vulnerable if they have specific abiotic requirements. Here we assess whether thermal and hydric constraints can explain the highly restricted and declining distributions of the critically endangered terrestrial-breeding frog, Geocrinia alba. We also evaluate the species' vulnerability to climate change based on the similarity of current microclimatic conditions to their physiological limits. We found that G. alba had low thresholds of thermal and desiccation tolerance relative to other anuran species. The estimated thermal optimum (T-opt) and critical thermal maxima (CTmax) were 23.3 degrees C and 29.6 degrees C, respectively, and adult frogs had an absorption threshold (AT, the lowest water potential at which water can be absorbed from a substrate) of -50 kPa, the lowest recorded for an amphibian. Comparing environmental conditions and water loss in the field using agar models showed that riparian habitats where frogs occur provide a unique microclimate in the landscape, offering significantly lower desiccation risk during extreme summer conditions compared to immediately adjacent riparian and terrestrial habitats. Monitoring of microclimate conditions within occupied frog habitats over 2 years showed that in extreme dry and hot years the AT was exceeded at six of eight sites, and T-opt was exceeded at two of eight sites. Given their specific physiological limits, the apparent rarity of suitable microclimates and a regional drying-warming trend, we suggest that G. alba occupies a potentially disappearing niche and may be indicative of other habitat specialists that rely on ephemeral drainages.

Unintentional releases of hypersaline water into freshwater environments act as an osmoregulatory stressor to many aquatic organisms including native salmonids like the Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus). Compared to more euryhaline salmonids, Arctic grayling have a reduced salinity tolerance and develop an elevated interlamellar cell mass (ILCM) in response to salinity exposure (17 ppt). In this study, we described the gill morphology and cell types characterizing the ICLM. Further, we investigated whether Arctic grayling could recover in freshwater following a short-term (<48 h) salinity exposure. Arctic grayling were exposed to 17 ppt saline water for 12, 24 and 48 h. Following the 24 and 48 h salinity exposure, Arctic grayling were returned to freshwater for 24 h to assess their ability to recover from, and reverse, the osmotic disturbances. Physiological serum {[}Na+], {[}Cl-] and total osmolality were significantly elevated and progressively increased at 12, 24 and 48 h salinity exposures. The 24 h post-exposure recovery period resulted in Arctic grayling serum ion concentrations and total osmolality returning to near normal levels. Similar recovery patterns were observed in the salinity-induced ILCM, which developed as early as 12 h of exposure to 17 ppt, and then reverted to control levels following 24 h in freshwater. Gill histology indicates an increased number of apically located mucous cells in the interlamellar space following salinity exposure of Arctic grayling. The scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy data show the presence of granule containing eosinophillike cells infiltrating the ILCM suggesting a salinity-induced immune response by the Arctic grayling.",2017,10.1093/conphys/cox040,5,NA,NA,cox040,hydraulic fracturing; hypersaline; ILCM; osmoregulation; salmonid
article,"Plant water use characteristics of five dominant shrub species of the Lower Rio Grande Valley, Texas, USA: implications for shrubland restoration and conservation","Adhikari, Arjun and White, Joseph D.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"The biogeographic distribution of plant species is inherently associated with the plasticity of physiological adaptations to environmental variation. For semi-arid shrublands with a legacy of saline soils, characterization of soil water-tolerant shrub species is necessary for habitat restoration given future projection of increased drought magnitude and persistence in these ecosystems. Five dominant native shrub species commonly found in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, TX, USA, were studied, namely Acacia farnesiana, Celtis ehrenbergiana, Forestiera angustifolia, Parkinsonia aculeata and Prosopis glandulosa. To simulate drought conditions, we suspended watering of healthy, greenhouse-grown plants for 4 weeks. Effects of soil salinity were also studied by dosing plants with 10\% NaCl solution with suspended watering. For soil water deficit treatment, the soil water potential of P. glandulosa was the highest (-1.20 MPa), followed by A. farnesiana (-4.69 MPa), P. aculeata (-5.39 MPa), F. angustifolia (-6.20 MPa) and C. ehrenbergiana (-10.02 MPa). For the soil salinity treatment, P. glandulosa also had the highest soil water potential value (-1.60 MPa), followed by C. ehrenbergiana (-1.70 MPa), A. farnesiana (-1.84 MPa), P. aculeata (-2.04 MPa) and F. angustifolia (-6.99 MPa). Within the species, only C. ehrenbergiana and F. angustifolia for soil water deficit treatment and A. farnesiana for the salinity treatment had significantly lower soil water potential after 4 weeks of treatment (P < 0.05). We found that soil water potential, stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis of the species significantly reduced over time for both treatments (P < 0.05). We conclude that while all species exhibited capacities to withstand current water availability, some species demonstrated limited tolerance for extreme water stress that may be important for management of future shrub diversity in Lower Rio Grande Valley.",2014,10.1093/conphys/cou005,2,1,NA,cou005,Gas exchange; soil salinity; soil water deficit; soil water potential; thorn shrubs

The allopatric upstream spawning habitat of the Central Valley (CV) population connects with the sympatric rearing grounds via relatively low salinity waters, whereas the San Pablo (SP) population must pass through the relatively high-salinity Upper SFE to reach its allopatric downstream spawning habitat. We hypothesize that if migration through SFE salinities to SP spawning grounds is more challenging for adult CV than SP splittail, then salinity tolerance, osmoregulatory capacity, and metabolic responses to salinity will differ between populations. Osmoregulatory disturbances, assessed by measuring plasma osmolality and ions, muscle moisture and Na+-K+-ATPase activity after 168 to 336 h at 11 parts per thousand salinity, showed evidence for a more robust osmoregulatory capacity in adult SP relative to CV splittail. While both resting and maximum metabolic rates were elevated in SP splittail in response to increased salinity, CV splittail metabolic rates were unaffected by salinity. Further, the calculated difference between resting and maximum metabolic values, aerobic scope, did not differ significantly between populations. Therefore, improved osmoregulation came at a metabolic cost for SP splittail but was not associated with negative impacts on scope for aerobic metabolism. These results suggest that SP splittail may be physiologically adjusted to allow for migration through higher-salinity waters. The trends in interpopulation variation in osmoregulatory and metabolic responses to salinity exposures support our hypothesis of greater salinity-related challenges to adult CV than SP splittail migration and are consistent with our previous findings for juvenile splittail populations, further supporting our recommendation of population-specific management.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa098,8,NA,NA,coaa098,California; cyprinid; metabolism; osmoregulation; salinity; splittail

This focus is driven by conservation concerns where the health of pteropod populations is threatened by the high susceptibility of their shells to dissolution in lowaragonite saturation states associated with OA and how coupling of these stressors may push pteropods past the limits of physiological plasticity. In this manipulation experiment, we describe changes in the transcriptome of the Antarctic pteropod, Limacina helicina antarctica, to these combined stressors. The conditions used in the laboratory treatments met or exceeded those projected for the Southern Ocean by the year 2100. We made two general observations regarding the outcome of the data: (1) Temperature was more influential than pH in terms of changing patterns of gene expression, and (2) these Antarctic pteropods appeared to have a significant degree of transcriptomic plasticity to respond to acute abiotic stress in the laboratory. In general, differential gene expression was observed amongst the treatments; here, for example, transcripts associated with maintaining protein structure and cell proliferation were up-regulated. To disentangle the effects of OA and OW, we used a weighted gene co-expression network analysis to explore patterns of change in the transcriptome. This approach identified gene networks associated with OW that were enriched for transcripts proposed to be involved in increasing membrane fluidity at warmer temperatures. Together these data provide evidence that L.h.antarctica has a limited capacity to acclimate to the combined conditions of OA and OW used in this study. This reduced scope of acclimation argues for continued study of how adaptation to polar aquatic environments may limit the plasticity of present-day populations in responding to future environmental change.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa013,8,NA,NA,coaa013,Limacina helicina antarctica; ocean acidification; ocean warming; physiological plasticity; Pteropod; RNAseq

J. and Milsom, W. K.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Every year, bar-headed geese (Anser indicus) perform some of the most remarkable trans-Himalayan migrations, and researchers are increasingly interested in understanding the physiology underlying their high-altitude flight performance. A major challenge is generating reliable measurements of blood parameters on wild birds in the field, where established analytical techniques are often not available. Therefore, we validated two commonly used portable clinical analysers (PCAs), the i-STAT and the HemoCue systems, for the analysis of blood parameters in bar-headed geese. The pH, partial pressures of O-2 and CO2 (PO2 and PCO2), haemoglobin O-2 saturation (sO(2)), haematocrit (Hct) and haemoglobin concentration {[}Hb] were simultaneously measured with the two PCA systems (i-STAT for all parameters; HemoCue for {[}Hb]) and with conventional laboratory techniques over a physiological range of PO2, PCO2 and Hct. Our results indicate that the i-STAT system can generate reliable values on bar-headed goose whole blood pH, PO2, PCO2 and Hct, but we recommend correcting the obtained values using the linear equations determined here for higher accuracy. The i-STAT is probably not able to produce meaningful measurements of sO(2) and {[}Hb] over a range of physiologically relevant environmental conditions. However, we can recommend the use of the HemoCue to measure {[}Hb] in the bar-headed goose, if results are corrected. We emphasize that the equations that we provide to correct PCA results are applicable only to bar-headed goose whole blood under the conditions that we tested. We encourage researchers to validate i-STAT or HemoCue results thoroughly for their specific study conditions and species in order to yield accurate results.",2015,10.1093/conphys/cov021,3,NA,NA,cov021,Bird; carbon dioxide; oxygen; pH; portable clinical analyser

Some Atlantic herring spawning grounds are predicted to be highly affected by ongoing Ocean Acidification and Warming with water temperature increasing by up to +3 degrees C and CO2 levels reaching ca. 1000 mu atm (RCP 8.5). Although many studies investigated the effects of high levels of CO2 on the embryonic development of Atlantic herring, little is known about the combination of temperature and ecologically relevant levels of CO2. In this study, we investigated the effects of Ocean Acidification and Warming on embryonic metabolic and developmental performance such as mitochondrial function, respiration, hatching success (HS) and growth in Atlantic herring from the Oslo Fjord, one of the spawning grounds predicted to be greatly affected by climate change. Fertilized eggs were incubated under combinations of two PCO2 conditions (400 mu atm and 1100 mu atm) and three temperatures (6, 10 and 14 degrees C), which correspond to current and end-of-the-century conditions. We analysed HS, oxygen consumption (MO2) and mitochondrial function of embryos as well as larval length at hatch. The capacity of the electron transport system (ETS) increased with temperature, reaching a plateau at 14 degrees C, where the contribution of Complex I to the ETS declined in favour of Complex II. This relative shift was coupled with a dramatic increase in MO2 at 14 degrees C. HS was high under ambient spawning conditions (6-10 degrees C), but decreased at 14 degrees C and hatched larvae at this temperature were smaller. Elevated PCO(2 )increased larval malformations, indicating sub-lethal effects. These results indicate that energetic limitations due to thermally affected mitochondria and higher energy demand for maintenance occur at the expense of embryonic development and growth.",2018,10.1093/conphys/coy050,6,NA,NA,coy050,Atlantic herring; embryonic development; mitochondrial capacity; Ocean Acidification; Ocean Warming; respiration

To understand if fish populations have the capacity to respond to multiple stressors, it is critical to examine interactive effects across multiple biological scales, from cellular metabolism to species interactions. This study examined the effects of CO2-acidification and hypoxia on two naturally cooccurring species, juvenile rockfish (genus Sebastes) and a known predator, cabezon (Scorpaenichthys marmoratus). Fishes were exposed to two PCO2 levels at two dissolved oxygen (DO) levels: similar to 600 (ambient) and similar to 1600 (high) mu atm PCO2 and 8.0 (normoxic) and 4.5 mgl(-1) DO (hypoxic) and assessments of cellular metabolism, prey behavior and predation mortality rates were quantified after 1 and 3 weeks. Physiologically, rockfish showed acute alterations in cellular metabolic enzyme activity after 1 week of acclimation to elevated PCO2 and hypoxia that were not evident in cabezon. Alterations in rockfish energy metabolism were driven by increases in anaerobic LDH activity, and adjustments in enzyme activity ratios of cytochrome c oxidase and citrate synthase and LDH:CS. Correlated changes in rockfish behavior were also apparent after 1 week of acclimation to elevated PCO2 and hypoxia. Exploration behavior increased in rockfish exposed to elevated PCO2 and spatial analysis of activity indicated short-term interference with anti-predator responses. Predation rate after 1 week increased with elevated PCO2 ; however, no mortality was observed under the multiple-stressor treatment suggesting negative effects on cabezon predators. Most noteworthy, metabolic and behavioral changes were moderately compensated after 3 weeks of acclimation, and predation mortality rates also decreased suggesting that these rockfish may be resilient to changes in environmental stressors predicted by climate models.

We investigated the aerobic metabolic scope of the spiny damselfish, Acanthochromis polyacanthus, from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia when exposed for 17 days to CO2 conditions predicted for the end of the century (946 mu atm CO2). Surprisingly, resting O-2 consumption rates were significantly lower and maximal O-2 consumption rates significantly higher in high-CO2-exposed fish compared with control fish (451 mu atm CO2). Consequently, high-CO2-exposed fish exhibited an unexpected increase in absolute (38\%) and factorial aerobic scopes (47\%). Haematological and muscle water changes associated with exercise were not affected by CO2 treatment. Thus, contrary to predictions, our results suggest that elevated CO2 may enhance aerobic scope of some fish species. Long-term experiments are now required to assess the response to elevated CO2 further, because developmental and transgenerational effects can be dramatic in fish.

We found that koalas are more heterothermic than previously recognized. Tb increased with ambient temperature and disease disrupted the 24-hr circadian pattern of Tb. Behaviour (i.e. tree hugging and drinking free water) was not effective in moderating Tb. Thermoregulation is critical for endotherms living in hot, dry conditions, and maintaining optimal core body temperature (Tb) in a changing climate is an increasingly challenging task for mammals. Koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) have evolved physiological and behavioural strategies to maintain homeostasis and regulate their Tb but are thought to be vulnerable to prolonged heat. We investigated how weather, behaviour and disease influence Tb for wild, free-living koalas during summer in north-west New South Wales. We matched Tb with daily behavioural observations in an ageing population where chlamydial disease is prevalent. Each individual koala had similar Tb rhythms (average Tb = 36.4 +/- 0.05 degrees C), but male koalas had higher Tb amplitude and more pronounced daily rhythm than females. Disease disrupted the 24-hr circadian pattern of Tb. Koala Tb increased with ambient temperature (Ta). On the hottest day of the study (maximum Ta = 40.8 degrees C), we recorded the highest (Tb = 40.8 degrees C) but also the lowest (Tb = 32.4 degrees C) Tb ever documented for wild koalas, suggesting that they are more heterothermic than previously recognized. This requires individuals to predict days of extreme Ta from overnight and early morning conditions, adjusting Tb regulation accordingly, and it has never been reported before for koalas. The large diel amplitude and low minimum Tb observed suggest that koalas at our study site are energetically and nutritionally compromised, likely due to their age. Behaviour (i.e. tree hugging and drinking water) was not effective in moderating Tb. These results indicate that Ta and koala Tb are strongly interconnected and reinforce the importance of climate projections for predicting the future persistence of koalas throughout their current distribution. Global climate models forecast that dry, hot weather will continue to escalate and drought events will increase in frequency, duration and severity.

These environmental factors have the potential to influence organismal performance and fitness at different life stages.Tropical and temperate holothurians are more vulnerable to temperature and pH than those from colder water environments. The high level of environmental variation observed in the oceans could influence organismal responses and even produce a wide spectrum of compensatory physiological mechanisms. It is possible that in these areas, larval survival will decline by up to 50\% in response to a reduction of 0.5 pH units. Such reduction in pH may trigger low intrinsic growth rates and affect the sustainability of the resource. Here we describe the individual and combined effects that temperature and pH could produce in these organisms. We also describe how these effects can scale from individuals to the population level by using age-structured spatial models in which depensation can be integrated. The approach shows how physiology can improve the conservation of the resource based on the restriction of growth model parameters and by including a density threshold, below which the fitness of the population, specifically intrinsic growth rate, decreases.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab092,9,NA,NA,coab092,temperature; sea cucumber; population; physiology; pH; Allee effect

The changes have been linked to altered function of GABAergic neurotransmitter systems, because the behavioural alterations can be reversed rapidly by treatment with the GABA(A) receptor antagonist gabazine. Characterization of the molecular mechanisms involved would be greatly aided if these can be examined in a well-characterized model organism with a sequenced genome. It was recently shown that CO2-induced behavioural alterations are not confined to tropical species, but also affect the three-spined stickleback, although an involvement of the GABA(A) receptor was not examined. Here, we show that loss of lateralization in the stickleback can be restored rapidly and completely by gabazine treatment. This points towards a worrying universality of disturbed GABA(A) function after high-CO2 exposure in fishes from tropical to temperate marine habitats. Importantly, the stickleback is a model species with a sequenced and annotated genome, which greatly facilitates future studies on underlying molecular mechanisms.",2015,10.1093/conphys/cov018,3,NA,NA,cov018,gamma-Aminobutyric acid; brain; global change; hypercapnia; lateralization; temperate fish

However, environmental limitations (e.g. temperature, atmospheric humidity and rain) and lack of reference values may inhibit researchers from using such a device with certain wildlife species. Evaluating the use of alternative sample types, such as plasma, in a POC device may afford researchers the opportunity to delay sample analysis and the ability to use banked samples. In this study, we examined fresh whole blood, fresh plasma and frozen plasma (sample type) pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2), bicarbonate (HCO3-), total carbon dioxide (TCO2), base excess (BE), partial pressure of oxygen (PO2), oxygen saturation (sO(2)) and lactate concentrations in 23 juvenile American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) using an i-STAT CG4+ cartridge. Our results indicate that sample type had no effect on lactate concentration values (F-2,F-65 = 0.37, P = 0.963), suggesting that the i-STAT analyser can be used reliably to quantify lactate concentrations in fresh and frozen plasma samples. In contrast, the other seven blood parameters measured by the CG4+ cartridge were significantly affected by sample type.

In this study, the influence of the heart in thermal limitation was investigated by measurements of aerobic scope in the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) together with measurements of cardiac output during rest and activity. Aerobic capacity was not limited by an acutely increased temperature in the European eel. Oxygen demand was met by an increase in heart rate and arteriovenous extraction.

Indeed, the two P. orientalis ecotypes displayed physiological, structural and functional differences already under control (unstressed) conditions. Adaptation to a dry environment stimulated constitutive isoprene emission, determined active stomatal behavior, and modified chloroplast ultrastructure, ultimately allowing more effective use of absorbed light energy for photochemistry. When exposed to short-term acute drought stress, IT plants showed active stomatal control that enhanced instantaneous water use efficiency, and stimulation of isoprene emission that sustained photochemistry and reduced oxidative damages to membranes, as compared to BG plants. None of the P. orientalis ecotypes recovered completely from drought stress after re-watering, confirming the sensitivity of this mesophyte to drought. Nevertheless, the IT ecotype showed less damage and better stability at the level of chloroplast membrane parameters when compared to the BG ecotype, which we interpret as possible adaptation to hostile environments and improved capacity to cope with future, likely more recurrent, drought stress.",2018,10.1093/conphys/coy073,6,NA,NA,coy073,NA

This species is composed of two genetically distinct populations, which, according to field observations and otolith strontium signatures, show largely allopatric distribution patterns as recently hatched juveniles. Juvenile Central Valley splittail are found primarily in the nearly fresh waters of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers and their tributaries, whereas San Pablo juveniles are found in the typically higher-salinity waters (i.e. up to 10\%) of the Napa and Petaluma Rivers. As the large salinity differences between young-of-year habitats may indicate population-specific differences in salinity tolerance, we hypothesized that juvenile San Pablo and Central Valley splittail populations differ in their response to salinity. In hatchery-born and wild-caught juvenile San Pablo splittail, we found upper salinity tolerances, where mortalities occurred within 336 h of exposure to 16\% or higher, which was higher than the upper salinity tolerance of 14\% for wild-caught juvenile Central Valley splittail. This, in conjunction with slower recovery of plasma osmolality, but not ion levels, muscle moisture or gill Na+, K+-ATPase activity, in Central Valley relative to San Pablo splittail during osmoregulatory disturbance provides some support for our hypothesis of inter-population variation in salinity tolerance and osmoregulation. The modestly improved salinity tolerance of San Pablo splittail is consistent with its use of higher-salinity habitats.

The Alberta population of westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi) is listed as `Threatened' under the Canadian Species at Risk Act. The major threats to the species are the alteration in habitat and water flow, competition and hybridization with non-native trout species and climate change. Here, we conducted (i) intermittent-flow respirometry experiments with adult native westslope cutthroat trout and non-native rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and (ii) critical thermal maximum experiments (CTmax) with adult westslope cutthroat trout to obtain valuable input data for species distribution models. For both species, standard metabolic rate (SMR) was lower at 10 degrees C compared to 15 degrees C and westslope cutthroat trout had higher SMR than rainbow trout. Although there were inter-specific differences in SMR, forced aerobic scope (using a standardized chase protocol) was different at 10 degrees C, but no significant differences were observed at 15 degrees C because of relative smaller differences in maximum metabolic rate between the species.

Consequently, researchers have adopted portable clinical analysers that were developed for the analysis of human blood characteristics, but often without thoroughly validating these systems for their use on fish. The aim of our study was to test the suitability of the i-STAT system, the most commonly used portable clinical analyser in studies on fish, for analysing blood gases and acid-base status in elasmobranchs, over a broad range of conditions and using the sandbar shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus) as a model organism. Our results indicate that the i-STAT system can generate useful measurements of whole blood pH, and the use of appropriate correction factors may increase the accuracy of results. The i-STAT system was, however, unable to generate reliable results for measurements of partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) and the derived parameter of haemoglobin O-2 saturation. This is probably due to the effect of a closed-system temperature change on PO2 within the i-STAT cartridge and the fact that the temperature correction algorithms used by i-STAT assume a human temperature dependency of haemoglobin-O-2 binding; in many ectotherms, this assumption will lead to equivocal i-STAT PO2 results. The in vivo partial pressure of CO2 (PCO2) in resting sandbar sharks is probably below the detection limit for PCO2 in the i-STAT system, and the measurement of higher PCO2 tensions was associated with a large measurement error.

Climate change is forecasted to increase San Francisco Estuary water temperature and salinity; therefore, understanding the influences of ontogeny and phenotypic plasticity on tolerance to these critical environmental parameters is particularly important for Delta Smelt and other San Francisco Estuary fishes. We assessed thermal and salinity limits in several ontogenetic stages and acclimation states of Delta Smelt, and paired these data with environmental data to evaluate sensitivity to climate-change stressors. Thermal tolerance decreased among successive stages, with larval fish exhibiting the highest tolerance and post-spawning adults having the lowest. Delta Smelt had limited capacity to increase tolerance through thermal acclimation, and comparisons with field temperature data revealed that juvenile tolerance limits are the closest to current environmental conditions, which may make this stage especially susceptible to future climate warming. Maximal water temperatures observed in situ exceeded tolerance limits of juveniles and adults. Although these temperature events are currently rare, if they increase in frequency as predicted, it could result in habitat loss at these locations despite other favourable conditions for Delta Smelt. In contrast, Delta Smelt tolerated salinities -spanning the range of expected environmental conditions for each ontogenetic stage, but salinity did impact survival in juvenile and adult stages in exposures over acute time scales. Our results underscore the importance of considering ontogeny and phenotypic plasticity in assessing the impacts of climate change, particularly for species adapted to spatially and -temporally heterogeneous environments.",2014,10.1093/conphys/cou008,2,1,NA,cou008,Conservation management; estuarine fishes; salinity tolerance; thermal tolerance
article,"Interactive effects of sedimentary turbidity and elevated water temperature on the Pugnose Shiner (<i>Miniellus anogenus</i>), a threatened freshwater fish","Fortin-Hamel, Liana and Chapman, Lauren J.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"High turbidity and elevated water temperature are environmental stressors that can co-occur in freshwater ecosystems such as when deforestation increases solar radiation and sedimentary runoff. However, we have limited knowledge about their combined impacts on fish behaviour and physiology. We explored independent and interactive effects of sedimentary turbidity and temperature on the swimming activity and both thermal and hypoxia tolerance of the Pugnose Shiner (Miniellus anogenus, formerly Notropis anogenus), a small leuciscid fish listed as Threatened under Canada's Species at Risk Act (SARA). Fish underwent a 15-week acclimation to two temperatures (16 degrees C or 25 degrees C) crossed with two turbidities (similar to 0 NTU or 8.5 NTU). Swimming activity was measured during the first 8 weeks of acclimation. Fish in warm water were more active compared to those in cold water, but turbidity had no effect on activity. Behavioural response to hypoxia was measured after 12 weeks of acclimation, as the oxygen level at which fish used aquatic surface respiration (ASR). Fish in warm water engaged in ASR behaviour at higher oxygen thresholds, indicating less tolerance to hypoxia. Turbidity had no effect on ASR thresholds. Finally, thermal tolerance was measured as the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) after 13-15 weeks of acclimation. Acclimation to warm water increased fish CTmax and T-ag (agitation temperature) but reduced the agitation window (degrees C difference between T-ag and CTmax) and thermal safety margin (degrees C difference between the acclimation temperature and CTmax). Furthermore, fish in warm, turbid water had a lower CTmax and smaller thermal safety margin than fish in warm, clear water, indicating an interaction between turbidity and temperature. This reduced thermal tolerance observed in Pugnose Shiner in warm, turbid water highlights the importance of quantifying independent and interactive effects of multiple stressors when evaluating habitat suitability and conservation strategies for imperilled species.",2024,10.1093/conphys/coae053,12,1,NA,coae053,fish behaviour; fish physiology; fish swimming activity; hypoxia tolerance; imperilled fish; thermal tolerance

Currently, there is little literature surrounding the husbandry protocols required during these programs to optimize post-release outcomes. To assess the impact of varied feeding regimes on exercise performance, (which will hereafter be referred to as `fitness'), 40 10-month-old captive post-hatchling green turtles (Cheloniamydas) were divided into four groups of 10 and fasted for either 3, 9, 10 or 15 h. The animals were then subjected to a fitness test via repetitive use of the `righting reflex' on land. Health assessments were conducted prior to the fitness test, including; heart rate, haematocrit (Hct), heterophil to lymphocyte ratio and the measurement of 11 biochemical analytes, including pH, partial pressures of carbon dioxide (PvCO2) and oxygen (PvO2), lactate, bicarbonate (HCO3-), sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-), ionized calcium (iCa2+), glucose and urea. Results were corrected for multiple comparisons and significant differences among groups were demonstrated for temperature, pH, HCO3-, iCa(2+), urea and lactate. To investigate physiological relationships between analytes, correlation coefficients were calculated between fitness and glucose, fitness and lactate, glucose and lactate, pH and iCa(2+), pH and K+, pH and PvCO2, pH and HCO3- and Hct and K+. Following correction for multiple comparisons, significant relationshipswere seen between pH and iCa(2+) and pH and HCO3-. Post-hatchling turtles appear to enter a catabolic state when exposed to short-term fasting. While this did not have a direct impact on fitness, the production of an intense energetic output from a catabolic state may induce a physiological debt. This study suggests that handling that induces a physical response should be minimized and animals should be fed within 10 h of release.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz016,7,NA,NA,coz016,Catabolic; fasting; fitness; post-hatchling; release
article,Behavioural and physiological responses to salinization and air exposure during the ontogeny of a freshwater South American snail,"Barrios-Figueroa, R. and Urbina, M. A.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Salinization is of global concern, threatening freshwater biodiversity. Salinity tolerance is highly variable and therefore needs to be evaluated on a species-specific basis. An estuarine population of Chilina dombeiana, a freshwater gastropod endemic to Chile and classified as vulnerable, has been recently found in the Biobio River's mouth, suggesting some degree of tolerance to brackish waters. This study evaluated the survival, behaviour (medium preference) and physiology of C. dombeiana when exposed to salinities higher than freshwater, thus elucidating the potential mechanisms used to survive salinization. Chilina dombeiana belongs to the Pulmonate group;, so we evaluated oxygen uptake in air and water, aiming to evaluate emersion as a potential avoidance response to a progressive salinity increase. Complete embryo development was observed for salinities <= 16 PSU (practical salinity units) but hatching rates above 50\% were only achieved in freshwater (0 PSU). It was also found that salinity had stage-specific effects during embryonic development. In adults, acute exposure to brackish water (12 PSU) caused a decrease in oxygen consumption (compared to freshwater), in the ammonium excretion rates and in the percentage of muscular water content. Although C. dombeiana was able to take up oxygen in both mediums, survival in air decreased over time (days), which correlates with the behavioural preference to remain submerged, even at elevated salinities. Considering the survival of adults and embryos decreased as salinity increased and the lack of an avoidance behaviour or a physiological ability to maintain homeostasis at salinities higher than freshwater, our results suggest this snail could be adversely affected by salinization in the long term. Furthermore, given the ability of C. dombeiana to uptake oxygen in both mediums, it should be considered as a facultative air breather snail, rather than a strictly aquatic species.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coac089,11,1,NA,coac089,salinization; salinity tolerance; molluscs; freshwater snail; Estuaries
article,Variation in spawning time promotes genetic variability in population responses to environmental change in a marine fish,"Oomen, Rebekah A. and Hutchings, Jeffrey A.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"The level of phenotypic plasticity displayed within a population (i.e. the slope of the reaction norm) reflects the short-term response of a population to environmental change, while variation in reaction norm slopes among populations reflects spatial variation in these responses. Thus far, studies of thermal reaction norm variation have focused on geographically driven adaptation among different latitudes, altitudes or habitats. Yet, thermal variability is a function of both space and time. For organisms that reproduce at different times of year, such variation has the potential to promote adaptive variability in thermal responses for critical early life stages. Using common-garden experiments, we examined the spatial scale of genetic variation in thermal plasticity for early life-history traits among five populations of endangered Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) that spawn at different times of year. Patterns of plasticity for larval growth and survival suggest that population responses to climate change will differ substantially, with increasing water temperatures posing a considerably greater threat to autumn-spawning cod than to those that spawn in winter or spring. Adaptation to seasonal cooling or warming experienced during the larval stage is suggested as a possible cause. Furthermore, populations that experience relatively cold temperatures during early life might be more sensitive to changes in temperature. Substantial divergence in adaptive traits was evident at a smaller spatial scale than has previously been shown for a marine fish with no apparent physical barriers to gene flow (similar to 200 km). Our findings highlight the need to consider the impact of intraspecific variation in reproductive timing on thermal adaptation when forecasting the effects of climate change on animal populations.",2015,10.1093/conphys/cov027,3,NA,NA,cov027,Atlantic cod; climate change; common-garden experiment; Gadus morhua; genotype-by-environment interaction; thermal adaptation

We quantified the risks of lethal hyperthermia and dehydration for 10 Australian aridzone avifauna species during the 21st century, by synthesizing thermal physiology data on evaporative water losses and heat tolerance limits. We evaluated risks of lethal hyperthermia or exceedance of dehydration tolerance limits in the absence of drinking during the hottest part of the day under recent climatic conditions, compared to those predicted for the end of this century across Australia. Increases in mortality risk via lethal dehydration and hyperthermia vary among the species modelled here but will generally increase greatly, particularly in smaller species (similar to 10-42 g) and those inhabiting the far western parts of the continent. By 2100 CE, zebra finches' potential exposure to acute lethal dehydration risk will reach similar to 100 d y(-1) in the far northwest of Australia and will exceed 20 d y(-1) over > 50\% of this species' current range. Risks of dehydration and hyperthermia will remain much lower for large non-passerines such as crested pigeons. Risks of lethal hyperthermia will also increase substantially for smaller species, particularly if they are forced to visit exposed water sources at very high air temperatures to avoid dehydration. An analysis of atlas data for zebra finches suggests that population declines associated with very hot conditions are already occurring in the hottest areas. Our findings suggest that the likelihood of persistence within current species ranges, and the potential for range shifts, will become increasingly constrained by temperature and access to drinking water. Our model adds to an increasing body of literature suggesting that arid environments globally will experience considerable losses of avifauna and biodiversity under unmitigated climate change scenarios.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa048,8,NA,NA,coaa048,Avian mortality; dehydration; desert; heat waves; hyperthermia; population declines
article,Integrating earthworm movement and life history through dynamic energy budgets,"Gergs, Andre and Rakel, Kim and Bussen, Dino and Capowiez, Yvan and Ernst, Gregor and Roeben, Vanessa",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Earthworms are an important part of the soil ecosystem. For conservation of those ecosystems and management of human activities it is important to understand how earthworms move, grow and reproduce under different environmental conditions. We have developed a simulation model that allows to predict earthworm performance under environmental change. Earthworms are considered ecosystem engineers and, as such, they are an integral part of the soil ecosystem. The movement of earthworms is significantly influenced by environmental factors such as temperature and soil properties. As movement may directly be linked to food ingestion, especially of endogeic species like Aporrectodea caliginosa, changes in those environmental factors also affect life history traits such as growth and reproduction. In our laboratory studies, earthworms showed a decrease in burrowing activity with decreasing moisture levels and, to some extent, the organic matter content. The burrowing activity of earthworms was also affected by temperature, for which the casts produced per earthworm was used as a proxy in laboratory experiments. We integrated changes in earthworm movement and life histories in response to temperature, soil organic matter content and the moisture level, as observed in our experiment and reported in the literature, through dynamic energy budget (DEB) modelling. The joint parametrization of a DEB model for A. caliginosa based on movement and life history data revealed that food ingestion via movement is an integral part of the earthworms' energy budgets. Our findings highlight the importance of soil properties to be considered in the model development for earthworms. Furthermore, by understanding and incorporating the effect of environmental factors on the physiology, this mechanistic approach can help assess the impact of environmental changes such as temperature rise or drought.",2022,10.1093/conphys/coac042,10,1,NA,coac042,temperature; soil moisture; organic matter; reproduction; growth; Aporrectodea caliginosa

We hypothesized that Cathaya showed eco-physiological outliers to its Pinaceae relatives, which lead to its current endangered status. Here we collected the photosynthetic capacity (Pn, maximum photosynthesis rate) and branchlet hydraulic safety (P50, the water potential at which a 50\% loss in conductivity occurs) of Pinaceae species globally, including our measurements on Cathaya. We applied the phylogenetic comparative methods to investigate: (i) the phylogenetic signal of the two key traits across Pinaceae species, and (ii) the trait-climate relationships and the photosynthesis-cavitation resistance relationship across Pinaceae species. We applied the polygenetic quantile regression (PQR) method to assess whether Cathaya showed eco-physiological outliers to its Pinaceae relatives in terms of cavitation resistance and photosynthetic capacity. It was found that P50, and to a less extent, Pn, had a strong phylogenetic signal consistent with niche conservation among Pinaceae species. Hydraulic safety largely determined non-threatened Pinaceae species' distribution across moisture gradients at the global scale. There was also an adaptive trade-off relationship between Pn and P50. Cathaya is a high cavitation resistant, low photosynthetic capacity species. It showed eco-physiological outliers to its Pinaceae relatives because it had lower P50 and Pn below the 10\% quantile boundaries along moisture and/or temperature gradients; also, it was above the 90\% quantile boundary of the Pn and P50 relationship across non-endangered Pinaceae species. The PQR output demonstrated that in the subtropical area of China characterized by abundant rainfall, Cathaya has extra high hydraulic safety, suggesting inefficiency of carbon economy associated with either competition or other life history strategies, which lead to its current endangered status.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa094,8,1,NA,coaa094,Hydraulic safety; photosynthetic capacity; phylogenetic signal; species' distribution; polygenetic quantile regression

Recently, increased water demand and siltation have threatened the viable hot springs near the margins of the lake where Alcolapia grahami, the only fish surviving in the lake, live. These Lake Magadi tilapia largely depend on nitrogen-rich cyanobacteria for food and are 100\% ureotelic. Their exceptionally high aerobic metabolic rate, together with their emaciated appearance, suggests that they are energy-limited. Therefore, we hypothesized that during food deprivation, Magadi tilapia would economize their energy expenditure and reduce metabolic rate, aerobic performance and urea-N excretion. Surprisingly, during a 5-day fasting period, routine metabolic rates increased and swimming performance (critical swimming speed) was not affected. Urea-N excretion remained stable despite the lack of their N-rich food source. Their nitrogen use switched to endogenous sources as liver and muscle protein levels decreased after a 5-day fast, indicating proteolysis. Additionally, fish relied on carbohydrates with lowered muscle glycogen levels, but there were no signs indicating use of lipid stores. Gene expression of gill and gut urea transporters were transiently reduced as were gill rhesus glycoprotein Rhbg and Rhcg-2. The reduction in gill glutamine synthetase expression concomitant with the reduction in Rh glycoprotein gene expression indicates reduced nitrogen/ammonia metabolism, most likely decreased protein synthesis. Additionally, fish showed reduced plasma total CO2, osmolality and Na+ (but not Cl-) levels, possibly related to reduced drinking rates and metabolic acidosis. Our work shows that Lake Magadi tilapia have the capacity to survive short periods of starvation which could occur when siltation linked to flash floods covers their main food source, but their seemingly hardwired high metabolic rates would compromise long-term survival.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz060,7,NA,NA,coz060,Alkaline soda lake; starvation; metabolism; respiration; nitrogen; urea-N
article,Ocean acidification exerts negative effects during warming conditions in a developing Antarctic fish,"Flynn, Erin E. and Bjelde, Brittany E. and Miller, Nathan A. and Todgham, Anne E.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Anthropogenic CO2 is rapidly causing oceans to become warmer and more acidic, challenging marine ectotherms to respond to simultaneous changes in their environment. While recent work has highlighted that marine fishes, particularly during early development, can be vulnerable to ocean acidification, we lack an understanding of how life-history strategies, ecosystems and concurrent ocean warming interplay with interspecific susceptibility. To address the effects of multiple ocean changes on cold-adapted, slowly developing fishes, we investigated the interactive effects of elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) and temperature on the embryonic physiology of an Antarctic dragonfish (Gymnodraco acuticeps), with protracted embryogenesis (similar to 10 months). Using an integrative, experimental approach, our research examined the impacts of near-future warming {[}-1 (ambient) and 2 degrees C (+3 degrees C)] and ocean acidification {[}420 (ambient), 650 (moderate) and 1000 mu atm pCO(2) (high)] on survival, development and metabolic processes over the course of 3 weeks in early development. In the presence of increased pCO(2) alone, embryonic mortality did not increase, with greatest overall survival at the highest pCO(2). Furthermore, embryos were significantly more likely to be at a later developmental stage at high pCO(2) by 3 weeks relative to ambient pCO(2). However, in combined warming and ocean acidification scenarios, dragonfish embryos experienced a dose-dependent, synergistic decrease in survival and developed more slowly. We also found significant interactions between temperature, pCO(2) and time in aerobic enzyme activity (citrate synthase). Increased temperature alone increased whole-organism metabolic rate (O-2 consumption) and developmental rate and slightly decreased osmolality at the cost of increased mortality. Our findings suggest that developing dragonfish are more sensitive to ocean warming and may experience negative physiological effects of ocean acidification only in the presence of an increased temperature. In addition to reduced hatching success, alterations in development and metabolism due to ocean warming and acidification could have negative ecological consequences owing to changes in phenology (i.e. early hatching) in the highly seasonal Antarctic ecosystem.",2015,10.1093/conphys/cov033,3,NA,NA,cov033,Early development; global climate change; Gymnodraco acuticeps; physiological performance; polar fishes
article,Metabolic traits in brown trout (<i>Salmo trutta</i>) vary in response to food restriction and intrinsic factors,"Archer, Louise C. and Hutton, Stephen A. and Harman, Luke and Poole, W. Russell and Gargan, Patrick and Mcginnity, Philip and Reed, Thomas E.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Metabolism (rate of energy use) often varies considerably within species and populations. We found that food restriction (a potential outcome of environmental change) reduced baseline metabolism in brown trout, but traits also varied by sex and population factors. Understanding metabolic responses will help to predict/manage effects of global change. Metabolic rates vary hugely within and between populations, yet we know relatively little about factors causing intraspecific variation. Since metabolic rate determines the energetic cost of life, uncovering these sources of variation is important to understand and forecast responses to environmental change. Moreover, few studies have examined factors causing intraspecific variation in metabolic flexibility. We explore how extrinsic environmental conditions and intrinsic factors contribute to variation in metabolic traits in brown trout, an iconic and polymorphic species that is threatened across much of its native range. We measured metabolic traits in offspring from two wild populations that naturally show life-history variation in migratory tactics (one anadromous, i.e. sea-migratory, one non-anadromous) that we reared under either optimal food or experimental conditions of long-term food restriction (lasting between 7 and 17 months). Both populations showed decreased standard metabolic rates (SMR-baseline energy requirements) under low food conditions. The anadromous population had higher maximum metabolic rate (MMR) than the non-anadromous population, and marginally higher SMR. The MMR difference was greater than SMR and consequently aerobic scope (AS) was higher in the anadromous population. MMR and AS were both higher in males than females. The anadromous population also had higher AS under low food compared to optimal food conditions, consistent with population-specific effects of food restriction on AS. Our results suggest different components of metabolic rate can vary in their response to environmental conditions, and according to intrinsic (population-background/sex) effects. Populations might further differ in their flexibility of metabolic traits, potentially due to intrinsic factors related to life history (e.g. migratory tactics). More comparisons of populations/individuals with divergent life histories will help to reveal this. Overall, our study suggests that incorporating an understanding of metabolic trait variation and flexibility and linking this to life history and demography will improve our ability to conserve populations experiencing global change.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa096,8,1,NA,coaa096,anadromy; climate change; metabolism; partial migration; phenotypic flexibility; plasticity
article,The role of thermal physiology in recent declines of birds in a biodiversity hotspot,"Milne, Robyn and Cunningham, Susan J. and Lee, Alan T. K. and Smit, Ben",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"We investigated whether observed avian range contractions and population declines in the Fynbos biome of South Africa were mechanistically linked to recent climate warming. We aimed to determine whether there were correlations between preferred temperature envelope, or changes in temperature within species' ranges, and recent changes in range and population size, for 12 Fynbos-resident bird species, including six that are endemic to the biome. We then measured the physiological responses of each species at air temperatures ranging from 24 to 42 degrees C to determine whether physiological thermal thresholds could provide a mechanistic explanation for observed population trends. Our data show that Fynbos-endemic species occupying the coolest regions experienced the greatest recent reductions in range and population size (> 30\% range reduction between 1991 and the present). In addition, species experiencing the largest increases in air temperature within their ranges showed the greatest declines. However, evidence for a physiological mechanistic link between warming and population declines was equivocal, with only the larger species showing low thermal thresholds for their body mass, compared with other birds globally. In addition, some species appear more vulnerable than others to air temperatures in their ranges above physiological thermal thresholds. Of these, the high-altitude specialist Cape rockjumper (Chaetops frenatus) seems most at risk from climate warming. This species showed: (i) the lowest threshold for increasing evaporative water loss at high temperatures; and (ii) population declines specifically in those regions of its range recording significant warming trends. Our findings suggest that caution must be taken when attributing causality explicitly to thermal stress, even when population trends are clearly correlated with rates of warming.

The thermoregulatory demands resulting from hotter weather can have catastrophic impacts on animals, leading to mass mortalities. Although less dramatic, animals also experience physiological costs below, but approaching, critical temperature thresholds. These costs may be particularly constraining during reproduction, when parents must balance thermoregulation against breeding activities. Such challenges should be acute among seabirds, which often nest in locations exposed to high solar radiation and predation risk. The globally endangered bank cormorant Phalacrocorax neglectus breeds in southern Africa in the winter, giving little scope for poleward or phenological shifts in the face of increasing temperatures. Physiological studies of endangered species sensitive to human disturbance, like the bank cormorant, are challenging, because individuals cannot be captured for experimental research. Using a novel, non-invasive, videographic approach, we investigated the thermoregulatory responses of this seabird across a range of environmental temperatures at three nesting colonies. The time birds spent gular fluttering, a behaviour enhancing evaporative heat loss, increased with temperature. Crouching or standing birds spent considerably less time gular fluttering than birds sitting on nests (ca 30\% less at 22 degrees C), showing that postural adjustments mediate exposure to heat stress and enhance water conservation. Crouching or standing, however, increases the vulnerability of eggs and chicks to suboptimal temperatures and/or expose nest contents to predation, suggesting that parents may trade-off thermoregulatory demands against offspring survival. We modelled thermoregulatory responses under future climate scenarios and found that nest-bound bank cormorants will gular flutter almost continuously for several hours a day by 2100. The associated increase in water loss may lead to dehydration, forcing birds to prioritize survival over breeding, a trade-off that would ultimately deteriorate the conservation status of this species.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coz109,8,NA,NA,coz109,Breeding; dehydration; evaporative cooling; heat stress physiology; thermoregulation; videography

Here we present experiments that comprehensively examined how the ocean's past, present and projected (21st and 22nd centuries) CO2 concentrations impact the growth and physiology of larval stages of C. virginica. Crassostrea virginica larvae grown in present-day pCO(2) concentrations (380 MU atm) displayed higher growth and survival than individuals grown at both lower (250 mu atm) and higher pCO(2) levels (750 and 1500 mu atm). Crassostrea virginica larvae manifested calcification rates, sizes, shell thicknesses, metamorphosis, RNA: DNA ratios and lipid contents that paralleled trends in survival, with maximal values for larvae grown at 380 mu atm pCO(2) and reduced performance in higher and lower pCO(2) levels. While some physiological differences among oysters could be attributed to CO2-induced changes in size or calcification rates, the RNA: DNA ratios at ambient pCO(2) levels were elevated, independent of these factors. Likewise, the lipid contents of individuals exposed to high pCO(2) levels were depressed even when differences in calcification rates were considered. These findings reveal the cascading, interdependent impact that high CO2 can have on oyster physiology. Crassostrea virginica larvae are significantly more resistant to elevated pCO(2) than other North Atlantic bivalves, such as Mercenaria mercenaria and Argopecten irradians, a finding that may be related to the biogeography and/or evolutionary history of these species and may have important implications for future bivalve restoration and aquaculture efforts.",2014,10.1093/conphys/cou004,2,1,NA,cou004,Bivalve; ocean acidification; oyster; restoration
article,Habitat complexity influences selection of thermal environment in a common coral reef fish,"Nay, Tiffany J. and Johansen, Jacob L. and Rummer, Jodie L. and Steffensen, John F. and Pratchett, Morgan S. and Hoey, Andrew S.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Coral reef species, like most tropical species, are sensitive to increasing environmental temperatures, with many species already living close to their thermal maxima. Ocean warming and the increasing frequency and intensity of marine heatwaves are challenging the persistence of reef-associated species through both direct physiological effects of elevated water temperatures and the degradation and loss of habitat structure following disturbance. Understanding the relative importance of habitat degradation and ocean warming in shaping species distributions is critical in predicting the likely biological effects of global warming. Using an automated shuttle box system, we investigated how habitat complexity influences the selection of thermal environments for a common coral reef damselfish, Chromis atripectoralis. In the absence of any habitat (i.e. control), C. atripectoralis avoided temperatures below 22.9 +/- 0.8 degrees C and above 31.9 +/- 0.6 degrees C, with a preferred temperature (T-pref) of 28.1 +/- 0.9 degrees C. When complex habitat was available, individual C. atripectoralis occupied temperatures down to 4.3 degrees C lower (mean +/- SE; threshold: 18.6 +/- 0.7 degrees C; T-pref: 18.9 +/- 1.0 degrees C) than control fish. Conversely, C. atripectoralis in complex habitats occupied similar upper temperatures as control fish (threshold: 31.7 +/- 0.4 degrees C; preference: 28.3 +/- 0.7 degrees C). Our results show that the availability of complex habitat can influence the selection of thermal environment by a coral reef fish, but only at temperatures below their thermal preference. The limited scope of C. atripectoralis to occupy warmer environments, even when associated with complex habitat, suggests that habitat restoration efforts in areas that continue to warm may not be effective in retaining populations of C. atripectoralis and similar species. This species may have to move to cooler (e.g. deeper or higher latitude) habitats under predicted future warming.

article,Expression of genes involved in brain GABAergic neurotransmission in three-spined stickleback exposed to near-future CO<sub>2</sub>,"Lai, Floriana and Fagernes, Cathrine E. and Jutfelt, Fredrik and Nilsson, Goran E.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Change in the activity of the main inhibitory receptor, GABA(A), has been suggested to be a general mechanism behind the behavioural alterations reported in ocean acidification studies on fish. It has been proposed that regulatory acid-base mechanisms in response to high CO2 alter the neuronal Cl- and HCO3- gradients that are important for GABAA receptor function. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of gene expression of GABAA receptor subunits and of genes involved in GABAergic transmission in the brain of fish exposed to near-future CO2. Altogether, 56 mRNA transcripts were quantified in brains of three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) kept in control pCO(2) (333 +/- 30 mu atm CO2) or at high pCO(2) levels (991 +/- 57 mu atm) for 43 days. The gene expression analysis included GABAA receptor subunits (alpha 1-6, beta 1-3,gamma 1-3, delta, pi and rho 1-3), enzymes and transporters involved in GABA metabolism (GAD1-2, GABAT and GAT1-3), GABAA receptor-associated proteins (GABARAP and GABARAPL), ion cotransporters (KCC1-4, NKCC1, ClC21-3, AE3 and NDAE) and carbonic anhydrase (CAII). Exposure to high CO2 had only minor effects on the expression of genes involved in GABAergic neuro-transmission. There were significant increases in the mRNA levels of a family subunits of the GABAA receptor, with a more pronounced expression of alpha 1(2), alpha 3, alpha 4 and alpha 6b. No changes were detected in the expression of other GABAA subunits or in genes related to receptor turnover, GABA metabolism or ion transport. Although the minor changes seen for mRNA levels might reflect compensatory mechanisms in the high-CO2 conditions, these were apparently insufficient to restore normal neural function, because the behavioural changes persisted within the time frame studied.",2016,10.1093/conphys/cow068,4,NA,NA,cow068,GABA(A) receptor; GABAergic system; ion cotranporters; ocean acidification; quantitative polymerase chain reaction; three-spined stickleback

We hypothesized that Cathaya showed eco-physiological outliers to its Pinaceae relatives, which lead to its current endangered status. Here we collected the photosynthetic capacity (P-n, maximum photosynthesis rate) and branchlet hydraulic safety (P-50, the water potential at which a 50\% loss in conductivity occurs) of Pinaceae species globally, including our measurements on Cathaya. We applied the phylogenetic comparative methods to investigate: (i) the phylogenetic signal of the two key traits across Pinaceae species, and (ii) the trait-climate relationships and the photosynthesis-cavitation resistance relationship across Pinaceae species. We applied the polygenetic quantile regression (PQR) method to assess whether Cathaya showed eco-physiological outliers to its Pinaceae relatives in terms of cavitation resistance and photosynthetic capacity. It was found that P-50, and to a less extent, P-n, had a strong phylogenetic signal consistent with niche conservation among Pinaceae species. Hydraulic safety largely determined non-threatened Pinaceae species' distribution across moisture gradients at the global scale. There was also an adaptive trade-off relationship between P-n and P-50. Cathaya is a high cavitation resistant, low photosynthetic capacity species. It showed eco-physiological outliers to its Pinaceae relatives because it had lower P-50 and P-n below the 10\% quantile boundaries along moisture and/or temperature gradients; also, it was above the 90\% quantile boundary of the P-n and P-50 relationship across non-endangered Pinaceae species. The PQR output demonstrated that in the subtropical area of China characterized by abundant rainfall, Cathaya has extra high hydraulic safety, suggesting inefficiency of carbon economy associated with either competition or other life history strategies, which lead to its current endangered status.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa094,8,NA,NA,coaa094,Hydraulic safety; photosynthetic capacity; phylogenetic signal; species' distribution; polygenetic quantile regression
article,Seawater acclimation affects cardiac output and adrenergic control of blood pressure in rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>)-implications for salinity variations now and in the future,"Sundell, Erika and Morgenroth, Daniel and Brijs, Jeroen and Ekstrom, Andreas and Grans, Albin and Sandblom, Erik",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Greater salinity variations resulting from ongoing climate change requires consideration in conservation management as this may impact on the performance of aquatic organisms. Euryhaline fish exhibit osmoregulatory flexibility and can exploit a wide range of salinities. In seawater (SW), they drink and absorb water in the intestine, which is associated with increased gastrointestinal blood flow. Yet, detailed information on other cardiovascular changes and their control across salinities is scant. Such knowledge is fundamental to understand how fish are affected during migrations between environments with different salinities, as well as by increased future salinity variability. We used rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) as a euryhaline model species and determined dorsal aortic blood pressure, cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance in vivo after chronic freshwater-or SW-acclimation. We also assessed a-adrenergic control of blood pressure using pharmacological tools. Dorsal aortic blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance were reduced, whereas cardiac output increased in SW. alpha-Adrenergic stimulation with phenylephrine caused similar dose-dependent increases in resistance and pressure across salinities, indicating unaltered alpha-adrenoceptor sensitivity. alpha-Adrenergic blockade with prazosin decreased resistance and pressure across salinities, but the absolute reduction in resistance was smaller in SW. Yet, both pressure and resistance after prazosin remained consistently lower in SW. This shows that SW-acclimation lowers systemic resistance through reduced vascular a-adrenergic tone, along with other unknown vasodilating factors. The marked changes in adrenergic regulation of the vasculature across salinities discovered here may have implications for cardiovascular and aerobic performance of fishes, with possible impacts on fitness-related traits like digestion and exercise capacity. Moreover, the evolution of more complex circulatory control systems in teleost fishes compared with elasmobranchs and cyclostomes may have been an important factor in the evolution of euryhalinity, and may provide euryhaline teleosts with competitive advantages in more variable salinity environments of the future.",2018,10.1093/conphys/coy061,6,NA,NA,coy061,alpha-Adrenergic; arterial blood pressure; vascular resistance; water salinity; euryhalinity; climate change

Oil and gas development is associated with production of high volumes of hypersaline water. With planned industrial expansion into northern areas of Canada and the USA that directly overlap grayling habitat, the threat of accidental saline water release poses a significant risk. Despite this, we understand little about the responses of grayling to hypersaline waters. We compared the physiological responses and survivability of Arctic grayling and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to tolerate an acute transfer to higher saline waters. Arctic grayling and rainbow trout were placed directly into 17 ppt salinity and sampled at 24 and 96 h along with control animals in freshwater at 24 h. Serum sodium, chloride and osmolality levels increased significantly in grayling at both 24 and 96 h time points, whereas trout were able to compensate for the osmoregulatory disturbance by 96 h. Sodium-potassium ATPase mRNA expression responses to salinity were also compared, demonstrating the inability of the grayling to up-regulate the seawater isoform nka alpha 1b. Our results demonstrated a substantially lower salinity tolerance in grayling. We also found a significant salinity-induced morphological gill remodelling by Arctic grayling, as demonstrated by the rapid growth of an interlamellar cell mass by 24 h that persisted at 96 h. We visualized and quantified the appearance of the interlamellar cell mass as a response to high salinity, although the functional significance remains to be understood fully. Compared with rainbow trout, which are used as an environmental regulatory species, Arctic grayling are unable to compensate for the osmotic stressors that would result from a highly saline produced water spill. Given these new data, collaboration between fisheries and the oil and gas industry will be vital in the long-term conservation strategies with regard to the Arctic grayling in their native habitat.",2016,10.1093/conphys/cow010,4,NA,NA,cow010,Gill plasticity; osmoregulation; salinity; sodium-potassium ATPase; Thymallus arcticus
article,Evaluating corticosterone as a biomarker for amphibians exposed to increased salinity and ambient corticosterone,"Tornabene, Brian J. and Hossack, Blake R. and Crespi, Erica J. and Breuner, Creagh W.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Physiological biomarkers are commonly used to assess the health of taxa exposed to natural and anthropogenic stressors. Glucocorticoid (GC) hormones are often used as indicators of physiological stress in wildlife because they affect growth, reproduction and survival. Increased salinity fromhuman activities negatively influences amphibians and their corticosterone (CORT; the main amphibian GC) physiology; therefore, CORT could be a useful biomarker. We evaluated whether waterborne CORT could serve as a biomarker of salt stress for three free-living amphibian species that vary in their sensitivity to salinity: boreal chorus frogs (Pseudacris maculata), northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens) and barred tiger salamanders (Ambystoma mavortium). Across a gradient of contamination from energy-related saline wastewaters, we tested the effects of salinity on baseline and stress-induced waterborne CORT of larvae. Stress-induced, but not baseline, CORT of leopard frogs increased with increasing salinity. Salinitywas not associated with baseline or stress-induced CORT of chorus frogs or tiger salamanders. Associations between CORT and salinitywere also not related to species-specific sensitivities to salinity. However, we detected background environmental CORT (ambient CORT) in all wetlands and spatial variation was high within and among wetlands. Higher ambient CORT was associated with lower waterborne CORT of larvae in wetlands. Therefore, ambient CORT likely confounded associations between waterborne CORT and salinity in our analysis and possibly influenced physiology of larvae. We hypothesize that larvae may passively take up CORT from their environment and downregulate endogenous CORT. Although effects ofsomehormones (e.g. oestrogen) and endocrine disruptors on aquatic organisms arewell described, studies investigating the occurrence and effects of ambient CORT are limited. We provide suggestions to improve collection methods, reduce variability and avoid confounding effects of ambient CORT. By making changes to methodology, waterborne CORT could still be a promising, non-invasive conservation tool to evaluate effects of salinity on amphibians.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab049,9,NA,1-15,coab049,Endocrine disruption; endocrinology; frogs; salamanders; stress physiology

The increasing success of these species may be related to their higher physiological performance compared with indigenous ones. Here, we determined the effect of temperature on the aerobic metabolic scope (MS) of two herbivorous fish species that occupy a similar ecological niche in the Mediterranean Sea: the native salema (Sarpa salpa) and the invasive marbled spinefoot (Siganus rivulatus). Our results demonstrate a large difference in the optimal temperature for aerobic scope between the salema (21.8 degrees C) and the marbled spinefoot (29.1 degrees C), highlighting the importance of temperature in determining the energy availability and, potentially, the distribution patterns of the two species. A modelling approach based on a present-day projection and a future scenario for oceanographic conditions was used to make predictions about the thermal habitat suitability (THS, an index based on the relationship between MS and temperature) of the two species, both at the basin level (the whole Mediterranean Sea) and at the regional level (the Sicilian Channel, a key area for the inflow of invasive species from the Eastern to the Western Mediterranean Sea). For the present-day projection, our basin-scale model shows higher THS of the marbled spinefoot than the salema in the Eastern compared with the Western Mediterranean Sea. However, by 2050, the THS of the marbled spinefoot is predicted to increase throughout the whole Mediterranean Sea, causing its westward expansion. Nevertheless, the regional-scale model suggests that the future thermal conditions of Western Sicily will remain relatively unsuitable for the invasive species and could act as a barrier for its spread westward. We suggest that metabolic scope can be used as a tool to evaluate the potential invasiveness of alien species and the resilience to global warming of native species.",2015,10.1093/conphys/cou059,3,NA,NA,cou059,Conservation physiology; distribution modelling; fish physiology; global warming; invasive species; thermal habitat suitability

Without reliable estimates of maximum cardiac output (((Q)over dot)), it is impossible to assess their physiological scope in response to warming seas. Therefore, we compared cardiac performance of two icefish species, Chionodraco rastrospinosus (Hb(-)Mb(+)) and Chaenocephalus aceratus (Hb(-)Mb(-)), with a related notothenioid, Notothenia coriiceps (Hb(+)Mb(+)) using an in situ perfused heart preparation. The maximum (Q)over dot, heart rate (f(H)), maximum cardiac work (WC) and relative ventricular mass of N. coriiceps at 1 degrees C were comparable to temperate-water teleosts, and acute warming to 4 degrees C increased fH and WC, as expected. In contrast, icefish hearts accommodated a higher maximum stroke volume (VS) and maximum. Q at 1 degrees C, but their unusually large hearts had a lower fH and maximum afterload tolerance than N. coriiceps at 1 degrees C. Furthermore, maximum VS, maximum. Q and fH were all significantly higher for the Hb(-)Mb(+) condition compared with the Hb(-)Mb(-) condition, a potential selective advantage when coping with environmental warming. Like N. coriiceps, both icefish species increased H-f at 4 degrees C. Acutely warming C. aceratus increased maximum (Q) over dot, while C. rastrospinosus (like N. coriiceps) held at 4 degrees C for 1 week maintained maximum. Q when tested at 4 degrees C. These experiments involving short-term warming should be followed up with long-term acclimation studies, since the maximum cardiac performance of these three Antarctic species studied seem to be tolerant of temperatures in excess of predictions associated with global warming.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz049,7,NA,NA,coz049,Cardiac output; cardiac work; heart rate; icefishes; thermal adaptation; warming

U. and Rummer, Jodie L. and Morash, Andrea J. and Watson, Sue-Ann and Simpfendorfer, Colin A. and Heupel, Michelle R. and Munday, Philip L.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Ocean acidification, resulting from increasing anthropogenic CO2 emissions, is predicted to affect the physiological performance of many marine species. Recent studies have shown substantial reductions in aerobic performance in some teleost fish species, but no change or even enhanced performance in others. Notably lacking, however, are studies on the effects of near-future CO2 conditions on larger meso and apex predators, such as elasmobranchs. The epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) lives on shallow coral reef flats and in lagoons, where it may frequently encounter short-term periods of environmental hypoxia and elevated CO2, especially during nocturnal low tides. Indeed, H. ocellatum is remarkably tolerant to short periods (hours) of hypoxia, and possibly hypercapnia, but nothing is known about its response to prolonged exposure. We exposed H. ocellatum individuals to control (390 mu atm) or one of two near-future CO2 treatments (600 or 880 mu atm) for a minimum of 60 days and then measured key aspects of their respiratory physiology, namely the resting oxygen consumption rate, which is used to estimate resting metabolic rate, and critical oxygen tension, a proxy for hypoxia sensitivity. Neither of these respiratory attributes was affected by the long-term exposure to elevated CO2. Furthermore, there was no change in citrate synthase activity, a cellular indicator of aerobic energy production. Plasma bicarbonate concentrations were significantly elevated in sharks exposed to 600 and 880 mu atm CO2 treatments, indicating that acidosis was probably prevented by regulatory changes in acid-base relevant ions. Epaulette sharks may therefore possess adaptations that confer tolerance to CO2 levels projected to occur in the ocean by the end of this century. It remains uncertain whether other elasmobranchs, especially pelagic species that do not experience such diurnal fluctuations in their environment, will be equally tolerant.",2014,10.1093/conphys/cou047,2,1,NA,cou047,Climate change; ecophysiology; elasmobranch; hypoxia tolerance; ocean acidification

Increased water salinities can in turn alter the geographic distribution and ecology of freshwater species including turtles. The physiological consequences of salinization for freshwater turtles, however, are poorly known. Here, we compared the osmoregulatory response of two geographically separate populations of the freshwater Western Pond Turtle (Actinemys marmorata)-a species declining across its range in western North America-to three constant salinities: 0.4 ppt, 10 ppt and 15 ppt over 2 weeks. We found that turtles from a coastal estuarine marsh population regulated their plasma osmolality at lower levels than their conspecifics from an inland freshwater creek population 45 km away. Plasma osmolalities were consistently lower in estuarine marsh turtles than the freshwater creek turtles over the entire 2-week exposure to 10 ppt and 15 ppt water. Furthermore, estuarine marsh turtles maintained plasma osmolalities within 1 SD of their mean field osmolalities over the 2-week exposure, whereas freshwater creek turtles exceeded their field values within the first few days after exposure to elevated salinities. However, individuals from both populations exhibited body mass loss in 15 ppt water, with significantly greater loss in estuarine turtles. We speculate that the greater ability to osmoregulate by the estuarine marsh turtles may be explained by their reduced feeding and drinking in elevated salinities that was not exhibited by the freshwater creek population. However, due to mass loss in both populations, physiological and behavioural responses exhibited by estuarine marsh turtles may only be effective adaptations for short-term exposures to elevated salinities, such as those from tides and when traversing saline habitats, and are unlikely to be effective for long-term exposure to elevated salinity as is expected under sea-level rise.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz054,7,NA,NA,coz054,Freshwater turtles; osmoregulation; salinity; sea-level rise

We posit that these local adjustments reflected the combination of thermal extremes and thermal variation experienced within the habitats. Warming of aquatic ecosystems is transforming the distribution, phenology and growth of the organisms dependent upon these ecosystems. Aquatic insects such as stoneflies are especially vulnerable to warming because the aquatic nymph stage of their life cycle depends on cool, well-oxygenated, flowing water habitat. We tracked thermal effects on available aerobic capacity of the aquatic nymph stage of an iconic and vulnerable stonefly species, the giant salmonfly (Pteronarcys californica), to compare habitat thermal regime measurements for two salmonfly populations from habitats separated by a gradient in summer weekly maximum temperatures. Contrary to expectations, the thermal optima range of the warmer habitat population was cooler than for the cooler habitat population. We posit that this unexpected interpopulation variation in thermal response is more strongly driven by diel and seasonal thermal variability than by the highest summer temperatures experienced within respective habitats. Additionally, we show that summer daily maximum temperatures could result in periodic limits in available aerobic capacity to support work of the warmer habitat nymphs and may be the mechanism underlying reduced abundance relative to the upstream cooler habitat population. Our findings provide insight into potential thermal and metabolic mechanisms that could regulate the success of ecological and culturally important aquatic insect species experiencing global change.

We studied juvenile plants from three biomes: temperate coastal rainforest, desert and alpine. In controlled settings, plants underwent hot days and cold nights in a factorial design to examine thermal tolerance acclimation. We assessed thermal thresholds (Tcrit-hot and Tcrit-cold) and TTB. We hypothesized that (i) desert species would show the highest heat tolerance, alpine species the greatest cold tolerance and temperate species intermediate tolerance; (ii) all species would increase heat tolerance after hot days and cold tolerance after cold nights; (iii) combined exposure would broaden TTB more than individual conditions, especially in desert and alpine species. We found that biome responses were minor compared to the responses to the extreme temperature treatments. All plants increased thermal tolerance in response to hot 40 degrees C days (Tcrit-hot increased by similar to 3.5 degrees C), but there was minimal change in Tcrit-cold in response to the cold -2 degrees C nights. In contrast, when exposed to both hot days and cold nights, on average, plants exhibited an antagonistic response in TTB, where cold tolerance decreased and heat tolerance was reduced, and so we did not see the bi-directional expansion we hypothesized. There was, however, considerable variation among species in these responses.

The North Pacific coast of British Columbia is characterized by strong temporal and spatial heterogeneity in ocean conditions with upwelling events elevating CO2 levels up to 10-fold those of pre-industrial global averages. Early life stages of pink salmon have been shown to be affected by these CO2 levels, and juveniles naturally migrate through regions of high CO2 during the energetically costly phase of smoltification. To investigate the physiological response of out-migrating wild juvenile pink salmon to these naturally occurring elevated CO2 levels, we captured fish in Georgia Strait, British Columbia and transported them to a marine lab (Hakai Institute, Quadra Island) where fish were exposed to one of three CO2 levels (850, 1500 and 2000 mu atm CO2) for 2 weeks. At 1/2, 1 and 2 weeks of exposure, we measured their weight and length to calculate condition factor (Fulton's K), as well as haematocrit and plasma {[}Cl-]. At each of these times, two additional stressors were imposed (hypoxia and temperature) to provide further insight into their physiological condition. Juvenile pink salmon were largely robust to elevated CO2 concentrations up to 2000 mu atm CO2, with no mortality or change in condition factor over the 2-week exposure duration. After 1 week of exposure, temperature and hypoxia tolerance were significantly reduced in high CO2, an effect that did not persist to 2 weeks of exposure. Haematocrit was increased by 20\% after 2 weeks in the CO2 treatments relative to the initial measurements, while plasma {[}Cl-] was not significantly different.

As ectotherms, fish thermal and hypoxia tolerances directly determine the capacity of species to persist in these environments during low flow periods when water temperatures are high and waterbodies become highly stratified. Chronic thermal stress can compound the impacts of acute hypoxic events on fish resulting in significant fish mortality; however, it is not known if all size classes are equally susceptible, or if the allometric scaling of physiological processes means some size classes are disproportionately affected. We investigated the physiological responses of Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii) over a four-fold body size range (0.2-3000 g) to acute changes in water temperature and oxygen concentration following 4 weeks of acclimation to representative spring (20 degrees C) and summer (28 degrees C) water temperatures. We recorded maximum thermal tolerance (CTmax), oxygen limited thermal tolerance (PCTmax), lowest tolerable oxygen level (as the oxygen level at which lose equilibrium; O-2,O-LOE), gill ventilation rates and aerial surface respiration threshold, blood oxygen transport capacity and lactate accumulation. Acclimation to elevated water temperatures improved thermal and hypoxia tolerance metrics across all size classes. However, body size significantly affected thermal and hypoxia responses. Small M. peelii were significantly less hypoxia tolerant than larger individuals, while larger fish were significantly less thermal tolerant than smaller fish. Hypoxia constrained thermal tolerance in M. peelii, with both small and large fish disproportionally compromised relative to mid-sized fish.

We aimed to improve and apply knowledge on the ecophysiological responses of halophytes to SLR to conservation management of salt marshes. In a mesocosm experiment, we measured and compared phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) activity and related functional traits of the California-native Spartina foliosa, invasive S. densiflora and their hybrid S. densiflora x foliosa in response to increasing levels of salinity and inundation. S. foliosa was moderately sensitive to salinity, showing a 57\% reduction in PEPC specific activity from freshwater to hypersalinity. This native species compensated for the reduction of PEPC activity with increased salinity through 80\% higher enzyme activation by phosphorylation. PEPC functional trait responses of S. foliosa were mostly independent of inundation depth. In view of these results, managers should conserve undeveloped lands for accommodation space above current high tide lines to facilitate colonization of stress-tolerant S. foliosa. Our results on functional responses of PEPC traits recorded high sensitivity to salinity for S. densiflora. This was reflected by 65\% lower PEPC specific activity together with increasing accumulation of free proline (+96\%) and total proteins (+23\%) with elevated salinity. These results suggest prioritized eradication of S. densiflora populations in brackish habitats. Measured PEPC responses support the high stress tolerance of the S. densiflora x foliosa hybrid. PEPC traits for the hybrid were mostly independent of salinity and inundation. The hybrid showed higher PEPC-specific activity than S. foliosa (+70\%) and S. densiflora (+15\%) in freshwater under intermediate inundation.

We present representative examples of the extent to which vertebrate foraging behaviour, food availability (quantity and quality) and digestive physiology have been modified due to humaninduced environmental changes and human activities.

We also discuss the role of nutrition in conservation practices, from the perspective of both in situ and ex situ conservation.

article,Early exposure to ultraviolet-B radiation decreases immune function later in life,"Ceccato, Emma and Cramp, Rebecca L. and Seebacher, Frank and Franklin, Craig E.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Amphibians have declined dramatically worldwide. Many of these declines are occurring in areas where no obvious anthropogenic stressors are present. It is proposed that in these areas, environmental factors such as elevated solar ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation could be responsible. Ultraviolet-B levels have increased in many parts of the world as a consequence of the anthropogenic destruction of the ozone layer. Amphibian tadpoles are particularly sensitive to the damaging effects of UV-B radiation, with exposure disrupting growth and fitness in many species. Given that UV-B can disrupt immune function in other animals, we tested the hypothesis that early UV-B exposure suppresses the immune responses of amphibian tadpoles and subsequent juvenile frogs. We exposed Limnodynastes peronii tadpoles to sublethal levels of UV-B radiation for 6 weeks after hatching, then examined indices of immune function in both the tadpoles and the subsequent metamorphs. There was no significant effect of UV-B on tadpole leucocyte counts or on their response to an acute antigen (phytohaemagglutinin) challenge. However, early UV-B exposure resulted in a significant reduction in both metamorph leucocyte abundance and their response to an acute phytohaemagglutinin challenge. These data demonstrate that early UV-B exposure can have carry-over effects on later life-history traits even if the applied stressor has no immediately discernible effect. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the effects of UV-B exposure on amphibian health and susceptibility to diseases such as chytridiomycosis.",2016,10.1093/conphys/cow037,4,NA,NA,cow037,Amphibian declines; disease; immunocompetence; leucocyte; phytohaemagglutinin; ultraviolet radiation

We examined the capacity for marine osmoregulation in upstream spawning migrants by characterizing the physiological effects of salinity challenge from a molecular perspective. Estuarine-captured migrants held in freshwater (FW) for similar to 1 week (short-term acclimation) or 2 months (long-term acclimation) underwent an incremental salinity challenge until loss of equilibrium occurred and upper thresholds of 25 and 17.5, respectively, occurred. Regardless of salinity tolerance, all lamprey downregulated FW ion-uptake mechanisms {[}gill transcripts of Na+:Cl-cotransporter (NCC/slc12a3) and epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC/scnn1) and kidney Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) protein and activity but not transcript]. At their respective salinity limits, lamprey displayed a clear osmoregulatory failure and were unable to regulate {[}Na+] and {[}Cl-] in plasma and intestinal fluid within physiological limits, becoming osmocompromised. A >90\% drop in haematocrit indicated haemolysis, and higher plasma concentrations of the cytosolic enzymes alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase indicated damage to other tissues, including liver. However, >80\% of short-term FW-acclimated fish were able to osmoregulate efficiently, with less haemolysis and tissue damage. This osmoregulatory ability was correlated with significant upregulation of the secretory form of Na+:K+:2Cl(-) cotransporter (NKCC1/slc12a2) transcript levels and the re-emergence of seawater-type ionocytes detected through immunohistochemical NKA immunoreactivity in the gill, the central ionoregulatory organ. This work sheds light on the molecular and physiological limits to the potential return to seawater for lampreys searching for alternative FW systems in which to spawn.",2016,10.1093/conphys/cov064,4,NA,NA,cov064,Lamprey; osmoregulation; spawning migration

Other finfish species are also infected and infection events may be associated with periods of unusual high temperatures. Currently little is known about the impact of AGD on wild fish, but in a time with global warming and increasing aquaculture production this potential threat could be on the rise. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of infected fish is therefore warranted. In this study, groups of Atlantic salmon with and without AGD were tested in a large swim tunnel respirometer in seawater at 13 degrees C to assess oxygen uptake, swimming capacity and blood parameters. Standard metabolic rates were similar between groups, but the maximum rate of oxygen uptake was drastically reduced in infected fish, which resulted in a smaller aerobic scope (AS) of 203 mg O-2 kg(-1) h(-1) compared to 406 mg O-2 kg(-1) h(-1) in healthy fish. The critical swimming speed was 2.5 body lengths s(-1) in infected fish and 3.0 body lengths s(-1) in healthy ones. Furthermore, AGD fish had lower haematocrit and {[}haemoglobin], but similar condition factor compared to healthy fish. Prior to swim trials infected fish had higher plasma osmolality, elevated plasma {[}Na+], {[}Cl-] and {[}cortisol], indicating reduced capacity to maintain ionic homoeostasis as well as chronic stress during routine conditions. These results demonstrate that AGD compromises gill function both in terms of gas exchange and ion regulation, and consequently the capacity for aerobic activity is reduced. Reduced AS due to the P. perurans infections is likely to interfere with appetite, growth and overall survival, even more so in the context of a warmer and more hypoxic future.",2017,10.1093/conphys/cox066,5,NA,NA,cox066,Amoebic gill disease; Ucrit; respirometry; stress physiology; aquaculture

We aimed to improve and apply knowledge on the ecophysiological responses of halophytes to SLR to conservation management of salt marshes. In a mesocosm experiment, we measured and compared phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) activity and related functional traits of the California-native Spartina foliosa, invasive S. densiflora and their hybrid S. densiflora x foliosa in response to increasing levels of salinity and inundation. S. foliosa was moderately sensitive to salinity, showing a 57\% reduction in PEPC specific activity from freshwater to hypersalinity. This native species compensated for the reduction of PEPC activity with increased salinity through 80\% higher enzyme activation by phosphorylation. PEPC functional trait responses of S. foliosa were mostly independent of inundation depth. In view of these results, managers should conserve undeveloped lands for accommodation space above current high tide lines to facilitate colonization of stress-tolerant S. foliosa. Our results on functional responses of PEPC traits recorded high sensitivity to salinity for S. densiflora. This was reflected by 65\% lower PEPC specific activity together with increasing accumulation of free proline (+96\%) and total proteins (+23\%) with elevated salinity. These results suggest prioritized eradication of S. densiflora populations in brackish habitats. Measured PEPC responses support the high stress tolerance of the S. densiflora x foliosa hybrid. PEPC traits for the hybrid were mostly independent of salinity and inundation. The hybrid showed higher PEPC-specific activity than S. foliosa (+70\%) and S. densiflora (+15\%) in freshwater under intermediate inundation. Results suggest that eradication of the hybrid should be the highest management priority. Our study shows that the responses of key functional physiological traits to environmental stresses serve as biological indicators that can guide ecosystem management practices in a scenario of climate change.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa053,8,NA,NA,coaa053,environmental stress; hybrid; inundation; PEPC; polyploid; salinity; transgressive traits

Despite 50+ years of population monitoring, the efficacy of 10+ years of conservation efforts for longfin smelt remain uncertain due to a limited understanding of how the species responds to environmental variation, such as salinity. For example, high mortality during larval stages has prevented culture efforts from closing the life cycle in captivity. Here, we investigated the effects of salinity on longfin smelt yolk-sac larvae. Newly hatched larvae from four single-pair crosses were acutely transferred to and reared at salinities of 0.4, 5, 10, 20 or 32 ppt. We compared whole-body water and sodium ion (Na+) content, notochord length and yolk-sac volume at 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours post-transfer for each salinity treatment. We found that larvae maintained osmotic and ionic balance at 0.4-10 ppt, whereas salinities >10 ppt resulted in decreased water and increased whole-body Na content. We also found that larvae grew largest and survived the longest when reared at 5 and 10 ppt, respectively, and that yolk resorption stalled at 0.4 ppt. Finally, there were significant but small interclutch variations in responses to different salinities, with clutch accounting for <8\% of the variance in our statistical models. Overall, our results indicate that longfin smelt yolk-sac larvae likely perform best at moderately brackish conditions, thus yielding a mechanism that explains their distribution in field surveys and providing key information for future conservation efforts.",2022,10.1093/conphys/coac041,10,1,NA,coac041,yolk resorption; San Francisco Estuary; fish; early life stages; Aquaculture

Through an unmanipulated field study across 4 populations of free-living, white-tailed deer, we investigated the effect of variable summer rainfall on fecal glucocorticoid metabolites in adult females in autumn. We found evidence reduced summer rainfall imparted long-term effects on female glucocorticoid levels, but the effect of past environmental conditions depended on reproductive status. In the age of global climate change, extreme climatic events are expected to increase in frequency and severity. Animals will be forced to cope with these novel stressors in their environment. Glucocorticoids (i.e. `stress' hormones) facilitate an animal's ability to cope with their environment. To date, most studies involving glucocorticoids focus on the immediate physiological effects of an environmental stressor on an individual, few studies have investigated the long-term physiological impacts of such stressors. Here, we tested the hypothesis that previous exposure to an environmental stressor will impart lasting consequences to an individual's glucocorticoid levels. In semi-arid environments, variable rainfall drives forage availability for herbivores. Reduced seasonal precipitation can present an extreme environmental stressor potentially imparting long-term impacts on an individual's glucocorticoid levels. We examined the effects of rainfall and environmental characteristics (i.e. soil and vegetation attributes) during fawn-rearing (i.e. summer) on subsequent glucocorticoid levels of female white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in autumn. We captured 124 adult (>= 2.5-year-old) female deer via aerial net-gunning during autumn of 2015, 2016 and 2021 across four populations spanning a gradient of environmental characteristics and rainfall in the semi-arid environment of South Texas, USA. We found for every 1 cm decrease in summer rainfall, faecal glucocorticoid levels in autumn increased 6.9\%, but only in lactating females. Glucocorticoid levels in non-lactating, female deer were relatively insensitive to environmental conditions. Our study demonstrates the long-lasting effects of environmental stressors on an individual's glucocorticoid levels. A better understanding of the long-term effects stressors impart on an individual's glucocorticoid levels will help to evaluate the totality of the cost of a stressor to an individual's welfare and predict the consequences of future climate scenarios.",2024,10.1093/conphys/coae045,12,1,NA,coae045,Glucocorticoids; lactation; legacy effects; rainfall; reproductive trade-off; white-tailed deer

These extreme weather events can lead to mass mortality and reproduction failure, and therefore cause population declines. Understanding how the reproductive physiology of organisms is affected by water shortages will help clarify whether females can adjust their reproductive strategy to dry conditions or may fail to reproduce and survive. In this study, we investigated the consequences of a short period of water deprivation (2 weeks) during early pregnancy on the physiology and behaviour of a cold- and wet-adapted ectotherm (Vipera berus). We also examined water allocation to developing embryos and embryonic survival. Water-deprived females exhibited significant dehydration, physiological stress and loss of muscle mass. These effects of water deprivation on water balance and muscle loss were correlated with the number of developing embryos. While water-deprived females maintained water transfer to embryos at the expense of their own maintenance, water deprivation also led to embryonic mortality. Overall, water deprivation amplifies the reproductive costs of water allocation to support embryonic development. The deleterious impacts of water deprivation on female current reproductive performance and on potential survival and future reproduction could lead to severe population declines in this species.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab071,9,NA,NA,coab071,Dehydration; fecundity; reproduction; trade-off; water deprivation

The use of non-invasive methods to determine the physiological state in response to environmental stressors is therefore an important advance in the field of conservation physiology. The glucocorticoid hormone corticosterone (CORT) is one useful biomarker to assess physiological stress in amphibians, and sampling water-borne (WB) CORT is a novel, non-invasive collection technique. Here, we tested whether WB CORT can serve as a valid proxy of organismal levels of CORT in larvae of the common frog (Rana temporaria). We evaluated the association between tissue and WB CORT levels sampled from the same individuals across ontogenetic stages, ranging from newly hatched larvae to froglets at 10 days after metamorphosis. We also investigated how both tissue and WB CORT change throughout ontogeny. We found that WB CORT is a valid method in pro-metamorphic larvae as values for both methods were highly correlated. In contrast, there was no correlation between tissue and WB CORT in newly hatched, pre-metamorphic larvae, metamorphs or post-metamorphic froglets probably due to ontogenetic changes in respiratory and skin morphology and physiology affecting the transdermal CORT release. Both collection methods consistently revealed a non-linear pattern of ontogenetic change in CORT with a peak at metamorphic climax. Thus, our results indicate that WB CORT sampling is a promising, non-invasive conservation tool for studies on late-stage amphibian larvae. However, we suggest considering that different contexts might affect the reliability of WB CORT and consequently urge future studies to validate this method whenever it is used in new approaches. We conclude proposing some recommendations and perspectives on the use of WB CORT that will aid in broadening its application as a non-invasive tool in amphibian conservation physiology.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad070,11,1,NA,coad070,Biomarker; conservation physiology toolbox; environmental stress; European common frog/Rana temporaria; glucocorticoid hormone; metamorphosis

In the present study, we evaluate the effects of ocean warming (+4 degrees C) and acidification (Delta pH = -0.5 units) on the physiological and behavioural ecology of adult temperate seahorses, Hippocampus guttulatus. Adult seahorses were found to be relatively well prepared to face future changes in ocean temperature, but not the combined effect of warming and acidification. Seahorse metabolism increased normally with warming, and behavioural and feeding responses were not significantly affected. However, during hypercapnia the seahorses exhibited signs of lethargy (i.e. reduced activity levels) combined with a reduction of feeding and ventilation rates.

The passive dissolution of anthropogenically produced CO2 into the ocean system is reducing ocean pH and changing a suite of chemical equilibria, with negative consequences for some marine organisms, in particular those that bear calcium carbonate shells. Although our monitoring of these chemical changes has improved, we have not developed effective tools to translate observations, which are typically of the pH and carbonate saturation state, into ecologically relevant predictions of biological risks. One potential solution is to develop bioindicators: biological variables with a clear relationship to environmental risk factors that can be used for assessment and management. Thecosomatous pteropods are a group of pelagic shelled marine gastropods, whose biological responses to CO2 have been suggested as potential bioindicators of ocean acidification owing to their sensitivity to acidification in both the laboratory and the natural environment. Using five CO2 exposure experiments, occurring across four seasons and running for up to 15 days, we describe a consistent relationship between saturation state, shell transparency and duration of exposure, as well as identify a suite of genes that could be used for biological monitoring with further study. We clarify variations in thecosome responses due to seasonality, resolving prior uncertainties and demonstrating the range of their phenotypic plasticity. These biomarkers of acidification stress can be implemented into ecosystem models and monitoring programmes in regions where pteropods are found, whilst the approach will serve as an example for other regions on how to bridge the gap between point-based chemical monitoring and biologically relevant assessments of ecosystem health.",2024,10.1093/conphys/coae040,12,1,NA,coae040,Calcification; gene expression; respiration; thecosome
article,Energetic costs increase with faster heating in an aquatic ectotherm,"Harding, Lucy and Jackson, Andrew L. and Payne, Nicholas",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"We show that rate of temperature change has a systematic effect on the oxygen consumption of ectotherms and that as temperature increases more rapidly, the rate of oxygen consumption increases. These findings have implications for how we predict ectotherm responses to climate change, for example heat waves. The thermal sensitivity of metabolism is widely studied due to its perceived importance for organismal fitness and resilience to future climate change. Almost all such studies estimate metabolism at a variety of constant temperatures, with very little work exploring how metabolism varies during temperature change. However, temperature in nature is rarely static, so our existing understanding from experiments may not reflect how temperature influences metabolism in natural systems. Using closed-chamber respirometry, we estimated the aerobic metabolic rate of an aquatic ectotherm, the Atlantic ditch shrimp Palaemonetes varians, under varying thermal conditions. We continuously measured oxygen consumption of shrimp during heating, cooling and constant temperatures, starting trials at a range of acclimation temperatures and exposing shrimp to a variety of rates of temperature change. In a broad sense, cumulative oxygen consumption estimated from static temperature exposures corresponded to estimates derived from ramping experiments. However, further analyses showed that oxygen consumption increases for both faster heating and faster cooling, with rapid heating driving higher metabolic rates than if shrimp were warmed slowly. These results suggest a systematic influence of heating rate on the thermal sensitivity of metabolism. With influential concepts such as the metabolic theory of ecology founded in data from constant temperature experiments, our results encourage further exploration of how variable temperature impacts organism energetics, and to test the generality of our findings across species.

The results showed that the photosynthetic physiological activities of remnant M. laxiflora populations underwent a period of rapid growth, followed by a gradual decline in the growth recovery phase after flooding. During the entire experimental period, photosynthetic physiological activities of remnant M. laxiflora populations changed with prolongation of emergence time: specifically, net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance initially decreased and then subsequently increased, intercellular carbon dioxide concentrations peaked at mid-phase and transpiration rate continuously increased. The maximum net photosynthetic rate, apparent photosynthetic quantum efficiency and dark respiration rate in the light-response curves of the plants continuously increased during growth. The water level gradient also significantly affected the photosynthetic physiological activities in the remnant populations, i.e. the photosynthetic physiological activities of high-altitude plants were significantly higher than the middle- and low-altitude plants. The changes in photosynthetic pigment content of plants in remnant populations during the growth recovery phase and the entire growth period were similar to those occurring in photosynthetic activities in plants. Further, canonical correspondence analysis showed that photosynthetic physiological activities in the plants were significantly correlated with changes in water levels, emergence time, elevation gradient, soil water and soil nitrogen contents.

Skin pH regulates the activity of enzymes produced both by hosts and by microbes on host skin, thus implicating pH in disease susceptibility. Skin pH varies inter-and intra-specifically and is influenced by a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic variables. Increased skin alkalinity is associated with a predisposition to cutaneous infections in humans and dogs, and inter-specific and inter-individual variation in skin pH is implicated in differential susceptibility to some skin diseases. The cutaneous pH of bats has not been characterized but is postulated to play a role in susceptibility to white-nose syndrome (WNS), a fungal infection that has decimated several Nearctic bat species. We used non-invasive probes to measure the pH of bat flight membranes in five species with differing susceptibility to WNS. Skin pH ranged from 4.67 to 8.59 and varied among bat species, geographic locations, body parts, age classes, sexes and seasons. Wild Eptesicus fuscus were consistently more acidic than wild Myotis lucifugus, Myotis leibii and Perimyotis subflavus. Juvenile bats had more acidic skin than adults during maternity season but did not differ during swarming. Male M. lucifugus were more acidic than females during maternity season, yet this trend reversed during swarming. Bat skin was more acidic in summer compared to winter, a pattern also reported in humans. Skin pH was more acidic in captive than wild E. fuscus, suggesting environmental impacts on skin pH.

Variation in environmental quality may affect an organism's physiological health and, ultimately, survival and fitness. Using multiple health measures can aid in identifying populations at increased risk of declines. Our objective was to measure environmental variables at multiple spatial scales and their effect on three indicators of health in ornate chorus frog (Pseudacris ornata) tadpoles to identify potential correlates of population declines. To accomplish this, we measured a glucocorticoid hormone (corticosterone; CORT) profile associated with the stress response, as well as the skin mucosal immune function (combined function of skin secretions and skin bacterial community) and bacterial communities of tadpoles from multiple ponds. We found that water quality characteristics associated with environmental variation, including higher water temperature, conductivity and total dissolved solids, as well as percent developed land nearby, were associated with elevated CORT release rates. However, mucosal immune function, although highly variable, was not significantly associated with water quality or environmental factors. Finally, we examined skin bacterial diversity as it aids in immunity and is affected by environmental variation. We found that skin bacterial diversity differed between ponds and was affected by land cover type, canopy cover and pond proximity.

Salinization and rising temperatures are two pertinent stressors predicted to intensify in freshwater ecosystems, posing concern for how susceptible organisms achieve and maintain homeostasis (i.e. allostasis). Here, glucocorticoid hormones (e.g. cortisol), responsible for mobilizing energy (e.g. glucose) to relevant physiological processes for the duration of stressors, are liable to vary in response to the duration and severity of salinization and temperature rises. With field and laboratory studies, we evaluated how both salinity and temperature influence basal and stress-reactive cortisol and glucose levels in age 1+ mottled sculpin (Cottus bairdii), mountain sucker (Catostomus platyrhynchus) and Colorado River cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki pleuriticus). We found that temperature generally had the greatest effect on cortisol and glucose concentrations and the effect of salinity was often temperature dependent. We also found that when individuals were chronically exposed to higher salinities, baseline concentrations of cortisol and glucose usually declined as salinity increased. Reductions in baseline concentrations facilitated stronger stress reactivity for cortisol and glucose when exposed to additional stressors, which weakened as temperatures increased. Controlled temperatures near the species'thermal maxima became the overriding factor regulating fish physiology, resulting in inhibitory responses.

This species occurs only in several saline water systems in the southwestern USA and northern Mexico, where salinity is largely controlled by water-management practices. Consequently, understanding the osmoregulatory capacity of this species is important for their conservation. The lower acclimation limit of C. macularius in freshwater was found to be 2 mM Na+. Fish acclimated to 2 or 7 mM Na+ displayed similar Na+ uptake kinetics, with Km values of 4321 and 3672 mu M and V-max values of 4771 and 3602 nmol g(-1) h(-1), respectively. A series of experiments using pharmacological inhibitors indicated that Na+ uptake in C. macularius was not sensitive to bumetanide, metolazone, or phenamil. These results indicate the Na+-K+-2Cl(-) cotransporter, Na+-Cl- cotransporter, and the Na+ channel-H+-ATPase system are likely not to be involved in Na+ uptake at the apical membrane of fish gill ionocytes in fish acclimated to 2 or 7 mM Na+.

article,Chemical niches and ionoregulatory traits: applying ionoregulatory physiology to the conservation management of freshwater fishes,"Zimmer, Alex M. and Goss, Greg G. and Glover, Chris N.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Alterations in water chemistry can challenge resident fish species. More specifically, chemical changes that disrupt ion balance will negatively affect fish health and impact physiological and ecological performance. However, our understanding of which species and populations are at risk from ionoregulatory disturbances in response to changing freshwater environments is currently unclear. Therefore, we propose a novel framework for incorporating ionoregulatory physiology into conservation management of inland fishes. This framework introduces the concepts of fundamental chemical niche, which is the tolerable range of chemical conditions for a given species based on laboratory experiments, and realized chemical niche, which is the range of chemical conditions in which a species resides based on distribution surveys. By comparing these two niches, populations thatmay be at risk fromionoregulatory disturbances and thus require additional conservation considerations can be identified. We highlight the potential for commonly measured ionoregulatory traits to predict fundamental and realized chemical niches but caution that some traits may not serve as accurate predictors despite being important for understanding ionoregulatory mechanisms. As a sample application of our framework, the minimum pH distribution (realized niche) and survival limit pH (fundamental niche) of several North American fishes were determined by systematic review and were compared. We demonstrate that ionoregulatory capacity is significantly correlated with a realized niche for many species, highlighting the influence of ionoregulatory physiology on fish distribution patterns along chemical gradients. Our aim is that this framework will stimulate further research in this field and result in a broader integration of physiological data into conservation management decisions for inland waters.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab066,9,NA,NA,coab066,Acid; calcium; salinity; sodium
article,Compromised thermal tolerance of cardiovascular capacity in upstream migrating Arctic char and brown trout-are hot summers threatening migrating salmonids?,"Mottola, Giovanna and Kristensen, Torstein and Anttila, Katja",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Heat waves are threatening fish around the world, leading sometimes to mass mortality events. One crucial function of fish failing in high temperatures is oxygen delivery capacity, i.e. cardiovascular function. For anadromous salmonids, increased temperature could be especially detrimental during upstream migration since they need efficiently working oxygen delivery system in order to cross the river rapids to reach upstream areas. The migration also occurs during summer and early autumn exposing salmonids to peak water temperatures, and in shallow rivers there is little availability for thermal refuges as compared to thermally stratified coastal and lake habitats. In order to shed light on the mechanisms underpinning the capacity of migrating fish to face high environmental temperatures, we applied a physiological and molecular approach measuring cardiovascular capacities of migrating and resident Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) in Northern Norway. The maximum cardiovascular capacity of migrating fish was significantly lower compared to the resident conspecifics. The onset of cardiac impairment started only 2 degrees C higher than river temperature, meaning that even a small increase in water temperature may already compromise cardiac function. The migrating fish were also under significant cellular stress, expressing increased level of cardiac heat shock proteins. We consider these findings highly valuable when addressing climate change effect on migrating fish and encourage taking action in riverine habitat conservation policies. The significant differences in upper thermal tolerance of resident and migrating fish could also lead changes in population dynamics, which should be taken into account in future conservation plans.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa101,8,NA,NA,coaa101,NA

This level of warming and the associated environmental variability are already increasing pressure on natural and human systems. Here we emphasize the role of physiology in the light of the latest assessment of climate warming by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We describe how physiology can contribute to contemporary conservation programmes. We focus on thermal responses of animals, but we acknowledge that the impacts of climate change are much broader phylogenetically and environmentally. A physiological contribution would encompass environmental monitoring, coupled with measuring individual sensitivities to temperature change and upscaling these to ecosystem level. The latest version of the widely accepted Conservation Standards designed by the Conservation Measures Partnership includes several explicit climate change considerations. We argue that physiology has a unique role to play in addressing these considerations. Moreover, physiology can be incorporated by institutions and organizations that range from international bodies to national governments and to local communities, and in doing so, it brings a mechanistic approach to conservation and the management of biological resources.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad038,11,1,NA,NA,Conservation Standards; climate warming; environmental monitoring; thermal sensitivity; plasticity; species distribution models; food webs
article,"Identification of supraoptimal temperatures in juvenile blueback herring (<i>Alosa aestivalis</i>) using survival, growth rate and scaled energy reserves","Guo, Lian W. and Jordaan, Adrian and Schultz, Eric T. and McCormick, Stephen D.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"We measured anadromous juvenile blueback herring survival, growth rate and energy reserves across temperatures 21-33 degrees C when fed a constant ration. Growth was more sensitive to warm temperatures than energy reserves. Survival remained high, yet smaller size at high temperatures may detrimentally delay emigration, increase predation and lower physiological resilience. For young fishes, growth of somatic tissues and energy reserves are critical steps for survival and progressing to subsequent life stages. When thermal regimes become supraoptimal, routine metabolic rates increase and leave less energy for young fish to maintain fitness-based activities and, in the case of anadromous fishes, less energy to prepare for emigration to coastal habitats. Thus, understanding how energy allocation strategies are affected by thermal regimes in young anadromous fish will help to inform climate-ready management of vulnerable species and their habitat. Blueback herring (Alosa aestivalis) are an anadromous fish species that remain at historically low population levels and are undergoing southern edge-range contraction, possibly due to climate change. We examined the effects of temperature (21 degrees C, 24 degrees C, 27 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 33 degrees C) on survival, growth rate and energy reserves of juveniles collected from the mid-geographic range of the species. We identified a strong negative relationship between temperature and growth rate, resulting in smaller juveniles at high temperatures. We observed reduced survival at both 21 degrees C and 33 degrees C, increased fat and lean mass-at-length at high temperatures, but no difference in energy density. Juveniles were both smaller and contained greater scaled energy reserves at higher temperatures, indicating growth in length is more sensitive to temperature than growth of energy reserves. Currently, mid-geographic range juvenile blueback herring populations may be well suited for local thermal regimes, but continued warming could decrease survival and growth rates. Blueback herring populations may benefit from mitigation actions that maximize juvenile energy resources by increasing the availability of cold refugia and food-rich habitats, as well as reducing other stressors such as hypoxic zones.",2022,10.1093/conphys/coac022,10,1,NA,coac022,NA
article,Temporal variability modulates pH impact on larval sea urchin development,"Chan, Kit Yu Karen and Tong, Chun Sang Daniel",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Coastal organisms reside in highly dynamic habitats. Global climate change is expected to alter not only the mean of the physical conditions experienced but also the frequencies and/or the magnitude of fluctuations of environmental factors. Understanding responses in an ecologically relevant context is essential for formulating management strategies. In particular, there are increasing suggestions that exposure to fluctuations could alleviate the impact of climate change-related stressors by selecting for plasticity that may help acclimatization to future conditions. However, it remains unclear whether the presence of fluctuations alone is sufficient to confer such effects or whether the pattern of the fluctuations matters. Therefore, we investigated the role of frequency and initial conditions of the fluctuations on performance by exposing larval sea urchin Heliocidaris crassispina to either constant or fluctuating pH. Reduced pH alone (pH 7.3 vs 8.0) did not affect larval mortality but reduced the growth of larval arms in the static pH treatments. Changes in morphology could affect the swimming mechanics for these small organisms, and geometric morphometric analysis further suggested an overall shape change such that acidified larvae had more U-shaped bodies and shorter arms, which would help maintain stability in moving water. The relative negative impact of lower pH, computed as log response ratio, on larval arm development was smaller when larvae were exposed to pH fluctuations, especially when the change was less frequent (48- vs 24-h cycle). Furthermore, larvae experiencing an initial pH drop, i.e. those where the cycle started at pH 8.0, were more negatively impacted compared with those kept at an initial pH of 7.3 before the cycling started. Our observations suggest that larval responses to climate change stress could not be easily predicted from mean conditions. Instead, to better predict organismal performance in the future ocean, monitoring and investigation of the role of real-time environmental fluctuations along the dispersive pathway is key.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa008,8,NA,NA,coaa008,Biomechanics; ocean acidification; pH fluctuation; pluteus

P. Amy and Chown, Steven L.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"As global climates change, alien species are anticipated to have a growing advantage relative to their indigenous counterparts, mediated through consistent trait differences between the groups. These insights have largely been developed based on interspecific comparisons using multiple species examined from different locations. Whether such consistent physiological trait differences are present within assemblages is not well understood, especially for animals. Yet, it is at the assemblage level that interactions play out. Here, we examine whether physiological trait differences observed at the interspecific level are also applicable to assemblages. We focus on the Collembola, an important component of the soil fauna characterized by invasions globally, and five traits related to fitness: critical thermal maximum, minimum and range, desiccation resistance and egg development rate. We test the predictions that the alien component of a local assemblage has greater basal physiological tolerances or higher rates, and more pronounced phenotypic plasticity than the indigenous component. Basal critical thermal maximum, thermal tolerance range, desiccation resistance, optimum temperature for egg development, the rate of development at that optimum and the upper temperature limiting egg hatching success are all significantly higher, on average, for the alien than the indigenous components of the assemblage. Outcomes for critical thermal minimum are variable. No significant differences in phenotypic plasticity exist between the alien and indigenous components of the assemblage. These results are consistent with previous interspecific studies investigating basal thermal tolerance limits and development rates and their phenotypic plasticity, in arthropods, but are inconsistent with results from previous work on desiccation resistance. Thus, for the Collembola, the anticipated advantage of alien over indigenous species under warming and drying is likely to be manifest in local assemblages, globally.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa049,8,NA,NA,coaa049,Biological invasions; climate change; CTmax; CTmin; growth; water balance

The model was used to produce projections of growth and reproduction for these species, under different scenarios of ocean warming and acidification. A mechanistic model based on Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory was developed to predict the combined effects of ocean warming, acidification and decreased food availability on growth and reproduction of three commercially important marine fish species: white seabream (Diplodus sargus), zebra seabream (Diplodus cervinus) and Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis). Model simulations used a parameter set for each species, estimated by the Add-my-Pet method using data from laboratory experiments complemented with bibliographic sources. An acidification stress factor was added as a modifier of the somatic maintenance costs and estimated for each species to quantify the effect of a decrease in pH from 8.0 to 7.4 (white seabream) or 7.7 (zebra seabream and Senegalese sole). The model was used to project total length of individuals along their usual lifespan and number of eggs produced by an adult individual within one year, under different climate change scenarios for the end of the 21st century. For the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change SSP5-8.5, ocean warming led to higher growth rates during the first years of development, as well as an increase of 32-34\% in egg production, for the three species. Ocean acidification contributed to reduced growth for white seabream and Senegalese sole and a small increase for zebra seabream, as well as a decrease in egg production of 48-52\% and 14-33\% for white seabream and Senegalese sole, respectively, and an increase of 4-5\% for zebra seabream. The combined effect of ocean warming and acidification is strongly dependent on the decrease of food availability, which leads to significant reduction in growth and egg production. This is the first study to assess the combined effects of ocean warming and acidification using DEB models on fish, therefore, further research is needed for a better understanding of these climate change-related effects among different taxonomic groups and species.",2022,10.1093/conphys/coac048,10,1,NA,coac048,ocean warming; ocean acidification; fish metabolism; Dynamic Energy Budget; climate change

P.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Portable clinical analysers, such as the i-STAT system, are increasingly being used for blood analysis in animal ecology and physiology because of their portability and easy operation. Although originally conceived for clinical application and to replace robust but lengthy techniques, researchers have extended the use of the i-STAT system outside of humans and even to poikilothermic fish, with only limited validation. The present study analysed a range of blood parameters {[}pH, haematocrit (Hct), haemoglobin (Hb), HCO3-, partial pressure of CO2 (PCO2), partial pressure of O-2 (PO2), Hb saturation (sO(2)) and Na+ concentration] in a model teleost fish (rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss) using the i-STAT system (CG8+ cartridges) and established laboratory techniques. This methodological comparison was performed at two temperatures (10 and 20 degrees C), two haematocrits (low and high) and three PCO2 levels (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5\%). Our results indicate that pH was measured accurately with the i-STAT system over a physiological pH range and using the i-STAT temperature correction. Haematocrit was consistently underestimated by the i-STAT, while the measurements of Na+, PCO2, HCO3- and PO2 were variably inaccurate over the range of values typically found in fish. The algorithm that the i-STAT uses to calculate sO(2) did not yield meaningful results on rainbow trout blood. Application of conversion factors to correct i-STAT measurements is not recommended, due to significant effects of temperature, Hct and PCO2 on the measurement errors and complex interactions may exist. In conclusion, the i-STAT system can easily generate fast results from rainbow trout whole blood, but many are inaccurate values.",2014,10.1093/conphys/cou037,2,1,NA,cou037,Blood oxygen tension; blood pH; haematocrit; portable clinical analyser; rainbow trout

Populations of young sharks that rely on shallow coastal habitats, e.g. as nursery areas, may be at risk of experiencing these stressors. The purpose of this study was to characterize various components of the physiological stress response of neonatal reef sharks following exposure to an exhaustive challenge under relevant environmental conditions. To accomplish this, we monitored markers of the secondary stress response and measured oxygen uptake rates (MO2) to compare to laboratory-derived baseline values in neonatal blacktip reef (Carcharhinus melanopterus) and sicklefin lemon sharks (Negaprion acutidens). Measurements occurred over three hours following exposure to an exhaustive challenge (gill-net capture with air exposure). Blood lactate concentrations and pH deviated from baseline values at the 3-h sample, indicating that both species were still stressed 3 h after capture. Evidence of a temperature effect on physiological status of either species was equivocal over 28-31 degrees C. However, aspects of the physiological response were species-specific; N. acutidens exhibited a larger difference in blood pH relative to baseline values than C. melanopterus, possibly owing to higher minimum MO2 . Neither species experienced immediate mortality during the exhaustive challenge; although, single instances of delayed mortality were documented for each species. Energetic costs and recovery times could be extrapolated for C. melanopterus via respirometry; sharks were estimated to expend 9.9 kJ kg(-1) (15\% of energy expended on daily swimming) for a single challenge and could require 8.4 h to recover. These data suggest that neonatal C. melanopterus and N. acutidens are resilient to brief gill-net capture durations, but this was under a narrow temperature range.

Underlying differences in individual physiological condition, such as body size, stored energy and osmoregulatory function, could drive individual variation in the selection of estuary habitat. Here we investigated the role of variation in physiological condition on the selection of estuarine and ocean habitat by sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) smolts intercepted at the initiation of their 650-km downstream migration from Chilko Lake, Fraser River, British Columbia (BC). Behavioural salinity preference experiments were conducted on unfed smolts held in fresh water at three time intervals during their downstream migration period, representing the stage of migration at lake-exit, and the expected timing for estuary-entry and ocean-entry (0, 1 and 3 weeks after lake-exit, respectively). In general, salinity preference behaviour varied across the three time periods consistent with expected transition from river to estuary to ocean. Further, individual physiological condition did influence habitat choice. Smolt condition factor (K) and energy density were positively correlated with salinity preference behaviour in the estuary and ocean outmigration stages, but not at lake-exit. Our results suggest that smolt physiological condition upon reaching the estuary could influence migratory behaviour and habitat selection. This provides evidence on the temporally dependent interplay of physiology, behaviour and migration in wild juvenile Pacific salmon, with juvenile rearing conditions influencing smolt energetic status, which in turn influences habitat choice during downstream migration. The implication for the conservation of migratory species is that the relative importance of stopover habitats may vary as a function of initial condition.",2024,10.1093/conphys/coae011,12,1,NA,coae011,Pacific salmon; Oncorhynchus; smolt; migration; physiology; energetics; salinity preference

This heterogeneity subjects roosting bats to a variety of thermoregulatory challenges (e.g. heat and cold stress). Understanding how different bat box designs, landscape placements, weather and bat use affect temperature suitability and energy expenditure is critical to promote safe and beneficial artificial roosting habitat for species of conservation concern. From April to September 2019, we systematically deployed 480 temperature dataloggers among 40 rocket box style bat boxes of 5 designs and regularly monitored bat abundance. We used bioenergetic models to assess energy costs for endothermic and heterothermic bats and modelled the overheating risk for each box as a function of design, placement, bat abundance and weather. For endothermic bats, predicted daily energy expenditure was lower for solar-exposed placements, large group sizes and a box design with enhanced thermal mass. For heterothermic bats, shaded landscape placements were the most energetically beneficial and bat box design was not important, because all designs generally offered microclimates suitable for torpor use at some position within the box. Overheating risk was highest for solar-exposed landscape placements and for designs lacking modifications to buffer temperature, and with increasing bat abundance, increasing ambient temperature and slower wind speeds. The external water jacket design, with the greatest thermal mass, concomitantly decreased overheating risk and endothermic energy expenditure. By assessing bat box suitability from two physiological perspectives, we provide a robust method to assess the conservation value of bat box design and placement strategies. We recommend future studies examine how changing thermal mass and conductance can be used to diminish overheating risk while also enhancing the effects of social thermoregulation for bat box users.",2022,10.1093/conphys/coac027,10,1,NA,coac027,NA

These factors, in combination with naturally variable environments such as the rocky intertidal zone, may create extreme physiological challenges for organisms that are already performing near their biological limits. Although numerous studies have examined the impacts of climate-related stressors on intertidal animals, little is known about the underlying physiological mechanisms driving adaptation to ocean acidification and how this may alter organism interactions, particularly in marine vertebrates. Therefore, we have investigated the effects of decreased ocean pH on the hypoxia response of an intertidal sculpin, Clinocottus analis. We used both whole-animal and biochemistry-based analyses to examine how the energetic demands associated with acclimation to low-pH environments may impact the fish's reliance on facultative air breathing in low-oxygen environments. Our study demonstrated that acclimation to ocean acidification resulted in elevated routine metabolic rates and acid-base regulatory capacity (Na+,K+-ATPase activity). These, in turn, had downstream effects that resulted in decreased hypoxia tolerance (i.e. elevated critical oxygen tension). Furthermore, we present evidence that these fish may be living near their physiological capacity when challenged by ocean acidification. This serves as a reminder that the susceptibility of teleost fish to changes in ocean pH may be underestimated, particularly when considering the multiple stressors that many experience in their natural environments.",2016,10.1093/conphys/cow040,4,NA,NA,cow040,Hypoxia; metabolic rate; ocean acidification; sculpin; stress response
article,Physiologically grounded metrics of model skill: a case study estimating heat stress in intertidal populations,"Kish, Nicole E. and Helmuth, Brian and Wethey, David S.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Models of ecological responses to climate change fundamentally assume that predictor variables, which are often measured at large scales, are to some degree diagnostic of the smaller-scale biological processes that ultimately drive patterns of abundance and distribution. Given that organisms respond physiologically to stressors, such as temperature, in highly non-linear ways, small modelling errors in predictor variables can potentially result in failures to predict mortality or severe stress, especially if an organism exists near its physiological limits. As a result, a central challenge facing ecologists, particularly those attempting to forecast future responses to environmental change, is how to develop metrics of forecast model skill (the ability of a model to predict defined events) that are biologically meaningful and reflective of underlying processes. We quantified the skill of four simple models of body temperature (a primary determinant of physiological stress) of an intertidal mussel, Mytilus californianus, using common metrics of model performance, such as root mean square error, as well as forecast verification skill scores developed by the meteorological community. We used a physiologically grounded framework to assess each model's ability to predict optimal, sub-optimal, sub-lethal and lethal physiological responses. Models diverged in their ability to predict different levels of physiological stress when evaluated using skill scores, even though common metrics, such as root mean square error, indicated similar accuracy overall. Results from this study emphasize the importance of grounding assessments of model skill in the context of an organism's physiology and, especially, of considering the implications of false-positive and false-negative errors when forecasting the ecological effects of environmental change.",2016,10.1093/conphys/cow038,4,NA,NA,cow038,Biogeography; climate change; ecological forecasting; intertidal zone; model verification; thermal stress

Freshwater turtles are of particular concern as they appear to have limited ability to cope with environmental conditions that are hyperosmotic to their body fluids. Here, we determined the physiological responses of two Australian freshwater chelid turtles, Emydura macquarii and Chelodina expansa, exposed to freshwater (0\%(0)) and brackish water (15\%, representing a hyperosmotic environment). Brackish water is common in the Murray-Darling River Basin within the natural range of these species in Australia during periods of drought, yet it is unknown how well these species tolerate saline conditions. We hypothesized that these turtles would be unable to maintain homeostasis in the 15\% water treatment and would suffer osmotic loss of water, increased ionic concentrations and a decrease in body mass. Results revealed that these turtles had elevated plasma concentrations of sodium, chloride, urea and uric acid in the plasma. Plasma ionic concentrations increased proportionally more in E. macquarii than in C. expansa. Individuals of both species reduced feeding in 15\% water, indicating that behaviour may provide an additional means for freshwater turtles to limit ion/solute influx when in hyperosmotic environments. This osmoregulatory behaviour may allow for persistence of turtles in regions affected by salinization; however, growth rates and body condition may be affected in the long term. Although we demonstrate that these turtles have mechanisms to survive temporarily in saline waters, it is likely that sustained salinization of waterways will exceed their short-to medium-term capacity to survive increased salt levels, making salinization a potentially key threatening process for these freshwater reptiles.",2016,10.1093/conphys/cow042,4,NA,NA,cow042,chloride; salinization; salt; sodium; tortoise; urea

Sightings records, physiological models of aerobic performance and sea surface temperatures were used to assess the past and future thermal habitat suitability of the species. Climate change will exacerbate the negative effects associated with the introduction of non-indigenous species in marine ecosystems. Predicting the spread of invasive species in relation to environmental warming is therefore a fundamental task in ecology and conservation.The Baltic Sea is currently threatened by several local stressors and the highest increase in sea surface temperature of the world's large marine ecosystems. These new thermal conditions can further favour the spreading of the invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), a fish of Ponto-Caspian origin, currently well established in the southern and central parts of the Baltic Sea. This study aims to assess the thermal habitat suitability of the round goby in the Baltic Sea considering the past and future conditions. The study combines sightings records with known physiological models of aerobic performance and sea surface temperatures. Physiological models read these temperatures, at sighting times and locations, to determine their effects on the aerobic metabolic scope (AMS) of the fish, a measure of its energetic potential in relation to environmental conditions. The geographical mapping of the AMS was used to describe the changes in habitat suitability during the past 3 decades and for climatic predictions (until 2100) showing that the favourable thermal habitat in the Baltic Sea has increased during the past 32 years and will continue to do so in all the applied climate model predictions.

Zebrafish in the wild live in fluctuating thermal environments that potentially reach harmful temperatures. In the laboratory, zebrafish have gone through four decades of domestication and adaptation to stable optimal temperatures with few thermal extremes. If maintaining thermal tolerance is costly or if genetic traits promoting laboratory fitness at optimal temperature differ from genetic traits for high thermal tolerance, the thermal tolerance of laboratory zebrafish could be hypothesized to be lower than that of wild zebrafish. Furthermore, very little is known about the thermal environment of wild zebrafish and how close to their thermal limits they live. Here, we compared the acute upper thermal tolerance (critical thermal maxima; CTmax) of wild zebrafish measured on-site in West Bengal, India, to zebrafish at three laboratory acclimation/domestication levels: wild-caught, F-1 generation wild-caught and domesticated laboratory AB-WT line. We found that in the wild, CTmax increased with increasing site temperature. Yet at the warmest site, zebrafish lived very close to their thermal limit, suggesting that they may currently encounter lethal temperatures. In the laboratory, acclimation temperature appeared to have a stronger effect on CTmax than it did in the wild. The fish in the wild also had a 0.85-1.01 degrees C lower CTmax compared to all laboratory populations. This difference between laboratory-held and wild populations shows that environmental conditions can affect zebrafish's thermal tolerance. However, there was no difference in CTmax between the laboratory-held populations regardless of the domestication duration. This suggests that thermal tolerance is maintained during domestication and highlights that experiments using domesticated laboratory-reared model species can be appropriate for addressing certain questions on thermal tolerance and global warming impacts.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz036,7,NA,NA,coz036,Acclimation; critical thermal maxima; CTmax; Danio rerio; domestication

There has been a focus on identifying and explaining this variation at broad taxonomic scales, but more recently attention has shifted to examining patterns of intra-specific physiological variation. Here we examine geographic variation in the physiology of brushtail possums (Trichosurus), widely distributed Australian marsupials, and discuss how pertinent intra-specific variation may be to conservation physiology. We found significant geographical patterns in metabolism, body temperature, evaporative water loss and relative water economy. These patterns suggest that possums from warmer, drier habitats have more frugal energy and water use and increased capacity for heat loss at high ambient temperatures. Our results are consistent with environmental correlates for broad-scale macro-physiological studies, and most intra-generic and intra-specific studies of marsupials and other mammals. Most translocations of brushtail possums occur into Australia's arid zone, where the distribution and abundance of possums and other native mammals have declined since European settlement, leading to reintroduction programmes aiming to re-establish functional mammal communities. We suggest that the sub-species T. vulpecula hypoleucus from Western Australia would be the most physiologically appropriate for translocation to these arid habitats, having physiological traits most favourable for the extreme T-a, low and variable water availability and low productivity that characterize arid environments. Our findings demonstrate that geographically widespread populations can differ physiologically, and as a consequence some populations are more suitable for translocation to particular habitats than others.

Eucalyptus caesia subsp. caesia and E. ornata exhibit a highly localized distribution and a narrow geographical range, being restricted either to granite outcrops or the upper slopes and tops of lateritic rises, respectively. These two species were compared with the two widespread and dominant congenerics E. salmonophloia and E. salubris. There was a distinctive hump-shaped response of t(50) to temperature and an exponential response to water stress, characteristic of rate- and threshold-limited processes, but no consistent pattern in the response of G(max). The four species were significantly different in their thermal performance of t(50), with E. caesia and E. ornata displaying narrower thermal tolerance ranges than the two widespread species. In terms of mean final germination percentage, the two range-restricted endemic taxa exhibited higher lability in their response to thermal stress and drought stress compared to the two broadly distributed congenerics. These findings indicate a link between distributional extent, temperature and water stress tolerance and may have implications for identifying ecological filters of rarity and endemism.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa021,8,NA,NA,coaa021,Conservation; drought stress; performance model; seed germination; thermal tolerance; threatened flora
article,The environmental context of inducible HSP70 expression in Eastern Brook Trout,"Nguyen, V, Bao and O'Donnell, Brigid and Villamagna, Amy M.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Much research has focused on the population-level effects of climate change on Eastern Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). Whilesomestudies have considered here sub-lethal stress caused by warming waters, the role of multiple, interacting stressors remains largely unexplored. We used inducible heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) as a molecular biomarker to assess in situ response of Eastern Brook Trout in headwater streams to multiple potential stressors, including temperature. Over 7 sampling events during 2018 and 2019, we sampled 141 fish and found that HSP70 expression and 3- day mean water temperature exhibited a quadratic relationship (R-2-adj= 0.68). Further analyses showed that HSP70 expression was explained by temperature, relative water level and their interaction (R-2-adj= 0.75), while fish size and capture location were not factors. We observeda significant increase in HSP70 expression during periods of lowrelative water level withwarmtemperatures (similar to 18 degrees C) and also during high relative water level with cold temperatures (similar to 8 degrees C). Our results suggest that temperatures at the edges of the preferred range coupled with relative water level might act together to trigger the cellular stress response in Eastern Brook Trout and that there isgreater variation in response at colder temperatures. These findings reinforce the need toconsider complex, interactive stressors in influencing the health and persistence of Eastern Brook Trout populations into the future.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab022,9,NA,1-14,coab022,Cellular stress response; climate change; heat shock proteins; multiple stressors; Salvelinus fontinalis
article,Thermal tolerance and survival are modulated by a natural gradient of infection in differentially acclimated hosts,"De Bonville, Jeremy and Cote, Ariane and Binning, Sandra A.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"This study shows that different parasites may influence the thermal tolerance and the survival of their hosts, pumpkinseed sunfish, suggesting that such stressors are important to increase the ecological relevance of thermal tolerance studies of wild animals. Wild ectotherms are exposed to multiple stressors, including parasites, that can affect their responses to environmental change. Simultaneously, unprecedented warm temperatures are being recorded worldwide, increasing both the average and maximum temperatures experienced in nature. Understanding how ectotherms, such as fishes, will react to the combined stress of parasites and higher average temperatures can help predict the impact of extreme events such as heat waves on populations. The critical thermal method (CTM), which assesses upper (CTmax) and lower (CTmin) thermal tolerance, is often used in acclimated ectotherms to help predict their tolerance to various temperature scenarios. Despite the widespread use of the CTM across taxa, few studies have characterized the response of naturally infected fish to extreme temperature events or how acute thermal stress affects subsequent survival. We acclimated naturally infected pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus) to four ecologically relevant temperatures (10, 15, 20 and 25 degrees C) and one future warming scenario (30 degrees C) for 3 weeks before measuring CTmax and CTmin. We also assessed individual survival the week following CTmax. Parasites were counted and identified following trials to relate infection intensity to thermal tolerance and survival. Interestingly, trematode parasites causing black spot disease were negatively related to CTmax, suggesting that heavily infected fish are less tolerant to acute warming. Moreover, fish infected with yellow grub parasites showed decreased survival in the days following CTmax implying that the infection load has negative survival consequences on sunfish during extreme warming events. Our findings indicate that, when combined, parasite infection and high prolonged average temperatures can affect fish thermal tolerance and survival, emphasizing the need to better understand the concomitant effects of stressors on health outcomes in wild populations. This is especially true given that some parasite species are expected to thrive in warming waters making host fish species especially at risk.",2024,10.1093/conphys/coae015,12,1,NA,coae015,cestodes; climate change; concomitant stressors; critical thermal maximum; critical thermal minimum; endoparasites; freshwater fish; trematodes

However, the areal extent of P. fremontii cover has declined dramatically over the last century due to the effects of surface water diversions, non-native species invasions and more recently climate change. Consequently, P. fremontii gallery forests are considered amongst the most threatened forest types in North America. In this paper, we unify four conceptual areas of genes to ecosystems research related to P. fremontii's capacity to survive or even thrive under current and future environmental conditions: (i) hydraulic function related to canopy thermal regulation during heat waves; (ii) mycorrhizal mutualists in relation to resiliency to climate change and invasion by the non-native tree/shrub, Tamarix; (iii) phenotypic plasticity as a mechanism for coping with rapid changes in climate; and (iv) hybridization between P. fremontii and other closely related Populus species where enhanced vigour of hybrids may preserve the foundational capacity of Populus in the face of environmental change. We also discuss opportunities to scale these conceptual areas from genes to the ecosystem level via remote sensing. We anticipate that the exploration of these conceptual areas of research will facilitate solutions to climate change with a foundation species that is recognized as being critically important for biodiversity conservation and could serve as a model for adaptive management of arid regions in the southwestern USA and around the world.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa061,8,1,NA,coaa061,Canopy thermal regulation; hybridization; local adaptation; mycorrhizal mutualists; phenotypic plasticity; unmanned airborne remote sensing

B. and Nicotra, A. B.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"The life stages of seed germination and seedling establishment play a vital role in maintaining plant populations and determining range dynamics of species. Thus, it is not surprising that specific germination requirements and dormancy mechanisms have evolved in all major angiosperm clades. In a rapidly changing climate, we face growing pressure to manage, conserve and restore native plant species and communities. To achieve these aims, we require solid knowledge of whether and how seed germination requirements and dormancy status vary between different populations of a given species and how germination strategies may be affected by warming climatic conditions. We assessed the effect of decreasing durations of cold stratification (i.e. conditions representing a shortened winter as predicted under climate change) on germination and dormancy of the alpine herb Aciphylla glacialis. Our results confirmed previous research showing that A. glacialis seeds possess physiological dormancy that can be alleviated by cold stratification. In addition, the results demonstrated that A. glacialis seeds have underdeveloped embryos at dispersal; these grow to germinable size following 4-9 weeks at both constant 5 degrees C and 10-5 degrees C (day-night) temperatures. We conclude that A. glacialis exhibits morphophysiological dormancy. Furthermore, we found that the final percentage germination and dormancy status varied significantly among natural populations and that this variation did not correlate with elevation at the site of seed origin. Seeds germinated following 6-8 weeks of cold stratification, and seedlings showed no detrimental effects as a result of shorter stratification periods. Together, these results suggest that reduced duration of winter is unlikely to have direct negative impacts on germination or early seedling growth in A. glacialis.

To investigate conservation seed banking of these vulnerable species, we aimed to characterize their seed storage physiology by determining (i) seed desiccation tolerance and (ii) the effects of moisture content and storage temperature on seed germination and viability. Seeds of N. immutabilis, N. lukei, N. macrosperma and N. violacea (including multiple collections of three species) were placed in experimental storage at a range of temperatures (25 degrees C, 5 degrees C, -20 degrees C and -190 degrees C) following pre-equilibration at different RHs (15\%, 30\%, 50\%, 70\% or 95\%). Seeds were also experimentally aged at 60\% RH and 45 degrees C to assess comparative longevity. We found seeds of all species to be desiccation tolerant. However, the responses of seeds to experimental storage conditions were complex and variable between species and collections of the same species, and seeds of many species/collections were short-lived across many of the storage treatments. In many cases decreasing storage temperature did not increase longevity.

Conservation Physiology has emerged as a discipline that is well-positioned to identify the mechanisms underpinning population declines, predict responses to environmental change and test different in situ and ex situ conservation interventions for diverse taxa and ecosystems. Here we present a consensus list of 10 priority research themes. Within each theme we identify specific research questions (100 in total), answers to which will address conservation problems and should improve the management of biological resources.

article,"Extreme temperature combined with hypoxia, affects swimming performance in brown trout (<i>Salmo trutta</i>)","Nudds, Robert L. and Ozolina, Karlina and Fenkes, Miriam and Wearing, Oliver H. and Shiels, Holly A.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Climate change is predicted to impact freshwater aquatic environments through changes to water temperature (T-water), river flow and eutrophication. Riverine habitats contain many economically and ecologically important fishes. One such group is the migratory salmonids, which are sensitive to warm T-water and low O-2 (hypoxia). While several studies have investigated the independent effects of T-water and hypoxia on fish physiology, the combined effects of these stressors is less well known. Furthermore, no study has investigated the effects of T-water and O-2 saturation levels within the range currently experienced by a salmonid species. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the simultaneous effects of T-water and O-2 saturation level on the energetics and kinematics of steady-state swimming in brown trout, Salmo trutta. No effect of O-2 saturation level (70 and 100\% air saturation) on tail-beat kinematics was detected. Conversely, Twater (10, 14, 18 and 22 degrees C) did affect tail-beat kinematics, but a trade-off between frequency (f(tail)) and amplitude (A, maximum tail excursion) maintained the Strouhal number (St= f(tail)center dot A/U, where U is swimming speed) within the theoretically most mechanically efficient range. Swimming oxygen consumption rate ((M)over dot O-2) and cost of transport increased with both U and Twater. The only effect of O-2 saturation level was observed at the highest T-water (22 degrees C) and fastest swimming speed (two speeds were used-0.6 and 0.8 m s(-1)). As the extremes of this study are consistent with current summer conditions in parts of UK waterways, our findings may indicate that S. trutta will be negatively impacted by the increased T-water and reduced O-2 levels likely presented by anthropogenic climate change.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coz108,8,NA,NA,coz108,Climate change; energetics; fish; kinematics; locomotion; physiology
article,High sensitivity of a keystone forage fish to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and temperature,"Murray, Christopher S. and Wiley, David and Baumann, Hannes",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Sand lances of the genus Ammodytes are keystone forage fish in coastal ecosystems across the northern hemisphere. Because they directly support populations of higher trophic organisms such as whales, seabirds or tuna, the current lack of empirical data and, therefore, understanding about the climate sensitivity of sand lances represent a serious knowledge gap. Sand lances could be particularly susceptible to ocean warming and acidification because, in contrast to other tested fish species, they reproduce during boreal winter months, and their offspring develop slowly under relatively low and stable pCO(2) conditions. Over the course of 2 years, we conducted factorial pCO(2) x temperature exposure experiments on offspring of the northern sand lance Ammodytes dubius, a key forage species on the northwest Atlantic shelf. Wild, spawning-ripe adults were collected fromStellwagen BankNational Marine Sanctuary (CapeCod, USA), and fertilizedembryoswere reared at three pCO(2) conditions (400, 1000 and 2100 mu atm) crossed with three temperatures (5, 7 and 10 degrees C). Exposure to future pCO(2) conditions consistently resulted in severely reduced embryo survival. Sensitivity to elevated pCO(2) was highest at 10 degrees C, resulting in up to an 89\% reduction in hatching success between control and predicted end-of-century pCO(2) conditions. Moreover, elevated pCO(2) conditions delayed hatching, reduced remaining endogenous energy reserves at hatch and reduced embryonic growth. Our results suggest that the northern sand lance is exceptionally CO2-sensitive compared to other fish species. Whether other sand lance species with similar life history characteristics are equally CO2-sensitive is currently unknown. But the possibility is a conservation concern, because many boreal shelf ecosystems rely on sand lances and might therefore be more vulnerable to climate change than currently recognized. Our findings indicate that life history, spawning habitat, phenology and developmental rates mediate the divergent early life CO2 sensitivities among fish species.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz084,7,NA,NA,coz084,Ammodytes dubius; climate change; early life-history; ocean variability hypothesis; ocean acidification; multi-stressor experiment

Maartin and Hetem, Robyn S. and Mitchell, Duncan and Maloney, Shane K. and O'Brien, Haley D. and Meyer, Leith C. R. and Fuller, Andrea",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Some mammals have the ability to lower their hypothalamic temperature below that of carotid arterial blood temperature, a process termed selective brain cooling. Although the requisite anatomical structure that facilitates this physiological process, the carotid rete, is present in members of the Cetartiodactyla, Felidae and Canidae, the carotid rete is particularly well developed in the artiodactyls, e.g. antelopes, cattle, sheep and goats. First described in the domestic cat, the seemingly obvious function initially attributed to selective brain cooling was that of protecting the brain from thermal damage. However, hyperthermia is not a prerequisite for selective brain cooling, and selective brain cooling can be exhibited at all times of the day, even when carotid arterial blood temperature is relatively low. More recently, it has been shown that selective brain cooling functions primarily as a water-conservation mechanism, allowing artiodactyls to save more than half of their daily water requirements. Here, we argue that the evolutionary success of the artiodactyls may, in part, be attributed to the evolution of the carotid rete and the resulting ability to conserve body water during past environmental conditions, and we suggest that this group of mammals may therefore have a selective advantage in the hotter and drier conditions associated with current anthropogenic climate change.

Researchers often use glucocorticoid concentrations (hormones that can be associated with stressors) to gauge the impact of anthropogenic factors (e.g. urbanization, noise and light pollution). Yet, no general relationships between human-induced environmental change and glucocorticoids have emerged. Given the number of recent studies reporting baseline and stress-induced corticosterone (the primary glucocorticoid in birds and reptiles) concentrations worldwide, it is now possible to conduct large-scale comparative analyses to test for general associations between disturbance and baseline and stress-induced corticosterone across species. Additionally, we can control for factors that may influence context, such as life history stage, environmental conditions and urban adaptability of a species. Here, we take a phylogenetically informed approach and use data from HormoneBase to test if baseline and stress-induced corticosterone are valid indicators of exposure to human footprint index, human population density, anthropogenic noise and artificial light at night in birds and reptiles. Our results showa negative relationship between anthropogenic noise and baseline corticosterone for birds characterized as urban avoiders. While our results potentially indicate that urban avoiders are more sensitive to noise than other species, overall our study suggests that the relationship between human-induced environmental change and corticosterone varies across species and contexts; we found no general relationship between human impacts and baseline and stress-induced corticosterone in birds, nor baseline corticosterone in reptiles. Therefore, it should not be assumed that high or low levels of exposure to human-induced environmental change are associated with high or low corticosterone levels, respectively, or that closely related species, or even individuals, will respond similarly.

article,Can the impacts of cold-water pollution on fish be mitigated by thermal plasticity?,"Parisi, M. A. and Cramp, R. L. and Gordos, M. A. and Franklin, C. E.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Increasingly, cold-water pollution (CWP) is being recognised as a significant threat to aquatic communities downstream of large, bottom-release dams. Cold water releases typically occur during summer when storage dams release unseasonably cold and anoxic hypolimnetic waters, which can decrease the temperature of downstream waters by up to 16 degrees C. Depending on the release duration, these hypothermic conditions can persist for many months. The capacity of ectothermic species to tolerate or rapidly adjust to acute temperature changes may determine the nature and magnitude of the impact of CWP on affected species. This study assessed the impacts of an acute reduction in water temperature on the physiological function and locomotor performance of juvenile silver perch (Bidyanus bidyanus) and examined their capacity to thermally compensate for the depressive effects of low temperatures via phenotypic plasticity. Locomotor performance (Ucrit and Usprint) and energetic costs (routine and maximum metabolic rate) were measured at multiple points over a 10-week period following an abrupt 10 degrees C drop in water temperature. We also measured the thermal sensitivity of metabolic enzymes from muscle samples taken from fish following the exposure period. Cold exposure had significant depressive effects on physiological traits, resulting in decreases in performance between 10\% and 55\%. Although there was partial acclimation of Ucrit (similar to 35\% increase in performance) and complete compensation of metabolic rate, this occurred late in the exposure period, meaning silver perch were unable to rapidly compensate for the depressive effects of thermal pollution. The results of this study have substantial implications for the management of cold water releases from large-scale dams and the conservation of native freshwater fish species, as this form of thermal pollution can act as a barrier to fish movement, cause reduced recruitment, ecological community shifts and disruptions to timing and success of reproduction.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa005,8,NA,NA,coaa005,Cold-water pollution; conservation; metabolic rate; phenotypic plasticity; swimming performance; temperature

Salinity decreased biomass and photosynthesis, regardless of the salt stress level, but increased superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR) activity and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) content under 4 and 8 g/L NaCl and decreased all enzyme indices under 16 g/l NaCl stress.

article,Conditions influencing the appearance of thermal windows and the distribution of surface temperature in hauled-out southern elephant seals,"Guerrero, I, Alicia and Rogers, Tracey L. and Sepulveda, Maritza",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Pinnipeds (true seals, sea lions and walruses) inhabit two thermally different environments, air and water, so need to make continuous adjustments to maintain a balanced body temperature. The thermal isolation properties of thick blubber keep warmth within the body's core, ideal for mammals while in the water; however, when on land, this thick blubber makes it difficult to lose heat. Some pinnipeds use thermal windows, discrete patches where temperature changes on their body surface, as a mechanism to dissipate excessive heat. We identify the factors that correlate with the appearance of thermal windows and changes in body surface temperature on southern elephant seals, Mirounga leonina, while they are hauled out ashore. Infrared thermography was used to measure surface temperature of the seals. Temperature was lower on the torso than the flippers and head, suggesting that not all body sites have the same role in thermal balance. Air temperature was the main driver of variation in the surface temperature of the seals' flippers and head; seals cool their superficial tissues when the air temperature is below similar to 2 degrees C. This minimizes heat loss by reducing the thermal gradient between their skin and the ambient air. Wind speed was the main predictor of whether thermal windows appear on a seals' body surface. When wind speed was minimal, thermal windows occurred more often, which may be associated with either hair and skin drying, or producing thermal conditions for hair and skin regrowth. The type of aggregation (huddled or alone) influenced the surface temperature of the fore flippers; however, we did not find statistical influence of the seal's sex, state of moult, or the substrate on which they were hauled out (kelp or sand).

Ectothermic dive capacity is thermally sensitive, with dive durations significantly reduced by acute increases in water temperature; it is unclear whether diving performance can acclimate/acclimatize in response to long-term exposure to elevated water temperatures. We assessed the thermal sensitivity and plasticity of `fright-dive' capacity in juvenile estuarine crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus; n = 11). Crocodiles were exposed to one of three long-term thermal treatments, designed to emulate water temperatures under differing climate change scenarios (i.e. current summer, 28 degrees C; `moderate' climate warming, 31.5 degrees C; `high' climate warming, 35 degrees C). Dive trials were conducted in a temperature-controlled tank across a range of water temperatures. Dive durations were independent of thermal acclimation treatment, indicating a lack of thermal acclimation response. Acute increases in water temperature resulted in significantly shorter dive durations, with mean submergence times effectively halving with every 3.5 degrees C increase in water temperature (Q(10) 0.17, P < 0.001). Maximal dive performances, however, were found to be thermally insensitive across the temperature range of 28-35 degrees C. These results suggest that C. porosus have a limited or non-existent capacity to thermally acclimate sustained `fright-dive' performance.

Alveolar-arterial gradients were initially elevated, but decreased over time for all groups, although in KM lions it remained elevated (26.9 \& PLUSMN; 10.4 mmHg) above the expected normal. Overall, all three drug combinations caused minor respiratory and metabolic side-effects in the immobilized lions.

Because the seasonal and daily dynamics of physiological and biochemical traits of maquis species are not fully addressed, we performed a field study on three coexisting Mediterranean shrubs (Pistacia lentiscus L. and Phillyrea latifolia L., evergreen schlerophylls, and Cistus incanus L., semi-deciduous) aiming at detecting the main adaptive differences, on a seasonal and daily basis, in primary and secondary metabolism along with the principal climatic determinants. These species differed in their physiological and biochemical responses especially on a seasonal level. In P. latifolia, a great investment in antioxidant phenylpropanoids contributed to maintain high photosynthetic rates throughout the whole growing season. In C. incanus, high carotenoid content associated with chlorophyll (Chl) regulation alleviated oxidative damage during the hot and dry summers and help recover photosynthesis in autumn. In P. lentiscus, high abscisic acid levels allowed a strict control of stomata, while fine Chla/Chlb regulation concurred to avoid photoinhibition in summer.

article,Spatiotemporal variation in ecophysiological traits align with high resolution niche modelling in the short-range banded ironstone endemic Aluta quadrata,"Lewandrowski, Wolfgang and Tudor, Emily P. and Ajduk, Hayden and Tomlinson, Sean and Stevens, Jason C.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"We used species distribution modelling to estimate habitat suitability for the short range endemic, Aluta quadrata, in the arid northwest of Australia and conducted ecophysiological monitoring across different seasons. We found higher plant performance in the high-suitability site, providing evidence to support the species distribution model for A. quadrata. Defining plant ecophysiological responses across natural distributions enables a greater understanding of the niche that plants occupy. Much of the foundational knowledge of species' ecology and responses to environmental change across their distribution is often lacking, particularly for rare and threatened species, exacerbating management and conservation challenges. Combining high-resolution species distribution models (SDMs) with ecophysiological monitoring characterized the spatiotemporal variation in both plant traits and their interactions with their surrounding environment for the range-restricted Aluta quadrata Rye \& Trudgen, and a common, co-occurring generalist, Eremophila latrobei subsp. glabra (L.S.Sm.) Chinnock., from the semi-arid Pilbara and Gascoyne region in northwest Western Australia. The plants reflected differences in gas exchange, plant health and plant water relations at sites with contrasting suitability from the SDM, with higher performance measured in the SDM-predicted high-suitability site. Seasonal differences demonstrated the highest variation across ecophysiological traits in both species, with higher performance in the austral wet season across all levels of habitat suitability. The results of this study allow us to effectively describe how plant performance in A. quadrata is distributed across the landscape in contrast to a common, widespread co-occurring species and demonstrate a level of confidence in the habitat suitability modelling derived from the SDM in predicting plant function determined through intensive ecophysiology monitoring programmes. In addition, the findings also provide a baseline approach for future conservation actions, as well as to explore the mechanisms underpinning the short-range endemism arid zone systems.",2024,10.1093/conphys/coae030,12,1,NA,coae030,Chlorophyll fluorescence; conservation biology; drought; ecophysiology; edaphic factors; gas exchange; rare species; restoration; soil microclimate; water potential

We evaluated the relationships between apparent thermoregulatory behaviour and environmental, skin and core temperatures for tame savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana) that were free-ranging in the hot parts of the day, in their natural environment. Environmental temperature dictated elephant behaviour within a day, with potential consequences for fine-scale habitat selection, space use and foraging. At black globe temperatures of similar to 30 degrees C, elephants adjusted their behaviour to reduce environmental heat load and increase heat dissipation (e.g. shade use, wetting behaviour). Resting, walking and feeding were also influenced by environmental temperature. By relying on behavioural and autonomic adjustments, the elephants maintained homeothermy, even at environmental temperatures exceeding 40 degrees C. Elephants clearly have the capacity to deal with extreme heat, at least in environments with adequate resources of forage, water and shade.

article,Functional traits and drought strategy predict leaf thermal tolerance,"Valliere, Justin M. and Nelson, Kekoa C. and Martinez, Marco Castaneda",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Heat stress imposes an important physiological constraint on native plant species-one that will only worsen with human-caused climate change. Indeed, rising temperatures have already contributed to large-scale plant mortality events across the globe. These impacts may be especially severe in cities, where the urban heat island effect amplifies climate warming. Understanding how plant species will respond physiologically to rising temperatures and how these responses differ among plant functional groups is critical for predicting future biodiversity scenarios and making informed land management decisions. In this study, we evaluated the effects of elevated temperatures on a functionally and taxonomically diverse group of woody native plant species in a restored urban nature preserve in southern California using measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence as an indicator of leaf thermotolerance. Our aim was to determine if species' traits and drought strategies could serve as useful predictors of thermotolerance. We found that leaf thermotolerance differed among species with contrasting drought strategies, and several leaf-level functional traits were significant predictors of thermotolerance thresholds. Drought deciduous species with high specific leaf area, high rates of transpiration and low water use efficiency were the most susceptible to heat damage, while evergreen species with sclerophyllous leaves, high relative water content and high water use efficiency maintained photosynthetic function at higher temperatures. While these native shrubs and trees are physiologically equipped to withstand relatively high temperatures in this Mediterranean-type climate, hotter conditions imposed by climate change and urbanization may exceed the tolerance thresholds of many species. We show that leaf functional traits and plant drought strategies may serve as useful indicators of species' vulnerabilities to climate change, and this information can be used to guide restoration and conservation in a warmer world.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad085,11,1,NA,coad085,Chlorophyll fluorescence; climate change; ecophysiology; functional traits; heat stress; Mediterranean ecosystems; photosynthesis; temperature response curves

Sockeye salmon juveniles experience both low-oxygen water in profundal lake habitats and elevated temperatures above the thermocline during diel vertical migrations in summer and fall when the lake is thermally stratified. We used a transcriptomic tool (Salmon Fit-Chip) to determine whether salmon were experiencing thermal and/or hypoxic stress during this period. The results showed that over one-third of the fish were responding to either hypoxic (35.5\%) or thermal stress (40.9\%) during periods when these environmental stressors were pronounced within the lake, but not during periods when profundal dissolved oxygen was elevated and the water column was isothermal and cool. The most consistent signs of hypoxic stress occurred during July (52.2\%) and September (44.4\%). A total of 25.7\% of individual fish sampled during months when both stressors were occurring (July, September, October) showed signatures of both stressors. When a combination of hypoxic and thermal stress biomarkers was applied, 92\% of fish showed evidence of one or both stressors; hence, for at least several months of the year, most sockeye salmon juveniles in Cultus Lake are experiencing anthropogenically environmentally induced stress. We also detected the presence of pathogenic ciliate Ichthyoptherius multifiliis in the gill tissue of juveniles, with a higher infection signal in Cultus Lake compared to juveniles from nearby Chilliwack Lake. These data provide powerful new evidence that Cultus Lake sockeye salmon, which experience relatively lower juvenile survival than Chilliwack sockeye salmon, are more compromised by stress and carry a higher level of infection of at least one pathogenic agent. Thus, we hypothesize that the cumulative or synergistic interplay between stressors and diseases, clearly documented to be occurring within Cultus Lake, are contributing to increased mortality of endangered sockeye salmon.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab089,9,NA,NA,coab089,thermal stress; sockeye salmon; pathogen; hypoxia; Cultus Lake; Biomarker

Anuran larvae experiencing environmental stress may display altered thyroid hormone (TH) status with potential implications for physiological traits. Therefore, any capacity to adapt to environmental changes through plastic responses provides a key to determining species vulnerability to environmental variation. We investigated whether developmental temperature (T-dev ), altered TH levels and whether the interactive effect of both affect standard metabolic rate (SMR), body condition (BC), survival and thermal tolerance in larvae of the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) reared at five temperatures with experimentally altered TH levels. At metamorphosis, SMR, BC and survival were significantly affected by T-d(ev) , TH status and their interaction with the latter often intensified impacts. Larvae developing at warmer temperatures exhibited significantly higher SMRs and BC was reduced at warm T-d(ev) and high TH levels suggesting decreased ability to acclimate to variation in temperature. Accordingly, tadpoles that developed at warm temperatures had higher maximum thermal limits but more narrow thermal tolerance windows. High and low TH levels decreased and increased upper thermal limits, respectively. Thus, when experiencing both warmer temperatures and environmental stress, larvae may be less able to compensate for changes in T-d(ev) . Our results demonstrate that physiological traits in larvae of X. laevis are strongly affected by increased TH levels and warmer temperatures. Altered TH levels and increasing T-dev due to global change may result in a reduced capacity for physiological plasticity. This has far reaching consequences since the energetic requirement at the onset of metamorphosis is known to determine metamorphic success and thus, is indirectly linked to individual fitness in later life stages.",2018,10.1093/conphys/coy059,6,NA,NA,coy059,Climate change; metabolic costs; metamorphosis; standard metabolic rate (SMR); thermal tolerance

Although ecological characteristics facilitating the establishment and spread of non-native species are widely recognized, little is known about organismal attributes underlying invasion success. In this study, we tested the effect of thermal acclimation on thermal tolerance and locomotor performance in the invasive Xenopus laevis and the Chilean native Calyptocephalella gayi. In particular, the maximal righting performance (mu(MAX)), optimal temperature (T-O), lower (CTmin) and upper critical thermal limits (CTmax), thermal breadth (T-br) and the area under the performance curve (AUC) were studied after 6 weeks acclimation to 10 and 20 degrees C. We observed higher values of mu(max) and AUC in X. laevis in comparison to C. gayi. On the contrary, the invasive species showed lower values of CTmin in comparison to the native one. In contrast, CTmax, T-O and T-br showed no interspecific differences. Moreover, we found that both species have the ability to acclimate their locomotor performance and lower thermal tolerance limit at low temperatures. Our results demonstrate that X. laevis is a better performer than C. gayi. Although there were differences in CTmin, the invasive and native frogs did not differ in their thermal tolerance. Interestingly, in both species the lower and upper critical thermal limits are beyond the minimal and maximal temperatures encountered in nature during the coldest and hottest month, respectively.

Whether any consistent patterns exist in the interactive effects of rates of temperature change (or experimental ramping rates) and acclimation on critical thermal limits and warming tolerance (one way of assessing sensitivity to climate change) is, however, far from clear. Here, we examine the interacting effects of ramping rate and acclimation on the critical thermal maxima (CTmax) and minima (CTmin) and warming tolerance of six species of springtails from sub-tropical, temperate and polar regions. We also provide microhabitat temperatures from 26 sites spanning 5 years in order to benchmark environmentally relevant rates of temperature change. Ramping rate has larger effects than acclimation on CTmax, but the converse is true for CTmin. Responses to rate and acclimation effects are more consistent among species for CTmax than for CTmin. In the latter case, interactions among ramping rate and acclimation are typical of polar species, less marked for temperate ones, and reduced in species from the sub-tropics. Ramping rate and acclimation have substantial effects on estimates of warming tolerance, with the former being more marked. At the fastest ramping rates (>1.0 degrees C/min), tropical species have estimated warming tolerances similar to their temperate counterparts, whereas at slow ramping rates (<0.4 degrees C/min) the warming tolerance is much reduced in tropical species. Rates of temperate change in microhabitats relevant to the springtails are typically <0.05 degrees C/min, with rare maxima of 0.3-0.5 degrees C/min depending on the site.

article,Habitat-specific responses of leaf traits to soil water conditions in species from a novel alpine swamp meadow community,"Li, Honglin and Nicotra, Adrienne B. and Xu, Danghui and Du, Guozhen",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Species originally from alpine wetland and alpine meadow communities now coexist in a novel `alpine swamp meadow' community as a consequence of wetland drying in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Considering the projected increase in the fluctuation of water supply from precipitation during the growing season in this area in the future, it is important to investigate the responses of the species that make up this new community to soil water availability. Using a transplant experimental design, we compared the response of leaf traits and growth to different water conditions for species grouped according to their original habitat of wetland or meadow. Twelve perennial herbaceous species, which form an alpine swamp meadow community in Maqu County in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, were used in this study and subjected to two water treatments, namely waterlogged and dry-down. Overall, significant differences in leaf production in response to soil water availability were found for these two groups, indicating strongly different effects of water availability on their growth. Furthermore, the meadow group had lower specific leaf area, leaf area and relative leaf water content, but thicker leaves than those of the wetland group, indicating significant habitat-specific differences in leaf morphology. Regarding physiological traits, the wetland group had significantly higher photosynthetic rates in inundated conditions, whereas for the meadow group the photosynthetic rate was greatest in cyclically dry conditions. Likewise, a similar pattern was observed for stomatal conductance; however, both groups achieved higher instantaneous water use efficiency during the dry-down treatment. The results of this study indicate that the composition of the alpine swamp meadow could be sensitive to changes in precipitation and might be changed substantially by future declines in water supply, as predicted by global climate change models for this region.

In particular, warm rivers are associated with high levels of premature mortality in migrating adults. The Fraser River watershed in British Columbia, Canada, supports some of the largest Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) runs in the world. However, the Fraser River is warming at a rate that threatens these populations at critical freshwater life stages. A growing body of literature suggests salmonids are locally adapted to their thermal migratory experience, and thus, population-specific thermal performance information can aid in management decisions. We compared the thermal performance of pre-spawning adult Chinook salmon from two populations, a coastal fall-run from the Chilliwack River (125 km cooler migration) and an interior summer-run from the Shuswap River (565 km warmer migration). We acutely exposed fish to temperatures reflecting current (12 degrees C, 18 degrees C) and future projected temperatures (21 degrees C, 24 degrees C) in the Fraser River and assessed survival, aerobic capacity (resting and maximum metabolic rates, absolute aerobic scope (AAS), muscle and ventricle citrate synthase), anaerobic capacity (muscle and ventricle lactate dehydrogenase) and recovery capacity (post-exercise metabolism, blood physiology, tissue lactate). Chilliwack Chinook salmon performed worse at high temperatures, indicated by elevated mortality, reduced breadth in AAS, enhanced plasma lactate and potassium levels and elevated tissue lactate concentrations compared with Shuswap Chinook salmon. At water temperatures exceeding the upper pejus temperatures (T-pejus, defined here as 80\% of maximum AAS) of Chilliwack (18.7 degrees C) and Shuswap (20.2 degrees C) Chinook salmon populations, physiological performance will decline and affect migration and survival to spawn. Our results reveal population differences in pre-spawning Chinook salmon performance across scales of biological organization at ecologically relevant temperatures. Given the rapid warming of rivers, we show that it is critical to consider the intra-specific variation in thermal physiology to assist in the conservation and management of Pacific salmon. Warming water temperatures threaten aquatic species and impact economies and cultures. Yet, vulnerability can vary within a species. We assessed the thermal performance of two populations of pre-spawning adult Chinook salmon and found that an interior summer-run population of Chinook salmon performed better at warmer temperatures than a coastal fall-run population.

In contrast, the widespread exotic bunchgrass, crested wheatgrass, readily produces viable seed cohorts. The mechanisms underlying these differences are unclear. To address this, we measured seed head specific mass (g m(-2)) and net photosynthetic assimilation (A(net)) as a function of internal {[}CO2] (A/C-i curves) in preand post-anthesis seed heads and flag leaves of crested wheatgrass and four native bunchgrasses to determine if differences in allocation and photosynthetic characteristics of seed heads was consistent with differential reproductive success. Crested wheatgrass seed heads had 2-fold greater specific mass compared to the native grasses, concurrent with greater CO2-saturated photosynthesis (A(max)), mesophyll carboxylation efficiency (CE), and higher intrinsic water-use efficiency (WUEi; A(net)/stomatal conductance (g(s))), but with similar relative stomatal limitations to photosynthesis (RSL). Post-anthesis seed head Amax, CE, RSL and g(s) decreased in native grasses, while crested wheatgrass RSL decreased and CE increased dramatically, likely due to tighter coordination between seed head structural changes with stomatal and biochemical dynamics. Our results suggest native sagebrush-steppe bunchgrasses have greater stomatal and structural constraints to reproductive photosynthesis, while the exotic grass has evolved seed heads functionally similar to leaves. This study shows elucidating reproduction-related ecophysiological mechanisms provide understanding of plant attributes that underlie restoration success and could help guide the development of native plant materials with functional attributes needed to overcome demographic bottlenecks that limit their restoration into degraded sagebrush-steppe.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz112,7,NA,NA,coz112,A/C-i curves; A(max); carboxylation efficiency; crested wheatgrass; relative stomatal limitation; sagebrush-steppe

E. and Hicks, Brendan J. and Franklin, Paul A.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Our study examined how temperature differences affect critical swimming speeds of four migratory species. Higher temperatures (26 degrees C) significantly reduced swimming speeds for three species, emphasizing the need for fish passage solutions that consider temperature fluctuations. This is crucial for habitat restoration and freshwater fish preservation, especially in a changing climate. Anthropogenic structures in freshwater systems pose a significant threat by fragmenting habitats. Effective fish passage solutions must consider how environmental changes introduce variability into swimming performance. As temperature is considered the most important external factor influencing fish physiology, it is especially important to consider its effects on fish swimming performance. Even minor alterations in water properties, such as temperature and velocity, can profoundly affect fish metabolic demands, foraging behaviours, fitness and, consequently, swimming performance and passage success. In this study, we investigated the impact of varying water temperatures on the critical swimming speeds of four migratory New Zealand species. Our findings revealed a significant reduction in critical swimming speeds at higher water temperatures (26 degrees C) compared to lower ones (8 and 15 degrees C) for three out of four species (Galaxias maculatus, Galaxias brevipinnis and Gobiomorphus cotidianus). In contrast, Galaxias fasciatus exhibited no significant temperature-related changes in swimming performance, suggesting species-specific responses to temperature. The cold temperature treatment did not impact swimming performance for any of the studied species. As high water temperatures significantly reduce fish swimming performance, it is important to ensure that fish passage solutions are designed to accommodate a range of temperature changes, including spatial and temporal changes, ranging from diel to decadal fluctuations. Our research underscores the importance of incorporating temperature effects into fish passage models for habitat restoration, connectivity initiatives, and freshwater fish conservation. The influence of temperature on fish swimming performance can alter migration patterns and population dynamics, highlighting the need for adaptive conservation strategies.

The widespread cultivation of this plant worldwide may have led to populations with different physiological and biochemical traits. In this work, the impact of water stress on the physiology and biochemistry of two M. oleifera populations, one from Chaco Paraguayo (PY) and one from Indian Andhra Pradesh (IA) region, was studied in a screenhouse experiment where the water stress treatment was followed by re-watering. Through transcriptome sequencing, 2201 potential genic simple sequence repeats were identified and used to confirm the genetic differentiation of the two populations. Both populations of M. oleifera reduced photosynthesis, water potential, relative water content and growth under drought, compared to control well-watered plants. A complete recovery of photosynthesis after re-watering was observed in both populations, but growth parameters recovered better in PY than in IA plants. During water stress, PY plants accumulated more secondary metabolites, especially f-carotene and phenylpropanoids, than IA plants, but IA plants invested more into xanthophylls and showed a higher de-epoxidation state of xanthophylls cycle that contributed to protect the photosynthetic apparatus. M. oleifera demonstrated a high genetic variability and phenotypic plasticity, which are key factors for adaptation to dry environments. A higher plasticity (e.g. in PY plants adapted to wet environments) will be a useful trait to endure recurrent but brief water stress episodes, whereas long-term investment of resources into secondary metabolism (e.g. in IA plants adapted to drier environments) will be a successful strategy to cope with prolonged periods of drought.

To test the hypothesis that physiological status is altered by stress conditioning, we subjected juvenile Pacific geoduck, Panopea generosa, to repeated exposures of elevated pCO(2) in a commercial hatchery setting followed by a period in ambient common garden. Respiration rate and shell lengthwere measured for juvenile geoduck periodically throughout short-term repeated reciprocal exposure periods in ambient (similar to 550 mu atm) or elevated (similar to 2400 mu atm) pCO(2) treatments and in common, ambient conditions, 5 months after exposure. Short-term exposure periods comprised an initial 10-day exposure followed by 14 days in ambient before a secondary 6-day reciprocal exposure. The initial exposure to elevated pCO(2) significantly reduced respiration rate by 25\% relative to ambient conditions, but no effect on shell growth was detected. Following 14 days in common garden, ambient conditions, reciprocal exposure to elevated or ambient pCO(2) did not alter juvenile respiration rates, indicating ability for metabolic recovery under subsequent conditions. Shell growth was negatively affected during the reciprocal treatment in both exposure histories; however, clams exposed to the initial elevated pCO(2) showed compensatory growth with 5.8\% greater shell length (on average between the two secondary exposures) after 5 months in ambient conditions. Additionally, clams exposed to the secondary elevated pCO(2) showed 52.4\% increase in respiration rate after 5 months in ambient conditions.

Grant and Hipfner, J. Mark and Petersen, Aevar and Shutler, Dave",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Most Arctic marine birds are migratory, wintering south of the limit of annual pack ice and returning north each year for the physiologically stressful breeding season. The Arctic environment is changing rapidly due to global warming and anthropogenic activities, which may influence the timing of breeding in relation to arrival times following migration, as well as providing additional stressors (e.g. disturbance from ships) to which birds may respond. During stressful parts of their annual cycle, such as breeding, birds may reallocate resources so that they have increased heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratios in their white blood cell (leucocyte) profiles. We analysed leucocyte profiles of nine species of marine birds to establish reference ranges for these species in advance of future Arctic change. Leucocyte profiles tended to cluster among taxonomic groups across studies, suggesting that reference values for a particular group can be established, and within species there was evidence that birds from colonies that had to migrate farther had higher heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratios during incubation than those that did not have to travel as far, particularly for species with high wing loading.",2015,10.1093/conphys/cov028,3,NA,NA,cov028,Heterophil; leucocyte; lymphocyte; marine bird; stress
article,The heat is on: sensitivity of goldsinny wrasse to global climate change,"Perry, Diana and Tamarit, Elena and Morgenroth, Daniel and Grans, Albin and Sturve, Joachim and Gullstrom, Martin and Thor, Peter and Wennhage, Hakan",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Unsustainable harvesting practices have drastically reduced fish populations globally and developments in aquaculture have increased. Unexpectedly, Atlantic salmon farming caused the opening of a new fishery in northern European countries, where previously unharvested mesopredatory species, like the goldsinny wrasse (Ctenolabrus rupestris), are captured for use as cleaner fish in pens along the coast and fjords. The goldsinny wrasse is widespread in coastal areas where it plays an ecologically important role as a predator of small invertebrates. Since climate change effects are particularly pronounced in coastal waters, it becomes urgent to understand how fish like the goldsinny will respond to global climate change, including the increasing frequency and intensity of marine heatwaves (MHWs), ocean freshening (OF) and ocean acidification (OA). To address this, we conducted a multi-stressor experiment exposing adult goldsinny to each stressor individually, as well as to all three combined. The results indicated that the goldsinny is highly affected by MHWs and extremely sensitive to a multi-stressor environment, with 34\% and 53\% mortality, respectively. Additionally, exposure to a MHW event, OF and multi-stressor conditions affected fish metabolism, with the highest standard metabolic- and maximum metabolic-oxygen consumption rates observed for the MHW treatment. Increases in oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and percent oxidized glutathione (\% GSSG) in the livers, indicative of oxidative stress, were also seen in the MHW, OF and multi-stressor treatments. As a single stressor, OA showed no significant impacts on the measured parameters. This information is important for conservation of coastal marine environments, given the species' important role in shallow-water habitats and for management of goldsinny or other mesopredatory fish harvested in coastal ecosystems. The sensitivity of the goldsinny wrasse to future stressors is of concern, and any potential reductions in abundance as a result of climate change may lead to cascade effects with ecosystem-wide consequences. Our findings show clear evidence of physiological stress on fish caused from exposure to global climate change, with marine heatwaves and the cumulative effects of multiple stressors leading to substantial mortality (potentially over 50\%) for the ecologically important goldsinny wrasse.",2024,10.1093/conphys/coae068,12,1,NA,coae068,Climate change; Ctenolabrus rupestris; cumulative effects; marine heatwave; multi-stressor experiment; ocean acidification; physiology; salinity

We identified stress responses in salmon exposed to high water temperatures, including evidence of DNA damage, increased pathogen exposure and altered heart function. Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) declines are widespread and may be attributed, at least in part, to warming river temperatures. Water temperatures in the Yukon River and tributaries often exceed 18 degrees C, a threshold commonly associated with heat stress and elevated mortality in Pacific salmon. Untangling the complex web of direct and indirect physiological effects of heat stress on salmon is difficult in a natural setting with innumerable system challenges but is necessary to increase our understanding of both lethal and sublethal impacts of heat stress on populations. The goal of this study was to characterize the cellular stress response in multiple Chinook salmon tissues after acute elevated temperature challenges. We conducted a controlled 4-hour temperature exposure (control, 18 degrees C and 21 degrees C) experiment on the bank of the Yukon River followed by gene expression (GE) profiling using a 3 `-Tag-RNA-Seq protocol. The full transcriptome was analysed for 22 Chinook salmon in muscle, gill and liver tissue. Both the 21 degrees C and 18 degrees C treatments induced greater activity in genes associated with protein folding (e.g. HSP70, HSP90 mRNA) processes in all tissues. Global GE patterns indicate that transcriptomic responses to heat stress were highly tissue-specific, underscoring the importance of analyzing multiple tissues for determination of physiological effect. Primary superclusters (i.e. groupings of loosely related terms) of altered biological processes were identified in each tissue type, including regulation of DNA damage response (gill), regulation by host of viral transcription (liver) and regulation of the force of heart contraction (muscle) in the 21 degrees C treatment. This study provides insight into mechanisms potentially affecting adult Chinook salmon as they encounter warm water during their spawning migration in the Yukon River and suggests that both basic and more specialized cellular functions may be disrupted.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa084,8,1,NA,coaa084,Chinook salmon; transcriptome analysis; heat stress; Yukon River
article,Simultaneous exposure to nitrate and low pH reduces the blood oxygen-carrying capacity and functional performance of a freshwater fish,"Isaza, Daniel F. Gomez and Cramp, Rebecca L. and Franklin, Craig E.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Human activities present aquatic species with numerous of environmental challenges, including excessive nutrient pollution (nitrate) and altered pH regimes (freshwater acidification). In isolation, elevated nitrate and acidic pH can lower the blood oxygen-carrying capacity of aquatic species and cause corresponding declines in key functional performance traits such as growth and locomotor capacity. These factors may pose considerable physiological challenges to organisms but little is known about their combined effects. To characterise the energetic and physiological consequences of simultaneous exposure to nitrate and lowpH, we exposed spangled perch (Leiopotherapon unicolor) to a combination of nitrate (0, 50 or 100 mg L-1) and pH (pH 7.0 or 4.0) treatments in a factorial experimental design. Blood oxygen-carrying capacity (haemoglobin concentration, methaemoglobin concentrations and oxygen equilibrium curves), aerobic scope and functional performance traits (growth, swimming performance and post-exercise recovery) were assessed after 28 days of exposure. The oxygen-carrying capacity of fish exposed to elevated nitrate (50 and 100 mg L-1) was compromised due to reductions in haematocrit, functional haemoglobin levels and a 3-fold increase in methaemoglobin concentrations. Oxygen uptake was also impeded due to a right shift in oxygen-haemoglobin binding curves of fish exposed to nitrate and pH 4.0 simultaneously. A reduced blood oxygen-carrying capacity translated to a lowered aerobic scope, and the functional performance of fish (growth and swimming performance and increased post-exercise recovery times) was compromised by the combined effects of nitrate and low pH. These results highlight the impacts on aquatic organisms living in environments threatened by excessive nitrate and acidic pH conditions.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coz092,8,NA,NA,coz092,Aerobic scope; blood; blood oxygen affinity; ecotoxicology; methaemoglobin; swimming performance
article,Soil moisture and temperature drive emergence delays associated with fire seasonality in eucalypt forests,"Ryan, Casey and Callow, John Nikolaus and Lewandrowski, Wolfgang and Tangney, Ryan",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Many ecosystems are well adapted to fire, although the impacts of fire seasonality and its effect on post-fire recruitment are less well understood. Late summer or autumn fires within eucalypt forests with a Mediterranean-type climate allow for seedling emergence during the cooler and wetter seasons. The emergence and survival after spring fires may be impacted by higher soil temperatures and water stress, delaying recruitment until the subsequent winter period. During this delay, seeds may be exposed to predation and decay, which reduce the viable seed bank. This study examines post-fire recruitment dynamics in a eucalypt forest ecosystem (Northern Jarrah Forest (NJF) of southwestern Western Australia) and whether it may be vulnerable to human-induced changes to fire season. Here, we compare in situ post-fire seedling emergence patterns between autumn and spring burns and account for a potential ecological mechanism driving seasonal differences in emergence by determining the thermal germination requirements of seeds for 15 common species from the NJF. Our results demonstrate that 93\% of species had thermal optima between 10 degrees C and 20 degrees C, analogous with soil temperatures measured during the germination window (late April to October). Concurrent in situ post-fire emergence was highest 144 days after an autumn (seasonal) fire, followed by a 10-72\% decline. In contrast, there was no emergence within the first 200 days following a spring (aseasonal) fire. We conclude that aseasonal fire in the NJF can lead to a complete delay in recruitment in the first season post-fire, resulting in a lower inter-fire growth period and increasing the potential for further reductions in recruitment through seed predation and decay. The study suggests that aseasonal fire has an immediate and significant impact on initial recruitment in the NJF, but further research is required to determine any longer-term effects of this delay and its implications for fire management in southwestern Western Australia.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad093,11,1,NA,coad093,Australia; ecology; fire; germination; phenology; recruitment

G. and Wilson, Alexander D. M. and Cooke, Steven J.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Release of fish captured by recreational anglers is a common practice due to angler conservation ethics or compliance with fisheries regulations. As such, there is a need to understand the factors that influence mortality and sub-lethal impairments to ensure that catch-and-release angling is a sustainable practice. Longer angling times generally contribute to increased stress and mortality in fish such that reducing these times putatively reduces stress and improves survival. However, the relative importance of fight intensity (rather than simply duration) on fish condition is poorly understood. The objective of this research was to examine the effects of fight intensity on physiological stress and reflex impairment of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). The largemouth bass were angled using conventional recreational fishing gear in May (water temperature similar to 12 degrees C) and June (similar to 22 degrees C) of 2014 in Lake Opinicon, Ontario, Canada. Fight intensity was quantified using tri-axial accelerometer loggers mounted on the tips of fishing rods. Upon capture, reflex impairment measures were assessed, and fish were held for 1 h prior to blood sampling for measurement of physiological stress (blood glucose and lactate concentrations and pH). Physiological stress values showed a negative trend with fight duration and total fight intensity, but a positive trend with average fight intensity. Water temperature emerged as the most important predictor of the stress response in large-mouth bass, while fight duration and intensity were not strong predictors. Reflex impairment was minimal, but higher reflex impairment scores were associated with elevated blood glucose. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that angling for largemouth bass at colder temperatures (<15 degrees C) causes greater physiological stress than at warmer temperatures (>20 degrees C). Based on our findings, we conclude that fight intensity is likely not to be a major driver of physiological stress in this species using typical largemouth bass angling gear, owing to the relatively short fight times (i.e. <2 min).",2014,10.1093/conphys/cou057,2,1,NA,cou057,Accelerometer; angling; fishing; largemouth bass; reflex impairment; stress physiology

We compared blood pH values measured using a portable, waterproof pH meter (Hanna Instruments HI 99161) with blood pH values measured by an i- STAT system (CG4+ cartridges), which was previously validated for teleost and elasmobranch fishes, to gauge the accuracy of the pH meter in determining whole blood pH for the Cuban dogfish (Squalus cubensis) and lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris). There was a significant linear relationship between values derived via the pH meter and the i- STAT for both species across a wide range of pH values and temperatures (Cuban dogfish: 6.8-7.1 pH 24-30 degrees C; lemon sharks: 7.0-7.45 pH 25-31 degrees C). The relative error in the pH meter's measurements was similar to +/- 2.7\%.

With finite access to oxygen, these species need to be capable of extended aerobic exercise and conservation of energy. Pinnipeds must deal with common physiological hurdles, such as hypoxia, exhaustion and acidosis, that are common to all exercising mammals. The physiological mechanisms in marine mammals used for managing oxygen and carbon dioxide have sparked much research, but access to animals and tissues is difficult and requires permits. Deceased animals that are either bycaught or stranded provide one potential source for tissues, but the validity of biochemical data from post-mortem samples has not been rigorously assessed. Tissues collected from stranded diving mammals may be a crucial source to add to our limited knowledge on the physiology of some of these animals and important to the conservation and management of these species. We aim to determine the reliability of biochemical assays derived from post-mortem tissue and to promote the immediate sampling of stranded animals for the purpose of physiological research. In this study, we mapped the temporal degradation of muscle enzymes from biopsied Northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) and highlight recommendations for storage protocols for the best preservation of tissue. We also compared the enzymatic activity of different muscle groups (pectoral and latissimus dorsi) in relation to locomotion and measured the effects of four freeze-thaw cycles on muscle tissue enzyme function. Results indicate that enzymatic activity fluctuates greatly, especially with varying storage temperature, storage time, species and muscle group being assayed. In contrast, proteins, such as myoglobin, remain relatively continuous in their increase at 4 degrees C for 48 h.

One of the primary challenges in trait-based ecology is understanding the patterns and processes underpinning functional trait variation in plants. Studying intraspecific variation of functional traits across latitudinal gradients offers an excellent in situ approach to assess associations with environmental factors, which naturally covary along these spatial scales such as the local climate and soil profiles. Therefore, we examined how climatic and edaphic conditions varied across a similar to 160-km latitudinal gradient to understand how these conditions were associated with the physiological performance and morphological expression within five spatially distinct populations spanning the latitudinal distribution of a model species (Stylidium hispidum Lindl.). Northern populations had patterns of trait means reflecting water conservation strategies that included reduced gas exchange, rosette size and floral investment compared to the southern populations. Redundancy analysis, together with variance partitioning, showed that climate factors accounted for a significantly greater portion of the weighted variance in plant trait data (22.1\%; adjusted R-2 = 0.192) than edaphic factors (9.3\%; adjusted R-2 = 0.08). Disentangling such independent and interactive abiotic drivers of functional trait variation will deliver key insights into the mechanisms underpinning local adaptation and population-level responses to current and future climates.",2024,10.1093/conphys/coae018,12,1,NA,coae018,Climate change; environment-trait relationships; intraspecific trait variation; morphology; physiology; soil; Stylidium
article,UV exposure causes energy trade- offs leading to increased chytrid fungus susceptibility in green tree frog larvae,"Cramp, Rebecca L. and Ohmer, Michel E. B. and Franklin, Craig E.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Levels of ultraviolet (UV) radiation have increased in many parts of the world due to the anthropogenic destruction of the ozone layer. UV radiation is a potent immunosuppressant and can increase the susceptibility of animal hosts to pathogens. UV radiation can directly alter immune function via immunosuppression and photoimmunotolerance; however, UV may also influence pathogen defences by affecting the distribution of energy resources among competing physiological processes. Both defence against UV damage and repair of incurred damage, as well as the maintenance of immune defences and responding to an immune challenge, are energetically expensive. These competing demands for finite energy resources could trade off against one another, resulting in sub-optimal performance in one or both processes. We examined the potential for a disease-related energy trade-off in green tree frog (Litoria caerulea) larvae. Larvae were reared under high- or low-UV conditions for 12 weeks during which time we measured growth rates, metabolic rate and susceptibility to the amphibian fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). We found that larvae exposed to high levels of UV radiation had higher rates of energy expenditure than those exposed to low UV levels; however, UV exposure did not affect growth rates or developmental timings. Larvae exposed to high UV radiation also experienced greater Bd infection rates and carried a higher infection burden than those not exposed to elevated UV radiation. We propose that the increased energetic costs of responding to UV radiation were traded off against immune defences to protect larval growth rates. These findings have important implications for the aetiology of some Bd-associated amphibian declines, particularly in montane environments where Bd infections are most severe and where UV levels are highest.",2022,10.1093/conphys/coac038,10,1,NA,coac038,trade-off; pathogen; metabolism; energy; disease
article,Assessing the effects of a drought experiment on the reproductive phenology and ecophysiology of a wet tropical rainforest community,"Vogado, Nara and Laurance, Susan G. and Liddell, Michael J. and Engert, Jayden E. and Wurster, Christopher M. and Schiffer, Michele and Thompson, Andrew and Nichols, Cassandra and Cernusak, Lucas A.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"In this study we assessed the effects of an experimental drought on the reproductive phenology and ecophysiology of a rainforest tree community in the Wet Tropics of Queensland. We found that, although the drought increased fruiting activity in the community relative to the reference plot, species-level response was varied in both phenology and physiology. Climate change is expected to increase the intensity and occurrence of drought in tropical regions, potentially affecting the phenology and physiology of tree species. Phenological activity may respond to a drying and warming environment by advancing reproductive timing and/or diminishing the production of flowers and fruits. These changes have the potential to disrupt important ecological processes, with potentially wide-ranging effects on tropical forest function. Here, we analysed the monthly flowering and fruiting phenology of a tree community (337 individuals from 30 species) over 7 years in a lowland tropical rainforest in northeastern Australia and its response to a throughfall exclusion drought experiment (TFE) that was carried out from 2016 to 2018 (3 years), excluding approximately 30\% of rainfall. We further examined the ecophysiological effects of the TFE on the elemental (C:N) and stable isotope (\& delta;13C and \& delta;15N) composition of leaves, and on the stable isotope composition (\& delta;13C and \& delta;18O) of stem wood of four tree species. At the community level, there was no detectable effect of the TFE on flowering activity overall, but there was a significant effect recorded on fruiting and varying responses from the selected species. The reproductive phenology and physiology of the four species examined in detail were largely resistant to impacts of the TFE treatment. One canopy species in the TFE significantly increased in fruiting and flowering activity, whereas one understory species decreased significantly in both. There was a significant interaction between the TFE treatment and season on leaf C:N for two species. Stable isotope responses were also variable among species, indicating species-specific responses to the TFE. Thus, we did not observe consistent patterns in physiological and phenological changes in the tree community within the 3 years of TFE treatment examined in this study.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad064,11,1,NA,coad064,Climate change; drought; flowering; fruiting; stable isotopes; water use efficiency; Wet Tropics

Although myriad studies have documented behavioural thermoregulation in southern populations of salmonids, few if any have explored this phenomenon in northern populations, which are less likely to have an evolutionary history of heat stress, yet are predicted to experience substantial warming. Here, we treated a rare heat wave as a natural experiment to test whether wild sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) at the northern extent of their primary range (60 degrees latitude) can thermoregulate in response to abnormally high thermal conditions. We tagged adult sockeye salmon with temperature loggers as they staged in a lake epilimnion prior to spawning in small cold streams (n = 40 recovered loggers). As lake surface temperatures warmed to physiologically suboptimal levels (15-20 degrees C), sockeye salmon thermoregulated by moving to tributary plumes or the lake metalimnion. A regression of fish body temperature against lake surface temperature indicated that fish moved to cooler waters when the epilimnion temperature exceeded similar to 12 degrees C. A bioenergetics model suggested that the observed behaviour reduced daily metabolic costs by as much as similar to 50\% during the warmest conditions (18-20 degrees C). These results provide rare evidence of cool-seeking thermoregulation at the poleward extent of a species range, emphasizing the potential ubiquity of maximal temperature constraints and the functional significance of thermal heterogeneity for buffering poikilotherms from climate change.",2016,10.1093/conphys/cow039,4,NA,NA,cow039,Climate change; latitude; refuge; thermal heterogeneity

Different physiological mechanisms are thought to underlie the expression of life history traits that contribute to lifetime fitness. However, although the broad impacts of seasonality on life history traits and trade-offs is well established in many systems, the exact physiological mechanisms responsible for driving differences within and between individuals are poorly understood. Among them, molecular and physiological stress pathways, such as stress hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and oxidative stress, have potential to mediate relationships between individual survival, reproduction and environmental seasonality. Here, we determine how different physiological markers of stress including faecal cortisol metabolites (FCMs), heterophils/lymphocytes (H/L) ratio, two markers indicating oxidative balance including a marker of oxidative damage (reactive oxygen metabolites, ROM) and a marker of antioxidant defences (superoxide dismutase, SOD) and body weight vary in a large semi-captive population of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) exposed to extreme seasonality (e.g. elevated temperatures). Individuals showed higher FCM levels and H/L ratios during cold season, indicating increased stress, and the lowest FCM levels during monsoon season and H/L ratios during hot and dry season, but we found no pattern in oxidative stress (ROM and SOD) levels. Hot season also associated with a decline in body weight. The present study shows how different physiological parameters (FCM levels and H/L ratio), molecular (oxidative stress) and body condition vary with seasonal changes, and how these parameters might allow individuals to adapt to such variations.

Warming affects reproductive and vegetative traits, as well as phenology, but seldom do studies assess these traits in concert and across the whole of a plant's life cycle, particularly in wild species. Thus, it is difficult to extrapolate from such effects to predictions about the persistence of species or their conservation and management. We assessed trait variation in response to warming in Oreomyrrhis eriopoda, an Australian native montane herb, in which populations vary in germination strategy (degree of dormancy) and growth characteristics as a function of ecological factors. Warming accelerated growth in the early stages of development, particularly for populations with non-dormant seed. The differences in growth disappeared at the transition to reproduction, when an accelerating effect on phenology emerged, to varying degrees depending on germination strategy. Overall, warming reduced flower and seed production and increased mortality, indicating a reduction in reproductive opportunities, particularly for populations with dormant seed. Developmental condition affected germination strategy of the next generation seed, leading to increased degree of dormancy and slowed germination rate. But there were no whole-scale shifts in strategy or total germination percent. Following through the life cycle reveals that warming will have some potentially positive effects (early growth rates) and some negative effects (reduced reproductive output). Ultimately, warming impacts will depend on how those effects play out in the field: early establishment and an accelerated trajectory to seed maturitymay offset the tradeoff with overall seed production. Small differences among germination strategies likewise may cascade to larger effects, with important implications for persistence of species in the alpine landscape. Thus, to understand and manage the response of wild species to warming takes a whole-of-life perspective and attention to ecologically significant patterns of within-species variation.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab023,9,NA,NA,coab023,Germination temperature; intraspecific trait variation; maternal effects; phenotypic plasticity; seed development temperature; transgenerational effects

Recruitment of larvae into benthic habitats largely depends on biological interactions and favourable environmental conditions such as the inescapable diurnal thermal and tidal exposures. Hence, assessing how different taxa metabolically respond to variations in temperature is imperative to understand the community and ecosystem dynamics at both local and global scales. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of acute temperature variation on the physiology of stage-specific brachyuran larvae collected from different microhabitats at two mangrove forests in South Africa. Results indicate that the conditions within microhabitats, which larvae experience, likely influence their physiology, based on respirometry, to short-term acute temperature exposures. Furthermore, the larval thermal optimum shifted ontogenetically to become increasingly eurythermic as individuals developed from stage I zoea through to megalopa. Mangrove crab larvae in their early stages are hence increasingly vulnerable to acute temperature exposures, which could be particularly harmful to the persistence of populations if thermally stressful events increase in magnitude and frequency.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab010,9,NA,NA,coab010,Development; habitat complexity; larvae; mangroves; respirometry; vulnerability

The rapid warming in Namibia has had considerable impacts on marine fauna, such as the southern extension of the distribution of Argyrosomus coronus from southern Angola into northern Namibian waters, where it now overlaps and hybridizes with the closely related Namibian species, A. inodorus. Understanding how these species (and their hybrids) perform at current and future temperatures is vital to optimize adaptive management for Argyrosomus species. Intermittent flow-through respirometry was used to quantify standard and maximum metabolic rates for Argyrosomus individuals across a range of temperatures. The modelled aerobic scope (AS) of A. inodorus was notably higher at cooler temperatures (12, 15, 18 and 21 degrees C) compared with that of A. coronus, whereas the AS was similar at 24 degrees C. Although only five hybrids were detected and three modelled, their AS was in the upper bounds of the models at 15, 18 and 24 degrees C. These findings suggest that the warming conditions in northern Namibia may increasingly favour A. coronus and promote the poleward movement of the leading edge of their southern distribution. In contrast, the poor aerobic performance of both species at cold temperatures (12 degrees C) suggests that the cold water associated with the permanent Luderitz Upwelling Cell in the south may constrain both species to central Namibia. This is most concerning for A. inodorus because it may be subjected to a considerable coastal squeeze. This study used metabolic experiments to show that ocean warming in southern Angola and northern Namibia will likely favour Argyrosomus coronus over its cooler water relative, A. inodorus.

We look at drying responses of seeds of Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana, the two primary wild relatives of bananas and plantains, using the following four experimental approaches: (i) We equilibrated seeds to a range of relative humidity (RH) levels using non-saturated lithium chloride solutions and subsequently measured moisture content (MC) and viability. At each humidity level we tested viability using embryo rescue (ER), tetrazolium chloride staining and germination in an incubator. We found that seed viability was not reduced when seeds were dried to 4\% equilibrium relative humidity (eRH; equating to 2.5\% MC). (ii) We assessed viability of mature and less mature seeds using ER and germination in the soil and tested responses to drying. Findings showed that seeds must be fully mature to germinate and immature seeds had negligible viability. (iii) We dried seeds extracted from ripe/unripe fruit to 35-40\% eRH at different rates and tested viability with germination tests in the soil. Seeds from unripe fruit lost viability when dried and especially when dried faster; seeds from ripe fruit only lost viability when fast dried. (iv) Finally, we dried and re-imbibed mature and less mature seeds and measured embryo shrinkage and volume change using X-ray computer tomography. Embryos of less mature seeds shrank significantly when dried to 15\% eRH from 0.468 to 0.262 mm(3), but embryos of mature seeds did not. Based on our results, mature seeds from ripe fruit are desiccation tolerant to moisture levels required for seed genebanking but embryos from immature seeds are mechanistically less able to withstand desiccation, especially when water potential gradients are high. We investigated responses to drying for seeds of banana wild relatives to improve seed conservation for food security. We found that mature seeds were desiccation tolerant to levels required for seed genebanking but less mature seeds and those from unripe fruit that may be inadvertently collected have low viability and are sensitive to fast desiccation.",2022,10.1093/conphys/coab099,10,1,NA,coab099,Crop wild relatives; desiccation tolerance; genetic resources; genebank
article,Thermoregulatory costs in molting Antarctic Weddell seals: impacts of physiological and environmental conditions,"Walcott, Skyla M. and Kirkham, Amy L. and Burns, Jennifer M.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"For polar marine mammals, the energetic cost of thermoregulation depends on ambient conditions in the highly variable surrounding environment. Heat conservation strategies used by pinnipeds to reduce total heat loss include small surface area to volume ratios, the ability to limit perfusion and thick subcutaneous blubber layers. There are limits to how cool the skin surface may remain without compromising function, especially during the annual pelage molt, when hair and skin are replaced. To determine if actively molting seals incur higher thermoregulatory costs, surface temperature (ST) and heat flux (HF) were measured in 93 adult female Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) both prior to and during the active molting period using direct sensors and infrared imaging. Linear mixed-effect models revealed that ST increased significantly with increased ambient temperature and decreased wind speed (contributing 44.6 and 41.7\% of the attributed variance, respectively). Seal STs were not impacted by molt status, but were maintained at 11.2 +/- 0.3 degrees C warmer than the ambient temperature. Infrared imaging results averaged 15.1 +/- 1.4 degrees C warmer than direct ST measurements. In contrast, HF was significantly higher in seals in early molting stages compared to the pre-molt season (P<0.001) and molt status accounted for 66.5\% of the variance in HF. Thermoregulatory costs calculated from estimated basal metabolic rate and measured HF were more than double for molting seals as compared to those in pre-molt. This suggests that perfusion is increased during molt to support follicle development, despite the increased energetic costs associated with higher HF rates. Because ST, HF and thermoregulatory costs are strongly influenced by ambient conditions, molt timing is likely under selective pressure to occur during the warmest period of the year. Shifts in environmental conditions that delay molt phenology or increase HF rates could negatively impact seal populations by further increasing thermoregulatory costs.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa022,8,NA,NA,coaa022,Heat flux; pinniped; surface temperature; thermoregulation; weather conditions
article,Conservation at a slow pace: terrestrial gastropods facing fast-changing climate,"Nicolai, Annegret and Ansart, Armelle",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"The climate is changing rapidly, and terrestrial ectotherms are expected to be particularly vulnerable to changes in temperature and water regime, but also to an increase in extreme weather events in temperate regions. Physiological responses of terrestrial gastropods to climate change are poorly studied. This is surprising, because they are of biodiversity significance among litter-dwelling species, playing important roles in ecosystem function, with numerous species being listed as endangered and requiring efficient conservation management. Through a summary of our ecophysiological work on snail and slug species, we gained some insights into physiological and behavioural responses to climate change that we can organize into the following four threat categories. (i) Winter temperature and snow cover. Terrestrial gastropods use different strategies to survive sub-zero temperatures in buffered refuges, such as the litter or the soil. Absence of the insulating snow cover exposes species to high variability in temperature. The extent of specific cold tolerance might influence the potential of local extinction, but also of invasion. (ii) Drought and high temperature. Physiological responses involve high-cost processes that protect against heat and dehydration. Some species decrease activity periods, thereby reducing foraging and reproduction time. Related costs and physiological limits are expected to increase mortality. (iii) Extreme events. Although some terrestrial gastropod communities can have a good resilience to fire, storms and flooding, an increase in the frequency of those events might lead to community impoverishment. (iv) Habitat loss and fragmentation. Given that terrestrial gastropods are poorly mobile, landscape alteration generally results in an increased risk of local extinction, but responses are highly variable between species, requiring studies at the population level. There is a great need for studies involving non-invasive methods on the plasticity of physiological and behavioural responses and the ability for local adaptation, considering the spatiotemporally heterogeneous climatic landscape, to allow efficient management of ecosystems and conservation of biodiversity.",2017,10.1093/conphys/cox007,5,NA,1-17,cox007,Cold tolerance; dispersal; drought resistance; extreme events; habitat alteration; species at risk

Limited water resources necessitate human management of dam releases, allowing temperature modifications. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of temperature on specific dynamic action (SDA), or the metabolic cost associated with feeding and digestion, which is thought to represent a substantial portion of fish energy budgets. Measuring SDA with respect to absolute aerobic scope (AAS), estimated by the difference between maximum metabolic rate (MMR) and standard metabolic rate (SMR), provides a snapshot of its respective energy allocation. Fish were acclimated to 16 degrees C, raised or lowered to each acute temperature (13 degrees C, 16 degrees C, 19 degrees C, 22 degrees C or 24 degrees C), then fed a meal of commercial pellets weighing 2\% of their wet mass. We detected a significant positive effect of temperature on SMR and MMR, but not on AAS. As expected, there was no significant effect of temperature on the total O-2 cost of digestion, but unlike other studies, we did not see a significant difference in duration, peak metabolic rate standardized to SMR, time to peak, percent of meal energy utilized, nor the ratio of peak O-2 consumption to SMR. Peak O-2 consumption represented 10.4-14.5\% of AAS leaving a large amount of aerobic capacity available for other activities, and meal energy utilized for digestion ranged from 5.7\% to 7.2\%, leaving substantial remaining energy to potentially assimilate for growth. Our juvenile fall-run Chinook salmon exhibited thermal stability in their SDA response, which may play a role in maintaining homeostasis of digestive capability in a highly heterogeneous thermal environment where rapid growth is important for successful competition with conspecifics and for avoiding predation.",2022,10.1093/conphys/coac067,10,1,NA,coac067,Aerobic scope; cost of digestion; fish; metabolism
article,"Physiological effects of environmentally relevant, multi-day thermal stress on wild juvenile Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>)","Corey, Emily and Linnansaari, Tommi and Cunjak, Richard A. and Currie, Suzanne",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"The frequency of extreme thermal events in temperate freshwater systems is expected to increase alongside global surface temperature. The Miramichi River, located in eastern Canada, is a prominent Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) river where water temperatures can exceed the proposed upper thermal limit for the species (similar to 27 degrees C). Current legislation closes the river to recreational angling when water temperatures exceed 20 degrees C for two consecutive nights. We aimed to examine how natural thermal variation, representative of extreme high thermal events, affected the thermal tolerance and physiology of wild, juvenile Atlantic salmon. We acclimated fish to four thermal cycles, characteristic of real-world thermal conditions while varying daily thermal minima (16 degrees C, 18 degrees C, 20 degrees C or 22 degrees C) and diel thermal fluctuation (e.g. Delta 5 degrees C-Delta 9 degrees C). In each cycling condition, we assessed the role that thermal minima played on the acute thermal tolerance (critical thermal maximum, (CTMax)), physiological (e.g. heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), ubiquitin) and energetic (e.g. hepatic glycogen, blood glucose and lactate) status of juvenile Atlantic salmon throughout repeated thermal cycles. Exposure to 16-21 degrees C significantly increased CTMax (+0.9 degrees C) compared to a stable acclimation temperature (16 degrees C), as did exposure to diel thermal fluctuations of 18-27 degrees C, 20-27 degrees C and 22-27 degrees C, yet repeated exposure provided no further increases in acute thermal tolerance. In comparison to the reference condition (16-21 degrees C), consecutive days of high temperature cycling with different thermal minima resulted in significant increases in HSP70 and ubiquitin, a significant decrease in liver glycogen, and no significant cumulative effect on either blood glucose or lactate. However, comparison between thermally taxed treatments suggested the diel thermal minima had little influence on the physiological or energetic response of juvenile salmon, despite the variable thermal cycling condition. Our results suggest that relatively cooler night temperatures in the summer months may play a limited role in mitigating physiological stress throughout warm diel cycle events.",2017,10.1093/conphys/cox014,5,NA,NA,cox014,NA

Applied to infested tributaries, it is most toxic to larval sea lamprey, which have a low capacity to detoxify TFM. However, TFM can be toxic to lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), whose populations are at risk throughout the basin. They are most vulnerable to TFM in early life stages, with the greatest risk of non-target mortality occurring in waters with high alkalinity. We quantified TFM toxicity and used radio-labelled TFM (C-14-TFM) to measure TFM uptake rates in lake sturgeon in waters of different pH and alkalinity. Regardless of pH or alkalinity, TFM uptake was 2-3-fold higher in young-of-the-year (YOY) than in age 1-year-plus (1+) sturgeon, likely due to higher mass-specific metabolic rates in the smaller YOY fish. As expected, TFM uptake was highest at lower (pH 6.5) versus higher (pH 9.0) pH, indicating that it is taken up across the gills by diffusion in its unionized form. Uptake decreased as alkalinity increased from low (similar to 50 mg L-1 as CaCO3) to moderate alkalinity (similar to 150 mg L-1 as CaCO3), before plateauing at high alkalinity (similar to 250 mg L-1 as CaCO3). Toxicity curves revealed that the 12-h LC50 and 12-h LC99.9 of TFMto lake sturgeon were in fact higher (less toxic) than in sea lamprey, regardless of alkalinity. However, in actual treatments, 1.3-1.5 times the minimum lethal TFM concentration (MLC = LC99.9) to lamprey is applied to maximize mortality, disproportionately amplifying TFM toxicity to sturgeon at higher alkalinities. We conclude that limiting TFM treatments to late summer/early fall in waters of moderate-high alkalinity, when lake sturgeon are larger with lower rates of TFM uptake, would mitigate non-target TFM effects and help conserve populations of these ancient, culturally important fishes.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz089,7,NA,NA,coz089,Invasive species; 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol; Sea lamprey control; Acipenser fulvescens; Allometry; Gill
article,An experimental test of energy and electrolyte supplementation as a mitigation strategy for white-nose syndrome,"McGuire, Liam P. and Mayberry, Heather W. and Fletcher, Quinn E. and Willis, Craig K. R.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Fungi are increasingly recognised as harmful pathogens of wildlife. White-nose syndrome (WNS) is a fungal disease that has killed millions of hibernating bats in North America. High mortality has driven research to identify management strategies for the disease. Increased energy expenditure and fat depletion, as well as fluid loss, hypotonic dehydration and electrolyte depletion appear to be key aspects of WNS pathophysiology. Bats with WNS spend energy too quickly and also lose fluids containing water and electrolytes from lesions on exposed skin surfaces. During periodic arousals, bats often drink water but, in most of the WNS-affected area, food is not available during winter and, therefore, they cannot maintain energy balance or replace lost electrolytes. Therefore, providing a liquid caloric/electrolyte/nutrient supplement could be useful for treating WNS. We studied captive, hibernating little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) to test whether providing supplemental energy and electrolytes (a 1:1 dilution of unflavoured Pedialyte) to hibernating bats could reduce severity of WNS symptoms and increase survival. Infected bats in the Pedialyte-supplemented group generally avoided the Pedialyte and preferentially drank plain water. We did not observe any differences in survival, arousal frequency or blood chemistry, but bats in the Pedialyte-supplemented group had higher fungal load and more UV fluorescence than the control group that was only provided with water. Supplemental electrolytes would be an attractive management strategy because of their low cost and logistic feasibility but our results suggest this approach would be ineffective. However, it could be useful to conduct preference experiments with multiple dilutions and/or flavours of electrolyte solution. Although they did not prefer Pedialyte in our experiment, bats in the hand readily drink it and electrolyte supplementation remains an important tool for rehabilitation of captive bats recovering from WNS and other causes of dehydration.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz006,7,NA,NA,coz006,Bats; dehydration; electrolytes; hibernation; white-nose syndrome

Yet very little is known about their growth rates, ages, demography and climate sensitivity. Using radiocarbon in spine dating time series, we quantitatively estimate the growth rate (5.8 and 8.3 cm yr(-1)) and age of these cacti (up to 430 years). These data and our field measurements yield a survivorship curve that suggests precipitation on the Altiplano is important for this species' recruitment. Our results also reveal a relationship between night-time temperatures on the Altiplano and the variation in oxygen isotope values in spines (delta O-1(8)). The annual delta O-18 minimums from 58 years of in-series spine tissue from pasacana on the Altiplano provides at least decadal proxy records of temperature (r = 0.58; P < 0.0001), and evidence suggests that there are longer records connecting modern Altiplano temperatures to seasurface temperatures (SSTs) in the Atlantic Ocean. While the role of Atlantic SSTs on the South American Summer Monsoon (SASM) and precipitation on the Bolivian Altiplano is well described, the impact of SSTs on Altiplano temperatures is disputed. Understanding the modern impact of SSTs on temperature on the Altiplano is important to both understand the impact of future climate change on pasacana cactus and to understand past climate changes on the Altiplano. This is the best quantitative evidence to date of one of the oldest known cactus in the world, although there are likely many older cacti on the Altiplano, or elsewhere, that have not yet been sampled.

Here we examine temperature effects on the survival of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), a species of high economic and conservation importance. We implement a framework to assess how incremental changes in temperature impact survival across populations that is based on thermal performance models for three freshwater life stages of Chinook salmon. These temperature-dependent models were combined with local spatial distribution and phenology data to translate spatial-temporal stream temperature data into maps of life stage-specific physiological performance in space and time. Specifically, we converted temperature-dependent performance (i.e. energy used by pre-spawned adults, mortality of incubating embryos and juvenile growth rate) into a common currency that measures survival in order to compare thermal effects across life stages. Based on temperature data from two abnormally warm and dry years for three managed rivers in the Central Valley, California, temperature-dependent mortality during pre-spawning holding was higher than embryonic mortality or juvenile mortality prior to smolting. However, we found that local phenology and spatial distribution helped to mitigate negative thermal impacts. In a theoretical application, we showed that high temperatures may inhibit successful reintroduction of threatened Central Valley spring-run Chinook salmon to two rivers where they have been extirpated. To increase Chinook salmon population sizes, especially for the threatened and declining spring-run, our results indicate that adults may need more cold-water holding habitat than currently available in order to reduce pre-spawning mortality stemming from high temperatures. To conclude, our framework is an effective way to calculate thermal impacts on multiple salmonid populations and life stages within a river over time, providing local managers the information to minimize negative thermal impacts on salmonid populations, particularly important during years when cold-water resources are scarce.",2022,10.1093/conphys/coac013,10,1,NA,coac013,Central Valley; Chinook salmon; life cycle; life stage; thermally-mediated survival; thermal performance model

Despite the immediate survival benefits, catch-and-release results in capture stress, particularly at high water temperatures, and this can result in delayed post-release mortality minutes to days later. The objective of this study was to evaluate how different water temperatures influenced heart rate disturbance and recovery of wild sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) following fisheries interactions (i.e. exhaustive exercise). Heart rate loggers were implanted into Fraser River sockeye salmon prior to simulated catch-and-release events conducted at three water temperatures (16 degrees C, 19 degrees C and 21 degrees C). The fisheries simulation involved chasing logger-implanted fish in tanks for 3 min, followed by a 1 min air exposure. Neither resting nor routine heart rate differed among temperature treatments. In response to the fisheries simulation, peak heart rate increased with temperature (16 degrees C = 91.3 +/- 1.3 beats min(-1); 19 degrees C = 104.9 +/- 2.0 beats min(-1) and 21 degrees C = 117 +/- 1.3 beats min(-1)). Factorial heart rate and scope for heart rate were highest at 21 degrees C and lowest at 16 degrees C, but did not differ between 19 degrees C and 21 degrees C. Temperature affected the initial rate of cardiac recovery but not the overall duration (similar to 10 h) such that the rate of energy expenditure during recovery increased with temperature. These findings support the notion that in the face of climate change, efforts to reduce stress at warmer temperatures will be necessary if catch-and-release practices are to be an effective conservation strategy.",2017,10.1093/conphys/cox050,5,NA,NA,cox050,Cardiac; climate change; exhaustive exercise; fisheries; Pacific salmon; temperature
article,Progressive hypoxia decouples activity and aerobic performance of skate embryos,"Di Santo, Valentina and Tran, Anna H. and Svendsen, Jon C.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Although fish population size is strongly affected by survival during embryonic stages, our understanding of physiological responses to environmental stressors is based primarily on studies of post-hatch fishes. Embryonic responses to acute exposure to changes in abiotic conditions, including increase in hypoxia, could be particularly important in species exhibiting long developmental time, as embryos are unable to select a different environment behaviourally. Given that oxygen is key to metabolic processes in fishes and aquatic hypoxia is becoming more severe and frequent worldwide, organisms are expected to reduce their aerobic performance. Here, we examined the metabolic and behavioural responses of embryos of a benthic elasmobranch fish, the little skate (Leucoraja erinacea), to acute progressive hypoxia, by measuring oxygen consumption and movement (tail-beat) rates inside the egg case. Oxygen consumption rates were not significantly affected by ambient oxygen levels until reaching 45\% air saturation (critical oxygen saturation, S-crit). Below S-crit, oxygen consumption rates declined rapidly, revealing an oxygen conformity response. Surprisingly, we observed a decoupling of aerobic performance and activity, as tail-beat rates increased, rather than matching the declining metabolic rates, at air saturation levels of 55\% and below. These results suggest a significantly divergent response at the physiological and behavioural levels. While skate embryos depressed their metabolic rates in response to progressive hypoxia, they increased water circulation inside the egg case, presumably to restore normoxic conditions, until activity ceased abruptly around 9.8\% air saturation.",2016,10.1093/conphys/cov067,4,NA,NA,cov067,Climate change; critical oxygen saturation; elasmobranch; Leucoraja erinacea; metabolism; performance

It has given rise to an unprecedented need to understand the link between rapidly changing environments, immunocompetence and wildlife health (the nascent field of ecoimmunology). Increasing our knowledge of the ecoimmunology of amphibians necessitates the development of reliable, field-applicable methods of assessing immunocompetence in non-model species. The phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) inflammation assay uses a lectin to elicit localized inflammation that reflects an organism's capacity to mount an immune response. Although extensively used in birds to assess responses to environmental change, stress and disease, its application in amphibians has been extremely limited. We developed, validated and optimized a practical and effective phytohaemagglutinin inflammation assay in phylogenetically distant amphibians and demonstrated its suitability for use in a wide range of ecoimmunological studies. The protocol was effective for all species tested and worked equally well for both sexes and for adult and sub-adult animals. We determined that using set-force-measuring instruments resulted in a `compression effect' that countered the inflammatory response, reinforcing the need for internal controls. We developed a novel method to determine peak response times more accurately and thereby improve assay sensitivity. Histological validation demonstrated considerable interspecies variation in the robustness of amphibian immune defences. Importantly, we applied the assay to a real-world scenario of varying environmental conditions and proved that the assay effectively detected differences in immune fitness between groups of animals exposed to ecologically meaningful levels of density stress. This provided strong evidence that one cost of metamorphic plasticity responses by tadpoles to increasing density is a reduction in post-metamorphic immune fitness and that metamorphosis does not prevent phenotypic carry-over of larval stress to the adult phenotype.

We conducted a systematic literature review to examine if simulated ocean acidification (sOA) could influence growth and reproduction in fish within the dynamic energy budget theory framework. As such, we chose to examine metabolic rate, locomotion, food assimilation and growth in early life stages (i.e. larvae and juvenile) and adults. Our goal was to evaluate if acclimatization to sOA has any directional changes in these traits and to explore potential implications for energetic trade-offs in these for growth and reproduction. We found that sOA had negligible effects on energetic expenditure for maintenance and aerobic metabolism due to the robust physiological capacity regulating acid-base and ion perturbations but substantive effects on locomotion, food assimilation and growth. We demonstrated evidence that sOA significantly reduced growth performance of fish in early life stages, which may have resulted from reduced food intake and digestion efficiency. Also, our results showed that sOA may enhance reproduction with increased numbers of offspring although this may come at the cost of altered reproductive behaviours or offspring fitness. While these results indicate evidence for changes in energy budgets because of physiological acclimatization to sOA, the heterogeneity of results in the literature suggests that physiological and neural mechanisms need to be clearly elucidated in future studies. Lastly, most studies on sOA have been conducted on early life stages, which necessitates that more studies should be conducted on adults to understand reproductive success and thus better predict cohort and population dynamics under ongoing climate change. Ocean acidification (OA) could alter energy budgets of marine fish. OA had negligible effects on aerobic metabolism, but substantive effects on locomotion, food assimilation and growth, suggesting a potential shift in energy budgets in the future.

article,Thermotolerance capacities of native and exotic coastal plants will lead to changes in species composition under increased heat waves,"French, Kris and Robinson, Sharon A. and Lia, Jodie",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"With an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme heat events, plants are likely to reach their thermal limits and show slower growth or increased mortality. We investigated differences amongst coastal native and invasive shrubs and grasses to investigate if particular species might be more at risk in the future. Using an ecologically relevant experimental set of heat waves over a month, we assessed changes in biomass and photosynthetic efficiency in a laboratory setting using 25 coastal Australian species divided into native and exotic shrubs, and native and exotic grasses. We also compared three C3 and three C4 grasses within the native and exotic groups. Overall, native shrubs suffered higher mortality, lower growth and increased photosynthetic stress. There was some evidence that C3 grasses, had lower growth with heat waves, compared to C4 species although, in general, grasses showed evidence of photosynthetic acclimation over the month. Increases in leaf abscission suggest that part of the acclimation process was to develop new, thermally tolerant leaves. Our results indicate that in the future we would expect an increase in exotic shrubs and grasses occupying spaces in coastal plant communities that arise from native mortality following extreme heat events. Management of these coastal communities will need to focus strongly on maintaining a diverse native shrub composition that can resist climate-based disturbances (such as wildfire), as well as controlling the extent and biomass of exotic species, if coastal communities are to remain healthy and diverse in a changing climate.",2017,10.1093/conphys/cox029,5,NA,NA,cox029,Biomass; extreme heat events; FvFm; grasses; shrubs; survival

To achieve these body temperatures, butterflies use a combination of morphological, behavioural and physiological mechanisms.

The mean body temperature for flight initiation in the field was lower (24-26 degrees C) than indicated by previous studies (28-30 degrees C) in these species. There were small but significant differences in thermal sensitivity of flight initiation between species; high-elevation Colias meadii initiated flight at a lower mean body temperature than lower-elevation Colias eriphyle. Morphological differences (in wing melanin and thoracic setae) drive body temperature differences between species and contributed strongly to differences in the time and probability of flight and air temperatures at flight initiation.

We analysed blood samples drawn from 35 marine iguanas captured at three locations on San Cristobal Island. A portable blood analyser (iSTAT) was used to obtain near-immediate field results for pH, lactate, partial pressure of O-2, partial pressure of CO2, bicarbonate (HCO3-), percentage O-2 saturation, haematocrit, haemoglobin, sodium, potassium, ionized calcium and glucose. Parameter values affected by temperature were auto-corrected by the iSTAT. Standard laboratory haematology techniques were employed for differential white blood cell counts and haematocrit determination; resulting values were also compared with the haematocrit values generated by the iSTAT. Body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate and body measurements were also recorded. Body length was positively-correlated with several blood chemistry values (HCO3- and glucose) and two haematology parameters (haemoglobin and manually determined haematocrit). A notable finding was the unusually high blood sodium level; the mean value of 178 mg/dl is among the highest known for any reptile. This value is likely to be a conservative estimate because some samples exceeded the maximal value the iSTAT can detect. For haematocrit determination, the iSTAT blood analyser yielded results significantly lower than those obtained with high-speed centrifugation. The values reported in this study provide baseline data that may be useful in comparisons among populations and in detecting changes in health status among marine iguanas affected by natural disturbances or anthropogenic threats. The findings might also be helpful in future efforts to demonstrate associations between specific biochemical parameters and disease.",2015,10.1093/conphys/cov034,3,NA,NA,cov034,Amblyrhynchus cristatus; biochemistry; blood gas; health; haematology; marine iguana
article,Reflex impairment and physiology as predictors of delayed mortality in recreationally caught yellowtail snapper (<i>Ocyurus chrysurus</i>),"Forrestal, Francesca C. and McDonald, M. Danielle and Burress, Georgianna and Die, David J.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Yellowtail snapper (Ocyurus chrysurus) is an important part of the reef fish assemblage in the western, tropical Atlantic and is caught by both recreational and commercial fisheries in south Florida and the Bahamas. It is estimated that 80\% of snapper caught within southeastern Florida waters are discarded due to minimum size restrictions. Neglecting to include information on delayed mortality of undersized fish has the potential for fishery managers to overestimate the abundance of smaller size classes and introduce bias into stock assessments. This study examines associations between reflex impairment, traditional physiological parameters and post-release mortality of undersized yellowtail snapper. Laboratory experiments exposed yellowtail snapper to a gradient, simulating capture conditions. Blood draws were obtained from a sub-sample of fish. There was a significant relationship between delayed mortality and the proportion of reflex impairment for both individual fish and groups of fish (P < 0.001 and P = 0.03). Within the sub-sample of blood-sampled fish, base excess and pH were significantly correlated to reflex impairment. Delayed mortality was significantly correlated to pH, base excess and lactate concentration. Results suggest that discarded, undersized yellowtail with more than 29\% of their reflexes impaired will not survive.",2017,10.1093/conphys/cox035,5,NA,NA,cox035,yellowtail snapper; i-Stat; reflex impairment; delayed mortality; post-release survival
article,Automated flow control of a multi-lane swimming chamber for small fishes indicates species-specific sensitivity to experimental protocols,"Illing, Bjorn and Severati, Andrea and Hochen, Justin and Boyd, Paul and Raison, Paulin and Mather, Rachel and Downie, Adam T. and Rummer, Jodie L. and Kroon, Frederieke J. and Humphrey, Craig",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"In fishes, swimming performance is considered an important metric to measure fitness, dispersal and migratory abilities. The swimming performance of individual larval fishes is often integrated into models to make inferences on how environmental parameters affect population-level dynamics (e.g. connectivity). However, little information exists regarding how experimental protocols affect the swimming performance of marine fish larvae. In addition, the technical setups used to measure larval fish swimming performance often lack automation and accurate control of water quality parameters and flow velocity. In this study, we automated the control of multi-lane swimming chambers for small fishes by developing an open-source algorithm. This automation allowed us to execute repeatable flow scenarios and reduce operator interference and inaccuracies in flow velocity typically associated with manual control. Furthermore, we made structural modifications to a prior design to reduce the areas of lower flow velocity. We then validated the flow dynamics of the new chambers using computational fluid dynamics and particle-tracking software. The algorithm provided an accurate alignment between the set and measured flow velocities and we used it to test whether faster critical swimming speed (U-crit) protocols (i.e. shorter time intervals and higher velocity increments) would increase U-crit of early life stages of two tropical fish species {[}4-10-mm standard length (SL)]. The U-crit of barramundi (Lates calcarifer) and cinnamon anemonefish (Amphiprion melanopus) increased linearly with fish length, but in cinnamon anemonefish, U-crit started to decrease upon metamorphosis. Swimming protocols using longer time intervals (more than 2.5 times increase) negatively affected U-crit in cinnamon anemonefish but not in barramundi. These species-specific differences in swimming performance highlight the importance of testing suitable U-crit protocols prior to experimentation. The automated control of flow velocity will create more accurate and repeatable data on swimming performance of larval fishes. Integrating refined measurements into individual-based models will support future research on the effects of environmental change.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coaa131,9,NA,NA,coaa131,Automation; CFD; fish larvae; particle tracking; swimming methodology

There is increasing interest in using physiological mediators of the stress response as indicators of individual and population-level response to environmental stressors. Here, we use laboratory experiments to show that the temperature thresholds in brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) for increased gill heat shock protein-70 (20.7 degrees C) and plasma glucose (21.2 degrees C) are similar to their proposed thermal ecological limit of 21.0 degrees C. Field assays demonstrated increased plasma glucose, cortisol and heat shock protein-70 concentrations at field sites where mean daily temperature exceeded 21.0 degrees C. Furthermore, population densities of brook trout were lowest at field sites where temperatures were warm enough to induce a stress response, and a co-occurring species with a higher thermal tolerance showed no evidence of physiological stress at a warm site. The congruence of stress responses and proposed thermal limits supports the use of these thresholds in models of changes in trout distribution under climate change scenarios and suggests that the induction of the stress response by elevated temperature may play a key role in driving the distribution of species.",2015,10.1093/conphys/cov017,3,NA,NA,cov017,Climate change; cortisol; glucose; heat shock protein; Salvelinus fontinalis; temperature

Loren",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Sea turtle rehabilitation clinics and aquaria frequently transport stranded sea turtles long distances out of water, e.g. for release at sites with appropriate water temperatures. Endangered Kemp's ridley turtles (Lepidochelys kempii) are known to exhibit an adrenal stress response during such transports. In an opportunistic study of turtles transported by road from Massachusetts to Georgia for release, we tested whether placing turtles in saltwater pools for short periods after transport would help turtles recover from transport-related stress. Eighteen juvenile Kemp's ridley turtles were examined and blood samples collected (1) immediately pre-transport, (2) immediately post-transport and (3) after a 6 h (n = 9) or 24 h (n = 9) post-transport period in unfamiliar pools, after which all turtles were released to the sea. Blood samples were analyzed for corticosterone, glucose, total white blood cell (WBC) count, heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio, pH, pO(2), pCO(2), HCO3 (bicarbonate), sodium, potassium, ionized calcium, lactate and hematocrit. Though the majority of turtles remained in good clinical condition, corticosterone, glucose, WBC and H/L elevated significantly during transport, while potassium declined slightly but significantly. After at least 6 h in a saltwater pool, potassium and glucose returned to pre-transport baselines and corticosterone partially recovered toward baseline. Extending the pool time to 24 h did not markedly enhance the physiological recovery of turtles, and two immune measures (WBC, H/L) remained elevated from the effect of transport. Six hours in a saltwater pool appears to facilitate the recovery of Kemp's ridley sea turtles from transport-related stress and may therefore improve their readiness for release.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coy065,7,NA,NA,coy065,Chelonian; corticosterone; glucose; soft release; stress; transportation
article,"Thermal tolerance depends on season, age and body condition in imperilled redside dace <i>Clinostomus elongatus</i>","Turko, Andy J. and Nolan, Colby B. and Balshine, Sigal and Scott, Graham R. and Pitcher, Trevor E.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Urbanization tends to increase water temperatures in streams and rivers and is hypothesized to be contributing to declines of many freshwater fishes. However, factors that influence individual variation in thermal tolerance, and how these may change seasonally, are not well understood. To address this knowledge gap, we studied redside dace Clinostomus elongatus, an imperilled stream fish native to rapidly urbanizing areas of eastern North America. In wild redside dace from rural Ohio, USA, acute upper thermal tolerance (i.e. critical thermal maximum, CTmax) ranged between similar to 34 degrees C in summer (stream temperature similar to 22 degrees C) and 27 degrees C in winter (stream temperature similar to 2 degrees C). Juveniles had higher CTmax than adults in spring and summer, but in winter, CTmax was higher in adults. Thermal safety margins (CTmax - ambient water temperature; similar to 11 degrees C) were less than the increases in peak water temperature predicted for many redside dace streams due to the combined effects of climate change and urbanization. Furthermore, behavioural agitation occurred 5-6 degrees C below CTmax. Safety margins were larger (>20 degrees C) in autumn and winter. In addition, redside dace were more sensitive (2.5 degrees C lower CTmax) than southern redbelly dace Chrosomus erythrogaster, a non-imperilled sympatric cyprinid. Body condition (Fulton's K) of adult redside dace was positively correlated with CTmax, but in juveniles, this relationship was significant only in one of two summers of experiments. Next, we measured CTmax of captive redside dace fed experimentally manipulated diets. In adults, but not juveniles, CTmax was higher in fish fed a high- vs. low-ration diet, indicating a causal link between nutrition and thermal tolerance. We conclude that redside dace will be challenged by predicted future summer temperatures, especially in urbanized habitats. Thus, habitat restoration that mitigates temperature increases is likely to benefit redside dace. We also suggest habitat restoration that improves food availability may increase thermal tolerance, and thus population resilience.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa062,8,NA,NA,coaa062,Critical thermal maximum; endangered; energy stores; nutrition; species at risk

In this study, we used five genetically distinct sub-populations of Australian barramundi (Lates calcarifer) to examine the extent of intraspecific variability in hypoxia tolerance. Fish were maintained at two temperatures (26 or 36 degrees C), representing the seasonal thermal range for this species across its tropical distribution in Australia. All fish maintained a constant oxygen consumption rate (M-O2) as air saturation of the water decreased from 100\% down to a critical oxygen saturation ({[}O-2](crit)) of 15.44 +/- 3.20 and 21.07 +/- 3.92\% (means +/- SD) at 26 and 36 degrees C, respectively. Mean {[}O-2](crit), used as a performance measure of hypoxia tolerance, did not differ between sub-populations.

article,Effects of acclimation temperature and feed restriction on the metabolic performance of green sturgeon,"Zillig, Kenneth W. and Hannan, Kelly D. and Baird, Sarah E. and Cocherell, Dennis E. and Poletto, Jamilynn B. and Fangue, Nann A.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Lay Summary: We reared green sturgeon at two temperatures and provided two rations. We then assessed the metabolic performance of fish from these four treatments across a range of temperatures (11 to 31\#x00B0;C). The impacts of temperature and ration create a conservation conflict between green sturgeon and the endangered winter-run Chinook salmon. Green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris) are an anadromous threatened species of sturgeon found along the Pacific coast of North America. The southern distinct population segment only spawns in the Sacramento River and is exposed to water temperatures kept artificially cold for the conservation and management of winter-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Past research has demonstrated costs of cold-water rearing including reduced growth rates, condition and survivorship of juvenile green sturgeon. Our research investigates how the stressors of water temperature and food limitation influence the metabolic performance of green sturgeon. We reared green sturgeon at two acclimation temperatures (13 and 19 degrees C) and two ration amounts (100\% and 40\% of optimal feed). We then measured the routine and maximum metabolic rates (RMR and MMR, respectively) of sturgeon acclimated to these rearing conditions across a range of acute temperature exposures (11 to 31 degrees C). Among both temperature acclimation treatments (13 or 19 degrees C), we found that feed restriction reduced RMR across a range of acute temperatures. The influence of feed restriction on RMR and MMR interacted with acclimation temperature. Fish reared at 13 degrees C preserved their MMR and aerobic scope (AS) despite feed restriction, while fish fed reduced rations and acclimated to 19 degrees C showed reduced MMR and AS capacity primarily at temperatures below 16 degrees C. The sympatry of threatened green sturgeon with endangered salmonids produces a conservation conflict, such that cold-water releases for the conservation of at-risk salmonids may constrain the metabolic performance of juvenile green sturgeon. Understanding the impacts of environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, dissolved oxygen) on ecological interactions of green sturgeon will be necessary to determine the influence of salmonid-focused management.",2024,10.1093/conphys/coae021,12,1,NA,coae021,Aerobic scope; Chinook salmon; conservation conflict
article,Increased wave action promotes muscle performance but increasing temperatures cause a tenacity-endurance trade-off in intertidal snails (<i>Nerita atramentosa</i>),"Clayman, Samuel and Seebacher, Frank",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Concurrent increases in wave action and sea surface temperatures increase the physical impact on intertidal organisms and affect their physiological capacity to respond to that impact. Our aim was to determine whether wave exposure altered muscle function in intertidal snails (Nerita atramentosa) and whether responses to wave action and temperature are plastic, leading to compensation for altered environmental conditions. We show that field snails from exposed shores had greater endurance and vertical tenacity than snails from matched protected shores (n=5 pairs of shores). There were no differences in muscle metabolic capacities (strombine/lactate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase and cytochrome c oxidase activities) between shore types. Maximum stress (force/foot area) produced by isolated foot muscle did not differ between shore types, but foot muscle from snails on exposed shores had greater endurance. A laboratory experiment showed that vertical tenacity was greater in animals acclimated for 3 weeks to cool winter temperatures (15 C) compared to summer temperatures (25 C), but endurance was greater in snails acclimated to 25 degrees C. Acclimation to water flow that mimicked wave action in the field increased vertical tenacity but decreased endurance. Our data show that increased wave action elicits a training effect on muscle, but that increasing sea surface temperature can cause a trade-off between tenacity and endurance. Ocean warming would negate the beneficial increase in tenacity that could render snails more resistant to acute impacts of wave action, while promoting longer term resistance to dislodgment by waves.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz039,7,NA,NA,coz039,Climate change; endurance; force; metabolism; phenotypic plasticity

For this purpose, 2-year-old hatchery-reared male and female brown trout (F1 offspring of wild caught anadromous fish) were infected with salmon lice and measured for changes in plasma ions, glucose, lactate and osmolality and relative heart, liver and gonad sizes during a simulated seawater migration and thereafter a premature return to freshwater after 4 weeks in seawater (pre-adult louse). Un-infected trout served as control. Male trout used longer time to develop full hypo-osmoregulatory ability in seawater and showed a stronger response in plasma glucose and lactate following simulated premature return to freshwater, compared to female trout. Response to salmon louse was stronger in female trout, shown by stronger osmotic stress by chalimus (plasma Cl-) and pre-adult louse (plasma osmolality) and elevated relative liver size (hepatosomatic index) by pre-adult louse in female compared to male trout. Moreover, high plasma cortisol in infected female and low plasma cortisol in infected male trout produced a significant treatment-sex interaction on plasma cortisol. Lice infection intensity was initially higher in male (0.18 lice g(-1)) compared to female trout (0.11 lice g(-1)) at the chalimus stage, but equal between sexes at the pre-adult stage (male 0.15 and female 0.17 lice g(-1)). This study showed that female trout were better adapted for changes in water salinity, while male trout were more robust against salmon louse infection. These results suggests that the elevated salmon louse infection pressure generated by salmon farming have strong and unexplored negative effects on wild sea trout populations. Further research on this topic is vital for the conservation of wild sea trout populations. Female trout were better adapted for changes in water salinity, while male trout were better adapted for salmon louse infection.

article,Limited variability in upper thermal tolerance among pure and hybrid populations of a cold-water fish,"Wells, Zachery R. R. and McDonnell, Laura H. and Chapman, Lauren J. and Fraser, Dylan J.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"As climate warming threatens the persistence of many species and populations, it is important to forecast their responses to warming thermal regimes. Climate warming often traps populations in smaller habitat fragments, not only changing biotic parameters, but potentially decreasing adaptive potential by decreasing genetic variability. We examined the ability of six genetically distinct and different-sized populations of a cold-water fish (brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis) to tolerate acute thermal warming and whether this tolerance could be altered by hybridizing populations. Critical thermal maximum (CTmax) assays were conducted on juveniles from each population to assess thermal tolerance, and the agitation temperature was recorded for assessing behavioural changes to elevated temperatures. An additional metric, which we have called the `CTmax-agitation window' (CTmax minus agitation temperature), was also assessed. The CTmax differed between five out of 15 population pairs, although the maximal CTmax difference was only 0.68 degrees C (29.11-29.79 degrees C). Hybridization between one large population and two small populations yielded no obvious heterosis in mean CTmax, and no differences in agitation temperature or CTmax-agitation window were detected among pure populations or hybrids. Summer variation in temperature within each stream was negatively correlated with mean CTmax and mean CTmax-agitation window, although the maximal difference was small. Despite being one of the most phenotypically divergent and plastic north temperate freshwater fishes, our results suggest that limited variability exists in CTmax among populations of brook trout, regardless of their population size, standing genetic variation and differing natural thermal regimes (temperature variation, minimum and maximum).

Desert fishes may be particularly vulnerable to rising temperatures because many species occupy only a fraction of their historical range and occur in habitats with already high temperatures. Here, we examined endocrine and metabolic responses to elevated temperature in Amargosa pupfish, Cyprinodon nevadensis amargosae. We studied C. n. amargosae from two habitats with distinct thermal conditions: the Amargosa River, which experiences diurnally and seasonally variable temperatures (0.2-40 degrees C); and Tecopa Bore, a spring and marsh fed by hot groundwater (47.5 degrees C) from an artesian borehole. These allopatric populations differ in morphology, and prior evidence suggests that temperature might contribute to these differences via altered thyroid hormone (TH) regulation of morphological development. Here, we document variation in hepatic iodothyronine deiodinase type 2 (dio2) and type 3 (dio3) and TH receptor beta (tr beta) gene transcript abundance between the Amargosa River and Tecopa Bore wild populations. Fish from these populations acclimated to 24 or 34 degrees C retained differences in hepatic dio2, dio3 and tr beta mRNAs and also varied in transcripts encoding the TH membrane transporters monocarboxylate transporter 8 (mct8) and organic anion-transporting protein 1c1 (oatp1c1). Tecopa Bore pupfish also exhibited higher dio2 and tr beta mRNA levels in skeletal muscle relative to Amargosa River fish. Muscle citrate synthase activity was lower at 34 degrees C for both populations, whereas lactate dehydrogenase activity and lactate dehydrogenase A-chain (ldhA) transcripts were both higher and 3,5,3'-triiodothryonine responsive in Tecopa Bore pupfish only. These findings reveal that local population variation and thermal experience interact to shape how pupfish respond to elevated temperatures, and point to the need to consider such interactions in management actions for desert fishes under a changing climate.",2016,10.1093/conphys/cow047,4,NA,NA,cow047,Climate change; fish; lactate dehydrogenase; metabolism; temperature; thyroid hormone

In this experiment, migratory adult sockeye salmon were exposed to simulated capture-release in fresh water, including 3 min of exhaustive exercise and 60 s of air exposure at three ecologically relevant water temperatures (13, 16 and 19 degrees C) to understand how thermal and capture-release stressors may interact to increase mortality risk. Water temperature and sex were the factors that best predicted 24 and 48 h survival, with females in the warmest temperature group experiencing the greatest mortality. Capture-release treatment including air exposure was associated with equilibrium loss and depressed ventilation rates at release; the probability of fish surviving for 24 h after simulated capture-release was >50\% if the duration of equilibrium loss was <2 min or ventilation frequency was >1 breath s(-1). Higher haematocrit and plasma lactate as well as lower mean cell haemoglobin concentration and plasma sodium and chloride 30 min after simulated capture-release were also significant predictors of 24 h survival. Together, the results demonstrate that simple observations that are consistent with physiological disturbance can be used as predictors for post-release short-term survival for sockeye salmon.

With the progression of global climate change, high temperatures and hypoxia may co-occur more frequently within redds, particularly for salmonid species at their southern range limit. Warming and hypoxia have competing effects on energy supply and demand, which can be detrimental to energy-limited early life stages. We examined how elevated temperature and hypoxia as individual and combined stressors affected the survival, physiological performance, growth, and development of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). We reared late fall-run Chinook salmon from fertilization to the fry stage in a fully factorial design of two temperatures {[}10 degrees C (ambient) and 14 degrees C (warm)] and two oxygen levels {[}normoxia (100\% air saturation, 10 mg O-2/l) and hypoxia (50\% saturation, 5.5 mg O-2/l)]. Rearing in hypoxia significantly reduced hatching success, especially in combination with warming. Both warming and hypoxia improved acute thermal tolerance. While rearing in hypoxia improved tolerance to acute hypoxia stress, warming reduced hypoxia tolerance. Hypoxia-reared fish were smaller at hatch, but were able to reach similar sizes to the normoxia-reared fish by the fry stage. High temperature and normoxia resulted in the fastest rate of development while low temperature and hypoxia resulted in the slowest rate of development. Despite improved physiological tolerance to acute heat and hypoxia stress, hypoxia-reared embryos had reduced survival and growth, which could have larger population-level effects.

Hyposmotic events are particularly challenging for marine sharks that osmoconform, and species-specific tolerances are not well known. Therefore, we sought to determine the effects of an acute (48 h) ecologically relevant hyposmotic event (25.8 ppt) on the physiology of two juvenile shark species, namely the school shark (Galeorhinus galeus), listed by the Australian Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act as `conservation dependent', and the gummy shark (Mustelus antarcticus), from the Pittwater Estuary (Australia). In both species, we observed a decrease in plasma osmolality brought about by selective losses of NaCl, urea and trimethylamine N-oxide, as well as decreases in haemoglobin, haematocrit and routine oxygen consumption. Heat-shock protein levels varied between species during the exposure, but we found no evidence of protein damage in any of the tissues tested. Although both species seemed to be able to cope with this level of osmotic challenge, overall the school sharks exhibited higher gill Na+/K+-ATPase activity and ubiquitin concentrations in routine and experimental conditions, a larger heat-shock protein response and a smaller decrease in routine oxygen consumption during the hyposmotic exposure, suggesting that there are species-specific responses that could potentially affect their ability to withstand longer or more severe changes in salinity.

In addition, many rivers globally are impacted by dams, which have many negative effects on fishes by altering flow, blocking fish passage, and changing sediment composition. However, in some systems, dams present an opportunity to manage river temperature through regulated releases of cooler water. For example, there is a government mandate for Kenney dam operators in the Nechako river, British Columbia, Canada, to maintain river temperature <20 degrees C in July and August to protect migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). However, there is another endangered fish species inhabiting the same river, Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and it is unclear if these current temperature regulations, or timing of the regulations, are suitable for spawning and developing sturgeon. In this study, we aimed to identify upper thermal thresholds in white sturgeon embryos and larvae to investigate if exposure to current river temperatures are playing a role in recruitment failure. We incubated embryos and yolk-sac larvae in three environmentally relevant temperatures (14, 18 and 21 degrees C) throughout development to identify thermal thresholds across different levels of biological organization. Our results demonstrate upper thermal thresholds at 21 degrees C across physiological measurements in embryo and yolk-sac larvae white sturgeon. Before hatch, both embryo survival and metabolic rate were reduced at 21 degrees C. After hatch, sublethal consequences continued at 21 degrees C because larval sturgeon had decreased thermal plasticity and a dampened transcriptional response during development. In recent years, the Nechako river has reached 21 degrees C by the end of June, and at this temperature, a decrease in sturgeon performance is evident in most of the traits measured. As such, the thermal thresholds identified here suggest current temperature regulations may not be suitable for developing white sturgeon and future recruitment.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad032,11,1,NA,coad032,Conservation; development; sturgeon

Heat stress biomarkers can indicate where warming is most likely affecting fish populations; however, we often lack clear classifications that separate individuals with and without heat stress needed to make these tools operational. We conducted a heat exposure experiment with trials lasting 12 or 36 h using juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) to validate heat stress biomarkers in white muscle. Following habituation to 13 degrees C, individuals were exposed to water temperatures that increased to 15 degrees C, 17 degrees C, 19 degrees C, 21 degrees C or 23 degrees C. Heat shock protein 70 abundance (HSP70 measured by ELISA) and transcription of 13 genes (mRNA measured by qPCR) including three heat shock protein genes (hsp70, hsp90, hsp27) were measured. A distinct heat stress response was apparent by 21 degrees C in juvenile Chinook salmon and 23 degrees C in juvenile coho salmon using HSP70. A threshold for heat stress classification in Chinook salmon of > 2 ng HSP70 mg(.1) total protein identified heat stress in 100\% of 21 and 23 degrees C treated individuals compared to 4\% in cooler treatments. For coho salmon, > 3 ng HSP70 mg(.1) total protein identified heat stress in 100\% of 23 degrees C treated individuals compared to 4\% in cooler treatments. Transcription from a panel of genes separated individuals between cooler and stressful temperature experiences (>= 21 degrees C for Chinook salmon and >= 23 degrees C for coho salmon) with similar to 85\% correct classification. Our findings indicate that juvenile Chinook salmon were more temperature-sensitive than juvenile coho salmon and support the use of a HSP70 threshold sampled from muscle for assessing heat stress in individual wild Pacific salmon with an option for non-lethal biopsies for spawning adults.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad092,11,1,NA,coad092,habitat; heat stress; mortality; Pacific salmon; sublethal; thermal stress; water temperature

B. and Diamond, Sarah E. E.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Physiological traits are often used for vulnerability assessments of organismal responses to climate change. Trait values can change dramatically over the life cycle of organisms but are typically assessed at a single developmental stage. Reconciling ontogenetic changes in physiological traits with vulnerability assessments often reveals early life-stage vulnerabilities. The degree to which ontogenetic changes in physiological traits are due to changes in body mass over development versus stage-specific responses determines the degree to which mass can be used as a proxy for vulnerability. Here, we use the painted lady butterfly, Vanessa cardui, to test ontogenetic changes in two physiological traits, the acute thermal sensitivity of routine metabolic rate (RMR Q(10)) and the critical thermal maximum (CTmax). RMR Q(10) generally followed ontogenetic changes in body mass, with stages characterized by smaller body mass exhibiting lower acute thermal sensitivity. However, CTmax was largely decoupled from ontogenetic changes in body mass. In contrast with trends from other studies showing increasing vulnerability among progressively earlier developmental stages, our study revealed highly erratic patterns of vulnerability across ontogeny. Specifically, we found the lowest joint-trait vulnerability (both RMR Q(10) and CTmax) in the earliest developmental stage we tested (3rd instar larvae), the highest vulnerabilities in the next two developmental stages (4th and 5th instar larvae), and reduced vulnerability into the pupal and adult stages. Our study supports growing evidence of mechanistic decoupling of physiology across developmental stages and suggests that body mass is not a universal proxy for all physiological trait indicators of climate vulnerability.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad058,11,1,NA,coad058,Developmental trajectory; global change vulnerability; long-distance seasonal migration; thermal physiology; thermal sensitivity; thermal tolerance

Andrew R. and Pratt, Thomas C. and Mandrak, Nicholas E.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Climate change is increasing water temperature variability, with consequences for small-bodied fishes with limited migratory ability. We assessed seasonal variation in critical thermal maximum and thermal safety margin of an imperilled fish, demonstrating that its physiological ability to manage warming temperatures depends on its recent thermal history. Organisms living in environments with oscillating temperatures may rely on plastic traits to sustain thermal tolerance during high temperature periods. Phenotypic plasticity in critical thermal maximum (CTmax) is a powerful thermoregulative strategy that enables organisms to adjust CTmax when ambient temperatures do not match thermal preference. Given that global temperatures are increasing at an unprecedented rate, identifying factors that affect the plastic response in CTmax can help predict how organisms are likely to respond to changes in their thermal landscape. Using an experimental thermal chamber in the field, we investigated the effect of short-term acclimation on the CTmax and thermal safety margin (TSM) of wild-caught redside dace, Clinostomus elongatus, (n = 197) in a northern population in Two Tree River, Ontario. Streamside CTmax trials were used to identify the maximum temperature at which redside dace maintain equilibrium, providing a powerful tool for understanding how thermal stress affects individual performance. CTmax and TSM of redside dace were sensitive to changes in temperature, regardless of season, suggesting that temperature pulses caused by climate change or urban activities can impose negative fitness consequences year round. Interestingly, an individual's recent thermal history was more influential to its thermal tolerance than the current ambient water temperature. While the CTmax of redside dace increased with body size, the effect of body size on TSM remains unclear based on our models. The results provide insight into the thermal performance of redside dace that, to date, has been difficult to assess due to the species' rarity and lack of suitable streamside protocols.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa081,8,1,NA,coaa081,Climate change; endangered; long-term acclimation; phenotypic plasticity; short-term acclimation

Andrew R. and Power, Michael",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Anthropogenic stressors are predicted to increase water temperature, which can influence physiological, individual, and population processes in fishes. We assessed the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) of eastern sand darter (Ammocrypta pellucida), a small benthic fish listed as threatened under the Species at Risk Act in Canada. Field trials were conducted stream side June-November 2019 in the Grand River, Ontario, to encompass a range of ambient water temperatures (7-25.C) for which agitation temperature (T-ag) and CTmax were determined. Additional measures were taken in the comparatively more turbid Thames River to test the effect of turbidity on both measures. In the Grand, T-ag and CTmax ranged from 23 degrees C to 33 degrees C and 27 degrees C to 37 degrees C, respectively, and both significantly increased with ambient water temperature, with a high acclimation response ratio (0.49). The thermal safety margin (difference between ambient temperatures and CTmax) was smallest in July and August (similar to 11 degrees C) indicating that eastern sand darter lives closer to its physiological limit in summer. The between-river comparison indicated that turbidity had no significant influence on T-ag and CTmax. Comparison of CTmax with in-river temperatures suggested that mean stream temperature 24 hours before the trial was most important for determining CTmax. Fish mass, temperature variance and maximum temperature in the 24-hour period prior to the CTmax trialwere also shown to have some effect on determining CTmax. Overall, study results better define the sensitivity of eastern sand darter to temperature changes across the growing season and provide information to assess the availability of suitable thermal habitat for conservation purposes.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab057,9,NA,NA,coab057,Agitation; critical thermal maximum; eastern sand darter; seasonal variation; species at risk; turbidity

We paid special attention to the effect of temperature. This may help to develop catch welfare indicators used to measure the stress that fish may experience during catch and eventual release. Thermal stress can influence the recovery of fish released after capture. Vitality assessments using reflex and behavioural responses require that responses can be observed reliably, independent of temperature. Here, we tested whether reflex and behavioural impairment and survival of beam-trawled and discarded European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) are independent from seasonal air and water temperature deviations. In total, 324 beam-trawled plaice (n = 196 in summer and n = 128 in winter) were exposed to two air temperature treatments and two water treatments (i.e. modified and ambient temperatures for both). The modified treatments (i.e. cooled in summer, warmed in winter) represent the thermal shock a fish may experience when being returned to the water. All reflexes and tested behaviours were affected by ambient temperature, with high impairment noted in summer. None of the reflexes were affected by temperature shocks alone, only body flex was. Body flex was highly impaired under every exposure combination. Fish size and duration of air exposure further influenced impairment of reflexes such as head complex and tail grab. More generally, post-release survival was assessed as 21\% {[}95\% CI: 16-28\%] in summer and 99\% {[}97-100\%] in winter. Beam trawling in summer is likely to induce high reflex impairment and mortality in discarded plaice, and therefore spatial-temporal mitigation approaches should be prioritized over control of on-board temperatures.",2024,10.1093/conphys/coae036,12,1,NA,coae036,Animal reflexes; discard survival; poikilothermic; temperature tolerance

However, it is important to validate non-invasive endocrine sampling techniques in field conditions to ensure that the method provides a reliable parameter of physiological stress in the species. This is because endocrine measurements are highly species specific and FCM concentrations can be influenced by environmental factors. Here, we studied the impact of the decay rate of FCMs and intra-sample variation of FCMs using a previously validated EIA. To determine the decay rate of FCMs, we measured FCMs in freshly deposited tiger faeces (n = 8 tigers and 48 scats) that were randomly exposed to the natural environment (dry conditions with no rainfall) for up to 192 h. To determine intra-sample variation in FCMs, we used 10 scats from 10 tigers, divided each sample into four sections and each section into four sub-sections and measured FCMs in each section and sub-section. The results of this decay-rate experiment showed that FCMs in tiger faeces began to decay after 48 h exposure to the environmental conditions available. Thus, FCMs within freshly deposited tiger faeces are influenced by available environmental conditions. Changes in weather conditions (e.g. increased rainfall and humidity) could influence the stability of FCMs. The results of the intra-sample variation study showed that inter-variation among scats accounted for 52\% of the variations in FCMs, while intra-sample variation between sections (32\%) was greater than the sub-sample variation (16\%). Intra-sample variation can be reduced by homogenizing the entire lyophilized faecal sample prior to the EIA. In conclusion, careful evaluation of decay rate and complete homogenization of faeces prior to EIA analysis will increase the reliability of FCMs as a non-invasive index of physiological stress in the tiger.",2015,10.1093/conphys/cov053,3,NA,NA,cov053,Conservation physiology; field endocrine sampling; intra-sample variation; natural weathering; physiological stress; tiger (Panthera tigris)

The ecosystem contains nutrients, producers, consumers, decomposers and detritus. All three living groups consist of somatic structure and either one (consumers and decomposers) or two (producers) reserve compartments, hence the living matter is described by seven state variables. Four types of detritus are distinguished. As the system is closed for matter, the dynamics of the nutrients carbon dioxide and ammonium follow automatically from the dynamics of the other 11 state variables. All DEB organisms in the model are V1-morphs, which means that surface area of each organism is proportional to volume. The resulting ontogenetic symmetry implies that complicated modelling of size structure is not required. The DEB V1-morph model is explained in detail, and the same holds for the idea of synthesizing units, which plays a key role in DEB modelling.

article,Physiologically informed organismal climatologies reveal unexpected spatiotemporal trends in temperature,"Foulk, Aubrey and Gouhier, Tarik and Choi, Francis and Torossian, Jessica L. and Matzelle, Allison and Sittenfeld, David and Helmuth, Brian",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Body temperature is universally recognized as a dominant driver of biological performance. Although the critical distinction between the temperature of an organism and its surrounding habitat has long been recognized, it remains common practice to assume that trends in air temperature-collected via remote sensing or weather stations-are diagnostic of trends in animal temperature and thus of spatiotemporal patterns of physiological stress and mortality risk. Here, by analysing long-term trends recorded by biomimetic temperature sensors designed to emulate intertidal mussel temperature across the US Pacific Coast, we show that trends in maximal organismal temperature ('organismal climatologies') during aerial exposure can differ substantially from those exhibited by co-located environmental data products. Specifically, using linear regression to compare maximal organismal and environmental (air temperature) climatologies, we show that not only are the magnitudes of body and air temperature markedly different, as expected, but so are their temporal trends at both local and biogeographic scales, with some sites showing significant decadal-scale increases in organismal temperature despite reductions in air temperature, or vice versa. The idiosyncratic relationship between the spatiotemporal patterns of organismal and air temperatures suggests that environmental climatology cannot be statistically corrected to serve as an accurate proxy for organismal climatology. Finally, using quantile regression, we show that spatiotemporal trends vary across the distribution of organismal temperature, with extremes shifting in different directions and at different rates than average metrics. Overall, our results highlight the importance of quantifying changes in the entire distribution of temperature to better predict biological performance and dispel the notion that raw or `corrected' environmental (and specially air temperature) climatologies can be used to predict organismal temperature trends. Hence, despite their widespread coverage and availability, the severe limitations of environmental climatologies suggest that their role in conservation and management policy should be carefully considered.",2024,10.1093/conphys/coae025,12,1,NA,coae025,Body temperature; forecasting; heterogeneity; intertidal; quantile regression; thermal stress

To support current restoration activities, large amounts of seed from M. fraseri have been regularly collected and stored for up to 8 years under standard seed banking conditions (5 degrees C and 20\% relative humidity), though in situ recruitment from directly sown seed is poor. To investigate the underlying constraints to germination on demand, we set out to assess the viability of M. fraseri seeds that had been stored in a restoration seed bank from 6 to 66 months. Seed moisture content (MC) (fresh weight basis) was also determined for seeds with different storage histories to ascertain whether M. fraseri seeds display traits (i.e. high MC) that might suggest non-orthodox seed storage behaviour. The youngest seed accession (6 months old) was found to have a high MC (45.8 +/- 5.4\%-fresh weight basis), and >50\% viability. In comparison, older (>30 months old) accessions were observed to have a marked reduction in both seed MC (10-35\% MC) and viability (0-29.4\%). While preliminary, we conclude that M. fraseri seeds appear to lose viability during conventional storage with younger accessions displaying both a higher seed MC and viability, compared to accessions stored for longer. Given the significance of these results, future research activities are recommended to better understand the interplay between seed MC and storage environment and how this relates to the seasonally dry Mediterranean climate where this species naturally occurs. As well, storage and propagation approaches are proposed to increase success when using M. fraseri for conservation and restorative activities.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad096,11,1,NA,coad096,Conservation; drought stress; ex situ conservation; germination; non-orthodox; recalcitrant; seed ecology; seed storage; threatened flora

Furthermore, while studies suggest that elevated pCO(2) affects the byssal attachment strength of Mytilus trossulus from southern latitudes, pCO(2) and temperature impacts on the byssus strength of other species at higher latitudes remain undocumented. In a 90 day laboratory experiment, we exposed post-spawning adult blue mussels (M. edulis) from Atlantic Canada to three pCO(2) levels (pCO(2) similar to 625, 1295 and 2440 mu atm) at two different temperatures (16 degrees C and 22 degrees C) and assessed energetic reserves on Day 90, byssal attachment strength on Days 30 and 60, and condition index and mortality on Days 30, 60 and 90. Results indicated that glycogen content was negatively affected under elevated temperature, but protein, lipid, and overall energy content were unaffected. Reduced glycogen content under elevated temperature was associated with reduced condition index, reduced byssal thread attachment strength, and increased mortality; elevated pCO(2) had no effects. Overall, these results suggest that the glycogen reserves of post-spawning adult M. edulis are sensitive to elevated temperature, and can result in reduced health and byssal attachment strength, leading to increased mortality. These results are similar to those reported for pre-spawning mussels and suggest that post-spawning blue mussels are tolerant to elevated pCO(2) and sensitive to elevated temperature. In contrast to previous studies, however, elevated pCO(2) did not affect byssus strength, suggesting that negative effects of elevated pCO(2) on byssus strength are not universal.",2018,10.1093/conphys/cox078,6,NA,NA,cox078,global change biology; marine bivalves; nutritional quality; ocean acidification; ocean warming; shellfish health

We investigated whether ecophysiological traits in a rare cycad vary along environmental gradients and with ontogeny to understand intra-specific resource- use variation (e.g. symbiotic nitrogen fixation, nitrogen- and water-use efficiency) and possible species adaptations for different environments. Environmental gradients were characterized with 14 soil and topographic variables. Nitrogen- and water-use efficiency improved with ontogeny (from seedling to juvenile and adult stages) but declined as soil fertility decreased with increasing elevation. Conversely, reliance on symbiotic nitrogen fixation increased with elevation and varied slightly with ontogeny. Improved water-use efficiency at lower elevation and nitrogen fixation at higher elevation may represent key functional strategies for maintaining the lower and upper altitudinal species range limits, especially in arid environments where stressful conditions are intensifying due to climatic and land-use changes. In addition to facilitation linked to the regeneration niche, improved resource- use efficiency linked to the adult niche may strongly influence cycad distribution and persistence in contemporary environments.

As expected, family and temperature variables were most important for predicting RMR and body mass, although population-level differences also existed when family was excluded for more detailed analysis. Additionally, body mass strongly influenced RMR at all life stages except for eyed embryos. When family identity was removed from the analysis, population became the most significant variable.

article,"Mechanistic characterization of waterborne selenite uptake in the water flea, Daphnia magna, indicates water chemistry affects toxicity in coal mine-impacted waters","Klaczek, Chantelle E. and Goss, Greg G. and Glover, Chris N.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Coal mining activity is one of the major sources of elevated selenium concentration in aquatic systems; however, little is known about its uptake mechanisms in aquatic organisms. Here, we demonstrate that high waterborne selenite uptake in the water flea, Daphnia magna, is likely mediated by a phosphate transporter. Concentrations of selenium that exceed regulatory guidelines have been associated with coal mining activities and have been linked to detrimental effects on aquatic ecosystems and the organisms therein. Although the major route of selenium uptake in macroinvertebrates is via the diet, the uptake of waterborne selenite (HSeO3-), the prominent form at circumneutral pH, can be an important contributor to selenium body burden and thus selenium toxicity. In the current study, radiolabelled selenite (Se75) was used to characterize the mechanism of selenite uptake in the water flea, Daphnia magna. The concentration dependence (1-32 mu M) of selenite uptake was determined in 1-hour uptake assays in artificial waters that independently varied in bicarbonate, chloride, sulphate, phosphate and selenate concentrations. At concentrations representative of those found in highly contaminated waters, selenite uptake was phosphate-dependent and inhibited by foscarnet, a phosphate transport inhibitor. At higher concentrations, selenite uptake was dependent on waterborne bicarbonate concentration and inhibited by the bicarbonate transporter inhibitor DIDS (4,4 `-diisothiocyano-2,2 `-stilbenedisulfonic acid). These findings suggest that concentrations of phosphate in coal mining-affected waters could alter selenite uptake in aquatic organisms and could ultimately affect the toxic impacts of selenium in such waters.",2024,10.1093/conphys/coad108,12,1,NA,coad108,Invertebrate; phosphate; transporter; uptake mechanism; waterborne selenite

D.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"The effects of thermal anomalies on tropical coral endosymbiosis can be mediated by a range of environmental factors, which in turn ultimately influence coral health and survival. One such factor is the water flow conditions over coral reefs and corals. Although the physiological benefits of living under high water flow are well known, there remains a lack of conclusive experimental evidence characterizing how flow mitigates thermal stress responses in corals. Here we use in situ measurements of flowin a variety of reef habitats to constrain the importance of flowspeeds on the endosymbiosis of an important reef building species under different thermal regimes. Under highflowspeeds (0.15 m s(-1)) and thermal stress, coral endosymbionts retained photosynthetic function and recovery capacity for longer compared to low flow conditions (0.03 m s(-1)). We hypothesize that this may be due to increased rates of mass transfer of key metabolites under higher flow, putatively allowing corals to maintain photosynthetic efficiency for longer. We also identified a positive interactive effect between high flow and a prestress, sub-lethal pulse in temperature. While higher flow may delay the onset of photosynthetic stress, it does not appear to confer long-term protection; sustained exposure to thermal stress (eDHW accumulation equivalent to 4.9 degrees C weeks) eventually overwhelmed the coral meta-organism as evidenced by eventual declines in photo-physiological function and endosymbiont densities. Investigating flow patterns at the scale of metres within the context of these physiological impacts can reveal interesting avenues for coral reef management.

The blunt-nosed leopard lizard (Gambelia sila) is a federally endangered species that, despite protection, remains in extremely arid, hot areas and may be at risk of extirpation due to climate change. We collected data on the field-active body temperatures, preferred body temperatures and upper thermal tolerance of G. sila. We then described available thermal habitat using biophysical models, which allowed us to (i) describe patterns in lizard body temperatures, microhabitat temperatures and lizard microhabitat use; (ii) quantify the lizards' thermoregulatory accuracy; (iii) calculate the number of hours they are currently thermally restricted in microhabitat use; (iv) project how the number of restricted hours will change in the future as ambient temperatures rise; and (v) assess the importance of giant kangaroo rat burrows and shade-providing shrubs in the current and projected future thermal ecology of G. sila. Lizards maintained fairly consistent daytime body temperatures over the course of the active season, and use of burrows and shrubs increased as the season progressed and ambient temperatures rose. During the hottest part of the year, lizards shuttledamongkangaroo rat burrows, shrubs, and open habitat to maintain body temperatures below their upper thermal tolerance, but, occasionally, higher than their preferred body temperature range. Lizards are restricted from staying in the open habitat for 75\% of daylight hours and are forced to seek refuge under shrubs or burrows to avoid surpassing their upper thermal threshold.

A. and Comeau, Luc A. and Bejaoui, Nejla and Perez, Fiz F. and Babarro, Jose M. F.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"The impact of simulated seawater acidification and warming conditions on specimens of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis locally adapted to very distinct, widely separated sites in the Mediterranean Sea (Tunisia) and Atlantic Sea (Galicia, NW Spain) was evaluated in relation to key behavioural and eco-physiological parameters. Over the 2-month exposure to the experimental conditions, mussels were fed optimally to ensure that there are no synergistic interactions between climate change drivers and energetic status of the individuals. In general, regardless of origin (Atlantic or Mediterranean), the mussels were rather resilient to acidification for most of the parameters considered and they were able to grow in strongly acidified seawater through an increased feeding activity. However, shell strength decreased (40\%) consistently in both mussel populations held in moderately and highly acidified seawater. The observed reduction in shell strength was not explained by slight alterations in organic matter, shell thickness or aragonite:calcite ratio. The combined effects of high acidification and warming on the key response of byssus strength caused a strong decline in mussel performance, although only in Galician mussels, in which the valve opening time decreased sharply as well as condition index (soft tissue state) and shell growth. By contrast, the observed negative effect of highly acidified scenario on the strength of Tunisian mussel shells was (partly but not totally) counterbalanced by the higher seawater temperature. Eco-physiological and behavioural interactions in mussels in relation to climate change are complex, and future scenarios for the ecology of the species and also the feasibility of cultivating them in Atlantic and Mediterranean zones are discussed.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coaa114,9,NA,NA,coaa114,Marine mussel; ecophysiology; climate change

Due to non-random targeting of individuals and high rates of mortality, commercial fishing can produce particularly strong selective pressures. Although numerous studies have documented the evolutionary impacts of fishing, little is known about the combined effects of environmental change and fishing-associated selection on physiological and behavioural traits. Here, using zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model organism in a scaled-down trawl fishery, we show that capture rate increases by similar to 7-fold under hypoxic conditions (35\% air saturation) as compared to fishing innormoxia. Additionally, the repeatability of both capture vulnerability and swimming performance decreases considerably, suggesting that oxygen availability can affect selection on particular traits. The increase in capture vulnerability is accompanied by a decrease in swimming performance (as indicated by critical swimming speed) during exposure to hypoxia, suggesting a functional link between these two integrative phenotypic traits. We observed no strong relationship between capture vulnerability and metabolic variables (standard metabolic rate and maximum metabolic rate). Our findings highlight that prevailing environmental conditions can influence harvest-associated selectivity by influencing trait repeatability and altering among individual trait variation. These effects suggest a disrupted capacity for trait-based selection in an increasingly hypoxic aquatic environment.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz082,7,NA,NA,coz082,metabolic rate; fisheries-induced evolution; swimming performance; environmental stress; trawling

This study characterized faecal glucocorticoid metabolites in female fishing cats housed at Chiang Mai Night Safari to investigate seasonal and age relationships in hormone patterns. Faecal samples were collected 3 days/week for 1 year from seven females ranging in age from 4.5 to 9.6 years. A corticosterone enzyme immunoassay was validated for fishing cats by showing increases (similar to 60\%) in faecal glucocorticoid immunoactivity above pre-treatment baseline levels within 1-2 days after an adrenocorticotrophic hormone injection. Faecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations were not related to age (P > 0.05), but there was a seasonal effect, with concentrations being higher (P < 0.05) during the winter (1.54 +/- 0.04 mu g/g) and rainy season (1.43 +/- 0.04 mu g/g) compared with the summer (1.22 +/- 0.05 mu g/g). Significant relationships were found between faecal glucocorticoids and rainfall (positive) and day length (negative), but not a temperature-humidity index. This is the first study to assess adrenal steroidogenic activity in female fishing cats, and we found that glucocorticoid metabolite production was influenced by seasonal factors, but not by age.

article,Intrinsic and extrinsic influences on standard metabolic rates of three species of Australian otariid,"Ladds, Monique A. and Slip, David J. and Harcourt, Robert G.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"The study of marine mammal energetics can shed light on how these animals might adapt to changing environments. Their physiological potential to adapt will be influenced by extrinsic factors, such as temperature, and by intrinsic factors, such as sex and reproduction. We measured the standard metabolic rate (SMR) of males and females of three Australian otariid species (two Australian fur seals, three New Zealand fur seals and seven Australian sea lions). Mean SMR ranged from 0.47 to 1.05 I O-2 min(-1), which when adjusted for mass was from 5.33 to 7.44 ml O-2 min(-1) kg(-1). We found that Australian sea lion mass-specific SMR (sSMR; in millilitres of oxygen per minute per kilogram) varied little in response to time of year or moult, but was significantly influenced by sex and water temperature. Likewise, sSMR of Australian and New Zealand fur seals was also influenced by sex and water temperature, but also by time of year (pre-moult, moult or post-moult). During the moult, fur seals had significantly higher sSMR than at other times of the year, whereas there was no discernible effect of moult for sea lions. For both groups, females had higher sSMR than males, but sea lions and fur seals showed different responses to changes in water temperature. The sSMR of fur seals increased with increasing water temperature, whereas sSMR of sea lions decreased with increasing water temperature. There were no species differences when comparing animals of the same sex. Our study suggests that fur seals have more flexibility in their physiology than sea lions, perhaps implying that they will be more resilient in a changing environment.",2017,10.1093/conphys/cow074,5,NA,NA,cow074,Metabolic rate; otariid; sex; water temperature

Here, we examine the extent of variation in tolerance of acute exposure to these stressors within and among five strains of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) currently being used or under consideration for use in stocking programmes in British Columbia, Canada. We used incipient lethal oxygen saturation (ILOS) as an index of acute hypoxia tolerance, critical thermal maximum (CTmax) as an index of acute upper thermal tolerance and mortality following these two acute exposure trials to assess the relative resilience of individuals and strains to climate change-relevant stressors. We measured tolerance across two brood years and two life stages (fry and yearling), using a highly replicated design with hundreds of individuals per strain and life stage. There was substantial within-strain variation in CTmax and ILOS, but differences among strains, although statistically significant, were small. In contrast, there were large differences in post-trial mortality among strains, ranging from less than 2\% mortality in the most resilient strain to 55\% mortality in the least resilient. There was a statistically significant, but weak, correlation between CTmax and ILOS at both life stages for some strains, with thermally tolerant individuals tending to be hypoxia tolerant. These data indicate that alternative metrics of tolerance may result in different conclusions regarding resilience to climate change stressors, which has important implications for stocking and management decisions for fish conservation in a changing climate.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab095,9,NA,NA,coab095,upper thermal tolerance; inter-individual variation; ILOS; hypoxia tolerance; fish; CTmax; Climate change
article,Employing individual measures of baseline glucocorticoids as population-level conservation biomarkers: considering within-individual variation in a breeding passerine,"Madliger, Christine L. and Love, Oliver P.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Labile physiological variables, such as stress hormones {[}i.e. glucocorticoids (GCs)], allow individuals to react to perturbations in their environment and may therefore reflect the effect of disturbances or positive conservation initiatives in advance of population-level demographic measures. Although the application of GCs as conservation biomarkers has been of extensive interest, few studies have explicitly investigated whether baseline GC concentrations respond to disturbances consistently across individuals. However, confirmation of consistent responses is of paramount importance to assessing the ease of use of GCs in natural systems and to making valid interpretations regarding population-level change (or lack of change) in GC concentrations. We investigated whether free-ranging female tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) display individually specific changes in baseline glucocorticoid concentrations naturally over the breeding season (from incubation to offspring provisioning) and in response to a manipulation of foraging profitability (representing a decrease in access to food resources). We show that baseline GC concentrations are repeatable within individuals over reproduction in natural conditions. However, in response to a reduction in foraging ability, baseline GC concentrations increase at the population level but are not repeatable within individuals, indicating a high level of within-individual variation. Overall, we suggest that baseline GCs measured on a subset of individuals may not provide a representative indication of responses to environmental change at the population level, and multiple within-individual measures may be necessary to determine the fitness correlates of GC concentrations. Further validation should be completed across a variety of taxa and life-history stages. Moving beyond a traditional cross-sectional approach by incorporating repeated-measures methods will be necessary to assess the suitability of baseline GCs as biomarkers of environmental change and population persistence, particularly from a logistical and ease-of-use perspective for conservation managers.",2016,10.1093/conphys/cow048,4,NA,NA,cow048,Biomarker; consistency; corticosterone; individual variation; repeatability; tree swallow
article,Riding out the storm: depleted fat stores and elevated hematocrit in a small bodied endotherm exposed to severe weather,"Freeman, N. E. and Gustafson, M. and Hefley, T. J. and Boyle, W. A.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"In the mid-continental grasslands of North America, climate change is increasing the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. Increasingly severe storms and prolonged periods of elevated temperatures can impose challenges that adversely affect an individual's condition and, ultimately, survival. However, despite mounting evidence that extreme weather events, such as heavy rain storms, can impose short-term physiological challenges, we know little regarding the putative costs of such weather events. To determine the consequences of extreme weather for small endotherms, we tested predictions of the relationships between both severe precipitation events and wet bulb temperatures (an index that combines temperature and humidity) prior to capture with body composition and hematocrit of grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) caught during the breeding season at the Konza Prairie Biological Station, Kansas, USA, between 2014 and 2016. We measured each individual's fat mass, lean mass and total body water using quantitative magnetic resonance in addition to their hematocrit. Individuals exposed to storms in the 24 hours prior to capture had less fat reserves, more lean mass, more water and higher hematocrit than those exposed to moderate weather conditions. Furthermore, individuals stored more fat if they experienced high wet bulb temperatures in the week prior to capture. Overall, the analysis of these data indicate that extreme weather events take a physiological toll on small endotherms, and individuals may be forced to deplete fat stores and increase erythropoiesis to meet the physiological demands associated with surviving a storm. Elucidating the potential strategies used to cope with severe weather may enable us to understand the energetic consequences of increasingly severe weather in a changing world.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad011,11,1,NA,coad011,QMR; precipitation; lean mass; fat stores; energetics; body composition
article,Native trees show conservative water use relative to invasive trees: results from a removal experiment in a Hawaiian wet forest,"Cavaleri, Molly A. and Ostertag, Rebecca and Cordell, Susan and Sack, Lawren",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"While the supply of freshwater is expected to decline in many regions in the coming decades, invasive plant species, often `high water spenders', are greatly expanding their ranges worldwide. In this study, we quantified the ecohydrological differences between native and invasive trees and also the effects of woody invasive removal on plot-level water use in a heavily invaded mono-dominant lowland wet tropical forest on the Island of Hawaii. We measured transpiration rates of co-occurring native and invasive tree species with and without woody invasive removal treatments. Twenty native Metrosideros polymorpha and 10 trees each of three invasive species, Cecropia obtusifolia, Macaranga mappa and Melastoma septemnervium, were instrumented with heat-dissipation sap-flux probes in four 100 m(2) plots (two invaded, two removal) for 10 months. In the invaded plots, where both natives and invasives were present, Metrosideros had the lowest sap-flow rates per unit sapwood, but the highest sap-flow rates per whole tree, owing to its larger mean diameter than the invasive trees. Stand-level water use within the removal plots was half that of the invaded plots, even though the removal of invasives caused a small but significant increase in compensatory water use by the remaining native trees. By investigating the effects of invasive species on ecohydrology and comparing native vs. invasive physiological traits, we not only gain understanding about the functioning of invasive species, but we also highlight potential water-conservation strategies for heavily invaded mono-dominant tropical forests worldwide. Native-dominated forests free of invasive species can be conservative in overall water use, providing a strong rationale for the control of invasive species and preservation of native-dominated stands.",2014,10.1093/conphys/cou016,2,1,NA,cou016,Invaded forest; invasive species removal experiment; lowland wet forest; Metrosideros polymorpha; sap flux; transpiration
article,Molting strategies of Arctic seals drive annual patterns in metabolism,"Thometz, Nicole M. and Hermann-Sorensen, Holly and Russell, Brandon and Rosen, David A. S. and Reichmuth, Colleen",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Arctic seals, including spotted (Phoca largha), ringed (Pusa hispida) and bearded (Erignathus barbatus) seals, are directly affected by sea ice loss. These species use sea ice as a haul-out substrate for various critical functions, including their annual molt. Continued environmental warming will inevitably alter the routine behavior and overall energy budgets of Arctic seals, but it is difficult to quantify these impacts as their metabolic requirements are not well known-due in part to the difficulty of studying wild individuals. Thus, data pertaining to species-specific energy demands are urgently needed to better understand the physiological consequences of rapid environmental change. We used open-flow respirometry over a four-year period to track fine-scale, longitudinal changes in the resting metabolic rate (RMR) of four spotted seals, three ringed seals and one bearded seal trained to participate in research. Simultaneously, we collected complementary physiological and environmental data. Species-specific metabolic demands followed expected patterns based on body size, with the largest species, the bearded seal, exhibiting the highest absolute RMR (0.48 +/- 0.04 L O-2 min(-1)) and the lowest mass-specific RMR (4.10 +/- 0.47 ml O-2 min(-1) kg(-1)), followed by spotted (absolute: 0.33 +/- 0.07 L O-2 min(-1); mass-specific: 6.13 +/- 0.73 ml O-2 min(-1) kg(-1)) and ringed (absolute: 0.20 +/- 0.04 L O-2 min(-1); mass-specific: 7.01 +/- 1.38 ml O-2 min(-1) kg(-1)) seals. Further, we observed clear and consistent annual patterns in RMR that related to the distinct molting strategies of each species. For species that molted over relatively short intervals-spotted (33 +/- 4 days) and ringed (28 +/- 6 days) seals-metabolic demands increased markedly in association with molt. In contrast, the bearded seal exhibited a prolonged molting strategy (119 +/- 2 days), which appeared to limit the overall cost of molting as indicated by a relatively stable annual RMR. These findings highlight energetic trade-offs associated with different molting strategies and provide quantitative data that can be used to assess species-specific vulnerabilities to changing conditions.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coaa112,9,NA,NA,coaa112,Bearded seals; climate change; resting metabolic rate; ringed seals; sea ice loss; spotted seals
article,Applying a gene-suite approach to examine the physiological status of wild-caught walleye (<i>Sander vitreus</i>),"Jeffrey, Jennifer D. and Carlson, Hunter and Wrubleski, Dale and Enders, Eva C. and Treberg, Jason R. and Jeffries, Ken M.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Molecular techniques have been increasingly used in a conservation physiology framework to provide valuable information regarding the mechanisms underlying responses of wild organisms to environmental and anthropogenic stressors. In the present study, we developed a reference gill transcriptome for walleye (Sander vitreus), allowing us to pair a gene-suite approach (i.e. multiple genes across multiple cellular processes) with multivariate statistics to examine the physiological status of wild-caught walleye. For molecular analyses of wild fish, the gill is a useful target for conservation studies, not only because of its importance as an indicator of the physiological status of fish but also because it can be biopsied non-lethally. Walleye were non-lethally sampled following short- (similar to 1.5 months) and long-term (similar to 3.5 months) confinement in the Delta Marsh, which is located south of Lake Manitoba in Manitoba, Canada. Large-bodied walleye are confined in the Delta Marsh from late April to early August by exclusion screens used to protect the marsh from invasive common carp (Cyprinus carpio), exposing fish to potentially stressful water quality conditions. Principal components analysis revealed patterns of transcript abundance consistent with exposure of fish to increasingly high temperature and low oxygen conditions with longer holding in the marsh. For example, longer-term confinement in the marsh was associated with increases in the mRNA levels of heat shock proteins and a shift in the mRNA abundance of aerobic to anaerobic metabolic genes. Overall, the results of the present study suggest that walleye confined in the Delta Marsh may be exhibiting sub-lethal responses to high temperature and low oxygen conditions. These results provide valuable information for managers invested in mediating impacts to a local species of conservation concern. More broadly, we highlight the usefulness of pairing transcriptomic techniques with multivariate statistics to address potential confounding factors that can affect measured physiological responses of wild-caught fish.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa099,8,NA,NA,coaa099,NA
article,Can fisheries bioenergetics modelling refine spatially explicit assessments of climate change vulnerability?,"Troia, Matthew J. and Perkin, Joshuah S.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Rising water temperature under climate change is affecting the physiology, population dynamics and geographic distribution of freshwater taxa. We propose a novel application of individual-based bioenergetics modelling (BEM) to assess the physiological impacts of warming on freshwater fishes across broad spatial extents. We test this approach using the Guadalupe bass (Micropterus treculii), a species of conservation and recreational significance that is endemic to central TX, USA. We projected historical-to-future changes (middle 20th century to end of 21st century) in daily bioenergetics of individual fish across 7872 stream reaches and compared this output to changes in reach occupancy derived from traditional species distribution modelling (SDM). SDMs project an 8.7\% to 52.1\% decrease in reach occupancy, depending on model parameterizations and climate change scenarios. Persistence is projected in the central Edwards Plateau region, whereas extirpations are projected for the warmer southeastern region. BEM projected a median 79.3\% and 143.2\% increase in somatic growth of age-1 Guadalupe bass across historically occupied reaches under moderate and severe climate change scenarios, respectively. Higher end-of-year body size under future climate was caused by a longer growing season. Future scenarios exploring suppressed or enhanced prey consumption suggest that small changes in prey availability will have relatively greater effects on growth than forecasted changes in temperature. Projected growth was geographically discordant with SDM-based habitat suitability, suggesting that SDMs do not accurately reflect fundamental thermal niche dimensions. Our assessment suggests that for locations where the species persists, Guadalupe bass may benefit from warming, although realized consumption gains will depend on seasonal, spatially varying changes in prey availability and other biotic and abiotic factors. More generally, we demonstrate that uniting species-specific BEM with spatially explicit climate change projections can elucidate the physiological impacts of climate change-including seasonal variation-on freshwater fishes across broad geographic extents to complement traditional SDM.",2022,10.1093/conphys/coac035,10,1,NA,coac035,NA

R. and Wilson, Chris C.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"The capacity of ectotherms to cope with rising temperatures associated with climate change is a significant conservation concern as the rate of warming is likely too rapid to allow for adaptative responses in many populations. Transgenerational plasticity (TGP), if present, could potentially buffer some of the negative impacts of warming on future generations. We examined TGP in lake trout to assess their inter-generational potential to cope with anticipated warming. We acclimated adult lake trout to cold (10 degrees C) or warm (17 degrees C) temperatures for several months, then bred them to produce offspring from parents within a temperature treatment (cold-acclimated and warm-acclimated parents) and between temperature treatments (i.e. reciprocal crosses). At the fry stage, offspring were also acclimated to cold (11 degrees C) or warm (15 degrees C) temperatures. Thermal performance was assessed by measuring their critical thermal maximum (CTM) and the change in metabolic rate during an acute temperature challenge. From this dataset, we also determined their resting and peak (highest achieved, thermally induced) metabolic rates. There was little variation in offspring CTM or peak metabolic rate, although cold-acclimated offspring from warm-acclimated parents exhibited elevated resting metabolic rates without a corresponding increase in mass or condition factor, suggesting that transgenerational effects can be detrimental when parent and offspring environments mismatch. These results suggest that the limited TGP in thermal performance of lake trout is unlikely to significantly influence population responses to projected increases in environmental temperatures.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab021,9,NA,NA,coab021,Climate change; critical thermal maximum; transgenerational plasticity; lake trout; thermal tolerance; epigenetic

In the Hawaiian Islands, many of the endemic species have narrow habitat ranges that make them especially vulnerable to climate change. The Hawaiian Drosophila, a remarkably diverse group of species with 11 listed as federally endangered, are thought to be sensitive to temperature changes. To examine the species differences in sensitivity of Hawaiian picture-wing Drosophila to temperature changes, wild populations of Drosophila sproati, a relatively common species, and Drosophila silvestris, a rare species, were collected from two locations on Hawaii Island and bred in common laboratory conditions. Adult flies were exposed to hot and cold temperatures and compared with adult flies at control temperatures. Drosophila silvestris adults were less tolerant to heat stress than D. sproati for both survival and sperm mobility. In contrast, D. silvestris adults were more tolerant to cold stress than D. sproati for adult survival. The expression of 4950 Gene Ontology annotated gene transcripts was also analysed in high-temperature-treated and control males to identify candidate genes related to heat tolerance. There were more than twice as many transcripts differentially expressed after high temperature treatment for D. silvestris (246 transcripts) as for D. sproati (106 transcripts), with 13 Gene Ontology terms enriched between temperatures for D. silvestris and merely three in D. sproati. The combined results are consistent with D. sproati occurring more widely today as well as occurring at lower elevations than D. silvestris and with a genetically based temperature response, which is more severe in D. silvestris at high temperatures than that in D. sproati. These experiments demonstrate the potential for different capacities of species to adapt to future climate change conditions as well as providing an explanation for historical changes in the distribution of species.",2015,10.1093/conphys/cou062,3,NA,NA,cou062,gene expression; Hawaiian Drosophila; local adaptation; microarray; sperm mobility; temperature tolerance
article,Evolution of plasticity in the city: urban acorn ants can better tolerate more rapid increases in environmental temperature,"Diamond, Sarah E. and Chick, Lacy D. and Perez, Abe and Strickler, Stephanie A. and Zhao, Crystal",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Because cities contain high levels of impervious surfaces and diminished buffering effects of vegetation cover, urbanized environments can warm faster over the day and exhibit more rapid warming over space due to greater thermal heterogeneity in these environments. Whether organismal physiologies can adapt to these more rapid spatio-temporal changes in temperature rise within cities is unknown, and exploring these responses can inform not only how plastic and evolutionary mechanisms shape organismal physiologies, but also the potential for organisms to cope with urban development. Here, we examined how plasticity in thermal tolerance under faster and slower rates of temperature change might evolve in response to the more rapid spatio-temporal temperature rise in cities. We focused on acorn ants, a temperature-sensitive, ground-dwelling ant species that makes its home inside hollowed out acorns. We reared acorn ant colonies from urban and rural populations under a common garden design in the laboratory and assessed the thermal tolerances of F1 offspring workers using both fast (1 degrees C min(-1)) and slow (0.2 degrees C min(-1)) rates of temperature change. Relative to the rural population, the urban population exhibited higher heat tolerance when the temperature was increased quickly, providing evidence that temperature ramp-rate plasticity evolved in the urban population. This result was correlated with both faster rates of diurnal warming in urban acorn ant nest sites and greater spatial heterogeneity in environmental temperature across urban foraging areas. By contrast, rates of diurnal cooling in acorn ant nest sites were similar across urban and rural habitats, and correspondingly, we found that urban and rural populations responded similarly to variation in the rate of temperature decrease when we assessed cold tolerance. Our study highlights the importance of considering not only evolutionary differentiation in trait means across urbanization gradients, but also how trait plasticity might or might not evolve.",2018,10.1093/conphys/coy030,6,NA,NA,coy030,Thermal tolerance; microclimate; physiology; phenotypic plasticity; evolution; urban heat island

Identifying refugia with thermally resistant corals and understanding their thermal adaptation strategy is therefore urgent to guide conservation actions. The Gulf of Aqaba (GoA, northern Red Sea) is considered a climate refuge, hosting corals that may originate from populations selected for thermal resistance in the warmer waters of the Gulf of Tadjoura (GoT, entrance to the Red Sea and 2000 km south of the GoA). To better understand the thermal adaptation strategy of GoA corals, we compared the temperature optima (T-opt) of six common reef-building coral species from the GoA and the GoT by measuring oxygen production and consumption rates as well as photophysiological performance (i.e. chlorophyll fluorescence) in response to a short heat stress. Most species displayed similar T-opt between the two locations, highlighting an exceptional continuity in their respective physiological performances across such a large latitudinal range, supporting the GoA refuge theory. Stylophora pistillata showed a significantly lower T-opt in the GoA, which may suggest an ongoing population-level selection (i.e. adaptation) to the cooler waters of the GoA and subsequent loss of thermal resistance. Interestingly, all T-opt were significantly above the local maximum monthly mean seawater temperatures in the GoA (27.1 degrees C) and close or below in the GoT (30.9 degrees C), indicating that GoA corals, unlike those in the GoT, may survive ocean warming in the next few decades. Finally, Acropora muricata and Porites lobata displayed higher photophysiological performance than most species, which may translate to dominance in local reef communities under future thermal scenarios. Overall, this study is the first to compare the T-opt of common reef-building coral species over such a latitudinal range and provides insights into their thermal adaptation in the Red Sea.",2022,10.1093/conphys/coac002,10,1,NA,coac002,thermal adaptation; Red Sea; Gulf of Tadjoura; Gulf of Aqaba; coral reefs; Coral bleaching
article,The effects of thermal acclimation on cardio-respiratory performance in an Antarctic fish (<i>Notothenia coriiceps</i>),"Joyce, William and Axelsson, Michael and Egginton, Stuart and Farrell, Anthony P. and Crockett, Elizabeth L. and O'Brien, Kristin M.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"The Southern Ocean has experienced stable, cold temperatures for over 10 million years, yet particular regions are currently undergoing rapid warming. To investigate the impacts of warming on cardiovascular oxygen transport, we compared the cardio-respiratory performance in an Antarctic notothenioid (Notothenia coriiceps) that was maintained at 0 or 5 degrees C for 6.0-9.5 weeks. When compared at the fish's respective acclimation temperature, the oxygen consumption rate and cardiac output were significantly higher in 5 degrees C-acclimated than 0 degrees C-acclimated fish. The 2.7-fold elevation in cardiac output in 5 degrees C-acclimated fish (17.4 vs. 6.5 ml min(-1) kg(-1)) was predominantly due to a doubling of stroke volume, likely in response to increased cardiac preload, as measured by higher central venous pressure (0.15 vs. 0.08 kPa); tachycardia was minor (295 vs. 25.2 beats min(-1)). When fish were acutely warmed, oxygen consumption rate increased by similar amounts in 0 degrees C- and 5 degrees C-acclimated fish at equivalent test temperatures. In both acclimation groups, the increases in oxygen consumption rate during acute heating were supported by increased cardiac output achieved by elevating heart rate, while stroke volume changed relatively little. Cardiac output was similar between both acclimation groups until 12 degrees C when cardiac output became significantly higher in 5 degrees C-acclimated fish, driven largely by their higher stroke volume. Although cardiac arrhythmias developed at a similar temperature (similar to 14.5 degrees C) in both acclimation groups, the hearts of 5 degrees C-acclimated fish continued to pump until significantly higher temperatures (CTmax for cardiac function 17.7 vs. 15.0 degrees C for 0 degrees C-acclimated fish). These results demonstrate that N. coriiceps is capable of increasing routine cardiac output during both acute and chronic warming, although the mechanisms are different (heart rate-dependent versus primarily stroke volume-dependent regulation, respectively).

The lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) is a cold-adapted salmonid and a relict from the last ice age that is well suited as a model species for studying the predicted effects of climate change on coldwater fishes. We investigated the thermal acclimation capacity of upper temperature resistance and metabolism of lake trout from four populations across four acclimation temperatures. Individuals were reared from egg fertilization onward in a common environment and, at 2 years of age, were acclimated to 8, 11, 15 or 19 degrees C. Although one population had a slightly higher maximal metabolic rate (MMR), higher metabolic scope for activity and faster metabolic recovery across all temperatures, there was no interpopulation variation for critical thermal maximum (CTM) or routine metabolic rate (RMR) or for the thermal acclimation capacity of CTM, RMR, MMR or metabolic scope. Across the four acclimation temperatures, there was a 3 degrees C maximal increase in CTM and 3-fold increase in RMR for all populations. Above 15 degrees C, a decline in MMR and increase in RMR resulted in sharply reduced metabolic scope for all populations acclimated at 19 degrees C. Together, these data suggest there is limited variation among lake trout populations in thermal physiology or capacity for thermal acclimatization, and that climate change may impact lake trout populations in a similar manner across a wide geographical range. Understanding the effect of elevated temperatures on the thermal physiology of this economically and ecologically important cold-adapted species will help inform management and conservation strategies for the long-term sustainability of lake trout populations.",2014,10.1093/conphys/cou025,2,1,NA,cou025,Climate change; metabolic rate; physiology; Salvelinus namaycush; temperature; thermal acclimation

Andrew R. and Power, Michael",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Metabolic rate and hypoxia tolerance are highly variable among individual fish in a stable environment. Understanding the variability of these measures in wild fish populations is critical for assessing adaptive potential and determining local extinction risks as a result of climate-induced fluctuations in temperature and hypoxic conditions. We assessed the field metabolic rate (FMR) and two hypoxia tolerance metrics, oxygen pressure at loss of equilibrium (PO2 at LOE) and critical oxygen tolerance (P-crit) of wild-captured eastern sand darter (Ammocrypta pellucida), a threatened species in Canada, using field trials (June to October) that encompassed ambient water temperatures and oxygen conditions typically experienced by the species. Temperature was significantly and positively related to hypoxia tolerance but not FMR. Temperature alone explained 1\%, 31\% and 7\% of the variability observed in FMR, LOE, and P-crit, respectively. Environmental and fish-specific factors such as reproductive season and condition explained much of the residual variation. Reproductive season significantly affected FMR by increasing it by 159-176\% over the tested temperature range. Further understanding the impact of reproductive season on metabolic rate over a temperature range is crucial for understanding how climate change could impact species fitness. Among-individual variation in FMR significantly increased with temperature while among-individual variation in both hypoxia tolerance metrics did not. A large degree of variation in FMR in the summer might allow for evolutionary rescue with increasing mean and variance of global temperatures. Findings suggest that temperature may be a weak predictor in a field setting where biotic and abiotic factors can act concurrently on variables that affect physiological tolerance. We measured the hypoxia tolerance and metabolic rate of the threatened eastern sand darter across multiple seasons in a field setting and demonstrated that temperature is a weak predictor of metabolic rate and hypoxia tolerance of this species.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad008,11,1,NA,coad008,species at risk; seasonal variation; oxygen tolerance; field metabolic rate; conservation physiology; individual variation

Semi-arid southern California and the relatively mesic environments of California's Channel Islands provide a model system for examining drought responses of plants in potential climate change refugia. Most methods for detecting refugia are focused on `exposure' of organisms to certain abiotic conditions, which fail to assess how local adaptation or acclimation of plant traits (i.e. `sensitivity') contribute to or offset the benefits of reduced exposure. Here, we use a comparative plant hydraulics approach to characterize the vulnerability of plants to drought, providing a framework for identifying the locations and trait patterns that underlie functioning climate change refugia. Seasonal water relations, xylem hydraulic traits and remotely sensed vegetation indices of matched island and mainland field sites were used to compare the response of native plants from contrasting island and mainland sites to hotter droughts in the early 21st century. Island plants experienced more favorable water relations and resilience to recent drought. However, island plants displayed lowplasticity/adaptation of hydraulic traits to local conditions, which indicates that relatively conserved traits of island plants underlie greater hydraulic safety and localized buffering from regional drought conditions. Our results provide an explanation for how California's Channel Islands function as a regional climate refugia during past and current climate change and demonstrate a physiology-based approach for detecting potential climate change refugia in other systems.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coz115,8,NA,NA,coz115,chaparral; climate change; climate refugia; drought; hydraulic safety margins; island ecosystems

H. sanguineus is native to Japan and China but has successfully invaded the Atlantic coast of North America and Europe. In the invaded areas, H. sanguineus is becoming a keystone species as driver of community structure and the adults compete with the shore crab Carcinus maenas. Strong osmoregulatory abilities may confer the potential to use and invade coastal areas already earlier in the life cycle. We reared larvae and first juveniles at 24 degrees C in seawater from hatching to intermoult of each developmental stage (zoea I-V, megalopa, crab I). We exposed each stage to a range of salinities (0-39 ppt) for 24 h, and then we quantified haemolymph osmolality, using nano-osmometry. In addition, we quantified osmolality in field-collected adults after acclimation to the test salinities for 6 days. Larvae of H. sanguineus were able to hyper-osmoregulate at low salinities (15 and 20 ppt) over the complete larval development, although the capacity was reduced at the zoeal stage V; at higher salinities (25-39 ppt), all larval stages were osmoconformers. The capacity to slightly hypo-regulate at high salinity appeared in the first juvenile. Adults were able to hyper-osmoregulate at low salinities and hypo-regulate at concentrated seawater (39 ppt). H. sanguineus showed a strong capacity to osmoregulate as compared to its native competitor C. maenas, which only hyper-regulates at the first and last larval stages and does not hypo-regulate at the juvenile-adult stages. The capacity of H. sanguineus to osmoregulate over most of the life cycle should underpin the potential to invade empty niches in the coastal zone (characterized by low salinity and high temperatures). Osmoregulation abilities over the whole life cycle also constitute a strong competitive advantage over C. maenas.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab094,9,1,NA,coab094,shore crab; osmoregulation; ontogeny; larva; Invasive species

Differential drought impact on conspecific individuals within a population has been reported, but no clear mechanistic explanation for this pattern has emerged.

We investigated differences in water and carbon metabolism, and xylem anatomy as a function of crown health status, as well as eventual genotypic basis of contrasting drought responses. H and D trees exploited the same water pools and relied on similar hydraulic strategies to cope with drought stress. Genetic analyses did not highlight differences between groups in terms of geographical provenance. Hydraulic and anatomical analyses showed conflicting results. The hydraulic tracheid diameter and theoretical hydraulic conductivity were similar, but D trees were characterized by lower water transport efficiency, greater vulnerability to xylem conduit implosion and reduced carbohydrate stores.

Moose (Alces alces) accumulate body energy and nutrient stores during summer, while reducing the impact of warm temperatures through physiological and behavioural thermoregulation. Building on the animal indicator concept, we used rumen temperature sensors and GPS collars on captive moose (n = 6) kept in large natural enclosures to evaluate how behaviour and habitat selection influence the rate of change in rumen temperature during the growing season on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska, USA. We compared movement and habitat selection of individual females during tolerance days (daily amplitude in rumen temperature was >= 1.2 degrees C in 24 h) with those of control days (daily amplitude in rumen temperature was < 1.2 degrees C) before and after the tolerance day. Moose moved more during tolerance days (172 m . h(-1); 95\% confidence intervals (CI) = 149-191 m . h(-1)) than on control days (151 m . h(-1); 95\% CI = 128-173 m . h(-1)). The rate of change in rumen temperature (degrees C . h(-1)) declined with low to moderate movement rates that were probably associated with foraging in all habitats. Movement only increased the rate of change in rumen temperature at high activity (similar to > 500 m . h(-1)). Additionally, the relationship between rate of change in rumen temperature and movement rate was different during tolerance and control days in open meadow and wetland habitats. In all habitats except wetlands, the rate of change in rumen temperature increased while resting, which probably is a result of diet-induced thermogenesis. Our study demonstrates that the behavioural choices of moose on the landscape are associated with the rate of change in rumen temperature and their ability to thermoregulate. Wildlife managers must consider high-value habitats where wildlife can employ both behavioural and physiological mechanisms to tolerate warm ambient conditions in a landscape of forage, predators and pests.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coaa130,9,NA,NA,coaa130,Activity; Alaska; Alces alces; behaviour; moose; rumen temperature; thermoregulation

By 2050, climate change may result in temperature increases of 2.1-3.4 degrees C in Manitoba, Canada. Lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, from both northern and southern populations in Manitoba were acclimated to 16, 20 and 24 degrees C for 30 days, after which critical thermal maximum (CTmax) trials were conducted to investigate their thermal plasticity. We also examined the effects of temperature on morphological and physiological indices. Acclimation temperature significantly influenced the CTmax, body mass, hepatosomatic index, metabolic rate and the mRNA expression of transcripts involved in the cellular response to heat shock and hypoxia (HSP70, HSP90a, HSP90b, HIF-1 alpha) in the gill of lake sturgeon. Population significantly affected the above phenotypes, as well as the mRNA expression of Na+/K+ ATPase-alpha 1 and the hepatic glutathione peroxidase enzyme activity. The southern population had an average CTmax that was 0.71 and 0.45 degrees C higher than the northern population at 20 and 24 degrees C, respectively. Immediately following CTmax trials, mRNA expression of HSP90a and HIF-1 alpha was positively correlated with individual CTmax of lake sturgeon across acclimation treatments and populations (r=0.7, r=0.62, respectively; P<0.0001). Lake sturgeon acclimated to 20 and 24 degrees C had decreased hepatosomatic indices (93 and 244\% reduction, respectively; P<0.0001) and metabolic suppression (27.7 and 42.1\% reduction, respectively; P<0.05) when compared to sturgeon acclimated to 16 degrees C, regardless of population. Glutathione peroxidase activity and mRNA expression Na+/K+ ATPase-alpha 1 were elevated in the northern relative to the southern population.

Anthropogenic activities such as hunting have long been established as potentially detrimental to a population's persistence. However, environmental perturbations such as increased temperature variability, exacerbated by climate change, can also have important effects on animal populations. Animals can respond to these challenges by adjusting both their behavior and physiology. We measured fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGMs) of common impala (Aepyceros melampus) and greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), both currently in stable populations, to examine effects of hunting, forage availability, daily variability in temperature and group size on their physiological stress response. The study was conducted across two adjacent protected areas, (i) one non-hunted area (Ruaha National Park; RNP) and (ii) one area used for trophy hunting (Rungwa Game Reserve; RGR). Both impala and kudu had significantly higher FGM levels in the area that allows hunting, while FGM levels decreased with increasing forage availability and increasing daily temperature. Moreover, impala (but not kudu) had lower FGM levels with larger group sizes. Our results indicate that the management regime can significantly alter the physiological state of wild ungulate populations. We also highlight the importance of considering the combined effects of anthropogenic, environmental and social contexts when studying the stress response of wild populations.

To help define suitable thermal habitat for juvenile Chinook salmon, the thermal performance of juvenile Chinook salmon acclimated to either 15 or 19 degrees C was tested across a range of environmentally relevant acute temperature changes (from 12 to 26 degrees C). Swim tunnel respirometers were used to measure routine oxygen uptake as a measure of routine metabolic rate (RMR) and oxygen uptake when swimming maximally as a measure of maximal metabolic rate (MMR) at each test temperature. We estimated absolute aerobic scope (AAS = MMR - RMR), the capacity to supply oxygen beyond routine needs, as well as factorial aerobic scope (FAS = MMR/RMR). All fish swam at a test temperature of 23 degrees C regardless of acclimation temperature, but some mortality occurred at 25 degrees C during MMR measurements. Overall, RMR and MMR increased with acute warming, but aerobic capacity was unaffected by test temperatures up to 23 degrees C in both acclimation groups. The mean AAS for fish acclimated and tested at 15 degrees C (7.06 +/- 1.76 mg O-2 kg(-1) h(-1)) was similar to that measured for fish acclimated and tested at 19 degrees C (8.80 +/- 1.42 mg O-2 kg(- 1) h(- 1)). Over the entire acute test temperature range, while MMR and AAS were similar for the two acclimation groups, RMR was significantly lower and FAS consequently higher at the lower test temperatures for the fish acclimated at 19 degrees C. Thus, this stock of juvenile Chinook salmon shows an impressive aerobic capacity when acutely warmed to temperatures close to their upper thermal tolerance limit, regardless of the acclimation temperature. These results are compared with those for other salmonids, and the implications of our findings for informing management actions are discussed.",2017,10.1093/conphys/cow067,5,NA,NA,cow067,Conservation; fish; metabolic rate; metabolism; physiology; plasticity

Both temperature and food supply can influence development time, growth, and metabolism of marine fishes, particularly during larval stages. However, little is known of the relative importance and potential interacting effects of ocean warming and changes to food supply on the performance of larval fishes. We tested this for larvae of the coral reef anemonefish, Amphiprion percula, in an orthogonal experiment comprising three temperatures and three feeding schedules. Temperatures were chosen to represent present-day summer averages (29.2 degrees C) and end-of-century climate change projections of +1.5 degrees C (30.7 degrees C) and +3 degrees C (32.2 degrees C). Feeding schedules were chosen to represent a reduction in access to food (fed daily, every 2 days, or every 3 days). Overall, larvae took longer to settle at higher temperatures and with less frequent feeding, and there was a significant interaction between these factors. Time to metamorphosis was fastest in the 30.7 degrees C and high food availability treatment (10.5 +/- 0.2 days) and slowest in the 32.2 degrees C and low food availability treatment (15.6 +/- 0.5 days; i.e. 50\% faster). Fish from the lower feeding regimens had a lower body condition and decreased survivorship to metamorphosis. Routine oxygen consumption rates were highest for fish raised at 32.2 degrees C and fed every third day (1620 +/- 107 mg O-2 kg(-1) h(-1)) and lowest for fish raised at 29.2 degrees C and fed daily (1220 +/- 101 mg O-2 kg(-1) h(-1); i.e. 35\% lower). The elevated routine oxygen consumption rate, and therefore greater energy use at higher temperatures, may leave less energy available for growth and development, resulting in the longer time to metamorphosis.

However, little is known about the basic biology/physiology of this skate, or how it may respond to future environmental challenges predicted from climate change and/or increases in human activities such as aquaculture. These skate live at a preferred depth of 5-15 m where the dissolved oxygen (DO) levels are moderate (similar to 55\% air saturation), but can be found in areas of the Harbour whereDOcan range from100\% saturation to anoxia. Given that the water at their preferred depth is already hypoxic, we sought to investigate their response to further decreases in DO that may arise from potential increases in anthropogenic stress. We measured oxygen consumption, haematological parameters, tissue and enzyme capacity and heat shock protein (HSP) levels in skate exposed to 55\% dissolved O-2 saturation (control) and 20\% dissolved O-2 saturation (hypoxic) for 48 h. We conclude that the Maugean skate appears to be an oxyconformer, with a decrease in the rate of O-2 consumption with increasing hypoxia. Increases in blood glucose and lactate at 20\% O-2 suggest that skate are relying more on anaerobic metabolism to tolerate periods of very low oxygen. Despite these metabolic shifts, there was no difference in HSP70 levels between groups, suggesting this short-term exposure did not elicit a cellular stress response. The metabolic state of the skate suggests that low oxygen stress for longer periods of time (i.e.>48 h) may not be tolerable and could potentially result in loss of habitat or shifts in their preferred habitat.

Fisheries capture and handling can be both exhausting and stressful to fish, which can limit their ability to swim and survive after release. As a result, researchers have assessed methods intended to improve post-release survival by assisting the flow of water over the gills of fish prior to release. Such approaches use recovery bags or boxes that direct water over the gills of restrained fish. This study evaluated a method of assisting ventilation that mimics one often employed by recreational anglers (i.e. holding fish facing into a current). Under laboratory conditions, wild Fraser River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) either received manual ventilation assistance for 1 min using a jet of water focused at the mouth or were left to recover unassisted following a capture-and-release simulation. A control group consisted of fish that were not exposed to the simulation or ventilation assistance. The experiment was conducted at 16 and 21 degrees C, average and peak summer water temperatures for the Fraser River, and fish survival was monitored for 33 days. At 21 degrees C, all fish perished within 3 days after treatment in all experimental groups, highlighting the consequences of handling adult sockeye salmon during elevated migration temperatures. Survival was higher at 16 degrees C, with fish surviving on average 15-20 days after treatment. At 16 degrees C, the capture-and-release simulation and ventilation assistance did not affect the survival of males; however, female survival was poor after the ventilation assistance compared with the unassisted and control groups.

However, many physiological measurements gain increased context when measured with a reference point that represents the optimal performance and the capacity to withstand stress. Here, we discuss the best practices for plant physiological status and reference point measurements in conservation biology. Plant species of concern often occupy narrow habitat ranges, making climate change an outsized potential threat to their conservation and restoration. Understanding the physiological status of a species during stress has the potential to elucidate current risk and provide an outlook on population maintenance. However, the physiological status of a plant can be difficult to interpret without a reference point, such as the capacity to tolerate stress before loss of function, or mortality. We address the application of plant physiology to conservation biology by distinguishing between two physiological approaches that together determine plant status in relation to environmental conditions and evaluate the capacity to avoid stress-induced loss of function. Plant physiological status indices, such as instantaneous rates of photosynthetic gas exchange, describe the level of physiological activity in the plant and are indicative of physiological health. When such measurements are combined with a reference point that reflects the maximum value or environmental limits of a parameter, such as the temperature at which photosynthesis begins to decline due to high temperature stress, we can better diagnose the proximity to potentially damaging thresholds. Here, we review a collection of useful plant status and reference point measurements related to photosynthesis, water relations and mineral nutrition, which can contribute to plant conservation physiology. We propose that these measurements can serve as important additional information to more commonly used phenological and morphological parameters, as the proposed parameters will reveal early warning signals before they are visible.

Nevertheless, food shortage, interacting with high temperature, led to an increase in latency response and a significant reduction inRMRs. Recent literature suggests that anthropogenic stressors can disrupt ecologically relevant behaviours in fish, such as the ability to escape from predators. Disruption of these behaviours at critical life history transitions, such as the transition from the pelagic environment to the juvenile/adult habitat, may have even greater repercussions. The literature suggests that an increase in temperature can affect fish escape response, as well as metabolism; however, few studies have focused on the acute sensitivity responses and the potential for acclimation through developmental plasticity. Here, we aimed at evaluating the acute and long-term effects of exposure to warming conditions on the escape response and routine metabolic rate (RMR) of early life stages of the white seabream, Diplodus sargus. Additionally, as food availability may modulate the response to warming, we further tested the effects of long-term exposure to high temperature and food shortage, as individual and interacting drivers, on escape response and RMR. Temperature treatments were adjusted to ambient temperature (19 degrees C) and a high temperature (22 degrees C). Feeding treatments were established as high ration and low ration (50\% of high ration). Escape response and RMR were measured after the high temperature was reached (acute exposure) and after 4 weeks (prolonged exposure). Acute warming had a significant effect on escape response and generated an upward trend in RMR. In the long term, however, there seems to be an acclimation of the escape response and RMR. Food shortage, interacting with high temperature, led to an increase in latency response and a significant reduction in RMR.

The delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), a small semi-anadromous fish endemic to the SFE and considered an indicator species, is close to extinction in the wild. The goal of this study was to investigate how environmental alterations to the SFE, such as reductions in turbidities, higher temperatures and increased prevalence of invasive predators affect the physiology and stress response of juvenile delta smelt. Juvenile delta smelt were exposed to two temperatures (17 and 21 \& DEG;C) and two turbidities (1-2 and 10-11 NTU) for 2 weeks. After the first week of exposure, delta smelt were exposed to a largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) predator cue at the same time every day for 7 days. Fish were measured and sampled on the first (acute) and final (chronic) day of exposures to predator cues and later analyzed for whole-body cortisol, glucose, lactate, and protein. Length and mass measurements were used to calculate condition factor of fish in each treatment. Turbidity had the greatest effect on juvenile delta smelt and resulted in reduced cortisol, increased glucose and lactate, and greater condition factor. Elevated temperatures reduced available energy in delta smelt, indicated by lower glucose and total protein, whereas predator cue exposure had negligible effects on their stress response. This is the first study to show reduced cortisol in juvenile delta smelt held in turbid conditions and adds to the growing data that suggest this species performs best in moderate temperatures and turbidities. Multistressor experiments are necessary to understand the capacity of delta smelt to respond to the multivariate and dynamic changes in their natural environment, and results from this study should be considered for management-based conservation efforts.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad036,11,1,NA,coad036,supplementation; San Francisco Estuary; delta smelt; conservation; climate change
article,Methods matter: considering locomotory mode and respirometry technique when estimating metabolic rates of fishes,"Rummer, Jodie L. and Binning, Sandra A. and Roche, Dominique G. and Johansen, Jacob L.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Respirometry is frequently used to estimate metabolic rates and examine organismal responses to environmental change. Although a range of methodologies exists, it remains unclear whether differences in chamber design and exercise (type and duration) produce comparable results within individuals and whether the most appropriate method differs across taxa. We used a repeated-measures design to compare estimates of maximal and standard metabolic rates (MMR and SMR) in four coral reef fish species using the following three methods: (i) prolonged swimming in a traditional swimming respirometer; (ii) short-duration exhaustive chase with air exposure followed by resting respirometry; and (iii) short-duration exhaustive swimming in a circular chamber. We chose species that are steady/prolonged swimmers, using either a body-caudal fin or a median-paired fin swimming mode during routine swimming. Individual MMR estimates differed significantly depending on the method used. Swimming respirometry consistently provided the best (i.e. highest) estimate of MMR in all four species irrespective of swimming mode. Both short-duration protocols (exhaustive chase and swimming in a circular chamber) produced similar MMR estimates, which were up to 38\% lower than those obtained during prolonged swimming. Furthermore, underestimates were not consistent across swimming modes or species, indicating that a general correction factor cannot be used. However, SMR estimates (upon recovery from both of the exhausting swimming methods) were consistent across both short-duration methods. Given the increasing use of metabolic data to assess organismal responses to environmental stressors, we recommend carefully considering respirometry protocols before experimentation. Specifically, results should not readily be compared across methods; discrepancies could result in misinterpretation of MMR and aerobic scope.",2016,10.1093/conphys/cow008,4,NA,NA,cow008,Body-caudal fin swimming; carangiform; circular swimming chamber; labriform; median-paired fin swimming; oxygen consumption rate

Using metabolism, the oxygen-and capacity-limitation of thermal tolerance (OCLTT) hypothesis provides a tool to predict the responses of ectothermic animals to variation in temperature, oxygen availability and pH in the aquatic environment. The hypothesis remains controversial, however, and has been questioned in several studies. A positive relationship between aerobic metabolic scope and animal activity would be consistent with the OCLTT but has rarely been tested. Moreover, the performance model and the allocation model predict positive and negative relationships, respectively, between standard metabolic rate and activity. Finally, animal activity could be affected by individual morphology because of covariation with cost of transport. Therefore, we hypothesized that individual variation in activity is correlated with variation in metabolism and morphology. To test this prediction, we captured 23 wild European perch (Perca fluviatilis) in a lake, tagged them with telemetry transmitters, measured standard and maximal metabolic rates, aerobic metabolic scope and fineness ratio and returned the fish to the lake to quantify individual in situ activity levels. Metabolic rates were measured using intermittent flow respirometry, whereas the activity assay involved high-resolution telemetry providing positions every 30 s over 12 days. We found no correlation between individual metabolic traits and activity, whereas individual fineness ratio correlated with activity. Independent of body length, and consistent with physics theory, slender fish maintained faster mean and maximal swimming speeds, but this variation did not result in a larger area (in square metres) explored per 24 h. Testing assumptions and predictions of recent conceptual models, our study indicates that individual metabolism is not a strong determinant of animal activity, in contrast to individual morphology, which is correlated with in situ activity patterns.",2016,10.1093/conphys/cov055,4,NA,NA,cov055,Aerobic metabolic scope; fineness ratio; morphology; OCLTT hypothesis; performance and allocation models; standard metabolic rate

This complex behaviour enables animals to exploit many temporally productive and spatially discrete habitats to accrue various fitness benefits (e.g. growth, reproduction, predator avoidance). Human activities and global environmental change represent potential threats to migrating animals (from individuals to species), and research is underway to understand mechanisms that control migration and how migration responds to modern challenges. Focusing on behavioural and physiological aspects of migration can help to provide better understanding, management and conservation of migratory populations. Here, we highlight different physiological, behavioural and biomechanical aspects of animal migration that will help us to understand how migratory animals interact with current and future anthropogenic threats. We are in the early stages of a changing planet, and our understanding of how physiology is linked to the persistence of migratory animals is still developing; therefore, we regard the following questions as being central to the conservation physiology of animal migrations. Will climate change influence the energetic costs of migration? Will shifting temperatures change the annual clocks of migrating animals? Will anthropogenic influences have an effect on orientation during migration? Will increased anthropogenic alteration of migration stopover sites/migration corridors affect the stress physiology of migrating animals? Can physiological knowledge be used to identify strategies for facilitating the movement of animals? Our synthesis reveals that given the inherent challenges of migration, additional stressors derived from altered environments (e.g. climate change, physical habitat alteration, light pollution) or interaction with human infrastructure (e.g. wind or hydrokinetic turbines, dams) or activities (e.g. fisheries) could lead to long-term changes to migratory phenotypes. However, uncertainty remains because of the complexity of biological systems, the inherently dynamic nature of the environment and the scale at which many migrations occur and associated threats operate, necessitating improved integration of physiological approaches to the conservation of migratory animals.",2016,10.1093/conphys/cov072,4,NA,NA,cov072,Behaviour; energetics; human impacts; mechanism; movement

L. and Byrne, Phillip G.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Temperature and food availability are known to independently trigger phenotypic change in ectotherms, but the interactive effects between these factors have rarely been considered. This study investigates the independent and interactive effects of water temperature and food availability on larval growth and development of the critically endangered Baw Baw frog, Philoria frosti. Larvae were reared at low (12 degrees C) or high (17 degrees C) water temperature in the absence or presence of substrate that controlled food availability, and body size and time to metamorphosis were quantified. Growth and development of larvae was influenced by the individual effects of temperature and food availability; time to metamorphosis was shorter in warm water treatment groups and in the presence of substrate and increased food. Unexpectedly, however, water temperature and food availability did not have an interactive effect on either time to metamorphose or body size at metamorphosis. Under all treatment groups, metamorphic onset occurred once a developmental size threshold was reached, indicating that growth rate and body size are key factors controlling the metamorphic process in Baw Baw frogs (consistent with the Wilbur-Collins model for ectotherm development). From an applied perspective, our findings have implications for amphibian conservation because they indicate that simple manipulations of temperature and food availability can be used to increase the rate of frog production in conservation breeding programs.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa030,8,NA,NA,coaa030,Development; food availability; growth; phenotypic plasticity; temperature; Wilbur-Collins

Data were collected as soon as possible after securing each turtle onboard the capture vessel and again immediately prior to release. Measured parameters included sea surface temperature, body temperature, morphometric data, sex, heart rate, respiratory rate and various haematological and blood biochemical variables. Results indicated generally stable physiological status in comparison to previously published studies of this species. However, blood pH and blood potassium concentrations increased significantly between the two time points (P = 0.0018 and P = 0.0452, respectively). Turtles were affected by a mild initial acidosis (mean [}SD] temperature-corrected pH = 7.29 {[}0.07]), and blood pH increased prior to release (mean {[}SD] = 7.39 {[}0.07]). Initial blood potassium concentrations were considered normal (mean {[}SD] = 4.2 {[}0.9] mmol/l), but turtles experienced a mild to moderate increase in blood potassium concentrations during the event (mean {[}SD] pre-release potassium = 5.9 {[}1.7] mmol/l, maximum = 8.5 mmol/l). While these data support the general safety of direct capture for study of this species, the observed changes in blood potassium concentrations are of potential concern due to possible adverse effects of hyperkalaemia on cardiac function.

It has been proposed previously that elevated ultraviolet-B radiation (UBVR) and low temperatures may interact in their negative effects on health, immune function and disease susceptibility in exposed amphibians. In the present study, we chronically exposed larvae of the striped-marsh frog (Limnodynastes peronii) to a factorial combination of high and low UVBR and high and low temperature to assess interactive effects on growth, survival and indices of immune function. The high UVBR treatment reduced growth and survival of larvae compared to the low UVBR treatment at both temperatures, but the effects were significantly enhanced at low temperature. High UVBR exposure also induced a chronic inflammatory response as evidenced by an increase in the leucocyte proportion of total cells and altered the ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes in the blood, highlighting a potential mechanistic basis for increased disease susceptibility in amphibians living at high altitudes. Our findings stress the importance of investigating environmental factors in combination when assessing their effects and highlight the mechanistic basis for how key environmental drivers in montane regions affect amphibian health.

In brief, this involved a pressurized liquid extraction with a two-step solid-phase clean-up. A derivatization step was conducted prior to detection. To evaluate the new assay, cortisol was analysed in three different sample types obtained from four harbour porpoises: skin plates, dorsal fin skin plugs (with and without lidocaine) and epidermal scrapes. Skin cortisol concentrations could be measured using the new assay in the majority of the tested skin samples down to a minimal sample size of 49 mg dry weight (dw). Water content ranged from 10 to 46\% in the plug samples, which had SCCs from 2.1 to 77.7 ng/g dw. Epidermal scrape samples had the highest water content (83-87\%) and lower SCCs (0.6-15 ng/g dw), while the skin plates had intermediate water contents (60-66\%) and SCCs of 2.6-13.0 ng/g dw. SCC was slightly higher in plugs with lidocaine than without (average values of 41 and 33 ng/g dw, respectively). Substantial within-individual variations in cortisol concentrations are also common in other matrices such as blood and hair. Some important factors behind this variation could be e.g. the animal's sex, age, body condition, reproductive stage, and the body region sampled, as well as season, moulting cycles and water temperature. Clearly, more research into SCCs is required.

Complex interactions often exist between angler behaviour, environmental conditions, and fish characteristics that ultimately determine biological outcomes for fish. Yet, few studies focus on identifying biologically relevant thresholds. We therefore examined the effects of water temperature, air exposure and fish size on reflex impairment and mortality in brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis exposed to experimental and simulated angling stressors (n = 337). Using conditional inference trees, we identified interactions among these factors as well as threshold values within them that determine brook trout reflex impairment as an indicator of whole animal stress. Specifically, longer air exposure times (>30 sec) and warmer temperatures (>19.5 degrees C) had a synergistic effect leading to higher reflex impairment scores. Further, larger fish (>328 mm) were more sensitive to air exposure durations >10 sec. Of the reflex impairment measures, loss of equilibrium and time to regain equilibrium were strongly and moderately associated with brook trout mortality (18-24 h monitoring), although mortality rates were generally low (6\%). These findings support previous research that has established strong links between these reflex impairment measures and fish health outcomes in other species. They also highlight the important interactions among air exposure duration, water temperature and fish size that determine impairment in brook trout, providing specific thresholds to guide best angling practices for C\&R fisheries. This approach may be widely applicable to generate similar thresholds that can be encouraged by regulators and adopted by anglers for other common C\&R fishes.",2022,10.1093/conphys/coac070,10,1,NA,coac070,water temperature; synergistic effects; recreational fisheries; post-exercise recovery; Air exposure

Larval green (Acipenser medirostris) and white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) inhabit the highly altered Sacramento-San Joaquin watershed, making them logical species to examine vulnerability to entrainment by altered water flows. The risk of larval sturgeon entrainment is influenced by the ontogeny of swimming capacity and dispersal timing and their interactions with water-diversion structure operations. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe and compare the ontogeny and allometry of larval green and white sturgeon swimming capacities until completion of metamorphosis into juveniles. Despite the faster growth rates and eventual larger size of larval white sturgeon, green sturgeon critical swimming velocities remained consistently, though modestly, greater than those of white sturgeon throughout the larval life stage. Although behavioural interactions with water-diversion structures are also important considerations, regarding swimming capacity, Sacramento-San Joaquin sturgeons are most vulnerable to entrainment in February-May, when white sturgeon early larvae are in the middle Sacramento River, and April-May, when green sturgeon early larvae are in the upper river. Green sturgeon migrating downstream to the estuary and bays in October-November are also susceptible to entrainment due to their movements combined with seasonal declines in their swimming capacity. An additional inter-species comparison of the allometric relationship between critical swimming velocities and total length with several sturgeon species found throughout the world suggests a similar ontogeny of swimming capacity with growth. Therefore, although dispersal and behaviour differ among river systems and sturgeon species, similar recommendations are applicable for managers seeking to balance water demands with restoration and conservation of sturgeons worldwide.",2014,10.1093/conphys/cou031,2,1,NA,cou031,Sturgeon; swimming; water diversion

We examined the effects of seasonality on faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) concentrations of free-ranging male and female thick-tailed greater galagos (Otolemur crassicaudatus) in an Afromontane habitat. To do so, we established an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for monitoring fGCM concentrations in the species using a biological validation. Following this, faecal samples were collected each month over the course of a year from free-ranging males and females situated in the Soutpansberg Mountains, Limpopo, South Africa. Multivariate analyses revealed lactation period was a driver offGCM levels, whereas sex and food availability mostly influenced seasonal fGCM concentrations in the total population. Thus far, the results of this study show that drivers of fGCM levels, an indication of increased adrenocortical activity, in O. crassicaudatus are numerous and complex within the natural environment.

Thus, hosts may experience trade-offs resulting from altered investment in immune function under environmental stressors. As such, approaches in ecoimmunology can provide powerful tools to assist in the conservation of wildlife. Here, we provide case studies that explore the diverse ways that ecoimmunology can inform and advance conservation efforts, from understanding how Galapagos finches will fare with introduced parasites, to using methods from human oncology to design vaccines against a transmissible cancer in Tasmanian devils. In addition, we discuss the future of ecoimmunology and present 10 questions that can help guide this emerging field to better inform conservation decisions and biodiversity protection. From better linking changes in immune function to disease outcomes under different environmental conditions, to understanding how individual variation contributes to disease dynamics in wild populations, there is immense potential for ecoimmunology to inform the conservation of imperilled hosts in the face of new and re-emerging pathogens, in addition to improving the detection and management of emerging potential zoonoses.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab074,9,NA,NA,coab074,NA

Larval L. peronii were reared in conditions of either constant or stochastic food availability and in water at three different temperatures (18, 22 and 26 degrees C), and effects on survival, growth and development were quantified. Over the experimental period, larval growth rate was highest and survivorship lowest at the warmest temperature. However, changes in food availability mediated the effects of temperature, with slower larval growth and higher survivorship in stochastic food availability treatments. Tadpoles in the stochastic food availability treatments did not reach metamorphosis during the experimental period, suggesting that developmental stasis may have been induced by food restriction.

article,"Thermal performance of fish is explained by an interplay between physiology, behaviour and ecology","Neubauer, Philipp and Andersen, Ken H.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Increasing temperatures under climate change are thought to affect individual physiology of fish and other ectotherms through increases in metabolic demands, leading to changes in species performance with concomitant effects on species ecology. Although intuitively appealing, the driving mechanism behind thermal performance is contested; thermal performance (e.g. growth) appears correlated with metabolic scope (i.e. oxygen availability for activity) for a number of species, but a substantial number of datasets do not support oxygen limitation of long-term performance. Whether or not oxygen limitations via the metabolic scope, or a lack thereof, have major ecological consequences remains a highly contested question. size and trait-based model of energy and oxygen budgets to determine the relative influence of metabolic rates, oxygen limitation and environmental conditions on ectotherm performance. We show that oxygen limitation is not necessary to explain performance variation with temperature. Oxygen can drastically limit performance and fitness, especially at temperature extremes, but changes in thermal performance are primarily driven by the interplay between changing metabolic rates and species ecology. Furthermore, our model reveals that fitness trends with temperature can oppose trends in growth, suggesting a potential explanation for the paradox that species often occur at lower temperatures than their growth optimum. Our model provides a mechanistic underpinning that can provide general and realistic predictions about temperature impacts on the performance of fish and other ectotherms and function as a null model for contrasting temperature impacts on species with different metabolic and ecological traits.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz025,7,NA,NA,coz025,Climate change; metabolic rate; OCLTT; optimal foraging; thermal performance

Many environmental factors affect variation in these traits, but for fish, hypoxia and size-dependent mortality have become increasingly important because of human activities, such as increased nutrient enrichment (eutrophication), climate warming and selective fishing. Here, we study experimentally the effect of oxygen availability on maturation and growth in guppies (Poecilia reticulata) from two different selected lines, one subjected to positive and the other negative size-dependent fishing. This is the first study to assess the effects of both reduced ambient oxygen and size-dependent mortality in fish. We show that reduced ambient oxygen led to stunting, early maturation and high reproductive investment. Likewise, lineages that had been exposed to high mortality of larger-sized individuals displayed earlier maturation at smaller size, greater investment in reproduction and faster growth. These life-history changes were particularly evident for males. The widely reported trends towards earlier maturation in wild fish populations are often interpreted as resulting from size-selective fishing. Our results highlight that reduced ambient oxygen, which has received little experimental investigation to date, can lead to similar phenotypic changes. Thus, changes in ambient oxygen levels can be a confounding factor that occurs in parallel with fishing, complicating the causal interpretation of changes in life-history traits.

We used annual estimates of the numbers of bears onshore in the core summering area, age/sex structure and body condition data to estimate population energy density and storage energy in Western Hudson Bay polar bears from 1985 to 2018. We examined intra-population variation in energetic patterns, temporal energetic trends and the relationship between population energetics and sea ice conditions. Energy metrics for most demographic classes declined over time in relation to earlier sea ice breakup, most significantly for solitary adult females and subadult males, suggesting their greater vulnerability to nutritional stress than other age/sex classes. Temporal declines in population energy metrics were related to earlier breakup and longer lagged open-water periods, suggesting multi-year effects of sea ice decline. The length of the open-water period ranged from 102 to 166 days and increased significantly by 9.9 days/decade over the study period. Total population energy density and storage energy were significantly lower when sea ice breakup occurred earlier and the lagged open-water period was longer. At the earliest breakup and a lagged open-water period of 180 days, population energy density was predicted to be 33\% lower than our minimum estimated energy density and population storage energy was predicted to be 40\% lower than the minimum estimated storage energy. Consequently, over the study, the total population energy density declined by 53\% (mean: 3668 +/- 386 MJ kg(-1)/decade) and total population storage energy declined by 56\% (mean: 435900 +/- 46770 MJ/decade).

This is especially true in high altitude biodiversity hotspots, where warmer growing seasons and increased drought events may negatively impact populations by limiting regeneration. Here, we test for high-altitude species responses to the interactive effects of warming and drought in Heterotheca brandegeei, a perennial cushion plant endemic to alpine outcroppings in Sierra de San Pedro Martir National Park, Baja California, Mexico. We exposed H. brandegeei seedlings to experimental warming and drought conditions to document early life history responses and the species ability to tolerate climate change. Drought negatively influenced seedling growth, with overall reductions in above- and belowground biomass. Warming and drought each led to substantial reductions in leaf development. At the same time, individuals maintained high specific leaf area and carbon investment in leaves across treatments, suggesting that existing phenotypic variation within populations may be high enough to withstand climate change. However, warming and drought interacted to negatively influence leaf-level water-use efficiency (WUE). Seedling mortality rates were nearly three times higher in warming and drought treatments, suggesting bleak prospects for H. brandegeei populations in future climate conditions. Overall, our results suggest H. brandegeei populations may experience substantial declines under future warmer and drier conditions. Some individuals may be able to establish, albeit, as smaller, more stressed plants. These results further suggest that warming alone may not be as consequential to populations as drought will be in this already water-limited system.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz076,7,NA,NA,coz076,Baja California; chasmophyte; cushion; endemic; germination; Heterotheca; Mexico; outcropping; phenotypic variation; regeneration niche; seedling establishment; Sierra de San Pedro Martir

Given the importance of swimming energetics on fitness, we measured critical swim speed, swimming metabolism, cost of transport, aerobic scope (absolute and factorial) and exercise recovery in adult female and male coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) held for 2 days at 3 environmentally relevant temperatures (9 degrees C, 14 degrees C, 18 degrees C) in fresh water. Critical swimming performance (U-crit) was equivalent between sexes and maximal at 14 degrees C. Absolute aerobic scope was sex- and temperature-independent, whereas factorial aerobic scope decreased with increasing temperature in both sexes. The full cost of recovery from exhaustive exercise (excess post-exercise oxygen consumption) was higher in males compared to females. Immediately following exhaustive exercise (i.e. 1 h), recovery was impaired at 18 degrees C for both sexes. At an intermediate time scale (i.e. 5 h), recovery in males was compromised at 14 degrees C and 18 degrees C compared to females. Overall, swimming, aerobic metabolism, and recovery energetics do not appear to explain the phenomenon of increased mortality rates in female coho salmon.

Here, we used a recently adapted respirometry technique to compare the energetic costs of a temperate fish species (Cymatogaster aggregata) swimming against a steady flow versus cyclical unidirectional and bidirectional surges in which unsteady swimming (such as accelerating, decelerating and turning) occurs. Using oxygen uptake (<(M)over dot>O-2) as an estimate of energetic costs, our results reveal that fish swimming in an unsteady (i.e. cyclical) unidirectional flow showed no clear increase in costs when compared to a steady flow of the same average speed, suggesting that costs and savings from cyclical acceleration and coasting are near equal. Conversely, swimming in a bidirectional cyclical flow incurred significantly higher energetic costs relative to a steady, constant flow, likely due to the added cost of turning around to face the changing flow direction. On average, we observed a 50\% increase in <(M)over dot>O-2 of fish station holding within the bidirectional flow (227.8 mg O-2 kg(-1) h(-1)) compared to a steady, constant flow (136.1 mg O-2 kg(-1) h(-1)) of the same mean velocity. Given wave-driven surge zones are prime fish habitats in the wild, we suggest the additional costs fish incur by station holding in a bidirectional cyclical flow must be offset by favourable conditions for foraging and reproduction. With current and future increases in abiotic stressors associated with climate change, we highlight the importance of incorporating additional costs associated with swimming in cyclical water flow in the construction of energy budgets for species living in dynamic, coastal habitats.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa077,8,NA,NA,coaa077,Cyclical flow; oxygen uptake; respirometry; station holding; swim tunnel
article,Reproductive gene expression in a coral reef fish exposed to increasing temperature across generations,"Veilleux, Heather D. and Donelson, Jennifer M. and Munday, Philip L.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Reproduction in marine fish is generally tightly linked with water temperature. Consequently, when adults are exposed to projected future ocean temperatures, reproductive output of many species declines precipitously. Recent research has shown that in the common reef fish, Acanthochromis polyacanthus, step-wise exposure to higher temperatures over two generations (parents: +1.5 degrees C, offspring: +3.0 degrees C) can improve reproductive output in the F2 generation compared to F2 fish that have experienced the same high temperatures over two generations (F1 parents: +3.0 degrees C, F2 offspring: +3.0 degrees C). To investigate how a step-wise increase in temperature between generations improved reproductive capacity, we tested the expression of well-known teleost reproductive genes in the brain and gonads of F2 fish using quantitative reverse transcription PCR and compared it among control (+0.0 degrees C for two generations), developmental (+3.0 degrees C in second generation only), step (+1.5 degrees C in first generation and +3.0 degrees C in second generation), and transgenerational (+3.0 degrees C for two generations) treatments. We found that levels of gonadotropin receptor gene expression (Fshr and Lhcgr) in the testes were reduced in developmental and transgenerational temperature treatments, but were similar to control levels in the step treatment. This suggests Fshr and Lhcgr may be involved in regulating male reproductive capacity in A. polyacanthus. In addition, lower Fshb expression in the brain of females in all temperature treatments compared to control, suggests that Fshb expression, which is involved in vitellogenesis, is sensitive to high temperatures. Our results help elucidate key genes that facilitate successful reproduction in reef fishes when they experience a gradual increase in temperature across generations consistent with the trajectory of climate change.",2018,10.1093/conphys/cox077,6,NA,NA,cox077,Acanthochromis polyacanthus; climate change; gonadotropins; qRT-PCR; reproduction; transgenerational plasticity
article,Orphaning stunts growth in wild African elephants,"Parker, Jenna M. and Wittemyer, George",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Orphans of several species suffer social and physiological consequences such as receiving more aggression from conspecifics and lower survival. One physiological consequence of orphaning, stunted growth, has been identified in both humans and chimpanzees, but has not been assessed in a non-primate species. Here, we tested whether wild African elephant orphans show evidence of stunted growth. We measured individually known female elephants in the Samburu and Buffalo Springs National Reserves of Kenya, with a rangefinder capable of calculating height, to estimate a von Bertalanffy growth curve for female elephants of the study population. We then compared measurements of known orphans and non-orphans of various ages, using a Bayesian analysis to assess variation around the derived growth curve. We found that orphans are shorter for their age than non-orphans. However, results suggest orphans may partially compensate for stunting through later growth, as orphans who had spent a longer time without their mother had heights more similar to non-orphans. More age mates in an individual's family were associated with taller height, suggesting social support from peers may contribute to increased growth. Conversely, more adult females in an individual's family were associated with shorter height, suggesting within-group competition for resources with older individuals may reduce juvenile growth. Finally, we found a counterintuitive result that less rainfall in the first 6 years of life was correlated with taller height, potentially reflecting the unavoidable bias of measuring individuals who were fit enough to survive conditions of low rainfall as young calves. Reduced growth of individuals has been shown to reduce survival and reproduction in other species. As such, stunting in wildlife orphans may negatively affect fitness and represents an indirect effect of ivory poaching on African elephants.",2022,10.1093/conphys/coac053,10,1,NA,coac053,von Bertalanffy; stunting; orphan; growth; conservation; African elephant
article,Post-exercise respirometry underestimates maximum metabolic rate in juvenile salmon,"Raby, Graham D. and Doherty, Claire L. J. and Mokdad, Ali and Pitcher, Trevor E. and Fisk, Aaron T.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Experimental biologists now routinely quantify maximum metabolic rate (MMR) in fishes using respirometry, often with the goal of calculating aerobic scope and answering important ecological and evolutionary questions. Methods used for estimating MMR vary considerably, with the two most common methods being (i) the `chase method; where fish are manually chased to exhaustion and immediately sealed into a respirometer for post-exercise measurement of oxygen consumption rate ((M) over dot(O2)), and (ii) the `swim tunnel method'; whereby (M) over dot(O2 )is measured while the fish swims at high speed in a swim tunnel respirometer. In this study, we compared estimates for MMR made using a 3-min exhaustive chase (followed by measurement of (M) over dot(O2) in a static respirometer) versus those made via maximal swimming in a swim tunnel respirometer. We made a total of 134 estimates of MMR using the two methods with juveniles of two salmonids (Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) across a 6 degrees C temperature range. We found that the chase method underestimated `true' MMR (based on the swim tunnel method) by ca. 20\% in these species. The gap in MMR estimates between the two methods was not significantly affected by temperature (range of ca. 15-21 degrees C) nor was it affected by body mass (overall range of 53.5236 g). Our data support some previous studies that have suggested the use of a swim tunnel respirometer generates markedly higher estimates of MMR than does the chase method, at least for species in which a swim tunnel respirometer is viable (e.g. `athletic' ram ventilating fishes). We recommend that the chase method could be used as a `proxy' (i.e. with a correction factor) for MMR in future studies if supported by a species-specific calibration with a relevant range of temperatures, body sizes or other covariates of interest.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa063,8,NA,NA,coaa063,Climate change; metabolic scope; oxygen uptake; ram ventilation; thermal biology

Development was arrested in the 15 degrees C group, and survivorship declined to 64\% after 191 days. However, 80\% of the surviving larvae remained alive after the temperature was increased to 25 degrees C. Of these, 96\% reached metamorphosis. Survivorship of the 20, 25 and 30 degrees C acclimation groups was 82, 94 and 66\%, respectively, whereas none survived at 35 degrees C. Time to metamorphosis was significantly shorter for the 25 degrees C group (67 +/- 1 days), followed by the 30 degrees C (98 +/- 2 days) and 20 degrees C (264 +/- 7 days) groups. A linear 66 cm thermal gradient was used to identify temperature ranges selected by tadpoles in the different acclimation groups. Five 10 degrees C gradients (10-20, 15-25, 20-30, 25-35 and 30-40 degrees C) were used, and time spent in the cooler, middle and warmer thirds of the gradient was compared for 10 individuals from each acclimation group. In the coolest gradient, tadpoles from all acclimation groups selected the warmer third (> 17 degrees C) of the gradient. In the warmer gradients, tadpoles from the 20 and 25 degrees C acclimation groups selected temperatures <29 degrees C, while those from the 30 degrees C acclimation group selected temperatures <33 degrees C.

The effects of high and low incubation temperatures on hatchling quality have been previously examined; however, many of these studies were conducted on relocated or laboratory-reared nests, which do not accurately reflect natural nest temperature fluctuations. To observe the impacts of varying in situ incubation temperatures on loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) hatchling morphology, various health variables and locomotor performance, temperature data loggers were deployed in 15 loggerhead nests on Juno Beach, Florida, between May and July 2018. Over the course of the study period, 10 morphological traits were measured, blood analytes and heart rate were assessed for the establishment of reference intervals and the self-righting response in seawater was evaluated. Warmer months were associated with smaller body size and higher body condition index, larger umbilical scar size, slower righting time, lower heart rates and higher packed cell volume, hemoglobin, total solids, total white blood cell count, absolute heterophils and absolute basophils. These findings provide evidence that higher in situ incubation temperatures have the potential to adversely affect hatchlings from warmer nests due to increased risk of predation from smaller body sizes, decreased physical responses and overall fitness, altered hemodynamic balance (e.g. dehydration) and potential inflammation and/or stress. With rising temperatures, we predict sea turtle hatchlings may have increasing risks of developing suboptimal physiological features affecting overall fitness and ultimately survival. These results demonstrate that rising environmental temperatures can negatively impact sea turtle hatchlings, thus representing additional stress on sea turtle populations and contributing to our understanding of potential pathophysiological effects of climate change on the delicate life-stage class of the sea turtle hatchling.

Juvenile Nile perch from distinct habitats (high or low dissolved oxygen concentrations) of Lake Nabugabo, Uganda were exposed for 4.6 +/- 0.55 days to a temperature treatment (25.5, 27.5, 29.5 or 31.5 degrees C) prior to experimentation, with the lowest temperature corresponding to the mean annual daytime temperature in Lake Nabugabo and the highest temperature being 3 degrees C higher than the maximal monthly average. As expected, metabolic rates increased with body mass. Although resting metabolic rate increased with temperature, maximal metabolic rate showed no change. Likewise, AS did not vary across treatments. The CTmax increased with acclimation temperature. There was no effect of habitat on maximal metabolic rate, AS or CTmax; however, there was a trend towards a lower resting metabolic rate for Nile perch captured in the low-dissolved oxygen habitat than in well-oxygenated waters.

article,Thermal physiology and activity in relation to reproductive status and sex in a free-ranging semelparous marsupial,"Parker, Cassandra A. and Geiser, Fritz and Stawski, Clare",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"In a changing climate, southern hemisphere mammals are predicted to face rising temperatures and aridity, resulting in food and water shortages, which may further challenge already constrained energetic demands. Especially semelparous mammals may be threatened because survival of the entire population depends on the success of a single breeding event. One of these species, the yellow-footed antechinus, Antechinus flavipes, a small, heterothermic marsupial mammal, commences reproduction during winter, when insect prey is limited and energetic constraints are high. We examined the inter-relations between thermal and foraging biology of free-ranging A. flavipes and examined whether they use torpor for energy conservation, despite the fact that reproduction and torpor are considered to be incompatible for many mammals. Females used torpor during the reproductive season, but patterns changed with reproductive status. Prior to breeding, females used frequent (86\% of days), deep and long torpor that was more pronounced than any other reproductive group, including pre-mating males (64\% of days). Pregnant females continued to use torpor, albeit torpor was less frequent (28\% of days) and significantly shorter and shallower than before breeding. Parturient and lactating females did not express torpor. During the mating period, males reduced torpor use (24\% of days). Pre-reproductive females and pre-mating maleswere the least active and may use torpor to minimize predator exposure and enhance fat deposition in anticipation of the energetic demands associated with impending mating, gestation and lactation. Reproductive females were most active and likely foraged and fed to promote growth and development of young. Our data show that A. flavipes are balancing energetic demands during the reproductive season by modifying torpor and activity patterns. As the timing of reproduction is fixed for this genus, it is probable that climate change will render these behavioural and physiological adaptations as inadequate and threaten this and other semelparous species.",2019,10.1093/conphys/coz073,7,NA,NA,coz073,body temperature; lactation; mammal; pregnancy; torpor

However, the utility of f at local scales and across heterogenous environments is unknown; yet, these scales are often where actionable management decisions are made. Here, we test if f can delimit the entire distribution of marine organisms when calibrated across an appropriate temperature range and at local scales (similar to 10 km) using the endemic reef fish, Chrysoblephus laticeps, which is found in the highly heterogenous temperature and oxygen environment along the South African coastal zone, as a model species. In laboratory experiments, we find a bidirectional (at 12 degrees C) hypoxia tolerance response across the temperature range tested (8 to 24 degrees C), permitting a piecewise calibration of phi. We then project this calibrated f model through temperature and oxygen data from a high spatial resolution (11 to 13 km) ocean model for the periods 2005 to 2009 and 2095 to 2099 to quantify various magnitudes of phi across space and time paired with complementary C. laticeps occurrence points. Using random forest species distribution models, we quantify a critical phi value of 2.78 below which C. laticeps cannot persist and predict current and future distributions of C. laticeps in line with already observed distribution shifts of other South African marine species. Overall, we find that C. laticeps' distribution is limited by increasing temperatures towards its warm edge but by low oxygen availability towards its cool edge, which is captured within phi at fine scales and across heterogenous oxygen and temperature combinations.

article,The effects of marine heatwaves on a coral reef snapper: insights into aerobic and anaerobic physiology and recovery,"McMahon, Shannon J. and Munday, Philip L. and Donelson, Jennifer M.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Marine heatwaves (MHW) are intensifying, posing a grave threat to coral reefs. We exposed a coral reef mesopredator, Lutjanus carponotatus, to MWH conditions (+1 degrees C and +2 degrees C) for 4 weeks and found increased oxygen consumption, recovery time, haemoglobin, and lactate. Interestingly, several effects persisted for at least 2 weeks post-MWH. Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are increasing in frequency and intensity. Coral reefs are particularly susceptible to MHWs, which cause mass coral bleaching and mortality. However, little is known about how MHWs affect coral reef fishes. Here, we investigated how MHWs affect the physiology of a coral reef mesopredator, Lutjanus carponotatus. Specifically, we exposed mature adults to two different MHW intensities, +1 degrees C (29.5 degrees C) and + 2 degrees C (30.5 degrees C) and measured physiological performance at 2 and 4 weeks of exposure and at 2 weeks post-exposure. At these time points, we measured oxygen consumption at rest and after a simulated fishing capture event, recovery time, excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) and associated biochemical markers in the blood (baseline lactate, post-capture lactate, glucose, haemoglobin levels and haematocrit proportion). We found that 2 weeks of exposure to MHW conditions increased resting oxygen consumption (+1 degrees C = 23\%, +2 degrees C = 37\%), recovery time (+1 degrees C = 62\%, +2 degrees C = 77\%), EPOC (+1 degrees C = 50\%, +2 degrees C = 68\%), baseline lactate (+1 degrees C = 27\%, +2 degrees C = 28\%), post-capture lactate (+1 degrees C = 62\%, +2 degrees C = 109\%) and haemoglobin levels (+1 degrees C = 13\%, +2 degrees C = 28\%). This pattern was maintained at 4 weeks of exposure except for post-capture lactate which was reduced (+1 degrees C = -37\%, +2 degrees C = 27\%). In combination, these results suggest a greater reliance on anaerobic glycolysis to maintain homeostasis in MHW conditions. At 2 weeks post-exposure, when compared to control fish, we found that capture oxygen consumption was increased (+1 degrees C = 25\%, +2 degrees C = 26\%), recovery rate was increased (+2 degrees C = 38\%) and haemoglobin was still higher (+1 degrees C = 15\%, +2 degrees C = 21\%). These results show that MHW conditions have direct physiological demands on adult coral reef snapper and ecologically relevant residual effects can last for at least 2 weeks post-MHW; however, individuals appear to recover from the negative effects experienced during the MHW.

Warming and hypoxia can interact physiologically, but their combined effects during fish development remain poorly studied, particularly stage-specific effects and potential carry-over effects. To test the impacts ofwarmwater temperature and hypoxia as individual and combined developmental stressors, late fall-run Chinook salmon embryos were reared in 10 treatments from fertilization through hatching with two temperatures [}10 degrees C (ambient) and 14 degrees C (warm)], two dissolved oxygen saturation levels {[}normoxia (100\% air saturation, 10.4-11.4 mg O-2/l) and hypoxia (50\% saturation, 5.5 mg O-2/l)] and three exposure times (early {[}eyed stage], late {[}silver-eyed stage] and chronic [}fertilization through hatching]). After hatching, all treatments were transferred to control conditions (10 degrees C and 100\% air saturation) through the fry stage. To study stage-specific effects of stressor exposure we measured routine metabolic rate (RMR) at two embryonic stages, hatching success and growth. To evaluate carry-over effects, where conditions during one life stage influence performance in a later stage, RMR of all treatments was measured in control conditions at two post-hatch stages and acute stress tolerance was measured at the fry stage. We found evidence of stage-specific effects of both stressors during exposure and carry- over effects on physiological performance. Both individual stressors affected RMR, growth and developmental rate while multiple stressors late in development reduced hatching success. RMR post-hatch showed persistent effects of embryonic stressor exposure that may underlie differences observed in developmental timing and acute stress tolerance. The responses to stressors that varied by stage during development suggest that stage-specific management efforts could support salmon embryo survival. The persistent carry-over effects also indicate that considering sub-lethal effects of developmental stressor exposure may be important to understanding how climate change influences the performance of salmon across life stages.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab054,9,NA,NA,coab054,Carry-over effects; developmental windows; hypoxia; multiple stressors

Considerable variation across the rates at which species' ranges change with temperature hinders our ability to forecast range extensions based on climate data alone. To better manage the consequences of ongoing and future range extensions for global marine biodiversity, more information is needed on the biological mechanisms that link temperatures to range limits. This is especially important at understudied, low relative temperatures relevant to poleward range extensions, which appear to outpace warm range edge contractions four times over. Here, we capitalized on the ongoing range extension of a teleost predator, the Australasian snapper Chrysophrys auratus, to examine multiple measures of ecologically relevant physiological performance at the population's poleward range extension front. Swim tunnel respirometry was used to determine how mid-range and poleward range edge winter acclimation temperatures affect metabolic rate, aerobic scope, swimming performance and efficiency and recovery from exercise. Relative to `optimal' mid-range temperature acclimation, subsequent range edge minimum temperature acclimation resulted in absolute aerobic scope decreasing while factorial aerobic scope increased; efficiency of swimming increased while maximum sustainable swimming speed decreased; and recovery from exercise required a longer duration despite lower oxygen payback. Cold-acclimated swimming faster than 0.9 body lengths sec(-1) required a greater proportion of aerobic scope despite decreased cost of transport. Reduced aerobic scope did not account for declines in recovery and lower maximum sustainable swimming speed. These results suggest that while performances decline at range edge minimum temperatures, cold-acclimated snapper are optimized for energy savings and range edge limitation may arise from suboptimal temperature exposure throughout the year rather than acute minimum temperature exposure. We propose incorporating performance data with in situ behaviour and environmental data in bioenergetic models to better understand how thermal tolerance determines range limits.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa045,8,NA,NA,coaa045,Chrysophrys auratus; swim tunnel respirometry; thermal biology; range extension; aerobic scope; Tasmania; Australia
article,Mismatched light and temperature cues disrupt locomotion and energetics via thyroid-dependent mechanisms,"Le Roy, Amelie and Seebacher, Frank",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Animals integrate information from different environmental cues to maintain performance across environmental gradients. Increasing average temperature and variability induced by climate change can lead to mismatches between seasonal cues. We used mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) to test the hypotheses that mismatches between seasonal temperature and light regimes (short days and warm temperature and vice versa) decrease swimming performance, metabolic rates and mitochondrial efficiency and that the responses to light and temperature are mediated by thyroid hormone. We show that day length influenced thermal acclimation of swimming performance through thyroid-dependent mechanisms. Oxygen consumption rates were influenced by acclimation temperature and thyroid hormone. Mitochondrial substrate oxidation rates (state three rates) were modified by the interaction between temperature and day length, and mitochondrial efficiency (P/O ratios) increased with warm acclimation. Using P/O ratios to calibrate metabolic (oxygen consumption) scope showed that oxygen consumption did not predict adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. Unlike oxygen consumption, ATP production was influenced by day length in a thyroid-dependent manner. Our data indicate that oxygen consumption alone should not be used as a predictor of ATP production. Overall, the effects of thyroid hormone on locomotion and energetics were reversed by mismatches such as warm temperatures on short days. We predict that mid to high latitudes in North America and Asia will be particularly affected by mismatches as a result of high seasonality and predicted warming over the next 50 years.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa051,8,NA,NA,coaa051,acclimation; climate change; metabolic scope; mitochondria; phenotypic plasticity

We used cardiac thermal performance curves (cTPCs) of six neritid gastropod species to study physiological thermal trait variation associated with a lineage transition from warmer rocky shores to cooler mangroves. We distinguished between functional thermal performance traits, related to energy homeostasis (slope gradient, slope curvature, HRmax, maximum cardiac activity and T-opt, the temperature that maximizes cardiac activity) and a trait that limits performance (ULT, the upper lethal temperature). Considering the theory of optimal thermal performance, we predicted that the functional traits should be under greater selective pressure to change directionally and in magnitude than the thermal limit, which is redundant in the cooler environment. We found little variation in all traits across species, habitats and ecosystems, despite a similar to 20 degrees C reduction in maximum habitat temperature in the mangrove species over 50 million years. While slope gradient was significantly lowered in the mangrove species, the effect difference was negated by greater thermal plasticity in the rocky shore species. ULT showed the least variation and suggested thermal specialization in the warmest habitat studied. The observed muted variation of the functional traits among the species may be explained by their limited role in energy acquisition and rather their association with heat tolerance adaptation, which is redundant in the mangrove species. These findings have implications for the conservation of habitat of intertidal gastropods that transition to cooler environments. Furthermore, they highlight the significance of evolutionary history and physiological conservation when predicting species responses to climate change.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad056,11,1,NA,coad056,ecophysiology; gastropod; heat tolerance; thermal performance curve
article,Intraspecific individual variation of temperature tolerance associated with oxygen demand in the European sea bass (<i>Dicentrarchus labrax</i>),"Ozolina, Karlina and Shiels, Holly A. and Ollivier, Helene and Claireaux, Guy",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"The European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) is an economically important fish native to the Mediterranean and Northern Atlantic. Its complex life cycle involves many migrations through temperature gradients that affect the energetic demands of swimming. Previous studies have shown large intraspecific variation in swimming performance and temperature tolerance, which could include deleterious and advantageous traits under the evolutionary pressure of climate change. However, little is known of the underlying determinants of this individual variation. We investigated individual variation in temperature tolerance in 30 sea bass by exposing them to a warm temperature challenge test. The eight most temperature-tolerant and eight most temperature-sensitive fish were then studied further to determine maximal swimming speed (U-CAT), aerobic scope and post-exercise oxygen consumption. Finally, ventricular contractility in each group was determined using isometric muscle preparations. The temperature-tolerant fish showed lower resting oxygen consumption rates, possessed larger hearts and initially recovered from exhaustive exercise faster than the temperature-sensitive fish. Thus, whole-animal temperature tolerance was associated with important performance traits. However, the temperature-tolerant fish also demonstrated poorer maximal swimming capacity (i.e. lower UCAT) than their temperature-sensitive counterparts, which may indicate a trade-off between temperature tolerance and swimming performance. Interestingly, the larger relative ventricular mass of the temperature-tolerant fish did not equate to greater ventricular contractility, suggesting that larger stroke volumes, rather than greater contractile strength, may be associated with thermal tolerance in this species.",2016,10.1093/conphys/cov060,4,NA,NA,cov060,Aerobic scope; climate change; fish; heart; individual variability; swimming
article,Sportive lemurs elevate theirmetabolic rate during challenging seasons and do not enter regular heterothermy,"Bethge, Janina and Razafimampiandra, Jean Claude and Wulff, Arne and Dausmann, Kathrin H.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Animals experience seasonal changes of environmental and ecological conditions in most habitats. Fluctuations in ambient temperature have a strong influence on thermoregulation, particularly on small endothermic mammals. However, different mammalian species cope differently with these changes. Understanding the physiological responses of organisms to different seasons and analysing the mechanisms that account for intra- and inter-specific differences and the ecological consequences of these variations is important to predict species responses to climatic changes. Consequences of climatic changes will be most pronounced in climatically already challenging habitats, such as the dry regions of western Madagascar. We aimed to identify the seasonal responses and adaptive possibilities in energy budgeting of Lepilemur edwardsi, a small primate of this habitat, by measuring metabolic rate (MR; open-flow respiratory) and skin temperature in the field during different seasons. Resting metabolism was generally low, but our study did not detect any signs of regular heterothermic episodes, despite the fact that these are known in other sympatrically living lemurs with a similar lifestyle. Surprisingly, L. edwardsi responded by elevating its resting MR in the poor-resourced dry season, compared to the better-resourced wet season, presumably to master detoxification of their increasingly toxic diet. As body mass decreased over this time, this strategy is obviously not energetically balanced on the long term. This is cause for concern, as it suggests that L. edwardsi has a very small leeway to adjust to changing conditions as experienced due to climate change, as dry season are expected to become longer and hotter, straining water budgets and food quality even more. Moreover, our findings highlight the importance of studying physiological parameters directly in the field and under differing climatic conditions.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab075,9,NA,NA,coab075,Dry forest; energy budgets; Lepilemur edwardsi; Madagascar; primates; seasonality; thermoregulation
article,Neotropical stingless bees display a strong response in cold tolerance with changes in elevation,"Gonzalez, Victor H. and Oyen, Kennan and Vitale, Nydia and Ospina, Rodulfo",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Tropical pollinators are expected to experience substantial effects due to climate change, but aspects of their thermal biology remain largely unknown. We investigated the thermal tolerance of stingless honey-making bees, the most ecologically, economically and culturally important group of tropical pollinators. We assessed changes in the lower (CTMin) and upper (CTMax) critical thermal limits of 17 species (12 genera) at two elevations (200 and 1500 m) in the Colombian Andes. In addition, we examined the influence of body size (intertegular distance, ITD), hairiness (thoracic hair length) and coloration (lightness value) on bees' thermal tolerance. Because stingless beekeepers often relocate their colonies across the altitudinal gradient, as an initial attempt to explore potential social responses to climatic variability, we also tracked for several weeks brood temperature and humidity in nests of three species at both elevations. We found that CTMin decreased with elevation while CTMax was similar between elevations. CTMin and CTMax increased (low cold tolerance and high heat tolerance) with increasing ITD, hair length and lightness value, but these relationships were weak and explained at most 10\% of the variance. Neither CTMin nor CTMax displayed significant phylogenetic signal. Brood nest temperature tracked ambient diel variations more closely in the low-elevation site, but it was constant and higher at the high-elevation site. In contrast, brood nest humidity was uniform throughout the day regardless of elevation. The stronger response in CTMin, and a similar CTMax between elevations, follows a pattern of variation documented across a wide range of taxa that is commonly known as the Brett's heat-invariant hypothesis. Our results indicate differential thermal sensitivities and potential thermal adaptations to local climate, which support ongoing conservation policies to restrict the long-distance relocations of colonies. They also shed light on how malleable nest thermoregulation can be across elevations.",2022,10.1093/conphys/coac073,10,1,NA,coac073,Colombia; meliponiculture; physiological thresholds; sustainability
article,Extreme tolerance for nocturnal emergence at low body temperatures in a high-latitude lizard: implications for future climate warming,"Chukwuka, Christian O. and Monks, Joanne M. and Cree, Alison",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"High-latitude lizards are capable of activity at low winter temperatures and are active on warm nights (including in winter) with prior warmer temperatures during the day, with active field body temperature as low as 1.4\#x00B0;C and air temperature less than 1\#x00B0;C. High-latitude lizards live in environments where ambient air temperature at night is frequently below retreat temperatures, which likely has implications for nocturnal emergence and activity. However, patterns of lizard activity at night under current temperate climates are poorly understood, a situation that limits our understanding of potential effects of climate change. We investigated patterns of nocturnal emergence and activity in the cold-adapted, viviparous gecko (Woodworthia `Otago/Southland'). We measured operative environmental temperature (T-e) available to geckos that emerged at night and simultaneously assessed nighttime emergence activity using time-lapse trail cameras. Also, we assessed field body temperature (T-b) of emerged geckos of various life history groups at night using thermography to understand how current weather conditions affect field T-b of emerged geckos. Our results show that T-e, nocturnal emergence activity and field-active T-b increased with nighttime air temperature. Nocturnal emergence was highest in spring and summer but also occurred in autumn and (unexpectedly) in winter. Geckos were active over a broad range of T-b down to 1.4 degrees C (a new record low for lizards) and on rock surfaces typically warmer than air temperature or T-b. We conclude that this nocturnal, high-latitude lizard from the temperate zone is capable of activity at low winter temperatures, but that current climate limits emergence and activity at least in autumn and winter. Activity levels for cool-temperate reptiles will probably increase initially as climates warm, but the consequences of increased nocturnal activity under climate change will probably depend on how climate change affects predator populations as well as the focal species' biology.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coac082,11,1,NA,coac082,Active body temperature; cold adaptation; nocturnal emergence; nocturnality; operative temperature; thermography; trail camera; winter activity
article,Using the shuttlebox experimental design to determine temperature preference for juvenile Westslope Cutthroat Trout (<i>Oncorhynchus</i> <i>clarkii</i> <i>lewisi</i>),"Macnaughton, Camille J. and Kovachik, Colin and Charies, Colin and Enders, Eva C.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Temperature preference for various fishes has often been used as a proxy of optimal temperature for growth and metabolism due to the ease of obtaining preferred temperature zones in laboratory experiments. Several laboratory designs and methods have been proposed to examine preferred temperature zones, however, differences between them (i.e. thermal gradients vs. static temperatures in chambers and duration of acclimation/experimental periods) have led to varying measurements, precluding comparisons between experiments, species and/or life-stages. Juvenile Westslope Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi), a species listed as threatened in Alberta and of special concern in British Columbia, were tested in an automated shuttlebox experimental design (Loligo (R) Systems) to determine average and ranges of temperature preference (T-pref) and occupied temperatures. Previous lab studies suggested that Westslope Cutthroat Trout (WCT) prefer temperatures around 15 degrees C, however, we found that average daytime Tpref for lab-reared juvenile WCT was substantially higher at 18.6 degrees C, with occupied temperatures ranging between 11.9 degrees C and 26.0 degrees C throughout the duration of trials. This seems to indicate that despite constant lab-rearing conditions of 12 degrees C, juvenile WCT may tolerate and even prefer warmer water temperatures. The duration of the acclimation period (1h, 12 h and 24 h) did not have an effect on T-pref, however, T-pref differed significantly for variable trial durations (12 h, 24 h and 36 h). A closer look at thermal trends throughout trials revealed that photoperiod significantly influenced T-pref, as nighttime temperature preference reached consistently 26 degrees C. Collectively, these results suggest that shuttlebox experiments on WCT need to take into account the photoperiod, as behaviour may drive T-pref more so than the duration of acclimation periods.",2018,10.1093/conphys/coy018,6,NA,NA,coy018,photoperiod; shuttlebox; thermal preference; Westslope Cutthroat Trout

In this study, we evaluate the effects of future environmental warming (+ 2 degrees C) during the early ontogeny of the European sardine, Sardina pilchardus. Warming reduced the survival of 30-day-old larvae by half. Length at hatching increased with temperature as expected, but no significant effect was observed on the length and growth at 30 days post-hatching. Warming did not significantly affect the thermal tolerance of sardine larvae, even though the mean lethal temperature increased by 1 degrees C. In the warm conditions, sardine larvae showed signs of thermal stress, indicated by a pronounced increase in larval metabolism (Q(10) = 7.9) and a 45\% increase in the heat shock response. Lipid peroxidation was not significantly affected by the higher temperature, even though the mean value doubled. Warming did not affect the time larvae spent swimming, but decreased by 36\% the frequency of prey attacks.

In this study, we evaluated how thermal performance varied in coastal cutthroat trout across four hydrologically distinct watersheds. Coastal cutthroat trout displayed considerable variability in physiological performance to varying temperature treatments. Understanding species physiological responses to current thermal regimes allows for a more nuanced approach to the management and conservation of native fish species into the future. Fish physiological performance is directly regulated by their thermal environment. Intraspecific comparisons are essential to ascertain the vulnerability of fish populations to climate change and to identify which populations may be more susceptible to extirpation and which may be more resilient to continued warming. In this study, we sought to evaluate how thermal performance varies in coastal cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki clarki) across four distinct watersheds in OR, USA. Specifically, we measured oxygen consumption rates in trout from the four watersheds with variable hydrologic and thermal regimes, comparing three ecologically relevant temperature treatments (ambient, annual maximum and novel warm). Coastal cutthroat trout displayed considerable intraspecific variability in physiological performance and thermal tolerance across the four watersheds. Thermal tolerance matched the historical experience: the coastal watersheds experiencing warmer ambient temperatures had higher critical thermal tolerance compared with the interior, cooler Willamette watersheds. Physiological performance varied across all four watersheds and there was evidence of a trade-off between high aerobic performance and broad thermal tolerance. Given the evidence of climate regime shifts across the globe, the uncertainty in both the rate and extent of warming and species responses in the near and long term, a more nuanced approach to the management and conservation of native fish species must be considered.",2022,10.1093/conphys/coac029,10,1,NA,coac029,thermal tolerance; physiology; metabolism; intraspecific; cutthroat trout; Climate change
article,The effects of elevated temperature and ocean acidification on the metabolic pathways of notothenioid fish,"Enzor, Laura A. and Hunter, Evan M. and Place, Sean P.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"The adaptations used by notothenioid fish to combat extreme cold may have left these fish poorly poised to deal with a changing environment. As such, the expected environmental perturbations brought on by global climate change have the potential to significantly affect the energetic demands and subsequent cellular processes necessary for survival. Despite recent lines of evidence demonstrating that notothenioid fish retain the ability to acclimate to elevated temperatures, the underlying mechanisms responsible for temperature acclimation in these fish remain largely unknown. Furthermore, little information exists on the capacity of Antarctic fish to respond to changes in multiple environmental variables. We have examined the effects of increased temperature and pCO(2) on the rate of oxygen consumption in three notothenioid species, Trematomus bernacchii, Pagothenia borchgrevinki, and Trematomus newnesi. We combined these measurements with analysis of changes in aerobic and anaerobic capacity, lipid reserves, fish condition, and growth rates to gain insight into the metabolic cost associated with acclimation to this dual stress. Our findings indicated that temperature is the major driver of the metabolic responses observed in these fish and that increased pCO(2) plays a small, contributing role to the energetic costs of the acclimation response. All three species displayed varying levels of energetic compensation in response to the combination of elevated temperature and pCO(2). While P. borchgrevinki showed nearly complete compensation of whole animal oxygen consumption rates and aerobic capacity, T. newnesi and T. bernacchii displayed only partial compensation in these metrics, suggesting that at least some notothenioids may require physiological trade-offs to fully offset the energetic costs of long-term acclimation to climate change related stressors.",2017,10.1093/conphys/cox019,5,NA,NA,cox019,Energetics; global climate change; metabolism; notothenioid; ocean acidification; thermal stress

In the Sonoran Desert, Erodium cicutarium has increased in abundance over the last 30 years. While native species in this flora exhibit a strong among-species trade-off between relative growth rate and water-use efficiency, E. cicutarium seems to have a higher relative growth rate for its water-use efficiency value relative to the pattern across native species. This novel trait combination could provide the non-native species with a competitive advantage in this water-limited environment. To test the hypothesis that E. cicutarium is able to achieve high growth rates due to release from native herbivores, we compared the effects of herbivory on E. cicutarium and its native congener, Erodium texanum. We also compared these two species across a range of environmental conditions, both in a common garden and in two distinct seasons in the field, using growth analysis, isotopic compositions and leaf-level gas exchange. Additionally, we compared the competitive abilities of the two Erodium species in a greenhouse experiment. We found no evidence of herbivory to either species. Physiological measurements in a common environment revealed that E. cicutarium was able to achieve high growth rates while simultaneously controlling leaf-level water loss. Non-native E. cicutarium responded to favourable conditions in the field with greater specific leaf area and leaf area ratio than native E. texanum. The non-native Erodium was a stronger competitor than its native congener in a green-house competition experiment.

This study investigated the physiological consequences of long-term, naturalistic temperature variation on juvenile hellbenders under simulated current and warmer (+1.6 C) climates vs. controlled steady temperatures. Mean temperature and temperature variability were both important predictors of growth as indicated by monthly body mass change (\%), stress as indicated by neutrophil:lymphocyte (N:L) ratio and bacteria-killing ability of blood. Cold exposure in hellbenders was associated with weight loss, increased N:L ratios and reduced Escherichia coli killing ability of blood, and these effects were less pronounced under a warmer climate scenario. These observations suggest that cold periods may be more stressful for hellbenders than previously understood. Growth rates peaked in late spring and late fall around 14-17 degrees C. Hellbenders experiencing warmer simulated climates retained body condition better in winter, but this was counter-balanced by a prolonged lack of growth in the 3-month summer period leading up to the fall breeding season where warmer simulated conditions resulted in an average loss of -0.6\% body mass/month, compared to a gain +1.5\% body mass/month under current climate scenario.

Conservation physiology and its mechanistic underpinnings are well positioned to generate robust data to inform the extent to which the Anthropause has benefited biodiversity through alterations in disturbance-, pollution- and climate change-related emissions. The conservation physiology toolbox includes sensitive biomarkers and tools that can be used both retroactively (e.g. to reconstruct stress in wildlife before, during and after lockdown measures) and proactively (e.g. future viral waves) to understand the physiological consequences of the pandemic. The pandemic has also created new risks to ecosystems and biodiversity through extensive use of various antimicrobial products (e.g. hand cleansers, sprays) and plastic medical waste. Conservation physiology can be used to identify regulatory thresholds for those products.

Common Nighthawk (Chordeiles minor) nesting habitat includes grasslands, open woodlands and urban rooftops, but nesting sites in southeastern South Dakota are confined to rooftops, as natural nesting habitat is limited. Nighthawks nesting on exposed rooftop habitats may encounter thermal conditions that increase operative temperatures relative to vegetated land cover types. Mean humidity has increased and mean wind speed and cloud cover have decreased during the nighthawk breeding season from 1948 to 2016 in southeastern South Dakota. These changes might contribute to increasing operative temperatures at exposed rooftop nest sites and this could influence chick condition. We studied nest micro-climate and the plasma stress response for 24 rooftop-nesting nighthawk chicks from 17 nests during 2015 and 2016. High humidity prior to blood collection reduced both baseline and stress-induced plasma corticosterone (CORT). In contrast, high maximum temperatures during the day before sampling increased stress-induced CORT. The magnitude of the chick stress response was significantly negatively related to maximum wind speed for the week prior to CORT measurement. Other weather and micro-climate variables were not significant effectors of CORT metrics. Most chicks had low baseline CORT and were able to mount a stress response, but a subset of chicks (n = 4) showed elevated baseline CORT and a negative association between the magnitude of stress response and ambient temperature. For this subset, mean ambient temperature for the day before sampling was significantly higher (2.3 degrees C) than for chicks with typical baseline CORT levels.

We combined biologging and blood chemistry to explore how this fisheries interaction influenced the physiology of two widely distributed, highly migratory shark species: the blue shark (Prionace glauca) and the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier). Nineteen sharks were caught by drum line or rod-and-reel angling; subcutaneous body temperature measurements were taken immediately upon capture, with six individuals also providing subsequent subcutaneous body temperature measurements via biologging as they swam freely for several hours post-release. We found that short-term capture caused shark body temperature to increase significantly and rapidly, with increases of 0.6 degrees C-2.7 degrees C for blue sharks (mean, 1.2 +/- 0.6 degrees C) and 0.5 degrees C-0.9 degrees C for tiger sharks (mean, 0.7 +/- 0.2 degrees C) and with capture-induced heating rates of blue sharks averaging 0.3 degrees C min(-1) but as high as 0.8 degrees C min(-1). Blue shark body temperature was even higher deeper into the white muscle. These heating rates were three to eight times faster than maximum rates encountered by our biologging sharks swimming through thermally stratified waters and faster than most acute heating experiments conducted with ectotherms in laboratory experiments. Biologging data showed that body temperatures underwent gradual decline after release, returning to match water temperatures 10-40 mins post-release. Blood biochemistry showed variable lactate/glucose levels following capture; however, these concentrations were not correlated with the magnitude of body temperature increase, nor with body size or hooking time.

Little is known about environmental influences on cardiorespiratory patterns, hence energy use, throughout the 6 week fast. Continuous heart rates were recorded for free-ranging, newly weaned southern elephant seals using heart rate time-depth recorders for 5-9 days at Sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island, during October 1994 (n = 1), 1995 (n = 4) and 1996 (n = 1). Daytime observations of respiration and behaviour were made throughout. We present the first instance of synchronous heart rate traces recorded simultaneously for individual weaners. Generalized additive models revealed that a sinusoidal pattern of diurnal heart rate elevation and nocturnal depression was evident in all seals and, on at least one occasion, a conspicuous break in this pattern coincided with an extreme cold weather event. Seals in this study were capable of considerable cardiorespiratory control and regularly demonstrated bradycardia during periods of resting apnoea. Apnoeic duration ranged from 33 to 291 s (mean 134 s). Apnoeic heart rates (mean 67 +/- 15 beats min(-1), range 40-114 beats min(-1)) were on average 19.7\% lower than those exhibited during periods of eupnoea (mean 83 +/- 15 beats min(-1), range 44-124 beats min(-1)). The early development of the cardiorespiratory response is characterized by arrhythmic heart and respiration rates. The strong temporal patterns observed are being driven by the opposing requirements of maximizing time spent fasting in order to develop diving capabilities and of maximizing departure mass. This pilot study has highlighted a potentially large effect of ambient weather conditions on newly weaned southern elephant seal cardiorespiratory activity.

The Fraser River estuary, British Columbia, Canada, is a critical spring stopover site for hundreds of thousands of migrating western sandpiper, Calidris mauri, and dunlin, Calidris alpina. Intertidal biofilm in spring is an important nutritional source for western sandpiper, with previous isotopic research predicting 45-59\% of total diet and 50\% of total energy needs. However, these studies relied on isotopic mixing models that did not consider metabolic routing of key dietary macromolecules. Complexity arises due to the mixed macromolecular composition of biofilm that is difficult to characterize isotopically. We expanded on these earlier findings by considering a protein pathway from diet to the body protein pool represented by liver tissue, using a Bayesian mixing model based on delta C-13 and delta N-15. We used delta C-1(3) measurements of adipose tissue and breath CO2 to provide an estimate of the carbohydrate and protein delta C-1(3) values of microphytobenthos and used these derived values to better inform the isotopic mixing models. Our results reinforce earlier estimates of the importance of biofilm to staging shorebirds in predicting that assimilated nutrients from biofilm contribute similar to 35\% of the protein budgets for staging western sandpipers (n = 13) and dunlin (n = 11) and at least 41\% of the energy budget of western sandpiper (n = 69). Dunlin's ingestion of biofilm appeared higher than anticipated given their expected reliance on invertebrate prey compared to western sandpiper, a biofilm specialist. Isotopic analyses of bulk tissues that consider metabolic routing and that make use of breath CO 2 and adipose lipid assays can provide new insights into avian physiology.

article,Diving deep into trouble: the role of foraging strategy and morphology in adapting to a changing environment,"Ladds, Monique and Rosen, David and Gerlinsky, Carling and Slip, David and Harcourt, Robert",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Rapid environmental change may require fur seals and sea lions to make longer or deeper dives to find resources. A systematic review of diving behaviour and physiology revealed that a foraging strategy (epipelagic vs mesopelagic or benthic) was more important in predicting dive behaviour than morphology (fur seal vs sea lion). Physiology places constraints on an animal's ability to forage and those unable to adapt to changing conditions may face increased challenges to reproduce and survive. As the global marine environment continues to change, small, air-breathing, endothermic marine predators such as otariids (fur seals and sea lions) and particularly females, who are constrained by central place foraging during breeding, may experience increased difficulties in successfully obtaining adequate food resources. We explored whether physiological limits of female otariids may be innately related to body morphology (fur seals vs sea lions) and/or dictate foraging strategies (epipelagic vs mesopelagic or benthic). We conducted a systematic review of the increased body of literature since the original reviews of Costa et al. (When does physiology limit the foraging behaviour of freely diving mammals?

We estimated calculated aerobic dive limit (cADL-estimated duration of aerobic dives) for species and used simulations to predict the proportion of dives that exceeded the cADL. We tested whether body morphology or foraging strategy was the primary predictor of these behavioural and physiological characteristics. We found that the foraging strategy compared to morphology was a better predictor of most parameters, including whether a species was more likely to exceed their cADL during a dive and the ratio of dive time to cADL. This suggests that benthic and mesopelagic divers are more likely to be foraging at their physiological capacity. For species operating near their physiological capacity (regularly exceeding their cADL), the ability to switch strategies is limited as the cost of foraging deeper and longer is disproportionally high, unless it is accompanied by physiological adaptations. It is proposed that some otariids may not have the ability to switch foraging strategies and so be unable adapt to a changing oceanic ecosystem.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa111,8,1,NA,coaa111,Otariid; aerobic dive limit; prey availability; meta-analysis; diving
article,Swimming performance in juvenile shortnose sturgeon (<i>Acipenser brevirostrum</i>): the influence of time interval and velocity increments on critical swimming tests,"Downie, Adam T. and Kieffer, James D.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"The most utilized method to measure swimming performance of fishes has been the critical swimming speed (UCrit) test. In this test, the fish is forced to swim against an incrementally increasing flow of water until fatigue. Before the water velocity is increased, the fish swims at the water velocity for a specific, pre-arranged time interval. The magnitude of the velocity increments and the time interval for each swimming period can vary across studies making the comparison between and within species difficult. This issue has been acknowledged in the literature, however, little empirical evidence exists that tests the importance of velocity and time increments on swimming performance in fish. A practical application for fish performance is through the design of fishways that enable fish to bypass anthropogenic structures (e. g. dams) that block migration routes, which is one of the causes of world-wide decline in sturgeon populations. While fishways will improve sturgeon conservation, they need to be specifically designed to accommodate the swimming capabilities specific for sturgeons, and it is possible that current swimming methodologies have under-estimated the swimming performance of sturgeons. The present study assessed the UCrit of shortnose sturgeon using modified UCrit to determine the importance of velocity increment (5 and 10 cm s(-1)) and time (5, 15 and 30 min) intervals on swimming performance. UCrit was found to be influenced by both time interval and water velocity. UCrit was generally lower in sturgeon when they were swum using 5cm s(-1) compared with 10 cm s(-1) increments. Velocity increment influences the UCrit more than time interval. Overall, researchers must consider the impacts of using particular swimming criteria when designing their experiments.",2017,10.1093/conphys/cox038,5,NA,NA,cox038,Acipenser brevirostrum; Critical swim speed test; exercise physiology; shortnose sturgeon; swimming methodology; UCrit

However, many studies still struggle to explicitly link individual physiological measures to impacts across the biological hierarchy (to population and ecosystem levels) and instead rely on a `black box' of assumptions to scale up results for conservation implications. Here, we highlight some examples of studies that were successful in scaling beyond the individual level, including two case studies of well-researched species, and using other studies we highlight challenges and future opportunities to increase the impact of research by scaling up the biological hierarchy. We first examine studies that use individual physiological measures to scale up to population-level impacts and discuss several emerging fields that have made significant steps toward addressing the gap between individual-based and demographic studies, such as macrophysiology and landscape physiology. Next, we examine how future studies can scale from population or species-level to community- and ecosystem-level impacts and discuss avenues of research that can lead to conservation implications at the ecosystem level, such as abiotic gradients and interspecific interactions. In the process, we review methods that researchers can use to make links across the biological hierarchy, including crossing disciplinary boundaries, collaboration and data sharing, spatial modelling and incorporating multiple markers (e.g. physiological, behavioural or demographic) into their research. We recommend future studies incorporating tools that consider the diversity of `landscapes' experienced by animals at higher levels of the biological hierarchy, will make more effective contributions to conservation and management decisions.",2020,10.1093/conphys/coaa019,8,1,NA,coaa019,Biological Hierarchy; conservation; physiology; scaling up

Exercise intensity during longline capture and physiological status may be associated, which could inform management strategies aimed at reducing the impacts of longline capture on sharks. The purpose of this study was to characterize relationships between exercise intensity and physiological status of longline-captured nurse sharks (Ginglymostoma cirratum) and Caribbean reef sharks (Carcharhinus perezi). Exercise intensity of longline-captured sharks was quantified with digital cameras and accelerometers, which was paired with blood-based physiological metrics from samples obtained immediately post-capture. Exercise intensity was associated with physiological status following longline capture. For nurse sharks, blood pH increased with capture duration and the proportion of time exhibiting low-intensity exercise. Nurse sharks also had higher blood glucose and plasma potassium concentrations at higher sea surface temperatures. Associations between exercise intensity and physiological status for Caribbean reef sharks were equivocal; capture duration had a positive relation with blood lactate concentrations and a negative relationship with plasma chloride concentrations. Because Caribbean reef sharks did not appear able to influence blood pH through exercise intensity, this species was considered more vulnerable to physiological impairment. While both species appear quite resilient to longline capture, it remains to be determined if exercise intensity during capture is a useful tool for predicting mortality or tertiary sub-lethal consequences. Fisheries management should consider exercise during capture for sharks when developing techniques to avoid by-catch or reduce physiological stress associated with capture.",2018,10.1093/conphys/coy074,6,NA,NA,coy074,by-catch; elasmobranch; experimental fishing gear; fisheries; physiological stress; sub-lethal effect
article,Elevated corticosterone levels decrease reproductive output of chick-rearing Adelie penguins but do not affect chick mass at fledging,"Thierry, Anne-Mathilde and Ropert-Coudert, Yan and Raclot, Thierry",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Study of physiological mechanisms can help us to understand how animals respond to changing environmental conditions. In particular, stress hormones (i.e. glucocorticoids, such as corticosterone) are described as mediating resource allocation, allowing animals to adjust their physiology and behaviour to predictable and unpredictable changes in the environment. In this study, we investigated the effects of an experimental increase in baseline corticosterone levels on the breeding effort and the reproductive output of chick-rearing male Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae). The number of chicks per nest, their body mass, and their size were monitored throughout the study. Direct observations allowed measurement of the time spent foraging at sea and caring for the young on the nest. At the end of the treatment, blood samples were collected for isotope analysis. Although all birds raised at least one chick, reproductive output was decreased by 42\% in corticosterone-treated birds compared with control birds. The increase in corticosterone levels during the guard stage did not affect the mass of surviving chicks or the brood mass at fledging. Corticosterone-treated males spent on average 21\% more time at the nest than control birds. However, the duration of foraging trips was similar between both groups. In addition, the similarity of isotopic signatures suggests that both groups foraged at similar locations and ingested the same prey species. The detailed on-land behaviour of birds should be examined in further studies to clarify the possible links between corticosterone levels, brooding time, and reproductive output. Understanding the relationships between glucocorticoids, fitness, and ultimately population dynamics is fundamental to enabling conservation physiology as a discipline to be successful in helping to manage species of conservation concern.",2013,10.1093/conphys/cot007,1,1,NA,cot007,Breeding effort; glucocorticoids; Pygoscelis adeliae; reproductive output; seabird
article,Temperature and land use influence tree swallow individual health,"Corra, Joseph and Sullivan, S. Mazeika P.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Aerial insectivorous bird populations have declined precipitously in both North America and Europe. We assessed the effects of insect prey availability, climate and shifts in water quality associated with urbanization on haematocrit, haemoglobin concentration and heterophil-lymphocyte (H/L) ratios among similar to 13-day-old tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) nestlings in the Columbus, Ohio area. Higher mean temperature and increased frequency of extreme heat days during the early breeding period (May-June) were linked to reduced nestling physiological condition as evidenced by lower concentrations of haemoglobin and haematocrit, potentially due to increased heat stress, shifts in insect prey availability or altered parental provisioning efforts. Urbanization and the size and density of emergent aquatic insects were associated with elevated physiological stress, whereas higher mean temperatures and terrestrial insect size were related to lower stress as measured by H/L ratios. Overall, these findings highlight the complex environmental conditions driving nestling health, which may be indicative of post-fledging survival and, consequently, population growth. Our results underscore the need for conservation approaches that adequately address the interrelated effects of changes in climate, land use and food resources on aerial insectivorous birds.",2021,10.1093/conphys/coab084,9,NA,NA,coab084,NA
article,What is conservation physiology? Perspectives on an increasingly integrated and essential science,"Cooke, Steven J. and Sack, Lawren and Franklin, Craig E. and Farrell, Anthony P. and Beardall, John and Wikelski, Martin and Chown, Steven L.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Globally, ecosystems and their constituent flora and fauna face the localized and broad-scale influence of human activities. Conservation practitioners and environmental managers struggle to identify and mitigate threats, reverse species declines, restore degraded ecosystems, and manage natural resources sustainably. Scientific research and evidence are increasingly regarded as the foundation for new regulations, conservation actions, and management interventions. Conservation biologists and managers have traditionally focused on the characteristics (e.g. abundance, structure, trends) of populations, species, communities, and ecosystems, and simple indicators of the responses to environmental perturbations and other human activities. However, an understanding of the specific mechanisms underlying conservation problems is becoming increasingly important for decision-making, in part because physiological tools and knowledge are especially useful for developing cause-and-effect relationships, and for identifying the optimal range of habitats and stressor thresholds for different organisms. When physiological knowledge is incorporated into ecological models, it can improve predictions of organism responses to environmental change and provide tools to support management decisions. Without such knowledge, we may be left with simple associations. `Conservation physiology' has been defined previously with a focus on vertebrates, but here we redefine the concept universally, for application to the diversity of taxa from microbes to plants, to animals, and to natural resources. We also consider `physiology' in the broadest possible terms; i.e. how an organism functions, and any associated mechanisms, from development to bioenergetics, to environmental interactions, through to fitness. Moreover, we consider conservation physiology to include a wide range of applications beyond assisting imperiled populations, and include, for example, the eradication of invasive species, refinement of resource management strategies to minimize impacts, and evaluation of restoration plans. This concept of conservation physiology emphasizes the basis, importance, and ecological relevance of physiological diversity at a variety of scales. Real advances in conservation and resource management require integration and inter-disciplinarity. Conservation physiology and its suite of tools and concepts is a key part of the evidence base needed to address pressing environmental challenges.",2013,10.1093/conphys/cot001,1,1,NA,cot001,Conservation physiology; conservation science; environment; mechanisms; resource management

The in situ nature of this metabolic metric has transdisciplinary relevance and can provide links to higher levels of biological organisation, informing modelling efforts aimed at mitigating climatic and anthropogenic threats. Fluctuating ocean conditions are rearranging whole networks of marine communities-from individual-level physiological thresholds to ecosystem function. Physiological studies support predictions from individual-level responses (biochemical, cellular, tissue, respiratory potential) based on laboratory experiments. The otolith-isotope method of recovering field metabolic rate has recently filled a gap for the bony fishes, linking otolith stable isotope composition to in situ oxygen consumption and experienced temperature estimates. Here, we review the otolith-isotope method focusing on the biochemical and physiological processes that yield estimates of field metabolic rate. We identify a multidisciplinary pathway in the application of this method, providing concrete research goals (field, modeling) aimed at linking individual-level physiological data to higher levels of biological organization. We hope that this review will provide researchers with a transdisciplinary `roadmap', guiding the use of the otolith-isotope method to bridge the gap between individual-level physiology, observational field studies, and modeling efforts, while ensuring that in situ data is central in marine policy-making aimed at mitigating climatic and anthropogenic threats.",2024,10.1093/conphys/coae013,12,1,NA,coae013,ecophysiology; fisheries; in situ; isotope; metabolism; otolith
article,"Oxidative stress, activity behaviour and body mass in captive parrots","Larcombe, S. D. and Tregaskes, C. A. and Coffey, J. and Stevenson, A. E. and Alexander, L. G. and Arnold, K. E.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Many parrot species are kept in captivity for conservation, but often show poor reproduction, health and survival. These traits are known to be influenced by oxidative stress, the imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ability of antioxidant defences to ameliorate ROS damage. In humans, oxidative stress is linked with obesity, lack of exercise and poor nutrition, all of which are common in captive animals. Here, we tested whether small parrots (budgerigars, Melopsittacus undulatus) maintained in typical pet cages and on ad libitum food varied in oxidative profile, behaviour and body mass. Importantly, as with many birds held in captivity, they did not have enough space to engage in extensive free flight. Four types of oxidative damage, single-stranded DNA breaks (low-pH comet assay), alkali-labile sites in DNA (high-pH comet assay), sensitivity of DNA to ROS (H2O2-treated comet assay) and malondialdehyde (a byproduct of lipid peroxidation), were uncorrelated with each other and with plasma concentrations of dietary antioxidants. Without strenuous exercise over 28 days in a relatively small cage, more naturally `active' individuals had more single-stranded DNA breaks than sedentary birds. High body mass at the start or end of the experiment, coupled with substantial mass gain, were all associated with raised sensitivity of DNA to ROS. Thus, high body mass in these captive birds was associated with oxidative damage. These birds were not lacking dietary antioxidants, because final body mass was positively related to plasma levels of retinol, zeaxanthin and alpha-tocopherol. Individuals varied widely in activity levels, feeding behaviour, mass gain and oxidative profile despite standardized living conditions. DNA damage is often associated with poor immunocompetence, low fertility and faster ageing. Thus, we have candidate mechanisms for the limited lifespan and fecundity common to many birds kept for conservation purposes.",2015,10.1093/conphys/cov045,3,NA,NA,cov045,Antioxidants; birds; budgerigars; carotenoids; comet assay; malondialdehyde

L. and Cooke, Steven J.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Sport fishing for sharks, including fishing with the intent to release, is becoming more prevalent within the recreational angling community. Common targets of recreational anglers are juvenile lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris) that frequent shallow tropical nearshore habitats. In this study, we captured 32 juvenile lemon sharks (530-875 mm total length) with conventional angling gear (i. e. spinning rods, dead fish bait and 5/0 barbed circle hooks) from the coastal waters of Eleuthera, The Bahamas, to determine the consequences of capture for individual sharks. Each shark was examined for hooking injuries, blood sampled to quantify physiological disturbance, assessed for reflex impairment and then monitored to assess postrelease behaviour and mortality. Four sharks (12.5\%) died following release during the 15 min tracking period. Principal components (PC) analysis revealed four axes describing 66.5\% of the variance for blood physiology parameters, total length and water temperature. The PC1 and PC3 scores, characterized by positive factor loadings for indicators of exercise-induced stress and blood ion concentrations, respectively, were significantly related to fight time but were not associated with short-term mortality. Short-term mortality was significantly related to factor scores for PC4 that loaded heavily for water temperature and total length. Ten sharks (31\%) exhibited impaired reflexes, with loss of bite reflex being most prevalent. Sharks that died had the following characteristics: (i) they had two or more impaired reflexes; (ii) they were hooked in the basihyal; (iii) they exhibited no movement after the initial bout of directional swimming; and (iv) they experienced high water temperatures (i.e. >31 degrees C). Collectively, these results indicate that for juvenile lemon sharks inhabiting tropical flats, fight time can influence the degree of physiological disturbance, while water temperature contributes to the likelihood of survival following release.",2014,10.1093/conphys/cot036,2,1,NA,cot036,Catch and release; hooking injury; juvenile lemon shark; mortality; physiological stress; recreational angling

N. and Green, D. J. and Pavlik, M. and Cooper, J. and Williams, T. D.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Riparian habitat makes up a small fraction of the landscape but provides important stopover habitat for migratory birds. Hydroelectric dam operations cause fluctuations in water levels that can change the amount or quality of riparian habitat, which in turn might affect potential fattening rates of migrant birds. Here we used plasma metabolite analysis to estimate variation in fattening rate in relationship to variable water levels associated with reservoir management in four species of neotropical migratory songbirds using riparian habitat at a dam-impacted stopover site in Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada. Residual plasma triglyceride, our measure of estimated fattening rate, varied systematically with time of day and Julian date and varied consistently among species, but did not vary with age or sex. Controlling for potentially confounding variables, we found no inter-annual variation in estimated fattening rate, even though there were marked differences in water levels among years. Likewise, there was no relationship between daily variation in water levels and estimated fattening rate. Data on feather isotopes (delta D), indicative of migratory origin, did not add explanatory power to our models. There was inter-annual variation in plasma glycerol and beta-hydroxybutyrate levels and significant, though weak, relationships between these metabolites and water level (higher metabolite levels when drier) that might indicate effects on `body condition' independent of fattening rate. Our study suggests that, at present, although hydroelectric dam operations influence water levels in the Arrows Lake Reservoir and adjacent riparian habitats, this does not significantly impact fattening rates of migratory passerines using these habitats.",2014,10.1093/conphys/cou017,2,1,NA,cou017,Fattening rate; migratory birds; reservoir operations; riparian habitat

M.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"During the evolution of most marine mammals, fur as an insulator has been replaced with more buoyant, energy storing and streamlining blubber. By contrast, the sea otter (Enhydra lutris) relies on insulation from its dense, air-trapping pelage, which differs morphologically between natal and adult stages. In this study, we investigated the ontogenetic changes in thermal function of southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis) pelts in air, in water, and when saturated with crude oil. Pelt thermal conductivity, thickness, and thermal resistance were measured for six age classes: neonate (<1 month), small pup (1-2 months), large pup (3-5 months), juvenile (6 months-1 year), subadult (1-3 years), and adult (4-9 years). Thermal conductivity was significantly higher for pelts in air than in water, with oiled pelts exhibiting the highest values (P < 0.001). Oiled pelts had the lowest thermal resistance, which suggests that regardless of age, all sea otters are vulnerable to the effects of oiling (P < 0.001). To scale up our laboratory findings, we used a volume-specific geometric model of conductive heat transfer for a simplified sea otter body, representing all tested age classes and treatments. Neonates, small pups, and large pups are more vulnerable to the effects of oiling compared with older age classes (P < 0.0001) due to a higher surface area-to-volume ratio. These results are consistent with the known thermal conductance values for adult sea otter pelts, yet this is the first time such thermal differences have been demonstrated in young otters. Overall, body size and age play a more important role in the thermal abilities of sea otters than previously thought.",2023,10.1093/conphys/coad095,11,1,NA,coad095,Development; insulation; lanugo; pelage; thermal conductivity; thermal resistance
