article,Molecular markers for thermo-tolerance are associated with reproductive and physiological traits in Pelibuey ewes raised in a semiarid environment,"Castillo-Salas, Candelario A. and Luna-Nevarez, Guillermo and Reyna-Granados, Javier R. and Luna-Ramirez, Rosa I. and Limesand, Sean W. and Luna-Nevarez, Pablo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Pelibuey sheep exhibit reproductive activity through the year, but warm weather lowers their fertility and demonstrates physiological limitations of environmental heat stress. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with heat stress tolerance in sheep have been reported previously. The objective was to validate the association of seven thermo-tolerance SNP markers with reproductive and physiological traits in Pelibuey ewes raised in a semiarid region. Pelibuey ewes were assigned to a cool (January 1st.- March 31st.; n = 101) or warm (April 1st.- August 31st.; n = 104) experimental group. All ewes were exposed to fertile rams and assessed for pregnancy diagnosis 90 days later; lambing day was reported at birth. These data served to calculate the reproductive traits of services per conception, prolificacy, days to estrus, days to conception, conception rate and lambing rate. Rectal temperature, rump/leg skin temperature and respiratory rate were measured and reported as physiological traits. Blood samples were collected and processed to extract DNA, which was genotyped using the TaqMan allelic discrimination method and qPCR. A mixed effects statistical model was used to validate associations between SNP genotypes and phenotypic traits. The SNPs rs421873172, rs417581105 and rs407804467 were confirmed as markers associated with reproductive and physiological traits (P < 0.05), and these SNPs were in the genes PAM, STAT1 and FBXO11, respectively. Interestingly, these SNP markers resulted as predictors for the evaluated traits but only in ewes from the warm group, which indicated their association with heat-stress tolerance. An additive SNP effect was confirmed with the highest contribution (P < 0.01) of the SNP rs417581105 for the evaluated traits. Reproductive performance improved (P < 0.05) and physiological parameters decreased in ewes carrying favorable SNP genotypes. In conclusion, three thermo-tolerance SNP markers were associated with improved reproductive and physiological traits in a prospective population of heat-stressed ewes raised in a semiarid environment.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103475,112,NA,NA,103475,Heat-stress; Thermo-tolerance; Reproduction; SNPs
article,Mechanisms underlying thermal breadth differ by species in insects from adjacent but thermally distinct streams - A test of the climate variability hypothesis,"Birrell, Jackson H. and Frakes, James I. and Shah, Alisha A. and Woods, H. Arthur",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The Climate Variability Hypothesis (CVH) predicts that ectotherms from thermally variable climates should have wider thermal tolerances than their counterparts living in stable climates. Although the CVH has been widely supported, the mechanisms underlying wider tolerance traits remain unclear. We test the CVH along with three mechanistic hypotheses that may explain how differences in tolerance limits arise: 1) Short-term Acclimation Hypothesis (mechanism: rapid, reversible plasticity), 2) Long-term Effects Hypothesis (mechanisms: developmental plasticity, epigenetics, maternal effects, or adaptation), and 3) Trade-off Hypothesis (mechanism: tradeoff between short- and long-term responses). We tested these hypotheses by measuring CTMIN, CTMAX, and thermal breadths (CTMAX - CTMIN) of aquatic mayfly and stonefly nymphs from adjacent streams with distinctly different levels of thermal variation following acclimation to either cool, control, and warm conditions. In one stream, daily mean temperature varied by about 5 degrees C annually, whereas in the other, it varied by more than 25 degrees C. In support of the CVH, we found that mayfly and stonefly nymphs from the thermally variable stream had broader thermal tolerances than those from the thermally stable stream. However, support for the mechanistic hypotheses differed by species. Mayflies appear to rely on long-term strategies for maintaining broader thermal limits, whereas stoneflies achieve broader thermal limits via short-term plasticity. We found no support for the Trade-off Hypothesis.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103435,112,NA,NA,103435,Acclimation; Local adaptation; Plasticity; Temperature; Thermal tolerance; Thermal physiology
article,Can the body mass index influence the skin temperature of adolescents assessed by infrared thermography?,"Reis, Hamilton Henrique Teixeira and Brito, Ciro Jose and Sillero-Quintana, Manuel and da Silva, Alisson Gomes and Fernandez-Cuevas, Ismael and Cerqueira, Matheus Santos and Werneck, Francisco Zacaron and Marins, Joao Carlos Bouzas",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Infrared thermography (IRT) is a technology that has been used as an auxiliary tool in the diagnostic process of several diseases and in sports monitoring to prevent injuries. However, the evaluation of a thermogram can be influenced by several factors that need to be understood and controlled to avoid a misinterpretation of the thermogram and, consequently, an inappropriate clinical action. Among the possible factors that can affect IRT are anthropometric factors, especially those related to body composition. Based on these, our objective was to verify the influence of Body Mass Index (BMI) on skin temperature (Tsk) in male adolescents. One hundred male adolescents (age: 16.83 +/- 1.08 years; body mass: 66.51 +/- 13.35 kg; height: 1.75 +/- 7.04 m and BMI: 21.57 +/- 4.06 kg/m2) were evaluated and divided into three groups, based on the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed classification ranges: underweight (n = 33), normal weight (n = 34) and overweight/obesity (n = 34). Thermograms were obtained using the FLIR T420 thermal imager after a period of acclimatization of the subjects in a controlled environment (temperature: 21.3 +/- 0.7 degrees C and humidity: 55.3 +/- 2.2\%); they were evaluated using the ThermoHuman (R) software, integrating the original regions of interest (ROI) into seven larger ROIs. The results showed that underweight individuals had higher Tsk values than normal weight and overweight/obese individuals for all evaluated ROIs, and overweight/obese individuals had lower Tsk values than normal weight individuals for most evaluated ROIs, except for arms region. BMI showed a correlation of-0.68 and-0.64 for the anterior and posterior regions of the trunk, respectively. Thermal normality tables were proposed for various ROIs according to BMI classification. Our study demonstrated that BMI can affect the Tsk values assessed by IRT and needs to be considered to interpret the thermograms.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103424,111,NA,NA,103424,Temperature mapping; Body composition; Adiposity; Teenagers
article,High temperature and hyperkalemia cause exit block of action potentials at the atrioventricular junction of rainbow trout<i> (Oncorhynchus</i><i> mykiss)</i> heart,"Kuzmin, Vladislav and Ushenin, Konstantin S. and Dzhumaniiazova, Irina V. and Abramochkin, Denis and Vornanen, Matti",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"At critically high temperatures, atrioventricular (AV) block causes ventricular bradycardia and collapse of car-diac output in fish. Here, the possible role of the AV canal in high temperature-induced heart failure was examined. To this end, optical mapping was used to measure action potential (AP) conduction in isolated AV junction preparations of the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) heart during acute warming/cooling in the presence of 4 or 8 mM external K+ concentration. The preparation included the AV canal and some atrial and ventricular tissue at its edges, and it was paced either from atrial or ventricular side at a frequency of 0.67 Hz (40 beats min-1) to trigger forward (anterograde) and backward (retrograde) conduction, respectively. The propa-gation of AP was fast in atrial and ventricular tissues, but much slower in the AV canal, causing an AV delay. Acute warming from 15 degrees C to 27 degrees C or cooling from 15 degrees C to 5 degrees C did not impair AP conduction in the AV canal, as both anterograde and retrograde excitations propagated regularly through the AV canal. In contrast, anter-ograde conduction through the AV canal did not trigger ventricular excitation at the boundary zone between the AV canal and the ventricle when extracellular K+ concentration was raised from 4 mM to 8 mM at 27 degrees C. Also, the retrograde conduction was blocked at the border between the AV canal and the atrium in high K+ at 27 degrees C. These findings suggest that the AV canal is resistant against high temperatures (and high K+), but the ventricular muscle cannot be excited by APs coming from the AV canal when temperature and external K+ concentration are simultaneously elevated. Therefore, bradycardia at high temperatures in fish may occur due to inability of AP of the AV canal to trigger ventricular AP at the junctional zone between the AV canal and the proximal part of the ventricle.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103378,110,NA,NA,103378,Electrical excitation; Atrioventricular delay; Bradycardia; Conduction block; Temperature tolerance
article,Thermal changes in the sacral region with different mattresses used in the prevention of pressure injuries,"Itakura, Daniela Akemi and Nakato, Adriane Muller and Hembecker, Paula Karina and Neves, Eduardo Borba and Nohama, Percy",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Background: Pressure Injury (PI) is a severe health problem that affects millions of people. As a preventive strategy for high-risk ICU patients, the appropriate selection of a support surface is essential for preventing PI, along with risk assessment and repositioning. Increasing skin temperature has been associated with a higher susceptibility to PI development.Objective: This study aimed to evaluate thermal variations related to skin pressure in the sacral area of healthy individuals lying on three different mattresses models (standard, inflatable air, and egg crate).Design: Experimental study.Main outcomes: Initially, a survey was performed to identify the mattresses models most used in four public university hospitals and preventive strategies adopted. And then, an experimental study was conducted with a non-probabilistic sample involving 28 individuals of both sexes, aged 18-35 years old. The volunteers were immobilized for 2 h, and temperature variations in the sacral region were obtained by acquiring thermal images. Results: A significant difference was not found in the temperature recorded on the three mattresses models before the experiment. However, there were significant differences at the 1st and 31st minute (p < 0.001). The lowest temperature values were identified in the air inflatable mattress. Post-hoc comparisons revealed a significant difference between standard or egg crate mattresses and the inflatable air model.Conclusion: The inflatable air mattress should be considered for preventing pressure injury in ICU patients since the temperature had returned to the initial value (pre-test) after the 31st min. In addition to the appropriate selection surface, risk assessment and positioning are essential to PI prevention strategies.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103366,110,NA,NA,103366,Pressure ulcer; Reactive hyperemia; Temperature mapping; Thermography; Bed; standards; Patient care
article,Temperature-mediated developmental plasticity in winter and summer larvae of Palaemon serratus,"Baudet, Jean -Baptiste and Xuereb, Benoit and Duflot, Aurelie and Poret, Agnes and Maniez, Emeline and Le Foll, Frank and Coulaud, Romain",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In a seasonal environment, variation in larval phenotype and developmental plasticity allow crustacean larvae to maximise survival by lengthening or shortening their development. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of temperature, laying season and their interaction on larval developmental pathways (larval instars and larval stages). We monitored the different larval stages and calculated the number of larval instars reached during the development of winter and summer larvae of Palaemon serratus incubated at 12, 16 or 20 degrees C. We observed a great variability in the larval development (6-13 larval instars and 6 to 11 larval stages). A higher temperature decreases the development time and the number of larval instars. At a given temperature, the development time of winter and summer larvae was not different. Two larval stages were considered supernu-merary (zoea 4 and 6), as they were more frequent at low temperatures. At higher temperatures, some larvae started to develop pleopods as early as the third instar, larval stage which had never been described (named here zoea 3 `). This phenomenon was more common in winter larvae than in summer larvae. These results provide new insights into the expression of developmental plasticity in decapod larvae.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103343,110,NA,NA,103343,Larval ecology; Plasticity; Developmental pathways; Larval instars; Larval stages; Palaemon serratus
article,The effect of heat acclimation on the sweat lactate concentration vs. sweat rate relationship,"Weller, Rebecca S. and Buono, Michael J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"It is well known that there is a high concentration of lactate in sweat. Interest in measuring sweat lactate has arisen from its potential role in several clinical and sport performance applications. However, the effect of heat acclimation on sweat lactate concentration is still under debate. This is partly because sweat lactate concen-tration is greatly affected by sweat rate, which is known to increase during heat acclimation. Thus, to better understand this issue it is necessary to account for sweat rate - which has not been done previously in the literature. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to determine the effect of heat acclimation on the relationship between sweat rate vs. sweat lactate concentration. Six subjects completed a 7-day heat acclimation protocol. The daily 2-h exercise bout was split into three 40-min intervals with exercise intensity increasing with each successive interval. This was done to induce three different sweat rates to determine the sweat rate vs. sweat lactate concentration relationship before and after heat acclimation for each participant. A 2 (heat acclimation) x 3 (sweat rate) repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to determine statistical significance. There was a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in the grand mean sweat lactate concentration over the course of seven days of heat acclimation from 17.0 symbolscript 5.0 to 11.3 symbolscript 1.1 mmol/L (p < 0.05). A significant (p < 0.05) heat acclimation x sweat rate ordinal interaction was also found. The results of the current study show that heat acclimation significantly decreases the sweat lactate concentration. In addition, there was a significant ordinal interaction which suggests that the impact of sweat rate on sweat lactate concentration is decreased following heat acclimation.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103325,109,NA,NA,103325,Heat acclimation; Thermoregulation; Sweat lactate concentration; Sweat rate
article,The thermal neutral zone is shifted during lactation in striped hamsters,"Liu, Wei and Zhao, Zhi-Jun",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The thermoneutral zone (TNZ), one of the most well-recognized concepts of thermal physiology of homeothermic organisms, is observed to differ between animal species, and may be associated with energy expenditure. However, the characteristics of the TNZ of lactating females, the stage of life history with typically the highest energy demands, remain unclear. In this study, we examined body mass, metabolic rate, TNZ and body composition, and milk energy output, in striped hamsters (Cricetulus barabensis, mean body mass: 29.1 +/- 4.4g ranging from 20.0 to 36.6g) at peak lactation, and in hamsters raising small, medium, and large litter sizes throughout lactation. There was a significant downward shift in the lower critical temperature (LCT) of the TNZ in lactating hamsters (TNZ = 22.5-35 ?C), resulting in a wider TNZ compared to non-reproductive females (TNZ = 27.5-32.5 ?C). At peak lactation, hamsters raising large litter sizes had a considerably lower LCT and a wider TNZ compared to hamsters raising medium and small sized litters, whose upper critical temperature of the TNZ remain fixed. Compared to virgin hamsters, hamsters at peak lactation consumed 2.5 times more food, and had significantly higher energy expenditure corresponding to a significantly higher resting metabolic rate and milk output to meet the requirements of their offspring, which increased with litter size. The organs with the highest oxygen consumption rates, such as the liver, kidneys, and digestive tracts, were considerably heavier in lactating hamsters, particular in those raising large litter sizes, compared to virgin hamsters. The data show that the increased energy expenditure during lactation induces a substantial downward shift of the LCT, consequently resulting in a wider TNZ. The morphological plasticity of organs with high energy requirements is likely involved in this TNZ shift.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103303,108,NA,NA,103303,Body composition; Lactation; Litter size; Metabolic rate; Temperature
article,Timing of parental breeding shapes sensitivity to nitrate pollution in the common frog Rana temporaria,"Ruthsatz, Katharina and Bartels, Fabian and Stuetzer, Dominik and Eterovick, Paula C.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Climate change is expected to increase mean temperatures and the frequency of extreme weather events, that can lead to earlier/extended breeding seasons in temperate taxa. As a consequence, many organisms that show climate-induced phenological shifts might be exposed to environmental conditions they are not well adapted to while breeding, and their ability to cope with stressful conditions might be influenced. Here, we investigated how parental breeding time shapes the sensitivity to nitrate exposure at three consecutive life stages (embryonic, larval, juvenile) in the European common frog (Rana temporaria). We compared hatching success and life-stage specific survival, growth, standard metabolic rate, body condition, and acute thermal sensitivity of offspring from an earlier-breeding parental cohort (early cohort) vs. a later-breeding parental cohort (late cohort) exposed to a range of environmentally relevant concentrations of nitrate (0-100 mg/L). We also investigated whether nitrate exposure experienced during the embryonic and larval stages affects physiological performance in later life stages (after metamorphosis). Our study reveals that parental breeding time affects the sensitivity to nitrate pollution at three consecutive life stages in Rana temporaria. Breeding later in spring reduced hatching size and survival at high nitrate exposure, but also induced compensatory growth of the offspring. In both early and late cohorts, exposure to nitrate pollution reduced developmental rate and led to larger, but older larvae at the onset of metamorphosis with a greater sensitivity to warmer environmental temperatures. Standard metabolic rate, on the contrary, was neither affected by parental breeding time nor by exposure to nitrate. Exposure to nitrate pollution during embryonic and larval development led to carry-over in juvenile froglets as their sensitivity to temperature was higher. In a world highly impacted by humans, it is thus essential to give stressors a more holistic approach in order to better predict their consequences on species subjected to them.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103296,108,NA,NA,103296,Amphibians; Climate change; Phenology; Breeding behavior; Conservation physiology; Growth compensation

M. and Ju, Xianghong",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Heat stress (HS)-induced intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis may play a pivotal role in intestinal barrier dysfunction in animals. However, the underlying molecular mechanism by which HS induces apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells is still poorly understood. Herein, a eukaryotic expression vector for an HSP70 gene was constructed and transfected into intestinal porcine epithelial cells (IPEC-J2). Afterward, functional proteomics approaches followed by liquid-chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were used to identify interacting proteins. Analysis of HSP70 transfected IPEC-J2 cells revealed 246 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), and functional annotation indicated that most DEPs were primarily related to ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, and apoptosis. Furtherly, the apoptosis rate and expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins in HSP70 transfected IPEC-J2 cells were detected, we found that the expression of caspase-3, PARP, and Bax were increased, but Bcl-2 were decreased in transfected cells. Lastly, an in vitro and in vivo heat stress model were established to explore the role of HSP70 in intestinal epithelia cell apoptosis. The results of in vitrol study showed that HS-induced cellular apoptosis and increases of caspase-3, PARP, and Bax, but decreased of Bcl-2 in IPEC-J2 cells. In vivo study, the cell apoptosis were induced significantly in the duodenum, cecum, and colon of heat stressed pigs, and upregulation of HSP70 was also detected in colon tissues.

article,"The effect of temperature on growth performance and aerobic metabolic scope in Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus (L.)","Beuvard, Christian and Imsland, Albert K. D. and Thorarensen, Helgi",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In recent years, Arctic char populations in Iceland have declined and the objective of this experiment was to throw further light on these changes by examining the effect of temperature (5, 9, 13, 17, and 21 degrees C) on the survival, growth rate, metabolism, and physiological indices of juvenile Arctic charr (initial mean body mass 4.02 +/- 0.8 g). Mortality was 60\% at 21 degrees C while at lower temperatures it was below 5\%. However, Arctic charr populations in Iceland are declining in locations where the ambient temperature is lower, suggesting that other factors may be more important in determining the abundance of the species. The optimum temperature for growth was near 14 degrees C. The growth rate was progressively reduced at supra-optimum temperatures with almost no growth at 21 degrees C. Indicators of energy reserves: condition factor, relative intestinal mass, and hepatosomatic index are all consistent with reduced feed intake at supra-optimum temperatures. The standard and maximum metabolic rate (SMR; MMR), as well as the aerobic scope for activity (AS), were maximum at 13 degrees C. The routine metabolic rate (RMR) increased exponentially with temperature and, at T21, it was equal to the MMR suggesting, that the RMR was limited by the MMR. Moreover, increased heart- and gill mass at 21 degrees C are consistent with increased stress on the cardiovascular system. These findings are in keeping with the OCLTT hypothesis that the thermal tolerance of fish is limited by the capacity of the cardiovascular system to deliver oxygen and support metabolism. Taken together, the results of this experiment suggest, that growth rate is reduced at supra-optimum temperatures because of reduced energy intake, increased metabolic demand, and limitations in the capacity of the cardiovascular system to support metabolic rate at high temperatures. At lower temperatures, growth does not appear to be limited by the AS.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103117,104,NA,NA,103117,Fish; Temperature; Metabolic rate; Global warming
article,Fast and dark: The case of Mezquite lizards at extreme altitude,"Carlos Gonzalez-Morales, Juan and Rivera-Rea, Jimena and Moreno-Rueda, Gregorio and Bastiaans, Elizabeth and Castro-Lopez, Meily and Fajardo, Victor",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Sprint speed is a major performance trait in animal fitness involved in escaping from predators, obtaining food, and defending territory. Biotic and abiotic factors may influence sprint speed in lizards. Temperature decreases at higher altitude. Therefore, lizards at high elevations may require longer basking times to reach optimal body temperatures, increasing their vulnerability to predation and decreasing their time for other activities such as foraging or reproduction. Here, we tested whether the maximum sprint speed of a lizard that shows conservative thermal ecology varied along an altitudinal gradient comprising low (2500 m), middle (3400 m) and highaltitude (4300 m) populations. We also tested whether sprint speed was related to dorsal reflectance at different ecologically relevant temperatures. Given that the lizard Sceloporus grammicus shows conservative thermal ecology with altitude, we expected that overall average sprint speed would not vary with altitude. However, given that darker lizards heat up quicker, we expected that darker lizards would be faster than lighter lizards. Our results suggest that S. grammicus at high altitude are faster and darker at 30 degrees C, while lizards from low and middle altitude are faster and lighter in color at 20 degrees C than high altitude lizards. Also, our results suggest a positive relationship between sprint speed and dorsal skin reflectance at 10 and 20 degrees C. Sprint speed was also affected by snout-vent length, leg length, and leg thickness at 10 degrees C. These results suggest that, even though predation pressure is lower at extreme altitudes, other factors such as vegetation cover or foraging mode have influenced sprint speed.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103115,102,NA,NA,103115,Sprint speed; Reflectance; Altitudinal gradient; Body temperature; Sceloporus grammicus; Performance

O.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Heat stress is the most significant environmental factor involved in the impairment of the health status of rabbits and lowering their productivity. Using medicinal feed additives is suggested to relieve heat stress-induced oxidative stress in rabbits. The study investigated the possible protective role of ginger root (Zingiber officinale) against heat stress in rabbits. Five week old rabbits were assigned randomly into four groups (48 rabbits each) and fed a basal diet supplemented with 0, 2.5, 5.0, and 7.5 g ginger powder/kg diet. The temperature and relative humidity inside the rabbitry units were kept at 33.0 +/- 5.5 degrees C and 74.5 +/- 4.5\%, respectively, during 8 weeks fattening period. The results showed that rabbits that received the 7.5 g ginger powder/kg supplement had the highest final body weight. Rabbits that received different ginger powder levels recorded lower mortality values during the experimental period compared to that received the control diet, but the differences were not significant (5.0 vs. 10.0\%, respectively). Rabbits fed 5.0 and 7.5 g ginger diet recorded the best food conversion ratio (P < 0.001). The weight of the carcass was significantly increased (P < 0.01) by supplementing ginger powder in diets. The digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, and nitrogen free extracts nutrients was increased, but ether extract was significantly decreased (P < 0.001) by using ginger powder in diets. The detected blood metabolites displayed increased total protein but decreased triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in rabbits treated with ginger. Rabbits fed 5.0 and 7.5 g ginger powder had the highest plasma total antioxidative capacity (TAC) and the lowest (P < 0.01) plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration compared to those fed control diet.

Such a relationship would support IRT as a non-invasive method to monitor these physiological responses. However, the literature remains controversial. Here, we determine the relationship between exercise-induced muscle soreness (DOMS), pain, and skin temperature in men and women before and after exercise. Twenty-two physically active adults (10 men and 12 women) completed a squat exercise protocol to induce muscle damage. Skin temperature, DOMS, and pressure pain threshold (PPT) were assessed in the quadriceps pre, post-exercise, and 48 h post-exercise. DOMS increased similarly in men and women post-exercise and 48 h post-exercise. PPT was lower in women compared to men. PPT decreased 48 h post-exercise for men but did not differ between the moments for women. Skin temperature responses were sexdependent. Mean and maximum temperatures increased post-exercise for men, and maximum temperature reduced 48 h post-exercise. In women, the minimum temperature increased 48 h post-exercise. DOMS was not predicted by skin temperature but showed a direct association between pre and 48 h post-exercise variation of maximum skin temperature and PPT. We conclude that there is a sex-dependent effect in analyzing skin temperature changes in response to exercise, something that seems to not have been addressed in previous studies.

article,Integrating thermal infrared stream temperature imagery and spatial stream network models to understand natural spatial thermal variability in streams,"Fuller, Matthew R. and Ebersole, Joseph L. and Detenbeck, Naomi E. and Labiosa, Rochelle and Leinenbach, Peter and Torgersen, Christian E.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Under a warmer future climate, thermal refuges could facilitate the persistence of species relying on cold-water habitat. Often these refuges are small and easily missed or smoothed out by averaging in models. Thermal infrared (TIR) imagery can provide empirical water surface temperatures that capture these features at a high spatial resolution (<1 m) and over tens of kilometers. Our study examined how TIR data could be used along with spatial stream network (SSN) models to characterize thermal regimes spatially in the Middle Fork John Day (MFJD) River mainstem (Oregon, USA). We characterized thermal variation in seven TIR longitudinal temperature profiles along the MFJD mainstem and compared them with SSN model predictions of stream temperature (for the same time periods as the TIR profiles). TIR profiles identified reaches of the MFJD mainstem with consistently cooler temperatures across years that were not consistently captured by the SSN prediction models. SSN predictions along the mainstem identified similar to 80\% of the 1-km reach scale temperature warming or cooling trends observed in the TIR profiles. We assessed whether landscape features (e.g., tributary junctions, valley confinement, geomorphic reach classifications) could explain the fine-scale thermal heterogeneity in the TIR profiles (after accounting for the reach-scale temperature variability predicted by the SSN model) by fitting SSN models using the TIR profile observation points. Only the distance to the nearest upstream tributary was identified as a statistically significant landscape feature for explaining some of the thermal variability in the TIR profile data. When combined, TIR data and SSN models provide a data-rich evaluation of stream temperature captured in TIR imagery and a spatially extensive prediction of the network thermal diversity from the outlet to the headwaters.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103028,100,NA,NA,103028,Thermal regime; Middle Fork John Day River; Spatial autocorrelation; Airborne remote sensing; Cold-water habitat; Thermal infrared imagery; Spatial stream network model

Also, blood cortisol (p = 0.002), glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) (p = 0.009), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (p = 0.004) and standing time (p = 0.009) were increased in moderate and severe THI levels compared with threshold after exposure to HS conditions. However, in the severe THI group, blood cortisol (p < 0.05), glucose (p < 0.05), GOT (p < 0.05) and BUN (p < 0.05) levels were returned to normal range after 6-13 days of continuous HS exposure. In conclusion, DMI, blood cortisol, GOT, glucose, BUN, and standing time were closely associated with long-term HS condition in beef calves. In addition, calves exposed to HS modulated their physiological responses that resulted in the regulation of the pertinent blood metabolites in the blood to maintain homeostasis during the long-term HS.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103033,100,NA,NA,103033,Heat stress; Growth performance; Blood profile; Behaviour; Korean native beef calves
article,Effect of ice slurry ingestion on core temperature and blood pressure response after exercise in a hot environment,"Nakamura, Mariko and Nakamura, Daisuke and Yasumatsu, Mikinobu and Takahashi, Hideyuki",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Delays in the restoration of thermoregulation after exercise in a hot environment has been associated with post-exercise hypotension. This study tested the hypothesis that simultaneous internal cooling and rehydration by ingesting ice slurry prevents the excessive decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and promotes recovery of core and skin temperatures in male athletes. Seven male athletes participated in this randomized controlled trial with a crossover design. The participants ran on a treadmill at 75\% of their maximal oxygen uptake in the heat (35 degrees C, 60\% relative humidity), up to exhaustion. Immediately after exercise, participants ingested either 4 g.kg(-1) body weight of ice slurry (0.5 degrees C, ICE) or a control beverage (28 degrees C, CON). The participants then recovered by sitting for 20 min. We measured participants' rectal temperature (T-re), skin temperature (T-sk), mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), total peripheral resistance (TPR), and physiological strain index (PSI) before exercise (Pre), after running to exhaustion (PEx), and at 0 (P0), 10 (P10), and 20 (P20) minutes after ice slurry or control beverage ingestion. MAP, CO, HR, TPR, or PSI did not change significantly during the recovery period. At P10 and P20, T-re and T-sk significantly decreased in the ICE group compared to the CON group (p < 0.05). These results suggested that ingestion of ice slurry, post-exercise, promoted core and skin temperature recovery but did not affect the central and peripheral cardiovascular responses during the acute recovery period.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102922,98,NA,NA,102922,Heat; Internal cooling; Post-exercise hypotension; Recovery
article,Thermal optimum for mass production of the live feed organism <i>Enchytraeus albidus</i>,"Dai, Wencai and Slotsbo, Stine and Holmstrup, Martin",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Live feed organisms are essential for the larval stages of many fish species grown in aquaculture, and juvenile fish reared on live feeds often exhibit higher survival and growth than those reared on formulated feed. The terrestrial enchytraeid (white worm), Enchytraeus albidus, has potential as a sustainable source of live feed because it can easily be mass produced, feeds on a wide range of organic waste materials and has high contents of protein and long-chain poly-unsaturated fatty acids. In the present study, we observed the effect of temperature on population growth over five months using soil microcosms. At the outset, each microcosm was supplied with approximately the same number of cocoons. Hatched enchytraeids were given rolled oats ad libitum as feed. We followed the population growth at seven temperatures in the range of 4-25 degrees C and investigated body composition in order to find optimal temperature for mass production. Results showed that E. albidus has a broad thermal optimum range and displays almost similar biomass production in the range of 15-22 degrees C with specific growth rates between 6.5 and 6.8\%. In this temperature range, protein contents were 40-45\%, glycogen contents 20-25\% and total fatty acid contents 15-20\% of dry weight. The temperature had a highly significant effect on fatty acid composition. In particular, the abundance of omega-3 fatty acids (18:3 omega 3 and 20:5 omega 3) was largest at low temperature. For what concerns achievable density of worms in mass cultures, our results surpassed previous results and showed that densities close to 100 g L-1 substrate are realistic. Maximum production of biomass can likely reach 80 g live worms L-1 month(-1) at temperatures between 15 and 22 degrees C.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102865,97,NA,NA,102865,Temperature; White worms; Biomass; Specific growth rate; Fatty acids

Fifty Brahman bulls were evaluated in relation to productive performance and adaptive capacity to a hot environment. The animals were grouped according to the following characteristics: Respiratory rate (RR), Sweating rate (SR) and coat traits. Three clusters were formed with these different characteristics related to thermoregulation after that these clusters were compared with productive performance that includes weighing of animals, carcass and scrotal circumference. The high adapted group corresponded to the animals with higher productive performance, with heavier animals in terms of weight at 550 days and carcass weight. The principal components analysis (PCA1) showed that carcass weight (0.95), weight at 550 days (0.92) and gain weight (0.71) were characteristics strongly correlated with the performance of the animals. These sets of characteristics were analyzed together (productive characteristics) in a multiple regression. The animals with better productive performance presented shorter hair, a greater capacity to heat dissipate by sweating and a lower rectal temperature. These characteristics were most suitable to inclusion in the breeding programs, resulting in higher economic gains. It is possible to simultaneously select resistant animals to thermal stress as well as to maintain the productivity of the flocks.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102736,93,NA,NA,102736,Adaptability; Bos indicus; Hot environment; Multiple regression; Selection criteria
article,Can the aging influence cold environment mediated cancer risk in the USA female population?,"Bandyopadhayaya, Shreetama and Bundel, Rashmi and Tyagi, Shikhar and Pandey, Arvind and Mandal, Chandi C.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Cancer is one of the most debilitating diseases worldwide. Cancer incidence and/or death depends on several intrinsic and extrinsic factors (e.g., dietary habits, socio-behavioral activities, physical inactivity, smoking, alcohol consumption, gender, races/ethnicities and age). Various studies have found that an inverse relationship subsists between environmental temperature and cancer risk. Furthermore, this negative relationship was found to be more consistent in the USA female population. This research mainly focuses on influence of aging on cold environment mediated cancer risk for overall and various anatomical site-specific cancers. Age-specific countywise data of cancer incidence rate (CIR) in the USA female population was selected in this study. Statistical analysis found a negative correlation between the average annual temperature (AAT) and CIR in all anatomical sites (AAS; overall) as well as different anatomical site-specific cancers (e.g., breast, melanoma, leukaemia, pancreas, bladder, uterus, thyroid and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), except for cervical cancer) in different age groups (e.g., less than 50 years, 50 plus years, less than 65 years and 65 plus years). In addition, an inverse relationship between the AAT and CIR was found in case of paediatric cancer. However, all the results obtained from the linear model based statistical analysis proposed that the older age-group of females particularly above 65 years seems to be more prone to cold temperature linked cancer risk. For example, age-specific cold linked cancer incidence appears to be more inclined in case of breast cancer in the age-group of 65 plus years. This study, for first time, proposes that aging may have a positive influence on the relationship between cancer incidence and environment temperature.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102676,92,NA,NA,102676,Age; Environmental temperature; Cancer incidence; Statistical analysis; USA female Population

The present study aimed to assess the effects of temperature and altitude on feeding attributes (consumption rate, conversion efficiency and growth rate) of adults from the wild populations of Z. bicolorata inhabiting India and Nepal. Results revealed that adults inhabiting areas of low temperature (24 degrees C - 25 degrees C) and high altitude (415 m -1400 m) were large and had higher food consumption rates. In contrast, those inhabiting areas of high temperature (34 degrees C - 36 degrees C) and low altitude (81 m - 229 m) were smaller and had higher food utilization efficiencies. In all the ecoclimatic regions, females were larger than males and had higher feeding attributes than their counterparts. Temperature between 27 degrees C and 30 degrees C was found optimal for Z. bicolorata adults to convert and utilize the food biomass to body mass. Above the optimal temperature the feeding attributes decreased. Present results suggest that there exists a possibility for decrease in body size, and thereby weed biocontrol efficiency of Z. bicolorata adults with an increase in temperature due to global climate change.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102540,89,NA,NA,102540,Weed biocontrol; Altitude; Temperature; Global climate change
article,Variation of thermal plasticity in growth and reproduction patterns: Importance of ancestral and developmental temperatures,"Loisel, Ayala and Isla, Alejandro and Daufresne, Martin",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature is an important ecological driver modulating life history traits of organisms, such as growth and reproduction. With the ongoing global warming, understanding the mechanisms underlying the effect of temperature on size and resource allocation trade-off is crucial. The temperature-size rule (TSR) describes plastic growth patterns in populations of ectothermic species under different thermal environments, whereby warming results in faster initial growth but lower size at maturity. However, the evolution of the TSR remains poorly understood. Here we conducted an experiment with populations of the medaka fish Oryzias latipes maintained at two temperatures for successive generations to investigate changes in the growth pattern of the TSR. After rearing six generations at cold (20 degrees C) and warm (30 degrees C) temperature, we conducted common garden experiments on the seventh generation where we compare growth trajectories and reproduction patterns in four different groups of fish: (i) fish reared at cold temperature over all seven generations (cold past and present), (ii) fish reared at warm temperature over six generations and at cold temperature at the seventh generation (warm past and cold present), (iii) fish reared at warm temperature over all seven generations (warm past and present) and (iv) fish reared at cold temperature over six generations and at warm temperature at the seventh generation (cold past and warm present). For each treatment, we monitored growth curves and reproduction, and investigated changes in model parameters and reproduction up to 350 days after hatching. Our study showed changes in TSR patterns according to ancestral and developmental temperatures. Developmental temperature mainly impacted age at maturity and asymptotic size, whereas size at maturity was driven more by the dissimilarity between developmental and ancestral temperatures. Our results also highlight a loss of plasticity in temperature-size and reproductive patterns for the fish that were reared under warm condition over six generations.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.029,84,NA,460-468,NA,Fish; Growth; Life history trait; Oryzias latipes; Reproduction; Temperature-size rule

Live specimens (5.8-3L4 g) were electro-fished from their natural habitat during representative months of four seasons with notable differences in water temperature, oxygen concentration and saturation. After 24-72 h of captive-acclimation, the fishes were examined for upper and lower critical thermal limits (CTmax, and CTmin), incipient lethal oxygen thresholds (ILOC and ILOS), apparent routine and maximum oxygen consumption rates (M-O2rout and M-O2max), and blood haemoglobin-haematocrit. Across the seasons, mean CTmin and CTmax values ranged from similar to 0 to 34.6 degrees C, suggesting a relatively wide acute thermal tolerance range for this predominantly cold-water fish. Changes in the habitat's thermal condition during winter to summer was reflected in the CTmin (similar to 0-2.4 degrees C) and CTmax (31.7-34.4 degrees C) estimates, while the highest thermal scope (CTmax-CTmin; 33.2 degrees C) was recorded in autumn. Concurrently, the incipient lethal hypoxia threshold observed in autumn (ILOS-2.6\% and ILOC-0.19 mgO(2)/L) was significantly lower than the other three seasons, possibly linked to warm-acclimation. The reduction in blood haemoglobin-haematocrit levels during winter could limit the oxygen carrying capacity, with possible reciprocations in thermal tolerance and aerobic metabolism. Concerning body mass corrected oxygen consumption, the apparent M-O2rout was found to increase in a temperature-dependent manner from 150.3 mgO(2)/kg/h at 12 degrees C to 315.2 mgO(2)/kg/h at 26 degrees C, with Q(10) ranging from 1.6 to 2.2. Whereas, changes in M-O2max was not temperature sensitive (Q(10) of 0.7-1.3), except during spring-summer (Q(10)-2), with lowest and highest measurements in spring and autumn (934 and 1514 mgO(2)/kg/h), respectively.

article,Changes in biochemical contents and survival rates of two stored product moths under different thermal regimes,"Izadi, H. and Mohammadzadeh, M. and Mehrabian, M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Plodia interpunctella (Hiibner) and Ectomyelois ceratoniae (Zeller) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) are two destructive pests of stored products. Survival and physiological changes of last instar larvae were investigated under different thermal regimes {[}i.e. control (optimal temperature), cold-acclimation (CA), fluctuating-acclimation (FA) and rapid cold-hardiness (RCH)]. Our results indicate a relationship between supercooling points, carbohydrate contents, enzyme activities and survival rates of the larvae under different thermal regimes. Glycogen content was greatest for control and RCH regimes whereas the greatest trehalose level was recorded for the CA regime. The supercooling points of control larvae of P. interpunctella and E. ceratoniae were - 14 and - 10 degrees C, respectively, and decreased to - 16 and - 18 degrees C under the CA regime. Thermal regimes had no significant effect on the survival of the larvae after 24 h exposure at 0 degrees C, but when larvae exposed to - 5 degrees C for 24 h, the highest and lowest survival rates were recorded in the CA and RCH regimes, respectively. Protein phosphatases 1 and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) were found to have the highest enzyme activity. The activity of AMPK varied between different thermal regimes and was greatest under the CA regime. CA considerably increased lower lethal times of the larvae compared with the control regime. RCH showed the highest impact on lower lethal temperature limits of the larvae. Our results indicated a characteristic enhancement of the survival rates of the larvae of P. interpuntella and E. ceratoniae under the CA regime.

K. and Nashar, Toufic O.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Heat stress (HS) is one of the most serious adverse conditions that affect poultry causing immunosuppression and decreasing production. In a novel approach, we investigated effects of supplementing copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO-NPs) on the immune response in two commercial broiler strains (Ross 308 and Cobb 500). At one day old, birds were divided into 3 groups with 3 replicates for each. The first group received diet supplemented with 100\% of their recommended copper requirements as CuO while, in the second and third groups, birds were given diets supplemented with 100\% and 50\% of the recommended Cu requirements in the form of CuO-NPs, respectively. At age of 21 day, each group was subdivided randomly into normal (24 +/- 2 degrees C) and heat stressed (33 +/- 2 degrees C for 5 h per day for two successive weeks) groups. Under normal housing temperature, CuO-NPs, significantly enhanced the immune response in these birds, compared to CuO shown by the increased levels of phagocytic activity (PA), lysozyme serum activity, and by upregulating immune-modulator genes including NF-kappa beta, PGES, IL-1 beta, TGF-1 beta, IFN-gamma, BAX and CASP8. The responses were different between the two studied strains especially at the level of gene expression. In HS birds, supplementation of CuO-NPs reduced HS induced inflammatory conditions, as shown by lower gene expression levels, lower degenerative changes in the spleen, and altered heterophils/lymphocytes (H/L) ratio. We suggest CuO-NPs supplementation, especially in those chickens that received diet supplemented with 50\% of their recommended Cu requirements, could be used under normal housing temperature to enhance the birds' immune response, and during HS to lower heat stress-induced degenerative changes depending on the magnitude of the HS.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.10.009,78,NA,235-246,NA,CuO-NPs; Broilers; Immune Response; Inflammatory response; Heat stress
article,Larval rearing of zebrafish at suboptimal temperatures,"Delomas, Thomas A. and Dabrowski, Konrad",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature-sensitive mutants have been widely utilized in single-cell and invertebrate model systems, particularly to study the function of essential genes. Few temperature-sensitive mutants have been identified in zebrafish, likely due to the difficulty of raising zebrafish at low temperatures. We describe a novel rearing protocol that allows rapid growth of larval and juvenile zebrafish at 23 degrees C compared to previous data in the literature. Embryos collected from four breeding pairs were maintained at 28.5 +/- 0.5 degrees C until 5 days post-fertilization (dpf) - the onset of exogenous feeding. Larvae were then divided to six tanks and three tanks were cooled to 23 +/- 0.2 degrees C. Fish were fed a live diet (marine rotifers Brachionus plicatilis and Anemia nauplii) and maintained under a set of environmental parameters shown to increase growth rate: continuous light, low salinity (3ppt), and algal turbidity. Mean total length and weight of fish at 21dpf were 12.7 +/- 0.3 mm and 20.5 +/- 1.5 mg for the 23 degrees C treatment and 18.5 +/- 0.4 mm and 67.3 +/- 3.4 mg for the 28.5 degrees C control. By 35 dpf, the fish raised at 23 degrees C had reached a mean length and weight of 18.9 +/- 0.7 mm and 76.4 +/- 6.7 mg, approximately the size control fish reached at 21 dpf. At 35 dpf, water temperature was raised to 28 degrees C and fish were reared to maturity (75 dpf) under standard conditions (freshwater, 13 L:11D photoperiod, dry diet, no added algal turbidity). Sex ratio and fertility were assessed and compared between temperature groups. There were no significant differences in sex ratio, fertilization rate, embryo viability at 1 dpf, clutch size, or relative fecundity.

article,An experimental study and finite element modeling of head and neck cooling for brain hypothermia,"Li, Hui and Chen, Roland K. and Tang, Yong and Meurer, William and Shih, Albert J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Reducing brain temperature by head and neck cooling is likely to be the protective treatment for humans when subjects to sudden cardiac arrest. This study develops the experimental validation model and finite element modeling (FEM) to study the head and neck cooling separately, which can induce therapeutic hypothermia focused on the brain. Anatomically accurate geometries based on CT images of the skull and carotid artery are utilized to find the 3D geometry for FEM to analyze the temperature distributions and 3D-printing to build the physical model for experiment. The results show that FEM predicted and experimentally measured temperatures have good agreement, which can be used to predict the temporal and spatial temperature distributions of the tissue and blood during the head and neck cooling process. Effects of boundary condition, perfusion, blood flow rate, and size of cooling area are studied. For head cooling, the cooling penetration depth is greatly depending on the blood perfusion in the brain. In the normal blood flow condition, the neck internal carotid artery temperature is decreased only by about 0.13 degrees C after 60 min of hypothermia. In an ischemic (low blood flow rate) condition, such temperature can be decreased by about 1.0 degrees C. In conclusion, decreasing the blood perfusion and metabolic reduction factor could be more beneficial to cool the core zone. The results also suggest that more SBC researches should be explored, such as the optimization of simulation and experimental models, and to perform the experiment on human subjects.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.10.022,71,NA,99-111,NA,Hypothermia; Selective brain cooling; Finite element modeling; Carotid artery
article,The effect of heat stress on intestinal integrity and <i>Salmonella</i> invasion in broiler birds,"Alhenaky, Alhanof and Abdelqader, Anas and Abuajamieh, Mohannad and Al-Fataftah, Abdur-Rahman",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The intestinal mucosa works as a barrier to protect the internal environment of the animal from bacteria and bacterial toxins found in the gut lumen. Heat stress may harm this function. Therefore, we designed the current experiment to investigate the effect of heat stress on intestinal integrity, physiological and immunological responses and Salmonella invasion in broiler chickens. At 26 days of age, 72 birds were randomly distributed into 3 treatments, with 8 replicates per treatment and 3 birds per replicate. The three treatments were control treatment; kept at thermoneutral environmental conditions (20 +/- 2 degrees C), chronic heat stress treatment (exposed to 30 +/- 2 degrees C; 24 h/day) and acute heat stress treatment (exposed to 35 +/- 2 degrees C from 09:00 to 13:00 and kept at 20 +/- 1 degrees C from 13:00 to 09:00). The heat stress exposure was conducted for 10 successive days. Compared with the control treatment, birds subject to chronic and acute heat stress had reduced (P < 0.05) body weight and body gain and increased (P < 0.05) feed conversion ratio. However, feed intake and mortality rate were only increased (P < 0.05) in the acute heat stress treatment. Rectal temperature and Delta rectal temperature (degrees C/h) increased (P < 0.05) sharply during the first 2 days of exposure followed by gradual decreases until a plateau was achieved. Heat-stressed birds had increased (P < 0.05) serum concentrations of corticosterone, endotoxin lipopolysaccharide and the systemic inflammatory cytokine: TNF-alpha and IL-2, as well as a higher (P < 0.05) prevalence of Salmonella spp. in meat and livers, as compared with control treatment. It can be concluded that heat stress impaired intestinal integrity which resulted in increased intestinal permeability to endotoxin, translocation of intestinal pathogens (Salmonella spp.) and serum inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, avoiding thermal dysfunction of intestinal barrier is a significant factor in maintaining welfare, immune status and meat safety of broiler birds.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.10.015,70,B,9-14,NA,Chickens; Heat stress; Intestinal integrity; Endotoxin; Cytokines; Salmonella

An experiment was conducted to analyze the serum concentrations (SC) of free AA in pigs exposed to diurnal variations in AT. Six pigs (27.1 +/- 1.3 kg body weight) implanted with a thermometer to register the body temperature (BT) at 15-min intervals were used. Blood samples were collected on the last 3 d of the 14-d study, at 0700 h (lowest AT), 1200 h (mild HS), and 1600 h (severe HS). The pigs received 1.2 kg/d of an AA-supplemented, wheat-soybean meal diet, in two equal meals (0700 and 1900 h).

The SC (mu M/mL) of Ile, Lys, Met, Val, Ala, Asn, and Pro were higher (P <= 0.01); Arg, Phe, Glu, and Tyr tended to be higher (P <= 0.10); but Cys was lower (P < 0.05) at 1200 h than at 0700 h. Lys was higher, Cys and Tyr were lower (P < 0.05), and lie and Val tended to be higher (P <= 0.10) at 1600 h than at 0700 h. Serum Arg, Ile, Phe, Ala, Asn, Gln, Pro, Ser, and Tyr were lower (P < 0.05), and Leu and Val tended to be lower at 1600 h than at 1200 h.

article,Distance makes the difference in thermography for ecological studies,"Faye, E. and Dangles, O. and Pincebourde, S.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Surface temperature drives many ecological processes and infrared thermography is widely used by ecologists to measure the thermal heterogeneity of different species' habitats. However, the potential bias in temperature readings caused by distance between the surface to be measured and the camera is still poorly acknowledged. We examined the effect of distance from 0.3 to 80 m on a variety of thermal metrics (mean temperature, standard deviation, patch richness and aggregation) under various weather conditions and for different structural complexity of the studied surface types (various surfaces with vegetation). We found that distance is a key modifier of the temperature measured by a thermal infrared camera. A non-linear relationship between distance and mean temperature, standard deviation and patch richness led to a rapid under-estimation of the thermal metrics within the first 20 m and then only a slight decrease between 20 and 80 m from the object. Solar radiation also enhanced the bias with increasing distance. Therefore, surface temperatures were under-estimated as distance increased and thermal mosaics were homogenized at long distances with a much stronger bias in the warmer than the colder parts of the distributions. The under-estimation of thermal metrics due to distance was explained by atmospheric composition and the pixel size effect. The structural complexity of the surface had little effect on the surface temperature bias. Finally, we provide general guidelines for ecologists to minimize inaccuracies caused by distance from the studied surface in thermography. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Over a year, 100-110 lactating crossbred dairy goats underwent consistent IRT screenings, followed by a comprehensive evaluation of udder health status using the California mastitis test and somatic cell count (SCC). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to establish the cut-off values for different thermographic parameters in this study. The results revealed that the SCC increased significantly (p < 0.01) in healthy, SCM, and CM milk samples across the seasons. The analysis of ROC revealed a comparatively higher sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for udder thermograms during SCM than CM and vice versa for teat thermograms. IRT analysis reflected a difference (p < 0.01) in the udder and teat thermograms among quarters of healthy, SCM, and CM in summer, winter, autumn, and rainy seasons. A significant increase (p < 0.01) in udder thermograms was observed for quarters affected with SCM and CM relative to healthy, with an increase of 1.89 and 2.94 degree celsius in winter, 0.85 and 1.63 degree celsius in summer, 0.73 and 1.41 degree celsius in rainy, and 1.33 and 2.38 degrees C in autumn, respectively. Similarly, for teat thermograms it was 1.79 and 2.81 degree celsius in winter, 0.76 and 1.41 degrees C in summer, 0.70 and 1.37degree celsius in rainy, and 1.09 and 1.93 degree celsius in autumn, respectively. Therefore, regardless of the seasons examined in this study, IRT proves to be an effective and supportive tool for early mastitis detection in lactating crossbred dairy goats.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103947,124,NA,NA,103947,Crossbred goats; Mastitis; Season; Thermogram; IRT
article,"How hot is too hot? Thermal tolerance, performance, and preference in juvenile mangrove whiprays, Urogymnus granulatus","Higgins, Emily and Bouyoucos, Ian A. and Downie, Adam T. and Illing, Bjorn and Martins, Ana P. B. and Simpfendorfer, Colin A. and Rummer, Jodie L.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Mangrove habitats can serve as nursery areas for sharks and rays. Such environments can be thermally dynamic and extreme; yet, the physiological and behavioural mechanisms sharks and rays use to exploit such habitats are understudied. This study aimed to define the thermal niche of juvenile mangrove whiprays, Urogymnus granulatus. First, temperature tolerance limits were determined via the critical thermal maximum (CTMax) and minimum (CTMin) of mangrove whiprays at summer acclimation temperatures (28 degrees C), which were 17.5 degrees C and 39.9 degrees C, respectively. Then, maximum and routine oxygen uptake rates ((M)over dotO(2max) and (M)over dotO(2routine), respectively), post-exercise oxygen debt, and recovery were estimated at current (28 degrees C) and heatwave (32 degrees C) temperatures, revealing moderate temperature sensitivities (i.e., Q10) of 2.4 ((M)over dotO(2max)) and 1.6 ((M)over dotO(2routine)), but opposing effects on post-exercise oxygen uptake. Finally, body temperatures (Tb) of mangrove whiprays were recorded using external temperature loggers, and environmental temperatures (Te) were recorded using stationary temperature loggers moored in three habitat zones (mangrove, reef flat, and reef crest). As expected, environmental temperatures varied between sites depending on depth. Individual mangrove whiprays presented significantly lower Tb relative to Te during the hottest times of the day. Electivity analysis showed tagged individuals selected temperatures from 24.0 to 37.0 degrees C in habitats that ranged from 21.1 to 43.5 degrees C. These data demonstrate that mangrove whiprays employ thermotaxic behaviours and a thermally insensitive aerobic metabolism to thrive in thermally dynamic and extreme habitats. Tropical nursery areas may, therefore, offer important thermal refugia for young rays. However, these tropical nursery areas could become threatened by mangrove and coral habitat loss, and climate change.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103943,124,NA,NA,103943,Batoid nursery area; Biologging; Critical thermal maximum; Critical thermal minimum; Elasmobranch; Metabolic rate
article,The lack of plasticity and interspecific variability in thermal limits produce a highly heat-tolerant tropical host-parasitoid system,"Bussy, Mathieu and Destierdt, Wendy and Masnou, Pauline and Lazzari, Claudio and Goubault, Marlene and Pincebourde, Sylvain",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Thermal limits are often used as proxies to assess the vulnerability of ectotherms to environmental change. While meta-analyses point out a relatively low plasticity of heat limits and a large interspecific variability, only few studies have compared the heat tolerance of interacting species. The present study focuses on the thermal limits, and their plasticity (heat hardening), of three species co-occurring in Western Africa: two ectoparasitoid species, Dinarmus basalis (Rondani) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) and Eupelmus vuilleti (Crawford) (Hymenoptera: Eupelmidae), and their common host, Callosobruchus maculatus (F.) (Coleoptera: Bruchidae). The investigation delves into the Critical Thermal Maximum (CTmax), representing the upper tolerance limit, to understand how these species may cope with extreme thermal events. The CTmax of all three species appeared similarly high, hovering around 46.5 degrees C, exceeding the global mean CTmax observed in insects by 3.5 degrees C. Short-term exposure to moderate heat stress showed no impact on CTmax, suggesting a potential lack of heat hardening in these species. Therefore, we emphasized the similarity of heat tolerance in these interacting species, potentially stemming from both evolutionary adaptations to high temperatures during development and the stable and similar microclimate experienced by the three species over the years. While the high thermal tolerance should allow these species to endure extreme temperature events, the apparent lack of plasticity raises concerns about their ability to adapt to future climate change scenarios. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into the thermal physiology of these interacting species, providing a basis for understanding their responses to climate change and potential implications for the host-parasitoid system.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103930,123,NA,NA,103930,Thermal tolerance; Host-parasitoid interactions; Heat-hardening; Thermal stress; CTmax; Tropical insects

In this paper, we investigated the effects of the combined action of tea polyphenols (TP) and hydrogen-rich electrolyzed water (HRW) on HS in mice.

The results revealed that the combined treatment was more helpful in alleviating the effects of HS on the behavior, growth performance, oxidative damage, and intestinal tract of mice compared with the respective treatments of TP and HRW (P < 0.05). Additionally, the combined treatment could repair HS-induced intestinal dysbiosis in mice, augmenting the number and abundance of bacteria, increasing the number of beneficial genera (Lachnospiraceae\_NK4A136\_group and Lactobacillus), and decreasing the number of harmful genera (Desulfovibrio and Enterorhabdus), and the effect was significantly better than that of individual treatment (P < 0.05).

Livestock should adapt to tropical and subtropical areas and to meet this, composite breeds have been developed. This work aimed to evaluate gene expression profiles in the skin of Brangus cattle under heat stress using a case-control design, and to correlate this with skin histological characteristics. Two groups of bulls were set using rectal temperature as a criterion to define stress conditions: stressed (N = 5) and non-stressed (N = 5) groups. Skin transcriptomics was performed and correlations between breed composition, phenotypic and skin histological traits were evaluated. Results showed 4309 differentially expressed genes (P < 0.01), 2113 downregulated and 2196 upregulated. Enrichment and ontology analyses revealed 132 GO terms and 67 pathways (P < 0.01), including thermogenesis, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, mitochondrial activity, antioxidant and immune response, and apoptosis. The identity of the terms and pathways indicated the diversity of mechanisms directed to relieve the animals' suffering, acting from simple passive mechanisms (conduction, convection and radiation) to more complex active ones (behavioural changes, evaporation, vasodilation and wheezing). Furthermore, significant differences between phenotypic and skin histological traits and correlations between pairs of traits suggested a direction towards heat dissipation processes. In this sense, number of vessels was positively correlated with number of sweat glands (P < 0.001) and both were positively correlated with zebuine genetic content (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively), gland size was positively correlated with epidermal thickness and negatively with hair length (P < 0.05), and epidermal thickness was negatively correlated with gland-epidermis distance (P < 0.0005).

article,Seasonal assessment of mastitis using thermogram analysis in murrah buffaloes,"Gayathri, S. L. and Bhakat, M. and Mohanty, T. K.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Mastitis is a global threat that challenges dairy farmers' economies worldwide. Sub-clinical mastitis (SCM) beholds the lion's share in it, as its visible clinical signs are not evident and are challenging to diagnose. The treatment of intramammary infection (IMI) demands antimicrobial therapy and subsequent milk withdrawal for a week or two. This context requires a non-invasive diagnostic tool like infrared thermography (IRT) to identify mastitis. It can form the basis of precision dairy farming. Therefore, the present study focuses on thermal imaging of the udder and teat quarters of Murrah buffaloes during different seasons to identify SCM and clinical mastitis (CM) cases using the Darvi DTL007 camera. A total of 30-45 lactating Murrah buffalo cows were screened out using IRT regularly throughout the year 2021-22. The IMI was further screened using the California mastitis test. The thermogram analysis revealed a significant difference (p < 0.01) in the mean values of the udder and teat skin surface temperature of Murrah buffaloes between healthy, SCM, and CM during different seasons. The mean values of udder skin surface temperature (USST) during different seasons ranged between 30.28 and 36.81 degrees C, 32.54 to 38.61 degrees C, and 34.32 to 40.02 degrees C among healthy, SCM, and CM-affected quarters. Correspondingly, the mean values of teat skin surface temperature (TSST) were 30.52 to 35.96 degrees C, 32.92 to 37.55 degrees C, and 34.51 to 39.05 degrees C, respectively.

However, most laboratory studies are carried out under constant temperatures and assume a negligible effect from daily fluctuating temperatures. We tested this assumption on multiple fitness traits of the moth Spodoptera littoralis, and a literature review on insects complements this study. Tests on S. littoralis focused on its optimal and maximal critical temperatures by comparing constant and daily fluctuating temperatures (+/- 5 degrees C) at mean temperatures of 25, 29 and 33 degrees C. The nine fitness parameters investigated were influenced by mean temperature. The overall effect was a maximal multiplication rate at 29 degrees C and a marked decrease under the fluctuating regime at 33 degrees C. Effects of fluctuating temperatures differed between mean temperatures. Developmental and larval survival rates at 33 degrees C were lower under the fluctuating thermal regime than under a constant temperature. Our literature review also illustrates that ignoring daily fluctuations based on constant temperatures commonly leads to overestimate fitness traits at high temperatures. Overlooking the experimental bias associated with constant temperatures minimizes the expected impact of climate warming on fitness traits.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103806,119,NA,NA,103806,Fluctuating temperature; Jensen's inequality; Metabolic cost; CTmax; Insects
article,Comparison of models for the relationship between respiration rate or rectal temperature and increased heat load in farm animals,"Brandt, P. and Bjerg, B.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Heat stress is an increasing challenge for production animals, particularly in warmer regions of the world. The aim of this study was to compare the fit of three different relationships when modelling respiration rate (RR) and rectal temperature (RT) in animals exposed to increased load. Data from three published studies on finishing pigs, gestating sows and dairy cows were analysed. RR and RT are characterized by being unaffected by increased heat load as long as it is kept below a certain level, and in warmer conditions they increase with increased heat load. As an expression of heat load either the air temperature or the ET (Effective Temperature) was used. The ET unites the effect of air temperature, air humidity and velocity on the animal perception of increased heat load. The relationship between RR and RT and the temperature or the ET was analysed by multiple change point regression and the cubic relationships were modelled. In general, the models provided better fits for RR compared to RT. Relationships with an unaffected piece followed by a quadratic relationship and the cubic relationships performed nearly equally well. Using ET resulted in better correlations than using temperature alone for gestating sows and dairy cows.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103770,119,NA,NA,103770,Heat stress; Air velocity; Relative humidity; Effective temperature; Broken-line regression

article,Influence of different heat transfer models on therapeutic temperature prediction and heat-induced damage during magnetic hyperthermia,"Tang, Yundong and Wang, Yuesheng and Flesch, Rodolfo C. C. and Jin, Tao",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Magnetic hyperthermia regulates the therapeutic temperature within a specific range to damage malignant cells after exposing the magnetic nanoparticles inside tumor tissue to an alternating magnetic field. The therapeutic temperature of living tissues can be generally predicted using Pennes' bio-heat equation after ignoring both the inhomogeneity of biological structure and the microstructural responses. Although various of the bio-heat transfer models proposed in literature fix these shortages, there is still a lack of a comprehensive report on investigating the discrepancy for different models when applied in the magnetic hyperthermia context. This study compares four different bio-heat equations in terms of the therapeutic temperature distribution and the heat-induced damage situation for a proposed geometric model, which is established based on computed tomography images of a tumor bearing mouse. The therapeutic temperature is also used as an index to evaluate the effect of two key relaxation times for the phase lag behavior on bio-heat transfer. Moreover, this work evaluates the effects of two blood perfusion rates on both the treatment temperature and the cumulative equivalent heating minutes at 43 degrees C. Numerical analysis results reveal that relaxation times for phase-lag behavior as well as the porosity for living tissues directly affect the therapeutic temperature variation and ultimately the thermal damage for the malignant tissue during magnetic hyperthermia. The dual-phase-lag equation can be converted into Pennes' equation and simple-phase-lag equation when relaxation times meet specific conditions during the process of heat transfer. In addition, different blood perfusion rates can result in an amplitude discrepancy for treatment temperature, but this parameter does not change the characteristics of thermal propagation during therapy.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103747,118,NA,NA,103747,Phase lag behavior; Bio-heat transfer; Therapeutic temperature; Blood perfusion rate; Magnetic hyperthermia

Twelve rowers performed preliminary exercise tests (2-km test and five-step incremental lactate test) to assess the target workload intensity corresponding to a 2.5 mmol.L- 1 of {[}Lac]. On two separate days, participants were enrolled in two exercise sessions of 12 km in a rowing machine under HS (-30 degrees C) and thermal comfort (TC 22 degrees C) conditions. Heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), oxygen uptake (VO2), {[}Lac], and the rating of perceptual exertion (RPE) were obtained. From baseline, HS increased the maximum temperature of the face compared to TC. Workload and VO2 reduced while RPE increased at 9- and 12-km of rowing exercise under HS compared to TC. From baseline to the last stage of exercise, HS shifted SV downwards and HR upwards compared to TC. Consequently, CO did not change between thermal conditions (TC vs. HS). Therefore, HS provokes a cardiovascular drift during prolonged rowing in comparison to TC.

The challenge is to use a mechanism dealing with the tumor cells only while keeping healthy tissues unharmed. The aim of this paper is to predict the blood temperature distribution in main dimensions during hyperthermia process by deriving a new analytical solution of unsteady flow that adequately covers the cooling factor. We adopted a separation of variable method to solve the bio-heat transfer problem of unsteady blood flow. The solution is similar to Pennes' equation, except that it is for blood rather than tissue. We also performed computational simulations with varied flow conditions and thermal energy transports. The blood cooling effects were calculated with vessel's diameter, tumor's zone length, pulsating period and flow velocity. The cooling rate rises by around 133\% if the tumor zone's length is extended four times the diameter of 0.5 (mm), but is seemingly fixed with this distance if the diameter is equal or larger than 4 (mm). Likewise, the temporal variations of temperature disappear if the blood vessel has a diameter of 4 (mm) or more.

article,Behavioural adaptation to heat stress: shell lifting of the hermit crab <i>Diogenes deflectomanus</i>,"Leung, Brian Kai Hin and Hui, Tin Yan and Williams, Gray A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Behavioural responses to heat and desiccation stress in ectotherms are crucial for their survival in habitats where environmental temperatures are close to or even exceed their upper thermal limits. During low tide periods when pools in intertidal sediments heat up, a novel shell lifting behaviour (when hermit crabs crawl out of pools and lift up their shells) was observed in the hermit crab, Diogenes deflectomanus, on tropical sandy shores. On-shore measurements revealed that the hermit crabs left pools and lifted their shells predominantly when pool water exceeded 35.4 degrees C. Standing on emersed substrates above the pool water, the hermit crabs maintained their body temperatures at 26 - 29 degrees C, similar to 10 degrees C lower than temperatures at which their physiological performances (as measured using heart rate) reached the maximum. This mismatch between preferred body temperatures and temperatures at maximal physiological performance was also observed under a laboratory controlled thermal gradient, where hermit crabs spent more time at 22 - 26 degrees C as compared to > 30 degrees C. These behaviours suggest a thermoregulatory function of the shell lifting behaviour, where the hermit crabs can avoid further increase in body temperatures when pools heat up during low tide periods. Such a behavioural decision allows the hermit crabs to be less prone to the strong temporal fluctuation in temperatures experienced during emersion periods on thermally dynamic tropical sandy shores.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103476,113,NA,NA,103476,Behavioural thermoregulation; Thermal performance; Thermal preference; Tropical sandy shore; Intertidal ectotherms

MD outputs predicted 0.59 and 0.58 W/mK values for thermal conductivity (TC) of 7SGP at T0 = 300 K and P0 = 1 bar using E and NE methods. Furthermore, computational results represented that the pressure (P) and temperature (T) are significant factors for the TB of 7SGP. Numerically, TC of 7SGP reaches 0.68 W/mK, 0.52 W/mK by T/P increasing. MD results predicted the interaction energy (IE) between 7SGP and aqueous media could fluctuate between-110.64 and 161.53 kcal/mol by the change in T/P after t = 10 ns?These results should be supposed to design new methods for various food industry purposes, such as producing and processing edible oils.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103505,113,NA,NA,103505,Globulin protein; Molecular dynamics simulation; Thermal conductivity; Green-Kubo procedure

Temperature is the main factor that influences the developmental process and success during fish ontogeny. However, the effects of temperature on the utilization of the main biochemical reserves and bioenergetics are scarcely investigated in fish, whereas protein, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism have critical roles in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis. In this context, we aimed to evaluate metabolic fuels (protein, lipids, triacylglicerides, carbohydrates), adenylic nucleotides and derivates (ATP, ADP, AMP, IMP), and the adenylate energy charge (AEC) during embryogenesis and in hatched larvae in S. rivoliana at different temperatures. For this purpose, fertilized eggs were incubated at six constant (20, 22, 24, 26, 28 and 30 degrees C) and two oscillating (21 reversible arrow 29 degrees C) temperatures. Biochemical analyses were made at blastula, optic vesicles, neurula, prehatch and hatch periods. Results indicated that the developmental period had a major influence on the biochemical composition at any temperature regime tested during the incubation. Protein content decreased only at hatching mainly due to the loss of the chorion, total lipids tended to increase at the neurula period and variations in carbohydrates depended on the particular spawn analyzed. Triacylglicerides were a critical egg fuel during hatching. The high AEC during embryogenesis and even in hatched larvae sug-gested an optimal energy balance regulation. The lack of critical biochemical changes from different temperature regimes during embryo development confirmed that this species exhibits a high adaptive capacity in response to constant and fluctuating temperatures. However, the timing of hatching was the most critical period of devel-opment, where biochemical components and energy utilization significantly changed. The oscillating tempera-tures tested may have physiological advantages without detrimental energetic effects that will require further research on larval quality after hatching.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103470,112,NA,NA,103470,Seriola; Embryogenesis; Temperature; ATP; Adenylate energy charge
article,Facial skin temperature and overall thermal sensation of sub-tropically acclimated Chinese subjects in summer,"Tian, Xiaoyu and Xu, Runpu and Liu, Weiwei",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"This study explored the facial skin temperature and thermal sensation of sub-tropically acclimated subjects in summer. We conducted a summer experiment that simulated the common indoor temperatures in Changsha, China. Twenty healthy subjects experienced five exposure conditions: 24, 26, 28, 30 and 32 degrees C with a relative humidity of 60\%. During exposure (140min), the sitting participants documented their thermal sensation, comfort and acceptability of the environment. Their facial skin temperatures were continuously and automati-cally recorded by using iButtons. These facial parts include the forehead, nose, left and right ears, left and right cheeks and chin. The results found that the maximum facial skin temperature difference increased with air temperature reduction. The forehead skin temperature was the highest. Nose skin temperature is lowest when air temperature is not higher than 26 degrees C during summer. Correlation analysis confirmed that the nose is the potential facial part that is most suitable to evaluate thermal sensation. Based on the published winter experiment, we further explored their seasonal effects. The seasonal analysis showed that, compared with winter, thermal sensation is more sensitive to indoor temperature changes and facial skin temperatures were less susceptible to thermal sensation changes in summer. Facial skin temperatures were higher in summer under the same thermal conditions. It suggests that seasonal effects should be considered when facial skin temperature can be used as an important parameter for indoor environment control in the future through monitoring thermal sensation.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103422,112,NA,NA,103422,Facial skin temperature; Thermal sensation; Temperature distribution; Seasonal effect; Thermal sensitivity

Ecto-therms are particularly vulnerable to global warming and, although their limited coping ability has been sug-gested, few real-time evolution experiments have directly accessed their evolutionary potential. Here, we report a long-term experimental evolution study addressing the evolution of Drosophila thermal reaction norms, after similar to 30 generations under different dynamic thermal regimes: fluctuating (daily variation between 15 and 21 degrees C) or warming (daily fluctuation with increases in both thermal mean and variance across generations). We analyzed the evolutionary dynamics of Drosophila subobscura populations as a function of the thermally variable envi-ronments in which they evolved and their distinct background. Our results showed clear differences between the historically differentiated populations: high latitude D. subobscura populations responded to selection, improving their reproductive success at higher temperatures whereas their low latitude counterparts did not. This suggests population variation in the amount of genetic variation available for thermal adaptation, an aspect that needs to be considered to allow for better predictions of future climate change responses.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms involving this process remain unclear. Therefore, two experiments were conducted to investigate the possible protective mechanisms of Mn on primary cultured chick embryonic myocardial cells exposed to heat challenge. In experiment 1, the myocardial cells were exposed to 40 degrees C (normal temperature, NT) and 44 degrees C (high temperature, HT) for 1, 2, 4, 6 or 8 h. In experiment 2, the myocardial cells were preincubated with no Mn supplementation (CON), 1 mmol/L of Mn as the inorganic MnCl2 (iMn) or organic Mn proteinate (oMn) under NT for 48 h, and then continuously incubated under NT or HT for another 2 or 4 h. The results from experiment 1 showed that the myocardial cells incubated for 2 or 4 h had the highest (P < 0.0001) heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) or HSP90 mRNA levels than those incubated for other incubation times under HT. In experiment 2, HT increased (P < 0.05) the heat-shock factor 1 (HSF1) and HSF2 mRNA levels as well as Mn superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) activity of myocardial cells compared with NT. Furthermore, supplemental iMn and oMn increased (P < 0.02) HSF2 mRNA level and MnSOD activity of myocardial cells compared with the CON. Under HT, the HSP70 and HSP90 mRNA levels were lower (P < 0.03) in iMn group than in the CON group, in oMn group than in iMn group; and the MnSOD mRNA and protein levels were higher (P < 0.05) in oMn group than in the CON and iMn groups.

However, the studies on the machine learning model and mean skin temperature (MST), which was based on the analysis of Local Skin Temperatures (LSTs), were insufficient in thermally stratified environments. To create thermally stratified environments in this study, the air temperatures at the lower body parts in a climatic box were controlled independently from the upper body parts exposed in climate chamber, with 12 air temperature combinations of 22, 25, 28, and 31 degrees C. Sixteen human subjects were recruited to collect thermal perceptions and measure their LSTs. The variations of LSTs and the optimal LSTs to estimate MST and predict thermal state were analyzed. Based on the classifications of LSTs and area of local skin, a new method using chest (0.42), forearm (0.21), thigh (0.30), and foot (0.07) was proposed to estimate MST. Its errors decreased by at least 22.8\% as compared to the existing methods. Then, the model based on Random Forest was used to filter the optimal LSTs for the predictions of Thermal Sensation Vote (TSV) and Local Thermal Comfort (LTC). Results showed at least three LSTs were needed to reach a robust model prediction accuracy and generalization ability. The optimal LSTs for the predictions of TSV and LTC were (Forearm, upper arm, foot) and (Forearm, chest, thigh), respectively.

Heat shock proteins are highly conserved molecular chaperones which serve to maintain cellular processes during stress, including thermal extremes. Developing animals may be particularly vulnerable to elevated temperatures, but the relevance of heat shock proteins for developing altricial birds exposed to a thermal stressor has never been investigated. Here, we sought to test whether three stress-induced genes - HSPD1, HSPA2, HSP90AA1 - and two constitutively expressed genes - HSPA8, HSP90B1 - are upregulated in response to acute thermal shock in zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) embryos half-way through incubation. Tested on a gradient from 37.5 degrees C (control) to 45 degrees C, we found that all genes, except HSPD1, were upregulated. However, not all genes initiated upregulation at the same temperature. For all genes, the best fitting model included a correlate of developmental stage that, although it was never significant after multiple-test correction, hints that heat shock protein upregulation might increase through embryonic development. Together, these results show that altricial avian embryos are capable of upregulating a known protective mechanism against thermal stress, and suggest that these highly conserved cellular mecha-nisms may be a vital component of early developmental protection under climate change.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103347,110,NA,NA,103347,Heat shock protein; Heatwave; Gene expression; qPCR; Heat shock response; Development
article,Significant genes in response to low temperature in <i>Fenneropenaeus</i> <i>chinensis</i> screened through multiple transcriptome group comparisons,"Li, Yuqiang and Jin, Yanmei and Wang, Jing and Ji, Guanglei and Zhang, Xiaokui",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Fenneropenaeus chinensis is a migratory marine species with a suitable growth at 18-30 degrees C. To prolong breeding season and reduce mortality in winter, breeding new shrimp varieties with cold tolerance is essential. Genes upregulated and highly expressed at low temperature are reasonable candidate genetic markers for the breeding of cold tolerant strain variants. This study screened genes with these features by comparing multiple low-vs. normal-temperature transcriptome groups. The results showed that nine genes were upregulated and highly expressed at low temperature in more than seven of the nine comparison groups. Six of them were identified as genes encoding transcription factor ATF2, RNA recognition motif domain-containing protein, cytochrome b5-like protein, troponin C, tubulin alpha-1, and 18S/5.8S/28S rRNA, respectively. Cold-inducible upregulations of ATF2, cytochrome b5, and rRNAs were novel findings in this study. The other three novel genes were predicted to encode a membrane-bound extracellular protein and two lncRNAs. Four of the screened genes were verified by real time RT-PCR, and their expression levels were consistent with the sequencing results, demonstrating the accuracy of the transcriptome sequencing data. Function analysis showed that ATF2 might be the master transcription factor regulating the expressions of proteins involved in cellular responses to cold. The other genes played a role in events such as enhancing translation, increasing energy, inhibiting apoptosis, and preserving cell integrity. The expression features of these nine genes suggested that they were of great significance to the cold tolerance of shrimp.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103198,107,NA,NA,103198,Differentially expressed genes; Upregulation; Transcriptome; Cold tolerance; Fenneropenaeus chinensis
article,"DNA damage and repair responses to freezing and anoxia stresses in wood frogs, <i>Rana</i> <i>sylvatica</i>","Lung, Zephanie D. and Storey, Kenneth B.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Wood frogs, Rana sylvatica, endure the freezing of similar to 65\% of total body water while overwintering in cold climates, enduring not only internal ice formation but also long-term anoxia due to cessation of heartbeat and breathing. Thawing restores perfusion but rapid reoxygenation can increase vulnerability to reactive oxygen species and induce oxidative damage. This study provides a first assessment of antioxidant capacity, DNA damage, and DNA repair responses comparing freeze/thaw and anoxia/reoxygenation in liver and skeletal muscle of wood frogs. Oxidation of guanine resides in DNA did not change under either stress but total anti-oxidant capacity rose in both tissues under anoxia. Relative expression of eight proteins involved in double-stranded break repair (Mre11, Rad50, phospho-p95, XLF, DNA ligase IV, XRCC4, Ku70, Rad51) were assessed in both tissues. Freezing suppressed Ku70 and Rad51 in liver and Rad51 in muscle but levels rose again after thawing. Anoxia exposure suppressed XLF, Ku70 and Rad51 proteins in muscle. However, in liver, anoxia exposure led to elevated Mre11, Ku70 and DNA ligase IV, the former two belonging to the MRN complex that binds DNA and marks sites of double stranded breaks (DSBs). Large increases in Mre11 and Ku70 expression suggested DSB damage in liver under anoxia but not during freezing, whereas muscle was resistant to DSB damage under both stresses. These data indicate that DNA damage is minimal during whole body freezing due to tissue and stress specific regulation of antioxidant capacity and DNA damage repair to preserve genomic integrity.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103274,107,NA,NA,103274,Double-stranded break repair; 8-Hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine; Antioxidant capacity; Freeze tolerance; Metabolic rate depression
article,Divergent physiological acclimation responses to warming between two co-occurring salamander species and implications for terrestrial survival,"Messerman, Arianne F. and Turrell, Micah and Leal, Manuel",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Small differences in physiological responses are known to influence demographic rates such as survival. We tested for differences in the physiological acclimation responses of two closely-related salamander species that often co-occur, Ambystoma maculatum and A. opacum. Specifically, we measured changes in critical thermal maxima (CTmax), standard metabolic rates (SMRs), and respiratory surface area water loss (RSAWL) following exposure to three temperature treatments under laboratory conditions. While the magnitude of RSAWL and CTmax acclimation responses to warming did not differ between the study species, SMR was maintained across acclimation temperatures among A. maculatum, but declined among A. opacum acclimated to warmer temperatures. Metabolic compensation may facilitate maintained A. maculatum activity levels during warm periods following the relatively cool spring breeding season. In contrast, metabolic suppression may allow A. opacum to conserve energy when exposed to surface conditions during fall breeding and nest guarding. We simulated how these different SMR responses would likely alter post-metamorphic survival in our study species using previously collected data representing six weeks under relatively warm seminatural conditions. Our simulation indicated that, following warming and under identical study conditions, metabolic compensation may allow juvenile A. maculatum to maintain survival likelihoods, whereas metabolic depression may cause juvenile A. opacum to experience increased survivorship. These findings underscore that comparable physiological responses among ecologically similar, sympatric species cannot be assumed. Further, results of this study suggest that metabolic responses may play an important role in amphibian species persistence as temperatures increase due to habitat modification and climate change.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103228,106,NA,NA,103228,Ambystoma maculatum; Ambystoma opacum; Critical thermal maxima; Evaporative water loss; Metabolic rate; Plasticity

To understand the precise mechanism and the pathways activated by thermal cardiac stress in fish, we sampled cardiac tissue from juvenile turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) exposed to control (14 degrees C) and test (20 degrees C, 24 degrees C, and 28 degrees C) conditions, and performed digital RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). A total of 3359 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. The results of an expression tendency analysis and KEGG annotation analysis of the DEGs demonstrated that energy metabolism played a core role in thermal stress in turbot for the majority of the up-regulated genes. This was followed by lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function, glycolysis, and carbohydrate metabolism. RNA modifications are gaining the interest of biologists worldwide. In this study, at the transcriptome level, our results showed that 246 m6A-containing genes were detected in the DEGs, which were related to EIF3C, EIF3D, EIF3J, METTL16, RBM15B, VIRMA, and YTHDC1. This indicates that m6A is involved in the regulation of heat stress in turbot. This study is an important step towards understanding the cardiac adaptive response to thermal stress.

Acute cold exposure (AC) and waterless duration (WD) represent the two predominate abiotic stressors during waterless live transport of Litopenaeus vannamei. Although previous reports have explored the physiological response of L. vannamei to combined stress AC + WD, the roles of energy metabolism response in regulation of stress tolerance remains unknown. The present study comparatively examined the variations of energy metabolismrelated indicators in hemolymph (cortisol, hemocyanin, glucose and lactate), hepatopancreas and muscle tissues (levels of lactate and glycogen, activities of hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), and ATP levels). Combined stress significantly disturbed the homeostasis of energy metabolism with the increase in levels of hemocyanin, glucose and lactate, and decrease in glycogen and ATP content (P < 0.05). In addition, the activities of HK, PFK, PK, and SDH initially elevated and then decreased with the prolongation of combined stress from 3h to 9h duration, while the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) remained gradual elevation and ATPase activity decreased in a duration time dependent manner throughout the experiment. These alterations revealed that exposure to combined stress could accelerate anaerobic metabolism at initial stage and inhibit aerobic metabolism in a duration time-dependent manner, following with the reduction of energy biosynthesis and the disturbance of energy metabolism equilibrium. On the other hand, the progressive impairment on hepatopancreas tissue was observed under combined stress. In summary, the deficiency of ATP supply and histopathological injures on hepatopancreas tissue might the underlying mechanisms inducing mortality of L. vannamei during live transport.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103149,104,NA,NA,103149,L. vannamei; Live transport; Combined stress; Energy metabolism response; Hepatopancreas impairment

The players were randomly into the sauna group (SG; n = 18; age: 20.69 +/- 2.09 years) and the control group (CG; n = 18; age: 20.23 +/- 1.98 years). All participants performed maximal effort test until exhaustion as well as hamstring flexibility test before and after the acclimation program. Anthropometric, respiratory, circulatory, hematological and physiological variables were evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the survey. Statistical analysis consisted of a Mann-Whitney U test to determine differences between groups at the beginning and at the end of the survey and a Wilcoxon test for paired samples to compare the differences for each group separately. Additionally, size effects of the pre-post acclimation changes were calculated. After the acclimation program SG participants experienced a diminution in body weight (p < 0.01), body mass index (p < 0.01), body fat (p < 0.05) and fat percentage (p < 0.05) decreased. Hamstring flexibility (p < 0.05) and work capacity (p < 0.05) increased. External basal temperature decreased (p < 0.05) as well as post-exercise systolic and diastolic blood pressures (p < 0.05).

H.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"With the current global warming, there is a predicted increase in frequency, intensity and duration of heat waves in future. Little is known of how this could affect the welfare of broiler chickens. Sixty-four broiler chickens were subjected to either high heat stress (HHS; 32 degrees C, 70\% RH for 3 h), moderate heat stress (MHS; 30 degrees C, 70\% RH for 6 h), or normal conditions (NC: 20 degrees C, 50\% RH for 6 h) for two consecutive days. On both days, the temperature-ID chips on all chipped birds were scanned during pre-heat stress (PrHS), end of 3 h (3HS) and 6 h (6HS) of heat stress using a pocket reader. Half of the chip birds' CBT was measured at the end of each hour of heat stress (HS: 1st -3rd hour). Surface body temperatures (SBTs) from under the wing (WT), feet (FT), cloaca (CLT) and comb (CT) were measured. Blood samples, feed intake, daily weight gain and mortality was also monitored. Data was analysed using General Linear Model and simple linear regression. At 3HS, CBT/Delta CBT and all SBTs showed this trend: HHS>MHS>NC (P<0.001). The regression equations to predict Delta CBT in HHS and MHS are Delta CBT = 0.917 + 0.663 h, P<0.05 and Delta CBT = 0.371 + 0.338 h, P<0.05 respectively. Blood pH, pCO2, iCa, HCO3 - and TCO2 showed same trend: HHS, MHS > NC (P<0.05).

The European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) is a temperate species that is generally farmed at 18 degrees C in seawater (SW). In the wild, its incursions in shallow habitats such as lagoons may result in hyperthermal damage despite its high thermal tolerance. Meanwhile, the milkfish (Chanos chanos), a tropical species, is generally reared at 28 degrees C, and in winter, high mortality usually occurs under hypothermal stress such as cold snaps. This study compared changes in hepatic antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, SOD; and catalase, CAT) in these two important marine euryhaline aquaculture species in Europe and Southeast Asia, respectively, under temperature challenge combined with hypo-osmotic (fresh water, FW) stress. After a four-week hyper- or hypo-thermal treatment, hepatic SOD activity was upregulated in both species reared in SW and FW, indicating enhanced oxidative stress in European sea bass and milkfish. The expression profiles of sod isoforms suggested that in milkfish, the increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) was mainly at the cytosol level, leading to increased sod1 expression. In European sea bass, however, no obvious difference was found between the expression of sod isoforms at different temperatures. A lower expression of sod2 was observed in FW compared to SW in the latter species. Moreover, no significant change was observed in the mRNA expression and activity of CAT in the livers of these two species under the different temperature treatments, with the exception of the lower CAT activity in milkfish challenged with SW at 18 degrees C. Taken together, our results indicated that the antioxidant responses were not changed under long-term hypoosmotic challenge but were enhanced during the four-week temperature treatments in livers of both the temperate and tropical euryhaline species.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103016,99,NA,NA,103016,Superoxide dismutase; Catalase; Salinity; Temperature; Euryhaline fish; Liver

Hege and Haugen, Fred",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Proteins secreted from skeletal muscle serving a signalling role have been termed myokines. Many of the myokines are exercise factors, produced and released in response to muscle activity. Cold exposures affecting muscle may occur in recreational, occupational and therapeutic settings. Whether muscle temperature independently affects myokine profile, is still to be elucidated. We hypothesized that manipulating muscle temperature by means of external cooling would change myokine production and release. In the present study we have established new models for cold exposure of muscle in vivo and in vitro where rat hind limb or cultured human myotubes were cooled to 18 degrees C. After a recovery period, muscle tissue, cells and culture media were harvested for further analysis by qPCR and immunoassays. Expression of several myokine genes were significantly increased after cold exposure in both models: in rat muscle, mRNA levels of CCL2 (p = 0.04), VEGFA (p = 0.02), CXCL1 (p = 0.02) and RBM3 (p = 0.02) increased while mRNA levels of IL-6 (p = 0.03) were decreased; in human myotubes, mRNA levels of IL6 (p = 0.01), CXCL8 (p = 0.04), VEGFA (p = 0.03) and CXCL1 (p < 0.01) were significantly increased, as well as intracellular protein levels of IL-8 (CXCL8 gene product; p < 0.01). The corresponding effect on myokine secretion was not observed, on the contrary, IL-8 (p = 0.02) and VEGF (VEGFA gene product) p < 0.01) concentrations in culture media were reduced after cold exposure in vitro.

D. and Bennett, N. C.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Modelling of anthropogenic induced climate suggests more frequent and severe heatwaves in the future, which are likely to result in the mass die-off of several species of organisms. Oxidative stress induced by severe heat stress has previously been associated with a reduction in animal cognitive performance, depressed reproduction and lower life expectancy. Little is known about the non-lethal consequences of species should they survive extreme heat exposure. We investigated the oxidative stress experienced by the Namaqua rock mouse, a nocturnal rodent, using two experimental heat stress protocols, a 6 hour acute heat stress protocol without access to water and a 3-day heatwave simulation with ad libitum water. Oxidative stress was determined in the liver, kidney and brain using malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PC) as markers of oxidative damage, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) as markers of antioxidant defence. Incubator heat stress (heat and dehydration stress) was brought about by increasing the body temperatures of animals to 39-40.8 degrees C for 6 hours. Following incubator heat stress, significantly higher levels of MDA were observed in the liver. Dehydration did not explain the variation in oxidative markers and is likely a combined effect of thermal and dehydration stress. Individual body mass was significantly negatively correlated to kidney SOD and lipid peroxidation. A heatwave was simulated using a temperature cycle that would naturally occur during a heatwave in the species' local habitat, with a maximal ambient temperature of 38 degrees C. Following the simulated heatwave, SOD activity of the kidney demonstrated significantly lowered activity suggesting oxidative stress. Current heat waves in this species have the potential of causing oxidative stress. Heat and dehydration stress following exacerbated temperatures are likely to incur significant oxidative stress in multiple tissues demonstrating the importance of water availability to allow for rehydration to prevent oxidative stress.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102958,98,NA,NA,102958,Oxidative stress; Dehydration; Thermal stress; Climate change; Micaelamys namaquensis

F.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Heat stress is major welfare concern during transport of pigs in tropical climates, which can also lead to direct production costs. This study evaluated the dynamics of heat zones through the load and their relationship with heat stress of weaner pigs during road transport in a tropical climate. Both environmental (e.g. temperature and relative humidity) and physiological (e.g. respiratory frequency and lactate) measures were recorded from four vehicle journeys (70 km distance, 216 weaner pigs within each trailer load) within Ceara, northeastern Brazil. Geostatistics and fluid dynamics simulation techniques were applied to understand the dynamics of heat zones and ventilation patterns the truckload. Statistics based on canonical discriminant analysis and ANOVA were performed to verify the relationship between heat zones and heat stress in pigs. The results showed that, during transport, the generation of heat zones occurred with different magnitudes along the load (P < 0.05), which was harmonized by the ventilation dynamics. There was a heat core with high energy content, in the front region of the lower deck (LD) of the trailer. In this zone, weaners pigs had higher rectal temperature (+1.8 degrees C temperature difference), respiratory frequency (LD = 94 +/- 1.3 breaths/min; UD = 86 +/- 1.3 breaths/min), and blood cortisol concentration (LD = 32.9 +/- 0.8 ng/mL; UD = 30.18 +/- 0.6 ng/mL) (all P < 0.05). Weaners pigs transported in the upper deck (UD) compartments had the highest skin temperature (LD = 38.13 +/- 0.3 degrees C; UD = 38.9 +/- 0.22 degrees C) and the highest mean values of blood lactate (LD = 65.5 +/- 1.11 m/M; UD = 71.60 +/- 1.19 m/M) and Creatine kinase (LD = 3891.23 +/- 69U/L; UD = 4107.43 +/- 62U/L) (P < 0.05). Weaners transported in compartments of the LD of trailer were more susceptible to heat stress, while weaners in the UD compartments were more susceptible to physical stress and muscle exhaustion.

article,Delayed mortality effects of cold fronts during the winter season on <i>Aedes aegypti</i> in a temperate region,"Montini, Pedro and De Majo, Maria Sol and Fischer, Sylvia",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The expansion of the invasive mosquito Aedes aegypti L. (Diptera: Culicidae) towards temperate regions in the Americas is causing concern because of its public health implications. As for other insects, the distribution limits of Ae. aegypti have been suggested to be related to minimum temperatures and to be controlled mainly by cold tolerance. The aim of this study was to assess the daily mortality of immature stages of Ae. aegypti under natural winter conditions in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in relation to preceding thermal conditions. The experiment was performed outdoors, and one cohort of larvae was started each week for 16 weeks, and reared up to the emergence of the adults. Three times a week, larvae, pupae and emerged adults were counted, and these data were used to calculate the daily mortality of larvae, pupae and adults and to analyze their relationship with thermal conditions. The results showed that mortality was generally low, with a few peaks of high mortality after cold front events. The mortality of pupae and larvae showed a higher correlation with the cooling degree hours of previous days than with the minimum, maximum or mean temperatures. Pupae and adults showed to be more vulnerable to low temperatures than larvae. A delay in mortality was observed in relation to the low temperature events, with a proportion of individuals dying in a later stage after the end of the cold front. These results suggest that thermal conditions during cold fronts in Buenos Aires are close to the tolerance limit of the local Ae. aegypti population. The wide range of responses of different individuals suggests that low winter temperatures may constitute a selective force, leading the population to a higher tolerance to low temperatures, which might favor the further expansion of this species towards colder regions.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102808,95,NA,NA,102808,Winter mortality; Low temperature; Yellow fever mosquito; Diptera; Culicidae
article,Does temperature at local scale explain thermal biology patterns of temperate tadpoles?,"Fabian Bonino, Marcelo and Benjamin Cruz, Felix and Gabriela Perotti, Maria",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Most of the literature on temperature-organism interactions rely on mean temperature (mostly air), disregarding the real complexity of this variable. There is a growing consensus about the importance of considering the temperature fluctuations as a mechanism improving organism's performance. Tadpoles are small body size ectotherm organisms that behave isothermally with their environment. As such, are good models for studying their thermal biology relative to their immediate environment. We studied six anuran tadpole species in North Patagonia, Alsodes gargola, Hylorina sylvatica, Batrachyla taeniata, Pleurodema thaul, P. bufoninum and Rhinella spinulosa, distributed in a West-East altitudinal cline with different environments and thermal conditions. We evaluated the relationship between thermal descriptors at a local scale and the thermal biology patterns of these temperate tadpoles. We estimated thermal tolerance limits and thermal sensitivity of locomotion of each species. The different aquatic environments showed important differences in local thermal conditions, associated with observed differences in the thermal traits in these tadpoles. Species exposed to lower temperature fluctuations and lower environmental mean temperatures showed lower swimming optimal temperatures and narrower thermal tolerance ranges. We found greater variability in the upper than in the lower critical limits in these Patagonian anuran tadpoles. Minimum critical temperatures were close to freezing temperature, possibly in detriment of their tolerance to high temperatures. Overall, our results suggest that these species are adapted to low temperatures. Finally, warming tolerances and predicted thermal safety margins, show that none of the studied species appear to be under thermal stress that may compromise their survival at the present time or in the near future, under a moderate climate change scenario.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102744,94,NA,NA,102744,Microclimatic temperature; Thermal physiology; Temperate amphibians; Anuran tadpoles; Patagonia

Ectotherms show proportional (fine-tuned) and all-or-none (abrupt) responses to avoid overheating. Scattered evidence suggests that dehydration alters these behavioral responses and thermal tolerance, but these effects have not been evaluated in an integrative manner. We examined the effects of hydration level on the behavioral thermoregulation and behavioral and physiological thermal limits of the ``bullfrog{''} (Rana catesbeiana), a well-studied and important invasive species. To examine the effects of dehydration on proportional responses, we compared the Preferred Body Temperatures (PBT) of frogs with restricted and unrestricted access to water. To assess the effect of dehydration on all-or-none responses, we measured and compared the Voluntary Thermal Maximum (VTMax) at different hydration levels (100\%, 90\%, 80\% of body weight at complete hydration). Finally, to understand the effect of dehydration on physiological thermal tolerance, we measured the Critical Thermal Maximum (CTMax) of frogs at matched hydration levels. PBT, VTMax, and CTMax all decreased in response to higher dehydration levels. However, bullfrogs changed their PBT more than their VTMax or CTMax in response to dehydration. Moreover, some severely dehydrated individuals did not exhibit a VTMax response.

As a consequence, ectotherms in highly seasonal environments are predicted to have greater thermal plasticity. However, much of our understanding of thermal plasticity comes from controlled experiments in a laboratory setting. Relatively fewer studies investigate thermal plasticity in free-ranging animals living in their natural environment. We investigated the presence of thermal plasticity within a single activity season in adult males of a natural high elevation population of White's skink (Liopholis whitii) in south-eastern Australia. This species lives in a permanent home site (rock crevice and/or burrow), facilitating the repeated capture of the same individuals across the activity season. We monitored the thermal variation across the field site and over the activity season, and tested thermal tolerances and performance of male L. whitii on three occasions across their activity season. Maximum and average temperatures varied across the field site, and temperatures gradually increased across the study period. Evidence of temporal plasticity was identified in the critical thermal minimum and thermal tolerance breadth, but not in the critical thermal maximum. Thermal performance was also found to be plastic, but no temporal patterns were evident. Our temporal plasticity results are consistent which much of the previous literature, but this is one of the first studies to identify these patterns in a free-ranging population. In addition, our results indicate that performance may be more plastic than previous literature suggests.

SB was incorporated at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 g per kg diet and fed to fish for 8 weeks. The obtained results revealed significantly improved growth performance with a decreased feed conversion ratio in the fish fed SB (P < 0.05). In the anterior, middle, and distal parts of the intestine, villus length and width and internal villi distance as well as the number of goblet cells were increased in the fish fed SB (P < 0.05). The blood total protein, hemoglobin, and white and red blood cell counts showed a significant quadratic influence (P < 0.05). The survival rate for Nile tilapia exposed to heat stress for 48 h revealed that the SB fed groups had noticeably higher survival rates. Dietary SB significantly increased the phagocytic index and lysozyme and phagocytic activities both before and after heat stress (P < 0.05). After heat stress, blood glucose decreased significantly with SB feeding at 0.5, 1, or 1.5 g per kg diet, while cortisol was reduced in fish fed 1.5 or 2 g per kg diet (P < 0.05).

M. and Sambucetti, P.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Reproduction is strongly influenced by environmental temperature in insects. At high temperature, mating success could be influenced not only by basal (non-inducible) thermotolerance but also by inducible plastic responses. Here, mating success at high temperature was tested in flies carrying contrasting genotypes of heat resistance in Drosophila melanogaster. The possible heat-hardening effect was tested. Mating success did not differ between heat-resistant and heat-sensitive genotypes when tested both at high (33 degrees C) and benign (25 degrees C) temperature, independently of the heat-hardening status. Importantly, heat-hardening pre-treatment increased in a 70\% the number of matings at 33 degrees C in a mass-mating experiment. Further, mating latency at 33 degrees C was shorter with heat hardening than without it in single-pair assays Heat-hardening had previously been showed to improve short-term thermotolerance in many organisms including Drosophila, and the present results show that heat hardening also improve mating success at elevated temperature. Previous exposures to a mild heat stress improve short-term mating success as a plastic response of ecological relevance. Such heat-hardening effects on mating success should be relevant for predicting potential evolutionary responses to any possible current scenery of global warming, as well as in sterile insect release programs for pest control in elevated temperature environments.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.02.001,80,NA,172-177,NA,Mating success; Thermotolerance; Phenotypic plasticity; Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL); Heat-hardening

Copepods were sampled from pond located near Borok, Yaroslavl region, Russia (58o02'57 `' N; 38o14'56 `' E). The ambient water temperature was 15.0 degrees C. Temperature preference was determined by the ``chronic{''} method. The phenology of development of Th. crassus was observed in the field of water bodies in Central and Volga Federal Districts of Russia. The final thermal preferendum (FTP) achievement occurred with an increase in the preferred temperature: when animals were placed at a temperature in the thermal gradient (14.0-15.0 degrees C) that approximated the temperature of the source pond, they moved to warmer water until they chose FTP (26.7 degrees C). Obtained the values of FTP (25-30 degrees C), temperature of normal performance (21-32 degrees C) and pessimal temperatures of 9-20 and 33 degrees C well coincide with numerous field observations for temperature conditions of development of species in northern waterbodies of Holarctic and with the temperatures at which populations of Th crassus thrive in southern waterbodies of Holarctic and in tropical lakes. It is concluded that, despite the historically long existence of the species in the reservoirs of the temperate dimatic zone, the northern populations of Th. crassus retained the temperature responses characteristic of their southern sister populations. And although the species has adapted to life in northern reservoirs at lower temperatures, when it becomes possible to choose, cyclops prefer temperatures above 25 degrees C, which are optimal for southern populations living in tropical waters.

article,"Long-term hypoxia exposure alters the cardiorespiratory physiology of steelhead trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>), but does not affect their upper thermal tolerance","Motyka, Roman and Norin, Tommy and Petersen, Lene H. and Huggett, Duane B. and Gamperl, A. Kurt",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"It has been suggested that exposure to high temperature or hypoxia may confer tolerance to the other oxygen limited stressor (i.e., `cross-tolerance'). Thus, we investigated if chronic hypoxia-acclimation (> 3 months at 40\% air saturation) improved the steelhead trout's critical thermal maximum (CTMax), or affected key physiological variables that could impact upper thermal tolerance. Neither CTMax (24.7 vs. 25.3 degrees C) itself, nor oxygen consumption ((M) over dot(O2)), haematocrit, blood haemoglobin concentration, or heart rate differed between hypoxia- and normoxia-acclimated trout when acutely warmed. However, the cardiac output (Q) over dot of hypoxia-acclimated fish plateaued earlier compared to normoxia-acclimated fish due to an inability to maintain stroke volume (S-v), and this resulted in a similar to 50\% lower maximum (Q) over dot. Despite this reduced maximum cardiac function, hypoxia-acclimated trout were able to consume more O-2 per volume of blood pumped as evidenced by the equivalent (M) over dot(O2). These results provide additional evidence that long-term hypoxia improves tissue oxygen utilization, and that this compensates for diminished cardiac pumping capacity. The limited S-v in hypoxia-acclimated trout in vivo was not associated with changes in cardiac morphology or in vitro maximum S-v, but the affinity and density of myocardial beta-adrenoreceptors were lower and higher, respectively, than in normoxia-acclimated fish. These data suggest that alterations in ventricular filling dynamics or myocardial contractility constrain cardiac function in hypoxia-acclimated fish at high temperatures. Our results do not support (1) `cross-tolerance' between high temperature and hypoxia when hypoxia is chronic, or (2) that cardiac function is always the determinant of temperature-induced changes in fish (M) over dot(O2), and thus thermal tolerance, as suggested by the oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT) theory.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.03.007,68,"B, SI",149-161,NA,Chronic hypoxia; High temperature; Heart; Blood oxygen carrying capacity; Cardiac function; beta-adrenergic receptors

In the present study, the effects of water temperature on the reproductive performance and offspring quality of rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus) were evaluated by cultured parent fish at different temperature (18 30 degrees C) in a 2-month trial. The results revealed that rare minnows could spawn continuously within the range from 18 degrees C to 30 degrees C, and these at 24 degrees C and 27 degrees C spawned every 3-4 days. Batch size of rare minnow increased with increasing water temperature, while egg production increased with increasing water temperature and then decreased at 30 degrees C. High water temperature (30 degrees C) had significantly adverse effects on fertilization rate and hatching rate (P < 0.05). It was found that the oocyte growth at 18 degrees C, 21 degrees C, and 30 degrees C were slower than those at 24 degrees C and 27 degrees C. Histologic analysis further showed that low temperature (18 degrees C and 21 degrees C) slowed down vitellogenesis and oocyte maturation, while high temperature (30 degrees C) had suppressive effects on oocyte maturation and ovulation.

Twenty-four Jersey heifers were used over a period of 35 days at APTA Brazil. Measurements were performed on all animals, starting with the physiological parameters. Body surface temperature was measured by IRT collecting images in different body regions: left and right eye area, right and left eye, caudal left foreleg, cranial left foreleg, right and left flank, and forehead. High correlations were observed between temperature and humidity index (THI) and right flank, left flank and forehead temperatures (0.85, 0.81, and 0.81, respectively). The IRT variables that exhibited the five highest correlation coefficients in principal component 1 were, in decreasing order: forehead (0.90), right flank (0.87), left flank (0.84), marker 1 caudal left foreleg (0.83), marker 2 caudal left foreleg (0.74).

article,Effect of ambient temperature on evaporative water loss in the subterranean rodent <i>Ctenomys talarum</i>,"Belen Baldo, Maria and Daniel Antenucci, C. and Luna, Facundo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Subterranean rodents face unique thermoregulatory challenges. Evaporative water loss (EWL) is a crucial mechanism for maintaining heat balance in endotherms subjected to heat stress but also leads to potential dehydration. EWL depends on gradients of temperature and humidity between the surface of the individual and the surrounding environment. Underground burrows generally provide a stable water vapor saturated atmosphere which may impede evaporative heat loss (EHL). This will mainly occur when ambient temperature exceeds the upper limit of individual's thermoneutral zone, or when body temperature rises as result of digging activities. Here we evaluate the effect of ambient temperature on EWL and energy metabolism in the subterranean rodent Ctenomys talarum (tuco-tucos), which inhabits sealed burrows, but makes an extensive use of the aboveground environment. We observed that EWL is increased when ambient temperature rises above thermoneutrality; below this point, evaporation remains stable. Though EWL contributes to total heat loss by increasing similar to 1.3 times at 35 degrees C, dry thermal conductance is raised four times. In tuco-tucos' burrows both non-evaporative and, to some extent, evaporative and behavioral mechanisms are essential for body temperature regulation, preventing overheating at high ambient temperatures in a water vapor-saturated atmosphere.

This is often associated with enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to oxidative damage. The commercially important tropical tasar silkworm Antheraea mylitta has to endure high summer temperature before egg production on the onset of monsoon. In this study the status of pro-oxidants and antioxidants was studied in the testes of male pupae of tasar silkworm A. mylitta under thermal stress condition. Further, to find out the impact of temperature on physiological activity, oxygen consumption rate was measured. The result indicated higher level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS, as an index of lipid peroxidation) and total hydroperoxides in the male pupae exposed to high temperature (40 +/- 1 degrees C). Similarly, it was found that increased levels of antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), ascorbic acid (ASA) and low molecular thiols (L-SH) in testes are more prominent in high temperature rather than in moderate temperature (35 +/- 1 degrees C) suggesting the activation of physiological mechanism to scavenge the ROS produced during stress. Further more, the order of higher level of oxygen consumption rate was observed as high temperature (40 +/- 1 degrees C) > moderate temperature (35 +/- 1 degrees C) > control groups (28 +/- 1 degrees C).

Efforts to forecast species vulnerability to climate warming often focus on upper thermal limits threatening survival, overlooking the role of intraspecific variation in determining vulnerability. Using an estuarine fish (black bream, Acanthopagrus butcheri) as a model, we explore how intraspecific variation in body mass and among populations affects upper thermal tolerance. Upper thermal limits were quantified using critical thermal maxima (CTmax) of wild fish. We used a similar to 500 g (mean = 52.4 g, range = 0.57-541 g) mass range to test the relationship between body mass and thermal tolerance. Four distinct black bream populations were chosen along a 5 degrees latitudinal cline to explore population differences in thermal limits. Contrary to expectations, there was no effect of body mass on upper thermal limits. However, significant population differences in thermal tolerance were observed that correlate with mean habitat temperatures. Specifically, the southern population had a significantly lower CTmax (35.57 +/- 0.43 degrees C) compared to northern (36.32 +/- 0.70 degrees C) and mid-latitude (36.36 +/- 1.15 degrees C) populations.

article,Experimental evidence of a Neotropical pest insect moderately tolerant to complete freezing,"Leon-Quinto, Trinidad and Anton-Ruiz, Noelia and Madrigal, Roque and Serna, Arturo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Due to climate change, many regions are experiencing progressively milder winters. Consequently, pest insects from warm regions, particularly those with some tolerance to low temperatures, could expand their geographic range into these traditionally colder regions. The palm borer moth (Paysandisia archon) is a Neotropical insect that in recent decades has reached Europe and Asia as one of the worst pests of palm trees. Little is known about its ability to tolerate moderately cold winters and, therefore, to colonize new areas. In this work, we characterized the cold tolerance of Paysandisia archon by measuring its thermal limits: median lethal-temperature, LT50, chill-coma onset temperature, CTmin, supercooling point, SCP, freezing time and freezing survival. We found that this species was able to survive short periods of complete freezing, with survival rates of 87\% after a 30-min freezing exposure, and 33\% for a 1 h-exposure. It is then a moderately freeze-tolerant species, in contrast to all other lepidopterans native to warm areas, which are freeze-intolerant. Additionally, we investigated whether this insect improved its cold tolerance after either short or long pre-exposure to sub-lethal low temperatures. To that end, we studied potential changes in the main thermo-tolerance parameters and, using X-ray Computed Tomography, also in the morphological components of pretreated animals. We found that short pre-exposures did not imply significant changes in the SCP and CTmin values. In contrast, larvae with long pretreatments improved their survival to both freezing and low temperatures, and required longer times for complete freezing than the other groups. These long-term pre-exposed larvae also presented several morphological changes, including a reduction in water content that probably explained, at least in part, their longer freezing time and higher freezing survival. Our results represent the first cold tolerance characterization of this pest insect, which could be relevant to better design strategies to combat it.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103939,123,NA,NA,103939,Paysandisia archon; Palm pest; Tropical insect; Lepidoptera; Cold tolerance; Water loss

B.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Exercise performed under hot/humid conditions can hinder endurance performance. The OmiusTM headband (OH) is purported to reduce the perception of heat and improve performance. We examined the impact of OH on selected thermal and cardiovascular functions, subjective perceptions and running performance. Using a randomized crossover protocol, 10 trained male athletes (28 +/- 4 years) completed two trials (OH and sham headband (SH), 35.0 +/- 0.3 degrees C, 56 +/- 3\% relative humidity) comprising 70 min of running (60\% V-center dot O2max) followed by a 5-km running time-trial (TT). Heart rate, perceived exertion and whole-body thermal comfort did not significantly differ between conditions during the submaximal running effort and TT. Rectal temperature was higher with OH (0.11 f 0.16 degrees C, p = 0.052) than SH prior to the submaximal running effort, however, no significant differences were observed between conditions regarding the changes in rectal temperature from baseline during the submaximal running effort and TT. Forehead temperature was significantly lower with OH than SH during the submaximal running effort, but no significant differences were observed at the end of the TT. Scores of perceived forehead thermal comfort was only significantly lower with OH than SH during the submaximal running effort. TT performance did not significantly differ between OH (19.8 +/- 1.2 min) and SH (20.2 +/- 1.0 min). In conclusion, OH improves forehead thermal comfort and reduces forehead temperature but not rectal temperature, heart rate and perceived exertion during, nor 5-km TT performance following, 70 min of submaximal running in the heat.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103964,124,NA,NA,103964,Cooling; per-cooling; Heat; Thermoregulation; Performance; Running
article,Exploring the correlation of skin temperature and body composition in athletes undergoing exhaustive physical exercise,"Korman, Pawel and Kusy, Krzysztof and Straburzynska-Lupa, Anna and Sillero-Quintana, Manuel and Zarebska, Ewa and Zielinski, Jacek",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"During strenuous exercise, skin temperature (Tsk) plays an essential role in thermoregulatory processes. As indicated in the literature, its response might be influenced by body composition, among other factors. Hence, the objectives of this investigation were to determine whether there is a correlation between selected body components, specifically fat tissue and muscle tissue, and Tsk during graded exercise and recovery in athletes, and to identify which body component exhibits the strongest correlation with Tsk. Participants were grouped according to their aerobic capacity (VO(2)max/kg). A significant main effect was observed for the test stages (p < .001, eta(2) = 0.71), with Tsk decreasing from the start of the exercise, significantly decreasing at 12 km/h(-1) (p < .001), and then increasing after exercise, especially within the first 5 min of recovery. Weak and non-significant effect for group/stage interaction was detected (p = .374, eta(2) = 0.03). A significant negative correlation was found between Tsk and both total tissue fat {[}\%] (-0.51 < r < -0.63, p < .001) and lower limb tissue fat {[}\%] (-0.50 < r < -0.71, p < .001) across all test stages. The correlation between Tsk and BMI was inconsistent, appearing only during the first stage of exercise and throughout recovery. No correlation was observed between Tsk and skeletal muscle mass, appendicular lean soft tissue, or relative skeletal muscle index. Endurance running to exhaustion leads to a progressive decrease in the Tsk of the lower extremity, followed by rewarming during recovery. The observed inverse correlation between adipose tissue and Tsk, along with the distinct temperature trends in groups with varying levels of fat tissue, could imply that the skin and subcutaneous tissue complex may play a more intricate role in thermal energy exchange beyond its insulating function. This implies a multifaceted involvement of these tissues in thermoregulation.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103918,123,NA,NA,103918,Thermography; Fat tissue; Athletes
article,Are man-made hives valid thermal surrogates for natural honey bee nests (<i>Apis mellifera</i>)?,"Mitchell, Derek Morville",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Honey bees preferentially occupy thick walled tall narrow tree cavities and attach their combs directly to the nest wall, leaving periodic gaps. However, academic research and beekeeping are conducted in squat, thin walled man made hives, with a continuous gap between the combs and the walls and roof. Utilising a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of thermoregulating bees in complete nests in trees and thin walled man made hives, with the average size of tree comb gaps determined from honey bee occupied synthetic tree nests, this research compared the metabolic energy impacts of comb gaps and vertical movement of the thermoregulated brood area. This shows their heat transfer regimes are disparate, including: bee space above combs increases heat loss by up to similar to 70\%; hives, compared to tree nests, require at least 150\% the density of honey bees to arrest convection across the brood area. Tree cavities have a larger vertical freedom, a greater thermal resistance and can make dense clustering redundant. With the thermal environment being critical to honey bees, the magnitude and scope of these differences suggest that some hive based behavioural research needs extra validation to be considered non-anthropogenic, and some bee keeping practices are sub-optimal.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103882,122,NA,NA,103882,CFD; Honey bees; Insulation; Heat transfer; Cluster; Hives

A total of 120 broiler fertilized eggs were randomly divided into three groups: control group, TM group, and comprehensive group (TM + FA), with 40 eggs in each group. The TM group and the comprehensive group from the 7th embryonic age to the 16th embryonic age received TM for ten days, treated with a temperature of 39.5 degrees C and relative humidity of 65\% for 18 h a day. In the comprehensive group, broiler embryos were immersed in FA solution at a concentration of 80 mg/L for 6 min at 16:00 every day from the 6th to the 8th embryo age. They were incubated continuously after being soaked until the chicks hatched. The results showed that the rates of dead embryos and weak chicks in the TM group were significantly higher than those in the control group and comprehensive group. Chick body temperatures of the TM group and comprehensive group were significantly lower than those of the control group. The heart weights of the TM group and comprehensive group were significantly lower than those of the control group, and the leg weights of the TM group were significantly decreased compared with those of the control group and comprehensive group. The SOD activity of serum in the comprehensive group was significantly higher than that in the control group and TM group, while the CAT activity of serum in the comprehensive group and control group was significantly higher than that in the TM group; however, there was no difference between the comprehensive group and control group. The activities of SOD and CAT in the liver were significantly higher than those of the TM group; however, the MDA content of the liver in the comprehensive group and control group was significantly lower than that of the TM group. The gene expression of Nrf2 and SOD in the comprehensive group and TM group was significantly higher than that in the control group; however, there was no significant difference between the comprehensive group and TM group. Soaking broiler embryonic eggs in an FA solution can improve the antioxidant capacity of the liver by upregulating Nrf2-Keap1 signal pathway-related gene expression.

article,Reliability of udder infrared thermography as a non-invasive technology for early detection of sub-clinical mastitis in Sahiwal (<i>Bos indicus</i>) cows under semi-intensive production system,"Satheesan, Lija and Kittur, Priyanka M. and Alhussien, Mohanned Naif and Lal, Gayathri S. and Kamboj, Aarti and Dang, Ajay Kumar",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The present study focused on Sahiwal cows, a prominent milch breed in tropical India, to correlate udder temperature with physiological markers of stress and inflammation during subclinical mastitis (SCM). The primary goal was to assess the potential of udder infrared thermography for the early detection of SCM under the semi-intensive production. Cows were categorized based on milk somatic cell counts (SCC), with healthy (H) cows having SCC <2 x 10(5) cells/mL and no history of mastitis, and cows with subclinical mastitis (SCM) and initial stages of clinical mastitis (CM) having quarter milk SCC of 2-5 x 10(5) and >5 x 10(5) cells/mL, respectively. Firstly, udder thermograms were analysed for udder skin surface temperature (USST), teat skin surface temperature (TSST), and teat apex temperature (TAT) using Fluke software to determine the optimal site for temperature measurement during intramammary infection. Secondly, milk samples were collected for automatic estimation of compositional changes, electrical conductivity, and pH. Thirdly, milk whey was separated for quantifying stress and inflammatory indicators, including cortisol, prolactin, and acute-phase proteins (APPs): milk amyloid A and milk haptoglobin using bovine-specific ELISA kits. Significant increases (p < 0.01) in USST, TSST, TAT, cortisol, and APPs were observed in SCM and CM compared to healthy cows, while prolactin levels decreased (p < 0.01). The correlation matrix revealed strong positive correlations of SCC with USST (r = 0.84, p < 0.01). In ROC analysis, USST demonstrated cut-off values of 37.74 and 39.58 degrees C, with accuracy (p < 0.05) of 98\% for SCM and 95\% for CM, surpassing both TAT and TSST. Therefore, the combination of these non-invasive methods increases the reliability and accuracy of infrared thermography for early detection of SCM, providing valuable insights for the development of a protocol for routine screening and udder health monitoring in indigenous dairy cows.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103838,121,NA,NA,103838,Milk somatic cells; Subclinical mastitis; Thermal imaging; Milk inflammatory markers; Non-invasive
article,Temperature differently affects body pigmentation of the paper wasp Polistes dominula along an urban and a wider geographical gradient,"Ferrari, Andrea and Polidori, Carlo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In insects, different pigments, such as melanins and pterins, are involved in thermoregulation. The degree of melanisation often varies along geographical gradients, according to the so-called thermal melanism hypothesis, i.e. darker forms are found in colder places because they can warm up more quickly. Similarly, pterins work as heat sinks and thus are expected to be more abundant in colder sites. Cities, which are warmer than surrounding areas (Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect), might also be expected to influence pigmentation, although studies are lacking. Here, we sampled workers of the social paper wasp Polistes dominula (Christ, 1791) (Vespidae) across an urbanisation gradient in an Italian metropolis and used iNaturalist pictures of this species across Italy to study pigmentation patterns at both urban and larger geographical scales. We found a lower yellow intensity of abdominal spots at warmer locations. Scanning Electron Microscopy strongly suggested that yellow colouration is due xanthopterin, known to be the heat sink molecule in other social vespids. Thus, wasps from warmer (i.e., urban) environments are likely to have fewer xanthopterin granules, in line with the lack of need for heat storage due to the local thermal gradient (UHI effect). At the country level, we found that wasps at higher latitudes had smaller yellow spots on the thorax and only two spots instead of four at higher altitudes, in full accordance with the thermal melanism hypothesis. In conclusion, climatic conditions seem to affect insect colour patterns both along urban and wider geographical gradients, although colour changes may affect different body parts and pigments likely according to different needs.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103840,121,NA,NA,103840,Melanism; Polistes; Latitude; Altitude; Urbanisation; Urban heat island; Wasp
article,Modification and verification of the PMV model to improve thermal comfort prediction at low pressure,"Zhou, Biyun and Huang, Yuran and Nie, Jiachen and Ding, Li and Sun, Chao and Chen, Bo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The human body's thermal physiology changes due to atmospheric pressure, which significantly impacts the perception of thermal comfort. To quantify this effect, an improved version of the Predicted Mean Vote model (PMVp), was developed in this study to predict human thermal sensation under low atmospheric pressure conditions. The study employed environmental conditions of 0km/26 degrees C, 3km/26 degrees C, 4km/26 degrees C, and 4km/21 degrees C. Thirteen subjects were continuously monitored for exhaled CO2, inhaled O-2, ambient temperature (t(a)), relative humidity (RH), air velocity (V), black globe temperature (t(g)), and altitude (H). The predictive performance of PMVp was evaluated by comparing the experimental results from this study with previous experiments. The findings demonstrate that PMVp exhibits lower root-mean-square errors (RMSE) than the original PMV model. Under the four experimental conditions, the RMSE values for PMVp were 0.311, 0.408, 0.123, and 0.375, while those for PMV were 1.251, 1.367, 1.106, and 1.716, respectively. Specifically, at a temperature range of 21 similar to 27 degrees C (altitude: 941m), the RMSE of PMVp (0.354) was smaller than PMV's. Furthermore, the study analyzed the sensitivity of PMVp to input parameters at an altitude of 4 km. PMVp exhibited considerable sensitivity to the metabolic rate (M) and thermal insulation of clothing (ICL). Consequently, a simple sensitivity scale was established: M>ICL>Ta approximate to V>Tr>H approximate to RH, indicating the relative importance of these parameters in influencing PMVp's response. The research findings provide comprehensive knowledge and a useful reference for developing a standard to design and evaluate indoor thermal environments in the plateau region.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103722,117,NA,NA,103722,Predicted mean vote; Thermal comfort; Low atmospheric pressure; Metabolic rate

The primary objective of this research is to investigate the impact of pulsating blood velocity on heat transfer within biological systems, with a specific focus on blood flow in obstructed arteries. To achieve this goal, a comprehensive 3D model representing a straight, constricted blood vessel has been developed. This model incorporates periodic, unsteady, Newtonian blood flow along with the presence of gold and silver nanoparticles. Leveraging the Finite Element Method (FEM), the Navier-Stokes and energy equations have been rigorously solved. Through the investigation, it is aim to shed light on how alterations in the pulsation rate and the volume fraction of nanoparticles influence both temperature distribution and velocity profiles within the system. The present study findings unequivocally highlight that the behavior of pulsatile nanofluid flow significantly impacts the velocity field and heat transfer performance. However, it is imperative to note that the extent of this influence varies depending on the specific volume fractions involved. Specifically, higher volume fractions of nanofluids correlate with elevated velocities at the center of the vessel and decreased velocities near the vessel walls. This pattern also extends to the temperature distribution and heat flux within the vessel, further underscoring the paramount importance of pulsatile flow dynamics in biomedicine and computational fluid dynamics research.

Twenty-four calves (BW: 221.5 +/- 24.9 kg; age: 162 +/- 4.8 d) were randomly housed in climate-controlled chambers using 3 x 2 factorial design. There were three treatment groups including low energy (LE = 2.53), medium energy (ME = 2.63), and high energy levels (HE = 2.72 Mcal/kg of DM) and two stress levels (threshold: THI = 70-73; severe: THI = 89-91). The calves were adapted to 22 degrees C for 7 days, then to the target THI level for 14 days. Energy intake, average daily gain, and gain to feed ratio were determined to decline (p < 0.05) under severe HS compared with threshold. Under severe HS, rectal temperature was increased 0.67 degrees C compared with threshold. Severe HS increased glycine, ammonia, and 3-methylhistidine concentrations compared with threshold (p < 0.05). Gluconeogenic AAs in the blood were increased among the various energy levels regardless of HS. In PBMCs the expression of HSP70 gene was increased in the LE group (p < 0.05), and the HSP90 gene expression was increased in LE and ME groups (p < 0.05) under severe HS. However, the expression of genes HSP70 and HSP90 in HE group did not differ under severe HS (p > 0.05). It has been suggested that HE intake may have a beneficial effect on PBMCs by mitigating ATP depletion. No differences in growth performance were found when increasing energy intake with high protein (CP 17.5\%) under HS. However, the increase in energy levels resulted in increased gluconeogenic AAs but decreased urea and 3-methylhistidine in blood. In conclusion, increased energy levels are thought to improve HS adaptability by inhibiting muscle degradation and glucose production using gluconeogenic AAs in Korea native calves under HS condition.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103703,117,NA,NA,103703,Energy levels; Growth performance; Heat stress; Korean native beef calves; Stress parameters; Temperature -humidity index

One-hundred and twenty-eight Hisex white hens (42wks) were housed in 4 battery cages (8 pens/cage; 4 hens/pen) and divided into 4 treatments: 1) thermoneutral (TN) environments and a control diet (TNCON), 2) TN and a diet accompanied with BET (TNBET), 3) heat stress (HS) environments and a control diet (HSCON), or 4) HS and a diet accompanied with BET (HSBET). Following acclimation (15d), hens of TNCON and TNBET remained in TN, while HSCON and HSBET hens were subjected to cyclical HS (5d; 16.9-37.5 degrees C). Cyclical HS increased Tr compared with TN hens (1.6 degrees C; P < 0.01), but supplemental BET decreased Tr (0.4 degrees C; P < 0.01). Relative to TN treatments, HS declined egg production, weight, and mass (18, 4.2, and 26\%, respectively; P < 0.01), but BET ameliorated the egg production and mass (13.1 and 16.2\%, respectively; P < 0.01).

article,The effect of short-term exposure to high temperatures on male courtship behaviour and mating success in the fruit fly Drosophila virilis,"Mak, Kwan Wai and Price, Tom A. R. and Dougherty, Liam R.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Human-induced climate change is leading to higher average global temperatures and increasingly extreme weather events. High temperatures can have obvious effects on animal survival, particularly in ectotherms. However, the temperature at which organisms become sterile may be significantly lower than the temperature at which other biological functions are impaired. In the fruit fly Drosophila virilis, males are sterilized at temperatures above 34 \& DEG;C, but are still active and able to mate normally. We investigated the male behavioural changes associated with high-temperature fertility loss. We exposed males to a warming treatment of 34.4 \& DEG;C or 36.6 \& DEG;C for 4 h, and then recorded their mating behaviour after being allowed to recover for 24 h. Previous work in this species suggests that males exposed to 34.4 \& DEG;C lose the ability to produce new sperm, but can utilize mature sperm produced before the heat shock. We therefore predicted that these males would increases their courtship rate, and reduce their choosiness, in order to try to ensure a mating before their remaining mature sperm die. In contrast, over two-thirds of males exposed to 36.6 \& DEG;C are completely sterile. In standard mating trials, earlier exposure to 34.4 \& DEG;C or 36.6 \& DEG;C did not affect male courtship behaviour when compared to control males kept at 23 \& DEG;C. Exposure to high temperatures also did not alter the extent to which males directed courtship toward females of the same species. However, males exposed to 36.6 \& DEG;C were significantly slower to mate, and had a reduced likelihood of mating, when compared to control males. Overall, exposure to high temperatures did not alter male courtship behaviour, but did lower their likelihood of mating. This suggests that females can distinguish between normal and heat-sterilized males before mating, and that female mate choice may at least partly mitigate the population-level consequences of high-temperature induced male sterility in this species.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103701,117,NA,NA,103701,Climate change; Heatwaves; Heat-shock; Male fertility loss; Mating behaviour; Female mate choice; Sexual signalling
article,Developmental heat stress interrupts spermatogenesis inducing early male sterility in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>,"Domenech, Berta Canal and Fricke, Claudia",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Thermal stress leads to fertility reduction, can cause temporal sterility and thus results in fitness loss with severe ecological and evolutionary consequences, e.g., threatening species persistence already at sub-lethal temperatures. For males we here tested which developmental stage is particularly sensitive to heat stress in the model species Drosophila melanogaster. As developmental stages characterize the different steps of sperm development, we could narrow down which particular processes are heat sensitive. We studied early male reproductive ability and, by following recovery dynamics after a move to benign temperatures, we investigated general mechanisms behind a subsequent gain of fertility. We found strong support to suggest that the last steps of spermatogenesis are particularly sensitive to heat stress, as processes occurring during the pupal stage were mostly interrupted, delaying both sperm production and sperm maturation. Moreover, further measurements in the testes and for proxies of sperm availability indicating the onset of adult reproductive capacity matched the expected heatinduced delay in completing spermatogenesis. We discuss these results within the context of how heat stress affects reproductive organ function and the consequences for male reproductive potential.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103589,114,NA,NA,103589,Fertility; Sperm development; Thermal stress; Spermiogenesis; Recovery
article,The time course of acclimation of critical thermal maxima is modulated by the magnitude of temperature change and thermal daily fluctuations,"Turriago, Jorge L. and Tejedo, Miguel and Hoyos, Julio M. and Camacho, Agustin and Bernal, Manuel H.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Plasticity in the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) helps ectotherms survive in variable thermal conditions. Yet, little is known about the environmental mechanisms modulating its time course. We used the larvae of three neotropical anurans (Boana platanera, Engystomops pustulosus and Rhinella horribilis) to test whether the magni-tude of temperature changes and the existence of fluctuations in the thermal environment affected both the amount of change in CTmax and its acclimation rate (i.e., its time course). For that, we transferred tadpoles from a pre-treatment temperature (23 degrees C, constant) to two different water temperatures: mean (28 degrees C) and hot (33 degrees C), crossed with constant and daily fluctuating thermal regimes, and recorded CTmaxvalues, daily during six days. We modeled changes in CTmax as an asymptotic function of time, temperature, and the daily thermal fluctuation. The fitted function provided the asymptotic CTmax value (CTmax \& INFIN;) and CTmax acclimation rate (k). Tadpoles achieved their CTmax \& INFIN; between one and three days. Transferring tadpoles to the hot treatment generated higher CTmax \& INFIN; at earlier times, inducing faster acclimation rates in tadpoles. In contrast, thermal fluctuations equally led to higher CTmax \& INFIN; values but tadpoles required longer times to achieve CTmax \& INFIN; (i.e., slower acclimation rates). These thermal treatments interacted differently with the studied species. In general, the thermal generalist Rhinella horribilis showed the most plastic acclimation rates whereas the ephemeral-pond breeder Engystomops pustulosus, more exposed to heat peaks during larval development, showed less plastic (i.e., canalized) accli-mation rates. Further comparative studies of the time course of CTmax acclimation should help to disentangle the complex interplay between the thermal environment and species ecology, to understand how tadpoles acclimate to heat stress.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103545,114,NA,NA,103545,Acclimation rate; Acclimation temperature; Amphibians; CTmax; Daily thermal fluctuations; Phenotypic plasticity

To determine if thermal imaging from a smartphone attached thermal camera is comparable to thermal imaging using a handheld thermal camera for detection of arthritis in children. Methods: Children without symptoms were enrolled to the ``asymptomatic exercise cohort{''}, and received infrared imaging, using a standard handheld camera, after initial resting period, after activity, and after second resting period. Children seen in the rheumatology clinic with knee pain were enrolled into the ``symptomatic knee pain cohort{''} and received imaging with both the smartphone-attached and handheld cameras before a routine clinical exam. TAWiC was defined as the temperature differences between joint and ipsilateral mid-tibia as the main readout for arthritis detection.Results: The asymptomatic exercise cohort demonstrated notable changes in absolute and TAWiC temperatures collected by thermal imaging after physical activity, and temperatures did not consistently return to pre-activity levels after a second period of rest. The 95th TAWiC from anterior view were, resting one-0.1 C (0.5), activity-0.7 C (0.5), resting two-0.2 C (0.6) (resting 1 vs resting 2, p-value = 0.13). In the symptomatic knee pain cohort, the smartphone attached and handheld thermal cameras performed similarly in regards to detection of joint inflammation and evaluation of joint temperature using the TAWiC algorithm, with high sensitivity of 80\% (55.2-100.0\%) and specificity of 84.2\% (76.0-92.4\%) in the anterior knee view when compared with the gold standard joint exam performed by a pediatric rheumatologist. The mean 95th TAWiC temperature difference between the two cameras was-0.1 C (-0.1 to 0.0) (p = 0.0004).Conclusions: This study showed continued validity of the TAWiC algorithm across two distinct thermal camera platforms and demonstrates promise for improved accessibility and utility of this technology for arthritis detection.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103437,111,NA,NA,103437,Juvenile idiopathic arthritis; Pediatric rheumatology; Knee; Ankle; Thermal imaging; Telemedicine

The purpose of this experiment was to investigate whether betaine protects IEC-6 cells from dysfunction induced by heat stress (HS) through antioxidative mechanism. The IEC-6 cells were divided into four groups: control group incubated at 37 degrees C, while those in heat treated groups (41 degrees C for 24 h) were pretreated with 0, 0.5 and 1 mmol/L betaine, respectively. Cell viability, apoptosis, barrier function protein and oxidative status were analyzed. Compared to control group, the rate of apoptosis and the Bax and caspase-3 expressions significantly increased in HS group (P < 0.05), however, cell activity, total antioxidative capacity (T-AOC), activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the expression of Bcl-2, claudin-1 and occludin decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Betaine (0.5 mmol/L) can significantly enhance IEC-6 cell viability, while significantly reduce the apoptosis rate of cell during HS (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, the expression of Bcl-2, claudin-1 and occludin proteins were also significantly upregulated (P < 0.05) when compared to HS group. HS had a negative impact on IEC-6 cells, while betaine protected from damage caused by HS via increasing the antioxidative ca-pacity. This suggested that betaine might be an effective dietary additive to protect animals from detrimental intestinal reactions caused by HS.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103348,110,NA,NA,103348,Heat stress betaine cell viability apoptosis Bcl-2; occludin
article,Agreement of telemetric temperature capsules ingested 48 hours apart,"Mayer, Thomas A. and Caldwell, Aaron R. and O'Brien, Catherine",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Telemetric temperature capsules are frequently utilized to measure deep body temperature. Whereas most methods to measure temperature are conducted at a single site (e.g., rectal temperature), the location of ingested telemetry capsules varies. If distinct regions of the gastrointestinal tract have different temperatures, the measurements obtained using telemetry capsules will vary accordingly. This study examined the agreement of two telemetric temperature capsules in fifty-seven Army Ranger School students ingested 64 and 16 h before a cool weather waterborne movement. Twenty-one subjects (37\%) (age: 25 +/- 4, weight: 81 +/- 7 kg) retained both capsules. Subjects completed activities that could increase (e.g. exercise) and decrease (e.g. cold water immersion) body temperature. Agreement between the two capsules was assessed through concordance and Bland Altman analysis using a linear mixed model. Bias between the two capsules was low (0.01 degrees C, SE = 0.03, before a neck-deep immersion river crossing and-0.09 degrees C, SE = 0.08, after the river crossing), but there were large differences in the variance components (0.044 vs 0.155 total variance for the pre-crossing vs the post-crossing data). The 95\% Limits of Agreement indicate that discordance between the two capsules was lower before the river crossing (-0.40 to +0.42 degrees C) than after (-0.86 to +0.68 degrees C). In summary, this study examined telemetry capsule agreement with more time between capsule ingestion (48 h) in a larger sample size than most previous studies on the topic, and found notable (95\% LoA > 0.4 degrees C) variability between the two capsules which was exacerbated after crossing a cold river. Differences in gastrointestinal location of telemetry capsules can introduce variability into the measurement of deep body temperature due to regional temperature differences. This variability may be acceptable for some study designs, but unacceptable when small changes in temperature are important to detect. If the convenience of telemetric temperature capsules is desired, an alternative is to use the capsule as a rectal suppository.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103271,108,NA,NA,103271,Core temperature; Gastrointestinal temperature; Thermoregulation; Thermometer; Telemetry; Ingestible

N. and Boon, Mariette R.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Objectives: Although cold exposure is commonly believed to be causally related to acute viral respiratory infections, its effect on the immune system is largely unexplored. In this study, we determined transcript levels of a large panel of immune genes in blood before and after cold exposure. We included both Dutch Europid and Dutch South Asian men to address whether the immune system is differently regulated in the metabolically vulnerable South Asian population. Methods: Fasted blood samples were obtained from nonobese Dutch Europid (n = 11; mean age 26 +/- 3 y) and Dutch South Asian (n = 12; mean age 28 +/- 3 y) men before and directly after short-term (similar to 2.5 h) mild cold exposure. Transcript levels of 144 immune genes were measured using a dual-color reverse transcriptase multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (dcRT-MLPA) assay. Results: Cold exposure acutely upregulated mRNA levels of GNLY (+35\%, P < 0.001) and PRF1 (+45\%, P < 0.001), which encode cytotoxic proteins, and CCL4 (+8\%, P < 0.01) and CCL5 (+5\%, P < 0.05), both proinflammatory chemokines. At thermoneutrality, mRNA levels of four markers of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor (NLR)-family, involved in inflammasomes, were lower in Dutch South Asians compared to Dutch Europids, namely NLRP2 (-57\%, P < 0.05), NLRP7 (-17\%, P < 0.05), NLRP10 (-21\%, P < 0.05), and NLRC4 (-23\%, P < 0.05). Conclusions: Mild cold exposure acutely increases mRNA levels of genes involved in cytotoxicity of immune cells in blood.

article,"Stress history affects heat tolerance in an aquatic ectotherm (Chinook salmon, <i>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</i>)","Rodgers, Essie M. and Isaza, Daniel F. Gomez",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The stress history of an ectotherm may be a pivotal predictor of how they cope with rapid spikes in environmental temperature. An understanding of how stressors in habitats and commercial operations affect ectotherm heat tolerance is urgently required so that management actions can be informed by thermal physiology. We hypothesised that brief exposure to mild stress would heighten tolerance to subsequent heat stress, indicative of a cross-tolerance interaction, whereas exposure to severe stress would reduce heat tolerance, reflecting a cross-susceptibility interaction. To test this hypothesis, we assessed how three acute stressors (salinity shock {[}10 or 33 ppt for 2 h]), air exposure (1 or 5 min) and crowding {[}95.6 kg m(-3) for 2 h]), commonly experienced by fish, affected the heat tolerance (measured as critical thermal maximum, CTMAX) in juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Fish were exposed to one of the three stressors and left for 24 h of recovery prior to measuring CTMAX. Heat tolerance was improved by similar to 0.6 degrees C in fish exposed to salinity shock (10 ppt) and air exposure (5 min) compared to unstressed controls, demonstrating cross-tolerance. However, the development of cross-tolerance was non-linear with stressor severity, and crowding stress had no effect on CTMAX. Together these results show that some forms of stress can heighten acute heat tolerance in ectotherms, but the development of cross-tolerance is highly specific to both stressor type and stressor severity.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103252,106,NA,NA,103252,Critical thermal maximum; CTMAX; Upper thermal limit; Multiple stressors; Fish; Hormesis
article,"The effect of increased ambient temperature on Hsp70, superoxide dismutase, nitric oxide, malondialdehyde, and caspase activity in relation to the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathway of broiler blood cells","Aengwanich, Worapol and Wandee, Jaroon",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The objective of this study was to examine the effect of increased ambient temperature on Hsp70 expression, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA), caspase 8, caspase 9 and caspase 3 in relation to the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathway (IAP and EAP) of broiler blood cells (BBC). BBC were maintained at 42 degrees C and at 5 ranges of temperatures; 42-43, 44-45, 46-47, 48-49, and 50-51 degrees C. Then Hsp70 expression, SOD activity, NO, MDA, activity of caspase 8, caspase 9 and caspase 3, and living and apoptotic BBC were measured. It was found that Hsp70 expression and SOD were increased at 42-43 degrees C (P < 0.05), while the activity of caspase 9 and caspase 3 decreased (P < 0.05). At higher temperatures of 44-45 degrees C, caspase 9 and caspase 3 activities were increased and were higher than at 42 degrees C (P < 0.05). Apoptosis commenced in the temperature range 46-47 degrees C; during this range of temperature, NO increased (P < 0.05), but it decreased at 48-49 degrees C (P < 0.05). At the same time, activity of SOD in BBC was increased, achieving the highest levels (P < 0.05). In addition, activity of caspase 8 and caspase 3 at 48-49 degrees C was higher than that at 42 degrees C, and the apoptotic BBC was increased (P < 0.05). Therefore, temperature effects on BBC could be divided into three phases. The first phase was the temperature at 42 degrees C. The second phase, or pre-apoptotic phase, was in the temperature range from 42 to 45 degrees C. The third phase was the apoptosis phase, which manifested at 46 degrees C and above. These phenomena showed that in the pre-apoptosis phase, Hsp70 suppressed the IAP. On the other hand, in the apoptosis phase, apoptotic BBC is caused by the influence of NO, superoxide and MDA through the EAP.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103211,105,NA,NA,103211,Oxidative stress; Nitric oxide; Caspase activity; Broiler blood cell; Apoptosis; Heat stress

article,Thermal stress induces a positive phenotypic and molecular feedback loop in zebrafish embryos,"Feugere, Lauric and Scott, Victoria F. and Rodriguez-Barucg, Quentin and Beltran-Alvarez, Pedro and Valero, Katharina C. Wollenberg",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Aquatic organisms must cope with both rising and rapidly changing temperatures. These thermal changes can affect numerous traits, from molecular to ecological scales. Biotic stressors are already known to induce the release of chemical cues which trigger behavioural responses in other individuals. In this study, we infer whether fluctuating temperature, as an abiotic stressor, may similarly induce stress-like responses in individuals not directly exposed to the stressor. To test this hypothesis, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed for 24 h to fluctuating thermal stress, to medium in which another embryo was thermally stressed before ({''}stress medium{''}), and to a combination of these. Growth, behaviour, expression of molecular markers, and of whole-embryo cortisol were used to characterise the thermal stress response and its propagation between embryos. Both fluctuating high temperature and stress medium significantly accelerated development, by shifting stressed embryos from segmentation to pharyngula stages, and altered embryonic activity. Importantly, we found that the expression of sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQOR), the antioxidant gene SOD1, and of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) were significantly altered by stress medium. This study illustrates the existence of positive thermal stress feedback loops in zebrafish embryos where heat stress can induce stress-like responses in conspecifics, but which might operate via different molecular pathways. If similar effects also occur under less severe heat stress regimes, this mechanism may be relevant in natural settings as well.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103114,102,NA,NA,103114,Behaviour; Chemical communication; Heat stress; Gene expression; Feedback loop; Zebrafish embryos

Twenty clinically and paraclinically healthy, high yielding and multiparous goats with an average age of 3 +/- 0.5 years and pregnant with a single fetus were included in this study. Sampling was performed at three different physiologic periods: non-pregnancy non-lactation (P1), four-month gestation (P2), and first month of lactation (P3). In this study, the ambient temperature ranged from 19 to 42 degrees C and relative humidity ranged from 14 to 19\% during the hot months. Serum concentrations of ghrelin, glucose (Glu), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), vitamins (A, E and C) and microminerals (selenium, manganese, cobalt, iron, copper and zinc) were measured. Mean raw milk yield of the goats per day at the first month of lactation was 2.34 +/- 0.2 kg. Concentration of ghrelin at P1 was significantly lower than P2 and P3 (P < 0.05). Glucose levels were significantly lower at P3 compared with P1 and P2 (P < 0.05). There were no significant correlations between ghrelin and Glu at different periods. Concentrations of selenium and manganese were significantly higher at P3 compared with P2 and were significantly higher at P2 compared with P1.

However, the effect of cold acclimation on oxidative stress and antioxidant defenses is still not well understood. Here, we investigated the effects of long-term cold exposure (30 days at 4 degrees C in darkness versus 30 days at 20 degrees C in natural light) on the redox state and antioxidant defenses of the high-altitude frog, Nanorana pleskei, indigenous to the Tibetan plateau. We found that cold acclimation, under conditions mimicking winter, led to a significant increase in the ratio of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to its reduced form (GSH) in liver and skeletal muscle tissues, suggesting that cold exposure induced oxidative stress in this species. Furthermore, malondialdehyde (MDA) contents were significantly augmented in heart, liver and muscle, indicating cold-related oxidative damage in these tissues. In the brain, GST activity, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and vitamin C content showed a significant reduction after cold acclimation. In liver, an apparent decrease was also observed in the activities of SOD and GST, as well as T-AOC, whereas CAT and GPX activities showed a prominent increase in cold-acclimated groups. In kidney, there was a significant decrease in most antioxidant enzyme activities except for SOD and GST activity. In skeletal muscle, the activity of SOD, CAT, GR as well as T-AOC significantly decreased but GPX activity showed a significant increase in cold-acclimated frogs. These findings indicate that, in general, cold acclimation induces a suppression of the antioxidant defense system. Overall, our present study systematically describes the responses of antioxidant defenses to long-term cold acclimation and these findings contribute to extending the current understanding of the mechanisms of cold tolerance in high-altitude frogs.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103008,99,NA,NA,103008,Cold acclimation; Nanorana pleskei; Oxidative stress; Antioxidant defense

K. and Yadav, B.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The present study was attempted to identify an appropriate THI model and threshold THI for goats of semi-arid regions of India. Sixty non-pregnant goats each from Jamunapari and Barbari breeds were selected for the study. The study was conducted from last week of February to first week of June, during which average THI ranged between 53 and 92. Pulse rate (PR), respiration rate (RR) and rectal temperature (RT) were recorded at 1430 h on alternate days from six goats of each breed randomly during the experiment. Nine THI models were used to calculate THI. An appropriate THI model was predicted on the basis of correlation between THIs calculated from each model and physiological responses. The data of physiological parameters were linked to the THI calculated from identified THI model and threshold THI for each parameter was determined using segmented regression analysis (SegReg Software). The THI models; THI1\{(1.8 ? Tdb+32)- {[}(0.55?0.0055 ? RH) ? (1.8 ? Tdb- 26.8)]\} and THI8\{(0.8 ? Tdb)+{[}(RH/100) ?

Threshold THIs with respect to PR, RR and RT in Jamunapari goat were 71.78, 75.14 and 85.94, respectively and in Barbari goats, threshold THIs for PR and RR were 79.48 and 84.40, respectively. A threshold THI could not be identified for RT in Barbari goats. It can be concluded that THI1 and THI8 were the appropriate THI models for measuring environmental heat stress in goats.

The mechanisms directing this response are not fully understood. To better characterize the effects of acute heat stress on the innate immune function of rainbow trout, we identified differentially regulated messenger RNA (mRNA) and non-coding RNA (ncRNA) in rainbow trout exposed to acute heat stress. Next-generation RNA sequencing and comprehensive bioinformatics analysis were conducted to characterize the transcriptome profiles, including mRNA, microRNA (miRNA), and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). The head kidney of rainbow trout were exposed to acute heat stress at 22.5 ?C for 24 h. A total of 2605 lncRNAs, 214 miRNAs, and 5608 mRNAs were identified as differentially regulated. Among these expressed genes differentially, 45 lncRNAs and 2 target genes, as well as 38 miRNAs and 14 target genes were significantly enriched in the innate immune response of rainbow trout. LncRNA is used as competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to construct the ceRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction network. Enrichment analysis of the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) of ceRNA, the differentially expressed genes related to the innate immune function of rainbow trout, were significantly enriched in the signaling pathway mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK).

Previous studies investigating the effect of heat waves on activity usually measure animals at different, but constant temperatures, however, rarely are they studied under a natural temperature cycle. General activity, behavioural flexibility and frequency of water drinking counts during a normal day, hot day and a simulated heat wave temperature cycle were studied in the crepuscular four-striped field mouse, Rhabdomys dilectus, and the nocturnal Namaqua rock mouse, Micaelamys namaquensis. Both R. dilectus and M. namaquensis showed typical daily locomotor activity under control conditions. During the heat wave, peak activity times changed for R. dilectus, but both species exhibited higher bouts of activity for the heat wave during the day compared to the control, which was accompanied by an increased amount of time spent drinking water. The increased activity during the heat wave is likely due to enhanced water requirements and potentially a form of behavioural thermoregulation as animals may be uncomfortable and try to move to cooler areas. Thus, in the absence of a typical microclimate, access to water may allow rodents to overcome heat stress from extreme temperatures without having to shift their temporal active times.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102479,87,NA,NA,102479,Rhabdomys dilectus; Micaelamys namaquensis; Activity; Heat wave; Behavioural flexibility; Temperature cycle

During the same period, fish yield increased by 53\%, compared to increases in fishers and boats of 57\% and 55\%, respectively. The resultant Catch per Unit of Effort (CpUE) decreased from 12 kg/net/night to 1.5 kg/net/night. Findings indicate that there are significant correlations between temperature, rainfall (one-year lag), water level and fish yield. Based on the results, there is strong recommendation to incorporate climate variability and change in the modelling of fisheries management to reduce the impacts of climate variability and change on fisheries-based livelihoods.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.06.001,84,NA,45-52,NA,Fishery; Climate variability; Climate change
article,Waitin' on a sunny day: Factors affecting lizard body temperature while hiding from predators,"Sannolo, Marco and Pond, Raquel and Carretero, Miguel A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Most animals face predators in their daily life and have evolved antipredator strategies that promote survival while minimizing escaping costs. For example, many animals often hide into refuges when chased. Ectotherms rely on external sources of heat to raise their body temperature, and thermoregulate to keep their body temperature close to the optimal for performance. For many ectotherms living in temperate areas, it can be expected that they pay a cost in terms of heat loss while staying hidden. Indeed, refuges are often more thermally unsuitable than the external environment. Hence, the aim of this study was to assess if and to what extent hiding may result in a decrease of body temperature in a temperate lizard. We used infrared technology to measure the body temperature of a large-sized lizard (Timon lepidus) before individuals escaped from a simulated predation attempt to hide inside a refuge, and after they emerged back from the refuge. We quantified the change of body temperature that lizards experienced while hiding. Results show that while the decrease in body temperature covaried with the time spent hidden, it was also affected by the initial body temperature. Our key finding is that the time spent hidden depends mostly on the temperature inside the refuge. Indeed, lizards hiding in warmer refuges spent more time hidden, likely benefitting from a reduced cooling rate. This suggests that lizards perceive and evaluate the thermal quality of their refuges and integrate this information to react to predation attempts and minimize the potential thermal consequences of hiding.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.001,84,NA,146-153,NA,Thermal ecology; Refuge use; Thermoregulation; Antipredator behavior; Lacertidae; Timon lepidus
article,Temperature and depth profiles of Chinook salmon and the energetic costs of their long-distance homing migrations,"Keefer, Matthew L. and Clabough, Tami S. and Jepson, Michael A. and Bowerman, Tracy and Caudill, Christopher C.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"River warming poses an existential threat to many Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp) populations. However, temperature-mediated risks to salmon are often complex and addressing them requires species-and population specific data collected over large spatial and temporal scales. In this study, we combined radiotelemetry with archival depth and temperature sensors to collect continuous thermal exposure histories of 21 adult spring-and summer-run Chinook salmon (0. tshawytscha) as they migrated hundreds of kilometers upstream in the Columbia River basin. Salmon thermal histories in impounded reaches of the Columbia and Snake rivers were characterized by low daily temperature variation but frequent and extensive vertical movements. Dives were associated with slightly cooler salmon body temperatures (similar to 0.01 to 0.02 C/m), but there was no evidence for use of cool-water thermal refuges deep in reservoirs or at tributary confluences along the migration route. In tributaries, salmon were constrained to relatively shallow water, and they experienced similar to 2-5 degrees C diel temperature fluctuations. Differences in migration timing and among route-specific thermal regimes resulted in substantial among-individual variation in migration temperature exposure. Bioenergetics models using the collected thermal histories and swim speeds ranging from 1.0 to 1.5 body-lengths/s predicted median energetic costs of similar to 24-40\% (spring-run) and 37-60\% (summer-run) of initial reserves. Median declines in total mass were similar to 16-24\% for spring-run salmon and similar to 19-29\% for summer-run salmon. A simulated + 2 degrees C increase in water temperatures resulted in 4.0\% (spring-run) and 6.3\% (summer-run) more energy used per fish, on average. The biotelemetry data provided remarkable spatial and temporal resolution on thermal exposure. Nonetheless, substantial information gaps remain for the development of robust bioenergetics and climate effects models for adult Chinook salmon.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.12.011,79,NA,155-165,NA,Archival tag; Behavioral thermoregulation; Bioenergetics; Bio-logger; Oncorhynchus; Thermal exposure; ertical movement
article,"Seasonal variation in the thermal biology of a terrestrial toad, <i>Rhinella icterica</i> (Bufonidae), from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest","de Oliveira Anderson, Rodolfo Cesar and Bovo, Rafael Parelli and Andrade, Denis Vieira",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"As ectotherms, amphibians may exhibit changes in their thermal biology associated with spatial and temporal environmental contingencies. However, our knowledge on how amphibian's thermal biology responds to seasonal changes in the environment is restricted to a few species, mostly from temperate regions, in a marked contrast with the high species diversity found in the Neotropics. We investigated whether or not the seasonal variation in climatic parameters from a high-montane ombrophilous forest in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest could lead to concurrent adjustments in the thermal biology of the terrestrial toad Rhinella icterica. We measured active body temperature (T-b) in the field, and preferred body temperature (T-pref) and thermal tolerance (critical thermal minimum, CTmin, and maximum, CTmax) in the laboratory, for toads collected at two distinct seasons: warm/wet and cold/dry. We also measured operative environmental temperatures (T-e) using agar toad models coupled with dataloggers distributed in different microhabitats in the field to estimate accuracy (d(b)) and effectiveness (E) of thermoregulation of the toads for both seasons. Toads had higher T-pref in the warm/wet season compared to the cold/dry season, even though no seasonal change occurred in field T-b's. In the warm/wet season, toads decreased the accuracy of thermoregulation and avoided thermally favorable microhabitats, while in the cold/dry season they increased the accuracy of thermoregulation and exhibited high degree of thermo-conformity. This result may encompass thermoregulatory adjustments to seasonal changes in T-c's, but may also reflect seasonal differences in compromises between T-b regulation and other ecologically relevant activities (reproduction, foraging). Toads did not exhibit changes in CTmin or CTmax, which indicates a low risk of exposure to extreme temperatures in this particular habitat, at both seasons, possibly combined with a low flexibility of this trait. Overall, our study shows seasonal acclimatization in some aspects of the thermal biology of the toad, R. icterica.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.03.011,74,NA,77-83,NA,Anurans; Operative environmental temperatures; Seasonal acclimatization; Preferred body temperature; Thermal tolerance; Thermoregulatory behavior
article,The influence of lifestyle and swimming behavior on metabolic rate and thermal tolerance of twelve Amazon forest stream fish species,"Campos, D. F. and Val, A. L. and Almeida-Val, V. M. F.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The metabolism of fishes is profoundly affected by environmental factors such as temperature, oxygen concentration, and pH levels. Also, biotic elements, for instance, activity levels of species, have been suggested to affect the energy demand, driving their capacity to support environmental challenges. The present work aims to investigate the effects of the lifestyle and swimming activities levels of fishes living in Amazon forest stream on the aerobic metabolism and thermal tolerance. Intermittent flow respirometry was used to measure routine metabolic rate and thermal maximum metabolic rate with a thermal ramp methodology. Critical thermal tolerance, thermal aerobic scope, and thermal factorial aerobic scope were calculated for twelve species belonging to different families. Our findings showed a correlation between routine and thermal maximum metabolic rate and, between metabolic rate and activity levels. Species belonging to Characidae and Crenuchidae families have high resting metabolic rates, which decrease their factorial aerobic scope and reduce their abilities to cope with warming events. Therefore, these species have low thermal tolerance. Instead, species from families Rivulidae and Cichlidae showed opposite metabolic results and larger thermal windows. We hypothesize that these responses are related to an evolutionary trade-off between lifestyle and energetic requirements and warming will favor species with low activity performance.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.02.002,72,NA,148-154,NA,Tropical fishes; Factorial aerobic scope; Lifestyle; Stenothermal
article,The thermal environment of the nest affects body and cell size in the solitary red mason bee (<i>Osmia bicornis</i> L.),"Kierat, Justyna and Szentgyorgyi, Hajnalka and Czarnoleski, Marcin and Woyciechowski, Michal",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Many ectotherms grow larger at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures. This pattern, known as the temperature-size rule, is often accompanied by plastic changes in cell size, which can mechanistically explain the thermal dependence of body size. However, the theory predicts that thermal plasticity in cell size has adaptive value for ectotherms because there are different optimal cell-membrane-to-cell-volume ratios at different temperatures. At high temperatures, the demand for oxygen is high; therefore, a large membrane surface of small cells is beneficial because it allows high rates of oxygen transport into the cell. The metabolic costs of maintaining membranes become more important at low temperatures than at high temperatures, which favours large cells. In a field experiment, we manipulated the thermal conditions inside nests of the red mason bee, a solitary bee that does not regulate the temperature in its nests and whose larvae develop under ambient conditions. We assessed the effect of temperature on body mass and ommatidia size (our proxy of cell size). The body and cell sizes decreased in response to a higher mean temperature and greater temperature fluctuations. This finding is in accordance with predictions of the temperature-size rule and optimal cell size theory and suggests that both the mean temperature and the magnitude of temperature fluctuations are important for determining body and cell sizes. Additionally, we observed that males of the red mason bee tend to have larger ommatidia in relation to their body mass than females, which might play an important role during mating flight.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.11.008,68,A,39-44,NA,Cell size; Developmental conditions; Temperature-size rule; Theory of optimal cell size; Osmia bicornis
article,Sexual differences in behavioral thermoregulation of the lizard <i>Scelarcis perspicillata</i>,"Ortega, Zaida and Mencia, Abraham and Perez-Mellado, Valentin",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature determines all aspects of the biology of ectotherms. Although sexual differences in thermal ecology are not the rule in lizards, some species exhibit such differences. We studied the effect of sex and reproductive condition on the thermoregulation of an introduced population of Scelarcis perspicillata during the summer in Menorca (Balearic Islands, Spain). These lizards live in the wall surfaces of a limestone quarry, where the sun is scarce because of the narrowness of the quarry walls. The population is sexually dimorphic, with larger males than females. We measured body temperature (T-b) of adult males and females in the field, and air (T-a) and substrate temperature (T-s) at the capture sites, and recorded exposure to sunlight, height of the perch, and type of substrate. We also recorded operative temperatures (T-e) as a null hypothesis of thermoregulation. Finally, we studied the thermal preferences of adult males and females in a laboratory thermal gradient. Thermal preferences were similar for pregnant and non-pregnant females, and sex did not affect the thermal preferences of lizards, even after controlling for the effect of body size. However, in the field, females achieved higher T-b than males, and occupied microhabitats with higher T-a and T-s and lower perch heights than males. Furthermore, females selected perches in full sun at a higher frequency than males. As a consequence, females achieved a higher accuracy and effectiveness of thermoregulation (0.89) than males (0.84). Thus, all else being equal, females would achieve a higher performance than males. The observed results are attributable to sexual differences in behaviour, probably in relation with the reproductive season. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

article,The effect of water temperature and velocity on barnacle growth: Quantifying the impact of multiple environmental stressors,"Nishizaki, Michael T. and Carrington, Emily",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Organisms employ a wide array of physiological and behavioral responses in an effort to endure stressful environmental conditions. For many marine invertebrates, physiological and/or behavioral performance is dependent on physical conditions in the fluid environment. Although factors such as water temperature and velocity can elicit changes in respiration and feeding, the manner in which these processes integrate to shape growth remains unclear. In a growth experiment, juvenile barnacles (Balanus glandula) were raised in dockside, once-through flow chambers at water velocities of 2 versus 19 cm s(-1) and temperatures of 11.5 versus 14 degrees C. Over 37 days, growth rates (i.e., shell basal area) increased with faster water velocities and higher temperatures. Barnacles at high flows had shorter feeding appendages (i.e., cirri), suggesting that growth patterns are unlikely related to plastic responses in cirral length. A separate experiment in the field confirmed patterns of temperature- and flow-dependent growth over 41 days. Outplanted juvenile barnacles exposed to the faster water velocities (32 +/- 1 and 34 +/- 1 cm s(-1); mean +/- SE) and warm temperatures (16.81 +/- 0.05 degrees C) experienced higher growth compared to individuals at low velocities (1 +/- 1 cm s(-1)) and temperatures (13.67 +/- 0.02 degrees C). Growth data were consistent with estimates from a simple energy budget model based on previously measured feeding and respiration response curves that predicted peak growth at moderate temperatures (15 degrees C) and velocities (20-30 cm s(-1)). Low growth is expected at both low and high velocities due to lower encounter rates with suspended food particles and lower capture efficiencies respectively. At high temperatures, growth is likely limited by high metabolic costs, whereas slow growth at low temperatures may be a consequence of low oxygen availability and/or slow cirral beating and low feeding rates. Moreover, these results advocate for approaches that consider the combined effects of multiple stressors and suggest that both increases and decreases in temperature or flow impact barnacle growth, but through different physiological and behavioral mechanisms.

article,Effects of overwintering temperature on the survival of the black garden ant (<i>Lasius niger</i>),"Haatanen, Marja-Katariina and van Ooik, Tapio and Sorvari, Jouni",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The overwintering temperatures of ants might well be elevated due to climate change. We studied whether the overwintering temperature affects the survival of the queens and whole colonies of the black garden ant, Lasius niger (Linnaeus, 1758). In two consecutive years (2009, 2010) we collected mated, colony founding queens (n=280) from the urban area of Turku, Finland. Half of the queens overwintered in +7 to +8 degrees C and the other half in +2 degrees C. After the overwintering period, we determined their survival rate and measured the body fat content, body size and immune defence (encapsulation rate) of overwintering queens. Using the same setup, we studied the survival of 1-year-old L niger colonies (queen \& workers). Overwintering at a lower temperature (+2 degrees C) decreased the survival of workers. The survival of colony founding queens differed between years, but unlike with workers, the overwintering temperature did not affect their survival: neither in the colony experiment nor in the single queen experiment. All of the surviving queens managed to produce their worker offspring at the same rate. The relative amount of body fat of queens was higher for those who overwintered at a lower temperature, which is likely a result of lower energy consumption. We did not detect differences in the encapsulation rate between the temperature treatment groups. The ability of colony founding queens to tolerate wide overwintering temperature variations present in urban environments may explain the success of the colony in urban areas. As the colony grows, the overwintering chambers may extend more deeply into the ground. Thus, workers may not have to cope with such cold conditions as colony founding queens. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Thermal effect of blood feeding in the telmophagous fly <i>Glossina morsitans morsitans</i>,"Lahondere, Chloe and Lazzari, Claudio R.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"During feeding on warm-blooded hosts, haematophagous insects are exposed to thermal stress due to the ingestion of a meal which temperature may highly exceed their own body temperature. In order to avoid overheating and its subsequent deleterious effects, these insects respond by setting up molecular protective mechanisms such as heat shock proteins synthesis or by using thermoregulative strategies. Moreover, the duration of contact with the host depends on the way of feeding displayed by the different species (either telmophagous or solenophagous) and thus also impacts their exposure to heat. Solenophagous insects feed directly on blood vessels and are relatively slow feeders while telmophagous insects by lacerating capillaries, facilitate their access to blood and thus feed more quickly. The aim of this work was to investigate to what extent strictly telmophagous insects such as tsetse flies are exposed to thermal stress during feeding and consequently to evaluate the impact of the feeding strategy on the exposition to overheating in haematophagous insects in general. Real time thermographic analysis during feeding revealed that the flies' body significantly heat up quite homogeneously. At the end of feeding, however, a marked regional heterothermy occurs as a consequence of the alary muscles warm up that precedes take-off. Feeding strategies, either solenophagy or telmophagy, thus appear to have a great impact on both exposition to predation risks and to thermal stress. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Upper thermal tolerance plasticity in tropical amphibian species from contrasting habitats: Implications for warming impact prediction,"Simon, Monique Nouailhetas and Ribeiro, Pedro Leite and Navas, Carlos Arturo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Tropical ectothermic species are currently depicted as more vulnerable to increasing temperatures because of the proximity between their upper thermal limits and environmental temperatures. Yet, the acclimatory capacity of thermal limits has rarely been measured in tropical species, even though they are generally predicted to be smaller than in temperate species. We compared critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and warming tolerance (WT: the difference between CTmax and maximum temperature, T-max), as well as CTmax acclimatory capacity of toad species from the Atlantic forest (AF) and the Brazilian Caatinga (CAA), a semi-arid habitat with high temperatures. Acclimation temperatures represented the mean temperatures of AF and CAA habitats, making estimates of CTmax and WT more ecologically realistic. CAA species mean CTmax was higher compared to AF species in both acclimation treatments. Clutches within species, as well as between AF and CAA species, differed in CTmax plasticity and we discuss the potential biological meaning of these findings. We did not find a trade-off between absolute CTmax and CTmax plasticity, indicating that species can have both high CTmax and high CTmax a plasticity. Although CTmax was highly correlated to T-max, CTmax plasticity was not related to T-max or T-max coefficients of variation. CAA species mean WT was lower than for AF species, but still very high for all species, diverging from other studies with tropical species. This might be partially related to over-estimation of vulnerability due to under-appreciation of realistic acclimation treatments in CTmax estimation. Thus, some tropical species might not be as vulnerable to warming as previously predicted if CTmax is considered as a shifting population parameter. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Thermal tolerance plasticity and dynamics of thermal tolerance in Eublepharis macularius: Implications for future climate-driven heat stress,"White, Emma and Kim, Solyip and Wegh, Garrett and Chiari, Ylenia",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The intensity and duration of heat waves, as well as average global temperatures, are expected to increase due to climate change. Heat waves can cause physiological stress and reduce fitness in animals. Species can reduce overheating risk through phenotypic plasticity, which allows them to raise their thermal tolerance limits over time. This mechanism could be important for ectotherms whose body temperatures are directly influenced by available environmental temperatures. Geckos are a large, diverse group of ectotherms that vary in their thermal habitats and times of daily activity, which could affect how they physiologically adjust to heat waves. Data on thermal physiology are scarce for reptiles, with only one study in geckos. Understanding thermal tolerance and plasticity, and their relationship, is essential for understanding how some species are able to adjust or adapt to changing temperatures. In this study, we estimated thermal tolerance and plasticity, and their interaction, in the crepuscular gecko, Eublepharis macularius, a species that is emerging as a model for reptile biology. After estimating basal thermal tolerance for 28 geckos, thermal tolerance was measured for each individual a second time at several timepoints (3, 6, or 24 h) to determine thermal tolerance plasticity. We found that thermal tolerance plasticity (1) does not depend on the basal thermal tolerance of the organism, (2) was highest after 6 h from initial heat shock, and (3) was negatively influenced by individual body mass.

article,Behavioral plasticity during acute heat stress: heat hardening increases the expression of boldness,"Goerge, Tyler M. and Miles, Donald B.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Climate change is creating novel thermal environments via rising temperatures and increased frequency of severe weather events. Short-term phenotypic adjustments, i.e., phenotypic plasticity, may facilitate species persistence during adverse environmental conditions. A plastic response that increases thermal tolerance is heat hardening, which buffers organisms from extreme heat and may enhance short term survival. However, heat hardening responses may incur a cost with concomitant decreases in thermal preference and physiological performance. Thus, phenotypic shifts accompanying a hardening response may be maladaptive in warming climates. Understanding how heat hardening influences other traits associated with fitness and survival will clarify its potential as an adaptive response to altered thermal niches. Here, we studied the effects of heat hardening on boldness behavior in the color polymorphic tree lizard, Urosaurus ornatus. Boldness in lizards influences traits such as territory maintenance, mating success, and survivorship and is repeatable in U. ornatus. We found that when lizards underwent a heat hardening response, boldness expression significantly increased. This trend was driven by males. Bolder individuals also exhibited lower field active body temperatures. This behavioral response to heat hardening may increase resource holding potential and territoriality in stressful environments but may also increase predation risk. This study highlights the need to detail associated phenotypic shifts with stress responses to fully understand their adaptive potential in rapidly changing environments.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103778,119,NA,NA,103778,Boldness behavior; Climate change; Heat hardening; Lizard; Phenotypic plasticity

K. and Head, Alyssa and Miles, Monica and Pettit, Ciara and Watson, Charles M. and Wuthrich, Kelly L. and Logan, Michael L.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Predicting ecological responses to rapid environmental change has become one of the greatest challenges of modern biology. One of the major hurdles in forecasting these responses is accurately quantifying the thermal environments that organisms experience. The distribution of temperatures available within an organism's habitat is typically measured using data loggers called operative temperature models (OTMs) that are designed to mimic certain properties of heat exchange in the focal organism. The gold standard for OTM construction in studies of terrestrial ectotherms has been the use of copper electroforming which creates anatomically accurate models that equilibrate quickly to ambient thermal conditions. However, electroformed models require the use of caustic chemicals, are often brittle, and their production is expensive and time intensive. This has resulted in many researchers resorting to the use of simplified OTMs that can yield substantial measurement errors. 3D printing offers the prospect of robust, easily replicated, morphologically accurate, and cost-effective OTMs that capture the benefits but alleviate the problems associated with electroforming. Here, we validate the use of OTMs that were 3D printed using several materials across eight lizard species of different body sizes and living in habitats ranging from deserts to tropical forests. We show that 3D printed OTMs have low thermal inertia and predict the live animal's equilibration temperature with high accuracy across a wide range of body sizes and microhabitats. Finally, we developed a free online repository and database of 3D scans (https://www.3dotm.org/) to increase the accessibility of this tool to researchers around the world and facilitate ease of production of 3D printed models. 3D printing of OTMs is generalizable to taxa beyond lizards.

article,High temperature sensitivity of bumblebee castes and the colony-level costs of thermoregulation in Bombus impatiens,"Bretzlaff, Tiffany and Kerr, Jeremy T. and Darveau, Charles-A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Physiological thermal limits often reflect species distribution, but the role that ambient temperature (Ta) plays in limiting species within their thermal environment remains unclear. Climate change-linked declines in bumblebees, an important pollinator group, leave questions regarding which aspect of their physiology is hindered under high Ta. As a eusocial species, bumblebees utilize their ability to thermoregulate as a superorganism to maintain nest temperature (Tn) within a narrow thermal window to buffer developing larvae from developmental defects. Thermoregulatory behaviours, such as thermogenesis to warm up and fanning to cool down the nest, are energetically expensive and it is uncertain how successful large colonies are at maintaining Tn within its optimal range. Using a common bumblebee species, Bombus impatiens, our study first established the critical thermal limits (CTmax) of workers, queens, drones and larvae to determine which caste is most thermally sensitive to heat. We found that larvae had significantly lower heat tolerance than adults, highlighting the importance of colonial thermoregulation. We then measured the energy expenditure of large colonies under acute thermal stress (5-40 degrees C) using flow-through respirometry while simultaneously quantifying Tn. Colonies that experienced Ta at or below optimal Tn (<= 30 degrees C) were successful at thermoregulation. At 35 degrees C and above, however, Tn increased despite high energetic costs to the colony. Together our results demonstrate that high Ta poses a risk to colonies that fail to buffer thermally sensitive larvae from changes in Tn.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103710,117,NA,NA,103710,Heat tolerance; Bumblebee; Castes; Thermoregulation; Colony; Bombus; Metabolic rate

However, it has limited application in describing the temporal dynamic and cumulative impacts of extreme temperatures. Here, we used a thermal tolerance landscape approach to address the impacts of extreme thermal events on the survival of co-existing aphid species (Metopolophium dirhodum, Sitobion avenae and Rhopalosiphum padi). Specifically, we built the thermal death time (TDT) models based on detailed survival datasets of three aphid species with three ages across a broad range of stressful high (34-40 degrees C) and low (-3 similar to-11 degrees C) temperatures to compare the interspecific and developmental stage variations in thermal tolerance. Using these TDT parameters, we performed a thermal risk assessment by calculating the potential daily thermal injury accumulation associated with the regional temperature variations in three wheat-growing sites along a latitude gradient. Results showed that M. dirhodum was the most vulnerable to heat but more tolerant to low temperatures than R. padi and S. avenae. R. padi survived better at high temperatures than Sitobion avenae and M. dirhodum but was sensitive to cold. R. padi was estimated to accumulate higher cold injury than the other two species during winter, while M. dirhodum accrued more heat injury during summer. The warmer site had higher risks of heat injury and the cooler site had higher risks of cold injury along a latitude gradient. These results support recent field observations that the proportion of R. padi increases with the increased frequency of heat waves. We also found that young nymphs generally had a lower thermal tolerance than old nymphs or adults. Our results provide a useful dataset and method for modelling and predicting the consequence of climate change on the population dynamics and community structure of small insects.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103583,114,NA,NA,103583,Extreme temperature; Thermal death time curve; Cereal aphids; Sitobion avenae; Rhopalosiphum padi; Metopolophium dirhodum

Stress tests are frequently employed to expose early signs of cardiovascular dysfunction or disease and can be employed, for example, in the context of preterm birth. We aimed to establish a safe and effective thermal stress test to examine cardiovascular function. Guinea pigs were anaesthetized using a 0.8\% isoflurane, 70\% N2O mix. ECG, non-invasive blood pressure, laser Doppler flowmetry, respiratory rate, and an array of skin and rectal thermistors were applied. A physiologically relevant heating and a cooling thermal stress test was developed. Upper and lower thermal limits for core body temperature were set at 41.5 OC and 34 OC, for the safe recovery of animals.

article,Heat stress disrupts spermatogenesis via modulation of sperm-specific calcium channels in rats,"Abd El-Emam, Mahran Mohamed and Ray, Manobendro Nath and Ozono, Mizune and Kogure, Kentaro",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Heat is a detrimental environmental stressor that disrupts spermatogenesis and results in male infertility. Pre-vious investigations have shown that heat stress reduces the motility, number, and fertilization ability of living spermatozoa. Sperm hyperactivation, capacitation, acrosomal reaction, and chemotaxis towards the ova are regulated by the cation channel of sperm (CatSper). This sperm-specific ion channel triggers the influx of calcium ions into sperm cells. The aim of this study in rats was to investigate whether heat treatment affected the expression levels of CatSper-1 and-2, together with the sperm parameters, testicular histology and weight. The rats were exposed to heat stress for 6 days and the cauda epididymis and testis were collected 1, 14, and 35 days after heat treatment to measure sperm parameters, gene and protein expression, testicular weight, and histology. Interestingly, we found that heat treatment caused a notable downregulation of CatSper-1 and-2 expression at all three time points. In addition, there were significant reductions in sperm motility and number and an increase in the percentage of abnormal sperm at 1 and 14 days, with cessation of sperm production at 35 days. Furthermore, expression of the steroidogenesis regulator, 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD) was upregulated in the 1-, 14-and 35-day samples. Heat treatment also upregulated the expression of the apoptosis regulator, BCL2-associated X protein (BAX), decreased testicular weight, and altered testicular histology. Therefore, our data showed for the first time that heat stress downregulated CatSper-1 and-2 in the rat testis, and that this may be a mechanism involved in heat stress-induced impairment of spermatogenesis.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103465,112,NA,NA,103465,CatSper; Heat stress; Rats; Spermatogenesis

Spatial and temporal differences in the thermal environment across a species' range may result in changes in thermal preferences between populations of that species. Alternatively, thermoregulatory-based microhabitat selection can allow individuals to maintain similar body temperatures across a broad thermal gradient. Which strategy a species adopts is often dependent on taxon-specific levels of physiological conservatism or ecological context. Identifying which strategies species use in response to spatial and temporal variation in environmental temperatures requires empirical evidence, which then can support predictions as to how a species might respond to a changing climate. Here we present findings of our analyses of the thermal quality, thermoregulatory ac-curacy and efficiency for the lizard, Xenosaurus fractus, across an elevation-thermal gradient and over the tem-poral thermal variation associated with seasonal changes. Xenosaurus fractus is a strict crevice-dweller, a habitat that can buffer this lizard from extreme temperatures and is a thermal conformer (body temperatures reflect air and substrate temperatures). We found populations of this species differed in their thermal preferences along an elevation gradient and between seasons. Specifically, we found that habitat thermal quality, thermoregulatory accuracy and efficiency (all measures of how well the lizards' body temperatures compared to their preferred body temperatures) varied along thermal gradients and with season. Our findings indicate that this species has adapted to local conditions and shows seasonal flexibility in those spatial adaptations. Along with their strict crevice-dwelling habitat, these adaptations may provide some protection against a warming climate.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103432,112,NA,NA,103432,Eurythermic; Physiological ecology; Microclimate; Spatio-temporal scale; Thermoconformer; Thermoregulatory efficiency
article,Egg cooling associated with nest size in a passerine bird,"Lambrechts, Marcel M. and Caro, Samuel P.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Breeders evolved adaptive responses to rapid changes in ambient temperature. In birds, nests are expected to reduce egg cooling when the incubator is temporarily off the eggs. Here we present the results of two comple-mentary laboratory experiments aiming at testing the association between egg cooling and the thickness of the nest under and surrounding the eggs in a non-domesticated avian model species (great tit, Parus major). To simulate incubation behaviour, we exposed nests with 4-egg clutches to a heat source until the eggs reached a normal incubation temperature (ca. 39 degrees C) and then recorded egg cooling 8 min after removal of the heat source, which corresponds to the time females generally leave eggs unattended during the incubation period. Eggs cooled more quickly when the nest layer under the eggs was thinner and when ambient temperature was cooler. We also show that the wall around the nest cup is important to buffer egg cooling. It is hypothesised that in bird nests, both the thickness of the material under the eggs, and the wall surrounding the nest cup interact to maintain a heat envelope around the eggs for the time the incubating parent is foraging. This could explain why the thickness of the nest base and wall are adjusted to the ambient temperature the birds experience during the nest building phase, to anticipate the thermal conditions during incubation and preserve egg viability.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103383,110,NA,NA,103383,Great tit; Parus major; Nest size; Egg cooling; Temperature

More broadly, they characterize how selection on thermal limits or maximum rates change with life stage. The effects of temperature on development of Mormon cricket embryos, and hatching and development of nymphs were measured on a population from the Bighorn Mountains of Wyoming and modeled with four non-linear equations. Taylor's Gaussian curve characterized embryonic development, which was most rapid at 26.9 degrees C. However, half-grown embryos aestivated at high temperatures, resulting in a significant shift in the optimum temperature to complete embryonic development to 24.1 degrees C and a reduction in the breadth of the performance curve (thermal breadth). Fully grown embryos hatched fastest at relatively low temperatures (21.8 degrees C), whereas nymphal development was maximized at relatively high temperatures (35.7 degrees C). Thermal breadths for nymphal hatching and development were also significantly broader than that for embryonic development. Differences in optimum temperature and thermal breadth of each life stage should be taken into consideration in population modeling, comparisons among populations, and epigenetic studies of acclimation.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103356,110,NA,NA,103356,Demography; Growth; Heat; Katydid; Optimum; Population; Thermal breadth

The design of exercise facilities and parks is usually function-oriented, and the spatial layout and arrangement of exercise paths are based on the exercise type. However, few studies compared the thermal comfort of different exercise types. This study investigated seasonal differences in thermal sensation, thermal comfort, and other influencing factors among people who engaged in various types of exercise in a severe cold city in China. The results showed significant differences in thermal comfort among the different exercise types. The acceptable thermal range of exercising people is greater than that of the resting ones. In the cold season, the thermal comfort of different exercise types had a significant correlation with thermal sensation, but not with humidity and wind sensations. On the other hand, the thermal comfort of jogging respondents was more affected by humidity, wind, and sun sensations during the hot season. The modified UTCI range of thermal stress category was proposed as a design reference for the thermal environment of outdoor exercise venues. Overall, this study can help enrich and guide outdoor thermal comfort research in severe cold regions and aid the design of urban exercise spaces.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103330,109,NA,NA,103330,Outdoor thermal comfort; Thermal sensation; Severe cold region; Exercise types; Seasonal differences

The developed model is characterized by: 1) the concept of net exercise efficiency which is used to correct the calculation of metabolic heat production by excluding mechanical energy; 2) the effects of low temperature on basal metabolic rate and basal blood flow rate; 3) the integration with a multi-layer clothing model to calculate the heat and moisture transfer through the clothing system, which takes into account the air gaps between the clothing layers to reflect the ventilation and air penetration effect from the ambient wind. Human subject experiment is conducted in a climate chamber to validate the proposed model. The human subject experiment is also carried out in a cold environment (-5 degrees C) combined with different air velocity conditions (still air, 2 m/s), taking into account the activities of different intensities (standing statically, 2 km/h walking and 7 km/h running). Thermo-physiological parameters including the core temperature, 8-point local skin temperatures and the clothing layer temperatures, are measured during the experiment. Comparison be-tween the predicted and experimental results gives the root mean squared error (RMSE) of core temperature and mean skin temperature of 0.06-0.10 degrees C and 0.17-0.27 degrees C, respectively. RMSE values for local skin and clothing layer temperatures are no higher than 1.5 degrees C and most within 0.8 degrees C.

Fumigation is often used to eliminate infestations, but it is costly, has negative environmental effects and does not prevent reinfestation. Heat treatment has been suggested as an alternative. Many insect pest mitigation strategies recommend 30 min exposure at 56 degrees C, but this may be difficult to achieve in structural applications. The potential for heating at lower temperatures was explored to determine the effect on termite survival and gut fauna. Exposure to 40 degrees C up to an hour did not kill the termites; however, 1-h exposure at 45 degrees C was lethal. Exposure for little as 3 min at 50 degrees C or 2 min at 55 degrees C was lethal. Protozoa levels were lower in termites that survived shorter exposures, but there appeared to be some recovery over time. The results suggest that short term exposures to 50 or 55 degrees C could be used to eliminate infestations, creating an opportunity for localized spot heating as a mitigation measure.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103199,104,NA,NA,103199,West indian drywood termite; Heat treatment; Protozoa; Lethal temperatures; Invasive species
article,Age comparison of changes in local warm and cold sensitivity due to whole body cooling,"Coull, Nicole A. and Hodder, Simon G. and Havenith, George",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Purpose: This study investigated the influence of whole body cooling on local thermal sensitivity to warm (40 degrees C) and cold (20 degrees C) stimuli in 10 young (age: 24 +/- 2 yrs) and 10 older males (age: 69 +/- 4 yrs). Methods: Local warm and cold sensitivity was assessed at eight body regions using a 25 cm(2) pressure controlled thermal probe after 40 min of whole body exposure to a thermoneutral (NEUT: 25 degrees C/40\% RH) and a cold (COLD: 12 degrees C/50\% RH) environment. Gastrointestinal temperature (T-gi), mean and local skin temperature, heart rate, whole body thermal sensation and comfort, and skin blood flow were also measured. Results: Whole body cooling blunted local cold sensitivity but warm sensitivity was maintained in both age groups. Furthermore, a significant age-related decline (from young to older group) in sensitivity to a warm stimulus was observed in both NEUT and COLD conditions. Older males also had a greater Delta T-gi compared to the young but had similar thermal sensation and comfort responses. Conclusion: The observed interaction effect of local cold stimulation and whole body cooling may be related to both stimuli triggering similar TRP channels, whereas the lack of interaction between local warm stimuli and whole body cooling may be related to these two stimuli triggering different TRP channels. The findings reiterate the potential thermoregulatory risks (e.g. cold injury and hypothermia) associated with ageing, even with such short exposure times.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103174,104,NA,NA,103174,Thermal sensitivity; Ageing; Regional; Warm; Cold; Cooling

article,Do thermal acclimation and an acute heat challenge alter myonuclear domain of control- and fast-growing quail?,"Jimenez, Ana Gabriela and De Jesus, Aliyah D.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Efforts to determine physiological traits that may render species resilient or susceptible to changing global temperatures have accelerated in recent years. Temperature is of critical importance to biological function; thus, climate change has the potential to severely affect all levels of biological organization in many species. For example, increases in environmental temperatures may alter muscle structure and function in birds. Myonuclear domain (MND), an under-studied aspect of avian muscle physiology that changes in response to thermal stress, is defined as the amount of cytoplasm within a muscle fiber that each nucleus is responsible for servicing. Here, we used two random bred lines of Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) representing examples of control and fast growth rates. We used a factorial design to administer four treatment combinations to each line - an initial period of either heat-stress acclimation (Acclimation) or no acclimation (Not acclimated) followed by either a heat-stress challenge (HS) or no challenge (NC) after week 8 of age - to determine the effects of thermal acclimation and acute thermal stress on quail MND. We found a significant interaction between line {*} final treatment with fast-growing, HS birds demonstrating the lowest numbers of nuclei per mm of fiber, and Acclimated control-growing birds showing the highest numbers of nuclei per mm of fiber. There was a significant effect of line on MND with the fast-growing line having larger MNDs. Initial treatment with Not Acclimated birds showed larger MNDs. Additionally, control growing quail demonstrated positive correlations with fiber size, whereas fast growing quail did not. This may mean that nuclei in larger fibers of fast-growing quail may be functioning maximally, and that increases in temperature may also demonstrate similar effects.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103050,100,NA,NA,103050,Growth rate; Muscle; Myonuclear domain

Groups consisting of 4-17 pregnant SAMM and Dormer ewes were randomly allocated to 5-10 paddocks with natural shade from trees and 5-9 paddocks that were directly in the sun with no shade available. The lambs were recorded within 24 h of birth at noon. Climate data were obtained from a nearby weather station. The lambs were also weighed at 12 (SD = 2) days of age at tail-docking. Tree shade had a moderating effect on temperature, resulting in lower maximum daytime and higher minimum night-time temperatures. There was an interaction between a temperature-humidity index (THI) and the treatments (access to shade or no access to shade) for respiration and rectal temperature (P < 0.01). Both traits were relatively unaffected by the THI at values below 77. Unshaded lambs exhibited a pronounced upwards trend following a THI-threshold of 77-78. Tailing weight tended to be higher while lamb survival of live-born lambs to tail-docking was lower in lambs born in shaded paddocks but these trends did not persist to weaning.

Furthermore, the mRNA expression of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene was analyzed under the stress. We found that the levels of the plasma cortisol, TSH, T3, glucose, and TC increased under the low temperature stress, suggesting that elevated hormones may be conducive to promoting the mobilization of the glucose and lipid in L. crocea exposed to low temperature. During the rewarming period, the plasma cortisol level decreased, whereas the T3 level was still significantly higher than that in the control group. Notably, the plasma T4 level was unaffected by the temperature changes. Furthermore, the sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that the GR protein of L. crocea had high homology and a similar protein structure with those from other teleosts. Under the low temperature stress, the GR mRNA expression increased in the brain and head kidney, whereas it basically returned to the control level following rewarming.

article,Short communication: Context matters: Adult size is contingent on embryonic temperature in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>,"Hoover, Megan M. and Marks, Christopher",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature is a critical factor in shaping ectothermic development. Developmental temperature may constrain, alter, or redirect phenotypes expressed later in life. Recent studies have begun to analyze the consequences of mismatches between developmental and adult environments. Few studies analyze the consequences environmental mismatches during development yield on adult phenotypes. The aim of this study was to determine how mismatched temperatures during development affect adult size in Drosophila melanogaster. We employed a full factorial design in which eggs were incubated for 24 h in one of two temperature treatments (18 degrees C or 28 degrees C) with half of the flies subsequently being switched to the opposite temperature treatment for the remainder of development. We measured body size shortly after eclosure. We found that variation in size after eclosure was contingent upon the temperature during the embryo stage. Flies reared initially in 18 degrees C eclosed larger regardless of the subsequent temperature until eclsoure. Flies reared initially in 28 degrees C, however, eclosed smaller only if they remained in 28 degrees C until eclosure.

Efficient mass rearing of the edible grasshopper is critical to ensure their sustainable supply for food and nutritional security. Hence, we investigated the effect of temperature on development, survival and reproduction of R. differens under six constant (15, 20, 25, 30, 32 and 35 degrees C) and fluctuating temperatures. Using Insect Life Cycle Modeling software we fitted, linear and non-linear models to R. differens development, mortality, longevity, and fecundity. The best-fitted functions were compiled for each life stage to yield a phenology model, which was stochastically simulated to estimate the life table parameters. We used the process-based climatic phenology models, and applied establishment risk index (ERI) and generation index (GI) in a geographic information system to map the potential distribution of R. differens under current and future climates. At optimum temperatures of 30-32 degrees C, egg incubation period was 14-15 days and the developmental time was shortest at 52.5-58 days. Lowest nymphal mortality (3.4-13\%) and the highest female fecundity was obtained at 25-30 degrees C. The optimum temperature for the reproduction ranged between 27 and 30 degrees C. Most simulated lifetable parameters were at their maximum at 28 degrees C. Predictive models showed that countries in the East, Central, West, Southern and the Horn of Africa were suitable for establishment of R. differens under current climate scenarios (2000). However, by 2050, climatically suitable areas for the establishment of R. differens were predicted to shrink in the West, Southern and the Horn of Africa than its current distribution. We predict up to three generations per year for R. differens in sub-Saharan Africa under current scenarios which can increase to 4 under future scenarios. The optimum rearing temperatures identified can guide optimization of mass rearing of R. differens.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102786,95,NA,NA,102786,Life cycle modelling; Development rate; Mortality; Fecundity; Lifetable parameters; Climate suitability

Diaz",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"A 20-month recapture analysis of 1001 individually marked mesquite lizards (Sceloporus grammicus) suggests that variation in thermal quality across three altitudes influences survival probability. Each additional unit of deviation from the temperature selected by these lizards in previous laboratory experiments (i.e. decreased thermal quality) meant an increase of roughly 1.01\% in survival probability. Survival probabilities ranged from 0.80 to 0.90 at the lowest elevation site (2600 m), from 0.76 to 0.87 at the middle elevation site (3100 m) and from 0.90 to 0.94 at the highest elevation site (4150 m). These results suggest that in poor thermal quality environments mesquite lizards may employ thermoregulatory strategies (behavioral, physiological and/or morphological) to decrease their metabolic expenditure and their exposure to predators, maximizing survival.

For this purpose, tolerable temperature ranges of juvenile gilthead seabream acclimated at 15, 20, 25, and 30 degrees C for 30 days were estimated using dynamic and static thermal methodologies. The SMRs of the fish were also determined based on oxygen consumption rate (OCR). The dynamic and static thermal tolerance zones of gilthead seabream were calculated as 737 degrees C-2 and 500 degrees C-2, respectively, with a resistance zone area of 155.5 degrees C-2. The SMR of the fish at the above acclimation temperatures (AT) was determined as 138, 257, 510, and 797 mg O-2 h(-1) kg(-1), respectively and were significantly different (P < 0.01, n = 10). The temperature quotient (Q(10)) in relation to the SMR of the fish was calculated as 3.45, 3.91, and 2.44 for acclimation temperature ranges of 15-20, 20-25, and 25-30 degrees C, respectively. The fact that the SMR increased with rising temperatures and then decreased gradually after 25 degrees C indicates that the temperature preference of juvenile gilthead seabream lies between 25 and 30 degrees C. This study shows that gilthead seabream tolerates a relatively narrow temperature range, and consequently, a low capacity for acclimatisation to survive in aquatic systems characterised by temperature variations.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102739,93,NA,NA,102739,Sparus aurata; Gilthead seabream; Thermal acclimation; Standard metabolic rate; Preferred temperature

In a combination to heat stress (HS), NA is also known to induce heat-shock proteins (HSPs) production. Heat preconditioning (HP) and HSPs have cytoprotective effects against development of cellular injury caused by application of subsequent stressor. We aimed to determine if pretreatment with NA and HP (as HSP70 -inducers) can affect STZ-induced diabetic disturbances in rats. Methods: NA-pretreatment (250 mg/kg b.w., 7 days) and heat preconditioning (41 +/- 1 degrees C, 45 min) of diabetic rats was performed. The changes in hepatic carbohydrate- and antioxidative-related enzymes and substrates were investigated. Results: NA-pretreatment, alone or in combination with HS, resulted in significant increase of HSP70 concentration in the liver of control and diabetic rats. Compared to diabetic controls, pretreatment with NA, in combination with HP, resulted in decrease of blood and liver glucose, increase of glycogen and glucose-6-phosphate level, increase of glycogenolytic/glycolytic enzymes, decrease of gluconeogenic enzymes, as well as an increase of glutathione content and glutathione peroxidase, decrease of glutathione reductase and catalase activities. Conclusions: NA is a potent HSP70 coinducer, alone or in a combination with HS in the liver of both control and diabetic rats. Pretreatment with NA, accompanied by HP, has a pronounced corrective effect on STZ-induced diabetes disturbances in the key hepatic carbohydrate- and antioxidative-related parameters.

In recent years, the emphasis was placed on predicting the impacts of global warming on the fauna of ectotherms in general. Many times future impacts are predicted based on global thermal information (macroscale) but not on an individual scale. We used literature data about body temperature in anurans that inhabit the desert region of the Northwest of Argentina to analyze the role of the elevation, eco-region and substrate temperature on the individual scale. Also, we evaluated the predictive capacity that global environmental variables obtained from WorldClim for this region, and compared them with those of local scale. Our results showed that the activity body temperature of the toads in the arid region of western Argentina strongly influenced by elevation and the substrate temperature on the individual scale. We observed that data of the global scale (WorldClim) can predict the body temperature of the studied amphibians, but with a deviation, not less than 8 degrees C. According to our results, it is evident that to making reliable predictions of how global warming impacts on amphibians in the region, the environmental temperature data need to be recorded at the local scale (operative temperatures).",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102398,85,NA,NA,102398,Desert amphibians; Active body temperature; Hot climate; Global warming; Microclimatic temperatures

One hundred and sixty day-old male chicks (Ross 308) were divided equally into 4 groups (each contained 4 replicates). On the day 22 of age and thereafter, the first group (TN) was raised in a thermoneutral condition (23 +/- 1 degrees C), while the second group (HS) was subjected to 8 h of thermal stress (34 degrees C) and both groups fed the basal diet with no supplements. The third (CR) and fourth (AS) groups were subjected to the same thermal stress conditions and fed curcumin-supplemented diet (100 mg curcumin kg(-1) diet) and ASA-supplemented diet (1 g ASA kg(-1) diet), respectively. Dietary treatment had a significant effect on ADFI (P = 0.041), average daily gain (P = 0.013) and final body weight (P = 0.001). The curcumin-supplemented had higher values for these measures compared with other experimental groups (P < 0.05). Also, the dietary curcumin supplement significantly increased the carcass yield as compared to the HS group (P < 0.05). Compared with the HS group, the dietary curcumin and ASA supplements decreased the concentration of malondialdehyde in the breast muscles (P = 0.014). Both dietary supplements exhibited a marked ability to restore the serum TAC, Na and K in heat-stressed broiler chickens.

Although total hemocyte count increased in the injected larvae by Beauveria bassiana, elevation of hemocyte numbers was significantly different in the larvae exposed to 34 degrees C for a short-time period compared to long-term exposure and control. A similar trend was observed in plasmatocyte and granulocyte counts as well as phenoloxidase activity. Gene expression of some antimicrobial peptides, including attacin1, attacin2, cecropin1, cecropin2, defensin, gallerimycin, lysozyme and prophenoloxidase-activating proteinase-3, was compared in the larvae exposed to thermal regimes and injection challenges.

In acute hypoxia, naked mole-rat body temperature (T-b) decreases to ambient temperature (T-a) but the mechanisms that underlie this thermoregulatory response are unknown. We hypothesized 1) that naked mole-rat blood vessels vasodilate during hypoxia to shunt heat toward the body surface and/or 2) that they augment heat loss through evaporative cooling. Using open-flow respirometry (indirect calorimetry) we explored metabolic and thermoregulatory strategies of naked mole-rats exposed to hypoxia (7\% O-2 for 1 h) at two relative humidities (RH; 50 or 100\% water saturation), and in two T-a's (25 and 30 degrees C), alone, and following treatment with the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II (ANGII). We found that T-b and metabolic rate decreased in hypoxia across all treatment groups but that neither RH nor ANGII effected either variable in hypoxia. Conversely, both T-b and metabolic rate were reduced in 100\% RH or by ANGII treatment in normoxia at 25 degrees C, and therefore the absolute change in both variables with the onset of hypoxia was reduced when vasodilation or evaporative cooling were prevented. We conclude that naked mole-rats employ evaporative cooling and vasodilation to thermoregulate in normoxia and in 25 degrees C but that neither mechanism is involved in thermoregulatory changes during acute hypoxia. These findings suggest that NMRs may employ passive strategies such as reducing thermogenesis to reduce T-b in hypoxia, which would support metabolic rate suppression.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.011,84,NA,228-235,NA,Hypoxic metabolic response; Angiotensin II; Relative humidity; Metabolic rate; Passive cooling
article,Drop it like it's hot: Interpopulation variation in thermal phenotypes shows counter-gradient pattern,"Hodgson, Mitchell J. and Schwanz, Lisa E.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Ectotherms utilise a complex array of behavioural and physiological mechanisms to cope with variation in suboptimal thermal environments. However, these mechanisms may be insufficient for population persistence under contemporary climate change, resulting in a greater need to understand how local populations respond to geographic variation in climate. In this study, we explored the potential for local adaptation and acclimation in thermal traits and behaviours using wild and captive populations of a small agamid lizard (the jacky lizard, Amphibolurus muricatus). We predicted that wild lizards from a high elevation site would have cooler thermal preferences compared to those at low elevation sites to match the more restricted thermal resources at higher, cooler elevations. We additionally explored whether variation in thermal traits was due to recent acclimation or fixed population differences, such as due to developmental plasticity or local adaptation. In contrast to our predictions, we found high-elevation lizards began panting at higher temperatures and had higher thermal preferences relative to lower elevation lizards. When allowed to bask freely, there was no difference in the intensity of basking or daily duration of time spent basking between lizards from different elevations. Although the high-elevation lizards appeared to show stronger acclimation to recent air temperatures compared to low-elevation lizards, this difference was not significant. Similarly, captive lizards acclimated under long and short basking regimes showed no major differences in thermal traits or basking behaviour. Our results are consistent with the presence of counter-gradient variation in thermal phenotypes of lizards, and suggest that these are driven by local adaptive responses or developmental effects rather than recent acclimation.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.05.016,83,NA,178-186,NA,Acclimation; Local adaptation; Climate responses; Counter-gradient; Intraspecific variation

The objective of the present study was to determine heat load thresholds of average daily temperature-humidity index (THI) that lead to changes in different activity traits of lactating high-yielding dairy cows. Furthermore, we studied how the activity of the cows to heat load was influenced by the daily heat load duration which exceeded the heat load we had determined as threshold in our experiments. The study was conducted from June 2015 to May 2017 in a naturally ventilated dairy barn in Gross Kreutz, Germany. The climate was measured at several positions inside the barn, and the average THI was calculated every 10 min. The THI was used to define the dairy cows' heat load exposure. In addition, the activity of the cows was measured by pedometers, and different activity traits were recorded in the functional groups ``resting behavior{''} and ``locomotion behavior{''}. The heat load thresholds determined by broken-stick models were 47 THI (standing bout duration, number of steps) as well as 67 THI (total lying/standing time, number of lying/standing bouts, lying bout duration). During the experimental period, the most reliable heat load threshold of 67 TIH was exceeded from May to September for up to 480 h per month. The analysis model of each activity trait included the effect of the average daily THI values below and above the determined heat load threshold and the effect of the daily heat load duration exceeding the determined heat load threshold. The total lying/standing time and the number of steps showed significant changes related to increasing daily heat load duration. The effect of the daily heat load duration additionally intensified the effect of the average daily THI.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.08.012,77,NA,67-74,NA,Temperature-humidity index; Heat load duration; Heat load threshold; Activity trait
article,"Studies on chill coma recovery in the ladybird, <i>Harmonia axyridis</i>: Ontogenetic profile, effect of repeated cold exposures, and capacity to predict winter survival","Knapp, Michal and Vernon, Philippe and Renault, David",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The harlequin ladybird, Harmonia axyridis, is one of the most successful invasive insect species worldwide. We investigated whether (i) chill coma recovery time (CCRt) changes during the ontogenetic development of this species, (ii) CCRt varies in response to repeated cold shocks, and (iii) CCRt could be a good predictor of winter survival ability in adults. CCRt decreased during larval development, the lowest CCRt values were observed in teneral adults (one and four days old), and significantly higher values were observed for older adults (16 and 32 days old). Repeated cold shocks (two hours at -3 degrees C), interrupted by short (30 min) warm periods (22 degrees C) resulted in decreased CCRt after the second cold shock, probably depicting an acclimation response, but then CCRt increased with additional cold shocks, likely revealing the accumulation of chill injuries. The CCRt of pre-overwintering individuals was not correlated with their winter survival. This indicates that CCRt is not a reliable measure of cold tolerance in H. axyridis. However, this result could be partially affected by the experimental setup the use of laboratory-reared individuals who experienced standardized conditions and thus the variability in CCRt of tested animals could be much lower than the variability present in nature. The substantial variation observed over the ontogenetic development of H. axyridis poses important methodological implications for future studies, as animals of the same stage/age should be compared with each other.

However, a concept of managing a cabin thermal environment remains unchanged for decades. The only major improvement has been an automatic HVAC controller with one user's input - temperature. In this case, the temperature is often deceiving because of thermally asymmetric and dynamic nature of the cabins. As a result, the effects of convection and radiation on passengers are not captured in detail what also reduces the potential to meet thermal comfort expectations. Advanced methodologies are available to assess the cabin environment in a fine resolution (e.g. ISO 14505:2006), but these are used mostly in laboratory conditions. The novel idea of this work is to integrate equivalent temperature sensors into a vehicular cabin in proximity of an occupant. Spatial distribution of the sensors is expected to provide detailed information about the local environment that can be used for personalised, comfort driven HVAC control. The focus of the work is to compare results given by the implemented system and a Newton type thermal manikin. Three different ambient settings were examined in a climate chamber.

Huey's (1982) energetics model describes how food availability and T-b interact to affect net energy gain. We tested the thermal coadaptation hypothesis and Huey's energetics model with growth rates of juvenile Yarrow's spiny lizards (Sceloporus jarrovii). We compared the preferred (selected) T-b range (T-sel) of lizards in high and low energy states to their optimal temperature (T-o) for growth over nine weeks, and determined whether the T-o for growth depended on food availability. We also measured the same lizards' resting metabolic rate at five T(b)s to test the energetics model assumptions that metabolic cost increases exponentially with T-b and does not differ between energy states. The T-sel of lizards on both diets overlapped with the T-o for growth. The assumptions of the energetics model were verified, but the T-o for net energy gain did not depend on food availability. Therefore, we found support for the thermal coadaptation hypothesis.

L.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"As small bodied poikilothermic ectotherms, invertebrates, more so than any other animal group, are susceptible to extremes of temperature and low water availability. In few places is this more apparent than in the Arctic and Antarctic, where low temperatures predominate and water is unusable during winter and unavailable for parts of summer. Polar terrestrial invertebrates express a suite of physiological, biochemical and genomic features in response to these stressors. However, the situation is not as simple as responding to each stressor in isolation, as they are often faced in combination. We consider how polar terrestrial invertebrates manage this scenario in light of their physiology and ecology. Climate change is also leading to warmer summers in parts of the polar regions, concomitantly increasing the potential for drought. The interaction between high temperature and low water availability, and the invertebrates' response to them, are therefore also explored. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

S. and Pandey, Nityanand and Singh, Ravindra and Singh, Atul Kumar",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"We studied the season dependent thermal tolerance, oxygen consumption, respiratory burst response and antioxidative enzyme activities in juveniles of Barilius bendelisis. The critical thermal maximum (CTmax), lethal thermal maximum (LTmax), critical thermal minimum (CTmin) and lethal thermal minimum (LTmin) were significantly different at five different seasons viz. winter (10.64 degrees C), spring (16.25 degrees C), summer (22.11 degrees C), rainy (20.87 degrees C) and autumn (17.77 degrees C). The highest CTmax was registered in summer (36.02 degrees C), and lowest CTmin was recorded during winter (2.77 degrees C). Water temperature, dissolved oxygen and pH were strongly related to CTmax, LTmax, CTmin and LTmin suggesting seasonal acclimatization of B. bendelisis. The thermal tolerance polygon area of the B. bendelisis juveniles within the range of seasonal temperature (10.64-22.11 degrees C) was calculated as 470.92 degrees C-2. Oxygen consumption rate was significantly different (p<0.05) between seasons with maximum value during summer (57.66 mg O-2/kg/h) and lowest in winter (32.60 mg O-2/kg/h). Total white blood cell count including neutrophil and monocytes also showed significant difference (p<0.05) between seasons with maximum value during summer and minimum number in winter and were found correlated to temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH and respiratory burst activity. Respiratory burst activity of blood phagocytes significantly differed (p<0.05) among seasons with higher value during summer (0.163 OD540 (nm) and minimum in winter season (0.054 OD540 (nm)). The activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione-s-transferase both in liver and gill, also varied significantly (p<0.05) during different seasons.

article,Regular cold shower exposure modulates humoral and cell-mediated immunity in healthy individuals,"El-Ansary, Mahmoud R. M. and El-Ansary, Amira R. and Said, Shereen M. and Abdel-Hakeem, Mohamed A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Background: Cold hydrotherapy is an ancient practice that has recently gained scientific interest for its potential health benefits. This study explored the effects of regular cold shower exposure on immune cell function. Methods: Sixty healthy Egyptian adults were randomized to take cold or hot showers daily for 90 days. Levels of immunoglobulins, cytokines, and interferon-gamma were measured in blood samples at baseline, 30, 60, and 90 days. Results: The cold shower group exhibited significant increases in immunoglobulin levels. Conversely, the hot shower group showed a significant decrease in IgM levels at 60 and 90 days compared to baseline, alongside nonsignificant decrease of IgG and IgA. the cold shower group demonstrated elevated levels of IL-2 and IL-4 at 90 days, indicating enhanced T-cell proliferation and humoral immunity, respectively. In contrast, the hot shower group did not exhibit significant changes in cytokine levels. There were no significant differences in IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha levels between the groups. Conclusions: Regular cold shower exposure appears to enhance humoral and cell-mediated immunity through the upregulation of antibodies, interleukin-2, and interleukin-4. Brief cold stressors may induce physiological adaptations that prime the immune response. This accessible, sustainable lifestyle modification could potentially serve as an alternative therapy to boost immunity. Further research on larger populations is warranted to better understand the physiological effects of cold temperatures on immunity.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103971,125,NA,NA,103971,Cold hydrotherapy; Immune function; Immunoglobulins; Cytokines; Interferon-gamma

They reflect plastic responses to the environment experienced during an early phase on the phenotype of subsequent phases. We are studying these effects by following individuals of the shrimp Palaemon serratus from the embryonic (eggs carried by females) through the larval phase (pelagic) to the juvenile phase (benthic). In experiment 1, we investigated the effects of larval prey concentration (10, 4 and 2 Artemia/mL) and larval incubation temperature (16 and 22 degrees C) on larval performance (metamorphosis rate, developmental duration and growth) and then on juvenile performance (survival and Specific Growth Rate, SGR, at 18 and 24 degrees C in 14 days). In experiment 2, we investigated the effects of embryonic incubation temperature (larval biomass and lipid content of newly hatched larvae from embryos incubated at 12 and 18 degrees C) and larval prey concentration on larval performance and then on juvenile performance. In both experiments, the larvae plastically increased their development time in response to the reduction in temperature and prey concentration, whereas their survival decreased with temperature and prey concentration. The quantity of lipids available at hatching decreased with decreasing embryonic incubation temperature, which reduced the larval performance, particularly with a low concentration of prey. Survival at 14 days post-metamorphosis was significantly reduced when the embryos were incubated at 12 degrees C compared with those incubated at 18 degrees C, regardless of the subsequent larval incubation conditions, revealing phenotypic links between overconsumption of embryonic yolk reserves and post-metamorphic fitness. Overall, juveniles had a better SGR at 24 than at 18 degrees C, and even better when incubated under stressful embryo-larval conditions (temperature and prey concentration). This study highlighted phenotypic links between developmental stages and over developmental periods of several months.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103892,123,NA,NA,103892,Shrimp; Larval development; Nutritional stress; Phenotypic links; Compensatory growth
article,Temperature-dependent exercise recovery is not associated with behavioral thermoregulation in a salmonid fish,"Rowsey, Lauren E. and Kieffer, James D. and Speers-Roesch, Ben",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The relationship between behavioral thermoregulation and physiological recovery following exhaustive exercise is not well understood. Behavioral thermoregulation could be beneficial for exercise recovery; for example, selection of cooler temperatures could reduce maintenance metabolic cost to preserve aerobic scope for recovery cost, or selection of warmer temperatures could accelerate recovery of exercise metabolites. While post-exercise behavioral thermoregulation has been observed in lizards and frogs, little is known about its importance in fish. We examined the influence of post-exercise recovery temperature on metabolic rate, thermal preference, and metabolite concentrations in juvenile brook char (Salvelinus fontinalis). Fish were acclimated to and exercised at 15 degrees C, then recovered at either 15 degrees C or 10 degrees C while their metabolic rate was measured via respirometry. Metabolite concentrations were measured in fish after exercise at 15 degrees C and recovery under one of three thermal treatments (to simulate various behavioral thermoregulation scenarios): (i) 6 h recovery at 15 degrees C, (ii) 6 h recovery at 10 degrees C, or (iii) 3 h recovery at 10 degrees C followed by 3 h recovery at 15 degrees C. Thermal preference was quantified using a static temperature preference system (15 degrees C vs. 10 degrees C). Metabolic rates returned to resting faster at 10 degrees C compared with 15 degrees C, although at 10 degrees C there was a tradeoff of delayed metabolite recovery. Specifically, post-exercise plasma osmolality, plasma lactate, and muscle lactate remained elevated for the entire period in fish recovering at 10 degrees C, whereas these parameters returned to resting levels by 6 h in fish from the other two recovery groups. Regardless, fish did not exhibit clear behavioral thermoregulation (i.e., fish overall did not consistently prefer one temperature) to prioritize either physiological recovery process. The advantage of metabolic rate recovery at cooler temperatures may balance against the advantage of metabolite recovery at warmer temperatures, lessening the usefulness of behavioral thermoregulation as a post-exercise recovery strategy in fish.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103888,123,NA,NA,103888,Brook char; Thermal preference; Metabolic rate; Excess post-exercise oxygen consumption; Metabolism; Behavior
article,Thermal tolerance does not explain the altitudinal segregation of lowland and alpine aquatic insects,"Carbonell, J. A. and Pallares, S. and Velasco, J. and Millan, A. and Abellan, P.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Elevation gradients provide powerful study systems for examining the influence of environmental filters in shaping species assemblages. High-mountain habitats host specific high-elevation assemblages, often comprising specialist species adapted to endure pronounced abiotic stress, while such harsh conditions prevent lowland species from colonizing or establishing. While thermal tolerance may drive the altitudinal segregation of ectotherms, its role in structuring aquatic insect communities remains poorly explored. This study investigates the role of thermal physiology in shaping the current distribution of high-mountain diving beetles from the Sierra Nevada Iberian mountain range and closely related lowland species. Cold tolerance of five species from each altitudinal zone was measured estimating the supercooling point (SCP), lower lethal temperature (LLT) and tolerance to ice enclosure, while heat tolerance was assessed from the heat coma temperature (HCT). Alpine species exhibited wider fundamental thermal niches than lowland species, likely associated with the broader range of climatic conditions in high-mountain areas. Cold tolerance did not seem to prevent lowland species from colonizing higher elevations, as most studied species were moderately freeze-tolerant. Therefore, fundamental thermal niches seem not to fully explain species segregation along elevation gradients, suggesting that other thermal tolerance traits, environmental factors, and biotic interactions may also play important roles.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103862,121,NA,NA,103862,Altitudinal gradient; Alpine lakes; Dytiscidae; Freezing tolerance; Lowland freshwaters; Thermal limits
article,Enhancing thermal comfort prediction in high-speed trains through machine learning and physiological signals integration,"Zhou, Wenjun and Yang, Mingzhi and Yu, Xiaoyan and Peng, Yong and Fan, Chaojie and Xu, Diya and Xiao, Qiang",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems in high-speed trains (HST) are responsible for consuming approximately 70\% of non -operational energy sources, yet they frequently fail to ensure provide adequate thermal comfort for the majority of passengers. Recent advancements in portable wearable sensors have opened up new possibilities for real-time detection of occupant thermal comfort status and timely feedback to the HVAC system. However, since occupant thermal comfort is subjective and cannot be directly measured, it is generally inferred from thermal environment parameters or physiological signals of occupants within the HST compartment. This paper presents a field test conducted to assess the thermal comfort of occupants within HST compartments. Leveraging physiological signals, including skin temperature, galvanic skin reaction, heart rate, and ambient temperature, we propose a Predicted Thermal Comfort (PTC) model for HST cabin occupants and establish an intelligent regulation model for the HVAC system. Nine input factors, comprising physiological signals, individual physiological characteristics, compartment seating, and ambient temperature, were formulated for the PTS model. In order to obtain an efficient and accurate PTC prediction model for HST cabin occupants, we compared the accuracy of different subsets of features trained by Machine Learning (ML) models of Random Forest, Decision Tree, Vector Machine and K -neighbourhood. We divided all the predicted feature values into four subsets, and did hyperparameter optimisation for each ML model. The HST compartment occupant PTC prediction model trained by Random Forest model obtained 90.4\% Accuracy (F1 macro = 0.889). Subsequent sensitivity analyses of the best predictive models were then performed using SHapley Additive explanation (SHAP) and data -based sensitivity analysis (DSA) methods. The development of a more accurate and operationally efficient thermal comfort prediction model for HST occupants allows for precise and detailed feedback to the HVAC system. Consequently, the HVAC system can make the most appropriate and effective air supply adjustments, leading to improved satisfaction rates for HST occupant thermal comfort and the avoidance of energy wastage caused by inaccurate and untimely predictive feedback.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103828,121,NA,NA,103828,High-speed train passengers; Thermal comfort; Skin temperature; Heart rate variability; Galvanic skin response; Machine learning
article,Sex-specific heterothermy patterns in wintering captive Microcebus murinus do not translate into differences in energy balance,"Noiret, Aude and Karanewsky, Caitlin and Aujard, Fabienne and Terrien, Jeremy",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The physiological mechanisms of responses to stressors are at the core of ecophysiological studies that examine the limits of an organism's flexibility. Interindividual variability in these physiological responses can be particularly important and lead to differences in the stress response among population groups, which can affect population dynamics. Some observations of intersexual differences in heterothermy raise the question of whether there is a difference in energy management between the sexes. In this study, we assessed male and female differences in mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus), a highly seasonal malagasy primate, by measuring their physiological flexibility in response to caloric restriction and examining the subsequent impact on reproductive success. Using complementary methods aiming to describe large-scale and daily variations in body temperature throughout a 6-month winter-like short-day (SD) period, we monitored 12 males and 12 females, applying chronic 40\% caloric restriction (CR) to 6 individuals in each group. We found variations in Tb modulation throughout the SD period and in response to caloric treatment that depended on sex, as females, regardless of food restriction, and CR males, only, entered deep torpor. The use of deeper torpor, however, did not translate into a lower loss of body mass in females and did not affect reproductive success. Captive conditions may have buffered the depth of torpor and minimised the positive effects of torpor on energy savings. However, the significant sex differences in heterothermy we observed may point to physiological benefits other than preservation of energy reserves.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103829,121,NA,NA,103829,Sex; Heterothermy; Caloric restriction; Seasonality; Microcebus murinus
article,Effects of the temperature during embryonic development on adult reproduction and the phenotype of the second generation in zebra finches,"Hope, Sydney F. and Angelier, Frederic",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Across taxa, the temperature experienced by individuals early in life can have large effects on their development. However, comparatively little is known about whether the effects of this thermal developmental environment can be long-lasting or transgenerational. In birds, one important aspect of the developmental environment is incubation and, in general, eggs incubated at low temperatures produce offspring with smaller morphology, suboptimal physiology, and even lower long-term survival. Yet, little is known about whether incubation temperature may affect avian reproduction in adulthood, and nothing is known about whether the effects of avian incubation temperature may be transgenerational. To investigate this, we incubated zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) eggs at two different temperatures: 37.5 degrees C ('control') and 36.3 degrees C ('low'), raised nestlings until adulthood, and allowed same-temperature treatment pairs to reproduce. We found that F-1 individuals incubated at the low temperature had shorter beaks at the start of reproduction than those incubated at the control temperature. Further, compared to those from control parents, F-2 offspring from parents incubated at the low temperature had lighter body masses at 5 days-old and had shorter beaks at 30 days-old. However, we found little evidence that incubation temperature affected other aspects of reproduction, with no effect on latency to lay, clutch size, egg mass, incubation period, hatching success/asynchrony, fledging, or the number of offspring that ultimately survived until independence. Overall, we found some evidence that a difference in the early thermal developmental environment can have lasting morphological effects into the next generation. However, future work is needed to determine whether the incubation temperature that birds experience as embryos may influence parental care behaviors or lifetime reproductive success.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103787,119,NA,NA,103787,Incubation temperature; Early developmental environment; Parental care; Reproductive success; Transgenerational effects; Bird
article,Hiding from heat: The transcriptomic response of two clam species is modulated by behaviour and habitat,"Garcia-Souto, Daniel and Martinez-Marino, Victor and Moran, Paloma and Olabarria, Celia and Vazquez, Elsa",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Rising occurrence of extreme warming events are profoundly impacting ecosystems, altering their functioning and services with significant socio-economic consequences. Particularly susceptible to heatwaves are intertidal shellfish beds, located in estuarine areas already stressed by factors such as rainfall events, red tides, eutrophication, and pollution. In Galicia, Northwestern Spain, these beds support vital shellfisheries, featuring the native clam Ruditapes decussatus and the non-indigenous R. philippinarum. Over recent decades, these populations have experienced notable abundance shifts due to various anthropogenic impacts, including climate change. In this habitat, patches of the seagrass Zostera noltei that coexist with bare sand can act as thermal refuges for benthic organisms such as clams. To assess the impact of heatwaves on these ecosystems, a mesocosm experiment was conducted. Juveniles of both clam species in two habitat types-bare sand and sand with Z. noltei-were exposed to simulated atmospheric heatwaves during diurnal low tide for four consecutive days. Subsequent transcriptomic analysis revealed that high temperatures had a more pronounced impact on the transcriptome of R. philippinarum compared to R. decussatus. The habitat type played a crucial role in mitigating heat stress in R. philippinarum, with the presence of Z. noltei notably ameliorating the transcriptomic response. These findings have direct applications in shellfishery management, emphasizing the importance of preserving undisturbed patches of Z. noltei as thermal refuges, contributing to the mitigation of heatwave effects on shellfish populations.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103776,119,NA,NA,103776,Heat stress; Ruditapes sp.; Seagrass; Behavioural response; Transcriptome; Shellfish management
article,Thermal damage analysis in tissue caused by electromagnetic radiation using space-time collocation method,"Meena, Bhagya Shree and Kumar, Sushil",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Over the past half-century, the usage of external heat sources in medical applications has increased substantially. Controlling heat damage is essential for ensuring the efficacy of the treatment. Living tissues are highly non-homogeneous; hence, it is important to take into account the effects of local non-equilibrium on their thermal behavior. In the present study, two- and three- space dimensional time-space fractional singlephase-lag (SPL) and dual-phase-lag (DPL) models for bio-heat transfer in tissue are considered to study the thermal damage and temperature in tissue caused by electromagnetic radiation as an external heat source. The considered mathematical models are more general and consider non-Fourier as well as non-local effects. We obtain the numerical solution for the models by combining Gaussian RBFs and shifted Chebyshev polynomials in the space and time directions, respectively. The RBFs depend on Euclidean distance, so they can easily be used in multidimensional space domain, and the use of Chebyshev polynomials gives spectral accuracy in time direction. It is also explored how different parameters, such as blood perfusion rate W-b, phase lags iota(q),iota(t), and fractional derivatives alpha,beta, affect the temperature distribution and thermal damage in the tissue.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103715,117,NA,NA,103715,Fractional derivative; Single-phase-lag; Dual-phase-lag; RBFs; Chebyshev polynomials; Electromagnetic heating

Understanding their thermal tolerance is key to predicting their resilience to changing climates and increasingly frequent extreme heat events. We examined critical thermal maxima (CTmax), survival during 1-8 h heat periods, chill coma recovery and thermal preference for Australian meliponine species that occupy different climates across their ranges: Tetragonula carbonaria (tropical to temperate regions), T. hockingsi (tropical and subtropical regions only) and Austroplebeia australis (widely distributed including arid regions). We found interspecific differences in thermal tolerance consistent with differences in the climate variability observed in each species' range. Foragers of A. australis had a faster chill coma recovery (288 s) than foragers of T. hockingsi (1059 s) and T. carbonaria (872 s). Austroplebeia australis also had the highest CTmax of 44.5 degrees C, while the CTmax of the two Tetragonula species was similar to 43.1 degrees C. After a 1-h heat exposure, T. carbonaria foragers experienced 95\% mortality at 42 degrees C, and 100\% at 45 degrees C. Surprisingly, larvae and pupae of both Tetragonula species were more resistant to heat exposure than foragers. Within an enclosed temperature gradient apparatus (17-38 degrees C), no clear preference was found for foragers; however, they were most frequently observed at similar to 18 degrees C. Results indicate that in some regions of Australia, meliponines already experience periodic heat events exceeding their thermal maxima. Employing effective management strategies (such as nest site insulation and habitat preservation) may be crucial to colony survival under continued climate change.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103671,117,NA,NA,103671,Austroplebeia; Chill coma; Critical thermal maxima; Meliponini; Stingless bee; Tetragonula; Thermal biology

Methane emission represents a significant energy loss, particularly in ruminants, as well as heat production. Therefore, the aim of this study was to correlate skin temperature measured using IRT with heat production (HP) and methane emission in lactating Holstein and crossbred 1/2 Holstein x 1/2 Gyr (Gyrolando-F1) cows. Six Gyrolando-F1 and four Holstein cows, all primiparous, at mid lactation were used to evaluate daily HP and methane emission using indirect calorimetry in respiratory chambers. Thermographic images were taken at anus, vulva, ribs (on the right side), left flank, right flank, right front foot, upper lip, masseter and eye; IRT was performed every hour during 8 h after the morning feeding. Cows received the same diet ad libitum. Daily methane emission was positively correlated with IRT taken at the right front foot 1 h after feeding in Gyrolando-F1 cows (r = 0.85, P < 0.05) and with IRT taken at the eye 5 h after feeding in Holstein cows (r = 0.88, P < 0.05).

article,"Investigation of post mortem brain, rectal and forehead temperature relations","Berger, Celine and Bauer, Melanie and Wittig, Holger and Gerlach, Kathrin and Scheurer, Eva and Lenz, Claudia",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"It is well known that magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is temperature sensitive, which is highly relevant for post mortem examinations. Therefore, the determination of the exact temperature of the investigated body site, e.g. the brain, is crucial. However, direct temperature measurements are invasive and inconvenient. Thus, in view of post mortem MR imaging of the brain, this study aims at investigating the relation between the brain and the forehead temperature for modelling the brain temperature based on the non-invasive forehead temperature. In addition, the brain temperature will be compared to the rectal temperature.Brain temperature profiles measured in the longitudinal fissure between the brain hemispheres, as well as rectal and forehead temperature profiles of 16 deceased were acquired continuously. Linear mixed, linear, quadratic and cubic models were fitted to the relation between the longitudinal fissure and the forehead and between the longitudinal fissure and the rectal temperature, respectively.Highest adjusted R2 values were found between the longitudinal fissure and the forehead temperature, as well as between the longitudinal fissure and the rectal temperature using a linear mixed model including the sex, environmental temperature and humidity as fixed effects.The results indicate that the forehead, as well as the rectal temperature, can be used to model the brain temperature measured in the longitudinal fissure. Comparable fit results were observed for the longitudinal fissure-forehead temperature relation and for the longitudinal fissure-rectal temperature relation. Combined with the fact that the forehead temperature overcomes the problem of measurement invasiveness, the results suggest using the forehead temperature for modelling the brain temperature in the longitudinal fissure.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103615,115,NA,NA,103615,Post mortem; Temperature modelling; Post mortem MRI; Brain temperature; Rectal temperature; Forehead temperature
article,Does thermal biology differ between two colour pattern morphs of a widespread Australian lizard?,"Matthews, Genevieve and Farquhar, Jules E. and White, Craig R. and Chapple, David G.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Alternative phenotypes allow individuals to pursue different adaptive pathways in response to the same selective challenge. Colour polymorphic species with geographically varying morph frequencies may reflect multiple adaptations to spatial variables such as temperature and climate. We examined whether thermal biology differed between colour morphs of an Australian lizard, the delicate skink, Lampropholis delicata. The delicate skink has two colour pattern morphs, with frequencies varying across latitude and sex: plain (darker, more common at temperate latitudes, more common in males) or striped (lighter, more common at lower latitudes, more common in females). We tested heating and cooling rate, sprint speed, thermal preference, field body temperature and metabolic rate in both morphs and sexes to determine any link between colour and morph frequency distribution. Plain individuals heated more quickly, but other thermal traits showed little variation among morphs. Lampropholis delicata colour influences rates of heat exchange, but the relationship does not appear to be adaptive, suggesting that behavioural thermoregulation homogenises body temperature in the field. While we find no substantial evidence of thermal differences between the two colour morphs, morph-specific behaviour may buffer against differences in heat exchange. Latitudinal variation in species colour may be driven by selection pressures other than temperature.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103579,114,NA,NA,103579,Colour polymorphism; Alternate phenotypes; Latitudinal cline; Ectotherm; Reptile

Rectal temperature (RT) measurement results were the most constant. However, in ANOVA analysis, significant differences were observed between the different estrus periods, and the difference between the anestrus and diestrus periods was very close to 0.5 degrees C. Although, in the Bland-Altman plot analysis, the agreement was observed only between rectal and intravaginal temperature (p: 0.572, r2: 0.70), the limits of agreement were not clinically acceptable.

article,"Julian Mensch a, b, {*","Kreiman, Lucas and Putero, Florencia and Hasson, Esteban and Mensch, Julian",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Survival and reproduction are the core elements of Darwinian fitness. In the context of a fixed energy budget, organisms tend to allocate resources in order to maximize one at the expense of the other, in what has been called the lifespan-reproduction trade-off. Reproductive arrest and extended lifespan are common responses to low temperatures in many insects including fruit flies. In this study, we aim to understand the overwintering strategy of two closely-related Drosophila species with contrasting distribution ranges. We compared survival, lifespan, ovarian maturation, and reproductive output (fecundity and fertility) of virgin and mated adults of both Drosophila buzzatii and Drosophila koepferae after long-term cold exposure at dormancy-inducing conditions (10 degrees C, 10:14 L:D) and controls (25 degrees C, 12:12 L:D). Virgin flies of D. buzzatii showed the longest lifespan (averaging 102 days) under dormancy-inducing conditions. Cold-induced reproductive arrest preserves reproductive capacity mainly in virgin females that mated after reproductive dormancy, indicating that males were much more susceptible to fertility loss than females, in both species. Notably, females of D. buzzatii were capable of protecting stored sperm from cold damage and produced viable progeny. Even if, in D. buzzatii, fertility of flies mated after the cold-exposure was extremely low, cold temperature likely sterilized D. koepferae males, indicating that cold carry-over effects are stronger for the species with the shorter lifespan. Such species-specific effects of low temperature over fitness likely contributed to the divergence of these closely-related species and to the spread of D. buzzatii into cooler environments.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103504,113,NA,NA,103504,Reproductive dormancy; Cold adaptation; Fruit fly; Overwintering

For the proposed study, 240 hand thermal images were acquired in the dorsal view and ventral view of both the right and left-hand regions of RA and normal subjects. The hot spot regions from the thermograms were segmented using a color-based k-means clustering technique. The features from the segmented hot spot region were extracted using different feature extraction methods. Finally, normal and RA groups were categorized using LogitBoost, Bagging, and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. The proposed study used two testing methods, such as 10-fold cross-validation and a percentage split of 80-20\%. The LogitBoost classifier outperformed with an accuracy of 93.75\% using the 10-fold cross-validation technique compared to other classifiers. Also, the quantum support vector machine (QSVM) obtained a prediction accuracy of 92.7\%. Furthermore, the QSVM model reduces the computational cost and training time of the model to classify the RA and normal subjects.

Heat stress is one of the most critical environmental stressors impairing the welfare and productivity of avian species, especially poultry. Heat stress evokes adverse effects, which include but are certainly not limited to immunosuppression, compromised gut health, oxidative damage, and reduced growth performance in birds. It is now increasingly evident that accurate measurements of heat stress before adverse effects are manifested signify a critical step towards developing effective heat stress mitigative strategies. Despite the growing body of knowledge on the impacts of heat stress on avian species and possible mitigative strategies, a comprehensive overview of the methods and biomarkers available to evaluate the occurrence of heat stress is lacking in the literature. Accordingly, this review provides a detailed overview of the physiological mechanisms underlying heat stress in birds. Additionally, the merits and limitations of current invasive and non-invasive measures of heat stress are highlighted.

Bull ejaculates were collected to evaluate seminal quality parameters, sperm membrane integrity, and redox status (SOD; GPx; GSH; GRx; CARB; DCF; and SOD/GPx ratio). Bulls located in the temperate region showed a higher sperm motility rate and percentage of viable sperm (P < 0.05). When evaluating regions independently, we observed a lower GPx activity from animals in the tropical region (P < 0.05). In contrast, we found that SOD and GRx activities, GSH content, and CARB oxidative levels were higher in the tropical region, while oxidation values of DCF were lower (P < 0.05). Braford bulls showed higher CARB and DCF levels (1.23 +/- 0.61 nmol/mg and 1453.60 +/- 828.63 nmol/mg, respectively) compared to Hereford bulls (1.00 +/- 0.43 nmol/mg and 1138.70 +/- 423.24 nmol/mg, respectively) in the temperate region. However, Nellore bulls showed higher DCF levels (650.50 +/- 401.53 nmol/mg) than Braford bulls (409.40 +/- 286.97 nmol/ mg). In addition, the SOD/GPx ratio was lower in Braford (12.44 \& PLUSMN; 7.64 U/mg) compared to Nellore bulls in tropical conditions (87.25 +/- 2.83 U/mg). A positive correlation was found in temperate conditions between DCF levels, SOD, and GRx activities (0.51, 0.58; P < 0.01, respectively), as well as in subtropical conditions between DCF levels and GRx activity (0.53; P < 0.01). A negative correlation between the temperature-humidity index and CARB content was found in subtropical and tropical regions (-0.44; P < 0.01). We concluded that Braford breeds showed lower seminal motility, DCF contents and SOD/GPx ratios compared to Nellore bulls in tropical climate conditions. Finally, in temperate environmental conditions, Braford bulls also showed lower seminal motility but higher levels of CARB and DCF contents compared to Hereford bulls. Therefore, the existence of climatic differences between the temperate and tropical regions evaluated affected Braford bulls' seminal motility and seminal redox homeostasis.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103319,109,NA,NA,103319,Animal adaptation; Temperature -humidity index; ROS; Enzyme activity; Bulls

During clinical examination, temperature measurement is a basic step in veterinary medicine. The conventional method used is the rectal thermometry, particularly stressful in some subjects, especially for cats. A less stressful alternative method, such as infrared thermal imaging camera, is used in various fields of medicine for diagnosis, prognosis and correct therapeutic approaches. To evaluate the usefulness of infrared thermal imaging for the assessment of ocular temperature, twenty cats of different breeds (European, Siamese and Persian, 4-6 years old, mean body weight 4.3 +/- 0.30 Kg) were enrolled in the study. In order to evaluate the applicability of the ocular temperature assessment through thermal imaging as a tool for measuring the animal's body temperature, the obtained values were compared with the rectal temperature values recorded in each cat by means of a digital thermo-camera. There were no differences between left and right eye; and a difference of about 1.19 degrees C between the ocular and rectal temperature value was recorded (p < 0.0001). Rectal and ocular temperatures were positively correlated (p < 0.0001; r = 0.93). In conclusion, we show that ocular temperature is an alternative method for body temperature measurement that can be used in clinical evaluation of cats, especially in cases where rectal temperature recording is not possible.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103104,102,NA,NA,103104,Infrared thermal imaging camera; Rectal temperature; Ocular temperature; Cat
article,Transcriptome and co-expression network analyses reveal the regulatory pathways and key genes associated with temperature adaptability in the yellow drum <i>(Nibea albiflora)</i>,"Zhao, Xiang and Sun, Zhicheng and Xu, Hao and Song, Na and Gao, Tianxiang",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The yellow drum (Nibea albiflora) is an important marine economy fish, that is widely distributed in the coastal waters of the Northwest Pacific. To understand the molecular regulatory mechanism of the yellow drum under temperature stress, transcriptome analysis was performed under five temperature conditions (10 degrees C, 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 24 degrees C, 28 degrees C) in the present study. Compared with 20 degrees C, 163, 401, 276, and 372 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained at 10 degrees C, 15 degrees C, 24 degrees C and 28 degrees C, respectively. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis indicated that the DEGs were mainly involved in cellular processes, metabolic processes, catalytic activity, membrane and binding. Meanwhile, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis showed that the temperature adaptive regulation of the yellow drum was mainly involved in signal transduction, metabolism, genetic information and protein processing. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) showed that HMGB1, STAT4, Noct, C1q and CRT may be the key hub genes in the response of the yellow drum to temperature stress. In addition, 20 genes that may be associated with temperature stress were identified based on comparative analysis between the KEGG enrichment and the WGCNA results. Ten DEGs were selected for further validation using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and the results were consistent with the RNA-seq data.

article,Perceptual strain in a compensable hot environment: Accuracy and clinical correlates,"Weiner, Cynthia M. and Kazman, Josh B. and Abraham, Preetha A. and Deuster, Patricia A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Heat strain monitoring indexes are important to prevent exertional heat illness (EHI) and uncover risk factors. Two indexes are the Physiological Strain Index (PSI) and a subjective PSI analogue, the Perceptual Strain Index (PeSI). The PeSI is a feasible alternative to PSI in field conditions, although the validity has been variable in previous research. However, the PeSI has been rarely examined at a low heat strain with compensable heat stress, such as during a heat tolerance test (HTT). This study evaluated the discrepancy between the maximal PeSI and maximal PSI achieved during a HTT and determined their association with EHI risk factors, including history of EHI, percent body fat (\%BF), relative VO2max, fatigue and sleep status (n = 121; 47 without prior EHI, 74 with prior EHI). The PSI was calculated using the change in rectal temperature (Tre) and heart rate (HR) and PeSI was calculated based on the formula containing thermal sensation (TS), a Tre analogue, and rate of perceived exertion (RPE), a HR analogue. Significant associations were identified between PSI and PeSI and between PSIHR and PeSIHR in the total sample and between PSI and PeSI in the EHI group. Bland-Altman analyses indicated PeSI underestimated PSI in the total sample, PSIHR was greater than PeSIHR, and that PSIcore and PeSIcore were not significantly different, but values varied widely at different heat strains. This indicates the use of RPE underestimates HR and that the accuracy of TS to predict Tre may be subpar. This study also demonstrated that participants with higher \%BF have a decreased perception of heat strain and that post-fatigue, sleep status and a prior EHI may increase the perception of heat strain. Overall, these results suggest that PeSI is a poor surrogate for PSI in a compensable heat stress environment at low heat strain.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102863,100,NA,NA,102863,Heat exhaustion; Exertional heat illness; Heat strain; Heat stroke; Perceptual strain index; Physiological strain index
article,Plant shade enhances thermoregulation of internal environments in Trinervitermes trinervoides mounds,"Ndlovu, Mduduzi and Nampa, Gosego and Joseph, Grant S. and Seymour, Colleen L.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Microhabitats may be crucial in buffering organisms from temperature extremes, particularly given increases in maximum temperature associated with global climate change. For example, thermoregulation in termite mounds is influenced by prevailing ambient conditions, and plant canopies may reduce external temperatures, in turn lowering internal temperatures. This buffering may be crucial during heat waves. Whether this happens, and to what extent, remains equivocal, however. We tracked internal temperatures in eight inhabited and six uninhabited Trinervitermes trinervoides mounds, half of each group of which were shaded by vegetation. T. trinervoides seek to maintain internal mound temperatures at c. 20 degrees C in winter and c. 30 degrees C in summer. Temperatures were logged for 72 h in winter, and again in summer. Internal temperatures of uninhabited mounds mirrored those of external temperatures, with temperatures varying by c. 15 degrees C, although shading was associated with some buffering of internal temperatures. Internal temperatures within inhabited mounds were far less variable, varying by c. 6 degrees C over the course of our study. In summer, exposed inhabited mounds maintained temperatures c. 29.5 degrees C, whilst shaded inhabited mounds were c. 27.5 degrees C. In winter, mean internal temperatures of exposed and shaded inhabited mounds were very similar, at 21.8 and 22.0 degrees C, respectively. Internal mound temperature varied significantly with external (ambient) temperature, mound activity, temperature, shading, and to a small extent, mound volume. The buffering effect of shade was evident in summer (c. 2 degrees C) but not in winter, suggesting that the benefit of such temperature modulation may be most important when ambient temperatures reach heat extremes, e.g. during heat waves.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103068,100,NA,NA,103068,Afrotropic; Ambient temperature; Global climate change; Microclimate; South Africa; Termites

A total of one hundred twenty 56-week-old ISA-brown laying hens were continuously exposed to one of three temperature regimes: optimal (LT; 22 degrees C), moderate (MT; 27 degrees C), and high (HT; 32 degrees C). The relative humidity was maintained at 50\% in all treatments. HT vs. MT and LT increased rectal temperature, heart rate, and body-surface temperature on all days (P < 0.05). HT vs. LT raised (P < 0.05) the H/L ratio in blood at day 42 following heat exposure. On the other hand, both HT- and MT-exposed laying hens had higher (P < 0.05) plasma CORT compared with those on LT group only at 28 and 42 d following heat treatment. Yolk CORT was elevated (P < 0.05) in the HT vs. MT and LT groups at 3 and 14 d following heat treatment. Panting and wing elevation were the most relevant behaviors in laying hens exposed to HT vs. MT and LT.

Milk, fat, protein, and somatic cell count test-day records collected between 2013 and 2019 from 947 cows in 23 herds were combined with THI calculated from meteorological data recorded between 2013 and 2019. The temperature-humidity index (THI) was used to investigate the effect of heat stress. The severity of heat stress was measured using the temperature-humidity index (THI) and the impacts of different THIs-low (<= 68), moderate (68-72), and high (>= 72) on production performance and lactation curve parameters were measured. The nonlinear model of Wood was applied for modeling the lactation curve. Analysis of variance was applied to test the effects of three levels of THI on milk production, its composition, and lactation curve parameters. Results showed losses due to heat stress. A decrease in milk yield and fat and protein content was reported. Fat and protein contents tended to decrease steadily with increasing values of THI. Milk yield ranged from 17.882 +/- 0.064 (68<THI 72) to 16.503 +/- 0.035 kg/j (THI 72 and THI 72, respectively.

Besides, the effect of variations of ambient temperature, convection coefficient of ambient air, blinking, and body's temperature on the human eye's temperature distribution was investigated. Three scenarios (without glasses, wearing medical glasses, and wearing sunglasses) have been considered. The weather information for summer and winter for Divandarreh, Kurdistan province, Iran, has been used as the inputs. The sunlight intensity reaching the eye in three scenarios for both winter and summer was measured experimentally. In scenario 1 (without glasses), for the maximum radiation intensity, the Corneal temperature increased by 5 degrees C, which can cause cataracts in the long term. The results show that by wearing sunglasses in winter, the Corneal temperature reduced by 4 degrees C that may lead to blurred and diplopia visions. It was observed that by increasing the temperature difference between the sides of the Anterior chamber, the Aqueous Humor (AH) circulation speed increases. Also, it was found that the AH's circulation pattern in summer is clockwise, while in winter, it is counterclockwise. The results highlighted the significant effect of the convection coefficient of air ambient on the Corneal temperature. The results show that depending on the ambient temperature, blinking has a significant effect on eye temperature. Moreover, in the summer and scenario1, the difference in maximum temperature of the Cornea between normal and fever conditions is 1.01 degrees C. On the other hand, the difference in maximum temperature of the Cornea between normal and hypothermia conditions is 1.51 degrees C.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102971,99,NA,NA,102971,Temperature distribution; Radiation intensity; Premature cataract; Medical glasses; Convection coefficient of ambient air; The human eye

By determining the temperature distribution in three modes of constant heat flux, parabolic heat flux and internal heat generation in tumor tissue, the amount of burn in all three modes is evaluated. The results indicated that the Fourier or non-Fourier behavior of tissue has no role in the rate of burns in thermotherapy processes.

For the first time, the FPT in D. longispina was determined by the ``acute{''} and gravitational methods (18.4 and 18.8 +/- 1.7 degrees C, respectively). We showed that it is possible to calculate the PT range from the standard deviations and/or confidence intervals of PT linear regression that cross the line of equality. The range of PT for acclimated D. longispina obtained by the ``acute{''} method was 17.5-19.4 degrees C and 16-22 degrees C as calculated by the gravitational method. The ranges of pejus (7-15 and 23-24 degrees C) and avoided (3-6 and 25-27 degrees C) temperatures were also determined.

article,Comparative study of heat transfer and thermal damage assessment models for hyperthermia treatment,"Liu, Kuo-Chi and Chen, Tse-Min",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Appropriate heating of the tumor can ablate tumor cells with minimal damage to healthy tissue and low side effects to the patient. Therefore, it is important to estimate power dissipation requirement and predict thermal damage in tumor before hyperthermia treatment. This work applied a mathematical model on heat transfer in two-layered spherical tissue to predict the temperature profile within hyperthermia domain. The present bioheat transfer problem was analyzed based on the Pennes equation, the thermal wave and dual-phase lag modes in order to explore the effect of analysis mode on the power dissipation requirement. The Arrenius equation, the modified thermal damage model with regeneration term, and the equivalent thermal dose equation were used to evaluate the thermal damage and discuss their effects on thermal damage prediction. The computation results show that the model of bioheat transfer and the non-Fourier effect significantly affects the power dissipation requirement. The damage parameter value predicted by the modified thermal damage model with regeneration term seems to have a limit value of omega = 1. The results imply that the regeneration of biological tissue can prevent the tissue from thermal damage, the equivalent thermal dose equation is more related to heating time, and the Arrenius equation is more related to heating temperature.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102907,98,NA,NA,102907,Analysis model; Power dissipation; Regeneration; Thermal damage
article,Underlying mechanism of diurnal change in thermal sensation response at high relative humidity,"Kakitsuba, Naoshi",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Diurnal changes in physiological and behavioral responses to constant relative humidity (RH) were investigated in summer to validate a hypothesis that thermal sensation responses (TSR) vary with the diurnal cycle while maintained at stable RH?s of 60, 70, or 80\%. Seven lightly clothed male subjects were exposed to one of three RH while air temperature (T-a) was held at 28 degrees C from 9:00-18:30. Mean skin temperature ((T) over bar (sk)) and tympanic temperature (T-ty) were monitored at 2-min intervals throughout the experimental period. Cutaneous warm and cool sensation thresholds and stratum corneum water content (SCWC) on the anterior forearm, posterior forearm, and anterior thigh, finger blood flow rate (SkBF) were measured by a thermal stimulator controlled by a Peltier element (Intercross-230; Intercross, Co., Tokyo, Japan), a water content of stratum corneum monitor (Corneometer CM825 \& MPA 5; Integral Co., Tokyo, Japan), and a laser flowmeter (ALF21; Advance Co., Tokyo, Japan), accordingly at the end of three periods: 9:30-10:30, 13:30-14:30, and 17:30-18:30. The TSR and the thermal comfort response were also recorded using subjective scales of thermal sensation and comfort thresholds at the end of three periods. The Tty and mean skin temperature ((T) over bar (sk)) remained unchanged during the day under all RH conditions. Temperature difference between warm and cold sensation thresholds and SkBF decreased slightly towards the evening under all RH conditions whereas SCWC increased from the morning to the evening at 60\% and 80\% RH. Behaviorally, the subjects responded more than ``slightly warm{''} at 70\%, and 80\% RH, and then the TSR changed significantly (p < 0.05) to less than ``slightly warm{''} in the evening, although T-sk(-) remained unchanged at 34.0 degrees C. The results from the previous study in winter was reconfirmed, and the data verify the hypothesis that TSR changes diurnally even though subjects are exposed to a constant and high RH's and stable T-a.

As such, climate change may trigger multiple, interacting phenotypic responses, which underscores the nuances of characterizing a species capacity to adapt and respond to climate change. In this study, we use a model frog species, Bufo gargarizans, to examine how three phenotypes, thermal tolerance limits (critical thermal minimum, CTmin and critical thermal maximum, CTmax), ontogeny, and behavioral preferences in temperature (Tpref) respond to different levels of thermal exposure (i.e., acclimation ranging from 10 degrees C to 30 degrees C). Acclimation temperature had little effect on Tpref of tadpoles, yet behaviorally they showed strong signs of thermal selection towards an optimum. Both CTmin and CTmax increased with acclimation temperature with an approximate 10\% increase in tolerance limits per 1 degrees C increase in exposure. Development and body size both responded to acclimation temperature, both of which also influenced lower but not upper thermal limits.

article,Rearing temperature conditions (constant <i>vs.</i> thermocycle) affect daily rhythms of thermal tolerance and sensing in zebrafish,"de Alba, Gonzalo and Fernando Lopez-Olmeda, Jose and Javier Sanchez-Vazquez, Francisco",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In the wild, the environment does not remain constant, but periodically oscillates so that temperature rises in the daytime and drops at night, which generates a daily thermocycle. The effects of thermocycles on thermal tolerance have been previously described in fish. However, the impact of thermocycles on daytime-dependent thermal responses and daily rhythms of temperature tolerance and sensing expression mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study investigates the effects of two rearing conditions: constant (26 degrees C, C) versus a daily thermocycle (28 degrees C in the daytime; 24 degrees C at night, T) on the thermal tolerance response in zebrafish. Thermal tolerance (mortality) was assessed in 4dpf (days post fertilization) zebrafish larvae after acute heat shock (39 degrees C for 1 h) at two time points: middle of the light phase (ML) or middle of the dark phase (MD). Thermal stress responses were evaluated in adult zebrafish after a 37 degrees C challenge for 1 h at ML or MD to examine the expression of the heat-shock protein (HSP) (hsp70, hsp90ab1, grp94, hsp90aa1, hspb1, hsp47, cirbp) and transient receptor potential (TRP) channels (trpv4, trpm4a, trpm2, trpa1b) in the brain. Finally, the daily rhythms of gene expression of HSPs and TRPs were measured every 4 h for 24 h. The results revealed the larval mortality rates and the expression induction of most HSPs in adult zebrafish brain reached the highest values in fish reared under constant temperature and subjected to thermal shock at MD. The expression of most HSPs and TRPs was mainly synchronized to the light/dark (LD) cycle, regardless of the temperature regime. Most HSPs involved in hyperthermic challenges displayed diurnal rhythms with their acrophases in phase with warm-sensing thermoTRPs acrophases. The cold-sensing trpa1b peaked in the second half of the light period and slightly shifted toward the dark phase anticipating the acrophase of cirpb, which is involved in hypothermic challenges. These findings indicated that: a) thermal shocks are best tolerated in the daytime; b) the implementation of daily thermocycles during larval development reduces mortality and stress-cellular expression of HSPs to an acute thermal stress at MD; c) daily rhythms need to be considered when discussing physiological responses of thermal sensing and thermotolerance in zebrafish.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102880,97,NA,NA,102880,Thermal shock; Thermocycles; Biological rhythms; Zebrafish; Heat shock proteins; Thermo-transient receptor potential channels
article,Performance analysis of human respiratory system based on the second law of thermodynamics,"Dutta, Abhijit and Chattopadhyay, Himadri",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The purpose of this study is to develop a comprehensive thermodynamic model of the human respiratory system and quantify the effects of inspiratory air temperature, relative humidity (RH), lung capacity and O2 fluctuation in metabolic reaction on the human respiratory system under three different physiological conditions, i.e. rest, moderate level of physical activity and extreme level of physical activity. Therefore, a second law-based analysis has carried out for the human respiratory system. It is observed that exergetic efficiency decreases by 21\% and 16.5\% during moderate and extreme level of activity respectively as compared to the physical condition of rest. The respiratory efficiency also increases with the increase in inspiratory air temperature and RH. For a given inspiratory air temperature, an increase in lung volume leads to a reduction in the efficiency. Increase in TV with a high airflow rate gives a higher magnitude of efficiency, such a situation appearing when a person?s lung compliance harmed due to diseases. The respiratory efficiency decreases up to 2\% with the increase in O2 percentage. The efficiency of the respiratory system is in maximum during rest followed by an extreme and moderate level of activity. However, with the controlled supply of O2, the efficiency of the human respiratory performance increases with the decrease in O2 percentage. Due to partial oxidation of glucose at a reduced O2 level, exergy input from the metabolic reaction is less leading to increased exergetic efficiency.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102862,96,NA,NA,102862,Respiratory system; Thermodynamic performance; Exergy; TV; RH; Metabolic reaction

Animals from T2 and T3 showed significant decrease (p < 0.05) by 23.64\% in hemoglobin concentration, 12.73\% in red blood cells, 11.93\% in packed cell volume, 12.02\% in total protein while mean corpuscular volume, white blood cells, lymphocytes, creatinine, urea and aspartate transaminase increased respectively by 10.73\%, 42.37\%, 15.53\%, 28.98\%, 53.2\% and 23.31\% compared to the control. The kidney level of malondialdehyde was significantly increased in T2 and T3 animals by 74.29\%, whereas protein, catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione pemxidase activity were significantly lower (p < 0.05) compared with control.

article,Open-flow respirometry under field conditions: How does the airflow through the nest influence our results?,"Nowack, Julia and Dill, Veronika and Dausmann, Kathrin H.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Open-flow respirometry is a common method to measure oxygen-uptake as a proxy of energy expenditure of organisms in real-time. Although most often used in the laboratory it has seen increasing application under field conditions. Air is drawn or pushed through a metabolic chamber or the nest with the animal, and the O-2 depletion and/or CO2 accumulation in the air is analysed to calculate metabolic rate and energy expenditure. Under field conditions, animals are often measured within the microclimate of their nest and in contrast to laboratory work, the temperature of the air entering the nest cannot be controlled. Thus, the aim of our study was to determine the explanatory power of respirometry in a set-up mimicking field conditions. We measured O-2 consumption of 14 laboratory mice (Mus musculus) using three different flow rates {[}50 L{*}h(-1) (834 mL{*}min(-1)), 60 L{*}h(-1) (1000 mL{*}min(-1)) and 70 L{*}h(-1) (1167 mL{*}min(-1))] and two different temperatures of the inflowing air; either the same as the temperature inside the metabolic chamber (no temperature differential; 20 degrees C), or cooler (temperature differential of 10 degrees C). Our results show that the energy expenditure of the mice did not change significantly in relation to a cooler airflow, nor was it affected by different flow rates, despite a slight, but significant decrease of about 1.5 degrees C in chamber temperature with the cooler airflow. Our study emphasises the validity of the results obtained by open-flow respirometry when investigating energy budgets and physiological responses of animals to ambient conditions. Nevertheless, subtle changes in chamber temperature in response to changes in the temperature and flow rate of the air pulled or pushed through the system were detectable. Thus, constant airflow during open-flow respirometry and consequent changes in nest/chamber temperature should be measured.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102667,92,NA,NA,102667,Microclimate; Energy expenditure; Metabolic rate; Mus musculus
article,How repeatable is CT<sub>max</sub> within individual brook trout over short- and long-time intervals?,"O'Donnell, M. J. and Regish, A. M. and McCormick, S. D. and Letcher, B. H.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"As stream temperatures increase due to factors such as heated runoff from impervious surfaces, deforestation, and climate change, fish species adapted to cold water streams are forced to move to more suitable habitat, acclimate or adapt to increased thermal regimes, or die. To estimate the potential for adaptation, a (within individual) repeatable metric of thermal tolerance is imperative. Critical thermal maximum (CTmax) is a dynamic test that is widely used to measure thermal tolerance across many taxa and has been used in fishes for decades, but its repeatability in most species is unknown. CTmax tests increase water temperature steadily over time until loss of equilibrium (LOE) is achieved. To determine if CTmax is a consistent metric within individual fish, we measured CTmax on the same lab-held individually-marked adult brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis at three different times (August \& September 2016, September 2017). We found that CTmax is a repeatable trait (Repeatability +/- S.E.: 0.48 +/- 0.14). CTmax of individuals males was consistent over time, but the CTmax of females increased slightly over time. This result indicates that CTmax is a robust, repeatable estimate of thermal tolerance in a cold-water adapted fish.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102559,89,NA,NA,102559,NA
article,Dietary effects on pelage emissivity in mammals: Implications for infrared thermography,"McGowan, Natasha E. and Scantlebury, David M. and Cowan, Elaine and Burch, Kerry J. and Maule, Aaron G. and Marks, Nikki J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Infrared thermography is becoming popular to measure animal surface temperature non-invasively. However, its application in quantitative mammal research is restricted by a paucity of pelage emissivity measurements, which are necessary to acquire accurate temperature readings. Furthermore, the factors influencing pelage emissivity remain largely unknown. We therefore examined the putative links between diet (fat content), hair length, hair diameter, and pelage emissivity in laboratory mice. Individuals maintained on high-fat diets had higher pelage emissivity values than those on standard diets, which may be due to fur being oily and/or the fact that the fur clumped together, exposing the skin underneath. Alternatively, the chemical composition of the fur of individuals on a high-fat diet may vary from those on a standard diet. We found no significant relationships between various hair metrics and emissivity. This study highlights that aspects of an animal's life history (e.g. age, sex, diet) may contribute to the emissivity of its pelage. As such, a single emissivity value may be inappropriate for use in infrared thermography across all species or individuals; other aspects of an animal's biology, which may affect emissivity, should also be considered. Best practice should involve measuring emissivity for every individual animal used in thermography studies.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102516,88,NA,NA,102516,Emissivity; Diet; Infrared thermography; Mammal; Pelage

K. and Al Wakeel, Rasha A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"This study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary GABA supplementation on blood biochemical parameters, the overall growth performance, and the relative mRNA expression of some FI- regulating genes in broiler chickens. A total of 192, three-day old chicks of mixed sex from two commercial broiler strains (Ross 308 and Cobb 500) were distributed into 2 groups; a control group and GABA-supplemented group (100 mg/kg diet). When the chicks reached 21 days of age, each group of each strain was randomly subdivided into two subgroups: one was exposed to HS (33 +/- 2 degrees C for 5 h/day for 2 weeks), while the other remained at thermoneutral temperature (24 degrees C). GABA significantly improved bird growth performance under normal and HS conditions, by increasing body weight (BW), weight gain (WG), and FI and significantly reduced the elevated body temperature of birds under HS. GABA supplementation increased FI by reducing the mRNA expression levels of FI-inhibiting neuropeptides, such as POMC, leptin, Ghrelin, and CCK, during HS and by increasing the expression of FI-stimulating neuropeptides such as AgRP and NPY. Moreover, GABA significantly altered FAS and ACC gene expression, resulting in significant increases in abdominal fat content in birds reared normally. In contrast, GABA lowered fat content in Cobb birds and increased it in Ross birds under HS. Therefore, GABA (100 mg/kg diet) is a strong FI-stimulating neurotransmitter and its regulatory effects depend on broiler strain and housing temperature.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.004,84,NA,164-175,NA,Gamma aminobutyric acid; Heat stress; Feed intake; Broiler; Hypothalamic neuropeptides
article,Alteration in bile acids profile in Large White pigs during chronic heat exposure,"Fang, Wei and Wen, Xiaobin and Meng, Qingshi and Wu, Weida and Everaert, Nadia and Xie, Jingjing and Zhang, Hongfu",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Bile acids (BAs) are critical for cholesterol homeostasis and new roles in metabolism and endocrinology have been demonstrated recently. It remains unknown whether BA metabolism can be affected by heat stress (HS). The objective of this study was to describe the shifts in serum, hepatic and intestinal BA profiles induced by chronic HS. Twenty-seven Large White pigs weighing 40.8 +/- 2.7 kg were assigned to one of the three treatments: a control group (CON, 23 degrees C), a HS group (33 degrees C), or a pair-fed group (PF, 23 degrees C and fed the same amount as HS group) for 21 d. The concentrations of taurine-conjugated BAs (TUDCA and THDCA in serum and TCDCA, TUDCA, THDCA and THCA in liver) were decreased in HS and PF pigs. However, in HS pigs, a reduction in taurine-conjugated BAs (TCBA) correlated with decreased liver genes expression of BA synthesis, conjugation and uptake transport. BA regulated-genes (FXR, TGR5 and FGFR4) in HS pigs and TGR5, FGFR4 and KL beta in PF pigs were down-regulated in liver. In ileum, total BAs and glycoursodeoxycholic acid concentrations were higher in HS pigs than other groups and PF group, respectively (P < 0.05). TCBA (P = 0.01) and tauroursodeoxycholic acid (P < 0.01) were decreased in PF group. BA transporters (OST alpha and MRP3) were up regulated in HS pigs compared with CON and PF pigs, respectively (P < 0.01). In cecum, ursodeoxycholic acid was higher in HS (P = 0.02) group than CON group. The expression of apical sodium-coupled bile acid transporter (P = 0.04) was lower in HS pigs than CON pigs, while OST beta (P < 0.01) was greater in HS group than PF group.

article,Thermoneutral temperature reduces liver volume but increases fat content in a mammalian hibernator,"Wang, Xingyi and Watt, Christine F. and Sinclair, Kevin J. and McKenzie, Charles A. and Staples, James F. and MacCannell, Amanda D. V.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Hibernators survive challenging winters by entering torpor, which lowers body temperature (T-b) to similar to 5 degrees C for 12-14 days, followed by spontaneous arousals where T-b increases to similar to 37 degrees C for 10-12 h before entering another torpor bout. This T-b cycle is accompanied by significant fluctuations in metabolic rate. Little is known about the role of the liver in lipid metabolism during hibernation. In this study we measured the effect of ambient temperature on liver volume and lipid content in 13-lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus). We housed animals at thermoneutral (25 degrees C) or cold (5 degrees C) ambient temperatures, with the same photoperiod (12 h light:12 h dark) for an entire year. We determined volume and water-fat ratio of the liver using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ambient temperature significantly affected both liver volume and fat content. From October to August squirrels housed at 25 degrees C had 25\% smaller livers compared to the squirrels housed at 5 degrees C, but their average lipid content (13.3\%) was 37\% higher. Because the squirrels housed at 25 degrees C appeared to continue feeding throughout the winter but did not enter extended torpor, more carbohydrates may have been diverted to lipid stores. By contrast, animals housed at 5 degrees C did not appear to feed, and carbohydrates would likely be preferentially stored in the liver as glycogen to supply glucose for brain metabolism. These results suggest that the fat burden caused by hibernators preparing for winter can lead to symptoms of metabolic syndrome, but that these symptoms are reversible in the spring.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.05.015,83,NA,172-177,NA,MRI; Hibernation; Lipid; Ground squirrel; Ictidomys

Collembola belonged to four categories - trogloxene, subtroglophile, eutroglophile and troglobiont - with a different degree of affinity to subterranean habitats. Altogether, specimens of 17 species were exposed to a one-hour laboratory survival test. The impact of temperature, species and species-temperature interaction on cold and heat survival was statistically significant. There was a decrease trend in cold and heat tolerance from trogloxenes, over subtroglophiles and eutroglophiles to troglobionts. It was shown that obligate cave species, restricted to climatic-stable cave conditions, retain a functional thermal resistance, i.e. the genetically determined ability to tolerate relatively broader temperature ranges. Our results outlined the direct relationship between the thermal tolerances of species and the size of their geographic distributions. It was also observed that cold resistance of Collembola decreased significantly with increasing species body length, indicating that body size plays an important role in temperature tolerances of arthropods inhabiting soil and subterranean habitats.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.11.004,78,NA,391-400,NA,Lethal temperature; Thermal resistance; Survival; Cave; Troglobiont; Body size; Endemic species; Arthropoda
article,Seasonal energetics and torpor use in North American flying squirrels,"Olson, Megan N. and Bowman, Jeff and Burness, Gary",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Seasonal cold temperatures require mammals to use morphological, behavioural, or physiological traits to survive periods of extreme cold and food shortage. Torpor is a physiological state that minimizes energy requirements by decreasing resting metabolic rate (MR) and body temperature (T-b). Many rodent species are capable of torpor, however, evidence in northern and southern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus and Glaucomys volans, respectively) has remained anecdotal. We experimentally attempted to induce torpor in wild caught flying squirrels by lowering ambient temperature (T-a) and measuring MR using open-flow respirometry. We also studied seasonal differences in MR and T-b at various T-a. Both MR and T-b provided evidence for torpor in flying squirrels, but only infrequent, shallow torpor. MR decreased infrequently and any decreases were rarely sustained for longer than one hour. We found a significant positive relationship between T-a and T-b only in G. volans, which suggests that G. volans is more susceptible to low T-a compared with G. sabrinus, possibly due to their small body size. We observed no substantive seasonal or interspecific differences in the relation between MR and T-a, with the exception that northern flying squirrels expended more energy at cold T-a during warm season trials than other species-season combinations. The infrequency of torpor use in our experiments suggests that other energy-saving strategies, such as social thermoregulation, may limit the reliance on torpor in this lineage.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.10.006,70,B,46-53,NA,Torpor; Northern flying squirrel; Southern flying squirrel; Respirometry; Metabolic rate; Body temperature

P.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature affects the physiology and life-history of ectothermic animals, often increasing metabolic rate and decreasing body size. Oxygen limitation has been put forward as a mechanism to explain thermal responses of body size and the ability to survive stress. However the time-scales involved in growth performance and heat tolerance differ radically. In order to increase our understanding of oxygen and temperature effects on body size and heat tolerance and the time scale involved, we reared Lymnaea stagnalis under six combinations of temperature and oxygen tension from hatching up to an age of 300 days and recorded shell length during this whole period. At the end of this period, we determined scope for growth by measuring food intake rate, assimilation efficiency, respiration rate and ammonium excretion rate at two different temperatures. We also measured the snails' ability to survive heat stress (CTmax), both at normoxia and hypoxia. We found that scope for growth and long term growth performance were much more affected by interactions of chronic oxygen and temperature conditions during rearing than by acute conditions during testing. Furthermore, our study shows that individual variation in growth performance can be traced back to individual differences in rates of food and oxygen consumption. Developmental acclimation also gave rise to differences in CTmax, but these were relatively small and were only expressed when CTmax was tested under hypoxia. The large effects of rearing oxygen conditions on growth and other physiological rates compared to modest effects of test oxygen conditions on CTmax suggest that small effects of hypoxia on the short term (e.g. heat tolerance) may nevertheless have large repercussions on the long term (e.g. growth and reproduction), even in a pulmonate snail that can compensate for hypoxia to some extent by aerial respiration.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.11.017,68,A,27-38,NA,Lymnaea stagnalis; Oxygen limitation; Temperature acclimation; Scope for growth; CTmax; Individual variation
article,Is the temperature-size rule mediated by oxygen in aquatic ectotherms?,"Hoefnagel, K. Natan and Verberk, Wilco C. E. P.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature is an important environmental factor that influences key traits like body size, growth rate and maturity. Ectotherms reared under high temperatures usually show faster growth, but reach a smaller final size, a phenomenon known as the temperature-size rule (TSR). Oxygen may become a limiting resource at high temperatures, when demand for oxygen is high, especially in water as oxygen uptake is far more challenging under water than in air. Therefore, in aquatic ectotherms, the TSR might very well be mediated by temperature effects on oxygen availability and oxygen demand. To distinguish between the direct effects of temperature and oxygen mediated effects, growth rate and final size were measured in the aquatic ectotherm Asellus aquaticus (Linnaeus, 1758) reared under different temperature and oxygen conditions in a factorial design. Growth could be best described by a modified Von Bertalanffy growth function. Both temperature and oxygen affected age at maturity and growth. Growth responses to temperature were dependent on oxygen conditions (interactive effect of temperature and oxygen). Only under hypoxic conditions, when oxygen was mast limiting, did we find a classic TSR. Moreover, when comparing treatments differing in temperature, but where the balance between oxygen demand and supply was similar, high temperature increased both growth rate and final size. Thus effects of oxygen may resolve the life-history puzzle of the TSR in aquatic ectotherms. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Michael H. and Zhang, Yuanyuan",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of mild hyperthermia on cell viability, release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) formation, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and the relative mRNA levels of heat shock protein (HSP60, 70, and 90) in hepatic cells of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) before and after temperature stress. Cultured cells were exposed to thermal stress (32 degrees C) for 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 h. The results showed that hyperthermia stress significantly reduced cell viability (P < 0.01) and increased LDH release at 0.5 and 1 h (P < 0.05). Additionally, hyperthermia stress led to oxidative stress as evidenced by significantly decreased T-AOC after treating cells for 0.5 and 8 h (P < 0.05). SOD activity also significantly decreased after 1 h of stress (P < 0.05), but MDA formation increased after 8 h of stress (P < 0.05). This may be partly responsible for the lower cell viability and higher LDH release we observed. The differences between SOD activity, MDA formation, and T-AOC between the 2 h treatment group and the control were smaller than that of other groups. This indicated that cellular antioxidant enzyme systems play an important role in the defense against oxidative stress. Further tests showed that the expression of HSP60 at 1, 2, and 4 h (P < 0.05), HSP70 at 0.5 and 1 h (P < 0.01). and HSP90 at all time points after stress were higher (P < 0.01) than prestress levels. This suggested that HSPs possess the ability to modulate cellular anti-stress responses and play key roles in protecting organisms from heat stress. In conclusion, hyperthermia inhibits cell proliferation, induces cell oxidative stress, and enhances HSP expression in hepatic cells of grass carp.

These may differ in shape depending on developmental thermal conditions (e.g. constant vs. fluctuating) and other factors such as life-stages. Here, we conducted an extensive comparative study of the thermal reaction norms for development and viability in the invasive fly, Drosophila suzukii , under constant and fluctuating thermal regimes. Flies, were submitted to 15 different constant temperatures (CT) ranging from 8 to 35 degrees C. We compared responses under CT with patterns observed under 15 different fluctuating temperature (FT) regimes. We tested several equations for thermal performance curves and compared various models to obtain thermal limits and degree-day estimations. To validate the model `s predictions, the phenology was monitored in two artificial field-like conditions and two natural conditions in outdoor cages during spring and winter. Thermal reaction norm for viability from egg to pupa was broader than that from egg to adult. FT conditions yielded a broader thermal breadth for viability than CT, with a performance extended towards the colder side, consistent with our field observations in winter. Models resulting from both CT and FT conditions made accurate predictions of degree-day as long as the temperature remained within the linear part of the developmental rate curve. Under cold artificial and natural winter conditions, a model based on FT data made more accurate predictions. Model based on CT failed to predict adult `s emergence in winter. We also document the first record of development and adult emergence throughout winter in D. suzukii . Population dynamics models in D. suzukii are all based on summer phenotype and CT.

We determined glycogen, lipids and proteins levels, and cellular energy allocation (CEA) as a valuable marker of exposure to stress, which integrates available energy (Ea) and energy consumption (Ec). Metabolic patterns and aerobic oxidation potential were based on the determination of glucose transporter (GLU), carnitine transporter (CTP), L-lactate dehydrogenase (L-LDH), citrate synthase (CS), cytochrome C oxidase subunit IV isoform 1 (COX1) and 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (HOAD) relative gene expression. To integrate metabolic patterns and gene expression, L-LDH, CS, COX and HOAD activities were also determined. For further estimation of biological stores oxidized during seasonal acclimatization, we determined the blood levels of glucose, lipids and lactate. The results indicated seasonal changes in energy content, different patterns in gene expression and reorganization of metabolic patterns during cool acclimatization with increased lipid oxidation. During warm acclimatization, however, energy consumption was mostly based on carbohydrates oxidation. The decrease of Ec and COX1 activity in the warm exposed heart seem to be consistent with the OCLTT hypothesis, suggesting that the heart may be one of the first organs to be limited during seasonal warming.

Results: Post immersion, heart rate increased (Delta 31bpm, P < 0.001, d = 1.38), mean arterial blood pressure decreased (Delta 16 mmHg, P < 0.001, d = -0.66), with no difference between conditions. Blood flow and mean shear rate increased following immersion (P < 0.001, Delta 362 ml/min, d = 1.20 and Delta 108 s(-1), d = 1.00), but these increases were blunted in the Air Jet condition (P < 0.001,Delta 171 ml/min, d = 0.43 and Delta 52 s(-1), d = 0.52). Anxiety and salivary cortisol were reduced (P = 0.003, d = -0.20, P = 0.014, d = -0.11), but did not vary between conditions. Enjoyment did not vary between conditions. Conclusion: These data demonstrate positive acute responses to hot water immersion on markers of cardiovascular function, anxiety, and stress. There was no additional benefit of water-based massage, while air-based massage blunted some positive vascular responses due to lower heat conservation of the water.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103858,121,NA,NA,103858,Passive heating; Hot water immersion; Massage; Health benefits
article,Enhancing physiological recovery and subsequent exercise performance in the heat using a phase-change material cooling blanket,"Wang, Xin and Lai, Bin and Yan, Rui and Li, Yan and Ning, Bo and Wang, Qian",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"This study aimed to assess the effect of a phase-change material (PCM) cooling blanket for cooling between exercise bouts on recovery of physiological parameters and subsequent exercise performance in the heat. Eighteen male volunteers were recruited to participate in human trials involving two exhaustive treadmill running bouts (Bout1 for 3 km and Bout2 for 1.5 km) in a climate chamber (temperature = 33 degrees C; relative humidity = 40\%). Participants were randomly subjected to one of two cooling conditions for a 10-min period between exercise bouts: CON: natural cooling; 10-min PCM: with a PCM cooling blanket for 10 min. Several physiological parameters including mean skin temperature (T-skin), oral temperature (T-oral), core temperature (T-core), heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), respiratory rate (RR), peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), average running speed and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale score were analyzed. The results showed that compared to the CON group, participants in the 10-min PCM group had a significant lower T-skin, T-core, HR and RR at post-cooling, as well as greater reductions in mean skin temperature (Delta T-skin) and core temperature (Delta T-core) from post-Bout1 to post-cooling. Additionally, the 10-min PCM group exhibited significantly lower peak T-core, peak HR and RPE scale score during Bout2, while the average running speed during Bout2 was significantly higher. The present study suggests that cooling with a PCM cooling blanket can enhance physiological recovery and subsequent exercise performance in the heat.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103810,119,NA,NA,103810,Phase-change material; Cooling blanket; Core temperature; Physiological recovery; Subsequent exercise performance
article,Thermal threshold and interspecific competition help explain intertidal hermit crab assemblages,"Garcia-Cardenas, Eduardo Everardo and Burciaga, Luis M. and Alcaraz, Guillermina",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Habitat heterogeneity promotes species diversity by providing a variety of abiotic and biotic conditions, whose impact on performance varies among species. Then, mobile species would be expected to move to areas whose conditions maximize their fitness. However, biotic pressures such as interspecific competition can push subordinate species into suboptimal areas, impeding this matching. The tropical hermit crab Clibanarius albidigitus occupies mostly upper intertidal sites where they can experience extreme environmental conditions. Meanwhile, its stronger agonistic competitor, Calcinus californiensis, mostly inhabits more moderate conditions at the mid intertidal. We estimated the avoidance threshold of the two hermit crab species to increasing water temperatures to help explain their intertidal distribution. We also compared the avoidance threshold of Cli. albidigitus to rising temperatures when presented alone and in the presence of chemical cues of its competitor to assess potential competitive niche exclusion. The avoidance threshold was measured in experimental tanks with a ramp that led from the water to an air-exposed platform; the threshold was defined as the temperature at which individuals emerged and remained air-exposed. Clibanarius albidigitus emerged at a higher temperature than its competitor, showing a higher thermal tolerance and potentially explaining its distribution in the upper intertidal. In the presence of Cal. californiensis, Cli. albidigitus emerged at lower temperature than when alone, likely as a strategy to reduce competition with stronger agonistic competitors, even at the cost of coping with harsh conditions. Our results support the hypothesis that competitive habitat exclusion contributes to explaining hermit crab assemblages.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103728,118,NA,NA,103728,Evaporative cooling; Habitat exclusion; Interspecific competition; Thermoregulation; Tolerance
article,Carbohydrate ingestion attenuates the reduction in complex cognitive function and cerebral blood flow during prolonged passive heat stress in humans,"Deming, Nathan and Steer, Sarah and Hernandez, Jesse and Dinenno, Frank and Richards, Jennifer",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Purpose: To determine whether carbohydrate ingestion would reduce cognitive dysfunction in humans following long duration passive heat stress (PHS) versus consuming electrolytes alone.Methods: Fifteen young (27 +/- 4 y) healthy adults were exposed to 120 min of PHS through the use of a liquid perfused suit (50 degrees C) on two randomized visits. Subjects consumed fluids supplemented with electrolytes (E) or electrolytes + carbohydrates (E + C). Pre- and post-heat stress, body mass (BM) and plasma osmolality (pOsm) were measured. Heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), Physiological Strain Index (PSI), core temperature (T-c), plasma glucose, respiration rate (RR), end-tidal CO2 (PetCO(2)) and internal carotid artery (ICA) blood flow were recorded at baseline and every 15 min of heat stress. Cognitive function was assessed via the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metric at baseline and at 30- and 120 min during heat stress.Results: There were no significant differences between fluid conditions for BM, pOsm, PSI, T-c, RR or PetCO(2). Plasma glucose was similar to 75\% greater in the E + C condition compared to the E condition after 90 min of PHS (P < 0.05). Cognitive function (120 min) was impaired following PHS only in E condition (P < 0.05) and performance on complex cognitive tasks were better by similar to 22-340\% in the E + C vs. E (P < 0.05). Compared to the E condition, HR and BP were lower and ICA blood flow, vascular conductance, and glucose delivery was similar to 90\% greater in the E + C after 90 min of PHS (P < 0.05).Conclusions: These data are the first to demonstrate that carbohydrate ingestion may have a protective effect on cognitive function during long duration PHS.

article,Experimental study on dynamic thermal responses and comfortable evaluations under bathing conditions,"Luo, Maohui and Xu, Shuang and Tang, Yin and Yu, Hang and Zhou, Xiang",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"This study investigated the dynamic thermal responses and comfortable boundaries under different bathing conditions through a series of human subject experiments. Eleven subjects' subjective questionnaires and physiological parameters were collected. During the 40-min 40 degrees C bath, subjects' whole-body thermal sensation, sweating sensation, and fatigue relieving vote increased from 0 (neutral) to 2.6 (near `hot' sensation), 3.5 (near `very sweaty' sensation), and 1.6 (near `relieved' vote), respectively. Thermal comfort vote firstly increased to 1.5 (near `comfortable' sensation) in the first 10 min, then decreased to-0.5 (between `neutral and slightly uncomfortable' sensation), and eventually remained around 1.1 ('slightly comfortable' sensation) after the bath. After the 40-min bath, the skin temperature and core temperature rose by 2.0 degrees C and 0.9 degrees C respectively. The mean heart rate increased by 45\% and blood pressure decreased in most subjects. The percentage of \& beta; brain wave (representing concentration emotion) decreased while that of \& delta; brain wave (representing relaxing emotion) increased, indicating that the bathed subjects tended to be more relaxed and sleeping emotionally. Based on these observations, we inferred that bathing thermal comfort can be influenced by multiple factors simulta-neously but effective evaluation tools quantifying bathing thermal comfort are yet to be produced. Compared with showering, bathing usually induces more intensive thermal stress to the body, causing similar changing patterns but stronger amplitudes in subjective and physiological responses. These results can provide references for more comfortable and healthier bathroom environment design and relevant environmental conditioning products.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103621,115,NA,NA,103621,Bathing thermal comfort; Bathroom environment; Dynamic thermal response; Human factor

Concern remains that this frog will continue to expand its range and invade higher elevation habitats where much of the island's endemic species are found. We determined whether coqui thermal tolerance and physiology change along Hawai'i's elevational gradients. We measured physiological responses using a short-term experiment to determine baseline tolerance and physiology by elevation, and a long-term experiment to determine the coqui's ability to acclimate to different temperatures. We collected frogs from low, medium, and high elevations. After both the short and long-term experiments, we measured critical thermal minimum (CTmin), blood glucose, oxidative stress, and corticosterone levels. CTmin was lower in high elevation frogs than low elevation frogs after the short acclimation experiment, signifying that they acclimate to local conditions. After the extended acclimation, CTmin was lower in frogs acclimated to cold temperatures compared to warm-acclimated frogs and no longer varied by elevation. Blood glucose levels were positively correlated with elevation even after the extended acclimation, suggesting glucose may also be related to lower temperatures. Oxidative stress was higher in females than males, and corticosterone was not significantly related to any pre-dictor variables. The extended acclimation experiment showed that coquis can adjust their thermal tolerance to different temperatures over a 3-week period, suggesting the expansion of coqui into higher elevation habitats may still be possible, and they may not be as restricted by cold temperatures as previously thought.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103590,114,NA,NA,103590,Corticosterone; Coqui frog; CTmin; Elevation; Glucose; Oxidative stress

Here, we characterise the presence of daily rhythms of thermal prefer-ence in two phylogenetically distant and well-studied fish species: the zebrafish (Danio rerio), an experimental model, and the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), an aquaculture species. We created a non-continuous tem-perature gradient using multichambered tanks according to the natural environmental range for each species. Each species was allowed to freely choose their preferred temperature during the 24h cycle over a long-term period. Both species displayed strikingly consistent temporal daily rhythms of thermal preference with higher temperatures being selected during the second half of the light phase and lower temperatures at the end of the dark phase, with mean acrophases at Zeitgeber Time (ZT) 5.37 h (zebrafish) and ZT 12.5 h (tilapia). Interestingly, when moved to the experimental tank, only tilapia displayed consistent preference for higher temperatures and took longer time to establish the thermal rhythms. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating both light-driven daily rhythm and thermal choice to refine our understanding of fish biology and improve the management and welfare of the diversity of fish species used in research and food production.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103544,113,NA,NA,103544,Zebrafish; Nile Tilapia; Temperature preference; Daily rhythms; Thermal ecology; Stress induced hyperthermia
article,Assessment of chronic limb threatening ischemia using thermal imaging,"Pakarinen, Tomppa and Joutsen, Atte and Oksala, Niku and Vehkaoja, Antti",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Objectives: Current chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI) diagnostics require expensive equipment, using ionizing radiation or contrast agents, or summative surrogate methods lacking in spatial information. Our aim is to develop and improve contactless, non-ionizing and cost-effective diagnostic methods for CLTI assessment with high spatial accuracy by utilizing dynamic thermal imaging and the angiosome concept.Approach: Dynamic thermal imaging test protocol was suggested and implemented with a number of computa-tional parameters. Pilot data was measured from 3 healthy young subjects, 4 peripheral artery disease (PAD) patients and 4 CLTI patients. The protocol consists of clinical reference measurements, including ankle-and toe -brachial indices (ABI, TBI), and a modified patient bed for hydrostatic and thermal modulation tests. The data was analyzed using bivariate correlation.Results: The thermal recovery time constant was on average higher for the PAD (88\%) and CLTI (83\%) groups with respect to the healthy young subjects. The contralateral symmetry was high for the healthy young group and low for the CLTI group. The recovery time constants showed high negative correlation to TBI (rho =-0.73) and ABI (rho =-0.60). The relation of these clinical parameters to the hydrostatic response and absolute temperatures (|rho| <0.3) remained unclear.Conclusion: The lack of correlation for absolute temperatures or their contralateral differences with the clinical status, ABI and TBI disputes their use in CLTI diagnostics. Thermal modulation tests tend to augment the signs of thermoregulation deficiencies and accordingly high correlations were found with all reference metrics. The method is promising for establishing the connection between impaired perfusion and thermography.

article,Impact of spraying eggs with betaine after exposure to short-term thermal stress during early embryogenesis on pre and post-hatch performance of Japanese quail,"Abuoghaba, Ahmed Abdel-Kareem and Abdelfattah, Mostafa Galal and Ali, Fatma and Abdelwahab, Amira Ahmed Mohamed",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"It is essential to understand and manage environmental factors for good quail production and welfare. One of the most important environmental stressors that hinder quail productivity is heat stress. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of spraying Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) eggs with betaine after exposure to short-term high temperature during early embryogenesis on pre and post-hatch performance of quail. A total of 750 eggs were equally divided into two groups. Eggs in the first group were incubated at normal incubation temperature (37.5 degrees C/NIT), while those in the second group were incubated at high incubation temperature (39.0 degrees C/HIT) for 3 h daily from day 4-6 of incubation. Eggs in both groups were subjected to five treatments, NC (negative control), PC sprayed distilled water (positive control), while B0.5, B1, and B2 treatments were sprayed with distilled water supplemented with 500, 1000, and 2000 mg betaine/L, respectively. The chick weight at hatch, slaughter weight, and first egg weight was significantly impaired by the HIT treatment. The HIT group revealed a significant increase in cloacal temperature, H/L ratio, liver enzymes, triglyceride, and cholesterol and a significant decrease in hatchability, T3 hormone, and blood protein levels than the NIT group. Regarding betaine effects, the embryonic mortality rates, hatchability, hatched chick weight, and oviduct percentage in groups treated with 1000 or 2000 mg betaine/L were significantly improved compared with the control. Also, spraying betaine at 1000 or 2000 mg/L significantly increased blood protein and triiodothyronine (T3) hormone levels and significantly decrease liver enzyme levels and total feed consumption compared with the untreated group. The right/total ventricle ratio (RV/TV) of quail in HIT group was significantly increased, while betaine treatment significantly decreased this ratio. Considering these results, it is strongly suggested that spraying of betaine on eggs at 2000 mg/L optimizes Japanese quail performance.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103427,111,NA,NA,103427,Japanese quail; Betaine; Thermal stress; Early embryogenesis; Reproduction

While gene expression and protein abundance changes underlie compensatory responses, little is known about the role of post-translational mod-ifications as thermal tolerance mechanisms. To test the hypothesis that protein phosphorylation changes in response to thermal acclimation, we studied the phosphoproteome of the freshwater planarian Crenobia alpina. This species has a supposedly limited thermal tolerance and is found in cold-stable habitats. We systematically investigated phosphopeptide abundances following 168 h acclimation to 11, 14, 17, and 20 degrees C, using label-free quantitative phosphoproteomics. We provide a comparative analysis of 2115 phosphosites from 1049 phos-phoproteins, whereby little to no differences could be observed between 11, 14, and 17 degrees C. However, more than 130 phosphopeptides were significantly more abundant and 40 were less abundant following acclimation to 20 degrees C. These phosphoproteins were functionally associated with the regulation of neuronal processes, cilia, DNA damage repair, aquaporins, and mitochondrial fission and fusion. These data support the hypothesis that phosphorylation plays a role in thermal acclimation responses, suggesting that PTMs are of significance in invertebrate thermal acclimation. PTMs may therefore offer an alternative route of transient protein adaptation to temperature increase in invertebrates, and should not be neglected when trying to understand how molecular system dynamics in response to elevated temperatures.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103367,110,NA,NA,103367,Planarian; Thermal acclimation; Freshwater; Phosphoproteomics; Phosphorylation; Post-translational modification

To reveal the mechanism through which heatstroke leads to intestinal epithelial injury, the relationship between reactive oxygen species (ROS), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and lysosomes were studied in intestinal epithelial cells subjected to heat stress. Cells of heat stress groups were incubated at 43 degrees C for 1 h, then incubated at 37 degrees C as indicated. Control group cells were incubated at 37 degrees C. Cell-counting kit-8 assay was used to assess cell viability. Cells were labeled with 2 `-7 ` dichlorofluorescin diacetate and acridine orange (AO) staining, respectively, the total ROS and AO were detected by confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry. Apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry using annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/prodium iodide staining, the expressions of mitogen-activated protein kinases were detected by western blotting.

article,Analysis of thermocouple-based finger contact temperature measurements,"Rykaczewski, Konrad and Dhanote, Tanmay",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The understanding of heat conduction during finger contact with cooler or hotter objects is important for designing many electronic devices and for setting safety standards in a variety of occupational settings. In the most common experimental approach to study this process, a micro-thermocouple is placed at the finger-object interface. However, the interpretation of what this measurement corresponds to is not clear. To this end, we develop a three-dimensional thermal simulation of the finger-thermocouple-substrate configuration. The model predictions match finger cooling measurements in eight distinct cases available in prior literature (finger pressed with 1 N or 9.8 N against a steel or an aluminum substrate held at-2 degrees C or-10 degrees C). We demonstrate that the thermocouple can be represented accurately as a truncated sphere with emerging cylindrical wires while a multilayer block model of the finger provides similar results to an anatomically representative model. Our simulations show that in the eight previously studied cooling cases, the average surface temperature of skin that is in contact with the substrate follows nearly the same but offset cooling trend as the thermocouple tip tem-perature. The value of the offset is predominantly determined by the substrate material, with the thermocouple tip temperature being lower than the average skin surface temperature by 1-5 degrees C and 3-10 degrees C for steel and aluminum substrate cases, respectively. This temperature difference results in a moderate to an extreme ther-mocouple underprediction of the time necessary for the skin surface to reach the experimental safety threshold of 1 degrees C. Consequently, from the perspective of the safety related applications the thermocouple measurement provides a conservative limit on the contact duration and thereby is suitable for such purposes, but for appli-cations requiring accurate skin temperature measurements alternative experimental approaches should be used.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103293,108,NA,NA,103293,Skin contact cooling; Thermocouple measurements; Thermal injury; Finger modeling

Out of different density-independent factors, surface air temperature majorly affects the incidence and damage of the H. armigera on the crops. Early prediction of H. armigera generations (voltinism) in future climate years perhaps prevent additional damage in various crops and improve the farmers preparedness. In this study, future climate data that is temperature obtained for eleven Agro-Climatic Zones (ACZs) of India under four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenarios in different climate years (2010, 2030, 2050, 2070, 2090) using weather file generator MarkSim web application. The accumulation of Growing Degree-days (GDD) by H. armigera at eleven ACZs in each climate year under different RCP scenarios was estimated using temperature data. The mean surface air temperature is predicted to 0.51 ?, 1.03 ?, 1.57 ? and 2.1 ? in climate years 2030, 2050, 2070 and 2090, which escalated annual H. armigera Gen. to 12.88, 13.33, 13.79 and 14.23, respectively over the baseline climate year 2010. Likewise, under RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5 scenarios H. armigera Gen. is predicted to 12.86, 13.29, 13.23 and 13.97 per annum with mean surface air temperatures 27.4 ?, 27.92 ?, 27.86 ? and 28.72 ?, respectively.

The study was carried out in a CBP located in the Zona da Mata region, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The geostatistical modeling technique evaluated the variables of temperature, moisture content, and pH (on the surface and depth of 0.20m) across the length of the bed. Bed samples were characterized for carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and C:N ratio. Cows housed in the CBP were assessed for locomotion and hygiene scores and average milk production. To evaluate the thermoregulation of the cows, the respiratory rate (RR) and surface temperature (ST) were measured. Geostatistical analysis showed spatial dependence and the non-uniformity of the spatial distribution of bed variables. The worst levels of bed temperature and moisture were found in the regions close to the evaporative cooling plate, surrounding the feeding alley, and in the region with the highest cow stocking. The C:N ratio, obtained in both climatic seasons of the year, remained outside the recommended range for ideal composting. During the summer and winter, the bed variables' values suggest that the material was below levels for optimal composting; however, the aerated inner layer was biologically active. The high animal density significantly impacted the worsening of the bed moisture content and internal temperature. In general, dairy cows showed adequate hygiene (score of 1 and 2) and locomotion (score of 0 and 1) scores for the two climatic seasons evaluated, indicating good welfare conditions. In relation to RR and ST, the summer period presented less favorable environmental conditions.

Re-establishment of C. seguenzae populations in the depleted habitats requires knowledge of its biology and breeding in captivity. Temperature has been recorded to affect the development in marine gastropods. The present study aims to describe the encapsulated development and study the effect of three temperature regimes, that the embryos are exposed to in the wild (17, 20, 23 degrees C), on it. At the stage of morula (7th Day After Deposition - DAD) 180 egg capsules were separated in three groups of 60 capsules. One group remained at 23 degrees C and the other two were acclimated at 20 and 17 degrees C. Two capsules were sampled randomly from each temperature setup (every day during the first 5 days, D1-D5, every other day from D7 to D17 and every other two days from D20 to eclosion), opened and the eggs, embryos or larvae were photographed under stereoscope. Stages of development and shape were assessed and dimensions were measured from microphotographs. All developmental stages were described in relation to temperature and time. At 23 degrees C eclosion of free swimming veligers occurred 49 DAD, 17 days faster than the embryonic development at 20 degrees C. Eclosion at 17 degrees C was not observed up until the 74th DAD when the last sampling was conducted. An increased amount of larval deformities was observed at 17 degrees C reaching 94\% during the last sampling (D74), while at eclosion only 4 and 3\% of the hatching larvae were deformed at 20 and 23 degrees C respectively.

Two experiments were conducted involving a total of 1080 juvenile Oreochromis niloticus, O. mossambicus, O. niloticus male x O.mossambicus female=F1 male x O.mossambicus female (Hybrid 1; H1) and O. mossambicus male x O. niloticus female (Hybrid 2; H2). In the 1st experiment, fish were exposed to cold water (12 degrees C) for 24 h and then hematological parameters, serum biochemical variables, innate immune responses, antioxidant status, and liver gene expression responses (hsp70, hsp27, hsp90, hsp40, cat, sod, eef1a1 and calreticulin) were analyzed. Hematological and serum biochemical responses involved species-specific differences. At optimal temperatures (28 degrees C), respiratory burts activity (RBA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) values of H1, H2 and O. mossambicus were significantly higher than O. niloticus (p< 0.05). While the RBAvalue of O. mossambicus decreased after exposure to cold water (p< 0.05), lysozyme activities of O. niloticus and H2 and MPO activities of all experimental fish increased significantly (p< 0.05). At control conditions (28 degrees C), cortisol levels were found to be higher in O. mossambicus than in H1 and O. niloticus (p< 0.05). A significant increase in cat and sod transcripts was observed in liver of fish being very pronounced in O. mossambicus and H2.

article,Thermal limits and preferences of large branchiopods (Branchiopoda: Anostraca and Spinicaudata) from temporary wetland arid zone systems,"Tladi, Murphy and Wasserman, Ryan J. and Cuthbert, Ross N. and Dalu, Tatenda and Nyamukondiwa, Casper",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Large branchiopods are specialist crustaceans adapted for life in temporary, thermally dynamic wetland ecosystems. Certain large branchiopod species are, however, restricted to specific temporary wetland types, exemplified by their physico-chemical and hydroperiod characteristics. Here, we contrasted the thermal preference and critical thermal maxima (CTmax) and minima (CTmin) of southern African anostracans and spinicaudatans found exclusively in either temporary rock-pool or pan wetland types. We hypothesized that environment of origin would be a good predictor of thermal preference and critical thermal limits. To test this, Branchiopodopsis tridens (Anostraca) and Leptestheria brevirostris (Spinicaudata) were collected from rock-pool habitats, while Streptocephalus cafer (Anostraca) and a Gondwanalimnadia sp. (Spinicaudata) were collected from pan habitats. In contrast to our hypothesis, taxonomic relatedness was a better predictor of CTmax and temperature preference than environment of origin. Spinicaudatans were significantly more tolerant of high temperatures than anostracans, with L. brevirostris and Gondwanalimnadia sp. median CTmax values of 45.1 degrees C and 44.1 degrees C, respectively, followed by S. cafer (42.8 degrees C) and B. tridens (41.4 degrees C). Neither environment or taxonomic relatedness were good predictors of CTmin trends, with B. tridens (0.9 degrees C) and Gondwanalimnadia sp. (2.1 degrees C) having the lowest median CTmin values, followed by L. brevirostris (3.4 degrees C) and S. cafer (3.6 degrees C). On the contrary, temperature preferences differed according to taxa, with spinicaudatans significantly preferring higher temperatures than anostracans. Leptestheria brevirostris and Gondwanalimnadia sp. both spent most time at temperatures 30-32 degrees C, S. cafer at 18-20 degrees C and B. tridens at 21-23 degrees C.

article,Plumage development and environmental factors influence surface temperature gradients and heat loss in wandering albatross chicks,"Stone, David W. and Gunn, Carrie and Nord, Andreas and Phillips, Richard A. and McCafferty, Dominic J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Young birds in cold environments face a range of age-specific thermal challenges. Studying the thermal biology of young birds throughout ontogeny may further our understanding of how such challenges are met. We investigated how age and environmental parameters influenced surface temperature gradients across various body regions of wandering albatross (Diomedea exulans) chicks on Bird Island, South Georgia. This study was carried out over a 200 d period during the austral winter, from the end of the brood-guard period until fledging, bridging a gap in knowledge of surface temperature variation and heat loss in developing birds with a long nestling stage in severe climatic conditions. We found that variation in surface temperature gradients (i.e. the difference between surface and environmental temperature) was strongly influenced by chick age effects for insulated body regions (trunk), with an increase in the surface temperature gradient that followed the progression of plumage development, from the second set of down (mesoptiles), to final chick feathers (teleoptiles). Environmental conditions (primarily wind speed and relative humidity) had a stronger influence on the gradients in uninsulated areas (eye, bill) than insulated regions, which we interpret as a reflection of the relative degree of homeothermy exhibited by chicks of a given age. Based on biophysical modelling, total heat loss of chicks was estimated to increase linearly with age. However, mass specific heat loss decreased during the early stages of growth and then subsequently increased. This was attributed to age-related changes in feather growth and activity that increased surface temperature and, hence, metabolic heat loss. These results provide a foundation for further work on the effects of environmental stressors on developing chicks, which are key to understanding the physiological responses of animals to changes in climate in polar regions.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102777,97,NA,NA,102777,Thermoregulation; Diomedea exulans; Development; Climate; Thermal imaging; Polar; Antarctic

It is hypothesized that differences in the aphids' seasonal activities might be related to their response to temperature extremes and different physiological mechanisms. To study the aphids' thermal tolerance variations and mode of their physiological basis, they were cold acclimated at 20, 15, 10, 5, and 0 degrees C for 168 h (7 days) and heat acclimated at 20, 25, 30 degrees C for 168 h and 35 degrees C for 48 h. At the end of each thermal regime, survival at low and high temperatures was determined, and changes in sugars and polyols and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) were investigated. D. noxia was more cold-tolerant, while A. gossypii was a more heat-tolerant insect. The type and pattern of sugars and polyols were similar in both species under cold acclimation (ACC) and heat acclimation (HCC). In both species, glucose and mannitol were the major identified compounds involved in cold and heat tolerance. However, they showed different patterns of Hsp70 level, with D. noxia having a higher level of Hsp70 under ACC and A. gossypii having a higher level of Hsp70 under HCC.

The factors underlying physiopathology of fibromyalgia are not well understood, complicating its diagnosis and management. Objectives: To evaluate the peripheral vascular blood flow of the skin of the hands and the core body temperature as indirect measures of sympathetic adrenergic activity of the nervous system and its relationship to nitric oxide levels (NO) in women with fibromyalgia compared with healthy controls. Methods: Forty-two women with fibromyalgia and 52 healthy women were enrolled in this observational pilot study. We used infrared thermography of the hands and an infrared dermal thermometer to evaluate the peripheral vascular blood flow and tympanic and axillary core body temperature, respectively. We measured NO levels using the ozone chemiluminescence-based method. Results: Two-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) showed that the tympanic (P=0.002) and hand temperatures were significantly higher in the patients with fibromyalgia than in the controls (P <= 0.001). Significant associations were also found between serum NO levels and minimum temperatures at the dorsal center of the dominant hand (beta=-3.501; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] -6.805, -0.198; P= 0.038), maximum temperature (beta=-5.594; 95\% CI -10.106, -1.081; P=0.016), minimum temperature (beta=-4.090; 95\% CI -7.905, -0.275; P=0.036), and mean temperature (beta=-5.519; 95\% CI -9.933, -1.106; P=0.015) of the center of the palm of the non-dominant hand, maximum temperature at the thenar eminence of the dominant hand (beta=-5.800; 95\% CI -10.508, -1.092; P=0.017), and tympanic temperature (beta=-9.321; 95\% CI -17.974, -0.669; P=0.035) in the controls.

However, the relationship between the environment and body temperature can be altered by morphology and ecology. In particular, body size and body shape can impact thermal inertia, as high surface area to volume ratios will possess low thermal mass. Habitat type can also influence thermal physiology by altering the opportunity for thermoregulation. We studied the thermal ecology and physiology of an elongate invertebrate, the bark centipede (Scolopocryptops sexspinosus). We characterized field body temperature and environmental temperature distributions, measured thermal tolerance limits, and constructed thermal performance curves for a population in southern Georgia. We found evidence that bark centipedes behaviorally thermoregulate, despite living in sheltered microhabitats, and that performance was maintained over a broad range of temperatures (over 20 degrees C). However, both the thermal optimum for performance and upper thermal tolerance were much higher than mean body temperature in the field. Together, these results suggest that centipedes can thermoregulate and maintain performance over a broad range of temperatures but are sensitive to extreme temperatures. More broadly, our results suggest that wide performance breadth could be an adaptation to thermal heterogeneity in space and time for a species with low thermal inertia.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102755,94,NA,NA,102755,Scolopendramorph; Thermal performance curve; Thermal tolerance; Microhabitat selection
article,Heat loss in sleeping garden warblers (Sylvia borin) during migration,"Ferretti, Andrea and Maggini, Ivan and Cardinale, Massimiliano and Fusani, Leonida",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"For small songbirds, energy is often a limiting factor during migration and, for this reason, they are forced to alternate nocturnal flights with stopovers to rest and replenish energy stores. Stopover duration has a key role for a successful migration and may have an important impact on fitness. Thus, migrants need to optimize their energy consumption at this stage to reduce their permanence at the site. A recent study has shown that lean individuals reduce their metabolic rate when tucking the head in the feathers during sleep. The underlying mechanism is very likely a reduction in conductance, but the thermoregulatory benefit of the increased insulation has never been quantified yet. Here, we compared heat loss in individual migratory birds while sleeping in different postures. Using a thermal camera and a within-individual approach, we estimated that Garden Warblers can reduce their rate of heat loss by 54\% by sleeping with the head tucked in the feathers. This energy saving has a relevant impact on the individual's energy balance because it can account for up to 8.69\% of daily energy expenditure during stopover. Our study provides novel and important information to understand the fundamental role of thermoregulatory strategies on bird's energy management.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102772,94,NA,NA,102772,Spring migration; Stopover; Thermo-imaging; Sleep posture; Songbird; Heat dissipation
article,Ice slurry ingestion before and during exercise inhibit the increase in core and deep-forehead temperatures in the second half of the exercise in a hot environment,"Onitsuka, Sumire and Zheng, Xinyan and Hasegawa, Hiroshi",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Many studies have reported that pre-exercise ice slurry ingestion improves exercise performance; however, it may increase the risk of developing heat stroke. Some studies have suggested that pre-exercise ice slurry ingestion accelerates the core temperature increase that occurs during exercise. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether the ingestion of ice slurry before and during exercise can inhibit this acceleration. Moreover, we measured the deep-forehead temperature (T-deep head) to determine whether ice slurry ingestion before and during exercise can maintain this reduction in brain temperature. Eleven male participants at room temperature (24 degrees C, 50\% relative humidity {[}RH]) ingested 7.5 g/kg of ice slurry or a thermoneutral sports drink within 30 min. They then exercised for approximately 60 min at 50\% of the maximal oxygen uptake in a hot environment (34 degrees C, 50\% RH) while ingesting 1.25 g/kg of ice slurry or a thermoneutral sports drink every 10 min. Rectal temperature (T-re), T-deep head, forehead skin temperature, mean skin temperature, heart rate, nude body mass, and urine specific gravity were measured as physiological indices. The rating of perceived exertion, thermal sensation, and thermal comfort were measured at 5-min intervals throughout the experiment. The T-re and T-deep head during the second half of the exercise session were significantly reduced after ingestion of the ice slurry before and during exercise (p < 0.05). In addition, the rate of increase in T-re and T-deep head slowed during the second half of the exercise session after the ingestion of the ice slurry before and during exercise (p < 0.05). These results indicate that the increases in T-re and T-deep head, reflecting brain temperature in the second half of the exercise session, were significantly inhibited by ice slurry ingestion before and during exercise.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102760,94,NA,NA,102760,Ice slurry; Pre-cooling; Mid-cooling; Deep-forehead temperature
article,"Global biodiversity and biogeography of mangrove crabs: Temperature, the key driver of latitudinal gradients of species richness","Sharifian, Sana and Kamrani, Ehsan and Saeedi, Hanieh",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Mangroves are ideal habitat for a variety of marine species especially brachyuran crabs as the dominant macrofauna. However, the global distribution, endemicity, and latitudinal gradients of species richness in mangrove crabs remains poorly understood. Here, we assessed whether species richness of mangrove crabs decreases towards the higher latitudes and tested the importance of environmental factors such as Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in creating the latitudinal gradients in species richness of mangrove crabs. A total of 8262 distribution records of 481 species belonging to six families of mangrove crabs including Camptandriidae, Dotillidae, Macrophthalmidae, Ocypodidae, Sesarmidae, and Oziidae were extracted from open-access databases or collected by the authors, quality controlled, cleaned, and analyzed. Species richness was plotted against 5 degrees latitudinal bands in relation to environmental factors. The R software and ArcGIS 10.6.1 were used to analyze the species latitudinal range and richness as well as to map the distribution of mangrove forest, endemic species, species geographical distribution records, and biogeographic regions. The Indo-West Pacific showed the highest species richness of mangrove crabs where more than 65\% of species were found in the Indian Ocean and along the western Pacific Ocean. Our results showed that there are 11 significantly different biogeographic regions of mangrove crabs. The highest endemicity rate was observed in the NW Pacific Ocean (29\%). Latitudinal patterns of species richness in Macrophthalmidae, Ocypodidae, and Sesarmidae showed an increasing trend from the poles toward the intermediate latitudes including one dip near the equator. However, latitudinal gradients in Camptandriidae, Dotillidae, and Oziidae were unimodal increasing from the higher latitudes towards the equator. Species richness per 5 degrees latitudinal bands significantly increased following mean SST mean (degrees C), calcite, euphotic depth (m), and mangrove area (km(2)) across all latitudes, and tide average within each hemisphere. Species richness significantly decreased with dissolved O-2 (ml l(-1)) and nitrate (mu mol l(-1)) over all latitudes and in the southern hemisphere. The climax of global latitudinal species richness for some mangrove was observed along latitudes 20 degrees N and 15 degrees-25 degrees S, not at the equator. This can suggest that temperature is probably the key driver of latitudinal gradients of mangrove crabs' species richness.

article,Feeling the heat: Extreme temperatures compromise constitutive innate humoral immunity and skin color in a desert dwelling lizard,"Plasman, Melissa and Torres, Roxana",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Environmental temperature, particularly in habitats with extreme temperature fluctuations, may shape selection pressures on life history traits. Especially in ectotherms, temperature affects performance, physiology, and in some species, skin color. Skin color can be a sexual ornament signaling the bearer's ability to resist infections, when only high-quality individuals are able to invest both in high immune defense and elaborate ornament expression. However, how the information content of these sexual traits may vary with environmental conditions has been less studied. Dickerson's collared lizard (Crotaphytus dickersonae) males are blue and have a black and white collar. This conspicuous coloration signals performance and immune response, and is related to body temperature. Here, by maintaining males at higher, lower, and mean environmental temperatures we evaluated whether temperature variation influences color and constitutive innate humoral immunity (agglutination and lysis titers, estimated through hemolysis-hemagglutination assays), and whether extreme temperatures impose trade-offs between color and humoral immunity. We found that at low and high temperature treatments males had lower agglutination and lysis titers, and at low temperature, blue chroma from the dorsum declined and males became greener. Interestingly, at low and control temperature treatments, agglutination titer and blue coloration were positively correlated, whereas high temperatures revealed a trade-off between increasing agglutination titers and displaying bluer skin color. Our results suggest that in the Dickerson collared lizard even short-term variation of environmental temperature affects performance of constitutive innate humoral immunity and the brilliant blue skin color. Particularly, high temperatures may compromise some components of male's immunity and sexual signaling.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.05.012,83,NA,142-149,NA,Color change; Dynamic signal; Agglutination and lysis titers; Sexual color; Trade-off

Thus, we know comparatively little about how they interact to shape physiological variation in natural populations. Here, we test the hypothesis that behavioral thermoregulation and thermal acclimatization interact to shape physiological phenotypes in a natural population of the diurnal lizard, Sceloporus torquatus. Every month for one year we examined thermoregulatory effectiveness and changes in the population mean in three physiological parameters: cold tolerance (Ct(min)), heat tolerance (Ct(max)), and the preferred body temperature (T-pref), to indirectly assess thermal acclimatization in population means. We discovered that S. torquatus is an active thermoregulator throughout the year, with body temperature varying little despite strong seasonal temperature shifts. Although we did not observe a strong signal of acclimatization in Ct(max), we did find that Ct(max), 1 shifts in parallel with nighttime temperatures throughout the year. This likely occurs, at least in part, because thermoregulation is substantially less effective at buffering organisms from selection on lower physiological limits than upper physiological limits. Active thermoregulation is effective at limiting exposure to extreme temperatures during the day, but is less effective at night, potentially contributing to greater plasticity in Ct(min) than Ct(max) Importantly, however, T-pref tracked seasonal changes in temperature, which is one the factors contributing to highly effective thermoregulation throughout the year. Thus, behavior and physiological plasticity do not always operate independently, which could impact how organisms can respond to rising temperatures.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.12.001,79,NA,135-143,NA,Behavioral thermoregulation; Climate change; Critical temperatures; Plasticity; Preferred body temperature
article,"Low quality diet and challenging temperatures affect vital rates, but not thermal tolerance in a tropical insect expanding its diet to an exotic plant","Garcia-Robledo, Carlos and Charlotten-Silva, Mariela and Cruz, Christopher and Kuprewicz, Erin K.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Determining responses of organisms to changing temperatures is a research priority, as global warming threatens populations and ecosystems worldwide. Upper thermal limits are frequently measured as the critical thermal maximum (CTmax), a quick bioassay where organisms are exposed to increasing temperatures until individuals are not able to perform basic motor activities such as walking or flying. A more informative approach to understand organism responses to global warming is to evaluate how vital rates, such as growth or survival, change with temperatures. The main objectives of this study are: (1) to determine if factors affecting insect vital rates such as diet quality, developmental temperatures or acclimation also affect CTmax and (2) to determine if vital rates of different life stages (i.e., insect larvae or adults) display different responses to temperature changes. If different life stages have particular thermal requirements, this may indicate different susceptibility to global warming. This study focuses on Cephaloleia held (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), a tropical insect currently expanding its diet to an exotic host plant. We determined how high and low-quality diets (i.e., native vs novel host), as well as exposure temperatures affect CT(max )of adult beetles. We also estimated larval and adult survival when feeding on high and low quality host plants, when exposed to temperatures typical of the elevational distribution of this species, or when exposed to projected temperatures in 100 years. We did not detect an effect of diet quality or acclimation on CTmax. However, larvae and adults had different thermal requirements. CTmax is not affected by previous diet or acclimation as an adult. We propose that to understand processes involved in the adaptation and persistence of ectotherm populations in a warming world, studies must explore responses beyond CTmax,and focus on the response of vital rates to changing temperatures.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.07.018,77,NA,7-13,NA,Acclimation; Cephaloleia belti; Chrysomelidae; Exotic host plant; Native host plant; Thermal tolerance

We hypothesized that alligators would acclimate to cold temperature by increasing the metabolic capacity of skeletal muscles and the heart. Additionally, we hypothesized that lipid membranes in the thigh muscle and liver would respond to low temperature, either to maintain fluidity (via increased unsaturation) or to maintain enzyme reaction rates (via increased docosahexaenoic acid). Alligators were assigned to one of 3 temperature regimes beginning at 9 mo of age: constant warm (30 degrees C), constant cold (20 degrees C), and daily cycling for 12 hat each temperature. Growth rate over the following 7 mo was highest in the cycling group, which we suggest occurred via high digestive function or feeding activity during warm periods and energy-saving during cold periods. The warm group also grew faster than the cold group. Heart and liver masses were proportional to body mass, while kidney was proportionately larger in the cold group compared to the warm animals. Whole animal metabolic rate was higher in the warm and cycling groups compared to the cold group even when controlling for body - mass when assayed at 30 degrees C, but not at 20 degrees C. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation capacity in permeabilized fibers of thigh muscle and heart did not differ among treatments. Membrane fatty acid composition of the brain was largely unaffected by temperature treatment, but adjustments were made in the phospholipid headgroup composition that are consistent with homeoviscous adaptation. Thigh muscle cell membranes had elevated polyunsaturated fatty acids in the cold group relative to the cycling group, but this was not the case for thigh muscle mitochondrial membranes. Liver mitochondria from cold alligators had elevated docosahexaenoic acid, which might be important for maintenance of reaction rates of membrane-bound enzymes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Regulations of gene expression including translation modulations are critical for adaptation and survival under stress. Untranslated regions (UTRs) of the transcripts play significant roles in translation regulation and continue to raise many intriguing questions in our understanding of cellular stress physiology. IRES (Internal ribosome entry site) and uORF (upstream open reading frame) mediated alternative translation initiations are emerging as unique mechanisms. Recent studies have revealed novel means of mRNAs stabilization in stress granules and their reversible modifications. Differential regulation of select transcripts is possible by the interplay between the adenine/ uridine-rich elements (AREs) in 3'UTR with their binding proteins (AUBP) and by microRNA-mediated effects. Coordination of these various mechanisms control translation and thereby enables appropriate responses to environmental stress. In this review, we focus on the role of sequence signatures both at 5' and 3'UTRs in translation reprogramming during cellular stress responses.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.02.006,65,NA,69-75,NA,Stress responses; Translation regulation; RNA motifs; Stress granules
article,Compensation method for the influence of angle of view on animal temperature measurement using thermal imaging camera combined with depth image,"Jiao, Leizi and Dong, Daming and Zhao, Xiande and Han, Pengcheng",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In the study, we proposed an animal surface temperature measurement method based on Kinect sensor and infrared thermal imager to facilitate the screening of animals with febrile diseases. Due to random motion and small surface temperature variation of animals, the influence of the angle of view on temperature measurement is significant. The method proposed in the present study could compensate the temperature measurement error caused by the angle of view. Firstly, we analyzed the relationship between measured temperature and angle of view and established the mathematical model for compensating the influence of the angle of view with the correlation coefficient above 0.99. Secondly, the fusion method of depth and infrared thermal images was established for synchronous image capture with Kinect sensor and infrared thermal imager and the angle of view of each pixel was calculated. According to experimental results, without compensation treatment, the temperature image measured in the angle of view of 74 degrees to 76 degrees showed the difference of more than 2 degrees C compared with that measured in the angle of view of 0 degrees. However, after compensation treatment, the temperature difference range was only 0.03-1.2 degrees C. This method is applicable for real-time compensation of errors caused by the angle of view during the temperature measurement process with the infrared thermal imager.",2016,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.07.021,62,A,15-19,NA,Angle of view; Depth image; Infrared thermal image; Temperature measurement
article,"The effects of single versus twice daily short term heat acclimation on heat strain and 3000 m running performance in hot, humid conditions","Willmott, A. G. B. and Gibson, O. R. and Hayes, M. and Maxwell, N. S.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Endurance performances are impaired under conditions of elevated heat stress. Short term heat acclimation (STHA) over 4-6 days can evoke rapid adaptation, which mitigate decrements in performance and alleviate heat strain. This study investigated the efficacy of twice daily heat acclimation (TDHA) compared to single session per day heat acclimation (SDHA) and normothermic training, at inducing heat acclimation phenotype and its impact upon running performance in hot, humid conditions. Twenty one, moderately trained males were matched and assigned to three groups; SDHA (mean +/- SD) (peak oxygen consumption {[}VO2peak] 45.8 +/- 6.1 mL kg(-1) min(-1), body mass 81.3 +/- 16.0 kg, stature 182 3 cm), TDHA (46.1 +/- 7.0 mL kg(-1) min(-1), 80.1 +/- 11.9 kg, 178 4 cm) or control (CON) (47.1 +/- 3.5 mL kg(-1) min(-1), 78.6 +/- 16.7 kg, 178 4 cm). Interventions consisted of 45 min cycling at 50\% VO2peak,, once daily for 4d (SDHA) and twice daily for 2d (TDHA), in 35 degrees C, 60\% relative humidity (RH), and once daily for 4 days (CON) in 21 degrees C, 40\% RH. Participants completed a pre-and post-intervention 5 km treadmill run trial in 30 degrees C, 60\% RH, where the first 2 km were fixed at 40\% VO2peak and the final 3 km was self-paced. No statistically significant interaction effects occurred within-or between-groups over the 2-4 days intervention. While within-group differences were found in physiological and perceptual measures during the fixed intensity trial post-intervention, they did not statistically differ between-groups. Similarly, TDHA (-36 +/- 34 s {[}+3.5\%]) and SDHA (-26 +/- 28 s {[}+2.8\%]) groups improved 3 km performances (p=035), but did not differ from CON (-6 +/- 44 s {[}+0.6\%]). This is the first study to investigate the effects of HA twice daily and compare it with traditional single session per day STHA. These STHA protocols may have the ability to induce partial adaptive responses to heat stress and possibly enhance performance in environmentally challenging conditions, however, future development is warranted to optimise the administration to provide a potent stimuli for heat adaptation in athletic and military personnel within a rapid regime.

article,Flies developed smaller cells when temperature fluctuated more frequently,"Czarnoleski, Marcin and Dragosz-Kluska, Dominika and Angilletta, Jr., Michael J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Changes in cell size might be an important component of adaptation to thermal heterogeneity. Although Drosophila melanogaster develops smaller cells at fluctuating temperatures, we do not know whether this response depends on the frequency or amplitude of thermal change. In a laboratory experiment, we exposed flies to either frequent or infrequent fluctuations between 17 and 27 degrees C, while controlling the total exposure to each temperature. Flies emerged from these treatments with similar body sizes, but flies at more frequent fluctuations emerged earlier and had smaller epidermal cells for a given body size. Tissue built from small cells has more nuclei for transcription, shorter distances between cell compartments, and a larger surface area for transport across membranes. Therefore, we hypothesize that physiological effects of small cells reduce lags in metabolic activity and enhance performance of flies during warming. For plasticity of cell size to confer a fitness advantage, this hypothetical benefit must outweigh the cost of maintaining a greater area of plasma membrane. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Indeed, due to its physical properties, melanin pigments allow melanistic morphs to benefit of a more efficient thermoregulation compared to non-melanistic ones. Despite thermal benefits of melanism have often been highlighted under experimental conditions, such field data remain scarce. In this study, we investigated the influence of colouration on body temperature and microhabitat choice in a montane population of colour polymorphic asp viper (Vipera aspis) characterized by a strong presence of melanism (64\%). Results highlighted a difference in internal body temperature, but only within gravid females, with melanistic individuals having higher body temperatures compared to non-melanistic ones. No differences were found when considering both sexes. We also showed that melanistic and non-melanistic vipers were found in different microhabitat types, i.e. melanistic snakes used areas marked by a scarcer sun exposure and by higher vegetation cover compared to non-melanistic ones. This result has important implications. Indeed, besides providing a possible explanation for the lack of difference in body temperature (except for gravid females), it confirms that melanistic individuals can potentially use their efficient thermoregulation in order to inhabit less exposed and thermally unfavourable microhabitats.

article,The reliability of a heat acclimation state test prescribed from metabolic heat production intensities,"Willmott, A. G. B. and Hayes, M. and Dekerle, J. and Maxwell, N. S.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Acclimation state indicates an individual's phenotypic response to a thermally stressful environment, where changes in heat dissipation capacity are determined during a heat acclimation state test (HAST). Variations in thermoregulatory and sudomotor function are reported while exercising at intensities relative to maximal oxygen uptake. This inter-individual variation is not true when intensity is prescribed to elicit a fixed rate of metabolic heat production (H) over dot(prod), This study investigated the reliability of peak T-re and two composite measures (sweat gain and sweat setpoint) derived from indices of thermosensitivity during a HAST prescribed from (H) over dot(prod) intensities. Fourteen participants (mean +/- SD; age 23 +/- 3 years, stature 174 +/- 7 cm, body mass 75.0 +/- 9.4 kg, body surface area 1.9 +/- 0.1 m(2), peak oxygen consumption {[}(V) over dotO(2peak)] 3.49 +/- 0.53 L min(-1)) completed a lactate threshold-(V) over dotO(2peak) test and two duplicate (H) over dot(prod) HASTs on a cycle ergometer. The HAST consisted of three, 30-min periods of exercise at fixed (H) over dot(prod) intensities relative to body mass (3, 4.5 and 6 W kg(-1)), within hot dry conditions (44.7 +/- 1.8 degrees C and 18.1 +/- 4.7\% relative humidity). Peak T-re (38.20 +/- 036 vs. 38.16 +/- 0.42 degrees C, p=0.54), sweat setpoint (36.76 +/- 0.34 and 36.79 +/- 0.38 degrees C, p = 0.68) and sweat gain (0.37 +/- 0.14 and 0.40 +/- 0.18 g s(-1) degrees C-1, p=0.40) did not differ between HASTs. Typical error of measurement (TEM), coefficient variation (CV) and intra-class coefficient of correlation (ICC) were 0.19 degrees C, 0.5\% and 0.80 for peak T-re, 0.21 degrees C, 0.6\% and 0.65 for sweat setpoint and 0.09 g s(-1) degrees C-1, 28\% and 0.68 for sweat gain, respectively. The use of fixed (H) over dot(prod) intensities relative to body mass is a reliable method for measuring Tre and ascertaining sweat setpoint during a HAST, whereas, sweat gain displays greater variability. A (H) over dot(prod) HAST appears sufficiently reliable for quantifying heat acclimation state, where TEM in peak T-re and sweat setpoint are small enough to identify physiologically meaningful improvements post-intervention.

article,Human thermal physiological and psychological responses under different heating environments,"Wang, Zhaojun and Ning, Haoran and Ji, Yuchen and Hou, Juan and He, Yanan",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Anecdotal evidence suggests that many residents of severely cold areas of China who use floor heating (FH) systems feel warmer but drier compared to those using radiant heating (RH) systems. However, this phenomenon has not been verified experimentally. In order to validate the empirical hypothesis, and research the differences of human physiological and psychological responses in these two asymmetrical heating environments, an experiment was designed to mimic FH and RH systems. The subjects participating in the experiment were volunteer college-students. During the experiment, the indoor air temperature, air speed, relative humidity, globe temperature, and inner surface temperatures were measured, and subjects' heart rate, blood pressure and skin temperatures were recorded. The subjects were required to fill in questionnaires about their thermal responses during testing. The results showed that the subjects' skin temperatures, heart rate and blood pressure were significantly affected by the type of heating environment. Ankle temperature had greatest impact on overall thermal comfort relative to other body parts, and a slightly cool FH condition was the most pleasurable environment for sedentary subjects. The overall thermal sensation, comfort and acceptability of FH were higher than that of RH. However, the subjects of FH felt drier than that of RH, although the relative humidity in FH environments was higher than that of the RH environment. In future environmental design, the thermal comfort of the ankles should be scrutinized, and a FH cool condition is recommended as the most comfortable thermal environment for office workers. Consequently, large amounts of heating energy could be saved in this area in the winter. The results of this study may lead to more efficient energy use for office or home heating systems.

The fish (start at 12 d post hatch) were reared for nearly 6 months at five constant temperatures of 10, 14, 18, 22 and 26 degrees C. Then juvenile fish being acclimated at three temperatures of 14, 18 and 22 degrees C were chosen to determine their critical thermal maximum (CTMax) and lethal thermal maximum (LTMax) by using the dynamic method. Growth rate of S. kozlovi larvae and juveniles was significantly influenced by temperature and fish size, exhibiting an increase with increased rearing temperature, but a decline with increased fish size. A significant ontogenetic variation in the optimal temperatures for maximum growth were estimated to be 24.7 degrees C and 20.6 degrees C for larvae and juveniles of S. kozlovi, respectively. The results also demonstrated that acclimation temperature had marked effects on their CTMax and LTMax, which ranged from 32.86 degrees C to 34.54 degrees C and from 33.79 degrees C to 34.80 degrees C, respectively. It is suggested that rearing temperature must never rise above 32 degrees C for its successful aquaculture. Significant temperature effects on the growth rate and thermal tolerance both exhibit a plasticity pattern. Determination of critical heat tolerance and optima temperature for maximum growth of S. kozlovi is of ecological significance in the conservation and aquaculture of this species.

We examined 25 healthy men with mean age 30.1 +/- 3.7 years and comparable anthropomorphical characteristic. Each subject was exposed to cryotherapeutic temperatures in a cryogenic chamber for 3 min (approx. -120 degrees C). The cardiovascular and autonomic parameters were measured noninvasively with Task Force (R) Monitor. The changes in core body temperature were determined with the Vital Sense (R) telemetric measurement system. Results show that 3 min to cryotherapeutic temperatures causes significant changes in autonomic balance which are induced by peripheral and central blood volume changes. Cryostimulation also induced changes in core body temperature, maximum drop of core temperature was observed 50-60 min after the stimulation.

article,The heat is on: Thermoregulatory and evaporative cooling patterns of desert-dwelling bats,"de Mel, Ruvinda K. and Moseby, Katherine E. and Stewart, Kathleen A. and Rankin, Kate E. and Czenze, Zenon J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"For small endotherms inhabiting desert ecosystems, defending body temperatures (T-b) is challenging as they contend with extremely high ambient temperatures (T-a) and limited standing water. In the arid zone, bats may thermoconform whereby T-b varies with T-a, or may evaporatively cool themselves to maintain T-b < T-a. We used an integrative approach that combined both temperature telemetry and flow through respirometry to investigate the ecological and physiological strategies of lesser long-eared bats (Nyctophilus geoffroyi) in Australia's arid zone. We predicted individuals would exhibit desert-adapted thermoregulatory patterns (i.e., thermoconform to prioritise water conservation), and that females would be more conservative with their water reserves for evaporative cooling compared to males. Temperature telemetry data indicated that free-ranging N. geoffroyi were heterothermic (T-skin = 18.9-44.9 degrees C) during summer and thermoconformed over a wide range of temperatures, likely to conserve water and energy during the day. Experimentally, at high T(a)s, females maintained significantly lower T-b and resting metabolic rates, despite lower evaporative water loss (EWL) rates compared to males. Females only increased EWL at experimental T-a = 42.5 degrees C, significantly higher than males (40.7 degrees C), and higher than any bat species yet recorded. During the hottest day of this study, our estimates suggest the water required for evaporative cooling ranged from 18.3\% (females) and 25.5\% (males) of body mass. However, if we extrapolate these results to a recent heatwave these values increase to 36.5\% and 47.3\%, which are likely beyond lethal limits. It appears this population is under selective pressures to conserve water reserves and that these pressures are more pronounced in females than males. Bats in arid ecosystems are threatened by both current and future heatwaves and we recommend future conservation efforts focus on protecting current roost trees and creating artificial standing water sites near vulnerable populations.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103919,123,NA,NA,103919,Heat tolerance limit; Evaporative water loss; Water balance; Arid zone; Bats; Thermoregulation
article,The functional microclimate of an urban arthropod pest: Urban heat island temperatures in webs of the western black widow spider,"Clark, Ryan C. and Johnson, Chadwick",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Urbanization alters natural landscapes and creates unique challenges for urban wildlife. Similarly, the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect can produce significantly elevated temperatures in urban areas, and we have a relatively poor understanding of how this will impact urban biodiversity. In particular, most studies quantify the UHI using broad-scale climate data rather than assessing microclimate temperatures actually experienced by organisms. In addition, studies often fail to address spatial and temporal complexities of the UHI. Here we examine the thermal microclimate and UHI experienced in the web of Western black widow spiders (Latrodectus hesperus), a medically-important, superabundant urban pest species found in cities across the Western region of North America. We do this using replicate urban and desert populations across an entire year to account for seasonal variation in the UHI, both within and between habitats. Our findings reveal a strong nighttime, but no daytime, UHI effect, with urban spider webs being 2-5 degree celsius warmer than desert webs at night. This UHI effect is most prominent during the spring and least prominent in winter, suggesting that the UHI need not be most pronounced when temperatures are most elevated. Urban web temperatures varied among urban sites in the daytime, whereas desert web temperatures varied among desert sites in the nighttime. Finally, web temperature was significantly positively correlated with a spider's boldness, but showed no relationship with voracity towards prey, web size, or body condition. Understanding the complexities of each organism's thermal challenges, the ``functional microclimate{''}, is crucial for predicting the impacts of urbanization and climate change on urban biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103814,120,NA,NA,103814,Urban heat island; Black widow spider; Thermal microclimate; Urban pest
article,The response of heat shock proteins in honey bees to abiotic and biotic stressors,"Abou-Shaara, Hossam F.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Honey bees, Apis mellifera, are the most important managed pollinators worldwide. They are highly impacted by various abiotic and biotic stressors, especially temperature extremes, which can lead to cellular damage and death. The induction of heat shock proteins (HSPs) has been recorded in honey bees as a response to various types of stressors. HSPs are classified into different gene families according to their molecular weights. HSPs play an important role in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis due to their contribution as molecular chaperones or co-chaperones. HSPs in honey bees have complex functions with induction even under normal colony conditions. Previous studies have suggested various functions of HSPs to protect cells from damage under exposure to environmental stressors, pollutants, and pathogens. Surprisingly, HSPs have also been found to play roles in larval development and age-related tasks. The expression of HSPs varies depending on tissue type, developmental stage, age, and stress period. This article reviews studies on HSPs (sHSPs, HSP40, HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90) in honey bees and highlights gaps in the available knowledge.

article,"Geography and developmental plasticity shape post-larval thermal tolerance in the golden star tunicate, <i>Botryllus schlosseri</i>","Tobias, Zachary and Solow, Andrew and Tepolt, Carolyn",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity play key roles in mediating organisms' ability to respond to spatio-temporal variation in temperature. These two processes often act together to generate latitudinal or elevational clines in acute temperature tolerance. Phenotypic plasticity is also subject to local adaptation, with the expectation that populations inhabiting more variable environments should exhibit greater phenotypic plasticity of thermal tolerance. Here we examine the potential for local adaptation and developmental plasticity of thermal tolerance in the widespread invasive tunicate Botryllus schlosseri. By comparing five populations across a thermal gradient spanning 4.4. of latitude in the northwest Atlantic, we demonstrate that warmer populations south of the Gulf of Maine exhibit significantly increased (similar to 0.2.C) post-larval temperature tolerance relative to the colder populations within it. We also show that B. schlosseri post-larvae possess a high degree of developmental plasticity for this trait, shifting their median temperature of survival (LT50) upwards by as much as 0.18. C per 1. C increase in environmental temperature. Lastly, we found that populations vary in their degrees of developmental plasticity, with populations that experience more pronounced short-term temperature variability exhibiting greater developmental plasticity, suggesting the local adaptation of developmental plasticity. By comparing the thermal tolerance of populations across space and through time, we demonstrate how geography and developmental plasticity have shaped thermal tolerance in B. schlosseri.

article,Thermoregulatory strategies of songbird nestlings reveal limited capacity for cooling and high risk of dehydration,"Diehl, Jenna N. and Alton, Lesley A. and White, Craig R. and Peters, Anne",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"How the accelerating pace of global warming will affect animal populations depends on the effects of increasing temperature across the life cycle. Developing young are sensitive to environmental challenges, often with life-long consequences, but the risks of climate warming during this period are insufficiently understood. This may be due to limited insight into physiological sensitivity and the temperatures that represent a thermal challenge for young. Here we examined the physiological and behavioural effects of increasing temperatures by measuring metabolic rate, water loss, and heat dissipation behaviours between 25-45 degrees C in nestlings of a small free-living songbird of temperate SE-Australia, the superb fairy-wren. We found a high and relatively narrow thermoneutral zone from 33.1 to 42.3 degrees C, with metabolic rate increasing and all nestlings panting above this range. Evaporative water loss sharply increased above 33.5 degrees C; at the same temperature, nestlings changed their posture (extended their wings) to facilitate passive heat loss. However, at all temperatures measured, water loss was insufficient to dissipate metabolically produced heat, indicating poor cooling capabilities, which persisted even when individuals were panting. While nestlings are relatively tolerant to higher temperatures, with no evidence for hyperthermia at temperatures below 42 degrees C, they are at a high risk of dehydration even at lower temperatures, with limited ability to mitigate this. Thus, climate warming is likely to elevate the risk dehydration, which is concerning, since it is accompanied by drier conditions.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103707,117,NA,NA,103707,NA

Twelve-week-old Wistar male rats were divided into three groups: the control group, the HS model group, and the treatment group {[}HS model + ML-7 (MLCK inhibitor)]. HS impaired the tight junctions in the rat gut and increased permeability. Additionally, increased inflammatory factors in serum, activation of apoptosis, and downregulation of tight junction proteins were observed in intestinal cells. ML-7 significantly inhibited the MLCK/p-MLC2 signaling pathway, increased the expression of tight junction pro-teins, reduced intestinal permeability, reduced apoptosis and alleviated the intestinal damage caused by HS. ML -7 inhibited HS-induced apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells by regulating the ERK/p38/HSP70 axis. Further-more, inhibition of MLCK upregulated HSP70 expression through activation of the ERK pathway and inhibited cell apoptosis by abolishing the p38 MAPK pathway.

This study compared measurements of TC obtained with a wearable device, the CORETM, to those of a gastrointestinal pill (GI pill), during cold water ingestion and a 5 km running TT. Twelve participants (25 \& PLUSMN; 4 yrs) ingested 7.5 mL/ kg fat-free mass of 4 degrees C water over the first 5 min of a 120 min sitting period, after which they completed a 5 km running TT at 30 degrees C, 50\% relative humidity. A TC difference > \& PLUSMN; 0.25 degrees C between sensors was deemed clinically unacceptable. Prior to water ingestion, the CORE-derived TC was 0.49 \& PLUSMN; 0.25 degrees C lower than the GI pill. The CORE was irresponsive to the 0.26 \& PLUSMN; 0.22 degrees C peak decline in TC captured with the GI pill 40 min following water ingestion. Prior to the TT, TC was 0.30 \& PLUSMN; 0.25 degrees C lower with the CORE than the GI pill.

Pharmacological inhibition of MBH neurons by local administration of muscimol, a GABAA receptor agonist, reduced skin cooling-evoked BAT thermogenesis, expired CO2, body temperature, heart rate, and mean arterial pressure, while blockade of GABAA receptors by nanoinjection of bicuculline in the MBH induced large increases in BAT sympathetic nerve activity (SNA), BAT temperature, body temperature, expired CO2, heart rate, and cutaneous vasoconstriction. Neurons in the MBH send projections to neurons in the dorsal hypothalamic area and dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), which excite sympathetic premotor neurons in the rostral raphe pallidus area (rRPa) that control sympathetic outflow to BAT. The increases in BAT SNA, BAT temperature, and expired CO2 elicited by blockade of GABAA receptors in the MBH were reversed by blocking excitatory amino acid re-ceptors in the DMH or in the rRPa. Together, our data show that MBH neurons provide a modest contribution to BAT thermogenesis for cold defense, while GABAergic disinhibition of these neurons produces large increases in the sympathetic outflow to BAT, and cutaneous vasoconstriction. Activation of glutamate receptors on BAT thermogenesis-promoting neurons of the DMH and rRPa is necessary for the increased sympathetic outflow to BAT evoked by disinhibition of MBH neurons. These data demonstrate neural mechanisms that contribute to the control of thermoeffector activity, and may have important implications for regulating body temperature and energy expenditure.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103551,114,NA,NA,103551,Arcuate nucleus; Ventromedial hypothalamus; Thermoregulation; Cold defense; Thermogenesis; Sympathetic nervous system

Objectives: We aimed to analyze the associations among serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) levels with the peripheral temperature of the skin of both hands and the core body temperature in patients with FM and healthy controls.Methods: We conducted a case-control observational study with fifty-three women diagnosed with FM and twenty-four healthy women. VEGF and CGRP levels were spectrophotometrically analyzed in serum by enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay. We used an infrared thermography camera to assess the peripheral temperature of the skin of the dorsal thumb, index, middle, ring, and pinkie fingertips and dorsal centre as well as the palm thumb, index, middle, ring, and pinkie fingertips, palm centre and thenar and hypothenar eminences of both hands and an infrared thermographic scanner to record the tympanic membrane and axillary temperature.Results: Linear regression analysis adjusting for age, menopause status, and body mass index showed that serum VEGF levels were positively associated with the maximum (beta = 65.942, 95\% CI {[}4.100,127.784], p = 0.037), minimum (beta = 59.216, 95\% CI {[}1.455,116.976], p = 0.045), and mean (beta= 66.923, 95\% CI {[}3.142,130.705], p = 0.040) temperature of the thenar eminence of the non-dominant hand, as well as with the maximum temperature of the hypothenar eminence of the non-dominant hand (beta = 63.607, 95\% CI {[}3.468,123.747], p = 0.039) in women diagnosed with FM.Conclusions: Mild associations were observed between serum VEGF levels and the peripheral temperature of the skin in hand areas in patients with FM; therefore, it is not possible to establish a clear relationship between this vasoactive molecule and vasodilation of the hands in these patients.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103469,112,NA,NA,103469,Fibromyalgia; Thermography; Core body temperature; Calcitonin gene -related peptide; Vascular endothelial growth factor

The methodology consisted of: (i) Developing a method based on facial infrared imaging for possible COVID-19 early detection in people with and without fever (subfebrile state); (ii) Using 1206 emergency room (ER) patients to develop an algorithm for general application of the method, and (iii) Testing the method and algorithm effectiveness in 2558 cases (RT-qPCR tested for COVID-19) from 227,261 workers evaluations in five different countries. Artificial intelligence was used through a convolutional neural network (CNN) to develop the algorithm that took facial infrared images as input and classified the tested individuals in three groups: fever (high risk), subfebrile (medium risk), and no fever (low risk). The results showed that suspicious and confirmed COVID-19 (+) cases characterized by temperatures below the 37.5 degrees C fever threshold were identified. Also, average forehead and eye temperatures greater than 37.5 degrees C were not enough to detect fever similarly to the proposed CNN algorithm. Most RT-qPCR confirmed COVID-19 (+) cases found in the 2558 cases sample (17 cases/89.5\%) belonged to the CNN selected subfebrile group. The COVID-19 (+) main risk factor was to be in the subfebrile group, in comparison to age, diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking and others. In sum, the proposed method was shown to be a potentially important new tool for COVID-19 (+) people screening for air travel and public places in general.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103444,112,NA,NA,103444,Infrared imaging; Artificial intelligence; Convolutional neural network

Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the dynamics of thermoregu-lation and hormonal responses in non-pregnant and pregnant ewes exposed to successive heat waves. Twenty-four non-pregnant and 18 pregnant Santa Ines ewes with black coat color (live weight: 55 +/- 9.03 kg; age: 60 months) were used. Weather variables such air temperature, relative humidity, and solar radiation were continuously recorded. The rectal and tympanic temperatures and respiratory rate were measured daily. Serum triiodothyronine (T3) and prolactin were evaluated during the heat wave and thermoneutral periods. The physiological variables were higher under the heat wave conditions and were related to the activation of the thermoregulatory system for maintaining homeothermy (P < 0.05). The core body temperature was higher during successive heat waves (P < 0.05), as was the tympanic temperature, which are both affected by changes in air temperature (P < 0.05). T3 and prolactin levels were not influenced by successive heat waves (P < 0.05) and rectal temperature and respiratory rate were highest in non-pregnant ewes (P < 0.05). Prolactin was not affected by temperature. The results indicate that the Santa Ines breed overcomes the thermal challenge during a heat wave without showing severe signs of thermal stress regardless of being pregnant or not.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103420,111,NA,NA,103420,Heat stress; Thermoregulation; Sheep; Thermoneutrality

However, the adaptive mechanism of Mongolian sheep during the cold season in the plateau environment remains unknown. Browning of white adipose tissues (WAT) can trigger nonshivering thermogenesis as a potential strategy to promote an animal's tolerance to cold environments. Thus, a comparative analysis of the genes and proteins of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-dependent and UCP1-independent browning pathways, mitochondrial biogenesis, lipogenic and lipolytic processes of WAT from grazing Mongolian sheep in the cold and warm seasons was conducted. We found seasonal browning of both retroperitoneal WAT and perirenal WAT, and the signalling of the process was mainly transduced by the UCP1-dependent pathway, primarily reflected in the upregulated gene levels of UCP1 and peroxisome prolif-erative activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha). In addition, the mean adipocyte diameter and mRNA expression of lipogenic genes in both interscapular WAT and subcutaneous WAT were significantly elevated during the cold season. The findings of this study demonstrate that grazing Mongolian sheep could depend on seasonal browning of both retroperitoneal WAT and perirenal WAT together with the expansion of both interscapular WAT and subcutaneous WAT to acclimate to cold environments of the Mongolian Plateau.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103333,109,NA,NA,103333,Seasonal acclimation; Mongolian sheep ( Ovis aries ); Cold tolerant; White adipose tissue; Uncoupling protein 1; Browning

We determined the thermal thresholds of D. gelechiidivoris, with T. absoluta as host, using life cycle simulation modelling. Life-table data of D. gelechiidivoris were generated at six constant temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 degrees C, 65 +/- 5\% RH, and 12L: 12D photoperiod). Multiple non-linear functions were fitted to model some aspects of the biology of the parasitoid, including its longevity, mortality, reproduction, and senescence using Insect Life Cycle Modelling (ILCYM) software. The phenology models established were used to estimate life table parameters. Except at 35 degrees C, D. gelechiidivoris completed its development (i.e., egg-larval-pupa-adult) at all tested temperatures. The minimum temperature threshold from egg to cocoon was 7.0 degrees C and 5.9 degrees C from cocoon to adult wasp, while the maximum temperature thresholds were 34 degrees C and 36 degrees C, respectively. The optimal temperature for immature survival was 20-25 degrees C, while fecundity was optimum at 22.5 degrees C, with 69.5 eggs per female.

To better understand their response to elevated tem-perature, three native species of freshwater mussels namely, Coelatura aegyptiaca, Mutela rostrata and Choardia rubens were exposed for 21 days to four temperature treatments (18 -25-30 and 35 degrees C). Mortality was recorded on a daily basis over the experiment. A variety of responses including biomarkers at the cellular level and whole organism level were examined in surviving organisms after 21 days. In response to exposure to thermal stress, three mussel species exposed to 35 degrees C showed 100\% mortality after 21 days. However, exposure to 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C induced significant decreases in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and energy reserves (Protein, lipid and glycogen) compared to the control group maintained at 18 degrees C. Temperature-induced oxidative stress, indicated by the greatest reduction in total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and elevated levels of lipid peroxidation products. As energy generation decreased and oxidative stress increased, trends were for condition indexes (CI) and survival to decrease. In comparison, C. rubens has a higher thermal tolerance than C. aegyptiaca, and M. rostrata.

article,Response to thermal and hydric regimes point to differential inter- and intraspecific vulnerability of tropical amphibians to climate warming,"Delgado-Suazo, Peter and Burrowes, Patricia A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In Puerto Rico, an island threatened by climate warming, only one of two species of frogs that share part of their distribution has undergone a recent range contraction to higher elevations. We questioned if differences in their physiological response to temperature and dehydration might explain this distributional change. We studied a lowland and a highland population of Eleutherodactylus coqui, a widespread generalist, and E. portoricensis, an endangered species that is currently found only above 600 m. We compared various physiological aspects: operative temperature; temperature selection; critical temperatures; and their response to jumping performance tests at various thermal and hydric regimes. Results revealed that E. portoricensis had the highest CTmin and lowest CTmax and selected a cooler range of temperatures from the experimental gradient. Jumping performance increased with temperature for the three populations until attaining maximum performance. Afterwards, performance dropped drastically until reaching CTmax. Dehydration had a negative effect on performance for both species, particularly on maximum performance. This effect was greatest for E. portoricensis, followed by highelevation E. coqui. The significantly greater thermo-hydric physiological limitations of E. portoricensis may explain its recent range contraction, potentially, as a response to climate warming. Low-elevation E. coqui had the lowest operative warming tolerance and was the only population to select temperatures like those encountered in their environment, indicating it may be narrowly adapted to local thermal conditions and thus, also vulnerable to climate change. Our results point towards plasticity in the response of E. coqui to varying climatic conditions, and present evidence of different physiological responses between closely related species at the same locality. This work highlights the importance of studying the combined effects of temperature and hydration to understand the response of ectotherms to warming environments and presents further evidence that desiccation may be a limiting factor determining which species may survive.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103148,103,NA,NA,103148,Hydrothermal physiology; Thermal performance curves; Climate warming; Tropical amphibians; Direct development frogs; Climate vulnerability; Intraspecific variation

Vaginal temperature in cows of British breeds was always higher (P < 0.05), and the higher temperature picks coincide with afternoon hours. British cows maintained stable their vaginal temperature if THI was lower than 72.8, but for higher values, they showed linear increases. Moreover, the threshold THI associated to increase in vaginal temperature in British breeds was 72.8. However, vaginal temperature remained unchanged in Bonsmara crosses. The present work suggests that THI greater than 72.8 could affect the body temperature in grazing cattle of British breeds but not its crosses with Bonsmara.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103118,102,NA,NA,103118,Temperature-humidity index; Vaginal temperature

Our objective was to serially monitor scrotal subcutaneous temperatures during testicular heat stress and relate those to sperm quality. Two experiments were conducted, with temperature sensors surgically implanted in scrotal subcutaneous tissues recording temperatures every 15 min and semen collected and evaluated weekly. After an initial control interval, testicular temperature was increased. In Experiment 1, in two Angus bulls, whole-scrotum insulation for 96 h increased scrotal subcutaneous temperatures by -2.0-2.5 degrees C (P < 0.05). Total and progressive motility decreased (P < 0.05) and reached a nadir at Week 3 (-20 and 10\%, respectively). Furthermore, morphologically normal sperm and acrosome integrity also decreased significantly, reaching nadirs at Weeks 3 (15\%) and 4 (34\%).

Scrotal subcutaneous temperatures (monitored in three rams per group) were increased in response to whole-body heating (-0.8 degrees C, P < 0.05), but not significantly changed by scrotal neck insulation. Decreases in sperm quality were generally similar between treatments, with the most profound changes evident 4 wk after heat stress, with -10 percentage point reductions in both total and progressive motility and -10 and 20 percentage point decreases in morphologically normal sperm in rams with whole-body heating versus scrotal neck insulation, respectively.

Using calorie restriction and cafeteria feeding, we induced a larger and a dampened Tc amplitude, respectively, in male Wistar rats, and investigated the circadian expression profile of the core clock genes Bmal1, Per2, Cry1, and Rev-erb alpha, the heat-responsive genes heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and cold-inducible RNA binding protein (Cirbp), and Pgc1 alpha, Ppar alpha/gamma/delta, Glut1/4, and Chop10 in the liver, skeletal muscle, white adipose tissue (WAT), and adrenal glands. Diet-altered Tc rhythms differentially affected the profiles of clock genes, Hsp90, and Cirbp expression in peripheral tissues. Greater Tc amplitudes elicited by calorie restriction were associated with large amplitudes of Hsp90 and Cirbp expression in the liver and WAT, in which larger amplitudes of clock gene expression were also observed. The amplitudes of metabolic gene expression were greater in the WAT, but not in the liver, in calorie-restricted rats. Conversely, diet-altered Tc rhythms were not translated to distinct changes in the amplitude of Hsp90, Cirbp, or clock or metabolic genes in the skeletal muscle or adrenal glands. While it was not possible to disentangle the effects of diet and temperature in this model, taken together with previous in vitro studies, our study presents novel data consistent with the notion that the circadian Tc rhythm can modulate the amplitude of circadian gene expression in vivo. The different responses of Hsp90 and Cirbp in peripheral tissues may be linked to the tissue-specific responses of peripheral clocks to diet and/or body temperature rhythms, but the association with the amplitude of metabolic gene expression is limited to the WAT.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102983,100,NA,NA,102983,Zeitgeber; Energy intake; Body clock; Temperature entrainment; Cafeteria feeding; Calorie restriction

Reestablishment of C. seguenzae populations in the depleted habitats requires knowledge of its biology and breeding in captivity. Deformities have a huge impact on offspring survival and quality. Temperature has been recorded to affect the development of deformities in marine gastropods. The present study aims to identify the stage of development at which deformities occur, under four temperature regimes (17, 23, 26 and 29 degrees C). At the stages of trochophore, veliger and free veliger larvae, three capsules that were acclimated at the examined temperatures at the stage of morula were collected, opened and 50 larvae per capsule sampled. Deformities were observed at every examined developmental stage under all tested temperatures. The lower rate of deformities at every stage occurred at 23 degrees C. The higher tested temperature (29 degrees C) was lethal and at the lower tested temperature (17 degrees C) almost every specimen was deformed (96.66\%) at eclosion. The effect of acclimation at four developmental stages (morula, trochophore, shell formation and veliger) on the development of deformities at the free veligers of Charonia seguenzae, was studied under three temperature conditions (17, 26 and 29 degrees C). At eclosion, three capsules were collected, opened and 50 larvae per capsule were sampled. The acclimation at morula and trochophore larva stages led to the higher rates of deformities at eclosion. The size of the free veliger larvae was also affected by temperature with maximum size at eclosion observed at 23 degrees C. Charonia seguenzae's embryos tolerate elevated temperatures within environmental limits (26 degrees C) but near future global warming will probably pose a threat to their survival. The free veliger larvae survival at the environmental minimum is related to the time window of the acclimation, since Triton's embryos are more vulnerable to temperature alterations during the early developmental stages.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103046,100,NA,NA,103046,Charonia seguenzae; Embryonic development; Temperature; Deformities
article,Exercise heat acclimation causes human responses and safety performance improvements,"Zhang, Shuai and Zhu, Neng",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Heat acclimation (HA) is a widely recognized physiological phenomenon of human body in hot environments. HA has many benefits, such aspreventing hyperthermia responses, and is an efficient way to improve human responses to hyperthermal environments. However, it is not known whether HA is dependent on the environmental conditions. Moreover, its mechanism and effect on the safety performance remain unexplored. In this study, we created a climate chamber to simulate a hyperthermal environment. Thirty healthy males were recruited for this study, who were then trained under the same ambient conditions (temperature of 38 degrees C and relative humidity (RH) of 40\%). The training involved running on treadmills (at 5 km/h) to simulate heavy manual labor, and performing heat stress tests (HST) under six different conditions (32 degrees C/40\% RH, 35 degrees C/40\%, 38 degrees C/40\%, 32 degrees C/70\%, 35 degrees C/70\%, and 38 degrees C/70\%). Their physiological indices (rectal temperature, heart rate, sweat loss and skin temperature) and one psychological index (thermal sensation) were measured. Furthermore, a hazard avoidance test device (HATD) was designed to evaluate the individual safety performance by detecting human errors. The results show that training and environmental conditions have different effects on HA. After HA, the physiological and psychological strain were significantly improved. More importantly, HA also helped improve the participants' awareness of the dangers and required emergency responses to face potential hazards. Overall, a reasonable HA training under proper conditions is helpful to ensure the safety of human beings. More research is needed to study the role of HA on safety performance.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103042,100,NA,NA,103042,Hyperthermal environments; Heat acclimation; Physical response; Safety performance; Safety protection
article,Late-stage pregnancy reduces upper thermal tolerance in a live-bearing fish,"Auer, Sonya K. and Agreda, Emily and Chen, Angela Hsuan and Irshad, Madiha and Solowey, Julia",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Upper thermal limits are considered a key determinant of a population's ability to persist in the face of extreme heat events. However, these limits differ considerably among individuals within a population, and the mechanisms underlying this differential sensitivity are not well understood. Upper thermal tolerance in aquatic ecto-therms is thought to be determined by a mismatch between oxygen supply and the increased metabolic demands associated with warmer waters. As such, tolerance is expected to decline during reproduction given the heightened oxygen demand for gamete production and maintenance. Among live-bearing species, upper thermal tolerance of reproductive adults may decline even further after fertilization due to the cost of meeting the increasing oxygen demands of developing embryos. We examined the upper thermal tolerance of live-bearing female Trinidadian guppies at different stages of reproduction and found that critical thermal maximum was similar during the egg yolking and early embryos stage but then declined by almost 0.5 degrees C during late pregnancy when oxygen demands are the greatest. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that oxygen limitation sets thermal limits and show that reproduction is associated with a decline in upper thermal tolerance.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103022,99,NA,NA,103022,Climate change; Critical thermal maximum; CTmax; Gestation; Heat waves; Reproduction
article,Effect of short- and long-term heat exposure on brain monoamines and emotional behavior in mice and rats,"Nakagawa, Hikaru and Ishiwata, Takayuki",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Heat exposure affects several physiological, neuronal, and emotional functions. Notably, monoaminergic neurotransmitters in the brain such as noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin, which regulate several basic physiological functions, such as thermoregulation, food intake, and energy balance, are affected by heat exposure and heat acclimation. Furthermore, cognition and emotional states are also affected by heat exposure and changes in brain monoamine levels. Short-term heat exposure has been reported to increase anxiety in some behavioral tests. In contrast, there is a possibility that long-term heat exposure decreases anxiety due to heat acclimation. These changes might be due to adaptation of the core body temperature and/or brain monoamine levels by heat exposure. In this review, we first outline the changes in brain monoamine levels and thereafter focus on changes in emotional behavior due to heat exposure and heat acclimation.

The acclimation to 24 ?C increased tolerance to high temperatures, as shown in a 24-h exposure experiment and in a temperature elevation experiment. The 50\% lethal temperature (upper incipient lethal temperature) was estimated to be 25.9 ?C and 29.0 ?C for the 12 ?C and 24 ?C acclimation groups, respectively. In subsequent experiments, we tested the effects of high and low temperature acclimation on the food consumption and growth performance of two size groups of juveniles (28.7 ? 2.0 and 34.5 ? 2.9 mm, mean ? SD), that were reared at temperatures ranging from 14 ?C to 23 ?C. The optimal temperature for growth was 20 ?C and did not differ between the acclimation temperatures or between the size groups. However, food consumption and growth performance were suppressed by acute temperature changes. Specifically, feeding and growth were lower in the 24 ?C-acclimated group than in the 12 ?C-acclimated group when exposed to 14 ?C, which is close to the natural water temperature at release in the field. These results suggest that experienced thermal history does not affect the optimal temperature but can affect the growth performance of juveniles. To maximize the post-release growth of hatchery-reared juveniles, the influence of thermal history should be taken into consideration and acute thermal changes before release should be avoided.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102831,97,NA,NA,102831,Flatfish; Acclimation effects; Thermal tolerance; Food consumption; Growth

In recent years, cryo-cabins have been launched with a coverage to limit thermo-dispersion, however a validation study is lacking. The aim of this study was to compare thermal responses after a PBC protocol in an open cryo-cabin or into a cryo-cabin closed at the top with a polyurethane-made lid. Eighteen young male adults completed the two 150 s PBC sessions in a cross-over fashion. Temperature of the inner cabin and thermal responses were measured prior and 1, 5, 10, 20 min after completing each PBC session. When covered, cryo-cabins maintained a lower temperature in the front with respect to the back. There was a significant interaction regarding coverage{*}time{*}position with a main effect of coverage. Body surfaces were significantly colder under covered condition compared to open PBC. Subjects perceived a greater thermal discomfort during a covered PBC rather than during an open condition. For the first time, the use of a coverage placed on the top of the cabin was demonstrated to maintain lower temperatures of the inner environment and the users' skin with respect to a standard PBC. This evidence indicates that practitioners and clinicians making use of PBC can successfully and safely cover cryo-cabins with an insulating lid so to improve the effectiveness of their treatments.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102901,97,NA,NA,102901,Cryotherapy; Skin temperature; Thermal imaging; Thermal discomfort

In many fish species, it has been demonstrated that incubation temperature of eggs influenced the muscle development and growth rates, which persisted throughout the subsequent larval and juvenile phases. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether different incubation temperature of eggs prior to hatching can stimulate the muscle development, growth, and growth-related gene expression of the slow-growing indigenous species of climbing perch. The fertilized eggs of A. testudineus from an artificial breeding program were incubated under control temperature of 24 ?C (IT24), 26 ?C (IT26), 28 ?C (IT28), and 30 ?C (IT30) in 10L glass aquaria with four replicated units for each temperature treatment. After hatching, the larvae from each incubated temperature were separately reared at ambient temperature for 10 days in aquarium, 20 days in hapas, and the next 42 days in cages, totaling 72 days post-hatching (dph). The hatching rates were found significantly (P < 0.05) higher in IT28 compared to the other incubation temperature treatments. After 72 dph, the growth performances (\%length gained, \%weight gained and SGR) were found to be significantly highest (P < 0.05) in the IT28, followed by the treatments IT30, IT26, and IT24, respectively.

article,Role of the thermal environment in scaled quail (<i>Callipepla squamata</i>) nest site selection and survival,"Kauffman, Kiera L. and Elmore, R. Dwayne and Davis, Craig A. and Fuhlendorf, Samuel D. and Goodman, Laura E. and Hagen, Christian A. and Tanner, Evan P.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature is increasingly recognized as an important component of wildlife habitat. Temperature is particularly important for avian nest sites, where extreme temperatures can influence adult behavior, embryonic development, and survival. For species inhabiting arid and semiarid climates, such as the scaled quail (Callipepla squamata), frequent exposure to extreme temperatures may increase the importance of the nest microclimate. Limited data suggest that scaled quail respond to temperature when selecting nest sites, and they are also known to respond to the presence of surface water and shrub cover on the landscape, two resources which may mitigate thermal stress. To better understand the role of temperature in nest site selection and survival, and to evaluate how other landscape resources may benefit nesting quail, we investigated nest site characteristics of scaled quail in southeastern New Mexico, USA. During the breeding seasons of 2018 and 2019 we located nests, monitored nest fate, and recorded thermal and vegetation characteristics at three spatial scales: the nest bowl, the nest microsite (area within 10 m of the nest bowl), and the landscape. We found that nest bowls moderated temperature relative to both the surrounding microsite and the broader landscape, remaining almost 5 degrees C cooler on average than the surrounding microsite at mid-day. Nest bowls also had taller, greater cover of vegetation compared to both the surrounding microsites and the landscape. Despite apparent selection for cooler temperatures and taller vegetation, these characteristics demonstrated a weak relationship with nest survival. Rather, nest survival was positively influenced by proximity to surface water and honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), with survival decreasing with increasing distance from these features. Although the mechanism for this relationship is unclear, our results support the importance of temperature for nest site selection of ground-nesting birds in semiarid landscapes, and suggest further exploration of landscape-level sources of thermal mitigation.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102791,95,NA,NA,102791,Callipepla squamata; Honey mesquite; Microclimate; Nest site selection; Nest survival; Thermal ecology

Consequently, the increase in body core temperature (T-c) might result in heat exhaustion and heatstroke. Thus, continuously following changes in T-c is of utmost importance. Recently, the Tcore sensor (Drager, Germany), which employs a unique dual-sensor heat flux technology, became commercially available to measure Tc, in a hospital-controlled environment. This study aimed to evaluate the possibility of using the Tcore sensor to accurately monitor rectal temperature (T-re), reflecting T-c, under exercise-heat stress. Thirteen healthy young males completed the study protocol, consisting of 90 min of moderate exercise (walking on a treadmill - 5 km/h, 4\% elevation) under controlled hot/dry and hot/wet climatic conditions (30 degrees C/60\% rh, 34 degrees C/40\% rh, and 40 degrees C/40\% rh). Tcore sensors were placed on the forehead and the left wrist. Temperatures from both Tcore sensors were recorded continuously together with T-re using a rectal thermistor. The original algorithm used by the company to estimate T-re from the Tcore sensor was found to be inadequate under the study's conditions and new models for the forehead and the wrist measurements were developed. Nearly 150,000 measurement sets (after filtering) were used to build independent MATLAB software algorithms and test their reliability according to the cross-validation algorithm. Bland-Altman analysis was used to compare between the results obtained by the new models to T-re. The database consisted of a large T-re range (36.5-38.9 degrees C). The mean errors of the models were close to zero, and the mean absolute errors were 0.20 +/- 0.16 degrees C and 0.27 +/- 0.20 degrees C for the forehead and wrist, respectively. 95\% of the measurements from the forehead model and 86\% from the wrist model were within +/- 0.5 degrees C of T-re, and 78\% (forehead) and 64\% (wrist) were within +/- 0.3 degrees C. Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) values were 0.29 degrees C and 0.40 degrees C for the forehead and wrist models, respectively. The developed models show the feasibility to use the Tcore sensor for assessing T-re under exercise-heat conditions. Furthermore, the sensor was found to be adequate for use on the wrist as well, which might be more practical for use in field conditions.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102788,95,NA,NA,102788,Double sensor; Dual heat flux; Non-invasive monitoring; Core temperature; Heat stress; Occupational health

The different thermal tolerances elicited different responses to current and future scenarios. In this sense, O. insularis and O. maya thermal niches stretch from the Caribbean to Florida. Nevertheless, O. insularis may inhabit warmer areas than O. maya. Surprisingly, no area was considered thermally habitable for O. americanus, which could have been associated with the use of data of populations thermally adapted to temperate conditions south of Brazil. According to models, a warming scenario would cause a restriction of the available thermal niche of O. maya, while O. insularis could expand under RCP 6 scenarios. This restriction was more substantial in the RCP 8.5 scenario. Nevertheless, under the RCP 8.5 scenario, the temperature in 2100 may negatively affect even O. insularis, the species most thermal tolerant. If our results are accurate, the fishing yield of O. insularis will increase in the future, replacing the heavily exploited O. maya in the coasts of the southern Gulf of Mexico.

article,"Hypoxia but not shy-bold phenotype mediates thermal preferences in a threatened freshwater fish, <i>Notropis percobromus</i>","Enders, Eva C. and Wall, Alexander J. and Svendsen, Jon C.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"For ectothermic animals, ambient temperature strongly influences developmental growth rate and individual fitness. While many ectotherms live in environments that are spatially hetero-thermal, the coupling between behavioural phenotypes (e.g., shy or bold behaviour) and thermal preferences remains uncertain. Relative to shy counterparts, bolder phenotypes may exert higher preference for ambient temperatures that are closer to their thermal optimum, thereby accelerating development. In addition, ectotherms should select colder temperatures in low oxygen conditions (hypoxia) according to the oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT) hypothesis. Using wild caught carmine shiner (Notropis percobromus), this study examined thermoregulatory behaviour in individuals exhibiting consistent behavioural phenotypes along the shy-bold continuum and between ecologically relevant normal oxygen concentration (normoxic) and hypoxic treatments. Furthermore, the behaviour observed in the laboratory was compared to environmental data from the natal stream. Results demonstrated that individual shy-bold behavioural phenotype was consistent before and after a simulated aerial predator attack, indicating consistency of behaviour across situations. Individual preferred and avoidance temperatures varied substantially, but were unrelated to shy-bold behavioural phenotypes. In contrast, individual preferred and maximum avoidance temperatures were significantly reduced in hypoxia, consistent with the OCLTT hypothesis. These findings might indicate suppressed development rates in hypoxia, not only by the limited oxygen for aerobic metabolism, but also by the preference for colder water in hypoxia. Furthermore, the tolerated thermal ranges were reduced in hypoxia. Using test conditions confirmed by field data, our study demonstrates the strong influence of oxygen availability on thermoregulatory behaviours and preferences in aquatic environments.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.08.001,84,NA,479-487,NA,Boldness; Environmental stress; Hypoxia; Phenotypic variation; Thermoregulatory behaviour; Temperature
article,The mathematics of thermal sub-optimality: Nonlinear regression characterization of thermal performance of reptile metabolic rates,"Tomlinson, Sean",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Although several approaches have been suggested, there is no broadly accepted single approach for quantitative characterization of thermal performance in ectotherms. I sought to identify the most appropriate non-linear function with which to represent thermal performance of ectothermic metabolic rate, and to interrogate the biological relevance of the thermal parameters of this function. I used published data for exercise-induced metabolic rates of eight species of reptile from a broad phylogenetic base and global distribution. Using an Akaike Information Criterion, I compared 12 different models proposed to characterize thermal performance adapted from a broad range of disciplines, finding that a beta-distribution model described the reptile metabolic rate data most parsimoniously. Using the beta-distribution model, unique functions were parameterized for each species. Four parameters were extracted from each species-specific fit: the temperature coincident with the peak of the thermal performance curve, T-opt; the point at which the function intersected the x-axis, CTmax; and two points indicative of thermal breadth, T-d(lower) and T-d(upper) was a positive relationship between the species' preferred body temperatures (T-pref) reported in the scientific literature and both T-opt and T-d(lower) extracted from the species-specific beta functions. While T-d(lower) estimates were not different to published T-pref values, T-opt estimates were statistically higher than T-pref. This is consistent with previous observations that the point of peak performance does not match T-pref. The predicted CTmax, also correlated well with published values. The model in its current form was not able to estimate CTmin, and this parameter was not explored here, but should be in future research. By providing a quantitative description of the thermal performance, the beta-distribution function offers a new theoretical basis for thermal optimality. I contend that T-pref aligns with the mathematical threshold T-d(lower), where metabolic rate is at its maximum prior to thermal inhibition.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.02.008,81,NA,49-58,NA,Thermal performance; Metabolic rate; Non-linear regression; Ectotherm; Reptile; Agamidae; Iguanidae; Scincidae

However, the upper temperature-tolerance range is also typically represented by a metabolic tipping point after which growth suddenly ceases. Free-living nematodes are important members of ecosystems, but little is known about their thermal tolerance. In the present study we measured the population growth rates and body-size distributions of five species of free-living bacterivorous nematodes exposed in the laboratory to a broad range of temperatures. This allowed a determination of their different thermal tolerance ranges, even of closely related species, including Plectus acuminatus (thermal optimum of 20-25 degrees C) and P. cf. velox (10-15 degrees C). With the exception of Acrobeloides now, which had the broadest thermal tolerance range, the population growth of the other species declined between 25 and 30 degrees C. Our results were consistent with the temperature-size rule, as the body-size of the tested species at maturity decreased with increasing temperature. This reduction was accompanied by a smaller number of eggs carried by mature females.

In the present study we evaluate the thermal ecology of six tropical night lizards (genus Lepidophyma) from Mexico. Our results indicate a thermoconformer strategy in most of the studied species.

article,Cooler performance breadth in a viviparous skink relative to its oviparous congener,"Yuan, Felix Landry and Pickett, Evan J. and Bonebrake, Timothy C.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Susceptibility of species to climate change varies depending on many biological and environmental traits, such as reproductive mode and climatic exposure. For example, wider thermal tolerance breadths are associated with more climatically variable habitats and viviparity could be associated with greater vulnerability relative to oviparity. However, few examples exist detailing how such physiological and environmental traits together might shape species thermal performance. In this study we compared the thermal tolerance and performance of two sympatric skink congeners in Hong Kong that differ in habitat use and reproductive mode. The viviparous Sphenomorphus indicus lives on the forest floor while the oviparous Sphenomorphus incognitos occupies stream edges. We quantified the thermal environments in each of these habitats to compare climatic exposure and then calculated thermal safety margins, potential daily activity times within each species' thermal optimal range, and possible climate change vulnerability. Although we did not detect any differences in thermal tolerance range or thermal environments across habitats, we found cooler performance in S. indicus relative to S. incognitos. Moreover, while optimal activity time increases for both skinks under a warming scenario, we project that the thermal safety margin of S. indicus would narrow to nearly zero, thus losing its buffering capacity to potential extreme climate events in the future. This research is thus consistent with recent studies emphasizing the vulnerability of viviparous reptiles to a warming climate. The results together furthermore highlight the complexity in how environmental and physiological traits at multiple spatial scales structure climate change vulnerability of ectothermic species.

article,Thermal responses and perceptions under distinct ambient temperature and wind conditions,"Shimazaki, Yasuhiro and Yoshida, Atsumasa and Yamamoto, Takanori",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Wind conditions are widely recognized to influence the thermal states of humans. In this study, we investigated the relationship between wind conditions and thermal perception and energy balance in humans. The study participants were exposed for 20 min to 3 distinct ambient temperatures, wind speeds, and wind angles. During the exposure, the skin temperatures as a physiological reaction and mental reactions of the human body were measured and the energy balance was calculated based on the human thermal-load method. The results indicate that the human thermal load is an accurate indicator of human thermal states under all wind conditions. Furthermore, wind speed and direction by themselves do not account for the human thermal experience. Because of the thermoregulation that occurs to prevent heat loss and protect the core of the body, a low skin temperature was maintained and regional differences in skin temperature were detected under cool ambient conditions. Thus, the human thermal load, which represents physiological parameters such as skin-temperature change, adequately describes the mixed sensation of the human thermal experience.

article,Physiologically-informed predictions of climate warming effects on native and non-native populations of blue catfish,"Nepal, Vaskar and Dillon, Maggie and Fabrizio, Mary C. and Tuckey, Troy D.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Blue catfish Ictalurus furcatus has been widely introduced throughout the United States to enhance recreational fisheries. Its success in both its native and non-native range, especially in the context of climate change, will be influenced by its thermal performance. We conducted a laboratory experiment to investigate the responses of wild-captured, subadult blue catfish to temperatures ranging from 7 degrees C to 38 degrees C. Blue catfish had relatively low standard metabolic rates, indicating low energetic demands, and hence an ability to survive well even during low-food conditions. Metabolic scope and food consumption rate increased with temperature, with metabolic scope peaking at 29.1 degrees C, and consumption rate peaking at 32 degrees C. Body condition remained high up to 32 degrees C, but decreased drastically thereafter, suggesting limitations in maintaining metabolism through food consumption at temperatures >32 degrees C; blue catfish cannot survive in such habitats indefinitely. Yet, many fish were able to survive temperatures as high as 38 degrees C for 5 days, suggesting that acute and occasionally chronic heat waves will not limit this species. Using these results, we also predicted the performance of blue catfish under prevailing conditions and under climate warming at seven locations throughout their current range in the U.S. We found that some blue catfish populations in southern and southeastern areas will likely experience temperatures above the optimal temperature for extended periods due to climate change, thus limiting potential habitat availability for this species. But, many non-native populations, especially those in northern areas such as Idaho, North Dakota, and northern California, may benefit from the expected warmer temperatures during spring and fall.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103951,124,NA,NA,103951,Blue catfish; Invasive species; Thermal tolerance; aerobic scope; Climate change; Chesapeake Bay

The goal was to determine if HC and/or CC were reliable indicators of thermotolerance on a large scale for future breeding programs. Ninety-three 15-month-old Angus heifers (52 black, 41 red) were evaluated in three periods on a beef cattle farm in Brazil. Heifers were classified by CC and HC, and body weight, body condition score (BCS), and reproductive tract score (RTS) were compared between groups. In the summer evaluation, surface temperature (infrared thermography), internal temperature (intravaginal sensors), sweating rate, and behavior were assessed in a subset of heifers. Temperature-humidity index (THI) was calculated using meteorological data. The proportion of heifers with short, fine, and smooth hair (HC1) increased (P < 0.05) over the evaluations. Heifers with thick, long, and woolly hair (HC3) had lower (P < 0.05) body weights than those with finer coats, regardless of CC. Black heifers had greater (P < 0.05) puberty rates than red heifers in the first two evaluations. At a THI of 66, black heifers with HC1 exhibited a lower (P <0.05) internal temperature compared to black heifers with HC3. At a THI of 75, all heifers with HC1 had lower (P < 0.05) internal temperatures, regardless of CC. Red heifers and those with HC3 experienced hyperthermia for longer (P < 0.05) periods. Neither HC nor CC affected (P > 0.05) surface temperatures or sweating rates. At a THI of 72, more black heifers remained standing, suggesting behavioral adaptation.

The attention threshold was extracted through the median of the extracted data. The findings were narratively discussed. Results: A total of 9 studies have been included after the eligibility criteria selection. The studies presented some differences in terms of acquisition protocol, thermal imaging camera, data extrapolation, and analysis. Despite these differences, the studies presented similar thermal data.

Within the recovery period, a 3-min of PBC at-110 degrees C or CWI at 15 degrees C or a seated rest (CON) was performed. Mean skin temperature (T-skin) decreased by 4.3 f 1.08 degrees C (p < 0.001) immediately after PBC, while CWI induced a reduction of 2.5 f 0.21 degrees C (p < 0.01). Furthermore, PBC and CWI consistently reduced T-skin for 15 and 33 min, respectively (p p < 0.05). During the 2 nd bout, core temperature (T-core) was significantly lower in PBC compared to CON (p < 0.05). Heart rate (HR) was significantly lower in CWI compared to CON and PBC during the intervention period. Thermal sensation (TS) was significantly greater in PBC compared to CON and CWI (p < 0.05). Compared to the 1 st bout, PBC alleviated the declines in T-test (p < 0.05) and 20M-ST (p < 0.05), while CWI alleviated the decreases in T-test (p < 0.05) and YY-T (p < 0.05), concurrently significantly enhancing 20M-ST (p < 0.05). 20M-ST and YY-T was greater from PBC (p < 0.05) and CWI (p < 0.05) compared with CON in 2 nd bout. Additionally, the T-test in CWI was significantly greater than CON (p < 0.05). These results indicate that both PBC and CWI, performed between two exercise bouts, have the potential to improve thermoregulatory strain, reduce thermal perceptual load, and thereby attenuate the subsequent decline in exercise performance.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103926,123,NA,NA,103926,Cold water immersion; Partial body cryotherapy; Heat; Team-sports; Thermoregulation

C. and Frasca, Vince R. and Jeffries, Ken M. and Wilson, Chris C. and Raby, Graham D.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Winter climate is changing rapidly in northern latitudes, and these temperature events have effects on salmonid thermal biology. Stressors during winter egg incubation could reduce hatching success and physiological performance of fall -spawning fishes. Here we quantified the potential for ontogenic carryover effects from embryonic thermal stress in multiple wild and hatchery -origin populations of brook trout ( Salvelinus fontinalis ), a temperate ectotherm native to northeastern North America. Fertilized eggs from four populations were incubated over the winter in the laboratory in four differing thermal regimes: ambient stream -fed water, chronic warming (\& thorn;2 degrees C), ambient with a mid -winter cold -shock, and short-term warming late during embryogenesis (to stimulate an early spring). We examined body size and upper thermal tolerance at the embryonic, fry (10 weeks post -hatch and 27-30 weeks post -hatch) and gravid adult (age 2+) life stages (overall N = 1482). In a separate experiment, we exposed developing embryos to acute seven-day heat stress events immediately following fertilization and at the eyed -egg stage, and then assessed upper thermal tolerance (CT max ) 37 weeks post -hatch. In all cases, fish were raised in common garden conditions after hatch (i.e., same temperatures). Our thermal treatments during incubation had effects that varied by life stage, with incubation temperature and life stage both affecting body size and thermal tolerance. Embryos incubated in warmer treatment groups had higher thermal tolerance; there was no effect of the mid -winter melt event on embryo CT max . Ten weeks after hatch, fry from the ambient and cold -shock treatment groups had higher and less variable thermal tolerance than did the warmer treatment groups. At 27-30 post -hatch and beyond, differences in thermal tolerance among treatment groups were negligible. Collectively, our study suggests that brook trout only exhibit short-term carryover effects from thermal stressors during embryo incubation, with no lasting effects on phenotype beyond the first few months after hatch.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103880,122,NA,NA,103880,Critical thermal maximum; CTmax; Salmonid; Ontogeny; Embryos; Fry; Acclimation
article,Urea and glucose modulation during freezing exposure in three temperate frogs reveals specific targets in relation to climate,"de Amaral, Marjoriane and Carvajalino-Fernandez, Juan Manuel and Nicieza, Alfredo G. and Tejedo, Miguel",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Amphibian diversity is most prominent in the warm and humid tropical and subtropical regions across the globe. Nonetheless, amphibians also inhabit high -altitude tropical mountains and regions at medium and high latitudes, exposing them to subzero temperatures and requiring behavioural or physiological adaptations to endure freezing events. While freeze tolerance has been predominantly reported in high -latitude zones where species endure prolonged freezing (several weeks or months), less is known about mid -latitudes amphibians exposed to occasional subzero temperatures. In this study, we employed a controlled ecological protocol, subjecting three frog species from the Iberian Peninsula ( Rana parvipalmata , Epidalea calamita , and Pelobates cultripes ) to a 2-h exposure to temperatures of -2 degrees C to investigate the accumulation of urea and glucose as physiological mechanisms associated with survival at freezing temperatures. Our results revealed a moderate response in the production of cryoprotectant metabolites under experimental freezing conditions, particularly urea, with notable findings in R. parvipalmata and E. calamita and no response in P. cultripes . However, no significant alterations in glucose concentrations were observed in any of the studied frog species. This relatively weak freezing tolerance response differs from the strong response exhibited by amphibians inhabiting high latitudes and enduring prolonged freezing conditions, suggesting potential reliance on behavioural adaptations to cope with occasional freezing episodes.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103854,121,NA,NA,103854,Frogs; Freezing -tolerance; Glucose; Urea; Rana parvipalmata; Epidalea calamita; Pelobates cultripes
article,Resetting thermal limits: 10-year-old white sturgeon display pronounced but reversible thermal plasticity,"Weber, Theresa A. and Dichiera, Angelina M. and Brauner, Colin J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"While many ectotherms improve thermal tolerance in response to prolonged thermal stress, little is known about the lasting effects of warm acclimation after returning to cooler temperatures. Furthermore, thermal stress may disproportionately impact threatened and endangered species. To address this, we repeatedly measured critical thermal maxima ((CTmaxC)-C-degrees) and associated stress responses (hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, plasma cortisol) of endangered subadult white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) in response to control temperature (pre-acclimation; 14(degrees)C), after 1 month at either control or warm temperature (acclimation; 14C or 20(degrees)C), and after one smonth following return to control temperature (post-acclimation; 14(degrees)C). While control fish demonstrated fairly repeatable thermal tolerance (interclass correlation coefficient = 0.479), warm-acclimated fish experienced a -3.1(degrees)C increase in thermal tolerance and when re-acclimated to control temperature, decreased thermal tolerance -1.9(degrees)C. Hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, and final splenic somatic index (spleen mass relative to whole body mass, collected after post-acclimation CTmax) were not significantly different between control and treatment fish, suggesting no effects of warm acclimation on aerobic capacity. Plasma cortisol was significantly higher in control fish after pre-acclimation and post-acclimation CTmax trials, but importantly, acclimation temperature did not affect this response. Strikingly, final hepatosomatic index (relative liver size) was 45\% lower in treatment fish, indicating warm acclimation may have lasting effects on energy usage and metabolism, even after reacclimating to control temperature. To our knowledge, these 10-year-old subadult sturgeon are the oldest sturgeon experimentally tested with regards to thermal plasticity and demonstrate incredible capacity for thermal acclimation relative to other fishes. However, more research is needed to determine whether the ability to acclimate to warm temperature may come with a persistent cost.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103807,119,NA,NA,103807,Phenotypic plasticity; Climate change; Temperature; CTmax
article,Field study on pregnant women's thermal preference in different trimesters in winter,"Yang, Sijin and Wang, Lijuan and Zhang, Hui and Yang, Ji and Li, Wenhui and Zhang, Yijin",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"This study investigated the differences in the thermal preferences of pregnant women during various trimesters and the factors influencing these preferences. The survey was conducted in a hospital waiting room, encompassing the testing of thermal environmental parameters, and the distribution of questionnaires to pregnant women. These questionnaires encompassed various aspects, including basic information, thermal responses, pregnancy diseases, and more. In total, 1388 questionnaires were collected, distributed across the first trimester (225 participants), second trimester (498 participants), and third trimester (665 participants). The findings revealed a notable shift in the thermal preferences of pregnant women as their pregnancies progressed, transitioning from a preference for warmer conditions to a preference for cooler environments. Specifically, the mean thermal preference scores for the first, second, and third trimesters were 0.82, -0.27, and -1.76, respectively. These shifting preferences were associated with various factors, including pregnancy diseases, pre-pregnancy body mass index (PBMI), and exercise habits. Notably, hyperthyroidism, a higher PBMI, and regular exercise were correlated with a preference for cooler conditions, whereas hypothyroidism, anemia, a lower PBMI, and rare exercise were associated with a preference for warmer environments. Furthermore, it was observed that the actual neutral temperatures for pregnant women in the first, second, and third trimesters were 20.3 degrees C, 19.5 degrees C, and 19 degrees C, respectively. By contrast, the predicted neutral temperatures were 23.5 degrees C for the first and third trimesters and 23.4 degrees C for the second trimester. This indicated that the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) model tended to underestimate the acceptability that pregnant women experienced in colder environments. Given the unique thermal preferences of pregnant women, further research is essential to refine thermal comfort parameters and the PMV model tailored specifically to this demographic.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103744,118,NA,NA,103744,Individual difference; Pregnant woman; Thermal preference; Pregnancy diseases; Exercise
article,Parasitism does not reduce thermal limits in the intermediate host of a bopyrid isopod,"Sasaki, Matthew and Woods, Charles and Dam, Hans G.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Parasitism has strong effects on community dynamics. Given the detrimental effects parasites have on host health, infection or infestation might be expected to reduce upper thermal limits, increasing the vulnerability of host species to future climate change. Copepods are integral components of aquatic food webs and biogeo-chemical cycles. They also serve as intermediate hosts in the life cycle of parasitic isopods in the family Bopyridae. As both copepods and isopod parasites play important roles in aquatic communities, it is important to understand how the interaction between parasite and host affects thermal limits in order to better predict how community dynamics may change in a warming climate. Here we examined the effect of infestation by larvae of a bopyrid isopod on the cosmopolitan copepod Acartia tonsa to test the hypothesis that infestation reduces thermal limits. To aid with this work, we developed an affordable, highly portable system for measuring critical thermal maxima of small ectotherms. We also used meta-analysis to summarize the effects of parasitism on critical thermal maxima in a wider range of taxa to help contextualize our findings. Contrary to both our hypothesis and the results of previous studies, we observed no reduction of thermal limits by parasitism in A. tonsa. These results suggest that life history of the host and parasite may interact to determine how parasite infestation affects environmental sensitivity.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103712,117,NA,NA,103712,Acartia tonsa; Copepod; Thermal tolerance; CTmax; Parasitism; Meta-analysis

Thus, resource programs are commonly used to manage water quality conditions for endemic species. In a river system like the Nechako River system, central British Columbia, a water management program was established in the 1980s to alter water release in the summer months to prevent water temperatures from exceeding a 20 degrees C threshold downstream during the spawning season of Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Such a management regime could have consequences for other resident species like the white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus). Here, we use a hydrothermal model and white sturgeon life stage-specific experimental thermal tolerance data to evaluate water releases and potential hydrothermal impacts based on the Nechako water management plan (1980-2019). Our analysis focused mainly on the warmest five-month period of the year (May to September), which includes the water release management period (July-August). Our results show that the thermal exposure risk, an index that measures temperature impact on species physiology of Nechako white sturgeon across all early life stages (embryo, yolk-sac larvae, larvae, and juvenile) has increased substantially, especially in the 2010s relative to the management program implementations' first decade (the 1980s). The embryonic life stage was the most impacted, with a continuous increase in potential adverse thermal exposure in all months examined in the study. We also recorded major impacts of increased thermal exposure on the critical habitats necessary for Nechako white sturgeon recovery. Our study highlights the importance of a holistic management program with consideration for all species of the Nechako River system and the merit of possibly reviewing the current management plan, particularly with the current concerns about climate change impacts on the Nechako River.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103682,117,NA,NA,103682,Nechako river; Thermal exposure; White sturgeon; Temperature; Physiological limits

Hege and Haugen, Fred",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Transient potential (TRP) ion channels expressed in primary sensory neurons act as the initial detectors of environmental cold and heat, information which controls muscle energy expenditure. We hypothesize that nonneuronal TRPs have direct cellular responses to thermal exposure, also affecting cellular metabolism. In the present study we show expression of TRPA1, TRPM8 and TRPV1 in rat skeletal muscle and human primary myotubes by qPCR. Effects of TRP activity on metabolism in human myotubes were studied using radiolabeled glucose. FURA-2 was used for Ca2+ imaging. TRPA1, TRPM8 and TRPV1 were expressed at low levels in primary human myotubes and in m. gastrocnemius, m. soleus, and m. trapezius from rat. Activation of TRPA1 by ligustilide resulted in an increased glucose uptake and oxidation in human myotubes, whereas activation of TRPM8 by menthol and icilin significantly decreased glucose uptake and oxidation. Activation of heat sensing TRPV1 by capsaicin had no effect on glucose metabolism. Agonist-induced increases in intracellular Ca2+ levels by ligustilide and icilin in human myotubes confirmed a direct activation of TRPA1 and TRPM8, respectively. The mRNA expression of some genes involved in thermogenesis, i.e. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1 \& alpha;), uncoupling protein (UCP) 1 and UCP3, were downregulated in human myotubes following TRPA1 activation, while the mRNA expression of TRPM8 and TRPA1 were downregulated following TRPM8 activation by menthol and icilin, respectively. Cold exposure (18 degrees C) of cultured myotubes followed by a short recovery period had no effect on glucose uptake and oxidation in the basal situation, however when TRPA1 and TRPM8 channels were chemically inhibited a temperature-induced difference in glucose metabolism was found. In conclusion, mRNA of TRPA1, TRPM8 and TRPV1 are expressed in rat skeletal muscle and human skeletal muscle cells. Modulation of TRPA1 and TRPM8 by chemical agents induced changes in Ca2+ levels and glucose metabolism in human skeletal muscle cells, indicating functional receptors.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103623,116,NA,NA,103623,Transient receptor potential; Glucose metabolism; Cold exposure; Skeletal muscle; In vitro

Human trials were performed on ten participants in warm and hot environments. Physiological responses (core temperature, skin temperature, and heart rate), and perceptual responses (thermal sensation vote, thermal comfort vote, restriction of perceived exertion (RPE), wetness of skin, and wetness of clothing) were recorded throughout the trials, and subsequently, the physiological strain index (PSI), and perceptual strain index (PeSI) were calculated. The results indicated that the PeSI showed a significant moderate association with the PSI, and was capable of predicting PSI for low (PSI = 3) and high (PSI = 7) levels of physiological strain with the areas under the curves of 0.80 and 0.64, respectively. Moreover, Bland-Altman analysis indicated that the majority of the PSI ranged within the 95\% confidence interval, and the mean dif-ference between PSI and PeSI was 0.14 +/- 2.02 with the lower 95\% limit and upper 95\% limit being-3.82 to 4.10, respectively. Therefore, the subjective responses could be used as an indicator for predicting physiological strain while wearing SRBA.

Fever of unknown origins, once an infectious or tumor agent have been ruled out as possible causes, may originate with an autoimmune disease. Objective: To determine the role of febrile temperatures on the stability of antigens pertinent to autoimmunity, and on the immune complexes they form with commercial therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Methods: Using molecular dynamics simulations, the binding between four antigens belonging to a set of autoimmune diseases and their individual monoclonal antibodies was investigated under different febrile temperatures. Results: It was determined that at febrile temperatures, monoclonal antibodies used in the therapy of autoimmune diseases bind with higher binding free energy to pertinent antigens, once the autoimmune condition has been established and treatment is warranted.

article,Low-cost thermoregulation of wild sloths revealed by heart rate and temperature loggers,"Muramatsu, Daisuke and Vidal, Leandro Vieira and Costa, Edson Rodrigues and Yoda, Ken and Yabe, Tsuneaki and Gordo, Marcelo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Arboreal herbivores require large digestive tracts for leaf fermentation and detoxification; however, they must also have a low body mass that allows them to reach the foliage. The three-toed sloth, Bradypus tridactylus, experiences this trade-off, as leaves comprise 97.2\% of its diet. Their calorie intake is extremely low owing to the low available caloric density of leaves and slow digestive processes related to leaf fibre fermentation and sec-ondary compound detoxification. Sloths may require a high body temperature to assist fermentation; however, thermogenesis is energy-consuming. To investigate how sloths accomplish thermoregulation using marginal energy, we attached heart rate (HR) and temperature loggers to wild B. tridactylus individuals inhabiting the Amazon rainforest and recorded their HR and body surface temperature (Tskin). Tskin changed with ambient temperature (Ta) but was higher than Ta in 99.2\% of cases. Increases in Tskin and HR did not coincide, suggesting that the increases were not caused by thermogenesis. Instead, they may passively increase Tskin by selecting warmer microhabitats and sunbathing. Consequently, 90.5\% of Tskin were within 27.6-36.0 degrees C while the Ta fluctuated between 21.5 and 42.9 degrees C. This low-cost thermoregulation results in a low HR. In this study, the mean HR during observation was approximately 38.4\% of the expected value based on the mammalian allometric relationship between body mass and HR. Thus, these properties may contribute to the low metabolic rates of sloths, alleviating their restricted energy intake.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103387,110,NA,NA,103387,Thermoregulation; Energy saving; Body temperature; Heart rate; Bio-logging; Bradypus tridactylus

In a randomized crossover design, nine physically active men performed two 30-min cycling bouts that consisted of 25-min constant-paced cycling at 55\% of maximal oxygen uptake followed by a 5-min TT in the heat (35 degrees C, 50\% relative humidity). The two bouts were separated by a 15-min break. During the break, participants were assigned to a control trial (CON; 5 g kg- 1 fluid ingestion at room temperature) or a mixed-method cooling trial (COOL; 5 g kg -1 ice slurry ingestion and cooling vest to cool the neck and torso).
