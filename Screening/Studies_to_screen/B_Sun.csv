article,Effect of stress on female-specific ornamentation,"Weiss, Stacey L. and Mulligan, Emily E. and Wilson, Dawn S. and Kabelik, David",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Signal honesty is theorized to be maintained by condition-dependent trait expression. However, the mechanisms mediating the condition dependence of sexually selected traits are often unknown. New work suggests that elevated glucocorticoid levels during physiological stress may play a role in maintaining signal honesty. Here, we experimentally examine the effect of both chronic and acute stress on the expression of the condition-dependent ornamentation of female striped plateau lizards, Sceloporus virgatus. Females were stressed either chronically via corticosterone implants or relatively acutely via autotomy, were sham manipulated or were left unmanipulated. Both stressors resulted in elevations in corticosterone within physiologically relevant levels, though the implants resulted in significantly higher levels than did autotomy. Corticosterone-implanted females were less likely to produce a clutch of eggs, but those individuals that did reproduce had reproductive output similar to that of females from other treatment groups. Compared with females in other groups, the corticosterone-implanted females tended to develop smaller ornaments that had less UV and orange-to-red wavelength reflectance relative to medium wavelength reflectance. The sex steroid hormones testosterone and estradiol were correlated to corticosterone levels, but did not appear to underlie the effect on ornament expression; of the steroids measured, only corticosterone levels were negatively related to ornament size and coloration. Thus, the condition-dependent ornamentation of female lizards is sensitive to chronic elevations in stress hormones, supporting their importance in the maintenance of signal honesty.",2013,10.1242/jeb.080937,216,14,2641-2647,NA,autotomy; corticosterone; reproductive suppression; Sceloporus; sex steroids; sexual selection
article,Novel muscle and connective tissue design enables high extensibility and controls engulfment volume in lunge-feeding rorqual whales,"Shadwick, Robert E. and Goldbogen, Jeremy A. and Potvin, Jean and Pyenson, Nicholas D. and Vogl, A. Wayne",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Muscle serves a wide variety of mechanical functions during animal feeding and locomotion, but the performance of this tissue is limited by how far it can be extended. In rorqual whales, feeding and locomotion are integrated in a dynamic process called lunge feeding, where an enormous volume of prey-laden water is engulfed into a capacious ventral oropharyngeal cavity that is bounded superficially by skeletal muscle and ventral groove blubber (VGB). The great expansion of the cavity wall presents a mechanical challenge for the physiological limits of skeletal muscle, yet its role is considered fundamental in controlling the flux of water into the mouth. Our analyses of the functional properties and mechanical behaviour of VGB muscles revealed a crimped microstructure in an unstrained, non-feeding state that is arranged in parallel with dense and straight elastin fibres. This allows the muscles to accommodate large tissue deformations of the VGB yet still operate within the known strain limits of vertebrate skeletal muscle. VGB transverse strains in routine-feeding rorquals were substantially less than those observed in dead ones, where decomposition gas stretched the VGB to its elastic limit, evidence supporting the idea that eccentric muscle contraction modulates the rate of expansion and ultimate size of the ventral cavity during engulfment.",2013,10.1242/jeb.081752,216,14,2691-2701,NA,ventral groove blubber; collagen; elastin; muscle morphology; Balaenopteridae
article,A comparison of two methods for estimating critical swimming speed (<i>U</i><sub>crit</sub>) in larval fathead minnows: the laminar flow assay and the spinning task assay,"Krzykwa, Julie C. and Lamanteer, Gabriella S. and Jeffries, Marlo K. Sellin",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Critical swimming speed (U-crit) is considered a good predictor of swimming capabilities in fish. To estimate U-crit, a fish is exposed to an incrementally increasing laminar flow of water until it cannot maintain its position against the current. The spinning task assay has been proposed as an alternative method to traditional laminar flow methods; however, these methods have not been directly compared. Thus, the goal of this study was to determine whether the spinning task assay is a suitable alternative to traditional laminar flow assays. To that end, the performance of fathead minnows in each assay was compared at three time points (14, 19 and 24 days post-fertilization, dpf). In 14 dpf fish, U-crit estimates were similar regardless of the assay used. However, at 19 and 24 dpf, U-crit estimates derived from the two assay types were significantly different. This indicates that the assays are not equivalent to one another and that the spinning task assay is not a suitable alternative to the laminar flow assay for the determination of U-crit.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242856,224,24,NA,jeb242856,Swimming ability; Early life stage; Fish larvae; Cardiovascular performance
article,Infection with schistosome parasites in snails leads to increased predation by prawns: implications for human schistosomiasis control,"Swartz, Scott J. and De Leo, Giulio A. and Wood, Chelsea L. and Sokolow, Susanne H.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Schistosomiasis - a parasitic disease that affects over 200 million people across the globe - is primarily transmitted between human definitive hosts and snail intermediate hosts. To reduce schistosomiasis transmission, some have advocated disrupting the schistosome life cycle through biological control of snails, achieved by boosting the abundance of snails' natural predators. But little is known about the effect of parasitic infection on predator-prey interactions, especially in the case of schistosomiasis. Here, we present the results of laboratory experiments performed on Bulinus truncatus and Biomphalaria glabrata snails to investigate: (i) rates of predation on schistosome-infected versus uninfected snails by a sympatric native river prawn, Macrobrachium vollenhovenii, and (ii) differences in snail behavior (including movement, refuge-seeking and anti-predator behavior) between infected and uninfected snails. In predation trials, prawns showed a preference for consuming snails infected with schistosome larvae. In behavioral trials, infected snails moved less quickly and less often than uninfected snails, and were less likely to avoid predation by exiting the water or hiding under substrate. Although the mechanism by which the parasite alters snail behavior remains unknown, these results provide insight into the effects of parasitic infection on predator-prey dynamics and suggest that boosting natural rates of predation on snails may be a useful strategy for reducing transmission in schistosomiasis hotspots.",2015,10.1242/jeb.129221,218,24,3962-3967,NA,Parasitism; Behavior manipulation; Biological control; Schistosoma
article,Orchestration of salivary secretion mediated by two different dopamine receptors in the blacklegged tick <i>Ixodes scapularis</i>,"Kim, Donghun and Simo, Ladislav and Park, Yoonseong",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Salivary secretion is crucial for successful tick feeding, and it is the mediator of pathogen transmission. Salivation functions to inhibit various components of the host immune system and remove excess water and ions during the ingestion of large blood meals. Control of salivary glands involves autocrine/paracrine dopamine, which is the most potent inducer of tick salivation. Previously, we reported the presence of two dopamine receptors in the salivary glands of the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis): dopamine receptor (D1) and invertebrate specific D1-like dopamine receptor (InvD1L). Here, we investigated the different physiological roles of the dopamine receptors in tick salivary glands by using pharmacological tools that discriminate between the two distinct receptors. Heterologous expressions followed by reporter assays of the dopamine receptors identified receptor-specific antagonists and agonists. These pharmacological tools were further used to discriminate the physiological role of each receptor by using in vitro assays: measuring salivary secretions of isolated salivary glands and monitoring dynamic changes in the size of individual salivary gland acini. We propose that the D1 receptor acts on salivary gland acini epithelial cells for inward fluid transport. InvD1L controls (or modulates) each acinus for expelling saliva from the acini to the salivary ducts, presumably through the actions of myoepithelial cells and valves for pumping/gating. We conclude that dopamine acts on the D1 and the InvD1L receptors and leads different physiological actions to orchestrate tick salivary secretion.",2014,10.1242/jeb.109462,217,20,3656-3663,NA,Tick salivary secretion; Osmoregulation; G-protein-coupled receptor
article,Parallel evolution of opsin visual pigments in hawkmoths by tuning of spectral sensitivities during transition from a nocturnal to a diurnal ecology,"Akiyama, Tokiho and Uchiyama, Hironobu and Yajima, Shunsuke and Arikawa, Kentaro and Terai, Yohey",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Light environments differ dramatically between day and night. The transition between diurnal and nocturnal visual ecology has happened repeatedly throughout evolution in many species. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the evolution of vision in recent diurnal-nocturnal transition is poorly understood. Here, we focus on hawkmoths (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae) to address this question by investigating five nocturnal and five diurnal species. We performed RNA-sequencing analysis and identified opsin genes corresponding to the ultraviolet (UV), short-wavelength (SW) and long-wavelength (LW)-absorbing visual pigments. We found no significant differences in the expression patterns of opsin genes between the nocturnal and diurnal species. We then constructed the phylogenetic trees of hawkmoth species and opsins. The diurnal lineages had emerged at least three times from the nocturnal ancestors. The evolutionary rates of amino acid substitutions in the three opsins differed between the nocturnal and diurnal species. We found an excess number of parallel amino acid substitutions in the opsins in three independent diurnal lineages. The numbers were significantly more than those inferred from neutral evolution, suggesting that positive selection acted on these parallel substitutions. Moreover, we predicted the visual pigment absorption spectra based on electrophysiologically determined spectral sensitivity in two nocturnal and two diurnal species belonging to different clades. In the diurnal species, the LW pigments shift 10 nm towards shorter wavelengths, and the SW pigments shift 10 nm in the opposite direction. Taken together, our results suggest that parallel evolution of opsins may have enhanced the colour discrimination properties of diurnal hawkmoths in ambient light.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244541,225,23,NA,jeb244541,Parallel evolution; Visual adaptation; Opsin; Spectral sensitivity; Diurnal-nocturnal transition; Hawkmoth
article,"Effects of the juvenile hormone analogue methoprene on rate of behavioural development, foraging performance and navigation in honey bees (<i>Apis mellifera</i>)","Chang, Lun-Hsien and Barron, Andrew B. and Cheng, Ken",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Worker honey bees change roles as they age as part of a hormonally regulated process of behavioural development that ends with a specialised foraging phase. The rate of behavioural development is highly plastic and responsive to changes in colony condition such that forager losses, disease or nutritional stresses accelerate behavioural development and cause an early onset of foraging in workers. It is not clear to what degree the behavioural development of workers can be accelerated without there being a cost in terms of reduced foraging performance. Here, we compared the foraging performance of bees induced to accelerate their behavioural development by treatment with the juvenile hormone analogue methoprene with that of controls that developed at a normal rate. Methoprene treatment accelerated the onset of both flight and foraging behaviour in workers, but it also reduced foraging span, the total time spent foraging and the number of completed foraging trips. Methoprene treatment did not alter performance in a short-range navigation task, however. These data indicate a limitation to the physiological plasticity of bees, and a trade off between forager performance and the speed at which bees begin foraging. Chronic stressors will be expected to reduce the mean age of the foraging force, and therefore also reduce the efficiency of the foraging force. This interaction may explain why honey bee colonies react to sustained stressors with non-linear population decline.",2015,10.1242/jeb.119198,218,11,1715-1724,NA,Precocious foraging; Radio frequency identification; Life span; Homing; Stressors
article,Behavioural responses of threespine stickleback with lateral line asymmetries to experimental mechanosensory stimuli,"Planidin, Nicholas P. and Reimchen, Thomas E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Behavioural asymmetry, typically referred to as laterality, is widespread among bilaterians and is often associated with asymmetry in brain structure. However, the influence of sensory receptor asymmetry on laterality has undergone limited investigation. Here we used threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) to investigate the influence of lateral line asymmetry on laterality during lab simulations of three mechanosensation-dependent behaviours: predator evasion, prey localization and rheotaxis. We recorded the response of stickleback to impacts at the water surface and water flow in photic conditions and low-frequency oscillations in the dark, across four repeat trials. We then compared individuals' laterality with asymmetry in the number of neuromasts on either side of their body. Stickleback hovered with their right side against the arenawall 57\% of the time (P<0.001) in illuminated surface impact trials and 56\% of the time (P=0.085) in dark low-frequency stimulation trials. Light regime modulated the effect of neuromast count on laterality, as fish with more neuromasts were more likely to hover with the wall on their right during illumination (P=0.007) but were less likely to do so in darkness (P=0.025). Population-level laterality diminished in later trials across multiple behaviours and individuals did not show a consistent side bias in any behaviours. Our results demonstrate a complex relationship between sensory structure asymmetry and laterality, suggesting that laterality is modulated by multiple sensory modalities and is temporally dynamic.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243661,225,2,NA,jeb243661,Laterality; Sensory receptor asymmetry; Side preference; Predator evasion; Rheotaxis; Prey localization
article,Terrestrial force production by the limbs of a semi-aquatic salamander provides insight into the evolution of terrestrial locomotor mechanics,"Kawano, Sandy M. and Blob, Richard W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Amphibious fishes and salamanders are valuable functional analogs for vertebrates that spanned the water-land transition. However, investigations of walking mechanics have focused on terrestrial salamanders and, thus, may better reflect the capabilities of stem tetrapods that were already terrestrial. The earliest tetrapods were likely aquatic, so salamanders that are not primarily terrestrial may yield more appropriate data for modeling the incipient stages of terrestrial locomotion. In the present study, locomotor biomechanics were quantified from semi-aquatic Pleurodeles waltl, a salamander that spends most of its adult life in water, and then compared with those of a primarily terrestrial salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) and a semi-aquatic fish (Periophthalmus barbarus) to evaluate whether terrestrial locomotion was more comparable between species with ecological versus phylogenetic similarities. Ground reaction forces (GRFs) from individual limbs or fins indicated that the pectoral appendages of each taxon had distinct patterns of force production, but GRFs from the hindlimbs were comparable between the salamander species. The rate at which force is produced can affect musculoskeletal function, so we also calculated `yank' (first time derivative of force) to quantify the dynamics of GRF production. Yank was sometimes slower in P. warn but there were some similarities between the three species. Finally, the semi-aquatic taxa (P. waft/and P. barbarus) had a more medial inclination of the GRF compared to terrestrial salamanders, potentially elevating bone stresses among more aquatic taxa and limiting their excursions onto land.",2022,10.1242/jeb.242795,225,7,NA,jeb242795,Biomechanics; Ground reaction force; Terrestrial locomotion; Salamander; Fish; Yank
article,Sound production mechanism in <i>Gobius paganellus</i> (Gobiidae),"Parmentier, Eric and Kever, Loic and Boyle, Kelly and Corbisier, Yves-Eric and Sawelew, Ludovic and Malavasi, Stefano",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Gobiidae, the largest fish family (>1500 species), has species from at least 10 genera that produce sounds for communication. Studies focused on goby sound production mechanisms have suggested that sounds are produced by the forcible ejection of water through small apertures in the opercles (hydrodynamic mechanism). The present study was a multidisciplinary investigation (morphology, muscle histology, high-speed video, sound analysis and electromyography) of the sound emission mechanism in Gobius paganellus, which produces both pulsed and tonal calls. Two populations were used, from Brittany and Venice. In the French population, sounds were accompanied by a suite of coordinated movements of the buccal, branchial and opercular regions. This was not the case in the Venetian population, and thus the direct role of head movements in sound production was rejected. The hydrodynamic mechanism hypothesis was also rejected in G. paganellus on the basis of sound oscillogram shape and because sounds are still produced after the opercles and hyohyoid muscles are cut. The use of both electromyography and electron microscopy showed that the levator pectoralis muscle, which originates on the skull and inserts on the dorsal tip of the cleithrum, is involved in sound production. We propose that the contraction of this muscle and associated vibration of the large radials is used to make sounds. In addition, we propose that different sound types (pulsed sounds and tonal calls) could occur because of differences in fish size.",2013,10.1242/jeb.087205,216,17,3189-3199,NA,Gobiidae; sonic mechanism; sonic muscle; grunt; tonal; call
article,High temperature induces transcriptomic changes in <i>Crassostrea gigas</i> that hinder progress of ostreid herpesvirus (OsHV-1) and promote survival,"Delisle, Lizenn and Pauletto, Marianna and Vidal-Dupiol, Jeremie and Petton, Bruno and Bargelloni, Luca and Montagnani, Caroline and Pernet, Fabrice and Corporeau, Charlotte and Fleury, Elodie",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Of all environmental factors, seawater temperature plays a decisive role in triggering marine diseases. Like fever in vertebrates, high seawater temperature could modulate the host response to pathogens in ectothermic animals. In France, massive mortality of Pacific oysters, Crassostrea gigas, caused by the ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1) is markedly reduced when temperatures exceed 24 degrees C in the field. In the present study we assess how high temperature influences the host response to the pathogen by comparing transcriptomes (RNA sequencing) during the course of experimental infection at 21 degrees C (reference) and 29 degrees C. We show that high temperature induced host physiological processes that are unfavorable to the viral infection. Temperature influenced the expression of transcripts related to the immune process and increased the transcription of genes related to the apoptotic process, synaptic signaling and protein processes at 29 degrees C. Concomitantly, the expression of genes associated with catabolism, metabolite transport, macromolecule synthesis and cell growth remained low from the first stage of infection at 29 degrees C. Moreover, viral entry into the host might have been limited at 29 degrees C by changes in extracellular matrix composition and protein abundance.

article,Effect of temperature on leg kinematics in sprinting tarantulas (<i>Aphonopelma hentzi</i>): high speed may limit hydraulic joint actuation,"Booster, N. A. and Su, F. Y. and Adolph, S. C. and Ahn, A. N.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Tarantulas extend the femur-patella (proximal) and tibia-metatarsal (distal) joints of their legs hydraulically. Because these two hydraulically actuated joints are positioned in series, hemolymph flowwithin each leg is expected to mechanically couple the movement of the joints. In the current study, we tested two hypotheses: (1) at lower temperatures, movement of the two in-series hydraulic joints within a leg will be less coupled because of increased hemolymph viscosity slowing hemolymph flow; and (2) at higher temperatures, movement of the two in-series hydraulic joints will be less coupled because the higher stride frequencies limit the time available for hemolymph flow. We elicited maximal running speeds at four ecologically relevant temperatures (15, 24, 31 and 40 degrees C) in Texas Brown tarantulas (Aphonopelma hentzi). The spiders increased sprint speed 2.5-fold over the temperature range by changing their stride frequency but not stride length. The coefficient of determination for linear regression (R-2) of the proximal and distal joint angles was used as the measure of the degree of coupling between the two joints. This coupling coefficient between the proximal and distal joint angles, for both forelegs and hindlegs, was significantly lowest at the highest temperature at which the animals ran the fastest with the highest stride frequencies. The coordination of multiple, in-series hydraulically actuated joints may be limited by operating speed.",2015,10.1242/jeb.111922,218,7,977-982,NA,Arachnids; Locomotion; Running
article,Aquatic and terrestrial takeoffs require different hindlimb kinematics and muscle function in mallard ducks,"Taylor-Burt, Kari R. and Biewener, Andrew A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Mallard ducks are capable of performing a wide range of behaviors including nearly vertical takeoffs from both terrestrial and aquatic habitats. The hindlimb plays a key role during takeoffs from both media. However, because force generation differs in water versus on land, hindlimb kinematics and muscle function are likely modulated between these environments. Specifically, we hypothesize that hindlimb joint motion and muscle shortening are faster during aquatic takeoffs, but greater hindlimb muscle forces are generated during terrestrial takeoffs. In this study, we examined the hindlimb kinematics and in vivo contractile function of the lateral gastrocnemius (LG), a major ankle extensor and knee flexor, during takeoffs from water versus land in mallard ducks. In contrast to our hypothesis, we observed no change in ankle angular velocity between media. However, the hip and metatarsophalangeal joints underwent large excursions during terrestrial takeoffs but exhibited almost no motion during aquatic takeoffs. The knee extended during terrestrial takeoffs but flexed during aquatic takeoffs. Correspondingly, LG fascicle shortening strain, shortening velocity and pennation angle change were greater during aquatic takeoffs than during terrestrial takeoffs because of the differences in knee motion. Nevertheless, we observed no significant differences in LG stress or work, but did see an increase in muscle power output during aquatic takeoffs. Because differences in the physical properties of aquatic and terrestrial media require differing hindlimb kinematics and muscle function, animals such as mallards may be challenged to tune their muscle properties for movement across differing environments.",2020,10.1242/jeb.223743,223,16,NA,jeb223743,Joint motion; Lateral gastrocnemius; Stress; Fascicle strain; Work; Power
article,"The effect of ecological factors on eye morphology in the western rainbowfish, <i>Melanotaenia australis</i>","Lisney, Thomas J. and Collin, Shaun P. and Kelley, Jennifer L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Ecological factors such as spatial habitat complexity and diet can explain variation in visual morphology, but few studies have sought to determine whether visual specialisation can occur among populations of the same species. We used a small Australian freshwater fish (the western rainbowfish, Melanotaenia australis) to determine whether populations showed variation in eye size and eye position, and whether this variation could be explained by environmental (light availability, turbidity) and ecological (predation risk, habitat complexity, invertebrate abundance) variables. We investigated three aspects of eye morphology - (1) eye size relative to body size, (2) pupil size relative to eye size and (3) eye position in the head - for fish collected from 14 sites in a major river catchment in northwest Western Australia. We found significant variation among populations in all three measures of eye morphology, but no effect of sex on eye size or eye position. Variation in eye diameter and eye position was best explained by the level of habitat complexity. Specifically, fish occurring in habitats with low complexity (i.e. open water) tended to have smaller, more dorsally located eyes than those occurring in more complex habitats (i.e. vegetation present). The size of the pupil relative to the size of the eye was most influenced by the presence of surrounding rock formations; fish living in gorge habitats had significantly smaller pupils (relative to eye size) than those occupying semi-gorge sites or open habitats. Our findings reveal that different ecological and environmental factors contribute to habitatspecific visual specialisations within a species.",2020,10.1242/jeb.223644,223,10,NA,jeb223644,Eye position; Eye size; Freshwater fish; Morphometrics; Predation risk; Pupil size

Shell formation is a tightly regulated biological process that allows molluscs to build their shells even in environments unfavorable for mineral precipitation. Outer mantle edge epithelial cells (OME) and hemocytes were implicated in this process; however, the exact functions of these cell types in biomineralization are not clear. Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) were used to study differences in the expression profiles of selected biomineralization-related genes in hemocytes and mantle cells, and the functional characteristics of hemocytes such as adhesion, motility and phagocytosis. The specialized role of OME in shell formation was supported by high expression levels of the extracellular matrix (ECM) related and cell-cell interaction genes. Density gradient separation of hemocytes revealed distinct phenotypes based on the cell morphology, gene expression patterns, motility and adhesion characteristics. These hemocyte fractions can be categorized into two functional groups, i.e. biomineralization and immune response cells. Gene expression profiles of the putative biomineralizing hemocytes indicate that in addition to their proposed role in mineral transport, hemocytes also contribute to the formation of the ECM, thus challenging the current paradigm of the mantle as the sole source of the ECM for shell formation. Our findings corroborate the specialized roles of hemocytes and the OME in biomineralization and emphasize complexity of the biological controls over shell formation in bivalves.",2017,10.1242/jeb.160861,220,18,3209-3221,NA,Gene expression; Ion transport; Matrix protein; Exoskeleton; Cell-cell interaction; Immunity; Bivalve
article,Modulation of upper limb joint work and power during sculling while ballasted with varying loads,"Lauer, Jessy and Rouard, Annie Helene and Vilas-Boas, Joao Paulo",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The human musculoskeletal system must modulate work and power output in response to substantial alterations in mechanical demands associated with different tasks. In particular, in water, upper limb muscles must perform net positive work to replace the energy lost against the dissipative fluid load. Where in the upper limb are work and power developed? Is mechanical output modulated similarly at all joints, or are certain muscle groups favored? This study examined, for the first time, how work and power per stroke are distributed at the upper limb joints in seven male participants sculling while ballasted with 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 kg. Upper limb kinematics was captured and used to animate body virtual geometry. Net wrist, elbow and shoulder joint work and power were subsequently computed through a novel approach integrating unsteady numerical fluid flow simulations and inverse dynamics modeling. Across a threefold increase in load, total work and power significantly increased from 0.38 +/- 0.09 to 0.67 +/- 0.13 J kg(-1), and 0.47 +/- 0.06 to 1.14 +/- 0.16 W kg(-1), respectively. Shoulder and elbow equally supplied >97\% of the upper limb total work and power, coherent with the proximo-distal gradient of work performance in the limbs of terrestrial animals. Individual joint relative contributions remained constant, as observed on land during tasks necessitating no net work. The apportionment of higher work and power simultaneously at all joints in water suggests a general motor strategy of power modulation consistent across physical environments, limbs and tasks, regardless of whether or not they demand positive net work.",2017,10.1242/jeb.154781,220,9,1729-1736,NA,Swimming; Kinetics; Load; Inverse dynamics; Computational fluid dynamics
article,"Environmental, population and life-stage plasticity in the visual system of Atlantic cod","Valen, Ragnhild and Karlsen, Rita and Helvik, Jon Vidar",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The visual system is for many fishes essential in guiding behaviors, such as foraging, predator avoidance and mate choice. The marine environment is characterized by large spatio-temporal fluctuations in light intensity and spectral composition. However, visual capabilities are restricted by both space limitations set by eye size and by the genomic content of light-absorbing opsin genes. The rich array of visual opsins in teleosts may be used differentially to tune vision towards specific needs during ontogeny and to changing light. Yet, to what extent visual plasticity is a pre-programmed developmental event, or is triggered by photic environment, is unclear. Our previous studies on Atlantic cod revealed an evolutionary genomic loss of UV-sensitive sws1 and red-sensitive lws opsin families, while blue-sensitive sws2 and green-sensitive rh2 opsins had duplicated. The current study has taken an opsin expression approach to characterize visual plasticity in cod towards different spectral light during the larval stage, to maturation and extreme seasonal changes in the Barents Sea. Our data suggest that opsin plasticity in cod larvae is controlled by developmental programme rather than immediate light environment. The lack of expressional changes during maturation suggests a less important role for visual modulation related to mate choice. Although no seasonal effects on visual opsins were detected in migratory Northeast Arctic cod, the expressed opsin subset differed from the more stationary Norwegian coastal cod described in previous studies. Interestingly, these data provide the first indications of a population difference in actively used visual opsins associated with cod ecotypes.",2018,10.1242/jeb.165191,221,1,NA,jeb165191,Opsin; Retina; Larvae; Maturation; Population; Northeast Arctic cod
article,How do <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> worms survive in highly viscous habitats?,"Suzuki, Yuki and Kikuchi, Kenji and Numayama-Tsuruta, Keiko and Ishikawa, Takuji",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a filter feeder that lives in various viscous habitats such as soil, the intestines of slugs, and rotting materials such as fruits and stems. Caenorhabditis elegans draws in suspensions of bacteria and separates bacteria from water using the pharyngeal pump. Although these worms often live in highly viscous habitats, it is still unclear how they survive in these environments by eating bacteria. In this study, we investigated the effects of suspension viscosity on the survival rate of malnourished worms by combining live imaging and scaling analyses. We found that survival rate decreased with increases in viscosity because the high viscosity suppressed the amount of food ingested. The same tendency was found in two feeding-defective mutants, eat-6(ad467) and eat-6(ad997). We also found that the high viscosity weakened pump function, but the velocities in the pharynx were not zero, even in the most viscous suspensions. Finally, we estimated the amount of ingested food using scaling analyses, which provided a master curve of the experimental survival rates. These results illustrate that the survival rate of C. elegans worms is strongly dependent on the ingested bacteria per unit time associated with physical environments, such as the viscosity of food suspensions and the cell density of bacteria. The pump function of the C. elegans pharynx is not completely lost even in fluids that have 105 times higher viscosity than water, which may contribute to their ability to survive around the world in highly viscous environments.",2020,10.1242/jeb.224691,223,15,NA,jeb224691,Nematode; Pharynx; High viscosity; Survival rate; Malnutrition; Pump function

We performed a controlled experiment with zebra finches to examine how songbirds use nutrition to manage trade-offs in antioxidant allocation between endurance flight and subsequent reproduction. Our treatment groups included (1) a non-supplemented, non-exercised group (control group) fed a standard diet with no exercise beyond that experienced during normal activity in an aviary; (2) a supplemented non-exercised group fed a water-and lipid-soluble antioxidant-supplemented diet with no exercise; (3) a non-supplemented exercised group fed a standard diet and trained to perform daily endurance flight for 6 weeks; and (4) a supplemented exercised group fed an antioxidant-supplemented diet and trained to perform daily flight for 6 weeks. After flight training, birds were paired within treatment groups for breeding. We analyzed eggs for lutein and vitamin E concentrations and the plasma of parents throughout the experiment for non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity and oxidative damage. Exercised birds had higher oxidative damage levels than non-exercised birds after flight training, despite supplementation with dietary antioxidants. Supplementation with water-soluble antioxidants decreased the deposition of lipid-soluble antioxidants into eggs and decreased yolk size. Flight exercise also lowered deposition of lutein, but not vitamin E, to eggs. These findings have important implications for future studies of wild birds during migration and other oxidative challenges.",2016,10.1242/jeb.137802,219,17,2716-2725,NA,Antioxidant capacity; Lipid oxidation; Repeated measures; Reproduction; Songbirds

We investigated the functional basis of this foraging by video-recording larval and juvenile zebrafish as they preyed on zooplankton (Artemia sp.) under infrared illumination. We found that foraging improved with age, to the extent that 1-month-old juveniles exhibited a capture rate that was an order of magnitude greater than that of hatchlings. At all ages, the ability to forage in the dark was diminished when we used a chemical treatment to compromise the cranial superficial neuromasts, which facilitate flow sensing. However, a morphological analysis showed no developmental changes in these receptors that could enhance sensitivity. We tested whether the improvement in foraging with age could instead be a consequence of learning by raising fish that were naive to the flow of prey. After 1 month of growth, both groups foraged with a capture rate that was significantly less than that of fish that had the opportunity to learn and indistinguishable from that of fish with no ability to sense flow. This suggests that larval fish learn to use water flow to forage in the dark. This ability could enhance resource acquisition under reduced competition and predation. Furthermore, our findings offer an example of learning in a model system that offers promise for understanding its neurophysiological basis.",2016,10.1242/jeb.128918,219,4,582-589,NA,Behavior; Flow; Foraging; Larvae; Lateral line; Learning
article,Size dependence in non-sperm ejaculate production is reflected in daily energy expenditure and resting metabolic rate,"Friesen, Christopher R. and Powers, Donald R. and Copenhaver, Paige E. and Mason, Robert T.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The non-sperm components of an ejaculate, such as copulatory plugs, can be essential to male reproductive success. But the costs of these ejaculate components are often considered trivial. In polyandrous species, males are predicted to increase energy allocation to the production of non-sperm components, but this allocation is often condition dependent and the energetic costs of their production have never been quantified. Red-sided garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis) are an excellent model with which to quantify the energetic costs of non-sperm components of the ejaculate as they exhibit a dissociated reproductive pattern in which sperm production is temporally disjunct from copulatory plug production, mating and plug deposition. We estimated the daily energy expenditure and resting metabolic rate of males after courtship and mating, and used bomb calorimetry to estimate the energy content of copulatory plugs. We found that both daily energy expenditure and resting metabolic rate were significantly higher in small mating males than in courting males, and a single copulatory plug without sperm constitutes 5-18\% of daily energy expenditure. To our knowledge, this is the first study to quantify the energetic expense of size-dependent ejaculate strategies in any species.",2015,10.1242/jeb.120402,218,9,1410-1418,NA,Energetic costs of reproduction; Size dependence; Copulatory plug; Ejaculates; Thamnophis
article,Active downward propulsion by oyster larvae in turbulence,"Fuchs, Heidi L. and Hunter, Elias J. and Schmitt, Erika L. and Guazzo, Regina A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Oyster larvae (Crassostrea virginica) could enhance their settlement success by moving toward the seafloor in the strong turbulence associated with coastal habitats. We characterized the behavior of individual oyster larvae in grid-generated turbulence by measuring larval velocities and flow velocities simultaneously using infrared particle image velocimetry. We estimated larval behavioral velocities and propulsive forces as functions of the kinetic energy dissipation rate epsilon, strain rate gamma, vorticity xi and acceleration alpha. In calm water most larvae had near-zero vertical velocities despite propelling themselves upward (swimming). In stronger turbulence all larvae used more propulsive force, but relative to the larval axis, larvae propelled themselves downward (diving) instead of upward more frequently and more forcefully. Vertical velocity magnitudes of both swimmers and divers increased with turbulence, but the swimming velocity leveled off as larvae were rotated away from their stable, velum-up orientation in strong turbulence. Diving speeds rose steadily with turbulence intensity to several times the terminal fall velocity in still water. Rapid dives may require a switch from ciliary swimming to another propulsive mode such as flapping the velum, which would become energetically efficient at the intermediate Reynolds numbers attained by larvae in strong turbulence. We expected larvae to respond to spatial or temporal velocity gradients, but although the diving frequency changed abruptly at a threshold acceleration, the variation in propulsive force and behavioral velocity was best explained by the dissipation rate. Downward propulsion could enhance oyster larval settlement by raising the probability of larval contact with oyster reef patches.",2013,10.1242/jeb.079855,216,8,1458-1469,NA,acceleration; Crassostrea virginica; dissipation rate; force balance; larval behavior; velocity gradients

Atlantic salmon Salmo salar (Linnaeus) show some of the greatest within-population variability in life history strategies amongst vertebrates, with multiple discrete male and female life histories co-existing and interbreeding on many spawning grounds, although the effect of the various combinations of life histories on offspring traits remains unknown. Using crosses of wild fish we show here that the life history strategy of both parents was significantly associated with a range of offspring traits. Mothers that had spent longer at sea (2 versus 1 year) produced offspring that were heavier, longer and in better condition at the time of first feeding. However, these relationships disappeared shortly after fry had begun feeding exogenously. At this stage, the juvenile rearing environment (i.e. time spent in fresh water as juveniles) of the mother was a better predictor of offspring traits, with mothers that were faster to develop in fresh water (migrating to sea after two rather than three years of age) producing offspring that had higher maximal metabolic rates, aerobic scopes, and that grew faster. Faster developing fathers (1 year old sneaker males) tended to produce offspring that had higher maximal metabolic rates, were in better body condition and grew faster. The results suggest that both genetic effects and those related to parental early and late life history contribute to offspring traits.",2016,10.1242/jeb.122531,219,3,374-382,NA,Salmo salar; Early development; Indirect genetic effects; Maternal effects; Parental effects; Paternal effects; Salmonid metabolism

A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Fundamental scaling relationships influence the physiology of vital rates, which in turn shape the ecology and evolution of organisms. For diving mammals, benefits conferred by large body size include reduced transport costs and enhanced breath-holding capacity, thereby increasing overall foraging efficiency. Rorqual whales feed by engulfing a large mass of prey-laden water at high speed and filtering it through baleen plates. However, as engulfment capacity increases with body length (engulfment volumeabody length(3,57)), the surface area of the baleen filter does not increase proportionally (baleen areaxbody length(1)(,8)(2)), and thus the filtration time of larger rorquals predictably increases as the baleen surface area must filter a disproportionally large amount of water. We predicted that filtration time should scale with body length to the power of 1.75 (filter timaxbody length(1)(,7)(5)). We tested this hypothesis on four rorqual species using multi-sensor tags with corresponding unoccupied aircraft systems-based body length estimates. We found that filter time scales with body length to the power of 1.79 (95\% Cl: 1.61-1.97). This result highlights a scale-dependent trade-off between engulfment capacity and baleen area that creates a biomechanical constraint to foraging through increased filtration time. Consequently, larger whales must target high-density prey patches commensurate to the gulp size to meet their increased energetic demands. If these optimal patches are absent, larger rorquals may experience reduced foraging efficiency compared with smaller whales if they do not match their engulfment capacity to the size of targeted prey aggregations.",2020,10.1242/jeb.224196,223,20,NA,jeb224196,Filtration; Scaling; Baleen whale; Constraints
article,Hearing of the African lungfish (Protopterus annectens) suggests underwater pressure detection and rudimentary aerial hearing in early tetrapods,"Christensen, Christian Bech and Christensen-Dalsgaard, Jakob and Madsen, Peter Teglberg",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In the transition from an aquatic to a terrestrial lifestyle, vertebrate auditory systems have undergone major changes while adapting to aerial hearing. Lungfish are the closest living relatives of tetrapods and their auditory system may therefore be a suitable model of the auditory systems of early tetrapods such as Acanthostega. Therefore, experimental studies on the hearing capabilities of lungfish may shed light on the possible hearing capabilities of early tetrapods and broaden our understanding of hearing across the water-to-land transition. Here, we tested the hypotheses that (i) lungfish are sensitive to underwater pressure using their lungs as pressure-toparticle motion transducers and (ii) lungfish can detect airborne sound. To do so, we used neurophysiological recordings to estimate the vibration and pressure sensitivity of African lungfish (Protopterus annectens) in both water and air. We show that lungfish detect underwater sound pressure via pressure-to-particle motion transduction by air volumes in their lungs. The morphology of lungfish shows no specialized connection between these air volumes and the inner ears, and so our results imply that air breathing may have enabled rudimentary pressure detection as early as the Devonian era. Additionally, we demonstrate that lungfish in spite of their atympanic middle ear can detect airborne sound through detection of sound-induced head vibrations. This strongly suggests that even vertebrates with no middle ear adaptations for aerial hearing, such as the first tetrapods, had rudimentary aerial hearing that may have led to the evolution of tympanic middle ears in recent tetrapods.",2015,10.1242/jeb.116012,218,3,381-387,NA,Auditory evoked potentials; Early tetrapods; Auditory system; Vibration detection

In recent decades, this species has become increasingly dependent on rice fields, thereby relying on a plant-based diet for fuelling. Dietary fatty acids (FA) seem to be determinant to the composition of accumulated subcutaneous fat in migratory birds. It is still unclear whether metabolic plasticity allows for modification and/ or synthesis of FA, contributing to a lipid profile that enables a successful migratory performance. Deuterated water was administered to captive black-tailed godwits submitted to two diets (fly larvae versus rice) and the incorporation of deuterium (H-2) into subcutaneous triglycerides was analyzed by NMR. A recently developed localized biopsy method for sampling subcutaneous fat was employed with later successful release of all birds into the wild. The average chemical structure reflected mostly a mixture of saturated and monounsaturated 16- and 18- carbon FA, a profile frequently found in migrant birds. Significantly higher levels of polyunsaturated FA, as well as detectable levels of n-3 FA, were observed in fly-larvae-fed birds. Excess H-2-enrichments in FA revealed significantly higher rates of fractional de novo lipogenesis and FA desaturation capacity in rice-fed birds. This novel and nonlethal tracer method revealed the capacity of this species to alter its lipid metabolism to compensate for a poorer dietary lipid contribution. Because of its versatility, adapting this method to other scenarios and/ or other migratory species is considered feasible and costeffective.",2017,10.1242/jeb.150490,220,6,1072-1078,NA,NMR; Deuterated water; Lipogenesis; Migration; Lipid accumulation; Godwits

Although previous motion analyses revealed their basic swimming characteristics, the details of the 3D wing kinematics, wing deformation and thrust generation mechanism of penguins are still largely unknown. In this study, we recorded the forward and horizontal swimming of gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) at an aquarium with multiple underwater action cameras and then performed a 3D motion analysis. We also conducted a series of water tunnel experiments with a 3D printed rigid wing to obtain lift and drag coefficients in the gliding configuration. Using these coefficients, the thrust force during flapping was calculated in a quasi-steady manner, where the following two wing models were considered: (1) an `original' wing model reconstructed from 3D motion analysis including bending deformation and (2) a `flat' wing model obtained by flattening the original wing model. The resultant body trajectory showed that the penguin accelerated forward during both upstroke and downstroke. The motion analysis of the two wing models revealed that considerable bending occurred in the original wing, which reduced its angle of attack during the upstroke in particular. Consequently, the calculated stroke-averaged thrust was larger for the original wing than for the flat wing during the upstroke. In addition, the propulsive efficiency for the original wing was estimated to be 1.8 times higher than that for the flat wing. Our results unveil a detailed mechanism of lift-based propulsion in penguins and underscore the importance of wing bending.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242140,224,21,NA,jeb242140,Gentoo penguin Pygoscelis papua; Wing kinematics; Wing deformation; Flapping wing; Three-dimensional motion analysis; Quasi-steady hydrodynamic analysis
article,Eat yourself sexy: how selective macronutrient intake influences the expression of a visual signal in common mynas,"Peneaux, Chloe and Machovsky-Capuska, Gabriel E. and Endler, John A. and Griffin, Andrea S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Producing colored signals often requires consuming dietary carotenoid pigments. Evidence that food deprivation can reduce coloration, however, raises the question of whether other dietary nutrients contribute to signal coloration, and furthermore, whether individuals can voluntarily select food combinations to achieve optimal coloration. We created a two-way factorial design to manipulate macronutrient and carotenoid access in common mynas (Acridotheres tristis) and measured eye patch coloration as a function of the food combinations individuals selected. Mynas had access to either water or carotenoid-supplemented water and could either eat a standard captive diet or choose freely between three nutritionally defined pellets (protein, lipid or carbohydrate). Mynas supplemented with both carotenoids and macronutrient pellets had higher color scores than control birds. Male coloration tended to respond more to nutritional manipulation than females, with color scores improving in macronutrient- and carotenoid-supplemented individuals compared with controls. All mynas consuming carotenoids had higher levels of plasma carotenoids, but only males showed a significant increase by the end of the experiment. Dietary carotenoids and macronutrient intake consumed in combination tended to increase plasma carotenoid concentrations the most. These results demonstrate for the first time that consuming specific combinations of macronutrients along with carotenoids contributes to optimizing a colorful signal, and point to sex-specific nutritional strategies. Our findings improve our knowledge of how diet choices affect signal expression and, by extension, how nutritionally impoverished diets, such as those consumed by birds in cities, might affect sexual selection processes and, ultimately, population dynamics.",2021,10.1242/jeb.241349,224,9,NA,jeb241349,Acridotheres tristis; Carotenoids; Coloration; Foraging; Macronutrients; Signaling
article,Common guillemot (<i>Uria aalge</i>) eggs are not self-cleaning,"Jackson, Duncan and Thompson, Jamie E. and Hemmings, Nicola and Birkhead, Timothy R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Birds are arguably the most evolutionarily successful extant vertebrate taxon, in part because of their ability to reproduce in virtually all terrestrial habitats. Common guillemots, Uria aalge, incubate their single egg in an unusual and harsh environment; on exposed cliff ledges, without a nest, and in close proximity to conspecifics. As a consequence, the surface of guillemot eggshells is frequently contaminated with faeces, dirt, water and other detritus, which may impede gas exchange or facilitate microbial infection of the developing embryo. Despite this, guillemot chicks survive incubation and hatch from eggs heavily covered with debris. To establish how guillemot eggs cope with external debris, we tested three hypotheses: (1) contamination by debris does not reduce gas exchange efficacy of the eggshell to a degree that may impede normal embryo development; (2) the guillemot eggshell surface is self-cleaning; (3) shell accessory material (SAM) prevents debris from blocking pores, allowing relatively unrestricted gas diffusion across the eggshell. We showed that natural debris reduces the conductance of gases across the guillemot eggshell by blocking gas exchange pores. Despite this problem, we found no evidence that guillemot eggshells are self-cleaning, but instead showed that the presence of SAM on the eggshell surface largely prevents pore blockages from occurring. Our results demonstrate that SAM is a crucial feature of the eggshell surface in a species with eggs that are frequently in contact with debris, acting to minimise pore blockages and thus ensure a sufficient rate of gas diffusion for embryo development.",2018,10.1242/jeb.188466,221,23,NA,jeb188466,Common murre; Faeces; Eggshell; Gas conductance; Incubation; Embryo development
article,Dynamic biosonar adjustment strategies in deep-diving Risso's dolphins driven partly by prey evasion,"Jensen, Frants H. and Keller, Onno A. and Tyack, Peter L. and Visser, Fleur",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Toothed whales have evolved flexible biosonar systems to find, track and capture prey in diverse habitats. Delphinids, phocoenids and iniids adjust inter-click intervals and source levels gradually while approaching prey. In contrast, deep-diving beaked and sperm whales maintain relatively constant inter-click intervals and apparent output levels during the approach followed by a rapid transition into the foraging buzz, presumably to maintain a long-range acoustic scene in a multi-target environment. However, it remains unknown whether this rapid biosonar adjustment strategy is shared by delphinids foraging in deep waters. To test this, we investigated biosonar adjustments of a deep-diving delphinid, the Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus). We analyzed inter-click interval and apparent output level adjustments recorded from sound recording tags to quantify in situ sensory adjustment during prey capture attempts. Risso's dolphins did not follow typical (20logR) biosonar adjustment patterns seen in shallow-water species, but instead maintained stable repetition rates and output levels up to the foraging buzz. Our results suggest that maintaining a long-range acoustic scene to exploit complex, multi-target prey layers is a common strategy amongst deep-diving toothed whales. Risso's dolphins transitioned rapidly into the foraging buzz just like beaked whales during most foraging attempts, but employed a more gradual biosonar adjustment in a subset (19\%) of prey approaches. These were characterized by higher speeds and minimum specific acceleration, indicating higher prey capture efforts associated with evasive prey. Thus, tracking and capturing evasive prey using biosonar may require a more gradual switch between multi-target echolocation and single-target tracking.",2020,10.1242/jeb.216283,223,3,NA,jeb216283,Echolocation; Sensory ecology; Mesopelagic foraging; Deep-water environment; Biosonar strategies; Gain control
article,Sensorimotor control of swimming Polypterus senegalus is preserved during sensory deprivation conditions across altered environments,"Hainer, Jeffrey and Lutek, Keegan and Maki, Hailey and Standen, Emily M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Control of locomotion involves the interplay of sensory signals and motor commands. Sensory information is essential for adjusting locomotion in response to environmental changes. A previous study using mathematical modelling of lamprey swimming has shown that, in the absence of sensory feedback, increasing fluid viscosity constrains swimming kinematics, limiting tail amplitude and body wavelength, resulting in decreased swimming speed. In contrast, previous experiments with Polypterus senegalus reported increased magnitude swimming kinematics (increased body curvature, body wave speed and frequency, and pectoral fin frequency) in high viscosity water suggesting that sensory information is used to adjust swimming form. It is not known what sensory systems are providing the necessary information to respond to these environmental changes. We tested the hypothesis that lateral line and visual input are responsible for the sensory-driven increase in swimming kinematics in response to experimentally increased fluid viscosity. The kinematics of five P. senegalus were recorded in two different viscosities of water while removing lateral line and visual sensory feedback. Unlike the mathematical model devoid of sensory feedback, P. senegalus with lateral line and/or visual senses removed did not reduce the magnitude of swimming kinematic variables, suggesting that additional sensory feedback mechanisms are present in these fish to help overcome increased fluid viscosity. Increases in swimming speed when both lateral line and visual sensory feedback were removed suggest that lateral line and visual information may be used to regulate swimming speed in P. senegalus, possibly using an internal model of predictions to adjust swimming form.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245192,226,9,NA,jeb245192,Fish; Lateral line; Vision; Viscosity; Sensorimotor; Locomotion; Polypterus

S. and Wilga, Cheryl D. and Brainerd, Elizabeth L. and Camp, Ariel L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Despite the importance of intraoral food transport and swallowing, relatively few studies have examined the biomechanics of these behaviors in non-tetrapods, which lack a muscular tongue. Studies show that elasmobranch and teleost fishes generate water currents as a `hydrodynamic tongue' that presumably transports food towards and into the esophagus. However, it remains largely unknown how specific musculoskeletal motions during transport correspond to food motion. Previous studies of white-spotted bamboo sharks (Chiloscyllium plagiosum) hypothesized that motions of the hyoid, branchial arches and pectoral girdle, generate caudal motion of the food through the long oropharynx of modern sharks. To test these hypotheses, we measured food and cartilage motion with XROMM during intra-oropharyngeal transport and swallowing (N=3 individuals, 2-3 trials per individual). After entering the mouth, food does not move smoothly toward the esophagus, but rather moves in distinct steps with relatively little retrograde motion. Caudal food motion coincides with hyoid elevation and a closed mouth, supporting earlier studies showing that hyoid motion contributes to intra-oropharyngeal food transport by creating caudally directed water currents. Little correspondence between pectoral girdle and food motion was found, indicating minimal contribution of pectoral girdle motion. Transport speed was fast as food entered the mouth, slower and step-wise through the pharyngeal region and then fast again as it entered the esophagus. The food's static periods in the step-wise motion and its high velocity during swallowing could not be explained by hyoid or girdle motion, suggesting these sharks may also use the branchial arches for intra-oropharyngeal transport and swallowing.",2019,10.1242/jeb.201426,222,22,NA,jeb201426,Chiloscyllium plagiosum; Food transport; Swallowing; XROMM

Females rely on audition to detect and locate `singing' males that produce multiharmonic advertisement calls in the shallow-water, intertidal breeding environments. Previous work showed that females possess sexually dimorphic, horn-like rostral swim bladder extensions that extend toward the primary auditory end organs, the saccule and lagena. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the rostral swim bladder extensions in females increase auditory sensitivity to sound pressure and higher frequencies, which potentially could enhance mate detection and localization in shallow-water habitats. We recorded the auditory evoked potentials that originated from hair cell receptors in the saccule of control females with intact swim bladders and compared them with those from treated females (swim bladders removed) and type I males (intact swim bladders lacking rostral extensions). Saccular potentials were recorded from hair cell populations in vivo while behaviorally relevant pure-tone stimuli (75-1005 Hz) were presented by an underwater speaker. The results indicate that control females were approximately 5-11 dB re. 1 mu Pa more sensitive to sound pressure than treated females and type I males at the frequencies tested. A higher percentage of the evoked saccular potentials were recorded from control females at frequencies >305 Hz than from treated females and type I males. This enhanced sensitivity in females to sound pressure and higher frequencies may facilitate the acquisition of auditory information needed for conspecific localization and mate choice decisions during the breeding season.",2019,10.1242/jeb.204552,222,14,NA,jeb204552,Saccule; Hearing; Gas bladder; Communication

These include Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE), V-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase, HCO3- transporters and Rhesus proteins. Consequently, renal acid output in the form of protons and NH4+ increases. However, little is known about the mechanistic details of renal acid-base regulation in C. auratus and teleost fishes in general. The present study applied the scanning ion-selective electrode technique (SIET) to measure proton flux in proximal, distal and connecting tubules of goldfish. We detected increased H+ efflux into the extracellular fluid from the tubule in fed animals, resulting from paracellular back-flux of H+ through the tight junction. By applying inhibitors for selected acid-base regulatory epithelial transporters, we found that cytosolic carbonic anhydrase and HCO3- transporters were important in mediating H+ flux in all three tubule segments of fed goldfish.Contrastingly, V-ATPase seemed to play a role in H+ flux only in proximal and distal tubules, and NHE in proximal and connecting tubules. We developed working models for transport of acid-base relevant equivalents (H+, HCO3-, NH3/NH4+) for each tubule segment in C. auratus kidney. While the proximal tubule appears to play a major role in both H+ secretion and HCO3- reabsorption, the distal and connecting tubules seem to mainly serve for HCO3- reabsorption and NH3/NH4+ secretion.",2019,10.1242/jeb.200964,222,13,NA,jeb200964,Freshwater teleost; Renal epithelium; Acidosis; SIET

T. and Ramos, Erica and Martins, Cesar and Carleton, Karen L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"An adaptive visual system is essential for organisms inhabiting new or changing light environments. The Panama Canal exhibits such variable environments owing to its anthropogenic origin and current human activities. Within the Panama Canal, Lake Gatun harbors several exotic fish species including the invasive peacock bass (Cichla monoculus), a predatory Amazonian cichlid. In this research, through spectral measurements and molecular and physiological experiments, we studied the visual system of C. monoculus and its adaptive capabilities. Our results suggest that (1) Lake Gatun is a highly variable environment, where light transmission changes throughout the canal waterway, and that (2) C. monoculus has several visual adaptations suited for this red-shifted light environment. Cichla monoculus filters short wavelengths (similar to 400 nm) from the environment through its ocular media and tunes its visual sensitivities to the available light through opsin gene expression. More importantly, based on shifts in spectral sensitivities of photoreceptors alone, and on transcriptome analysis, C. monoculus exhibits extreme intraspecific variation in the use of vitamin A(1)/A(2) chromophore in their photoreceptors. Fish living in turbid water had higher proportions of vitamin A(2), shifting sensitivities to longer wavelengths, than fish living in clear water. Furthermore, we also found variation in retinal transcriptomes, where fish from turbid and clear waters exhibited differentially expressed genes that vary greatly in their function.

MTs are outpouchings of the gut and in most insects demonstrate proximodistal heterogeneity in function. In most insects, such heterogeneity is confined to ion/fluid secretion in the distal portion and ion/fluid reabsorption in the proximal portion. In contrast, MTs of larval Lepidoptera (caterpillars of butterflies and moths) are composed of five regions that differ in their association with the gut, their structure and ion/fluid transport function. Recent studies have shown that several regions can rapidly and reversibly switch between ion secretion and reabsorption. The present study employed RNAseq, pharmacology and electrophysiology to characterize four distinct regions of the MT in larval Trichoplusia ni. Luminal microelectrode measurements indicate changes in {[}K+], {[}Na+] and pH as fluid passes through different regions of the tubule. In addition, the regions examined differ in gene ontology enrichment, and demonstrate robust gradients in expression of ion transporters and endocrine ligand receptors.

However, measurements of total energy expenditure (TEE; kcal day(-1)) are available only for a limited number of marine mammals, because large body size and inaccessible habitats make TEE measurements expensive and difficult to obtain for many taxa. We measured TEE in 10 adult common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) living in natural seawater lagoons at two facilities (Dolphin Research Center and Dolphin Quest) using the doubly labeled water method. We assessed the relative effects of body mass, age and physical activity on TEE. We also examined whether TEE of bottlenose dolphins, and more generally of marine mammals, differs from that expected for their body mass compared with other eutherian mammals, using phylogenetic least squares (PGLS) regressions. There were no differences in body mass or TEE (unadjusted TEE and TEE adjusted for fat-free mass) between dolphins from the two facilities. Our results show that adjusted TEE decreased and fat mass increased with age. Different measures of activity were not related to age, body fat or adjusted TEE. Both PGLS and the non-phylogenetic linear regression indicate that marine mammals have an elevated TEE compared with that of terrestrial mammals. However, bottlenose dolphins expended 17.1\% less energy than other marine mammals of similar body mass. The two oldest dolphins (>40 years) showed a lower TEE, similar to the decline in TEE seen in older humans.

A remarkable case is the Mexican blind cavefish Astyanax fasciatus, which evolved the ability to detect non-moving obstacles. The swimming body of A. fasciatus generates fluid disturbances, the alteration of which by an obstacle can be sensed by the fish's lateral line system. It is generally accepted that these alterations can provide information on the distance to the obstacle. We observed that A. fasciatus swimming in an unfamiliar environment open and close their mouths at high frequency (0.7-4.5 Hz) in order to generate suction flows. We hypothesized that repeated mouth suction generates a hydrodynamic velocity field, which is altered by an obstacle, inducing pressure gradients in the neuromasts of the lateral line and corresponding strong lateral line stimuli. We observed that the frequency and rate of mouth-opening events varied with the fish's distance to obstacles, a hallmark of pulse-based navigation mechanisms such as echolocation. We formulated a mathematical model of this hitherto unrecognized mechanism of obstacle detection and parameterized it experimentally. This model suggests that suction flows induce lateral line stimuli that are weakly dependent on the fish's speed, and may be an order of magnitude stronger than the correspondent stimuli induced by the fish's gliding body. We illustrate that A. fasciatus can navigate non-visually using a combination of two deeply ancestral and highly conserved mechanisms of ray-finned fishes: the mechanism of sensing water motion by the lateral line system and the mechanism of generating water motion by mouth suction.",2014,10.1242/jeb.098384,217,11,1955-1962,NA,Canal neuromasts; Distant touch; Navigation

Reproductive female midshipman underwent either surgical deflation of the swim bladder or cryoablation of the lateral line and were then tested in a monopolar sound source localization task. Fish with nominally `deflated' swim bladders performed similar to sham-deflated controls; however, post-experiment evaluation of swim bladder deflation revealed that a majority of `deflated' fish (88\%, seven of the eight fish) that exhibited positive phonotaxis had partially inflated swim bladders. In total, 95\% (21/22) of fish that localized the source had at least partially inflated swim bladders, indicating that pressure reception is likely required for sound source localization. In lateral line experiments, no difference was observed in the proportion of females exhibiting positive phonotaxis with ablated (37\%) versus sham-ablated (47\%) lateral line systems. These data suggest that the lateral line system is likely not required for sound source localization, although this system may be important for fine-tuning the approach to the sound source. We found that midshipman can solve the 180 deg ambiguity of source direction in the shallow water of our test tank, which is similar to their nesting environment. We also found that the potential directional cues (phase relationship between pressure and particle motion) in shallow water differs from a theoretical free-field. Therefore, the general question of how fish use acoustic pressure cues to solve the 180 deg ambiguity of source direction from the particle motion vector remains unresolved.",2014,10.1242/jeb.093831,217,12,2078-2088,NA,Hearing; Lateral line; Phonotaxis; Swim bladder
article,"Growth, filtration and respiration characteristics of small single-osculum demosponge <i>Halichondria panicea </i>explants","Riisgard, Hans Ulrik and Luskow, Florian and Larsen, Poul S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Filter -feeding demosponges are modular organisms that consist of modules each with one water -exit osculum. Once a mature module has been formed, the weight -specific filtration and respiration rates do not change. Sponge modules only grow to a certain size and for a sponge to increase in size, new modules must be formed. However, the growth characteristics of a small single-osculum module sponge are fundamentally different from those of multi -modular sponges, and a theoretically derived volume -specific filtration rate scales as F / V = V - 1/3 , indicating a decrease with increasing total module volume ( V , cm 3 ). Here, we studied filtration rate ( F , l h - 1 ), respiration rate ( R , ml O 2 h - 1 ), volume -specific ( F / V ) and weight -specific ( F / W ) filtration rates, and the ratios F / R and F / W along with growth rates of small single-osculum demosponge Halichondria panicea explants of various sizes exposed to various concentrations of algal cells. The following relationships were found: F / V =7.08 V - 0.24 , F = a 1 W 1.05 , and R = a 2 W 0.68 where W is the dry weight (mg). The F / R and F / W ratios were constant and essentially independent of W , and other data indicate exponential growth.

article,Terrestrial acclimation and exercise lead to bone functional response in <i>Polypterus senegalus</i> pectoral fins,"Du, Trina Y. and Standen, Emily M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The ability of bones to sense and respond to mechanical loading is a central feature of vertebrate skeletons. However, the functional demands imposed on terrestrial and aquatic animals differ vastly. The pectoral girdle of the basal actinopterygian fish Polypterus senegalus was previously shown to exhibit plasticity following terrestrial acclimation, but the pectoral fin itself has yet to be examined. We investigated skeletal plasticity in the pectoral fins of P. senegalus after exposure to terrestrial loading. Juvenile fish were divided into three groups: a control group was kept under aquatic conditions without intervention, an exercised group was also kept in water but received daily exercise on land, and a terrestrial group was kept in a chronic semi-terrestrial condition. After 5 weeks, the pectoral fins were cleared and stained with Alcian Blue and Alizarin Red to visualize cartilage and bone, allowing measurements of bone length, bone width, ossification and curvature to be taken for the endochondral radial bones. Polypterus senegalus fin bones responded most strongly to chronic loading in the terrestrial condition. Fish that were reared in a terrestrial environment had significantly longer bones compared with those of aquatic controls, wider propterygia and metapterygia, and more ossified metapterygia and medial radials, and they showed changes in propterygial curvature. Exercised fish also had longer and more ossified medial radials compared with those of controls. Polypterus senegalus fin bones exhibit plasticity in response to novel terrestrial loading. Such plasticity could be relevant for transitions between water and land on evolutionary scales, but key differences between fish and tetrapod bone make direct comparisons challenging.",2020,10.1242/jeb.217554,223,11,NA,jeb217554,Amphibious fishes; Mechanical loading; Pectoral radial bones; Skeletal plasticity
article,Heart rate regulation in diving sea lions: the vagus nerve rules,"Ponganis, Paul J. and McDonald, Birgitte I. and Tift, Michael S. and Williams, Cassondra L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Recent publications have emphasized the potential generation of morbid cardiac arrhythmias secondary to autonomic conflict in diving marine mammals. Such conflict, as typified by cardiovascular responses to cold water immersion in humans, has been proposed to result from exercise-related activation of cardiac sympathetic fibers to increase heart rate, combined with depth-related changes in parasympathetic tone to decrease heart rate. After reviewing the marine mammal literature and evaluating heart rate profiles of diving California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), we present an alternative interpretation of heart rate regulation that de-emphasizes the concept of autonomic conflict and the risk of morbid arrhythmias in marine mammals. We hypothesize that: (1) both the sympathetic cardiac accelerator fibers and the peripheral sympathetic vasomotor fibers are activated during dives even without exercise, and their activities are elevated at the lowest heart rates in a dive when vasoconstriction is maximal, (2) in diving animals, parasympathetic cardiac tone via the vagus nerve dominates over sympathetic cardiac tone during all phases of the dive, thus producing the bradycardia, (3) adjustment in vagal activity, which may be affected by many inputs, including exercise, is the primary regulator of heart rate and heart rate fluctuations during diving, and (4) heart beat fluctuations (benign arrhythmias) are common in marine mammals. Consistent with the literature and with these hypotheses, we believe that the generation of morbid arrhythmias because of exercise or stress during dives is unlikely in marine mammals.",2017,10.1242/jeb.146779,220,8,1372-1381,NA,Dive; Heart rate; Parasympathetic; Sympathetic; Vagus nerve

However, the pectoral and pelvic girdle attach the limbs to the body in different ways and may exhibit dissimilar functions, especially during locomotion in disparate environments. Here, we tested for functional differences between the forelimb and hindlimb of the freshwater turtle Pseudemys concinna during walking and swimming using X-ray reconstruction of moving morphology (XROMM). In doing so, we also tested the commonly held notion that the shell constrains girdle motion in turtles. We found that the pectoral girdle exhibited greater rotations than the pelvic girdle on land and in water. Additionally, pelvic girdle rotations were greater on land than in water, whereas pectoral girdle rotations were similar in the two environments. These results indicate that although the magnitude of pelvic girdle rotations depends primarily on whether the weight of the body must be supported against gravity, the magnitude of pectoral girdle rotations likely depends primarily on muscular activity associated with locomotion. Furthermore, the pectoral girdle of turtles rotated more than has been observed in other taxa with sprawling postures, showing an excursion similar to that of mammals (similar to 38 deg). These results suggest that a rigid axial skeleton and internally positioned pectoral girdle have not constrained turtle girdle function, but rather the lack of lateral undulations in turtles and mammals may contribute to a functional convergence whereby the girdle acts as an additional limb segment to increase stride length.",2019,10.1242/jeb.212688,222,24,NA,jeb212688,Biomechanics; Morphology; Locomotion; X-ray reconstruction of moving morphology
article,Calcium uptake in aquatic insects: influences of phylogeny and metals (Cd and Zn),"Poteat, Monica D. and Buchwalter, David B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Calcium sequestration in the hypo-osmotic freshwater environment is imperative in maintaining calcium homeostasis in freshwater aquatic organisms. This uptake process is reported to have the unintended consequence of potentially toxic heavy metal (Cd, Zn) uptake in a variety of aquatic species. However, calcium uptake remains poorly understood in aquatic insects, the dominant invertebrate faunal group in most freshwater ecosystems. Here, we examined Ca uptake and interactions with heavy metals (Cd, Zn) at low ambient Ca levels (12.5 mu mol l(-1)) in 12 aquatic insect species within Ephemerellidae (mayfly) and Hydropsychidae (caddisfly), two families differentially responsive to trace metal pollution. We found Ca uptake varied 70-fold across the 12 species studied. Body mass and clade (family) were found to significantly influence both Ca uptake and adsorption (P <= 0.05). Zn and Cd uptake rate constants (k(u)) exhibited a strong correlation (r=0.96, P < 0.0001), suggesting a shared transport system. Ca uptake failed to significantly correlate with either Zn or Cd ku values. Further, neither Zn nor Cd exhibited inhibitory effects toward Ca uptake. In fact, we saw evidence of modest stimulation of Ca uptake rates in some metal treatments. This work suggests that insects generally differ from other freshwater taxa in that aqueous Ca uptake does not appear to be compromised by Cd or Zn exposure. It is important to understand the trace metal and major ion physiology of aquatic insects because of their ecological importance and widespread use as ecological indicators.",2014,10.1242/jeb.097261,217,7,1180-1186,NA,Calcium; Metals; Ion transport; Freshwater taxa

The elemental composition of otoliths represents a permanent record of the growing habitats experienced by a fish throughout its lifetime and is increasingly used in the literature. The lack of a predictive and mechanistic understanding of the individual kinematics underlying ion incorporation/depletion limits our fine-scale temporal interpretation of the chemical signal recorded in the otolith. In particular, the rate at which elements are incorporated into otoliths is hypothesized to depend on fish physiology. However, to date, time lags have mostly been quantified on a population scale. Here, we report results from controlled experiments (translocation and artificially enriched environment) on individual trace element incorporation/depletion rates in Salmo trutta (Salmonidae). We reported significant lags (i.e. weeks to months) between changes in water chemistry and the subsequent change in otolith composition and highlighted substantial inter-individual variations in the timing and magnitude of Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca responses. These differences are partially linked to the energetic status (i.e. metabolic rate) of the individuals. It therefore appears that individuals with the highest metabolic rate are more likely to record detailed (i.e. brief) temporal changes than individuals having lower metabolic values. The time taken for environmental changes to be reflected in the growing otolith thus can no longer be assumed to remain a constant within populations. Results from the current study are a step towards the fine reconstruction of environmental histories in dynamic environments.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245265,226,13,NA,jeb245265,Otolith chemistry; LA-ICP-MS; Inter-individual variation; Strontium; Barium; Movement patterns
article,"Amphibious hearing in a diving bird, the great cormorant (<i>Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis</i>)","Larsen, Ole Naesbye and Wahlberg, Magnus and Christensen-Dalsgaard, Jakob",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Diving birds can spend several minutes underwater during pursuit-dive foraging. To find and capture prey, such as fish and squid, they probably need several senses in addition to vision. Cormorants, very efficient predators of fish, have unexpectedly low visual acuity underwater. So, underwater hearing may be an important sense, as for other diving animals. We measured auditory thresholds and eardrum vibrations in air and underwater of the great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis). Wild-caught cormorant fledglings were anaesthetized, and their auditory brainstem response (ABR) and eardrum vibrations to clicks and tone burstsweremeasured, first in an anechoic box in air and then in a large water-filled tank, with their head and ears submerged 10 cm below the surface. Both theABRwaveshape and latency, aswell as the ABR threshold, measured in units of sound pressure, were similar in air and water. The best average sound pressure sensitivity was found at 1 kHz, both in air (53 dB re. 20 mu Pa) and underwater (58 dB re. 20 mu Pa). When thresholds were compared in units of intensity, however, the sensitivity underwater was higher than in air. Eardrum vibration amplitude in bothmedia reflected the ABR threshold curves. These results suggest that cormorants have in-air hearing abilities comparable to those of similar-sized diving birds, and that their underwater hearing sensitivity is at least as good as their aerial sensitivity. This, together with the morphology of the outer ear (collapsible meatus) and middle ear (thickened eardrum), suggests that cormorants may have anatomical and physiological adaptations for amphibious hearing.",2020,10.1242/jeb.217265,223,6,NA,jeb217265,Auditory brainstem response; Audiogram; Auditory adaptation; Auditory threshold curves; Bioacoustics; Underwater hearing

Pressure detection results from interactions between the swim bladder and otoliths. In larval fishes, those interactions change rapidly as growth and development alter bladder dimensions and otolith-bladder distance. We used computed tomography imagery of lab-reared larval red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) in a finite-element model to assess ontogenetic changes in acoustic pressure sensitivity in response to a plane wave at frequencies within the frequency range of hearing by fishes. We compared the acceleration at points on the sagitta, asteriscus and lapillus when the bladder was air filled with results from models using a water-filled bladder. For larvae of 8.5 - 18 mm in standard length, the air-filled bladder amplified simulated otolith motion by a factor of 54-3485 times that of a water-filled bladder at 100 Hz. Otolith-bladder distance increased with standard length, which decreased modeled amplification. The concomitant rapid increase in bladder volume partially compensated for the effect of increasing otolith-bladder distance. Calculated resonant frequency of the bladders was between 8750 and 4250 Hz, and resonant frequency decreased with increasing bladdervolume. There was a relatively flat frequency dependence of these effects in the audible frequency range, but we found a small increase in amplification with increasing excitation frequency. Using idealized geometry, we found that the larval vertebrae and ribs have negligible influence on bladder motion. Our results help clarify the auditory consequences of ontogenetic changes in bladder morphology and otolith-bladder relationships during larval stages.",2019,10.1242/jeb.201962,222,16,NA,jeb201962,Fish; Larvae; Ontogeny; Hearing; Otoliths; Modeling; Computed tomography

Here, we studied flea (Oropsylla idahoensis and Oropsylla opisocroistis tuberculata) parasitism on a natural population of Columbian ground squirrels (Urocitellus columbianus) in Sheep River Provincial Park, AB, Canada. Fleas were experimentally added to adult female U. columbianus at physiologically demanding times, including birth, lactation and weaning of their young. The body mass of adult females, as well as their oxidative stress and immunity were recorded multiple times over the active season under flea-augmented and control conditions. We also measured the prevalence of an internal parasite (Trypanosoma otospermophili). Doubly labeled water (DLW) was intra-peritoneally injected at peak lactation to examine energy expenditure. Effects of parasites on oxidative stress were only observed after offspring were weaned. There was no direct effect of experimentally heightened flea prevalence on energy use. A short-term 24 h mass loss (-17 g) was detected briefly after parasite addition, likely due to U. columbianus preferentially allocating time for grooming. Our parasite augmentation did not strongly affect hosts and suggested that short-term physiological effects were unlikely to culminate in long-term fitness consequences.

article,Archerfish coordinate fin maneuvers with their shots,"Gerullis, Peggy and Reinel, Caroline P. and Schuster, Stefan",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Archerfish down a variety of aerial prey from a range of distances using water jets that they adjust to the size and distance of their prey. We describe here that characteristic rapid fin maneuvers, most notably of the pectoral and pelvic fins, are precisely coordinated with the release of the jet. We discovered these maneuvers in two fish, the jets of which had been characterized in detail, that had been trained to shoot from fixed positions at targets at different heights and that remained stable during their shots. Based on the findings in these individuals, we examined shooting-associated fin movement in 28 further archerfish of two species that could shoot from freely chosen positions at targets at different heights. Slightly before the onset of the water jet, at a time when the shooter remains stable, the pectoral fins of all shooters switched from asynchronous low-amplitude beating to a synchronized rapid forward flap. The onset and duration of the forward and subsequent backward flap were robust across all individuals and shooting angles but depended on target height. The pelvic fins were slowly adducted at the start of the jet and stopped moving after its release. All other fins also showed a characteristic sequence of activation, some starting similar to 0.5 s before the shot. Our findings suggest that shooting-related fin maneuvers are needed to stabilize the shooter, and that these maneuvers are an important component in the precise and powerful far-distance shooting in archerfish.",2021,10.1242/jeb.233718,224,8,NA,jeb233718,Motor control; Fins; Stability; Temporal precision; Neuroethology

Identification and comparative morphology,"Machnik, Peter and Leupolz, Kathrin and Feyl, Sabine and Schulze, Wolfram and Schuster, Stefan",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Archerfish use two powerful C-starts: one to escape threats, the other to secure prey that they have downed with a shot of water. The two C-starts are kinematically equivalent and variable in both phases, and the predictive C-starts - used in hunting - are adjusted in terms of the angle of turning and the final linear speed to where and when their prey will hit the water surface. Presently, nothing is known about the neural circuits that drive the archerfish C-starts. As the starting point for a neuroethological analysis, we first explored the presence and morphology of a pair of Mauthner cells, which are key cells in the teleost fast-start system. We show that archerfish have a typical Mauthner cell in each medullary hemisphere and that these send by far the largest axons down the spinal cord. Stimulation of the spinal cord caused short-latency all-or-none field potentials that could be detected even at the surface of the medulla and that had the Mauthner cell as its only source. The archerflsh's Mauthner cell is remarkably similar morphologically to that of equally sized goldfish, except that the archerfish's ventral dendrite is slightly longer and its lateral dendrite thinner. Our data provide the necessary starting point for the dissection of the archerfish fast-start system and of any role potentially played by its Mauthner cell in the two C-start manoeuvres. Moreover, they do not support the recently expressed view that Mauthner cells should be reduced in animals with highly variable fast-start manoeuvres.",2018,10.1242/jeb.182535,221,13,NA,NA,Escape response; Reticulospinal system; Speed-accuracy; Fast start; Neuroethology

As flatfish are often cryptic and do not produce noise, we hypothesized that harbour seals are able to detect and localize flatfish using their hydrodynamic sensory system (vibrissae), as fish emit water currents through their gill openings (breathing currents). To test this hypothesis, we created an experimental platform where an artificial breathing current was emitted through one of eight different openings. Three seals were trained to search for the active opening and station there for 5 s. Half of the trials were conducted with the seal blindfolded with an eye mask. In blindfolded and non-blindfolded trials, all seals performed significantly better than chance. The seals crossed the artificial breathing current (being emitted into the water column at an angle of 45 deg to the ground) from different directions. There was no difference in performance when the seals approached from in front, from behind or from the side. All seals responded to the artificial breathing currents by directly moving their snout towards the opening from which the hydrodynamic stimulus was emitted. Thus, they were also able to extract directional information from the hydrodynamic stimulus. Hydrodynamic background noise and the swimming speed of the seals were also considered in this study as these are aggravating factors that seals in the wild have to face during foraging. By creating near-natural conditions, we show that harbour seals have the ability to detect a so-far overlooked type of stimulus.",2017,10.1242/jeb.148676,220,2,174-185,NA,Vibrissae; Pinniped; Benthic prey; Foraging; Hydrodynamic sensory system
article,"Interactions between corticosterone phenotype, environmental stressor pervasiveness and irruptive movement-related survival in the cane toad","Jessop, Tim S. and Webb, Jonathan and Dempster, Tim and Feit, Benjamin and Letnic, Mike",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Animals use irruptive movement to avoid exposure to stochastic and pervasive environmental stressors that impact fitness. Beneficial irruptive movements transfer individuals from high-stress areas (conferring low fitness) to alternative localities that may improve survival or reproduction. However, being stochastic, environmental stressors can limit an animal's preparatory capacity to enhance irruptive movement performance. Thus individuals must rely on pre-existing, or rapidly induced, physiological and behavioural responses. Rapid elevation of glucocorticoid hormones in response to environmental stressors are widely implicated in adjusting physiological and behaviour processes that could influence irruptive movement capacity. However, there remains little direct evidence demonstrating that corticosterone-regulated movement performance or interaction with pervasiveness of environmental stress, confers adaptive movement outcomes. Here, we compared how movement-related survival of cane toads (Rhinella marina) varied with three different experimental corticosterone phenotypes across four increments of increasing environmental stressor pervasiveness (i.e. distance from water in a semi-arid landscape). Our results indicated that toads with phenotypically increased corticosterone levels attained higher movement-related survival compared with individuals with control or lowered corticosterone phenotypes. However, the effects of corticosterone phenotypes on movement-related survival to some extent co-varied with stressor pervasiveness. Thus, our study demonstrates how the interplay between an individual's corticosterone phenotype and movement capacity alongside the arising costs of movement and the pervasiveness of the environmental stressor can affect survival outcomes.",2018,10.1242/jeb.187930,221,24,NA,jeb187930,Phenotypic engineering; Glucocorticoids; Movement behaviour; Fitness; Stressor magnitude

In the present study, common carp (Cyprinus carpio) acquired from the wild were held live in an aquatic laboratory at 10 degrees C and 20 degrees C. Ontogenetic scales were extracted from the fish for analysis, as well as regenerated scales after approximately 1 year of development and growth.

The strength, strain to fracture and toughness of the regenerated scales were significantly lower than those of ontogenetic scales from the same fish, regardless of the water temperature. Scales that regenerated at 20 degrees C exhibited significantly higher strength, strain to fracture and toughness than those regenerated at 10 degrees C. The regenerated scales exhibited a highly mineralized outer layer, but no distinct limiting layer or external elasmodine; they also possessed a significantly lower number of plies in the basal layer than the ontogenetic scales.

E. and Prokopchuk, Galina and Kaspar, Vojtech and Cosson, Jacky and Pitcher, Trevor E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs) are prevalent in nature, where smaller parasitic males typically have better sperm quality than larger territorial guard males. At present, it is unclear what is causing this phenomenon. Our objective was to gain insights into sperm form and function by examining flagellar beating patterns (beat frequency, wave amplitude, bend length, bend angle, wave velocity) and biomechanical sperm metrics (velocity, hydrodynamic power output, propulsive efficiency) of wild spawning Chinook salmon ARTs. Ovarian fluid and milt were collected to form a series of eight experimental blocks, each composed of ovarian fluid from a unique female and sperm from a unique pair of parasitic jack and guard hooknose males. Sperm from each ART were activated in river water and ovarian fluid. Flagellar parameters were evaluated from recordings using high-speed video microscopy and biomechanical metrics were quantified. We show that ART has an impact on flagellar beating, where jacks had a higher bend length and bend angle than hooknoses. Activation media also impacted the pattern of flagellar parameters, such that beat frequency, wave velocity and bend angle declined, while wave amplitude of flagella increased when ovarian fluid was incorporated into activation media. Furthermore, we found that sperm from jacks swam faster than those from hooknoses and required less hydrodynamic power output to propel themselves in river water and ovarian fluid. Jack sperm were also more efficient at swimming than hooknose sperm, and propulsive efficiency increased when cells were activated in ovarian fluid. The results demonstrate that sperm biomechanics may be driving divergence in competitive reproductive success between ARTs.",2017,10.1242/jeb.154195,220,12,2210-2217,NA,Salmon; Oncorhynchus tshawytscha; Spawning; Reproductive strategy; Sperm competition; Cryptic female choice

The synthesis and release of a releaser/primer pheromone 3-keto petromyzonol sulfate (3kPZS) by spermiating males have been well characterized. 3kPZS evokes sexual behaviors in ovulatory females, induces immediate 3kPZS release in spermiating males, and elicits neuroendocrine responses in prespawning adults. Another primer pheromone released by spermiating males, 3-keto allocholic acid (3kACA), antagonizes the neuroendocrine effects of 3kPZS in prespermiating males. However, the effects of 3kACA and 3kPZS on pheromone production in prespawning adults is unclear. To understand the foundation of pheromone production, we examined sea lamprey bile salt levels at different life stages. To investigate the priming effects of 3kACA and 3kPZS, we exposed prespawning adults to vehicle or synthetic 3kACA or 3kPZS. We hypothesized that endogenous bile salt levels are life-stage and sex dependent, and differentially affected by 3kACA and 3kPZS in prespawning adults. Using ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we found that sea lampreys have distinct mixtures of bile salts in the liver and plasma at different life stages. Males usually had higher amounts of bile salts than females. Petromyzonamine disulfate was the most abundant C-27 bile salt and petromyzonol sulfate was the most abundant C-24 bile salt.

As the tissue cholesterol concentration in Daphnia is quite low, we hypothesized the selective exclusion of cholesterol from C budgeting and tested this using radiolabelled cholesterol. Somatic growth rates of D. magna were highest at high quantity and quality and were reduced to a moderate value if either the food quantity or the cholesterol concentration was low. Growth was lowest at low food quantity and quality. The measurements of C budgets revealed high regulative response to low food quality at high food quantity only. Here, low dietary cholesterol caused bulk C assimilation efficiency (AE) to decrease and assimilated (excess) C to be increasingly respired. Additionally, Daphnia enhanced efficient adjustment of C budgets when facing cholesterol limitation by (1) increasing the AE of the cholesterol itself and (2) not changing cholesterol respiration, which was still not detectable. In contrast, at low food quantity, Daphnia is unable to adjust for low food quality, emphasizing that food limitation could overrule food quality effects.",2014,10.1242/jeb.094151,217,7,1079-1086,NA,Biochemical limitation; Carbon budgets; Zooplankton; Carbon pathway; Food quality; Food quantity

We present here a well-established underwater EAG method to record the global antennule activity in the marine shrimp Palaemon elegans in natural (aqueous) conditions. EAG responses to food extracts, recorded as net positive deviations of the baseline, are reproducible, dose-dependent and exhibit sensory adaptation.

article,Kinematics of mouthbrooding in <i>Oreochromis niloticus</i> (Cichlidae),"Van Wassenbergh, Sam and Joris, Iris and Descle'e, Mathieu and Liew, Hon Jung and De Boeck, Gudrun and Adriaens, Dominique and Aerts, Peter",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Many species from several different families of fishes perform mouthbrooding, where one of the sexes protects and ventilates the eggs inside the mouth cavity. This ventilation behaviour differs from gill ventilation outside the brooding period, as the normal, small-amplitude suction-pump respiration cycles are alternated with actions including near-simultaneous closed-mouth protrusions and high-amplitude depressions of the hyoid. The latter is called churning, referring to its hypothetical function in moving around and repositioning the eggs by a presumed hydrodynamic effect of the marked shifts in volume along the mouth cavity. We tested the hypothesis that churning causes the eggs located posteriorly in the mouth cavity to move anteriorly away from the gill entrance. This would prevent or clear accumulations of brood at the branchial basket, which would otherwise hinder breathing by the parent. Dual-view videos of female Nile tilapias (Oreochromis niloticus) during mouthbrooding showed that churning involves a posterior-to-anterior wave of expansion and compression of the head volume. Flow visualisation with polyethylene microspheres revealed a significant inflow of water entering the gill slits at the zone above the pectoral fin base, followed by a predominantly ventral outflow passing the ventrolaterally flapping branchiostegal membranes. X-ray videos indicated that particularly the brood located close to the gills is moved anteriorly during churning. These data suggest that, in addition to mixing of the brood to aid its oxygenation, an important function of the anterior flow through the gills and buccal cavity during churning is to prevent clogging of the eggs near the gills.",2016,10.1242/jeb.131631,219,10,1535-1541,NA,Cichlids; Tilapia; Ventilation; Opercula; Jaw protrusion; Churning; Hydrodynamics; Biomechanics
article,Consequences of calcium decline on the embryogenesis and life history of <i>Daphnia magna</i>,"Giardini, Jamie-Lee and Yan, Norman D. and Heyland, Andreas",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Ambient calcium is declining in thousands of soft-water lake habitats in temperate regions as a consequence of unsustainable forestry practices, decreased atmospheric calcium deposition and acidic deposition. As their exoskeleton is heavily reinforced with calcium, freshwater crustaceans have a high specific calcium requirement relative to other aquatic organisms. Daphnia, in particular, is an ideal crustacean for investigating the consequences of calcium decline because it is an abundant and important member of freshwater zooplankton communities. Although it has been established that adult and juvenile Daphnia have different tolerances to low ambient calcium as a result of their different life stage-specific calcium requirements, the consequences of declining calcium on embryonic development have never been investigated. Here, we describe the distribution of calcium in embryonic stages of D. magna and introduce a novel and easy to use staging scheme. We tested whether calcium can be traced from mothers to their offspring. Finally, we assessed the fitness consequences of maternal provisioning in limiting calcium environments. We found that while embryos require calcium for their development and moulting, they do not equilibrate with environmental calcium levels. Instead, we were able to trace calcium from mothers to their offspring. Furthermore, our data strongly suggest that females are faced with an allocation trade-off between providing calcium to their offspring and using it for growth and moulting. Together, these data provide novel insights into the consequences of calcium decline for freshwater zooplankton.",2015,10.1242/jeb.123513,218,13,2005-2014,NA,Freshwater; Crustacean; Embryonic development; Allocation trade-off; Maternal effects; Acidification; Stress

We combined estimates of energetic costs derived from breath-by-breath respirometry with measurements of overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) from biologging tags to validate ODBA as a proxy for COL in trained common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). We measured resting metabolic rate (RMR); mean individual RMR was 0.71-1.42 times that of a similarly sized terrestrial mammal and agreed with past measurements that used breath-by-breath and flow-through respirometry. We also measured energy expenditure during submerged swim trials, at primarily moderate exercise levels. We subtracted RMR to obtain COL and normalized COL by body size to incorporate individual swimming efficiencies. We found both mass-specific energy expenditure and mass-specific COL were linearly related with ODBA. Measurements of activity level and cost of transport (the energy required to move a given distance) improve understanding of the COL in marine mammals. The strength of the correlation between ODBA and COL varied among individuals, but the overall relationship can be used at a broad scale to estimate the energetic costs of disturbance and daily locomotion costs to build energy budgets, and investigate the costs of diving in free-ranging animals where bio-logging data are available.

Desert locusts, Schistocerca gregaria, detect polarized light through a specialized dorsal rim area (DRA) in their compound eye. To better understand retinal mechanisms underlying visual navigation, we compared opsin expression, spectral and polarization sensitivities and response-stimulus intensity functions in the DRA and main retina of the locust. In addition to previously characterized opsins of long-wavelength-absorbing (Lo1) and blue-absorbing visual pigments (Lo2), we identified an opsin of an ultraviolet-absorbing visual pigment (LoUV). DRA photoreceptors exclusively expressed Lo2, had peak spectral sensitivities at 441 nm and showed high polarization sensitivity (PS 1.3-31.7). In contrast, ommatidia in the main eye co-expressed Lo1 and Lo2 in five photoreceptors, expressed Lo1 in two proximal photoreceptors, and Lo2 or LoUV in one distal photoreceptor. Correspondingly, we found broadband blue-and green-peaking spectral sensitivities in the main eye and one narrowly tuned UV peaking receptor. Polarization sensitivity in the main retina was low (PS 1.3-3.8). V-log / functions in the DRA were steeper than in the main retina, supporting a role in polarization vision. Desert locusts occur as two morphs, a day-active gregarious and a night-active solitarious form. In solitarious locusts, sensitivities in the main retina were generally shifted to longer wavelengths, particularly in ventral eye regions, supporting a nocturnal lifestyle at low light levels. The data support the role of the DRA in polarization vision and suggest trichromatic colour vision in the desert locust.",2014,10.1242/jeb.108514,217,19,3557-3568,NA,Compound eye; Dorsal rim area; Opsin expression; Spectral sensitivity; Polarization sensitivity; Phase change

We investigated the mass scaling of MRs within and between species of Carabidae beetles. We used ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, phylogenetically generalized least squares (PGLS) regression and standardized major axis (SMA) regression to explore the effects of different model-fitting methods and data clustering caused by phylogenetic clades (grade shift) and gas exchange patterns (discontinuous, cyclic and continuous). At the interspecific level, the relationship betweenMRandMwas either negatively allometric (b< 1) or isometric (b= 1), depending on the fitting method. At the intraspecific level, the relationship either did not exist or was isometric or positively allometric (b> 1), and the fit was significantly improved after the analyzed dataset was split according to gas exchange patterns. The studied species originated from two distinct phylogenetic clades that had different intercepts but a common scaling exponent (OLS, 0.61) that was much shallower than the scaling exponent for the combined dataset for all species (OLS, 0.71). The best scaling exponent estimates were obtained by applying OLS while accounting for grade shifts or by applying PGLS. Overall, we show that allometry of MR in insects can depend heavily on the model fitting method, the structure of phylogenetic non-independence and ecological factors that elicit different modes of gas exchange.",2017,10.1242/jeb.159293,220,18,3363-3371,NA,Allometry; Body mass; Insects; Phylogenetically generalized least squares; Ordinary least squares; Standardized major axis
article,The metabolic cost of carrying a sexually selected trait in the male fiddler crab <i>Uca pugilator</i>,"Tullis, Alexa and Straube, Corinne H. T.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Models proposed to explain sexually selected structures assume that these traits are costly. However, studies investigating the impact of such structures on locomotory costs have produced inconsistent results. Male fiddler crabs possess a large sexually selected clawand are ideal for assessing the impact of a sexually selected trait on the cost of locomotion. Here, we measured the energy expenditure of clawed, declawed and artificially loaded crabs during sustained exercise by measuring oxygen consumption and blood lactate levels. We also measured blood lactate levels of clawed and declawed crabs following a sprint and forced walk to assess energy expenditure during non-sustainable, strenuous locomotion. Clawed and declawed crabs consumed the same amount of oxygen and had the same blood lactate concentration during sustained locomotion, suggesting that the large claw does not increase energetic costs during sustainable locomotion. Following non-sustainable, strenuous locomotion, however, there was a trend for clawed crabs to have higher concentrations of lactate in their blood than declawed crabs, suggesting that bearing a large claw may increase energetic costs during strenuous locomotion and lengthen recovery time. Artificially loaded crabs produced more lactic acid than clawed and declawed crabs during sustainable locomotion, suggesting that compensatory traits help mitigate the energetic cost of carrying the large claw. Overall, our results show that the impact of exaggerated structures on energy expenditure may depend on exercise intensity and highlight the need to examine various locomotory intensities when attempting to assess the costs of bearing a sexually selected trait.",2017,10.1242/jeb.163816,220,20,3641-3648,NA,Energetic cost; Lactic acid; Locomotion; Oxygen consumption; Sexual selection; Fiddler crab
article,Complementary roles of photoperiod and temperature in environmental sex determination in <i>Daphnia</i> spp.,"Camp, Allison A. and Haeba, Maher H. and LeBlanc, Gerald A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Daphnia spp., a keystone genus in freshwater lentic habitats, are subject to environmental sex determination wherein environmental conditions dictate offspring sex and whether they reproduce asexually or sexually. The introduction of males into a population denotes the first step in the switch from asexual parthenogenetic reproduction to sexual reproduction. We tested the hypothesis that photoperiod and temperature co-regulate male sex determination and that these environmental stimuli would activate elements of the male sex determination signaling cascade. The results revealed that photoperiod was a critical cue in creating permissive conditions for male production. Further, under photoperiod-induced permissive conditions, male sex determination was temperature dependent. The two daphnid species evaluated, Daphnia pulex and Daphnia magna, exhibited different temperature dependencies. Daphnia pulex produced fewer males with increasing temperatures between 16 and 22 degrees C, and D. magna exhibited the opposite trend. We found consistent expression patterns of key genes along the male sex-determining signaling pathway in D. pulex independent of environmental stimuli. mRNA levels for the enzyme responsible for synthesis of the male sex-determining hormone, methyl famesoate, were elevated early in the reproductive cycle, followed by increased mRNA levels of the methyl farnesoate receptor subunits Met and SRC. Environmental conditions that stimulated male offspring production significantly increased Met mRNA levels. The results indicate that male sex determination in daphnids is under the permissive control of photoperiod and the regulatory control of temperature. Further, these environmental cues may stimulate male sex determination by increasing levels of the Met subunit of the methyl famesoate receptor.",2019,10.1242/jeb.195289,222,4,NA,jeb195289,Zooplankton; Endocrine cascade; Methyl farnesoate receptor; Juvenoids; Methyl farnesoate
article,Ontogeny can provide insight into the roles of natural and sexual selection in cricket cuticular hydrocarbon evolution,"Simmons, Leigh W. and Lovegrove, Maxine and Du, Xin Bob and Ren, Yonglin and Thomas, Melissa L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The often complex cocktails of hydrocarbon compounds found on the cuticles of insects can serve both naturally and sexually selected functions, contributing to an individual's ability to withstand water loss and attract mating partners. However, whether natural and sexual selection act synergistically or antagonistically on a species' cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profile remains unclear. Here, we examined the ontogeny of the CHC profile in a species of cricket, Teleogryllus oceanicus, while manipulating humidity during development. We predicted that juvenile crickets should produce only those compounds that contribute to desiccation resistance, while those compounds contributing specifically to male attractiveness should be produced only at sexual maturity. Further, if attractive CHCs come at a cost to desiccation resistance as predicted by some models of sexual selection, then males reared under low humidity should be constrained to invest less in attractive CHCs. Crickets reared under low humidity produced more long-chain methyl-branched alkanes, alkenes and alkadienes than did crickets reared under high humidity. The abundance of n-alkanes was unaffected by humidity treatment. Sexual dimorphism in the CHC profile was not apparent until adult emergence and became exaggerated 10 days after emergence, when crickets were sexually mature. Males produced more of the same compounds that were increased in both sexes under low humidity, but the humidity treatment did not interact with sex in determining CHC abundance. The data suggest that CHC profiles which protect crickets from desiccation might have synergistic effects on male attractiveness, as there was no evidence to suggest males trade-off a CHC profile produced in response to low humidity for one associated with sexual signalling.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244375,225,15,NA,jeb244375,Sexual signalling; Waterproofing; Trade-off; Insect; Mate choice; Desiccation resistance; Chemical signal; Magic trait
article,Identification of the role of Rh protein in ammonia excretion of the swimming crab <i>Portunus trituberculatus</i>,"Si, Lingjun and Pan, Luqing and Wang, Hongdan and Zhang, Xin",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In Portunus trituberculatus, a full-length cDNA of Rhesus-like glycoprotein (Rh protein), encoding the entire 478 amino acid protein, has been identified in gills, and plays an essential role in ammonia (NH3/NH4+) excretion. Phylogenetic analysis of Rh-like proteins from crabs was clustered, showing high conservation of the ammonium transporter domain and transmembrane segments essential to the function of Rh protein. Rh protein of P. trituberculatus (PtRh) was detected in all tested tissues, and showed the highest expression in the gills. To further characterize the role of PtRh in ammonia metabolism and excretion, double-stranded RNA-mediated RNA interference of PtRh was employed. Knockdown of PtRh upregulated mRNA expression of ammonia excretion-related genes encoding aquaporin (AQP), K+ channels and vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP), increased the activity of Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) and V-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), and initially reduced then elevated the expression of the Na+/H+-exchanger (NHE). dsRNA-mediated reduction in PtRh significantly reduced ammonia excretion rate and increased ammonia and glutamine (Gln) levels in the hemolymph, together with an increase of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and glutamine synthetase (GS) activity, indicating a central role for PtRh in ammonia excretion and detoxification mechanisms. Taken together, we conclude that Rh protein is a primary contributor to ammonia excretion of P. trituberculatus, which may be the basis of their ability to inhabit benthic water with high ammonia levels.",2018,10.1242/jeb.184655,221,20,NA,jeb184655,Rhesus-like protein; Ammonia excretion; Detoxification; dsRNA; Portunus trituberculatus

Maternal effects substantially influence offspring survival and fitness. However, investigation of the paternal contribution to offspring success has been somewhat neglected. In the present study, adult zebrafish were separated into female and male groups exposed for 21 days to either a control diet or to a diet containing water accommodated fractions of crude oil. Four F-1 offspring groups were obtained: (1) control (non-exposed parents), (2) paternally exposed, (3) maternally exposed and (4) dual-parent-exposed. To determine the maternal and paternal influence on their offspring, we evaluated responses from molecular to whole organismal levels in both generations. Growth rate, hypoxia resistance and heart rate did not differ among parental groups. However, global DNA methylation in heart tissue was decreased in oil-exposed fish compared with control parents. This decrease was accompanied by an upregulation of glycine N-methyltransferase. Unexpectedly, maternal, paternal and dual exposure all enhanced survival of F-1 offspring raised in oiled conditions. Regardless of parental exposure, however, F-1 offspring exposed to oil exhibited bradycardia. Compared with offspring from control parents, global DNA methylation was decreased in the three offspring groups derived from oil-exposed parents. However, no difference between groups was observed in gene regulation involved in methylation transfer, suggesting that the changes observed in the F-1 populations may have been inherited from both parental lines. Phenotypic responses during exposure to persistent environmental stressors in F-1 offspring appear to be influenced by maternal and paternal exposure, potentially benefitting offspring populations to survive in challenging environments.",2020,10.1242/jeb.222224,223,16,NA,jeb222224,Transgenerational inheritance; Global DNA methylation; Zebrafish larvae; Maternal effects; Paternal effects
article,The role of intestinal bacteria in the ammonia detoxification ability of teleost fish,"Turner, Leah A. and Bucking, Carol",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Protein catabolism during digestion generates appreciable levels of ammonia in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) lumen. Amelioration by the enterocyte, via enzymes such as glutamine synthetase (GS), glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), and alanine and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT; AST), is found in teleost fish. Conservation of these enzymes across bacterial phyla suggests that the GIT microbiome could also contribute to ammonia detoxification by providing supplemental activity. Hence, the GIT microbiome, enzyme activities and ammonia detoxification were investigated in two fish occupying dissimilar niches: the carnivorous rainbow darter and the algivorous central stoneroller. There was a strong effect of fish species on the activity levels of GS, GDH, AST and ALT, as well as GIT lumen ammonia concentration, and bacterial composition of the GIT microbiome. Furthermore, removal of the intestinal bacteria impacted intestinal activities of GS and ALT in the herbivorous fish but not in the carnivore. The repeatability and robustness of this relationship was tested across field locations and years. Within an individual waterbody, there was no impact of sampling location on any of these factors. However, different waterbodies affected enzyme activities and luminal ammonia concentrations in both fish, while only the central stoneroller intestinal bacteria populations varied. Overall, a relationship between GIT bacteria, enzyme activity and ammonia detoxification was observed in herbivorous fish while the carnivorous fish displayed a correlation between enzyme activity and ammonia detoxification alone that was independent of the GIT microbiome. This could suggest that carnivorous fish are less dependent on non-host mechanisms for ammonia regulation in the GIT.",2019,10.1242/jeb.209882,222,24,NA,jeb209882,Etheostoma caeruleum; Campostoma anomalum; Microbiome; Intestinal tract; Ammonia detoxification
article,Learning context modulates aversive taste strength in honey bees,"de Brito Sanchez, Maria Gabriela and Serre, Marion and Avargues-Weber, Aurore and Dyer, Adrian G. and Giurfa, Martin",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The capacity of honey bees (Apis mellifera) to detect bitter substances is controversial because they ingest without reluctance different kinds of bitter solutions in the laboratory, whereas free-flying bees avoid them in visual discrimination tasks. Here, we asked whether the gustatory perception of bees changes with the behavioral context so that tastes that are less effective as negative reinforcements in a given context become more effective in a different context. We trained bees to discriminate an odorant paired with 1 mol l(-1) sucrose solution from another odorant paired with either distilled water, 3 mol l(-1) NaCl or 60 mmol l(-1) quinine. Training was either Pavlovian {[}olfactory conditioning of the proboscis extension reflex (PER) in harnessed bees], or mainly operant (olfactory conditioning of free-walking bees in a Y-maze). PER-trained and maze-trained bees were subsequently tested both in their original context and in the alternative context. Whereas PER-trained bees transferred their choice to the Y-maze situation, Y-maze-trained bees did not respond with a PER to odors when subsequently harnessed. In both conditioning protocols, NaCl and distilled water were the strongest and the weakest aversive reinforcement, respectively. A significant variation was found for quinine, which had an intermediate aversive effect in PER conditioning but a more powerful effect in the Y-maze, similar to that of NaCl. These results thus show that the aversive strength of quinine varies with the learning context, and reveal the plasticity of the bee's gustatory system. We discuss the experimental constraints of both learning contexts and focus on stress as a key modulator of taste in the honey bee. Further explorations of bee taste are proposed to understand the physiology of taste modulation in bees.",2015,10.1242/jeb.117333,218,6,949-959,NA,Gustation; Learning; Pavlovian conditioning; Operant conditioning; Negative reinforcement; Apis mellifera

K. and Glarou, Maria and Bejder, Lars",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Quantifying the energy expenditure of animals is critical to understanding the cost of anthropogenic disturbance relative to their overall energy requirements. We used novel drone focal follows (776 follows, 185 individuals) and aerial photogrammetry (5372 measurements, 791 individuals) to measure the respiration rate and body condition loss of southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) on a breeding ground in Australia. Respiration rates were converted to oxygen consumption rate and field metabolic rate (FMR) using published bioenergetic models. The intra-seasonal loss in body condition of different reproductive classes (calves, juveniles, adults, pregnant and lactating females) was converted to blubber energy loss and total energy expenditure (TEE). Using these two metrics, we tested the effects of body size, reproductive state and activity level on right whale energy expenditure. Respiration rates and mass-specific FMR decreased exponentially with an increase in body size, as expected based on allometric scaling. FMR increased curvilinearly with an increase in swim speed, probably as a result of increased drag and increased locomotion costs. Respiration rates and FMR were 44\% higher for pregnant and lactating females compared with those of adults, suggesting significant costs of fetal maintenance and milk production, respectively. The estimated FMR of adults based on their respiration rates corresponded well with the estimated TEE based on body condition loss. The rate of decline in body condition of pregnant and lactating females was considerably higher than expected based on respiration rates, which probably reflects the milk energy transfer from mothers to calves, which is not reflected in their FMR.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245137,226,13,NA,jeb245137,Aerial photogrammetry; Baleen whale; Bioenergetics; Drones; Field metabolic rate; Total energy expenditure

Less is known about the opsins Limulus photoreceptors express. We previously characterized a UV opsin (LpUVOps1) that is expressed in all three types of Limulus eyes (lateral compound eyes, median ocelli and larval eyes) and three visible light-sensitive rhabdomeric opsins (LpOps1, -2 and -5) that are expressed in Limulus lateral compound and larval eyes. Physiological studies showed that visible light-sensitive photoreceptors are also present in median ocelli, but the visible light-sensitive opsins they express were unknown. In the current study we characterize three newly identified, visible light-sensitive rhabdomeric opsins (LpOps6, -7 and -8) that are expressed in median ocelli. We show that they are ocellar specific and that all three are co-expressed in photoreceptors distinct from those expressing LpUVOps1. Our current findings show that the pattern of opsin expression in Limulus eyes is much more complex than previously thought and extend our previous observations of opsin co-expression in visible light-sensitive Limulus photoreceptors. We also characterize a Limulus peropsin/RGR (LpPerOps1). We examine the phylogenetic relationship of LpPerOps1 with other peropsins and RGRs, demonstrate that LpPerOps1 transcripts are expressed in each of the three types of Limulus eyes and show that the encoded protein is expressed in membranes of cells closely associated with photoreceptors in each eye type.

article,Habituation in <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquito larvae is context specific,"Pietrantuono, Ana Laura and Aguirre, Maria B. and Bruzzone, Octavio A. and Guerrieri, Fernando J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Mosquito larvae live in water and perform a stereotyped escape response when a moving object projects its shadow on the water surface, indicating potential risk of predation. Repeated presentations of the shadow induce a decrease in the response as a result of habituation, a form of non-associative learning defined as the progressive and reversible decrease in response to a specific reiterative innocuous stimulus. Nevertheless, habituation can be context specific, which indicates an association between the context and the stimulus. The aim of this work was to study context specificity in habituation in mosquito larvae Aedes aegypti. Larvae were individually placed in Petri dishes positioned over black, white or black-white striped cardboard as background (visual context). Larvae were presented with a shadow produced by a cardboard square (training) over the course of 15 trials. After the 15th trial, the background was changed and the stimulus was presented once again (test). To analyse habituation in different contexts, we developed a series of learning curve models. We performed a Bayesian model selection procedure using those models and the data from the experiments to find which model best described the results. The selected model was a power law learning curve with six parameters (habituation rate; context-specific asymptotic habituation response, with one parameter per context, i.e. 3 parameters in total; response increase; and autocorrelation) describing the whole experimental setup with a generalised r(2) of 0.96. According to the model, a single habituation rate would indicate that habituation was independent of the context, whilst asymptotic habituation would be context specific. If the background was changed after training, there was an increase in response in the test, evincing context specificity in habituation.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242351,224,12,NA,jeb242351,Escape response; Insects; Non-associative learning; Vision
article,Behavioural responses to infrasonic particle acceleration in cuttlefish,"Wilson, Maria and Haga, Jens Adne Rekkedal and Karlsen, Hans Erik",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Attacks by aquatic predators generate frontal water disturbances characterised by low-frequency gradients in pressure and particle motion. Low-frequency hearing is highly developed in cephalopods. Thus, we examined behavioural responses in juvenile cuttlefish to infrasonic accelerations mimicking main aspects of the hydrodynamic signals created by predators. In the experimental set-up, animals and their surrounding water moved as a unit to minimise lateral line activation and to allow examination of the contribution by the inner ear. Behavioural responses were tested in light versus darkness and after food deprivation following a `simulated' hunting opportunity. At low acceleration levels, colour change threshold at 3, 5 and 9 Hz was 0.028, 0.038 and 0.035 m s(-2), respectively. At higher stimulus levels, jet-propulsed escape responses thresholds in daylight were 0.043, 0.065 and 0.069 m s(-2) at 3, 5 and 9 Hz, respectively, and not significantly different from the corresponding darkness thresholds of 0.043, 0.071 and 0.064 m s(-2). In a simulated hunting mode, escape thresholds were significantly higher at 3 Hz (0.118 m s(-2)) but not at 9 Hz (0.134 m s(-2)). Escape responses were directional, and overall followed the direction of the initial particle acceleration, with mean escape angles from 313 to 33 deg for all three experiments. Thus, in the wild, particle acceleration might cause escape responses directed away from striking predators but towards suction-feeding predators.

The shape of a flatid was dominated by large triangular or wedge-shaped front wings, which, when folded, covered and extended above and behind the body to give a laterally compressed and possibly streamlined appearance. The body lengths of the three species of adults ranged from 7 to 9 mm and their mass from 8 to 19 mg. The propulsive hind legs were 30\% longer than the front legs but only 36-54\% of the body length. Jumps with the fastest take-off velocities of 2.8-3.2 m s(-1) had acceleration times of 1.4-1.8 ms. During such jumps, adults experienced an acceleration of 174-200 g. These jumps required an energy expenditure of 76-225 mu J, a power output of 13-60 mW and exerted a force of 9-37 mN. The required power output per mass of jumping muscle in adults ranged from 24,000 to 27,000 W kg(-1) muscle, 100 times greater than the maximum active contractile limit of normal muscle. The free-living nymphs were also proficient jumpers, reaching take-off velocities of 2.2 m s(-1). To achieve such a jumping performance requires a power amplification mechanism. The energy store for such a mechanism was identified as the internal skeleton linking a hind coxa to the articulation of a hind wing. These pleural arches fluoresced bright blue when illuminated with UV light, indicating the presence of the elastic protein resilin. The energy generated by the prolonged contractions of the trochanteral depressor muscles was stored in distortions of these structures, and the rapid elastic recoil of these muscles powered the synchronous propulsive movements of the hind legs.",2014,10.1242/jeb.105429,217,14,2590-2600,NA,Biomechanics; Kinematics; Energy storage; Resilin; Auchenorrhyncha

Still, the effect of dive depth on foraging cost remains elusive because energy expenditure is difficult to measure at fine temporal scales in wild animals. We used depth and acceleration data from eight lactating California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) to model body density and investigate the effect of dive depth and tissue density on rates of energy expenditure. We calculated body density in 5 s intervals from the rate of gliding descent. We modeled body density across depth in each dive, revealing high tissue densities and diving lung volumes (DLVs). DLV increased with dive depth in four individuals. We used the buoyancy calculated from dive-specific body-density models and drag calculated from swim speed to estimate metabolic power and cost of transport in 5 s intervals during descents and ascents. Deeper dives required greater mean power for round-trip vertical transit, especially in individuals with higher tissue density. These trends likely follow from increased mean swim speed and buoyant hinderance that increasingly outweighs buoyant aid in deeper dives. This suggests that deep diving is either a `high-cost, high-reward' strategy or an energetically expensive option to access prey when prey in shallow waters are limited, and that poor body condition may increase the energetic costs of deep diving. These results add to our mechanistic understanding of how foraging strategy and body condition affect energy expenditure in wild breath hold divers.",2023,10.1242/jeb.246059,226,14,NA,jeb246059,Body density; Otariid; Dive depth; Buoyancy; Biologging; Energy expenditure
article,Living with a leaky skin: upregulation of ion transport proteins during sloughing,"Wu, Nicholas C. and Cramp, Rebecca L. and Franklin, Craig E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Amphibian skin is a multifunctional organ providing protection from the external environment and facilitating the physiological exchange of gases, water and salts with the environment. In order to maintain these functions, the outer layer of skin is regularly replaced in a process called sloughing. During sloughing, the outermost layer of the skin is removed in its entirety, which has the potential to interfere with skin permeability and ion transport, disrupting homeostasis. In this study, we measured, in vivo, the effects of sloughing on the cutaneous efflux of ions in toads Rhinella marina kept in freshwater conditions. We also measured transepithelial potential, cutaneous resistance, active ion transport and the distribution, abundance and gene expression of the key ion transport proteins sodium-potassium ATPase (NKA) and epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) during sloughing. We hypothesised that the increase in transepithelial efflux of ions during sloughing is a consequence of increased permeability and/or a reduction in the abundance or expression of cutaneous ion transport proteins, resulting in disruption of internal ion homeostasis. There was a significant increase in sodium and chloride efflux during sloughing in R. marina. However, although in vitro skin resistance decreased after sloughing, active sodium transport increased commensurate with an increase in NKA and ENaC protein abundance in the skin. These changes in skin function associated with sloughing did not affect the maintenance of internal electrolyte homeostasis. These results suggest that during sloughing, amphibians actively maintain internal homeostasis by increasing cutaneous rates of ion uptake.",2017,10.1242/jeb.151738,220,11,2026-2035,NA,Amphibian; Homeostasis; Moulting; qPCR; Sodium transport; Western blotting

Andrew",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Exponential increases in hydrodynamic drag and physical exertion occur when swimmers move quickly through water, and underlie the preference for relatively slow routine speeds by marine mammals regardless of body size. Because of this and the need to balance limited oxygen stores when submerged, flight (escape) responses may be especially challenging for this group. To examine this, we used open-flow respirometry to measure the energetic cost of producing a swimming stroke during different levels of exercise in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). These data were then used to model the energetic cost of high-speed escape responses by other odontocetes ranging in mass from 42 to 2738 kg. The total cost per stroke during routine swimming by dolphins, 3.31 +/- 0.20 Jkg(-1) stroke(-1), was doubled during maximal aerobic performance. A comparative analysis of locomotor costs (LC; in J kg(-1) strok(e-1)), representing the cost of moving the flukes, revealed that LC during routine swimming increased with body mass (M) for odontocetes according to LC= 1.46 +/- 0.0005M; a separate relationship described LC during high-speed stroking. Using these relationships, we found that continuous stroking coupled with reduced glide time in response to oceanic noise resulted in a 30.5\% increase in metabolic rate in the beaked whale, a deep-diving odontocete considered especially sensitive to disturbance. By integrating energetics with swimming behavior and dive characteristics, this study demonstrates the physiological consequences of oceanic noise on diving mammals, and provides a powerful tool for predicting the biological significance of escape responses by cetaceans facing anthropogenic disturbances.",2017,10.1242/jeb.154245,220,6,1135-1145,NA,Beaked whale; Diving; Dolphin; Energetics; Oceanic noise; Swimming

Though most commonly studied in pelagic fishes, streamlining also occurs in fishes that occupy high-flow environments. Before the installation of dams and water diversions, bonytail (Cyprinidae, Gila elegans), a fish endemic to the Colorado River (USA), regularly experienced massive, seasonal flooding events. Individuals of G. elegans display morphological characteristics that may facilitate swimming in high-flow conditions, including a narrow caudal peduncle and a high aspect ratio caudal fin. We tested the hypothesis that these features improve sustained swimming performance in bonytail by comparing locomotor performance in G. elegans with that of the closely related roundtail chub (Gila robusta) and two non-native species, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), using a Brett-style respirometer and locomotor step-tests. Gila elegans had the lowest estimated drag coefficient and the highest sustained swimming speeds relative to the other three species. There were no detectible differences in locomotor energetics during steady swimming among the four species. When challenged by high-velocity water flows, the second native species examined in this study, G. robusta, exploited the boundary effects in the flow tank by pitching forward and bracing the pelvic and pectoral fins against the acrylic tank bottom to `hold station'. Because G. robusta can station hold to prevent being swept downstream during high flows and G. elegans can maintain swimming speeds greater than those of smallmouth bass and rainbow trout with comparable metabolic costs, we suggest that management agencies could use artificial flooding events to wash non-native competitors downstream and out of the Colorado River habitat.",2018,10.1242/jeb.158972,221,10,NA,jeb158972,Endemism; Native; Caudal peduncle; Gila robusta; Colorado River; Swimming performance
article,Mitochondrial K<sub>ATP</sub> channels stabilize intracellular Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> during hypoxia in retinal horizontal cells of goldfish (<i>Carassius auratus</i>),"Country, Michael W. and Jonz, Michael G.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Neurons of the retina require oxygen to survive. In hypoxia, neuronal ATP production is impaired, ATP-dependent ion pumping is reduced, transmembrane ion gradients are dysregulated, and intracellular Ca2+ concentration ({[}Ca2+](i)) increases enough to trigger excitotoxic cell death. Central neurons of the common goldfish (Carassius auratus) are hypoxia tolerant, but little is known about how goldfish retinas withstand hypoxia. To study the cellular mechanisms of hypoxia tolerance, we isolated retinal intemeurons (horizontal cells; HCs), and measured {[}Ca2+](i) with Fura-2. Goldfish HCs maintained {[}Ca2+](i) throughout 1 h of hypoxia, whereas {[}Ca2+](i) increased irreversibly in HCs of the hypoxia-sensitive rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) with just 20 min of hypoxia. Our results suggest mitochondria! ATP-dependent K+ channels (mK(ATP)) are necessary to stabilize {[}Ca2+](i) throughout hypoxia. In goldfish HCs, {[}Ca2+](i) increased when mK(ATP) channels were blocked with glibenclamide or 5-hydroxydecanoic acid, whereas the mK(ATP) channel agonist diazoxide prevented {[}Ca2+](i) from increasing in hypoxia in trout HCs. We found that hypoxia protects against increases in {[}Ca2+](i) in goldfish HCs via mK(ATP) channels. Glycolytic inhibition with 2-deoxyglucose increased {[}Ca2+](i), which was rescued by hypoxia in a mK(ATP) channel-dependent manner. We found no evidence of plasmalemmal KATP channels in patch-clamp experiments. Instead, we confirmed the involvement of K-ATP in mitochondria with TMRE imaging, as hypoxia rapidly (<5 min) depolarized mitochondria in a mK(ATP) channel-sensitive manner. We conclude that mK(ATP) channels initiate a neuroprotective pathway in goldfish HCs to maintain [}Ca2+](i) and avoid excitotoxicity in hypoxia.

article,Improved mitochondrial coupling as a response to high mass-specific metabolic rate in extremely small mammals,"Boel, Melanie and Romestaing, Caroline and Duchamp, Claude and Veyrunes, Frederic and Renaud, Sabrina and Roussel, Damien and Voituron, Yann",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Mass-specific metabolic rate negatively co-varies with body mass from the whole-animal to the mitochondrial levels. Mitochondria are the mainly consumers of oxygen inspired by mammals to generate ATP or compensate for energetic losses dissipated as the form of heat ( proton leak) during oxidative phosphorylation. Consequently, ATP synthesis and proton leak compete for the same electrochemical gradient. Because proton leak co-varies negatively with body mass, it is unknown whether extremely small mammals further decouple their mitochondria to maintain their body temperature or whether they implement metabolic innovations to ensure cellular homeostasis. The present study investigated the impact of body mass variation on cellular and mitochondrial functioning in small mammals, comparing two extremely small African pygmy mice (Mus mattheyi, similar to 5 g, and Mus minutoides, similar to 7 g) with the larger house mouse (Mus musculus, similar to 22 g). Oxygen consumption rates were measured from the animal to the mitochondrial levels. We also measured mitochondrial ATP synthesis in order to appreciate the mitochondrial efficiency (ATP/O). At the whole-animal scale, mass- and surface-specific metabolic rates co-varied negatively with body mass, whereas this was not necessarily the case at the cellular and mitochondrial levels. Mus mattheyi had generally the lowest cellular and mitochondrial fluxes, depending on the tissue considered (liver or skeletal muscle), as well as having more-efficient muscle mitochondria than the other two species.

article,Patterns of mitochondrial membrane remodeling parallel functional adaptations to thermal stress,"Chung, Dillon J. and Sparagna, Genevieve C. and Chicco, Adam J. and Schulte, Patricia M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The effect of temperature on mitochondrial performance is thought to be partly due to its effect on mitochondrial membranes. Numerous studies have shown that thermal acclimation and adaptation can alter the amount of inner-mitochondrial membrane (IMM), but little is known about the capacity of organisms to modulate mitochondrial membrane composition. Using northern and southern subspecies of Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) that are locally adapted to different environmental temperatures, we assessed whether thermal acclimation altered liver mitochondrial respiratory capacity or the composition and amount of IMM. We measured changes in phospholipid headgroups and headgroup-specific fatty acid (FA) remodeling, and used respirometry to assess mitochondrial respiratory capacity. Acclimation to 5 degrees C and 33 degrees C altered mitochondrial respiratory capacity in both subspecies. Northern F. heteroclitus exhibited greater mitochondrial respiratory capacity across acclimation temperatures, consistent with previously observed subspecies differences in whole-organism aerobic metabolism. Mitochondrial phospholipids were altered following thermal acclimation, and the direction of these changes was largely consistent between subspecies. These effects were primarily driven by remodeling of specific phospholipid classes and were associated with shifts in metabolic phenotypes. There were also differences in membrane composition between subspecies that were driven largely by differences in phospholipid classes. Changes in respiratory capacity between subspecies and with acclimation were largely but not completely accounted for by alterations in the amount of IMM. Taken together, these results support a role for changes in liver mitochondrial function in the ectothermic response to thermal stress during both acclimation and adaptation, and implicate lipid remodeling as a mechanism contributing to these changes.",2018,10.1242/jeb.174458,221,7,NA,jeb174458,Temperature; Acclimation; Killifish; Phospholipid; Fatty acid
article,Hormesis-like effect of mild larval crowding on thermotolerance in <i>Drosophila</i> flies,"Youn, Henry and Renault, David and Colinet, Herve",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Crowding is a complex stress that can affect organisms' physiology, especially through decreased food quality and accessibility. Here, we evaluated the effect of larval density on several biological traits of Drosophila melanogaster. An increasing gradient, from 1 to 1000 eggs per milliliter of food, was used to characterize life-history traits variations. Crowded conditions resulted in striking decreases of fresh mass (up to 6-fold) and viability, as well as delayed development. Next, we assessed heat and cold tolerance in L3 larvae reared at three selected larval densities: low (LD, 5 eggs ml(-1)), medium (MD, 60 eggs ml(-1)) and high (HD, 300 eggs ml(-1)). LT50 values of MD and, to a lesser extent, HD larvae were repeatedly higher than those from LD larvae, under both heat and cold stress. We investigated potential physiological correlates associated with this density-dependent thermotolerance shift. No marked pattern could be drawn from the expression of stress-related genes. However, a metabolomic analysis differentiated the metabotypes of the three density levels, with potential candidates associated with this clustering (e.g. glucose 6-phosphate, GABA, sugars and polyols). Under HD, signs of oxidative stress were noted but not confirmed at the transcriptional level. Finally, urea, a common metabolic waste, was found to accumulate substantially in food from MD and HD larvae. When supplemented in food, urea stimulated cold tolerance but reduced heat tolerance in LD larvae. This study highlights that larval crowding is an important environmental parameter that induces drastic consequences on flies' physiology and can affect thermotolerance in a density-specific way.",2018,10.1242/jeb.169342,221,2,NA,jeb169342,Cold stress; Heat stress; Larval density; Metabolic response; Stress response; Urea

Long-term exposure to low temperatures, commonly referred to as chilling, can lead to physiological effects collectively known as chill injury. Periodically increasing temperatures during long-term chilling has been shown to increase survival in many insects. However, the transcripts responsible for this increase in survival have never been characterized. Here, we present the first transcriptome-level analysis of increased longevity under fluctuating temperatures during chilling. Overwintering post-diapause quiescent alfalfa leafcutting bees (Megachile rotundata) were exposed to a constant temperature of 6 degrees C, or 6 degrees C with a daily fluctuation to 20 degrees C. RNA was collected at two different time points, before and after mortality rates began to diverge between temperature treatments. Expression analysis identified differentially regulated transcripts between pairwise comparisons of both treatments and time points. Transcripts functioning in ion homeostasis, metabolic pathways and oxidative stress response were up-regulated in individuals exposed to periodic temperature fluctuations during chilling. The differential expression of these transcripts provides support for the hypotheses that fluctuating temperatures protect against chill injury by reducing oxidative stress and returning ion concentrations and metabolic function to more favorable levels. Additionally, exposure to fluctuating temperatures leads to increased expression of transcripts functioning in the immune response and neurogenesis, providing evidence for additional mechanisms associated with increased survival during chilling in M. rotundata.",2015,10.1242/jeb.113829,218,7,1060-1068,NA,Chill injury; Fluctuating thermal regime; Megachile rotundata; RNA-seq; Temperature stress
article,Thermoregulatory strategy may shape immune investment in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>,"Kutch, Ian C. and Sevgili, Hasan and Wittman, Tyler and Fedorka, Kenneth M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"As temperatures change, insects alter the amount of melanin in their cuticle to improve thermoregulation. However, melanin is also central to insect immunity, suggesting that thermoregulatory strategy may indirectly impact immune defense by altering the abundance of melanin pathway components (a hypothesis we refer to as thermoregulatory-dependent immune investment). This may be the case in the cricket Allonemobius socius, where warm environments (both seasonal and geographical) produced crickets with lighter cuticles and increased pathogen susceptibility. Unfortunately, the potential for thermoregulatory strategy to influence insect immunity has not been widely explored. Here we address the relationships between temperature, thermoregulatory strategy and immunity in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. To this end, flies from two separate Canadian populations were reared in either a summer-or autumn-like environment. Shortly after adult eclosion, flies were moved to a common environment where their cuticle color and susceptibility to a bacterial pathogen (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were measured. As with A. socius, individuals from summer-like environments exhibited lighter cuticles and increased pathogen susceptibility, suggesting that the thermoregulatory-immunity relationship is evolutionarily conserved across the hemimetabolous and holometabolous clades. If global temperatures continue to rise as expected, then thermoregulation might play an important role in host infection and mortality rates in systems that provide critical ecosystem services (e.g. pollination), or influence the prevalence of insect-vectored disease (e.g. malaria).",2014,10.1242/jeb.106294,217,20,3664-3669,NA,Thermoregulatory-dependent immune investment; Temperature; Ecoimmunology; Phenoloxidase; Seasonality; Plasticity
article,Oxygen diffusion limitation triggers ventilatory movements during spiracle closure when insects breathe discontinuously,"Huang, Shu-Ping and Sender, Roi and Gefen, Eran",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"During discontinuous gas exchange cycles in insects, spiracular opening follows a typical prolonged period of spiracle closure. Gas exchange with the environment occurs mostly during the period of full spiracular opening. In this study we tested the hypothesis that recently reported ventilatory movements during the spiracle closure period serve to mix the tracheal system gaseous contents, and support diffusive exchanges with the tissues. Using heliox (21\% O-2, 79\% He), we found that by increasing oxygen diffusivity in the gas phase, ventilatory movements of Schistocerca gregaria were significantly delayed compared with normoxic conditions. Exposure to hyperoxic conditions (40\% O-2, 60\% N-2) resulted in a similar delay in forced ventilation. Together, these results indicate that limits to oxygen diffusion to the tissues during spiracle closure trigger ventilatory movements, which in turn support tissue demands.

article,"Seasonal changes in the behaviour and respiration physiology of the freshwater duck mussel, <i>Anodonta anatina</i>","Lurman, Glenn and Walter, Johanna and Hoppeler, Hans H.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"For low-energy organisms such as bivalves, the costs of thermal compensation of biological rates (synonymous with acclimation or acclimatization) may be higher than the benefits. We therefore conducted two experiments to examine the effect of seasonal temperature changes on behaviour and oxygen consumption. In the first experiment, we examined the effects of seasonal temperature changes on the freshwater bivalve Anodonta anatina, taking measurements each month for a year at the corresponding temperature for that time of year. There was no evidence for compensation of burrowing valve closure duration or frequency, or locomotory speed. In the second experiment, we compared A. anatina at summer and winter temperatures (24 and 4 C, respectively) and found no evidence for compensation of the burrowing rate, valve closure duration or frequency, or oxygen consumption rates during burrowing, immediately after valve closure or at rest. Within the experimental limits of this study, the evidence suggests that thermal compensation of biological rates is not a strategy employed by A. anatina. We argue that this is due to either a lack of evolutionary pressure to acclimatize, or evolutionary pressure to not acclimatize. Firstly, there is little incentive to increase metabolic rate to enhance predatory ability given that these are filter feeders. Secondly, maintained low energetic demand, enhanced at winter temperatures, is essential for predator avoidance, i.e. valve closure. Thus, we suggest that the costs of acclimatization outweigh the benefits in A. anatina.",2014,10.1242/jeb.093450,217,2,235-243,NA,Bivalve; Locomotion; Oxygen consumption; Thermal acclimation; Unionid; Valve closure
article,Precision of archerfish C-starts is fully temperature compensated,"Krupczynski, Philipp and Schuster, Stefan",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Hunting archerfish precisely adapt their predictive C-starts to the initial movement of dislodged prey so that turn angle and initial speed are matched to the place and time of the later point of catch. The high accuracy and the known target point of the starts allow a sensitive straightforward assay of how temperature affects the underlying circuits. Furthermore, archerfish face rapid temperature fluctuations in their mangrove biotopes that could compromise performance. Here, we show that after a brief acclimation period the function of the C-starts was fully maintained over a range of operating temperatures: (i) full responsiveness was maintained at all temperatures, (ii) at all temperatures the fish selected accurate turns and were able to do so over the full angular range, (iii) at all temperatures speed attained immediately after the end of the C-start was matched - with equal accuracy - to `virtual speed', i. e. the ratio of remaining distance to the future landing point and remaining time. While precision was fully temperature compensated, C-start latency was not and increased by about 4 ms per 1 degrees C cooling. Also, kinematic aspects of the C-start were only partly temperature compensated. Above 26 degrees C, the duration of the two major phases of the C-start were temperature compensated. At lower temperatures, however, durations increased similar to latency. Given the accessibility of the underlying networks, the archerfish predictive start should be an excellent model to assay the degree of plasticity and functional stability of C-start motor patterns.",2013,10.1242/jeb.088856,216,18,3450-3460,NA,M-cell network; acclimation; motor circuit; functional stability; circuit homeostasis

Using the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) transcriptomic database GigaTON, we characterized seven G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) named Cragi-CTR1-7 and phylogenetically related to chordate CT receptors (CTRs) and to protostome DH31 receptors. Two CT precursors (Cragi-CTP1 and Cragi-CTP2) containing two CT-type peptides and encoded by two distinct genes with a similar organization were also characterized. These oyster neuropeptides (Cragi-CT1/2) exhibit the two N-terminal paired cysteine residues and, except CTP2-derived peptide (Cragi-CTP2dp), show the C-terminal proline-amide motif typical of deuterostome CT-type peptides. All mature Cragi-CTs except Cragi-CTP2dp were detected in visceral ganglion extracts using mass spectrometry. Cell-based assays revealed that the previously characterized oyster receptors Cg-CT-R and Cragi-CTR2 were specifically activated by Cragi-CT1b and Cragi-CT2, respectively. This activation does not require the co-expression of receptor activity modifying proteins (RAMPs). Thus, oyster CT signalling appears functionally more closely related to vertebrate CT/CTR signalling than to calcitonin gene-related peptide/calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CGRP/CLR) signalling. Gene expression profiles in different adult tissues and in oysters acclimated to brackish water suggest the potential implication of both Cg-CT-R/Cragi-CT1b and Cragi-CTR2/Cragi-CT2 in water and ionic regulations, although with apparently opposite effects.

These changes provide sperm with the ability to fertilize. In the bat Corynorhinus mexicanus, there is an asynchrony between spermatogenesis and sperm storage in the male with the receptivity of the female. For instance, in C. mexicanus, spermatogenesis occurs before the reproductive season. During the reproductive period, sperm are stored in the epididymis for a few months and the testis undergoes a regression, indicating low or almost null sperm production. Therefore, it is unclear whether the elements necessary for sperm fertilization success undergo maturation or preparation during epididymis storage. Here, we characterized pH-sensitive motility hyperactivation and Ca2+ influx in sperm, regulated by alkalinization and progesterone. In addition, by electrophysiological recordings, we registered currents that were stimulated by alkalinization and inhibited by RU1968 (a CatSper-specific inhibitor), strongly suggesting that these currents were evoked via CatSper, a sperm Ca2+-specific channel indispensable for mammalian fertilization. We also found hyperpolarization of the membrane potential, such as in other mammalian species, which increased according to the month of capture, reaching the biggest hyperpolarization during the mating season. In conclusion, our results suggest that C. mexicanus sperm have functional CatSper and undergo a capacitation-like process such as in other mammals, particularly Ca2+ influx and membrane potential hyperpolarization.",2023,10.1242/jeb.244878,226,2,NA,jeb244878,CatSper; Sperm storage; Ion channel; Capacitation

We show that prior studies that found no effects of air temperature on flight metabolism of honey bees achieved flight muscle temperatures that were near or on equal, opposite sides of the thermal performance curve.

article,Sex and early-life conditions shape telomere dynamics in an ectotherm,"Hansson, Alexander and Wapstra, Erik and While, Geoffrey M. and Olsson, Mats",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Telomeres, the repetitive DNA regions that protect the ends of chromosomes, and their shortening have been linked to key life history trade-offs among growth, reproduction and lifespan. In contrast to most endotherms, many ectotherms can compensate for telomere shortening throughout life by upregulation of telomerase in somatic tissues. However, during development, marked by rapid growth and an increased sensitivity to extrinsic factors, the upregulation of telomerase may be overwhelmed, resulting in longterm impacts on telomere dynamics. In ectotherms, one extrinsic factor that may play a particularly important role in development is temperature. Here, we investigated the influence of developmental temperature and sex on early -life telomere dynamics in an oviparous ectotherm, Lacerta agilis. While there was no effect of developmental temperature on telomere length at hatching, there were subsequent effects on telomere maintenance capacity, with individuals incubated at warm temperatures exhibiting less telomere maintenance compared with cool -incubated individuals. Telomere dynamics were also sexually dimorphic, with females having longer telomeres and greater telomere maintenance compared with males. We suggest that selection drives this sexual dimorphism in telomere maintenance, in which females maximise their lifetime reproductive success by investing in traits promoting longevity such as maintenance, while males invest in short-term reproductive gains through a polygynous mating behaviour. These early -life effects, therefore, have the potential to mediate life-long changes to life histories.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246512,227,3,NA,jeb246512,Telomere dynamics; Development; Incubation temperature; Life history; Sexual dimorphism; Reptile
article,It's cool to be stressed: body surface temperatures track sympathetic nervous system activation during acute stress,"Jerem, Paul and Romero, Michael",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The acute stress response can be considered the primary evolutionary adaptation to maximise fitness in the face of unpredictable environmental challenges. However, the difficulties of assessing physiology in natural environments mean that comparatively little is known about how response variation influences fitness in free-living animals. Currently, determining acute stress physiology typically involves blood sampling or cardiac monitoring. Both require trapping and handling, interrupting natural behaviour, and potentially biasing our understanding toward trappable species/individuals. Importantly, limits on repeated sampling also restrict response phenotype characterisation, vital for linking stress with fitness. Surface temperature dynamics resulting from peripheral vasomotor activity during acute stress are increasingly promoted as alternative physiological stress indicators, which can be measured non-invasively using infrared thermal imaging, overcoming many limitations of current methods. Nonetheless, which aspects of stress physiology they represent remains unclear, as the underlying mechanisms are unknown. To date, validations have primarily targeted the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, when the sympathetic- adrenal-medullary (SAM) system is likely the primary driver of vasomotor activity during acute stress. To address this deficit, we compared eye and bill region surface temperatures (measured using thermal imaging) with SAM system activity (measured as heart rate variability via electrocardiogram telemetry) in wild-caught captive house sparrows (Passer domesticus) during capture and handling. We found that lower body surface temperatures were associated with increased sympathetic nervous system activation. Consequently, our data confirm that body surface temperatures can act as a proxy for sympathetic activation during acute stress, providing potentially transformative opportunities for linking the acute stress response with fitness in the wild.",2023,10.1242/jeb.246552,226,20,NA,jeb246552,Body temperature; Non-invasive; Fight-or-flight; Sympathetic-adrenal-medullary system; Thermal imaging
article,Elevated cortisol lowers thermal tolerance but results in limited cardiac remodelling in rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) experiencing chronic social stress,"Bard, Brittany and Dodge, Annette and Joyce, William and Lawrence, Michael and Cooke, Steven J. and Gilmour, Kathleen M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) held in pairs form dominance hierarchies in which subordinate individuals experience chronic social stress accompanied by lowered thermal tolerance (assessed as the critical thermal maximum, CTmax). Here, we tested the hypothesis that chronic elevation of circulating cortisol levels reduces thermal tolerance in subordinate trout. In support of this hypothesis, subordinate trout that recovered from social stress for 48 h, a period sufficient to return cortisol to normal baseline levels, no longer showed reduced CTmax. Further, thermal tolerance was not restored in subordinates treated with cortisol during recovery from social stress. To explore possible mechanisms underlying the effect of chronic stress on CTmax, we also tested the hypothesis that chronic cortisol elevation induces cardiac remodelling in subordinate trout, as previously reported for cortisol-treated rainbow trout. Ventricle mass and cardiac hypertrophy markers were unaffected by social stress. Picrosirius Red staining revealed a trend for lower collagen levels in the ventricles of subordinate relative to dominant trout. However, collagen type I transcript and protein levels, and markers of collagen turnover were unaffected. Indicators of cardiac function, including ventricle passive stiffness and intrinsic heart rate (f(H)), similarly were unaffected. In vivo f(H) was also similar between subordinate and dominant fish. Nevertheless, in keeping with their lower CTmax, subordinate fish exhibited cardiac arrhythmia at significantly lower temperatures than dominant fish during CTmax trials. Thus, high baseline cortisol levels in subordinate trout result in lowered thermal tolerance, but 5 days of social stress did not greatly affect cardiac structure or function.",2021,10.1242/jeb.238683,224,13,NA,jeb238683,CTmax; Cortisol; Cardiac remodelling; Heart rate
article,Do endotherms have thermal performance curves?,"Levesque, Danielle L. and Marshall, Katie E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature is an important environmental factor governing the ability of organisms to grow, survive and reproduce. Thermal performance curves (TPCs), with some caveats, are useful for charting the relationship between body temperature and some measure of performance in ectotherms, and provide a standardized set of characteristics for interspecific comparisons. Endotherms, however, have a more complicated relationship with environmental temperature, as endothermy leads to a decoupling of body temperature from external temperature through use of metabolic heat production, large changes in insulation and variable rates of evaporative heat loss. This has impeded our ability to model endothermic performance in relation to environmental temperature as well as to readily compare performance between species. In this Commentary, we compare the strengths and weaknesses of potential TPC analogues (including other useful proxies for linking performance to temperature) in endotherms and suggest several ways forward in the comparative ecophysiology of endotherms. Our goal is to provide a common language with which ecologists and physiologists can evaluate the effects of temperature on performance. Key directions for improving our understanding of endotherm thermoregulatory physiology include a comparative approach to the study of the level and precision of body temperature, measuring performance directly over a range of body temperatures and building comprehensive mechanistic models of endotherm responses to environmental temperatures. We believe the answer to the question posed in the title could be `yes', but only if `performance' is well defined and understood in relation to body temperature variation, and the costs and benefits of endothermy are specifically modelled.",2021,10.1242/jeb.141309,224,3,NA,jeb141309,Temperature; Heterothemy; Thermal profiles; Scholander-Irving model; Critical limits; Thermal tolerance

Thus, we hypothesized that hypoxia during the embryonic phase of parabronchial development induces morphological changes that remain after hatching. To test this hypothesis, chicken embryos were incubated entirely (21 days) under normoxia or partially under hypoxia (15\% O-2 during days 12 to 18). Lung structures, including air capillaries, blood capillaries, infundibula, atria, parabronchial lumen, bronchi, blood vessels larger than capillaries and interparabronchial tissue, in 1- and 10-day-old chicks were analyzed using light microscopy-assisted stereology. Tissue barrier and surface area of air capillaries were measured using electron microscopy-assisted stereology, allowing for calculation of the anatomical diffusion factor. Hypoxia increased the relative volumes of air and blood capillaries, structures directly involved in gas exchange, but decreased the relative volumes of atria in both groups of chicks, and the parabronchial lumen in older chicks. Accordingly, the surface area of the air capillaries and the anatomical diffusion factor were increased under hypoxic incubation. Treatment did not alter total lung volume, relative volumes of infundibula, bronchi, blood vessels larger than capillaries, interparabronchial tissue or the tissue barrier of any group. We conclude that hypoxia during the embryonic phase of parabronchial development leads to a morphological remodeling, characterized by increased volume density and respiratory surface area of structures involved in gas exchange at the expense of structures responsible for air conduction in chicks up to 10 days old.",2019,10.1242/jeb.197970,222,10,NA,jeb197970,Incubation; Blood capillary; Air capillary; Lung; Blood-gas tissue barrier; Chicken
article,The effects of extended crawling on the physiology and swim performance of loggerhead and green sea turtle hatchlings,"Pankaew, Karen and Milton, Sarah L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Following emergence from the nest, sea turtle hatchling dispersal can be disrupted by artificial lights or skyglow from urban areas. Misorientation or disorientation may increase exposure to predation, thermal stress and dehydration, and consume valuable energy, thus decreasing the likelihood of survival. In this study hatchlings were run on a treadmill for 200 or 500 m to investigate the physiological impacts of disorientation crawling in loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and green (Chelonia mydas) sea turtle hatchlings. Oxygen consumption, lactate production and blood glucose levels were determined, and swim performance was measured over 2 h following crawls. Crawl distances were also determined for hatchlings that disoriented on the Boca Raton beach in Florida, with plasma lactate and blood glucose sampled for both properly oriented and disoriented hatchlings. Green and loggerhead hatchlings rested for 8-12\% and 22-25\% of crawl time, respectively, both in the laboratory and when disoriented on the beach, which was significantly longer than the time spent resting in non-disoriented turtles. As a result of these rest periods, the extended crawl distances had little effect on oxygen consumption, blood glucose or plasma lactate levels. Swim performance over 2 h following the crawls also changed little compared with controls. Plasma lactate concentrations were significantly higher in hatchlings sampled in the field, but did not correlate with crawl distance. The greatest immediate impact of extended crawling as a result of disorientation events is likely to be the significantly greater period of time spent on the beach and thus exposure to predation.",2018,10.1242/jeb.165225,221,1,NA,jeb165225,Disorientation; Frenzy crawl; Oxygen consumption; Energetics; Caretta caretta; Chelonia mydas

The Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) occurs as a large metapopulation in which adult butterflies frequently disperse between small local populations. Here, we examine how the interaction between oxygen availability and fuel use affects flight performance in the Glanville fritillary. Individuals were flown under either normoxic (21 kPa O-2) or hypoxic (10 kPa O-2) conditions and their flight metabolism was measured. To determine resource use, levels of circulating glucose, trehalose and whole-body triglyceride were recorded after flight. Flight performance was significantly reduced in hypoxic conditions. When flown under normoxic conditions, we observed a positive correlation among individuals between post-flight circulating trehalose levels and flight metabolic rate, suggesting that low levels of circulating trehalose constrains flight metabolism. To test this hypothesis experimentally, we measured the flight metabolic rate of individuals injected with a trehalase inhibitor. In support of the hypothesis, experimental butterflies showed significantly reduced flight metabolic rate, but not resting metabolic rate, in comparison to control individuals. By contrast, under hypoxia there was no relationship between trehalose and flight metabolic rate. Additionally, in this case, flight metabolic rate was reduced in spite of circulating trehalose levels that were high enough to support high flight metabolic rate under normoxic conditions. These results demonstrate a significant interaction between oxygen and energy availability for the control of flight performance.",2016,10.1242/jeb.138180,219,10,1488-1494,NA,Flight capacity; Glanville fritillary; Hypoxia; Metabolism; Respirometry; Trehalose
article,Muscle membrane potential and insect chill coma,"Andersen, Jonas L. and MacMillan, Heath A. and Overgaard, Johannes",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Chill-susceptible insects enter a reversible paralytic state, termed chill coma, at mild low temperatures. Chill coma is caused by neuromuscular impairment, allegedly triggered by cold-induced depolarization of muscle resting membrane potential (V-m). We used five Drosophila species that vary in cold tolerance (chill coma temperature spanning similar to 11 degrees C) and repeatedly measured muscle V-m during a downward temperature ramp (20 to -3 degrees C). Cold-tolerant species were able to defend their V-m down to lower temperatures, which is not explained by species-specific differences in initial V-m at 20 degrees C, but by cold-tolerant drosophilids defending V-m across a broad range of temperatures. We found support for a previously suggested `critical threshold' of V-m, related to chill coma, in three of the five species. Interestingly, the cold-tolerant Drosophila species may enter coma as a result of processes unrelated to muscle depolarization as their V-m was not significantly depolarized at their chill coma temperatures.",2015,10.1242/jeb.123760,218,16,2492-2495,NA,Chill tolerance; Critical thermal minimum; Cold exposure; Comparative; Inter-species
article,Anoxia-mediated calcium release through the mitochondrial permeability transition pore silences NMDA receptor currents in turtle neurons,"Hawrysh, Peter John and Buck, Leslie Thomas",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Mammalian neurons are anoxia sensitive and rapidly undergo excitotoxic cell death when deprived of oxygen, mediated largely by Ca2+ entry through over-activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). This does not occur in neurons of the anoxia-tolerant western painted turtle, where a decrease in NMDAR currents is observed with anoxia. This decrease is dependent on a modest rise in cytosolic {[}Ca2+] ({[}Ca2+](c)) that is mediated by release from the mitochondria. The aim of this study was to determine whether the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is involved in NMDAR silencing through release of mitochondrial Ca2+. Opening the mPTP during normoxia with atractyloside decreased NMDAR currents by releasing mitochondrial Ca2+, indicated by an increase in Oregon Green fluorescence. Conversely, the mPTP blocker cyclosporin A prevented the anoxia-mediated increase in {[}Ca2+](c) and reduction in NMDAR currents. Mitochondrial membrane potential (Psi(m)) was determined using rhodamine-123 fluorescence and decreased with the onset of anoxia in a time frame that coincided with the increase in [}Ca2+](c). Activation of mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium (mK(ATP)(+)) channels also releases mitochondrial Ca2+ and we show that activation of mK(ATP)(+) channels during normoxia with diazoxide leads to Psi(m) depolarization and inhibition with 5-hydroxydecanoic acid blocked anoxia-mediated Psi(m) depolarization. Psi(m) does not collapse during anoxia but rather reaches a new steady-state level that is maintained via ATP hydrolysis by the F-1-F-0 ATPase, as inhibition with oligomycin depolarizes Psi(m) further than the anoxic level. We conclude that anoxia activates mK(ATP)(+) channels, which leads to matrix depolarization, Ca2+ release via the mPTP, and ultimately silencing of NMDARs.",2013,10.1242/jeb.092650,216,23,4375-4387,NA,mitochondrial membrane potential; mitochondrial BK channel; pyramidal neurons; whole-cell patch-clamp; anoxia tolerance; channel arrest
article,On the methodological limitations of detecting oxidative stress: effects of paraquat on measures of oxidative status in greenfinches,"Meitern, Richard and Sild, Elin and Kilk, Kalle and Porosk, Rando and Horak, Peeter",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Oxidative stress (OS) is widely believed to be responsible for the generation of trade-offs in evolutionary ecology by means of constraining investment into a number of components of fitness. Yet, progress in understanding the true role of OS in ecology and evolution has remained elusive. Interpretation of current findings is particularly hampered by the scarcity of experiments demonstrating which of the many available parameters of oxidative status respond most sensitively to and are relevant for measuring OS. We addressed these questions in wild-caught captive greenfinches (Carduelis chloris) by experimental induction of OS by administration of the pro-oxidant compound paraquat with drinking water. Treatment induced 50\% mortality, a significant drop in body mass and an increase in oxidative DNA damage and glutathione levels in erythrocytes among the survivors of the high paraquat (0.2 g l(-1) over 7 days) group. Samples taken 3 days after the end of paraquat treatment showed no effect on the peroxidation of lipids (plasma malondialdehyde), carbonylation of proteins (in erythrocytes), parameters of plasma antioxidant protection (total antioxidant capacity and oxygen radical absorbance), uric acid or carotenoids. Our findings of an increase in one marker of damage and one marker of protection from the multitude of measured variables indicate that detection of OS is difficult even under the most stringent experimental induction of oxidative insult. We hope that this study highlights the need for reconsideration of over-simplistic models of OS and draws attention to the limitations of detection of OS due to time-lagged and hormetic upregulation of protective mechanisms. This study also underpins the diagnostic value of measurement of oxidative damage to DNA bases and assessment of erythrocyte glutathione levels.",2013,10.1242/jeb.087528,216,14,2713-2721,NA,DNA damage; glutathione; oxidative damage; antioxidant protection; passerine bird

However, it remains unclear how these defenses work. The present study examined changes in key enzymes of the enzymatic antioxidant system and the glutathione (GSH) system at both the mRNA and enzyme activity levels during acute cold exposure and recovery in juvenile Chinese soft shelled turtles, Pelodiscus sinensis. Transcript levels of the upstream regulator NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) were also measured. Turtles were acdimated at 28 degrees C (3 weeks), then given acute cold exposure (8 degrees C, 12 h) and finally placed in recovery (28 degrees C, 24 h). The mRNA levels of cerebral and hepatic Nrf2 and of genes encoding downstream antioxidant enzymes did not change, whereas levels of nephric Nrf2, manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) mRNA decreased upon cold exposure. During recovery, Nrf2 mRNA remained stable in all three tissues, hepatic Cu/ZnSOD, MnSOD and catalase (CAT) mRNA levels increased, and nephric MnSOD and GPx4 mRNAs did not change from the values during cold exposure. In the GSH system, mRNA levels of most enzymes remained constant during cold exposure and recovery. Unmatched with changes in mRNA level, high and stable constitutive antioxidant enzyme activities were maintained throughout, whereas GPx activity significantly reduced in the kidney during cold exposure, and in liver and kidney during recovery. Our results suggest that the antioxidant defense regulation in response to acute cold exposure in P. sinensis may not be achieved at the transcriptional level, but may rely mainly on high constitutive antioxidant enzyme activities.",2019,10.1242/jeb.197863,222,4,NA,jeb197863,Antioxidant enzymes; GSH system; Intense thermal fluctuation; Nrf2; Oxidative stress
article,Induced cold-tolerance mechanisms depend on duration of acclimation in the chill-sensitive Folsomia candida (Collembola),"Waagner, Dorthe and Holmstrup, Martin and Bayley, Mark and Sorensen, Jesper G.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"During cold periods ectotherms may improve low temperature tolerance via rapid cold hardening (RCH) over a period of hours and/ or long-term cold acclimation (LTCA) during days, weeks or months. However, the effect of duration and the major underlying mechanisms of these processes are still not fully understood. In the present study, the molecular and biochemical responses to RCH (1-3 h) and LTCA (1-3 days) and the corresponding benefits to survival were investigated using the chill-sensitive collembolan Folsomia candida. We investigated osmolyte accumulation, membrane restructuring and transcription of candidate genes as well as survival benefits in response to RCH and LTCA. RCH induced significant upregulation of targeted genes encoding enzymes related to carbohydrate metabolic pathways and genes encoding small and constitutively expressed heat shock proteins (Hsps), indicating that the animals rely on protein protection from a subset of Hsps during RCH and probably also LTCA. The upregulation of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolic processes initiated during RCH was likely responsible for a transient accumulation of myoinositol during LTCA, which may support the protection of protein and membrane function and structure. Membrane restructuring, composed especially of a significantly increased ratio of unsaturated to saturated phospholipid fatty acids seems to be a mechanism supplementary to activation of Hsps and myoinositol accumulation in LTCA. Thus, the moderate increase in cold shock tolerance conferred by RCH seems to be dominated by effects of Hsps, whereas the substantially better cold tolerance achieved after LTCA is dominated by post-transcriptional processes increasing membrane fluidity and cryoprotectant concentration.",2013,10.1242/jeb.079814,216,11,1991-2000,NA,cold acclimation; cryoprotection; gene expression; heat shock protein; homeoviscous adaptation; membrane phospholipid; rapid cold hardening

In this study, we examined the cardiovascular function of anesthetized rats before, during and after being constricted by boas (Boa constrictor) to examine the effect of constriction on the prey's circulatory function. The results demonstrate that within 6 s of being constricted, peripheral arterial blood pressure (PBP) at the femoral artery dropped to 1/2 of baseline values while central venous pressure (CVP) increased 6-fold from baseline during the same time. Electrocardiographic recordings from the anesthetized rat's heart revealed profound bradycardia as heart rate (f(H)) dropped to nearly half of baseline within 60 s of being constricted, and QRS duration nearly doubled over the same time period. By the end of constriction (mean 6.5 +/- 1 min), rat PBP dropped 2.9-fold, f(H) dropped 3.9-fold, systemic perfusion pressure (SPP=PBP-CVP) dropped 5.7-fold, and 91\% of rats (10 of 11) had evidence of cardiac electrical dysfunction. Blood drawn immediately after constriction revealed that, relative to baseline, rats were hyperkalemic (serum potassium levels nearly doubled) and acidotic (blood pH dropped from 7.4 to 7.0).

Here we tested the hypothesis that dexamethasone, an artificial GC, increases fat and protein catabolism, and induces departure from the breeding colony in wild, fasting grey seal pups. A single intramuscular dose of dexamethasone completely suppressed cortisol production for 24-72 h, demonstrating activation of GC receptors. In experiment 1, we compared the effects of a single dose of dexamethasone or saline administered 10 days after weaning on fasting mass and body composition changes, cortisol, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and glucose levels, and timing of departure from the colony. In experiment 2, we investigated the effects of dexamethasone on short-term (5 days) changes in mass loss, body composition and BUN levels. In experiment 1, dexamethasone induced a short-lived increase in mass loss, but there was no difference in timing of departure between dexamethasone-and saline-treated pups (N=10). In experiment 2, dexamethasone increased protein and water loss and prevented a decrease in BUN levels (N=11). Our data suggest changes in cortisol contribute to regulation of protein catabolism in fasting seal pups, irrespective of the sex of the animal, but do not terminate fasting.

article,Thermogenesis is supported by high rates of circulatory fatty acid and triglyceride delivery in highland deer mice,"Lyons, Sulayman A. and McClelland, Grant B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Highland native deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) have greater rates of lipid oxidation during maximal cold challenge in hypoxia (hypoxic cold-induced <(V) over dot>(O2,max)) compared with their lowland conspecifics. Lipid oxidation is also increased in deer mice acclimated to simulated high altitude (cold hypoxia), regardless of altitude ancestry. The underlying lipid metabolic pathway traits responsible for sustaining maximal thermogenic demand in deer mice is currently unknown. The objective of this study was to characterize key steps in the lipid oxidation pathway in highland and lowland deer mice acclimated to control (23 degrees C, 21 kPa O-2) or cold hypoxic (5 degrees C, 12 kPa O-2) conditions. We hypothesized that capacities for lipid delivery and tissue uptake will be greater in highlanders and further increase with cold hypoxia acclimation. With the transition from rest to hypoxic cold-induced <(V) over dot>(O2,max), both highland and lowland deer mice showed increased plasma glycerol concentrations and fatty acid availability. Interestingly, acclimation to cold hypoxia led to increased plasma triglyceride concentrations at cold-induced <(V) over dot>(O2,max), but only in highlanders. Highlanders also had significantly greater delivery rates of circulatory free fatty acids and triglycerides due to higher plasma flow rates at cold-induced <(V) over dot>(O2,max). We found no population or acclimation differences in fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36) abundance in the gastrocnemius or brown adipose tissue, suggesting that fatty acid uptake across membranes is not limiting during thermogenesis.

article,Thermal robustness of biomechanical processes,"Olberding, Jeffrey P. and Deban, Stephen M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature influences many physiological processes that govern life as a result of the thermal sensitivity of chemical reactions. The repeated evolution of endothermy and widespread behavioral thermoregulation in animals highlight the importance of elevating tissue temperature to increase the rate of chemical processes. Yet, movement performance that is robust to changes in body temperature has been observed in numerous species. This thermally robust performance appears exceptional in light of the well-documented effects of temperature on muscle contractile properties, including shortening velocity, force, power and work. Hem, we propose that the thermal robustness of movements in which mechanical processes replace or augment chemical processes is a general feature of any organismal system, spanning kingdoms. The use of recoiling elastic structures to power movement in place of direct muscle shortening is one of the most thoroughly studied mechanical processes: using these studies as a basis, we outline an analytical framework for detecting thermal robustness, relying on the comparison of temperature coefficients (Q(10) values) between chemical and mechanical processes. We then highlight other biomechanical systems in which thermally robust performance that arises from mechanical processes may be identified using this framework. Studying diverse movements in the context of temperature will both reveal mechanisms underlying performance and allow the prediction of changes in performance in response to a changing thermal environment, thus deepening our understanding of the thermal ecology of many organisms.",2021,10.1242/jeb.228973,224,1,NA,jeb228973,Thermal sensitivity; Performance; Movement; Locomotion; Feeding; Temperature; Muscle
article,Defects in mating behavior and tail morphology are the primary cause of sterility in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> males at high temperature,"Nett, Emily M. and Sepulveda, Nicholas B. and Petrella, Lisa N.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Reproduction is a fundamental imperative of all forms of life. For all the advantages sexual reproduction confers, it has a deeply conserved flaw: it is temperature sensitive. As temperatures rise, fertility decreases. Across species, male fertility is particularly sensitive to elevated temperature. Previously, we have shown in the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that all males are fertile at 20 degrees C, but almost all males have lost fertility at 27 degrees C. Male fertility is dependent on the production of functional sperm, successful mating and transfer of sperm, and successful fertilization post-mating. To determine how male fertility is impacted by elevated temperature, we analyzed these aspects of male reproduction at 27 degrees C in three wild-type strains of C. elegans: JU1171, LKC34 and N2. We found no effect of elevated temperature on the number of immature non-motile spermatids formed. There was only a weak effect of elevated temperature on sperm activation. In stark contrast, there was a strong effect of elevated temperature on male mating behavior, male tail morphology and sperm transfer such that males very rarely completed mating successfully when exposed to 27 degrees C. Therefore, we propose a model where elevated temperature reduces male fertility as a result of the negative impacts of temperature on the somatic tissues necessary for mating. Loss of successful mating at elevated temperature overrides any effects that temperature may have on the germline or sperm cells.",2019,10.1242/jeb.208041,222,24,NA,jeb208041,Temperature stress; Male behavior; Sperm; Thermosensitivity

Under hypoxia, the goldfish heart increases its performance, representing a putative component of hypoxia tolerance; however, the underlying mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of (beta 3-adrenoreceptors (ARs) in the mechanisms that modulate goldfish heart performance along with the impact of oxygen levels. By western blotting analysis, we found that the goldfish heart expresses beta 3-ARs, and this expression increases under hypoxia. The effects of beta 3-AR stimulation were analysed by using an ex vivo working heart preparation. Under normoxia, the beta 3-AR-selective agonist BRL37344 (10(-12) to 10(-7) mol l(-1)) elicited a concentration-dependent increase of contractility that was abolished by a specific beta 3-AR antagonist (SR59230A; 10(-8) mol l(-1)), but not by alpha/beta 1/beta 2-AR inhibitors (phentolamine, nadolol and ICI118,551; 10(-7) mol l(-1)). Under acute hypoxia, BRL37344 did not affect goldfish heart performance. However, SR59230A, but not phentolamine, nadolol or ICl118,551, abolished the time-dependent enhancement of contractility that characterizes the hypoxic goldfish heart. Under both normoxia and hypoxia, adenylate cyclase and cAMP were found to be involved in the beta 3-AR-dependent downstream transduction pathway.

Thus, organisms may have the capacity to alter mitochondria! processes through acclimation or adaptation to mitigate these effects. One possible mechanism is through the action of uncoupling proteins (UCPs), which can decrease the proton-motive force independent of the production of ATP. To test this hypothesis, we examined the mRNA expression patterns of UCP isoforms and characterized the effects of thermal acclimation and putative local thermal adaptation on mitochondria! capacity, proton leak and P/O ratios in two subspecies of Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus). Ucp1 was the dominant isoform in liver and was more highly expressed in northern killifish. We found that cold acclimation increased mitochondrial capacity (state Ill and maximum substrate oxidation capacity), state II membrane potential, proton leak and P/O ratios in northern, but not southern, killifish liver mitochondria. Palmitate induced mitochondrial uncoupling was detected in northern, but not southern, killifish liver mitochondria, consistent with the differences in Ucp mRNA expression between the subspecies. Taken together, our data suggest that mitochondrial function is more plastic in response to thermal acclimation in northern killifish than in southern killifish and that UCP1 may play a role in regulating the proton-motive force in northern, but not southern, killifish in response to thermal acclimation. These data demonstrate the potential for adaptive variation in mitochondrial plasticity in response to cold.",2018,10.1242/jeb.186320,221,24,NA,jeb186320,Fundulus heteroclitus; Temperature; Mitochondria; Fish; UCP; Adaptation

The high blood-O(2 )affinity of this species was originally attributed to a single amino acid substitution of the major hemoglobin (Hb) isoform, HbA, which was thought to destabilize the low-affinity T state, thereby shifting the T-R allosteric equilibrium towards the high-affinity R state. Surprisingly, this mechanistic hypothesis has never been addressed using native proteins purified from blood. Here, we report a detailed analysis of O-2 equilibria and kinetics of native major HbA and minor HbD isoforms from bar-headed goose and greylag goose (Anser anser), a strictly lowland species, to identify and characterize the mechanistic basis for the adaptive change in Hb function. We find that HbA and HbD of bar-headed goose have consistently higher O-2 affinities than those of the greylag goose. The corresponding Hb isoforms of the two species are equally responsive to physiological allosteric cofactors and have similar Bohr effects. Thermodynamic analyses of O-2 equilibrium curves according to the two-state Monod-Wyman-Changeaux model revealed higher R-state O-2 affinities in the bar-headed goose Hbs, associated with lower O-2 dissociation rates, compared with the greylag goose. Conversely, the T state was not destabilized and the T-R allosteric equilibrium was unaltered in bar-headed goose Hbs. The physiological implication of these results is that increased R-state affinity allows for enhanced O(2 )saturation in the lungs during hypoxia, but without impairing O-2 delivery to tissues.",2018,10.1242/jeb.185470,221,18,NA,jeb185470,High-altitude; Blood; Oxygen transport; Allostery; Adaptation; Hypoxia

Satellite and animal motion datalogging tags were used to study the inter-nesting behavior of two female loggerhead turtles in the Gulf of Mexico, which regularly has hurricanes and tropical storms during nesting season. We contrast the behavioral patterns and swimming energetics of these two turtles, the first tracked in calm weather and the second tracked before, during and after a tropical storm. Turtle 1 was highly active and swam at the surface or submerged 95\% of the time during the entire inter-nesting period, with a high estimated specific oxygen consumption rate (0.95 ml min(-1) kg(-0.83)). Turtle 2 was inactive for most of the first 9 days of the inter-nesting period, during which she rested at the bottom (80\% of the time) with low estimated oxygen consumption (0.62 ml min(-1) kg(-0.83)). Midway through the internesting period, turtle 2 encountered a tropical storm and became highly active (swimming 88\% of the time during and 95\% after the storm). Her oxygen consumption increased significantly to 0.97 ml min(-1) kg(-0.83) during and 0.98 ml min-1 kg(-0.83) after the storm. However, despite the tropical storm, turtle 2 returned to the nesting beach, where she successfully re-nested 75 m from her previous nest. Thus, the tropical storm had a minor effect on this female's individual nesting success, even though the storm caused 90\% loss nests at Casey Key.",2017,10.1242/jeb.162644,220,19,3432-3441,NA,Activity level; Climate change; Animal motion tags; Satellite tags; Loggerhead turtle; Tropical storm
article,GABA metabolism is crucial for long-term survival of anoxia in annual killifish embryos,"Zajic, Daniel E. and Podrabsky, Jason E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In most vertebrates, a lack of oxygen quickly leads to irreparable damages to vital organs, such as the brain and heart. However, there are some vertebrates that have evolved mechanisms to survive periods of no oxygen (anoxia). The annual killifish (Austrofundulus limnaeus) survives in ephemeral ponds in the coastal deserts of Venezuela and their embryos have the remarkable ability to tolerate anoxia for months. When exposed to anoxia, embryos of A. limnaeus respond by producing significant amounts of y-aminobutyric acid (GABA). This study aims to understand the role of GABA in supporting the metabolic response to anoxia. To explore this, we investigated four developmentally distinct stages of A. limnaeus embryos that vary in their anoxia tolerance. We measured GABA and lactate concentrations across development in response to anoxia and aerobic recovery. We then inhibited enzymes responsible for the production and degradation of GABA and observed GABA and lactate concentrations, as well as embryo mortality. Here, we show for the first time that GABA metabolism affects anoxia tolerance in A. limnaeus embryos. Inhibition of enzymes responsible for GABA production (glutamate decarboxylase) and degradation (GABA-transaminase and succinic acid semialdehyde dehydrogenase) led to increased mortality, supporting a role for GABA as an intermediate product and not a metabolic end-product. We propose multiple roles for GABA during anoxia and aerobic recovery in A. limnaeus embryos, serving as a neurotransmitter, an energy source, and an anti-oxidant.",2020,10.1242/jeb.229715,223,20,NA,jeb229716,Aerobic recovery; Anoxia; Austrofundulus limnaeus; GABA; Lactate; Metabolism

In this study, we identified a contextual stimulus that induces rapid and robust thermogenesis in skeletal muscle. Rats exposed to the odor of a natural predator (ferret) showed elevated skeletal muscle temperatures detectable as quickly as 2 min after exposure, reaching maximum thermogenesis of >1.5 degrees C at 10-15 min. Mice exhibited a similar thermogenic response to the same odor. Ferret odor induced a significantly larger and qualitatively different response from that of novel or aversive odors, fox odor or moderate restraint stress. Exposure to predator odor increased energy expenditure, and both the thermogenic and energetic effects persisted when physical activity levels were controlled. Predator odor-induced muscle thermogenesis is subject to associative learning as exposure to a conditioned stimulus provoked a rise in muscle temperature in the absence of the odor. The ability of predator odor to induce thermogenesis is predominantly controlled by sympathetic nervous system activation of beta-adrenergic receptors, as unilateral sympathetic lumbar denervation and a peripherally acting beta-adrenergic antagonist significantly inhibited predator odor-induced muscle thermogenesis. The potential survival value of predator odor-induced changes in muscle physiology is reflected in an enhanced resistance to running fatigue. Lastly, predator odor-induced muscle thermogenesis imparts a meaningful impact on energy expenditure as daily predator odor exposure significantly enhanced weight loss with mild calorie restriction. This evidence signifies contextually provoked, centrally mediated muscle thermogenesis that meaningfully impacts energy balance.",2020,10.1242/jeb.218479,223,8,NA,jeb218479,Energy balance; Energy expenditure; Sympathetic nervous system; Weight loss
article,Scavenging ROS dramatically increase NMDA receptor whole-cell currents in painted turtle cortical neurons,"Dukoff, David James and Hogg, David William and Hawrysh, Peter John and Buck, Leslie Thomas",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Oxygen deprivation triggers excitotoxic cell death in mammal neurons through excessive calcium loading via over-activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors. This does not occur in the western painted turtle, which overwinters for months without oxygen. Neurological damage is avoided through anoxia-mediated decreases in NMDA and AMPA receptor currents that are dependent upon a modest rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ({[}Ca2+](i)) originating from mitochondria. Anoxia also blocks mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which is another potential signaling mechanism to regulate glutamate receptors. To assess the effects of decreased intracellular {[}ROS] on NMDA and AMPA receptor currents, we scavenged ROS with N-2-mercaptopropionylglycine (MPG) or N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Unlike anoxia, ROS scavengers increased NMDA receptor whole-cell currents by 100\%, while hydrogen peroxide decreased currents. AMPA receptor currents and {[}Ca2+](i) concentrations were unaffected by ROS manipulation. Because decreases in {[}ROS] increased NMDA receptor currents, we next asked whether mitochondrial Ca2+ release prevents receptor potentiation during anoxia. Normoxic activation of mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium (mKATP) channels with diazoxide decreased NMDA receptor currents and was unaffected by subsequent ROS scavenging. Diazoxide application following ROS scavenging did not rescue scavenger-mediated increases in NMDA receptor currents. Fluorescent measurement of {[}Ca2+](i) and ROS levels demonstrated that [}Ca2+](i) increases before ROS decreases. We conclude that decreases in ROS concentration are not linked to anoxia-mediated decreases in NMDA/AMPA receptor currents but are rather associated with an increase in NMDA receptor currents that is prevented during anoxia by mitochondrial Ca2+ release.",2014,10.1242/jeb.105825,217,18,3346-3355,NA,Reactive oxidative species; Pyramidal neurons; Whole-cell patch-clamp; Anoxia tolerance; Channel arrest; Calcium; Fluorescence

We investigated the effect of embryonic hypoxia on the cardiovascular phenotype of 4-year-old American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis). We hypothesized that embryonic 10\% O-2 preconditions cardiac function, decreasing the reduction in cardiac contractility associated with acute 5\% O-2 exposure in juvenile alligators. Our findings indicate that dobutamine injections caused a 90\% increase in systolic pressure in juveniles that were incubated in 21\% and 10\% O-2, with the 10\% O-2 group responding with a greater rate of ventricular relaxation and greater left ventricle output compared with the 21\% O-2 group. Further, our findings indicate that juvenile alligators that experienced embryonic hypoxia have a faster rate of ventricular relaxation, greater left ventricle stroke volume and greater cardiac power following beta-adrenergic stimulation, compared with juvenile alligators that did not experience embryonic hypoxia. When juveniles were exposed to 5\% O-2 for 20 min, normoxic-incubated juveniles had a 50\% decline in left ventricle maximal rate of pressure development and maximal pressure; however, these parameters were unaffected and decreased less in the hypoxic-incubated juveniles.

We compared ducks from high-altitude populations in Peru (Lake Titicaca at similar to 3800 m above sea level; Chancay River at similar to 3000-4100 m) with closely related populations or species from low altitude. Hypoxic ventilatory responses were measured shortly after capture at the native altitude. In general, ducks responded to acute hypoxia with robust increases in total ventilation and pulmonary O-2 extraction. O-2 consumption rates were maintained or increased slightly in acute hypoxia, despite similar to 1-2 degrees C reductions in body temperature in most species. Two high-altitude taxa - yellow-billed pintail and torrent duck - exhibited higher total ventilation than their low-altitude counterparts, and yellow-billed pintail exhibited greater increases in pulmonary O-2 extraction in severe hypoxia. In contrast, three other high-altitude taxa Andean ruddy duck, Andean cinnamon teal and speckled teal - had similar or slightly reduced total ventilation and pulmonary O-2 extraction compared with low-altitude relatives. Arterial O-2 saturation (S-aO2) was elevated in yellow-billed pintails atmoderate levels of hypoxia, but there were no differences in S-aO2 in other high-altitude taxa compared with their close relatives. This finding suggests that improvements in S-aO2 in hypoxia can require increases in both breathing and haemoglobin-O-2 affinity, because the yellow-billed pintail was the only high-altitude duck with concurrent increases in both traits compared with its low-altitude relative.

As little is known about EE of arctic stenothermic fishes, we tested the TDEE hypothesis on ventricular myocytes of polar cod (Boreogadus saida) and navaga (Eleginus nawaga) of the Arctic Ocean and those of temperate freshwater burbot (Lota lota). Ventricular action potentials (APs) were elicited in current-clamp experiments at 3, 9 and 15 degrees C, and AP characteristics and the current needed to elicit APs were examined. At 3 degrees C, ventricular APs of polar cod and navaga were similar but differed from those of burbot in having a lower rate of AP upstroke and a higher rate of repolarization. EE of ventricular myocytes - defined as the ease with which all-or-none APs are triggered - was little affected by acute temperature changes between 3 and 15 degrees C in any species. However, AP duration (APD(50)) was drastically reduced at higher temperatures. Elevation of {[}K+](o) from 3 to 5.4 mmol l(-1) and further to 8 mmol l(-1) at 3, 9 and 15 degrees C strongly affected EE and AP characteristics in polar cod and navaga, but had a lesser effect in burbot. In all species, ventricular excitation was resistant to acute temperature elevations, while small increases in {[}K+](o) severely compromised EE, in particular in the marine stenotherms. This suggests that EE of the heart in these Gadiformes species is resistant against acute warming, but less so against the simultaneous temperature and exercise stresses.",2019,10.1242/jeb.193607,222,5,NA,jeb193607,Cardiac action potential; External potassium concentration; Polar cod; Navaga; Burbot; Arctic Ocean

Local and hormonal neuromodulation and sensory inputs into these central pattern generator circuits play a significant role in an animal's response to perturbations, but are usually lost or removed during in vitro studies. To examine simultaneously the in vivo motor output of the crustacean heart and pyloric rhythms, we used photoplethysmography. In the population measured (n=49), the heart rhythm frequency ranged from 0.3 to 2.3 Hz. The pyloric rhythm varied from 0.2 to 1.6 Hz. We observed a weak correlation between the frequencies of the heart and pyloric rhythms. During multiple hour-long recordings, many animals held at a controlled temperature showed strong inhibitory bouts in which the heart decreased in frequency or become quiescent and the pyloric rhythm decreased in frequency. We measured the simultaneous responses of the rhythms to temperature ramps by heating or cooling the saline bath while recording both the heart and pyloric muscle movements.

article,Environmental temperature alters the digestive performance and gut microbiota of a terrestrial amphibian,"Fontaine, Samantha S. and Novarro, Alexander J. and Kohl, Kevin D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Environmental temperature and gut microbial communities can both have profound impacts on the digestive performance of ectothemiic vertebrates. Additionally, the diversity, composition and function of gut microbial communities themselves are influenced by temperature. It is typically assumed that the temperature-dependent nature of ectotherm digestive performance is due to factors such as host physiological changes and adaptation to local climatic conditions. However, it is also possible that temperature-induced alterations to gut microbiota may influence the relationship between temperature and digestion. To explore the connections between these three factors, we compared digestive performance and gut microbial community diversity and composition in red-backed salamanders housed at three experimental temperatures: 10, 15 and 20 degrees C. We also investigated associations between specific bacterial taxa and temperature or salamander digestive performance. We found that salamander digestive performance was greatest at 15 degrees C, while gut microbial diversity was reduced at 20 degrees C. Further, gut microbial community composition differed among the three temperature treatments. The relative abundance of 25 bacterial genera was dependent on temperature, with high temperatures being associated with reductions in the relative abundance of disease-resistant bacteria and increases in pathogenic taxa. The relative abundance of four bacterial genera was correlated with salamander energy assimilation, two of which are known to digest chitin, a main component of the red-backed salamander diet. These findings suggest that gut microbiota may mediate the relationship between temperature and digestion in ectotherms.

M. and van Rijn, Hedderik and Billeter, Jean-Christophe",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature influences the physiology and behavior of all organisms. For ectotherms, which lack central temperature regulation, temperature adaptation requires sheltering from or moving to a heat source. As temperature constrains the rate of metabolic reactions, it can directly affect ectotherm physiology and thus behavioral performance. This direct effect is particularly relevant for insects, as their small bodies readily equilibrate with ambient temperature. In fact, models of enzyme kinetics applied to insect behavior predict performance at different temperatures suggesting that thermal physiology governs behavior. However, insects also possess thermosensory neurons critical for locating preferred temperatures, showing cognitive control. This suggests that temperature-related behavior can emerge directly from a physiological effect, indirectly as a consequence of thermosensory processing, or through a combination of both. To separate the roles of thermal physiology and cognitive control, we developed an arena that allows fast temperature changes in time and space, and in which animals' movements are automatically quantified. We exposed wild-type Drosophila melanogaster and thermosensory receptor mutants to a dynamic temperature environment and tracked their movements. The locomotor speed of wild-type flies closely matched models of enzyme kinetics, but the behavior of thermosensory mutants did not. Mutations in thermosensory receptor gene dTrpA1 (Transient Receptor Potential A1) expressed in the brain resulted in a complete lack of response to temperature changes, while mutations in peripheral thermosensory receptor gene Gr28b(D) resulted in a diminished response. We conclude that flies react to temperature through cognitive control, informed by interactions between various thermosensory neurons, the behavioral output of which resembles models of enzyme kinetics.",2018,10.1242/jeb.174151,221,10,NA,jeb174151,Fruit fly; Thermal performance; Enzyme kinetics; Locomotor activity; Thermosensory receptors

The number of TUNEL-positive cells in the telencephalon increased after 1 day of re-oxygenation following 7 days of anoxia, indicating increased cell death. However, there were no consistent changes in whole-brain expression of caspase 3 in either laboratory-exposed or naturally exposed fish, indicating that cell death might occur via caspase-independent pathways or necrosis. Re-oxygenated crucian carp appeared to have lost the memory of how to navigate in a maze (learnt prior to anoxia exposure), while the ability to learn remained intact.

Meldrum and MacMillan, Heath A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Most insects can acclimate to changes in their thermal environment and counteract temperature effects on neuromuscular function. At the critical thermal minimum, a spreading depolarization (SD) event silences central neurons, but the temperature at which this event occurs can be altered through acclimation. SD is triggered by an inability to maintain ion homeostasis in the extracellular space in the brain and is characterized by a rapid surge in extracellular K+ concentration, implicating ion pump and channel function. Here, we focused on the role of the Na+/K+-ATPase specifically in lowering the SD temperature in cold-acclimated Drosophila melanogaster. After first confirming cold acclimation altered SD onset, we investigated the dependency of the SD event on Na+/K+-ATPase activity by injecting the inhibitor ouabain into the head of the flies to induce SD over a range of temperatures. Latency to SD followed the pattern of a thermal performance curve, but cold acclimation resulted in a left-shift of the curve to an extent similar to its effect on the SD temperature. With Na+/K+-ATPase activity assays and immunoblots, we found that cold-acclimated flies have ion pumps that are less sensitive to temperature, but do not differ in their overall abundance in the brain. Combined, these findings suggest a key role for plasticity in Na+/K+-ATPase thermal sensitivity in maintaining central nervous system function in the cold, and more broadly highlight that a single ion pump can be an important determinant of whether insects can respond to their environment to remain active at low temperatures.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244923,225,24,NA,jeb244923,Critical thermal minimum; Chill coma; Sodium pump; Enzyme kinetics; Ionoregulation; Glia

Here, we investigated the contribution of a proposed strategy for enhancing tissue O-2 extraction - plasma -accessible carbonic anhydrase (CA-IV) - under hypoxia in a species of estuarine fish (red drum, Sciaenops ocellatus) that thrives in fluctuating habitats. We predicted that hypoxia-acclimated fish would increase the prevalence of CA-IV in aerobically demanding tissues to confer more efficient tissue O-2 extraction. Furthermore, we predicted the phenotypic changes to tissue O-2 extraction that occur with hypoxia acclimation may improve respiratory and swim performance under 100\% O-2 conditions (i.e. normoxia) when compared with performance in fish that have not been acclimated to hypoxia. Interestingly, there were no significant differences in relative CA-IV mRNA expression, protein abundance or enzyme activity between the two treatments, suggesting CA-IV function is maintained under hypoxia. Likewise, respiratory performance of hypoxia-acclimated fish was similar to that of control fish when tested in normoxia. Critical swim speed (Licrit) was significantly higher in hypoxia-acclimated fish but translated to marginal ecological benefits with an increase of similar to 0.3 body lengths per second. Instead, hypoxia-acclimated fish may have relied more heavily on anaerobic metabolism during their swim trials, utilizing burst swimming 1.5 times longer than control fish.

Land snails, Helix lucorum, display a wide altitudinal distribution resulting in populations being exposed to different seasonal temperature variations. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of heat shock proteins (Hsps), mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and proteins that are related to apoptosis (Bcl-2, ubiquitin), that have `cytoprotective' roles and are also considered to be reliable indicators of stress because of their crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. These proteins were assessed in H. lucorum individuals from two different populations, one at Axios (sea level, 0 m) and the other at Kokkinopilos (Olympus, 1250 m), as well as after mutual population exchanges, in order to find out whether the different responses of these stress-related proteins depend solely on the environmental temperature. The results showed seasonally altered levels in all studied proteins in the hepatopancreas and foot of snails, both among different populations and between the same populations exposed to varying altitudes.

Here, in exhaustively exercised rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), we assessed the influence of hyperoxia on (M) over dot(O2,max), aerobic scope, cardiac function and blood parameters to address this knowledge gap. Relative to normoxia, (M) over dot(O2,max) was 33\% higher under hyperoxia, and this drove a similar increase in aerobic scope. Cardiac output was significantly elevated under hyperoxia at (M) over dot(O2,max) because of increased stroke volume, indicating that hyperoxia released a constraint on cardiac contractility apparent with normoxia. Thus, hyperoxia improved maximal cardiac performance, thereby enhancing tissue O-2 delivery and allowing a higher (M) over dot(O2,max) Venous blood O-2 partial pressure (PvO(2)) was elevated in hyperoxia at (M) over dot(O2,max), suggesting a contribution of improved luminal O-2 supply in enhanced cardiac contractility. Additionally, despite reduced haemoglobin and higher PvO(2), hyperoxia treated fish retained a higher arterio-venous O-2 content difference at (M) over dot(O2,max). This may have been possible because of hyperoxia offsetting declines in arterial oxygenation that are known to occur following exhaustive exercise in normoxia. If this occurs, increased contractility at (M) over dot(O2,max) with hyperoxia may also relate to an improved O-2 supply to the compact myocardium via the coronary artery. Our findings show (M) over dot(O2,max) and aerobic scope may be limited in normoxia following exhaustive exercise as a result of constrained maximal cardiac performance and highlight the need to further examine whether or not exhaustive exercise protocols are suitable for eliciting (M) over dot(O2,max) and estimating aerobic scope in rainbow trout.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242614,224,15,NA,jeb242614,Aerobic scope; Hyperoxia; Exhaustive exercise; Cardiac output; Oxygen consumption; Cardiorespiratory performance

F. and Hein, Travis W. and Secombes, Christopher J. and Gamperl, A. Kurt",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Interleukin (IL)-1 beta is associated with hypotension and cardiovascular collapse in mammals during heat stroke, and the mRNA expression of this pro-inflammatory cytokine increases dramatically in the blood of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) at high temperatures. These data suggest that release of IL-1 beta at high temperatures negatively impacts fish cardiovascular function and could be a primary determinant of upper thermal tolerance in this taxa. Thus, we measured the concentration-dependent response of isolated steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) coronary microvessels (<150 mu m in diameter) to recombinant (r) IL-1 beta at two temperatures (10 and 20 degrees C). Recombinant IL-1 beta induced a concentration-dependent vasodilation with vessel diameter increasing by approximately 8 and 30\% at 10(-8) and 10(-7) mol l(-1), respectively. However, this effect was not temperature dependent. Both vessel denudation and cyclooxygenase blockade (by indomethacin), but not the nitric oxide (NO) antagonist L-NIO, inhibited the vasodilator effect of rIL-1 beta. In contrast, the concentration-dependent dilation caused by the endothelium-dependent calcium ionophore A23187 was completely abolished by L-NIO and indomethacin, suggesting that both NO and prostaglandin signaling mechanisms exist in the trout coronary microvasculature. These data: (1) are the first to demonstrate a functional link between the immune and cardiovascular systems in fishes; (2) suggest that IL-1 beta release at high temperatures may reduce systemic vascular resistance, and thus, the capacity of fish to maintain blood pressure; and (3) provide evidence that both NO and prostaglandins play a role in regulating coronary vascular tone, and thus, blood flow.",2015,10.1242/jeb.119255,218,14,2269-2278,NA,Vasomotor responses; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Heart; Cytokine; Tone; Vascular resistance
article,Disproportionate role of nuclear-encoded proteins in organismal and mitochondrial thermal performance in a copepod,"Kayhani, Kamron and Barreto, Felipe S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Determining the mechanisms by which organisms evolve thermal tolerance is crucial to predicting how populations may respond to changes in local temperature regimes. Although evidence of relationships between mitochondrial background and thermal adaptation have been found, the presence of both nuclear-encoded and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded proteins warrants experiments aimed at parsing out the relative role of each genome in thermal adaptation. We investigated the relative role of mtDNAencoded products in thermal tolerance between two divergent populations of Tignopus californicus using first-generation (F1) hybrids that vary in maternally inherited mtDNA but are heterozygous for population-specific alleles across nuclear loci. We tested two measures of thermal tolerance, (1) survivorship to acute thermal stress and (2) thermal stability of mitochondrial performance in Complex I-fueled ATP synthesis, both across a range of increasing temperatures. We found that the southern population (San Diego, CA, USA) outperformed the northern population (Strawberry Hill, OR, USA) in survivorship, and that both reciprocal F-1 hybrid crosses had intermediate survival. Mitochondria from the San Diego population displayed greater stability in ATP synthesis with increasing temperatures compared with those from Strawberry Hill. Interestingly, hybrids from both cross directions had synthesis profiles that were very similar to that of Strawberry Hill. Taken together, these results suggest that the relative role of the mtDNA in these phenotypes is negligible compared with that of elements encoded by nuclear DNA in this system.",2023,10.1242/jeb.246085,226,23,NA,jeb246085,KEY WORDS: Mitochondria; Hybridization; Adaptation; Thermal; tolerance
article,Cardiac performance and heat shock response variation related to shell colour morphs in the mudflat snail <i>Batillaria</i> <i>attramentaria</i>,"Han, Guodong and Du, Yinghui and Du, Lina and Qu, Furui and Zhao, Zhenjun",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Gastropods exhibit remarkable variation in shell colour within and among populations, but the function of shell colour is often not clear. In the present study, body temperature in the field and physiological and transcriptomic responses to thermal stress were investigated in different shell colour morphs of the mudflat snail Batillaria attramentaria. Using biomimetic models, we found that the body temperature of snails with a dark unbanded shell (D-type morph) was slightly higher than that of snails with a white line on the upper side of each whorl (UL-type morph) when exposed to sunlight. Despite no differences in upper lethal temperature among shell colour morphs, their Arrhenius breakpoint temperature (ABT) for cardiac thermal performance differed significantly, and the ABT of snails with the D-type morph was higher than that of snails with the UL-type morph. Transcriptomic analysis showed that D-type snails exhibit higher levels of four heat shock proteins (HSPs) than UL-type snails at control temperature. The unfolded protein response was activated in UL-type snails but not in D-type snails under moderate thermal stress. And 11 HSPs showed an increase in UL-type snails in contrast to 1 HSP in D-type snails, suggesting a `preparative defence' strategy of the heat shock response in D-type snails under moderate thermal stress. When exposed to sublethal temperature, eight molecular chaperones were uniquely upregulated in D-type snails, suggesting these genes may allow D-type snails to improve their cardiac thermal tolerance. Our results suggest that the preparative defence strategies and higher ABT for cardiac thermal performance may allow the dark shell snails to adapt to rapid and stronger thermal stress in the field.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244796,225,21,NA,jeb244796,Shell colour polymorphism; Heart rate; Heat shock proteins; Moderate thermal stress; Thermal adaptations

Previous indirect evidence suggested that the kidney, relative to the small gills, may be exceptionally important in ionoregulation and nitrogen (N) waste excretion, with support of kidney function by direct O-2 supply from the airspace. We tested these ideas by continuous urine collection and gill flux measurements in similar to 700 g fish. ATPase activities were many-fold greater in kidney than gills. In normoxia, gill Na+ influx and efflux were in balance, with net losses of Cl- and K+. Urine flow rate (UFR, similar to 11 ml kg(-1) h(-1)) and urinary ions (< 0.2 mmol l(-1)) were exceptional, with [}urine]:{[}plasma] ratios of 0.02-0.002 for K+, Na+, and Cl-, indicating strong reabsorption with negligible urinary ion losses. Urinary {[}ammonia] was very high (10 mmol l(-1), {[}urine]:{[}plasma] similar to 17) indicating strong secretion. The kidney accounted for 21-24\% of N excretion, with ammonia dominating (95\%) over urea-N through both routes. High urinary {[}ammonia] was coupled to high urinary {[}HCO3-]. Aerial hypoxia (15.3 kPa) and aerial hyperoxia (>40.9 kPa) had no effects on UFR, but both inhibited branchial Na+ influx, revealing novel aspects of the osmorespiratory compromise. Aquatic hypoxia (4.1 kPa), but not aquatic hyperoxia (>40.9 kPa), inhibited gill Na+ influx, UFR and branchial and urinary ammonia excretion. We conclude that the kidney is more important than gills in ionoregulation, and is significant in N excretion.

We investigated evolved variation in hypoxia tolerance and the hypoxia acclimation response across fundulid killifishes that naturally experience different patterns of hypoxia exposure. We compared resting O-2 consumption rate ((M)over dot(O2)), and various indices of hypoxia tolerance {[}critical O-2 tension (P-crit), regulation index (RI), O-2 tension (PO2) at loss of equilibrium (P-LOE) and time to LOE (t(LOE)) at 0.6 kPa O-2] in Fundulus confluentus, Fundulus diaphanus, Fundulus heteroclitus, Fundulus rathbuni, Lucania goodei and Lucania parva. We examined the effects of chronic (28 days) exposure to constant hypoxia (2 kPa) or nocturnal intermittent hypoxia (12 h normoxia:12 h hypoxia) in a subset of species. Some species exhibited a two-breakpoint model in (M)over dot(O2) caused by early, modest declines in (M)over dot(O2) in moderate hypoxia. We found that hypoxia tolerance varied appreciably across species: F. confluentus was the most tolerant (lowest P-LOE and P-crit, longest t(LOE)), whereas F. rathbuni and F. diaphanus were the least tolerant. However, there was not a consistent pattern of interspecific variation for different indices of hypoxia tolerance, with or without taking phylogenetic relatedness into account, probably because these different indices are underlain by partially distinct mechanisms. Hypoxia acclimation generally improved hypoxia tolerance, but the magnitude of plasticity and responsiveness to different hypoxia patterns varied interspecifically. Our results therefore suggest that hypoxia tolerance is a complex trait that is best appreciated by considering multiple indices of tolerance.",2020,10.1242/jeb.209692,223,4,NA,jeb209692,Hypoxia resistance; Evolutionary physiology; Phylogenetically independent contrasts; Respirometry; Diurnal hypoxia
article,Developmental delay in shivering limits thermogenic capacity in juvenile high-altitude deer mice (<i>Peromyscus maniculatus</i>),"Robertson, Cayleih E. and McClelland, Grant B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Many endotherms native to cold and hypoxic high-altitude (HA) environments have evolved a highly vascularized and aerobic skeletal muscle. This specialized muscle phenotype contributes via shivering to an enhanced capacity for aerobic thermogenesis (cold-induced <(V) over dot>(O2,max)). However, it is unclear how selection at HA for shivering thermogenesis acts early in the development of small altricial mammals, which are born with immature skeletal muscles and without the capacity for homeothermic endothermy. We have previously shown that postnatal maturation of brown adipose tissue and non-shivering thermogenesis is delayed in HA native deer mouse pups (Peromyscus maniculatus). To assess whether HA adaptation has also altered the developmental program of skeletal muscle and shivering thermogenesis, we used laboratory-reared descendants of deer mice native to low altitude (LA, 430 m a.s.l.) and HA (4350 m a.s.l.) and a LA congeneric outgroup (P. leucopus). We found that LA juveniles were able to shiver robustly at 2 weeks after birth. However, HA juveniles were unlikely able to shiver at this point, resulting in a 30\% lower capacity for thermoregulation compared with lowlanders. It was only at 27 days after birth that HA juveniles had established the aerobic muscle phenotype characteristic of HA adults and a superior cold-induced <(V) over dot>(O2,max) compared with LA mice of the same age. The capacity for shivering may be delayed in HA mice to allow energy to be allocated to other important processes such as growth.",2019,10.1242/jeb.210963,222,21,NA,jeb210963,Muscle development; Thermogenesis; Metabolism; Endothermy
article,Effect of temperature and food restriction on immune function in striped hamsters (<i>Cricetulus barabensis</i>),"Xu, De-Li and Hu, Xiao-Kai and Tian, Yu-Fen",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Small mammals in temperate areas face seasonal fluctuations of temperature and food availability, both of which may influence their immune responses, which are critical to survival. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that low temperature and food restriction suppress immune function in striped hamsters (Cricetulus barabensis). Thirty-seven adult male hamsters were randomly assigned to warm (23 +/- 1 degrees C) and cold (5 +/- 1 degrees C) treatment groups, which were further divided into fed and food-restricted groups. Body mass was not affected by cold stress, food restriction or the interaction cold stressxfood restriction. Cold stress decreased total body fat mass, haematological parameters including white blood cells, lymphocytes and neutrophilic granulocytes, and immunoglobin (Ig) M titres 5 days after injecting keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH). However, cold temperature increased bacterial killing capacity, indicative of innate immunity, and did not affect the mass of the thymus and spleen, intermediate granulocytes, the phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) response and the levels of blood glucose and serum leptin. Corticosterone concentration was affected significantly by the interaction cold stressxfood restriction but not by cold stress or food restriction alone. Food restriction reduced thymus mass, but other immunological parameters including body fat mass, spleen mass, haematological parameters. innate immunity, PHA response, the titres of IgM and IgG, and the levels of blood glucose and serum leptin were all not affected by food restriction or the interaction cold stressxfood restriction. Innate immunity was positively correlated with leptin levels, whereas no significant correlations were observed in the levels of blood glucose, serum leptin, corticosterone and all the detected immune parameters. Our results show that cold stress suppressed humoral immunity but enhanced innate immunity and did not affect cellular immunity in striped hamsters. Most immunological indices were not influenced by food restriction. Blood glucose, leptin and corticosterone could not explain the changes of innate, cellular and humoral immunity upon cold stress or food restriction in striped hamsters.",2017,10.1242/jeb.153601,220,12,2187-2195,NA,Corticosterone; Humoral immunity; Leptin; Phytohaemagglutinin response; Innate immunity
article,Cold acclimation increases cardiac myofilament function and ventricular pressure generation in trout,"Klaiman, Jordan M. and Pyle, W. Glen and Gillis, Todd E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Reducing temperature below the optimum of most vertebrate hearts impairs contractility and reduces organ function. However, a number of fish species, including the rainbow trout, can seasonally acclimate to low temperature. Such ability requires modification of physiological systems to compensate for the thermodynamic effects of temperature on biological processes. The current study tested the hypothesis that rainbow trout compensate for the direct effect of cold temperature by increasing cardiac contractility during cold acclimation. We examined cardiac contractility, following thermal acclimation (4, 11 and 17 degrees C), by measuring the Ca2+ sensitivity of force generation by chemically skinned cardiac trabeculae as well as ventricular pressure generation using a modified Langendorff preparation. We demonstrate, for the first time, that the Ca2+ sensitivity of force generation was significantly higher in cardiac trabeculae from 4 degrees C-acclimated trout compared with those acclimated to 11 or 17 degrees C, and that this functional change occurred in parallel with a decrease in the level of cardiac troponin T phosphorylation. In addition, we show that the magnitude and rate of ventricular pressure generation was greater in hearts from trout acclimated to 4 degrees C compared with those from animals acclimated to 11 or 17 degrees C. Taken together, these results suggest that enhanced myofilament function, caused by modification of existing contractile proteins, is at least partially responsible for the observed increase in pressure generation after acclimation to 4 degrees C. In addition, by examining the phenotypic plasticity of a comparative model we have identified a strategy, used in vivo, by which the force-generating capacity of cardiac muscle can be increased.",2014,10.1242/jeb.109041,217,23,4132-4140,NA,Calcium sensitivity; Cardiac contractility; Protein phosphorylation; Thermal acclimation
article,Physiological basis of starvation resistance in <i>Drosophila leontia</i>: analysis of sexual dimorphism,"Aggarwal, Dau Dayal",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Geographically varying starvation stress has often been considered as a natural selector that constrains between-population differences for starvation resistance (SR) in Drosophila species. On the Indian subcontinent, a dozen Drosophila species have shown clinal variations in SR across latitude, but the evolved physiological basis of such contrasting adaptations is largely unknown. In the present study, I untangled the physiological basis of sex-specific as well as between-population divergence for SR in D. leontia, collected across a latitudinal transect of the Indian subcontinent (11 degrees 45'- 31 degrees 19'N). Secondly, I tested the assumptions that hardening to starvation stress facilitates an increased survival under subsequent lethal levels of starvation, and such plastic effects differ between the sexes. I observed several interesting results. In contrast to a steeper cline of starvation-related traits with latitude in females, a shallower gradient was observed for males. Females stored higher (similar to 1.3-fold) dry-mass-specific levels of body lipids and glycogen contents, and utilized these both of these energy resources under starvation stress, whereas the starved males metabolized only body lipids as a source of energy. Conversely, the rate of body lipid utilization and threshold need were considerably higher in females as compared with males. Between-population differences were significant for storage levels of energy reserves only, but not for other avenues (rate of metabolite utilization and threshold need) of SR for both sexes. These findings indicate that multiple pathways shape the physiological basis of sexual dimorphism for SR in D. leontia. Further, single or multiple bouts of starvation hardening conferred an increased longevity (similar to 4-9 h; P<0.001) under subsequent lethal levels of starvation stress for females only, and such plastic responses were consistent with a decrease in rate of metabolite utilization. Nevertheless, between-population effects were non-significant for absolute hardening capacity (AHC=K-SR-C). Altogether, these findings suggest that similar evolutionary constraints have resulted in divergent genetic as well as plastic responses to evolve adaptations under starvation stress, and account for the observed sexual dimorphism for basal SR in D. leontia.",2014,10.1242/jeb.096792,217,11,1849-1859,NA,Starvation resistance; Sexual dimorphism; Energy metabolites; Starvation hardening; D. leontia
article,The response of the scleractinian coral <i>Turbinaria reniformis</i> to thermal stress depends on the nitrogen status of the coral holobiont,"Beraud, Eric and Gevaert, Francois and Rottier, Cecile and Ferrier-Pages, Christine",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The physiological response of the scleractinian coral Turbinaria reniformis to ammonium enrichment (3 mu mol l(-1)) was examined at 26 degrees C as well as during a 7 day increase in temperature to 31 degrees C (thermal stress). At 26 degrees C, ammonium supplementation had little effect on the coral physiology. It induced a decrease in symbiont density, compensated by an increase in chlorophyll content per symbiont cell. Organic carbon release was reduced, likely because of a better utilization of the photosynthesized carbon (i.e. incorporation into proteins, kept in the coral tissue). The delta N-15 signatures of the ammonium-enriched symbionts and host tissue were also significantly decreased, by 4 and 2 parts per thousand, respectively, compared with the non-enriched conditions, suggesting a significant uptake of inorganic nitrogen by the holobiont. Under thermal stress, coral colonies that were not nitrogen enriched experienced a drastic decrease in photosynthetic and photoprotective pigments (chlorophyll a, beta-carotene, diadinoxanthin, diatoxanthin and peridinin), followed by a decrease in the rates of photosynthesis and calcification. Organic carbon release was not affected by this thermal stress. Conversely, nitrogen-enriched corals showed an increase in their pigment concentrations, and maintained rates of photosynthesis and calcification at ca. 60\% and 100\% of those measured under control conditions, respectively. However, these corals lost more organic carbon into the environment. Overall, these results indicate that inorganic nitrogen availability can be important to determining the resilience of some scleractinian coral species to thermal stress, and can have a function equivalent to that of heterotrophic feeding concerning the maintenance of coral metabolism under stress conditions.",2013,10.1242/jeb.085183,216,14,2665-2674,NA,coral; nitrogen; symbiosis; temperature

To reduce this risk, some species perform group air breathing. Temperature may also affect the frequency of air breathing in fishes, but this topic has received relatively little research attention. This study examined how acclimation temperature and acute exposure to hypoxia affected the air-breathing behaviour of a social catfish, the bronze corydoras Corydoras aeneus, and aimed to determine whether individual oxygen demand influenced the behaviour of entire groups. Groups of seven fish were observed in an arena to measure air-breathing frequency of individuals and consequent group air-breathing behaviour, under three oxygen concentrations (100\%, 60\% and 20\% air saturation) and two acclimation temperatures (25 and 30 degrees C). Intermittent flow respirometry was used to estimate oxygen demand of individuals. Increasingly severe hypoxia increased air breathing at the individual and group levels. Although there were minimal differences in air-breathing frequency among individuals in response to an increase in temperature, the effect of temperature that did exist manifested as an increase in group air-breathing frequency at 30 degrees C. Groups that were more socially cohesive during routine activity took more breaths but, in most cases, air breathing among individuals was not temporally clustered. There was no association between an individual's oxygen demand and its air-breathing frequency in a group. For C. aeneus, although air-breathing frequency is influenced by hypoxia, behavioural variation among groups could explain the small overall effect of temperature on group air-breathing frequency.",2020,10.1242/jeb.222133,223,21,NA,jeb222133,Air-breathing fish; Environmental stress; Metabolic rate; Oxygen; Social behaviour
article,Hypoxia acclimation alters reactive oxygen species homeostasis and oxidative status in estuarine killifish (<i>Fundulus heteroclitus</i>),"Borowiec, Brittney G. and Scott, Graham R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Hypoxia is common in aquatic environments, and exposure to hypoxia followed by re-oxygenation is often believed to induce oxidative stress. However, there have been relatively few studies of reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis and oxidative status in fish that experience natural hypoxia-re-oxygenation cycles. We examined how exposure to acute hypoxia (2 kPa O-2) and subsequent re-oxygenation (to 20 kPa O-2) affects redox status, oxidative damage and anti-oxidant defenses in estuarine killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus), and whether these effects were ameliorated or potentiated by prolonged (28 days) acclimation to either constant hypoxia or intermittent cycles of nocturnal hypoxia (12 h:12 h normoxia:hypoxia). Acute hypoxia and re-oxygenation led to some modest and transient changes in redox status, increases in oxidized glutathione, depletion of scavenging capacity and oxidative damage to lipids in skeletal muscle. The liver had greater scavenging capacity, total glutathione concentrations and activities of anti-oxidant enzymes (catalase, glutathione peroxidase) than muscle, and generally experienced less variation in glutathiones and lipid peroxidation. Unexpectedly, acclimation to constant hypoxia or intermittent hypoxia led to a more oxidizing redox status (muscle and liver) and it increased oxidized glutathione (muscle). However, hypoxia-acclimated fish exhibited little to no oxidative damage (as reflected by lipid peroxidation and aconitase activity), in association with improvements in scavenging capacity and catalase activity in muscle. We conclude that hypoxia acclimation leads to adjustments in ROS homeostasis and oxidative status that do not reflect oxidative stress, but may instead be part of the suite of responses that killifish use to cope with chronic hypoxia.",2020,10.1242/jeb.222877,223,13,NA,jeb222877,Anti-oxidants; Diel cycles; Oxidative stress; Redox; Re-oxygenation; ROS

However, how the brains of these subterranean mammals handle acute in vivo hypoxia is poorly understood. This study is the first to examine the molecular response to low oxygen in six different species of hypoxia-tolerant mole-rats from sub-Saharan Africa. Protein carbonylation, a known marker of DNA damage (hydroxy2'-deoxyguanosine), and antioxidant capacity did not change following hypoxia but HIF-1 protein levels increased significantly in the brains of two species. Nearly 30 miRNAs known to play roles in hypoxia tolerance were differentially regulated in a species-specific manner. The miRNAs exhibiting the strongest response to low oxygen stress inhibit apoptosis and regulate neuroinflammation, likely providing neuroprotection. A principal component analysis (PCA) using a subset of the molecular targets assessed herein revealed differences between control and hypoxic groups for two solitary species (Georychus capensis and Bathyergus suillus), which are ecologically adapted to a normoxic environment, suggesting a heightened sensitivity to hypoxia relative to species that may experience hypoxia more regularly in nature. By contrast, all molecular data were included in the PCA to detect a difference between control and hypoxic populations of eusocial Heterocephalus glaber, indicating they may require many lower-fold changes in signaling pathways to adapt to low oxygen settings. Finally, none of the Cryptomys hottentotus subspecies showed a statistical difference between control and hypoxic groups, presumably due to hypoxia tolerance derived from environmental pressures associated with a subterranean and social lifestyle.",2020,10.1242/jeb.215905,223,9,NA,jeb215905,Hypoxia tolerance; Protein oxidation; DNA damage; HIF-1 alpha; miRNA; Bathyergidae

In the present study, we asked whether these traits would also be present in response to hypoxia at sea level. To answer this question, we exposed rats (Sprague Dawley) and mice (FVB) to normoxia (21\% O-2) or hypoxia (15 and 12\% O-2) for 6 h and measured ventilation and metabolic rate (whole-body plethysmography), and expression of the transcription factor HIF-1 alpha (ELISA and mass spectrometry) and other proteins whose expression are regulated by hypoxia (glucose transporter 1, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 and angiopoietin 2; mass spectrometry) in the brainstem. In response to hypoxia, compared with rats, mice had higher minute ventilation, lower metabolic rate and higher expression of HIF-1 alpha in the brainstem. In mice, the expression level of HIF-1 alpha was positively correlated with ventilation and negatively correlated with metabolic rate. In rats, the concentration of brainstem cytosolic protein decreased by 38\% at 12\% O-2, while expression of the glucose transporter 1 increased.

F. and Gargaglioni, Luciane H. and Bicego, Kenia C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Anurans regulate short-term oscillations in blood pressure through changes in heart rate (f(H)), vascular resistance and lymphatic f(H). Lung ventilation in anurans is linked to blood volume homeostasis by facilitating lymph return to the cardiovascular system. We hypothesized that the arterial baroreflex modulates pulmonary ventilation in the cururu toad Rhinella schneideri, and that this relationship is temperature dependent. Pharmacologically induced hypotension (sodium nitroprusside) and hypertension (phenylephrine) increased ventilation (25 degrees C: 248.7 +/- 25.7 ml kg(-1) min(-1); 35 degrees C: 351.5 +/- 50.2 ml kg(-1) min(-1)) and decreased ventilation (25 degrees C: 9.0 +/- 6.6 ml kg(-1) min(-1); 35 degrees C: 50.7 +/- 15.6 ml kg(-1) min(-1)), respectively, relative to control values from Ringer solution injection (25 degrees C: 78.1 +/- 17.0 ml kg(-1) min(-1); 35 degrees C: 137.7 +/- 15.5 ml kg(-1) min(-1)). The sensitivity of the ventilatory response to blood pressure changes was higher during hypotension than during hypertension {[}25 degrees C: -97.6 +/- 17.1 versus -23.6 +/- 6.0 breaths min(-1) kPa(-1); 35 degrees C: -141.0 +/- 29.5 versus -28.7 +/- 6.4 breaths min(-1) kPa(-1), respectively; negative values indicate an inverse relationship between blood pressure and ventilation (or breathing frequency), i.e. as blood pressure increases, ventilation decreases, and vice versa], while temperature had no effect on these sensitivities. Hyperoxia (30\%; 25 degrees C) diminished ventilation, but did not abolish the ventilatory response to hypotension, indicating a response independent of peripheral chemoreceptors. Although there are previous data showing increased f(H) baroreflex sensitivity from 15 to 30 degrees C in this species, further increases in temperature (35 degrees C) diminished fH baroreflex gain (40.5 +/- 5.62 versus 21.6 +/- 4.64\% kPa(-1)). Therefore, besides an involvement of pulmonary ventilation in matching O-2 delivery to demand at higher temperatures in anurans, it also plays a role in blood pressure regulation, independent of temperature, possibly owing to an interaction between baroreflex and respiratory areas in the brain, as previously suggested for mammals.",2016,10.1242/jeb.144774,219,22,3605-3615,NA,Baroreceptors; Chemoreceptors; Lung ventilation; Hyperoxia; Autonomic blockade; Anuran amphibians
article,Bioenergetic and volume regulatory effects of mitoK<sub>ATP</sub> channel modulators protect against hypoxia-reoxygenation-induced mitochondrial dysfunction,"Onukwufor, John O. and Stevens, Don and Kamunde, Collins",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ (mitoK(ATP)) channel plays a significant role in mitochondrial physiology and protects against ischemic reperfusion injury in mammals. Although fish frequently face oxygen fluctuations in their environment, the role of the mitoK(ATP) channel in regulating the responses to oxygen stress is rarely investigated in this class of animals. To elucidate whether and how the mitoK(ATP) channel protects against hypoxia-reoxygenation (H-R)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in fish, we first determined the mitochondrial bioenergetic effects of two key modulators of the channel, diazoxide and 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD), using a wide range of doses. Subsequently, the effects of low and high doses of the modulators on mitochondrial bioenergetics and volume under normoxia and after H-R using buffers with and without magnesium and ATP (Mg-ATP) were tested. In the absence of Mg-ATP (mitoK(ATP) channel open), both low and high doses of diazoxide improved mitochondrial coupling, but only the high dose of 5-HD reversed the post-H-R coupling-enhancing effect of diazoxide. In the presence of Mg-ATP (mitoK(ATP) channel closed), diazoxide at the low dose improved coupling post-H-R, and this effect was abolished by 5-HD at the low dose. Interestingly, both low and high doses of diazoxide reversed H-R-induced swelling under mitoK(ATP) channel open conditions, but this effect was not sensitive to 5-HD. Under mitoK(ATP) channel closed conditions, diazoxide at the low dose protected the mitochondria from H-R-induced swelling and 5-HD at the low dose reversed this effect. In contrast, diazoxide at the high dose failed to reduce the swelling caused by H-R, and the addition of the high dose of 5-HD enhanced mitochondrial swelling. Overall, our study showed that in the presence of Mg-ATP, both opening of mitoK(ATP) channels and bioenergetic effects of diazoxide were protective against H-R in fish mitochondria, while in the absence of Mg-ATP only the bioenergetic effect of diazoxide was protective.",2016,10.1242/jeb.140186,219,17,2743-2751,NA,Mitochondrial bioenergetics; Volume regulation; Swelling; Diazoxide; 5-Hydroxydecanoate

For these experiments, we used fish derived from a refuge population of Devils Hole pupfish (Cyprinodon diabolis). Measurement of routine oxygen consumption ((V)over dotO(2), routine) revealed some 33 degrees C-acclimated fish (10\% of 295 assayed fish) periodically exhibited periods of no measurable oxygen consumption despite available ambient oxygen tensions that were above the critical PO2. We call this phenomenon paradoxical anaerobism. The longest observed continuous bout with no oxygen consumption was 149 min, although typical bouts were much shorter. Fish maintained normal posture and ventilation rate (>230 ventilations per minute) during paradoxical anaerobism. Fish rarely demonstrated a compensatory increase in oxygen use following a period of paradoxical anaerobism. In contrast, only one out of 262 sampled fish acclimated at 28 degrees C spontaneously demonstrated paradoxical anaerobism. Muscle lactate concentration was not elevated during periods of paradoxical anaerobism. However, the amount of ethanol released by the 33 degrees C-acclimated fish was 7.3 times greater than that released by the 28 degrees C acclimation group, suggesting ethanol may be used as an alternative end product of anaerobic metabolism. Exposure to exogenous ethanol, in concentrations as low as 0.1\%, produced periods of paradoxical anaerobism even in 28 degrees C acclimated fish.",2015,10.1242/jeb.130633,218,23,3739-3745,NA,Oxygen consumption; Thermal acclimation; Cyprinodon
article,Acute cold and exercise training up-regulate similar aspects of fatty acid transport and catabolism in house sparrows (<i>Passer domesticus</i>),"Zhang, Yufeng and Carter, Travis and Eyster, Kathleen and Swanson, David L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Summit maximum thermoregulatory metabolic rate (M-sum) and maximum exercise metabolic rate (MMR) both increase in response to acute cold or exercise training in birds. Because lipids are the main fuel supporting both thermogenesis and exercise in birds, adjustments to lipid transport and catabolic capacities may support elevated energy demands from cold and exercise training. To examine a potential mechanistic role for lipid transport and catabolism in organismal cross-training effects (exercise effects on both exercise and thermogenesis, and vice versa), we measured enzyme activities and mRNA and protein expression in pectoralis muscle for several key steps of lipid transport and catabolism pathways in house sparrows (Passer domesticus) during acute exercise and cold training. Both training protocols elevated pectoralis protein levels of fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36), cytosolic fatty acid-binding protein, and citrate synthase (CS) activity. However, mRNA expression of FAT/CD36 and both mRNA and protein expression of plasma membrane fatty acid-binding protein did not change for either training group. CS activities in supracoracoideus, leg and heart, and carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT) and beta-hydroxyacyl CoA-dehydrogenase activities in all muscles did not vary significantly with either training protocol. Both M-sum and MMR were significantly positively correlated with CPT and CS activities. These data suggest that up-regulation of trans-sarcolemmal and intramyocyte lipid transport capacities and cellular metabolic intensities, along with previously documented increases in body and pectoralis muscle masses and pectoralis myostatin (a muscle growth inhibitor) levels, are common mechanisms underlying the training effects of both exercise and shivering in birds.",2015,10.1242/jeb.126128,218,24,3885-3893,NA,Phenotypic flexibility; Cold training; Exercise training; Fatty acid translocase; Fatty acid binding protein; Carnitine palmitoyl transferase; Citrate synthase; beta-Hydroxyacyl CoA-dehydrogenase

The purpose of the present study was to determine how cold acclimation affects zebrafish (Danio rerio) cardiac morphology, collagen composition and connective tissue regulation. Heart volume, the thickness of the compact myocardium, collagen content and collagen fiber composition were compared between control (27 degrees C) and cold-acclimated (20 degrees C) zebrafish using serially sectioned hearts stained with Picrosirius Red. Collagen content and fiber composition of the pericardial membrane were also examined. Cold acclimation did not affect the volume of the contracted heart; however, there was a significant decrease in the thickness of the compact myocardium. There was also a decrease in the collagen content of the compact myocardium and in the amount of thick collagen fibers throughout the heart. Cold-acclimated zebrafish also increased expression of the gene transcript for matrix metalloproteinase 2, matrix metalloproteinase 9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 and collagen Type I alpha 1. We propose that the reduction in the thickness of the compact myocardium as well as the change in collagen content may help to maintain the compliance of the ventricle as temperatures decrease.

article,Finding the best estimates of metabolic rates in a coral reef fish,"Roche, Dominique G. and Binning, Sandra A. and Bosiger, Yoland and Johansen, Jacob L. and Rummer, Jodie L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Metabolic rates of aquatic organisms are estimated from measurements of oxygen consumption rates (M-O2) through swimming and resting respirometry. These distinct approaches are increasingly used in ecophysiology and conservation physiology studies; however, few studies have tested whether they yield comparable results. We examined whether two fundamental M-O2 measures, standard metabolic rate (SMR) and maximum metabolic rate (MMR), vary based on the method employed. Ten bridled monocle bream (Scolopsis bilineata) were exercised using (1) a critical swimming speed (U-crit) protocol, (2) a 15. min exhaustive chase protocol and (3) a 3. min exhaustive chase protocol followed by brief (1. min) air exposure. Protocol 1 was performed in a swimming respirometer whereas protocols 2 and 3 were followed by resting respirometry. SMR estimates in swimming respirometry were similar to those in resting respirometry when a three-parameter exponential or power function was used to extrapolate the swimming speed-M-O2 relationship to zero swimming speed. In contrast, MMR using the U-crit protocol was 36\% higher than MMR derived from the 15. min chase protocol and 23\% higher than MMR using the 3. min chase/1. min air exposure protocol. For strong steady (endurance) swimmers, such as S. bilineata, swimming respirometry can produce more accurate MMR estimates than exhaustive chase protocols because oxygen consumption is measured during exertion. However, when swimming respirometry is impractical, exhaustive chase protocols should be supplemented with brief air exposure to improve measurement accuracy. Caution is warranted when comparing MMR estimates obtained with different respirometry methods unless they are cross-validated on a species-specific basis.",2013,10.1242/jeb.082925,216,11,2103-2110,NA,ecophysiology; oxygen consumption rate; maximum metabolic rate; standard metabolic rate; critical swimming speed; respirometry

Given their phylogenetic relationship and similar lifestyles, we hypothesized that the signalling mechanisms underlying physiological responses to acute hypoxia in Damaraland mole-rats are like those of naked mole-rats. To test this, we used pharmacological antagonists of glutamatergic alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), combined with plethysmography, respirometry and thermal RFID chips, to non-invasively evaluate the role of excitatory AMPAR and NMDAR signalling in mediating ventilatory, metabolic and thermoregulatory responses, respectively, to 1 h of 5 or 7\% O2. We found that AMPAR or NMDAR antagonism have minimal impacts on the HMR or hypoxia-mediated changes in thermoregulation. Conversely, the `blunted' HVR of Damaraland mole-rats is reduced by either AMPAR or NMDAR antagonism such that the onset of the HVR occurs in less severe hypoxia. In more severe hypoxia, antagonists have no impact, suggesting that these receptors are already inhibited. Together, these findings indicate that the glutamatergic drive to breathe decreases in Damaraland mole-rats exposed to severe hypoxia.

article,Responses of the<i> in</i><i> vitro</i> turtle brain to visual and auditory stimuli during severe hypoxia,"Ariel, Michael and Ahuja, Shivika and Warren, Daniel E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"North American pond turtles (Emydidae) are renowned for their ability to survive extreme hypoxia and anoxia, which enables several species to overwinter in ice-locked, anoxic freshwater ponds and bogs for months. Centrally important for surviving these conditions is a profound metabolic suppression, which enables ATP demands to be met entirely with glycolysis. To better understand whether anoxia limits special sensory functions, we recorded evoked potentials in a reduced brain preparation, in vitro, that was perfused with severely hypoxic artificial cerebral spinal fluid (aCSF). For recordings of visual responses, an LED was flashed onto retinal eyecups while evoked potentials were recorded from the retina or the optic tectum. For recordings of auditory responses, a piezomotor-controlled glass actuator displaced the tympanic membrane while evoked potentials were recorded from the cochlear nuclei. We found that visual responses decreased when perfused with hypoxic perfusate (aCSF PO2<4.0 kPa). In contrast, the evoked response within the cochlear nuclei was unattenuated. These data provide further support that pond turtles have a limited ability to sense visual information in their environment even while moderately hypoxic, but that auditory input may become a principal avenue of sensory perception during extreme diving in this species such as occurs during anoxic submergence.",2023,10.1242/jeb.244687,226,7,NA,jeb244687,Anoxia; Sensory field potentials; Electroretinograms; Optic tectum; Eighth cranial nerve; Tympanic membrane
article,High temperature impairs mitochondrial function in rainbow trout cardiac mitochondria,"Michaelsen, Jakob and Fago, Angela and Bundgaard, Amanda",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Mitochondria provide cellular energy through oxidative phosphorylation, and thus temperature-induced constraints on mitochondrial function may be crucial to animal aerobic scope and thermal tolerance. Here, we report the effect of temperature in the range 5-30 degrees C on respiration rates of isolated cardiac mitochondria from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) studied by high-resolution respirometry and spectrophotometric enzyme activity assays. Arrhenius breakpoint temperature analysis indicated that mitochondrial respiration rates under phosphorylating and fully uncoupled conditions increased exponentially up to 20 degrees C, but stopped increasing at higher temperatures. In contrast, respiration rates measured under non-phosphorylating leak conditions continued to increase up to 30 degrees C. The decrease in the ratio between phosphorylating and uncoupled respiration at high temperature indicated that phosphorylation was gradually impaired with increasing temperature, possibly because of the steadily increasing proton leak across the membrane. In addition, we found that complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) activity decreased above 20 degrees C, similarly to mitochondrial respiration, and that complex I was unstable in the presence of detergents, suggesting that it may be particularly sensitive to changes in its interaction with membrane phospholipids. In contrast, complex II (succinate dehydrogenase) maintained activity at temperatures above 20 degrees C, although succinate oxidation was insufficient to compensate for the loss of complex I activity in intact mitochondria. Together, these results indicate that the temperature-induced decrease in cardiac mitochondrial function coincides with the temperature at which trout aerobic scope peaks, and is largely due to impaired phosphorylation and complex I activity.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242382,224,9,NA,jeb242382,Complex I; Fish; Heart; Mitochondria; Respiration; Temperature
article,Evidence for a rapid cold hardening response in cultured <i>Drosophila</i> S2 cells,"Nadeau, Emily A.

To cope with sudden drops in temperature, insects and other ectotherms are capable of rapid cold hardening (RCH), in which mild chilling significantly enhances cold tolerance within minutes. While the ecological significance of RCH is well established, the mechanisms underlying RCH are still poorly understood. Previous work has demonstrated that RCH is regulated at the cellular level by post-translational signaling mechanisms, and here we tested the hypothesis that cultured cells are capable of RCH. A 2 h cold shock at -8 degrees C significantly reduced the metabolic viability of Drosophila S2 cells, but pre-treatment with RCH at 4 degrees C for 2 h prevented this decrease in viability. Thus, S2 cells are capable of RCH in a similar manner to whole insects and provide a new system for investigating the cell biology of RCH.",2020,10.1242/jeb.212613,223,2,NA,jeb212613,Environmental stress; Cold tolerance; Cell culture; Phenotypic plasticity

Yet, morph-specific costs and benefits related to different life-history strategies remain unclear. Here, we examined in the polymorphic Gouldian finch (Erythrura gouldiae) whether markers of somatic maintenance (body mass, oxidative status and telomere length) differed between red- and black-headed birds under energetically demanding conditions (during heatwaves of different intensity, and during moult or breeding following heatwaves). During heatwaves, red-headed birds showed a homogeneous response, as males and females initially tended to gain mass and had reduced plasma hydroperoxide levels (a marker of oxidative damage) irrespective of heatwave intensity. In contrast, black-headed birds showed a stronger andmore heterogeneous response, as black-headed males gained mass at the beginning of the thermoneutral heatwave and showed stable oxidative status, whereas black-headed females lost mass and tended to show higher hydroperoxide levels at the end of the thermocritical heatwave. Following heatwaves, we found morph-specific oxidative costs owing to moult or reproduction, with oxidative markers varying only in black-headed birds. Again, oxidative markers varied differently in black-headed males and females, as plasma antioxidant capacity decreased inmoulting or breeding females, whereasmales showed higher hydroperoxide levels with larger broods. For the first time, our study highlights that within polymorphic species, some individuals appearmore vulnerable than others when coping with energetically demanding conditions.

We compared heart and brain mitochondrial responses to acute thermal challenges and to thermal acclimation using high-resolution respirometry in two locally adapted subspecies of Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus). We predicted that 5 degrees C acclimation would result in compensatory increases in mitochondrial performance, while 33 degrees C acclimation would cause suppression of mitochondrial function to minimize the effects of high temperature on mitochondrial metabolism. In contrast, acclimation to both 33 and 5 degrees C decreased mitochondrial performance compared with fish acclimated to 15 degrees C. These adjustments could represent an energetic cost-saving mechanism at temperature extremes. Acclimation responses were similar in both heart and brain; however, this effect was smaller in the heart, which might indicate its importance in maintaining whole-animal thermal performance. Alternatively, larger acclimation effects in the brain might indicate greater thermal sensitivity compared with the heart. We detected only modest differences between subspecies that were dependent on the tissue assayed. These data demonstrate extensive plasticity in mitochondrial performance following thermal acclimation in killifish, and indicate that the extent of these responses differs between tissues, highlighting the importance and complexity of mitochondrial regulation in thermal acclimation in eurytherms.",2017,10.1242/jeb.151217,220,8,1459-1471,NA,Killifish; Thermal performance; Oxidative phosphorylation; Local adaptation; Temperature; Fish
article,Regulation of succinate-fuelled mitochondrial respiration in liver and skeletal muscle of hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels,"Brown, Jason C. L. and Chung, Dillon J. and Cooper, Alex N. and Staples, James F.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Hibernating ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) alternate between two distinct metabolic states throughout winter: torpor, during which metabolic rate (MR) and body temperature (T-b) are considerably suppressed, and interbout euthermia (IBE), during which MR and T-b briefly return to euthermic levels. Previous studies showed suppression of succinate-fuelled respiration during torpor in liver and skeletal muscle mitochondria; however, these studies used only a single, saturating succinate concentration. Therefore, they could not address whether mitochondrial metabolic suppression occurs under physiological substrate concentrations or whether differences in the kinetics of mitochondrial responses to changing substrate concentration might also contribute to mitochondrial metabolic regulation during torpor. The present study confirmed that succinate oxidation is reduced during torpor in liver and skeletal muscle at 37 and 10 degrees C over a 100-fold range of succinate concentrations. At 37 degrees C, this suppression resulted from inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which had a greater affinity for oxaloacetate (an SDH inhibitor) during torpor. At 10 degrees C, SDH was not inhibited, suggesting that SDH inhibition initiates but does not maintain mitochondrial suppression during torpor. Moreover, in both liver and skeletal muscle, mitochondria from torpid animals maintained relatively higher respiration rates at low succinate concentrations, which reduces the extent of energy savings that can be achieved during torpor, but may also maintain mitochondrial oxidative capacity above some lower critical threshold, thereby preventing cellular and/or mitochondrial injury during torpor and facilitating rapid recruitment of oxidative capacity during arousal.",2013,10.1242/jeb.078519,216,9,1736-1743,NA,enzyme kinetics; oxaloacetate; succinate dehydrogenase; succinate oxidation; torpor

The sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) encounters considerable variations in environmental oxygen availability, and is an interesting model for studying the effects of hypoxia on fish cardiorespiratory function. We investigated how in vivo hypoxia acclimation (6 months at 40\% then 3 weeks at 20\% air saturation) and in vitro anoxia-reoxygenation affected sablefish cardiac mitochondrial respiration and reactive oxygen species (ROS) release rates using high-resolution fluorespirometry. Further, we investigated how hypoxia acclimation affected the sensitivity of mitochondrial respiration to nitric oxide (NO), and compared mitochondrial lipid and fatty acid (FA) composition between groups. Hypoxia acclimation did not alter mitochondrial coupled or uncoupled respiration, or respiratory control ratio, ROS release rates, P-50 or superoxide dismutase activity. However, it increased citrate synthase activity (by similar to 20\%), increased the sensitivity of mitochondrial respiration to NO inhibition (i.e., the NO IC50 was 25\% lower), and enhanced the recovery of respiration (by 21\%) and reduced ROS release rates (by 25-30\%) post-anoxia.

Mitochondrial respiratory capacities (assessed using substrates of mitochondrial complexes I, II and/or IV) were higher in highland ducks in the gastrocnemius muscle-the primary muscle used to support swimming and diving-but were similar between populations in the pectoralis muscle and the left ventricle. The heightened respiratory capacity in the gastrocnemius of highland ducks was associated with elevated activities of cytochrome oxidase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase and malate dehydrogenase (MDH). Although respiratory capacities were similar between populations in the other muscles, highland ducks had elevated activities of ATP synthase, lactate dehydrogenase, MDH, hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase and creatine kinase in the left ventricle, and elevated MDH activity and myoglobin content in the pectoralis. Thus, although there was a significant increase in the oxidative capacity of the gastrocnemius in highland ducks, which correlates with improved performance at high altitudes, the variation in metabolic enzyme activities in other muscles not correlated to respiratory capacity, such as the consistent upregulation of MDH activity, may serve other functions that contribute to success at high altitudes.",2016,10.1242/jeb.142711,219,23,3719-3728,NA,High altitude; Mitochondrial respiration; Energy metabolism; Myoglobin; Muscle energetics

Here, we demonstrate that the hooded seal (Cystophora cnstata), a deep -diving Arctic pinniped, shows strong daily patterning of diving behaviour in the wild. Cultures of hooded seal skin fibroblasts exhibit robust circadian oscillation of the core clock genes per2 and arntl. In liver tissue collected from captive hooded seals, expression of arntl was some 4 -fold higher in the middle of the night than in the middle of the day.

Ectotherms often undergo stage-specific changes in size, complexity and duration that are predicted to modify thermal performance. Yet performance is mostly explored for adults, while performance at earlier stages that typically limit persistence remains poorly understood. Here, we experimentally isolate thermal performance curves at fertilization, embryo development and larval development stages in an aquatic ectotherm whose early planktonic stages (gametes, embryos and larvae) govern adult abundances and dynamics. Unlike previous studies based on short-term exposures. responses with unclear links to fitness or proxies in lieu of explicit curve descriptors (thermal optima, limits and breadth), we measured performance as successful completion of each stage after exposure throughout, and at temperatures that explicitly capture curve descriptors at all stages. Formal comparisons of descriptors using a combination of generalized linear mixed modelling and parametric bootstrapping reveal important differences among life stages. Thermal performance differs significantly from fertilization to embryo development (with thermal optimum declining by similar to 2 degrees C, thermal limits shifting inwards by similar to 8-10 degrees C and thermal breadth narrowing by similar to 10 degrees C), while performance declines independently of temperature thereafter. Our comparisons show that thermal performance at one life stage can misrepresent performance at others, and point to gains in complexity during embryogenesis, rather than subsequent gains in size or duration of exposure, as a key driver of thermal sensitivity in early life.",2020,10.1242/jeb.233254,223,22,NA,jeb233254,Climate change; Complexity; Development; Duration of exposure; External fertilization; Thermal sensitivity

Yolk-free body mass did not change between internal pipping and hatching, but the heart and thigh skeletal muscle grew at faster rates than the rest of the body as the animals transitioned from an externally pipped paranate to a hatchling. Large changes in oxidative phosphorylation capacity occurred during ontogeny in both thigh muscles, the primary site of shivering, and cardiac ventricles.

Phenotypic flexibility, such as reversible acclimatization, permits organisms to achieve high performance over a wide range of environmental conditions, without the costly allocation or acquisition tradeoffs associated with behavioral thermoregulation, which may expedite range expansion in introduced species. The northern curly-tailed lizard, Leiocephalus carinatus, was introduced to the USA in the 1940s and is now established in southern Florida. We measured bite force and the thermal sensitivity of sprinting of L. carinatus during the winter and spring to determine how morphology and performance varied seasonally. We found evidence of seasonal variation in several aspects of physiological performance. Lizards sampled in spring sprinted faster and tolerated higher temperatures, while lizards sampled in winter had high performance over a wider range of temperatures. Furthermore, seasonal differences in physiology were only detected after generating thermal reaction norms. Both sprint and bite force performance did not differ seasonally when solely comparing performance at a common temperature. No seasonal relationships between morphology and performance were detected. Our results suggest that L. carinatus may use reversible acclimatization to maintain high levels of performance across seasons not typically experienced within their native range.

These highly mobile ants endure the extreme temperatures of their sand dune environment with outstanding behavioural, physiological and morphological adaptations. Surprisingly, C. bombycina has comparatively shorter legs than its well-studied sister species Cataglyphis fortis from salt pan habitats. This holds despite the somewhat hotter surface temperatures and the more yielding sand substrate. Here, we report that C. bombycina employs a different strategy in reaching high running speeds, outperforming the fastest known runs of the longer-legged C. fortis ants. Video analysis across a broad range of locomotor speeds revealed several differences to C. fortis. Shorter leg lengths are compensated for by high stride frequencies, ranging beyond 40 Hz. This is mainly achieved by a combination of short stance phases (down to 7 ms) and fast leg swing movements (up to 1400 mm s(-1)). The legs of one tripod group exhibit almost perfect synchrony in the timings of their lift-offs and touchdowns, and good tripod coordination is present over the entire walking speed range (tripod coordination strength values around 0.8). This near synchrony in leg movement may facilitate locomotion across the yielding sand dune substrate.",2019,10.1242/jeb.198705,222,20,NA,jeb198705,Stride frequency; High walking speed; Insect; Inter-leg coordination; Aerial phases
article,Antioxidant capacity and anoxia tolerance in <i>Austrofundulus limnaeus</i> embryos,"Wagner, Josiah T. and Knapp, Michael J. and Podrabsky, Jason E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Embryos of Austrofundulus limnaeus can tolerate extreme environmental stresses by entering into a state of metabolic and developmental arrest known as diapause. Oxidative stress is ubiquitous in aerobic organisms and the unique biology and ecology of A. limnaeus likely results in frequent and repeated exposures to oxidative stress during development. The antioxidant capacity of A. limnaeus was explored during development by measuring antioxidant capacity due to small molecules and several enzymatic antioxidant systems. Diapause II embryos can survive for several days in 1\% hydrogen peroxide without indications of negative effects. Surprisingly, both small and large molecule antioxidant systems have the highest capacity during early development, which may be due to maternal provisioning. Antioxidant capacity is largely invested in small molecules during early development and in enzymatic systems during late development. The switch in antioxidant mechanisms and decline in small molecule antioxidants during development correlates with the loss of extreme anoxia tolerance.",2019,10.1242/jeb.204347,222,12,NA,jeb204347,Catalase; Glutathione peroxidase; Superoxide dismutase; Development; Oxygen radical absorbance capacity
article,Effects of hypoxia on swimming and sensing in a weakly electric fish,"Ackerly, Kerri Lynn and Krahe, Ruediger and Sanford, Christopher P. and Chapman, Lauren J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Low dissolved oxygen (hypoxia) can severely limit fish performance, especially aerobically expensive behaviours including swimming and acquisition of sensory information. Fishes can reduce oxygen requirements by altering these behaviours under hypoxia, but the underlying mechanisms can be difficult to quantify. We used a weakly electric fish as a model system to explore potential effects of hypoxia on swim performance and sensory information acquisition, which enabled us to non-invasively record electric signalling activity used for active acquisition of sensory information during swimming. To quantify potential effects of hypoxia, we measured critical swim speed (U-crit) and concurrent electric signalling activity under high-and low-dissolved oxygen concentrations in a hypoxia-tolerant African mormyrid fish, Marcusenius victoriae. Fish were maintained under normoxia for 6 months pnor to experimental treatments, and then acclimated for 8 weeks to normoxia or hypoxia and tested under both conditions (acute: 4 h exposure). Acute hypoxia exposure resulted in a significant reduction in both U-crit and electric signalling activity in fish not acclimated to hypoxia. However, individuals acclimated to chronic hypoxia were characterized by a higher U-crit under both hypoxia and normoxia than fish acclimated to normoxia. Following a 6 month re-introduction to normoxia, hypoxia-acclimated individuals still showed increased performance under acute hypoxic test conditions, but not under normoxia. Our results highlight the detrimental effects of hypoxia on aerobic swim performance and sensory information acquisition, and the ability of fish to heighten aerobic performance through acclimation processes that can still influence performance even months after initial exposure.",2018,10.1242/jeb.172130,221,14,NA,172130,Acclimation; Dissolved oxygen; Critical swim speed; Mormyridae; Aerobic performance; Electrosensation
article,"Melatonin attenuates phenotypic flexibility of energy metabolism in a photoresponsive mammal, the Siberian hamster","Boratynski, Jan S. and Jefimow, Malgorzata and Wojciechowski, Michal S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The duration of melatonin (MEL) secretion conveys information about day length and initiates a cascade of seasonal phenotypic adjustments in photoresponsive mammals. With shortening days, animals cease reproduction, minimize energy expenditure, enhance thermoregulatory capacity and adjust functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to match the winter increase in energy demands. Within each season, stress plays an important role in the flexible adjustments of a phenotype to environmental perturbations. Recent studies have shown that thermal reaction norms of energy metabolism were narrower in winter-acclimated Siberian hamsters, Phodopus sungorus. We tested the hypothesis that physiological changes occurring in response to prolonged MEL signals, including changes in the secretion of stress hormones, are responsible for the seasonal decrease in phenotypic flexibility of energy metabolism in photoresponsive mammals. To quantify reaction norms for basal metabolic rate (BMR) and cortisol (CORT) secretion, male Siberian hamsters maintained at a long (16 h: 8 h light: dark) photoperiod were acclimated repeatedly for 12 days to 10 and 28 degrees C. As predicted, the phenotypic flexibility of BMR decreased when animals were supplemented with MEL. However, at the same time, mean CORT concentration and the reaction norm for its secretion in response to changes in acclimation temperature increased. These results suggest that decreased sensitivity of HPA axis to CORT signal, rather than changes in CORT level itself, is responsible for the decreased phenotypic flexibility in photoresponsive species. Our results suggest that decreased phenotypic flexibility in winter, together with increased stress hormone secretion, make photosensitive species more vulnerable to climate change.",2017,10.1242/jeb.159517,220,17,3154-3161,NA,Photoperiodism; Phenotypic flexibility; Energy expenditure; Stress; Melatonin; Cortisol
article,Brood size constrains the development of endothermy in blue tits,"Andreasson, Fredrik and Nord, Andreas and Nilsson, Jan-Ake",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Altricial birds are unable to maintain body temperature when exposed to low ambient temperatures during the first days after hatching. Thermoregulatory capacity begins to form as postnatal development progresses, and eventually nestlings become homeothermic. Several factors may influence this development at both the level of the individual and the level of the whole brood, but to our knowledge no studies have focused on the effect of brood size per se on the development of endothermy in individual nestlings. We performed cooling experiments on blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) nestlings in the field, to study how different experimental brood sizes affected the development of endothermy in individual nestlings and the thermal environment experienced by the whole brood in the nest. Nestlings from all experimental brood sizes showed a decrease in cooling rate as they grew older, but birds from reduced broods showed an earlier onset of endothermy compared with nestlings from enlarged and control broods. This difference manifested during early development and gradually disappeared as nestlings grew older. The thermal environment in the nests differed between treatments during nestling development, such that nest temperature in reduced broods was lower than that in enlarged broods during all days and during nights at the end of the experimental period. We suggest that the development of endothermy in blue tit nestlings is not ontogenetically fixed, but instead may vary according to differences in developmental, nutritional and thermal conditions as determined by brood size.",2016,10.1242/jeb.135350,219,14,2212-2219,NA,Cyanistes caeruleus; Homeothermy; Thermoregulatory capacity; Thermal imaging; Thermoregulation

The best-fitting model was curvilinear using five strategically selected P-O2 values. This model predicted PAAS-50 as 70 mmHg (coefficient of variation, CV=9\%) for rainbow trout.

article,Out in the cold and sick: low temperatures and fungal infections impair a frog's skin defenses,"Robak, Matthew J. and Reinert, Laura K. and Rollins-Smith, Louise A. and Richards-Zawacki, Corinne L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Amphibians worldwide continue to battle an emerging infectious disease, chytridiomycosis, caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Southern leopard frogs, Rana sphenocephala, are known to become infected with this pathogen, yet they are considered `of least concern' for declines due to chytridiomycosis. Previous studies have shown that R. sphenocephala secretes four antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) onto their skin which may play an important role in limiting susceptibility to chytridiomycosis. Here, we examined (1) the effects of temperature and AMP depletion on infections with Bd and (2) the effects of temperature and Bd infection on the capacity to secrete AMPs in juvenile leopard frogs. Pathogen burden and mortality were greater in frogs exposed to Bd at low temperature but did not increase following monthly AMP depletion. Both low temperature and Bd exposure reduced the capacity of juvenile frogs to restore peptides after monthly depletions. Frogs held at 14 degrees C were poorly able to restore peptides in comparison with those at 26 degrees C. Frogs held at 26 degrees C were better able to restore their peptides, but when exposed to Bd, this capacity was significantly reduced. These results strongly support the hypothesis that both colder temperatures and Bd infection impair the capacity of juvenile frogs to produce and secrete AMPs, an important component of their innate defense against chytrid fungi and other pathogens. Thus, in the face of unpredictable climate changes and enzootic pathogens, assessments of disease risk should consider the potential for effects of environmental variation and pathogen exposure on the quality of host defenses.",2019,10.1242/jeb.209445,222,18,NA,jeb209445,Amphibian; Antimicrobial peptides; Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; Chytridiomycosis; Rana (Lithobates) sphenocephala; Climate

E. and Stauffer, J. and Ilmonen, P. and Calhim, S. and Schuett, W. and Laaksonen, T.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Striking variation in melanin coloration within natural populations is likely due to the different fitness outcomes of alternative phenotypes in varying environmental conditions. There are two types of melanin: eumelanins yield blackish hues, whereas pheomelanins yield reddish hues. The production of eumelanins requires low levels of glutathione (GSH), which is the most important intracellular antioxidant, whereas the production of pheomelanins requires high levels of GSH. We investigated the oxidative status of male pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) with different degrees of melanin coloration under different temperatures during the nestling period. Moreover, we assessed the oxidative status of offspring in relation to their biological or foster father's melanin coloration and ambient temperature. To separate offspring genotype effects and paternal effects in different temperatures, we used a partial cross-foster design. The temperature differently affected the oxidative status of differently colored male pied flycatchers and their foster offspring. When the weather was relatively cold, black males had higher glutathione S-transferase levels compared with brown males, indicating enhanced stress in black males. Foster offspring of black males had a lower ratio between reduced and oxidized GSH followed by higher total amount of GSH than foster offspring of brown males. Thus, foster offspring of black males seem to suffer from oxidative stress under relatively cold weather compared with those of brown males, and vice versa under relatively warm weather. Although differently colored males experienced changes in their oxidative status under different temperatures, the link between paternal melanin coloration and offspring oxidative stress appears to be environmentally induced.",2019,10.1242/jeb.195909,222,7,NA,jeb195909,Environmental heterogeneity; Genetic quality; Genotype-by-environment interaction; Oxidative stress; Phenotypic variation; Phenotypic quality; Sexual selection; Secondary sexual trait
article,Interspecific variation in brain mitochondrial complex I and II capacity and ROS emission in marine sculpins,"Lau, Gigi Y. and Richards, Jeffrey G.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Environmental hypoxia presents a metabolic challenge for animals because it inhibits mitochondrial respiration and can lead to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We investigated the interplay between O-2 use for aerobic respiration and ROS generation among sculpin fishes (Cottidae, Actinopterygii) that are known to vary in whole-animal hypoxia tolerance. We hypothesized that mitochondria from hypoxia-tolerant sculpins would show more efficient O-2 use with a higher phosphorylation efficiency and lower ROS emission. We showed that brain mitochondria from more hypoxia-tolerant sculpins had lower complex I and higher complex II flux capacities compared with less hypoxia-tolerant sculpins, but these differences were not related to variation in phosphorylation efficiency (ADP/O) or mitochondrial coupling (respiratory control ratio). The hypoxia-tolerant sculpins had higher mitochondrial H2O2 emission per O-2 consumed (H2O2/O-2) under oligomycin-induced state 4 conditions compared with less hypoxia-tolerant sculpins. An in vitro redox challenge experiment revealed species differences in how well mitochondria defend their glutathione redox status when challenged with high levels of reduced glutathione, but the redox challenge elicited the same H2O2/O-2 in all species. Furthermore, in vitro anoxia recovery lowered absolute H2O2 emission (H2O2 per mg mitochondrial protein) in all species and negatively impacted state 3 respiration rates in some species, but the responses were not related to hypoxia tolerance. Overall, we clearly demonstrate a relationship between hypoxia tolerance and complex I and II flux capacities in sculpins, but the differences in complex flux capacity do not appear to be directly related to variation in ROS metabolism.",2019,10.1242/jeb.189407,222,2,NA,jeb189407,Mitochondria; Hypoxia; Hypoxia tolerance; Reactive oxygen species; ROS; Fish
article,Stellate and pyramidal neurons in goldfish telencephalon respond differently to anoxia and GABA receptor inhibition,"Hossein-Javaheri, Nariman and Wilkie, Michael P. and Lado, Wudu E. and Buck, Leslie T.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"With oxygen deprivation, the mammalian brain undergoes hyperactivity and neuronal death while this does not occur in the anoxia-tolerant goldfish (Carassius auratus). Anoxic survival of the goldfish may rely on neuromodulatory mechanisms to suppress neuronal hyper-excitability. As gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, we decided to investigate its potential role in suppressing the electrical activity of goldfish telencephalic neurons. Utilizing whole-cell patch-clamp recording, we recorded the electrical activities of both excitatory (pyramidal) and inhibitory (stellate) neurons. With anoxia, membrane potential (V-m) depolarized in both cell types from -72.2 mV to -57.7 mV and from -64.5 mV to -46.8 mV in pyramidal and stellate neurons, respectively. While pyramidal cells remained mostly quiescent, action potential frequency (AP(f)) of the stellate neurons increased 68-fold. Furthermore, the GABA(A) receptor reversal potential (E-GABA) was determined using the gramicidin perforated-patch-clamp method and found to be depolarizing in pyramidal (-53.8 mV) and stellate neurons (-42.1 mV). Although GABA was depolarizing, pyramidal neurons remained quiescent as E-GABA was below the action potential threshold (-36 mV pyramidal and -38 mV stellate neurons). Inhibition of GABA(A) receptors with gabazine reversed the anoxia-mediated response. While GABA(B) receptor inhibition alone did not affect the anoxic response, co-antagonism of GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors (gabazine and CGP-55848) led to the generation of seizure-like activities in both neuron types. We conclude that with anoxia, V-m depolarizes towards E-GABA which increases AP(f) in stellate neurons and decreases AP(f) in pyramidal neurons, and that GABA plays an important role in the anoxia tolerance of goldfish brain.",2017,10.1242/jeb.146605,220,4,695-704,NA,Action potential; Spike frequency; Whole-cell conductance; Membrane potential; Action potential frequency; E-GABA

Two sets of recombinant inbred lines derived from lines artificially selected for high and low levels of knockdown resistance to high temperature in young flies were used as the mapping population.

In contrast, for mammals, the ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury that leads to tissue damage during a heart attack is initiated by a burst of superoxide (O2 \& BULL;-) production from the mitochondrial respiratory chain upon reperfusion of ischemic tissue. Whether turtles avoid oxidative tissue damage because of an absence of mitochondrial superoxide production upon reoxygenation, or because the turtle heart is particularly protected against this damage, is unclear. Here, we investigated whether there was an increase in mitochondrial O2 \& BULL;- production upon the reoxygenation of anoxic red-eared slider turtle hearts in vivo and in vitro. This was done by measuring the production of H2O2, the dismutation product of O2 \& BULL;-, using the mitochondria targeted mass-spectrometric probe in vivo MitoB, while in parallel assessing changes in the metabolites driving mitochondrial O2 \& BULL;- production, succinate, ATP and ADP levels during anoxia, and H2O2 consumption and production rates of isolated heart mitochondria. We found that there was no excess production of in vivo H2O2 during 1 h of reoxygenation in turtles after 3 h anoxia at room temperature, suggesting that turtle hearts most likely do not suffer oxidative injury after anoxia because their mitochondria produce no excess O2 \& BULL;- upon reoxygenation. Instead, our data support the conclusion that both the low levels of succinate accumulation and the maintenance of ADP levels in the anoxic turtle heart are key factors in preventing the surge of O2 \& BULL;- production upon reoxygenation.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245516,226,9,NA,jeb245516,KEY WORDS; Mitochondria; Trachemys scripta; Reverse electron transfer; Hibernation; Oxidative damage; Heart; Anoxia

We hypothesized that M?O2 would increase with acclimation temperature in the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in parallel with metabolic remodeling at the cellular level but that changes in metabolism in some tissues, such as liver, would contribute more to changes in M?O2 than others. Threespine stickleback were acclimated to 5, 12 and 20 degrees C for 7 to 21 weeks. At each temperature, standard and maximum metabolic rate (SMR and MMR, respectively), and absolute aerobic scope (AAS) were quantified, along with mitochondrial respiration rates in liver, oxidative skeletal and cardiac muscles, and the maximal activity of citrate synthase (CS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in liver, and oxidative and glycolytic skeletal muscles. SMR, MMR and AAS increased with acclimation temperature, along with rates of mitochondrial phosphorylating respiration in all tissues. Low SMR and MMR at 5 degrees C were associated with low or undetectable rates of mitochondrial complex II activity and a greater reliance on complex I activity in liver, oxidative skeletal muscle and heart. SMR was positively correlated with cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) activity in liver and oxidative muscle, but not mitochondrial proton leak, whereas MMR was positively correlated with CCO activity in liver.

As global temperatures become more unpredictable, it is imperative that we understand the molecular mechanisms by which organisms respond to variable, and often transient, thermal environments. Beyond deciphering the mechanisms through which organisms respond to temperature, we must also appreciate the underlying variation in temperature-dependent processes, as this variation is essential for understanding the potential to adapt to changing climates. In this Commentary, we use temperature-dependent sex determination as an example to explore the mechanistic processes underlying the development of temperature-sensitive phenotypes. We synthesize the current literature on how variable thermal conditions affect these processes and address factors that may limit or allow organisms to respond to variable environments. From these examples, we posit a framework for how the field might move forward in a more systematic way to address three key questions: (1) which genes directly respond to temperature-sensitive changes in protein function and which genes are downstream, indirect responders?; (2) how long does it take different proteins and genes to respond to temperature?; and (3) are the experimental temperature manipulations relevant to the climate the organism experiences or to predicted climate change scenarios? This approach combines mechanistic questions (questions 1 and 2) with ecologically relevant conditions (question 3), allowing us to explore how organisms respond to transient thermal environments and, thus, cope with climate change.",2022,10.1242/jeb.242373,225,11,NA,jeb242373,Climate Change; Development; Gene Expression

Sex-biased trait variation may affect patterns of habitat use, and if the microhabitats used by each sex have dissimilar microclimates, this can drive sex-specific selection on thermal physiology. Nevertheless, tests of differences between the sexes in thermal physiology are uncommon, and studies linking these differences to microhabitat use or behavior are even rarer. We examined microhabitat use and thermal physiology in two ectothermic congeners that are ecologically similar but differ in their degree of sexual size dimorphism. Brown anoles (Anolis sagrei) exhibit male-biased sexual size dimorphism and live in thermally heterogeneous habitats, whereas slender anoles (Anolis apletophallus) are sexually monomorphic in body size and live in thermally homogeneous habitats. We hypothesized that differences in habitat use between the sexes would drive sexual divergence in thermal physiology in brown anoles, but not slender anoles, because male and female brown anoles may be exposed to divergent microclimates. We found that male and female brown anoles, but not slender anoles, used perches with different thermal characteristics and were sexually dimorphic in thermal tolerance traits. However, field-active body temperatures and behavior in a laboratory thermal arena did not differ between females and males in either species.

Energy-constraining conditions, such as cold and starvation, are known to cause the expression of daily torpor. However, the reason for high degrees of inter- and intra-individual variation in torpor expression (TE) in similar situations is not clear. As littermates of altricial animals are exposed to an uneven allocation of maternal resources from conception to weaning, we tested whether early nutritional experiences have long-term effects on TE in adults. We used full-sibling littermates of laboratory mice that as adults were starved overnight to induce torpor. We measured body mass from birth until adulthood as an indicator of nutritional status, and calculated the relative body mass (RBM) as an indicator of the difference in nutritional status within a litter. After maturation, we subjected mice to five repeated torpor induction trials involving 24 h of fasting and 5 days of recovery. Half of the female mice displayed great individual variation in TE whereas male mice rarely exhibited daily torpor. In females, RBM at birth influenced TE, irrespective of body mass in adulthood; thus, female mice born with low RBMs displayed high TE in adulthood. In conclusion, we provide evidence that TE in mice differs among littermates, and that this variation is linked closely to heterogeneous nutritional experiences during the fetal period.",2018,10.1242/jeb.171983,221,12,NA,jeb171983,Daily torpor; Developmental effect; Sibling competition; Phenotypic plasticity; Body mass; Mus musculus

The present study addresses poorly understood associations and trade-offs between endogenous diapause duration, thermal sensitivity of development, energetic cost of development and cold tolerance. Diapause intensity, metabolic rate trajectories and lipid profiles of directly developing and diapausing animals were studied using pupae and adults of Pieris napi butterflies from a population in which endogenous diapause has been well studied. Endogenous diapause was terminated after 3 months and termination required chilling. Metabolic and post-diapause development rates increased with diapause duration, while the metabolic cost of post-diapause development decreased, indicating that once diapause is terminated, development proceeds at a low rate even at low temperature. Diapausing pupae had larger lipid stores than the directly developing pupae, and lipids constituted the primary energy source during diapause. However, during diapause, lipid stores did not decrease. Thus, despite lipid catabolism meeting the low energy costs of the diapausing pupae, primary lipid store utilization did not occur until the onset of growth and metamorphosis in spring. In line with this finding, diapausing pupae contained low amounts of mitochondria-derived cardiolipins, which suggests a low capacity for fatty acid beta-oxidation. While ontogenic development had a large effect on lipid and fatty acid profiles, only small changes in these were seen during diapause. The data therefore indicate that the diapause lipidomic phenotype is developed early, when pupae are still at high temperature, and retained until post-diapause development.",2016,10.1242/jeb.142687,219,19,3049-3060,NA,Fatty acids; Lipid stores; Pieris napi; Pupa; Respirometry; Stress

Physiological levels of D-glucose did not influence twitch force development for aerobic preparations (1) paced at 0.5 or 1.1. Hz, (2) at 15 or 23 degrees C, (3) receiving adrenergic stimulation or (4) during reoxygenation with or without adrenaline after severe hypoxia. Contractile responses to ryanodine, an inhibitor of Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, were also not affected by exogenous glucose. However, glucose did attenuate the fall in twitch force during severe hypoxia. Glucose uptake was assayed in non-contracting ventricle strips using 2-{[}H-3] deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) under aerobic and hypoxic conditions, at different incubation temperatures and with different inhibitors. Based upon a lack of saturation of 2-DG uptake and incomplete inhibition of uptake by cytochalasin B and D-glucose, 2-DG uptake was mediated by a combination of facilitated transport and simple diffusion. Hypoxia stimulated lactate efflux sixfold to sevenfold with glucose present, but did not increase 2-DG uptake or reduce lactate efflux in the presence of cytochalasin B. Increasing temperature (14 to 24 degrees C) also did not increase 2-DG uptake, but decreasing temperature (14 to 4 degrees C) reduced 2-DG uptake by 45\%. In conclusion, exogenous glucose improves mechanical performance under hypoxia but not under any of the aerobic conditions applied.

However, TPCs may vary across traits because selection and environmental sensitivity (plasticity) differ across traits or because the timing and duration of the temperature exposure, here termed time scale, may alter trait variation. Yet, the extent to which TPCs vary temporally and across traits is rarely considered in assessments of climate change responses. Using a common garden approach, we estimated TPCs for standard metabolic rate (SMR), and activity in Drosophila melanogaster at three test temperatures (16.25 and 30 degrees C), using flies from each of six developmental temperatures (16, 18, 20, 25, 28 and 30 degrees C). We examined the effects of time scale of temperature exposure (minutes/ hours versus days/weeks) in altering TPC shape and position, and commonly used descriptors of the TPC: thermal optimum (T-opt), thermal limits (T-min and T-max) and thermal breadth (T-br). In addition, we collated previously published estimates of TPCs for fecundity and egg-to-adult viability in D. melanogaster. We found that the descriptors of the TPCs varied across traits (egg-to-adult viability, SMR, activity and fecundity), but variation in TPCs within these traits was small across studies when measured at the same time scales. The time scale at which traits were measured contributed to greater variation in TPCs than the observed variance across traits, although the relative importance of time scale differed depending on the trait (activity versus fecundity). Variation in the TPC across traits and time scales suggests that TPCs using single traits may not be an accurate predictor of fitness and thermal adaptation across environments.",2019,10.1242/jeb.193433,222,11,NA,jeb193433,T-opt; Metabolic rate; Activity; Fecundity; Egg-to-adult viability; Plasticity

In mammals, SELENOT is expressed during ontogenesis and progressively decreases in adult tissues. In the heart, it is re-expressed after ischemia and induces cardioprotection against ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. SELENOT is present in teleost fish, including the goldfish Carassius auratus. This study aimed to evaluate the cardiac expression of SELENOT, and the effects of exogenous PSELT (a 43-52 SELENOT-derived peptide) on the heart function of C. auratus, a hypoxia tolerance fish model. We found that SELENOT was expressed in cardiac extracts of juvenile and adult fish, located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) together with calsequestrin-2. Expression increased under acute hypoxia. On ex vivo isolated and perfused goldfish heart preparations, under normoxia, PSELT dose dependently increased stroke volume (V-s), cardiac output ((Q)over dot) and stroke work (SW), involving cAMP, PKA, L-type calcium channels, SERCA2a pumps and pAkt. Under hypoxia, PSELT did not affect myocardial contractility. Only at higher concentrations (10(-8) to 10(-7) mol l(-1) ) was an increase of V-s and (Q)over dot observed. It also reduced the cardiac expression of 3-NT, a tissue marker of nitrosative stress, which increases under low oxygen availability. These data are the first to propose SELENOT 43-52 (PSELT) as a cardiac modulator in fish, with a potential protective role under hypoxia.",2019,10.1242/jeb.201202,222,11,NA,jeb201202,SELENOT expression; Heart; Normoxia; Hypoxia; Intracellular calcium; Redox balance
article,Strong association between corticosterone levels and temperature-dependent metabolic rate in individual zebra finches,"Jimeno, Blanca and Hau, Michaela and Verhulst, Simon",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Glucocorticoid hormones (GCs) are often assumed to be indicators of stress. At the same time, one of their fundamental roles is to facilitate metabolic processes to accommodate changes in energetic demands. Although the metabolic function of GCs is thought to be ubiquitous across vertebrates, we are not aware of experiments which tested this directly, i.e. in which metabolic rate was manipulated and measured together with GCs. We therefore tested for a relationship between plasma corticosterone (CORT; ln transformed) andmetabolic rate (MR; measured using indirect calorimetry) in a between- and within-individual design in captive zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) of both sexes. In each individual, CORT and MR were measured at two different temperature levels: `warm' (22 degrees C) and `cold' (12 degrees C). CORT and MR were both increased in colder compared with warmer conditions within individuals, but also across individuals. At the between- individual level, we found a positive relationship between CORT and MR, with an accelerating slope towards higher MR and CORT values. In contrast, the within-individual changes in CORT and MR in response to colder conditions were linearly correlated between individuals. The CORT-MR relationship did not differ between the sexes. Our results illustrate the importance of including variation at different levels to better understand physiological modulation. Furthermore, our findings support the interpretation of CORT variation as an indicator of metabolic needs.",2017,10.1242/jeb.166124,220,23,4426-4431,NA,Corticosterone; Taeniopygia guttata; Glucocorticoid; Metabolic rate

Because both summit (M-sum, maximum thermoregulatory metabolic rate) and maximum (MMR, maximum exercise metabolic rate) metabolic rates are functions of skeletal muscle activity, correlations between these measurements and their mechanistic underpinnings might occur. To examine whether such correlations occur, we measured the effects of experimental cold and exercise training protocols for 3 weeks on body (M-b) and muscle (M-pec) masses, basalmetabolic rate(BMR), M-sum, MMR, pectoralism RNA and protein expression for myostatin, and mRNA expression of TLL-1 and TLL-2 (metalloproteinase activators of myostatin) in house sparrows (Passer domesticus). Both training protocols increased M-sum, MMR, M-b and M-pec, but BMR increased with cold training and decreased with exercise training. No significant differences occurred for pectoralis myostatin mRNA expression, but cold and exercise increased the expression of TLL-1 and TLL-2. Pectoralis myostatin protein levels were generally reduced for both training groups. These data clearly demonstrate cross-training effects of cold and exercise in birds, and are consistent with a role for myostatin in increasing pectoralis muscle mass and driving organismal increases in metabolic capacities.",2015,10.1242/jeb.121822,218,14,2190-2200,NA,Phenotypic flexibility; Cold training; Exercise training; Pectoralis; Myostatin; MMR; M-sum; BMR; Birds
article,The evolution of micro-cursoriality in mammals,"Lovegrove, Barry G. and Mowoe, Metobor O.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In this study we report on the evolution of micro-cursoriality, a unique case of cursoriality in mammals smaller than 1 kg. We obtained new running speed and limb morphology data for two species of elephant-shrews (Elephantulus spp., Macroscelidae) from Namaqualand, South Africa, which we compared with published data for other mammals. Elephantulus maximum running speeds were higher than those of most mammals smaller than 1 kg. Elephantulus also possess exceptionally high metatarsal: femur ratios (1.07) that are typically associated with fast unguligrade cursors. Cursoriality evolved in the Artiodactyla, Perissodactyla and Carnivora coincident with global cooling and the replacement of forests with open landscapes in the Oligocene and Miocene. The majority of mammal species, though, remained non-cursorial, plantigrade and small (< 1 kg). The extraordinary running speed and digitigrady of elephant-shrews was established in the Early Eocene in the earliest macroscelid Prodiacodon, but was probably inherited from Paleocene, Holarctic stem macroscelids. Micro-cursoriality in macroscelids evolved from the plesiomorphic plantigrade foot of the possum-like ancestral mammal earlier than in other mammalian crown groups. Micro-cursoriality evolved first in forests, presumably in response to selection for rapid running speeds facilitated by local knowledge, in order to avoid predators. During the Miocene, micro-cursoriality was pre-adaptive to open, arid habitats, and became more derived in the newly evolved Elephantulus and Macroscelides elephant-shrews with trail running.",2014,10.1242/jeb.095737,217,8,1316-1325,NA,Elephant-shrews; Macroscelidae; Running speed; Cursors; Mammals
article,Mortality caused by extracellular freezing is associated with fragmentation of nuclear DNA in Iarval haemocytes of two drosophilid flies,"Stetina, Tomas and Kostal, Vladimir",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The great complexity of extracellular freezing stress, involving mechanical, osmotic, dehydration and chemical perturbations of the cellular milieu, hampers progress in understanding the nature of freezing injury and the mechanisms to cope with it in naturally freeze-tolerant insects. Here, we show that nuclear DNA fragmentation begins to occur in larval haemocytes of two fly species, Chymomyza costata and Drosophila melanogaster, before or at the same time as the sub-zero temperature is reached that causes irreparable freezing injury and mortality in freeze-sensitive larval phenotypes. However, when larvae of the freeze-tolerant phenotype (diapausing-cold acclimated-hyperprolinemic) of C. costata were subjected to severe freezing stress in liquid nitrogen, no DNA damage was observed. Artificially increasing the proline concentration in freeze-sensitive larvae of both species by feeding them a proline-enriched diet resulted in a decrease in the proportion of nuclei with fragmented DNA during freezing stress. Our results suggest that proline accumulated in diapausing C. costata larvae during cold acclimation may contribute to the protection of nuclear DNA against fragmentation associated with freezing stress.",2023,10.1242/jeb.246456,226,21,NA,jeb246456,Insects; Freeze tolerance; DNA fragmentation; Comet assay; Proline
article,Phylogeny and evolution of erythrocytes in mammals,"Udroiu, Ion",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In the past century, several authors have investigated the allometry of haematological parameters in mammals. As haematocrit and haemoglobin (Hb) concentration are almost constant within the Mammalia (although with notable exceptions), differences in other haematological parameters are mainly reducible to red blood cell size (mean corpuscular volume, MCV). Past studies testing for correlation between MCV and body mass have given contradictory results. Using phylogenetically informed regressions, here I demonstrate that the correlation between MCV and body mass is indirect, and is in reality due to the correlation between MCV and basal metabolic rate. This could be explained by the fact that small erythrocytes allow a fast release of oxygen in tissues with high metabolic demand. Nonetheless, hypoxia-adapted species show MCV greater than that predicted by their metabolic rate, while Ruminantia show the inverse. Interestingly, these species show the highest and lowest, respectively, Hb affinity for oxygen. In the present paper, I suggest that Hb-oxygen affinity, acting as a biological constraint for oxygen exchange, determines the size of red blood cells. Hb intrinsic affinity for oxygen shows little variation during evolution and modifying the levels of allosteric factors can be viewed as an adaption to adjust Hb-oxygen affinity to metabolic demands (the same also happens during ontogeny). Nonetheless, in some lineages, mutations raising Hb-oxygen affinity allowed some species to colonize hypoxic environments; in Ruminantia, instead, there was a drastic decrease, which cannot be adaptively explained.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245384,226,11,NA,jeb245384,Blood; Cell size; Evolution; Haemoglobin; Metabolic rate; Preadaptation

Such studies require data collection from many species, a challenge when this is experimentally intensive. Moreover, researchers struggle to employ the most biologically appropriate phylogenetic tools for identifying adaptive evolution. Here, we detail an established but greatly underutilized phylogenetic comparative framework - the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process - that explicitly models long-term adaptation. We discuss challenges in implementing and interpreting the model, and we outline potential solutions. We demonstrate use of the model through studying the evolution of thermal physiology in treefrogs. Frogs of the family Hylidae have twice colonized the temperate zone from the tropics, and such colonization likely involved a fundamental change in physiology due to colder and more seasonal temperatures. However, which traits changed to allow colonization is unclear. We measured cold tolerance and characterized thermal performance curves in jumping for 12 species of treefrogs distributed from the Neotropics to temperate North America. We then conducted phylogenetic comparative analyses to examine how tolerances and performance curves evolved and to test whether that evolution was adaptive. We found that tolerance to low temperatures increased with the transition to the temperate zone. In contrast, jumping well at colder temperatures was unrelated to biogeography and thus did not adapt during dispersal. Overall, our study shows how comparative phylogenetic methods can be leveraged in biomechanics and physiology to test the evolutionary drivers of variation among species.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243292,225,"1, SI",NA,jeb243292,Biogeographic dispersal; Critical thermal minimum; Hylidae; Jumping performance; Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model; Thermal performance curve

While both species have been introduced outside of their native ranges, only the bluegill is considered invasive. Here, we report de novo transcriptome assemblies for these fish as a resource for sunfish biology. Comparative analyses of the transcriptomes revealed an unexpected, bluegill-specific expansion in the HSP70 and HSP90 molecular chaperone gene families. These expansions were not unique to the bluegill as expansions in HSP70s and HSP90s were identified in the genomes of other teleost fish using the NCBI RefSeq database. To determine whether gene family expansions are specific for thermal stress responses, GST and SOD gene families that are associated with oxidative stress responses were also analyzed. Species-specific expansions were also observed for these gene families in distinct fish species. Validating our approach, previously described expansions in the MHC gene family were also identified. Intriguingly, the number of HSP70 paralogs was positively correlated with thermotolerance range for each species, suggesting that these expansions can impact organismal physiology. Furthermore, fish that are considered invasive contained a higher average number of HSP70 paralogs than non-invasive fish. Invasive fish also had higher average numbers of HSP90, MHC and GST paralogs, but not SOD paralogs.

article,The effects of temperature on the defensive strikes of rattlesnakes,"Whitford, Malachi D. and Freymiller, Grace A. and Higham, Timothy E. and Clark, Rulon W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Movements of ectotherms are constrained by their body temperature owing to the effects of temperature on muscle physiology. As physical performance often affects the outcome of predator-prey interactions, environmental temperature can influence the ability of ectotherms to capture prey and/or defend themselves against predators. However, previous research on the kinematics of ectotherms suggests that some species may use elastic storage mechanisms when attacking or defending, thereby mitigating the effects of sub-optimal temperature. Rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.) are a speciose group of ectothermic viperid snakes that rely on crypsis, rattling and striking to deter predators. We examined the influence of body temperature on the behavior and kinematics of two rattlesnake species (Crotalus oreganus helleri and Crotalus scutulatus) when defensively striking towards a threatening stimulus. We recorded defensive strikes at body temperatures ranging from 15-35 degrees C. We found that strike speed and speed of mouth gaping during the strike were positively correlated with temperature. We also found a marginal effect of temperature on the probability of striking, latency to strike and strike outcome. Overall, warmer snakes are more likely to strike, strike faster, open their mouth faster and reach maximum gape earlier than colder snakes. However, the effects of temperature were less than would be expected for purely muscle-driven movements. Our results suggest that, although rattlesnakes are at a greater risk of predation at colder body temperatures, their decrease in strike performance may be mitigated to some extent by employing mechanisms in addition to skeletal muscle contraction (e.g. elastic energy storage) to power strikes.",2020,10.1242/jeb.223859,223,14,NA,jeb223859,Predator-prey; Temperature; Kinematics; Gape; Elastic storage
article,Measurement and modelling of primary sex ratios for species with temperature-dependent sex determination,"Massey, Melanie D. and Holt, Sarah M. and Brooks, Ronald J. and Rollinson, Njal",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"For many oviparous animals, incubation temperature influences sex through temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). Although climate change may skew sex ratios in species with TSD, few available methods predict sex under natural conditions, fewer still are based on mechanistic hypotheses of development, and field tests of existing methods are rare. We propose a new approach that calculates the probability of masculinization (PM) in natural nests. This approach subsumes the mechanistic hypotheses describing the outcome of TSD, by integrating embryonic development with the temperature-dependent reaction norm for sex determination. Further, we modify a commonly used method of sex ratio estimation, the constant temperature equivalent (CTE), to provide quantitative estimates of sex ratios. We test our new approaches using snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina). We experimentally manipulated nests in the field, and found that the PM method is better supported than the modified CTE, explaining 69\% of the variation in sex ratios across 27 semi-natural nests. Next, we used the PM method to predict variation in sex ratios across 14 natural nests over 2 years, explaining 67\% of the variation. We suggest that the PM approach is effective and broadly applicable to species with TSD, particularly for forecasting how sex ratios may respond to climate change. Interestingly, we also found that the modified CTE explained up to 64\% of variation in sex ratios in a Type II TSD species, suggesting that our modifications will be useful for future research. Finally, our data suggest that the Algonquin Park population of snapping turtles possesses resilience to biased sex ratios under climate change.",2019,10.1242/jeb.190215,222,1,NA,jeb190215,CTE; Fluctuating temperature; Incubation; Natural nests; Nest temperature; Snapping turtle
article,Effects of temperature and force requirements on muscle work and power output,"Olberding, Jeffrey P. and Deban, Stephen M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Performance ofmuscle-powered movements depends on temperature through its effects on muscle contractile properties. In vitro stimulation of Cuban treefrog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) plantaris muscles reveals that interactions between force and temperature affect the mechanical work of muscle. At low temperatures (9-17 degrees C), muscle work depends on temperature when shortening at any force, and temperature effects are greater at higher forces. At warmer temperatures (13-21 degrees C), muscle work depends on temperature when shortening with intermediate and high forces (>= 30\% peak isometric tetanic force). Shortening velocity is most strongly affected by temperature at low temperatures and high forces. Power is also most strongly affected at low temperature intervals, but this effect is minimized at intermediate forces. Effects of temperature on muscle force explain these interactions; force production decreases at lower temperatures, increasing the challenge of moving a constant force relative to the muscle's capacity. These results suggest that animal performance that requires muscles to do work with low forces relative to a muscle's maximum force production will be robust to temperature changes, and this effect should be true whether muscle acts directly or through elastic-recoil mechanisms and whether force is prescribed (i.e. internal) or variable (i.e. external). Conversely, performance requiring muscles to shorten with relatively large forces is expected to be more sensitive to temperature changes.",2017,10.1242/jeb.153114,220,11,2017-2025,NA,Cuban treefrog; Osteopilus septentrionalis; Elastic energy storage

In this study, we provide the first pharmacological evidence of a putative TRPA1-like channel in the medicinal leech. The leech's polymodal nociceptive neuron was activated by both peripheral and central application of the TRPA1 agonist AITC in a concentration-dependent manner. Responses to AITC were inhibited by the selective TRPA1 antagonist HC030031, but also by the TRPV1 antagonist SB366791. Other TRPA1 activators - N-methylmaleimide (NMM) and cinnamaldehyde (CIN) - also activated this nociceptive neuron, although HC030031 only inhibited the effects of NMM. The polymodal nociceptive neurons responded to moderately cold thermal stimuli (< 17 degrees C) and these responses were blocked by HC030031. AITC sensitivity was also found in the pressure-sensitive sensory neurons and was blocked by HC030031, but not by SB366791. AITC elicited a nocifensive withdrawal of the posterior sucker in a concentration-dependent manner that could be attenuated with HC030031. Peripheral application of AITC in vivo also produced swimming-like behavior that was attenuated by HC030031. These results suggest the presence of a TRPA1-like channel in the medicinal leech nervous system that responds to cold temperatures and may interact with the leech TRPV-like channel.",2015,10.1242/jeb.120600,218,19,3023-3031,NA,Leech; TRPA1; Invertebrate; Nociception

M. and Haider, Fouzia and Sokolov, Eugene P. and Bock, Christian and Sokolova, Inna M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Oxygen fluctuations are common in marine waters, and hypoxia-reoxygenation (H-R) stress can negatively affect mitochondrial metabolism. The long-lived ocean quahog, Arctica islandica, is known for its hypoxia tolerance associated with metabolic rate depression, yet the mechanisms that sustain mitochondrial function during oxygen fluctuations are not well understood. We used top-down metabolic control analysis (MCA) to determine aerobic capacity and control over oxygen flux in the mitochondria of quahogs exposed to short-term hypoxia (24 h <0.01\% O-2) and subsequent reoxygenation (1.5 h 21\% O-2) compared with normoxic control animals (21\% O-2). We demonstrated that flux capacity of the substrate oxidation and proton leak subsystems were not affected by hypoxia, while the capacity of the phosphorylation subsystem was enhanced during hypoxia associated with a depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane. Reoxygenation decreased the oxygen flux capacity of all three mitochondrial subsystems. Control over oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) respiration was mostly exerted by substrate oxidation regardless of H-R stress, whereas control by the proton leak subsystem of LEAK respiration increased during hypoxia and returned to normoxic levels during reoxygenation. During hypoxia, reactive oxygen species (ROS) efflux was elevated in the LEAK state, whereas it was suppressed in the OXPHOS state. Mitochondrial ROS efflux returned to normoxic control levels during reoxygenation. Thus, mitochondria of A. islandica appear robust to hypoxia by maintaining stable substrate oxidation and upregulating phosphorylation capacity, but remain sensitive to reoxygenation. This mitochondrial phenotype might reflect adaptation of A. islandica to environments with unpredictable oxygen fluctuations and its behavioural preference for low oxygen levels.",2021,10.1242/jeb.243082,224,21,NA,jeb243082,Hypoxia tolerance; Mitochondria; Aerobic capacity; Top-down metabolic control analysis; High-resolution respirometry; Oxidative stress marker

Mangrove rivulus (Kryptolebias marmoratus) inhabit mangrove swamps and have developed high tolerance to environmental H2S. They are hermaphroditic and can self-fertilize, producing distinct isogenic lineages with different sensitivity to H2S. Here, we tested the hypothesis that observed differences in responses to H2S are the result of differences in mitochondria! functions. For this purpose, we performed two experimental series, testing (1) the overall mitochondrial oxidizing capacities and (2) the kinetics of apparent H2S mitochondrial oxidation and inhibition in two distinct lineages of mangrove rivulus, originally collected from Belize and Honduras. We used permeabilized livers from both lineages, measured mitochondrial oxidation, and monitored changes during gradual increases of sulphide. Ultimately, we determined that each lineage has a distinct strategy for coping with elevated H2S, indicating divergences in mitochondrial function and metabolism. The Honduras lineage has higher anaerobic capacity substantiated by higher lactate dehydrogenase activity and higher apparent H2S oxidation rates, likely enabling them to tolerate H2S by escaping aquatic H2S in a terrestrial environment. However, Belize fish have increased cytochrome c oxidase and citrate synthase activities as well as increased succinate contribution to mitochondrial respiration, allowing them to tolerate higher levels of aquatic H2S without inhibition of mitochondrial oxygen consumption.

The effects of temperature on survival, moulting and mRNA levels of mTOR signalling genes (Mm-Rheb, Mm-mTOR, Mm-AMPK alpha, Mm-S6K and Mm-AKT) and neuropeptides (Mm-CHH and Mm-MIH) were quantified in juvenile Metacarcinus magister.

Exposure to high heat levels causes various deleterious and lethal effects, including protein misfolding and denaturation. Thermophilic ectotherms have evolved various ways to increase macromolecular stability and cope with elevated body temperatures; these include the high constitutive expression of molecular chaperones. In this study, we investigated the effect of moderate to severe heat shock (37-45 degrees C) on survival, heat hardening, protein damage and the expression of five heat tolerance-related genes (hsc70-4 h1, hsc70-4 h2, hsp83, hsc70-5 and hsf1) in two closely related Cataglyphis ants that occur in distinct habitats.

As a result, C. bombycina demonstrates increased protein stability when exposed to acute heat stress but is less disposed to acquiring induced thermotolerance via heat hardening.

Because thermal performance curves are non-linear, mean performance can differ in fluctuating and constant thermal environments. However, time-dependent effects - effects of the order and duration of exposure to temperature - can also influence mean performance. We quantified the non-linear and time-dependent effects of diurnally fluctuating temperatures for larval growth rates in the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta L., with four main results. First, the shape of the thermal performance curve for growth rate depended on the duration of exposure: for example, optimal temperature and thermal breadth were greater for growth rates measured over short (24 h during the last instar) compared with long (the entire period of larval growth) time periods. Second, larvae reared in diurnally fluctuating temperatures had significantly higher optimal temperatures and maximal growth rates than larvae reared in constant temperatures. Third, for larvae maintained at three mean temperatures (20, 25 and 30 degrees C) and three diurnal temperature ranges (+/- 0, +/- 5 and +/- 10 degrees C), diurnal fluctuations had opposite effects on mean growth rates at low versus high mean temperature.

Additionally, to remedy the potential limitation imposed by the ability of mother mice to dissipate excess heat, we exposed them to an ambient temperature of 17 degrees C during the most energetically demanding second week of lactation. We found that the mice selected for high BMR produced significantly more milk in a 24 h period in both reproductive bouts. The milk samples obtained from the high BMR females had lower protein concentration and did not differ with respect to fat. However, the concentration of the primary milk carbohydrate - lactose - was higher. Although all the above between-line differences were statistically significant, their magnitude was too small to unambiguously ascribe them as stemming from a positive genetic correlation between the physiological traits underlying BMR and lactation performance. Nevertheless, our study lends such support at least at the level of phenotypic variation.",2015,10.1242/jeb.111245,218,2,249-254,NA,Milk output; Milk composition; Basal metabolic rate; Selection experiment; Endothermy evolution
article,Increased homeothermy during reproduction in a basal placental mammal,"Levesque, Danielle L. and Lovegrove, Barry G.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Homeothermic endothermy, the maintenance of a high and stable body temperature (T-b) using heat produced by elevated metabolism, is energetically expensive. There is increasing evidence that the earliest endotherms were heterotherms that, rather than maintaining strict homeothermy, allowed T-b to fluctuate with large variations between active and rest- phase T-b. The high level of homeothermy observed in modern mammals is therefore likely to have evolved from an ancestral heterothermic state. One of the hypotheses for the evolution of endothermy is that homeothermy allows for greater energetic output during reproduction (parental care model). We tested this hypothesis by measuring metabolic rates over a range of ambient temperatures in both reproductive and non- reproductive greater hedgehog tenrecs (Setifer setosus), a physiologically primitive mammal from Madagascar. Tenrecs have some of the lowest metabolic rates and highest levels of T-b variability of any mammal and are therefore good models of the ancestral eutherian state. During pregnancy and lactation, there was an increase in metabolism and Tb below the thermoneutral zone, accompanied by a decrease in T-b variability. The lower critical limit of the thermoneutral zone was estimated at similar to 25 degrees C. However, whereas increases in resting metabolism were substantial below 20 degrees C (up to 150\% higher during reproduction), daytime rest-phase ambient temperatures at the study site rarely reached equivalent low levels. Thus, S. setosus provide an example for how relatively low-cost increases in homeothermy could have led to substantial increases in fitness by allowing for the faster production of young. The mechanisms necessary for increases in thermogenesis during reproduction would have further benefited the development of homeothermy in mammals.",2014,10.1242/jeb.098848,217,9,1535-1542,NA,Evolution of endothermy; Parental care hypothesis; Thermoregulation; Reproduction; Torpor; Madagascar; Setifer setosus; Tenrecinae

Titus and Choi, Jongeun and Li, Weiming",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Secondary sexual characters in animals are exaggerated ornaments or weapons for intrasexual competition. Unexpectedly, we found that a male secondary sexual character in sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) is a thermogenic adipose tissue that instantly increases its heat production during sexual encounters. This secondary sexual character, developed in front of the anterior dorsal fin of mature males, is a swollen dorsal ridge known as the `rope' tissue. It contains nerve bundles, multivacuolar adipocytes and interstitial cells packed with small lipid droplets and mitochondria with dense and highly organized cristae. The fatty acid composition of the rope tissue is rich in unsaturated fatty acids. The cytochrome c oxidase activity is high but the ATP concentration is very low in the mitochondria of the rope tissue compared with those of the gill and muscle tissues. The rope tissue temperature immediately rose up to 0.3 degrees C when the male encountered a conspecific. Mature males generated more heat in the rope and muscle tissues when presented with a mature female than when presented with a male (paired t-test, P<0.05). On average, the rope generated 0.027 +/- 0.013 W cm(-3) more heat than the muscle in 10 min. Transcriptome analyses revealed that genes involved in fat cell differentiation are upregulated whereas those involved in oxidative-phosphorylation-coupled ATP synthesis are downregulated in the rope tissue compared with the gill and muscle tissues.

article,Operative temperature analysis of the honey bee <i>Apis</i> <i>mellifera</i>,"Stupski, Stanley D. and Schilder, Rudolf J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"A key challenge for linking experiments of organisms performed in a laboratory environment to their performance in more complex environments is to determine thermal differences between a laboratory and the energetically complex terrestrial ecosystem. Studies performed in the laboratory do not account for many factors that contribute to the realized temperature of an organism in its natural environment. This can lead to modelling approaches that use experimentally derived data to erroneously link the air temperature in a laboratory to air temperatures in energetically heterogenous ecosystems. Traditional solutions to this classic problem assume that animals in an isotropic, isothermal chamber behave either as pure heterothermic ectotherms (body temperature=chamber temperature) or homeothermic endotherms (body temperature is entirely independent of chamber temperature). This approach may not be appropriate for endothermic insects which exist as an intermediate between strongly thermoregulating endotherms and purely thermoconforming species. Here, we use a heat budget modelling approach for the honey bee Apis mellifera to demonstrate that the unique physiology of endothermic insects may challenge many assumptions of traditional biophysical modelling approaches. We then demonstrate under modelled field-realistic scenarios that an experiment performed in a laboratory has the potential to both overestimate and underestimate the temperature of foraging bees when only air temperature is considered.",2021,10.1242/jeb.231134,224,14,NA,jeb231134,Thermal ecology; Heat budget modelling; Heat transfer; Dynamic energy budget

Investigation of the pressure, volume, temperature (PVT) relationships for liver oils of 10 species of deep-sea Chondrichthyes shows that the density difference between oil and seawater, Delta rho, remains almost constant with pressure down to full ocean depth (11 km, 1100 bar), theoretically providing buoyancy far beyond the maximum depth of occurrence (3700 m) of sharks. However, Delta rho does change significantly with temperature and we show that the combined effects of pressure and temperature can decrease buoyancy of oil by up to 10\% between the surface and 3500 m depth across interfaces between warm southern and cold polar waters in the Rockall Trough in the NE Atlantic. This increases drag more than 10-fold compared with neutral buoyancy during horizontal slow swimming (0.1 m s(-1)), but the effect becomes negligible at high speeds. Chondrichthyes generally experience positive buoyancy change during ascent and negative buoyancy change during descent, but contrary effects can occur at interfaces between waters of different densities. During normal vertical migrations buoyancy changes are small, increasing slow-speed drag no more than 2- to 3-fold.

Measurements included: mass, oxygen consumption ((V) over dot(O2)), heart rate, blood oxygen content and affinity and blood flow distribution at 50\%, 70\% and 90\% of the incubation period. Body mass increased exponentially, paralleled by increased cardiac mass and metabolic rate. Heart rate was constant from 50\% to 70\% incubation but was significantly reduced at 90\% incubation. Hematocrit and hemoglobin concentration were constant at the three points of development studied but arteriovenous difference doubled from 50\% to 90\% incubation. Oxygen affinity was lower for the early 50\% incubation group (stage 19) compared with all other age groups. Blood flow was directed predominantly to the embryo but was highest to the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) at 70\% incubation and was directed away from the yolk as it was depleted at 90\% incubation. The findings indicate that the plateau or reduction in egg ((V) over dot(O2))( )characteristic of the late incubation period of turtle embryos may be related to an overall reduction in mass-specific ((V) over dot(O2))( )that is correlated with decreasing relative heart mass and plateaued CAM blood flow. Importantly, if the blood properties remain unchanged prior to hatching, as they did during the incubation period studied in the current investigation, this could account for the pattern of ((V) over dot(O2))( ) previously reported for embryonic snapping turtles prior to hatching.",2018,10.1242/jeb.185967,221,18,NA,jeb185967,Cardiovascular; Blood oxygen content; Cardiac output; Hemoglobin affinity; Reptile; Microsphere distribution
article,RNA thermosensors: how might animals exploit their regulatory potential?,"Somero, George N.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The secondary and tertiary orders of RNA structure are crucial for a suite of RNA-related functions, including regulation of translation, gene expression and RNA turnover. The temperature sensitivity of RNA secondary and tertiary structures is exploited by bacteria to fabricate RNA thermosensing systems that allow a rapid adaptive response to temperature change. RNA thermometers (RNATs) present in non-coding regions of certain mRNAs of pathogenic bacteria enable rapid upregulation of translation of virulence proteins when the temperature of the bacterium rises after entering a mammalian host. Rapid upregulation of translation of bacterial heat-shock proteins likewise is governed in part by RNATs. Turnover of mRNA may be regulated by temperature-sensitive RNA structures. Whereas the roles of temperature-sensitive RNA structures similar to RNATs in Eukarya and Archaea are largely unknown, there would appear to be a potential for all taxa to adaptively regulate their thermal physiology through exploitation of RNA-based thermosensory responses akin to those of bacteria. In animals, these responses might include regulation of translation of stress-induced proteins, alternative splicing of messenger RNA precursors, differential expression of allelic proteins, modulation of activities of small non-coding RNAs, regulation of mRNA turnover and control of RNA editing. New methods for predicting, detecting and experimentally modifying RNA secondary structure offer promising windows into these fascinating aspects of RNA biochemistry. Elucidating whether animals too have exploited the types of RNA thermosensing tools that are used so effectively by bacteria seems likely to provide exciting new insights into the mechanisms of evolutionary adaptation and acclimatization to temperature.",2018,10.1242/jeb.162842,221,4,NA,jeb162842,RNA editing; RNA secondary structure; RNA thermometers; Temperature; Thermosensors

Moreno and Block, Carolina and Cruz, Felix B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Gravid female lizards often experience reduced thermal preferences and impaired locomotor performance. These changes have been attributed to the physical burden of the clutch, but some authors have suggested that they may be due to physiological adjustments. We compared the thermal biology and locomotor performance of the lizard Liolaemus wiegmannii 1 week before and 1 week after oviposition. We found that gravid females had a thermal preference 1 degrees C lower than that of non-gravid females. This was accompanied by a change in the thermal dependence of maximum running speed. The thermal optimum for locomotor performance was 2.6 degrees C lower before oviposition than after. At relatively low temperatures (22 and 26 degrees C), running speeds of females before oviposition were up to 31\% higher than for females after oviposition. However, at temperatures above 26 degrees C, females achieved similar maximum running speeds (similar to 1.5 m s - 1 ) regardless of reproductive stage. The magnitude of the changes in thermal parameters and locomotor performance of L. wiegmannii females was independent of relative clutch mass (clutches weighed up to 89\% of post-oviposition body mass). This suggests that the changes are not simply due to the clutch mass, but are also due to physiological adjustments. Liolaemus wiegmannii females simultaneously adjusted their own physiology in a short period in order to improve locomotor performance and allocated energy for embryonic development during late gravid stage. Our findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying life histories of lizards on the fast extreme of the slow-fast continuum, where physiological exhaustion could play an important role.",2024,10.1242/jeb.247506,227,12,NA,jeb247506,Liolaemus wiegmannii; Locomotor performance; Oviparity; Reproduction; Thermal biology

The rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is a putatively hypoxia-sensitive species found in rivers and estuaries that may routinely experience hypoxic events. Trout were exposed to one of four 135 h treatments in a swim-tunnel respirometer: (1) air-saturated control (20.7 kPa P-O2); (2) diel cycling O-2 (20.7-4.2 kPa P-O2 over 24 h); (3) acute hypoxia (130 h at 20.7 kPa P-O2 followed by 5 h at 4.2 kPa P-O2); and (4) the mean oxygen tension (12.4 kPa P-O2) experienced by the diel cycled fish. Some responses were similar in diel O-2 cycled and mean P(O2 )treated fish, but overall, exposure to ecologically representative diel hypoxia cycles improved hypoxia tolerance. Diel hypoxia-induced protective responses included increased inducible HSP70 concentration and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, as well as reduced plasma cortisol. Acclimation to diel hypoxia allowed metabolic rates to decline during hypoxia, reduced oxygen debt following subsequent exposures, and allowed fish to return to an anabolic phenotype. The data demonstrate that acute diel cycling hypoxia improves hypoxia tolerance in previously intolerant fish through the activation of cellular protective mechanisms and a reduction in metabolic O-2 requirements.",2019,10.1242/jeb.206045,222,14,NA,jeb206045,Intermittent hypoxia; HSP70; Anabolism; Preconditioning; AMP-activated protein

Sensory input in situ is a mosaic of both enrichment and stress, yet little is known about how multiple environmental factors interact to affect brain anatomical structures, circuits and cognitive function. In this study, we addressed these issues by testing the individual and combined effects of sub-adult thermal stress, larval density and early-adult living spatial enrichment on brain anatomy and olfactory associative learning in adult Drosophila melanogaster. In response to heat stress, the mushroom bodies (MBs) were the most volumetrically impaired among all of the brain structures, an effect highly correlated with reduced odor learning performance. However, MBs were not sensitive to either larval culture density or early-adult living conditions. Extreme larval crowding reduced the volume of the antennal lobes, optic lobes and central complex. Neither larval crowding nor early-adult spatial enrichment affected olfactory learning. These results illustrate that various brain structures react differently to environmental inputs, and that MB development and learning are highly sensitive to certain stressors (pre-adult hyperthermia) and resistant to others (larval crowding).",2018,10.1242/jeb.169375,221,1,NA,jeb169375,Brain plasticity; Stress; Enrichment; Environmental influence

We used an individual monitoring system to record body temperature and valve gaping behavior of rocky intertidal zone mussels (Mytilus califomianus). Thirty individuals were selected from two mussel beds (wave-exposed and wave-protected) that differ in thermal regime. Instrumented mussels were deployed at two intertidal heights (near the lower and upper edges of the mussel zone) and in a continuously submerged tidepool. Following a 23-day monitoring period, measures of oxidative damage to DNA and lipids, antioxidant capacities (catalase activity and peroxyl radical scavenging) and tissue contents of organic osmolytes were obtained from gill tissue of each individual. Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that inter-individual variation in cumulative thermal stress is a predominant driver of physiological variation. Thermal history over the outplant period was positively correlated with oxidative DNA damage. Thermal history was also positively correlated with tissue contents of taurine, a thermoprotectant osmolyte, and with activity of the antioxidant enzyme catalase. Origin site differences, possibly indicative of developmental plasticity, were only significant for catalase activity. Gaping behavior was positively correlated with tissue contents of two osmolytes. Overall, these results are some of the first to clearly demonstrate relationships between inter-individual variation in recent experience in the field and inter-individual physiological variation, in this case within mussel beds.

These species had plasma glucose levels of 5.1, 4.8, 0.9 and 0.5 mmol l(-1), respectively. Rates of glucose metabolism and lactate production were determined in isolated hearts perfused with medium containing physiological levels of glucose. Under normoxic conditions there was no significant difference in rates of either glucose metabolism (average 15 nmol g(-1) min(-1)) or lactate production (average 30 nmol g(-1) min(-1)) across species. Under hypoxia (12\% of air saturation) there were significant increases in rates of glucose metabolism and lactate production in hearts from Atlantic cod (glucose-130; lactate-663 nmol g(-1) min(-1)) and rainbow trout (glucose-103; lactate-774 nmol g(-1) min(-1)); however, there was no change in rate of glucose metabolism in hearts from either lumpfish or short-horned sculpin and only increases in lactate production to rates much lower than the other species. Furthermore, Atlantic cod hearts perfused with medium containing low non-physiological levels of glucose (0.5 mmol l(-1)) had the same rates of glucose metabolism under normoxic and hypoxic treatments.

Additionally, the existence of an endogenous rhythm in OCR was explored, and we examined whether it synchronized with tidal, diurnal or semidiurnal cycles. Unexpectedly, high OCRs were observed at low tide, during normoxia, in non-acclimated animals. Results from a second, longerexperiment under normoxic conditions suggested the presence of a tide-related metabolic rhythm, a response pattern not yet demonstrated for a burrowing decapod.

article,How does mitochondrial function relate to thermogenic capacity and basal metabolic rate in small birds?,"Milbergue, Myriam S. and Vezina, Francois and Desrosiers, Veronique and Blier, Pierre U.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"We investigated the role of mitochondrial function in the avian thermoregulatory response to a cold environment. Using black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) acclimated to cold (-10 degrees C) and thermoneutral (27 degrees C) temperatures, we expected to observe an upregulation of pectoralis muscle and liver respiratory capacity that would be visible in mitochondrial adjustments in cold-acclimated birds. We also predicted that these adjustments would correlate with thermogenic capacity (M-sum) and basal metabolic rate (BMR). Using tissue high-resolution respirometry, mitochondrial performance was measured as respiration rate triggered by proton leak and the activity of complex I (OXPHOSCI) and complex I+II (OXPHOSCI+CII) in the liver and pectoralis muscle. The activity of citrate synthase (CS) and cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) was also used as a marker of mitochondrial density. We found 20\% higher total CS activity in the whole pectoralis muscle and 39\% higher total CCO activity in the whole liver of cold-acclimated chickadees relative to that of birds kept at thermoneutrality. This indicates that cold acclimation increased overall aerobic capacity of these tissues. Msum correlated positively with mitochondrial proton leak in the muscle of cold-acclimated birds while BMR correlated with OXPHOSCI in the liver with a pattern that differed between treatments. Consequently, this study revealed a divergence in mitochondrial metabolism between thermal acclimation states in birds. Some functions of the mitochondria covary with thermogenic capacity and basal maintenance costs in patterns that are dependent on temperature and body mass.",2022,10.1242/jeb.242612,225,12,NA,jeb242612,Cold acclimation; Mitochondria; M-sum; Metabolic intensity; Oxidative phosphorylation; LEAK; Birds

In response to cold, smelt express anti-freeze proteins and the osmolytes glycerol, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and urea to avoid freezing. The physiological influences of these osmolytes are not well understood. Urea destabilizes proteins, while TMAO counteracts the protein-destabilizing forces of urea. The influence of glycerol on muscle function has not been explored. We examined the effects of urea, glycerol and TMAO through muscle mechanics experiments with treatments of the three osmolytes at physiological concentrations. Experiments were carried out at 10 degrees C. The contractile properties of fast-twitch muscle bundles were determined in physiological saline and in the presence of 50 mmol l(-1) urea, 50 mmol l(-1) TMAO and/or 200 mmol l(-1) glycerol in saline. Muscle exposed to urea and glycerol produced less force and displayed slower contractile properties. However, treatment with TMAO led to higher force and faster relaxation by muscle bundles. TMAO increased power production during cyclical activity, while urea and glycerol led to reduced oscillatory power output. When muscle bundles were exposed to a combination of the three osmolytes, they displayed little change in contraction kinetics relative to control, although power output under lower oscillatory conditions was enhanced while maximum power output was reduced. The results suggest that maintenance of muscle function in winter smelt requires a balanced combination of urea, glycerol and TMAO.",2016,10.1242/jeb.135269,219,7,1014-1021,NA,Muscle physiology; Power production; Cryoprotectant

Doxapram is used clinically to alleviate ventilatory depression in response to anaesthesia and acts primarily on the peripheral oxygen-sensitive chemoreceptors. Using this approach, we investigated the hypothesis that pulmonary ventilation is relatively modest in comparison to resting metabolic rate in crocodilians and equipped seven juvenile alligators with masks for concurrent determination of ventilation and oxygen uptake. Doxapram elicited a dose-dependent and up to fourfold rise in ventilation, primarily by increasing ventilatory frequency. The accompanying rise in oxygen uptake was very small; ventilation in resting animals constitutes no more than 5\% of resting metabolic rate. The conclusion that pulmonary ventilation is energetically cheap is consistent with earlier studies on alligators where ventilation was stimulated by hypoxia or hypercapnia.",2016,10.1242/jeb.135871,219,7,933-936,NA,Ventilatory response; Oxygen consumption; Cost of ventilation; Reptile; Ventilator stimulant; Chemoreceptor
article,mRNA degradation: an underestimated factor in steady-state transcript levels of cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase subunits?,"Bremer, Katharina and Moyes, Christopher D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Steady-state mRNA levels are determined by synthesis and degradation; however, changes in mRNA levels are usually attributed to transcription. For cytochrome c oxidase (COX), cold acclimation typically leads to an increase in COX activity while transcript levels for the nuclear-encoded subunits change non-stoichiometrically. Whether those patterns are caused by differences in subunit transcription rates, decay rates or both was not known. We assessed decay rates of transcripts for COX subunits, including representatives that decreased, increased in parallel with COX or increased in excess of COX. Low temperature reduced the decay rate of all transcripts; however, COX subunits displayed higher thermal sensitivity than housekeeping genes. The lower decay rates for COX transcripts might explain some of their increase in response to cold acclimation. The reason for the exaggerated transcript response of two subunits (COX6B-1 and COX7A-2) may be due to decreased decay. However, decay rate differences could not explain the patterns seen with another subunit that did not change in mRNA level with thermal acclimation (COX6A-2). Further, the decay patterns differed between two thermal acclimation experiments, which may explain some of the heterogeneity seen in fish studies. The differences in decay rates suggest that the lack of stoichiometry in mRNA levels is exacerbated by post-transcriptional mechanisms. Collectively, these results suggest that temperature-induced differences in COX subunit mRNA levels and deviations from stoichiometry between them may partially arise from subunit-specific sensitivities to degradation. We suggest that all subunits are controlled by transcription, and that exaggerated responses of some subunits are due to reduced decay rates.",2014,10.1242/jeb.100214,217,12,2212-2220,NA,COX activity; Fish; Post-transcriptional control; Thermal acclimation

To assess energy management and insect adaptation in response to cold, we measured mitochondrial activity and oxidative stress in muscle and fat body tissues from G. coquereliana under a fluctuating thermal regime (FTR; stressed at 4 degrees C for 3 h on 3 consecutive days, with or without 24 h recovery). Compared with our earlier work showing that a single exposure to cold significantly affects mitochondrial parameters, here, repeated exposure to cold triggered an acclimatory response, resulting in unchanged mitochondrial bioenergetics. Immediately after cold exposure, we observed an increase in the overall pool of ATP and a decrease in typical antioxidant enzyme activity. We also observed decreased activity of uncoupling protein 4 in muscle mitochondria. After 24 h of recovery, we observed an increase in expression of antioxidant enzymes in muscles and the fat body and a significant increase in the expression of UCP4 and HSP70 in the latter. This indicates that processes related to energy conversion and disturbance under cold stress may trigger different protective mechanisms in these tissues, and that these mechanisms must be activated to restore insect homeostasis. The mitochondrial parameters and enzymatic assays suggest that mitochondria are not affected during FTR but oxidative stress markers are decreased, and a 24 h recovery period allows for the restoration of redox and energy homeostasis, especially in the fat body. This confirms the crucial role of the fat body in intermediary metabolism and energy management in insects and in the response to repeated thermal stress.",2023,10.1242/jeb.246287,226,17,NA,jeb246287,UCP; HSP; Bioenergetics; ROS; Insect; Gromphadorhina coquereliana

Fluctuations in O2 present a major stressor, with hypoxia leading to a cascade of detrimental physiological changes that alter cell operations and ultimately induce death. Nonetheless, some species episodically tolerate near-anoxic environments, and have evolved mechanisms to sustain function even during extended hypoxic periods. While mitochondria are pivotal in central metabolism, their role in hypoxia tolerance remains ill defined. Given the vulnerability of the brain to hypoxia, mitochondrial function was tested in brain homogenates of three closely related triplefin species with varying degrees of hypoxia tolerance (Bellapiscis medius, Forsterygion lapillum and Forsterygion varium). High-resolution respirometry coupled with fluorometric measurements of mitochondrial membrane potential (mtMP) permitted assessment of differences in mitochondrial function and integrity in response to intermittent hypoxia and anoxia. Traditional steady-state measures of respiratory flux and mtMP showed no differences among species. However, in the transition into anoxia, the tolerant species B. medius and F. lapillum maintained mtMP at O2 pressures 7- and 4.4-fold lower, respectively, than that of the hypoxia-sensitive F. varium and exhibited slower rates of membrane depolarisation. The results indicate tolerance in these intertidal fish.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245926,226,16,NA,jeb245926,Anoxia; Reoxygenation; Mitochondria; Respirometry; Membrane potential; mtMP; Triplefin fish
article,Severe thermoregulatory deficiencies in mice with a deletion in the titin gene <i>TTN</i>,"Miyano, Carissa A. and Orezzoli, Santiago F. and Buck, C. Loren and Nishikawa, Kiisa C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Muscular dystrophy with myositis (mdm) mice carry a deletion in the N2A region of the gene for the muscle protein titin (TTN), shiver at low frequency, fail to maintain body temperatures (T-b) at ambient temperatures (T-a) <34 degrees C, and have reduced body mass and active muscle stiffness in vivo compared with wild-type (WT) siblings. Impaired shivering thermogenesis (ST) could be due to the mutated titin protein causing more compliant muscles. We hypothesized that non-shivering thermogenesis (NST) is impaired. To characterize the response to cold exposure, we measured T-b and metabolic rate (MR) of WT and mdm mice at four nominal temperatures: 20, 24, 29 and 34 degrees C. Subsequently, we stimulated NST with noradrenaline. Manipulation of T-a revealed an interaction between genotype and MR: mdm mice had higher MRs at 29 degrees C and lower MRs at 24 degrees C compared with WT mice. NST capacity was lower in mdm mice than in WT mice. Using MR data from a previous study, we compared MR of mdm mice with MR of Perognathus longimembris, a mouse species of similar body mass. Our results indicated low MR and reduced NST of mdm mice. These were more pronounced than differences between mdm and WT mice owing to body mass effects on MR and capacity for NST. Correcting MR using Q(10 )showed that mdm mice had lower MRs than size-matched P. longimembris, indicating that mutated N2A titin causes severe thermoregulatory defects at all levels. Direct effects of the titin mutation lead to lower shivering frequency. Indirect effects likely lead to a lower capacity for NST and increased thermal conductance through decreased body size.",2019,10.1242/jeb.198564,222,9,NA,jeb198564,Body temperature regulation; Non-shivering thermogenesis; Muscular dystrophy with myositis; Metabolism
article,Modeling the costs and benefits associated with the evolution of endothermy using a robotic python,"Brashears, J. Alex and Hoffman, Ty C. M. and DeNardo, Dale F.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Endothermy provides considerable benefits to an organism but requires large energy investment. To understand potential driving forces that would lead to the evolution of endothermy, it is important to understand the energy costs and potential benefits of intermediate steps between ectothermy and homeothermic endothermy as well as the influences of environmental conditions on energetic costs. However, efforts to examine intermediate conditions are greatly limited by the predominant natural dichotomy between ectothermy and endothermy. Facultative endothermy by brooding pythons provides a fortunate study system where endothermy is beneficial but not essential. As one cannot control the extent of energy investment in heat production by a female python, we created an artificial snake with controllable heating capability. This enabled us to determine the energetic costs of maintaining a clutch at a preferred temperature, and to determine the relative thermal benefit of limited energy-producing capability (i.e. 50\% of the required energy to maintain the preferred developmental temperature). We manipulated the pseudoserpent's clutch size (5, 10, 15 eggs), diel ambient temperature cycle (2, 4, 6 degrees C) and insulation (with and without) at each of these power levels: unlimited power, half required power and no power. We found no significant effect of clutch size on either power requirements or developmental temperature. Energy requirements increased with the amplitude of the diel cycle and decreased with the addition of insulation, while the quality of the thermal environment decreased with the amplitude of the diel cycle. Interestingly, the quality of the thermal environment also decreased with the addition of insulation. We discuss these results within the context of the reproductive model of the evolution of endothermy.",2017,10.1242/jeb.151886,220,13,2409-2417,NA,Facultative thermogenesis; Nest site selection; Parental care; Pseudoserpent

G. and Jensen, Frank B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In mammals, treatment with low doses of nitrite has a cytoprotective effect in ischemia/reperfusion events, as a result of nitric oxide formation and S-nitrosation of proteins. Interestingly, anoxia-tolerant lower vertebrates possess an intrinsic ability to increase intracellular nitrite concentration during anoxia in tissues with high myoglobin and mitochondria content, such as the heart. Here, we tested the hypothesis that red and white skeletal muscles develop different nitrite levels in crucian carp exposed to deep hypoxia and assessed whether this correlates with myoglobin concentration. We also tested whether liver, muscle and heart tissue possess nitrate reductase activity that supplies nitrite to the tissues during severe hypoxia. Crucian carp exposed to deep hypoxia (1< P-O2 < 3 mmHg) for 1 day increased nitrite in red musculature to more than double the value in normoxic fish, while nitrite was unchanged in white musculature. There was a highly significant positive correlation between tissue concentrations of nitrite and nitros(yl) ated compounds. Myoglobin levels were 7 times higher in red than in white musculature, but there was no clear correlation between nitrite and myoglobin levels. Finally, we found a low but significant nitrate reductase activity in liver and white muscle, but not in cardiomyocytes. Nitrate reduction was inhibited by allopurinol, showing that it was partly catalyzed by xanthine oxidoreductase.",2016,10.1242/jeb.149195,219,24,3875-3883,NA,Ethanol; Hypoxia; Nitrate reduction; Nitric oxide; Nitrite; Red muscle
article,Reduced L-type Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> current and compromised excitability induce loss of skeletal muscle function during acute cooling in locust,"Findsen, Anders and Overgaard, Johannes and Pedersen, Thomas Holm",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Low temperature causes most insects to enter a state of neuromuscular paralysis, termed chill coma. The susceptibility of insect species to chill coma is tightly correlated to their distribution limits and for this reason it is important to understand the cellular processes that underlie chill coma. It is known that muscle function is markedly depressed at low temperature and this suggests that chill coma is partly caused by impairment in the muscle per se. To find the cellular mechanism(s) underlying muscle dysfunction at low temperature, we examined the effect of low temperature (5 degrees C) on several events in excitation-contraction coupling in the migratory locust (Locusta migratoria). Intracellular membrane potential recordings during single nerve stimulations showed that 70\% of fibers at 20 degrees C produced an action potential (AP), while only 55\% of fibers were able to fire an AP at 5 degrees C. Reduced excitability at low temperature was caused by an similar to 80\% drop in L-type Ca2+ current and a depolarizing shift in its activation of around 20 mV, which means that a larger endplate potential would be needed to activate the muscle AP at low temperature. In accordance, we showed that intracellular Ca2+ transients were largely absent at low temperature following nerve stimulation. In contrast, maximum contractile force was unaffected by low temperature in chemically skinned muscle bundles, which demonstrates that the function of the contractile filaments is preserved at low temperature. These findings demonstrate that reduced L-type Ca2+ current is likely to be the most important factor contributing to loss of muscle function at low temperature in locust.",2016,10.1242/jeb.137604,219,15,2340-2348,NA,Chill coma; Neuromuscular dysfunction; Excitation-contraction coupling; Contractile force
article,Intraspecific variation in sensitivity to food availability and temperature-induced phenotypic plasticity in the rotifer <i>Keratella cochlearis</i>,"Ramos-Rodriguez, Eloisa and Moreno, Emilio and Maria Conde-Porcuna, Jose",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Organisms with wide environmentally induced morphological plasticity and cosmopolitan distribution, e.g. the common freshwater rotifer Keratella cochlearis, are ideal models to study the evolution of plastic polymorphisms and the capacity of zooplankton to adapt to local selection conditions. We investigated population-level differences (population-by-environment interaction) in sensitivity to food availability and temperature-induced phenotypic plasticity between two clones of K. cochlearis isolated from neighboring populations in Ruidera Natural Park (Spain) with different trophic statuses: Tinaja lake (mesotrophic) and Cueva Morenilla lake (eutrophic). Using common-garden experiments, each clone proved to have a different sensitivity to food availability, with substantial phenotypic differences between them. When rotifers grew at moderate temperature (15.6 degrees C), low food levels were more efficiently used by the Tinaja versus Cueva Morenilla clone, whereas high food levels were more efficiently used by the Cueva Morenilla versus Tinaja clone. The posterior spine was much longer and the lorica wider in the Tinaja versus Cueva Morenilla clone, with no difference in lorica length. Phylogenetic analysis based on cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene sequences showed that the two populations have the same haplotype. This is the first study to show possible local adaptation by a rotifer species to habitats that consistently differ in food availability. We also detected an intriguing deviation from the expected negative relationship between posterior spine length and temperature. Our experimental results indicate that intermediate temperatures may activate the gene responsible for spine elongation in K. cochlearis. This suggests that rotifers in nature could use water temperature as proxy signal of a change in predation risk before defense is needed.",2020,10.1242/jeb.209676,223,7,NA,jeb209676,Population-by-environment interaction; Proxy cue; Spine elongation; Trade-off
article,A neurophysiological limit and its biogeographic correlations: cold-induced spreading depolarization in tropical butterflies,"Andersen, Mads Kuhlmann and Willot, Quentin and MacMillan, Heath A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The physiology of insects is directly influenced by environmental temperature, and thermal tolerance is therefore intrinsically linked to their thermal niche and distribution. Understanding the mechanisms that limit insect thermal tolerance is crucial to predicting biogeography and range shifts. Recent studies on locusts and flies suggest that the critical thermal minimum (CTmin) follows a loss of CNS function via a spreading depolarization. We hypothesized that other insect taxa share this phenomenon. Here, we investigate whether spreading depolarization events occur in butterflies exposed to cold. Supporting our hypothesis, we found that exposure to stressful cold induced spreading depolarization in all 12 species tested. This reinforces the idea that spreading depolarization is a common mechanism underlying the insect CTmin. Furthermore, our results highlight how CNS function is tuned to match the environment of a species. Further research into the physiology underlying spreading depolarization will likely elucidate key mechanisms determining insect thermal tolerance and ecology.",2023,10.1242/jeb.246313,226,18,NA,jeb246313,Spreading depression; Cold tolerance; Chill coma; Lepidoptera; CTmin
article,How does the environment affect fighting? The interaction between extrinsic fighting ability and resource value during contests,"Lane, Sarah M. and Briffa, Mark",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"An individual's performance during a fight is influenced by a combination of their capacity and willingness to compete. While willingness to fight is known to be determined by both intrinsic and extrinsic drivers, an individual's capacity to fight is generally thought of as solely intrinsic, being driven by a host of physiological factors. However, evidence indicates that variation in fighting ability can also be generated through exposure to different environmental conditions. Environmental contributions to fighting ability may be particularly important for animals living in spatially and temporally heterogeneous habitats, in which fights can occur between rivals recently exposed to different environmental conditions. The rapidly changing environment experienced within intertidal zones, for example, means that seawater parameters, including dissolved oxygen content and temperature, can vary across small spatial and temporal scales. Here, we investigated the relative importance of these extrinsic contributions to fighting ability and resource value on contest dynamics in the beadlet sea anemone Actinia equina. We manipulated the extrinsic fighting ability of both opponents (through dissolved oxygen concentration prior to fights) and resource value (through seawater flow rate during the fight). Our results indicate that the extrinsic fighting ability of both opponents can interact with resource value to drive escalation patterns and that extrinsic drivers can be more important in determining contest dynamics than the intrinsic traits commonly studied. Our study highlights the need to combine data on intrinsic state and extrinsic conditions in order to gain a more holistic view of the factors driving contest behaviour.",2018,10.1242/jeb.187740,221,19,NA,jeb187740,Animal contests; Assessment; Fighting behaviour; Hypoxia; Resource holding potential; Resource value
article,Extracellular glucose supports lactate production but not aerobic metabolism in cardiomyocytes from both normoglycemic Atlantic cod and low glycemic short-horned sculpin,"Clow, Kathy A. and Short, Connie E. and Driedzic, William R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Fish exhibit a wide range of species-specific blood glucose levels. How this relates to glucose utilization is yet to be fully realized. Here, we assessed glucose transport and metabolism in myocytes isolated from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and short-horned sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpius), species with blood glucose levels of 3.7 and 0.57 mmol l(-1), respectively. Glucose metabolism was assessed by the production of (H2O)-H-3 from {[}2-H-3]glucose. Glucose metabolism was 3.5-to 6-fold higher by myocytes from Atlantic cod than by those from short-horned sculpin at the same level of extracellular glucose. In Atlantic cod myocytes, glucose metabolism displayed what appears to be a saturable component with respect to extracellular glucose, and cytochalasin B inhibited glucose metabolism. These features revealed a facilitated glucose diffusion mechanism that accounts for between 30\% and 55\% of glucose entry at physiological levels of extracellular glucose. Facilitated glucose diffusion appears to be minimal in myocytes for short-horned sculpin. Glucose entry by simple diffusion occurs in both cell types with the same linear relationship between glucose metabolism and extracellular glucose concentration, presumably due to similarities in membrane composition. Oxygen consumption by myocytes incubated in medium containing physiological levels of extracellular glucose (Atlantic cod 5 mmol l(-1), short-horned sculpin 0.5 mmol l(-1)) was similar in the two species and was not decreased by cytochalasin B, suggesting that these cells have the capability of oxidizing alternative on-board metabolic fuels. Cells produced lactate at low rates but glycogen levels did not change during the incubation period. In cells from both species, glucose utilization assessed by both simple chemical analysis of glucose disappearance from the medium and (H2O)-H-3 production was half the rate of lactate production and as such extracellular glucose was not available for oxidative metabolism. Overall, extracellular glucose makes only a minor contribution to ATP production but a sustained glycolysis may be necessary to support Ca2+ transport mechanisms at either the sarcoplasmic reticulum or the sarcolemmal membrane.",2016,10.1242/jeb.132720,219,9,1384-1393,NA,Gadus morhua; Myoxocephalus scorpius; ATP production; Cytochalasin B; Facilitated glucose diffusion; Glucose metabolism; Heart cells; Lactate production

We addressed the interactive effects of developmental age and NO in the control of piscine breathing by measuring the ventilatory response of zebrafish (Danio rerio) adults and larvae to NO donors and by inhibiting endogenous production of NO. In adults, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a NO donor, inhibited ventilation; the extent of the ventilatory inhibition was related to the pre-existing ventilatory drive, with the greatest inhibition exhibited during exposure to hypoxia (P-O2 = 5.6 kPa). Inhibition of endogenous NO production using L-NAME suppressed the hypoventilatory response to hyperoxia, supporting an inhibitory role of NO in adult zebrafish. Neuroepithelial cells (NECs), the putative oxygen chemoreceptors of fish, contain neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). In zebrafish larvae at 4 days post-fertilization, SNP increased ventilation in a concentration-dependent manner. Inhibition of NOS activity with L-NAME or knockdown of nNOS inhibited the hypoxic (P-O2 = 3.5 kPa) ventilatory response. Immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of nNOS in the NECs of larvae. Taken together, these data suggest that NO plays an inhibitory role in the control of ventilation in adult zebrafish, but an excitatory role in larvae.",2015,10.1242/jeb.127795,218,23,3746-3753,NA,Chemoreceptor; Hypoxia; Hyperoxia; Immunohistochemistry; Neuroepithelial cell; Morpholino

Crucian carp appear to exploit this mechanism by upregulating nitrite and other nitrite/NO metabolites (S-nitroso and iron-nitrosyl compounds) in several tissues when exposed to anoxia. We investigated whether this is a common strategy amongst anoxiatolerant vertebrates by evaluating NO metabolites in red-eared slider turtles during long-term (9 days) anoxia and subsequent reoxygenation at low temperature, a situation naturally encountered by turtles in ice-covered ponds. We also measured glutathione in selected tissues and assessed the impact of anoxia on electrolyte status. Anoxia induced major increases in {[}nitrite] in the heart, pectoral muscle and red blood cells, while {[}nitrite] was maintained unaltered in brain and liver. Concomitantly, the concentrations of Snitroso and iron-nitrosyl compounds increased, showing that nitrite was used to produce NO and to S-nitrosate cellular molecules during anoxia. The changes were gradually reversed during reoxygenation (1 h and 24 h), testifying that the processes were reversible. The increased NO bioavailability occurred in the absence of NO synthase activity (due to global anoxia) and may involve mobilization of internal/external nitrite reservoirs. Our data support the theory that anoxic upregulation of nitrite and other NO metabolites could be a general cytoprotective strategy amongst anoxia-tolerant vertebrates. The possible mechanisms of nitrite-derived NO and S-nitrosation in protecting cells from destructive Ca2+ influx during anoxia and in limiting ROS formation during reoxygenation are discussed.",2014,10.1242/jeb.093179,217,3,423-431,NA,Anoxia; Cytoprotection; Nitric oxide; Nitrite; Reoxygenation
article,Novel approaches for assessing acclimatization in birds reveal seasonal changes in peripheral heat exchange and thermoregulatory behaviors,"Zuluaga, Juan D. and Danner, Raymond M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Using thermography and behavioral analyses, we found that heat exchange and thermoregulatory behaviors changed seasonally in chipping sparrows (Spizella passerina). Studies on seasonal acclimatization in birds have primarily involved metabolic measurements, few of which have investigated behaviors, and none have investigated changes in peripheral heat exchange. We captured chipping sparrows in the winter and summer of 2022 in Wilmington, North Carolina, USA, and we collected thermal images of these birds at 15.0, 27.5 and 40.0 degrees C. We found that heat dissipation through the bill and legs changed seasonally, but surprisingly both were higher in winter than in summer. We found that heat dissipating behaviors were more common in winter, whereas heat conserving behaviors were more common in summer, and that behaviors associated with resource costs (e.g. panting) or predation risk (e.g. bill tucking) showed the most distinct differences between seasons. Meanwhile, low-cost and low-risk postural adjustments (e.g. feather adjustments and tarsus exposure) did not vary as strongly between seasons but followed similar trends. The seasonal adjustments to behaviors suggest that non-acclimatized birds must use costly thermoregulatory behaviors more frequently than acclimatized birds. The use of thermography resulted in the discovery of one completely novel behavior, and the first detection of a known behavior in a new species. Both novel behaviors aided in evaporative heat loss and occurred more commonly in winter, supporting the presence of seasonal acclimatization as evidenced by behavioral adjustments. These results provide novel insights into the process of acclimatization and suggest a role for behavioral adjustments in seasonal acclimatization.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245772,226,18,NA,jeb245772,Ecophysiology; Thermal imaging; Thermoregulation; Thermovascular physiology; Behavior
article,Pit viper thermography: the pit organ used by crotaline snakes to detect thermal contrast has poor spatial resolution,"Clark, Rulon W. and Bakken, George S. and Reed, Evan J. and Soni, Ashana",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Pit vipers detect infrared radiation by means of temperature contrasts created on their pit organ membranes. Signals from pit organs integrate with visual signals in the optic tectum, leading to the conjecture that the facial pits operate as an extension of the visual system. Because similar mechanisms underlie thermal imaging technology, imagery from thermal cameras is often used to infer how pit vipers perceive their environment. However, pit organs lack a focusing mechanism, and biophysical models predict that pit organs should have poor spatial resolution compared with thermal imaging cameras. Nevertheless, behavioral studies occasionally suggest pits may have better resolution than predicted by biophysical models, indicating that processing in the central nervous system may improve imaging. To estimate the spatial resolution of the neural image informing behavior, we recorded snake responses evoked by targets moving across backgrounds composed of two contrasting temperatures with an average temperature equal to the target temperature. An unresolved background would appear uniform; thus, the target would be detectable only if the background pattern were resolved. Western rattlesnakes (Crotalus oreganus) displayed no statistically significant responses to targets presented in front of patterned backgrounds, regardless of the temperature contrasts or spatial frequencies within the background, but responded strongly to targets presented in front of homogeneous backgrounds. We found no evidence that the pit organ system can resolve spatial details subtending an angle of 9 deg or less.

The alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata, overwinters as a prepupa inside a brood cell, resuming development in spring. During these immobile stages of development, bees must tolerate unfavorable temperatures. In this study, we tested howexposure to low temperature stress during development affects subsequent reproduction and characteristics of the F1 generation. Developing male and female M. rotundata were exposed to either constant (6 degrees C) or fluctuating (1 h day(-1) at 20 degrees C) low temperature stress for 1 week, during the pupal stage, to mimic a spring cold snap. Treated adults were marked and released into field cages, and reproductive output was compared with that of untreated control bees. Exposure to low temperatures during the pupal stage had mixed effects on reproduction and offspring characteristics. Females treated with fluctuating low temperatures were more likely to nest compared with control bees or those exposed to constant low temperature stress. Sublethal effects may have contributed to low nesting rates of bees exposed to constant low temperatures. Females from that group that were able to nest had fewer, larger offspring with high viability, suggesting a trade-off. Interestingly, offspring of bees exposed to fluctuating low temperatures were more likely to enter diapause, indicating that thermal history of parents, even during development, is an important factor in diapause determination.",2021,10.1242/jeb.243242,224,22,NA,jeb243242,Trade-offs; Solitary bees; Sublethal effects; Megachile rotundata; Low temperature stress; Insect development

Orexins participate in the regulation of many physiological functions, and their role as wake-promoting molecules has been widely described. Less is known about the involvement of orexins in body temperature and respiratory regulation. The aim of this study was to investigate if orexin peptides modulate respiratory regulation as a function of ambient temperature (T-a) during different sleep stages. Respiratory phenotype of male orexin knockout (KO-ORX, N=9) and wild-type (WT, N=8) mice was studied at thermoneutrality (T-a=30 degrees C) or during mild cold exposure (T-a=20 degrees C) inside a whole-body plethysmography chamber. The states of wakefulness (W), non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) and rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) were scored non-invasively, using a previously validated technique. In both WT and KO-ORX mice, T-a strongly and significantly affected ventilatory period and minute ventilation values during NREMS and REMS; moreover, the occurrence rate of sleep apneas in NREMS was significantly reduced at T-a=20 degrees C compared with T-a=30 degrees C. Overall, there were no differences in respiratory regulation during sleep between WT and KO-ORX mice, except for sigh occurrence rate, which was significantly increased at T-a=20 degrees C compared with T-a=30 degrees C in WT mice, but not in KO-ORX mice. These results do not support a main role for orexin peptides in the temperature-dependent modulation of respiratory regulation during sleep.

In this framework, the development of a protocol for the appetitive conditioning of the maxilla-labium extension response (MaLER) provided the possibility of studying Pavlovian odor-food learning in a controlled environment. Here we extend these studies by introducing the first Pavlovian aversive learning protocol for harnessed ants in the laboratory. We worked with carpenter ants Camponotus aethiops and first determined the capacity of different temperatures applied to the body surface to elicit the typical aversive mandible opening response (MOR). We determined that 75 degrees C is the optimal temperature to induce MOR and chose the hind legs as the stimulated body region because of their high sensitivity. We then studied the ability of ants to learn and remember odor-heat associations using 75 degrees C as the unconditioned stimulus. We studied learning and short-term retention after absolute (one odor paired with heat) and differential conditioning (a punished odor versus an unpunished odor). Our results show that ants successfully learn the odor-heat association under a differential-conditioning regime and thus exhibit a conditioned MOR to the punished odor. Yet, their performance under an absolute-conditioning regime is poor. These results demonstrate that ants are capable of aversive learning and confirm previous findings about the different attentional resources solicited by differential and absolute conditioning in general.",2017,10.1242/jeb.161737,220,24,4661-4668,NA,Aversive conditioning; Camponotus; Mandible opening response; Thermal stimulation

We and others recently discovered a novel mediator of skeletal muscle-based thermogenesis called sarcolipin (SLN) that acts by uncoupling sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA). In addition, we have shown that SLN expression is downregulated during neonatal development in rats. In this study we probed two questions: (1) is SLN expression developmentally regulated in neonatal mice?; and (2) if so, will cold adaptation override this? Our data show that SLN expression is higher during early neonatal stages and is gradually downregulated in fast twitch skeletal muscles. Interestingly, we demonstrate that cold acclimation of neonatal mice can prevent downregulation of SLN expression.

article,Phenotype manipulations confirm the role of pectoral muscles and haematocrit in avian maximal thermogenic capacity,"Petit, Magali and Vezina, Francois",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In small resident bird species living at northern latitudes, winter cold acclimatization is associated with an increase in pectoral muscle size and haematocrit level, and this is thought to drive the seasonal increase in summit metabolic rate ((M) over dot(sum), a measure of maximal shivering thermogenic capacity). However, evidence suggesting that pectoral muscle size influences (M) over dot(sum) is correlational and the link between haematrocrit level and (M) over dot(sum) remains to be demonstrated. We experimentally tested the relationship between pectoral muscle size and (M) over dot(sum) by manipulating muscle size using a feather clipping protocol in free-living wintering black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus). This also allowed us to investigate the link between haematocrit and thermogenic capacity. After a first series of measures on all birds, we cut half of the flight feathers of experimental individuals (N=14) and compared their fat and pectoral muscle scores, (M) over dot(sum) and haematocrit level at recapture with their previous measures and with those of control birds (N=17) that were captured and recaptured at comparable times. Results showed that: (1) experimental birds developed larger pectoral muscles than control individuals and (2) mass-independent (M) over dot(sum) was up to 16\% higher in birds expressing large pectoral muscles. (M) over dot(sum) was also positively correlated with haematocrit, which was not affected by the experimental manipulation. These findings demonstrate that, for a given body mass, large pectoral muscles are associated with a higher (M) over dot(sum) in black-capped chickadees and that oxygen carrying capacity likely supports thermogenesis in this species.",2014,10.1242/jeb.095703,217,6,824-830,NA,Summit metabolic rate; Shivering; Metabolic performance; Feather clipping; Haematocrit
article,"RNA interference of glycerol biosynthesis suppresses rapid cold hardening of the beet armyworm, <i>Spodoptera exigua</i>","Park, Youngjin and Kim, Yonggyun",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua, is a freeze-susceptible species that overwinters in temperate zones without diapause. A rapid cold hardening (RCH) and supercooling capacity usually play crucial roles in survival during the overwintering period. This study identified a cryoprotectant as a RCH factor of S. exigua. Pre-exposure of S. exigua larvae to 4 degrees C significantly increased survival at -10 degrees C in all developmental stages from egg to adult. RCH was dependent on the duration of the pre-exposure period. RCH also significantly enhanced the supercooling capacity. Cryoprotectant analysis using HPLC showed that the pre-exposure treatment allowed the larvae to accumulate glycerol in the hemolymph. Two genes, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) and glycerol kinase (GK), were identified as being associated with glycerol biosynthesis, and were cloned from S. exigua larvae. Both GPDH and GK were expressed in all developmental stages of S. exigua. RNA interference (RNAi) of either GPDH or GK significantly inhibited glycerol accumulation in the hemolymph of S. exigua.

article,Feeding through your gills and turning a toxicant into a resource: how the dogfish shark scavenges ammonia from its environment,"Wood, Chris M. and Giacomin, Marina",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Nitrogen (N) appears to be a limiting dietary resource for elasmobranchs, required not only for protein growth but also for urea-based osmoregulation. Building on recent evidence that the toxicant ammonia can be taken up actively at the gills of the shark and made into the valuable osmolyte urea, we demonstrate that the uptake exhibits classic Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics with an affinity constant (K-m) of 379 mu mol l(-1), resulting in net N retention at environmentally realistic ammonia concentrations (100-400 mu mol l(-1)) and net N loss through stimulated urea-N excretion at higher levels. Ammonia-N uptake rate increased or decreased with alterations in seawater pH, but the changes were much less than predicted by the associated changes in seawater P-NH3, and more closely paralleled changes in seawater NH4+ concentration. Ammonia-N uptake rate was insensitive to amiloride (0.1 mmol l(-1)) or to a 10-fold elevation in seawater K+ concentration (to 100 mmol l(-1)), suggesting that the mechanism does not directly involve Na+ or K+ transporters, but was inhibited by blockade of glutamine synthetase, the enzyme that traps ammonia-N to fuel the ornithine-urea cycle. High seawater ammonia inhibited uptake of the ammonia analogue {[}C-14] methylamine. The results suggest that branchial ammonia-N uptake may significantly supplement dietary N intake, amounting to about 31\% of the nitrogen acquired from the diet. They further indicate the involvement of Rh glycoproteins (ammonia channels), which are expressed in dogfish gills, in normal ammonia-N uptake and retention.",2016,10.1242/jeb.145268,219,20,3218-3226,NA,Elasmobranch; Urea; Ornithine-urea cycle; Rh proteins; Methylamine; Glutamine synthetase

Among the sound-generating fish, Gobiidae, a large fish family with 1866 valid species, is one of the most studied groups of acoustic fishes, with sound production being documented in a number of species. Paradoxically, the sound-producing mechanism remains poorly studied in this group. The painted goby, Pomatoschistus pictus, produces two distinct sounds called drums and thumps. A combination of morphological and experimental analyses involving high-speed videos synchronized with sound recordings supports that drums are produced during lateral head movements involving at least the alternate contractions of the levator pectoralis muscles originating on the skull and inserting on the pectoral girdle. These movements are reported in many Gobiidae species, suggesting the pectoral-girdle-based mechanism is common in the family and could have evolved from locomotory movements.",2017,10.1242/jeb.164863,220,23,4374-4376,NA,Acoustic; Communication; Gobiidae; Gobionellinae

Low M-b was not a prerequisite for torpor use and M-b loss did not correlate with either heterothermy index or torpor use.

In aquatic ecosystems, n-3 LCPUFAs are produced by phytoplankton and bioaccumulate in the food web. Alarmingly, the warming and acidification of aquatic systems caused by climate change impair n-3 LCPUFA production, with an anticipated decrease of 80\% by the year 2100. We tested whether n-3 LCPUFA consumption affects the physiology, morphology, behaviour and cognition of the chicks of a top marine predator, the ring-billed gull. Using a colony with little access to n-3 LCPUFAs, we supplemented siblings from 22 fenced nests with contrasting treatments from hatching until fledging; one sibling received n-3 LCPUFA-rich fish oil and the other, a control sucrose solution without n-3 LCPUFAs. Halfway through the nestling period, half the chicks receiving fish oil were switched to the sucrose solution to test whether n-3 LCPUFA intake remains crucial past the main growth phase (chronic versus transient treatments). Upon fledging, n-3 LCPUFAs were elevated in the blood and brains of chicks receiving the chronic treatment, but were comparable to control levels among those receiving the transient treatment. Across the entire sample, chicks with elevated n-3 LCPUFAs in their tissues fledged earlier despite their morphology and activity levels being unrelated to fledging age. Fledging required chicks to escape fences encircling their nest. We therefore interpret fledging age as a possible indicator of cognition, with chicks with improved cognition fledging earlier. These results provide insight into whether declining dietary n-3 LCPUFAs will compromise top predators' problem-solving skills, and thus their ability to survive in a rapidly changing world.",2021,10.1242/jeb.235929,224,4,NA,jeb235929,Bird; Brain development; Essential fatty acid; Docosahexaenoic acid; Eicosapentaenoic acid; Aquatic ecosystem
article,Evaluating the role of NRF-1 in the regulation of the goldfish <i>COX4-1</i> gene in response to temperature,"Gao, Ge and Moyes, Christopher D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Cold acclimation in fish typically increases muscle mitochondrial enzymes. In mammals, stressors that increase mitochondrial content are mediated though transcriptional regulators, including nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1). Focusing on the goldfish gene for cytochrome c oxidase (COX) subunit 4-1, we analysed the regulatory regions in various contexts to identify a mechanistic link between NRF-1 and cold-induced mitochondrial proliferation. Promoter analysis implicated two putative NRF-1 sites: one in the proximal promoter and a second in exon 1, which encodes the 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR). Transfection into mouse myoblasts showed that deletion of a region that included the proximal NRF-1 site reduced promoter activity by 30\%; however, mutagenesis of the specific sequence had no effect. Thermal sensitivity analyses performed in rainbow trout gonadal fibroblasts (RTG-2) showed no effect of temperature (4 vs 19 degrees C) on reporter gene expression. Likewise, reporters injected into muscle of thermally acclimated goldfish (4 vs 26 degrees C) showed no elevation in expression. There was no difference in thermal responses of COX4-1 promoter reporters constructed from homologous regions of eurythermal goldfish and stenothermal zebrafish genes. NRF-1 chromatin immunoprecipitation of thermally acclimated goldfish muscle showed no temperature effect on NRF-1 binding to either the proximal promoter or 5'-UTR. It remains possible that the cold-induced upregulation of COX4-1 expression is a result of NRF-1 binding to distal regulatory regions or through indirect effects on other transcription factors. However, the proximal promoter does not appear to play a role in mediating the thermal response of the COX4-1 gene in fish.",2016,10.1242/jeb.141184,219,19,3019-3027,NA,Mitochondria; Oxidative phosphorylation; Goldfish; Thermal acclimation; Bioenergetics; Nuclear respiratory factor 1

A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Using implanted archival tags, we examined the effects of meal caloric value, food type (sardine or squid) and ambient temperature on the magnitude and duration of the heat increment of feeding in three captive juvenile Pacific bluefin tuna. The objective of our study was to develop a model that can be used to estimate energy intake in wild fish of similar body mass. Both the magnitude and duration of the heat increment of feeding (measured by visceral warming) showed a strong positive correlation with the caloric value of the ingested meal. Controlling for meal caloric value, the extent of visceral warming was significantly greater at lower ambient temperature. The extent of visceral warming was also significantly higher for squid meals compared with sardine meals. By using a hierarchical Bayesian model to analyze our data and treating individuals as random effects, we demonstrate how increases in visceral temperature can be used to estimate the energy intake of wild Pacific bluefin tuna of similar body mass to the individuals used in our study.

Gerardo and Juan Flores-Martinez, Jose",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Flying vertebrates, such as bats, face special challenges with regards to the throughput and digestion of food. On the one hand, as potentially energy-limited organisms, bats must ingest and assimilate energy efficiently in order to satisfy high resting and active metabolic demands. On the other hand, the assimilation of nutrients must be accomplished using a digestive tract that is, compared with that of similarly sized non-flying vertebrates, significantly shorter. Despite these competing demands, and the relative breadth of dietary diversity among bats, little work has been done describing the cost of digestion, termed `specific dynamic action' (SDA). Here, we provide the first systematic assessment of the SDA response in a bat, the fish-eating myotis (Myotis vivesi). Given the shorter digestive tract and the relatively higher resting and active metabolic rates of bats in general, and based on anecdotal published evidence, we hypothesized that the SDA response in fish-eating myotis would be dependent on meal size and both significantly more brief and intense than in small, non-flying mammals. In agreement with our hypothesis, we found that the peak metabolic rate during digestion, relative to rest, was significantly higher in these bats compared with any other mammals or vertebrates, except for some infrequently eating reptiles and amphibians. Additionally, we found that the magnitude and duration of the SDA response were related to meal size. However, we found that the duration of the SDA response, while generally similar to reported gut transit times in other small bats, was not substantially shorter than in similarly sized non-flying mammals.",2015,10.1242/jeb.115964,218,8,1180-1187,NA,Specific dynamic action; Bat; Oxygen consumption; Metabolic cost

Inhabiting the intertidal rocky shore, a key interface of the ocean, atmosphere and terrestrial environments, intertidal species have developed variable thermal adaptation mechanisms; however, adaptions at the RNA level remain largely uninvestigated. To examine the relationship between mRNA structural stability and species distribution, in the present study, the secondary structure of cytosolic malate dehydrogenase (cMDH) mRNA of Echinolittorina malaccana, Echinolittorina radiata and Littorina brevicula was determined using selective 2 `-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE), and the change in folding free energy of formation (AGfold) was calculated. The results showed that AGfold increased as the temperature increased. The difference in AGfold (AAGfold) between two specific temperatures (25 versus 0 degrees C, 37 versus 0 degrees C and 57 versus 0 degrees C) differed among the three species, and the AAGfold value of E. malaccana was significantly lower than those of E. radiata and L. brevicula. The number of stems of cMDH mRNA of the snails decreased with increasing temperature, and the breakpoint temperature of E. malaccana was the highest among these. The number of loops was also reduced with increasing temperature, while the length of the loop structure increased accordingly. Consequently, these structural changes can potentially affect the translational efficiency of mRNA. These results imply that there were interspecific differences in the thermal stability of RNA secondary structures in intertidal snails, and these differences may be related to snail distribution.",2023,10.1242/jeb.246544,226,20,NA,jeb246544,Intertidal snails; cMDH; mRNA stability; RNA secondary structure; SHAPE; Thermal limits

Malagasy common tenrecs, Tenrec ecaudatus, have many plesiomorphic traits and may represent a basal placental mammal. We established a laboratory population of T. ecaudatus and found extreme plasticity in thermoregulation and metabolism, a novel hibernation form, variable annual timing, and remarkable growth and reproductive biology. For instance, tenrec body temperature (T-b) may approximate ambient temperature to as low as 12 degrees C even when tenrecs are fully active. Conversely, tenrecs can hibernate with Tb of 28 degrees C. During the active season, oxygen consumption may vary 25-fold with little or no change in T-b. During the austral winter, tenrecs are consistently torpid but the depth of torpor may vary. A righting assay revealed that T-b contributes to but does not dictate activity status. Homeostatic processes are not always linked, e.g. a hibernating tenrec experienced a similar to 34\% decrease in heart rate while maintaining constant body temperature and oxygen consumption rates. Tenrec growth rates vary but young may grow similar to 40-fold in the 5 weeks until weaning and may possess indeterminate growth as adults. Despite all of this profound plasticity, tenrecs are surprisingly intolerant of extremes in ambient temperature (<8 or >34 degrees C). We contend that while plasticity may confer numerous energetic advantages in consistently moderate environments, environmental extremes may have limited the success and distribution of plastic basal mammals.",2018,10.1242/jeb.185900,221,20,NA,jeb185900,Thermoregulation; Oxygen consumption; Variable body temperature
article,Shifts in space and time: ecological transitions affect the evolution of resting metabolic rates in microteiid lizards,"Bars-Closel, Melissa and Camacho, Agustin and Kohlsdorf, Tiana",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Ecological diversification often encompasses exposure to new thermal regimes given by the use of specific spatial (microhabitat) and temporal (activity periods) niches. Empirical evidence provides links between temperature and physiology (e.g. rates of oxygen consumption), fostering predictions of evolutionary changes in metabolic rates coupled with ecological shifts. One example of such correspondence is the evolution offossoriality and nocturnality in vertebrate ectotherms, where changes in metabolic rates coupled with niche transitions are expected. Because most studies address single transitions (fossoriality or nocturnality), metabolic changes associated with concomitant shifts in spatial and temporal components of habitat usage are underestimated, and it remains unclear which transition plays a major role for metabolic evolution. Integrating multiple ecological aspects that affect the evolution of thermosensitive traits is essential for a proper understanding of physiological correlates in niche transitions. Here, we provide the first phylogenetic multidimensional description of effects from ecological niche transitions both in space (origin of fossorial lineages) and in time (origin of nocturnal lineages) on the evolution of microteiid lizard (Gymnophthalmidae) metabolic rates. We found that evolution of resting metabolic rates was affected by both niche transitions, but with opposite trends. Evolution of fossoriality in endemic diurnal microteiids is coupled with a less thermally sensitive metabolism and higher metabolic rates. In contrast, a reduction in metabolic rates was detected in the endemic fossorial-noctumal lineage, although metabolic thermal sensitivity remained as high as that observed in epigeal species, a pattern that likely reduces locomotion costs at lower temperatures and also favors thermoregulation in subsuperficial sand layers.",2018,10.1242/jeb.175661,221,14,NA,NA,Fossorial; Gymnophthalmidae; Metabolism; Nocturnal; Squamata; Temperature
article,Parental thermal environment alters offspring sex ratio and fitness in an oviparous lizard,"Schwanz, Lisa E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The environment experienced by parents can impact the phenotype of their offspring (parental effects), a critical component of organismal ecology and evolution in variable or changing environments. Although temperature is acentral feature of the environment forectotherms, its role in parental effects has been little explored until recently. Here, parental basking opportunity was manipulated in an oviparous lizard with temperature-dependent sex determination, the jacky dragon (Amphibolurus muricatus). Eggs were incubated at a temperature that typically produces a 50: 50 sex ratio, and hatchlings were reared in a standard thermal environment. Offspring of parents in short bask conditions appeared to have better fitness outcomes in captive conditions than those of parents in long bask conditions -they had greater growth and survival as a function of their mass. In addition, the sex of offspring (male or female) depended on the interaction between parental treatment and egg mass, and treatment impacted whether sons or daughters grew larger in their first season. The interactive effects of treatment on offspring sex and growth are consistent with adaptive explanations for the existence of temperature-dependent sex determination in this species. Moreover, the greater performance recorded in short bask offspring may represent an anticipatory parental effect to aid offspring in predicted conditions of restricted thermal opportunity. Together, these responses constitute a crucial component of the population response to spatial or temporal variation in temperature.",2016,10.1242/jeb.139972,219,15,2349-2357,NA,Basking behaviour; Environmental sex determination; Maternal effects; Reproductive investment; Sex allocation; Thermal ecology; Thermoregulation

H. and Schulte, Patricia M. and Miller, Kristi M. and Farrell, Anthony P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"We examined cardiac pacemaker rate resetting in rainbow trout following a reciprocal temperature transfer. In the original experiment, performed in winter, 4 degrees C-acclimated fish transferred to 12 degrees C reset intrinsic heart rate after just 1 h (from 56.8 +/- 1.2 to 50.8 +/- 1.5 beats min(-1)); 12 degrees C-acclimated fish transferred to 4 degrees C reset intrinsic heart rate after 8 h (from 33.4 +/- 0.7 to 37.7 +/- 1.2 beats min(-1)). However, in a replicate experiment, performed in the summer using a different brood year, intrinsic heart rate was not reset, even after 10 weeks at a new temperature. Using this serendipitous opportunity, we compared mRNA expression changes of a suite of proteins in sinoatrial node (SAN), atrial and ventricular tissues after both 1 h and longer than 3 weeks for both experimental acclimation groups to identify those changes only associated with pacemaker rate resetting. Of the changes in mRNA expression occurring after more than 3 weeks of warm acclimation and associated with pacemaker rate resetting, we observed downregulation of NKA alpha 1c in the atrium and ventricle, and upregulation of HCN1 in the ventricle. However, in the SAN there were no mRNA expression changes unique to the fish with pacemaker rate resetting after either 1 h or 3 weeks of warm acclimation. Thus, despite identifying changes in mRNA expression of contractile cardiac tissues, there was an absence of changes in mRNA expression directly involved with the initial, rapid pacemaker rate resetting with warm acclimation.

As global temperatures are changing at an increasing rate, there is urgency to understand the compensatory abilities of key organs such as the heart to adjust under natural conditions. Thus, the aim of the present study was to directly compare the acclimatization and acclimatory response within a single eurythermal fish species, the European shorthorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpio). We used current- and voltage-clamp to measure ionic current densities in both isolated atrial and ventricular myocytes from three groups of fish: (1) summer-caught fish kept at 12 degrees C ('summer-acclimated); (2) summer-caught fish kept at 3 degrees C ('cold acclimated'); and (3) fish caught in March ('winteracclimatized'). At a common test temperature of 7.5 degrees C, action potential (AP) was shortened by both winter acclimatization and cold acclimation compared with summer acclimation; however, winter acclimatization caused a greater shortening than did cold acclimation. Shortening of AP was achieved mostly by a significant increase in repolarizing current density (I-Kr and I-k1) following winter acclimatization, with cold acclimation having only minor effects. Compared with summer acclimation, the depolarizing L-type calcium current (I-Ca) was larger following winter acclimatization, but again, there was no effect of cold acclimation on I-Ca. Interestingly, the other depolarizing current. I-Na, was downregulated at low temperatures. Our further analysis shows that ionic current remodelling is primarily due to changes in ion channel density rather than current kinetics. In summary, acclimatization profoundly modified the electrical activity of the sculpin heart while acclimation to the same temperature for >1.5 months produced very limited remodelling effects.",2019,10.1242/jeb.202242,222,16,NA,jeb202242,Heart; Action potential; Electrophysiology; Hypertrophy; Thermal remodelling; Myoxocephalus scorpio

Metabolic imbalances, disruptions in ion homeostasis and oxidative stress contribute to the increased mortality of chill-injured insects. Interestingly, survival can be significantly increased when chill-susceptible insects are exposed to a daily warm-temperature pulse during chilling. We hypothesize that warm pulses allow for the repair of damage associated with chill injury. Here, we describe transcriptional responses during exposure to a fluctuating thermal regime, relative to constant chilled temperatures, during pupal development in the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata, using a combination of RNA-seq and qPCR. Pupae were exposed to either a constant, chilled temperature of 6 degrees C, or 6 degrees C with a daily pulse of 20 degrees C for 7 days. RNA-seq after experimental treatment revealed differential expression of transcripts involved in construction of cell membranes, oxidation-reduction and various metabolic processes. These mechanisms provide support for shared physiological responses to chill injury across taxa. The large number of differentially expressed transcripts observed after 7 days of treatment suggests that the initial divergence in expression profiles between the two treatments occurred upstream of the time point sampled. Additionally, the differential expression profiles observed in this study show little overlap with those differentially expressed during temperature stress in the diapause state of M. rotundata.

Though photoperiodic modulation has been well studied, temperature modulation of dormancy has received less attention. Here, we leverage genetic variation in diapause in the apple maggot fly, Rhagoletis pomonella, to test whether gene expression during winter or following spring warming regulates diapause duration. We used RNAseq to compare transcript abundance during and after simulated winter between an apple-infesting population and a hawthorn-infesting population where the apple population ends pupal diapause earlier than the hawthorn-infesting population. Marked differences in transcription between the two populations during winter suggests that the `early' apple population is developmentally advanced compared with the `late' hawthorn population prior to spring warming, with transcripts participating in growth and developmental processes relatively up-regulated in apple pupae during the winter cold period. Thus, regulatory differences during winter ultimately drive phenological differences that manifest themselves in the following summer. Expression and polymorphism analysis identify candidate genes in the Wnt and insulin signaling pathways that contribute to population differences in seasonality. Both populations remained in diapause and displayed a pattern of up-and then down-regulation (or vice versa) of growth-related transcripts following warming, consistent with transcriptional repression. The ability to repress growth stimulated by permissive temperatures is likely critical to avoid mismatched phenology and excessive metabolic demand.

article,Seasonality influences cuticle melanization and immune defense in a cricket: support for a temperature-dependent immune investment hypothesis in insects,"Fedorka, Kenneth M. and Copeland, Emily K. and Winterhalter, Wade E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"To improve thermoregulation in colder environments, insects are expected to darken their cuticles with melanin via the phenoloxidase cascade, a phenomenon predicted by the thermal melanin hypothesis. However, the phenoloxidase cascade also plays a significant role in insect immunity, leading to the additional hypothesis that the thermal environment indirectly shapes immune function via direct selection on cuticle color. Support for the latter hypothesis comes from the cricket Allonemobius socius, where cuticle darkness and immune-related phenoloxidase activity increase with latitude. However, thermal environments vary seasonally as well as geographically, suggesting that seasonal plasticity in immunity may also exist. Although seasonal fluctuations in vertebrate immune function are common (because of flux in breeding or resource abundance), seasonality in invertebrate immunity has not been widely explored. We addressed this possibility by rearing crickets in simulated summer and fall environments and assayed their cuticle color and immune function. Prior to estimating immunity, crickets were placed in a common environment to minimize metabolic rate differences. Individuals reared under fall-like conditions exhibited darker cuticles, greater phenoloxidase activity and greater resistance to the bacteria Serratia marcescens. These data support the hypothesis that changes in the thermal environment modify cuticle color, which indirectly shapes immune investment through pleiotropy. This hypothesis may represent a widespread mechanism governing immunity in numerous systems, considering that most insects operate in seasonally and geographically variable thermal environments.",2013,10.1242/jeb.091538,216,21,4005-4010,NA,temperature-dependent immunity; plasticity; seasonality; phenoloxidase; lytic; ecoimmunology

Terrestrial locomotion in balitorids is unlike that of any known fish: the locomotion resembles that of terrestrial tetrapods. Emergence and convergence of terrestrial locomotion from water to land has been studied in fossils; however, studying balitorid walking provides a present-day natural laboratory to examine the convergent evolution of walking movements. We tested the hypothesis that balitorid species with more robust connections between the pelvic and axial skeleton (M3 morphotype) are more effective at walking than species with reduced connectivity (M1 morphotype). We predicted that robust connections would facilitate travel per step and increase mass support during movement. We collected high-speed video of walking in seven balitorid species to analyze kinematic variables. The connection between internal anatomy and locomotion on land are revealed herein with digitized video analysis, mu CT scans, and in the context of the phylogenetic history of this family of fishes. Our species sampling covered the extremes of previously identified sacral rib morphotypes, M1 and M3. Although we hypothesized the robustness of the sacral rib to have a strong influence on walking performance, there was not a large reduction in walking ability in the species with the least modified rib (M1). Instead, walking kinematics varied between the two balitorid subfamilies with a generally more `walk-like' behavior in the Balitorinae and more `swim-like' behavior in the Homalopteroidinae. The type of terrestrial locomotion displayed in balitorids is unique among living fishes and aids in our understanding of the extent to which a sacral connection facilitates terrestrial walking.",2022,10.1242/jeb.242906,225,6,NA,jeb242906,Terrestrial excursion; Rheophilic; Fish locomotion; Hillstream loaches
article,Endocrine regulation of carbonate precipitate formation in marine fish intestine by stanniocalcin and PTHrP,"Gregorio, Silvia F. and Carvalho, Edison S. M. and Campinho, Marco A. and Power, Deborah M. and Canario, Adelino V. M. and Fuentes, Juan",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In marine fish, high epithelial bicarbonate secretion by the intestine generates luminal carbonate precipitates of divalent cations that play a key role in water and ion homeostasis. In vitro studies highlight the involvement of the calciotropic hormones PTHrP (parathyroid hormone-related protein) and stanniocalcin (STC) in the regulation of epithelial bicarbonate transport. The present study tested the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in carbonate precipitate formation in vivo. Sea bream (Sparus aurata) juveniles received single intraperitoneal injections of piscine PTHrP(1-34), the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7-34) or purified sea bream STC, or were passively immunized with polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against sea bream STC (STC-Ab). Endocrine effects on the expression of the basolateral sodium bicarbonate cotransporter (Slc4a4.A), the apical anion exchangers Slc26a6.A and Slc26a3.B, and the V-type proton pump beta-subunit (Atp6v1b) in the anterior intestine were evaluated. In keeping with their calciotropic nature, the hypocalcaemic factors PTHrP(7-34) and STC upregulated gene expression of all transporters. In contrast, the hypercalcaemic factor PTHrP(1-34) and STC antibodies downregulated transporters involved in the bicarbonate secretion cascade. Changes in intestine luminal precipitate contents provoked by calcaemic endocrine factors validated these results: 24 h postinjection either PTHrP(1-34) or immunization with STC-Ab reduced the carbonate precipitate content in the sea bream intestine. In contrast, the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7-34) increased not only the precipitated fraction but also the concentration of HCO3 equivalents in the intestinal fluid. These results confirm the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in carbonate precipitate formation in vivo in the intestine of marine fish. Furthermore, they illustrate for the first time in fish the counteracting effect of PTHrP and STC, and reveal an unexpected contribution of calcaemic factors to acid-base balance.",2014,10.1242/jeb.098517,217,9,1555-1562,NA,Intestinal physiology; Calcium regulation; Bicarbonate secretion; Ion transporter; Endocrine regulation; Calciotropic hormones
article,Small heat shock protein Hsp67Bc plays a significant role in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> cold stress tolerance,"Malkeyeva, Dina and Kiseleva, Elena and Fedorova, Svetlana",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Hsp67Bc in Drosophila melanogaster is a member of the small heat shock protein family, the main function of which is to prevent the aggregation of misfolded or damaged proteins. Hsp67Bc interacts with Starvin and Hsp23, which are known to be a part of the cold stress response in the fly during the recovery phase. In this study, we investigated the role of the Hsp67Bc gene in the cold stress response. We showed that in adult Drosophila, Hsp67Bc expression increases after cold stress and decreases after 1.5 h of recovery, indicating the involvement of Hsp67Bc in short-term stress recovery. We also implemented a deletion in the D. melanogaster Hsp67Bc gene using imprecise excision of a P-element, and analysed the cold tolerance of Hsp67Bc-null mutants at different developmental stages. We found that Hsp67Bc-null homozygous flies are viable and fertile but display varying cold stress tolerance throughout the stages of ontogenesis: the survival after cold stress is slightly impaired in late third instar larvae, unaffected in pupae, and notably affected in adult females. Moreover, the recovery from chill coma is delayed in Hsp67Bc-null adults of both sexes. In addition, the deletion in the Hsp67Bc gene caused more prominent up-regulation of Hsp70 following cold stress, suggesting the involvement of Hsp70 in compensation of the lack of the Hsp67Bc protein. Taken together, our results suggest that Hsp67Bc is involved in the recovery of flies from a comatose state and contributes to the protection of the fruit fly from cold stress.",2020,10.1242/jeb.219592,223,21,NA,jeb219592,Cold stress; Drosophila; Hsp67Bc; Small heat shock proteins

Naked mole rats (NMRs) are among the most hypoxia-tolerant mammals and reduce metabolic rate in hypoxic environments; however, little is known regarding mitochondrial function during in vivo hypoxia exposure in this species. To address this knowledge gap, we asked whether the function of NMR brain mitochondria exhibits metabolic plasticity during acute hypoxia. Respirometry was utilized to assess whole-animal oxygen consumption rates and high-resolution respirometry was utilized to assess electron transport system (ETS) function in saponin-permeabilized NMR brain. We found that NMR whole-animal oxygen consumption rate reversibly decreased by similar to 85\% in acute hypoxia (4 h at 3\% O-2). Similarly, relative to untreated controls, permeabilized brain respiratory flux through the ETS was decreased by similar to 90\% in acutely hypoxic animals. Relative to carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoro-methoxyphenylhydrazone-uncoupled total ETS flux, this functional decrease was observed equally across all components of the ETS except for complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase), at which flux was further reduced, supporting a regulatory role for this enzyme during acute hypoxia. The maximum enzymatic capacities of ETS complexes I-V were not altered by acute hypoxia; however, the mitochondrial H+ gradient decreased in step with the decrease in ETS respiration. Taken together, our results indicate that NMR brain ETS flux and H+ leak are reduced in a balanced and regulated fashion during acute hypoxia.

article,FRET analysis using sperm-activating peptides tagged with fluorescent proteins reveals that ligand-binding sites exist as clusters,"Arcos-Hernandez, Cesar and Romero, Francisco and Sanchez-Guevara, Yoloxochitl and Beltran, Carmen and Nishigaki, Takuya",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Long-range cellular communication between the sperm and egg is critical for external fertilization. Sperm-activating peptides (SAPs) are diffusible components of the outer layer of eggs in echinoderms, and function as chemoattractants for spermatozoa. The decapeptide named speract is the best-characterized sea urchin SAP. Biochemical and physiological actions of speract have been studied with purified or chemically synthesized peptides. In this work, we prepared recombinant speract fused to a fluorescent protein (FP; FP-speract) using three color variants: a cyan (eCFP), a yellow (mVenus) and a large Stokes shift yellow (mAmetrine) FP. Although these fluorescence tags are 20 times larger than speract, competitive binding experiments using mAmetrine-speract revealed that this FP-speract has binding affinity to the receptor that is comparable (7.6-fold less) to that of non-labeled speract. Indeed, 10 nmol l(-1) eCFP-speract induces physiological sperm responses such as membrane potential changes and increases in intracellular pH and Ca2+ concentrations similar to those triggered by 10 nmol l(-1) speract. Furthermore, FP-speract maintains its fluorescence upon binding to its receptor. Using this property, we performed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements with eCFP-speract and mVenus-speract as probes and obtained a positive FRET signal upon binding to the receptor, which suggests that the speract receptor exists as an oligomer, at least as a dimer, or alternatively that a single speract receptor protein possesses multiple binding sites. This property could partially account for the positive and/or negative cooperative binding of speract to the receptor.",2016,10.1242/jeb.127662,219,4,508-515,NA,Recombinant peptide ligand; Fluorescence resonance energy transfer; Receptor; Speract
article,Carbonic anhydrases are influenced by the size and symbiont identity of the aggregating sea anemone <i>Anthopleura elegantissima</i>,"Koch, Jack Cushman and Verde, E. Alan and Weis, Virginia M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Carbonic anhydrases (CA; EC 4.2.1.1) play a vital role in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) transport to photosynthetic microalgae residing in symbiotic cnidarians. The temperate sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima can occur in three symbiotic states: hosting Breviolum muscatinei (brown), hosting Elliptochloris marina (green) or without algal symbionts (aposymbiotic). This provides a basis for A. elegantissima to be a model for detailed studies of the role of CA in DIC transport. This study investigated the effects of symbiosis, body size and light on CA activity and expression. and suggests that A. elegantissima has a heterotrophy-dominated trophic strategy. We identified putative A. elegantissima CA genes and performed phylogenetic analyses to infer subcellular localization in anemones. We performed experiments on field-collected anemones to compare: (1) CA activity and expression from anemones in different symbiotic states, (2) CA activity in brown anemones as a function of size, and (3) CA activity in anemones of different symbiotic states that were exposed to different light intensities. CA activity in brown anemones was highest, whereas activity in green and aposymbiotic anemones was low. Several CAs had expression patterns that mirrored activity, while another had expression that was inversely correlated with activity, suggesting that symbionts may induce different DIC transport pathways. Finally, CA activity was inversely correlated with anemone size. Our results suggest that the observed CA activity and expression patterns are affected not only by symbiosis, but also by other factors in the host physiology, including trophic strategy as it relates to body size and cellular pH homeostasis.",2020,10.1242/jeb.221424,223,13,NA,jeb221424,Breviolum muscatinei; Sea anemone; Elliptochloris marina; Dissolved inorganic carbon transport; Symbiosis; Cnidarian

We assessed how this pathway is modified to allow Na+ secretion in hypersaline environments. Mummichogs (Fundulus heteroclitus) acclimated to hypersaline {[}2(x) seawater (2SW), 64 parts per thousand] for 30 days developed invasive projections of accessory cells with an increased area of tight junctions, detected by punctate distribution of CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) immunofluorescence and transmission electron miscroscopy of the opercular epithelia, which form a gill-like tissue rich in ionocytes. Distribution of CFTR was not explained by membrane raft organization, because chlorpromazine (50 mu mol l(-1)) and filipin (1.5 mu mol l(-1)) did not affect opercular epithelia electrophysiology. Isolated opercular epithelia bathed in SW on the mucosal side had a transepithelial potential (V-t) of +40.1 +/- 0.9 mV (N = 24), sufficient for passive Na+ secretion (Nernst equilibrium voltage = E-Na = +24.11 mV). Opercular epithelia from fish acclimated to 2SW and bathed in 2SW had higher V-t of +45.1 +/- 1.2 mV (N = 24), sufficient for passive Na+ secretion (E-Na = +40.74 mV), but with diminished net driving force. Bumetanide block of Cl-secretion reduced V-t by 45\% and 29\% in SW and 2SW, respectively, a decrease in the driving force for Na+ extrusion.

Here, we trained snowflake morays, Echidna nebulosa, to undulate out of the aquatic environment to feed on land. On land, snowflake morays remove prey from the substrate by biting and swallow prey using pharyngeal jaw enabled transport. Although snowflake morays exhibit smaller jaw rotation angles on land when apprehending their prey, transport kinematics involving dorsoventral flexion of the head to protract the pharyngeal jaws and overall feeding times did not differ between terrestrial and aquatic treatments.

Examination and manipulation of temporomandibular joints (TMJs) in fresh carcasses, plus CT scans and field/lab mechanical testing of excised tissue blocks, reveals that the TMJ's fibrocartilage pad fully and quickly rebounds after shrinking by 68-88\% in compression (by axis) and stretching 176-230\%. It is more extensible along the mediolateral axis and less extensible dorsoventrally, but mostly isotropic, with collagen and elastin fibers running in all directions. The rorqual TMJ pad compresses as gape increases.

article,On how whales avoid decompression sickness and why they sometimes strand,"Blix, Arnoldus Schytte and Walloe, Lars and Messelt, Edward B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Whales are unique in that the supply of blood to the brain is not by the internal carotid arteries, but by way of thoracic and intra-vertebral arterial retia. We found in the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) that these retia split up into smaller anastomosing vessels and thin-walled sinusoid structures that are embedded in fat. The solubility of nitrogen is at least six times larger in fat than in water, and we suggest that nitrogen in supersaturated blood will be absorbed in the fat, by diffusion, during the very slow passage of the blood through the arterial retia. Formation of nitrogen bubbles that may reach the brain is thereby avoided. We also suggest that mass stranding of whales may be due to disturbances to their normal dive profiles, resulting in extra release of nitrogen that may overburden the nitrogen `trap' and allow bubbles to reach the brain and cause abnormal behavior.",2013,10.1242/jeb.087577,216,18,3385-3387,NA,harbor porpoise; Phocoena phocoena; whale; Cetacea; rete; diving

It provides real-time measurement of sphere acceleration along three axes and can be used to obtain an accurate stimulation trace. We applied digital filtering to equalize the frequency response of the vibrating sphere, which also reduced unwanted amplitude and frequency changes in the hydrodynamic signal.

The highly ammonia-sensitive salmonid Oncorhynchus mykiss (rainbow trout), the less ammonia-sensitive cyprinid Cyprinus carpio (common carp) and the highly ammonia-resistant cyprinid Carassius auratus (goldfish) were exposed chronically (12-168 h) to 1 mmol l(-1) ammonia (as NH4HCO3; pH 7.9). During HEA exposure, carp and goldfish elevated ammonia excretion (J(Amm)) and Na+ influx rates (J(in)(Na)) while trout experienced higher plasma ammonia (T-Amm) and were only able to restore control rates of JAmm and J(in)(Na). All three species exhibited increases in Na+ efflux rate (J(out)(Na)). At the molecular level, there was evidence for activation of a `Na+/NH4+ exchange metabolon' probably in response to elevated plasma cortisol and TAmm, though surprisingly, some compensatory responses preceded molecular responses in all three species. Expression of Rhbg, Rhcg (Rhcg-a and Rhcg-b), H+-ATPase (V-type, B-subunit) and Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) mRNA was upregulated in goldfish, Rhcg-a and NKA in carp, and Rhcg2, NHE-2 (Na+/H+ exchanger) and H+-ATPase in trout. Branchial H+-ATPase activity was elevated in goldfish and trout, and NKA activity in goldfish and carp, but NKA did not appear to function preferentially as a Na+/NH4+-ATPase in any species. Goldfish alone increased urea excretion rate during HEA, in concert with elevated urea transporter mRNA expression in gills.

A flavanol contained in chocolate, epicatechin (Epi), has been shown to enhance long-term memory (LTM) formation in Lymnaea. Combining two stressors (low-calcium pond water and crowding) blocks learning and all forms of memory; that is, this combination of environmentally relevant stressors creates a memory-unfriendly state. We tested the hypothesis that Epi will immediately reverse the memory-unfriendly state, i.e. that snails in the memory-deficit state when trained in Epi will immediately become competent to learn and form memory. We found that Epi not only reverses the memory-deficit state but also further enhances LTM formation. Thus, a naturally occurring bioactive plant compound can overcome a memory-unfriendly state.

Garden eels exhibit an exceptional lifestyle: feeding on drifting zooplankton while being `anchored' in a burrow they dig in the sand. Using underwater observations, sampling and three-dimensional video recording, we measured the feeding rates and characterized feeding postures of garden eels under a wide range of current speeds. We show that the eels behaviorally resolve the trade-off between adverse biomechanical forces and beneficial fluxes of food by modulating their body postures according to current speeds. In doing so, the eels substantially reduce drag forces when currents are strong, yet keep their head well above bottom in order to effectively feed under conditions of high prey fluxes.

We illustrate the utility of this approach with kinematic measurements of a walking cockroach (Gromphadorhina portentosa) and calculations of the pressure field around a swimming fish (Danio rerio). In both, transmitted illumination generated high-contrast images of the animal's body in one channel.

article,King penguins can detect two odours associated with conspecifics,"Cunningham, Gregory B. and Bonadonna, Francesco",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Recent studies on olfaction in penguins have focused on their use of odours while foraging. It has been proposed for some seabirds that an olfactory landscape shaped by odours coming from feeding areas exists. Islands and colonies, however, may also contribute to the olfactory landscape and may act as an orienting map. To test sensitivities to a colony scent we studied whether King penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) could detect the smell of sand, feathers or feces by holding presentations beneath their beaks while they naturally slept on the beach. Penguins had a significantly greater response to the feathers and feces presentations than to sand. Although only a first step in exploring a broader role of olfaction in this species, our results raise the possibility of olfaction being used by King penguins in three potential ways: (1) locating the colony from the water or the shore, (2) finding the rendezvous zone within the colony where a chick or partner may be found, or (3) recognizing individuals by scent, as in Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus demersus).",2015,10.1242/jeb.128298,218,21,3374-3376,NA,King penguin; Olfaction; Conspecific odours

Accurately quantifying their continuous body's 3-D shape and motion is important for understanding body-environment interactions in complex terrain, but this is difficult to achieve (especially for local orientation and rotation). Here, we describe an interpolation method to quantify continuous body 3-D position and orientation. We simplify the body as an elastic rod and apply a backbone optimizationmethod to interpolate continuous body shape between end constraints imposed by tracked markers. Despite over-simplifying the biomechanics, our method achieves a higher interpolation accuracy (similar to 50\% error) in both 3-D position and orientation compared with the widely used cubic B-spline interpolation method. Beyond snakes traversing large obstacles as demonstrated, our method applies to other long, slender, limbless animals and continuum robots.

article,Bone conduction pathways confer directional cues to salamanders,"Capshaw, G. and Christensen-Dalsgaard, J. and Soares, D. and Carr, C. E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Sound and vibration are generated by mechanical disturbances within the environment, and the ability to detect and localize these acoustic cues is generally important for survival, as suggested by the early emergence of inherently directional otolithic ears in vertebrate evolutionary history. However, fossil evidence indicates that the water-adapted ear of early terrestrial tetrapods lacked specialized peripheral structures to transduce sound pressure (e.g. tympana). Therefore, early terrestrial hearing should have required nontympanic (or extratympanic) mechanisms for sound detection and localization. Here, we used atympanate salamanders to investigate the efficacy of extratympanic pathways to support directional hearing in air. We assessed peripheral encoding of directional acoustic information using directionally masked auditory brainstem response recordings. We used laser Doppler vibrometry to measure the velocity of sound pressure-induced head vibrations as a key extratympanic mechanism for aerial sound reception in atympanate species. We found that sound generates head vibrations that vary with the angle of the incident sound. This extratympanic pathway for hearing supports a figure-eight pattern of directional auditory sensitivity to airborne sound in the absence of a pressure-transducing tympanic ear.",2021,10.1242/jeb.243325,224,20,NA,jeb243325,Amphibian; Hearing; Extratympanic; Sound localization
article,A subset of brain neurons controls regurgitation in adult <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>,"Chen, Yu-Chieh David and Ahmad, Sameera and Amin, Kush and Dahanukar, Anupama",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Taste is essential for animals to evaluate food quality and make important decisions about food choice and intake. How complex brains process sensory information to produce behavior is an essential question in the field of sensory neurobiology. Currently, little is known about higher-order taste circuits in the brain as compared with those of other sensory systems. Here, we used the common vinegar fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to screen for candidate neurons labeled by different transgenic GAL4 lines in controlling feeding behaviors. We found that activation of one line (VT041723-GAL4) produces `proboscis holding' behavior (extrusion of the mouthpart without withdrawal). Further analysis showed that the proboscis holding phenotype indicates an aversive response, as flies pre-fed with either sucrose or water prior to neuronal activation exhibited regurgitation. Anatomical characterization of VT041723GAL4-labeled neurons suggests that they receive sensory input from peripheral taste neurons. Overall, our study identifies a subset of brain neurons labeled by VT041723-GAL4 that may be involved in a taste circuit that controls regurgitation.",2019,10.1242/jeb.210724,222,19,NA,jeb210724,Proboscis; Feeding behaviors; Neuronal circuits; Taste; GAL4/UAS

Here, using high-accuracy GPS data, we studied repeated journeys made by wild plains zebra (Equus quagga) through a naturally vegetated environment to explore whether they consistently follow the same route through the area or whether they use a range of routes to reach their goal. We used a model to distinguish and quantify these two possibilities and show that our observations are consistent with the use of multiple routes. Our model performs better than assuming a uniform angular distribution of trajectories. The typical separation of the routes was found to be small (1.96 m), while the scale at which neighbouring trajectories are informative to direction of travel was found to be large (with a confidence interval of 1.19-26.4 m).

Instead, they must prioritize how they spend limiting resources on the many processes they rely on in their lives. Among others, they are thought to economize on the maintenance and repair processes required for survival in favour of maximizing reproduction, with ageing as a consequence. We investigate the biological mechanisms of neuronal ageing. Using Lymnaea stagnalis, we have previously described various aspects of age-associated neuronal decline and appetitive long-term memory failure. In view of postulated trade-offs between somatic maintenance and reproduction, we tested for interactions between resource allocation mechanisms and brain function.

article,"Mechanisms of transepithelial ammonia excretion and luminal alkalinization in the gut of an intestinal air-breathing fish, <i>Misgurnus anguilliacaudatus</i>","Wilson, Jonathan M. and Moreira-Silva, Joana and Delgado, Ines L. S. and Ebanks, Sue C. and Vijayan, Mathilakath M. and Coimbra, Joao and Grosell, Martin",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The weatherloach, Misgurnus angulliacaudatus, is an intestinal air-breathing, freshwater fish that has the unique ability to excrete ammonia through gut volatilization when branchial and cutaneous routes are compromised during high environmental ammonia or air exposure. We hypothesized that transepithelial gut NH4+ transport is facilitated by an apical Na+/H+ (NH4+) exchanger (NHE) and a basolateral Na+/K+(NH4+)-ATPase, and that gut boundary layer alkalinization (NH4+ -> NH3 + H+) is facilitated by apical HCO3- secretion through a Cl-/HCO3- anion exchanger. This was tested using a pharmacological approach with anterior (digestive) and posterior (respiratory) intestine preparations mounted in pH-stat-equipped Ussing chambers. The anterior intestine had a markedly higher conductance, increased short-circuit current, and greater net base (J(base)) and ammonia excretion rates (J(amm)) than the posterior intestine. In the anterior intestine, HCO3- accounted for 70\% of J(base). In the presence of an imposed serosal-mucosal ammonia gradient, inhibitors of both NHE (EIPA, 0.1 mmol l(-1)) and Na+/K+-ATPase (ouabain, 0.1 mmol l(-1)) significantly inhibited J(amm) in the anterior intestine, although only EIPA had an effect in the posterior intestine. In addition, the anion exchange inhibitor DIDS significantly reduced J(base) in the anterior intestine although only at a high dose (1 mmol l(-1)). Carbonic anhydrase does not appear to be associated with gut alkalinization under these conditions as ethoxzolamide was without effect on J(base). Membrane fluidity of the posterior intestine was low, suggesting low permeability, which was also reflected in a lower mucosal-serosal J(amm) in the presence of an imposed gradient, in contrast to that in the anterior intestine. To conclude, although the posterior intestine is highly modified for gas exchange, it is the anterior intestine that is the likely site of ammonia excretion and alkalinization leading to ammonia volatilization in the gut.",2013,10.1242/jeb.074401,216,4,623-632,NA,ammonia volatilization; chloride-bicarbonate exchanger; sodium-proton exchanger; sodium-potassium ATPase; ammonium
article,Integrative physiology of transcellular and paracellular intestinal absorption,"Karasov, William H.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Glucose absorption by the small intestine has been studied for nearly a century. Despite extensive knowledge about the identity, functioning and regulation of the relevant transporters, there has been and there remains controversy about how these transporters work in concert to determine the overall epithelial absorption of key nutrients (e.g. sugars, amino acids) over a wide range of dietary and/or luminal concentrations. Our broader, integrative understanding of intestinal absorption requires more than the reductionist dissection of all the components and their elaboration at molecular and genetic levels. This Commentary emphasizes the integration of discrete molecular players and processes (including paracellular absorption) that, in combination, determine the overall epithelial absorption of key nutrients (e.g. sugars, amino acids) and putative anti-nutrients (water-soluble toxins), and the integration of that absorption with other downstream processes related to metabolic demands.

Clara P. and Fonseca, Paulo J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The active space of a signal is an important concept in acoustic communication as it has implications for the function and evolution of acoustic signals. However, it remains mostly unknown for fish as it has been measured in only a restricted number of species. We combined physiological and sound propagation approaches to estimate the communication range of the Lusitanian toadfish's (Halobatrachus didactylus) advertisement sound, the boatwhistle (BW). We recorded BWs at different distances from vocalizing fish in a natural nesting site at ca. 2-3 m depth. We measured the representation of these increasingly attenuated BWs in the auditory pathway through the auditory evoked potential (AEP) technique. These measurements point to a communication range of between 6 and 13 m, depending on the spectral characteristics of the BW. A similar communication range (ca. 8 m) was derived from comparing sound attenuation at selected frequencies with auditory sensitivity. This is one of the few studies to combine auditory measurements with sound propagation to estimate the active space of acoustic signals in fish. We emphasize the need in future studies for estimates of active space to take informational masking into account.",2016,10.1242/jeb.134981,219,8,1122-1129,NA,Information masking; Fish; Communication range; AEP technique; Auditory evoked potential; Boatwhistle
article,Biomechanical consequences of epiphytism in intertidal macroalgae,"Anderson, Laura M. and Martone, Patrick T.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Epiphytic algae grow on other algae rather than hard substrata, perhaps circumventing competition for space in marine ecosystems. Aquatic epiphytes are widely thought to negatively affect host fitness; it is also possible that epiphytes benefit from associating with hosts. This study explored the biomechanical costs and benefits of the epiphytic association between the intertidal brown algal epiphyte Soranthera ulvoidea and its red algal host Odonthalia floccosa. Drag on epiphytized and unepiphytized hosts was measured in a recirculating water flume. A typical epiphyte load increased drag on hosts by similar to 50\%, increasing dislodgment risk of epiphytized hosts compared with hosts that did not have epiphytes. However, epiphytes were more likely to dislodge from hosts than hosts were to dislodge from the substratum, suggesting that drag added by epiphytes may not be mechanically harmful to hosts if epiphytes break first. Concomitantly, epiphytes experienced reduced flow when attached to hosts, perhaps allowing them to grow larger or live in more wave-exposed areas. Biomechanical interactions between algal epiphytes and hosts are complex and not necessarily negative, which may partially explain the evolution and persistence of epiphytic relationships.",2014,10.1242/jeb.088955,217,7,1167-1174,NA,Epiphyte; Host; Soranthera ulvoidea; Odonthalia floccosa; Biomechanics; Drag; Seaweed; Algae; Intertidal

Consequently, our understanding of proximate mechanisms in visual information processing is handicapped. Here we test learning performance of Africanized honey bees under restrained conditions with visual and olfactory stimulation using the proboscis extension response (PER) protocol. Restrained individuals were trained to learn an association between a color stimulus and a sugar-water reward. We evaluated performance for `absolute' learning (learned association between a stimulus and a reward) and `discriminant' learning (discrimination between two stimuli). Restrained Africanized honey bees (AHBs) readily learned the association of color stimulus for both blue and green LED stimuli in absolute and discriminatory learning tasks within seven presentations, but not with violet as the rewarded color. Additionally, 24-h memory improved considerably during the discrimination task, compared with absolute association (15-55\%). We found that antennal amputation was unnecessary and reduced performance in AHBs. Thus color learning can now be studied using the PER protocol with intact AHBs.

Therefore, the pressure at the contact area of the gastrocnemius and plantaris muscle was measured synchronously to the force of the whole calf musculature in the rabbit species Oryctolagus cuniculus. Similar results were obtained when using a conductive pressure sensor, or a fibre-optic pressure transducer connected to a water-filled balloon. Both methods revealed a strong linear relationship between force and pressure in the ascending limb of the force-length relationship. The shape of the measured force-time and pressure-time traces was almost identical for each contraction (r=0.97). Intermuscular pressure ranged between 100 and 700 mbar (70,000 Pa) for forces up to 287 N. These pressures are similar to previous (intramuscular) recordings within skeletal muscles of different vertebrate species. Furthermore, our results suggest that the rise in intermuscular pressure during contraction may reduce the force production in muscle packages (compartments).",2016,10.1242/jeb.135566,219,15,2311-2319,NA,Muscle compression; Transversal muscle loading; Isometric contraction; Calf muscles; Oryctolagus cuniculus
article,Recognition of natural objects in the archerfish,"Volotsky, Svetlana and Ben-Shahar, Ohad and Donchin, Opher and Segev, Ronen",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Recognition of individual objects and their categorization is a complex computational task. Nevertheless, visual systems can perform this task in a rapid and accurate manner. Humans and other animals can efficiently recognize objects despite countless variations in their projection on the retina due to different viewing angles, distance, illumination conditions and other parameters. To gain a better understanding of the recognition process in teleosts, we explored it in archerfish, a species that hunts by shooting a jet of water at aerial targets and thus can benefit from ecologically relevant recognition of natural objects. We found that archerfish not only can categorize objects into relevant classes but also can do so for novel objects, and additionally they can recognize an individual object presented under different conditions. To understand the mechanisms underlying this capability, we developed a computational model based on object features and a machine learning classifier. The analysis of the model revealed that a small number of features was sufficient for categorization, and the fish were more sensitive to object contours than textures. We tested these predictions in additional behavioral experiments and validated them. Our findings suggest the existence of a complex visual process in the archerfish visual system that enables object recognition and categorization.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243237,225,3,NA,jeb243237,Visual object recognition; Object categorization; Computational model; Visual system
article,The energetics of `airtime': estimating swim power from breaching behaviour in fishes and cetaceans,"Halsey, Lewis G. and Iosilevskii, Gil",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Displays of maximum swimming speeds are rare in the laboratory and the wild, limiting our understanding of the top-end athletic capacities of aquatic vertebrates. However, jumps out of the water - exhibited by a diversity of fish and cetaceans - might sometimes represent a behaviour comprising maximum burst effort. We collected data on such breaching behaviour for 14 fish and cetacean species primarily from online videos, to calculate breaching speed. From newly derived formulae based on the drag coefficient and hydrodynamic efficiency, we also calculated the associated power. The fastest breaching speeds were exhibited by species 2 m in length, peaking at nearly 11 m s(-1); as species size decreases below this, the fastest breaches become slower, while species larger than 2 m do not show a systematic pattern. The power associated with the fastest breaches was consistently similar to 50 W kg(-1) (equivalent to 200 W kg(-1) muscle) in species from 20 cm to 2 m in length, suggesting that this value may represent a universal (conservative) upper boundary. And it is similar to the maximum recorded power output per muscle mass recorded in any species of similar size, suggesting that some breaches could indeed be representative of maximum capability.",2020,10.1242/jeb.216036,223,1,NA,jeb216036,Cetacean; Fish; Hydrodynamics; Jump; Teleost; Velocity

G.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Several studies show effects of yolk androgens in avian eggs on the phenotype of the offspring. Yolk hormone concentrations decline strongly within the first few days of incubation. Although early embryonic uptake of yolk androgens is suggested by the presence of radioactivity in the embryo when eggs are injected with radiolabelled androgens, these studies do not verify the chemical identity of radioactive compound(s), although it is known that these androgens can be metabolized substantially. By using stable isotopelabelled testosterone and androstenedione in combination with mass spectrometry, enabling verification of the exact molecular identity of labelled compounds in the embryo, we found that after 5 days of incubation the androgens were not taken up by the embryo. However, their concentrations in the entire yolk albumen homogenates declined strongly, even when corrected for dilution by albumen and water. Our results indicate metabolism of maternal androgens, very likely to 5 beta-androstane-3 alpha,17 beta-diol, etiocholanolone and their conjugated forms.

article,Activation of the immune defence of the freshwater snail <i>Lymnaea stagnalis</i> by different immune elicitors,"Seppala, Otto and Leicht, Katja",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Understanding the outcomes of host-parasite interactions in nature is in high demand as parasites and pathogens are important for several ecological and evolutionary processes. Ecological immunology (ecoimmunology) has a key role in reaching this goal because immune defence is the main physiological barrier against infections. To date, ecoimmunological studies largely lean on measuring constitutive immune defences (components of defence that are always active). However, understanding the role of inducible components of immune function is important as the immune system is largely an inducible defence. Measuring such defences can be complicated as different parasites may activate different immune cascades, and expression of different immune traits may not be independent. We examined the suitability of different immune activation techniques for the freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis. By experimentally challenging snails with different immune elicitors [}injection with snail saline (i.e. wounding), lyophilized Escherichia coli cells, lyophilized Micrococcus lysodeikticus cells, healthy snail gonad, and trematode-infected snail gonad; maintenance in microorganism-enriched water] and measuring phenoloxidase-like and antibacterial activity of their haemolymph, we found increased immune activity against some immune elicitors, but also decreased activity.

Using molecular and histological techniques we found that asic genes and the ASIC4.2 protein are expressed in the gill of adult zebrafish. Immunohistochemistry revealed that mitochondrion-rich cells positive for ASIC4.2 do not co-localize with Na+/K+-ATPase-rich cells, but co-localize with cells expressing vacuolar-type H+-ATPase. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibitors of ASIC and Na+/H+-exchanger significantly reduced uptake of Na+ in adult zebrafish exposed to low-Na+ media, but did not cause the same response in individuals exposed to ultra-low-Na+ water.

Both clingfish discs and bioinspired suction cups have stiff cores but flexible edges that can deform to overcome surface irregularities. Compliant surfaces are common in nature and technical settings, but performance data for fish and commercial cups are gathered from stiff surfaces. We quantified the interaction between substrate compliance, surface roughness and suction performance for the northern clingfish, commercial suction cups and three biomimetic suction cups with disc rims of varying compliance. We found that all cups stick better on stiffer substrates and worse on more compliant ones, as indicated by peak stress values. On compliant substrates, surface roughness had little effect on adhesion, even for commercial cups that normally fail on hard, rough surfaces. We propose that suction performance on compliant substrates can be explained in part by effective elastic modulus, the combined elastic modulus from a cup-substrate interaction. Of all the tested cups, the biomimetic cups performed the best on compliant surfaces, highlighting their potential to be used in medical and marine geotechnical fields.

article,Walking on chains: the morphology and mechanics behind the fin ray derived limbs of sea-robins,"Petersen, Jarrod C. and Ramsay, Jason B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Fish fin rays (lepidotrichia) are typically composed of paired and segmented flexible structures (hemitrichia) that help support and change the shape of the fins to affect water flow. Yet, marine ray-finned fish that are members of the family Priontinae (sea-robins) have specialized pectoral fin rays that are separated from the fin and used as limbs to walk along the seafloor. While previous kinematic studies have demonstrated the use of these specialized fin rays as walking appendages, there is little information on how the morphology of the `walking rays' and associated musculature facilitate underwater walking. Here, we examine the musculoskeletal anatomy of the walking and pectoral fin rays in the striped sea-robin Prionotus evolans and compare the mechanical properties of the rays with those of the smaller northern sea-robin Prionotus carolinus. We aimed to determine what structural modifications in the walking rays allow them to function as a supportive limb. We found enlarged processes for muscle attachment, bone extensions that brace the hemitrich articulations, and reduced flexibility and increased second moment of area along the rostro-caudal bending axis in the rays used for walking. This novel limb design may have promoted the benthic foraging behavior exhibited by these species by uncoupling locomotion and feeding.",2020,10.1242/jeb.227140,223,18,NA,jeb227140,Fin rays; Prionotus; Locomotion; Lepidotrichia; Materials; Fish

In the case of freshwater mussels, the drivers of locomotion are largely unresolved. Our aim was to assess the influence of light presence and intensity on the locomotory behaviour of freshwater mussels in controlled laboratory experiments. The species investigated in our study were Anodonta anatina and Unio pictorum, two widely distributed mussels in European lentic and lotic inland waters. At low algal concentrations, known to be associated with more frequent locomotory activities, we found that both species moved primarily in the absence of light (72.7\% of all movements across experiments). However, the movements of both species were directed towards the light source, resembling a net-positive `phototactic' response but in the absence of light. The distance to the light source, which was negatively correlated to light intensity, had a positive effect on the distance covered in locomotory activities by A. anatina but not by U. pictorum. Intraspecific variation in shell size had no impact on movement distance, indicating that the energetic costs of movement were not a limiting factor.

Morphologically resembling their lunge-feeding, rorqual relatives, sei whales have convergently evolved the ability to skim prey near the surface of the water, like the more distantly related balaenids. Because of their intermediate nature, understanding how sei whales switch between feeding behaviors may shed light on the rapid evolution and flexibility of filter-feeding strategies. We deployed multi-sensor bio-logging tags on two sei whales and measured the kinematics of feeding behaviors in this poorly understood and endangered species. To forage at the surface. sei whales used a unique combination of surface lunges and skim-feeding behaviors. The surface lunges were slow and stereotyped, and were unlike lunges performed by other rorqual species. The skim-feeding events featured a different filtration mechanism from the lunges and were kinematically different from the continuous filter feeding used by balaenids. While foraging below the surface, sei whales used faster and more variable lunges. The morphological characteristics that allow sei whales to effectively perform different feeding behaviors suggest that sei whales rapidly evolved their functionally intermediate and ecologically flexible form to compete with larger and more efficient rorqual species.",2021,10.1242/jeb.238873,224,9,NA,jeb238873,Filter feeding; Lunge feeding; Skim feeding; Balaenoptera borealis; Biomechanics
article,Chemical cues from fish heighten visual sensitivity in larval crabs through changes in photoreceptor structure and function,"Charpentier, Corie L. and Cohen, Jonathan H.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Several predator avoidance strategies in zooplankton rely on the use of light to control vertical position in the water column. Although light is the primary cue for such photobehavior, predator chemical cues or kairomones increase swimming responses to light. We currently lack a mechanistic understanding for how zooplankton integrate visual and chemical cues to mediate phenotypic plasticity in defensive photobehavior. In marine systems, kairomones are thought to be amino sugar degradation products of fish body mucus. Here, we demonstrate that increasing concentrations of fish kairomones heightened sensitivity of light-mediated swimming behavior for two larval crab species (Rhithropanopeus harrisii and Hemigrapsus sanguineus). Consistent with these behavioral results, we report increased visual sensitivity at the retinal level in larval crab eyes directly following acute (1-3 h) kairomone exposure, as evidenced electrophysiologically from V-log I curves and morphologically from wider, shorter rhabdoms. The observed increases in visual sensitivity do not correspond with a decline in temporal resolution, because latency in electrophysiological responses actually increased after kairomone exposure. Collectively, these data suggest that phenotypic plasticity in larval crab photobehavior is achieved, at least in part, through rapid changes in photoreceptor structure and function.",2015,10.1242/jeb.125229,218,21,3381-3390,NA,Phenotypic plasticity; Zooplankton; Zoea; Vision; Kairomones; Photobehavior
article,Pectoral fins aid in navigation of a complex environment by bluegill sunfish under sensory deprivation conditions,"Flammang, Brooke E. and Lauder, George V.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Complex structured environments offer fish advantages as places of refuge and areas of greater potential prey densities, but maneuvering through these environments is a navigational challenge. To successfully navigate complex habitats, fish must have sensory input relaying information about the proximity and size of obstacles. We investigated the role of the pectoral fins as mechanosensors in bluegill sunfish swimming through obstacle courses under different sensory deprivation and flow speed conditions. Sensory deprivation was accomplished by filming in the dark to remove visual input and/or temporarily blocking lateral line input via immersion in cobalt chloride. Fish used their pectoral fins to touch obstacles as they swam slowly past them under all conditions. Loss of visual and/or lateral line sensory input resulted in an increased number of fin taps and shorter tap durations while traversing the course. Propulsive pectoral fin strokes were made in open areas between obstacle posts and fish did not use the pectoral fins to push off or change heading. Bending of the flexible pectoral fin rays may initiate an afferent sensory input, which could be an important part of the proprioceptive feedback system needed to navigate complex environments. This behavioral evidence suggests that it is possible for unspecialized pectoral fins to act in both a sensory and a propulsive capacity.",2013,10.1242/jeb.080077,216,16,3084-3089,NA,vision; lateral line; obstacle; cobalt chloride; mechanosensor; proprioception
article,Two isoforms of aquaporin 2 responsive to hypertonic stress in the bottlenose dolphin,"Suzuki, Miwa and Wakui, Hitomi and Itou, Takuya and Segawa, Takao and Inoshima, Yasuo and Maeda, Ken and Kikuchi, Kiyoshi",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"This study investigated the expression of aquaporin 2 (AQP2) and its newly found alternatively spliced isoform (alternative AQP2) and the functions of these AQP2 isoforms in the cellular hyperosmotic tolerance in the bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus. mRNA sequencing revealed that alternative AQP2 lacks the fourth exon and instead has a longer third exon that includes a part of the original third intron. The portion of the third intron, now part of the coding region of alternative AQP2, is highly conserved among many species of the order Cetacea but not among terrestrial mammals. Semi-quantitative PCR revealed that AQP2 was expressed only in the kidney, similar to terrestrial mammals. In contrast, alternative AQP2 was expressed in all organs examined, with strong expression in the kidney. In cultured renal cells, expression of both AQP2 isoforms was upregulated by the addition to the medium of NaCl but not by the addition of mannitol, indicating that the expression of both isoforms is induced by hypersalinity. Treatment with small interfering RNA for both isoforms resulted in a decrease in cell viability in hypertonic medium (500 mOsm kg(-1)) when compared with controls. These findings indicate that the expression of alternatively spliced AQP2 is ubiquitous in cetacean species, and it may be one of the molecules important for cellular osmotic tolerance throughout the body.",2016,10.1242/jeb.132811,219,8,1249-1258,NA,Cellular osmoregulation; Osmotic tolerance; Alternative splicing; Cetacea
article,Behavior and morphology combine to influence energy dissipation in mantis shrimp (Stomatopoda),"Green, P. A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Animals deliver and withstand physical impacts in diverse behavioral contexts, from competing rams clashing their antlers together to archerfish impacting prey with jets of water. Though the ability of animals to withstand impact has generally been studied by focusing on morphology, behaviors may also influence impact resistance. Mantis shrimp exchange high-force strikes on each other's coiled, armored telsons (tailplates) during contests over territory. Prior work has shown that telson morphology has high impact resistance. I hypothesized that the behavior of coiling the telson also contributes to impact energy dissipation. By measuring impact dynamics from highspeed videos of strikes exchanged during contests between freely moving animals, I found that approximately 20\% more impact energy was dissipated by the telson as compared with findings from a prior study that focused solely on morphology. This increase is likely due to behavior: because the telson is lifted off the substrate, the entire body flexes after contact, dissipating more energy than exoskeletal morphology does on its own. While variation in the degree of telson coil did not affect energy dissipation, proportionally more energy was dissipated from higher velocity strikes and from strikes from more massive appendages. Overall, these findings show that analysis of both behavior and morphology is crucial to understanding impact resistance, and suggest future research on the evolution of structure and function under the selective pressure of biological impacts.",2024,10.1242/jeb.247063,227,9,NA,jeb247063,Biomechanics; Animal behavior; Coefficient of restitution; Animal contests; Ecomorphology
article,Network analysis reveals that acute stress exacerbates gene regulatory responses of the gill to seawater in Atlantic salmon,"Monette, Michelle Y. and Velotta, Jonathan P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The transition from freshwater to seawater represents a physiological challenge for Atlantic salmon smolts preparing for downstream migration. Stressors occurring during downstream migration to the ocean impair the ability of smolts to maintain osmotic/ionic homeostasis in seawater. The molecular mechanisms underlying this interaction are not fully understood, especially at the organ level. We combined RNA-Seq with measures of whole-animal homeostasis to examine gene expression dynamics in the gills of smolts associated with impaired seawater tolerance after an aquaculture-related stressor. Smolts were given a 24 h seawater tolerance test before and after exposure to an acute handling/confinement stress. RNA-Seq followed by differential expression and weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was used to quantify the transcriptional response of the gill to handling/confinement stress, seawater and their interaction. Exposure to acute stress was associated with a general stress response and impaired osmotic/ionic homeostasis in seawater. We identified gene networks in the gill exhibiting response to acute stress alone, seawater alone, and others exhibiting combined effects of both stress and seawater. Our findings indicate that acute handling/confinement stress increases the intensity of seawater-related gene expression and suggest that increased investment in mechanisms related to ion transport may be part of a compensatory response to impaired seawater tolerance in smolts.",2022,10.1242/jeb.242424,225,8,NA,jeb242424,Osmoregulation; Stress; Smolt; Transcriptomics; WGCNA

The nature of the chromophore bound to opsin proteins was investigated using high performance liquid chromatography. The opsin genes were then cloned and sequenced, and the absorption spectra of different types of cones were obtained by microspectrophotometry. Two green (EJ-RH2-1, EJ-RH2-2) and one red (EJ-LWS) cone opsin genes were identified and are presumably related to the vitamin A1- based visual pigments (i.e. rhodopsins) with lambda(max) values of 492, 474 and 512. nm, respectively. The long and short cones from the ventro- temporal retinal zone consisted of a pure population of RH2 class gene- based pigments (lambda(max)=492nm). The long and short cones from other retinal areas and the lateral components of the triple cones possessed a mixture of RH2 and LWS class gene- based pigments that exhibited a lambda(max) of similar to 502 nm. The central component of the triple cones contained only RH2 class gene- based pigments (lambda(max)=474nm). Thus, E. japonicus possesses a middle-wave range of spectral sensitivity and acquires different color vision systems in distinct visual fields.",2013,10.1242/jeb.078980,216,6,1041-1052,NA,fish; HPLC; microspectrophotometry; triple cones; gene expression; visual pigment; color vision; polarization vision
article,Hydrostatic pressure affects selective tidal stream transport in the North Sea brown shrimp (<i>Crangon crangon</i>),"Tielmann, Moritz and Reiser, Stefan and Hufnagl, Marc and Herrmann, Jens-Peter and Eckardt, Andre and Temming, Axel",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The brown shrimp (Crangon crangon) is a highly abundant invertebrate in the North Sea, with its life cycle stages ranging from deep offshore spawning to shallow onshore nursery areas. To overcome the long distances between these two habitats, brown shrimp are suspected to use selective tidal stream transport (STST), moving with the cyclic tide currents towards their preferred water depths. However, it is not known which stimulus actually triggers STST behavior in brown shrimp. In this work, we determined the influence of different hyperbaric pressures on STST behavior of juvenile brown shrimp. Brown shrimp activity was recorded in a hyperbaric pressure chamber that supplied constant and dynamic pressure conditions simulating different depths, with and without a tidal cycle. Subsequent wavelet and Fourier analysis were performed to determine the periodicity in the activity data. The results of the experiments show that STST behavior in brown shrimp varies with pressure and therefore with depth. We further show that STST behavior can be initiated by cyclic pressure changes. However, an interaction with one or more other environmental triggers remains possible. Furthermore, a security ebb-tide activity was identified that may serve to avoid potential stranding in shallow waters and is `remembered' by shrimp for about 1.5 days without contact with tidal triggers.",2015,10.1242/jeb.125773,218,20,3241-3248,NA,STST; North Sea; Zeitgeber; Tidal trigger
article,RNA-seq reveals disruption of gene regulation when honey bees are caged and deprived of hive conditions,"Alburaki, Mohamed and Karim, Shahid and Lamour, Kurt and Adamczyk, John and Stewart, Scott D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In this study, we present phenotypic and genetic data characterizing the impact of imidacloprid and caging stress on honey bee Apis mellifera physiological responses and regulation of 45 genes using targeted-RNA seq. The term `caging stress' characterizes the effects of depriving honey bees of all hive aspects and conditions. Two cohorts of 1 day old sister bees were subjected to different conditions. One cohort was caged and fed different imidacloprid-tainted sugar solutions and the second was marked and introduced back to its natal hive. Physiological bee parameters and diet behavior were monitored daily for caged bees over several weeks. Bee samples from both cohorts were sampled weekly for RNA sequencing and oxidative stress analyses. Imidacloprid induced significant protein damage and post-ingestive aversion responses in caged bees, leading to lower tainted syrup consumption and higher water intake compared with the controls. No differentially expressed genes were observed among caged bees in regards to imidacloprid treatment. However, significant upregulation in antioxidant genes was recorded in caged bees as compared with hive bees, with overwhelming downregulation in all gene categories in caged bees at week 4. We identified two sets of genes that were constantly regulated in caged bees, including Rsod with unknown function in insects that could potentially characterize caging stress in honey bees.",2019,10.1242/jeb.207761,222,18,NA,jeb207761,Honey bee; RNA-seq; Cage stress; Imidacloprid; Gene regulation; Oxidative stress
article,Molecular and functional characterization of the Gulf toadfish serotonin transporter SLC6A4,"Amador, Molly H. B. and McDonald, M. Danielle",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The serotonin transporter (SERT) functions in the uptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) from the extracellular milieu and is the molecular target of the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), a common group of anti-depressants. The current study comprehensively assesses the sequence, tissue distribution, transport kinetics and physiological function of a teleost SERT. The 2022 bp toadfish SERT sequence encodes a protein of 673 amino acids, which shows 83\% similarity to zebrafish SERT and groups with SERT of other teleosts in phylogenetic analysis. SERT mRNA is ubiquitous in tissues and is expressed at high levels in the heart and, within the brain, in the cerebellum. SERT cRNA expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes demonstrates a Km value of 2.08 +/- 0.45 mu mol l(-1), similar to previously reported Km values for zebrafish and human SERT. Acute systemic blockade of SERT by intraperitoneal administration of the SSRI fluoxetine (FLX) produces a dose-dependent increase in plasma 5-HT, indicating effective inhibition of 5-HT uptake from the circulation. As teleosts lack platelets, which are important 5-HT sequestration sites in mammals, the FLX-induced increase in plasma 5-HT suggests that toadfish tissues may normally be responsible for maintaining low 5-HT concentrations in the bloodstream.",2018,10.1242/jeb.170928,221,7,NA,jeb170928,5-HT; 5-Hydroxytryptamine; 5-HTT; Transport kinetics; mRNA expression; Opsanus beta
article,Responding to the signal and the noise: behavior of planktonic gastropod larvae in turbulence,"DiBenedetto, Michelle H. and Helfrich, Karl R. and Pires, Anthony and Anderson, Erik J. and Mullineaux, Lauren S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Swimming organisms may actively adjust their behavior in response to the flow around them. Ocean flows are typically turbulent and are therefore characterized by chaotic velocity fluctuations. While some studies have observed planktonic larvae altering their behavior in response to turbulence, it is not always clear whether a plankter is responding to an individual turbulence fluctuation or to the time-averaged flow. To distinguish between these two paradigms, we conducted laboratory experiments with larvae in turbulence. We observed veliger larvae of the gastropod Crepidula fornicate in a jetstirred turbulence tank while simultaneously measuring two components of the fluid and larval velocity. Larvae were studied at two different stages of development, early and late, and their behavior was analyzed in response to different characteristics of turbulence: acceleration, dissipation and vorticity. Our analysis considered the effects of both the time-averaged flow and the instantaneous flow, around the larvae. Overall, we found that both stages of larvae increased their upward swimming speeds in response to increasing turbulence. However, we found that the early-stage larvae tended to respond to the time-averaged flow, whereas the late-stage larvae tended to respond to the instantaneous flow around them. These observations indicate that larvae can integrate flow information over time and that their behavioral responses to turbulence can depend on both their present and past flow environments.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243209,225,3,NA,jeb243209,Swimming behavior; Veligers; Hydrodynamics; Plankton
article,"Attachment ability of a clamp-bearing fish parasite, <i>Diplozoon paradoxum</i> (Monogenea), on gills of the common bream, <i>Abramis brama</i>","Wong, Wey-Lim and Gorb, Stanislav N.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Monogeneans, which are mainly fish ectoparasites, use various types of haptoral (posterior) attachment apparatus to secure their attachment onto their hosts. However, it remains unclear how strongly a monogenean can attach onto its host. In the present study, we aimed for the first time to (1) measure pull-off forces required to detach a pair of clamp-bearing monogeneans, Diplozoon paradoxum, from gills of Abramis brama and (2) determine the contribution of muscles to the clamp movements. A mean force of 6.1 +/- 2.7 mN (similar to 246 times the animals' weight) was required to dislodge a paired D. paradoxum vertically from the gills. There were significant differences (P<0.05, Tukey test) between the widths of clamp openings in D. paradoxum treated in three different solutions: the widest clamp openings were observed in the monogeneans treated in 100 mmol l(-1) potassium chloride solution (58.26 +/- 13.44 mu m), followed by those treated in 20 mmol l(-1) magnesium chloride solution (37.91 +/- 7.58 mu m), and finally those treated in filtered lake water (20.16 +/- 8.63 mu m). This suggests that the closing of the clamps is probably not due to the continuous contraction of extrinsic muscles but is caused by the elasticity of the clamp material and that muscle activity is required for clamp opening.",2013,10.1242/jeb.076190,216,16,3008-3014,NA,biomechanics; monogenean; muscle; pull-off force; Platyhelminthes; resilin
