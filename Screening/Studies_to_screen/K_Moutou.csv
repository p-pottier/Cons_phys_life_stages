article,"Thermal stress in <i>Danio rerio</i>: a link between temperature, light, thermo-TRP channels, and clock genes","Jeronimo, Rodrigo and Moraes, Maria Nathalia and Monteiro de Assis, Leonardo Vinicius and Ramos, Bruno Cesar and Rocha, Thaina and de Lauro Castrucci, Ana Maria",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"It is believed that the biological systems perceiving temperature and light daily cycles were subjected to the simultaneous selective pressures, which resulted in their co-evolutionary association. We investigated the influence of 1 h 33 degrees C heat shock on the expression of clock and heat shock protein genes, as well as the role of the thermo-TRP channel, TRPV1, in ZEM-2S cells of the teleost Danio rerio, in constant dark (DD) or light-dark cycles (LD). After heat shock, we observed an acute increase of hsp90 aal levels in both DD and LD conditions. Interestingly, the expression of hsp90 aal was two-fold lower in LD than in DD, what suggests an antagonistic effect of white light on heat shock action. Regarding clock genes, no effect was found in cells subjected to the heat shock in DD. When cells were kept in LD, the expression of pent, per2, cryla, and crylb increased in response to heat shock, indicating that heat shock only affects clock core of LD-synchronized ZEM-2S cells. We then evaluated whether TRPV1 played a role in heat-mediated hsp90 aal and per2 responses: hsp90 aal increase was unaffected whereas per2 increase was partially blocked by TRPV1 inhibitor, demonstrating the channel participation in clock gene regulation by heat shock. Taken together, our results open a novel investigative perspective regarding the relationship between temperature and clock genes, placing a new player in the regulation of this phenomenon: the TRPV1 channel.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.02.009,68,A,128-138,NA,Danio rerio; ZEM-2S cells; Clock genes; Thermo-TRPs; Heat shock proteins
article,Antioxidant defense system and oxidative status in Antarctic fishes: The sluggish rockcod <i>Notothenia coriiceps</i> versus the active marbled notothen <i>Notothenia rossii</i>,"Klein, Roberta Daniele and Rosa, Carlos Eduardo and Colares, Elton Pinto and Robaldo, Ricardo Berteaux and Martinez, Pablo Elias and Bianchini, Adalto",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Adaptive responses of antioxidant defense systems (ADS) to changes in increased levels of activity are critical, especially in Antarctic fishes. The benthopelagic marbled notothen (Notothenia rossii) shows higher spontaneous activity than the benthonic and sluggish rockcod (N. coriiceps). Therefore, we hypothesize that species-related responses of ADS would occur to counteract different rates of reactive oxygen species formation in these two Antarctic fish. Here we evaluated ADS and oxidative damage in tissues (brain, gills, liver and white muscle) of the two Antarctic fish. Despite no significant differences in lipid and protein oxidative damage were observed, we actually found species- and tissue-specific differences in ADS. Gill metallothionein-like proteins (MTLP) and liver reduced glutathione (GSH) concentrations were higher in N. coriiceps than in N. rossii. Brain and gill antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP); gill enzyme {[}glutamate-cysteine ligase (GSL), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT)] activity; liver GCL and SOD activity; and white muscle CAT activity were higher in N. rossii than in N. coriiceps. Therefore, the more active fish (N. rossii) maintains higher activities of enzymes involved in superoxide ions (021 detoxification and GSH production in peripheral tissues (gills, liver and white muscle). This allows the more active fish (N. rossii) to keep levels of lipid and protein oxidative damage similar to those observed in the sluggish fish (N. coriiceps). It is worth noting that the more active fish also shows a higher brain antioxidant capacity, which could involve other non-enzymatic antioxidants like vitamins C and E. In contrast, N. coriiceps shows lower consumption of non-enzymatic antioxidants in peripheral tissues than N. coriiceps. As hypothesized, our results indicate that differences in ADS profiles between fish species are likely related to their habits and metabolic rates. This would imply in different fish abilities to deal with oxidative stress associated with increasing seawater temperature.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.02.013,68,A,119-127,NA,Antarctica; Antioxidant defense system; Nototheniids fish; Oxidative damage
article,The effect of body fat percentage and body fat distribution on skin surface temperature with infrared thermography,"Chierighini Salamunes, Ana Carla and Wan Stadnik, Adriana Maria and Neves, Eduardo Borba",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"This study aimed to search for relations between body fat percentage and skin temperature and to describe possible effects on skin temperature as a result of fat percentage in each anatomical site. Women (26.11 +/- 4.41 years old) (n =123) were tested for: body circumferences; skin temperatures (thermal camera); fat percentage and lean mass from trunk, upper and lower limbs; and body fat percentage (Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry). Values of minimum (T-Mi), maximum (T-Ma), and mean temperatures (T-Me) were acquired in 30 regions of interest. Pearson's correlation was estimated for body circumferences and skin temperature variables with body fat percentage. Participants were divided into groups of high and low fat percentage of each body segment, of which T-Me values were compared with Student's t-test. Linear regression models for predicting body fat percentage were tested. Body fat percentage was positively correlated with body circumferences and palm temperatures, while it was negatively correlated with most temperatures, such as T-Ma and T-Me of posterior thighs (r =-0.495 and -0.432), TMe of posterior lower limbs (r =-0.488), T-Ma of anterior thighs (r =-0.406) and T-Mi and T-Me of posterior arms (r =-0.447 and -0.430). Higher fat percentages in the specific anatomical sites tended to decrease T-Me, especially in posterior thighs, shanks and arms. Skin temperatures and body circumferences predicted body fat percentage with 58.3\% accuracy (R =0.764 and R-2 =0.583). This study clarifies that skin temperature distribution is influenced by the fat percentage of each body segment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

article,"Low temperature tolerance, cold hardening and acclimation in tadpoles of the neotropical tungara frog (<i>Engystomops pustulosus</i>)","Vo, Pacific and Gridi-Papp, Marcos",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Many frogs from temperate climates can tolerate low temperatures and increase their thermal tolerance through hardening and acclimation. Most tropical frogs, on the other hand, fail to acclimate to low temperatures. This lack of acclimation ability is potentially due to lack of selection pressure for acclimation because cold weather is less common in the tropics. We tested the generality of this pattern by characterizing the critical temperature minimum (CTMin), hardening, and acclimation responses of tungara frogs (Engystomops pustulosus). These frogs belong to a family with unknown thermal ecology. They are found in a tropical habitat with a highly constant temperature regime. The CTMin of the tadpoles was on average 12.5 degrees C. Pre-metamorphic tadpoles hardened by 1.18 degrees C, while metamorphic tadpoles hardened by 0.36 degrees C. When raised at 21 degrees C, tadpoles acclimated expanding their cold tolerance by 1.3 degrees C in relation to larvae raised at 28 degrees C. These results indicate that the tungara frog has a greatly reduced cold tolerance when compared to species from temperate climates, but it responds to cold temperatures with hardening and acclimation comparable to those of temperate-zone species. Cold tolerance increased with body length but cold hardening was more extensive in pre-metamorphic tadpoles than in metamorphic ones. This study shows that lack of acclimation ability is not general to the physiology of tropical anurans.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.03.012,66,NA,49-55,NA,Larva; Tadpole; Thermal tolerance; Chilling; Frost; CTMin
article,Proteomic analysis of physiological function response to hot summer in liver from lactating dairy cows,"Wang, Qiangjun and Zhao, Xiaowei and Zhang, Zijun and Zhao, Huiling and Huang, Dongwei and Cheng, Guanglong and Yang, Yongxin",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Lactation performance of dairy cattle is susceptible to heat stress. The liver is one of the most crucial organs affected by high temperature in dairy cows. However, the physiological adaption by the liver to hot summer conditions has not been well elucidated in lactating dairy cows. In the present study, proteomic analysis of the liver in dairy cows in spring and hot summer was performed using a label-free method. In total, 127 differentially expressed proteins were identified; most of the upregulated proteins were involved in protein metabolic processes and responses to stimuli, whereas most of the downregulated proteins were related to oxidation reduction. Pathway analysis indicated that 3 upregulated heat stress proteins (HSP90a, HSP90 beta, and endoplasmin) were enriched in the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, whereas several downregulated NADH dehydrogenase proteins were involved in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. The protein protein interaction network indicated that several upregulated HSP5 (HSP90a, HSP90 beta, and GRP78) were involved in more interactions than other proteins and were thus considered as central hub nodes. Our findings provide novel insights into the physiological adaption of liver function in lactating dairy cows to natural high temperature.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.02.010,65,NA,82-87,NA,Animal proteomics; Cow; Hot summer; Liver tissue; LC-MS/MS
article,Effects of heat stress on some reproductive parameters of male cavie (<i>Cavia porcellus</i>) and mitigation strategies using guava (<i>Psidium guajava</i>) leaves essential oil,"Ngoula, Ferdinand and Tekam, Maryvonne Guemdjo and Kenfack, Augustave and Tchingo, Cyrille D'Alex Tadondjou and Nouboudem, Sandrine and Ngoumtsop, Herman and Tsafack, Borice and Teguia, Alexis and Kamtchouing, Pierre and Galeotti, Marco and Tchoumboue, Joseph",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Climate changes, particularly the increase of temperature are among the main causes behind the decline of fertility in humans as well as animals. In this study, the effects of heat stress on some reproductive parameters of male cavies and mitigation strategies using guava leaves essential oil (GLEO) were studied. For this purpose, 40 male cavies aged 2.5-3 months and weighing between 348 and 446 g were divided into 4 groups of 10 animals each and subjected to the following temperatures: Ambient temperature (20-25 degrees C) for the control group, 35 degrees C for group 1, 45 degrees C for group 2 and 45 C+100 mu I GLEO/kg body weight, administered by gavage to animals for group 3. Exposure time of heat was 7 h per day for 60 days. Results reveal that the relative weights of testes, epididymis, vas deferens and seminal vesicles were hardly affected by the temperature levels considered (P > 0.05). The mass and individual sperm motility was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in cavies exposed to the temperature of 35 and 45 degrees C as compared with those which received GLEO and controls. The percentages of abnormal sperm and altered sperm DNA were higher in animals expbsed to temperature of 35 and 45 degrees C as compared with the controls. The activity of superoxide dismutase significantly increased (P < 0.05) in animals exposed to temperature of 45 degrees C and in those of 45 degrees C and orally treated with GLEO, compared with cavies exposed to temperature of 45 degrees C without receiving GLEO. The level of malondialdehyde was significantly increased (P < 0.05) in animals exposed to temperature of 35 and 45 degrees C, whereas the level of nitric oxide was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in exposed animals as compared with controls. It was concluded that the exposure of male cavies at 35 and 45 degrees C for 60 days induce heat stress that causes deterioration of sperm characteristics.

article,"Acute effects of temperature and hypercarbia on cutaneous and branchial gas exchange in the South American lungfish, <i>Lepidosiren paradoxa</i>","Zena, Lucas A. and Bicego, Kenia C. and da Silva, Glauber S. F. and Giusti, Humberto and Glass, Mogens L. and Sanchez, Adriana P.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The South American lungfish, Lepidosiren paradoxa inhabits seasonal environments in the Central Amazon and Parana-Paraguay basins that undergo significant oscillations in temperature throughout the year. They rely on different gas exchange organs, such as gills and skin for aquatic gas exchange while their truly bilateral lungs are responsible for aerial gas exchange; however, there are no data available on the individual contributions of the skin and the gills to total aquatic gas exchange in L. paradoxa. Thus, in the present study we quantify the relative contributions of skin and gills on total aquatic gas exchange during warm (35 degrees C) and cold exposure (20 degrees C) in addition to the effects of aerial and aquatic hypercarbia on aquatic gas exchange and gill ventilation rate (f(G); 25 degrees C), respectively. Elevated temperature (35 degrees C) caused a significant increase in the contribution of cutaneous (from 0.61 +/- 0.13 to 1.34 +/- 0.26 ml. STPD.h(-1) kg(-1)) and branchial (from 0.54 +/- 0.17 to 1.73 +/- 0.53 ml. STPD.h(-1) kg(-1)) gas exchange for (V) over dotCO(2) relative to the lower temperature (20 degrees C), while (V) over dot O-2 remained relatively unchanged. L. paradoxa exhibited a greater branchial contribution in relation to total aquatic gas exchange at lower temperatures (20 and 25 degrees C) for oxygen uptake. Aerial hypercarbia decreased branchial (V) over dot O-2 whereas branchial (V) over dotCO(2) was significantly increased. Progressive increases in aquatic hypercarbia did not affect f(G). This response is in contrast to increases in pulmonary ventilation that may offset any increase in arterial partial pressure of CO2 owing to CO2 loading through the animals' branchial surface. Thus, despite their reduced contribution to total gas exchange, cutaneous and branchial gas exchange in L. paradoxa can be significantly affected by temperature and aerial hypercarbia.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.12.001,63,NA,112-118,NA,Lungfish; O-2 uptake; CO2 elimination; Dipnoi
article,Effect of cyclical cold stress during embryonic development on aspects of physiological responses and HSP70 gene expression of chicks,"Aminoroaya, Keyvan and Sadeghi, Ali Asghar and Ansari-pirsaraei, Zarbakht and Kashan, Nasser",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of cyclical lower incubation temperature at different embryonic ages on the hatchability, body and organs weights, thyroid hormones, and liver HSP70 gene expression of newly hatched chicks. In a completely randomized design, fertile eggs of a broiler breeder (34 weeks of age) were assigned to three treatment groups with six replicates and 145 eggs per each. The treatment groups were as: control group (C) that eggs were incubated at 37.6 degrees C during the whole incubation period; incubation temperature was decreased to 36 degrees C for 3 h per day at embryonic age from 12 to 14 (T1); and incubation temperature was decreased to 36 degrees C for 3 h per day at embryonic age from 15 to 17 (12). No significant difference was found among treatments for hatchability (P > 0.05). There were no differences (P > 0.05) among treatments for body weight and liver weight, while heart weight of chicks in T1 and T2 groups were significantly higher than the control group (P < 0.05). There were no differences (P > 0.05) among treatments for the levels of thyroid hormones, however, the levels of both hormones tended to increase in chicks exposed to cold stress (T1 and 12). Chicks in T2 group had higher liver HSP70 gene expression compared with those in Tl and the control group (P < 0.05). Cold stress in both incubation periods had no significant effect on the plasma levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. Treatments had no effect on the plasma levels of glucose, cholesterol and triglyceride. The results of this study suggest that cyclical lower incubation temperatures (36 degrees C) at the embryonic age from day 15-17 could induce the liver HSP70 gene expression, without negative effects on the hatchability and body weight of hatched chicks.

In Drosophila melanogaster, latitudinal variation in phenotype and genotype has been well studied, but attitudinal patterns have rarely been investigated. We studied populations from six different altitudes varying between 35 m and 2173 m in the Firtina Valley in northeastern part of Turkey to evaluate clinal trends in lifespan under experimental conditions. Lifespan in the D. melanogaster populations was examined in relation to altitude, sex, temperature (25 degrees C and 29 degrees C), and dietary yeast concentration (5 g/L and 25 g/L). As expected high temperature decrease lifespan in all populations. However, it was shown that lifespan was slightly affected by dietary stress. We found that lifespan decreases significantly under thermal stress conditions with increasing altitude. Moreover, there was a slightly negative relationship between altitude and lifespan, which was closely associated with climatic factors such as temperature and precipitation, may suggest local adaptation to climate.

article,Thermal tolerance in the Andean toad <i>Rhinella spinulosa</i> (Anura: Bufonidae) at three sites located along a latitudinal gradient in Chile,"Alveal Riquelme, Nicza and Diaz-Paez, Helen and Carlos Ortiz, Juan",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Rhinella spinulosa is one of the anuran species with the greatest presence in Chile. This species mainly inhabits mountain habitats and is distributed latitudinally along the western slope of the Andes Range. These habitats undergo great temperature fluctuations, exerting pressure on the amphibian. To identify the physiological strategies and thermal behavior of this species, we analyzed the temperature variables CTmin, CTmax, TTR, tau(heat), and tau(cool) in individuals of three sites from a latitudinal gradient (22 degrees S to 37 degrees S). The amphibians were acclimated to 10 degrees C and 20 degrees C and fed ad libitum. The results indicate that the species has a high thermal tolerance range, with a mean of 38.14 +/- 1.34 degrees C, a critical thermal maxima of 34.6-41.4 degrees C, and a critical thermal minima of 2.6-0.8 degrees C, classifying the species as eurythermic. Furthermore, there were significant differences in CTmax and TTR only in the northern site. The differences in thermal time constants between sites are due to the effects of size and body mass. For example, those from the central site had larger size and greater thermal inertia; therefore, they warmed and cooled in a slower manner. The wide thermal limits determined in R. spinulosa confirm that it is a thermo-generalist species, a characteristic that allows the species to survive in adverse microclimatic conditions. The level of plasticity in critical temperatures seems ecologically relevant and supports the acclimatization of thermal limits as an important factor for ectothermic animals to adapt to climate change.

article,Thermal equilibrium and temperature differences among body regions in European plethodontid salamanders,"Lunghi, Enrico and Manenti, Raoul and Canciani, Giancarlo and Scari, Giorgio and Pennati, Roberta and Ficetola, Gentile Francesco",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Information on species thermal physiology is extremely important to understand species responses to environmental heterogeneity and changes. Thermography is an emerging technology that allows high resolution and accurate measurement of body temperature, but until now it has not been used to study thermal physiology of amphibians in the wild. Hydromantes terrestrial salamanders are strongly depending on ambient temperature for their activity and gas exchanges, but information on their body temperature is extremely limited. In this study we tested if Hydromantes salamanders are thermoconform, we assessed whether there are temperature differences among body regions, and evaluated the time required to reach the thermal equilibrium. During summers of 2014 and 2015 we analysed 56 salamanders (Hydromantes ambrosii and Hydromantes italicus) using infrared thermocamera. We photographed salamanders at the moment in which we found them and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 15 min after having kept them in the hands. Body temperature was equal to air temperature; salamanders attained the equilibrium with air temperature in about 8 min, the time required to reach equilibrium was longer in individuals with large body size. We detected small temperature differences between body parts, the head being slightly warmer than the body and the tail (mean difference: 0.05 degrees C). These salamanders quickly reach the equilibrium with the environment, thus microhabitat measurement allows obtaining accurate information on their tolerance limits. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Quantification of the effect of electrical and thermal parameters on radiofrequency ablation for concentric tumour model of different sizes,"Jamil, Muhammad and Ng, E. Y. K.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been increasingly used in treating cancer for multitude of situations in various tissue types. To perform the therapy safely and reliably, the effect of critical parameters needs to be known beforehand. Temperature plays an important role in the outcome of the therapy and any uncertainties in temperature assessment can be lethal. This study presents the RFA case of fixed tip temperature where we've analysed the effect of electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity and blood perfusion rate of the tumour and surrounding normal tissue on the radiofrequency ablation. Ablation volume was chosen as the characteristic to be optimised and temperature control was achieved via PID controller. The effect of all 6 parameters each having 3 levels was quantified with minimum number of experiments harnessing the fractional factorial characteristic of Taguchi's orthogonal arrays. It was observed that as the blood perfusion increases the ablation volume decreases. Increasing electrical conductivity of the tumour results in increase of ablation volume whereas increase in normal tissue conductivity tends to decrease the ablation volume and vice versa. Likewise, increasing thermal conductivity of the tumour results in enhanced ablation volume whereas an increase in thermal conductivity of the surrounding normal tissue has a debilitating effect on the ablation volume and vice versa. With increase in the size of the tumour (i.e., 2-3 cm) the effect of each parameter is not linear. The parameter effect varies with change in size of the tumour that is manifested by the different gradient observed in ablation volume. Most important is the relative insensitivity of ablation volume to blood perfusion rate for smaller tumour size (2 cm) that is also in accordance with the previous results presented in literature. These findings will provide initial insight for safe, reliable and improved treatment planning perceptively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

article,"Effect of prenatal temperature conditioning of laying hen embryos: Hatching, live performance and response to heat and cold stress during laying period","Kamanli, S. and Durmus, I. and Yalcin, S. and Yildirim, U. and Meral, O.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"This study was designed to determine the effect of prenatal temperature conditioning on hatching and live performance of laying chickens, and response to heat and cold stress during laying period. A total of 3600 eggs obtained from ATAK-S brown parent stock were incubated at control (37.5 degrees C, CONT-Inc), cyclic low (36.5 degrees C/6 h/d from 10 to 18 d of incubation, LOW-Inc) or high (38.5 degrees C/6 h/d from 10-18 d of incubation, HIGH-Inc) incubation temperatures. Hatched chicks per incubation temperature were reared under standard rearing conditions up to 26 wk. From 27 to 30 wk, hens from each incubation temperature were divided into 3 environmentally controlled rooms and reared at control (20 +/- 2 degrees C, CONT-Room), low (12 +/- 2 degrees C, COLDS) or high (32 +/- 2 degrees C, HEATS) temperatures. Hatching performance, body weight, egg production, and plasma triiodothyronine (T-3) and thyroxine (T-4) levels and oxidant and antioxidant activities were evaluated. The highest hatchability was for LOW-Inc chicks while HIGH-Inc chick had similar hatchability to CONT-Inc. There was no effect of incubation temperatures on plasma MDA, GSH-Px, activities and T-4 concentrations on day of hatch. LOW- Inc chicks had higher SOD activities and T-3 concentrations compared to the other groups. Although chick weight was similar among incubation temperature groups, CONT-Inc chicks were heavier than those cyclic incubation temperature groups until 12 wk of age. Incubation temperature had no effect on sexual maturity age and weight and egg production of laying hens. From 27 to 30 wk, regardless of incubation temperature, HEATS hens lost weight from day 0 to 10, had the highest cloacal temperatures and lowest feed consumption and egg production while COLDS hens had the lowest cloacal temperatures. At day 5, 14 level was higher in LOW-Inc hens at COLDS but it was higher in HIGH-Inc hens at HEATS compared to CONT-Inc. These data may suggest a modification in thyroid activity of hens that were conditioned during the incubation period. Moreover under COLDS condition, SOD production of LOW-Inc hens was higher than those of CONT- and HIGH-Inc hens indicating an induction in antioxidant enzyme activity. Nonetheless, prenatal temperature conditioning of laying hen embryos had no advantage on laying performance of hens under temperature stress conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

article,"Coloration affects heating and cooling in three color morphs of the Australian bluetongue lizard, <i>Tiliqua scincoides</i>","Geen, Michael R. S. and Johnston, Gregory R.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The color-mediated thermoregulation hypothesis predicts that dark body color (low reflectance) allows organisms to gain heat more efficiently than does pale coloration (high reflectance). This prediction is intuitive and widely assumed to be true, but has poor empirical support. We used rare, captive-bred, mutant melanistic, albino and wild-type Australian bluetongue lizards, Tiliqua scincoides to measure the effects of skin reflectance on the heating and cooling rates. We measured heating under an artificial radiant heat source and cooling rates in an ice-cooled box using live lizards in a room with still air. The effect of skin reflectance on heat transfer was clear, despite the substantial influence of body size. Melanistic T. scincoides showed low reflectance and gained heat faster than highly reflective albinos. Melanistic lizards also lost heat faster than albinos. Wild-type lizards were intermediate in reflectance, gained heat at rates indistinguishable from melanistic lizards, and lost heat at rates indistinguishable from albino lizards. This study system allowed us to control for variables that were confounded in other studies and may explain the inconsistent support for the color-mediated thermoregulation hypothesis. Our results provide clear evidence that skin reflectance influences the rate of heating and cooling in ectotherms. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Effects of whole-body cryotherapy duration on thermal and cardio-vascular response,"Fonda, Borut and De Nardi, Massimo and Sarabon, Nejc",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Whole-body cryotherapy (WBC) is the exposure of minimally dressed participants to very cold air, either in a specially designed chamber (cryo-chamber) or cabin (cryo-cabin), for a short period of time. Practitioners are vague when it comes to recommendations on the duration of a single session. Recommended exposure for cryo-chamber is 150 s, but no empirically based recommendations are available for a cryo-cabin. Therefore the aim of this study was to examine thermal and cardio-vascular responses after 90, 120, 150 and 180s of WBC in a cryo-cabin. Our hypothesis was that skin temperature would be significantly lower after longer exposers. Twelve male participants (age 23.9 +/- 4.2 years) completed four WBC of different durations (90, 120, 150 and 180 s) in a cryo-cabin. Thermal response, heart rate and blood pressure were measured prior, immediately after, 5 min after and 30 min after the session. Skin temperature differed significantly among different durations, except between 150 and 180 s. There was no significant difference in heart rate and blood pressure. Thermal discomfort during a single session displayed a linear increase throughout the whole session. Our results indicate that practitioners and clinicians using cryo-cabin for WBC do not need to perform sessions longer than 150 s. We have shown that longer sessions do not substantially affect thermal and cardio-vascular response, but do increase thermal discomfort. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We found significant differences in field body temperatures of the different morphs. Temperatures were higher in toads with a high extent of dorsal melanization. No variation was registered in operative temperatures between the study locations at the moment of capture and processing. Critical thermal maximum of toads was positively related with the extent of dorsal melanization. Furthermore, we founded significant differences in heating rates between morphs, where individuals with a high extent of dorsal melanization showed greater heating rates than toads with lower dorsal melanization. The color pattern-thermal parameter relationship observed may influence the activity patterns and body size of individuals. Body temperature is a modulator of physiological and behavioral functions in amphibians, influencing daily and seasonal activity, locomotor performance, digestion rate and growth rate.

article,Role of BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels in vascular smooth muscle during the development of environmental cold-induced hypertension,"Wang, Yunxia and Zhang, Shuhua and Ge, Yuzhi and Liu, Yanfeng and Yang, Dongmei and Luo, Jun and Wu, Zhiting",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Background: Cold is an important factor contributing to the high incidence of hypertension. Large conductance calcium-activated potassium (BKCa) channels modulate vascular smooth muscle tone. The objective of this study is to determine whether BKCa channels in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) play a role in the development of hypertension during chronic exposure to cold. Methods: Forty-eight rats were divided into cold-treated group and control group randomly, and then, rats of cold-treated group were exposed to 4 +/- 1 degrees C (4 h/day) and rats of another group were kept at 25 +/- 1 degrees C. Results: Compared to control group, systolic blood pressure of the rats exposed to cold for 2, 4, 6, 8 weeks were increased by 7.14\%, 20.42\%, 40.54\%, 28.74\%, respectively. The BKCa current and BKCa peak current density in aortic VSMC increased significantly as the time of exposure to cold went until the 6th week exposure to cold. At the 6th weeks, the BKCa peak current density in the cold exposed group compared to the control group were increased 345.21\% (n=6, P < 0.01). Furthermore, the expression of BKCa channel alpha-subunit mRNA in the cold-treated rats was higher than control (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Our data showed that BKCa channels have apparent change with the development of hypertension during repeated cold exposure, suggesting that BKCa channel could be thought as a new target for prevention and treating cold-induced hypertension.

article,"Morphological response of the red palm weevil, <i>Rhynchophorus ferrugineus</i>, to a transient low temperature analyzed by computer tomography and holographic microscopy","Leon-Quinto, Trinidad and Fimia, Antonio and Madrigal, Roque and Serna, Arturo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The red palm weevil (RPW), Rhynchophorus ferrugineus, is one of the worst palm pests worldwide. Our study aims to assess its internal and external morphological response to a sudden but transient decrease in the environmental temperature. Wild pre-pupae were subjected for 7 days to either low (5.0 +/- 0.5 degrees C) or ambient temperature (23 +/- 1 degrees C). Such conditions mimic a thermal anomaly happening in the larval stage most exposed to environmental factors. We quantified the changes undergone at: 1) the internal morphology, by X-Ray Computer Tomography (CT); 2) the 3-D integument' architecture, by Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM); and 3) the glucose in hemolymph as a potential endogenous cryoprotectant. From X-ray CT we found that both pre-pupae subjected to cold and those remaining at ambient temperature follow a development where their fat body content decreases while a thick and dense cuticle is formed. There was no difference between both groups in the rate of change of fat body/dense tissues. Nevertheless, the cold group presents a slight developmental delay at the level of hemolymph content. Through DHM we again obtained that pre-pupae subjected to cold have not experienced a stop in their development. However, a more obvious developmental delay is now observed in this group at the level of the integumental roughness. Finally, regarding glucose, we found similar levels in control and ambient temperature larvae, while it was clearly increased in 51,7\% of those subjected to cold. Our whole results provide morphological and biochemical evidence showing that the larval-pupal transition of the RPW continues almost undisturbed even during the quiescent state induced by a sudden and severe cold event. Nevertheless, a certain developmental delay is observed in both internal and external morphology. Additionally, the increased glucose level only found in the cold group suggests that glucose is part of the RPW cold tolerance strategy.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102748,94,NA,NA,102748,Rhynchophorus ferrugineus; Insects; Global climate change; X-ray computer tomography; Digital holographic microscopy; Cryoprotectant; Glucose; Integument; Roughness; Cold hardiness
article,Constant and fluctuating temperature acclimations have similar effects on phenotypic plasticity in springtails,"Hoskins, Jessica L. and Janion-Scheepers, Charlene and Ireland, Elise and Monro, Keyne and Chown, Steven L.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Much interest exists in the extent to which constant versus fluctuating temperatures affect thermal performance traits and their phenotypic plasticity. Theory suggests that effects should vary with temperature, being especially pronounced at more extreme low (because of thermal respite) and high (because of Jensen's inequality) temperatures. Here we tested this idea by examining the effects of constant temperatures (10 to 30 degrees C in 5 degrees C increments) and fluctuating temperatures (means equal to the constant temperatures, but with fluctuations of +/- 5 degrees C) temperatures on the adult (F2) phenotypic plasticity of three thermal performance traits - critical thermal minimum (CTmin), critical thermal maximum (CTmax), and upper lethal temperature (ULT50) in ten species of springtails (Collembola) from three families (Isotomidae 7 spp.; Entomobryidae 2 spp.; Onychiuridae 1 sp.). The lowest mean CTmin value recorded here was -3.56 +/- 1.0 degrees C for Paristoma notabilis and the highest mean CTmax was 43.1 +/- 0.8 degrees C for Hemisotoma thermophila. The Acclimation Response Ratio for CTmin was on average 0.12 degrees C/degrees C (range: 0.04 to 0.21 degrees C/degrees C), but was much lower for CTmax (mean: 0.017 degrees C/degrees C, range: -0.015 to 0.047 degrees C/degrees C) and lower also for ULT50 (mean: 0.05 degrees C/degrees C, range: -0.007 to 0.14 degrees C/degrees C). Fluctuating versus constant temperatures typically had little effect on adult phenotypic plasticity, with effect sizes either no different from zero, or inconsistent in the direction of difference. Previous work assessing adult phenotypic plasticity of these thermal performance traits across a range of constant temperatures can thus be applied to a broader range of circumstances in springtails.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102690,93,NA,NA,102690,Critical thermal limits; Fluctuating temperatures; Field temperatures; Soil animals; Temperate Australia; Thermal tolerance

The horses were housed in individual boxes, while the goats in two indoor pens, under natural photoperiod and natural environmental temperature. In each animal, skin temperature was recorded with the use of a digital infrared camera and a non-contact infrared thermometer, in five regions: neck, shoulder, ribs, flank and croup. Recorded values were compared with the well-established daily rhythm of rectal temperature. Rectal temperature was recorded at the same time by means of a digital thermometer. In horses, a lower value of skin temperature was recorded using the infrared thermometer for the croup region compared to shoulder and flank; a lower value of skin temperature was recorded using thermography for the croup region compared to the shoulder. In goats, a lower value of skin temperature was recorded using the infrared thermometer for the croup region compared to the flank. In both species, higher values of rectal temperature were observed, compared to the temperature recorded at the skin regions using the other two methodologies. Cosinor rhythmometry showed a daily rhythm of rectal and skin temperature recorded using both methodologies in all the examined regions. General linear model (GLM) showed statistically significant effect of breed on all rhythmic parameters; of day of monitoring on amplitude; of site of recording (rectal vs skin regions) on mesor, amplitude and acmphase; and no effect of methodologies used. The results of this study show the differences in rhythmicity of various body regions temperature and their differences in comparison with daily rhythm rectal temperature. The use of infrared methodologies was inaccurate in assessing body core temperature, but its use could be considered for the evaluation of inflammation in the different body sites.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102677,92,NA,NA,102677,Daily rhythm; Cutaneous temperature; Rectal temperature; Digital infrared camera; Infrared thermometer; Horses; Goats

Comparative analyses provide an opportunity to understand how variation in abiotic factors (e.g., operative temperatures, thermal quality) can affect life history traits within species. We studied the thermal ecology of three populations of the rattlesnake Crotalus triseriatus inhabiting different volcanoes in the central region of Mexico using the Hertz et al. (1993) protocol. The average body temperature of dusky rattlesnakes from the three study sites was 22.4 degrees C; mean active body temperature was higher in site 2 than in sites 1 and 3, but no differences between females, males and juveniles nor an interaction among site and sex was found. The thermal quality was low in the three sites, particularly in sites 1 and 3. Thermoregulation accuracy statistically differed among populations: individuals from site 2 were more accurate thermoregulating, while individuals from site 1 were the least accurate.

Moreover, that effect could be different depending on gender due to anatomical and physiological differences between men and women. The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of a prefabricated thermoformable foot orthosis on plantar surface temperature after running and taking gender differences into account. Thirty recreational runners (15 males, mean (standard deviation): 28 (7) years, 69.7 (6.5) kg, 1.74 (0.05) cm and 22.9 (1.7) kg/m(2); and 15 females: 35 (7) years, 55.2 (6.9) kg, 1.63 (0.06) cm and 20.6 (1.9) kg/m(2)) carried out a maximum incremental test as pre-test, and two running tests on a treadmill at the laboratory wearing previously randomized different foot orthoses (thermoformable and prefabricated generic). The plantar surface temperature of the dominant foot sole in ten regions of interest was assessed before and immediately after 30-min running at 75\% of VO2max. The use of thermoformable foot orthoses produced lower temperatures only in men after the run in medial heel (P = 0.033, ES = 0.7), which then disappeared in temperature variation (after - before) (P = 0.910). Regarding gender, women showed lower temperatures before the run in both orthosis conditions (P < 0.039, ES > 0.8), but no differences in temperatures after the run (P = 0.910) in comparison with men. Moreover, absolute temperatures after running were always greater than before the run (P < 0.001, ES > 5.0). In conclusion, the thermoformable foot orthoses do not modify plantar surface temperature after running in healthy runners of either gender, compared to prefabricated generic foot orthoses. Although women present lower baseline plantar temperatures than men, these differences disappear after exercise.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102612,91,NA,NA,102612,Insoles; Foot sole; Running; Infrared thermography; Gender

Towards this end, the role of body temperature in neuronal damage or death during CA needs to be determined. However, few studies have investigated the effect of regional temperature variation on survival rate and neurological outcomes. In this study, adult male rats (12 week-old) were used under the following four conditions: (i) whole-body normothermia (37 +/- 0.5 degrees C) plus (+) no asphyxial CA, (ii) whole-body normothermia + CA, (iii) whole-body hypothermia (33 +/- 0.5 degrees C)+CA, (iv) body hypothermia/brain normothermia + CA, and (v) brain hypothermia/body normothermia + CA. The survival rate after resuscitation was significantly elevated in groups exposed to whole-body hypothermia plus CA and body hypothermia/brain normothermia plus CA, but not in groups exposed to whole-body normothermia combined with CA and brain hypothermia/body normothermia plus CA. However, the group exposed to hypothermia/brain normothermia combined with CA exhibited higher neuroprotective effects against asphyxial CA injury, i.e. improved neurological deficit and neuronal death in the hippocampus compared with those involving whole-body normothermia combined with CA. In addition, neurological deficit and neuronal death in the group of rat exposed to brain hypothermia/body normothermia and CA were similar to those in the rats subjected to whole-body normothermia and CA. In brief, only brain hypothermia during CA was not associated with effective survival rate, neurological function or neuronal protection compared with those under body (but not brain) hypothermia during CA. Our present study suggests that regional temperature in patients during CA significantly affects the outcomes associated with survival rate and neurological recovery.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102466,87,NA,NA,102466,Asphyxial cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation; Ischemia; Hypothermia; Survival rate; Neurological deficit; Delayed neuronal death

Juvenile fish were pre-acclimated to seawater (SW) at 18 degrees C (temperate) or 24 degrees C (warm) for two weeks and then transferred for two weeks to either fresh water (FW) or SW at the respective temperature. Unlike temperate conditions, there is no change in Na+/K+-ATPase ala (nka ala) and Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (nhe3) mRNA expression following FW transfer in warm conditions. This is linked to the high expression of these genes in warm SW compared to temperate SW. Na+/Cl--cotransporter (ncc2a) expression however is increased following FW transfer in temperate and warm conditions. Main transporters involved in ion excretion (Na+/K+/2Cl-1( )cotransporter, nkcc1 and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, cftr) as well as nitrogen excretion (Rh-glycoproteins, rhcg1 and rhbg) and acid-base regulation (V-H+-ATPase, vha-a and b) are highly expressed in SW warm conditions vs FW warm.

article,Unraveling the relationship between the topographic distribution patterns of skin temperature and perspiration response in dromedary camels,"Samara, Emad M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The question of how skin temperature (T-sk), measured at different regions of the skin, can affect sudomotor activity and thus show a pattern in topographic distribution for the perspiration response (PR) rate in dromedary camels was approached and examined in this experiment. Under natural summer conditions, four healthy dromedary bulls, with a mean body mass of 420 kg and age of three years, were measured for T-sk and PR in seven skin regions (i.e. head, neck, shoulder, axillary, hump, flank, and hip) twice daily {[}between 04:00-05:00 h with a mean ambient temperature (T-a) of 26.78 degrees C and relative humidity (RH) of 18.25\% as well as between 13:00-14:00 h with T-a of 4478 degrees C and RH of 5.90 0 /0] for two successive days. The experiment has clearly demonstrated some novel findings. In fact, results pointed out that T-sk (P < 0.05) exhibited a distinct topographic pattern that faded almost completely at a higher T-a. Meanwhile, PR unexpectedly manifested a uniform (P >= 0.05) distribution throughout the experiment, which appears to serve an eco-teleological purpose in dromedaries. Moreover, the obtained findings indicated that the hump and hip regions in particular can work as thermal windows, yet all seven skin regions can predict whole-skin PR fairly accurately (R-2 >= 0.90; P < 0.000). Above all, analysis indicated that T-sk in many regions can affect perspiration in camels (R-2 < 0.82; P < 0.000), but it failed to demonstrate a topographic pattern in perspiration response at higher or lower T-a; therefore, the data attests that no specific relationship may exist between the topography of a perspiration pattern and the level of regional T-sk. Some shortcomings were noted herein, but research dealing with this subject may very well improve our understanding of the basic functional mechanisms of the thermoregulatory system in this species.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.020,84,NA,311-315,NA,Camelus; Thermoregulation; Sweating; Sudomotor; Ecology

Broiler chickens were distributed into 4 groups and fed diets with dietary MO at 0\% or 5\% (MO0 or MO5) and raised under ambient temperature 22 +/- 1 degrees C (N) or 35 +/- 1 degrees C (HS).

article,Effect of temperature on survival and cuticular composition of three different ant species,"Duarte, Bianca F. and Michelutti, Kamylla B. and Antonialli-Junior, William F. and Cardoso, Claudia A. L.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Climatic factors, such as temperature variation, interfere with the survival of insects. To respond to these variations, insects have some specific characteristics. These include water content of the body, thickness of the lipid layer, as well as the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of cuticular chemical components. This study hypothesizes that different ant species respond to temperature changes in different ways and that such differences may be associated with cuticle hydrocarbons (CHCs) and fatty acids. As model ant species, Atta sexdens, Odontomachus bauri and Ectatomma brunneum were used for experimental analyses. Ants were submitted to a water bath for 5 h at different temperatures, and their CHCs and fatty acids were identified and quantified, followed by correlating these chemical compounds with temperature variations and the survival. Temperatures below 30 degrees C did not affect the survival of the three species. E. brunneum had a higher percentage of survival at temperatures above 30 degrees C. O. bauri was .the most sensitive species with 100\% mortality at 40 degrees C. Survival was found to be unrelated to any of the identified fatty acids. However, CHCs underwent significant quantitative and qualitative variation, as shown by an increased percentage of CHCs with longer chain length of linear alkanes at temperatures above 30 degrees C. These increase enables these ants to maintain the integrity of their cuticle and survive at temperatures above 30 degrees C. It can be concluded that the forager ants studied respond differently to temperature variation and that changes in the conformation of CHCs are in line with the ecological characteristics of the different studied species because, they vary in terms of diumal/noctumal foraging and types of environments foraged. Among the three species, E. brunneum foragers were found to be more active under adverse conditions and more tolerant to temperature variation with the correspondingly appropriate changes in CHCs composition.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.02.005,80,NA,178-189,NA,Cuticular hydrocarbons; Ecological characteristics; Formicidae; Fatty acids; Waterproofing; Gas chromatography

There was a temperature by fat type interaction effect on mitochondrial attributes. At 36 degrees C, in birds fed on coconut oil- or beef tallow-supplemented diets, the expression levels of avUCP and avANT mRNA were lower (P < 0.05) but that of HSP70 mRNA was higher (P < 0.01) in comparison with the birds feeding on the olive oil- or soy oil supplemented diets.

Samples were collected with Van Veen grab of 0.0250 m(2) surface area from 7 stations in winter and summer. A total of 42 species were identified that belonged to 22 genera, 18 families, 13 orders, six classes and three phyla. Bivalve with a total abundance of 90\% in winter and 86\% in summer constituted the most abundant group throughout samplings, the highest abundance of which belonged to the family Cardiidae. Gastropods followed bivalve in total abundance (8\%) in summer and polychaetes (7\%) in winter. Statistical analysis indicated significantly higher macrobenthos density at the thermal discharge stations that also took separate positions in the cluster analysis. Temperature was an important factor on the amount of organic matter. Chlorophyll and phaeopigment at the thermal discharge stations were lower than the other stations because of the increased turbulence. The CCA test indicated that temperature was the most influential among all the studied physicochemical factors. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient also showed that the majority of macrobenthic groups had a positive correlation with the organic matter (r = 0.34, p < 0.05). Macrobenthic species were grouped according to their commonalities relative to these three classes using a Bray-Curtis similarity index and similarity profile (SIMPROF) permutation tests analysis (PRIMER 6). Based on the SIMPER analysis, the cockle Hypanis minima and the polychaete Hypaniola kowalewskii with high abundances played the most important role in making differences among the stations, but won't be taken as the ``thermal indicating species{''}.

With this hypothesis an experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of elevated temperature on Labeo rohita fingerlings and potential of dietary L-tryptophan (TRP) in mitigating the effects elevated temperature and enhancing the non-specific immunity. Seven hundred and twenty fishes were randomly distributed in three different thermal groups each with three replicates. The thermal groups were ambient temperature (26 degrees C), 34 and 38 degrees C. Then each thermal groups were fed with four different formulated diets containing 0. 0.36\%, 0.72\% and 1.44\% TRP. The effect of dietary TRP supplementation was studied on stress responses, such as cortisol, blood glucose, histopathological changes in liver and kidney and immuno-hematological changes such as red blood cell count (RBC), haemoglobin (Hb), white blood cell count (WBC), lysozyme, nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT), total serum protein, albumin, globulin and albumin globulin ratio. Subsequently the treated fish were subjected to challenge test with Aeromonas hydrophila. In the present study, primary stress markers were noticeably (p < 0.01) elevated with temperature stress and levels were reduced with nutritional supplementation of TRP. Similarly, immuno-hematological parameters were altered with the exposure of temeparture stress and got improved with dietary TRP supplementation. Results of the present study suggest that dietary supplementation of 1.44\% tryptophan has definitive role in the mitigation of temperature stress and gives protection against bacterial infection to L. rohita.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.03.010,74,NA,55-62,NA,L-Tryptophan; Thermal stress; Non-specific immunity; Bacterial challenege; Histopathology

In the present study, we report the tolerance of camel oocytes and cumulus cells to acute and chronic heat shock. Camel oocytes and cumulus cells were exposed to acute (45 degrees C for 2 h) and chronic (45 degrees C for 20 h) heat shock. Our results demonstrated that acute and chronic heat shock altered malondialdehyde concentration, which is a marker for oxidative stress. Furthermore, the heat shock reduced glutathione levels during in vitro oocyte maturation. The expression of two well-known heat shock proteins HSP70 and HSP90 were increased similarly in oocytes and cumulus cells after acute heat shock. Oocytes were less tolerant to the short acute heat shock, and showed decreased maturation, which leads to reduction in ooplasmic diameter and an increase in chromosomal count abnormalities. Furthermore, the pro-apoptotic genes P53 and BAX had increased expression levels, whereas for the anti-apoptotic gene such as BCL2 expression levels was decreased. On the other hand, the cumulus cells tolerated acute and chronic heat shock, as evident by the increase in HSP70 and HSP90 expression and steady expression levels of P53, BAX, and BCL2 after acute hyperthermia. Cumulus cells regained their vitality and ability to proliferate after chronic hyperthermia and showed wound healing capabilities after 9 days of chronic hyperthermia. Collectively, these results indicate the adaptive tolerance of camel somatic cells to acute and chronic heat shock, which is lethal to cells in many other mammals.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.03.014,74,NA,47-54,NA,HSPs; BAX; P53; Heat stress; Camel

Hence, we examined whether central and/or peripheral acclimatisation to the combined stressors of cold and hypoxia would be developed in four men following an 11-day man-hauling expedition on this polar region. Before and after the journey, participants performed a static whole-body immersion in 21 degrees C water, during which they were breathing a hypoxic gas (partial pressure of inspired 02: 97 mmHg). To evaluate their local responses to cold, participants also immersed the hand into 8 degrees C water for 30 min, while they were whole-body immersed and mildly hypothermic {[}i.e. 0.5 degrees C fall in rectal temperature (T-rec) from individual pre-immersion values]. T-rec, and aldn temperature (T-ak), skin blood flux, and oxygen uptake (reflecting shivering thermogenesis) were monitored throughout.

This behavioral change can be beneficial by enhancing the host's immune response and increasing the animal's chance of survival, but it can also be detrimental in terms of host energetic requirements and enzymatic performance. Thus, we examined whether captive-bred African house snakes (Lamprophis fuliginosus) employed behavioral fever in response to pathogen stimulus. Twenty-one African house snakes were injected separately with three different strains of ultraviolet (UV) light killed bacteria (Escherichia colt, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica). We found an increased variance of hourly cloacal temperatures following exposure to pathogens in male but not female house snakes. We did not, however, find a significant febrile response to pathogen exposure as measured via mean cloacal temperature. This research adds critical information to the field of reptilian physiology as this field remains understudied.

Four healthy volunteers completed 7 consecutive days of heat acclimation which included 2 h of treadmill walking in a 40 degrees C and 40\% relative humidity environment. A modified constant hyperthermia protocol was used as workloads were increased each day to maintain a constant core temperature over the 7 days of heat acclimation. Forearm sweat was collected 3 times during each 2 h exercise bout on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 of heat acclimation. Forearm sweat rate and sweat sodium ion concentration were determined from each sample. The results showed that there was a significant (p < 0.05) downward shift in the mean sweat rate vs. sweat sodium ion concentration relationship on days 3, 5, and 7 of heat acclimation, as compared to the pre-heat acclimation (day 1) data. Thus, at any given sweat rate, heat acclimation resulted in a significantly lower sweat sodium ion concentration. The response was very rapid and occurred following only 2 consecutive days of heat exposure (i.e., day 3 vs. day 1 data). Furthermore, the calculated sweat sodium ion concentration, at a sweat rate of 1 mu l/cm(2)/min, decreased linearly (r = -0.50, p < 0.05) during the 7 days of heat acclimation. Such results suggest that heat acclimation rapidly improves sodium ion reabsorption from the eccrine sweat gland duct as evidenced by significant reductions in the sweat sodium ion concentration.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.12.001,71,NA,237-240,NA,Heat acclimation; Thermoregulation; Sweat sodium ion concentration; Eccrine gland

It has been demonstrated that respiratory patterns cease and insects do not recover once the CTmax), temperature has been reached. However, if high temperatures are maintained following the CTmax, researchers have observed a curious phenomenon whereby the insect body releases a large burst of carbon dioxide at a rate and magnitude that often exceed that of the live insect. This carbon dioxide release has been termed the post mortal peak (PMP). We demonstrate here that the PMP is observed only at high temperatures, is oxygen-dependent, is prevented by cyanide exposure, and is associated with concomitant consumption of oxygen. We conclude that the PMP derives from highly active, aerobic metabolism in the mitochondria. The insect tracheal system contains air-filled tubes that reach deep into the tissues and allow mitochondria access to oxygen even upon organismal death. This unique condition permits the investigation of mitochondrial function during thermal failure in a manner that cannot be achieved using vertebrate organisms or in vitro preparations.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.08.009,69,NA,267-274,NA,Thermal maximum; Insect; Respiration; Tracheal system; Mitochondria
article,Selection and inheritance of developmental variants of <i>Propylea</i> <i>dissecta</i> under thermal stress conditions,"Siddiqui, Arshi and Omkar and Mishra, Geetanjali",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The present study aims to understand the influence of two thermal extremes (15 degrees C and 35 degrees C) as thermal stressors on the selected line of developmental variants (slow and fast developers) in Propylea dissecta and to compare it with the response at the optimal temperature (27 degrees C). The ratio of slow and fast developers within an egg batch differed with thermal extremes irrespective of Fl and F15 generations. Adult body mass got depressed after selection for control slow developers at 15 degrees C while it got enhanced for selected fast developers at 35 degrees C. More selected slow developers were found at low temperature and more selected fast developers at high temperature. Selection probably favours the enhancement of immature survival and emergence ratio which was found to be highest for selected fast developers at 35 degrees C and selected slow developers at 15 degrees C. Population level disparity on thermal confliction was observed in ladybird post selection over several generations. Therefore, we put forward that exposure thermal extremes over a long duration, causes an adaptive differentiation in thermal responses of slow and fast developers.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.08.012,69,NA,275-280,NA,Adaptation; Developmental variants; Isolated line; Stress response
article,Validation of a new whole-body cryotherapy chamber based on forced convection,"Bouzigon, Romain and Arfaoui, Ahlem and Grappe, Frederic and Ravier, Gilles and Jarlot, Benoit and Dugue, Benoit",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Whole-body cryotherapy (WBC) and partial-body cryotherapy (PBC) are two methods of cold exposure (from -110 to -195 degrees C according to the manufacturers). However, temperature measurement in the cold chamber during a PBC exposure revealed temperatures ranging from -25 to -50 degrees C next to the skin of the subjects (using isolating layer placed between the sensor and the skin). This discrepancy is due to the human body heat transfer. Moreover, on the surface of the body, an air layer called the boundary layer is created during the exposure and limits heat transfer from the body to the cabin air. Incorporating forced convection in a chamber with a participant inside could reduce this boundary layer. The aim of this study was to explore the use of a new WBC technology based on forced convection (frontal unilateral wind) through the measurement of skin temperature. Fifteen individuals performed a 3-min WBC exposure at -40 degrees C with an average wind speed of 2.3 m s(-1). The subjects wore a headband, a surgical mask, underwear, gloves and slippers. The skin temperature of the participants was measured with a thermal camera just before exposure, just after exposure and at 1, 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20 min after exposure. Mean skin temperature significantly dropped by 11 degrees C just after exposure (p < 0.001) and then significantly increased during the 20-min post exposure period (p < 0.001). No critically low skin temperature was observed at the end of the cold exposure. This decrease was greater than the mean decreases in all the cryosauna devices with reported exposures between -140 degrees C and -160 degrees C and those in two other WBC devices with reported exposures between -60 degrees C and -110 degrees C. The use of this new technology provides the ability to reach decreases in skin temperature similar to other technologies.

article,Supplemental intermittent-day heat training and the lactate threshold,"Gollan, Stuart and Chalmers, Samuel and Alderton, Stephen and Norton, Kevin",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Heat acclimation over consecutive days has been shown to improve aerobic-based performance. Recently, it has been suggested that heat training can improve performance in a temperate environment. However, due to the multifactorial training demands of athletes, consecutive-day heat training may not be suitable. The current study aimed to investigate the effect of brief (8x30 min) intermittent (every 3-4 days) supplemental heat training on the second lactate threshold point (LT2) in temperate and hot conditions. 21 participants undertook eight intermittent-day mixed-intensity treadmill exercise training sessions in hot (30 degrees C; 50\% relative humidity {[}RH]) or temperate (18 degrees C; 30\% RH) conditions. A pre- and post-incremental exercise test occurred in temperate (18 degrees C; 30\% RH) and hot conditions (30 degrees C; 50\% RH) to determine the change in LT2. The heat training protocol did not improve LT2 in temperate (Effect Size {[}ES] 90 confidence interval=0.10 +/- 0.16) or hot (ES=0.26 0.26) conditions. The primary finding was that although the intervention group had a change greater than the SWC, no statistically significant improvements were observed following an intermittent eight day supplemental heat training protocol comparable to a control group training only in temperate conditions. This is likely due to the brief length of each heat training session and/or the long duration between each heat exposure.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.01.011,65,NA,16-20,NA,Performance; Hot; Acclimation; Intermittent; Running

Eight male lowlanders underwent a normoxic (NC) and, in a separate occasion, a normobaric hypoxic confinement (RC; FO2: 0.154; simulated altitude similar to 3400 m). Before and after each confinement, subjects immersed for 30 min their right hand and, in a different session, their right foot in 8 degrees C water, while breathing either room air (AIR) or a hypoxic gas mixture (HYPO). Throughout the cold-water immersion tests, thermal responses were monitored with thermocouples on fingers and-Wes. Neither confinement influenced thermal responses in the fingers during the AIR or HYPO test. In the foot, by contrast, HC, but not NC, reduced the average toe temperature by similar to 1.5 degrees C (p=0.03), both during the AIR and HYPO test. We therefore conclude that a 10-day confinement to normobaric hypoxia per se augments cold-induced vasoconstriction in the toes, but not in the fingers.

article,A critical review of the use and performance of different function types for modeling temperature-dependent development of arthropod larvae,"Quinn, Brady K.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature-dependent development influences production rates of arthropods, including crustaceans important to fisheries and agricultural pests. Numerous candidate equation types (development functions) exist to describe the effect of temperature on development time, yet most studies use only a single type of equation and there is no consensus as to which, if any model predicts development rates better than the others, nor what the consequences of selecting a potentially incorrect model equation are on predicted development times. In this study, a literature search was performed of studies fitting development functions to development data of arthropod larvae (99 species). The published data of most (79) of these species were then fit with 33 commonly-used development functions. Overall performance of each function type and consequences of using a function other than the best one to model data were assessed. Performance Was also related to taxonomy and the range of temperatures examined. The majority (91.1\%) of studies were found to not use the best function out of those tested. Using the incorrect model lead to significantly less accurate (e.g., mean difference SE 85.9 +/- 27.4\%, range: -1.7 to 1725.5\%) predictions of development times than the best function. Overall, more complex functions performed poorly relative to simpler ones. However, performance of some complex functions improved when wide temperature ranges were tested, which tended to be confined to studies of insects or arachnids compared with those of crustaceans. Results indicate the biological significance of choosing the best fitting model to describe temperature-dependent development time data.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.11.013,63,NA,65-77,NA,Temperature; Arthropod; Larval development; Development functions; Moulting rete
article,Conventional and novel body temperature measurement during rest and exercise induced hyperthermia,"Towey, Colin and Easton, Chris and Simpson, Robert and Pedlar, Charles",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Despite technological advances in thermal sensory equipment, few core temperature (T-CORE) measurement techniques have met the established validity criteria in exercise science. Additionally, there is debate as to what method serves as the most practically viable, yet upholds the proposed measurement accuracy. This study assessed the accuracy of current and novel T-CORE measurement techniques in comparison to rectal temperature (T-REC) as a reference standard. Fifteen well-trained subjects (11 male, 4 female) completed 60 min of exercise at an intensity equating to the lactate threshold; measured via a discontinuous exercise test. T-REC was significantly elevated from resting values (37.2 +/- 0.3 degrees C) at the end of moderate intensity exercise (39.6 +/- 0.04 degrees C; P=0.001). Intestinal telemetric pill (TNPILL) temperature and temporal artery temperature (T-TEM) did not differ significantly from T-REC at rest or during exercise (P > 0.05). However, aural canal temperature (T-AUR) and thermal imaging temperature (T-IMA) Were both significantly lower than Tanc (P < 0.05). Bland Altman analysis revealed only T-PILL was within acceptable limits of agreement (mean bias; 0.04 degrees C), while T-TEM, T-AUR and T-IMA demonstrated mean bias values outside of the acceptable range ( > 0.27 degrees C). Against T-REC, these results support the use of T-PILL over all other techniques as a valid measure of T-CORE at rest and during exercise induced hyperthermia. Novel findings illustrate that T-IMA (when measured at the inner eye canthus) shows poor agreement to T-REC during rest and exercise, which is similar to other `surface' measures.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.11.010,63,NA,124-130,NA,Core temperature; Moderate exercise; Hyperthermia

R.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Rapidly cooling pigs after heat stress (HS) results in a pathophysiological condition, and because rapid temperature fluctuations may be associated with reduced reproductive success in sows, it lends itself to the hypothesis that these conditions may be linked. Objectives were to determine the effects of rapid cooling on thermal response and future reproductive success in pigs. Thirty-six replacement gifts (137.8 +/- 0.9 kg BW) were estrus synchronized and then 14.1 +/- 0.4 d after estrus confirmation, pigs were exposed to thermoneutral conditions (TN; n=12; 19.7 +/- 0.9 degrees C) for 6 h, or HS (36.3 +/- 0.5 degrees C) for 3 h, followed by 3 h of rapid cooling (HSRC; n=12; immediate TN exposure and water dousing) or gradual cooling (HSGC; n=12; gradual decrease to TN conditions) repeated over 2 d. Vaginal (T-V) and gastrointestinal tract temperatures (T-GI) were obtained every 15 min, and blood was collected on d 1 and d 2 during the HS and recovery periods at 180 and 60 min, respectively. Pigs were bred 8.3 +/- 0.8 d after thermal treatments over 2 d. Reproductive tracts were collected and total fetus number and viability were recorded 28.0 +/- 0.8 d after insemination. HS increased T-V and T-GI (P=0.01; 0.98 degrees C) in HSRC and HSGC compared to TN pigs. During recovery, T-V was reduced from 15 to 105 min (P=0.01; 033 degrees C) in HSRC compared to HSGC pigs, but no overall differences in T-GI were detected (P<0.05; 39.67 degrees C). Rapid cooling increased (P<0.05) TNF alpha compared to HSGC and TN pigs during recovery-d 1 (55.2\%), HS-d 2 (35.1\%), and recovery-d 2 (64.9\%). Viable fetuses tended to be reduced (P=0.08; 10.5\%) and moribund fetuses tended to be increased (P=0.09; 159.3\%) in HSRC compared to HSGC and TN pigs. In summary, rapid cooling prior to breeding may contribute to reduced fetal viability and reproductive success in pigs.

According to the ``thermal melanism hypothesis{''}, cold environmental temperature should increase the quantity of melanin that is deposited in the integument thereby facilitating radiative warming. We studied the influences of water temperature (26 degrees C or 31 degrees C) and substrate color (black or white) on the degree of melanization in the red-eared slider, Trachemys scripta elegans, under laboratory conditions. Turtles reared on a black substrate, or in 26 degrees C water, for 120 days were darker than those reared on a white substrate or in 31 degrees C water. A potential tradeoff between the fitness benefits of crypsis and the benefits of radiatiVe warming through melanism was detected because turtles reared in 26 degrees C water and on a white substrate were darker than those reared on a white substrate and in 31 degrees C water. Low temperatures limited metabolic processes because turtles reared in 26 degrees C water grew more slowly than those reared in 31 degrees C water. However, histological analyses revealed that melanization was a dynamic process in all treatments confirming that the degree of melanization in the cool water treatment was not influenced by the initial and relatively dark hatchling coloration in individuals that grew relatively slowly.

The multiple stressor experiment was conducted in twenty-four ewes (12 Santa Ines and 12 Morada Nova ewes). Both heat stress and pregnancy stress was common to all four groups. However, the animals were divided into further two groups within each breed on the basis of nutrition regimen. According the groupings were: Group 1 (Six Santa Ines ewes; heat stress; nutrition at 0.5\% of BW; single pregnancy); Group 2 (Six Santa Ines ewes; heat stress; nutrition at 1.5\% BW; twin pregnancy); groups Group 3 (Six Morada Nova ewes; heat stress; nutrition at 0.5\% of BW; single pregnancy); Group 4 (Six Morada Nova ewes; heat stress; nutrition at 1.5\% BW; twin pregnancy). All the animals in the experiment were pregnant. Heat stress was induced by exposing all animals to summer heat stress in outside environment while the nutritional regimen followed was at 0.5\% and 1.5\% level of body weight (BW) respectively in each breed. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design with two breeds, two nutritional treatments and two pregnancy types, 10 repetitions for physiological parameters and six for blood parameters, with repeated measures over time. Physiological parameters (respiratory rate, pulse rate and rectal temperature) were measured with the animals at rest in the morning and afternoon, 0600-0700 and 1300-1400 h, respectively, every seven days. Blood samples were collected every 14 d for determination of serum glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, urea and creatinine. We found interaction effect between breed and pregnancy type on respiratory rate and rectal temperature with greater values in Santa Ines ewes than Morada Nova ewes. However, there was no significant fixed effect of pregnancy type and supplementation level on physiological responses of breeds. Environmental factor (period of the day) had influenced the physiological responses of ewes during all gestational period. Santa Ines ewes had greater serum glucose concentration at 105 d and 120 d of gestation compared to the Morada Nova ewes. Morada Nova ewes had greater concentrations of triglycerides, urea at 120 d, 150 d and also greater cholesterol at 105 d, 135 d and 150 d of gestation compared with Santa Ines ewes.

article,Core and body surface temperatures of nesting leatherback turtles (<i>Dermochelys coriacea</i>),"Burns, Thomas J. and McCafferty, Dominic J. and Kennedy, Malcolm W.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) are the largest species of marine turtle and the fourth most massive extant reptile. In temperate waters they maintain body temperatures higher than surrounding seawater through a combination of insulation, physiological, and behavioural adaptations. Nesting involves physical activity in addition to contact with warm sand and air, potentially presenting thermal challenges in the absence of the cooling effect of water, and data are lacking with which to understand their nesting thermal biology. Using non-contact methods (thermal imaging and infrared thermometry) to avoid any stress-related effects, we investigated core and surface temperature during nesting. The mean SE core temperature was 31.4 +/- 0.05 degrees C (newly emerged eggs) and was not correlated with environmental conditions on the nesting beach. Core temperature of leatherbacks was greater than that of hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) nesting at a nearby colony, 30.0 +/- 0.13 degrees C. Body surface temperatures of leatherbacks showed regional variation, the lateral and dorsal regions of the head were warmest while the carapace was the coolest surface. Surface temperature increased during the early nesting phases, then levelled off or decreased during later phases with the rates of change varying between body regions. Body region, behavioural phase of nesting and air temperature were found to be the best predictors of surface temperature. Regional variation in surface temperature were likely due to alterations in blood supply, and temporal changes in local muscular activity of flippers during the different phases of nesting. Heat exchange from the upper surface of the turtle was dominated by radiative heat loss from all body regions and small convective heat gains to the carapace and front flippers.

In particular we (1) tested for the presence of physiological freeze protection, (2) evaluated autumnal activity and overwintering behaviour with respect to freeze avoidance and (3) assessed the importance of different high-elevation microhabitats for behavioural thermoregulation. Common frogs did not exhibit any signs of freeze protection when experiencing temperatures around 0 degrees C. Instead they retreated to open water for protection and overwintering. High elevation common frogs remained active for around the same period of time than their conspecifics at lower elevation. Our results suggest that at mid and high elevation common frogs use freeze avoidance alone to survive temperatures below 0 degrees C. The availability of warm microhabitats, such as rock or pasture, provides high elevation frogs with the opportunity of behavioural thermoregulation and thus allows them to remain active at temperatures at which common frogs at lower elevation cease activity.

article,"Temperature, field activity and post-feeding metabolic response in the Asian house gecko, <i>Hemidactylus frenatus</i>","Lei, Juan and Booth, David T.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature has significant effects on physiological activities and geographical distribution of ectotherms. The Asian house gecko Hemidactylus frenatus has become one of the most widely distributed reptiles in the world and is an invasive species in Australia. Since being introduced into northern Australia. Asian house geckos have spread rapidly and expanded into south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales. Despite their rapid spread, there have been few studies that address thermal adaptability of this species. In order to understand how temperature might limit the distribution and feeding behavior of H. frenat-us we observed gecko foraging activities in the wild over the winter period, measured the temperature at which voluntary feeding ceases, and assessed the effect of temperature (30, 25, 20, and 18 degrees C) on post-feeding metabolic rate. Resting metabolic rate and post-feeding peak in metabolic rate decreased with low temperature, while the duration of elevated metabolic rate after feeding increased at lower temperature. The SDA coefficient (a ratio of the energy expended due to the post-feeding rise in metabolic rate to the energy contained within the meal) did not change systematically with ambient temperature. Field observations and voluntary feeding experiments showed that H. frenat-us stop feeding when ambient temperature drops below 17 degrees C, so that persistent night time temperatures below 17 degrees C may be limiting the distribution of this species.

article,Body surface temperature distribution in relation to body composition in obese women,"Chudecka, Monika and Lubkowska, Anna and Kempinska-Podhorodecka, Agnieszka",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Adipose tissue levels and human obesity are known to be associated with increased heat production. At the same time, subcutaneous adipose tissue provides an insulating layer that impedes heat loss. The energy implications of obesity and body thermoregulatory mechanisms remain relatively poorly understood. This study attempted to examine the potential relationship between body composition (subcutaneous and visceral fat) determined by bioimpedance as well as BMI (body mass index), and skin surface temperature distribution recorded at rest. One specific aim of this study was to draw a thermal map of body areas in obese women and compare this with women of normal body mass, and thus to identify body regions within which heat transfer is particularly impeded. As high fat content is a good insulator, it could reduce the body's ability to respond effectively to changes in environmental temperature, which would be problematic for thermal homeostasis. Our results showed that core temperature did not differ between obese and normal body mass participants, while skin temperature of most body surfaces was lower in obese subjects. The results of regression analysis showed that the mean body surface temperature (T-mean) decreased with increasing percentage of body fat (PBF) of the abdominal area. The opposite relationship was observed for the front area of the hand (simultaneous increase in T-mean and PBF). We also found a negative correlation between BMI and T-mean of the thigh areas, both the front and the back. From this it could be concluded that the mean body surface temperature is dependent on body fat. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

article,A study of human skin and surface temperatures in stable and unstable thermal environments,"Liu, Yanfeng and Wang, Lijuan and Liu, Jiaping and Di, Yuhui",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Skin temperature is a common physiological parameter that reflects human thermal responses. The purpose of this research was to investigate the effects of radiant temperature on human skin temperature and surface temperature in stable and unstable thermal environments. For a clothed human body, the skin temperature is the surface temperature of the skin, while the surface temperature is the outer surface temperature of the clothes. For this aim, the radiant temperature from 26 to 38 degrees C and then from 38 to 26 degrees C was controlled in three different ways; in stable condition keeping stable above 40 min, in unstable condition at a rate of 2 degrees C/5 min, and in another unstable condition at a rate of 2 degrees C/10 min. Experimental data showed that at the same radiant temperature, the local skin/surface temperatures during the radiant temperature decrease were higher compared to those during the radiant temperature increase. During the radiant temperature increase/decrease, the increments/decrements of the mean skin temperature and the mean surface temperature decreased gradually from the stable condition, 2 degrees C/10 min to 2 degrees C/5 min. Compared to surface temperature, the faster the radiant temperature changed, the more obviously the change in skin temperature was delayed. These data demonstrated that the human body has physiological adaptability to unstable thermal environments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Thermal biology of <i>Liolaemus</i> lizards from the high Andes: Being efficient despite adversity,"Valdecantos, Soledad and Martinez, Virginia and Lobo, Fernando and Cruz, Felix B.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"We studied the efficiency of thermoregulation in four high elevation Liolaemus species in the Andes of Salta, Argentina; Liolaemus irregularis, Liolaemus multicolor, Liolaemus albiceps and Liolaemus yanalcu. One of the species, L irregularis, shows a broad distribution being in allopatry in some localities and in sympatry with L albiceps, L multicolor and L yanalcu at different sites. Together with this variation in assemblages, the degree of phylogenetic relatedness is different with L irregularis being most closely related to L albiceps than to the other two species (L multicolor and L yanalcu). We measured body (T-b), microenvironmental (T-a, T-s) and operative temperatures (T-e) in the field, and preferred body temperature (T-pref) in laboratory for each one of the species of assemblages. Three out of the four species showed a high thermoregulatory efficiency except for L. yanalcu, a moderate thermoregulator. The species studied here show high T-b in the field compared to most of the recorded Liolaemus species. However, the T-pref values were similar to other Liolaemus species. No evidence of thermal niche segregation between species in sympatry was observed. Our results suggest that the species studied here, despite living at high elevation and harsh climatic conditions are able to behaviorally or physiologically thermoregulate to achieve T(b)s close to their T-pref, probably because of low predation risk and perhaps low levels of competition.

The present study characterizes the energy response and fatty acid metabolism in Onychostoma macrolepis exposed to low temperature (10 degrees C). The results demonstrated that cold stress remarkably disrupted the energy homeostasis of O. macrolepis, then the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) could strategically mobilize carbohydrates and lipids. In particular, when the O. macrolepis were faced with cold stress, the lipolysis was stimulated along with the enhanced fatty acid beta-oxidation for energy, while the fatty acid synthesis was supressed in the early stage. Additionally, the fatty acid composition analysis suggested that saturated fatty acid (SFA) might accumulate while monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) in storage lipids (mainly containing non-polar lipid, NPL) could be utilized to supply energy during cold acclimation. Altogether, this study may provide some meritorious for understanding the cold-tolerant mechanism of fish in the viewpoint of energy balance combined with fatty acid metabolism, and thus to contribute to this species rearing in fish farms in the future.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102725,94,NA,NA,102725,Energy homeostasis; Fatty acid metabolism; Adenine nucleotide; AMPK; Cold stress; Onychostoma macrolepis
article,Sex difference in cerebral blood flow velocity during exercise hyperthermia,"Rivas, Eric and Allie, Kyleigh N. and Salvador, Paolo M. and Schoech, Lauren and Martinez, Mauricio",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Introduction: Cerebral blood flow and thermal perception during physical exercise under hyperthermia conditions in females are poorly understood. Because sex differences exist for blood pressure control, resting middle cerebral artery velocity (MCA(Vmean)), and pain, we tested the hypothesis that females would have greater reductions in MCAv(mean) and increased thermal perceptual strain during exercise hyperthermia compared to males. Methods: Twenty-two healthy active males and females completed 60 min of matched exercise metabolic heat production in a 1) control cool (24.0 +/- 0.0 degrees C; 14.4 +/- 3.4\% Rh) and 2) hot (42.3 +/- 0.3 degrees C; 28.4 +/- 5.2\% Rh) conditions in random order, separated by at least 3 days while MCA(vmean), thermal comfort, and preference was obtained during the exercise. Results: Compared to 36 degrees C mean body temperature (M-bt), as hyperthermia increased to 39 degrees C Mbt, females had a greater reduction in absolute (MCAv(mean)), and relative change (\%Delta MCAv(mean)) and conductance (\%Delta MCAv(mean) conductance) in MCA(Vmean) compared to males (Interaction: Temperature x Sex, P <= 0.002). During exercise in cool conditions, absolute and conductance MCAv(mean) was maintained from rest through exercise; however, females had greater MCA(Vmean) compared to males (Main effect: Sex, P < 0.0008). We also found disparities in females' perceptual thermal comfort and thermal preference. These differences may be associated with a greater reduction in partial pressure of end-tidal CO2, and different cardiovascular and blood pressure control to exercise under hyperthermia. Conclusions: In summary, females exercise cerebral blood flow velocity is reduced to a greater extent (25\% vs 15\%) and the initial reduction occurs at lower hyperthermia mean body temperatures (similar to 38 degrees C vs similar to 39 degrees C) and are under greater thermal perceptual strain compared to males.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102741,94,NA,NA,102741,Thermoregulation; Thermal perceptual strain; Cardiovascular response; Heat stress; Brain blood flow
article,Low caffeine dose improves intermittent sprint performance in hot and humid environments,"Nakamura, Daisuke and Tanabe, Yoko and Arimitsu, Takuma and Hasegawa, Hiroshi and Takahashi, Hideyuki",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"While the effects of caffeine have been evaluated in relation to endurance exercise, few studies have assessed the ergogenic effects of low caffeine doses on intermittent exercise performance in hot and humid environments. Thus, we aimed to determine the effects of low-dose caffeine supplementation on intermittent exercise performance under these conditions. Eight male soccer players (age, 19.9 +/- 0.3 years; height, 173.7 +/- 6.3 cm; body mass, 65.1 +/- 5.5 kg; (V) over dotO(2)max, 50.0 +/- 3.1 mL.kg(-1).min(-1)) participated in this double-blind, randomized, crossover study. Caffeine was orally administered at 60 min before exercise (dosage, 3 mg.kg(-1)). The participants completed a 90-min intermittent sprint cycling protocol under two conditions (after receiving caffeine and placebo) at 32 degrees C and at 70\% relative humidity. A significant improvement in the total amount of work was observed in the caffeine condition compared to the placebo condition (155.0 +/- 15.8 vs 150.8 +/- 14.5 kJ, respectively; p < 0.05, d = 0.28). In contrast, the rectal temperature measured at the end of exercise showed no significant difference between the conditions (38.9 +/- 0.4 degrees C and 38.7 +/- 0.5 degrees C in the caffeine and placebo conditions, respectively; p > 0.05, d = 0.57). Other thermal responses, such as the mean skin temperature, heart rate, or sweat volume, were not significantly different between these conditions. These results suggested that a low caffeine dose improved the intermittent sprint performance and the reasons could be explained by the fact that a low caffeine dose ingestion did not affect the thermoregulatory responses compared to the placebo condition and, thus, did not attenuate its ergogenic effect on exercise in hot and humid environments.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102698,93,NA,NA,102698,Ergogenic effect; Team sports; Heat; CISP

However, little is known about the effect of heat stress on the antioxidant responses of Araneae species. Hylyphantes graminicola is a dominant predator in many cropping systems in China. In the present study, the effect of short-term heat stress (36, 38, 40 or 42 degrees C) on the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, the activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase {[}SOD], catalase {[}CAT], peroxidases {[}POD] and glutathione-S-transferases GST]), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations and survival of H. graminicola spiderlings and adults were investigated. The results showed that H. graminicola adults had a significantly higher survival rate compared to spiderlings at 40 degrees C. The heat stress increased ROS contents in H. graminicola. The SOD, CAT, POD and GST activities increased in spiderlings and adults under heat stress. These data suggest a defensive function for these enzymes in alleviating oxidative damage. Specifically, SOD plays a key role in reducing the high level of superoxide radicals in spiderlings and adults. Moreover, the POD and CAT capabilities for scavenging H2O2 in spiderlings were similar, and CAT may play a more important role than POD in scavenging H2O2 in adults at 42 degrees C. The spiderling TAC increased significantly at 40 and 42 degrees C, and the adult TAC was stable at 36-40 degrees C but decreased at 42 degrees C. These data suggest that TAC was insufficient in H. graminicola adults under more severe stress conditions.

In this work, the thermal effects of body color of some species of aquatics like Orcas and Dusky dolphins are investigated with respect to their swimming routes and geometric and behavioral characteristics. Considering the marine and atmospheric characteristics of these aquatics' routes, a thermal analysis is performed. The surrounding fluxes including the water flux, sun irradiation, and core temperature are considered in an energy balance to determine the skin temperature of the top side of the animal/organism's body. To study the effects of color on the surface temperature of the aquatic species, an experiment is carried out in the water on a flat plate with black and white color. Applying a turbulent analytical solution for heated boundary layers, it will be shown that the black color on the top of the bodies of these marine organisms is very efficient in terms of skin drag reduction. Moreover, to investigate the effects of the temperature on underwater skin friction drag reduction, the turbulent flow is simulated around a flat plate and a 2- dimensional modeled Killer whale at different temperatures. The results show that the top black body color of Orca and Dusky dolphin decreases their skin friction drag by 7\%. This study will also provide the reason for this evolution of color scheme of other extremely fast marine animals, such as billfish, whales, and sharks. This method of drag reduction can be considered as one of the effective factors in skin drag reduction of underwater robots.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.018,84,NA,292-310,NA,Orca; Dusky dolphin; Turbulent flow; Irradiation; Drag; Energy balance

This protein has gained notable research attention for its highly dynamic expression in response to seasonal freezing stress, while its over-expression has been documented to enhance freeze tolerance in cold-susceptible cultured cells. This study further characterizes the properties of this novel protein with regards to thermal stability and ice recrystallization inhibition (i.e. IRI) activity. Thermal stability was assessed using differential scanning fluorimetry, with an experimental T-m value of 50.8 +/- 0.1 degrees C. Potential IRI activity of Fr10 was evaluated using a recently developed nanoparticle-based colorimetric assay, where Fr10 displayed the ability to prevent freezeinduced aggregation of gold nanoparticles. Based upon this assay, Fr10 protein appeared to have a low level of IRI activity and it was therefore predicted that one of Fr10's biological functions may be to inhibit ice crystal growth via recrystallization. A SPLAT cooling assay was then employed to directly characterize the IRI properties of Fr10 and provide further insight into this hypothesis. In the presence of 30 mu M of Fr10, a 40\% reduction in the mean grain size of ice crystals relative to the control samples was observed, thus introducing the possibility of Fr10 to inhibit ice recrystallization. Collectively, the results from this study provide new insight into the potential of further exploring the potential of this vertebrate freeze-responsive protein in cryoprotection.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.030,84,NA,426-430,NA,Fr10; Thermal shift assay; Rana sylvatica; Freeze tolerance; Ice recrystallization

article,Effect of incubation temperature on sex-dependent embryo mortality and morphological traits in Mallard,"Kolackova, Martina and Kreisinger, Jakub and Albrecht, Tomas and Horak, David",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Although birds have genetically determined sex, the sex ratio has been reported to deviate from parity in several studies. Temperature-dependent sex determination, which is common in reptiles, is absent in birds. However, females are able to adjust their investment into eggs according to the sex of the embryo, which may cause sex specific embryonic mortality. Incubation temperature may also cause sex-biased embryonic mortality, and it may differentially affect the phenotype of male and female hatchlings. We aimed to investigate differences between male and female Mallard embryos regarding their egg size, mortality during incubation and hatchling phenotype in relation to incubation temperature. Mallard eggs were incubated under six constant incubation temperatures (ranging from 35.0 to 38.0 degrees C). Hatchings were weighed, and their morphological traits were measured. We determined the sex of hatchlings and unhatched embryos by genetic analysis and found higher male embryonic mortality at 35.5 degrees C (44 males vs. 28 females) and a higher proportion of female hatchings at 38 degrees C (24 males vs. 38 females); however, these results were not statistically significant. Our results suggest that Mallard females do not differentiate quantitatively between sexes during egg production. Male hatchlings were significantly larger but not heavier than females.

We evaluated the effect of temperature on the fertilization success, embryonic development and larval survival of T. roseus under laboratory conditions, to understand how the increase in ocean temperature could affect it in a global warming. The highest percentage of fertilization occurred in gametes that were exposed to 30 degrees C, and a significant negative effect of 32 degrees C was evidenced by the lowest percentage. There was also a deleterious effect in embryos exposed to 32 degrees C, resulting in an abnormal development at all the time points. The highest percentage of larval survival occurred at 30 degrees C, while the lowest percentage occurred at 32 degrees C. The results suggest that T. roseus probably lives near its upper thermal limit, and future ocean warming could threaten the permanence of the species in the eastern tropical Pacific, or at least lead to contraction or fragmentation of its range limits.

S. and Nykvist, Asa and Powers, Nicholas and Caldwell, Joanne N.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"To better understand the relationships between changes in body temperature and displacements of the thermoeffector thresholds (critical temperatures), the passive cooling (and heating) of pre-heated (and pre-cooled) individuals was investigated. Such experiments are necessary to understand the inter-dependence of those thresholds, and may possibly yield human evidence for the existence of separate central controllers. Eight males participated in four trials; two when normothermic, one following pre-experimental heating and the fourth following pre-cooling. Subjects were exposed to passive, whole-body cooling and heating when normothermic (the control trials), and again following pre-heating and pre-cooling (respectively). Cutaneous vasomotor, thermogenic, as well as precursor and discharged sudomotor thresholds from different body segments were compared across those dynamic thermal states. Following pre-heating, the critical mean body temperatures for vasoconstriction (0.37 degrees C +/- 0.10) and thermogenesis (0.67 degrees C +/- 0.20) were significantly elevated during passive cooling, relative to the corresponding control trial (both P < 0.05). When passive heating followed pre-cooling, the thresholds for vasodilatation were reduced (0.37 degrees C +/- 0.07; P < 0.05). Conversely, but with the exception of forehead precursor sweating, the sudomotor thresholds were elevated (averaging 0.16 degrees C +/- 0.02; P < 0.05). Most thermoeffectors revealed unique and adjustable activation thresholds, with the threshold displacements for thermogenesis and vasomotion appearing to be linked to the change in mean body temperature. Following pre-cooling, the critical temperatures for vasodilatation and sudomotor activation varied independently, with the exception of forehead precursor sweating. Collectively, those observations are consistent with the presence of independent central controllers for thermally dependent vasomotor and sudomotor responses, and perhaps also for shivering thermogenesis.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.05.001,83,NA,37-46,NA,Shivering; Sudomotor; Thermoeffector thresholds; Thermogenesis; Vasoconstriction; Vasodilatation

This technique has several limitations and alternative techniques are needed. Supraclavicular skin temperature measured with iButtons and infrared thermography (IRT) has been proposed as an indirect marker of BAT activity. We studied the concurrent validity of skin temperature measured with iButtons vs. IRT and the association of supraclavicular skin temperature measured with iButtons and IRT with BAT. We measured skin temperature upon a shivering threshold test with iButtons and IRT in 6 different regions in 12 participants (n = 2 men). On a separate day, we determined supraclavicular skin temperature with an iButton and IRT after 2 h of a personalized cooling protocol. Thereafter, we quantified BAT volume and activity by PET/CT. We observed that the absolute differences between the devices were statistically different from 0 (all P < 0.05) after the shivering threshold test. Moreover, we did not find any association between supraclavicular skin temperature measured with iButtons or IRT and BAT F-18-FDG activity (r = -0.213; P = 0.530 and r = -0.079; P = 0.817).

In light of these results, we concluded that the measurement of skin temperature obtained by iButtons and IRT are not comparable.

We documented the thermal limits of larvae of three amphibian species native to Hong Kong, and their introduced, invasive predator, the mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis). We then used larvae of the brown tree frog Polypedates megacephalus as a model amphibian to further investigate growth, oxygen consumption rate and heat shock protein expression with changes in thermal regime. We found that G. affinis was the most tolerant of low temperatures but also the least tolerant of high temperatures. Despite the higher thermal tolerance of the amphibian larvae, further investigation on P. megacephalus demonstrated that optimal temperatures for physiological performance fall within a range of 18.0-21.6 degrees C, which is far lower than its upper thermal limit, implying that thermal stress occurs during part of the larval stage under natural environmental conditions.

N.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In this paper, we have developed a new mathematical model describing bio-heat transfer during cryosurgery of lung cancer. The lung tissue cooled by a flat probe whose temperature decreases linearly with time. The freezing process occurs in three stages and the whole region is divided into solid, mushy and liquid region. The heat released in the mushy region is considered as discontinuous heat generation. The model is an initial-boundary value problem of the hyperbolic partial differential equation in stage 1 and moving boundary value problem of parabolic partial differential equations in stage 2 and 3.

article,Predicting recovery from exertional heat strain in military working dogs,"O'Brien, Catherine and Berglund, Larry G.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"A two-compartment (core, skin) rational Canine Thermal Model (CTM) of thermal-physiological responses was developed to predict the core temperature (Tc) of a military working dog (MWD) during recovery from exertional heat stress. Heat storage is represented as the balance among heat loss mechanisms, heat gain from the environment, and heat production from metabolism. Inputs to the CTM include environmental conditions (ambient temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation and wind speed), physical characteristics of the dog (weight, length), and metabolic rate. The CTM was validated against Tc of 16 MWDs measured in a previous study, where training was conducted in October (24 degrees C, 52\% RH), March (14 degrees C, 74\% RH), and August (28 degrees C, 64\% RH). Measured and CTM-simulated Tc were compared at 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 min post-exercise. The CTM was considered acceptable if it was within 0.5 degrees C of measured Tc for 80\% of cases. This occurred in 92\% of 37 cases after 30 min recovery, and 86\% of 29 cases after 60 min. The mean difference between CTM-simulated and measured Tc was 0.01 degrees C at 30 min recovery, with 2 of 37 cases falling outside the range of two standard deviations (Bland Altman comparison). After 60 min recovery the difference was 0.05 degrees C, with 4 of 29 cases outside the range of acceptance. The root mean squared deviation between CTM-simulated and measured Tc for all time points was 0.3 degrees C +/- 0.3 degrees C. For comparison, the mean standard deviation of resting Tc was 38.2 degrees C +/- 0.3 degrees C and at peak Tc was 39.4 degrees C +/- 0.7 degrees C. For this population, the CTM is a valid method for simulating recovery from exertional heat stress. It can be used to develop work/rest cycles during activity in hot environments, and to compare rates of recovery across different environmental conditions.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.07.001,76,NA,45-51,NA,NA

The Japanese macaque (Macaca fuscata) is one of only a handful of nonhuman primate species that experience seasonal climates over a wide temperature range. We used behavior observations, accelerometer sensors and the doubly-labelled water (DLW) method to measure activity and total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) of M. fuscata housed in captivity but exposed to natural seasonal variations at day lengths ranging from 10 to 12 h and temperature ranging from 0 to 32 degrees C. Although overall activity was significantly lower in winter compared to summer and autumn, we found no effect of temperature on day-time activity. However nocturnal inactivity and mean length of sleeping bouts significantly increased along a gradient of decreasing temperatures from summer through winter, suggesting the importance of adaptive behavioral thermoregulation in this species. Energy expenditure that was unaccounted for by Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and physical activity i.e. expended through diet induced thermogenesis or thermoregulation was between 14\% and 32\%. This residual energy expenditure differed between summer/autumn and winter and was relatively consistent across individuals (approximately 5-8\% higher in winter). The percentage of body fat and residual energy expenditure were negatively correlated, supporting that fat storage was higher when less energy was required for thermoregulation. Our results suggest that physiological mechanisms like behavioral and autonomic thermoregulation enable M. fuscata to adapt to wide fluctuations in environmental conditions which provide insights into the evolutionary adaptations of nonhuman primates in seasonal climate.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.07.009,76,NA,139-146,NA,Accelerometer; Activity; Doubly-labelled water; Thermal physiology; Thermoregulation
article,Impact of nitrogen additions on soil microbial respiration and temperature sensitivity in native and agricultural ecosystems in the Brazilian Cerrado,"Espindola, Suellen Pereira and Bobul'ska, Lenka and Ferreira, Ada de Siqueira",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Soil microbial respiration (SMR1) is a major flux of CO2 from terrestrial ecosystems into the atmosphere, which depends on several abiotic factors, including soil temperature and nutrient availability. A nutrient of great interest in soil ecology is nitrogen (N) because of its use in agriculture and an expected increase of depositions in soils. Models on the relationship between SMR and temperature may be able to describe the effects of N addition on the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration (Q(10)(2)). Hence, this study aimed to investigate the effects of N addition on SMR and Q(10) values in soils of native Brazilian Cerrado (NC3), and of an agricultural ecosystem (AE(4)) cultivated over the past 17 years. SMR was stimulated by N additions (100 and 200 mg N kg dwt soil(-1)) in samples of Cerrado sites depending on the land use type and temperature assessed. The addition of 200 N kg dwt soil(-1) to NC showed higher SMR values at 25 degrees C compared to soil without N input, whereas the same happened in AE at 30 degrees C. Overall, NC presented higher Q(10) values than AE. N inputs increased Q so in the Cerrado sites. In NC, the highest Q(10) value occurred when 200 mg N kg dwt soil(-1) was added to soil, whereas in AE the greatest value was observed for a lower dose (100 mg N kg dwt soil(-1)). This study shows that N additions to tropical soils alter Q so values depending on dose and land use. These are important findings to compare the fragility of pristine and cultivated Brazilian Cerrado ecosystems in the perspective of climate change.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.06.005,75,NA,120-127,NA,Soil microbial activity; Tropical soil; Nitrogen deposition; van't Hoff model; Arrhenius model; Land use

The temperature of water significantly affects the physiological function and production efficiency of these crabs. The aim of the present study was therefore to examine the critical thermal minimum (CTMin), critical thermal maximum (CTMax), acclimation response ratio (ARR), escaping temperature (Tesc), and locomotor behavior of P. pelagicus instars at 20 degrees C, 24 degrees C, 28 degrees C, 32 degrees C, and 36 degrees C. The CTMax ranged from 39.05 degrees C to 44.38 degrees C, while the CTMin ranged from 13.05 degrees C to 19.30 degrees C, and both increased directly with temperature. The ARR ranged from 0.25 to 0.51. The movement of crabs (walking before molting) correlated positively with the acclimation temperature. These results indicate that the parameters evaluated varied with temperature. Furthermore, the high CTMax indicates the potential of this species to adapt to a wide range of temperatures.

Y. and Chew, Li Lee and Ng, Ching Ching and Goh, Hao Chin and Lehette, Pascal and Chong, Ving Ching",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Heat shock response (HSR), in terms of transcription regulation of two heat shock proteins genes hsp70 and hsp90), was analysed in a widespread tropical copepod Pseudodiaptomus annandalei. The mRNA transcripts of both genes were quantified after copepods at a salinity of 20 underwent an acclimation process involving an initial acclimation temperature of 29 degrees C, followed by gradual thermal ramping to the target exposure temperature range of 24-36 degrees C. The respective cellular HSR and organismal metabolism, measured by respiratory activity at exposure temperatures, were compared. The fold change in mRNA expression for both hsp70 and hsp90 (8-9 fold) peaks at 32 degrees C, which is very close to 32.4 degrees C, the upper thermal optimum for respiration in the species. Unexpectedly, the modelled HSR curves peak at only 3 degrees C (hsp90) and 3.5 degrees C (hsp70) above the mean water temperature (29.32 degrees C) of the copepod in the field. We propose that copepods in tropical waters adopt a preparative HSR strategy, early at the upper limit of its thermal optimum, due to the narrow thermal range of its habitat thus precluding substantial energy demand at higher temperatures. However, the model suggests that the species could survive to at least 36 degrees C with short acclimation time. Nevertheless, the significant overlap between its thermal range of lisp synthesis and the narrow temperature range of its habitat also suggests that any unprecedented rise in sea temperature would have a detrimental effect on the species.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.02.012,74,NA,14-22,NA,Calanoida; Acclimation; hsp genes; Respiration rates; Thermal stress

Our results suggest that the locomotor performance of metamorphs of R. spinulosa is affected by increasing salinity concentrations in the environment where they develop. On the other hand, the thermal extremes of metamorphs of R. spinulosa also showed changes associated with different salinity conditions. According to other studies on different organisms, the increase of the osmolarity of the internal medium may increase the thermal tolerance of this species.

The surrounding fluxes including the ocean flux and the solar irradiance are considered in an energy balance in order to determine the skin temperature of both sides of the wing. Applying the Blasius solution for heated boundary layers, it is shown that the color configuration of these migrating birds, namely black on the top side of the wings and white on the bottom side of the wings ({''}countershading{''}), results in a skin drag reduction, if compared to some other configurations, when both day and night are taken into consideration.

article,An optimal two-bout strategy with phase change material cooling vests to improve comfort in hot environment,"Itani, Mariam and Ghaddar, Nesreen and Ouahrani, Djamel and Ghali, Kamel and Khater, Beatrice",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Cooling vests incorporating phase change material (PCM) packets are used to improve comfort of workers in hot environments. This work aims to investigate by modeling and experimentation the effect of dividing the working duration into two bouts, where different PCM melting temperatures are used in each bout. An integrated bio-heat and fabric-PCM model predictions of physiological and subjective votes are validated via active human subject testing at hot conditions. A parametric study is performed to select, at two conditions (40 degrees C and 45 degrees C), the optimal PCM melting temperatures of the two bouts that would result with similar thermal comfort and sensation to the optimal single-bout case. The optimal case achieves most reductions in energy use for PCM regeneration, PCM carried weight and material cost. The results of the parametric study showed that heat storage is reduced in the second bout due to wearing the second vest with lower PCM melting temperature, thus thermal comfort and sensation are significantly improved. The optimal case at the 40 degrees C environment uses a vest with 21 degrees C PCMs in the first bout and a vest with 21 degrees C PCMs in the second bout (V21 -> V21). At 45 degrees C, the optimal case is V18 -> V10 with significant PCM weight reductions from the reference single bout case by a minimum of 47\%. Thus, the issue of extra carried weight that affect metabolism and ease of movement when applying continuous cooling during work have been mitigated by using the two-bout strategy.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.12.005,72,NA,10-25,NA,Comfort in hot environment; Cooling vest; Phase change material; Physiological data; Thermal comfort and sensation
article,Rhinarium temperature dynamics in domestic dogs,"Kroger, Ronald Heinz Herbert and Goiricelaya, Aitor Bereber",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Many mammals have specialized nose-tips with glabrous and often wet skin, called rhinaria. The function of the rhinarium is unknown in most species. Rhinaria differ not only in shape and skin structure, but also in skin temperature. They are considerably colder in carnivorans than in herbivorous artio- and perissodactyls. Domestic dogs are carnivorans and their noses often feel cold, such that they can be used as an abundant and easily accessible model species. We performed a study on rhinarium temperature in dogs under various ambient temperatures as well as in different behavioral and physiological contexts, breeds, and age groups. The rhinaria of adult, alert, and comfortable dogs are colder than ambient temperature from 30 degrees C (approximately 5 degrees C colder) down to a break point at about 15 degrees C. At an ambient temperature of 0 degrees C, rhinarium temperature is approximately 8 degrees C and the decrease in skin surface temperature with decreasing ambient temperature has not yet leveled off. The dog rhinarium warms up under a number of circumstances. In contrast to the continuously warm rhinaria of herbivores, our results suggest strongly that the cold state is the operating state of the dog rhinarium.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.10.013,70,B,15-19,NA,Dog; Rhinarium; Temperature dynamics; Ambient temperature; Behavioral context; Age

Methods: Twelve healthy inactive subjects (5 females, mean +/- SD): age 28 +/- 6 y, 77.9 +/- 2 kg), completed a 10 day HA (42 degrees C, 28\% RH) hyperthermia clamp (90 min/day exercise, Delta 1.5 degrees C in rectal temperature (T-re)) and control workload matched (CON: 23 degrees C, 42\% RH) protocols in a counterbalanced design separated by at least 2 mo. Pre-and post-HA were matched for external work rate (EXwR; day 1 and day 10 first 30 min at 118 +/- 29 W, last 60 min at 11 +/- 5 W); and metabolic heat production (H-prod; day 1 and day 9, first 30 min at 296 +/- 26 W 2, last 60 min 187 +/- 33 W m-2). Results: When Pre- and post- HA was matched for H-prod, there was no difference during the first 30 or last 60 min of exercise for metabolic energy expenditure (MEE 363 +/- 70/ 195 +/- 32 W m(-2)), H-prod (296 +/- 67/ 187 +/- 33 W m(-2)) or T-re (Delta 2.1 +/- 0.5 degrees C). When pre- and post-HA was EXwR equivalent, HA significantly attenuated MEE during the first 30 and last 60 min (303 +/- 49/174 +/- 35 W H-prod (241 +/- 44/168 +/- 33, Wm(-2)), and Delta T-re (Delta 1.3 +/- 0.4 degrees C) (each P < 0.0001).

Previous studies concerning the correlation of regional physiological characteristics and body composition showed that obese people have higher hand skin temperature compared to the normal weight people. To predict hand skin temperature in a different environment, a two-node hand thermophysiological model was developed and validated with published experimental data. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was performed which showed that the variations in skin blood flow and blood temperature are most influential on hand skin temperature. The hand model was applied to simulate the hand skin temperature of the obese and normal weight subgroup in different ambient conditions. Higher skin blood flow and blood temperature were used in the simulation of obese people. The results showed a good agreement with experimental data from the literature, with the maximum difference of 0.31 degrees C. If the difference between blood flow and blood temperature of obese and normal weight people was not taken into account, the hand skin temperature of obese people was predicted with an average deviation of 1.42 degrees C.

We conducted an experiment to examine how oxygen affects three variables exhibited by ectotherms as they heat gaping threshold, panting threshold, and loss of righting response (the latter indicating the critical thermal maximum) in two lizard species along an elevational (and therefore environmental oxygen partial pressure) gradient. Oxygen partial pressure did not impact these variables in either species. We also exposed lizards at each elevation to severely hypoxic gas to evaluate their responses to hypoxia. Severely low oxygen partial pressure treatments significantly reduced the gaping threshold, panting threshold, and critical thermal maximum. Further, under these extreme hypoxic conditions, these variables were strongly and positively related to partial pressure of oxygen. In an elevation where both species overlapped, the thermal tolerance of the high elevation species was less affected by hypoxia than that of the low elevation species, suggesting the high elevation species may be adapted to lower oxygen partial pressures. In the high elevation species, female lizards had higher thermal tolerance than males.

article,Studying the evolutionary significance of thermal adaptation in ectotherms: The diversification of amphibians' energetics,"Nespolo, Roberto F. and Figueroa, Julio and Solano-Iguaran, Jaiber J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"A fundamental problem in evolutionary biology is the understanding of the factors that promote or constrain adaptive evolution, and assessing the role of natural selection in this process. Here, comparative phylogenetics, that is, using phylogenetic information and traits to infer evolutionary processes has been a major paradigm. In this study, we discuss Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models (OU) in the context of thermal adaptation in ectotherms. We specifically applied this approach to study amphibians's evolution and energy metabolism. It has been hypothesized that amphibians exploit adaptive zones characterized by low energy expenditure, which generate specific predictions in terms of the patterns of diversification in standard metabolic rate (SMR). We complied whole-animal metabolic rates for 122 species of amphibians, and adjusted several models of diversification. According to the adaptive zone hypothesis, we expected: (1) to find ``accelerated evolution{''} in SMR (i.e., diversification above Brownian Motion expectations, BM), (2) that a model assuming evolutionary optima (i.e., an OU model) fits better than a white-noise model and (3) that a model assuming multiple optima (according to the three amphibians's orders) fits better than a model assuming a single optimum. As predicted, we found that the diversification of SMR occurred most of the time, above BM expectations. Also, we found that a model assuming an optimum explained the data in a better way than a white-noise model. However, we did not find evidence that an OU model with multiple optima fits the data better, suggesting a single optimum in SMR for Anura, Caudata and Gymnophiona. These results show how comparative phylogenetics could be applied for testing adaptive hypotheses regarding history and physiological performance in ectotherms.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.11.014,68,A,5-13,NA,Comparative phylogenetics; OU models; Amphibians; Selection; Phylogeny; Metabolic rate

article,Transition duration of ingested deuterium oxide to eccrine sweat during exercise in the heat,"Church, Adam and Lee, Fanny and Buono, Michael J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The time necessary for the initial appearance of ingested water as sweat during exercise in the heat remains unknown. Based on the current literature, we estimated fluid transition through the body, from ingestion to appearance as sweat, to have a minimum time duration of approximately three minutes. The purpose of this study was to test this prediction and identify the time necessary for the initial enrichment of deuterium oxide (D2O) in sweat following ingestion during exercise in the heat. Eight participants performed moderate intensity (40\% of maximal oxygen uptake) treadmill exercise in an environmental chamber (40 degrees C, 40\% rH) to induce active sweating. After fifteen minutes, while continuing to walk, participants consumed D2O (0.15 ml kg(-1)) in a final volume of 50 ml water. Scapular sweat samples were collected one minute prior to and ten minutes post ingestion. Samples were analyzed for sweat D2O concentration using isotope ratio mass spectrometry and compared to baseline. Meant +/- SD Delta sweat D2O concentration at minutes one and two post-ingestion were not significantly higher than baseline (0 min). Minutes three (9 3 ppm) through ten (23 +/- 11 ppm) post-ingestion had Delta sweat D2O concentrations significantly (P < 0.05) higher than baseline. Such results suggest that ingested water rapidly transports across the mucosal membrane of the alimentary canal into the vasculature space, enters the extravascular fluid, and is actively secreted by the eccrine sweat glands onto the surface of the skin for potential evaporation in as little as three minutes during exercise in the heat.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.11.018,63,NA,88-91,NA,Deuterium oxide; Thermoregulation; Sweat; Fluid transition; Eccrine gland

Then, a 2D computer code is developed to predict the temperature of blood (fluid phase) and tissue (solid phase) by conventional volume averaging method and a more realistic solution method. In latter method, despite the volume averaging the blood of interconnect capillaries is separated from the arterial and venous blood phases. It is found that in addition to blood perfusion rate, the arrangement of vascular network has considerable effects on the pattern and amount of the achieved temperature. In contrast to counter-current network, the co-current network of vessels leads to considerable asymmetric pattern of temperature contours and relocation of heat affected zone along the blood flow direction. However this relocation can be prevented by changing the site of hyperthermia heat source. The results show that the cooling effect of co-current blood vessels during of interstitial heating is more efficient. Despite much anatomical dissitnilarities, these findings can be useful in designing Of protocols for hyperthermia cancer treatment of living tissue. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Quality of treatment is highly influenced by the way of temperature control that depends strongly upon the living tissue thermal properties. One-dimensional dual-phase-lag (DPL) in spherical coordinate system numerically has been investigated for bioheat transfer during laser treatment in living biological tissues, which contain tumoral and normal layers. Various behaviors of heat transfer models such as wave, wavelike and diffusion are studied by adjusting the relaxation parameters. Effect of different phase lags values of the heat flux and the temperature gradient and thermal diffusivity on the behavior of heat transfer overshooting phenomenon is also investigated as well. Results indicate variation of the time lag and the thermal diffusivity of the normal and tumoral tissues. Also it has cleared that the geometrical conditions have significant effects upon the thermal response and overshooting phenomenon in biological tissue. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, development time from hatching to pupation and adult eclosion, pupal and adult weights of the rice stem borer, Chilo suppressalis were examined at 22, 25, 28 and 31 degrees C under L18:D 6. Larval and pupal times were significantly decreased with increasing rearing temperature and growth rate was positively correlated with temperature. Larval and pupal developmental times were not significantly different between females and males. The relationship between body weight and rearing temperature in C suppressalis did not follow the temperature-size rule (TSR), both males and females gained the highest body weight at 31 degrees C. Females were significantly larger than males at all temperatures, showing a female biased sex size dimorphism (SSD). Contrary to Rensch's rule, SSD and body weight in C suppressalis tended to increase with rising temperature. Male pupae lost significantly more weight at metamorphosis compared to females. We discuss the adaptive significance of the reverse TSR in the moth's life history. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

I.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Pereskia aculeata and Pereskia grandifolia have been studied widely due to their high nutritional and therapeutic values. However, little is known about the biological requirements of their seeds for the various germination factors. Thus, this experiment aimed to evaluate the thermal effects on the germination of these species at the temperatures of 24 degrees C, 27 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 33 degrees C and 36 degrees C. After verification of the existence of differences in the performance of germination, a non-linear regression was carried out, relating the germination to temperature and identifying its point of maximum efficiency. We found that the lowest synchronization indexes of germination were observed close to 30 degrees C. The best germination response of the P. aculeata and P. grandifolia was observed at 30 degrees C and 33 degrees C, respectively, with greater germination strength and fewer days to attain 63.21\% of germinations.

article,Modeling conductive cooling for thermally stressed dairy cows,"Gebremedhin, Kifle G. and Wu, Binxin and Perano, K.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Conductive cooling, which is based on direct contact between a cow lying down and a cooled surface (water mattress, or any other heat exchanger embedded under the bedding), allows heat transfer from the cow to the cooled surface, and thus alleviate heat stress of the cow. Conductive cooling is a novel technology that has the potential to reduce the consumption of energy and water in cooling dairy cows compared to some current practices. A three-dimensional conduction model that simulates cooling thermally-stressed dairy cows was developed. The model used a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method to characterize the air-flow field surrounding the animal model. The flow field was obtained by solving the continuity and the momentum equations. The heat exchange between the animal and the cooled water mattress as well as between the animal and ambient air was determined by solving the energy equation. The relative humidity was characterized using the species transport equation. The conduction 3-D model was validated against experimental temperature data and the agreement was very good (average error is 4.4\% and the range is 1.9-8.3\%) for a mesh size of 1117202. Sensitivity analyses were conducted between heat losses (sensible and latent) with respect to air temperature, relative humidity, air velocity, and level of wetness of skin surface to determine which of the parameters affect heat flux more than others. Heat flux was more sensitive to air temperature and level of wetness of the skin surface and less sensitive to relative humidity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, although it is well appreciated that standard air temperature records often fail to describe accurately conditions experienced at microhabitat level, few studies have explicitly set out to link field conditions experienced by natural multispecies communities with the more detailed laboratory ecophysiological studies of a small number of `representative' species. This is particularly the case during winter, when snow cover may insulate terrestrial habitats from extreme air temperature fluctuations. Further, climate projections suggest large changes in precipitation will occur in the polar regions, with the greatest changes expected during the winter period and, hence, implications for the insulation of overwintering microhabitats. To assess survival of natural High Arctic soil invertebrate communities contained in soil and vegetation cores to natural winter temperature variations, the overwintering temperatures they experienced were manipulated by deploying cores in locations with varying snow accumulation: No Snow, Shallow Snow (30 cm) and Deep Snow (120 cm). Air temperatures during the winter period fluctuated frequently between +3 and -24 degrees C, and the No Snow soil temperatures reflected this variation closely, with the extreme minimum being slightly lower. Under 30 cm of snow, soil temperatures varied less and did not decrease below -12 degrees C. Those under deep snow were even more stable and did not decline below -2 degrees C. Despite these striking differences in winter thermal regimes, there were no clear differences in survival of the invertebrate fauna between treatments, including oribatid, prostigmatid and mesostigmatid mites, Araneae, Collembola, Nematocera larvae or Coleoptera. This indicates widespread tolerance, previously undocumented for the Araneae, Nematocera or Coleoptera, of both direct exposure to at least -24 degrees C and the rapid and large temperature fluctuations. These results suggest that the studied polar soil invertebrate community may be robust to at least one important predicted consequence of projected climate change. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Estimation of the core temperature control during ambient temperature changes and the influence of circadian rhythm and metabolic conditions in mice,"Tokizawa, Ken and Yoda, Tamae and Uchida, Yuki and Kanosue, Kazuyuki and Nagashima, Kei",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"It has been speculated that the control of core temperature is modulated by physiological demands. We could not prove the modulation because we did not have a good method to evaluate the control. In the present study, the control of core temperature in mice was assessed by exposing them to various ambient temperatures (T-a), and the influence of circadian rhythm and feeding condition was evaluated. Male ICR mice (n=20) were placed in a box where T-a was increased or decreased from 27 degrees C to 40 degrees C or to -4 degrees C (0.15 degrees C/min) at 0800 and 2000 (daytime and nighttime, respectively). Intra-abdominal temperature (T-core) was monitored by telemetry. The relationship between T-core and T-a was assessed. The range of T-a where T-core was relatively stable (range of normothermia, RNT) and T-core corresponding to the RNT median (regulated T-core) were estimated by model analysis. In fed mice, the regression slope within the RNT was smaller in the nighttime than in the daytime (0.02 and 0.06, respectively), and the regulated T-core was higher in the nighttime than in the daytime (37.5 degrees C and 36.0 degrees C, respectively). In the fasted mice, the slope remained unchanged, and the regulated T-core decreased in the nighttime (0.05 and 35.9 degrees C, respectively), while the slopes in the daytime became greater (0.13). Without the estimating individual thermoregulatory response such as metabolic heat production and skin vasodilation, the analysis of the T-a-T-core relationship could describe the character of the core temperature control. The present results show that the character of the system changes depending on time of day and feeding conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Not all space is created equal: Distribution of free space and its influence on heat-stress and the limpet <i>Patelloida latistrigata</i>,"Lathlean, Justin A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"For most marine benthic communities unoccupied primary substrata, or free space, is considered the principle limiting resource. Substratum temperatures, desiccation rates and hydrodynamic characteristics of free space, however, may vary depending on patch size and isolation and therefore potentially influence biotic processes. This paper investigates the relationship between small-scale changes in the availability and configuration of free space, heat stress and abundance of the small rocky intertidal gastropod Patelloida latistrigata within southeastern Australia. Using infrared thermography I show that heat stress of rocky intertidal communities increased linearly with increasing amounts of free space on three neighbouring shores during four separate sampling intervals from October 2009 to January 2010. Abundances of P. latistrigata generally declined with increasing availability of free space and the associated increases in heat stress. An experimental manipulation that altered the configuration but not the availability of free space demonstrated that both heat stress and P. latistrigata abundance are not affected by small-scale changes in the configuration of free space. The small-scale distribution of P. latistrigara, however, was significantly influenced by differences in the configuration of free space with limpets displaying bimodal distributions within areas characterised by unevenly distributed free space. Since the distribution of Patelloida varies depending on the configuration of free space but thermal properties at the scale of individual limpets do not then we might expect Patelloida to be responding to changes in other abiotic factors, such as hydrodynamic forces and desiccation rates, which may change with the configuration of free space. This study highlights the dynamic and usually unexamined relationship between abiotic stress and the availability and acquisition of resources by marine benthic invertebrates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Incubation temperature fluctuation does not affect incubation length and hatchling phenotype in the Chinese skink <i>Plestiodon chinensis</i>,"Qu, Yan-Fu and Lu, Hong-Liang and Li, Hong and Ji, Xiang",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Studies examining the effects of incubation temperature fluctuation on the phenotype of hatchling reptiles have shown species variation. To examine whether incubation temperature fluctuation has a key role in influencing the phenotype of hatchling Chinese skinks (Plestiodon chinensis), we incubated.eggs produced by 20 females under five thermal regimes (treatments). Eggs in three treatments were incubated in three incubators, one set constant at 27 degrees C and two ramp-programmed at 27 +/- 3 degrees C and 27 +/- 5 degrees C on a cycle of 12 h (+) and 12 h (-). The remaining eggs were incubated in two chambers: one inside a room where temperatures varied from 23.0 to 31.1 degrees C, with a mean of 27.0 degrees C; the other outside the room where temperatures varied from 20.2 to 35.3 degrees C, with a mean of 26.1 degrees C. We found that: (1) for eggs at a given embryonic stage at ovipositon, the mean rather than the variance of incubation temperatures determined the length of incubation; (2) most (egg mass, embryonic stage at oviposition, incubation length and all examined hatchling traits except tail length and locomotor performance) of the examined variables were affected by clutch; and (3) body mass was the only hatchling trait that differed among the five treatments, but the differences were tiny. These findings suggest that incubation temperature fluctuation has no direct role in influencing incubation length and hatchling phenotype in P. chinensis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Using pairs of physiological models to estimate temporal variation in amphibian body temperature,"Roznik, Elizabeth A. and Alford, Ross A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Physical models are often used to estimate ectotherm body temperatures, but designing accurate models for amphibians is difficult because they can vary in cutaneous resistance to evaporative water loss. To account for this variability, a recently published technique requires a pair of agar models that mimic amphibians with 0\% and 100\% resistance to evaporative water loss; the temperatures of these models define the lower and upper boundaries of possible amphibian body temperatures for the location in which they are placed. The goal of our study was to develop a method for using these pairs of models to estimate parameters describing the distributions of body temperatures of frogs under field conditions. We radiotracked green-eyed treefrogs (Litoria serrata) and collected semi-continuous thermal data using both temperature-sensitive radiotransmitters with an automated datalogging receiver, and pairs of agar models placed in frog locations, and we collected discrete thermal data using a non-contact infrared thermometer when frogs were located. We first examined the accuracy of temperature-sensitive transmitters in estimating frog body temperatures by comparing transmitter data with direct temperature measurements taken simultaneously for the same individuals. We then compared parameters (mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation) characterizing the distributions of temperatures of individual frogs estimated from data collected using each of the three methods. We found strong relationships between thermal parameters estimated from data collected using automated radiotelemetry and both types of thermal models. These relationships were stronger for data collected using automated radiotelemetry and impermeable thermal models, suggesting that in the field, L serrata has a relatively high resistance to evaporative water loss. Our results demonstrate that placing pairs of thermal models in frog locations can provide accurate estimates of the distributions of temperatures experienced by individual frogs, and that comparing temperatures from model pairs to direct measurements collected simultaneously on frogs can be used to broadly characterize the skin resistance of a species, and to select which model type is most appropriate for estimating temperature distributions for that species.

The possible influences of heavy metal exposure and the potential harm to organisms when combined with other environmental stressors such as temperature have been largely unexplored. An aquatic toxicity test of Caenorhabditis elegans was performed to estimate the 24 h median lethal concentration (LC50) of different zinc concentrations at different temperatures (15 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 30 degrees C). We also examined the time course thermotolerance on wild type (N2) and daf-21 null (JT6130) adults exposed to 6.1 mM zinc at 37 degrees C. Hsp90 protein expression level in response to the combined effect of temperature and zinc toxicity was also investigated by both Western blots and ELISA. Our results show that C. elegans wild type nematodes exhibit severe lethal toxicity after a 24 h exposure to zinc at higher temperatures. In addition, the expression level of Hsp90 was highly inhibited in adult worms subjected to zinc stress. This toxicity assay at different temperatures provides insight into organism response to combined effects of temperature and zinc toxicity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Shivering modulation in humans: Effects of rapid changes in environmental temperature,"Imbeault, Marie-Andree and Mantha, Olivier L. and Haman, Francois",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"During cold exposure, increase in heat production is produced via the activation of shivering thermogenesis and nonshivering thermogenesis, the former being the main contributor to compensatory heat production in non-acclimatized humans. In rats, it has been demonstrated that shivering thermogenesis is modulated solely by skin thermoreceptors but this modulation has yet to be investigated in humans. The aim of this study was to determine if cold-induced shivering in humans can be modulated by cutaneous thermoreceptors in conditions where increases in heat loss can be adequately compensated by increases in thermogenic rate. Using a liquid-conditioned suit, six non-acclimatized men were exposed to cold (6 degrees C) for four 30 min periods, each of them separated by 15 min of heat exposure (33 degrees C). Core temperature remained stable throughout exposures whereas skin temperatures significantly decreased by 12\% in average during the sequential cold/heat exposures compared to baseline (p < 0.0001). Shivering intensity and metabolic rate increased significantly during 6 degrees C exposures (3.3 +/- 0.7\% MVC, 0.40 +/- 0.0 L O-2/min, respectively) and were significantly reduced during 33 degrees C exposure (0.5 +/- 0.1\% MVC, 0.25 +/- 0.0 L O-2/min; p < 0.005 for both). Most importantly, shivering could be quickly and strongly inhibited during 33 degrees C exposure although skin temperature often remained below baseline values. In conclusion, under compensatory conditions, cutaneous thermoreceptors appear to be a major modulator of the shivering response in humans and seem to react rapidly to changes in the microclimate right next to the skin and to skin temperature.

article,Energy use and management of energy reserves in hatchling turtles (<i>Chrysemys picta</i>) exposed to variable winter conditions,"Muir, Timothy J. and Dishong, Brian D. and Lee, Jr., Richard E. and Costanzo, Jon R.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The painted turtle (Chrysemys picta) is an especially useful organism in the study of metabolic regulation during dormancy because it is sustained by finite energy reserves from hatching until emerging from its nest, about nine months later. In this study we subjected overwintering C. picta hatchlings to 4, 10, or 15 degrees C, temperatures simulating cold, mild, and warm winters, respectively, to investigate how various energy reserves are impacted by differential metabolic demands. An energy budget based on seasonal changes in caloric content showed that these turtles consumed an average of 0.39, 0.75, or 1.21 kJ g(-1), respectively, during the 6-month period of simulated hibernation. These estimates of energy use agreed reasonably well with estimates based solely on respirometric data. Unexpectedly, turtles in autumn contained little residual yolk, none of which was consumed by turtles in the cold- and mild-winter groups, this finding contradicting the widely held belief that residual yolk plays an important, direct role in the survival of turtles that overwinter inside their natal nest. By contrast, a marked reduction in dry mass of both liver and carcass attested to their importance in fueling metabolism and, indeed, catabolism of substrates from these components accounted for 31-52 and 35-63\%, respectively, of the energetic cost of overwintering. The greater dependence on carcass reserves and relatively poor physiological condition of turtles in the mild- and warm-winter groups implies that metabolic demands imposed by high environmental temperatures would likely constrain post-emergence fitness.

Twelve healthy young male participants underwent four 90-min trials comprising 70 min walking and 20 min resting periods. Cooling strategies adopted in this work were CON (control), PCM-control (PCMs were removed at the end of exercise), Fan-control (fans were switched OFF during the initial 20 min) and PCM\&Fan-control (fans were turned ON after 20 min exercising and PCMs were removed after the 70-min exercise). Results demonstrated that the control of electric fans could suppress the mean skin temperature rise to 34.0 degrees C by over 15 min and also cut down the energy consumption of the HPCS from 15.6 W h to 12.1 W h over the entire 90-min trials. Thus, it is recommended that fans should be turned off at the beginning of hot exposure and switched on once participants felt warm. Our findings also showed that the removal of fully melted PCM packs from the HPCS could enhance the evaporative cooling effect brought about by air circulation. The removal of melted PCMs significantly reduced the physical load by 37.3\% and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were decreased by 3.5-4.2 RPE units. This could also help quickly restore the PCM energy for future usage.

To minimize these losses, eggs are heated before incubation to stimulate the embryo, thereby reducing the range of birth intervals. The objective of this study was to determine whether heat treatment (37.5 degrees C) prior to incubation would improve hatching rates. We also determined the heat-exposure time necessary to improve productivity. We stored 5376 Nicholas pedigree eggs, aged between 40 and 51 weeks, for seven days. These eggs were distributed in three groups: groups 1 and 2 received 4 and 6 h of heat treatment, respectively; group 3 was used as control (no heat treatment, remaining at 17 degrees C). After heat treatment, the eggs were stored for 7 days at 17 degrees C, together with eggs from the control group.

Hatch rate, yolk retention and the relationship between average chick weight/average egg weight did not differ between treatments.

The experiments on the NV and AC groups were conducted between December 1-13 and December 15-25, respectively. Each group consisted of 20 subjects wearing winter clothes (1.15 +/- 0.05 clo). The thermal sensation votes (TSVs) and thermal comfort votes (TCVs) in both groups were investigated and the subjects' skin temperatures were monitored during the experiments. The results showed that the mean TCV and TSV of both groups were not significantly different in the early winter. However, differences were observed in the subjects' localized body parts. The skin temperatures of the chest and arms of subjects in the NV group were higher than those in the AC group after exposure for 60 min at 16 degrees C, while calves skin temperatures of subjects in the NV group were lower. In addition, subjects in the AC group were found to feel colder compared to those in the NV group in cold environments at the same skin temperature. Thus, this study provides information about thermal comfort based on thermal experience in early winter.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102448,86,NA,NA,102448,Thermal experience; Thermal sensation; Localized skin temperature; Natural ventilation

The gastrointestinal tract is predominantly responsive to heat stress and compromised intestinal functions can contribute to multi-organ injury under heat environment. Resveratrol (RSV) has significant antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential effects of RSV on intestinal function (digestion and barrier), oxidative stress and inflammation in heat-stressed rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were orally fed with 100 mg RSV/kg body weight/day prior to daily heat stress (40 degrees C per day for 1.5 h) exposure for 3 consecutive days. The results showed that RSV reversed the increased serum cortisol level and diamine oxidase activity, the altered jejuna] morphology, the decreased jejunal disaccharidase activities, the elevated malondialdehyde and tumor necrosis factor alpha concentrations and antioxidant enzymes activities in the jejunum, as well as the increased jejunal mRNA expression of toll-like receptor 4, cytokines, antioxidant enzymes and tight junction proteins in heat-stressed rats, to various degrees.

(Heteroptera, Pyrrhocoridae) form conspicuous aggregations at warm spots in early spring. Using a combination of laboratory experiments and field observations, we assessed the influence of this behaviour on the seasonal timing of reproduction. In the laboratory, post-diapause pairs mated after an accumulation of 80 degrees days (dd), and females started to lay eggs after an additional 80 dd (considering 10.3 degrees C as a lower temperature threshold for post-diapause development). In the field, however, females mated as early as late March (based on data from four seasons), which corresponded to the accumulation of < 15 dd (based on summing the temperatures recorded at a meteorology station). Such a `discrepancy' between laboratory and field data is explained by thermoregulation. Aggregated adults bask in sunny spots, thereby increasing their body temperatures to similar to 25 degrees C, which is 7-16 degrees C above the temperature of the surrounding ground. This thermal excess speeds up their post-diapause development and enables early mating and oviposition. As a result, behavioural thermoregulation hastens the seasonal start of reproduction in P. apterus by > 1 month.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.013,84,NA,185-189,NA,Pyrrhocoris apterus; Heteroptera; Pyrrhocoridae; Mating; Copulation activity; Thermoregulation; Temperature
article,Mitochondrial OXPHOS is involved in the protective effects of L-arginine against heat-induced low sperm motility of boar,"Li, Yansen and Chen, Jiaqin and Li, Zhaojian and Li, Chunmei",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The present study aimed to analyze the time- and temperature-responses of boar sperm and clarify the mechanism underlying the protective effects of L-arginine on heat-induced low sperm motility. Mature boar sperm was used to evaluate the effects of temperature, exposure time, L-arginine level and their interactions on sperm motility, respectively. Results showed increasing exposure time resulted in the decreased total motility and rate of rapid progressive sperm, and the increased rates of the immotile sperm and the sperm shaking in place at 38 and 39 degrees C, respectively (P < 0.05). L-arginine supplementation at the dose of 1.0 mM increased total motility and decreased rate of immotile sperm (P < 0.05). Heat at 39 degrees C decreased total motile and rate of rapid progressive sperm (P < 0.05), increased the level of sperm reactive oxygen species (ROS) (P < 0.05), reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi m), ATP content and the activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes (MRCC) III and V (P < 0.05), which were attenuated by L-arginine supplementation. There were significant increases in the relative mRNA expression of nuclear respiratory factor 1 and peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha in heat-exposed group without L-arginine supplementation. In conclusion, the rising temperatures impacted boar sperm motility in a time-dependent manner. In vitro addition of L-arginine to boar semen had a dose-dependent effect on sperm motility and sperm incubated with 1.0 mM L-arginine showed elevated motility. L-arginine supplementation can ameliorate heat-induced increase in ROS level and decreases in MRCC activities, which further maintain mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation function, ATP synthesis and boar sperm motility.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.008,84,NA,236-244,NA,Boar; Computer-assisted sperm analysis; Mitochondrial DNA; Mitochondrial respiratory chain complex; ROS; Hot

Discovering an effective antioxidant is pivotal for overcoming HS-induced injury. Therefore, the aim of this study was to estimate the hepatic protective effects of orally supplemented resveratrol (RES) against HS-mediated liver injury in young and old male Wistar albino rats. Compared to control rats, RES administered orally at a dose of 20 mg/kg BW for 21 successive days efficiently ameliorated HS-induced oxidative damage by significantly increasing (P <= 0.05) the level of reduced glutathione and glutathione peroxidase, and decreasing the levels of malondialdehyde and TNF-alpha in hepatic tissue of both young and aged rats. However, level of NF-kappa B was down regulated significantly in aged rats rather than young rats. Moreover, RES significantly decreased (P <= 0.05) the serum levels of aspartate transaminase and alkaline phosphatase in both ages of rats compared to their corresponding HS-stressed rats. Furthermore, RES upregulated the immunohistochemical expression of caspase 3 and heat shock protein 70 in young and aged rats, however it was more pronounced in young one. In addition, RES administration moderately normalized (P <= 0.0001) the harmful effects of HS on the hepatic architecture of both young and aged rats. In conclusion, this study reveals for the first time that RES exerts promising hepatoameliorative effects against HS-induced oxidative stress in the young and aged rats via its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effect, as well as via its inhibitory effect against the NE-kappa B signalling in a cellular system.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.04.012,83,NA,8-21,NA,Resveratrol; NF-kB; HSP70; Ageing; Heat stress

article,Discovering divergence in the thermal physiology of intertidal crabs along latitudinal gradients using an integrated approach with machine learning,"Osores, Sebastian J. A. and Ruz, Gonzalo A. and Opitz, Tania and Lardies, Marco A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In intertidal marine crustaceans, phenotypic variation in physiological and life-history traits is pervasive along latitudinal dines. However, organisms have complex phenotypes, and their traits do not vary independently but rather interact differentially between them, effect that is caused by genetic and/or environmental forces. We evaluated the geographic variation in phenotypic integration of three marine crab species that inhabit different vertical thermal microhabitats of the intertidal zone. We studied seven populations of each species along a latitudinal gradient that spans more than 3000 km of the Chilean coast. Specifically we measured nine physiological traits that are highly related to thermal physiology. Of the nine traits, we selected four that contributed significantly to the observed geographical variation among populations; this variation was then evaluated using mixed linear models and an integrative approach employing machine learning. The results indicate that patterns of physiological variation depend on species vertical microhabitat, which may be subject to chronic or acute environmental variation. The species that inhabit the high- intertidal sites (i.e., exposed to chronic variation) better tolerated thermal stress compared with populations that inhabit the lower intertidal. While those in the low-intertidal only face conditions of acute thermal variation, using to a greater extent the plasticity to face these events. Our main results reflect that (1) species that inhabit the high-intertidal maintain a greater integration between their physiological traits and present lower plasticity than those that inhabit the low-intertidal.

Larvae and juveniles were reared at temperatures of 23, 26, 29 and 32 degrees C for 15 and 35 days, respectively. The larvae were fed Anemia nauplii, while the juveniles received a formulated diet. In both stages, high temperatures resulted in increased fiber diameter of white muscle. Moreover, a pronounced effect of hypertrophy was observed in later stages of development. No alterations to minimum fiber diameter, and similar mosaic standards of muscle growth dynamics, were observed in larvae kept at 23-32 degrees C, suggesting that hyperplasia was not effected during early stages of development. Gills were analyzed by Degree of Tissue Change (DTC), which is based on the severity of lesions. Significant morphological changes were observed in gills when juveniles were kept at 32 degrees C, which was considered moderate tissue damage. Temperature modulates cellularity in L. alexandri larvae and juveniles, with pronounced alterations of hypertrophy of white muscle fibers in later stages of development when exposed to elevated temperatures. Higher temperatures may also induce muscle growth dynamics with increased recruitment of new white fiber, increased fiber diameter in the early stages and induced gill lesions.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.07.007,76,NA,80-88,NA,Environment; Histopathology; Hyperplasia; Hypertrophy; Muscle fiber

Among other adaptive traits, D. suzukii owes its success to the derived morphological features of its ovipositor, which allows the insect to exploit the exclusive ecological niche of fresh fruit, thus avoiding competition with other closely related species. With the aim of investigating temperature-induced phenotypic plasticity of D. suzukii ovipositor, we reared this insect in four different laboratory conditions, represented by the combination of two developmental temperatures and two diet regimes for the larvae. We recorded the effects of these two factors on ovipositor size and shape and overall body size through a combination of distance-based and geometric morphometric analyses. Results showed that insects attain the largest body sizes at lower temperature, whereas the diet does not determine significant difference in size. However, the effect on size of the two factors is less pronounced in the ovipositor, which shows a negative allometry with respect to body size in all treatments. At higher temperature, ovipositor shape tends also to co-vary with its own size. Neither temperature nor diet have significant effect on ovipositor bilateral fluctuating asymmetry. These results confirm the hypothesis that in D. suzukii the toughened valve of the ovipositor are subjected to effective morpho-functional constraints, while probably being under strong selection by reason of their mechanical role.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.05.001,75,NA,62-68,NA,Evolutionary novelty; Allometry; Developmental stability; Fluctuating asymmetry; Geometric morphometrics; Temperature-Size Rule

Dale and Geiger, Madeleine and Ferrari, Manuela and Blanckenhorn, Wolf U.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Climatic conditions can be very heterogeneous even over small geographic scales, and are believed to be major determinants of the abundance and distribution of species and populations. Organisms are expected to evolve in response to the frequency and magnitude of local thermal extremes, resulting in local adaptation. Using replicate yellow dung fly (Scathophaga stercoraria; Diptera: Scathophagidae) populations from cold (northern Europe) and warm climates (southern Europe), we compared 1) responses to short-term heat and cold shocks in both sexes, 2) heat shock protein (Hsp70) expression in adults and eggs, and 3) female reproductive traits when facing short-term heat stress during egg maturation. Contrary to expectations, thermal traits showed minor geographic differentiation, with weak evidence for greater heat resistance of southern flies but no differentiation in cold resistance. Hsp70 protein expression was little affected by heat stress, indicating systemic rather than induced regulation of the heat stress response, possibly related to this fly group's preference for cold climes. In contrast, sex differences were pronounced: males (which are larger) endured hot temperatures longer, while females featured higher Hsp70 expression. Heat stress negatively affected various female reproductive traits, reducing first clutch size, overall reproductive investment, egg lipid content, and subsequent larval hatching. These responses varied little across latitude but somewhat among populations in terms of egg size, protein content, and larval hatching success. Several reproductive parameters, but not Hsp70 expression, exhibited heritable variation among full-sib families. Rather than large-scale clinal geographic variation, our study suggests some local geographic population differentiation in the ability of yellow dung flies to buffer the impact of heat stress on reproductive performance.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.01.002,73,NA,41-49,NA,Cold shock; Egg size; Egg content; Fecundity; Heat shock protein; Latitude; Reproductive investment; Survival

M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"A novel hybrid cooling vest (HCV) incorporated with phase change materials (PCMs) and ventilation fans has been developed for construction workers in Hong Kong to attenuate heat stress and prevent heat-related illnesses, and its effectiveness and practicality have been validated in this study. A total of 140 wear trials involving of 140 workers were conducted in Hong Kong construction sites during the summer time. Each wear trial involves a two-day wear test, of which one day workers wore the HCV (denoted as VEST) during resting, and another day they wore traditional workwear (denoted as CON). Subjects were asked to rate their perceived exertion (RPE), thermal sensations (TS) and 7 other subjective attributes. There were significant differences in the effectiveness on reducing workers' heat strain between VEST and CON in terms of alleviations of heart rate (Delta HR), Delta TS, Delta RPE as well as Delta PeSI (p < 0.001). The practicality of HCV is evidenced by a significant improvement by 0.93-1.34 on the rating scores of perceived cooling effect, sensations of comfort and skin dryness during rest and fatigue recovery in VEST at the level of 0.05, and high ratings of 4.85-5 (rating scale from 1 to 7, and the higher the better) by subjects on the preference, fitness as well as effectiveness to combat heat stress. In addition, a remarkable proportion of 91 per cent of subjects prefer to use this newly designed HCV as a cooling measure during rest. The power to alleviate perceptual heat stain (PeSA) in VEST is about twice of that by rest, which means HCV can notably improve the workers' perceptual heat strain in a limited resting duration. However, the strain alleviation power of HCV nearly remains unchanged with the prolonged rest duration.

article,Sensitivity to cutaneous warm stimuli varies greatly in the human head,"Kim, Yung-Bin and Jung, Dahee and Park, Joonhee and Lee, Joo-Young",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The head has been known as the most sensitive area to temperature changes but the values are limited to the face. The purposd of this study was to examine cutaneous warm thresholds on the scalp and face of young males. Eight males participated in this study (24 3 yrs in age, 178.2 +/- 5.3 cm in height, and 90.0 +/- 15.4 kg in body mass). All measurements were conducted in an environmental chamber (27 +/- 1 degrees C air temperature and 53 1\% relative humidity). Cutaneous warm thresholds were measured on nine areas of the following regions: the frontal (two points on the right), parietal (a point on the right and the vertex, respectively), temporal (two points on the right), and occipital region (on the right) along with the forehead using a thermal stimulator (rate of temperature increase 0.1 degrees C s(-1)). Skin temperatures on the nine head regions were monitored during the threshold test. The results showed that 1) no significant differences were found in initial skin temperatures among the nine head regions; 2) cutaneous warm detecting temperatures were significantly greater on the vertex (38.2 +/- 3.5 degrees C) than on the forehead (34.8 +/- 1.4 degrees C) and the other seven scalp regions (P < 0.05); 3) subjects detected the increase of 1.2 +/- 1.0 degrees C on the forehead and 1.5 +/- 1.2 degrees C on the occipital region as the first warmth while the vertex was the most insensitive to the increase of temperature (4.0 +/- 3.2 degrees C) (P < 0.05). In summary, the scalp region of young males was less sensitive to the temperature change when compared to the forehead, and the vertex was the most insensitive among the eight scalp regions to the temperature increase.

article,Cold adaptive thermogenesis following consumption of certain pungent spice principles: A validation study,"Pandit, Chaitanya and Anilakumar, K. R.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Identifying a means to activate or potentiate thermogenic mechanisms through ingestion of dietary compounds have important implications in cold endurance and survival. Although many reports discuss the thermogenic potential of spices, it is surprising that none of the studies verify whether consumption of spices can improve cold endurance. In this study, we have attempted to evaluate if ingestion of certain spices can activate heat generating mechanisms in the body such that a fall in. core body temperature (CBT) can be delayed or prevented when faced with a cold challenge. Ten commonly used spices in the Indian cuisine were chosen and 70\% ethanol extract of the spices were fed orally to male Wistar rats at a dose of 250 mg/kg for a period of 7 days. A change in CBT during cold exposure was recorded before and after treatment. At the end of the experiment, plasma norepinephrine and serum free fatty acid levels were estimated. We observed that among the ten spices, treatment with cinnamon and pepper extracts showed significant improvement in comparison to the control group. Based on evidence in literature and the HPLC-MS analysis from our lab, we hypothesized that the effects of the pepper and cinnamon extracts might be due to their piperine and cinnamaldehyde content respectively. However, no improved endurance was observed when they were administered alone. Poor endurance following depletion of endogenous norepinephrine levels using reserpine indicated its involvement in mediating the heat generating processes. However, it is noteworthy that green tea and spice treated animals exhibited a fall in CBT which was lower than their initial fall. In conclusion, our findings provide experimental evidence that ingestion of spices, viz., pepper and cinnamon, might elicit thermogenic responses such that hypothermia can be delayed or prevented upon cold exposure.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.12.008,64,NA,35-40,NA,Hypothermia; Core body temperature; Thermogenesis Spices
article,A parametric study of thermal therapy of skin tissue,"Nobrega, Simao and Coelho, Pedro J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"A thermal therapy for cancer in skin tissue is numerically investigated using three bioheat conduction models, namely Pennes, thermal wave and dual-phase lag models. A laser is applied at the surface of the skin for cancer ablation, and the temperature and thermal damage distributions are predicted using the three bioheat models and two different modeling approaches of the laser effect. The first one is a prescribed surface heat flux, in which the tissue is assumed to be highly absorbent, while the second approach is a volumetric heat source, which is reasonable if the scattering and absorption skin effects are of similar magnitude. The finite volume method is applied to solve the governing bioheat equation. A parametric study is carried out to ascertain the effects of the thermophysical properties of the cancer on the thermal damage. The temperature distributions predicted by the three models exhibit significant differences, even though the temperature distributions are similar when the laser is turned off. The type of bioheat model has more influence on the predicted thermal damage than the type of modeling approach used for the laser. The phase lags of heat flux and temperature gradient have an important influence on the results, as well as the thermal conductivity of the cancer.

Using pharmacological analysis we showed the existence of two opposite responses of nematodes cholinergic system to moderate and extreme heat stress. Short-term (15 min) noxious heat (31-32 degrees C) caused activation of cholinergic synaptic transmission in C. elegans and C. briggsae organisms by sensitization of nicotinic ACh receptors. In contrast, hyperthermia blocked cholinergic synaptic transmission by inhibition of ACh secretion by neurons. The resistance of behavior to extreme high temperature (36-37 degrees C) was significantly higher in C. briggsae than in C. elegans, and thermostability of cholinergic transmission correlated with resistance of behavior to hyperthermia. Activation of cholinergic transmission by moderate heat stress can be the reason of movement speed increase in such adaptive behavior as noxious heat escape. Inhibition of ACh release is one of reasons for behavior failure caused by extreme high temperature since partial inhibition of ACh-esterase by aldicarb protected C. elegans and C. briggsae behavior against hyperthermia. Antagonist of mAChRs atropine almost completely prevented the rise in behavior thermotolerance caused by aldicarb. Pilocarpine, agonist of mAChRs, protected nematodes behavior against hyperthermia similarly with aldicarb. Therefore it is evident that it is the deficiency of mAChRs activity that is the reason for nematodes' behavior failure by hyperthermia.",2016,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.05.007,62,A,37-49,NA,Cholinergic system; Nicotinic ACh receptors; Muscarinic ACh receptors; Noxious heat; Hyperthermia; Nematodes

In this paper, we report nychthemeral and seasonal variations in ambient and body temperatures, and in some haematochemical parameters (glycemia, cholesterolemia, triglyceridemia, creatininemia and uremia) measured during summer, winter and spring, in seven (7) experimental cyclic female Bedouin goats (Capra hircus) living in the Beni-Abbes region (Algerian Sahara desert). Cosinor rhythmometry procedure was used to determine the rhythmic parameters of ambient temperature and haematochemical parameters. To determine the effect of time of day on the rhythmicity of the studied parameters, as well as their seasonality, repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied. The results showed that in spite of the nychthemeral profile presented by the ambient temperature for each season, the body temperature remained in a narrow range, thus indicating a successful thermoregulation. The rhythmometry analysis showed a circadian rhythmicity of ambient temperature and haematochemical parameters with diurnal acrophases. A statistically significant effect of the time of day was shown on all studied haematochemical parameters, except on creatininemia. It was also found that only uremia, cholesterolemia and triglyceridemia followed the seasonal sexual activity of the studied ruminant.

Thirteen active males performed randomly two sessions of squat exercise (normal speed, 1 s eccentric/1 s concentric phase, 1 s; slow speed; 5 s eccentric/5 s concentric phase, 5 s), using similar to 50\% of 1 maximal repetition. Thermal images of ST above muscles quadriceps were recorded at a rate of 0.05 Hz before the exercise (to determine basal ST) and for 480 s following the initiation of the exercise (to determine the nonsteady-state time course of ST). Results showed that ST changed more slowly during the 5 s exercise (p = 0.002), whereas the delta (with respect to basal) excursions were similar for the two exercises (p > 0.05). In summary, our data provided a detailed nonsteady-state portrait of ST changes following squat exercises executed at two different speeds.

People here typically spend most of their time in one of two spaces for eating, resting, and entertaining. It was found that the preferred temperature was 26.5 degrees C. The preferred air velocity occurred at 0.62 m/s. A suitable air velocity range of 0.15-1.24 m/s was suggested in Turfan. Moreover, the neutral temperature of the local people was 30.1 degrees C (t(g) or t(o)). The upper limits of the 80\% acceptable zone by using the direct and indirect acceptability method were 32.7 and 33.8 degrees C, respectively. The neutral temperature and upper limit of the acceptable zone in Turfan were higher than those of the adaptive standards. Attention should be paid to the role of thermal comfort in influencing building design by using simple passive cooling strategies. The above results are believed to be potentially valuable for the design and evaluation of residential buildings located in hot-arid climate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

article,The Temperature-Size Rule in <i>Lecane inermis</i> (Rotifera) is adaptive and driven by nuclei size adjustment to temperature and oxygen combinations,"Walczynska, Aleksandra and Labecka, Anna Maria and Sobczyk, Mateusz and Czarnoleski, Marcin and Kozlowski, Jan",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The evolutionary implications of the Temperature-Size Rule (TSR) in ectotherms is debatable; it is uncertain whether size decrease with temperature increase is an adaptation or a non-adaptive by-product of some temperature-dependent processes. We tested whether (i) the size of the rotifer Lecane inermis affects fecundity in a way that depends on the combination of low or high temperature and oxygen content and (ii) the proximate mechanism underlying TSR in this species is associated with nuclei size adjustment (a proxy of cell size). Small-type and large-type rotifers were obtained by culturing at different temperatures prior to the experiment and then exposed to combinations of two temperature and two oxygen conditions. Fecundity was estimated and used as a measure of fitness. Nuclei and body sizes were measured to examine the response to both environmental factors tested. The results show the following for L. inermis. (i) Body size affects fecundity in response to both temperature and oxygen, supporting a hypothesis regarding the contribution of oxygen in TSR. (ii) Large individuals are generally more fecund than small ones; however, under a combination of high temperature and poor oxygen conditions, small individuals are more fecund than large ones, in accordance with a hypothesis of the adaptive significance of TSR. (iii) The body size response to temperature is realised by nuclei size adjustment. (iv) Nuclei size changes in response to temperature and oxygen conditions, in agreement with hypotheses on the cellular mechanism underlying TSR and on a contribution of oxygen availability in TSR. These results serve as empirical evidence for the adaptive significance of TSR and validation of the cellular mechanism for the observed response. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Three dimensional printing as an effective method of producing anatomically accurate models for studies in thermal ecology,"Watson, Charles M. and Francis, Gamal R.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Hollow copper models painted to match the reflectance of the animal subject are standard in thermal ecology research. While the copper electroplating process results in accurate models, it is relatively time consuming, uses caustic chemicals, and the models are often anatomically imprecise. Although the decreasing cost of 3D printing can potentially allow the reproduction of highly accurate models, the thermal performance of 3D printed models has not been evaluated. We compared the cost, accuracy, and performance of both copper and 3D printed lizard models and found that the performance of the models were statistically identical in both open and closed habitats. We also find that 3D models are more standard, lighter, durable, and inexpensive, than the copper electroformed models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Ten male participants cycled at 62\% VO(2)max for 90 min in 32 degrees C and 40\% relative humidity. A thermoneutral (37 degrees C) or ice-slushy (- 1 degrees C) sports drink was given at 3.5 ml kg(-1) body mass every 15 min during exercise. VIP and rectal temperature increased during exercise (mean +/- standard deviation: 4.6 +/- 4.4 pmol L-1, P=0.005; and 1.3 +/- 0.4 degrees C, P <0.001 respectively) and were moderately associated (r=0.35, P=0.008). While rectal temperature and VIP were not different between trials, ice-slushy significantly reduced heat storage (P=0.010) and skin temperature (time x trial interaction P=0.038). It appears that VIP does not provide the signal linking cold beverage ingestion and lower skin temperature in the heat. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We sought to measure the plasma antioxidant defenses and cytokine response together with oxidative damage post-exercise in a temperate versus a hot environment. The plasma concentrations of vasoactive endothelin-1 and vascular angiogenic growth factor were also evaluated. Male athletes (n=9) volunteered to participate. The athletes randomly performed two bouts of treadmill exercise of 45 min at 75-80\% of maximal oxygen uptake in a climatic-controlled chamber under two different conditions: temperate environment (10-12 degrees C, 40-55\% humidity) and hot, humid environment (30-32 degrees C, 75-78\% humidity). Venous blood samples were obtained immediately pre- and post-bout and on recovery after 2 h. Serum glucose, malondialdehyde and lactate concentrations were significantly increased post-exercise in hot but maintained in the temperate environment; these post-exercise values were significantly higher after exercise in hot than in temperate. Urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine concentration, plasma phosphocreatine kinase and catalase activities, creatinine and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and interleukin-6 significantly increased post-exercise in hot but maintained in temperate environment. The post-exercise circulating values of antioxidant enzyme paraoxonase-1 and endothelin were significantly higher in the hot than in temperate environment. Exercise in a hot and humid environment resulted in mild hyperthermia with elevated perceived exertion and thermal stress. Hyperthermic environment induced hyperglycemia, lactatecidemia and more cellular and oxidative damage than exercise in a temperate environment but also induced a post-exercise antioxidant and anti-inflammatory response in plasma. These results suggest that environmental temperature needs to be taken into account when evaluating exercise-related oxidative stress and inflammation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

W. and Maxwell, N. S.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"New technologies afford convenient modalities for skin temperature (T-SKIN) measurement, notably involving wireless telemetry and non-contact infrared thermometry. The purpose of this study was to investigate the validity and reliability of skin temperature measurements using a telemetry thermistor system (7) and thermal camera (TC) during exercise in a hot environment. Each system was compared against a certified thermocouple, measuring the surface temperature of a metal block in a thermostatically controlled waterbath. Fourteen recreational athletes completed two incremental running tests, separated by one week. Skin temperatures were measured simultaneously with IT and TC compared against a hard-wired thermistor system (HW) throughout rest and exercise. Post hoc calibration based on waterbath results displayed good validity for TT (mean bias {[}MB] = -0.18 degrees C, typical error [}TE] = 0.18 degrees C) and reliability (MB = -0.05 degrees C, TE = 0.31 degrees C) throughout rest and exercise. Poor validity (MB = -1.4 degrees C, TE = 0.35 degrees C) and reliability (MB = -0.65 degrees C. TE = 0.52 degrees C) was observed for TC, suggesting it may be best suited to controlled, static situations. These findings indicate IT systems provide a convenient, valid and reliable alternative to NW, useful for measurements in the field where traditional methods may be impractical.

article,The thermal tolerance of crayfish could be estimated from respiratory electron transport system activity,"Simcic, Tatjana and Pajk, Franja and Jaklic, Martina and Brancelj, Anton and Vrezec, Al",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Whether electron transport system (ETS) activity could be used as an estimator of crayfish thermal tolerance has been investigated experimentally. Food consumption rate, respiration rates in the air and water, the difference between energy consumption and respiration costs at a given temperature ('potential growth scope', PGS), and ETS activity of Orconectes limosus and Pacifastacus leniusculus were determined over a temperature range of 5-30 degrees C. All concerned parameters were found to be temperature dependent. The significant correlation between ETS activity and PGS indicates that they respond similarly to temperature change. The regression analysis of ETS activity as an estimator of thermal tolerance at the mitochondrial level and PGS as an indicator of thermal tolerance at the organismic level showed the shift of optimum temperature ranges of ETS activity to the right for 2 degrees in O. limosus and for 3 in P. leniusculus. Thus, lower estimated temperature optima and temperatures of optimum ranges of PGS compared to ETS activity could indicate higher thermal sensitivity at the organismic level than at a lower level of complexity (i.e. at the mitochondrial level). The response of ETS activity to temperature change, especially at lower and higher temperatures, indicates differences in the characteristics of the ETSs in O. limosus and P. leniusculus. O. limosus is less sensitive to high temperature. The significant correlation between PGS and ETS activity supports our assumption that ETS activity could be used for the rapid estimation of thermal tolerance in crayfish species.

article,Microscopic evaluation of vesicles shed by rat erythrocytes at elevated temperatures,"Moore, T. and Sorokulova, I. and Pustovyy, O. and Globa, L. and Vodyanoy, V.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"It is hypothesized that the elevation of the temperature of the blood during heat stress may cause an increase of the shedding of erythrocyte membrane vesicles. Therefore, the increase of vesicle numbers following heat stress may be indicative of and proportional to the level heat stress. In order to test this hypothesis, erythrocytes and the vesicles shed by erythrocytes were collected from rat blood and analyzed after the elevation of body temperature by exposure to external heat. The images of erythrocytes and vesicles were analyzed by a custom light microscopy system with spatial resolution of better than 90 nm. The samples were observed in an aqueous environment and required no freezing, dehydration, staining, shadowing, marking or any other manipulation. The elevation of temperature from 36.7 +/- 0.3 to 40.3 +/- 0.4 degrees C resulted in significant increase of the concentration of vesicles in blood. At a temperature of 37 degrees C, mean vesicle concentrations and diameters found in rat blood were (1.4 +/- 0.2) x 10(6) vesicles/mu L and 0.436 +/- 0.03 mu m, respectively. The concentration of free vesicles increased after exposure to heat to (3.8 +/- 0.3) x 10(6) vesicles/mu L. It was estimated that 80\% of all vesicles found in rat blood are smaller than 0.45 mu m. The increase in the number of vesicle associated with elevated temperatures may be indicative of the heat stress level and serve as diagnostic test of erythrocyte stability and heat resistance.

article,Lung perfusion is affected by chronic cold exposure,"Mustafa, Seham and Elgazzar, Abdelhamid and Khadadah, Mousa and Al Hussaini, Maryam",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Background/Aim: The Respiratory system can be affected by exposure to cold. It is well known that acute cold exposure induces asthmatic attacks. However, the influence of chronic cold environment exposure on lung perfusion and the pulmonary circulation was not studied in any previous study. Therefore this study was designed to investigates the effects of chronic cold exposure on lung perfusion using radionuclide study. Methods: New Zealand White rabbits were used in these experiments. The rabbits were kept in the cold room (4 C) for 7 weeks. Lung perfusion scintigraphy was performed at the end of this period. Each rabbit was injected with 74 MBq (2 mCi) technetium-99m macroaggregated of albumin ((99m)'Tc MAA). Perfusion studies were done using Gamma camera equipped with a low energy, high resolution, parallel hole collimator interfaced with a computer. Static images were obtained 5 min after administration of the radiotracer. Static images were acquired include anterior/posterior (Ant/Post), right anterior oblique/left posterior oblique (RAO/LPO), right lateral/left lateral (RLat/LLat), right posterior oblique/left anterior oblique (RPO/LAO). Results: Rabbits chronically exposed to cold had lesser lung perfusion than controls using radionuclide perfusion study. The lung counts of chronic cold exposure (4 degrees C) for 7 weeks on rabbit lung perfusion for 5 min was 64 +/- 4\%. (n=6, {*}{*}{*}P < 0.001). Conclusions: Our results indicate that chronic cold exposure decreased pulmonary circulation and lung perfusion in normal subjects. Therefore chronic cold exposure might worsen some diseases that are affected by cold such as asthma. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Surface temperature determined by IRT and blubber depth assessed with portable imaging ultrasound were monitored concurrently at eight body sites over the course of a year in long-term captive individuals under controlled conditions. Site-specific differences in surface temperature were noted between winter and summer in both species. Overall, surface temperature was slightly higher and more variable in harbor seals (9.8 +/- 0.6 degrees C) than Steller sea lions (9.1 +/- 0.5 degrees C). Limited site-specific relationships were found between surface temperature and blubber thickness, however, insulation level alone explained a very small portion of the variance. Therefore, while validated IRT data collection can potentially provide valuable information on the health, condition and metabolic state of an animal, it cannot provide a generalized proxy for blubber depth.

Active haenyeos showed greater local cold tolerance in terms of higher minimum temperature of the left finger during immersion and recovery than the other two groups (P < 0.05). Furthermore, active haenyeos showed higher skin temperatures of the right finger and left foot as well (P < 0.05). Older retired haenyeos displayed the second best minimum finger temperature both during immersion and during recovery (15 min and 20 min), whereas their local cold tolerance was evaluated as inferior to active haenyeos and the age-matched nondivers in CIVD frequency, finger pain sensation, thermal comfort, and finger temperature during the earlier period of recovery (5 min and 10 min). These results suggested that older retired haenyeos' cold tolerance in their extremities disappeared in terms of finger temperature in their initial recovery periods, but that they might still retain cold adaptation in terms of minimum finger temperature or later recovery responses, even though the attributes were not marked as much as those of active haenyeos.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102642,91,NA,NA,102642,Older women divers; Haenyeos; Cold-induced vasodilation (CIVD); Aging; Deacclimatization
article,Predicting military working dog core temperature during exertional heat strain: Validation of a Canine Thermal Model,"O'Brien, Catherine and Tharion, William J. and Karis, Anthony J. and Sullivan, Heather M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Military working dogs (MWDs) operate under a wide range of conditions, including hot environments. Predicting how long a MWD can safely work without overheating is important for both health and performance. A Canine Thermal Model (CTM) was developed to predict core temperature (Tc) of MWDs. The CTM calculates heat storage from the balance of heat production from metabolism and heat exchange with the environment. Inputs to the CTM are: meteorological conditions (ambient temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation and wind speed), physical characteristics of the dog (mass, length), and metabolic activity (MET level, estimated from accelerometer data). The CTM was validated against Tc measured in 23 MWDs during training sessions (11.6 +/- 5.0 min (mean +/- standard deviation), range 4-26 min) in October (24 degrees C, 52\% RH), March (14 degrees C, 74\% RH), or August (28 degrees C, 64\% RH), and 24 kennel MWDs during a standard exercise walk (11.4 +/- 3.3 min, range 5.6-18 min) in July (26 degrees C, 77\% RH). The CTM was considered acceptable if predicted Tc was within +/- 0.5 degrees C of measured Tc at the end of exercise. Compared to Tc at the end of training sessions (39.8 +/- 0.6 degrees C, range 38.4-41.1 degrees C) and exercise walks (40.0 +/- 0.7 degrees C, range 38.9-41.4 degrees C), the CTM-predicted Tc was within +/- 0.5 degrees C for 71 of 84 cases (85\%) and 19 of 24 cases (79\%), respectively. The mean difference between CTM-predicted and measured final Tc during training was -0.04 +/- 0.43 degrees C, with 80 of 84 cases (95\%) within the range of +/- 2 SD (Bland Altman comparison). During exercise walks the mean difference was -0.15 degrees C +/- 0.57, with 23 of 24 cases (96\%) within +/- 2 SD.

article,Is it advantageous for Atlantic salmon to be triploid at lower temperatures?,"Riseth, Erling Nilsen and Fraser, Thomas W. K. and Sambraus, Florian and Stien, Lars Helge and Hvas, Malthe",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Marine organisms living at low temperatures tend to have larger genomes and larger cells which suggest that these traits can be beneficial in colder environments. In fish, triploidy (three complete sets of chromosomes) can be induced experimentally following fertilization, which provides a model system to investigate the hypothesis that larger cells and genomes offers a physiological advantage at low temperatures. We tested this hypothesis by measuring metabolic rates and swimming performance of diploid and triploid Atlantic salmon (Salmo solar) post smolts acclimated to 3 or 10.5 degrees C. At 10.5 degrees C, triploids had significantly lower maximum metabolic rates which resulted in a lower aerobic scope compared to diploids. In addition, triploids initiated ram ventilation at lower swimming speeds, providing further evidence of a reduced capacity to meet oxygen demands during strenuous activity at 10.5 degrees C. However, at 3 degrees C, metabolic rates and critical swimming speeds were similar between both ploidies, and as expected substantially lower than at 10.5 degrees C. Therefore, triploidy in colder environments did not provide any advantage over diploidy in terms of metabolic rate traits or swimming performance in Atlantic salmon. We therefore conclude that traits, other than aerobic scope and swimming performance, contribute to the trend for increased cell and genome size in marine ectotherms living in cold environments.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102548,89,NA,NA,102548,Aerobic scope; Critical swimming speed; Cell size; Genome size; Metabolism

Annual changes (P < 0.05) in hair density, diameter, length and thickness, as well as the skin blood capillaries and sweat gland area differed between breeds. The modifications on hair coat traits resulted in minor changes on the effective thermal conductivity of the hair coat surface both for Morada Nova and Santa Ines sheep. Nevertheless, it was clearly evident that the overall cutaneous thermal insulation for Morada Nova sheep was lowest in September that was coupled with lower hair density, coat thickness, and higher sweat gland and blood capillary area (P < 0.05).

L. and Antonialli-Junior, William F.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Social insects depend on their nests for protection against predation and abiotic threats. Accordingly, the chemical compounds present in the material wasps use to build their nests can both facilitate communication and repel predators. It is herein hypothesized that different wasp species build their nests with different structure and substrate materials and that such materials consist of chemical compounds related to unique wasp behavior and outside temperature variation. To test this hypothesis, nests were collected from three species of social wasps, the samples of which were subjected to temperature variation under laboratory conditions. The compounds present in the substrate were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Chemical compounds identified in the nest material of the three species responded differently to temperature variation. Chemical compounds from Polybia nests were altered significantly when subjected to temperature variation, whereas the nests of Polistes versicolor did not significantly change in relation to the control. The differences found between Polistes and Polybia nests may be related to genetic factors, but also to the type of nest they construct. It is possible that divergent evolutionary strategies for maintaining colony temperature, as a function of the chemical composition of the nests, may have appeared between wasps that have open and closed nests. In relatively small colonies, nest substrate is more resistant to temperature variation because it is composed of a greater diversity of elements and thus capable of holding heavier, longer carbon chains. Our results suggest that chemical compounds in the nest material of the three wasp species analysed responded differently to fluctuating ambient temperatures and that such variation could result from the biochemical differences of unique wasp species or from thermoregulation strategies of colonies.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.009,84,NA,214-220,NA,Envelope nest; Social insects; Colonial thermoregulation; Temperature variation; Paper wasps

S.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In this experiment, psychogenic (mental arithmetic), thermogenic (mean body temperature elevation of 0.6 degrees C) and combined thermo-psychogenic treatments were used to explore eccrine sweat-gland recruitment from glabrous (volar hand and forehead) and non-glabrous skin surfaces (chest). It was hypothesised that each treatment would activate the same glands, and that glandular activity would be intermittent. Nine individuals participated in a single trial with normothermic and mildly hyperthermic phases. When normothermic, a 10-min arithmetical challenge was administered, during which sudomotor activity was recorded. Following passive heating and thermal clamping, sweating responses were again evaluated (10 min). A second arithmetical challenge (10 min) was administered during clamped hyperthermia, with its sudorific impact recorded. The activity of individual sweat glands was recorded at 60-s intervals, using precisely positioned, and uniformly applied, starch-iodide papers. Those imprints were digitised and analysed. Peak activity typically occurred during the thermo-psychogenic treatment, revealing physiologically active densities of 128 (volar hand), 165 (forehead) and 77 glands.cm(-2) (chest). Except for the hand (46\%), glands uniquely activated by one treatment were consistently < 10\% of the total glands identified. Glandular activations were most commonly of an intermittent nature, particularly during the thermogenic treatment. Accordingly, we accepted the hypothesis that psychogenic, thermogenic and thermo-psychogenic stimuli activate the same sweat glands in both the glabrous and non-glabrous regions. In addition, this investigation has provided detailed descriptions of the intermittent nature of sweat-gland activity, revealing that a consistent proportion of the physiologically active glands are recruited during these thermal and non-thermal stimuli.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.04.017,82,NA,242-251,NA,Activated sweat glands; Non-thermal sweating; Psychological sweating; Sweat-gland output; Sweat-gland recruitment; Sudomotor
article,A winter energetics model for bobcats in a deep snow environment,"Newbury, Roberta K. and Hodges, Karen E.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Understanding basic energetic requirements of wildlife species is critical to evaluate how individuals persist in their current environments as well as to forecast responses to changed climates or habitats. Indeed, northern range limits are often thought to reflect harsh abiotic conditions that exceed the capacity of individuals to stay in energetic balance. Bobcats (Lynx rufus) occur across much of North America; at northern latitudes, they face winter challenges such as deep snows, cold temperatures, and possible food scarcity. We developed an energetics model from field data on movements, body mass, and observed diet of bobcats in mountains of northwest Montana, then evaluated overwinter prey requirements that would enable bobcats to stay in energy balance in this difficult environment. Our model indicated average daily energy expenditures were similar to 1.41 x basal metabolic rate. For 90 days from December to February, a 10.5 kg bobcat consuming prey items in proportion with the observed diet for bobcats in this area would need about 2.1 kg of deer (Odocoileus spp.), 7 snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus), 155 red squirrels (Tanu:asciurus hudsonicus), 9 woodrats (Neotoma cinerea), and 250 small rodents (Cricetidae).

Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, ASA), as a multifunctional drug has also been reported to exert hypoglycemic effects in the treatment of diabetes. We estimated the effect of HF (45 min/41 +/- 0.5 degrees C/24 h recovery) and single dose aspirin (100 mg/kg b.w./i.p) treatment over carbohydrate related enzymes and substrates in a time-dependent (2, 7 and 14 days) manner of duration of diabetes in the lives of rats. Heat preconditioning resulted in lower liver glucose concentration, but higher HK activity and lower G6P-ase very evident and significantly higher glycogen content and GPho-ase activity, as well as very evident and significantly lower F1,6BP-ase and higher PFK activity compared to control diabetic animals. Aspirin pretreatment of HP-diabetic animals is manifested with significantly lower blood and liver glucose higher G6P concentration, lower G6P-ase and HK activity as well as higher Glk content and GPho-ase activity compared both to diabetic and HP-diabetic animals. In conclusion, both HP and aspirin, as physiological and pharmacological inductors of HSP70, respectively attenuate the carbohydrate-related disturbances in diabetic rats, with almost tendency to normalisation to the control values for most of the estimated parameters.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.12.005,79,NA,190-198,NA,Heat preconditioning; Aspirin; Experimental diabetes; Carbohydrate-related enzymes and substrates

It helps prevent injury and promotes recovery. This study aimed to examine the duration of the effects of evening partial body cryostimulation (PBC) on core and skin temperatures. Seven male athletes participated in this study. On the day of PBC, at 18:00, each athlete was exposed to PBC (approx. -180 degrees C) in a specially designed cabin for 3 min. On the control day, at 18:00, the participants sat still on a sofa for 10 min. On both days, bedtime was at around 23:00. Wrist and abdominal skin temperatures, except during PBC, were recorded with Thermochron thermistors after 17:30. Core temperatures were monitored with an ingestible and telemetric core body temperature sensor and a data recorder. The circadian rhythm of the core temperature was observed on both days. The core temperature at 22:30 was found to be lower on the PBC day. Wrist and abdominal skin temperatures recovered after PBC; however, the residual effects on both were different. The abdominal skin temperature at 22:30 was lower on the PBC day. Subjective sleep quality and next morning sleepiness did not differ between the conditions. These results suggested that the effects of a 3-min evening PBC session on the core and skin temperatures lasted for several hours. However, these differences did not affect the subjective sleep quality.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.12.016,79,NA,144-148,NA,Partial body; cryostimulation; Core temperature; Skin temperature
article,A new occupational heat tolerance test: A feasibility study,"Watkins, Emily R. and Gibbons, Jemma and Dellas, Yanoula and Hayes, Mark and Watt, Peter and Richardson, Alan J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Heat tolerance tests identify those susceptible to heat illnesses and monitor heat adaptations. Currently, tolerance tests do not replicate the uncompensable heat strain environments experienced in some occupations. In addition, tests can take up to 2 h to complete, and cannot offer intra and inter individual comparisons, due to the use of a fixed exercise intensity. This study aimed to assess the validity and reliability of a new heat occupational tolerance test (HOTT: 40 min at 6 W kg(-1) metabolic heat production, 50 degrees C 10\% RH, in protective clothing) to the standard heat tolerance test (HTT: 2 h walk at 5 km h(-1) 1\% gradient, 40 degrees C 40\% RH, in shorts and t-shirt). Eighteen participants (age: 21 +/- 3 yrs, body mass: 81.3 +/- 5.9 kg) completed trials to assess the validity and/or reliability of the HOTT. Peak rectal temperature (T-re) displayed strong agreement and low measurement error (0.19 degrees C) between HTT (38.7 +/- 0.4 degrees C) and HOTT (38.6 +/- 0.4 degrees C). Strong agreement was also displayed for physiological and perceptual measures between the two HOTT trials, including peak T-re (38.5 +/- 0.4 degrees C vs. 38.5 +/- 0.4 degrees C) and peak heart rate (182 +/- 20 b min(-1) vs. 182 +/- 21 b min(-1)). The HOTT is the first tolerance test that assesses individuals' responses whilst wearing protective clothing in high temperatures. It can consistently identify individuals' levels of heat tolerance within a reduced time frame. In addition, it allows for participant monitoring over time and comparisons between individuals to be made. A continuum based approach is recommended when assessing individuals' responses to the HOTT.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.09.001,78,NA,42-50,NA,Heat tolerance; Occupational health; Validity; Reliability; Personal protective equipment

Their work-related physical activities may aid active heat acclimatization. However, it is unknown whether adding physical training to improve adaptation is effective, particularly if there is sufficient time for full acclimatization, classically reached after 15 days. Thirty French soldiers (Training group, T) performed a progressive and moderate (from three to five 8-min running sets at 50-60\% of their speed at VO2max with 4-min periods of active recovery in between) aerobic training program upon arriving at their base in United Arab Emirates (similar to 40 degrees C and 20\% RH). A control group (30 soldiers; No Training, NT) continued to perform only their usual outdoor military activities (similar to 5 h d(-1)). A field heat stress test (HST: three 8-min running sets at 50\% of the speed at VO2max) was performed before (D0), during (D10), and after (D15) the heat acclimatization period to assess physiological and psychological changes. An 8-km trial in battledress was then performed at D17. Although physiological modifications were mostly similar (p < 0.001 for all) for both groups (rectal temperature at the end of the HST: -0.58 +/- 0.51 vs -0.53 +/- 0.40 degrees C, HR at the end of the HST: -21 +/- 12 vs -19 +/- 9 bpm, and sweat osmolality: - 47 +/- 30 vs - 26 +/- 32 mOsmol.1(-1) between D15 and D0 for T and NT groups, respectively), thermal discomfort ( - 31 +/- 4 vs -11 +/- 5 mm between D15 and D0, p = 0.001) and rates of perceived exertion ( - 3.0 +/- 0.4 vs -1.4 +/- 0.3 D15 and D0, p = 0.001) were much lower in the T than NT group during the HST. HST-induced modifications in facial temperature only decreased in the T group ( -1.08 +/- 0.28 between D15 and D0, p < 0.001). Moreover, there was a difference in perceived thermal discomfort during the 8-km trial (40 +/- 20 vs 55 +/- 22 mm for the T and NT groups, respectively, p = 0.010). Thus, a 15-day, low-volume training regimen during a mission in a hot and dry environment has a modest impact on physiological adaptation but strongly decreases the perceived strain of exertion and climate potentially via greater reductions in facial temperature, even during a classical operational physical task in a military context.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.08.017,77,NA,145-156,NA,Heat acclimatization; Training; Military; Rectal temperature; Thermal discomfort; Rates of perceived exertion

We studied two arthropods from the Andean Range in central Chile (2400 m a.s.l.), the stick insect Agathemera crassa commonly named as ``Chinchemolle{''}, and the tarantula spider Euathlus condorito commonly named as ``Arana pollito{''}, in order to evaluate how they respond to low temperatures at the physiological and molecular levels. We sampled the soil temperature during one year to track the temperature changes that these organisms must overcome. We found minimum temperatures around -6 degrees C in autumn, while the temperature were stable at 0 degrees C in winter due to the snow. The average field-cooling rate was 0.01 +/- 0.006 degrees C min(-1). For both arthropods we determined the super cooling point (SCP) at a cooling rate of 1 degrees C min(-1) and its subsequent survival, finding that A. crassa is a freezing tolerant organism with a SCP of -3.8 +/- 1.8 degrees C and 100\% survival, while E. condorito is a freezing avoidant organism with a SCP of -3.0 +/- 1.3 degrees C and 0\% survival. The SCP and survival were not affected by the season in which individuals were collected, the SCP was significantly affected by the cooling rate of the experiment. Both species had low molecular weight cryoprotective in their hemolymph that could explain their cold-tolerance behavior. Glucose, glycerol, and trehalose were found in A. crassa's hemolymph, only glucose and glycerol were found in E. condorito's. We analyzed the hemolymph proteins and found no seasonal differences in composition for either species and also we detected protein antifreeze activity in the hemolymph from both arthropods.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.03.018,74,NA,133-139,NA,Cold tolerance; Supercooling point; Thermal hysteresis; Ice recrystallization inhibition; Cryoprotectants

Six 30-mo-old Nellore bulls (669 +/- 65 kg BW) were randomly assigned to four 6-h periods in a Latin Square design such that measurements of each animal cover a 24-h cycle. Meteorological variables (air temperature, relative humidity, local solar irradiance, ultraviolet radiation, wind speed and black globe temperature) were recorded at regular one-minute intervals with an automated weather station. Respiratory rate, ventilation rate, oxygen, carbon dioxide, methane, saturation pressure, air temperature of the exhaled air, saturation pressure in the air leaving the ventilated capsule placed over the animal surface, hair coat, skin surface and rectal temperature were assessed. The thermal equilibrium was determined according to the principles of the first law of thermodynamics using biophysical equations. Animals were evaluated in an area which was protected from solar radiation, rain, and had a range of ambient air temperature between 20.57 +/- 0.07 and 30.86 +/- 0.07 degrees C. Percentage of O-2 and CO2 in the exhaled air changed moderately (P < 0.0001) throughout the 24 h, which resulted in an average metabolic heat production of 151.45 +/- 13.60 W m(-2). At the largest thermal gradient (T-S - T-A; from 24:00-07:00 h), heat transferred by long wave radiation and surface convection corresponded to near 60\% of the metabolism. At 11:00 h the ambient temperature approached 29 degrees C and latent heat became the main way to cool the body. From this time until 17:00 h, cutaneous evaporation represented approximately 53\% of total heat loss. In conclusion, results of the present study seem to be a good indicator of lower energy expenditure for body thermal regulation, high heat tolerance and adaptation of Nellore cattle to the tropical environment.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.04.014,74,NA,317-324,NA,Adaptation; Latent heat loss; Thermoregulation; Zebu cattle

Once ignored by aquaculturists because of their perceived low economic value, renewed aquaculture efforts in Central and South America aim to relieve fishing pressures on natural pacu populations. In the southern United States pacu aquaculture for the aquarium trade has raised concerns that accidental release could lead to establishment of overwintering populations outside captivity a threat accentuated by the average 6 degrees C increase in shallow-water temperatures predicted by the end of the century. In the present study, Critical and Chronic Thermal Methodology was used to quantify red-bellied pacu thermal tolerance niche requirements. The data suggest that red-belllied pacu are a thermophilic species capable of tolerating low and high chronic temperatures of 16.5 degrees C and 35 degrees C, respectively. Critical thermal minimum and maximum temperatures of fish acclimated near their chronic limits are 10.3 and 44.4 degrees C. Red-bellied pacu aquaculture in the United States is concentrated in subtropical Florida regions that encourage rapid growth and reproduction, but carry an increased risk of establishing reproducing populations in local freshwater systems. The thermal niche data show that the risk of bioinvasion can be reduced or eliminated by adopting an approach whereby aquaculture potential is integrated with environmental temperature constraints.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.03.015,74,NA,110-115,NA,Bioinvasion; Climate change; Fish; Global warming; Invasive species; Piaractus brachypomus
article,Bursty spike trains of antennal thermo- and bimodal hygro-thermoreceptor neurons encode noxious heat in elaterid beetles,"Nurme, Karin and Merivee, Enno and Must, Anne and Di Giulio, Andrea and Muzzi, Maurizio and Williams, Ingrid and Mand, Marika",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The main purpose of this study was to explain the internal fine structure of potential antennal thermo- and hygroreceptive sensilla, their innervation specifics, and responses of the sensory neurons to thermal and humidity stimuli in an elaterid beetle using focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy and electrophysiology, respectively. Several essential, high temperature induced turning points in the locomotion were determined using automated video tracking. Our results showed that the sensilla under study, morphologically, are identical to the dome-shaped sensilla (DSS) of carabids. A cold-hot neuron and two bimodal hygro-thermoreceptor neurons, the moist-hot and dry-hot neuron, innervate them. Above 25-30 degrees C, all the three neurons, at different threshold temperatures, switch from regular spiking to temperature dependent spike bursting. The percentage of bursty DSS neurons on the antenna increases with temperature increase suggesting that this parameter of the neurons may encode noxious heat in a graded manner. Thus, we show that besides carabid beetles, elaterids are another large group of insects with this ability. The threshold temperature of the beetles for onset of elevated locomotor activity (OELA) was lower by 11.9 degrees C compared to that of critical thermal maximum (39.4 degrees C). Total paralysis occurred at 41.8 degrees C. The threshold temperatures for spike bursting of the sensory neurons in DSS and OELA of the beetles coincide suggesting that probably the spike bursts are responsible for encoding noxious heat when confronted. In behavioural thermoregulation, spike bursting DSS neurons serve as a fast and firm threefold early warning system for the beetles to avoid overheating and death.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.01.008,72,NA,101-117,NA,Dome-shaped sensillum; Inner structure; Moist-hot neuron; Dry-hot neuron; Cold-hot neuron; Behavioural thermoregulation

The 1D and 7D groups received 42 degrees C during 15 mins HWI for 1 and 7 days, respectively. The blood samples were collected for proinflammatory cytokines examinations, the heart, liver and kidney were excised for subsequent IHC analysis to measure the level of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). The results revealed that the body temperature increased significantly during HWI on Day 3 and significantly declined on Days 6 and 7. For the 7D group, body weight, heart rate, hematocrit, platelet, osmolarity, and lactate level were lower than those in the 1D group. Furthermore, the levels of granulocyte counts, tumor necrosis factor-a, and interleukin-6 were lower in the 7D group than in the 1D group. The induction of HSP70 in the 1D group was higher than in the other groups. Physiological responses to occasional HWI are disadvantageous because of heat stress.

article,Variation in rhinarium temperature indicates sensory specializations in placental mammals,"Glaser, Nele and Kroger, Ronald H. H.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The rhinarium, a specialized nose-tip characterized by an area of naked and wet skin around the nostrils, is a typical mammalian structure. The type and amount of innervation suggests a sensory role and morphological diversity implies so far unidentified species-specific functional specializations. Rhinaria also vary in temperature and this may be related to the functions of these sensory organs. We performed a comparative study on rhinarium temperature in order to learn more about possible correlations with phylogeny and ecology. We have concentrated on terrestrial carnivorans and large herbivores, but also investigated a number of other species, some of them lacking typical rhinaria. We used infrared (IR) thermography to determine nose skin temperatures from safe distances and without interfering with the animals' behavior. In all groups studied, the temperature of the rhinarium/nose-tip decreased with decreasing ambient temperature. At all ambient temperatures, rhinarium temperature was lower, by 9-17 degrees C, in carnivorans compared to herbivores. Glires (rodents and lagomorphs), haplorrhine primates, and omnivorous Perisso- and Artiodactyla were intermediate. In strepsirrhine primates, rhinarium temperature was similar to ambient temperature. Our findings in Strepsirrhini are consistent with the hypothesis that their rhinaria have an indirect role in chemical communication. Warm rhinaria in herbivores suggest a tactile function, while the low skin temperatures on carnivoran rhinaria may make the skin particularly sensitive to warming.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.04.010,67,NA,30-34,NA,Nose; Skin; Senses; Mammals; Thermography

Temperature (core, tympanic, skin and mean body), heart rate, blood pressure, and thermal comfort and sensation were recorded pre- and post- (immediately and every 5 min until 35 min post) exposure to a single bout of WBC (30 s at-60 degrees C, 150 s at 110 degrees C). Anthropometric data (height, weight, body surface area, body mass index, fat mass and fat free mass) were also recorded. No significant differences in temperature (core, tympanic, skin and mean body), heart rate, blood pressure, or thermal comfort / sensation were observed between male and females at baseline.

Glutamate and its various receptors are present at the mPOA. The aim of this study was to identify the contribution of each of the ionotropic glutamatergic receptors at the mPOA on changes in T-br and T-b in freely moving rats. Adult male Wistar rats (n=40) were implanted with bilateral guide cannula with indwelling styli above the mPOA. A telemetric transmitter was implanted at the peritoneum to record T-b and locomotor activity (LMA). A precalibrated thermocouple wire implanted near the hypothalamus was used to assess T-br. Specific agonist for each ionotropic glutamate receptor was micro-injected into the mPOA and its effects on temperature and LMA were measured in the rats. The rats were also microinjected with the respective ionotropic receptor antagonists, 15 min prior to the microinjection of each agonist. Amongst amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and kainic acid, AMPA increased T-b and LMA when injected at the mPOA. Specific antagonists for AMPA receptors was able to attenuate this increase (p < 0.005). Pharmacological blockade of NMDA was able to lower T-br only. Microinjection of kainic acid and its antagonist had no effect on the variables. The finding of the study suggests that activation of the AMPA receptors at the mPOA, leads to the rise in body temperature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The average temperature-humidity indices at 0700,1400 and 2200 h were 78.4, 80.2 and 78.7, respectively. Rectal temperatures decreased linearly at 0700, 1400, and 2200 h with increasing GABA. As the GABA increased, the immunoglobulin (Ig) A and IgG contents and the proportions of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes increased linearly (P < 0.05), whereas concentrations of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) decreased linearly (P < 0.05). The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione-peroxidase (GSH-PX) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) increased linearly (P < 0.05), whereas malondialdehyde (MDA) content decreased linearly (P < 0.05) with increasing GABA.

It has been shown that heat stress causes significant adverse effects in both human and animals. Different approaches have been proposed to mitigate the adverse effects caused by heat stress, among which are special diet and probiotics. We characterized the effect of the yeast fermentate EpiCor (EH) on the prevention of heat stress-related complications in rats. We found that increasing the body temperature of animals from 37.1 +/- 0.2 to 40.6 +/- 0.2 degrees C by exposure to heat (45 degrees C for 25 min) resulted in significant morphological changes in the intestine. Villi height and total mucosal thickness decreased in heat-stressed rats pre-treated with PBS in comparison with control animals not exposed to the heat. Oral treatment of rats with EH before heat stress prevented the traumatic effects of heat on the intestine. Changes in intestinal morphology of heat-stressed rats, pre-treated with PBS resulted in significant elevation of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) level in the serum of these animals. Pretreatment with EH was effective in the prevention of LPS release into the bloodstream of heat-stressed rats. Our study revealed that elevation of body temperature also resulted in a significant increase of the concentration of vesicles released by erythrocytes in rats, pre-treated with PBS. This is an indication of a pathological impact of heat on the erythrocyte structure. Treatment of rats with EH completely protected their erythrocytes from this heat-induced pathology. Finally, exposure to heat stress conditions resulted in a significant increase of white blood cells in rats.

article,"Thermal biology of Pacific cicada killers, <i>Sphecius convallis</i> Patton, in the Upper Sonoran Desert","Coelho, Joseph R. and Holliday, Charles W. and Hastings, Jon M. and Phillips, Christy M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"A comprehensive investigation of the Pacific cicada killer, Sphecius convallis Patton, was undertaken to examine the behavioral and physiological mechanisms by which they are able to complete their life cycle in the thermal extremes of the Upper Sonoran Desert. S. convallis were endothermic, exhibiting elevated and relatively constant thorax temperatures during many activities. Males basked in trees at dawn to warm up, then used a variety of behaviors and perching strategies to maintain thorax temperature during territorial behavior. The thorax temperature of females was highest during provisioning and orientation flights, somewhat lower while investigating burrows, and lowest while digging burrows. The optimal thorax temperature for flight was about 40 degrees C, which was approximated most closely by males resting in the shade during the afternoon. In mating clusters, the mated male was the hottest, the female was coolest and the other males were intermediate. Wasps lost about 5\% of body mass during heating treatments, and may use evaporative water loss for cooling. Pacific cicada killers use a complex suite of behavioral and physiological adaptations to regulate body temperature during their nesting season. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

T. and Lamberson, W. R. and Safranski, T. J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Boars from sows with elevated plasma cortisol during pregnancy have shorter anogenital distance (AGD), a trait associated with subfertility. Since gestating sows often experience summer heat stress (HS), a mouse model was used to evaluate the effect of prenatal HS on AGD and fertility; efficacy of the heat stress-mitigating supplement Artemisia absinthium (AB) was also evaluated. Dams were treated from d 818 of gestation, residing in ambient temperatures from 0700 to 1900 h. From 1900 to 0700 h females were exposed to 34.13 +/- 0.27 degrees C (HS) with access to water (HSW; n=9), HS with access to a 1\% w/v decoction of AB (HSA; n=9), 20.81 +/- 0.20 degrees C (thermal neutral; TN) with water (TNW; n=10) or TN with AB (TNA; n=10). Daily liquid consumption was measured from d 6-18, and tail temperature was recorded at 0700 and 1900 h from d 8-18. Progeny weight and AGD were recorded at birth and weaning. At maturity, males were mated to non-littermate females from each treatment; these females were euthanized after 16 d of TN gestation. Reproductive traits were compared among all male/female treatment combinations; testes were weighed. Average liquid intake differed among treatments with HS and AB animals drinking more (P < 0.0004). A treatment by time interaction for tail temperature (P < 0.001) was observed; HS increased tail temperature of HSA and HSW animals similarly compared to TNA and TNW. Treatment affected (P < 0.01) male birth AGD (HSW shortest; P < 0.07). At maturity, HSW males also had the smallest testes (P < 0.02). However, we observed no differences in fertility (P > 0.10). These data indicate that in utero HS decreases both male birth AGD and adult testis size, effects which maternal AB consumption mitigates. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Effect of nesting environment on incubation temperature and hatching success of Morelet's crocodile (<i>Crocodylus moreletii</i>) in an urban lake of Southeastern Mexico,"Lopez-Luna, Marco A. and Hidalgo-Mihart, Mircea G. and Aguirre-Leon, Gustavo and Gonzalez-Ramon, Mariana del C. and Rangel-Mendoza, Judith A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Incubation temperature is an important aspect in terms of biological performance among crocodiles, and several controlled experiments have demonstrated a significant relationship between incubation temperature, success in hatching and survival of hatchlings. However, a few studies have tested these relationships in the wild. The objective of this study was to determine the relationship of nest characteristics and environment (hatch year, nest basal area and height, clutch size, distance to shore line, and vegetation cover), to incubation temperature and hatching success among Morelet's crocodile (Crocodylus moreletii). The study was carried out during the nesting seasons of Morelet's crocodile, from 2007 to 2009 in the Laguna de Las Ilusiones, an urban lake located in Villahermosa, Tabasco, Mexico. We physically characterized 18 nests and inserted a temperature data logger in each nest chamber. At the end of the nesting season and prior to hatching, we recovered the crocodile eggs and data loggers and calculated hatching success, under laboratory conditions. We related the environmental variables of the nest with the mean and fluctuation (standard deviation) of nest temperature, using linear models. We also related the environmental variables affecting the nest, to mean nest temperature and fluctuation in incubation temperature and to hatching success, using linear models. Although we found differences in incubation temperature between nests, mean incubation temperature did not differ between years, but there were differences in nest thermal fluctuation between years. The mean incubation temperature for 11 nests (61.1\%) was lower than the suggested Female-Male pivotal temperature (producing 50\% of each sex) for this species, and all hatchlings obtained were males. There were no differences in clutch size between years, but hatching success varied. Our study indicates that hatching success depends on certain environmental variables and nest conditions to which the eggs are subjected, including season, nest size and clutch size. We also discuss the importance of the fluctuation of incubation temperature on hatching success and sex determination. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

M. and Bergoug, H. and Guinebretiere, M. and Eterradossi, N. and Roulston, N. and Verhelst, R. and Bahr, C. and Berckmans, D.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Thermodynamic study of incubated eggs is an important component in the optimisation of incubation processes. However, research on the interaction of heat and moisture transfer mechanisms in eggs is rather limited and does not focus on the hatching stage of incubation. During hatch, both the recently hatched chick and the broken eggshell add extra heat and moisture contents to the hatcher environment. In this study, we have proposed a novel way to estimate thermodynamically the amount of water evaporated from a broken eggshell during hatch. The hypothesis of this study considers that previously reported drops in eggshell temperature during hatching of chicks is the result remaining water content evaporating from the eggshell, released on the inner membrane by the recently hatched wet chick, just before hatch. To reproduce this process, water was sprayed on eggshells to mimic the water-fluid from the wet body of a chick. For each sample of eggshell, the shell geometry and weight, surface area and eggshell temperature were measured. Water evaporation losses and convection coefficient were calculated using a novel model approach considering the simultaneous heat and mass transfer profiles in an eggshell. The calculated average convective coefficient was 23.9 +/- 7.5 W/m(2) degrees C, similar to previously reported coefficients in literature as a function of 0.5-1 m/s air speed range. Comparison between measured and calculated values for the water evaporation showed 68\% probability accuracy, associated to the use of an experimentally derived single heat transfer coefficient. The results support our proposed modelling approach of heat and mass transfer mechanisms. Furthermore, by estimating the amount of evaporated water in an eggshell post-hatch, air humidity levels inside the hatcher can be optimised to ensure wet chicks dry properly while not dehydrating early hatching chicks.

article,"Rapid changes in cell physiology as a result of acute thermal stress House sparrows, <i>Passer domesticus</i>","Jimenez, Ana G. and Williams, Joseph B.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Given that our climate is rapidly changing, Physiological Ecologists have the critical task of identifying characteristics of species that make them either resilient or susceptible to changes in their natural air temperature regime. Because climate change models suggest that heat events will become more common, and in some places more extreme, it is important to consider how extreme heat events might affect the physiology of a species. The implications of more frequent heat wave events for birds have only recently begun to be addressed, however, the impact of these events on the cellular physiology of a species is difficult to assess. We have developed a novel approach using dermal fibroblasts to explore how short-term thermal stress at the whole animal level might affect cellular rates of metabolism. House sparrows, Passer domesticus were separated into a ``control group{''} and a ``heat shocked{''} group, the latter acclimated to 43 degrees C for 24 h. We determined the plasticity of cellular thermal responses by assigning a ``recovery group{''} that was heat shocked as above, but then returned to room temperature for 24 h. Primary dermal fibroblasts were grown from skin of all treatment groups and the pectoralis muscle was collected. We found that glycolysis (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rates (OCR), measured using a Seahorse XF 96 analyzer, were significantly higher in the fibroblasts from the heat shocked group of House sparrows compared with their control counterparts. Additionally, muscle fiber diameters decreased and, in turn, Na+ -K+-ATPase maximal activity in the muscle significantly increased in heat shocked sparrows compared with birds in the control group. All of these physiological alterations due to short-term heat exposure were reversible within 24 h of recovery at room temperature. These results show that acute exposure to heat stress significantly alters the cellular physiology of sparrows, but that this species is plastic enough to recover from such a thermal insult within 24 h.

W. and Dorcas, M. E.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Measuring the thermal conditions of aquatic reptiles with temperature dataloggers is a cost-effective way to study their behavior and habitat use. Temperature dataloggers are a particularly useful and informative approach to studying organisms such as the estuarine diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) that inhabits a dynamic environment often inaccessible to researchers. We used carapace-mounted dataloggers to measure hourly carapace temperature (T-c) of free-ranging terrapins in South Carolina from October 2007 to 2008 to examine the effects of month, sex, creek site, and tide on T-c and to determine the effects of month, sex, and time of day on terrapin basking frequency. Simultaneous measurements of environmental temperatures (T-e; shallow mud, deep mud, water) allowed us to make inferences about terrapin microhabitat use. Terrapin T-c differed significantly among months and creek and between sexes. Terrapin microhabitat use also varied monthly, with shallow mud temperature being the best predictor of T-c November-March and water temperature being the best predictor of T-c, April-October. Terrapins basked most frequently in spring and fall and males basked more frequently than females. Our study contributes to a fuller understanding of terrapin thermal biology and provides support for using dataloggers to investigate behavior and habitat use of aquatic ectotherms inhabiting dynamic environments.

However, knowledge on how temperature affects the oxidative stress response is unavailable for most species. This study investigated the effect of increasing temperature on lipid peroxidation, catalase activity, superoxide dismutase and glutathione-S-transferase in the shrimps, Palaemon elegans and Palaemon serratus. It was concluded that increasing temperatures significantly affect all the biomarkers tested in both species, with the exception of superoxide dismutase in P. serratus which was not affected by temperature. The oxidative stress response was more intense in P. elegans, than in P. serratus, producing higher peaks of all biomarkers at temperatures between 22 C-circle and 26 C-circle, followed by low levels at higher temperatures. It was concluded that monitoring of ecosystems using oxidative stress biomarkers should take into account the species and thermal history of the organisms. Sampling should be avoided during heat waves and immediately after heat waves. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Habituation of the metabolic and ventilatory responses to immersion in humans,"Tipton, Michael J. and Wakabayashi, Hitoshi and Barwood, Martin J. and Eglin, Clare M. and Mekjavic, Igor B. and Taylor, Nigel A. S.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"An experiment was undertaken to answer long-standing questions concerning the nature of metabolic habituation in repeatedly cooled humans. It was hypothesised that repeated skin and deep-body cooling would produce such a habituation that would be specific to the magnitude of the cooling experienced, and that skin cooling alone would dampen the cold-shock but not the metabolic response to cold-water immersion. Twenty-one male participants were divided into three groups, each of which completed two experimental immersions in 12 degrees C water, lasting until either rectal temperature fell to 35 degrees C or 90 min had elapsed. Between these two immersions, the control group avoided cold exposures, whilst two experimental groups completed five additional immersions (12 degrees C). One experimental group repeatedly immersed for 45 min in average, resulting in deep-body (1.18 degrees C) and skin temperature reductions. The immersions in the second experimental group were designed to result only in skin temperature reductions, and lasted only 5 min. Only the deep-body cooling group displayed a significantly blunted metabolic response during the second experimental immersion until rectal temperature decreased by 1.18 degrees C, but no habituation was observed when they were cooled further. The skin cooling group showed a significant habituation in the ventilatory response during the initial 5 min of the second experimental immersion, but no alteration in the metabolic response. It is concluded that repeated falls of skin and deep-body temperature can habituate the metabolic response, which shows tissue temperature specificity. However, skin temperature cooling only will lower the cold-shock response, but appears not to elicit an alteration in the metabolic response. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

R. and Hecksteden, Anne and Trajano, Gabriel S. and Minett, Geoffrey M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Intramuscular temperature kinetics can provide insightful information for exercise and environmental physiology research. However, currently, there are no consistent method descriptions or guidelines for muscle temperature assessment in the literature. Studies have reported a great variation in muscle temperature assessment, from 1.5 cm under the skin to 4 cm under the muscle fascia. Moreover, a large variation in body composition components among participants exacerbates this issue, changing the depth and the muscle to be tested. For instance, in young adults (25 +/- 5 yrs), the thigh subcutaneous fat thickness can vary from 0.11 to 1.69 cm, and vastus lateralis thickness from 1.62 to 3.38 cm; in older adults (68.5 +/- 3 yrs), subcutaneous fat thickness plus gastrocnemius medialis thickness can vary from 1.03 to 3.22 cm. This variation results in inconsistent resting muscle temperature profiles and muscle temperature kinetics during and after an exercise or environmental thermal stress interventions (hot or cold). Hence, one fixed size does not fit all. Standardization and consistency in muscle temperature assessment procedures across studies are required to allow a better understanding and translation of the influence of a given stressor (exercise or thermal) on muscle temperature kinetics. This methodological manuscript i) summarizes the differences in muscle temperature assessment procedures and techniques used across different studies, ii) discusses current concerns related to variations in intramuscular needle depth, and subcutaneous fat and muscle thickness when assessing muscle temperature, and iii) suggests a systematic and more robust approach, based on individual body composition characteristics, to be considered when assessing intramuscular temperature.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103925,124,NA,NA,103925,Muscle temperature; Ultrasound assessment; Fat thickness; Muscle thickness; Environmental physiology; Thermophysiology

This experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of heat stress on the feeding preference of yellow-feathered broilers and its possible mechanism. As a result, the preference of yellow-feathered broilers for Tenebrio molitor was significantly decreased, and the fear response and serum corticosterone of broilers were significantly increased when the ambient temperatures are 35 degrees C (P < 0.05). In the central nervous system, consistent with the change in feeding preference, decreased dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and increased mRNA levels of MAO-B in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and NAc were found in yellow-feathered broilers (P < 0.05). In addition, we found significantly increased mRNA levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1, corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 2 and glucocorticoid receptor in the VTA and NAc of female broilers (P < 0.05). However, no similar change was found in male broilers. On the other hand, the serum levels of insulin and glucagon-like peptide-1 were increased only in male broilers (P < 0.05). Accordingly, the mRNA levels of insulin receptor and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor in the VTA and the phosphorylation of mTOR and PI3K were increased only in male broilers (P < 0.05). In summary, the preference of yellow-feathered broilers for Tenebrio molitor feed decreased under heat stress conditions, and hedonic feeding behavior was significantly inhibited. However, the mechanism by which heat stress affects hedonic feeding behavior may contain gender differences. The insulin signaling pathway may participate in the regulation of heat stress on the male broiler reward system, while stress hormone-related receptors in the midbrain may play an important role in the effect of heat stress on the reward system of female broilers.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103959,124,NA,NA,103959,Heat stress; Yellow-feathered broiler; Feeding preference

article,Thermal preference of<i> Culicoides</i> biting midges in laboratory and semi-field settings,"Hochstrasser, Alec L. and Mathis, Alexander and Verhulst, Niels O.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Biting midges of the genus Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) are hematophagous insects, and some species can transmit a plethora of pathogens, e.g., bluetongue virus and African horse sickness virus, that mainly affect animals. The transmission of vector-borne pathogens is strongly temperature dependent, and recent studies pointed to the importance of including microclimatic data when modelling disease spread. However, little is known about the preferred temperature of biting midges. The present study addressed the thermal selection of field-caught Culicoides with two experiments. In a laboratory setup, sugar-fed or blood-fed midges were video tracked for 15 min while moving inside a 60 x 30 x 4 cm setup with a 15-25 degrees C temperature gradient. Culicoides spent over double the time in the coldest zone of the setup compared to the warmest one. This cold selection was significantly stronger for sugar-fed individuals. Calculated preferred temperatures were 18.3 degrees C and 18.9 degrees C for sugar-fed and blood-fed Culicoides, respectively. The effect of temperature on walking speed was significant but weak, indicating that their skewed distribution results from preference and not cold trapping. A second experiment consisted of a two-way-choice-setup, performed in a 90 x 45 x 45 cm net cage, placed outdoors in a sheltered environment. Two UV LED CDC traps were placed inside the setup, and a mean temperature difference of 2.2 degrees C was created between the two traps. Hundred-fifty Culicoides were released per experiment. Recapture rates were negatively correlated with ambient temperature and were on average three times higher in the cooled trap. The higher prevalence of biting midges in cooler environments influences fitness and ability to transmit pathogens and should be considered in models that predict Culicoides disease transmission.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103783,119,NA,NA,103783,Behaviour; Insect vectors; Microclimate; Temperature preference; Video analysis

Temperature-induced modifications to the development of body parts and sensory organs likely have functional consequences for adult behaviour. To date, we have little knowledge about the effect of sub-optimal temperature on the development and functional morphology of different body parts, particularly sensory organs, in ectothermic solitary pollinators such as butterflies. To address this knowledge gap, we exposed the pupae of the butterfly Pieris napi to either 23 degrees C or 32 degrees C and measured the subsequent effects on eclosion, body size and the development of the wings, proboscis, eyes and antennae. In comparison to individuals that developed at 23 degrees C, we found that exposure to 32 degrees C during the pupal stage increased mortality and decreased time to eclose. Furthermore, both female and male butterflies that developed at 32 degrees C were smaller and had shorter proboscides, while males had shorter antennae. In contrast, we found no significant effect of rearing temperature on wing and eye size or wing deformity. Our findings suggest that increasing global temperatures and its corresponding co-stressors, such as humidity, will impact the survival of butterflies by impairing eclosion and the proper development of body and sensory organs.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103721,118,NA,NA,103721,Developmental temperature; Sensory organs; Body parts; Mortality; Eclosion; Climate change
article,Wild white-capped noddies keep a cool head in a heated situation,"Lesku, John A. and Barker, Robert G. and Elmes, Hannah and Robert, Kylie A. and Tworkowski, Lauren and Dutka, Travis L.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Sunning, or sunbathing, is a behavior observed in diverse birds from at least 50 taxonomic families. While sunning, birds exhibit signs of heat stress, notably panting, indicating a risk of overheating. Given that even modest increases in brain temperature can impair brain function, sunning birds may have mechanisms that selectively cool the brain. Sunning birds could cool the brain using active physiological mechanisms (e.g., an ophthalmic rete or sleeping) or passive adaptations, such as light-colored plumage over the cranium. Whitecapped noddies are tropical seabirds that sunbathe in direct sunlight on cloudless days. Using infrared thermography on wild birds, we found that the white cap is 20 degrees C cooler than that of the black back while sunning. A deceased bird showed the same thermal profile, indicating that this difference arises from dichromatic coloration and not underlying physiology. Thus, the white cap may extend the duration of time noddies can sunbathe and keep the brain cool, near core body temperature, while allowing the rest of the body to heat up, perhaps to displace or kill parasites.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103754,118,NA,NA,103754,Coloration; Dichromatism; Infrared thermography; Sunbathing; Thermoregulation; Tropics

Measuring the inner eye canthus (Tco) temperature is a method proposed to identify core temperature, but it has shown little concordance in physical exercise situations and has not yet been used in studies with measurements taken throughout the day. The objective of this study was to compare the measurements and daily behavior of Tco obtained by infrared thermography with rectal temperature (Tre) during a prolonged waking protocol. Eleven male individuals participated in the study, who remained in the laboratory for at least 38 h using an actigraph to determine the wakefulness time and were monitored during the entire period. The Tre and Tco measurements were performed every 3 h. The ANOVA was used for repeated measurements followed by Bonferroni's post-hoc test to find the limits of concordance/proximity, while the Bland and Altman method and the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient were used to establish the reliability between the pairs. The significance level adopted was p < 0.05. The results demonstrate significant differences, low levels of concordance and unsatisfactory reliability levels between Tco and Tre at all 13 analyzed moments, in addition to not showing measurement reliability when all data are used together with the 143 temperature measurements. Daily behavior analysis shows moments with similar behavior with an increase in Tco and Tre, but at other times the behavior was the opposite, with a decrease in one measurement and an increase in the other. Based on the results presented, it is not recommended to use the inner eye canthus temperature as a substitute for rectal temperature for measuring core temperature at different times of the day or in sleep-deprived individuals.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103716,117,NA,NA,103716,Thermography; Face; Thermometry; Rectal temperature; Thermal imaging; Wakefulness
article,Key parameters of physiological responses to acute heat stress in two commercial layers determined by Fisher discriminant analyses,"Wu, Xiaohui and Zheng, Bin and Mei, Zi and Yu, Chengzhi and Song, Zhenquan and Sheng, Zheya and Gong, Yanzhang",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Given the escalating global warming and the intense nature of modern poultry production, layers are becoming increasingly susceptible to heat stress. This stress disrupts the physiological processes of layers, which leads to reduced productivity and welfare. To address this issue, it is crucial to first evaluate the stress response systematically. However, such evaluations are still lacking in this field. The objective of this study was to accurately monitor the impact of thermal stress and identify common and key indicators that would support decisionmaking to maintain layer welfare and productivity under stress. We constructed two heat stress models to reflect moderate (32 degrees C) to severe (36 degrees C) stress effects and obtained a comprehensive profile of blood physiological parameters associated with the layers' responses to heat stress. We found that genetic differences had limited influence on their physiological responses to heat stress after 32 degrees C heat challenges. Using 8 selected and significantly changed parameters, layers' physiological status under heat stress could be accurately determined (judgmental accuracy of 98\%). As ambient temperature increased to 36 degrees C, birds suffered more severe challenges that parameters changed in larger percentages. Additionally, breed variations of the physiological responses became apparent, a Fisher discriminant function based on 5 selected parameters could distinguish heat stress effects at 32 degrees C or 36 degrees C with 80\% accuracy. The results obtained from this study provide two discriminant models for assessing heat stress and shed lights on developing effective and widely applicable heat stress mitigation strategies targeting these indicators.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103694,117,NA,NA,103694,Heat stress models; Physiological responses; Key indicators; Fisher discriminant models

Biophysical models that explicitly link organismal functional traits like morphology, physiology, and behavior to environmental conditions can provide valuable insight into de-terminants of thermal and hydric stress. Here we use a combination of direct measurements, 3D modeling, and computational fluid dynamics to develop a detailed biophysical model of the sand fiddler crab, Leptuca pugilator. We compare the detailed model's performance to a model using a simpler ellipsoidal approximation of a crab. The detailed model predicted crab body temperatures within 1 degrees C of observed in both laboratory and field settings; the ellipsoidal approximation model predicted body temperatures within 2 degrees C of observed body tem-peratures. Model predictions are meaningfully improved through efforts to incorporate species-specific morphological properties rather than relying on simple geometric approximations. Experimental evaporative water loss (EWL) measurements indicate that L. pugilator can modify its permeability to EWL as a function of vapor density gradients, providing novel insight into physiological thermoregulation in the species. Body tem-perature and EWL predictions made over the course of a year at a single site demonstrate how such biophysical models can be used to explore mechanistic drivers and spatiotemporal patterns of thermal and hydric stress, providing insight into current and future distributions in the face of climate change.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103613,115,NA,NA,103613,Biophysical model; Leptuca pugilator; Fiddler crab; Niche mapper; Thermoregulation; Water loss
article,Thermal tolerance limits and physiological traits as indicators of<i> Hediste</i><i> diversicolor's</i> acclimation capacity to global and local change drivers,"Fernandes, Joana Filipa and Calado, Ricardo and Jeronimo, Daniel and Madeira, Diana",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Global projections predict significant increases in ocean temperature and changes in ocean chemistry, including salinity variations by 2100. This has led to a substantial interest in the study of thermal ecophysiology, as temperature is a major factor shaping marine ectotherm communities. However, responses to temperature may be influenced by other factors such as salinity, highlighting the relevance of multiple stressor studies. In the present work, we experimentally evaluated the thermal tolerance of the marine ragworm Hediste diversicolor under predicted global change scenarios. Organisms were subjected to an experimental trial under control (24 degrees C), and two temperature treatment scenarios (ocean warming +3 degrees C - (27 degrees C) and heat wave +6 degrees C - (30 degrees C)), combined with salinity variations (20 and 30) in a full factorial design for 29 days. Environmental data from the field were collected during 2019 and 2020. At day 30 post exposure, upper thermal limits (Critical Thermal Maximum -CTMax), thermal safety margins (TSM) and acclimation capacity were measured. Higher acclimation temperatures led to higher thermal tolerance limits, confirming that H. diversicolor features some physiological plasticity, acclimation capacity and a positive thermal safety margin. This margin was greater considering in situ temperature data from 2019 than maximum temperatures for 2020 (CTMax > maximum habitat temperature-MHT). Moreover, smaller organisms displayed higher upper thermal limits suggesting that thermal tolerance is size dependent. Ragworms subjected to higher salinity also showed a higher CTMax than those acclimated to lower salinity. However, temperature and salinity showed an additive effect on CTMax, as no significant interaction was detected. We conclude that H. diversicolor can easily acclimate to increased water temperature, independently of salinity variations. Given the key role of ragworms in food webs in estuaries and coastal lagoons, substrate bioturbation and aquaculture, this information is relevant to support conservation actions, optimize culture protocols and identify thermal resistant strains.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103577,114,NA,NA,103577,Multiple stressors; Polychaete; Ocean warming; Physiology; Critical thermal maximum

The impacts of winter hot and cold step changes on subjective votes and skin temperatures are evaluated. Further, the OTS{*} and OTC{*} values are calculated, and their accuracy under different model combinations is analyzed. The results reveal that thermal sensation changes in human body exhibit distinct asymmetry under the cold and hot step-changes, except for the cycle of ``15-30-15 degrees C{''} (I15).

We conducted laboratory experiments based on different acclimation temperatures to determine the thermal tolerance in male specimens of the freshwater prawn Cryphiops caementarius. During 30 days, male prawns were exposed to acclimation temperatures of 19 degrees C (control), 24 degrees C, and 28 degrees C treatments. The Critical Thermal Maxima (CTMax) values at these acclimation temperatures were 33.42 degrees C, 34.92 degrees C, and 36.80 degrees C; whereas values for the Critical Thermal Minimum (CTMin) were 9.38 degrees C, 10.57 degrees C, and 13.88 degrees C. All acclimation temperature treatments had a positive effect (P < 0.05) on CTMax and CTMin, with high and significant correlations (CTMax: r = 0.992, P < 0.01; CTMin: r = 0.946, P < 0.01). The area of the thermal tolerance polygon over the three acclimation temperatures was 211.32 <degrees>C2 and the acclimation response rate values were high (CTMax from 0.30 to 0.47; CTMin from 0.24 to 0.83) but similar to those from other tropical crustacean species.

article,"Effect of temperature on the post-diapause developmental rate, survival, and body mass of the solitary wasp<i> Isodontia</i><i> elegans:</i> Implications for rearing of trap-nesting Hymenoptera","O'Neill, Kevin M. and Delphia, Casey M. and Spendal, Ronald C.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"We examined the relationship of post-diapause rearing temperature to developmental rate, survival, and adult body mass of the solitary wasp Isodontia elegans using prepupae from trap-nests. Isodontia elegans is a member of a genus often found in trap-nests in North America and Europe. Trap-nests are commonly used tools for studying cavity-nesting solitary wasps and bees. In temperate zones, progeny in nests usually overwinter as prepupae before pupating and emerging as adults. An important aspect of properly using trap-nests is determining tem-peratures that affect survival and health of developing offspring. After overwintering >600 cocoons containing prepupae after the summers of 2015 and 2016, we placed cocoons on a laboratory thermal gradient where offspring experienced one of 19 constant temperatures from 6 to 43 degrees C; emergence of adults was monitored for 100 days. Our conservative estimate for the critical thermal minimum for development is 14 degrees C, whereas that for the critical maximum is-33 degrees C. Prepupae transitioned to adults most rapidly at 29-33 degrees C, but developmental rate was lower for some progeny exposed to temperatures >= 30 degrees C. Offspring successfully reached the adult stage in <100 days at of temperatures of-19-33 degrees C. Adults from cocoons reared at lower temperatures weighed on average 6-10\% more than expected based on their head widths, whereas those reared at higher temperatures weighed 4-10\% less than expected. The difference may be due to greater rates of water loss and lipid metabolism during development at higher temperatures. Pre-overwintering cocoon mass was a significant predictor of relative adult body mass, indicating that adult health is partly related to their condition before overwintering. The trends we observed were similar to those for the bee Megachile rotundata, which we previously studied on the same gradient apparatus. However, data is needed on many other species of wasps and bees from a diversity of environments.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103516,113,NA,NA,103516,Body mass; Briere-1 model; Pre-pupae; Thermal gradient; Trap-nest

The rosy apple aphid Dysaphis plantaginea is one of the most problematic pests of apple or-chards, causing economic losses of up to 30\% due to damage to fruits. Dysaphis plantaginea is highly adapted to low temperature, enabling it to appear early in the season. This study aimed at evaluating the critical thermal minimum of D. plantaginea and of two parasitoid species: Aphidius matricariae and Ephedrus cerasicola. For the generalist parasitoid A. matricariae we also evaluated the fitness traits of flight, walking, and oviposition, at four temperatures: 20, 15, 10 and 8 degrees C. We found that both males and females did not fly at the two lowest tem-peratures. Walking, parasitism rate and sex ratio (proportion of female progeny) were reduced at 8 degrees C. In addition, the parasitism rate was significantly lower at 8 and 10 degrees C compared to 15 and 20 degrees C. The progeny emerging from the oviposition experiment at 8 degrees C were significantly larger compared with other temperatures, possibly attributed to longer development time. The fact that the parasitoids were unable to fly at 8 and 10 degrees C, in combination with a more male-biased sex ratio, could reduce their efficiency at low temperature, even though they may still be able to walk and parasitize aphids.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103377,110,NA,NA,103377,Adaptation; Temperature-size rule; Female proportion; Trade-off
article,Rewarming rates of seven insectivorous bat species along an altitudinal gradient in South Africa,"Marsden, Genevieve E. and Schoeman, M. Corrie and Vosloo, Dalene",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Small endotherms commonly use daily torpor to maintain energetic homeostasis. During daily torpor, rewarming rates have a large impact on overall energy savings because they influence heat loss in this energetically costly phase of torpor. These rates are affected by both intrinsic and extrinsic ecological factors; however, data on rewarming rates along temporal and spatial scales between and within species are scant. We investigated how seven insectivorous bat species differing in body size and thermal stability of preferred roosts vary in rewarming rates along an altitude gradient (0-1400 m.a.s.l.) in South Africa, predicting that rewarming rates would increase with altitude. We kept individuals overnight at 15 degrees C and monitored their surface temperature during induced rewarming with infrared thermal imaging to calculate rewarming rates. In contrast to our prediction, we found no significant variation between species or altitudes despite differences in body mass and life history traits. However, we did find evidence that males rewarmed more rapidly than females at low temperatures despite the higher energetic cost of slow rewarming, possibly due to reluctance of females to initiate active rewarming at low ambient temperatures. We found some support for the prediction that cool temperatures at high altitude result lower initial surface temperatures during cold-exposure, as an adaptation to mitigate heat loss through thermal conductance to the ambient environment. This is particularly important for small insectivorous bats given their high surface area to volume ratios.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103341,110,NA,NA,103341,Rewarming rate; Torpor; Chiroptera; Body mass; Altitude

The aims of this study were (i) to determine the variations in skin temperature (Tsk) of the lower limbs after an effort of auxotonic and isometric squat contractions using infrared thermography and (ii) to study jumping performance variations in handball players after those two different contraction types. A total of 15 national level handball players voluntarily participated in the study (age: 23.20 \& PLUSMN; 5.23 years). Two types of protocols - isometric and auxotonic - were performed on different days, having previously calculated the maximal isometric squat strength and auxotonic 1RM. During the data collection, participants performed a specific standardized warm-up and then randomly performed 4x10 repetitions of auxotonic squat to 90 of knee flexion at 70\% of 1RM and 4x10 s of isometric squat effort at 90 of knee flexion, at 70\% of maximal isometric squat strength (both with a passive recovery of 90 s seated). Rate of perceived exertion (RPE) and counter-movement jumping performance (CMJ) were measured before and immediately after efforts. Additionally, infrared thermography data from twelve regions of interest of the lower limbs were registered before, imme-diately after and 15 min after finishing the effort. The main results indicated no significant differences for RPE (p = 0.486), CMJ vertical height (VH; p = 0.344) and Tsk (p > 0.05) in any of the regions of interest after protocols.

B. and Rong, L. and Huang, T. and Zhang, G.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Global warming combined with increased production (i.e. more piglets, more milk and consequently more heat) means that sows are more often challenged by heat stress. The objective was to develop an effective temperature (ET) equation to predict how air temperature, velocity and humidity affect the respiration rate (RR), rectal temperature (RT) and skin temperature (ST) as an expression of heat stress in gestating sows in order to elucidate the relationship between the thermal parameters and the sows' perception of the environment. The experimental room was equipped with a negative pressure ventilation system with diffuse air inlet through the ceiling, electrical heaters, steam generators and dehumidifiers. An air distribution unit was constructed to generate vertical air velocity. A total of 16 gestating sows were exposed to three temperatures (25 degrees C, 29 degrees C and 33 degrees C), two levels of relative humidity (30\% and 70\%) and three levels of air velocity (0.2 ms(-1), 1 ms(-1) and 2.5 ms(-1)). The RR, RT and ST were recorded every 30 min throughout the three 2-h test periods. The estimated effects of humidity and velocity in relation to effect of temperature was nearly independent of whether it was determined from RR or RT, whereas the effect of humidity was much smaller when determined from ST. High coefficients of determination (>0.97) were found for the second order relationship between the estimated ET and RR, RT and ST. An increase in relative humidity from 50 to 70\% corresponded to an increase in ET of 0.9 degrees C, while an increase in air velocity from 0.2 to 1.0 ms(-1) corresponded to a decrease in ET of 1.2 degrees C. The applied ET equation was useful for expressing the combined effect of temperature, humidity and velocity on animals exposed to heat stress.

article,Gender differences in thermal responses to temperature ramps in moderate environments,"Zhang, Shuai and Zhu, Neng",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Some studies revealed that steady-uniform thermal environments are not the optimal environmental state to ensure thermal comfort, and temperature ramps offer potential advantages over traditional air conditioning methods. Moreover, when exposed to the same environmental conditions, gender differences in thermal responses were often observed, but the gender differences in the ramped conditions and causal relationships remain unclear. Therefore, an experimental research was conducted in a chamber by controlling the rates and directions to study the gender differences in thermal responses to temperature ramps. Three temperature ramps conditions (A: 26 degrees C-24 degrees C-26 degrees C; B: 26 degrees C-28 degrees C-26 degrees C; C: 26 degrees C-30 degrees C-26 degrees C) were investigated with 60 healthy participants (30 females and 30 males) recruited. The main conclusions indicated that women are more sensitive to temperature ramp-down environments than those of their male counterparts. Direction of temperature ramps had a significant effect on human responses in cool environments but no effect was observed in warm environments. Moreover, there was no significant differences in subjective responses between genders in a 2 degrees C ramp-up environment from 26 degrees C to 28 degrees C. Due to psychological differences, men have a wider range of temperature acceptability than women. Furthermore, the relationships between thermal sensation and thermal comfort, thermal sensation and thermal acceptability were also established, indicating that thermal sensation had significant impacts on other psychological responses.

article,Nest site selection in a southern and northern population of the velvet gecko (Amalosia lesueurii),"Cuartas-Villa, Santiago and Webb, Jonathan K.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In many oviparous reptiles, thermal conditions inside nests influence phenotypic traits of hatchlings that are linked to survival. Maternal nest-site selection can therefore have long-term implications for offspring and maternal fitness. We studied nest-site selection in a nocturnal lizard (Amalosia lesueurii) from south eastern Australia. Females of this species lay their eggs communally inside rock crevices, and previous studies have shown that maximum daily nest temperatures are positively correlated with maximum daily air temperatures. The incubation period extends for up to 100 d, so during hot summers, embryos may be exposed to stressful thermal conditions. Potentially, mothers could buffer their eggs from thermal extremes via careful selection of nest sites. To evaluate this, we studied nest site selection in a southern population (Morton) and a northern population (Yengo) that experience mild and hot summers respectively. In the field, we measured the physical characteristics, orientation, canopy cover and incident radiation load, and thermal regimes of nest sites and randomly available crevices during one of the hottest Australian summers on record (2018-2019). We found strong inter population differences in the degree of canopy cover and solar radiation loads above nest sites. Nest sites from Morton were more open, and received higher radiation loads, than nest sites from Yengo. Mean nest temperatures were similar in Morton and Yengo, but nests from Yengo experienced higher daily temperatures than those from Morton. During heatwaves, temperatures in some nests exceeded the species critical thermal maximum (39.9 degrees C) for several hours each day. Our results show that females can adjust nest-site choice to match local environments, but future research is necessary to clarify whether exposure to high temperatures influences hatching success or offspring phenotypes in this species.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103121,102,NA,NA,103121,Nest-site selection; Reptile; Nest temperature; Incubation; Heatwaves
article,Genetic variation in the heat-stress survival of embryos is largely decoupled from adult thermotolerance in an intercontinental set of recombinant lines of Drosophila melanogaster,"Borda, Miguel A. and Gomez, Federico H. and Sambucetti, Pablo and Norry, Fabian M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In insects, thermal adaptation works on the genetic variation for thermotolerance of not only larvae and adults but also of the immobile stages of the life cycle including eggs. In contrast to adults and larvae, the genetic basis for thermal adaptation in embryos (eggs) remains to be tested in the model insect Drosophila melanogaster. Quantitative-trait loci (QTL) for heat-stress resistance in embryos could largely differ from previously identified QTL for larvae and adults. Here we used an intercontinental set of recombinant inbred lines (RIL), which were previously used to identify thermotolerance-QTLs in adults and larvae because of their high variation segregating for adult thermotolerance. Eggs appeared to be more heat resistant than larvae and adults from previous studies on these RIL, though different heat-shock assays were used in previous studies. We found that variation in thermotolerance in embryos can be, at least partially, genetically decoupled from thermotolerance in the adult insect. Some RIL that are heat resistant in the adult and larvae can be heat susceptible in embryos. Only one small-effect QTL out of five autosomal QTL co-localized between embryo and other ontogenetic stages. These results suggest that selection for thermal adaptation in adult flies and larvae is predicted to have only a small impact on embryo thermotolerance.

Moreover, the typical combined stress points at AC + WD3h, AC + WD6h and AC + WD9h were assigned for exploring the immunological and antioxidative responses. For immunity response, the total hemocyte counts (THC) decreased with the prolongation of duration time and the activities of non-specific immunity enzymes such as phenol oxidase (PO), acid phosphatase (ACP), alkaline phosphatase (AKP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) were significantly elevated in AC + WD9h groups (P < 0.05). Moreover, compared with that in NC group, the significant accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was observed in AC group and then reduced in combined stress groups (P < 0.05), with the highest level of malonaldehyde (MDA) in AC and AC + WD3h groups. Overall, the significant elevation of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) was detected in AC + WD9h group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the accumulative pathological impairment on hepatopancreas tissue revealed the cytoskeleton degradation. In addition, correlation analyses visualized the correlation between oxidative stress and biochemical response. This study not only deepens our understanding on the biochemical mechanism of shrimp mortality induced by combined stress, but also provides a potential strategy for improving the management of L. vannamei during live transport.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103080,100,NA,NA,103080,L. vannamei; Live waterless transport; Oxidative stress; Antioxidative and immunological response; Pathological impairment

E. and Negm, Samar S. and Abd El-hameed, Samah A. A. and Abdel-Latif, Hany M. R.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"A 56-day feeding experiment was carried out to investigate the influences of dietary organic selenium (OS) on the growth, body composition, serum biochemistry, stress responses, and immune indices of Nile tilapia reared under sub-optimal temperature. Fish (5.61 +/- 0.5 g) were allotted in seven experimental groups (5 replicates per each) and fed on a basal diet supplemented with 0.0 (CTR), 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 mg OS/kg diet and reared under temperature ranged 21.50 +/- 0.50 degrees C. Final body weight, weight gain, and specific growth rate were significantly increased in OS groups compared to the CTR group. Moreover, the feed conversion ratio was significantly decreased in OS groups, especially at fish groups fed 0.3-0.6 mg OS/kg diet compared to the other groups. The lowest survival rate (\%) was found in OS groups between 0.0 and 0.2 mg/kg diet. A significant increase in the crude protein (\%) and dry matter (\%) in OS groups alongside a significant decrease in the ash (\%) compared to the CTR group. Blood proteins (total protein, albumin, and globulin), reduced glutathione, immunoglobulin M, and complement C3 values alongside the serum lysozyme and catalase activities were significantly increased compared to the CTR group. Contrarywise, serum transaminases (alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase), cortisol, urea, and creatinine values were significantly decreased in OS groups than the CTR group. No significant differences were noticed in the mRNA transcripts of the hepatic heat shock protein 70 among all experimental groups. Meanwhile, significant differences were observed in the mRNA transcripts of hepatic heat shock protein 27, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase genes among all experimental groups. The second order polynomial regressions illustrated that the optimal inclusion OS level in diets for Nile tilapia reared under sub-optimal temperature is 0.36-0.39 mg/kg diet based on weight gain and cortisol levels, respectively.

Methods: In thirty young adults (21 +/- 3 years, 15 females), cutaneous vascular conductance, normalized to maximum local skin heating at 44 degrees C (\%CVCmax), was assessed at the upper chest, abdomen, dorsal arm, dorsal forearm, thigh, and medial calf during rapid (33-42 degrees C at 1 degrees C.20 s(-1)) and gradual (33-42 degrees C at 1 degrees C.5 min(-1)) LTH on separate days. For both protocols, local temperatures were held at 42 degrees C for up to 35 min, followed by 20-30 min at 44 degrees C. During rapid LTH, between-region responses were evaluated at baseline, the initial vasodilator peak, and 42 degrees C plateau. During gradual LTH, responses were assessed at baseline and the 42 degrees C plateau. Results: There were significant main effects of body region on \%CVCmax for the initial peak and plateau during rapid LTH and for the plateau during gradual LTH (all P < 0.001) Conversely, main effects of sex and the sex by region interaction were not significant (all P > 0.05). The magnitudes of between-region differences varied across the body (similar to 1-17\% range). The greatest effects were observed for the abdomen, wherein responses were consistently lower compared to other regions. Further, responses were consistent between males and females across all body regions and heating phases.

article,Are extreme high temperatures at low or high latitudes more likely to inhibit the population growth of a globally distributed aphid?,"Ma, Gang and Hoffmann, Ary A. and Ma, Chun-Sen",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Although climate warming can increase both mean temperature and its variability, it is often the effects of climate warming on short periods of extreme temperatures that are expected to have particularly large physiological and ecological consequences. Understanding the vulnerability of organisms at various latitudes to climate extremes is thus critical for understanding warming effects on regional biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management. While previous studies have shown that thermal responses depend on temperature regimes that organisms have previously experienced, this issue has not been considered much when comparing the effects of temperature extremes at different latitudes. To fill this gap, here we manipulated different combinations of amplitude and duration of daily high temperature extremes to simulate conditions at different latitudes. We tested the effects of those regimes on life-history traits and fitness of a globally-distributed aphid species, Rhopalosiphum padi. We compared our results with previous studies to better understand the extent to which these regimes affect conclusions based on comparisons under different mean temperatures. As a consequence of asymmetrical thermal performance curves, we hypothesized that the temperature regimes with higher daily maximum temperatures at higher latitudes would cause strong negative effects. Our results showed that these regimes with thermal extremes caused substantial decreases in life-history traits and fitness relative to the predictions from different mean temperatures. Specifically, the regime with higher daily maximum temperature reflecting a higher mid-latitude location had larger impacts on development, reproduction and population fitness than the regime representing a lower mid-latitude location. These findings have implications for understanding the vulnerability of organisms across latitudes to increasingly frequent extreme heat events under ongoing climate warming.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102936,98,NA,NA,102936,Climate warming; Thermal extreme; Latitudinal gradient; Life-history trait; Fitness; Rhopalosiphum padi

We studied resistance to lethal hypoxia (3.5\% oxygen content) in rats under PT. To initiate PT, we used the previously developed pharmacological composition (PC) which, after a single intravenous injection, can induce a daily decrease in T-b by 7.C-8 degrees C at the environmental temperature of 22 degrees C-23 degrees C. Half-survival (median) time of rats in lethal hypoxia was found to increase from 5 +/- 0.8 min in anesthetized control rats to 150 +/- 12 min in rats injected with PC, which is a 30-fold increase. Behavioral tests after PT and hypoxia, including the traveling distance, the number of rearing and grooming episodes, revealed that animal responses are significantly restored within a week. It is assumed that the discovered unprecedented resistance of artificially torpid rats to lethal hypoxia may open up broad prospects for the therapeutic use of PT for preconditioning to various damaging factors, treatment of diseases, and extend the so-called ``golden hour{''} for lifesaving interventions.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102906,98,NA,NA,102906,Torpor; Hibernation; Hypoxia; Hypothermia; Survival; Golden hour
article,Bat thermoregulation in the heat: Limits to evaporative cooling capacity in three southern African bats,"Czenze, Z. J. and Naidoo, S. and Kotze, A. and McKechnie, A. E.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"High environmental temperatures pose significant physiological challenges related to energy and water balance for small endotherms. Although there is a growing literature on the effect of high temperatures on birds, comparable data are scarcer for bats. Those data that do exist suggest that roost microsite may predict tolerance of high air temperatures. To examine this possibility further, we quantified the upper limits to heat tolerance and evaporative cooling capacity in three southern African bat species inhabiting the same hot environment but using different roost types (crevice, foliage or cave). We used flow-through respirometry and compared heat tolerance limits (highest air temperature (T-a) tolerated before the onset of severe hyperthermia), body temperature (T-b), evaporative water loss, metabolic rate, and maximum cooling capacity (i.e., evaporative heat loss/metabolic heat production). Heat tolerance limits for the two bats roosting in more exposed sites, Taphozous mauritianus (foliage-roosting) and Eptesicus hottentotus (crevice-roosting), were T-a = similar to 44 degrees C and those individuals defended maximum T-b between 41 degrees C and 43 degrees C. The heat tolerance limit for the bat roosting in a more buffered site, Rousettus aegyptiacus (cave-roosting), was T-a = similar to 38 degrees C with a corresponding T-b of similar to 38 degrees C. These interspecific differences, together with a similar trend for higher evaporative cooling efficiency in species occupying warmer roost microsites, add further support to the notion that ecological factors like roost choice may have profound influences on physiological traits related to thermoregulation.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102542,89,NA,NA,102542,Heat tolerance; Bats; Body temperature; Evaporative water loss; Resting metabolic rate

This work evaluated techniques to monitor the body temperature of beef cattle kept on pasture and their ability to predict internal temperature. Twenty-three adult bovine females were monitored for six months, and collection data carried out in eleven campaigns (D0-D10) twelve days apart. During collections, the surface temperatures of ear base (ET, degrees C) and ocular globe (OGT, degrees C) were measured by infrared thermography, and the subcutaneous temperature (ST, degrees C) was measured with the use of transponder containing an implantable microchip. Rectal temperature (RT, degrees C) was considered as a reference for body temperature. Temperature and Humidity Index (THI), Black Globe Temperature and Humidity Index (BGHI) and Radiant Heat Load (RHL, W/m(2)) were calculated. ET (33.32 +/- 0.12 degrees C), ST (36.10 +/- 0.07 degrees C), OGT (37.40 +/- 0.06 degrees C) and RT (38.83 +/- 0.03 degrees C) differed significantly (P<0.05). There was positive correlation of RT with OGT (r = 0.392), ET (r = 0.264) and ST (r = 0.236) (P<0.05).

We found that febrile response was significantly augmented in the animals pre-treated with turpentine compared to control rats (pre-treated with saline), and that observed excessive elevation of body temperature (Tb) was accompanied by enhanced release of fever mediators: interleukin-6 (IL-6) and prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) into plasma. Moreover, we found that sensitization to pyrogenic effects of lipopolysaccharide was associated with the increase in plasma level of high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), one of the best-known damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMP), which was recently discovered as inflammatory mediator.

However, the response of animal communities to forest regeneration is poorly understood. To evaluate support for thermal quality as a mechanism driving reptile species distributions during secondary forest succession, we measured operative temperatures and occupancy in three successional forest stages (pasture, secondary forest, and old growth forest) for two anole species common in the landscape (Norops humilis and Norops limifrons). We then measured thermal preference in laboratory experiments and used operative temperature and temperature preference measurements to determine how thermal quality of habitat changes over the course of secondary forest succession, and if occupancy varies as a function of thermal quality. We found that thermal quality was lowest in pasture habitat because of a large frequency of temperatures above the thermal preference range. However, in low thermal quality pasture sites, riparian habitats and remnant trees provided a thermal refuge for both lizard species. Our results support thermal quality as a mechanism for reptile species distributions in altered landscapes and highlight the importance of the maintenance of riparian corridors.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.05.007,75,NA,54-61,NA,Ectotherm; Habitat quality; Lizard; Occupancy modeling; Operative temperature; Riparian corridors
article,An experimental test of effects of ambient temperature and roost quality on aggregation by little brown bats (<i>Myotis lucifugus</i>),"Webber, Quinn M. R. and Willis, Craig K. R.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Environmental factors, such as ambient temperature (T-a) or roost/nest quality, can influence social behaviour of small-bodied endotherms because individuals may aggregate for social thermoregulation when T-a is low or select the warmest possible sites for roosting. Female temperate bats form maternity colonies in spring to communally raise pups and exploit social thermoregulation. They also select roosts with warm microclimates because low roost temperature (T-roost) delays juvenile development. We studied captive female little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) to test the hypothesis that variation in T-a and T-roost influence social group size. First, we predicted that female bats would preferentially select artificially heated roosts over unheated roosts. Second, we predicted that, as T-a decreased, group size would increase because bats would rely more heavily on social thermoregulation. Third, we predicted that experimentally increasing T-roost (i.e., roost quality) above T-a would result in larger group sizes due to greater aggregation in high quality roosts. We captured 34 females from a maternity colony and housed them in a flight-tent provisioned with four bat boxes. Each box was outfitted with a heating pad and thermostat. Over the course of eight-days we heated each roost box in sequence to near thermoneutral T-roost for two days. Bats preferentially selected heated roosts over unheated roosts but, contrary to our prediction, group size decreased when T-roost was much greater than T-a (i.e., when the benefits of a warm roost should have been highest). Our results suggest that social thermoregulation and the availability of warm roosts influence aggregation in bats and have implications for the potential of summer habitat protection and enhancement to help bat populations in the face of threats like white-nose syndrome.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.03.023,74,NA,174-180,NA,Chiroptera; Energetics; Microclimate; Roost selection; Social thermoregulation; White-nose syndrome
article,Temperature-dependent development of diapausing larvae of <i>Chilo partellus</i> (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae),"Dhillon, Mukesh K. and Hasan, Fazil",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature-dependent development rate, percent diapause induction (hibernation at low temperature and aestivation at high temperature), and survival of diapausing larvae of Chilo partellus (Swinhoe, 1885) were examined on 13 constant temperatures ranging from 8 to 40 degrees C. Development of hibernating and aestivating larvae occurred from 10 to 25 degrees C and 27-38 degrees C, respectively. However, no development occurred at 8 degrees C and 40 degrees C. To determine actual thermal conditions that affect development and trigger both kind of diapause (hibernation and aestivation), various thermal parameters were estimated by fitting the development rate data to two linear (Ordinary equation and Ikemoto \& Takai) models and thirteen non-linear models. The lower thermal thresholds (Trai) for development of diapausing larvae of C. partellus were calculated as 9.60 degrees C and 10.29 degrees C using the ordinary linear model and Ikemoto \& Takai model, respectively. Similarly, the thermal constants (K) estimated using the ordinary linear model was 333.33 degree-days and that estimated with Ikemoto \& Takai model was 338.92 degree-days. Among the non-linear models, Lactin-2 followed by Lactin-1 were found to be the best as these models estimated the critical temperatures (T-min, T-mix, and T-opt) similar to those of observed values. Conclusively, the Ikemoto \& Takai linear model and Lactin-2 followed by Lactin-1 non-linear models are useful and efficient for describing temperature-dependent development and estimating the temperature thresholds of diapausing larvae of C. partellus. Our findings provided fundamental information for estimation of thermal requirement and temperature based development models for diapausing larvae of C. partellus.

article,"Effects of environmental variables on surface temperature of breeding adult female northern elephant seals, <i>Mirounga angustirostris</i>, and pups","Codde, Sarah A. and Allen, Sarah G. and Houser, Dorian S. and Crocker, Daniel E.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Pinnipeds spend extended periods of time on shore during breeding, and some temperate species retreat to the water if exposed to high ambient temperatures. However, female northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) with pups generally avoid the water, presumably to minimize risks to pups or male harassment. Little is known about how ambient temperature affects thermoregulation of well insulated females while on shore. We used a thermographic camera to measure surface temperature (T-s) of 100 adult female elephant seals and their pups during the breeding season at Point Reyes National Seashore, yielding 782 thermograms. Environmental variables were measured by an onsite weather station. Environmental variables, especially solar radiation and ambient temperature, were the main determinants of mean and maximum T-s of both females and pups. An average of 16\% of the visible surface of both females and pups was used as thermal windows to facilitate heat loss and, for pups, this area increased with solar radiation. Thermal window area of females increased with mean T-s until approximately 26 degrees C and then declined. The T-s of both age classes were warmer than ambient temperature and had a large thermal gradient with the environment (female mean 11.2 +/- 0.2 degrees C; pup mean 14.2 +/- 0.2 degrees C). This large gradient suggests that circulatory adjustments to bypass blubber layers were sufficient to allow seals to dissipate heat under most environmental conditions. We observed the previously undescribed behavior of females and pups in the water and determined that solar radiation affected this behavior. This may have been possible due to the calm waters at the study site, which reduced the risk of neonates drowning. These results may predict important breeding habitat features for elephant seals as solar radiation and ambient temperatures change in response to changing climate.

article,"The impact of geographical origin of two strains of the herbivore, <i>Eccritotarsus catarinensis</i>, on several fitness traits in response to temperature","Ismail, Mohannad and Brooks, Margot",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Adaptation to temperature changes is vital to reduce adverse effects on individuals, and some may present phenotypic changes, which might be accompanied with physiological costs in fitness traits. The objective of this study was to determine whether the two strains Of the herbivore Eccritotarsus catarinensis, a biological control agent against water hyacinth in South Africa, differ in their responses to temperature according to their geographical origin. We experimentally quantified the responses of the two strains, at three constant temperatures: 20 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C, using laboratory cultures that originated from Brazil and Peru, where climates differ. Reproductive output, egg hatching rate, sex ratio and longevity were recorded at each temperature. Fitness traits for both strains were significantly reduced at 30 degrees C compared with 25 degrees C and 20 degrees C in two successive generations. Nonetheless, Peruvian individuals continued their development at 30 degrees C, whereas Brazilian individuals that succeeded in emerging did not continue their development. In contrast, sex ratio was unaffected by temperature. The Peruvian strain of E. catarinensis presented different phenotypes depending on temperature and was more adapted to extreme high temperature than the Brazilian strain. The tropical origin of the population induces the insect to tolerate the extreme high temperature. We suggest that the Peruvian strain could be better suited for release to control water hyacinth in nature, particularly in regions where temperature is high. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Profiling the dynamic variations in body and scrotal surface temperatures of goats reared under stressful conditions using infrared thermography: Analytical perspectives,"Samara, Emad M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Infrared thermography (IRT) is an essential non-invasive method for analyzing surface temperature variations in animals, offering valuable insights into livestock stress responses. Despite their resilience, goats can face significant challenges under extreme conditions like heat-stress and water deprivation. This experiment aimed to delineate the dynamic variations in whole-body and scrotal surface temperatures in goats subjected to the combined impact of both conditions using IRT. Eight healthy Aardi bucks were exposed to three 72-h treatments: euhydration, dehydration, and rehydration. Continuous meteorological monitoring provided ambienttemperature, relative-humidity, and temperature-humidity index (THI) values. Surface temperatures were measured twice daily at 08:00 and 15:00, and thermal gradients between ambient and body or scrotal surface temperatures were computed. Based on the obtained mean THI values, the bucks experienced heat-stress throughout the experiment. Additionally, results revealed noticeable variations in both surface temperatures across treatments and time points, indicated by measures of central tendency, variability, shape descriptors, and frequency distribution of temperature. Morning measurements indicated lower temperatures and gradients under euhydration, while water deprivation led to higher temperatures and compromised thermal regulation. Conversely, afternoon data showed higher variability in temperature responses, highlighting the compounded effect of diurnal heat-stress and water deprivation. Although water-restoration mitigated some effects of deprivation, it did not fully restore thermal homeostasis to euhydrated levels. Thermal gradients further emphasized the goats' dynamic thermoregulatory mechanisms, which were compromised under water deprivation, particularly in the scrotal region, but were partially restored upon restoration. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of IRT in assessing thermal responses in goats and underscore the importance of adequate hydration for maintaining thermal balance under heat-stress. The herein performed profiling provides valuable insights with implications for overall health, reproductive efficiency, productivity, and welfare in heat-stressed and water-deprived goats, which might offer a framework for future research on livestock adaptation to such challenging environmental conditions.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103960,125,NA,NA,103960,Heat stress; Reproduction; Thermophysiology; Thermoregulation; Water deprivation; Welfare
article,The seasonal response of metabolic rate to projected climate change scenarios in aquatic amphipods,"Shokri, Milad and Lezzi, Ludovico and Basset, Alberto",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The responses of organisms to climate change are mediated primarily by its impact on their metabolic rates, which, in turn, drive various biological and ecological processes. Although there have been numerous seminal studies on the sensitivity of metabolic rate to temperature, little is empirically known about how this rate responds to seasonal temperature ranges and beyond under conservative IPCC climate change scenarios. Here, we measured the SMR of the aquatic amphipod, Gammarus insensibilis, which served as our subject species, with body masses ranging from 0.20 to 7.74 mg ash free weight. We assessed the response of the SMR across nine temperature levels ranging from 12 to 30.2 degrees C. These temperatures match seasonal temperature norms, with an incremental increase of 0.6-1.2 degrees C above each seasonal baseline, as projected for the years 2040 and 2100 under the modest climate change scenarios. Overall, our findings showed that the effect of temperature on SMR varies with body mass, as indicated by a negative size-temperature interaction, with larger conspecifics exhibiting less sensitivity to temperature changes than smaller ones. From the cold to warm season, the SMR increased by an average of 14\% degrees C-1, with increases of 18.4\% degrees C-1 in smaller individuals and 11.4\% degrees C-1 in larger ones. The SMR of smaller individuals peaked at a 0.6 degrees C increase from the current summer baseline (15.08\% degrees C-1, Q10 = 4.2), while in larger ones it peaked with a 1.2 degrees C increase beyond autumn temperatures (14.9\% degrees C-1, Q10 = 3.9). However, at temperatures reflecting global warming that exceed summer temperatures, the SMR of larger individuals levelled off, while that of smaller ones continued to increase. Overall, our findings suggest that smallersized individuals have a broader thermal window for SMR performance, while the SMR of larger-sized ones will become increasingly constrained at summer temperatures as those summer temperatures become hotter.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103941,124,NA,NA,103941,Metabolic rate; Global warming; Body size; Scaling; Season; Thermal tolerance
article,Understanding seasonal telomere length dynamics in hibernating species,"Redon, Lilian and Constant, Theo and Smith, Steve and Habold, Caroline and Giroud, Sylvain",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Oxidative stress is thought to be one of the main causes of ageing as it progressively damages cell components throughout life, eventually causing cellular failure and apoptosis. In many organisms, telomeres shorten throughout life under the effect of, amongst other factors, oxidative stress, and are therefore commonly used as marker of biological ageing. However, hibernators, which are regularly exposed to acute oxidative stress when rewarming from torpor, are unexpectedly long-lived. In this review, we explore the causes of oxidative stress associated with hibernation and its impact on telomere dynamics in different taxa, focussing on hibernating rodents. We then speculate on the adaptive mechanisms of hibernators to compensate for the effects of oxidative stress, which may explain their increased longevity. Because winter hibernation appears to be associated with high oxidative stress, hibernators, particularly rodents, may periodically invest in repair mechanisms and antioxidant defences, resulting in seasonal variations in telomere lengths. This research shows how species with a slow life-history strategy deal with large changes in oxidative stress, unifying evolutionary and physiological theories of ageing. Because of the marked seasonal variation in telomere length, we also draw attention when using telomeres as markers for biological aging in seasonal heterotherms and possibly in other highly seasonal species.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103913,123,NA,NA,103913,Telomere length; Ageing; Hibernation; Oxidative stress; Seasonal species; Evolutionary physiology
article,Can upwelling regions be potential thermal refugia for marine fishes during climate warming?,"Angeles-Gonzalez, Luis Enrique and Torrejon-Magallanes, Josymar and Escamilla-Ake, Angel and Osorio-Olverano, Luis and Avendano, Otilio and Diaz, Fernando and Rosas, Carlos",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Species are expected to migrate to higher latitudes as warming intensifies due to anthropogenic climate change since physiological mechanisms have been adapted to maximize fitness under specific temperatures. However, literature suggests that upwellings could act as thermal refugia under climate warming protecting marine ecosystem diversity. This research aimed to predict the effects of climate warming on commercial and noncommercial fish species reported in official Mexican documents (>200 species) based on their thermal niche to observe if upwellings can act as potential thermal refugia. Present (2000-2014) and Representative Concentration Pathway (6.0 and 8.5) scenarios (2040-2050 and 2090-2100) have been considered for this work. Current and future suitability patterns, species distribution, richness, and turnover were calculated using the minimum volume ellipsoids as algorithm. The results in this study highlight that beyond migration to higher latitudes, upwelling regions could protect marine fishes, although the mechanism differed between the innate characteristics of upwellings. Most modeled species (primarily tropical fishes) found refuge in the tropical upwelling in Northern Yucatan. However, the highest warming scenario overwhelmed this region. In contrast, the Baja California region lies within the Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems. While the area experiences an increase in suitability, the northern regions have a higher upwelling intensity acting as environmental barriers for many tropical species. Conversely, in the southern regions where upwelling is weaker, species tend to congregate and persist even during elevated warming, according to the turnover analysis. These findings suggest that tropicalization in higher latitudes may not be as straightforward as previously assumed. Nevertheless, climate change affects numerous ecosystem features, such as trophic relationships, phenology, and other environmental variables not considered here. In addition, uncertainty still exists about the assumption of increasing intensity of upwelling systems.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103893,123,NA,NA,103893,Climate change; Upwelling regions; Ecological niche models; Species distribution model; Mexico; Fisheries
article,Role of periodic irradiation and incident beam radius for plasmonic photothermal therapy of subsurface tumors,"Shaw, Amit Kumar and Soni, Sanjeev",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Plasmonic photothermal therapy (PPTT) is a potential technique to treat tumors selectively. However, during PPTT, issue of high temperature region and damage to the surrounding healthy is still need to be resolved. Also, treatment of deeper tumors non-invasively is a challenge for PPTT. In this paper, the effect of periodic irradiation and incident beam radius (relative to tumor size) for various gold nanorods (GNRs) concentrations is investigated to avoid much higher temperatures region with limiting thermal damage to the surrounding healthy tissue during PPTT of subsurface breast tumors located at various depths. Lattice Boltzmann method is used to solve Pennes' bioheat model to compute the resulting photothermal temperatures for the subsurface tumor embedded with GNRs subjected to broadband near infrared radiation of intensity 1 W/cm2. Computation revealed that low GNRs concentration leads to uniform internal heat generation than higher GNRs concentrations. The results show that deeper tumors, due to attenuation of incident radiation, show low temperature rise than shallower tumors. For shallower tumors situated 3 mm deep, 70\% irradiation period resulted in around 20 degrees C reduction (110 degrees C-90 degrees C) of maximum temperature than that with the continuous irradiation. Moreover, 70\% beam radius (i.e., beam radius as 70\% of the tumor radius) causes less thermal damage to the nearby healthy tissue than 100\% beam radius (i.e., beam radius equal to the tumor radius). The thermal damage within the healthy tissue is minimized to the 1 mm in radial direction and 3 mm in axial direction for 70\% beam radius with 70\% irradiation period. Overall, periodic heating and changing beam radius of the incident irradiation lead to reduce high temperature and limit healthy tissue damage. Hence, discussed results are useful for selection of the irradiation parameters for PPTT of sub-surface tumors.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103859,121,NA,NA,103859,Subsurface tumor; Plasmonic photothermal therapy; Thermal ablation temperature; Periodic irradiation; Beam radius; Lattice Boltzmann method; Gold nanorods
article,Surface temperatures are influenced by handling stress independently of corticosterone levels in wild king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus ),"Lewden, Agnes and Ward, Chelsea and Noiret, Aude and Avril, Sandra and Abolivier, Lucie and Gerard, Caroline and Hammer, Tracey L. and Raymond, Emilie and Robin, Jean-Patrice and Viblanc, Vincent A. and Bize, Pierre and Stier, Antoine",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Assessing the physiological stress responses of wild animals opens a window for understanding how organisms cope with environmental challenges. Since stress response is associated with changes in body temperature, the use of body surface temperature through thermal imaging could help to measure acute and chronic stress responses non -invasively. We used thermal imaging, acute handling -stress protocol and an experimental manipulation of corticosterone (the main glucocorticoid hormone in birds) levels in breeding king penguins ( Aptenodytes patagonicus ), to assess: 1. The potential contribution of the Hypothalamo-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis in mediating chronic and acute stress -induced changes in adult surface temperature, 2. The influence of HPA axis manipulation on parental investment through thermal imaging of eggs and brooded chicks, and 3. The impact of parental treatment on offspring thermal ` s response to acute handling. Maximum eye temperature ( T eye ) increased and minimum beak temperature ( T beak ) decreased in response to handling stress in adults, but neither basal nor stress -induced surface temperatures were significantly affected by corticosterone implant. While egg temperature was not significantly influenced by parental treatment, we found a surprising pattern for chicks: chicks brooded by the (non -implanted) partner of corticosterone-implanted individuals exhibited higher surface temperature (both T eye and T beak ) than those brooded by glucocorticoidimplanted or control parents. Chick ` s response to handling in terms of surface temperature was characterized by a drop in both T eye and T beak independently of parental treatment. We conclude that the HPA axis seems unlikely to play a major role in determining chronic or acute changes in surface temperature in king penguins. Changes in surface temperature may primarily be mediated by the Sympathetic -Adrenal -Medullary (SAM) axis in response to stressful situations. Our experiment did not reveal a direct impact of parental HPA axis manipulation on parental investment (egg or chick temperature), but a potential influence on the partner ` s brooding behaviour.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103850,121,NA,NA,103850,Thermal imaging; Stress; Corticosterone; Heterothermy; Bird; Beak; Eye
article,Morphological and biochemical responses of a neotropical pest insect to low temperatures,"Leon-Quinto, Trinidad and Madrigal, Roque and Cabello, Esteban and Fimia, Antonio and Serna, Arturo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"As traditionally cold areas become warmer due to climate change, temperature could no longer be a barrier to the establishment of non-native insects. This is particularly relevant for pest insects from warm and tropical areas, mainly those with some tolerance to moderately low temperatures, which could expand their range into these new locations. From this perspective, in this work we studied the morphological and biochemical responses of the Neotropical pest Paysandisia archon to low temperatures, as part of a possible strategy to colonize new areas. To that end, wild larvae were exposed for 7 days to either low (1 and 5 degree celsius) or ambient (23 degree celsius) temperatures. We then quantified the inner and outer morphological changes, by X-Ray Computer Tomography and Digital Holographic Microscopy, as well as the accumulation of metabolites acting as potential endogenous cryoprotectants, by Spectrophotometry. We found that Paysandisia archon developed a cold-induced response based on different aspects. On the one hand, morphological changes occurred with a significant reduction both in fluids susceptible to freezing and fat body, together with the thickening, hardening and increased roughness of the integument. On the other hand, we found an increase in the hemolymph concentration of cryoprotective substances such as glucose (6-fold) and glycerol (2-fold), while trehalose remained unchanged. Surprisingly, this species did not show any evidence of cold-induced response unless the environmental temperature was remarkably low (1 degree celsius). These results could be useful to improve models predicting the possible spread of such a pest, which should incorporate parameters related to its resistance to low temperatures.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103795,119,NA,NA,103795,Paysandisia archon; Climate change; Pest insect; Cold-hardening; Low-molecular weight cryoprotectants
article,Thermal resting pattern and acute skin temperature response to exercise in older adults: Role of cardiorespiratory fitness,"Corral-Perez, Juan and Martinez-Tellez, Borja and Velazquez-Diaz, Daniel and Ponce-Gonzalez, Jesus Gustavo and Carbonell-Baeza, Ana and Jimenez-Pavon, David",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Background: Infrared thermography is a growing area of interest in sports science due to the potential of skin temperature (T-sk) measurements to provide valuable information from rest to exercise. However, limited research exists on T-sk in older adults and the impact of factors such as sex and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) on T-sk. This study aims to investigate T-sk at rest and after acute exercise in older adults and assess whether sex or CRF influences T-sk. Methods: Ninety-two participants (41 women, 68.48 +/- 3.01 years) were examined with a thermographic camera in a conditioned room (23.02 +/- 3.01 degrees C) at rest and after a graded protocol. The T-sk of 25 regions of interest (ROIs) were extracted and analysed. Results: Men had higher overall T-sk at rest in 76\% of ROIs, showing significant differences (p < 0.010) in six specific ROIs, independent of CRF. Both sexes had similar T-sk responses after graded exercise, with increases in distal parts (1.06 +/- 0.50 C-degrees), decreases in proximal parts (-0.62 +/- 0.42 degrees C), and stable central T-sk (0.23 +/- 0.59 degrees C). Increases in lower limb T-sk were significantly associated with CRF in men and women (beta = 0.438, p = 0.001, and beta = 0.535, p < 0.001, respectively), explaining 17\% and 27\% of the variance, respectively. Conclusions: This study demonstrates a sex-specific effect on resting T-sk in older adults, suggesting that sex-specific T-sk patterns should be considered when analysing T-sk in this population. Additionally, the association between increases in lower limb T-sk and CRF suggests that T-sk could be a promising predictor of CRF in older adults.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103678,117,NA,NA,103678,Thermal imaging; Infrared thermography; Thermoregulation; Aging

Mendez-de la and Tellez-Valdes, Oswaldo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The impact of daily and seasonal variation in environmental temperature on lizards is important, since their physiological processes are body temperature dependent. Lizards that occupy mountainous areas must have been favoured to colonize such habitats through selection on thermal biology traits to thermoregulate effectively. Moreover, mountain lizards may be able to maintain their activity near their minimum critical temperature and even have antifreeze mechanisms. Tolerance of freezing is related to the biosynthesis of cryoprotective molecules, such as glucose, whose concentration may increase after freezing. The aims of the present work were: (1) study the thermoregulation of the viviparous lizard Abronia taeniata, and (2) determine its survival and/or tolerance to freezing. This species occurs in pine forests, pine-oak forests, and mountain mesophilic forests in areas that reach freezing temperatures. In the field, we recorded air, substrate, and body temperatures at capture time of the lizards, and registered operative temperatures at the study area. In the laboratory, we determined thermal preferences, crystallization point, and blood glucose levels of individuals before and after freezing. We found out that A. taeniata sustains activity in a wide range of temperatures, actively avoids thermally favourable microhabitats in spring, and is a moderate thermoregulator during autumn and winter. In A. taeniata, the body temperatures are tightly linked to air and substrate temperatures. Seasonality had an effect over body temperature, preferred temperatures and thermoregulatory effectiveness indices. When exposed to temperatures below zero, A. taeniata showed an increase in blood glucose levels, which aided them in surviving freezing. Taken together, our results suggest that A. taeniata may sustain activity at low environmental temperatures, due to an effective behavioural thermoregulation, and in case temperatures of its habitat go below zero, is also capable of tolerate freezing.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103679,117,NA,NA,103679,Body temperat u r e; Eurythermic; Glucose; Preferred temperature; Thermoregulation

PBC is performed in a rapid timeframe, inside an on-purposed designed cryo-cabin. Recently, cryocabins have been built with different energy systems, however a validation study on relative thermal responses is missing. This study was aimed at comparing thermal responses following a PBC in an electrically powered cryo-cabin based on forced convection or into a standard nitrogen-fueled cryo-cabin. In a randomized crossover fashion, thirty-six subjects (F=20; M=16) underwent both cryo-exposures lasting 150 s each. Thermal responses were assessed before and immediately after completing each PBC session. Mixed model analysis of variance revealed a significantly colder temperature after electric PBC in all the body regions (except for the thighs) with respect to a standard nitrogen based PBC (F: 16.4 \& PLUSMN; 1.4 vs 18 \& PLUSMN; 5.8 degrees C; M: 16.4 \& PLUSMN; 1.7 vs 20.9 \& PLUSMN; 4 degrees C). Moreover, a significant lower thermal discomfort was perceived at the end of electric PBC as compared to that one felt following standard PBC. For the first time, the safety and thermo-effectiveness of an electric cryocabin based on forced convection was ensured.

article,Saving energy via short and shallow torpor bouts,"Nowack, Julia and Mzilikazi, Nomakwezi and Dausmann, Kathrin H.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Maintaining a high and stable body temperature as observed in most endothermic mammals and birds is energetically costly and many heterothermic species reduce their metabolic demands during energetic bottlenecks through the use of torpor. With the increasing number of heterotherms revealed in a diversity of habitats, it becomes apparent that triggers and patterns of torpor use are more variable than previously thought. Here, we report the previously overlooked use of, shallow rest-time torpor (body temperature >30 degrees C) in African lesser bushbabies, Galago moholi. Body core temperature of three adult male bushbabies recorded over five months showed a clear bimodal distribution with an average active modal temperature of 39.2 degrees C and a resting modal body temperature of 36.7 degrees C. Shallow torpor was observed in two out of three males (n = 29 torpor bouts) between June and August (austral winter), with body temperatures dropping to an overall minimum of 30.7 degrees C and calculated energy savings of up to 10\%. We suggest that shallow torpor may be an ecologically important, yet mostly overlooked energy-saving strategy employed by heterothermic mammals. Our data emphasise that torpor threshold temperatures need to be used with care if we aim to fully understand the level of physiological plasticity displayed by heterothermic species.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103572,114,NA,NA,103572,Rest-time hypothermia; Shallow torpor; Bush baby; Galago moholi; Mammal; Heterothermy

Aqueous orange peel extract (AOPE) is high in potential natural antioxidants that help avoid free radical damage and is a good source of phytochemicals. Based on these benefits, it was hypothesized that oral administration of AOPE could overcome the negative impacts of severe heat stress on reproductive and lactation performance, physiological parameters, and antioxidant status. To determine the protective effect of AOPE, 36 female rabbits (six-months-old, average body weight of 2.67 +/- 0.03 kg) were given 1.50 mL water (control), and 2.50 or 5.00 mL AOPE every two days for four months. Oral AOPE administration significantly reduced the respiration rate (RR) and rectal temperature (RT) during pregnancy and lactation. The reproductive performance (litter size) and productive performance (litter weight and litter weight gain) were significantly increased by AOPE treatment, compared with the control. The highest milk yield was recorded in 5.00 mL AOPE treatment (5.00 mL). AOPE treatments significantly increased serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and AOPE treatment (5.00 mL) lowered serum thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs) of heat-stressed rabbits. Serum total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was not affected by AOPE treatment. The addition of AOPE improved reproductive performance, physiological parameters, and antioxidant status, but did not have a beneficial effect on conception rate of female rabbits under severe heat stress.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103403,111,NA,NA,103403,Orange peel extract; Physiological parameters; Reproductive performance; Blood parameters; Heat stress

Eleven male professional athletes (age, 29.26 +/- 4.52 years) from an Brazil elite team were evaluated, with measurements obtained before (Baseline), and at Post-Games times (24, 48 and 72h). CRP and Tsk levels at 24 h and 48 h Post-Games times were higher than Baseline levels (CRP, p 0.001, d 0.04, d 0.58), additionally, the levels of these variables (CRP vs. Tsk) showed positive correlations (p < 0.05, rs = 0.60-0.88). The relative responses these variables were evaluated (Delta\%CRP; Delta\%Tsk). The 48h responses of Game 3 are respectively higher than 48 h responses of games 1 and 2, in Delta\%CRP (p < 0.03; G3 vs. G1, r = 0.66; G3 vs. G2, r = 0.88) and in Delta\%Tsk (p < 0.003; G3 vs. G1, r = 0.88; G3 vs. G2, r = 0.88). The 48 h Post-Game time seems to represent valuable contributions to understanding the development regarding the magnitude and duration of inflammatory processes associated with recovery. Additionally, the positive correlations that were verified allow an increase in the robustness of the analysis of the load of consecutive games through CRP and Tsk of the LLs. Then, these results indicate a physiological stress and a probable cumulative effect of the game loads due to short intervals (< 4 days), which is reinforced by the verified outcome of the Total Distance covered (G3 < G2, p = 0.003; r = 0.88).

Kurt",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Fish can be identified as either low responders (LR) or high responders (HR) based on post-stress cortisol levels and whether they exhibit a proactive or reactive stress coping style, respectively. In this study, male Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) from 17 families reared at 9 degrees C were repeatedly exposed to an acute handling stress over a period of four months, with plasma cortisol levels measured at 1 h post-stress. Fish were identified as either LR or HR if the total Z-score calculated from their cortisol responses fell into the lower or upper quartile ranges, respectively; with intermediate responders (IR) classified as the remainder. Salmon characterized as LR, IR or HR were then subjected to an incremental thermal challenge, where temperature was raised at 0.2 degrees C day(-1) from their acclimation temperature (12 degrees C) to mimic natural sea-cage farming conditions during the summer in Newfoundland. Interestingly, feed intake remained high up to 22 degrees C, while previous studies have shown a decrease in salmon appetite after similar to 16-18 degrees C. After the first three mortalities were recorded at elevated temperature, a subset of LR and HR salmon were exposed to another acute handling stress event at 23.6 degrees C. Basal and post-stress measurements of plasma cortisol, glucose and lactate did not differ between stress response phenotypes at this temperature. In the end, the average incremental thermal maximum (ITMax) of LR and HR fish was not different (25.1 degrees C). In comparison, the critical thermal maximum (CTMax; temperature increased at 2 degrees C h(-1)) of the remaining IR fish that had been held at 12 degrees C was 28.5 degrees C. Collectively, these results: 1) show that this population of Atlantic salmon is very thermally tolerant, and further question the relevance of CTMax in assessing responses to real-world temperature changes; and 2) indicate that characterization of stress phenotype at 9 degrees C is not predictive of their stress response or survival at high temperatures. Therefore, selection of fish based on phenotypic stress response at low temperatures may not be beneficial to incorporate into Atlantic salmon breeding programs, especially if the goal is to improve growth performance and survival at high temperatures in sea-cages.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103102,101,NA,NA,103102,Atlantic salmon; Stress; Cortisol; Thermal tolerance; Climate change
article,Soursop juice enhanced seminal antioxidant defence and semen quality of rabbit bucks in extremely dry climatic condition of Southwestern Nigeria,"Jimoh, Olatunji Abubakar and Oyeyemi, Bolaji Fatai and Oyeyemi, Wahab Adekunle",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Heat induced stress associated with dry climatic conditions in the tropics does have adverse effects reproduction in rabbits, and this in-turn impacts negatively on the income of rabbit farmers. However, natural products might prove to be a reliable, safe and cheap remedy for ameliorating reproductive such anomalies in rabbits. The potential of soursop for mitigating heat induced reproductive deficiency in rabbit bucks was investigated during the peak of dry climatic conditions in southwestern Nigeria. Sixty mixed breed (New Zealand white x Chinchilla) adult rabbit bucks were allotted to five treatments of four replicates (3 bucks per replicate) each in a completely randomized design. Soursop (Annona muricata) fruit was processed into juice using standard procedures and was designated as soursop juice.

Semen samples were collected with an improvised artificial vagina on the 28th and 56th day of the study, semen quality and seminal oxidative status were evaluated using standard procedures. Results showed that rabbit buck exposed to heat stress had lower semen quality, seminal antioxidants and increased seminal lipid peroxidation. However, the consumption of soursop juice lowered lipid peroxidation and enhanced (p < 0.05) antioxidant production in the seminal fluid of heat-stressed bucks than bucks on control group. Bucks' semen quality and antioxidant status peaks in heat-stressed bucks gavaged 2.22 ml/kgBW soursop juice and gives 100\% recovery from the effects of heat induced stress.

We measured multiple thermal endpoints to investigate potential for establishment of the invasive Ringed Crayfish (Faxonius neglectus) in thermally heterogeneous habitat of the narrowly distributed endemic Coldwater Crayfish (Faxonius eupunctus). For each species, we examined the relationships between thermal endpoints at the cellular and organismal levels. We then compared results between the two species to gain insight as to the generality of linkages between cellular and organismal-level endpoints, as well as the potential for thermal niche separation between the native and potential invader. At the cellular level, we found no differences in the temperature for maximum activity of electron transport system enzymes (ETSmax) between species. At the organismal level, F. neglectus preferred significantly warmer temperatures than F. eupunctus, but this difference was small (1.3 degrees C) and likely to have only limited biological significance. The critical thermal maximum (CTM) did not differ between species. For both species, the thermal performance curve for ETS enzyme activity served as a useful framework to link thermal endpoints and estimate the transition from optimal to stressful temperatures - organismal thermal preference and optimal temperature estimates consistently fell below ETSmax whereas CTM estimates fell above ETSmax. Taken together, the strong similarities in thermal endpoint patterns between the two species suggest habitats thermally suitable for the native F. eupunctus will also be thermally available to expanding populations of F. neglectus, thereby increasing the opportunity for negative interactions and population effects if F. neglectus invades one of the few remaining, uninvaded, critical habitats of F. eupunctus.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102864,97,NA,NA,102864,Crayfish; Temperature; Introduced species; Thermal tolerance; Resource partitioning

These factors may be particularly important for softshell turtles that are highly aquatic and often thermoregulate by burying in the substrate in shallow water microhabitats. We tested for effects of acclimation temperature (22 degrees C or 27 degrees C) and substrate type (sand or gravel) on the selected temperature and movement patterns of 20 juvenile spiny softhshell turtles (Apalone spinifera; Reptilia: Trionychidae) in an aquatic thermal gradient of 14-34 degrees C. Among 7-11 month old juvenile softshell turtles, acclimation temperature and substrate type did not influence temperature selection, nor alter activity and movement patterns. During thermal gradient tests, both 22- and 27 degrees C-acclimated turtles selected the warmest temperature (34 degrees C) available most frequently, regardless of substrate type (sand or gravel). Similarly, acclimation temperature and substrate type did not influence movement patterns of turtles, nor the number of chambers used in the gradient tests. These results suggest that juvenile Apalone spinifera are capable of detecting small temperature increments and prefer warm temperatures that may positively influence growth and metabolism, and that thermal factors more significantly influence aquatic thermoregulation in this species than does substrate type.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102701,93,NA,NA,102701,Thermoregulation; Temperature gradient; Trionychidae; Juvenile turtle behavior

Agreement between the infrared camera and thermistor was assessed by mean difference (infrared camera minus thermistor) and 95\% limits of agreement analysis, accounting for the repeated measures over time. The clinically significant threshold for T-sk differences was set at +/- 0.5 degrees C and limits of agreement +/- 1 degrees C. Results: As an average across all time points, the infrared camera recorded T-sk 1.80 (SD 1.16) degrees C warmer than the thermistor, with 95\% limits of agreement ranging from -0.46 degrees C to 4.07 degrees C. Conclusion: Collectively, the results show the infrared camera overestimated T-sk at every time point following local cooling. Further, measurement of finger T-sk from the infrared camera consistently fell outside the acceptable level of agreement (i.e. mean difference exceeding +/- 0.5 degrees C). Considering these results, infrared cameras may overestimate peripheral T-sk following cold exposure and clinicians and practitioners should, therefore, adjust their risk/withdrawal criteria accordingly.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102614,91,NA,NA,102614,Infrared thermography; Temperature measurement; Thermoregulation; Cold exposure; Instrument validity
article,How will farmed populations of freshwater fish deal with the extreme climate scenario in 2100? Transcriptional responses of <i>Colossoma macropomum</i> from two Brazilian climate regions,"Fe-Goncalves, Luciana Mara and Alves Araujo, Jose Deney and dos Anjos dos Santos, Carlos Henrique and Val, Adalberto Luis and Fonseca de Almeida-Val, Vera Maria",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum Cuvier, 1818) is an endemic fish of the Amazon and Orinoco basins, and it is the most economically important native species in Brazil being raised in five climatically distinct regions. In the face of current global warming, environmental variations in farm ponds represent additional challenges that may drive new adaptive regional genetic variations among broodstocks of tambaqui. In an experimental context based on the high-emission scenario of the 5th Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, we used two farmed tambaqui populations to test this hypothesis. RNA-seq transcriptome analysis was performed in the liver of juvenile tambaqui from northern (Balbina Experimental Station, Balbina, AM) and southeastern (Brumado Fish Farming, Mogi Mirim, SP) Brazilian regions kept for 30 days in artificial environmental rooms mimicking the current and extreme climate scenarios. Three Illumina MiSeq runs produced close to 120 million 500 bp paired-end reads; 191,139 contigs were assembled with N50 = 1595. 355 genes were differentially expressed for both populations in response to the extreme scenario. After enrichment analysis, each population presented a core set of genes to cope with climate change. Northern fish induced genes related to the cellular response to stress, activation of MAPK activity, response to unfolded protein, protein metabolism and cellular response to DNA damage stimuli. Genes biologically involved in regulating cell proliferation, protein stabilisation and protein ubiquitination for degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system were downregulated. Genes associated with biological processes, including the cellular response to stress, MAPK cascade activation, homeostatic processes and positive regulation of immune responses were upregulated in southeastern fish. The downregulated genes were related to cytoskeleton organisation, energy metabolism, and the regulation of transcription and biological rhythms. Our findings reveal the signatures of promising candidate genes involved in the regional plasticity of each population of tambaqui in dealing with upcoming climate changes.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102487,89,NA,NA,102487,Tambaqui; Climate change; RNA-Seq; Differential expression; Thermal adaptation

The elderly population is more vulnerable than the healthy and young population due to age-weakened physiology and thermoregulatory functions. There are, however, limited bioheat models addressing such changes due to hot exposure in the young and the elderly. This paper develops robust bioheat models for young and elderly while incorporating the physiological changes under exposure to heat-stressful conditions for both age groups the age-related changes in physiology and thermoregulation to an elderly human. However, due to a large variability of thermoregulation among the elderly population, a sensitivity analysis revealed that the average elderly is characterized by metabolic rate and cardiac output, which are lower than those of the young by 21\% and 14.4\%, respectively. Moreover, the thresholds of the onset of vasodilation and sweating are delayed from those of young adults by 0.5 degrees C and 0.21 degrees C, respectively. The elderly and young bioheat models were validated with number of independent published experimental studies under hot exposures in steady and transient conditions.

J. and Mensch, J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Zaprionus indianus is a fly species native to the Afrotropical biogeographic region that invaded the South American continent 20 years ago. Its southernmost record is 34 degrees S in areas with temperate climates with cold winters. To better understand its invasion biology, we investigated physiological responses to winter-like abiotic conditions that may be relevant in Z. indianus geographic expansion. We characterized Z. indianus females reproductive traits (ovarian maturation and fertility) and survival in response to cold treatments with summer-like and winter-like photoperiods. We also compared these traits between native (Yokadouma, Africa) and invasive (Yuto, South America) range wild-derived flies. We showed that Z. indianus females have the ability to arrest ovarian maturation and maintain fertility following recovery from cold stress. The critical temperature for ovarian maturation of this species was estimated at c. 13 degrees C, an intermediate value between those of tropical and temperate drosophilid species. Wild-derived females from Yuto responded to winter-like photoperiod by slowing down ovarian maturation at low but permissive temperatures of 14 degrees C and 16 degrees C and also delayed the start of oviposition after cold treatment. Yuto flies also survived better and recovered 20\% faster from chill coma than flies from Yokadouma. These results are consistent with a scenario of local adaptations or phenotypic plasticity in the invaded range, and suggest that photoperiod could act as modulator of ovarian arrest. Conversely, the fact that native range flies showed higher fertility after cold recovery than females from invaded range is not indicative of local adaptation. All in all, our findings report a set of physiological responses that would enable Z. indianus expansion to temperate and cold areas, but also results that are compatible with a limitation to the invasion process.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102470,87,NA,NA,102470,Zaprionus indianus; Overwintering; Low temperature physiology; Invaded range; Native range

For this, 74-week-old laying hens (n = 64) were divided into four groups with four repetitions each, as follow: T0 (the control group; without GPF), T1 (1\% GPF), T2 (2\% GPF) and T3 (3\% GPF) during 35 days. Percentage of laid eggs was higher in the group T1 compared to T0, and the feed intake was higher in the groups T1, T2 and T3 compared to T0. There was no difference regarding the chemical-physical composition of fresh eggs; however, eggs from GPF-fed chickens showed changes after storage regarding specific gravity, yolk index, pH of yolk, albumen and Haugh unit compared to T0. Fresh or stored egg yolk from GPF groups showed higher antioxidant capacity and lower lipid peroxidation compared to T0. GPF (3\%) prevented the reduction of monounsaturated fatty acids in the yolk of stored eggs compared to T0. Glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activities, as well as total antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals were higher in the serum of laying hens that received GPF compared to T0, while lipid peroxidation was lower.

M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"A hot environment combined with physically demanding tasks can subject workers to a higher risk of heat stress. A series of regulations and guidelines have been proposed to design appropriate anti-heat stress work uniform to reduce body heat strain. The present study aimed to examine heat strain recovery in different anti-heat stress clothing ensembles after work to exhaustion in the heat. 10 healthy males performed intermittent treadmill running/walking to exhaustion, followed by 30 min passive recovery sitting in a climatic chamber, which simulated the hot and humid outdoor environment (34 degrees C temperature, 60\% relative humidity, 0.3 m/s air velocity, and 450 W/m(2) solar radiation). The participants took part in five wear trials in counter-balanced order, including Sportswear, CIC Uniform, NEW Uniform, ICEBANK Cooling Vest, and NEW Cooling Vest, which have different levels of cooling capacity. Core temperature, skin temperature, heart rate, sweat loss, ratings of perceived exertion, and thermal sensations were measured throughout the entire heat exposure period. Physiological heat strain indices, including the physiological strain index (PhSI) and the perceptual strain index (PeSI), were used as a yardstick to quantify and compare the rate of recovery. Significantly lower physiological strain was observed in the newly developed NEW Uniform and NEW Cooling Vest groups compared with the commonly worn CIC Uniform group during recovery. At the end of the recovery period, participants in NEW Cooling Vest achieved the highest recovery (42.18\% in PhSI and 81.08\% in PeSI), followed by ICEBANK Cooling Vest, Sportswear, NEW Uniform, and CIC Uniform. The cooling capacity of anti-heat stress clothing ensembles and the recovery time significantly affect the rate of recovery in PhSI and PeSI, which may benefit the industry by formulating the appropriate work rest schedule by considering the clothing effect.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.09.004,69,NA,311-318,NA,Anti-heat stress clothing ensembles; Physiological and perceptual strain; Rate of recovery
article,"Thermal biology in two syntopic lizards, <i>Phymaturus extrilidus</i> and <i>Liolaemus parvus</i>, in the Puna region of Argentina","Gomez Ales, Rodrigo and Carlos Acosta, Juan and Laspiur, Alejandro",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Body temperature is the most important ecophysiological variable affecting reptiles' life history. Moreover, thermoregulation in ectotherms implies a struggle to reach preferred temperatures in natural conditions due to the influence of biotic and abiotic factors. Our objective was to evaluate and compare the thermal biology of two syntopic species, Phymaturus extrilidus and Liolaemus porous, in the Puna region of San Juan, Argentina. We determined body temperature (T-b), micro-environmental temperatures (T-a and T-s) and operative temperatures (T-s) in the field. In the laboratory, we measured preferred temperatures (T-pref) and calculated the index of thermoregulatory efficiency (E). Neither body temperatures in the field nor preferred temperatures varied between seasons and sexes. Body temperatures were lower than preferred temperatures for both species. Nevertheless, regardless of the low thermal offer available in habitat, both species did achieve body temperatures higher than operative temperatures during activity. Thermoregulatory effectiveness was moderate in P. extrilidus (E=0.65), while L. parvus presented greater thermoregulatory efficiency (E=0.78). We conclude that under the rigorous climate conditions of the Puna, Phymaturus extrilidus and Liolaemus parvus are able to actively and efficiently thermoregulate, maintaining body temperatures close to the preferred and higher than those of its habitat. Differences in thermal characteristics between Phymaturus extrilidus and Liolaemus parvus are a consequence of differential limitations imposed on each species by the environment and of forces inherent to their life histories.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.02.001,68,A,73-82,NA,Thermoregulation; Thermoregulatory efficiency; Viviparous; Liolaemidae; Precordillera
article,Effect of temperature and social environment on worker size in the ant <i>Temnothorax nylanderi</i>,"Molet, Mathieu and Peronnet, Romain and Couette, Sebastien and Canovas, Christophe and Doums, Claudie",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Warm temperatures decrease insect developmental time and body size. Social life could buffer external environmental variations, especially in large social groups, either through behavioral regulation and compensation or through specific nest architecture. Mean worker size and distribution of worker sizes within colonies are important parameters affecting colony productivity as worker size is linked to division of labor in insect societies. In this paper, we investigate the effect of stressful warm temperatures and the role of social environment (colony size and size of nestmate workers) on the mean size and size variation of laboratory-born workers in the small European ant Temnothorax nylanderi. To do so, we reared field-collected colonies under medium or warm temperature treatments after having marked the field-born workers and removed the brood except for 30 first instar larvae. Warm temperature resulted in the production of fewer workers and a higher adult mortality, confirming that this regime was stressful for the ants. T. nylanderi ants followed the temperature size rule observed in insects, with a decreased developmental time and mean size under warm condition. Social environment appeared to play an important role as we observed that (i) larger colonies buffered the effect of temperature better than smaller ones (ii) colonies with larger workers produced larger workers whatever the rearing temperature and (iii) the coefficient of variation of worker size was similar in the field and under medium laboratory temperature. This suggests that worker size variation is not primarily due to seasonal environmental fluctuations in the field. Finally, we observed a higher coefficient of variation of worker size under warm temperature. We propose that this results from a disruption of social regulation, i.e. the control of nestmate workers over developing larvae and adult worker size, under stressful conditions.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.04.013,67,NA,22-29,NA,Body size; Temperature size rule; Social environment; Phenotypic plasticity; Social insects
article,Effects of daily fluctuating temperatures on the <i>Drosophila</i>-<i>Leptopilina boulardi</i> parasitoid association,"Delava, Emilie and Fleury, Frederic and Gibert, Patricia",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Koinobiont parasitoid insects, which maintain intimate and long-term relationships with their arthropod hosts, constitute an association of ectothermic organisms that is particularly sensitive to temperature variations. Because temperature shows pronounced natural daily fluctuations, we examined if experiments based on a constant temperature range can mask the real effects of the thermal regime on host-parasitoid interactions. The effects of two fluctuating thermal regimes on several developmental parameters of the Drosophila larval parasitoid Leptopilina boulardi were analyzed in this study. Regime 1 included a range of 16-23-16 degrees C and regime 2 included a range of 16-21-26-21-16 degrees C (mean temperature 20.1 degrees C) compared to a 20.1 degrees C constant temperature. Under an average temperature of 20.1 degrees C, which corresponds to a cold condition of L. boulardi development, we showed that the success of parasitism is significantly higher under a fluctuating temperature regime than at constant temperature. A fluctuating regime also correlated with a reduced development time of the parasitoids. In contrast, the thermal regime did not affect the ability of Drosophila to resist parasitoid infestation. Finally, we demonstrated that daily temperature fluctuation prevented the entry into diapause for this species, which is normally observed at a constant temperature of 21 degrees C. Overall, the results reveal that constant temperature experiments can produce misleading results, highlighting the need to study the thermal biology of organisms under fluctuating regimes that reflect natural conditions as closely as possible. This is particularly a major issue in host-parasitoid associations, which constitute a good model to understand the effect of climate warming on interacting species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

article,"Identification, genomic organization and expression profiles of four heat shock protein genes in the western flower thrips, <i>Frankliniella occidentalis</i>","Lu, Ming-Xing and Li, Hong-Bo and Zheng, Yu-Tao and Shi, Liang and Du, Yu-Zhou",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis, is an important invasive pest with a strong tolerance for extreme temperatures; however, the molecular mechanisms that regulate thermotolerance in this insect remain unclear. In this study, four heat shock protein genes were cloned from F. occidentalis and named Fohsp90, Fohsc701, Fohsc702 and Fohsp60. These four Hsps exhibited typical characteristics of heat shock proteins. Subcellular localization signals and phylogenetic analysis indicated that FoHsp90 and FoHsc701 localize to the cytosol, whereas FoHsc702 and FoHsp60 were located in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, respectively. Analysis of genomic sequences revealed the presence of introns in the four genes (three, four, seven, and five introns for Fohsp90, Fohsc701, Fohsc702 and Fohsp60, respectively). Both the number and position of introns in these four genes were quite different from analogous genes in other species. qRT-PCR indicated that the four Fohsps were detected in second-stage larvae, one-day-old pupae, and one-day-old adults, and mRNA expression levels were lowest in larvae and highest in pupae. Fohsc701 and Fohsc702 possessed similar expression patterns and were not induced by cold or heat stress. Expression of Fohsp60 was significantly elevated by heat, and Fohsp90 was rapidly up-regulated after exposure to both cold and heat stress. Exposure to -8 degrees C had no effect on expression of the four Fohsps; however, expression of Fohsp90 and Fohsp60 was highest after a 2-h, incubation at 39 degrees C. Furthermore, cold and heat hardening led to significant up-regulation of the four Fohsps compared to their respective controls. Collectively, our results indicate that the four FoHsps contribute to insect development and also function in rapid cold or heat hardening; furthermore, FoHsp90 and FoHsp60 contribute to thermotolerance in F. occidentalis.

H. and Macias-Cruz, Ulises",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Rectal temperature (RT) is the foremost physiological variable indicating if an animal is suffering hyperthermia. However, this variable is traditionally measured by invasive methods, which may compromise animal welfare. Models to predict RT have been developed for growing pigs and lactating dairy cows, but not for pregnant heat-stressed ewes. Our aim was to develop a prediction equation for RT using non-invasive physiological variables in pregnant ewes under heat stress. A total of 192 records of respiratory frequency (RF) and hair coat temperature in various body regions (i.e., head, rump, flank, shoulder, and belly) obtained from 24 Katandin x Pelibuey pregnant multiparous ewes were collected during the last third of gestation (i.e., d 100 to lambing) with a 15 d sampling interval. Hair coat temperatures were taken using infrared thermal imaging technology. Initially, a Pearson correlation analysis examined the relationship among variables, and then multiple linear regression analysis was used to develop the prediction equations. All predictor variables were positively correlated (P < 0.01; r=0.59-0.67) with RT. The adjusted equation which best predicted RT (P < 0.01; R-adj(2)=56.15\%; CV=0.65\%) included as predictors RF and head and belly temperatures. Comparison of predicted and observed values for RT indicates a suitable agreement (P < 0.01) between them with moderate accuracy (R-adj(2)=56.15\%) when RT was calculated with the adjusted equation. In general, the final equation does not violate any assumption of multiple regression analysis. The RT in heat-stressed pregnant ewes can be predicted with an adequate accuracy using non-invasive physiologic variables, and the final equation was: RT=35.57+0.004 (RF)+0.067 (heat temperature)+0.028 (belly temperature).

article,Extreme operative temperatures are better descriptors of the thermal environment than mean temperatures,"Camacho, Agustin and Rodrigues, Miguel Trefaut and Navas, Carlos",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In ecological studies of thermal biology the thermal environment is most frequently described using the mean or other measures of central tendency in environmental temperatures. However, this procedure may hide biologically relevant thermal variation for ectotherms, potentially misleading interpretations. Extremes of operative temperatures (EOT) can help with this problem by bracketing the thermal environment of focal animals. Within this paper, we quantify how mean operative temperatures relate to the range of simultaneously available operative temperatures (a measure of error). We also show how EOT: 1) detect more thermal differences among microsites than measures of central tendency, like the mean OT, 2) allow inferring on microsite use by ectothermic animals, and 3) clarify the relationships between field operative temperatures and temperatures measured at weather stations (WS). To do that, we explored operative temperatures measured at four sites of the Brazilian Caatingas and their correspondent nearest weather stations. We found that the daily mean OT can hide temperature ranges of 41 degrees C simultaneously available at our study sites. In addition, EOT detected more thermal differences among microsites than central quantiles. We also show how EOT allow inferring about microsite use of ectothermic animals in a given site. Finally, the daily maximum temperature and the daily temperature range measured at WSs predicted well the minimum available field OT at localities many kilometers away. Based on our results, we recommend the use of EOT, instead of mean OT, in thermal ecology studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Effect of temperature extremes on the spatial dynamics of predator-prey interactions: A case study with dragonfly nymphs and newt larvae,"Smolinsky, Radovan and Gvozdik, Lumir",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Theory predicts that predators are more vulnerable to increasing temperature than prey. Despite huge variations in the magnitude and duration of thermally-extreme episodes in nature, most empirical studies on predator-prey interactions consider conditions induced by a climatic shift in mean temperature. We asked whether the increased vulnerability of predators holds under daily thermal extremes occurring during heat waves, using dragonfly nymphs and newt larvae as the predator-prey model system. Direct exposure of predator to prey in heated and non-heated aquaria under semi-natural conditions revealed that predator movements increased with rising temperature, whereas prey activity decreased. In contrast to the theory of predator-prey space use, the spatial co-occurrence of predator and prey individuals increased with temperature, while predation rates diminished. We conclude that daily thermal extremes affect trophic interactions in the same way, i.e. through the increased vulnerability of predators, as do long-term shifts in mean environmental temperature. Our results highlight the importance of behavioral studies for understanding mechanisms mediating the effect of extreme thermal events on species interactions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of ambient temperature and body posture on regional regulation of microvascular blood flow, specifically in the arms and legs. Participants (N = 11) attended two sessions in which they experienced transient ambient conditions, in a climatic chamber. During each 60-min trial, ambient temperature increased from 15.7 (0.6) degrees C to 38.9 (0.6) degrees C followed by a linear decrease, and the participants were either standing or in a supine position throughout the trial; relative humidity in the chamber was maintained at 25.9 (6.6) \%. Laser doppler flowmetry of the forearm (SkBF(arm)) and calf (SkBF(calf)), and haemodynamic responses (heart rate, HR; stroke volume, SV; cardiac output, CO; blood pressure, BP), were measured continuously. Analyses of heart rate variability and wavelet transform were also conducted. SkBF(arm) increased significantly at higher ambient temperatures (p = 0.003), but not SkBF(calf). The standing posture caused lower overall SkBF in both regions throughout the protocol, regardless of temperature (p < 0.001). HR and BP were significantly elevated, and SV significantly lowered, in response to separate and combined effects of higher ambient temperatures and a standing position (all p < 0.05); CO remained unchanged. Mechanistic analyses identified greater sympathetic nerve activation, and higher calf myogenic activation at peak temperatures, in the standing condition.

Meanwhile, we analysed the relationship between heart and thyroid injury in human medical records to determine the association of delayed injury from cold exposure. Methods: Mice were exposed to cold stress and hysteresis injury. Gene changes at the transcriptional level were detected using high throughput sequencing technology. The most variable genes were verified at the protein level using Western Blotting and medical records were collected and analysed. Results: The damage was the most severe when the animals were allowed to recover to room temperature for 4 h after exposure to cold stress. During this process, STAT1 and ATF3 genes were acutely up -regulated. Analysis of human medical records showed the highest correlation between AST and T4 under cold stress (p = 0.0011).

Among the cooling garment developed to reduce heat strain, the ventilation jacket could be considered for possible use in workplaces, as it is wearable without limiting the user's mobility and autonomy. In this study, simulations with a sweating manikin are carried out to investigate the effects of a short-sleeved ventilation jacket on human thermophysiological responses in a warm-dry scenario. Simulations were performed in a climatic chamber (air temperature = 30.1 degrees C; air velocity = 0.29 m/s; relative humidity = 30.0 \%), considering two constant levels of metabolic rate M (M1 = 2.4 MET; M2 = 3.2 MET), a sequence of these two (Work), and three levels of fan velocities (lf = 0; lf = 2; lf = 4). The results revealed a more evident impact on the mean skin temperature (Tsk) compared to the rectal temperature (Tre), with significant decreases (compared to fan-off) at all M levels, for Tsk from the beginning and for Tre from the 61st minute. Skin temperatures of the torso zones decreased significantly (compared to fan-off) at all M levels, and a greater drop was registered for the Back. The fans at the highest level (lf = 4) were significantly effective in improving whole-body and local thermal sensations when compared to fan-off, at all M levels. At the intermediate level (lf = 2), the statistical significance varied with thermal zone, M and time interval considered. The results of the simulations also showed that the Lower Torso needs to be monitored at M2 level, as the drop in skin temperature could lead to local overcooling and thermal discomfort. Simulations showed the potential effectiveness of the ventilation jacket, but human trials are needed to verify its cooling power in real working conditions.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103772,119,NA,NA,103772,Cooling garments; Heat stress; Occupational heat strain; Thermophysiological response; Sweating manikin; Ventilation jacket

While this thermogenic capacity of skeletal muscle undoubtedly contributes to the body temperature homeostasis of animals and impacts various cellular functions, the intracellular temperature and its dynamics in skeletal muscle in vivo remain elusive. We aimed to determine the intracellular temperature and its changes within skeletal muscle in vivo during contraction and following relaxation. In addition, we tested the hypothesis that sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) generates heat and increases the myocyte temperature during a transitory Ca2+-induced contraction-relaxation cycle. The intact spinotrapezius muscle of anesthetized adult male Wistar rats (n = 18) was exteriorized and loaded with the fluorescent probe Cellular Thermoprobe for Fluorescence Ratio (49.3 mu M) by microinjection over 1 s. The fluorescence ratio (i.e., 580 nm/515 nm) was measured in vivo during 1) temperature increases induced by means of an external heater, and 2) Ca2+ injection (3.9 nL, 2.0 mM). The fluorescence ratio increased as a linear function of muscle surface temperature from 25 degrees C to 40 degrees C (r(2) = 0.97, P < 0.01). Ca2+ injection (3.9 nL, 2.0 mM) significantly increased myocyte intracellular temperature: An effect that was suppressed by SERCA inhibition with cyclopiazonic acid (CPA, Ca2+: 38.3 +/- 1.4 degrees C vs Ca2++CPA: 28.3 +/- 2.8 degrees C, P < 0.01 at 1 min following injection). While muscle shortening occurred immediately after the Ca2+ injection, the increased muscle temperature was maintained during the relaxation phase. In this investigation, we demonstrated a novel model for measuring the intracellular temperature of skeletal muscle in vivo and further that heat generation occurs concomitant principally with SERCA functioning and muscle relaxation.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103760,119,NA,NA,103760,Calcium ion; Sarcoplasmic reticulum; Muscle contraction

Urban parks can absorb sunlight radiation, which reduces air temperature, improving urban microclimates. Various factors in the park are confirmed to be effective in heat mitigation. However, there are few studies on thermal comfort in urban mountain parks, and mountain areas might cause peculiar climatic conditions owing to their particular landforms. To fill this gap in the research, this study explored thermal comfort in mountain parks and the environmental factors that would affect thermal comfort. A field measurement in the summertime (July \& August) of 2018, it was found that trees, the river, and the area of parks could adjust the thermal comforts of mountain parks. Their effects varied throughout the day, and the impacts of trees were most pronounced at noon and late afternoon, while the influence of rivers and park areas was most pronounced at noon. Increasing the leaf area index by 1 point could result in decreases in physiological equivalent temperature, land surface temperature, and solar radiation level by 3.90 degrees C, 2.69 degrees C, and 270.10 W/m2, respectively.

article,An individualized and multi-segmental bioheat model for predicting local conditions of the human body under various thermal environments,"Afzalian, Mahdi and Zolfaghari, Seyed Alireza",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Thermoregulatory bioheat models have attracted the attention of researchers due to their conformity with the basis of human thermal perception. For this reason, various models have been presented, such as simplified thermoregulatory bioheat (STB), individualized thermoregulatory bioheat (ITB), and multi-segmental thermoregulatory bioheat (MSTB). In the present study and based upon previous models, an individual multi-segment thermoregulatory bioheat (IMTB) model has been introduced. In this model, the body is subdivided into 17 segments and 3 layers, with the blood circulatory system consisting of arteries, veins, and superficial veins. Also, IMTB can evaluate the individual parameters effects (such as height, weight, gender, and age) on physiological parameters and active/passive systems. Finally, this new model was evaluated in human thermal response predictions over a wide range of transient and steady-state environmental conditions (5.0< T-air(degrees C) <50.0, 31.0 < RH (\%)<70.0) and various individual characteristics (male and female, 20 < age (years) < 69, 50<weight (kg) < 92, and 1.5<height(m) < 1.9). The results indicated that the new model agreed well with empirical data and the average mean absolute error (MAE) was 0.1, 0.5, and 0.3 degrees C for core, local, and mean skin temperature, respectively.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103708,117,NA,NA,103708,Thermoregulatory bioheat model; Individual characteristics; Multi -segment; Blood circulatory system; Transient thermal environment; Local skin temperature
article,TRPV1 inactivation alters core body temperature and serum corticosterone levels: Impacts on clock genes expression in the liver and adrenal glands,"Horta, Nayara AC. and Fernandes, Paola and Cardoso, Thais SR. and Machado, Frederico SM. and Drummond, Lucas R. and Coimbra, Candido C. and Wanner, Samuel P. and Castrucci, Ana Maria L. and Poletini, Maristela O.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Purpose: TRPV1 desensitization or blockade promotes hyperthermia in rodents. Daily changes in core body temperature (Tc), spontaneous locomotor activity (SLA), and glucocorticoids are temporal cues for peripheral clocks. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of both desensitization and blockade of TRPV1 on Tc, SLA, blood corticosterone, and the clock genes Per1 and Bmal1 in the liver and adrenal.Methods and Results: Resiniferatoxin (RTX, 20 mu g kg-1) known to desensitize the intra-abdominal TRPV1 channels was i. p. administered in adult male rats. One day after, RTX rats displayed higher Tc than vehicle rats (control) in the light and dark phases. RTX rats showed higher corticosterone at zeitgeber time (ZT) 6 and ZT12 compared to ZT0. Control rats showed a rise in corticosterone at ZT12. RTX abolished the Per1 peak in both the liver and adrenal glands, whereas it enhanced the peak of Bmal1 expression in the liver and decreased it in adrenal glands. Circadian variation in Tc and SLA was unaffected despite higher Tc being found along the light phase up to 5 days after RTX injection. Acute blockade of TRPV1 with the antagonist AMG-517 injected at ZT0 increased Tc and reduced corticosterone without affecting SLA. In the liver, while AMG-517 did not affect Per1, it increased Bmal1 mRNA. In adrenal glands, AMG-517 increased Per1 and did not affect Bmal1 expression. Although rats exposed to a 60-min 34 degrees C environment showed similar hyperthermia to that observed in AMG-517 rats, neither corticosterone nor liver nor adrenal clock genes changed.Conclusions: Inactivation of TRPV1 by abdominal desensitization or by antagonism alters the time-of-day changes of clock genes expression in the liver and adrenal, as well as corticosterone. TRPV1 may be necessary for signaling cyclical temporal cues for clock genes in the periphery but less critical for the circadian profile of Tc and SLA.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103514,114,NA,NA,103514,Suprachiasmatic nucleus; Circadian rhythm; Peripheral clocks; Temperature; Hyperthermia; Desensitization

The decision regarding the optimal cooling vest/concept for a specific environment can be challenging by relying solely on the information provided by the manufacturers. The aim of this study was to investigate how different types of cooling vests would manifest/perform in a simulated industrial setting, in a warm and moderately humid environment with low air velocity. Methods: Ten young males completed six experimental trials, including a control trial (no vest) and five trials with vests of different cooling concepts. Once entering the climatic chamber (ambient temperature: 35 degrees C, relative humidity: 50 \%), participants remained seated for 30 min to induce passive heating, after which they donned a cooling vest and started a 2.5-h of walk at 4.5 km.h- 1. During the trial, torso skin temperature (Tsk), microclimate temperature (Tmicro) and relative hu-midity (RHmicro), as well as core temperature (rectal and gastrointestinal; Tc) and heart rate (HR) were measured. Before and after the walk, participants conducted different cognitive tests and provided subjective ratings throughout the walk. Results: The use of the vests attenuated the increase in HR (103 +/- 12 bpm) when compared to control trial (116 +/- 17 bpm, p < 0.05). Four vests maintained a lower torso Tsk (31.7 +/- 1.5 degrees C) compared to control trial (36.1 +/- 0.5 degrees C, p < 0.05). Two vests using PCM inserts attenuated the increase in Tc between 0.2 and 0.5 degrees C in relation to control trial (p < 0.05). Cognitive performance remained unchanged between the trials. Physiological responses were also well reflected in subjective reports. Conclusion: Most vests could be considered as an adequate mitigation strategy for workers in industry under the conditions simulated in the present study.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103442,112,NA,NA,103442,Personal cooling strategies; Cooling vests; Cooling concepts; Cooling capacity; Heat stress; Industry workers
article,Short-term acclimation dynamics in a coldwater fish,"Stewart, Erin M. C. and Frasca, Vince R. and Wilson, Chris C. and Raby, Graham D.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Critical thermal maximum (CTmax) is widely used for measuring thermal tolerance but the strong effect of acclimation on CTmax is a likely source of variation within and among studies/species that makes comparisons more difficult. There have been surprisingly few studies focused on quantifying how quickly acclimation occurs or that combine temperature and duration effects. We studied the effects of absolute temperature difference and duration of acclimation on CTmax of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), a well-studied species in the thermal biology literature, under laboratory conditions to determine how each of the two factors and their combined effects influence critical thermal maximum. Using an ecologically-relevant range of temperatures and testing CTmax multiple times between one and 30 days, we found that both temperature and duration of acclimation had strong effects on CTmax. As predicted, fish that were exposed to warmer temperatures longer had increased CTmax, but full acclimation (i.e., a plateau in CTmax) did not occur by day 30. Therefore, our study provides useful context for thermal biologists by demonstrating that the CTmax of fish can continue to acclimate to a new temperature for at least 30 days. We recommend that this be considered in future studies measuring thermal tolerance that intend to have their organisms fully acclimated to a given temperature. Our results also support using detailed thermal acclimation information to reduce uncertainty caused by local or seasonal acclimation effects and to improve the use of CTmax data for fundamental research and conservation planning.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103482,112,NA,NA,103482,Thermal tolerance; Salmonid; Plasticity; Climate change; Thermal variation; LT50; Incipient lethal temperature
article,"Skin temperature normalizes faster than pressure pain thresholds, pain intensity, and pain distribution during recovery from eccentric exercise","Domenech-Garcia, Victor and Boudreau, Shellie Ann and Giner-Nicolas, Rafael and Bellosta-Lopez, Pablo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Introduction: Acute musculoskeletal injuries have diverse symptomatology and a multidimensional recovery process, including changes in swelling, redness, hyperalgesia, and expanded pain distribution. In a small pro-portion of cases, the tissue heals, although these symptoms persist, reflecting altered peripheral and central pain mechanisms. However, the otherwise healthy multidimensional recovery process following damage and pain is less than clear. The objective was to assess mechanical muscle hyperalgesia, skin temperature, and pain intensity and distribution during the recovery process in response to eccentric exercise in the hamstring muscles.Methods: Twenty-four healthy males participated in four sessions (Day-0, Day-2, Day-4, and Day-7). Exercise-induced muscle soreness was induced on Day-0 by five sets of 20 repetitions of an eccentric exercise involving the hamstrings on the dominant leg. Each session included assessments of thermography, pressure pain thresholds (PPTs), pain intensity, and area of exercise-induced pain.Results: Decreased PPTs (P < 0.005), higher pain intensity (P < 0.001), and a larger area of pain (P < 0.001) were displayed on Day-2 and Day-4 than Day-0. Skin temperature decreased on Day-2 than Day-0 (P < 0.01) and returned to baseline assessments by Day-4, despite lower temperature than the contralateral tight (P < 0.01). Further, there was a positive correlation between pain intensity and area on Day-2 and Day-4 (P < 0.005), but no for changes in skin temperature.Conclusion: Thermographic changes and pain-related variables altered following eccentric exercise demonstrate different recovery times.

The present work aimed to examine the rumen mi-crobes, rumen fermentation profile, and relationships between the rumen microbiota, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and markers of WAT browning and are thus conducive to exploring the plateau environment adapt-ability of Mongolian sheep in the cold season. A comparative analysis of the rumen microbes and SCFAs in the cold and warm seasons was conducted. Rumen microbes were analyzed using Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Ruminal SCFAs were determined by gas chromatography. Spearman's correlation test was used to determine the relationships between the rumen microbiota, SCFAs, and markers of WAT browning. Microbial 16S rRNA sequencing revealed a marked shift in rumen microbiota composition between the two seasons, and the bacteria were characterized by increased levels of the Actinobacteria and genera Christensenellaceae R-7 group, Ruminococcaceae UCG-011, Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group, Papillibacter, and Butyrivibrio 2 and reduced levels of Prevotella 1 and Ruminococcaceae UCG-014 in the cold season (P<0.05). Furthermore, the concentrations of SCFAs such as acetate and butyrate were significantly increased in the cold season (P<0.001 and P<0.05, respectively). Correlation analysis demonstrated that the relative abundances of the Actinobacteria and the genera Christensenellaceae R-7 group, Butyrivibrio 2, Ruminococcaceae UCG-002, and Ruminococcaceae UCG-011, identified as members of the Christensenellaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminococcaceae families (all within Fir-micutes), were positively correlated with markers of browning in either retroperitoneal WAT or perirenal WAT, and acetate was positively correlated with Ruminococcaceae UCG-011 and Butyrivibrio 2 and markers of browning in either retroperitoneal WAT or perirenal WAT.

Although hibernation physiology and ecology of Nanorana parkeri, a frog species native to the Tibetan plateau, has been well studied, little information is available about the physiological and biochemical responses to acute rising temperature. Here, we conducted an acute warming experiment comparing hibernating N. parkeri (acclimated at 4 degrees C) and frogs acutely warmed to 10 degrees C for 12 h, comparing indicators of oxidative stress and antioxidant defense between the two groups. Acute warming led to a significant increase in the content of oxidized glutathione and the ratio of oxidized:reduced glutathione in liver and muscle, indicating that rapid warming causing oxidative stress could be a negative factor for frogs inhabiting the Tibetan plateau. Malon-dialdehyde content increased by 57\% only in muscle but decreased significantly in three tissues. Protein carbonyl groups rose by 15\% in brain, 28\% in liver, and 21\% in muscle after heat exposure but vitamin C content in heart decreased by 44\%. Acute heat exposure also induced tissue-specific upregulation of antioxidant enzyme activ-ities. Catalase activity increased by 27\% in heat-exposed frogs, as compared to controls, and glutathione peroxidase activity rose by 12\% in brain, 30\% in liver, and 12\% in muscle. Glutathione-S-transferase activity was also enhanced in heart and muscle of heat-exposed frogs. Acute warming also resulted in a rise in total anti-oxidant capacity in all tissues examined except kidney, relative to controls. In summary, our findings show that acute heat exposure to hibernating N. parkeri causes a tissue-specific increase in oxidative damage and antiox-idant defenses, with skeletal muscle being the most affected tissue.

However, the role and mechanism of the new factor that up-regulates the heat-generating capacity of brown adipose tissue is still unclear. Here, we found that hepatitis C virus core binding protein 6 (HCBP6), as a key regulator gene in the homeostasis of liver lipid metabolism, is an important enhancer for activating brown fat to ensure thermogenesis. HCBP6 upregulates the expression of UCP1 and increases the number of mitochondria in brown adipocytes. In the BAT of HCBP6-knockout mice induced by a high-fat diet, UCP1 and BAT activity-related genes Pgc1 alpha, Cidea and oxidation phosphorylation-related genes (OXPHOS) were significantly reduced. In addition, the transcriptomics results show that the loss of HCBP6 caused disorder of the metabolic pathway, the expression of brown adipocyte development genes was signifi-cantly reduced, and the expression of most BAT cytokine genes was reduced. In conclusion, HCBP6 increased ucp1-dependent thermogenesis in BAT and improved liver lipid metabolism, possibly by enhancing the activity of brown fat and changing the expression of BAT cytokine genes.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103306,109,NA,NA,103306,HCBP6; Brown adipose tissue; UCP1; Cytokine

Clubiona spiders are very abundant in orchards and have been observed to be active during winter. Here, we performed laboratory experiments to assess the movement and predation activity of clubionids at low temperatures. In addition, we also assessed prey survival (psyllids and crickets). We revealed that Clubiona spiders actively moved even at a temperature below 0 degrees C. Pest prey (Cacopsylla sp.) was able to survive at low temperatures, but crickets died at 3 and-1 degrees C. Overall Clubiona activity was very low but present during the whole observation period of five days. The predation activity of Clubiona declined with lower temperatures for both cricket and pest (Cacopsylla sp.) prey. Nevertheless, 44\% and 25\% Clubiona individuals captured and consumed psyllid and cricket prey, respectively, even at the lowest temper-ature of-1 degrees C.

Scientific evidence about skin temperature evolution during the 24-h period immediately after exer-cising is, however, scarce. The aim was to assess the effect of a 10 km run at moderate intensity on baseline skin temperature and thermal response after a cold stress test during that 24 h period. Fourteen participants were measured before, immediately after, and at 2, 5, 9 and 24 h after a 10 km run at a perceived exertion rate of 11 points (max 20 points). Fourteen control participants who undertook no exercise were also measured during that day. The measurements included muscle pain and fatigue perception, reactive oxygen species, heart rate vari-ability, skin temperature of the lower limbs, and skin temperature after cold stress test. Exercise resulted in a skin temperature increase (e.g., 0.5-1.3 degrees C of posterior leg 9 h after exercise) and this effect continued in some regions (0.4-0.9 ?C of posterior leg) over that 24 h period. However, the thermal response to the cold stress test remained the same (p > 0.05). In conclusion, 10 km aerobic running exercise results in a skin temperature increase, peaking at between 5 and 9 h after exercise, but does not alter the thermal response to a cold stress test.

article,The seasonal variation of basal metabolic rate is related to the expression of torpor among small mammals,"Genoud, Michel",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"A variety of responses to climate seasonality have evolved by small mammals, including adjustments of the basal rate of metabolism (BMR) and the use of daily or seasonal torpor (here referred to as short-bout and long-bout torpor). The seasonal variation of their BMR is known to depend mainly on the concurrent variation of body mass, but it should also be affected by structural and functional changes occurring within the body that could depend on the expression of torpor. Thus it was hypothesized that BMR seasonality is related to the expression of torpor at an interspecific level. Seasonal BMR and body mass data were gathered from the literature and phylogenetic comparative analyses were done to test this hypothesis among mammals of less than 1 kg. BMR seasonality (dBMR) was quantified as the log-transformed ratio of the mean whole-animal BMR reported for the period P2 (autumn-winter) over that for the period P1 (spring-summer). Predictors were the seasonal body mass adjustment (dm), mean body mass (m) and torpor expression (TO, a three-level factor: no torpor, short-bout torpor, long-bout torpor). The seasonal variation of BMR was significantly related to dm but also to TO. Accounting for dm, species expressing long-bout torpor, but not those entering short-bout torpor, collectively exhibited a lower dBMR than species not entering torpor. Fat storage and use by species entering long-bout torpor, alone, could not explain their lower dBMR, as the TO:dm interaction was not significant. The low dBMR of species entering long-bout torpor may result from their collective tendency to down-regulate more strongly costly visceral organs during P2. The dBMR of the different TO categories overlapped appreciably, which highlights our still limited knowledge of the BMR seasonality among small mammals.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103197,104,NA,NA,103197,BMR; Seasonality; Hibernation; Daily torpor; Heterothermy; Phenotypic flexibility

Surprisingly, the erythrocyte's morphology did not show significant differences between the two experimental conditions, returning similar results in control fish stabled at -0.9 degrees C and in the fish treated at +0.6 degrees C, although the values of the shape descriptors were often lower in the latter. This study demonstrates the critical issues of comparative physiology in the study of extremely sensitive organisms, such as the fish of the High Antarctic Zone. Moreover, the stabling effect inside the aquarium facilities appears to significantly obscure the effects of the experimental heat treatment.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103139,103,NA,NA,103139,Trematomus bemacchii; Stabling; Shape descriptors; Biomarker

In the present study, 32-day-old Ross 308 broiler chickens were subjected to 37 degrees C environmental temperature combined with 50\% relative humidity for 4 or 8 h respectively. Following sampling, redox parameters such as malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), protein carbonyl levels as well as glutathione pemxidase activity were assessed in liver, spleen, and kidney homogenates. The concentrations of small heat shock proteins (sHSP-s) HSP27, alpha A- and alpha B-crystallins were also investigated. Among these organs, the liver was found the most susceptible to heat-provoked oxidative stress, indicated by enhanced lipid peroxidation and rapid activation of protective pathways, including the definite increase of glutathione peroxidase activity and the excessive utilization of (alpha A- and alpha B-crystallin proteins. Heat-associated decline of protein carbonylation and GSH content was observed in the liver in correlation with the increased involvement of (alpha A- and alpha B-crystallins in cellular defense, resulting supposedly in an over-compensation mechanism.

Mahiuddin and Islam, S. M. Majharul and Ashaf-Ud-Doulah, Mohammad and Ando, Hironori",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Water temperature alone can affect the growth, metabolic rates and physiological responses of aquatic organisms. Our earlier study reported that higher temperature affects cellular and hemato-biochemical responses in rohu, Labeo rohita. In this backdrop, the present study assessed the effect of higher acclimation temperature on the regulatory mechanisms of growth and stress responses of juvenile L. rohita acclimatized in three temperature conditions (30 degrees C, 33 degrees C, and 36 degrees C) for a period of 30 days. The relative expression of genes for growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factors (IGF-1 and IGF-2) and heat shock proteins (hsp70 and hsp90) were measured by real-time quantitative PCR. The results revealed that the highest acclimation temperature (36 degrees C) significantly decreased the weight gain (WG) and specific growth rate (SGR), and increased the feed conversion ratio (FCR) compared to 30 degrees C (control), while increased WG, SGR and lowered FCR were observed in fish reared at the intermediate temperature (33 degrees C) compared to 30 degrees C. Similarly, the GH gene expression in the pituitary was significantly decreased and increased at 36 degrees C and 33 degrees C, respectively as compared to 30 degrees C. A significantly lower expression of IGF-1 and IGF-2, and higher expression of hsp70 and hsp90 were observed in the liver of fish at 36 degrees C. The results of the present study indicate that although slightly elevated temperature promotes the growth of juvenile L. rohita, the higher acclimation temperature may induce stress response and impair growth performance by suppressing GH/IGF system.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103032,100,NA,NA,103032,High temperature; Growth; Heat shock protein; Growth hormone; Insulin-like growth factor

In this study, the effects of temperature, DO, and their interaction on the growth, antioxidant status, digestive enzyme activity, serum biochemical parameters, and liver IGF-1 expression in rainbow trout were evaluated. Fish (initial weight, 109.98 +/- 3.28 g) were reared in a recirculating system for 4 weeks and subjected to 6 treatments at three temperatures (13 degrees C, 17 degrees C, and 21 degrees C) and two DO contents (4.2 mg L-1 and 9.6 mg L-1). Physiological parameters were determined at the end of the trial. Specific growth rate and feed consumption were the highest at 17 degrees C and the lowest at 21 degrees C. Additionally, lysozyme, trypsin, lipase, and amylase activities, serum glucose and serum triglyceride contents, and IGF-1 expression decreased significantly at 21 degrees C and total serum protein and albumin contents were significantly higher at 21 degrees C than at 13 degrees C and 17 degrees C, indicating that high temperature impaired the immunity, digestion, and growth of rainbow trout. However, the adverse effects of high temperature can be alleviated by a high DO content, as evidenced by the smaller increments and decrements of these parameters under hyperoxic conditions than under hypoxic conditions. In response to high temperature stress, an increase in antioxidant enzyme activity led to the removal of oxygen free radicals under hyperoxic conditions; however, this increase was inhibited under hypoxia.

article,The hotter the better? Climate change and voltinism of<i> Spodoptera</i><i> eridania</i> estimated with different methods,"Sampaio, Fabio and Krechemer, Flavia S. and Marchioro, Cesar A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Substantial increases in global temperature are projected for the coming decades due to climate change. Considering that temperature has a strong influence on insect voltinism (i.e., number of generations per year), climate change may affect the population growth of insects, with potential consequences for food production. The southern armyworm, Spodoptera eridania, is a multivoltine species native to the American tropics that causes severe damage to several crops. In this context, this study evaluated the impacts of climate change on the voltinism of S. eridania in southern Brazil. Current and future daily temperature data were combined with non-linear and degree-day models to estimate the voltinism of this pest. Under current climate conditions, the voltinism of S. eridania ranged from 2.9 to 9.2 generations, with fewer cohorts in colder regions and more in warmer ones. A higher number of generations was predicted for the future climate scenarios evaluated, reaching up to 12.1 annual generations in certain regions by 2070. Most of the variation in voltinism was explained by location (87.7\%) and by the interaction between location and mathematical model (3.0\%). The degree-day model estimated an increase in the number of generations in the entire study area, while the non-linear model predicted a decrease in voltinism in the warmer regions under future climate change scenarios. Given these differences between the predictions provided by degree-day and non-linear models, the selection of the best method to be used in climate change studies should be carried out carefully, considering how species respond to temperature. A considerable increase in the number of generations of S. eridania was projected for most of the study area under the climate change scenarios evaluated, suggesting a possible rise in pest incidence levels in the coming decades.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102946,98,NA,NA,102946,Degree-day model; Development rate models; Global warming; Non-linear models; Number of generations; Population growth

Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction appear to play key roles in muscle injury caused by HS. We hypothesized that mitoquinol (MitoQ), would alleviate oxidative stress and cellular dysfunction in skeletal muscle during HS. To address this, crossbred barrows (male pigs) were treated with placebo or MitoQ (40 mg/d) and were then exposed to thermoneutral (TN; 20 ?C) or HS (35 ?C) conditions for 24 h. Pigs were euthanized following the environmental challenge and the red portion of the semitendinosus (STR) was collected for analysis. Unexpectedly, malondialdehyde concentration, an oxidative stress marker, was similar between environmental and supplement treatments. Heat stress decreased LC3A/B?I (p < 0.05) and increased the ratio of LC3A/B-II/I (p < 0.05), while p62 was similar among groups suggesting increased degradation of autophagosomes during HS. These outcomes were in disagreement with our previous results in muscle from gilts (female pigs). To probe the impact of biological sex on HS-mediated injury in skeletal muscle, we compared STR from these barrows to archived STR from gilts subjected to a similar environmental intervention. We confirmed our previous findings of HS-mediated dysfunction in muscle from gilts but not barrows. These data also raise the possibility that muscle from gilts is more susceptible to environment-induced hyperthermia than muscle from barrows.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102900,97,NA,NA,102900,Autophagy; Hyperthermia; Mitochondria; MitoQ; Oxidative stress

However, we do not know if these methods show a close agreement with the total rate of cutaneous evaporative water loss derived from the weighing system (i.e., the gold standard method). We therefore combined a high-precision weighing system and flow through respirometry to accurately quantify the cutaneous evaporative water loss rates in shaded heifers, while simultaneously recording parallel data obtained from a flow-through ventilated capsule, and a closed colorimetric paper disc chamber. Least square means of the local surface-specific cutaneous evaporative water loss rate (g m(-2) h(-1)) derived from the colorimetric paper discs and ventilated capsules show close agreement to the total rate of surface-specific cutaneous evaporative water loss (g m(-2) h(-1)) derived from the weighing method. Likewise, fitted linear regression lines also showed that they were well correlated (e.g., R-2 = 0.93 and r = 0.96 for ventilated capsule vs weighing method; and R-2 = 0.81 and r = 0.91 for colorimetric paper discs vs weighing method). However, the mean square deviation revealed various sources of disagreement between the local measurements and those derived from the weighing method, in which the local rate of cutaneous evaporative water loss derived from colorimetric paper discs showed greater deviation. In conclusion, given the importance of cutaneous evaporative water loss for assessing temperature requirements and heat tolerance of cattle, our findings show large discrepancies derived from the closed colorimetric paper discs chamber when compared with parallel data derived from the gold standard method, which is sufficient to call into question previous findings obtained by employing such methods.

Thirty-two adult male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: a control (CON) group and three groups that were subjected to an 8-week aerobic training, during which the physical overload was achieved by predominantly increasing the exercise intensity (INT), duration (DUR) or by increasing both in an alternate manner (ID). During the last week of training, the rats received an abdominal sensor implant to measure their core body temperature (T-CORE) by telemetry. After the training protocol, the 32 rats were subjected to incremental speed-exercises in temperate (23 degrees C) and warm (32 degrees C) environments. The rats had their T-CORE recorded while running on a treadmill, and the ratio between the increase in T-CORE and distance traveled was calculated to estimate thermoregulatory efficiency. All training protocols increased the rats' thermoregulatory efficiency during the incremental-speed exercise at 23 degrees C; i.e., trained rats attained faster running speeds but unchanged T-CORE at fatigue compared to CON rats. However, none of the load components of training sessions - intensity or duration - was more effective than the other in improving this efficiency. At 32 degrees C, the aerobic training protocols did not influence the exercise-induced thermoregulatory responses. Our data indicate that different progressions in aerobic training performed at temperate conditions improved thermoregulatory efficiency during incremental exercise in the same environment; this training-induced adaptation was not clearly observed when running in warmer conditions.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102878,97,NA,NA,102878,Endurance; Fatigue; Heat; Performance; Temperature; Thermoregulation; Training load; Treadmill running
article,"The thermal acclimation potential of maximum heart rate and cardiac heat tolerance in Arctic char (<i>Salvelinus alpinus</i>), a northern cold-water specialist","Gilbert, Matthew J. H. and Farrell, Anthony P.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Increasing heart rate (f(H)) is a central, if not primary mechanism used by fishes to support their elevated tissue oxygen consumption during acute warming. Thermal acclimation can adjust this acute response to improve cardiac performance and heat tolerance under the prevailing temperatures. We predict that such acclimation will be particularly important in regions undergoing rapid environmental change such as the Arctic. Therefore, we acclimated Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), a high latitude, cold-adapted salmonid, to ecologically relevant temperatures (2, 6, 10, 14 and 18 degrees C) and examined how thermal acclimation influenced their cardiac heat tolerance by measuring the maximum heart rate (f(Hmax)) response to acute warming. As expected, acute warming increased f(Hmax) in all Arctic char before f(Hmax) reached a peak and then became arrhythmic. The peak f(Hmax), and the temperature at which peak fax (T-peak) and that at which arrhythmia first occurred (T(ar)r) all increased progressively (+33\%, 49\% and 35\%, respectively) with acclimation temperature from 2 to 14 degrees C. When compared at the same test temperature fax also decreased by as much as 29\% with increasing acclimation temperature, indicating significant thermal compensation. The upper temperature at which fish first lost their equilibrium (critical thermal maximum: CTmax) also increased with acclimation temperature, albeit to a lesser extent (+11\%). Importantly, Arctic char experienced mortality after several weeks of acclimation at 18 degrees C and survivors did not have elevated cardiac thermal tolerance. Collectively, these findings suggest that if wild Arctic char have access to suitable temperatures (<18 degrees C) for a sufficient duration, warm acclimation can potentially mitigate some of the cardiorespiratory impairments previously documented during acute heat exposure.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102816,95,NA,NA,102816,Heat tolerance; Arctic climate change; Cardiorespiratory; Arctic char; Thermal acclimation; Environmental physiology

Here, we analyze the thermal plastic response of laboratory populations of Drosophila subobscura, derived from two contrasting latitudes of the European dine. We measured reproductive performance through fecundity characters, after the experimental populations were exposed to five thermal treatments, with different combinations of developmental and adult temperatures (14 degrees C, 18 degrees C, or 26 degrees C). Our questions were whether (1) adult performance changes with exposure to higher (or lower) temperatures during development; (2) flies raised at lower temperatures outperform those developed at higher ones, supporting the ``colder is better{''} hypothesis; (3) there is a cumulative effect on adult performance of exposing both juveniles and adults to higher (or lower) temperatures; (4) there is evidence for biogeographical effects on adult performance. Our main findings were that (1) higher developmental temperatures led to low reproductive performance regardless of adult temperature, while at lower temperatures reduced performance only occurred when colder conditions were persistent across juvenile and adult stages; (2) flies raised at lower temperatures did not always outperform those developed at other temperatures; (3) there were no harmful cumulative effects after exposing both juveniles and adults to higher temperatures; (4) both latitudinal populations showed similar thermal plasticity patterns.

Seventeen recreational male runners performed two 15 min running tests in the same session. In the first test, participants performed running without modifying their running technique (control condition). In the second running test, they repeated the same protocol using an ankle weight of 1.5 kg in the non-dominant ankle (asymmetrical condition). Rate of perceive exertion, heart rate and spatio-temporal parameters were measured during the running tests. Skin temperature was measured with an infrared camera before and after each condition. Generally, comparing both lower limbs, non-preferred limb (with the ankle weight) had lower contact time (p < 0.001 and ES > 0.8), higher stride length (p < 0.05 and ES > 0.3) and higher stride frequency in asymmetrical condition (p < 0.01 and ES > 0.4). However, no differences were observed on skin temperature between both feet in the two conditions in any of the regions of interest assessed (p > 0.05). Although the asymmetry generation model used provoked technical asymmetries in spatio-temporal parameters during running, no thermal asymmetries were observed between preferred and non-preferred sole of the foot.

article,Critical thermal maxima of early life stages of three tropical fishes: Effects of rearing temperature and experimental heating rate,"Illing, B. and Downie, A. T. and Beghin, M. and Rummer, J. L.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Marine ectotherms are often sensitive to thermal stress, and certain life stages can be particularly vulnerable (e. g., larvae or spawners). In this study, we investigated the critical thermal maxima (CTmax) of larval and early juvenile life stages of three tropical marine fishes (Acanthochromis polyacanthus, Amphiprion melanopus, and Lates calcarifer). We tested for potential effects of developmental acclimation, life stage, and experimental heating rates, and we measured metabolic enzyme activities from aerobic (citrate synthase, CS) and anaerobic pathways (lactate dehydrogenase, LDH). A slightly elevated rearing temperature neither influenced CTmax nor CS activity, which otherwise could have indicated thermal acclimation. However, we found CTmax to either remain stable (Acanthrochromis polyacanthus) or increase with body mass during early ontogeny (Amphiprion melanopus and Lates calcarifer). In all three species, faster heating rates lead to higher CTmax. Acute temperature stress did not change CS or LDH activities, suggesting that overall aerobic and anaerobic metabolism remained stable. Lates calcarifer, a catadromous species that migrates from oceanic to riverine habitats upon metamorphosis, had higher CTmax than the two coral reef fish species. We highlight that, for obtaining conservative estimates of a fish species' upper thermal limits, several developmental stages and body mass ranges should be examined. Moreover, upper thermal limits should be assessed using standardized heating rates. This will not only benefit comparative approaches but also aid in assessing geographic (re-) distributions and climate change sensitivity of marine fishes.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102582,90,NA,NA,102582,Coral reefs; Fish larvae; Development; Upper thermal limit; Metabolic enzymes
article,Functional adaptation rather than ecogeographical rules determine body-size metrics along a thermal cline with elevation in the Chinese pygmy dormouse (<i>Typhlomys cinereus</i>),"Cui, Jifa and Lei, Boyu and Newman, Chris and Ji, Shengnan and Su, Huawei and Buesching, Christina D. and Macdonald, David W. and Zhou, Youbing",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Phenotypic plasticity is crucial for how organisms respond to variation in their environment, affecting their diversity and distribution, especially in the light of rapid environmental change. Ecogeographical rules predict an association between specific adaptive morphological and physiological traits with cooler conditions due to higher latitude, elevation, or climate change. Such ecogeographical effects are often most evident in ancient species due to continuous selective adaptation occurring over long periods of time. Here, we use the suitably ancient Chinese pygmy dormouse (Typhlomys cinereus) to test whether body-size, appendage length and heart size vary in accordance with Bergmann's, Allen's and Hesse's rule, respectively. Based on a sample of 67 adult individuals (female, n = 29; male n = 38) trapped at 37 sites transcending an elevational range from 414 to 1757 m, we tested for trait concordance with Bergmann's rule (body mass, length and SMI), Allen's rule (length of tail, foot, ear, snout), and Hesse's rule (wet and dry heart mass). Effects of elevation (and thus temperature lapse rate; calculated as 0.61 degrees C per 100 m) on body size, appendage length and heart size, were tested by fitting Standardized Major Axis (SMA) models. We observed substantial heterogeneity in morphometric traits allowing for the detection of ecogeographical clines. However, none conformed with Bergmann's, Allen's (except ear size), or Hesse's rule. However, our results indicate some support for Geist's rule of net primary productivity. We conclude that pervasive functional life-history adaptations in this blind, arboreal, echolocating ancient species exceeded selection for morphological energy efficiency constraints, with the notable exception of reduced ear pinnae size at colder, elevated sites.

The TMBIM6 gene was amplified and searched for variation in three different goat populations (i.e. Black Bengal, Ganjam and Raighar) of Odisha state of the India. The result indicated two substitutions i.e. 55th position (C55T) and 95th position (C95A) in the amplified region of the gene resulting in change of amino acids (Leu > Phe and Thr > Asn). The identified SNPs were combined to form haplotypes and animals were grouped accordingly. Structural analysis showed minor changes (5\%) in between mutant and wild TMBIM6 protein structures. However, any functional variation could not be identified with respect to the calcium ligand and open pore state. But an alteration of calcium binding site was found. The binding interaction of calcium with the TMBIM6 protein was hydrophobic in nature in closed state whereas hydrophilic in open pore stage. The stress releasing function was the result of calcium leakage controlled by amino acids coded by exon 4 and exon 5 regions of TMBIM6 gene. The effect of breed and haplotype on cardiopulmonary traits was studied.

article,Growth and physiological responses in largemouth bass populations to environmental warming: Effects of inhabiting chronically heated environments,"White, Dalon P. and Wahl, David H.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Ectotherms are susceptible to increasing environmental temperatures associated with anthropogenic warming. Supra-optimum temperatures lead to declining aerobic capacity and can increase exposure to lethal temperatures, resulting in reduced performance. Although the capacity of phenotypic plasticity to minimize the effects of temperature on physiological processes is well studied, evidence of generational changes (e.g. transgenerational plasticity and rapid adaptation) in response to environmental warming is limited in natural populations. We investigated metabolism, growth, and thermal tolerance of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) populations inhabiting thermally altered lakes (i.e. power plant cooling lakes) which have year-round elevated temperature regimes and exhibit supra-optimum temperatures on a yearly basis, and compared these traits with those in largemouth bass populations from ambient lakes. Largemouth bass from ambient and heated groups (n = 3 populations per group) were spawned in an ambient, common garden pond environment, then acclimated to either a normal summertime temperature (24 degrees C) or a supra-optimum temperature (30 degrees C). Fish from heated populations had significant reductions in the resting metabolic rate at both temperatures and markedly increased growth rates at 30 degrees C. By comparing pond-raised fish to fish removed directly from heated lakes, we showed that developmental plasticity played little role in establishing the metabolic rate. A lower resting metabolic rate contributed to an increase in the conversion efficiency of food to biomass of largemouth bass from heated lakes, regardless of temperature. Despite inhabiting heated lakes for many decades, neither critical thermal maximum nor minimum were altered in heated populations when raised in a common garden environment. These results suggest that largemouth bass can lessen sub-lethal effects of warming by altering physiological processes to reduce the impact of warming on aerobic scope and that these changes are generationally transient, but changes in maximum thermal tolerance in response to warming is limited to phenotypic plasticity.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102467,88,NA,NA,102467,Largemouth bass; Metabolism; Climate change; Adaptation; Growth; Thermal tolerance
article,Urban heat islands advance the timing of reproduction in a social insect,"Chick, Lacy D. and Strickler, Stephanie A. and Perez, Abe and Martin, Ryan A. and Diamond, Sarah E.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"For many species, the timing of life cycle events is advancing under contemporary global climate change. However, much less is known regarding phenological shifts as a result of other sources of anthropogenic change, such as urban warming. In both cases, progress has been hampered by a focus on phenological traits such as the timing of emergence, rather than the phenology of more directly related fitness traits such as the timing of reproduction. Here we explore how urban heat island effects shape the timing of reproduction in an acorn-dwelling ant. We used a common garden experiment with acorn ants collected from three cities in the eastern United States along a latitudinal gradient and reared long-term in the laboratory under five temperature treatments. This allowed us to quantify the effects of temperature on reproductive phenology across three scales-a biogeographic temperature dine, three urban vs. rural temperature comparisons, and five laboratory rearing temperatures. At our northernmost and southernmost cities (spanning 6 degrees of latitude), we found both urbanization and wanner laboratory rearing temperature significantly advanced reproductive phenology; ants from the lowest latitude city also had earlier reproductive phenology compared with the higher latitude cities. In the field, the differences in urban versus rural acorn ant reproductive phenology translate to approximately one month earlier reproduction in the urban populations. For insects with synchronous mating events, such as ants, shifts in the already short window of time to reproduce could limit mating across environments, potentially leading to reproductive isolation between urban and rural populations.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.01.004,80,NA,119-125,NA,Alates; Ants; Gradients; Latitude; Phenology; Temperature
article,Chronic heat stress increases insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1) but does not affect IGF-binding proteins in growing pigs,"Xin, Hairui and Zhang, Xiaojun and Sun, Dengsheng and Zhang, Chuang and Hao, Yue and Gu, Xianhong",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The insulin-like activity of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is heavily blunted by IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs, including IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-3). The effects of heat stress (HS) on the IGF-1 and IGFBPs in growing pigs are still not clear. This study aimed to investigate the alterations of IGF-1 and IGFBPs under chronic HS in growing pigs. Twenty-seven growing large white barrows with similar body weight were collected from nine litters and were assigned into three treatments. The litter effect is balanced in all treatments. Treatments were: 1) thermal-neutral (TN) group (23 degrees C), 2) chronic HS group (33 degrees C), and 3) pair-fed in TN condition (PFTN). The experiment lasted for 21 days. Compared with TN controls, decreased FI, lower average body weight gain, higher rectal temperature and increased respiration rates were observed in HS pigs. On D7, increased plasma insulin concentration and insulin:glucose ratio were observed in HS pigs compared to TN controls. A overall elevation of plasma IGF-1:IGFBP-3 ratio was detected in HS pigs compared with PFTN and TN counterparts. Besides, hepatic IGF-1 gene expression of HS pigs was 50\% higher than TN counterparts. PFTN pigs, however, had no differences in plasma IGF-1:IGFBP-3 ratio and hepatic IGF-1 gene expression, compared with TN pigs. PFTN pigs increased plasma IGFBPs concentration and hepatic IGFBPs gene expression, compared with TN controls. However, no differences in plasma IGFBPs concentration and hepatic IGFBPs gene expression were observed between TN and HS group. Liver IRS-1 gene and protein expressions of HS pigs tended to be increased compared with TN controls, while PFTN pigs still kept liver IRS-1 gene and protein expressions in normal level. High temperature (33 degrees C), independent of feed intake reduction, increased IGF-1 but did not affect IGFBPs levels in growing pigs.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.08.008,77,NA,122-130,NA,Chronic heat stress; IGF-1; IGFBPs; Growing pigs
article,Extended winters entail long-term costs for insect offspring reared in an overwinter burrow,"Koerner, Maximilian and Foitzik, Susanne and Meunier, Joel",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Winter imposes an ecological challenge to animals living in colder climates, especially if these adverse conditions coincide with reproduction and offspring rearing. To overcome this challenge, some insects burrow in the soil to protect adults, larvae, or eggs from negative effects of winter. However, whether this protection is effective against any long-term consequences of changes in winter duration is unclear. Here, we investigated the long-term effects of winter length variation on eggs of the European earwig Forficula auricularia. In this insect, females construct and maintain a burrow between late autumn and spring, in which they provide extensive forms of care to their eggs and then juveniles. We experimentally maintained earwig females under two winter durations of either four or six weeks and examined the resulting effects in terms of 1) hatching date, 2) developmental time of juveniles until adulthood, 3) adult mass at emergence, and 4) investment of adult offspring females in three key immune parameters: hemocyte concentration, phenoloxidase, and prophenoloxidase activities. Because earwigs' resistance against pathogens relies on their social environment, effects of winter length on immunity were tested on females exposed to different social environments: with familiar conspecifics, unfamiliar conspecifics, or in isolation. Our results reveal that after the winter treatments, eggs reared in short winters hatched earlier and the emerging juveniles reached adulthood faster than juveniles from eggs exposed to long winters. We also showed that prophenoloxidase was 30\% higher in females from the long compared to short winter treatment, regardless of social environment. Finally, we found that hemocyte counts where twice as high in short compared to long winter females, but only with unfamiliar conspecifics. Overall, our study reveals that maintaining and caring for eggs in a burrow does not prevent the costs associated with increased winter duration.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.03.021,74,NA,116-122,NA,Diapause; Egg gestation; Winter; Insects; Immunity; Sub-social

Herein, adult southern grass lizards, Takydromus sexlineatus, were maintained under two thermal regimes simulating current thermal environment and a 4 degrees C warming scenario to determine the effects of experimental warming on female reproduction and offspring phenotypes. Experimental warming caused females to oviposit earlier and more frequently; however, it did not affect other reproductive traits, including clutch size, egg mass and clutch mass. Accelerated embryonic development and energy accumulation rate might have occurred in warmed females. Maternal warming appeared to increase early embryonic mortality, but did not shift hatchling size and locomotor performance. Embryos of oviparous lizards might be more vulnerable to climate change at early stages than at later stages. The impacts of climate change in oviparous lizards might be adverse in the longer term because of the shift in pre-ovipositional embryo viability, which possibly led to a decreased number of hatchlings.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.04.017,74,NA,303-310,NA,Takydromus sexlineatus; Maternal warming; Reproductive frequency; Embryonic mortality; Hatchling phenotype

Recent studies have reported that environmental temperature modulates organisms' thermoregulatory capacity and immune response, suggesting that trade-offs must be made between thermoregulation and immune function. Despite this, studies that evaluate this trade-off in developing endotherms are scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of environmental temperature experienced during development on the response to an antigen and its energetic costs in the precocial rodent Octodon degus. To accomplish this, we acclimated pups from birth to weaning at temperatures of 15 degrees C and 30 degrees C. At weaning, animals were inoculated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cytokine interleukin-1 beta levels, sickness behavior, changes in body temperature and basal metabolic rate, and body mass were measured. Our results showed that environmental temperature influences cytokine levels, body temperature, and some aspects of sickness behavior. Specifically, acclimatization at 30 degrees C has a suppressive effect on the response to LPS, possibly due to a control to avoid overproduction of interleukin-1 beta. Body mass and basal metabolic rate were not affected by environmental temperature experienced during development, but inoculation with LPS affected both variables. Our results suggest that ambient temperature may be a key factor that affects the response to an antigen in pups of O. degus; however, no evidence of a trade-off between thermoregulation and immune function was found here.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.10.005,71,NA,17-23,NA,Ecoimmunology; Lipopolysaccharide; Precocial; Thermoregulation; Energy expenditure
article,A method to transform a variable thermal regime to a physiologically equivalent effective temperature,"Mitz, Charles and Thome, Christopher and Thompson, Jeroen and Manzon, Richard G. and Wilson, Joanna Y. and Boreham, Douglas R.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"We present a method to characterize variable thermal regimes in terms of an equivalent or effective temperature. Our method is based on a first order exponential transformation of a time series of temperatures to yield an exponentially-weighted mean temperature characteristic of the regime and independent of any particular species or end point. The resulting effective temperature or exponential mean, 7, offers an improved method for summarizing mean temperature where biological response scales exponentially to temperature. The exponential mean allows growth under varying thermal regimes to be predicted using constant temperature models and offers a compact descriptor communicating the growth capacity of variable thermal regimes. The method combines mathematical simplicity with translatability to different Q10 values without recourse to the underlining time series data. It also provides a quantitative baseline that improves on mean temperature by incorporating the effect of Jensen's inequality and it remains applicable at near zero temperatures where thermal sums lack accuracy.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.12.011,65,NA,21-25,NA,Variable thermal regime; Jensen's inequality; Effective temperature; Thermal sums
article,Ecological differences influence the thermal sensitivity of swimming performance in two co-occurring mysid shrimp species with climate change implications,"Ober, Gordon T. and Thornber, Carol and Grear, Jason and Kolbe, Jason J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature strongly affects performance in ectotherms. As ocean warming continues, performance of marine species will be impacted. Many studies have focused on how warming will impact physiology, life history, and behavior, but few studies have investigated how ecological and behavioral traits of organisms will affect their response to changing thermal environments. Here, we assessed the thermal tolerances and thermal sensitivity of swimming performance of two sympatric mysid shrimp species of the Northwest Atlantic. Neomysis americana and Heteromysis formosa overlap in habitat and many aspects of their ecological niche, but only N. americana exhibits vertical migration. In temperate coastal ecosystems, temperature stratification of the water column exposes vertical migrators to a wider range of temperatures on a daily basis. We found that N. americana had a significantly lower critical thermal minimum (CTmin) and critical thermal maximum (CTmax). However, both mysid species had a buffer of at least 4 degrees C between their CTmax and the 100-year projection for mean summer water temperatures of 28 degrees C. Swimming performance of the vertically migrating species was more sensitive to temperature variation, and this species exhibited faster burst swimming speeds. The generalist performance curve of H. formosa and specialist curve of N. americana are consistent with predictions based on the exposure of each species to temperature variation such that higher within-generation variability promotes specialization. However, these species violate the assumption of the specialist-generalist tradeoff in that the area under their performance curves is not constant. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating species specific responses to temperature based on the ecology and behavior of organisms into climate change prediction models.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.11.012,64,NA,26-34,NA,Thermal tolerance; Thermal sensitivity of performance; Climate change; Thermal variation; Ocean warming
article,Temperature preferences of African mole-rats (family Bathyergidae),"Begall, Sabine and Berendes, Meike and Schielke, Charlotte K. M. and Henning, Yoshiyuki and Laghanke, Marzena and Scharff, Andreas and van Daele, Paul and Burda, Hynek",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Many animals are able to detect small temperature differences and show strong temperature preferences during periods of rest and activity. Mammals inhabiting the subterranean ecotope can adapt their digging and foraging activity in shallow tunnels temporarily to periods with favourable ambient air and soil temperatures. Moreover, subterranean mammals have the unique opportunity to select for their nests in soil depths with certain, daily and seasonally constant temperatures. Our knowledge on nest temperatures in several species of subterranean mammals is based on measurements of temperatures in empty nests. We can expect, however, that the temperature in an occupied nest is higher (due to the ``igloo effect{''}). We performed two experiments regarding the temperature preference in five species of African mole-rats (Bathyergidae, Rodentia: Fukomys anselli, E mechowii, E micklemi, Heliophobius argenteocinereus, and Heterocephalus glaber). In a first experiment, the animals were tested pairwise (except for the solitary silvery mole-rats, H. argenteocinereus, that were tested singly) in an apparatus consisting of seven chambers with a temperature gradient ranging between 16 and 37 degrees C (air temperature). While the smaller species ( < 110 g; E anselli, E micklemi, H. glaber) chose chambers with average air temperatures around 29 degrees C, the larger mole-rats rested preferably at lower temperatures of approximately 25.6 degrees C (F. mechowii) and 27.7 degrees C (H. argenteocinereus). A strong negative correlation between body mass and preferred air temperature was detected across species. Thus, the results comply with the surface-volume-rule. Contrary to expectations, temperature preference of naked mole-rats (H. glaber) did not deviate from those of furred small mole-rats, but followed the general trend with smaller species preferring higher temperatures. In a second experiment, Ansell's mole-rats (E anselli) were tested in groups of four, six and nine animals and the preferred temperatures were compared to the values obtained for pairs. The preferred mean air temperatures did not differ among the groups of different sizes. We discuss our finding's in the light of ecophysiological adaptations to cope with the ambient conditions proposed by the ``thermal stress hypothesis{''}. Furthermore, we suggest that while soil temperature is decisive during digging as the mole-rats warm up or cool due to tight contact between body and soil (conduction), resting animals prevent heat loss through conduction by building a nest.

Zachary and Nicholson, Haley S. and Munguia, Pablo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature is one of the primary environmental variables limiting organismal performance, fitness, and species distributions. Yet, understanding temperature effects requires thorough exploration of thermal constraints and organismal responses that can translate to fitness and non-lethal long-term consequences under both constant and changing thermal regimes. We examined the thermal ecology of the fiddler crab Uca panacea, including critical thermal limits, thermal sensitivity of locomotion, operative environmental temperatures, preferred body temperatures, and acclimation ability. Operative environmental temperatures frequently reached the critical thermal maximum (41.8 +/- 0.8 degrees C, mean +/- s.e.m.), especially in unvegetated microhabitats, indicating the need for behavioral thermoregulation to maintain diurnal activity patterns. Preferred body temperatures (21.1-28.6 degrees C) were substantially below the thermal optimum (30-40 degrees C), although further research is needed to determine the driver of this mismatch. Critical thermal limits shifted 2-4 degrees C in response to exposure to low (20 degrees C) or high (35 degrees C) temperatures, with full acclimation occurring in approximately 9 d. This capacity for rapid acclimation, combined with the capacity for behavioral thermoregulation, is a strong candidate mechanism that explains the broad habitat use and could help explain the successful pantropical distribution of fiddler crabs.

Histopathological techniques, PAS-Alcian blue staining, immunohistochemistry method, biochemical quantification method, ELISA, and micro method were used to study the changes in the intestinal mucosal morphology, the number of goblet cells, the expression of tight junction proteins, the peroxide product contents and antioxidant enzyme activities, the intestinal mucosal damage, the content of immunoglobulins and HSP70, the activity of Na+/K+-ATPase. The results showed that methionine can improve intestinal mucosal morphology (increase the villi height, V/C value, and muscle layer thickness, decrease crypt depth), increase the expression of tight junction proteins (Claudin-1, Occludin, ZO-1) and the content of DAO, decrease the content of intestinal mucosa damage markers (ET, FABP2) and peroxidation products (MDA), increase the activity of antioxidant enzymes (GR, GSH-Px, SOD), the number of goblet cells, the contents of immunoglobulins (sIgA, IgA, IgG, IgM) and stress protein (HSP70), and the activity of Na+/K+-ATPase.

article,Warm and thermally variable incubation conditions reduce embryonic performance and carry over to influence hatchling tradeoffs,"Stahlschmidt, Z. R.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Animals' thermal sensitivities have long been characterized by thermal performance curves (TPCs) or reaction norms, and TPCs may predict animals' responses to climate change. Typically, TPCs are parameterized by measuring performance at a range of constant temperatures. Yet, animals encounter a range of thermal environments, and temperature variability is an aspect of climate change that may affect animals more than gradual warming. Daily temperature variability is particularly important for eggs in most taxa because they are highly sensitive to temperature and cannot behaviorally avoid stressful temperatures. Thus, the legacy of thermal conditions experienced during incubation may carryover to subsequent life stages. Here, I factorially manipulated mean temperature (20, 25, or 30 degrees C) and daily temperature range (DTR; +/- 0, 5, or 10 degrees C) during incubation for eggs of the variable field cricket (Gryllus lineaticeps) to integrate the role of DTR into the established paradigm of TPCs. Low DTR (+/- 5 degrees C) was not generally costly, and it even improved hatchling starvation resistance (sensu hormesis). However, high DTR (+/- 10 degrees C) reduced and delayed hatching at a warm mean temperature (30 degrees C). The effects of high DTR carried over to accelerate hatchling development at an expense to hatchling starvation resistance-therefore, thermal conditions during incubation can shape tradeoffs among important traits related to life history and stress tolerance later in life. In sum, animals may exhibit complex responses to their increasingly warmer, more thermally variable environments.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103946,124,NA,NA,103946,Cricket; Global climate change; Hormesis; Temperature fluctuation; Thermal performance curve
article,Invading new climates at what cost? Ontogenetic differences in the thermal dependence of metabolic rate in an invasive amphibian,"Padilla, Pablo and Herrel, Anthony and Denoel, Mathieu",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Global warming can either promote or constrain the invasive potential of alien species. In ectotherm invaders that exhibit a complex life cycle, success is inherently dependent on the capacity of each developmental stage to cope with environmental change. This is particularly relevant for invasive anurans, which disperse on land while requiring water for reproduction. However, it remains unknown how the different life stages respond in terms of energy expenditure under different climate change scenarios. We here quantified the oxygen uptake of frogs at rest (a proxy of the standard metabolic rate) in the aquatic phase (at the tadpole and climax, i.e. during metamorphosis, stages) and in the terrestrial phase (metamorphosed stage) at three environmental temperatures. To do so, we used marsh frogs ( Pelophylax ridibundus ), an amphibian with the largest invasive range within the palearctic realm and for which their adaptation to global warming might be key to their invasion success. Beyond an increase of metabolic rate with temperature, our data show variation in thermal adaptation across life stages and a higher metabolic cost during metamorphosis. These results suggest that the cost to shift habitat and face changes in temperature may be a constraint on the invasive potential of species with a complex life cycle which may be particularly vulnerable during metamorphosis.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103836,121,NA,NA,103836,Amphibians; Metamorphosis; Invasive alien species; Tadpoles; Temperature; Metabolic rate
article,Bumblebee thermoregulation at increasing temperatures is affected by behavioral state,"Sepulveda-Rodriguez, Guadalupe and Roberts, Kevin T. and Araujo, Priscila and Lehmann, Philipp and Baird, Emily",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Over the past decades, increasing environmental temperatures have been identified as one of the causes of major insect population declines and biodiversity loss. However, it is unclear how these rising temperatures affect endoheterothermic insects, like bumblebees, that have evolved thermoregulatory capacities to exploit cold and temperate habitats. To investigate this, we measured head, thoracic, and abdominal temperature of bumblebee ( Bombus terrestris ) workers across a range of temperatures (24 degrees C -32 degrees C) during three distinct behaviors. In resting bumblebees, the head, abdomen, and thorax conformed to the environmental temperature. In pre-flight bumblebees, the head and abdominal temperatures were elevated with respect to the environmental temperature, while the thoracic temperature was maintained, indicating a pre-flight muscle warming stage. In post -flight bumblebees, abdominal temperature increased at the same rate as environmental temperature, but the head and the thoracic temperature did not. By calculating the excess temperature ratio, we show that thermoregulation in bumblebees during flight is partially achieved by the active transfer of heat produced in the thorax to the abdomen, where it can more easily be dissipated. These results provide the first indication that the thermoregulatory abilities of bumblebees are plastic and behavior dependent. We also show that the flight speed and number of workers foraging increase with increasing temperature, suggesting that bees do not avoid flying at these temperatures despite its impact on behavioral performance.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103830,121,NA,NA,103830,Thermoregulation; Climate warming; Behavior; Flight speed

We determined whether ad libitum ice slurry ingestion influences physiological and perceptual variables and half -marathon performance while comparing the effects of the amount and moment of ingestion between ice slurry and water at 37 C-degrees. Ten trained participants (28 +/- 2 years; mean and SD) were required to run two half marathons while consuming either ice slurry (-1 C-degrees; Ad -1) or water (37 C-degrees; 37 CE) ad libitum. They then performed two other half marathons where, during one, they were required to ingest an amount of water equivalent to the amount consumed during the Ad -1 trial (Pro37), and in the other, to ingest ice slurry in the amount consumed during the 37 CE trial (Pro -1). During the half marathons, dry-bulb temperature and relative humidity were controlled at 33.1 +/- 0.3 C-degrees and 60 +/- 3\%, respectively. Ad -1 ingestion (349.6 +/- 58.5 g) was 45\% less than 37 CE ingestion (635.5 +/- 135.8 g). Physical performance, heart rate, perceived exertion, body temperatures, and thermal perception were not influenced by the temperature or amount of beverage ingestion. However, a secondary analysis suggested that lower beverage ingestion was associated with improved performance (Ad -1 + Pro37 vs. 37 CE + Pro -1: -4.0 min, Cohen's d = 0.39), with a significant relationship between lower beverage ingestion and faster running time (b = 0.02, t = 4.01, p < 0.001).

Elevations in average sea surface temperatures are occurring and increasing frequency of marine heatwaves resulting in mortalities of organisms are being reported. In recent years, marine farmers have reported summer mass mortality events of the New Zealand Greenshell mussel, Perna canaliculus, during the summer months; however, the etiological agents have yet to be determined. To elucidate the role of thermal stress, adult P. canaliculus were exposed to three chronic temperature treatments: a benign control of 17 degrees C and stressful elevations of 21 degrees C and 24 degrees C. Eight mussels per treatment were collected each month throughout a 14-month challenge period to identify and investigate histopathological differences among P. canaliculus populations exposed to the three temperatures. Histopathology revealed several significant deleterious alterations to tissues associated with temperature and exposure time. Increasing temperature and progression of time resulted in 1) an increase in the number of focal lipofuscin-ceroid aggregations, 2) an increase in focal hemocytosis, 3) an increase in the thickness of the sub-epithelial layer of the intestinal tract and 4) a decreased energy reserve cell (glycogen) coverage in the mantle. Prolonged exposure, irrespective of temperature, impacted gametogenesis, which was effectively arrested. Furthermore, increased levels of the heat shock protein 70 kDa (HSP 70) were seen in gill and gonad from thermally challenged mussels. The occurrence of the parasite Perkinsus olseni at month 5 in the 24 degrees C treatment, and month 7 at 21 degrees C was unexpected and may have exacerbated the fore-mentioned tissue conditions. Prolonged exposure to stable thermal conditions therefore appears to impact P. canaliculus, tissues with implications for broodstock captivity.

Climate change is expected to exacerbate this situation by increasing the frequency of droughts along with human impacts on groundwater ecosystems. Despite prior research on the quantitative effects of climate change on groundwater, the direct impacts on groundwater biodiversity, especially obligate groundwater species, remain largely unexplored. Therefore, investigating the potential impacts of climate change, including groundwater temperature changes, is crucial for the survival of obligate groundwater species. This study aimed to determine the thermal niche breadth of the crustacean amphipod species Niphargus longicaudatus by using the chronic method. We found that N. longicaudatus has a wide thermal niche with a natural performance range of 7-9 degrees C, which corresponds to the thermal regime this species experiences within its distribution range in Italy. The observed range of preferred temperature (PT) was different from the mean annual temperature of the sites from which the species has been collected, challenging the idea that groundwater species are only adapted to narrow temperature ranges. Considering the significant threats of climate change to groundwater ecosystems, these findings provide crucial information for the conservation of obligate groundwater species, suggesting that some of them may be more resilient to temperature changes than previously thought.

Critical thermal maximum tests (CTmax) are often conducted to provide insight into the impacts of changing temperatures; however, little is known about how the rate of temperature increase in these assays affects thermal tolerance. To assess the effect of heating rate (0.3 \& DEG;C/min, 0.03 \& DEG;C/min, 0.003 \& DEG;C/min) we measured thermal tolerance, somatic indices, and gill Hsp mRNA expression. Contrary to what has been observed in most other fish species, white sturgeon thermal tolerance was highest at the slowest heating rate of 0.003 \& DEG;C/min (34.2 \& DEG;C, and CTmax of 31.3 and 29.2 \& DEG;C, for rates 0.03 and 0.3 \& DEG;C/min, respectively) suggesting an ability to rapidly acclimate to slowly increasing temperatures. Hepatosomatic index decreased in all heating rates relative to control fish, indicative of the metabolic costs of thermal stress. At the transcriptional level, slower heating rates resulted in higher gill mRNA expression of Hsp90a, Hsp90b, and Hsp70. Hsp70 mRNA expression was increased in all heating rates relative to controls, whereas expression of Hsp90a and Hsp90b mRNA only increased in the two slower trials. Together these data indicate that white sturgeon have a very plastic thermal response, which is likely energetically costly to induce.

The temperature and pressure of sacral skin, as well as the incidence of pressure injury (PI) were detected and compared. In animal studies, TPC significantly reduced both the size and incidence of PI in rats on the second, third and fourth days post treatment. In addition, the expression levels of both mRNA and protein of HSP27 were increased in the TPC group, compared with the control group. Immunohistochemical staining showed that HSP27 was distributed in various types of dermal cells and increased in basal cells. In human studies, a significant reduction (75\%) of IAPIs was observed among the patients in the TPC group. TPC can reduce the incidence of PI in rats and humans, and the upregulation of HSP27 may play an important role in this biological progress. Further studies are warranted to explore the molecular mechanism of the preventive effect in PI mediated by HSP27.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103617,115,NA,NA,103617,Pressure injury; Thermal preconditioning; Heat shock protein; Elective surgery; Intraoperatively acquired pressure injuries

For this study, animals were discriminated between BLV (+) and BLV (-), and those belonging to the first group, were classified based on their proviral load. The expression of the inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha and its receptors, which play an important role in disease progression, were quantified by qPCR in two different seasons. During the summer, average temperature was 19.8 degrees C, maximums higher than 30 degrees C were frequent. Instead, during the autumn, the average temperature was 12.63 degrees C, and temperatures never exceeded 27 degrees C. During this season, almost no periods of temperatures exceeded the comfort limit. Our results revealed that the expression levels of TNF-alpha and its receptors were downregulated in animals with high proviral load. This fact could affect their antiviral response and predispose to viral dissemination; over time, animals with a poorer immune system are prone to acquiring opportunistic diseases. Conversely, animals with LPL maintained their expression profile, with behavior comparable to noninfected animals. These findings should be considered by producers and researchers, given the problems that global warming is causing lately to the planet.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103568,114,NA,NA,103568,Heat stress; Immune system; TNF-Alpha; TNF-Alpha receptors; BLV
article,Enzymatic responses reveal different physiological strategies employed by eurytolerant fish during extreme hot and cold cycling acclimation temperatures,"Jimenez, Ana Gabriela and Nash-Braun, Evan",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Heat waves and cold snaps are projected to rise in magnitude, duration, interval, and harshness in the coming years. The current literature examining thermal impacts on the physiology of organisms rarely uses chronic, variable thermal acclimations despite the fact that climate change predictions project a more variable environment. If we are to determine species' susceptibility to climate change, chronic and variable lab acclimations should be prioritized. Here, we acclimated the eurytolerant sheepshead minnow (Cyprinodon variegatus) to two extreme cycling thermal regimes: one warm {[}resting 27 degrees C with a spike to 33 degrees C for 8 h daily], one cold {[}resting 6.5 degrees C with a spike to 12 degrees C for 8 h daily], and three chronically stable conditions (10, 22, and 30 degrees C) for comparison. We measured enzymatic an-tioxidants (catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)), total antioxidant capacity, lipid peroxidation (LPO) damage, and citrate synthase (CS) activity in white epaxial muscle. Of particular note, we found significant increases in log CAT activity and SOD concentration in the warm cycling temperatures, and significant increases in GPx activity in the cold cycling temperatures. We found no significant accumulation of LPO damage in any of our thermal acclimation treatments. Thus, sheepshead minnows demonstrate two particularly different mechanisms towards dealing with thermal variation in low and high temperatures. The enzymatic differences between low and high cycling temperatures may define pathways of eurytolerant organisms and how they may survive predicted variability in thermal regimes.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103578,114,NA,NA,103578,NA
article,Inflammatory responses of bovine endometrial epithelial cells are increased under in vitro heat stress conditions,"Molinari, Paula C. C. and Bromfield, John J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Cattle exposed to heat stress have reduced fertility, reduced milk production and increased incidence of post-partum uterine infection. Heat stress is suggested to alter immune function of cattle; however, the mechanisms underlying heat stress mediated uterine infection are unknown. We hypothesized that exposure of endometrial cells to heat stress would further increase expression of inflammatory mediators in response to bacterial com-ponents due to altered heat-shock protein expression. Bovine endometrial epithelial cells (BEND) were exposed to Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or a synthetic triacylated lipopeptide (Pam3CSK4) under heat stress (41.0 degrees C) or thermoneutral (38.5 degrees C) conditions for 24 h. Exposure of BEND cells to LPS or Pam3CSK4 increased the expression of the proinflammatory mediators IL1B, IL6, and CXCL8 compared to control medium. However, exposure of BEND cells to heat stress increased LPS and Pam3CSK4 induced expression of IL1B compared to cells exposed to thermoneutral conditions, and expression of LPS induced IL6 was also increased when BEND cells were exposed to heat stress. To determine if heat shock proteins increased BEND cell expression of inflammatory mediators, HSP1A1 and HSF1 were targeted by siRNA knock down. Expression of HSP1A1 and HSF1 were reduced following siRNA knockdown; however, knockdown of HSP1A1 or HSF1 further increased heat stress mediated increased expression of inflammatory mediators. These data suggest that heat stress increased BEND cell inflammatory responses to bacterial components, while heat shock proteins HSP1A1 and HSF1 help to restrain inflammatory responses. These mechanisms may contribute to the increased incidence of uterine infection observed in cows under heat stress conditions.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103564,114,NA,NA,103564,Heat stress; Immune modulation

It is therefore crucial to study the physiological mechanisms that species use to maintain their homeothermy in order to address biodiversity conservation challenges, such as the success of invasions of introduced species. The common waxbill Estrilda astrild, the orange-cheeked waxbill E. melpoda, and the black-rumped waxbill E. troglodytes are small Afrotropical passerines that have established invasive populations in regions where the climate is colder than in their native ranges. As a result, they are highly suitable species for studying potential mechanisms for coping with a colder and more variable climate. Here, we investigated the magnitude and direction of seasonal variation in their thermoregulatory traits, such as basal (BMR), summit (Msum) metabolic rates and thermal conductance. We found that, from summer to autumn, their ability to resist colder temperatures increased. This was not related to larger body masses or higher BMR and Msum, but instead, species downregulated BMR and Msum toward the colder season, suggesting energy conservation mechanisms to increase winter survival. BMR and Msum were most strongly correlated with temperature variation in the week preceding the measurements. Common waxbill and black-rumped waxbill, whose native ranges encompass the highest degree of seasonality, showed the most flexibility in metabolic rates (i.e., stronger downregulation to-ward colder seasons). This ability to adjust thermoregulatory traits, combined with increased cold tolerance, may facilitate their establishment in areas characterized by colder winters and less predictable climates.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103534,113,NA,NA,103534,Invasive species; Waxbills; Climate variability hypothesis; Basal metabolic rate; Summit metabolic rate; Thermal conductance

K. and Looi, Leonard Jun Cong",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are serious and difficult to detect conditions that can be deadly if they rupture. Infrared thermography (IRT) is a promising imaging technique that can detect abdominal aortic aneurysms more quickly and less costly than other imaging techniques. A clinical biomarker of circular thermal elevation on the midriff skin surface of AAA patient at various scenarios was expected during diagnosis using IRT scanner. However, it is important to note that thermography is not a perfect technology, and it does have some limitations, such as lack of clinical trials. There is still work to be done to improve this imaging technique and make it a more viable and accurate method in detecting abdominal aortic aneurysms. Nevertheless, thermography is currently one of the most convenient technologies in imaging, and it has the potential to detect abdominal aortic aneurysms earlier than other techniques. Cardiac thermal pulse (CTP), on the other hand, was used to examine the thermal physics of AAA. AAA had a CTP that only responded to systolic phase at regular body temperature. Whereas the AAA wall would establish thermal homeostasis with blood temperature following a quasi-linear relationship as the body experienced fever or stage-2 hypothermia. In contrast, a healthy abdominal aorta displayed a CTP that responded to the full cardiac cycle, including diastolic phase at all simulated scenarios.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103481,113,NA,NA,103481,Unsteady blood flow; Transient bioheat transfer; Cardiac thermal pulse; Abdominal aortic aneurysm; Abdominal aorta wall; Midriff skin surface; Isotherms

The images were obtained for baseline, positive, and negative valence according to the protocol of the Geneva Affective Picture Database. Absolute and per-centage differences of average values of the data between the valences and the baseline were calculated for different regions of interest (forehead, periorbital eyes, cheeks, nose and upper lips). For negative valence, a decrease in temperature and blood perfusion was observed in the regions of interest, and the effect was greater on the left side than on the right side. In positive valence, the temperature and blood perfusion increased in some cases, showing a complex pattern. The temperature and perfusion of the nose was reduced for both valences, which is indicative of the arousal dimension. The blood perfusion images were found to be greater contrast; the percentage differences in the blood perfusion images are greater than those obtained in thermographic images.

article,Thermography as a tool to assess training effects in military working dogs,"Pichova, Katarina and Pavlin, Sara and Kostal, Lubor and Pintaric, Stefan and Semrov, Manja Zupan",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Military working dogs are exposed to high levels of physical load during their work, although this is not always evident from their behaviour. This workload causes various physiological changes, including variation in the temperature of the affected body parts. In this preliminary study, we investigated whether thermal changes following the daily work routine of military dogs are detectable by infrared thermography (IRT). The experiment was carried out on eight male German and Belgian shepherd patrol guard dogs performing two training activities, obedience and defence. The surface temperature (Ts) of 12 selected body parts on both body sides was measured with the IRT camera 5 min before, 5 min after and 30 min after training. As predicted, there was a greater in-crease in Ts (mean of all measured body parts) after defence than after obedience, 5 min (by 1.24 vs. 0.60 degrees C, P < 0.001) and 30 min after activity (by 0.90vs. 0.57 degrees C, P < 0.01) compared to pre-activity levels. These findings indicate that defence is more physically demanding than obedience activity. Considering the activities sepa-rately, obedience increased Ts 5 min after the activity only in the trunk (P < 0.001) but not in the limbs, whereas defence increased it in all measured body parts (P < 0.001). Ts 30 min after obedience decreased to the pre-activity level in parts at trunk, while in distal parts of the limbs Ts remained elevated. The prolonged eleva-tion in Ts of the limbs after both activities indicates heat flow from the core to the periphery as a thermoreg-ulatory mechanism. The current study suggests that IRT may be a useful tool for assessing physical workload in different body parts of dogs.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103441,112,NA,NA,103441,Infrared thermography; Military working dogs; Physical activity; Obedience; Defence; Training

In recent years, researchers have focused on heat stress and its effect on the exacerbation of some diseases. The main objective of this study is to identify the bioclimatic conditions and its relationship with the admission rate of cardiovascular patients in of Tabriz city. In addition to meteorological variables, daily cardiovascular patient admission rates were obtained from Shahid Madani Heart Hospital in Tabriz during the statistical period of March 27th, 2007 to February 17th, 2017. To do so, the bioclimatic conditions of Tabriz were identified on a daily scale based on bioclimatic indices including Perceived Temperature (PT), Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) and Predicted Mean Vote (PMV). Then, the relationship between each bioclimatic condition and the number of cardiovascular patients' referrals in Tabriz was investigated using Kruskal-Wallis test. Findings illustrated that the impact of cold stress in the rate of cardiovascular patients was more than that of the warm stress, which was obtained for all study indicators in a similar way. On the other hand, the results showed that based on PET and PMV indices, there is a significant difference between various bioclimatic classes in the rate of cardiovascular patients' admission. The results of Kruskal-Wallis test include Sig = 0.040 and Sig = 0.049 for PET and PMV, respectively. However, Sig values for and PT indice showed no significant difference between bioclimatic classes in the rate of admission of cardio-vascular patients.

article,Acute thermal stress and endotoxin exposure modulate metabolism and immunity in marine mussels (<i>Perna canaliculus</i>),"Muznebin, Farhana and Alfaro, Andrea C. and Venter, Leonie and Young, Tim",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Mass mortalities of New Zealand Green-lipped mussels (Perna canaliculus) are thought to be associated with increased water temperatures and immune challenges from opportunistic pathogens. However, the combined effects of acute thermal stress and immune stimulation on mussels are poorly understood. To investigate these responses, adult mussels were exposed to different temperatures (26 C {[}thermal stress] vs 15 C [}ambient]) and a bacterial-derived endotoxin injection (with vs without) to mimic a pathogen infection. Various immunological and metabolic parameters were measured over two days via enzyme staining reactions, flow cytometry, and metabolomic profiling. None of the treatments impacted total and differential haemocyte counts, haemocyte viability or production of reactive oxygen species. Acid phosphatase and phenoloxidase activities were detected only within granulocytes (not in hyalinocytes), although their relative expressions also were not affected. Conversely, metabolite profiling exposed impacts of thermal stress and endotoxin exposure at a metabolic level, indicative of physiological changes in energy expenditure and partitioning. At the higher water temperature, free fatty acid and amino acid constituents increased and decreased, respectively, which supports an elevated energy demand and higher metabolic rate due to thermal stress. Ultimately, energy production is being sustained via multiple routes including the glycolysis pathway, TCA cycle, and beta-oxidation. Additionally, branched-chain amino acids, the urea cycle and the glutathione pathway were affected by the higher temperature. The metabolic response of mussels exposed to endotoxin exposure resulted in increased metabolite response largely linked to protein and lipid degradation. After 5 days of exposure, survival data confirmed a severe physiological impact of the higher temperature through incidences of mortality. However, the thermal challenge in combination with the specific endotoxin treatment applied did not lead to a synergistic effect on mortality. These findings provide new insights into the relationship between thermal stress and immunity to better understand the immune defence system in mussels.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103327,110,NA,NA,103327,Green -lipped mussel; Granulocytes; Hyalinocytes; Lipopolysaccharide; Metabolomics; Summer mortality

Up to three-fourths of the gestation period in moose (Alces alces) overlaps with the food-scarce period in winter. During this period, moose deal with the limited forage resources available through hypometabolism with decreased heart rate and body temperature (Tb). Body temperature is also an indicator of oestrus, pregnancy and parturition, which is well documented in several domestic species. In this study, we sought to determine if moose displayed a similar Tb pattern during pregnancy and parturition to domesticated ruminants, and if we could detect parturition by combining Tb and activity data. We studied the Tb pattern of 30 free-ranging adult female moose (>= 1.5 years old), equipped with ruminal temperature loggers and GPS collars. We documented a 0.13-0.19 degrees C higher Tb in pregnant compared to non-pregnant moose, depending on the study area with the Tb difference increasing along a south-north gradient, and a drop in Tb and in activity when parturition was imminent. Detection of parturition was highly successful when combining Tb and activity data with an accuracy of 91.5\%.

R.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Recently, it has been demonstrated that heat-induced male sterility is likely to shape population persistence as climate change progresses. However, an under-explored possibility is that females may be able to successfully store and preserve sperm at temperatures that sterilise males, which could ameliorate the impact of male infertility on populations. Here, we test whether females from two fruit fly species can protect stored sperm from a high temperature stress. We find that sperm carried by female Drosophila virilis are almost completely sterilised by high temperatures, whereas sperm carried by female Zaprionus indianus show only slightly reduced fertility. Heat-shocked D. virilis females can recover fertility when allowed to remate, suggesting that the delivered heat shock is damaging stored sperm and not directly damaging females in this species. The temperatures required to reduce fertility of mated females are substantially lower than the temperatures required to damage mature sperm in males, suggesting that females are worse than males at protecting mature sperm. This suggests that female sperm storage is unlikely to ameliorate the impacts of high temperature fertility losses in males, and instead exacerbates fertility costs of high temperatures, representing an important determinant of population persistence during climate change.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103209,105,NA,NA,103209,Fertility; Female sperm storage; Heat stress; Climate change

Heat shock response (HSR) indicators (Hsp70 and Hsp90), activation of MAPK family members, uniquitination, antioxidant enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR), and apoptotic indicators such as caspases levels and the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 were determined in liver and muscle samples that were collected on days 0, 14, 41 and 60. Long term feed deprivation and temperature variations resulted in granulomatosis, HSR induction, MAPK activation, ubiquitination, and triggering of the antioxidant defense and apoptotic machinery of the meagre. Although these responses were differentially expressed at each different imposed temperatures, the most significant variations were mainly observed below 20 degrees C and above 23 degrees C.

article,Performance of the SSI development function compared with 33 other functions applied to 79 arthropod species' datasets,"Quinn, Brady K.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The development rates of arthropods are temperature-dependent. Studies aiming to predict the dynamics of arachnid, crustacean, and insect populations in nature often require the derivation of development functions representing this phenomenon. A previous study (Quinn, B.K., 2017, J. Therm. Biol. 63, 65-77) identified 33 development functions commonly used in past studies on temperature-dependent development of arthropods, and illustrated that: (1) most of 99 past studies only applied one or few (2-5) development functions to their data without considering others; and (2) most of a subset of 79 studies' data were not fit with the actual best function for them, resulting in sometimes substantial differences in model performance and predictive ability. However, that study did not test the class of development functions based on theoretical enzyme thermodynamics, including the Sharpe-Schoolfield-Ikemoto (SSI) function. Herein, the meta-analyses done in that previous study were redone, after fitting all 79 reanalyzed datasets with the SSI function. Estimates of the intrinsic optimum temperature (T-Phi) for development of each tested species were also derived using the SSI function and compared among taxa. Including the SSI function in analyses did not change the conclusions of the previous study concerning development function usage, choice, and consequences. Notably, the SSI function performed as well as or relatively better than other functions of comparable or lower complexity in terms of R-2, AIC(C)-based rankings, Delta AIC(C) values, and prediction errors, which may recommend its more widespread use in future studies. Overall differences in T-Phi were found among arthropod subphyla, as well as between most species pairs.

With the variety of possible biomarkers of excessive fatigue that threaten health and life, a question arises which of them are the best and which should be considered in amateur long-distance runners showing particularly high individual variability. In this study differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) has been applied to show the overall effect of the 12-h run on blood sera of participants. Serum samples were obtained from the blood of ten male amateur long-distance runners, collected before and immediately after the run. Distinct changes in the shape of DSC curves have been observed for serum after finishing the run relative to pre-race serum. Statistically significant differences between stages ``before{''} and ``after{''} ultramarathon running have been found for parameters of the endothermic transition associated with denaturation of serum proteins.

article,An integrative analysis of the short-term effects of tail autotomy on thermoregulation and dehydration rates in wall lizards,"Fernandez-Rodriguez, Irene and Barroso, Frederico M. and Carretero, Miguel A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Maintaining body temperature is essential for the optimal performance of physiological functions. Ectotherms depend on external heat sources to thermoregulate. However, thermoregulation may be constrained by body condition and hydration state. Autotomy (i.e., the voluntary shed of a body part) evolved in various animal lineages and allowed surviving certain events (such as predator attacks), but it may affect body condition and volume/surface ratios, increase dehydration and constrain thermoregulation. In the framework of a general analysis of the evolution of autotomy, here we assessed the effects of tail loss on the thermal preferences and evaporative water loss rates (EWL) in the lizard Podarcis bocagei, integrating the thermal and hydric factors. We did not observe shifts in the thermal preferences of experimentally autotomized lizards when compared to the controls, which contradicted the hypothesis that they would raise preferred temperature to increase metabolic rates and accelerate regeneration. Evaporative water loss rates were also similar for tailed and tailless individuals, suggesting negligible increase of water loss through the injury and no specific ecophysiological responses after autotomy. Therefore, the changes observed in autotomized lizards in the field are to be considered primarily behavioural, rather than physiological, and thermoregulation could be secondarily affected by behavioural compensations for an increased predation risk after autotomy. Functional studies are necessary to understand how lizards' interaction with the environment is altered after autotomy, and further studies including different dehydration levels would be useful to fully understand the effect of water shortage on lizards' performance after caudal autotomy.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102976,99,NA,NA,102976,Autotomy; Ecophysiology; Thermoregulation; Dehydration; Evaporative water loss rates (EWL); Podarcis bocagei
article,Expression of candidate genes for residual feed intake in tropically adapted Bos taurus and Bos <i>indicus</i> bulls under thermoneutral and heat stress environmental conditions,"Pires, Bianca Vilela and Stafuzza, Nedenia Bonvino and de Freitas, Luara Afonso and Zerlotti Mercadante, Maria Eugenia and Ramos, Ester Silveira and Paro Paz, Claudia Cristina",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The objectives of this study were to measure the relative expression of the ATP1A1, NR3C1, POMC, NPY, and LEP genes in Caracu (Bos taurus) and Nelore (Bos indicus) bulls submitted to feed efficiency tests at high environmental temperatures, and to evaluate differences in adaptability to tropical conditions between breeds. Thirtyfive Caracu and 30 Nelore bulls were submitted to a feed efficiency test using automated feeding stations. At the end of the test, the animals were subjected to thermoneutral (TN) and heat stress (HS) conditions. Blood samples were collected after the exposure to the TN and HS conditions and the relative expression of genes was measured by qPCR. The bulls exhibited lower expression of ATP1A1 in the HS condition than in the TN condition (1.98 +/- 0.27 and 2.86 +/- 0.26, P = 0.02), while the relative expression of NR3C1, POMC, and LEP did not differ (P 0.05) between climatic conditions. The breed and feed intake influenced NPY and LEP expression levels (P < 0.05). Different climate conditions associated with residual feed intake can modify the gene expression patterns of ATP1A1 and NPY. The association observed among all genes studied shows that they are involved in appetite control. Bos taurus and Bos indicus bulls exhibited similar adaptability to tropical climate conditions.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102998,99,NA,NA,102998,Beef cattle; Feed efficiency; qPCR; Heat stress
article,Effects of N-acetyl-l-cysteine on heat stress-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in the hypothalamus of hens,"Zhao, Yulan and Zhuang, Yu and Shi, Yan and Xu, Zheng and Zhou, Changming and Guo, Lianying and Liu, Ping and Wu, Cong and Hu, Ruiming and Hu, Guoliang and Guo, Xiaoquan and Xu, Lanjiao",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The purpose of this study was to discuss the effects of N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) on heat stress-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in the hypothalamus of hens in different periods. A total of 120 Hy-Line variety brown laying hens (12 weeks old) were randomly assigned to 4 groups with 6 replicates. The control group (C group) (22 +/- 1 degrees C) received a basal diet, the NAC-treated group (N group) (22 +/- 1 degrees C) received a basal diet with 1000 mg/kg NAC, and 2 heat-stressed groups (36 +/- 1 degrees C for 10 h per day and 22 +/- 1 degrees C for the remaining time) were fed a basal diet (HS group) or a basal diet with 1000 mg/kg NAC (HS + N group) for 21 consecutive days. The influence of NAC on histologic changes, oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokine production was measured and analysed in hens with heat stress-induced hypothalamic changes. NAC effectively alleviated the hypothalamic morphological changes induced by heat stress. In addition, NAC attenuated the activity of the Nf-.B pathway activated by heat stress and decreased the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-18, TNF alpha, IKK, and IFN-gamma. In addition, NAC treatment regulated the expression of HO-1, GSH, SOD2 and PRDX3 by regulating the activity of Nrf2 at different time points to resist oxidative stress caused by heat exposure. In summary, dietary NAC may be an effective candidate for the treatment and prevention of heat stress-induced hypothalamus injury by preventing Nf-kappa B activation and controlling the Nrf2 pathway.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102927,98,NA,NA,102927,Hypothalamus; Heat stress; N-Acetyl-l-cysteine; Oxidative stress; Inflammation
article,"Physiological interactions with personal-protective clothing, physically demanding work and global warming: An Asia-Pacific perspective","Taylor, Nigel A. S. and Lee, Joo-Young and Kim, Siyeon and Notley, Sean R.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The Asia-Pacific contains over half of the world?s population, 21 countries have a Gross Domestic Product 25\% of the world?s largest economy, many countries have tropical climates and all suffer the impact of global warming. That ?perfect storm? exacerbates the risk of occupational heat illness, yet first responders must perform physically demanding work wearing personal-protective clothing and equipment. Unfortunately, the Eurocentric emphasis of past research has sometimes reduced its applicability to other ethnic groups. To redress that imbalance, relevant contemporary research has been reviewed, to which has been added information applicable to people of Asian, Melanesian and Polynesian ancestry. An epidemiological triad is used to identify the causal agents and host factors of work intolerance within hot-humid climates, commencing with the size dependency of resting metabolism and heat production accompanying load carriage, followed by a progression from the impact of single-layered clothing through to encapsulating ensembles. A morphological hypothesis is presented to account for inter-individual differences in heat production and heat loss, which seems to explain apparent ethnicand gender-related differences in thermoregulation, at least within thermally compensable states. The mechanisms underlying work intolerance, cardiovascular insufficiency and heat illness are reviewed, along with epidemiological data from the Asia-Pacific. Finally, evidence-based preventative and treatment strategies are presented and updated concerning moisture-management fabrics and barriers, dehydration, pre- and postexercise cooling, and heat adaptation. An extensive reference list is provided, with 25 recommendations enabling physiologists, occupational health specialists, policy makers, purchasing officers and manufacturers to rapidly extract interpretative outcomes pertinent to the Asia-Pacific.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102858,97,NA,NA,102858,Ageing; Clothing; Cooling; Dehydration; Ethnic; Firefighters; Gender; Heat adaptation; Heat illness; Load carriage; Protective clothing
article,Thermal heterogeneity of selected retreats in cool-temperate viviparous lizards suggests a potential benefit of future climate warming,"Chukwuka, Christian O. and Mello, Ricardo S. R. and Cree, Alison and Monks, Joanne M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Rocky retreats are limited and geologically constrained resources for rock-dwelling nocturnal lizards. Such lizards should seek retreats that offer thermoregulatory benefits without the risk of overheating during the day, and that protect from predation. For cold-adapted species where air temperature is frequently lower than optimum temperature for performance, factors influencing retreat-site selection and whether future warmer conditions will force superficial rock slabs to be abandoned on hot days remain poorly known. Here, we predicted that retreats selected by a nocturnally foraging, cool-temperate gecko from southern New Zealand would be thermally heterogeneous and that future warmer temperature will force lizards to abandon daytime retreats on hot days. We sampled loose rock slabs (potential retreats) in a tussock-grassland site in all seasons. We measured seasonal rock temperature profiles and field body temperature (Tb) of captured geckos using thermography and quantified the physical characteristics of each potential retreat. We found that both physical characteristics and rock temperatures determine choice of retreats. Field Tb of lizards positively correlated with retreat and air temperatures. Also, retreat temperatures, including those of the substrate below the rock slabs, showed complex heterogeneity enabling lizards to choose microsites within retreats to achieve preferred body temperatures intermittently. Observed seasonal shifts in characteristics of occupied rocks imply that lizards choose retreats to maximise warmth in spring, minimise risk of overheating (remain below voluntary thermal maximum, VTmax) in summer and avoid freezing over winter. Our study demonstrates the importance of microclimatic conditions in influencing retreat-site selection. Climate warming might lead to seasonal changes in use of rock slabs and possibly be beneficial initially, but longer-term implications need to be examined.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102869,97,NA,NA,102869,Microclimate; Retreat-site selection; Thermogram; Field-body temperature; Nocturnal lizard
article,"Thermoneutral zone for laying hens based on environmental conditions, enthalpy and thermal comfort indexes","Vilas Boas Ribeiro, Bruna Pontara and Yanagi Junior, Tadayuki and de Oliveira, Daniela Duarte and de Lima, Renato Ribeiro and Zangeronimo, Marcio Gilberto",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Controlling environmental conditions inside laying hens facilities systems and their effects on physiology and performance is essential in defining management strategies to alleviate the adverse effects of thermal stress in laying hens. Thus, we estimated thermoneutral zones for laying hens exposed to different heat-challenging conditions based on environmental conditions, enthalpy, and thermal comfort indexes being evaluated out in four thermal environment-controlled wind tunnels equipped with heating and air moistening function, housed in an experimental room with an area of 31.92 m(2). Clustering analysis and empirical models were used to estimate thermoneutral zones for laying hens based on environmental conditions, enthalpy and thermal comfort indexes, and compare them with data available in the literature through graphics. The thermoneutral zones characterizing homeostasis for laying hens based on respiration rate (RR) are as follows: from 25.9 to 29.9 degrees C for air dry-bulb temperature (t(db)), from 67 to 75 for temperature-humidity index (THI), from 68 to 73 for black globe-humidity index (BGHI), from 45 to 56 kJ kg dry air(-1) for enthalpy (H) and 441.7-465.6 W for radiant heat load (RHL). Comfort limits for physiological responses cloacal temperature (t(clo)), surface temperature (t(sur)) and RR found in this study are 39.4-39.9 degrees C, 26.5 to 29.9 degrees C and 30 to 67 mov. min(-1), respectively. The number of repetitions and the use of mathematical modeling to be worked on, may directly impact the amplitude of each limit to be established for each variable of interest.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102678,93,NA,NA,102678,Thermal environment; Egg-laying poultry; Thermal comfort ranges; Empirical models
