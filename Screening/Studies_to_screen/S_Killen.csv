article,Dynamic digestive physiology of a female reproductive organ in a polyandrous butterfly,"Plakke, Melissa S. and Deutsch, Aaron B. and Meslin, Camille and Clark, Nathan L. and Morehouse, Nathan I.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Reproductive traits experience high levels of selection because of their direct ties to fitness, often resulting in rapid adaptive evolution. Much of the work in this area has focused on male reproductive traits. However, a more comprehensive understanding of female reproductive adaptations and their relationship to male characters is crucial to uncover the relative roles of sexual cooperation and conflict in driving co-evolutionary dynamics between the sexes. We focus on the physiology of a complex female reproductive adaptation in butterflies and moths: a stomach-like organ in the female reproductive tract called the bursa copulatrix that digests the male ejaculate (spermatophore). Little is known about how the bursa digests the spermatophore. We characterized bursa proteolytic capacity in relation to female state in the polyandrous butterfly Pieris rapae. We found that the virgin bursa exhibits extremely high levels of proteolytic activity. Furthermore, in virgin females, bursal proteolytic capacity increases with time since eclosion and ambient temperature, but is not sensitive to the pre-mating social environment. Post copulation, bursal proteolytic activity decreases rapidly before rebounding toward the end of a mating cycle, suggesting active female regulation of proteolysis and/or potential quenching of proteolysis by male ejaculate constituents. Using transcriptomic and proteomic approaches, we report identities for nine proteases actively transcribed by bursal tissue and/or expressed in the bursal lumen that may contribute to observed bursal proteolysis. We discuss how these dynamic physiological characteristics may function as female adaptations resulting from sexual conflict over female remating rate in this polyandrous butterfly.",2015,10.1242/jeb.118323,218,10,1548-1555,NA,Lepidoptera; Bursa copulatrix; Pieris rapae; Proteolysis; Sexual conflict; Spermatophore
article,Disruption of insulin signalling affects the neuroendocrine stress reaction in <i>Drosophila</i> females,"Rauschenbach, Inga Y. and Karpova, Evgenia K. and Adonyeva, Natalya V. and Andreenkova, Olga V. and Faddeeva, Natalya V. and Burdina, Elena V. and Alekseev, Alexander A. and Menshanov, Petr N. and Gruntenko, Nataly E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Juvenile hormone (JH) and dopamine are involved in the stress response in insects. The insulin/insulin-like growth factor signalling pathway has also recently been found to be involved in the regulation of various processes, including stress tolerance. However, the relationships between the JH, dopamine and insulin signalling pathways remain unclear. Here, we study the role of insulin signalling in the regulation of JH and dopamine metabolism under normal and heat stress conditions in Drosophila melanogaster females. We show that suppression of the insulin-like receptor (InR) in the corpus allatum, a specialised endocrine gland that synthesises JH, causes an increase in dopamine level and JH-hydrolysing activity and alters the activities of enzymes that produce as well as those that degrade dopamine {[}alkaline phosphatase (ALP), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine-dependent arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (DAT)]. We also found that InR suppression in the corpus allatum modulates dopamine, ALP, TH and JH-hydrolysing activity in response to heat stress and that it decreases the fecundity of the flies. JH application restores dopamine metabolism and fecundity in females with decreased InR expression in the corpus allatum. Our data provide evidence that the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signalling pathway regulates dopamine metabolism in females of D. melanogaster via the system of JH metabolism and that it affects the development of the neuroendocrine stress reaction and interacts with JH in the control of reproduction in this species.",2014,10.1242/jeb.106815,217,20,3733-3741,NA,Drosophila; Insulin-like receptor; Juvenile hormone; Dopamine; Heat stress
article,Similar specificities of symbiont uptake by adults and larvae in an anemone model system for coral biology,"Hambleton, Elizabeth A. and Guse, Annika and Pringle, John R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Reef-building corals depend for much of their energy on photosynthesis by symbiotic dinoflagellate algae (genus Symbiodinium) that live within their gastrodermal cells. However, the cellular mechanisms underpinning this ecologically critical symbiosis, including those governing the specificity of symbiont uptake by the host, remain poorly understood, in part because of the difficulties of working with corals in the laboratory. Here, we used the small symbiotic sea anemone Aiptasia as an experimentally tractable model system to analyze the specificity and timing of symbiosis onset in larval and adult animals under controlled laboratory conditions. Using four clonal, axenic Symbiodinium strains, we found no difference in uptake specificity between larvae (even when very young) and adults. Although both compatible and incompatible algal strains were found within the larval guts, only the former appeared to be internalized by gastrodermal cells, and they (but not incompatible algae) proliferated rapidly within the larvae in the absence of detectable exchange with other larvae. Older larvae showed reduced ingestion of both compatible and incompatible algae, and the addition of food failed to promote the uptake of an incompatible algal strain. Thus, Aiptasia adults and larvae appear to have similar mechanisms for discriminating between compatible and incompatible dinoflagellate types prior to phagocytosis by host gastrodermal cells. Whether a particular algal strain is compatible or incompatible appears to be stable during years of axenic culture in the absence of a host. These studies provide a foundation for future analyses of the mechanisms of symbiont-uptake specificity in this emerging model system.",2014,10.1242/jeb.095679,217,9,1613-1619,NA,Anemone; Cnidarian; Coral reefs; Dinoflagellate; Planulae larvae; Symbiosis
article,Are torpid bats immune to anthropogenic noise?,"Luo, Jinhong and Clarin, B. -Markus and Borissov, Ivailo M. and Siemers, Bjoern M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Anthropogenic noise has a negative impact on a variety of animals. However, many bat species roost in places with high levels of anthropogenic noise. Here, we tested the hypothesis that torpid bats are insensitive to anthropogenic noise. In a laboratory experiment, we recorded skin temperature (T-sk) of bats roosting individually that were subjected to playbacks of different types of noise. We found that torpid bats with T-sk similar to 10 degrees C lower than their active T-sk responded to all types of noise by elevating Tsk. Bats responded most strongly to colony and vegetation noise, and most weakly to traffic noise. The time of day when torpid bats were exposed to noise had a pronounced effect on responses. Torpid bats showed increasing responses from morning towards evening, i.e. towards the onset of the active phase. Skin temperature at the onset of noise exposure (T-sk,T-start, 17-29 degrees C) was not related to the response. Moreover, we found evidence that torpid bats rapidly habituated to repeated and prolonged noise exposure.",2014,10.1242/jeb.092890,217,7,1072-1078,NA,Anthropogenic noise; Habituation; Myotis myotis; Roosting bat; Torpor; Traffic noise
article,"Divergence in cell cycle progression is associated with shifted phenology in a multivoltine moth: the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis","Xia, Qinwen and Chen, Chao and Dopman, Erik B. and Hahn, Daniel A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Evolutionary change in diapause timing can be an adaptive response to changing seasonality, and even result in ecological speciation. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating shifts in diapause timing remain poorly understood. One of the hallmarks of diapause is a massive slowdown in the cell cycle of target organs such as the brain and primordial imaginal structures, and resumption of cell cycle proliferation is an indication of diapause termination and resumption of development. Characterizing cell cycle parameters between lineages differing in diapause life history timing may help identify molecular mechanisms associated with alterations of diapause timing. We tested the extent to which progression of the cell cycle differs across diapause between two genetically distinct European corn borer strains that differ in their seasonal diapause timing. We show the cell cycle slows down during larval diapause with a significant decrease in the proportion of cells in S phase. Brain-subesophageal complex cells slow primarily in G0/G1 phase whereas most wing disc cells are in G2 phase. Diapausing larvae of the earlier emerging, bivoltine E-strain (BE) suppressed cell cycle progression less than the later emerging, univoltine Z-strain (UZ) individuals, with a greater proportion of cells in S phase across both tissues during diapause. Additionally, resumption of cell cycle proliferation occurred earlier in the BE strain than in the UZ strain after exposure to diapause-terminating conditions. We propose that regulation of cell cycle progression rates ultimately drives differences in larval diapause termination, and adult emergence timing, between early- and late-emerging European corn borer strains.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245244,226,11,NA,jeb245244,Cell cycle; Diapause; Phenology; Gene expression
article,Effects of a parasympathetic blocker on the heart rate of loggerhead sea turtles during voluntary diving,"Saito, Ayaka and Kinoshita, Chihiro and Kawai, Megumi and Fukuoka, Takuya and Sato, Katsufumi and Sakamoto, Kentaro Q.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Diving bradycardia is a reduction in the heart rate mediated by the parasympathetic system during diving. Although diving bradycardia is pronounced in aquatic mammals and birds, the existence of this response in aquatic reptiles, including sea turtles, remains under debate. Using the parasympathetic blocker atropine, we evaluated the involvement of the parasympathetic nervous system in heart rate reduction of loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) during voluntary diving in tanks. The heart rate of the control group dropped by 40-60\% from the pre-dive value at the onset of diving; however, administration of atropine significantly inhibited heart rate reduction (P<0.001). Our results indicate that, similar to mammals and birds, the heart rate reduction in sea turtles while diving is primarily mediated by the parasympathetic nervous system. In conclusion, we suggest that diving bradycardia exists not only in aquatic mammals and birds but also in aquatic reptiles.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243922,225,9,NA,jeb243922,Diving physiology; Diving bradycardia; Heart rate; Atropine; Caretta caretta; Parasympathetic nervous system
article,Responses of activity rhythms to temperature cues evolve in <i>Drosophila</i> populations selected for divergent timing of eclosion,"Lakshman, Abhilash and Kalliyil, Arshad and Sheeba, Vasu",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Even though the rhythms in adult emergence and locomotor activity are two different phenomena that occur at distinct life stages of the fly life cycle, previous studies have hinted at similarities in certain aspects of the organisation of the circadian clock driving these two rhythms. For instance, the period gene plays an important regulatory role in both rhythms. In an earlier study, we have shown that selection on timing of adult emergence behaviour in populations of Drosophila melanogaster leads to the co-evolution of temperature sensitivity of circadian clocks driving eclosion. In this study, we investigated whether temperature sensitivity of the locomotor activity rhythm evolved in our populations separately from the adult emergence rhythm, with the goal of understanding the extent of similarity (or lack thereof) in circadian organisation underlying the two rhythms. We found that in response to simulated jetlag with temperature cycles, late chronotypes (populations selected for predominant emergence during dusk) indeed re-entrained faster than early chronotypes (populations selected for predominant emergence during dawn) to 6 h phase delays, thereby indicating enhanced sensitivity of the activity/rest clock to temperature cues in these stocks (entrainment is the synchronisation of internal rhythms to cyclic environmental time cues). Additionally, we found that late chronotypes show higher plasticity of phases across regimes, day-to-day stability in phases and amplitude of entrainment, all indicative of enhanced temperaturesensitive activity/rest rhythms. Our results highlight remarkably similar organisation principles between circadian clocks regulating emergence and activity/rest rhythms.",2020,10.1242/jeb.222414,223,11,NA,jeb222414,After-effects; Circadian; Chronotypes; Entrainment; Jetlag; Phase response curve
article,Habituation of the cardiovascular response to restraint stress is inhibited by exposure to other stressor stimuli and exercise training,"Benini, Ricardo and Oliveira, Leandro A. and Gomes-de-Souza, Lucas and Rodrigues, Bruno and Crestani, Carlos C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"This study evaluated the effect of exposure to either a chronic variable stress (CVS) protocol or social isolation, as well as treadmill exercise training, in the habituation of the cardiovascular response upon repeated exposure to restraint stress in rats. The habituation of the corticosterone response to repeated restraint stress was also evaluated. For this, animals were subjected to either acute or 10 daily sessions of 60 min of restraint stress. CVS and social isolation protocols lasted for 10 consecutive days, whereas treadmill training was performed for 1 h per day, 5 days per week for 8 weeks. We observed that the increase in serum corticosterone was reduced during both the stress and the recovery period of the 10th session of restraint. Habituation of the cardiovascular response was identified in terms of a faster return of heart rate to baseline values during the recovery period of the 10th session of restraint. The increase in blood pressure and the decrease in tail skin temperature were similar at the 1st and 10th session of restraint. Exposure to CVS, social isolation or treadmill exercise training inhibited the habituation of the restraint-evoked tachycardia. Additionally, CVS increased the blood pressure response at the 10th session of restraint, whereas social isolation enhanced both the tachycardia during the first session and the drop in skin temperature at the 10th session of restraint. Taken together, these findings provide new evidence that pathologies evoked by stress might be related to impairment in the habituation process to homotypic stressors.",2020,10.1242/jeb.219501,223,8,NA,jeb219501,Adaptation; Blood pressure; Heart rate; Corticosterone; Chronic variable stress; Social isolation

B. and Eggers, A. R. and Lemus, J. D. and Gates, R. D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Predicting the sensitivity of reef-building corals to disturbance, including bleaching, requires an understanding of physiological responses to stressors, which may be limited by destructive sampling and the capacity of common methodologies to characterize early life history stages. We developed a new methodology using laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) to measure and track the physiological condition of corals. In a thermal stress experiment, we used LSCM to track coral condition during bleaching in adults and juveniles of two species, Montipora capitata and Pocillopora acuta. Depth of fluorescence in coral tissues provides a proxy measure of tissue thickness, whereas Symbiodiniaceae population fluorescence relates to both population density and chlorophyll a content. In response to thermal stress, there were significant shifts in tissue thickness and Symbiodiniaceae fluorescence with differences between life stages. This method is particularly well suited for detecting shifts in physiological condition of living corals in laboratory studies, especially in small juvenile colonies.",2020,10.1242/jeb.220335,223,6,NA,jeb220335,Physiology; Bleaching; Juvenile; Montipora capitata; Pocillopora acuta; Early life history
article,An improved method for detecting torpor entrance and arousal in a mammalian hibernator using heart rate data,"MacCannell, Amanda D. V. and Jackson, Ethan C. and Mathers, Katherine E. and Staples, James F.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"We used electrocardiogram (ECG) telemeters to measure the heart rate of hibernating Ictidomys tridecemlineatus (thirteen-lined ground squirrel). An increase in heart rate from 2.2 to 5 beats min(-1) accurately identified arousal from torpor before any change in body temperature was detected. Variability in raw heart rate data was significantly reduced by a forward-backward Butterworth low-pass filter, allowing for discrete differential analysis. A decrease in filtered heart rate to 70\% of maximum values in interbout euthermia (from approximately 312 to 235 beats min(-1)) accurately detected entrance into torpor bouts. At this point, body temperature had fallen from 36.1 degrees C to only 34.7 degrees C, much higher than the 30 degrees C typically used to identify entrance. Using these heart rate criteria allowed advanced detection of entrance and arousal (detected 51.9 and 76 min earlier, respectively), compared with traditional body temperature criteria. This method will improve our ability to detect biochemical and molecular markers underlying these transition periods, during which many physiological changes occur.",2018,10.1242/jeb.174508,221,4,NA,jeb174508,Butterworth filter; Electrocardiogram; ECG; Hibernation; Ictidomys
article,The effects of 8 weeks voluntary wheel running on the contractile performance of isolated locomotory (soleus) and respiratory (diaphragm) skeletal muscle during early ageing,"Tallis, Jason and Higgins, Matthew F. and Seebacher, Frank and Cox, Val M. and Duncan, Michael J. and James, Rob S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Decreased skeletal muscle performance with increasing age is strongly associated with reduced mobility and quality of life. Increased physical activity is a widely prescribed method of reducing the detrimental effects of ageing on skeletal muscle contractility. The present study used isometric and work loop testing protocols to uniquely investigate the effects of 8 weeks of voluntary wheel running on the contractile performance of isolated dynapenic soleus and diaphragm muscles of 38-week-old CD1 mice. When compared with untrained controls, voluntary wheel running induced significant improvements in maximal isometric stress and work loop power, a reduced resistance to fatigue, but greater cumulative work during fatiguing work loop contractions in isolated muscle. These differences occurred without appreciable changes in lactate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, sarco-endoplasmic reticulum ATPase or myosin heavy chain expression synonymous with this form of training in younger rodent models. Despite the given improvement in contractile performance, the average running distance significantly declined over the course of the training period, indicating that this form of training may not be sufficient to fully counteract the longer-term ageing-induced decline in skeletal muscle contractile performance. Although these results indicate that regular low-intensity physical activity may be beneficial in offsetting the age-related decline in skeletal muscle contractility, future work focusing on the maintenance of a healthy body mass with increasing age and its effects on myosinactin cross-bridge kinetics and Ca2+ handling is needed to clarify the mechanisms causing the improved contractile performance in trained dynapenic skeletal muscle.",2017,10.1242/jeb.166603,220,20,3733-3741,NA,Dynapenia; Training; Contractile performance; Weight management; Sarcopenia
article,"Turbulence induces metabolically costly behaviors and inhibits food capture in oyster larvae, causing net energy loss","Fuchs, Heidi L. and Specht, Jaclyn A. and Adams, Diane K. and Christman, Adam J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Planktotrophic invertebrate larvae require energy to develop, disperse and settle successfully, and it is unknown how their energetics are impacted by turbulence. Ciliated larvae gain metabolic energy from their phytoplankton food to offset the energetic costs of growth, development and ciliary activity for swimming and feeding. Turbulence may affect the energetic balance by inducing behaviors that alter the metabolic costs and efficiency of swimming, by raising the encounter rate with food particles and by inhibiting food capture. We used experiments and an empirical model to quantify the net rate of energy gain, swimming efficiency and food capture efficiency for eyed oyster larvae (Crassostrea virginica) in turbulence. At dissipation rates representative of coastal waters, larvae lost energy even when food concentrations were very high. Both feeding activity and turbulence-induced behaviors incurred high metabolic costs. Swimming efficiency was concave up versus dissipation rate, suggesting that ciliary activity for food handling became more costly while swimming became more efficient with turbulence intensity. Though counter-intuitive, swimming may have become more efficient in turbulence because vorticity-induced rotation caused larvae to swim more horizontally, which requires less effort than swimming vertically against the pull of gravity. Overall, however, larvae failed to offset high activity costs with food energy gains because turbulence reduced food capture efficiency more than it enhanced food encounter rates. Younger, smaller larvae may have some energetic advantages, but competent larvae would lose energy at turbulence intensities they experience frequently, suggesting that turbulence-induced starvation may account for much of oysters' high larval mortality.",2017,10.1242/jeb.161125,220,19,3419-3431,NA,Aerobic scope; Capture efficiency; Ciliary swimming; Clearance rate; Kolmogorov scale; Swimming efficiency
article,"Feeding on ripening and over-ripening fruit: interactions between sugar, ethanol and polyphenol contents in a tropical butterfly","Beaulieu, Michael and Franke, Kristin and Fischer, Klaus",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In ripe fruit, energy mostly derives from sugar, while in over-ripe fruit, it also comes from ethanol. Such ripeness differences may alter the fitness benefits associated with frugivory if animals are unable to degrade ethanol when consuming over-ripe fruit. In the tropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana, we found that females consuming isocaloric solutions mimicking ripe (20\% sucrose) and over-ripe fruit (10\% sucrose, 7\% ethanol) of the palm Astrocaryum standleyanum exhibited higher fecundity than females consuming a solution mimicking unripe fruit (10\% sucrose). Moreover, relative to butterflies consuming a solution mimicking unripe fruit, survival was enhanced when butterflies consumed a solution mimicking either ripe fruit supplemented with polyphenols (fruit antioxidant compounds) or over-ripe fruit devoid of polyphenols. This suggests that (1) butterflies have evolved tolerance mechanisms to derive the same reproductive benefits from ethanol and sugar, and (2) polyphenols may regulate the allocation of sugar and ethanol to maintenance mechanisms. However, variation in fitness owing to the composition of feeding solutions was not paralleled by corresponding physiological changes (alcohol dehydrogenase activity, oxidative status) in butterflies. The fitness proxies and physiological parameters that we measured therefore appear to reflect distinct biological pathways. Overall, our results highlight that the energy content of fruit primarily affects the fecundity of B. anynana butterflies, while the effects of fruit consumption on survival are more complex and vary depending on ripening stage and polyphenol presence. The actual underlying physiological mechanisms linking fruit ripeness and fitness components remain to be clarified.",2017,10.1242/jeb.162008,220,17,3127-3134,NA,Diet; Frugivory; Insect; Nutrient interactions; Tropics
article,A disparity between locomotor economy and territory- holding ability in male house mice,"Morris, Jeremy S. and Ruff, James S. and Potts, Wayne K. and Carrier, David R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Both economical locomotion and physical fighting are important performance traits to many species because of their direct influence on components of Darwinian fitness. Locomotion represents a substantial portion of the total daily energy budget of many animals. Fighting performance often determines individual reproductive fitness through the means of resource control, social dominance and access to mates. However, phenotypic traits that improve either locomotor economy or fighting ability may diminish performance in the other. Here, we tested for a predicted disparity between locomotor economy and competitive ability in wild-derived house mice (Mus musculus). We used 8 week social competition trials in semi-natural enclosures to directly measure male competitive ability through territorial control and female occupancy within territories. We also measured oxygen consumption during locomotion for each mouse using running trials in an enclosed treadmill and open-flow respirometry. Our results show that territory-holding males have higher absolute and mass-specific oxygen consumption when running (i.e. reduced locomotor economy) compared with males that do not control territories. This relationship was present both before and after 8 week competition trials in semi-natural enclosures. This disparity between physical competitive ability and economical locomotion may impose viability costs on males in species for which competition over mates is common and may constrain the evolution of behavioral and phenotypic diversity, particularly in natural settings with environmental and resource variability.",2017,10.1242/jeb.154823,220,14,2521-2528,NA,Male-male aggression; Cost of transport; Functional trade-offs; Sexual selection; Whole-organism performance
article,Impact damage and repair in shells of the limpet <i>Patella vulgata</i>,"Taylor, David",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Experiments and observations were carried out to investigate the response of the Patella vulgata limpet shell to impact. Dropped-weight impact tests created damage that usually took the form of a hole in the shell's apex. Similar damage was found to occur naturally, presumably as a result of stones propelled by the sea during storms. Apex holes were usually fatal, but small holes were sometimes repaired, and the repaired shell was as strong as the original, undamaged shell. The impact strength (energy to failure) of shells tested in situ was found to be 3.4-times higher than that of empty shells found on the beach. Surprisingly, strength was not affected by removing the shell from its home location, or by removing the limpet from the shell and allowing the shell to dry out. Sand abrasion, which removes material from the apex, was found to have a strong effect. Shells were also subjected to repeated impacts, which caused failure after 2-120 repetitions. In situ shells performed poorly in this test. It is proposed that the apex acts as a kind of sacrificial feature, which confers increased resistance but only for a small number of impacts. Microscopy showed that damage initiates internally as delamination cracks on low-energy interfaces, leading to loss of material by spalling. This mode of failure is a consequence of the layered structure of the shell, which makes it vulnerable to the tensile and shear stresses in the impact shock wave.",2016,10.1242/jeb.149880,219,24,3927-3935,NA,Limpet; Patella vulgata; Fatigue; Damage; Spalling; Delamination
article,"The private life of echidnas: using accelerometry and GPS to examine field biomechanics and assess the ecological impact of a widespread, semi-fossorial monotreme","Clemente, Christofer J. and Cooper, Christine E. and Withers, Philip C. and Freakley, Craig and Singh, Surya and Terrill, Philip",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) is a monotreme and therefore provides a unique combination of phylogenetic history, morphological differentiation and ecological specialisation for a mammal. The echidna has a unique appendicular skeleton, a highly specialised myrmecophagous lifestyle and a mode of locomotion that is neither typically mammalian nor reptilian, but has aspects of both lineages. We therefore were interested in the interactions of locomotor biomechanics, ecology and movements for wild, free-living short-beaked echidnas. To assess locomotion in its complex natural environment, we attached both GPS and accelerometer loggers to the back of echidnas in both spring and summer. We found that the locomotor biomechanics of echidnas is unique, with lower stride length and stride frequency than reported for similar-sized mammals. Speed modulation is primarily accomplished through changes in stride frequency, with a mean of 1.39 Hz and a maximum of 2.31 Hz. Daily activity period was linked to ambient air temperature, which restricted daytime activity during the hotter summer months. Echidnas had longer activity periods and longer digging bouts in spring compared with summer. In summer, echidnas had higher walking speeds than in spring, perhaps because of the shorter time suitable for activity. Echidnas spent, on average, 12\% of their time digging, which indicates their potential to excavate up to 204 m(3) of soil a year.

article,Disentangling the visual cues used by a jumping spider to locate its microhabitat,"Tedore, Cynthia and Johnsen, Sonke",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Many arthropod species have evolved to thrive only on the leaves of a particular species of plant, which they must be capable of finding in order to survive accidental displacement, developmental transitions or the changing of the seasons. A number of studies have tested whether such species select leaves to land or oviposit on based on their color, shape or size. Unfortunately, many studies did not control for correlates of these characters, such as the brightness of different colors, the areas of different shapes, and the level of ambient illumination in the vicinity of different sizes of leaves. In the present study, we tested for leaf color, shape and size preferences in a leafd-welling jumping spider (Lyssomanes viridis) with known summer and winter host plants, while controlling for these correlates. First, color preferences were tested outdoors under the natural illumination of their forest habitat. Lyssomanes viridis did not prefer to perch on a green substrate compared with various shades of gray, but did prefer the second darkest shade of gray we presented them with. Of the green and gray substrates, this shade of gray's integrated photon flux (350-700 nm), viewed from below, i.e. the spider's perspective in the arena, was the most similar to that of real leaves. This relationship also held when we weighted the transmitted photon flux by the jumping spiders' green photopigment spectral sensitivity. Spiders did not prefer the star-like leaf shape of their summer host plant, Liquidambar styraciflua, to a green circle of the same area. When given a choice between a L. styraciflua leaf-shaped stimulus that was half the area of an otherwise identical alternative, spiders preferred the larger stimulus. However, placing a neutral density filter over the side of the experimental arena with the smaller stimulus abolished this preference, with spiders then being more likely to choose the side of the arena with the smaller stimulus. In conclusion, L. viridis appears to use ambient illumination and possibly perceived leaf brightness but not leaf shape or color to locate its microhabitat. This calls for a careful re-examination of which visual cues a variety of arthropods are actually attending to when they search for their preferred host species or microhabitat.",2016,10.1242/jeb.129122,219,15,2396-2401,NA,Habitat selection; Color vision; Salticidae; Visual search; Forest

In this study, we examined whether their semi-aquatic lifestyle and ambush hunting mode are reflected in specific adaptations in the peripheral visual system. Design-based stereology and microspectrophotometry were used to assess spatial resolving power and spectral sensitivity of saltwater (Crocodylus porosus) and freshwater crocodiles (Crocodylus johnstoni). Both species possess a foveal streak that spans the naso-temporal axis and mediates high spatial acuity across the central visual field. The saltwater crocodile and freshwater crocodile have a peak spatial resolving power of 8.8 and 8.0 cycles deg(-1), respectively. Measurement of the outer segment dimensions and spectral absorbance revealed five distinct photoreceptor types consisting of three single cones, one twin cone and a rod. The three single cones (saltwater/freshwater crocodile) are violet (424/426 nm lambda(max)), green (502/510 nm lambda(max)) and red (546/554 nm lambda(max)) sensitive, indicating the potential for trichromatic colour vision. The visual pigments of both members of the twin cones have the same lambda(max) as the red-sensitive single cone and the rod has a lambda(max) at 503/510 nm (saltwater/freshwater). The lambda(max) values of all types of visual pigment occur at longer wavelengths in the freshwater crocodile compared with the saltwater crocodile. Given that there is a greater abundance of long wavelength light in freshwater compared with a saltwater environment, the photoreceptors would be more effective at detecting light in their respective habitats. This suggests that the visual systems of both species are adapted to the photic conditions of their respective ecological niche.",2016,10.1242/jeb.135673,219,9,1394-1404,NA,Microspectrophotometry; Retinal topography; Visual ecology; Chromophore shift; Reptile
article,The sexually dimorphic behaviour of adult <i>Drosophila suzukii</i>: elevated female locomotor activity and loss of siesta is a postmating response,"Ferguson, Calum T. J. and O'Neill, Tara L. and Audsley, Neil and Isaac, R. Elwyn",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The polyphagous Drosophila suzukii is a highly invasive species that causes extensive damage to a wide range of berry and stone fruit crops. A better understanding of its biology and especially its behaviour will aid the development of new control strategies. We investigated the locomotor behaviour of D. suzukii in a semi-natural environment resembling a typical summer in northern England and show that adult female D. suzukii are at least 4-fold more active during daylight hours than adult males. This result was reproduced in several laboratory environments and was shown to be a robust feature of mated, but not virgin, female flies. Both males and virgin females kept on a 12 h light: 12 h dark (12LD) cycle and constant temperature displayed night-time inactivity (sleep) followed by weak activity in the morning, an afternoon period of quiescence (siesta) and then a prominent evening peak of activity. Both the siesta and the sharp evening peak at lights off were severely reduced in females after mating. Flies of either sex entrained in 12LD displayed a circadian pattern of activity in constant darkness confirming the importance of an endogenous clock in regulating adult activity. This response of females to mating is similar to that elicited in female Drosophila melanogaster by the male sex peptide (SP). We used mass spectrometry to identify a molecular ion (m/z, 5145) corresponding to the poly-hydroxylated SP of D. suzukii and to show that this molecule is transferred to the female reproductive tract during copulation. We propose that the siesta experienced by male and virgin female D. suzukii is an adaptation to avoid unnecessary exposure to the afternoon sun, but that mated females faced with the challenge of obtaining resources for egg production and finding oviposition sites take greater risks, and we suggest that the change in female behaviour is induced by the male SP.",2015,10.1242/jeb.125468,218,23,3855-3861,NA,Sex peptide; Fruit fly; Pest management; Sleep; Circadian rhythm
article,Rapid maturation of the muscle biochemistry that supports diving in Pacific walruses (<i>Odobenus rosmarus divergens</i>),"Noren, Shawn R. and Jay, Chadwick V. and Burns, Jennifer M. and Fischbach, Anthony S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Physiological constraints dictate animals' ability to exploit habitats. For marine mammals, it is important to quantify physiological limits that influence diving and their ability to alter foraging behaviors. We characterized age-specific dive limits of walruses by measuring anaerobic (acid-buffering capacity) and aerobic (myoglobin content) capacities of the muscles that power hind (longissimus dorsi) and fore (supraspinatus) flipper propulsion. Mean buffering capacities were similar across muscles and age classes (a fetus, five neonatal calves, a 3 month old and 20 adults), ranging from 41.31 to 54.14 slykes and 42.00 to 46.93 slykes in the longissimus and supraspinatus, respectively. Mean myoglobin in the fetus and neonatal calves fell within a narrow range (longissimus: 0.92-1.68 g 100 g(-1) wet muscle mass; supraspinatus: 0.88-1.64 g 100 g(-1) wet muscle mass). By 3 monthspost-partum, myoglobin in the longissimus increased by 79\%, but levels in the supraspinatus remained unaltered. From 3 months post-partum to adulthood, myoglobin increased by an additional 26\% in the longissimus and increased by 126\% in the supraspinatus; myoglobin remained greater in the longissimus compared with the supraspinatus. Walruses are unique among marine mammals because they are born with a mature muscle acid-buffering capacity and attain mature myoglobin content early in life. Despite rapid physiological development, small body size limits the diving capacity of immature walruses and extreme sexual dimorphism reduces the diving capacity of adult females compared with adult males. Thus, free-ranging immature walruses likely exhibit the shortest foraging dives while adult males are capable of the longest foraging dives.",2015,10.1242/jeb.125757,218,20,3319-3329,NA,Odobenid; Myoglobin; Acid buffering; Ontogeny; Aerobic dive limit; Arctic
article,"Oxidative phosphorylation efficiency, proton conductance and reactive oxygen species production of liver mitochondria correlates with body mass in frogs","Roussel, Damien and Salin, Karine and Dumet, Adeline and Romestaing, Caroline and Rey, Benjamin and Voituron, Yann",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Body size is a central biological parameter affecting most biological processes (especially energetics) and the mitochondrion is a key organelle controlling metabolism and is also the cell's main source of chemical energy. However, the link between body size and mitochondrial function is still unclear, especially in ectotherms. In this study, we investigated several parameters of mitochondrial bioenergetics in the liver of three closely related species of frog (the common frog Rana temporaria, the marsh frog Pelophylax ridibundus and the bull frog Lithobates catesbeiana). These particular species were chosen because of their differences in adult bodymass. We found that mitochondrial coupling efficiency was markedly increased with animal size, which led to a higher ATP production (+70\%) in the larger frogs (L. catesbeiana) compared with the smaller frogs (R. temporaria). This was essentially driven by a strong negative dependence of mitochondrial proton conductance on body mass. Liver mitochondria from the larger frogs (L. catesbeiana) displayed 50\% of the proton conductance of mitochondria from the smaller frogs (R. temporaria). Contrary to our prediction, the low mitochondrial proton conductance measured in L. catesbeiana was not associated with higher reactive oxygen species production. Instead, liver mitochondria from the larger individuals produced significantly lower levels of radical oxygen species than those from the smaller frogs. Collectively, the data show that key bioenergetics parameters of mitochondria (proton leak, ATP production efficiency and radical oxygen species production) are correlated with body mass in frogs. This research expands our understanding of the relationship between mitochondrial function and the evolution of allometric scaling in ectotherms.",2015,10.1242/jeb.126086,218,20,3222-3228,NA,Allometry; Bioenergetics; Mitochondrial efficiency; Free radicals; Proton leak
article,Morphology and burrowing energetics of semi-fossorial skinks (<i>Liopholis</i> spp.),"Wu, Nicholas C. and Alton, Lesley A. and Clemente, Christofer J. and Kearney, Michael R. and White, Craig R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Burrowing is an important form of locomotion in reptiles, but no study has examined the energetic cost of burrowing for reptiles. This is significant because burrowing is the most energetically expensive mode of locomotion undertaken by animals and many burrowing species therefore show specialisations for their subterranean lifestyle. We examined the effect of temperature and substrate characteristics (coarse sand or fine sand) on the net energetic cost of burrowing (NCOB) and burrowing rate in two species of the Egernia group of skinks (Liopholis striata and Liopholis inornata) compared with other burrowing animals. We further tested for morphological specialisations among burrowing species by comparing the relationship between body shape and retreat preference in Egernia group skinks. For L. striata and L. inornata, NCOB is 350 times more expensive than the predicted cost of pedestrian terrestrial locomotion. Temperature had a positive effect on burrowing rate for both species, and a negative effect on NCOB for L. striata but not L. inornata. Both NCOB and burrowing rate were independent of substrate type. Burrows constructed by skinks had a smaller cross-sectional area than those constructed by mammals of comparable mass, and NCOB of skinks was lower than that of mammals of similar mass. After accounting for body size, retreat preference was significantly correlated with body shape in Egernia group skinks. Species of Egernia group skinks that use burrows for retreats have narrower bodies and shorter front limbs than other species. We conclude that the morphological specialisations of burrowing skinks allow them to construct relatively narrow burrows, thereby reducing NCOB and the total cost of constructing their burrow retreats.",2015,10.1242/jeb.113803,218,15,2416-2426,NA,Egernia; Cost of burrowing; Morphometrics; Locomotion energetics; Metabolic rate
article,A genetic reduction in antioxidant function causes elevated aggression in mice,"Garratt, Michael and Brooks, Robert C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Male-male aggression can have a large influence on access to mates, particularly in highly territorial animals such as mice. It has been suggested that males with impaired antioxidant defence and a consequential increased susceptibility to oxidative stress may have a reduced ability to invest in aggressive behaviours, which could limit their mating opportunities and reproductive success. Oxidative stress occurs as a result of an uncontrolled over-production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in relation to defence mechanisms (such as antioxidants), and can cause damage to a variety of different cellular components. Impairments in specific aspects of antioxidant defence, leading to oxidative stress, can limit investment in some reproductive traits in males, such as sperm quality and the production of sexual signals to attract mates. However, a direct effect of impaired antioxidant defence on aggressive behaviour has not, to our knowledge, been reported. In this study, we demonstrate that mice with experimentally elevated sensitivity to oxidative stress (through inhibition of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase, Sod1) actually show the opposite response to previous predictions. Males completely deficient in SOD1 are more aggressive than both wild-type males and males that express 50\% of this antioxidant enzyme. They are also faster to attack another male. The cause of this increased aggression is unknown, but this result highlights that aggressive behaviour in mice is not highly constrained by inhibited Sod1 expression, in contrast to other reproductive traits known to be impaired in this mouse model.",2015,10.1242/jeb.112011,218,2,223-227,NA,Life history; Fitness; Dominance; Mouse

R. and McClelland, Grant B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Fuel selection patterns during exercise are thought to be conserved among sea-level native mammals when intensity is expressed relative to maximum aerobic capacity ((V) over dotO(2, max)). However, this claim is based on data from only a few species larger than rats, and has never been tested statistically. Thus, we investigated fuel use in a small mammal (Mus musculus, CD-1 strain), and combined these data with published data on rats, dogs, goats and humans to evaluate the robustness of the mammalian fuel selection model. We found that mice rely less on carbohydrates to power moderate intensity exercise at the same \% (V) over dotO(2, max), max than larger mammals. We suggest that this difference is due to a decline in aerobic scope (O-2 available for exercise above resting metabolism) as body size decreases. We propose a redefined fuel use model that reflects changes in fractional aerobic scope with body size. Our results indicate that exercise defined as percent aerobic scope is a better predictor of fuel use across a wide range of quadruped species from mice to dogs and running humans.",2014,10.1242/jeb.099432,217,18,3193-3196,NA,Aerobic scope; Exercise; Carbohydrates; Respirometry; Aerobic capacity; Fuel use; Mammals
article,"Circadian rhythms are not involved in the regulation of circannual reproductive cycles in a sub-tropical bird, the spotted munia","Budki, Puja and Malik, Shalie and Rani, Sangeeta and Kumar, Vinod",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Circannual rhythms regulate seasonal reproduction in many vertebrates. The present study investigated whether circannual reproductive phenotypes (rhythms in growth of gonads and molt) were generated independently of the circadian clocks in the subtropical non-photoperiodic spotted munia (Lonchura punctulata). Birds were subjected to light: dark (LD) cycles with identical light but varying dark hours, such that the period of LD cycle (T) equaled 16 h (T16; 12 h L: 4 h D), 21 h (T21; 12 h L: 9 h D), 24 h (T24; 12 h L: 12 h D) and 27 h (T27; 12 h L: 15 h D), or to continuous light (LL, 24 h L: 0 h D) at similar to 18 degrees C. During the similar to 21 month exposure, munia underwent at least two cycles of gonadal development and molt; changes in body mass were not rhythmic. This was similar to the occurrence of annual cycles in reproduction and molt observed in wild birds. A greater asynchrony between circannual cycles of gonad development and molt indicated their independent regulation. Females showed reproductive rhythms with similar circannual periods, whilst in males, circannual periods measured between peak gonadal size were longer in T21 and T24 than in T16 or T27. This suggested a sex-dependent timing of annual reproduction in the spotted munia. Also, food availability periods may not influence the circannual timing of reproduction, as shown by the results on the rhythm in gonadal growth and regression in munia under T-photocycles and LL that provided differential light (feeding) hours. Further, a short-term experiment revealed that activity-rest patterns in munia were synchronized with T-photocycles, but were arrhythmic under LL. We conclude that circadian rhythms are not involved in the timing of the annual reproductive cycle in the spotted munia.",2014,10.1242/jeb.100651,217,14,2569-2579,NA,Body mass; Circadian rhythm; Circannual rhythm; Gonad; Molt; Lonchura punctulata; T-photocycle

In mouse muscle, SCs are activated by nitric oxide (NO), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and the mechanically induced NO-HGF signaling cascade. Here, the SC population on fibers from the adult, ectothermic zebrafish and SC responsiveness to activating stimuli were assessed using the model system of isolated fibers cultured at 27 and 21 degrees C. SCs were identified by immunostaining for the HGF receptor, c-met, and activation was determined using bromodeoxyuridine uptake in culture or in vivo. In dose-response studies, SC activation was increased by treatment with the NO-donor drug isosorbide dinitrate (1 mmol l(-1)) or HGF (10 ng ml(-1)) to maximum activation at lower concentrations of both than in previous studies of mouse fibers. HGF-induced activation was blocked by anti-c-met antibody, and reduced by culture at 21 degrees C. The effect of cyclical stretch (3 h at 4 cycles per minute) increased activation and was blocked by nitric oxide synthase inhibition and reduced by culture at 21 degrees C. The number of c-met+ SCs per fiber increased rapidly (by 3 h) after stretching. The character of signaling in SC activation on zebrafish fibers, in particular temperature-dependent responses to HGF and stretch, gives new insights into the influence of ectothermy on regulation of muscle growth in teleosts and suggests the use of the single-fiber model system to explore the basis of fiber hyperplasia and the conservation of regulatory pathways between species.",2014,10.1242/jeb.102210,217,11,1910-1917,NA,Stem cells; Ectothermy; Proliferation; c-met; Hepatocyte growth factor

Trace amounts of acetylated triacylglycerols (acTAGs) have been reported in animals, but are not accumulated, likely because they have lower energy density than IcTAGs. Here we report that acTAGs comprise 36\% of the neutral lipid pool of overwintering prepupae of the goldenrod gall fly, Eurosta solidaginis, while only 17\% of the neutral lipid pool is made up of typical IcTAGs. These high concentrations of acTAGs, present only during winter, appear to be synthesized by E. solidaginis and are not found in other freeze-tolerant insects, nor in the plant host. The mixture of acTAGs found in E. solidaginis has a significantly lower melting point than equivalent IcTAGs, and thus remains liquid at temperatures at which E. solidaginis is frozen in the field, and depresses the melting point of aqueous solutions in a manner unusual for neutral lipids. We note that accumulation of acTAGs coincides with preparation for overwintering and the seasonal acquisition of freeze tolerance. This is the first observation of accumulation of acTAGs by an animal, and the first evidence of dynamic interconversion between acTAGs and IcTAGs during development and in response to stress.",2014,10.1242/jeb.099838,217,9,1580-1587,NA,Lipid; Triglyceride; Acetylated triacylglycerol; Eurosta solidaginis; Freeze tolerance

W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The cheetah is considered the fastest land animal, but studies on their skeletal muscle properties are scarce. Vastus lateralis biopsies, obtained from male and female cheetahs as well as humans, were analysed and compared for fibre type and size, and metabolism. Overall, cheetah muscle had predominantly type IIX fibres, which was confirmed by the myosin heavy chain isoform content (mean +/- s.d. type I: 17 +/- 8\%, type IIA: 21 +/- 6\%, type IIX: 62 +/- 12\%), whereas human muscle contained predominantly type I and IIA fibres (type I: 49 +/- 14\%, type IIA: 43 +/- 8\%, type IIX: 7 +/- 7\%).

To test the sensitivity of morphological and physiological traits to environmental variation in two developmental stages, we manipulated brood size at hatch in European starlings (Sturnus vulgans) and cross-fostered chicks between enlarged and reduced broods approaching fledging. We measured body size (mass, tarsus, wing length) and physiological state (aerobic capacity, oxidative status) at asymptotic mass on day 15, then cross-fostered chicks between `high' and `low' quality environments and assessed the same traits again on day 20, after 5 days of pre-fledging mass recession. Chicks in reduced broods were heavier at asymptotic mass and had lower reactive oxygen metabolites than enlarged broods, whereas structural size, aerobic capacity and antioxidant capacity were unaffected by experimental brood size. The observed canalization of structural and physiological traits during early development was maintained after cross-fostering, during late development. However, in contrast to early development, antioxidant capacity approaching fledging appeared sensitive to environmental conditions, as trajectories varied by cross-fostering treatment. Elevated reactive oxygen metabolites observed after early development in enlarged brood chicks were maintained after cross fostering, suggesting that canalized development in low-quality environments could produce oxidative costs that carry over between life stages, even when conditions improve. These data reveal trait specific relationships between environmental conditions and development, and highlight how natal environment effects may vary by developmental stage.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245974,226,14,NA,jeb245974,Development; Canalization; Physiology; Brood size; Cross-fostering; Oxidative status

Yet, the extent to which parasite load is related to intraspecific variation in performance traits within wild populations remains relatively unexplored. We used pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus) and their endoparasites as a model system to explore the effects of infection load on host aerobic metabolism and escape performance. Metabolic traits (standard and maximum metabolic rates, aerobic scope) and faststart escape responses following a simulated aerial attack by a predator (responsiveness, response latency and escape distance) were measured in fish from across a gradient of visible (i.e. trematodes causing black spot disease counted on fish surfaces) and non-visible (i.e. cestodes in fish abdominal cavity counted post-mortem) endoparasite infection. We found that a higher infection load of non-visible endoparasites was related to lower standard and maximum metabolic rates, but not aerobic scope in fish. Non-visible endoparasite infection load was also related to decreased responsiveness of the host to a simulated aerial attack. Visible endoparasites were not related to changes in metabolic traits or fast-start escape responses.

With this investigation, we evaluated mitochondrial sensitivity to ecologically relevant stressors. We focused on an iconic migrant, the North American monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), and examined the effects of two stressors: 7 days of food deprivation and infection by the protozoan parasite Optuyocystis elektroscirrha (known to reduce survival and flight performance). We measured whole-animal resting metabolic rate (RMR) and peak flight metabolic rate, and mitochondrial respiration of isolated mitochondria from the flight muscles. Food deprivation reduced mass-independent RMR and peak flight metabolic rate, whereas infection did not. Fed monarchs used mainly lipids in flight (respiratory quotient 0.73), but the respiratory quotient dropped in food-deprived individuals, possibly indicating switching to alternative energy sources, such as ketone bodies. Food deprivation decreased mitochondrial maximum oxygen consumption but not basal respiration, resulting in lower respiratory control ratio (RCR). Furthermore, food deprivation decreased mitochondrial complex III activity, but increased complex IV activity. Infection did not result in any changes in these mitochondrial variables. Mitochondrial maximum respiration rate correlated positively with mass-independent RMR and flight metabolic rate, suggesting a link between mitochondria and whole-animal performance. In conclusion, low food availability negatively affects mitochondrial function and flight performance. with potential implications for migration, fitness and population dynamics. Although previous studies have reported poor flight performance in infected monarchs, we found no differences in physiological performance, suggesting that reduced flight capacity may be due to structural differences or low energy stores.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244431,225,13,NA,jeb244431,Dietary restriction; Infection; Metabolic rate; Migration; Oxidative stress

Mitochondria have historically been considered the primary source of ROS; however, recent literature has highlighted the uncertainty in primary ROS production sites and it is unclear how variation in mitochondrial density influences ROS-induced damage and protein turnover. Fish skeletal muscle is composed of distinct, highly aerobic red muscle and anaerobic white muscle, offering an excellent model system in which to evaluate the relationship of tissue aerobic capacity and ROS-induced damage under baseline conditions. The present study used a suite of indices to better understand potential consequences of aerobic tissue capacity in red and white muscle of the pinfish, Lagodon rhomboides. Red muscle had a 7-fold greater mitochondrial volume density thanwhite muscle, andmore oxidative damage despite also having higher activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase. The dominant protein degradation system appears to be tissue dependent. Lysosomal degradation markers and autophagosome volume density were greater in white muscle, while ubiquitin expression and 20S proteasome activity were significantly greater in red muscle. However, ubiquitin ligase expression was significantly higher inwhite muscle. Redmuscle had a more than 2-fold greater rate of translation and total ATP turnover than white muscle, results that may be due in part to the higher mitochondrial density and the associated increase in oxidative damage. Together, these results support the concept that an elevated aerobic capacity is associated with greater oxidative damage and higher costs of protein turnover.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242462,224,19,NA,jeb242462,Oxidative stress; Protein turnover; Autophagy; Ubiquitin proteasome system

Egg maternal substances can have interacting effects, but experimental studies of the consequences of the combined variation in the egg concentration of such molecules are extremely rare, particularly as far as prenatal stages are concerned. We manipulated the yolk concentration of vitamin E and corticosterone, which are, respectively, the main antioxidant and the main glucocorticoid hormone in bird eggs, both independently and simultaneously, and we tested their separate and combined effects on growth and oxidative status in the liver and in the brain of yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) embryos. Egg supplementation of relatively large physiological doses of corticosterone depressed embryo growth (total body mass, tarsus length and liver mass), whereas administration of vitamin E in association with corticosterone restored normal growth. Vitamin E did not affect embryo growth when administered alone. We further analysed the independent and combined effects of vitamin E and corticosterone on liver and brain total antioxidant capacity, the concentration of reactive oxygen molecules and lipid peroxidation. Vitamin E significantly reduced liver total antioxidant capacity, while corticosterone depressed brain lipid peroxidation. Prenatal exposure to vitamin E and corticosterone appears to have antagonistic effects on body growth, although vitamin E is not limiting in yellow-legged gull eggs. In combination with the results of previous experiments on the same species applying smaller experimental doses or focusing on the postnatal rather than prenatal life stages, our findings indicate that the effects of a physiological increase in the egg concentration of these substances can be life stage and dose specific, implying that generalizing prenatal effects of egg compounds may not be feasible.",2019,10.1242/jeb.199265,222,10,NA,jeb199265,Antioxidant; Glucocorticoid hormone; Larus michahellis; Egg maternal substance; Embryo development

In doing so, hoverflies serve a vital role as alternative pollinators, and are suggested to be the most important pollinators after bees and bumblebees. Unless the flower hoverflies are feeding from is large, they do not readily share the space with other insects, but instead opt to leave if another insect approaches. We used high-speed videography followed by 3D reconstruction of flight trajectories to quantify how female Eristalis hoverflies respond to approaching bees, wasps and two different hoverfly species. We found that, in 94\% of the interactions, the occupant female left the flower when approached by another insect. We found that compared with spontaneous take-offs, the occupant hoverfly's escape response was performed at similar to 3 times higher speed (spontaneous take-off at 0.20.05 m s(-1) compared with 0.55 +/- 0.08 m s(-1) when approached by another Eristalis). The hoverflies tended to take off upward and forward, while taking the incomer's approach angle into account. Intriguingly, we found that, when approached by wasps, the occupant Eristalis took off at a higher speed and when the wasp was further away. This suggests that feeding hoverflies may be able to distinguish these predators, demanding impressive visual capabilities. Our results, including quantification of the visual information available before occupant take-off, provide important insight into how freely behaving hoverflies perform escape responses from competitors and predators (e.g. wasps) in the wild.",2018,10.1242/jeb.177162,221,10,NA,jeb177162,Retinal size; Approach; Foraging behavior; Looming stimuli; Motion vision; Target detection

Importantly, these steroid sulfates can be converted back to the parent compound by the enzyme steroid sulfatase (STS). We investigated when and where STS was present during embryonic development in the red-eared slider turtle, Trachemys scripta.

However, the actual causality between aminergic systems and phenotype (i.e. fecundity and aggressiveness) is largely unknown due to the pleiotropic functions of amines (e.g. age-dependent polyethism) and the scarcity of manipulation experiments. To clarify the causality among dominance ranks, amine levels and phenotypes, we examined the dynamics of the aminergic system during the ontogeny of dominance hierarchy in the queenless ant Diacamma sp., which undergoes rapid physiological differentiation based on dominance interactions. Brain dopamine levels differed between dominants and subordinates at day 7 after eclosion, although they did not differ at day 1, reflecting fecundity but not aggressiveness. Topical applications of dopamine to the subordinate workers induced oocyte growth but did not induce aggressiveness, suggesting the gonadotropic effect of dopamine. Additionally, dopamine receptor transcripts (dopr1 and dopr2) were elevated in the gaster fat body of dominant females, suggesting that the fat body is a potential target of neurohormonal dopamine. Based on this evidence, we suggest that brain dopamine levels are elevated in dominants as a result of hierarchy formation, and differences in dopamine levels cause the reproductive differentiation, probably via stimulation of the fat body.",2015,10.1242/jeb.118414,218,7,1091-1098,NA,Biogenic amine; Reproductive dominance; Primitively eusocial; Ponerine ant; Diacamma
article,Does reproduction protect against oxidative stress?,"Costantini, David and Casasole, Giulia and Eens, Marcel",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"A central principle of life-history theory is that parents trade investment in reproduction against that in body maintenance. One physiological cost thought to be important as a modulator of such trade-off is oxidative stress. Experimental support for this hypothesis has, however, proved to be contradictory. In this study, we manipulated the nestling rearing effort of captive canaries (Serinus canaria) soon after the hatching of their nestlings using a brood-size manipulation to test whether an increase in nestling rearing effort translates into an increase in oxidative damage, an increase in ceruloplasmin (which is upregulated in response to oxidative damage) and a decrease in thiol antioxidants. We also compared the blood oxidative stress level of reproducing birds with that of non-reproducing birds, a crucial aspect that most studies have invariably failed to include in tests of the oxidative cost of reproduction. Compared with non-breeding canaries and pre-manipulation values, plasma oxidative damage (reactive oxygen metabolites and protein carbonyls) decreased in breeding canaries irrespective of sex and brood size. In contrast, oxidative damage did not change in non-breeding birds over the experiment. Ceruloplasmin activity in plasma and both non-protein and protein thiols in red blood cells did not change throughout the experiment in both treatment groups. Our results suggest that reproduction may result in decreased rather than increased blood oxidative stress. Our results may explain some of the inconsistencies that have so far been reported in experimental tests of the oxidative cost of reproduction hypothesis.",2014,10.1242/jeb.114116,217,23,4237-4243,NA,Antioxidants; Life history; Oxidative damage; Parental care; Thiols; Vertebrates
article,High basal metabolic rate does not elevate oxidative stress during reproduction in laboratory mice,"Brzek, Pawel and Ksiazek, Aneta and Oldakowski, Lukasz and Konarzewski, Marek",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Increased oxidative stress (OS) has been suggested as a physiological cost of reproduction. However, previous studies reported ambiguous results, with some even showing a reduction of oxidative damage during reproduction. We tested whether the link between reproduction and OS is mediated by basal metabolic rate (BMR), which has been hypothesized to affect both the rate of radical oxygen species production and antioxidative capacity. We studied the effect of reproduction on OS in females of laboratory mice divergently selected for high (H-BMR) and low (L-BMR) BMR, previously shown to differ with respect to parental investment. Non-reproducing L-BMR females showed higher oxidative damage to lipids (quantified as the level of malondialdehyde in internal organ tissues) and DNA (quantified as the level of 8-oxodG in blood serum) than H-BMR females. Reproduction did not affect oxidative damage to lipids in either line; however, it reduced damage to DNA in L-BMR females. Reproduction increased catalase activity in liver (significantly stronger in L-BMR females) and decreased it in kidneys. We conclude that the effect of reproduction on OS depends on the initial variation in BMR and varies between studied internal organs and markers of OS.",2014,10.1242/jeb.100073,217,9,1504-1509,NA,Oxidative stress; Cost of reproduction; Basal metabolic rate; Lactation; Artificial selection

L. and Holness, L. and Radtke, A. and Lee, S. K. and Obenaus, A. and Garland, Jr., T.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Increased brain size, relative to body mass, is a primary characteristic distinguishing the mammalian lineage. This greater encephalization has come with increased behavioral complexity and, accordingly, it has been suggested that selection on behavioral traits has been a significant factor leading to the evolution of larger whole-brain mass. In addition, brains may evolve in a mosaic fashion, with functional components having some freedom to evolve independently from other components, irrespective of, or in addition to, changes in size of the whole brain. We tested whether long-term selective breeding for high voluntary wheel running in laboratory house mice results in changes in brain size, and whether those changes have occurred in a concerted or mosaic fashion. We measured wet and dry brain mass via dissections and brain volume with ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging of brains that distinguished the caudate-putamen, hippocampus, midbrain, cerebellum and forebrain. Adjusting for body mass as a covariate, mice from the four replicate high-runner (HR) lines had statistically larger non-cerebellar wet and dry brain masses than those from four non-selected control lines, with no differences in cerebellum wet or dry mass or volume. Moreover, the midbrain volume in HR mice was similar to 13\% larger (P<0.05), while volumes of the caudate-putamen, hippocampus, cerebellum and forebrain did not differ statistically between HR and control lines. We hypothesize that the enlarged midbrain of HR mice is related to altered neurophysiological function in their dopaminergic system. To our knowledge, this is the first example in which selection for a particular mammalian behavior has been shown to result in a change in size of a specific brain region.",2013,10.1242/jeb.076000,216,3,515-523,NA,activity; allometry; cerebellum; dopamine; exercise behavior; locomotion; motor control

The trade-offs between intensity and spectrum regarding masking behaviors are largely unknown, even for well-studied organisms. We used a custom LED illumination system to document the response of wild-type house mice (Mus musculus) to 1-h nocturnal exposure of all combinations of four intensity levels (0.01, 0.5, 5 and 50 lx) and three correlated color temperatures (CCT; 1750, 1950 and 3000 K). Higher intensities of light (50 lx) suppressed cage activity substantially, and consistently more for the higher CCT light (91\% for 3000 K, 53\% for 1750 K). At the lowest intensity (0.01 lx), mean activity was increased, with the greatest increases for the lowest CCT (12.3\% increase at 1750 K, 3\% increase at 3000 K). Multiple linear regression confirmed the influence of both CCT and intensity on changes in activity, with the scaled effect size of intensity 3.6 times greater than that of CCT. Activity suppression was significantly lower for male than for female mice. Assessment of light-evoked cFos expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus at 50 lx showed no significant difference between high and low CCT exposure. The significant differences by spectral composition illustrate a need to account for light spectrum in circadian studies of behavior, and confirm that spectral controls can mitigate some, but certainly not all, of the effects of light pollution on species in the wild.",2024,10.1242/jeb.247235,227,14,NA,jeb247235,Activity; Masking; Entrainment; Correlated color temperature; Spectral sensitivity; Mus musculus

article,Animal navigation: a noisy magnetic sense?,"Johnsen, Sonke and Lohmann, Kenneth J. and Warrant, Eric J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Diverse organisms use Earth's magnetic field as a cue in orientation and navigation. Nevertheless, eliciting magnetic orientation responses reliably, either in laboratory or natural settings, is often difficult. Many species appear to preferentially exploit non-magnetic cues if they are available, suggesting that the magnetic sense often serves as a redundant or backup' source of information. This raises an interesting paradox: Earth's magnetic field appears to be more pervasive and reliable than almost any other navigational cue. Why then do animals not rely almost exclusively on the geomagnetic field, while ignoring or downplaying other cues? Here, we explore a possible explanation: that the magnetic sense of animals is `noisy', in that the magnetic signal is small relative to thermal and receptor noise. Magnetic receptors are thus unable to instantaneously acquire magnetic information that is highly precise or accurate. We speculate that extensive time-averaging and/or other higher-order neural processing of magnetic information is required, rendering the magnetic sense inefficient relative to alternative cues that can be detected faster and with less effort. This interpretation is consistent with experimental results suggesting a long time course for magnetic compass and map responses in some animals. Despite possible limitations, magnetoreception may be maintained by natural selection because the geomagnetic field is sometimes the only source of directional and/or positional information available.",2020,10.1242/jeb.164921,223,18,NA,jeb164921,Magnetoreception; Orientation; Migration; Signal-to-noise
article,Hif-1α paralogs play a role in the hypoxic ventilatory response of larval and adult zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>),"Mandic, Milica and Tzaneva, Velislava and Careau, Vincent and Perry, Steve F.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Hypoxia-inducible factor (Hif) 1 alpha, an extensively studied transcription factor, is involved in the regulation of many biological processes in hypoxia including the hypoxic ventilatory response. In zebrafish, there are two paralogs of Hif-1 alpha (Hif-1A and Hif-1B), but little is known about the specific roles or potential sub-functionalization of the paralogs in response to hypoxia. Using knockout lines of Hif-1 alpha paralogs, we examined their involvement in the hypoxic ventilatory response, measured as ventilation frequency (f(V)) in larval and adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). In wild-type zebrafish, f(V )increased across developmental time (4, 7, 10 and 15 days post-fertilization, dpf) in response to hypoxia (55 mmHg). In contrast, the Hif-1B knockout fish did not exhibit an increase in hypoxic f(V) at 4 dpf. Similar to wild-type, as larvae of all knockout lines developed, the magnitude of f(V) increased but to a lesser degree than in the wild-type larvae, until 15 dpf at which point there was no difference among the genotypes. In adult zebrafish, only in Hif-1B knockout fish was there an attenuation in f(V) during sustained exposure to 30 mmHg for 1 h but there was no effect when fish were exposed for a shorter duration to progressive hypoxia. The mechanism of action of Hif-1 alpha, in part, may be through its downstream target, nitric oxide synthase, and its product, nitric oxide. Overall, the effect of each Hif-1 alpha paralog on the hypoxic ventilatory response of zebrafish varies over development and is dependent on the type of hypoxic stress.",2019,10.1242/jeb.195198,222,2,NA,jeb195198,Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha; Ventilation frequency; Hypoxia; Nitric oxide; Paralog; Gene duplication

However, intestinal absorption also differs among FAs, potentially biasing conclusions on functional differences and their subsequent implications. We tested dietary FA usage in a nocturnal insectivorous reptile and a nocturnal insectivorous mammal of similar size: the gecko Hemidactylus turcicus and the shrew Suncus etruscus. We compared the relative presence of 13C isotopes in breath and feces following ingestion of three isotopically enriched fatty acids: linoleic acid (a polyunsaturated FA), oleic acid (monounsaturated) and palmitic acid (saturated). Both species oxidized linoleic and oleic acids at much higher levels than palmitic acid. Egestion of palmitic acid in feces was much higher than that of linoleic and oleic acids. The major difference between geckos and shrews was that the latter digested fatty acids much faster, which was best explained by the difference in the metabolic rates of the species. Circadian differences were evident for gecko metabolic and FA oxidation rates, peaking at night; for shrews, peak oxidation was achieved faster at night but rates did not differ. Our study is among the first to integrate oxidation and absorption patterns, as well as metabolic rates and their rhythms, providing important insights into the utilization of different dietary FAs in different species.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245963,226,19,NA,jeb245963,Circadian rhythm; Diet; Fatty acid; Nutrient oxidation; Stable isotope; Unsaturation; Suncus etruscus; Hemidactylus turcicus

B. and Georges, Arthur and Sarre, Stephen D. and Noble, Daniel W. A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Vertebrate sex is typically determined genetically, but in many ectotherms sex can be determined by genes (genetic sex determination, TSD), or interactions between genes and temperature during development. TSD may involve GSD systems with either male or female heterogamety (XX/XY or ZZ/ZW) where temperature overrides chromosomal sex determination to cause a mismatch between genetic sex and phenotypic sex (sex reversal). In these temperature-sensitive lineages, phylogenetic investigations point to recurrent evolutionary shifts between genotypic and temperature-dependent sex determination. These evolutionary transitions in sex determination can occur rapidly if selection favours the reversed sex over the concordant phenotypic sex. To investigate the consequences of sex reversal on offspring phenotypes, we measured two energy-driven traits (metabolism and growth) and 6 month survival in two species of reptile with different patterns of temperature-induced sex reversal. females (female XX) develop male phenotypes (maleSR XX), while female sex reversal occurs in Pogona vitticeps when chromosomal males (male ZZ) develop female phenotypes (femaleSR ZZ). We show metabolism in maleSR XX was like that of male XY; that is, reflective of phenotypic sex and lower than genotypic sex. In contrast, for Pogona vitticeps, femaleSR ZZ metabolism was intermediate between male ZZ and female ZW metabolic rate. For both species, our data indicate that differences in metabolism become more apparent as individuals become larger. Our findings provide some evidence for an energetic advantage from sex reversal in both species but do not exclude energetic processes as a constraint on the distribution of sex reversal in nature.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245657,226,13,NA,jeb245657,Energetics; Sex determination; Sex reversal; Pogona vitticeps; Bassiana duperreyi

For a signal to be effective, the signaller must capture and retain the attention of the receiver. Signal efficacy is also dependent on the sensory limitations of the receiver. However, most signalling studies consider movement and colour separately, resulting in a partial understanding of the signal in question. We explored the structure and function of predator-prey signalling in the jumping spider-tephritid fly system, where the prey performs a wing waving display that deters an attack from the predator. Using a custom-built spider retinal tracker combined with visual modelling, as well as behavioural assays, we studied the effect of fly wing movement and colour on the jumping spider's visual system. We show that jumping spiders track their prey less effectively during wing display and this can be attributed to a series of fluctuations in chromatic and achromatic contrasts arising from the wing movements. These results suggest that displaying flies deter spider attacks by manipulating the movement biases of the spider's visual system.

C. and Castilho, Roger F. and Vercesi, Anibal E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The interaction between supraphysiological cytosolic Ca2+ levels and mitochondrial redox imbalance mediates the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). The MPT is involved in cell death, diseases and aging. This study compared the liver mitochondrial Ca2+ retention capacity and oxygen consumption in the long-lived red-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis carbonada) with those in the rat as a reference standard. Mitochondrial Ca2+ retention capacity, a quantitative measure of MPT sensitivity, was remarkably higher in tortoises than in rats. This difference was minimized in the presence of the MPT inhibitors ADP and cyclosporine A. However, the Ca2+ retention capacities of tortoise and rat liver mitochondria were similar when both MPT inhibitors were present simultaneously. NADH-linked phosphorylating respiration rates of tortoise liver mitochondria represented only 30\% of the maximal electron transport system capacity, indicating a limitation imposed by the phosphorylation system. These results suggested underlying differences in putative MPT structural components {[}e.g. ATP synthase, adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) and cyclophilin D] between tortoises and rats. Indeed, in tortoise mitochondria, titrations of inhibitors of the oxidative phosphorylation components revealed a higher limitation of ANT. Furthermore, cyclophilin D activity was approximately 70\% lower in tortoises than in rats. Investigation of critical properties of mitochondrial redox control that affect MPT demonstrated that tortoise and rat liver mitochondria exhibited similar rates of H2O2 release and glutathione redox status. Overall, our findings suggest that constraints imposed by ANT and cyclophilin D, putative components or regulators of the MPT pore, are associated with the enhanced resistance to Ca2+-induced MPT in tortoises.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243532,225,1,NA,jeb243532,Reptiles; Mitochondrial bioenergetics; Negligible senescence; Aging; Cyclophilin D; Adenine nucleotide translocator

The choice of omics approach will be guided by the availability of existing resources and the time scale of the process being studied.

These methods can bring analytical challenges, so we describe the most easily analyzed omics experimental designs. We address the propensity of omics studies to digress into `fishing expeditions' and show how omics can be used within the hypothetico-deductive framework.

The `membrane pacemaker' hypothesis of metabolism and of aging, respectively, suggest that increased lipid unsaturation and large amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in cell membranes increase the cellular metabolic rate as well as the vulnerability of the cell to oxidative damage, thus increasing organismal metabolic rate and decreasing longevity. Here, we tested these hypotheses by experimentally altering the membrane fatty acid composition of fibroblast cells derived from small and large breed dogs by incubating them in a medium enriched in the monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) oleic acid (OA, 18:1) to decrease the total saturation. We then measured cellular metabolic parameters and correlated these parameters with membrane fatty acid composition and oxidative stress. We found that cells from small dogs and OA-incubated cells had lower maximal oxygen consumption and basal oxygen consumption rates, respectively, which are traits associated with longer lifespans. Furthermore, although we did not find differences in oxidative stress, cells from small dogs and OA-treated cells exhibited reduced ATP coupling efficiency, suggesting that these cells are less prone to producing reactive oxygen species. Membrane fatty acid composition did not differ between cells from large and small dogs, but cells incubated with OA had more monounsaturated fatty acids and a higher number of double bonds overall despite a decrease in PUFAs. Our results suggest that increasing the monounsaturation of dog cell membranes may alter some metabolic parameters linked to increases in longevity.",2020,10.1242/jeb.221804,223,12,NA,jeb221804,Longevity; PUFA; MUFA; Membrane pacemaker; Primary fibroblasts
article,Functional morphology of endurance swimming performance and gait transition strategies in balistoid fishes,"George, Andrew B. and Westneat, Mark W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Triggerfishes and filefishes (Balistoidea) use balistiform locomotion to power steady swimming with their dorsal and anal fins, and transition to a gait dominated by body and caudal fin (BCF) kinematics at high speeds. Fin and body shapes are predicted to be strong determinants of swimming performance and gait transitions. The goal of this study was to combine morphometrics and critical swimming tests to explore the relationships between fin and body shapes and swimming performance in a phylogenetic context in order to understand the evolution of balistiform swimming. Among 13 species of balistoid fishes, those with high aspect ratio fins tended to achieve higher critical swimming speeds than fishes with low aspect ratio fins. Species with long, large median fins and wide caudal peduncles used the balistiform gait alone for a larger percentage of their total critical swimming speed than fishes with short, small median fins and narrow caudal peduncles. Although analyses revealed overall positive relationships between median fin aspect ratios and gait transition speeds, fishes on both ends of the aspect ratio spectrum achieved higher swimming speeds using the balistiform gait alone than fishes with median fins of intermediate aspect ratios. Each species is specialized for taking advantage of one gait, with balistiform specialists possessing long, large median fins capable of the large power requirements of high-speed swimming using the median fins alone, while BCF specialists possess short, small median fins, ill-suited for powering high-speed balistiform locomotion, but narrow caudal peduncles capable of efficient caudal fin oscillations to power high-speed locomotion.",2019,10.1242/jeb.194704,222,8,NA,jeb194704,Balistiform locomotion; Fins; Aspect ratio; U-crit; Body/caudal fin
article,Almost like a whale - first evidence of suction feeding in a seabird,"Enstipp, Manfred R. and Descamps, Sebastien and Fort, Jerome and Gremillet, David",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Little auks (Alle alle) are one of the most numerous seabird species in the world and feed primarily on copepods in arctic waters. Their high daily energy requirements leave them vulnerable to current changes in the arctic plankton community, where a smaller, less-profitable copepod species (Calanus finmarchicus) becomes increasingly abundant. Little auks have been estimated to require similar to 60,000 copepods per day, necessitating prey capture rates of similar to 6 copepods per second underwater. To achieve such performance, it has been suggested that little auks capture their prey by (non-visual) filter feeding. We tested this hypothesis by exposing little auks to varying copepod densities within a shallow experimental pool and filming their prey capture behaviour. At none of the copepod densities tested did birds filter feed. Instead, all birds captured copepods by what we identified as visually guided suction feeding, achieved through an extension of their sub-lingual pouch. Suction feeding is very common in fish and marine mammals, but to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that it has been specifically identified in a seabird species. While presumably less efficient than filter feeding, this behaviour may allow little auks to foster higher resilience when facing the consequences of arctic climate change.",2018,10.1242/jeb.182170,221,13,NA,NA,Foraging; Little auks; Copepods; Diving; Climate change; Feeding mechanism

In order to test the hypothesis of an adaptive role for plasticity in invasions, particular attention should be paid to the relationship between the focal plastic trait, the environmental stimulus and the functional importance of the trait. The Drosophila wing is particularly amenable to experimental studies of phenotypic plasticity. Wing morphology is known for its plastic variation under different experimental temperatures, but this plasticity has rarely been investigated in a functional context of flight. Here, we investigate the effect of temperature on wing morphology and flight in the invasive pest species Drosophila suzukii. Although the rapid invasion of both Europe and North America was most likely facilitated by human activities, D. suzukii is also expected to disperse actively. By quantifying wing morphology and individual flight trajectories of flies raised under different temperatures, we tested whether (1) invasive populations of D. suzukii show higher phenotypic plasticity than their native counterparts, and (2) wing plasticity affects flight parameters. Developmental temperature was found to affect both wing morphology and flight parameters (in particular speed and acceleration), leaving open the possibility of an adaptive value for wing plasticity.

In the early phase of the training (1 wk-t), angiogenesis {[}32\% higher capillary/fiber (C/F) ratio; P<0.05] in PLNT muscle was accompanied by a tendency for capillary lumen enlargement (30\%; P=0.06) and a reduction of the pericapillary basement membrane thickness {[}(CBMT) 12.7\%; P=0.09] as well as a 21\% shortening of intraluminal protrusion length (P<0.05), all compared with controls.

article,Oxidative stress affects sperm performance and ejaculate redox status in subordinate house sparrows,"Mora, Alfonso Rojas and Firth, Alexandra and Blareau, Sophie and Vallat, Armelle and Helfenstein, Fabrice",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Oxidative stress is the result of random cellular damage caused by reactive oxygen species that leads to cell death, ageing or illness. Most physiological processes can result in oxidative stress, which in turn has been identified as a major cause of infertility. In promiscuous species, the fertilizing ability of the ejaculate partly determines the male reproductive success. When dominance determines access to fertile females, theory predicts that lower ranking males should increase resource investment into enhancing ejaculate quality. We hypothesized that subordinate males should thus prioritize antioxidant protection of their ejaculates to protect them from oxidative stress. We put this hypothesis to the test by chronically dosing wild house sparrows with diquat (similar to 1 mg kg(-1)), a herbicide that increases pro-oxidant generation. We found that, although they increased their antioxidant levels in the ejaculate, diquat-treated males produced sperm with reduced velocity. Importantly, and contrary to our hypothesis, males at the bottom of the hierarchy suffered the largest reduction in sperm velocity. We suggest that resource access hinders individuals' ability to cope with environmental hazards. Our results point at oxidative stress as a likely physiological mechanism mediating ejaculate quality, while individual ability to access resources may play a role in constraining the extent to which such resources can be allocated into the ejaculate.",2017,10.1242/jeb.154799,220,14,2577-2588,NA,Social dominance; Soma/germline trade-off; Sperm competition; Sperm velocity; Pollutants
article,The cues of colony size: how honey bees sense that their colony is large enough to begin to invest in reproduction,"Smith, Michael L. and Koenig, Phoebe A. and Peters, Jacob M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"As organisms develop, they first invest resources in survival and growth, but after reaching a certain condition they start to also invest in reproduction. Likewise, superorganisms, such as honey bee colonies, first invest in survival and growth, and later commit resources to reproduction once the number of workers in the colony surpasses a reproductive threshold. The first form of reproductive investment for a honey bee colony is the building of beeswax comb made of special large cells used for rearing males (drones). How do the workers sense that their colony is large enough to start building this `drone comb'? To address this question, we experimentally increased three possible cues of colony size - worker density, volatile pheromone concentration and nest temperature - and looked for effects on the bees' comb construction. Only the colonies that experienced increased worker density were stimulated to build a higher proportion of drone comb. We then monitored and quantified potential cues in small and large colonies, to determine which cues change with colony size. We found that workers in large colonies, relative to small ones, have increased contact rates, spend more time active and experience less variable worker density. Whereas unicellular and multicellular organisms use mainly chemical cues to sense their sizes, our results suggest that at least one superorganism, a honey bee colony, uses physical cues to sense its size and thus its developmental state.",2017,10.1242/jeb.150342,220,9,1597-1605,NA,Superorganism; Development; Sociogenesis; Reproductive investment; Apis mellifera; Drone comb
article,A Chinese alligator in heliox: formant frequencies in a crocodilian,"Reber, Stephan A. and Nishimura, Takeshi and Janisch, Judith and Robertson, Mark and Fitch, W. Tecumseh",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Crocodilians are among the most vocal non-avian reptiles. Adults of both sexes produce loud vocalizations known as `bellows' year round, with the highest rate during the mating season. Although the specific function of these vocalizations remains unclear, they may advertise the caller's body size, because relative size differences strongly affect courtship and territorial behaviour in crocodilians. In mammals and birds, a common mechanism for producing honest acoustic signals of body size is via formant frequencies (vocal tract resonances). To our knowledge, formants have to date never been documented in any non-avian reptile, and formants do not seem to play a role in the vocalizations of anurans. We tested for formants in crocodilian vocalizations by using playbacks to induce a female Chinese alligator (Alligator sinensis) to bellow in an airtight chamber. During vocalizations, the animal inhaled either normal air or a helium/oxygen mixture (heliox) in which the velocity of sound is increased. Although heliox allows normal respiration, it alters the formant distribution of the sound spectrum. An acoustic analysis of the calls showed that the source signal components remained constant under both conditions, but an upward shift of high-energy frequency bands was observed in heliox. We conclude that these frequency bands represent formants. We suggest that crocodilian vocalizations could thus provide an acoustic indication of body size via formants. Because birds and crocodilians share a common ancestor with all dinosaurs, a better understanding of their vocal production systems may also provide insight into the communication of extinct Archosaurians.",2015,10.1242/jeb.119552,218,15,2442-2447,NA,Bioacoustics; Source-filter theory; Alligator sinensis; Vocal tract resonance; Bellow; Archosauria
article,Physiological adaptations to reproduction. II. Mitochondrial adjustments in livers of lactating mice,"Pichaud, Nicolas and Garratt, Michael and Ballard, J. William O. and Brooks, Robert C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Reproduction imposes significant costs and is characterized by an increased energy demand. As a consequence, individuals adjust their cellular structure and function in response to this physiological constraint. Because mitochondria are central to energy production, changes in their functional properties are likely to occur during reproduction. Such changes could cause adjustments in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and consequently in oxidative stress levels. In this study, we investigated several mechanisms involved in energy production, including mitochondrial respiration at different steps of the electron transport system (ETS) and related the results to citrate synthase activity in the liver of non-reproductive and reproductive (two and eight pups) female house mice at peak lactation. Whereas we did not find differences between females having different litter sizes, liver mitochondria of reproductive females showed lower ETS activity and an increase in mitochondrial density when compared with the non-reproductive females. Although it is possible that these changes were due to combined processes involved in reproduction and not to the relative investment in lactation, we propose that the mitochondrial adjustment in liver might help to spare substrates and therefore energy for milk production in the mammary gland. Moreover, our results suggest that these changes lead to an increase in ROS production that subsequently upregulates antioxidant defence activity and decreases oxidative stress.",2013,10.1242/jeb.082685,216,15,2889-2895,NA,reproduction; metabolism; mitochondrial respiration; liver; citrate synthase

Apart from finding favourable foraging sites, they have to develop effective prey search patterns and physiological capacities that enable them to capture sufficient prey to meet their energetic needs. Animals that dive to forage, such as king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus), need to acquire an adequate breathhold capacity, allowing them to locate and capture prey at depth. To investigate the ontogeny of their dive capacity and foraging performance, we implanted juvenile king penguins before their first departure to sea and also adult breeders with a data-logger recording pressure and temperature. We found that juvenile king penguins possess a remarkable dive capacity when leaving their natal colony, enabling them to conduct dives in excess of 100 m within their first week at sea. Despite this, juvenile dive/foraging performance, investigated in relation to dive depth, remained below the adult level throughout their first year at sea, probably reflecting physiological limitations as a result of incomplete maturation. A significantly shallower foraging depth of juveniles, particularly during their first 5 months at sea, could also indicate differences in foraging strategy and targeted prey. The initially greater wiggle rate suggests that juveniles fed opportunistically and also targeted different prey from adults and/or that many of the wiggles of juveniles reflect unsuccessful prey-capture attempts, indicating a lower foraging proficiency. After 5 months, this difference disappeared, suggesting sufficient physical maturation and improvement of juvenile foraging skills.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242512,224,12,NA,jeb242512,Ontogeny; Foraging proficiency; Wiggles; Seabirds; Bio-logging; Diving
article,Establishment of correctly focused eyes may not require visual input in arthropods,"Owens, Madeline and Giordullo, Isaiah and Buschbeck, Elke K.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"For proper function, vertebrate and invertebrate visual systems must be able to achieve and maintain emmetropia, a state where distant objects are in focus on the retina. In vertebrates, this is accomplished through a combination of genetic control during early development and homeostatic visual input that fine-tunes the optics of the eye. While emmetropization has long been researched in vertebrates, it is largely unknown how emmetropia is established in arthropods. We used a micro-ophthalmoscope to directly measure how the lens projects images onto the retina in the eyes of small, live arthropods, allowing us to compare the refractive states of light-reared and dark-reared arthropods. First, we measured the image-forming larval eyes of diving beetles (Thermonectus marmoratus), which are known to grow rapidly and dramatically between larval instars. Then, we measured the image-forming principal anterior-median eyes of jumping spiders (Phidippus audax) after emergence from their egg cases. Finally, we measured individual ommatidia in the compound eyes of flesh flies (Sarcophaga bullata) that had developed and emerged under either light or dark conditions. Surprisingly, and in sharp contrast to vertebrates, our data for this diverse set of arthropods suggest that visual input is inconsequential in regard to achieving well-focused eyes. Although it remains unclear whether visual input that is received after the initial development further improves focusing, these results suggest that at least the initial coordination between the lens refractive power and eye size in arthropods may be more strongly predetermined by developmental factors than is typically the case in vertebrates.",2020,10.1242/jeb.216192,223,1,NA,jeb216192,Refractive error; Eye development; Invertebrate vision; Optics; Emmetropization

We outline a protocol that aligns this technology with the broader literature on aerial respirometry, including the calculations required to accurately convert O-2 depletion to metabolic rate (MR). We identify a series of assumptions, and sources of error associated with this technique, including thresholds where O-2 depletion becomes limiting, that impart errors to the calculation and interpretation of MR. Using these adjusted calculations, we found that the resting MR of five species of angiosperm seeds ranged from 0.011 to 0.640 ml g(-1) h(-1), consistent with published seed MR values.

article,A species-specific nematocide that results in terminal embryogenesis,"Renahan, Tess and Hong, Ray L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Nematode-insect interactions are ubiquitous, complex and constantly changing as the host and nematode coevolve. The entomophilic nematode Pristionchus pacificus is found on a myriad beetle species worldwide, although the molecular dynamics of this relationship are largely unknown. To better understand how host cues affect P. pacificus embryogenesis, we characterized the threshold of sensitivity to the pheromone (Z)-7-tetradecen-2-one (ZTDO) by determining the minimum exposure duration and developmental window that results in P. pacificus embryonic lethality. We found early-stage embryos exposed to volatile ZTDO for as few as 4 h all display terminal embryogenesis, characterized by punctuated development up to 48 h later, with abnormal morphology and limited cavity formation. To determine if the pheromone arrests pre-hatching development by suffocating or permeabilizing the eggshells, we raised embryos under anoxic conditions and also examined eggshell permeability using the lipophilic dye FM4-64. We found that asphyxiating the embryos arrested embryogenesis in a reversible manner but did not phenocopy the effects of ZTDO exposure, whereas the ZTDO-induced disruption of embryogenesis did correlate with increased eggshell permeability. The effects of ZTDO are also highly specific, as other lipid insect compounds do not produce any detectable embryocidal effect. The high specificity and unusual teratogenic effect of ZTDO may be important in mediating the host-nematode relationship by regulating P. pacificus development.",2017,10.1242/jeb.159665,220,18,3238-3247,NA,Nematode; Pristionchus pacificus; Eggshell; Pheromone; Embryogenesis
article,Glycolysis plays an important role in energy transfer from the base to the distal end of the flagellum in mouse sperm,"Takei, Gen L. and Miyashiro, Daisuke and Mukai, Chinatsu and Okuno, Makoto",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Many studies have been conducted to elucidate the relationship between energy metabolic pathways (glycolysis and respiration) and flagellar motility in mammalian sperm, but the contribution of glycolysis to sperm motility has not yet been fully elucidated. In the present study, we performed detailed analysis of mouse sperm flagellar motility for further understanding of the contribution of glycolysis to mammalian sperm motility. Mouse sperm maintained vigorous motility in the presence of substrates either for glycolysis or for respiration. By contrast, inhibition of glycolysis by alpha-chlorohydrine caused a significant decrease in the bend angle of the flagellar bending wave, sliding velocity of outer doublet microtubules and ATP content even in the presence of respiratory substrates (pyruvate or beta-hydroxybutyrate). The decrease of flagellar bend angle and sliding velocity are prominent in the distal part of the flagellum, indicating that glycolysis inhibition caused the decrease in ATP concentration threrein. These results suggest that glycolysis potentially acts as a spatial ATP buffering system, transferring energy (ATP) synthesized by respiration at the mitochondria located in the basal part of the flagellum to the distal part. In order to validate that glycolytic enzymes can transfer high energy phosphoryis, we calculated intraflagellar concentration profiles of adenine nucleotides along the flagellum by computer simulation analysis. The result demonstrated the involvement of glycolysis for maintaining the ATP concentration at the tip of the flagellum. It is likely that glycolysis plays a key role in energy homeostasis in mouse sperm not only through ATP production but also through energy transfer.",2014,10.1242/jeb.090985,217,11,1876-1886,NA,Mammalian sperm; Motility; Glycolysis; Energy transport; Metabolism; Flagellar bending
article,Is gastrointestinal plasticity in king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) elicited by diet-fibre or diet-energy dilution?,"Williamson, Sean A. and Jones, Stephanie K. Courtney and Munn, Adam J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Phenotypic plasticity of organ size allows some animals to manage fluctuations of resource quality or availability. Here, we examined the phenotypic plasticity of the gastrointestinal tract of king quail (Coturnix chinensis) in a diet-fibre manipulation study. Quail were offered either a control low-fibre (high-quality) food (8.5\% neutral-detergent fibre; NDF), or one of two experimental diets of higher fibre contents of 16\% NDF (i.e. low-quality food). To examine whether phenotypic plasticity of organ size was associated with the fibre content per se, or as a consequence of diluting the diet energy contents by adding fibre, one of the high-fibre feeds was `balanced' with additional energy to match that of the low-fibre control diet. Total empty dry mass of the gastrointestinal tract was significantly heavier among birds offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet as compared with those offered the control diet, with birds offered the fibrous but energy-balanced diet having guts of intermediate size. The heavier entire-gut mass (dry) of quail offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet was associated mainly with these birds having significantly heavier gizzards. Notably, the larger gizzard in the birds offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet was associated with marked increases in their metabolisability (digestion) of diet fibre. Our findings suggest that the available energy in the diet may be more important for eliciting phenotypic changes in the gut of these herbivorous birds rather than simple physical effects of diet fibre on feed intakes or on muscular compensation to fibrous ingesta.",2014,10.1242/jeb.102418,217,11,1839-1842,NA,Quail; Coturnix chinensis; Phenotypic plasticity; Dietary fibre; Energy dilution; Digestive physiology; Gastrointestinal tract; Gastroliths; Gizzard

To test whether the swimming performance of fish with different swimming capacities would be differentially affected due to caudal fin loss and regeneration, we investigated the critical swimming speed (U-crit), swimming metabolic rate ((M) over dot(O2)), tail beat frequency (f(TB)) and tail beat amplitude (A(TB)) after caudal fin loss and regeneration (20 days) in juveniles of three cyprinid fish species: the qingbo (Spinibarbus sinensis; strong swimmer), the common carp (Cyprinus carpio; intermediate swimmer) and the goldfish (Carassius auratus; poor swimmer). The Ucrit values of the caudal-fin-lost qingbo, common carp and goldfish were 49, 32 and 35\% significantly lower than those of the control groups, respectively. The maximum tail beat amplitude (A(TBmax)) (all three fishes), the maximum tail beat frequency (f(TBmax)) (only the common carp and the goldfish) and/or the active metabolic rate ((M) over dot(O2active)) (only the common carp) of the caudal-fin-lost fish were significantly higher than those of the control groups. After 20 days of recovery, the caudal fins recovered to 41, 47 and 24\% of those of the control groups for the qingbo, the common carp and the goldfish, respectively. However, the U-crit values of the fin-regenerated qingbo, common carp and goldfish recovered to 86, 91 and 95\% of those of the control group, respectively. The caudal-fin-regenerated qingbo and common carp showed a significantly higher A(TBmax) and f(TBmax), respectively, compared with those of the control groups. The qingbo had a higher f(TBmax) but a lower A(TBmax) than the common carp and the goldfish, which suggested that a strong swimmer may maintain swimming speed primarily by maintaining a greater f(TBmax), for which the caudal fin plays a more important role during swimming, than a poor swimmer. The (M) over dot(O2active) of fish (common carp) with a redundant respiratory capacity could increase due to caudal fin loss to meet the increase in energy expenditure required by an increase in f(TBmax). In addition, the sustained swimming performance may not be the only selective pressure acting on caudal fin size in these three species, and the present caudal fin size may be a trade-off between sustain swimming performance and other factors (e.g. sexual selection, escape responses).",2013,10.1242/jeb.084244,216,16,3164-3174,NA,behaviour; compensation; critical swimming speed; metabolic rate; morphology; tail beat frequency
article,The influence of plant odours on sexual readiness in an insectivorous songbird,"Caro, Samuel P. and Delaitre, Segolene and Buatois, Bruno and Bonadonna, Francesco and Graham, Jessica L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Many organisms rely on environmental cues to predict and anticipate the annual optimal timing of reproduction. In insectivorous birds, preparation for breeding often coincides with the time vegetation starts to develop in spring. Whether there is a direct relationship between the two, and through which mechanisms this link could come about, has rarely been investigated. Plants release herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) when they are attacked by insects, and recent studies have shown that birds can detect and orient to those odours when searching for food. Whether those volatiles also stimulate sexual reproductive development and timing of reproduction remains to be discovered. We tested this hypothesis by monitoring gonadal growth in pairs of blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) exposed to air from caterpillar-infested oak trees or from a control, in spring. We found that while males and females grew their gonads over time, gonads grew at the same rate in both odour treatments. More exploratory (i.e. a proxy of personality) females did, however, have larger ovarian follicle sizes when exposed to the HIPVs than to the control air, which is consistent with earlier results showing that fast explorers have larger gonads in spring and are more sensitive to HIPVs. If HIPVs constitute powerful attractants in foraging birds, their influence on gonadal development prior to breeding appears to be relatively subtle and to only enhance reproductive readiness in some individuals. These results are nevertheless important as they set olfaction as a new player in the seasonal timing of reproduction in birds.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245313,226,6,NA,jeb245313,Olfaction; Herbivore-induced plant volatiles; Seasonal timing; Reproduction; Gonadal cycles; Birds

Neither a detailed analysis of the electrocardiogram nor the structure of the heart indicated a specialized cardiac conduction system. Using a suitable perfusion system, we discovered that, despite its immunity in vivo, the explanted heart of electric catfish can readily be activated by external electrical currents and is equally sensitive to electric shock-induced arrhythmias as similar-sized goldfish hearts.

Here, we propose that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from unconventional model organisms may retain certain species-specific features that can consequently be investigated in depth in vitro; we use hibernating mammals as an example. Many species (including ground squirrels, bats and bears) can enter a prolonged state of physiological dormancy known as hibernation to survive unfavorable seasonal conditions. Our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the rapid transition and adaptation to a hypothermic, metabolically suppressed winter torpor state remains limited partially because of the lack of an easily accessible model. To address the fascinating unanswered questions underlying hibernation biology, we have developed a powerful model system: iPSCs from a hibernating species, the thirteen-lined ground squirrel (lctidomys tridecemlineatus). These stem cells can potentially be differentiated into any cell type, and can be used for the analysis of cell-autonomous mechanisms that facilitate adaptation to hibernation and for comparisons with non-hibernators. Furthermore, we can manipulate candidate molecular and cellular pathways underlying relevant physiological phenomena by pharmacological or RNA-ibased methods, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Moreover, iPSC strategies can be applied to other species (e.g. seals, naked mole rats, humming birds) for in vitro studies on adaptation to extreme physiological conditions.

article,Physiological effects of increased foraging effort in a small passerine,"Yap, Kang Nian and Kim, Oh Run and Harris, Karilyn C. and Williams, Tony D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Foraging to obtain food, either for self-maintenance or at presumably elevated rates to provide for offspring, is thought to be an energetically demanding activity but one that is essential for fitness (higher reproductive success and survival). Nevertheless, the physiological mechanisms that allow some individuals to support higher foraging performance, and the mechanisms underlying costs of high workload, remain poorly understood. We experimentally manipulated foraging behaviour in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) using the technique described by Koetsier and Verhulst (2011). Birds in the `high foraging effort' (HF) group had to obtain food either while flying/hovering or by making repeated hops or jumps from the ground up to the feeder, behaviour typical of the extremely energetically expensive foraging mode observed in many free-living small passerines. HF birds made significantly more trips to the feeder per 10 min, whereas control birds spent more time (perched) at the feeder. Despite this marked change in foraging behaviour, we documented few short- or long-term effects of `training' (3 days and 90 days of `training', respectively) and some of these effects were sex specific. There were no effects of treatment on basal metabolic rate, haematocrit, haemoglobin or plasma glycerol, triglyceride and glucose levels, and masses of kidney, crop, large intestine, small intestine, gizzard and liver. HF females had higher masses of flight muscle, leg muscle, heart and lung compared with controls. In contrast, HF males had lower heart mass than controls and there were no differences for other organs. When both sexes were pooled, there were no effects of treatment on body composition. Finally, birds in the HF treatment group had higher levels of reactive oxygen metabolites (dROMs) and, consequently, although treatment did not affect total anti-oxidant capacity, birds in the HF treatment group had higher oxidative stress.",2017,10.1242/jeb.160812,220,22,4282-4291,NA,Exercise physiology; Workload; Oxidative stress; Energetics; Body composition; Taeniopygia guttata
article,Kinematics of ram filter feeding and beat-glide swimming in the northern anchovy <i>Engraulis mordax</i>,"Carey, Nicholas and Goldbogen, Jeremy A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In the dense aquatic environment, the most adept swimmers are streamlined to reduce drag and increase the efficiency of locomotion. However, because they open their mouth to wide gape angles to deploy their filtering apparatus, ram filter feeders apparently switch between diametrically opposite swimming modes: highly efficient, streamlined `beat-glide' swimming, and ram filter feeding, which has been hypothesized to be a high-cost feeding mode because of presumed increased drag. Ram filter-feeding forage fish are thought to play an important role in the flux of nutrients and energy in upwelling ecosystems; however, the biomechanics and energetics of this feeding mechanism remain poorly understood. We quantified the kinematics of an iconic forage fish, the northern anchovy, Engraulis mordax, during ram filter feeding and non-feeding, mouth-closed beat-glide swimming. Although many kinematic parameters between the two swimming modes were similar, we found that swimming speeds and tailbeat frequencies were significantly lower during ram feeding. Rather than maintain speed with the school, a speed which closely matches theoretical optimum filter-feeding speeds was consistently observed. Beat-glide swimming was characterized by high variability in all kinematic parameters, but variance in kinematic parameters was much lower during ram filter feeding. Under this mode, body kinematics are substantially modified, and E. mordax swims more slowly and with decreased lateral movement along the entire body, but most noticeably in the anterior. Our results suggest that hydrodynamic effects that come with deployment of the filtering anatomy may limit behavioral options during foraging and result in slower swimming speeds during ram filtration.",2017,10.1242/jeb.158337,220,15,2717-2725,NA,Swimming kinematics; Ram filter feeding; Forage fish; Anchovy

We evaluated some features of the clotting cascade of black bears, providing novel insights into the underlying mechanisms they evoke for embolic protection during hibernation. We measured activated clotting time, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time during early denning (December), late denning (March) and summer (August). Activated clotting time during early hibernation was similar to 3 times longer than that observed among non-hibernating animals. Clotting time was reduced later in hibernation, when bears were within similar to 1 month of emerging from dens. Prothrombin time was similar for each seasonal time point, whereas activated partial thromboplastin time was highest during early denning and decreased during late denning and summer. We also examined D-dimer concentration to assess whether the bears were likely to have experienced embolic events. None of the nonparturient bears exceeded a D-dimer concentration of 250 ng ml(-1) (considered the clinical threshold for embolism in mammals). Our findings suggest there is unique expression of the clotting cascade in American black bears during hibernation, in which extrinsic pathways are maintained but intrinsic pathways are suppressed. This was evaluated by a significant difference between the activated clotting time and activated partial thromboplastin time during the denning and non-denning periods. These changes are likely adaptive, to avoid clotting events during states of immobilization and/or periods of asystole.

We investigated the effect of foraging distance on individual German cockroaches by providing two foods differing in protein-to-carbohydrate ratio at opposite ends of long containers or adjacent to each other in short containers. Each food was nutritionally imbalanced, but the two foods were nutritionally complementary, allowing optimal foraging by selective feeding from both foods. We measured nutrient-specific consumption in fifth instar nymphs and newly eclosed females foraging at the two distances, hypothesizing that individuals foraging over longer distance would select more carbohydrate-biased diets to compensate for the energetic cost of locomotion. We then determined dry mass growth and lipid accumulation in the nymphs as well as mass gain and the length of basal oocytes in the adult females as an estimate of sexual maturation. Nymphs foraging over longer distance accumulated less lipid relative to total dry mass growth, but contrary to our predictions, their protein intake was higher and they accumulated more structural mass. In concordance, adult females foraging over longer distance gained more body mass and matured their oocytes faster. Our results show a positive effect of foraging distance on fitness-related parameters at two life stages, in both cases involving increased consumption of specific nutrients corresponding to requirements at the respective life stage.",2017,10.1242/jeb.146829,220,2,304-311,NA,Carbohydrate; Foraging effort; Juvenile development; Nutrient regulation; Protein; Sexual maturation
article,Mixed input to olfactory glomeruli from two subsets of ciliated sensory neurons does not impede relay neuron specificity in the crucian carp,"Hansson, Kenth-Arne and Doving, Kjell B. and Skjeldal, Frode M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The consensus view of olfactory processing is that the axons of receptor-specific primary olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) converge to a small subset of glomeruli, thus preserving the odour identity before the olfactory information is processed in higher brain centres. In the present study, we show that two different subsets of ciliated OSNs with different odorant specificities converge to the same glomeruli. In order to stain different ciliated OSNs in the crucian carp Carassius carassius we used two different chemical odorants, a bile salt and a purported alarm substance, together with fluorescent dextrans. The dye is transported within the axons and stains glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. Interestingly, the axons from the ciliated OSNs co-converge to the same glomeruli. Despite intermingled innervation of glomeruli, axons and terminal fields from the two different subsets of ciliated OSNs remained mono-coloured.

article,Skinned fibres produce the same power and force as intact fibre bundles from muscle of wild rabbits,"Curtin, Nancy A. and Diack, Rebecca A. and West, Timothy G. and Wilson, Alan M. and Woledge, Roger C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Skinned fibres have advantages for comparing the muscle properties of different animal species because they can be prepared from a needle biopsy taken under field conditions. However, it is not clear how well the contractile properties of skinned fibres reflect the properties of the muscle fibres in vivo. Here, we compare the mechanical performance of intact fibre bundles and skinned fibres from muscle of the same animals. This is the first such direct comparison. Maximum power and isometric force were measured at 25 degrees C using peroneus longus (PL) and extensor digiti-V (ED-V) muscles from wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). More than 90\% of the fibres in these muscles are fast-twitch, type 2 fibres. Maximum power was measured in force-clamp experiments. We show that maximum power per volume was the same in intact (121.3 +/- 16.1 W l(-1), mean +/- s.e.m.; N=16) and skinned (122.6 +/- 4.6 W l(-1); N=141) fibres. Maximum relative power (power/F-IM L-o, where F-IM is maximum isometric force and Lo is standard fibre length) was also similar in intact (0.645 +/- 0.037; N=16) and skinned (0.589 +/- 0.019; N=141) fibres. Relative power is independent of volume and thus not subject to errors in measurement of volume. Finally, maximum isometric force per cross-sectional area was also found to be the same for intact and skinned fibres (181.9 kPa +/- 19.1; N=16; 207.8 kPa +/- 4.8; N=141, respectively). These results contrast with previous measurements of performance at lower temperatures where skinned fibres produce much less power than intact fibres from both mammals and non-mammalian species.",2015,10.1242/jeb.121897,218,18,2856-2863,NA,Muscle; Power; Force; Skinned fibre; Rabbit

The effects of these mutations are not always well understood, partially because of difficulties in expressing these channels in heterologous systems. The use of Caenorhabditis elegans could be an alternative approach to determine the effects of mutations on voltage-gated calcium channel function because all the main types of voltage-gated calcium channels are found in C. elegans, a large panel of mutations already exists and efficient genetic tools are available to engineer customized mutations in any gene. In this study, we characterize the effects of two gain-of-function mutations in egl-19, which encodes the L-type calcium channel alpha(1) subunit. One of these mutations, ad695, leads to the replacement of a hydrophobic residue in the IIIS4 segment. The other mutation, n2368, changes a conserved glycine of IS6 segment; this mutation has been identified in patients with Timothy syndrome. We show that both egl-19 (gain-of-function) mutants have defects in locomotion and morphology that are linked to higher muscle tone. Using in situ electrophysiological approaches in striated muscle cells, we provide evidence that this high muscle tone is due to a shift of the voltage dependency towards negative potentials, associated with a decrease of the inactivation rate of the L-type Ca2+ current. Moreover, we show that the maximal conductance of the Ca2+ current is decreased in the strongest mutant egl-19(n2368), and that this decrease is correlated with a mislocalization of the channel.",2014,10.1242/jeb.106732,217,21,3805-3814,NA,Caenorhabditis elegans; Ca2+ channel; L-type; Mutation; Muscle
article,Net cardiac shunts in anuran amphibians: physiology or physics?,"Hillman, Stanley S. and Hedrick, Michael S. and Kohl, Zachary F.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Amphibians have a single ventricle and common conus arteriosus that produces an equal pressure to the parallel pulmocutaneous and systemic vascular circuits. The distribution of blood flows between the pulmocutaneous (Q(pul)) and systemic (Q(sys)) circuits (net cardiac shunt) varies with a number of environmental conditions and behaviours; although autonomic regulation of pulmonary vascular resistance conductance has been emphasized, little attention has been paid to the possible contribution of the passive physical characteristics of the two circuits to pressure changes associated with variation in cardiac output. In this study, we re-analysed three recent studies that recorded net cardiac shunts in the cane toad (Rhinella marina) under a variety of conditions and treatments. In all three studies, Q(pul) and Q(sys) were linearly related to cardiac output (Q(tot)), but the slope was threefold higher for Q(pul) compared with Q(sys) as predicted by relative conductance increases associated with increases in pressure from perfused preparations where autonomic regulation and humoral control were eliminated.

article,Lactate kinetics of rainbow trout during graded exercise: do catheters affect the cost of transport?,"Teulier, Loic and Omlin, Teye and Weber, Jean-Michel",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Changes in lactate kinetics as a function of exercise intensity have never been measured in an ectotherm. Continuous infusion of a tracer is necessary to quantify rates of lactate appearance (R-a) and disposal (R-d), but it requires double catheterization, which could interfere with swimming. Using rainbow trout, our goals were to: (1) determine the potential effects of catheters and blood sampling on metabolic rate ((M) over dot(O2)), total cost of transport (TCOT), net cost of transport (NCOT) and critical swimming speed (U-crit), and (2) monitor changes in lactate fluxes during prolonged, steady-state swimming or graded swimming from rest to U-crit. This athletic species maintains high baseline lactate fluxes of 24 mu mol kg(-1) min(-1) that are only increased at intensities >2.4 body lengths (BL) s(-1) or 85\% U-crit. As the fish reaches U-crit, R-a is more strongly stimulated (+67\% to 40.4 mu mol kg(-1) min(-1)) than R-d (+41\% to 34.7 mu mol kg(-1) min(-1)), causing a fourfold increase in blood lactate concentration. Without this stimulation of R-d during intense swimming, lactate accumulation would double. By contrast, steady-state exercise at 1.7 BL s(-1) increases lactate fluxes to similar to 30 mu mol kg(-1) min(-1), with a trivial mismatch between R-a and R-d that only affects blood concentration minimally. Results also show that the catheterizations and blood sampling needed to measure metabolite kinetics in exercising fish have no significant impact on (M) over dot(O2) or TCOT. However, these experimental procedures affect locomotion energetics by increasing NCOT at high speeds and by decreasing U-crit.",2013,10.1242/jeb.091058,216,24,4549-4556,NA,lactate turnover; carbohydrate metabolism; locomotion energetics; fish exercise; critical swimming speed; U-crit; continuous tracer infusion; respirometry; Oncorhynchus mykiss
article,Stress and death of cnidarian host cells play a role in cnidarian bleaching,"Paxton, Camille W. and Davy, Simon K. and Weis, Virginia M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Coral bleaching occurs when there is a breakdown of the symbiosis between cnidarian hosts and resident Symbiodinium spp. Multiple mechanisms for the bleaching process have been identified, including apoptosis and autophagy, and most previous work has focused on the Symbiodinium cell as the initiator of the bleaching cascade. In this work we show that it is possible for host cells to initiate apoptosis that can contribute to death of the Symbiodinium cell. First we found that colchicine, which results in apoptosis in other animals, causes cell death in the model anemone Aiptasia sp. but not in cultured Symbiodinium CCMP-830 cells or in cells freshly isolated from host Aiptasia ( at least within the time frame of our study). In contrast, when symbiotic Aiptasia were incubated in colchicine, cell death in the resident Symbiodinium cells was observed, suggesting a host effect on symbiont mortality. Using live-cell confocal imaging of macerated symbiotic host cell isolates, we identified a pattern where the initiation of host cell death was followed by mortality of the resident Symbiodinium cells. This same pattern was observed in symbiotic host cells that were subjected to temperature stress. This research suggests that mortality of symbionts during temperature-induced bleaching can be initiated in part by host cell apoptosis.",2013,10.1242/jeb.087858,216,15,2813-2820,NA,Aiptasia; apoptosis; Cnidaria; coral bleaching; innate immunity; Symbiodinium; symbiosis
article,Corticosterone and glucose are correlated and show similar response patterns to temperature and stress in a free-living bird,"Millanes, Paola M. and Perez-Rodriguez, Lorenzo and Rubalcaba, Juan G. and Gil, Diego and Jimeno, Blanca",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Glucocorticoid (GC) hormones have traditionally been interpreted as indicators of stress, but the extent to which they provide information on physiological state remains debated. GCs are metabolic hormones that amongst other functions ensure increasing fuel (i.e. glucose) supply on the face of fluctuating energetic demands, a role often overlooked by ecological studies investigating the consequences of GC variation. Furthermore, because energy budget is limited, in natural contexts where multiple stimuli coexist, the organisms' ability to respond physiologically may be constrained when multiple triggers of metabolic responses overlap in time. Using free-living spotless starling (Sturnus unicolor) chicks, we experimentally tested whether two stimuli of different nature known to trigger a metabolic or GC response, respectively, cause a comparable increase in plasma GCs and glucose. We further tested whether response patterns differed when both stimuli occurred consecutively. We found that both experimental treatments caused increases in GCs and glucose of similar magnitude, suggesting that both variables fluctuate along with variation in energy expenditure, independently of the trigger. Exposure to the two stimuli occurring subsequently did not cause a difference in GC or glucose responses compared with exposure to a single stimulus, suggesting a limited capacity to respond to an additional stimulus during an ongoing acute response. Lastly, we found a positive and significant correlation between plasma GCs and glucose after the experimental treatments. Our results add to the increasing research on the role of energy expenditure on GC variation, by providing experimental evidence on the association between plasma GCs and energy metabolism.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246905,227,14,NA,jeb246905,Glucocorticoids; Energy expenditure; Stress response; Metabolic rate; Sturnus unicolor

In Argentine ants (Linepithema humile), cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) communicate colony identity, but also provide waterproofing necessary to survive dry conditions. Theory suggests different CHC compound classes have functional trade-offs, such that selection for compounds used in communication would compromise waterproofing, and vice versa. We sampled sites of invasive L. humile populations from across California to test if CHC differences between them can explain differences in their desiccation survival. We hypothesized that CHCs whose abundance was correlated with environmental factors would determine survival during desiccation, but our regression analysis did not support this hypothesis. Interestingly, we found the abundance of most CHCs had a negative correlation with survival, regardless of compound class. We suggest that the CHC differences between L. humile nests in California are insufficient to explain their differential survival against desiccation, and that body mass is a better predictor of desiccation survival at this scale of comparison.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245578,226,16,NA,jeb245578,invasive species; supercolonies; Chemical ecology; Waterproofing; Communication
article,Vocalization-associated respiration patterns: thermography-based monitoring and detection of preparation for calling,"Demartsev, Vlad and Manser, Marta B. and Tattersall, Glenn J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Vocal emission requires coordination with the respiratory system. Monitoring the increase in laryngeal pressure, which is needed for vocal production, allows detection of transitions from quiet respiration to vocalization-supporting respiration. Characterization of these transitions could be used to identify preparation for vocal emission and to examine the probability of it manifesting into an actual vocal production event. Specifically, overlaying the subject's respiration with conspecific calls can highlight events of call initiation and suppression, as a means of signalling coordination and avoiding jamming. Here, we present a thermal imaging-based methodology for synchronized respiration and vocalization monitoring of free-ranging meerkats. The sensitivity of this methodology is sufficient for detecting transient changes in the subject's respiration associated with the exertion of vocal production. The differences in respiration are apparent not only during the vocal output, but also prior to it, marking the potential time frame of the respiratory preparation for calling. A correlation between conspecific calls with elongation of the focal subject's respiration cycles could be related to fluctuations in attention levels or in the motivation to reply. This framework can be used for examining the capability for enhanced respiration control in animals during modulated and complex vocal sequences, detecting `failed' vocalization attempts and investigating the role of respiration cues in the regulation of vocal interactions.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243474,225,5,NA,jeb243474,Acoustic signalling; Respiration monitoring; Thermography; Vocal emission

The energetic cost of an immune response is liable to scale with infection severity, prompting constraints on other self-maintenance traits if immune prioritization exceeds energy budget. In this study, adult male side-blotched lizards (Uta stansburiana) were injected with saline (control) or high (20 mu g g(-1) body mass) or low (10 mu g g(-1) body mass) concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to simulate bacterial infections of discrete severities. The costs and consequences of the immune response were assessed through comparisons of change in resting metabolic rate (RMR), energy metabolites (glucose, glycerol, triglycerides), innate immunity (bactericidal ability), sprint speed and oxidative status (antioxidant capacity, reactive oxygen metabolites). High-LPS lizards had the lowest glucose levels and greatest sprint reductions, while their RMR and bactericidal ability were similar to those of control lizards. Low-LPS lizards had elevated RMR and bactericidal ability, but glucose levels and sprint speed changes between those of high-LPS and control lizards. Levels of glycerol, triglycerides, reactive oxygen metabolites and antioxidant capacity did not differ by treatment. Taken together, energy expenditure for the immune response varies in a non-linear fashion with challenge severity, posing consequences for performance and self-maintenance processes in a reptile.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242608,224,17,NA,jeb242608,Antioxidant capacity; Bactericidal ability; Energy metabolites; Lipopolysaccharide; Sprint speed; Reactive oxygen metabolites; Resting metabolic rate; Uta stansburiana
article,How do red-eyed treefrog embryos sense motion in predator attacks? Assessing the role of vestibular mechanoreception,"Jung, Julie and Kim, Su J. and Arias, Sonia M. Perez and McDaniel, James G. and Warkentin, Karen M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The widespread ability to alter timing of hatching in response to environmental cues can serve as a defense against threats to eggs. Arboreal embryos of red-eyed treefrogs, Agalychnis callidryas, can hatch up to 30\% prematurely to escape predation. This escapehatching response is cued by physical disturbance of eggs during attacks, including vibrations or motion, and thus depends critically on mechanosensory ability. Predator-induced hatching appears later in development than flooding-induced, hypoxia-cued hatching; thus, its onset is not constrained by the development of hatching ability. It may, instead, reflect the development of mechanosensor function. We hypothesize that vestibular mechanoreception mediates escapehatching in snake attacks, and that the developmental period when hatching-competent embryos fail to flee from snakes reflects a sensory constraint. We assessed the ontogenetic congruence of escapehatching responses and an indicator of vestibular function, the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), in three ways. First, we measured VOR in two developmental series of embryos 3-7 days old to compare with the published ontogeny of escape success in attacks. Second, during the period of greatest variation in VOR and escape success, we compared hatching responses and VOR across sibships. Finally, in developmental series, we compared the response of individual embryos to a simulated attack cue with their VOR. The onset of VOR and hatching responses were largely concurrent at all three scales. Moreover, latency to hatch in simulated attacks decreased with increasing VOR. These results are consistent with a key role of the vestibular system in the escape-hatching response of A. callidryas embryos to attacks.",2019,10.1242/jeb.206052,222,21,NA,jeb206052,Environmentally cued hatching; Otoconial organ; Phenotypic plasticity; Biotremology; Predator risk; Ontogeny

In this way, we highlight how mechanistic properties central to evo-devo analyses - such as weak linkage, versatility, exploratory mechanisms, criticality, degeneracy, redundancy and modularity - affect neural circuit function and hence the range of behavioural variation that can be filtered by selection.

Unlike the well-known migrations of daytime flying butterflies, such as the painted lady (Vanessa cardui) or the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), much less widely known are the migrations of nocturnal moths. These migrations - typically involving billions of moths from different taxa - have recently attracted considerable scientific attention. Nocturnal moth migrations have traditionally been investigated by light trapping and by observations in the wild, but in recent times a considerable improvement in our understanding of this phenomenon has come from studying insect orientation behaviour, using vertical looking radar. In order to establish a new model organism to study compass mechanisms in migratory moths, we tethered each of two species of central European Noctuid moths in a flight simulator to study their flight bearings: the red underwing (Catocala nupta) and the large yellow underwing (Noctua pronuba). Both species had significantly oriented flight bearings under an unobscured view of the clear night sky and in the Earth's natural magnetic field. Red underwings oriented south southeast, while large yellow underwings oriented southwest, both suggesting a southerly autumn migration towards the Mediterranean. Interestingly, large yellow underwings became disoriented on humid (foggy) nights while red underwings remained oriented. We found no evidence in either species for a time-independent sky compass mechanism as previously suggested for the large yellow underwing.",2018,10.1242/jeb.179218,221,24,NA,jeb179218,Insect migration; Moth migration; Noctuid; Orientation; Navigation; Compass sense
article,The force-generation process in active muscle is strain sensitive and endothermic: a temperature-perturbation study,"Ranatunga, K. W. and Offer, Gerald",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In experiments on active muscle, we examined the tension decline and its temperature sensitivity at the onset of ramp shortening and at a range of velocities. A segment (similar to 1.5 mm long) of a skinned muscle fibre isolated from rabbit psoas muscle was held isometrically (sarcomere length similar to 2.5 mu m) at 8-9 degrees C, maximally Ca2+-activated and a ramp shortening applied. The tension decline with a ramp shortening showed an early decrease of slope (the P-1 transition) followed by a slower decrease in slope (the P-2 transition) to the steady (isotonic) force. The tension level at the initial P-1 transition and the time to that transition decreased as the velocity was increased; the length change to this transition increased with shortening velocity to a steady value of similar to 8 nm half-sarcomere(-1). A small, rapid, temperature jump (T-jump) (3-4 degrees C, <0.2 ms) applied coincident with the onset of ramp shortening showed force enhancement by T-jump and changed the tension decline markedly. Analyses showed that the rate of T-jump-induced force rise increased linearly with increase of shortening velocity. These results provide crucial evidence that the strain-sensitive cross-bridge force generation, or a step closely coupled to it, is endothermic.",2017,10.1242/jeb.167197,220,24,4733-4742,NA,Muscle force generation; Temperature effects; Ramp shortening
article,Take-off mechanisms in parasitoid wasps,"Burrows, Malcolm and Dorosenko, Marina",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"High-speed video analyses of the natural behaviour of parasitoid wasps revealed three strategies used to launch the insects into the air. Which strategy is the most energy efficient? In Pteromalus puparum, 92\% of take-offs by were propelled entirely by movements of the middle and hind legs, which were depressed at their coxotrochanteral and extended at their femoro-tibial joints. The front legs left the ground first, followed by the hind legs, so that the middle legs provided the final propulsion. Second, in other species of a similar mass, Cotesia glomerata and Leptopilina boulardi, all take-offs were propelled by a mean of 2.8 and 3.8 wingbeats, respectively, with little or no contribution from the legs. The first strategy resulted in take-off times that were four times shorter (5 versus 22.8 ms) and take-off velocities that were four times faster (0.8 versus 0.2 m s(-1)). Calculations from the kinematics indicate that propulsion by the legs was the most energy-efficient strategy, because more energy is put into propulsion of the body, whereas in take-off propelled by repetitive wing movements energy is lost to generating these movements and moving the air. In heavier species such as Netelia testacea and Amblyteles armatorius, take-off was propelled by the combined movements of the middle and hind legs and wingbeats. In A. armatorius, this resulted in the longest mean take-off time of 33.8 ms but an intermediate take-off velocity of 0.4 m s(-1). In all three strategies the performance could be explained without invoking energy storage and power amplification mechanisms.",2017,10.1242/jeb.161463,220,20,3812-3825,NA,Jumping; Flying; Kinematics; High-speed imaging; Escape movements; Biomechanics

Here we test how carotenoids affect the acute phase response (APR), an intense rapid systemic response characterized by fever, sickness behavior and production of acute phase proteins, which serves to reduce pathogen persistence. We conducted a 2x2 factorial design experiment in captive adult male and female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) to determine the effects of carotenoid supplementation on the intensity of the APR. We measured changes in feeding rate, activity level and body temperature of the birds. We found that, relative to unsupplemented controls, carotenoid-supplemented birds exhibited less severe reductions in feeding and activity, smaller increases in body temperature and lower circulating levels of haptoglobin (an acute phase protein) 24 h after inducing an APR. Among supplemented individuals, those with higher blood carotenoid levels exhibited a lower reduction in activity rate after 24 h. Forty-eight hours after APR induction, birds exhibited a significant decrease in plasma carotenoid levels and a decrease in bill hue, with less reduction in hue in carotenoid-supplemented individuals. These results demonstrate that carotenoids can alleviate several important behavioral and physiological effects of an APR and that bill color can change rapidly following induction of the costly APR immune defense. In particular, immune activation may have caused birds to preferentially draw down carotenoids from the bloodstream, ostensibly for use in health. Rapid bill color changes over a 48-h period support growing evidence that bills may serve as short-term signals of health and condition.",2017,10.1242/jeb.155069,220,16,2957-2964,NA,Antioxidants; Immune activation; Immunocompetence; Sexual ornamentation; Color signaling; Taeniopygia guttata

We examined how the swimming demands of a pelagic lifestyle influence postnatal maturation of Mb and buffering capacity in spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris longirostris). Mb content of newborn (1.16 +/- 0.07 g Mb per 100 g wet muscle mass, n=6) and juvenile (2.77 +/- 0.22 g per 100 g, n=4) spinner dolphins were only 19\% and 46\% of adult levels (6.00 +/- 0.74 g per 100 g, n=6), respectively. At birth, buffering capacity was 52.70 +/- 4.48 slykes (n=6) and increased to 78.53 +/- 1.91 slykes (n=6) once a body length of 141 cm was achieved, representing 1.6- to 2.0-year-old dolphins. Based on the age of weaning (1.3-1.6 years postpartum), muscle maturation occurred just after weaning as described for coastal bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Thus, a pelagic lifestyle does not promote rapid maturation of muscle biochemistry. Rather, it promotes enhanced muscle biochemistry: newborn and adult spinner dolphins had four-and two-times greater Mb contents than newborn and adult bottlenose dolphins, respectively. Indeed, adult levels rivaled those of deep-diving cetaceans.

P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In humans, the cation channel TRPM2 (HsTRPM2) has been intensively studied because it is involved in oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis and also contributes to temperature regulation. The gating mechanism of TRPM2 is quite complex, with a C-terminally localized enzyme domain playing a crucial role. The analysis of orthologues of TRPM2, in particular from the distantly related marine invertebrate Nematostella vectensis (NvTRPM2), revealed that during evolution, the functional role of the endogenous enzyme domain of TRPM2 has undergone fundamental changes. In this study, we investigated whether these evolutionary differences also apply to the physiological functions of TRPM2. For this purpose, we generated a TRPM2 loss-offunction mutation in N. vectensis and compared the phenotypes of wild-type and mutant animals after exposure to either oxidative stress or high temperature. Our results show that under standard culture conditions, mutant animals are indistinguishable from wild-type animals in terms of morphology and development. However, exposure of the two experimental groups to different stressors revealed that TRPM2 causes sensitization to oxidative stress but attenuates high-temperature injury in N. vectensis. Therefore, NvTRPM2 plays opposite roles in the cellular response to these two different stressors. These findings reveal a similar physiological spectrum of activity of TRPM2 in humans and N. vectensis and open up the possibility of establishing N. vectensis as a model organism for the physiological function of TRPM2.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243717,225,6,NA,jeb243717,NUDT9; Nematostella vectensis; TRPM channels; Environmental stress
article,"Learning walks in an Australian desert ant, <i>Melophorus bagoti</i>","Deeti, Sudhakar and Cheng, Ken",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The central Australian ant Melophorus bagoti is the most thermophilic ant in Australia and forages solitarily in the summer months during the hottest period of the day. For successful navigation, desert ants of many species are known to integrate a path and learn landmark cues around the nest. Ants perform a series of exploratory walks around the nest before their first foraging trip, during which they are presumed to learn about their landmark panorama. Here, we studied 15 naive M. bagoti ants transitioning from indoor work to foraging outside the nest. In 3-4 consecutive days, they performed 3-7 exploratory walks before heading off to forage. Naive ants increased the area of exploration around the nest and the duration of trips over successive learning walks. In their first foraging walk, the majority of the ants followed a direction explored on their last learning walk. During learning walks, the ants stopped and performed stereotypical orientation behaviours called pirouettes. They performed complete body rotations with stopping phases as well as small circular walks without stops known as voltes. After just one learning walk, these desert ants could head in the home direction from locations 2 m from the nest, although not from locations 4 m from the nest. These results suggest gradual learning of the visual landmark panorama around the foragers' nest.

article,Estimation of sinking velocity using free-falling dynamically scaled models: Foraminifera as a test case,"Walker, Matthew and Hammel, Jorg U. and Wilde, Fabian and Hoehfurtner, Tatjana and Humphries, Stuart and Schuech, Rudi",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The velocity of settling particles is an important determinant of distribution in extinct and extant species with passive dispersal mechanisms, such as plants, corals and phytoplankton. Here, we adapted dynamic scaling, borrowed from engineering, to determine settling velocity. Dynamic scaling leverages physical models with relevant dimensionless numbers matched to achieve similar dynamics to the original object. Previous studies have used flumes, wind tunnels or towed models to examine fluid flow around objects with known velocities.

article,Ambient temperature affects multiple drivers of physiology and behaviour: adaptation for timely departure of obligate spring migrants,"Sur, Sayantan and Chaturvedi, Khushboo and Sharma, Aakansha and Malik, Shalie and Rani, Sangeeta and Kumar, Vinod",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"We investigated the role of ambient temperature in departure from wintering areas of migratory black-headed buntings in spring. Birds transferred at 22 and 35 degrees C to long days were compared with one another and with controls held on short days for indices of readiness to migrate (Zugunruhe, fattening, mass gain), levels of testosterone and gonadal recrudescence. Temperature affected the development of migratory behaviour and physiology: buntings under long days at 35 degrees C, compared with those at 22 degrees C, showed altered migratory behaviour (daily activity and Zugunruhe onset), and enhanced muscle growth and plasma testosterone levels, but showed no effect on testis growth. Temperature was perceived at both peripheral and central levels, and affected multiple molecular-drivers culminating into the migratory phenotype. This was evidenced by post-mortem comparison of the expression of 13 genes with known functions in the skin (temperature-sensitive TRP channels: trpv4 and trpm8), hypothalamus and/or midbrain (migration-linked genes: th, ddc, adcyap1 and vps13a) and flight muscles (muscle growth associated genes: ar, srd5a3, pvalb, mtor, myod, mstn and hif1a). In photostimulated birds, the expression of trpv4 in skin, th in the hypothalamus and midbrain, and srd5a3, ar, pvalb and mtor in flight muscle, in parallel with testosterone levels, was greater at 35 degrees C than at 22 degrees C. These results demonstrate the role of ambient temperature in development of the spring migration phenotype, and suggest that transcriptional responsiveness to temperature is a component of the overall adaptive strategy in latitudinal songbird migrants for timely departure from wintering areas in spring.",2020,10.1242/jeb.236109,223,24,NA,jeb236109,Gene expression; Hypothalamus; Muscle; Photoperiod; Skin; Emberiza melanocephala
article,Vitellogenin offsets oxidative costs of reproduction in female painted dragon lizards,"Lindsay, Willow R. and Friesen, Christopher R. and Sihlbom, Carina and Bergstrom, Jorgen and Berger, Evelin and Wilson, Mark R. and Olsson, Mats",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Vitellogenesis ('yolking' of follicles) is a bioenergetically costly stage of reproduction requiring enlargement of the liver to produce vitellogenin (VTG) yolk precursor proteins, which are transported and deposited at the ovary. VTG may, however, serve non-nutritive anti-oxidant functions, a hypothesis supported by empirical work on aging and other life-history transitions in several taxa. We test this hypothesis in female painted dragon lizards (Ctenophorus pictus) by examining covariation in VTG with the ovarian cycle, and relative to reactive oxygen species (ROS) including baseline superoxide (bSO). Plasma VTG decreased prior to ovulation, when VTG is deposited into follicles. VTG, however, remained elevated post-ovulation when no longer necessary for yolk provisioning and was unrelated to reproductive investment. Instead, VTG was strongly and positively predicted by prior bSO. ROS, in tum, was negatively predicted by prior VTG, while simultaneously sampled VTG was a positive predictor. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that VTG functions as an anti-oxidant to counteract oxidative stress associated with vitellogenesis. The relationship between bSO and VTG was strongest in post-ovulatory females, indicating that its function may be largely anti-oxidant at this time. In conclusion, VTG may be under selection to offset oxidative costs of reproduction in egg-producing species.",2020,10.1242/jeb.221630,223,12,NA,jeb221630,Costs of reproduction; Life history trade-off; Lizard; Reactive oxygen species; ROS; Superoxide; Oxidative stress

Interestingly, some species, such as Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus), are more aggressive during the short-day photoperiods of the non-breeding season, despite gonadal regression. While our previous data suggest that Siberian hamsters employ a `seasonal switch' from gonadal to adrenal regulation of aggression during shortday photoperiods, there is emerging evidence that the gut microbiome, an environment of symbiotic bacteria within the gastrointestinal tract, may also change seasonally and modulate social behaviors. The goal of this study was to compare seasonal shifts in the gut microbiome, circulating levels of adrenal dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and aggression in male and female Siberian hamsters. Hamsters were housed in either long-day (LD) or short-day (SD) photoperiods for 9 weeks. Fecal samples were collected and behaviors were recorded following 3, 6 and 9 weeks of housing, and circulating DHEA was measured at week 9. SD females that were responsive to changes in photoperiod (SD-R), but not SD-R males, displayed increased aggression following 9 weeks of treatment. SD-R males and females also exhibited distinct changes in the relative abundance of gut bacterial phyla and families, yet showed no change in circulating DHEA. The relative abundance of some bacterial families (e.g. Anaeroplasmataceae in females) was associated with aggression in SD-R but not LD or SD non-responder (SD-NR) hamsters after 9 weeks of treatment. Collectively, this study provides insight into the complex role of the microbiome in regulating social behavior in seasonally breeding species.",2020,10.1242/jeb.212548,223,3,NA,jeb212548,Aggression; Dehydroepiandrosterone; Gut-brain axis; Microbiota; Day length; Seasonality

Axel W. and Ritchie, Michael G. and Hoikkala, Anneli",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The incidence of reproductive diapause is a critical aspect of life history in overwintering insects from temperate regions. Much has been learned about the timing, physiology and genetics of diapause in a range of insects, but how the multiple changes involved in this and other photoperiodically regulated traits are inter-related is not well understood. We performed quasinatural selection on reproduction under short photoperiods in a northern fly species, Drosophila montana, to trace the effects of photoperiodic selection on traits regulated by the photoperiodic timer and/or by a circadian clock system. Selection changed several traits associated with reproductive diapause, including the critical day length for diapause (CDL), the frequency of diapausing females under photoperiods that deviate from daily 24 h cycles and cold tolerance, towards the phenotypes typical of lower latitudes. However, selection had no effect on the period of free-running locomotor activity rhythm regulated by the circadian clock in fly brain. At a genomic level, selection induced extensive divergence from the control line in 16 gene clusters involved in signal transduction, membrane properties, immunologlobulins and development. These changes resembled those detected between latitudinally divergent D. montana populations in the wild and involved SNP divergence associated with several genes linked with diapause induction. Overall, our study shows that photoperiodic selection for reproduction under short photoperiods affects diapause-associated traits without disrupting the central clock network generating circadian rhythms in fly locomotor activity.",2019,10.1242/jeb.205831,222,20,NA,jeb205831,Reproductive diapause; Critical day length; Cold tolerance; Genome analyses; Photoperiodic timer; Circadian clock
article,Early gametogenesis in the Pacific oyster: new insights using stem cell and mitotic markers,"Cavelier, Patricia and Cau, Julien and Morin, Nathalie and Delsert, Claude",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"While our knowledge of bivalve gametogenesis has progressed in recent times, more molecular markers are needed in order to develop tissue imaging. Here, we identified stem cell and mitotic markers to further characterize oyster early gametogenesis, mainly through immunofluorescence microscopy. Intense alkaline phosphatase activity, a non-specific marker for stem cells, was detected on the outer edge of the gonad ducts at the post-spawning stage, suggesting an abundance of undifferentiated cells very early during the sexual cycle. This observation was confirmed using an antibody against Sox2, a transcription factor specific for stem or germline cells, which labeled cells in the gonad duct inner mass and ciliated epithelium early during the initial oyster sexual cycle. Moreover, Vasa, a cytoplasmic marker for germline cells, was also detected in the gonad acini and duct cells, thus confirming that germline cells were abundant early on. In addition, the binding of the minichromosome maintenance MCM6 protein to chromatin indicated the gonad acini and duct cells were engaged in the cell cycle. DNA replication was indeed confirmed by an abundant in vivo incorporation of BrdU into the duct cell chromatin. Finally, proliferation of acini and duct cells was demonstrated by the chromatin-bound Ser10-phosphorylated histone H3, a mitotic marker. The markers for the cell cycle and mitosis used here thus indicate that acini and duct cells were already actively dividing early during the oyster sexual cycle. In addition, together with the stem cell markers, these data reveal that the epithelium delimiting the duct outer edge contains a dynamic population of undifferentiated cells.",2017,10.1242/jeb.167734,220,21,3988-3996,NA,Germline cells; Cell cycle; Reproduction; Bivalve; Marine invertebrates

Spiders provide many spectacular examples of colours used in courtship, predation, defence and thermoregulation, but are thought to lack many types of pigments common in other animals. Ommochromes, bilins and eumelanin have been identified in spiders, but not carotenoids or melanosomes. Here, we combined optical microscopy, refractive index matching, confocal Raman microspectroscopy and electron microscopy to investigate the basis of several types of colourful patches in spiders. We obtained four major results. First, we show that spiders use carotenoids to produce yellow, suggesting that such colours may be used for condition-dependent courtship signalling. Second, we established the Raman signature spectrum for ommochromes, facilitating the identification of ommochromes in a variety of organisms in the future. Third, we describe a potential new pigmentary-structural colour interaction that is unusual because of the use of long wavelength structural colour in combination with a slightly shorter wavelength pigment in the production of red. Finally, we present the first evidence for the presence of melanosomes in arthropods, using both scanning and transmission electron microscopy, overturning the assumption that melanosomes are a synapomorphy of vertebrates. Our research shows that spiders have a much richer colour production palette than previously thought, and this has implications for colour diversification and function in spiders and other arthropods.",2017,10.1242/jeb.156083,220,11,1975-1983,NA,Arthropod; Carotenoid; Ommochrome; Melanosome; Raman spectroscopy; Silk
article,Controlled feeding trials with ungulates: a new application of <i>in vivo</i> dental molding to assess the abrasive factors of microwear,"Hoffman, Jonathan M. and Fraser, Danielle and Clementz, Mark T.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Microwear, the quantification of microscopic scratches and pits on the occlusal surfaces of tooth enamel, is commonly used as a paleodietary proxy. For ungulates (hoofed mammals), scratch-dominant microwear distinguishes modern grazers from browsers, presumably as a result of abrasion from grass phytoliths (biogenic silica). However, it is also likely that exogenous grit (i.e. soil, dust) is a contributing factor to these scratch-dominant patterns, which may reflect soil ingestion that varies with feeding height and/or environmental conditions (e.g. dust production in open and/or arid habitats). This study assessed the contribution of exogenous grit to tooth wear by measuring the effects of fine-and medium-grained silica sand on tooth enamel using a novel live-animal tooth-molding technique. It therefore constitutes the first controlled feeding experiment using ungulates and the first in vivo experiment using abrasives of different sizes. Four sheep were fed three diet treatments: (1) a mixture of Garrison and Brome hay (control), (2) hay treated with fine-grained silica sand (180-250 mu m) and (3) hay treated with medium-grained silica sand (250-425 mu m). We found a significant increase in pit features that was correlated with an increase in grain size of grit, corroborating earlier chewing simulation experiments that produced pits through grit-induced abrasion (i.e. the `grit effect'). Our results support an interpretation of large silica grains fracturing to create smaller, more abundant angular particles capable of abrasion, with jaw movement defining feature shape (i.e. scratch or pit).",2015,10.1242/jeb.118406,218,10,1538-1547,NA,Tooth enamel; Grit; Diet proxy; Jaw mechanics

We examined the effects of simulated pond drying and elevated water temperatures on development, growth, thermal physiology and behavior in a North American amphibian, Rana sphenocephala. Tadpoles were raised in outdoor mesocosms under warming and drying regimes based on projected climatic conditions in 2070. We predicted that amphibians experiencing the rapid pond drying and elevated pond temperatures associated with climate change would accelerate development, be smaller at metamorphosis and demonstrate long-term differences in physiology and exploratory behavior post-metamorphosis. Although both drying and warming accelerated development and reduced survival to metamorphosis, only drying resulted in smaller animals at metamorphosis. Around 1 month post-metamorphosis, animals from the control treatment jumped relatively farther at high temperatures in jumping trials. In addition, across all treatments, frogs with shorter larval periods had lower critical thermal minima and maxima. We also found that developing under warming and drying resulted in a less exploratory behavioral phenotype, and that drying resulted in higher selected temperatures in a thermal gradient. Furthermore, behavior predicted thermal preference, with less exploratory animals selecting higher temperatures. Our results underscore the multifaceted effects of early developmental environments on behavioral and physiological phenotypes later in life. Thermal preference can influence disease risk through behavioral thermoregulation, and exploratory behavior may increase risk of predation or pathogen encounter. Thus, climatic stressors during development may mediate amphibian exposure and susceptibility to predators and pathogens into later life stages.",2023,10.1242/jeb.244883,226,9,NA,jeb244883,Frogs; Behavioral Critical temperatures; Developmental Thermal physiology; Behavioral phenotype; Climate change; Critical temperatures; Developmental plasticity; Pond drying; Thermal physiology

To determine the role of temperature and photoperiod in seasonal changes in body mass and thermogenesis in Chinese hwameis (Garrulax canorus), we compared body mass, basal metabolic rate (BMR), energy intake and cellular metabolic capacity of the tissue (muscle) and/or organs (liver, kidney, heart and small intestine) in seasonally acclimatized and laboratory-acclimated hwameis. A significant seasonal influence on body mass and BMR (which peaked in winter) was found, and these variations were mirrored by exposing the housed birds to cold temperatures or a short photoperiod. The level of dry matter intake, gross energy intake and digestible energy intake was higher during winter, and in housed animals that were exposed to cold temperatures. These results suggest that by increasing energy intake and thermogenesis, Chinese hwameis can overcome winter thermoregulatory challenges. When compared with warm-acclimated birds, cold-acclimated birds displayed higher mass-specific and whole-organ state 4 respiration in the muscle, liver and kidney, and higher mass-specific and whole-organ cytochrome c oxidase activity in the liver. These data demonstrate that cellular thermogenesis partly underpins basal thermoregulation in Chinese hwameis. Cold temperature and short photoperiod can be used as helpful environmental cues during seasonal acclimatization. However, the role of temperature is more significant compared with that of photoperiod in Chinese hwameis; the changes in energy metabolism and thermoregulation induced by temperature appear to be intensified by photoperiod.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244502,225,17,NA,jeb244502,Basal metabolic rate; Birds; Cytochrome c oxidase; Energy intake; State 4 respiration

We used the green-striped burrowing frog (Cyclorana alboguttata) to test the hypothesis that animals seek hypoxic microhabitats that accentuate metabolic depression during dormancy. We first measured the partial pressure of oxygen (P-O2) within artificial cavities excavated in wet clay soil, which simulated C. alboguttata underground aestivation chambers, and recorded hypoxic conditions (P-O2 as low as 8.9 kPa). Using custom-built tunnels that maintained a longitudinal P-O2 gradient (hypoxic to normoxic), we then examined the P-O2 preference of C. alboguttata in response to drying habitat conditions. In support of our hypothesis, we found that C. alboguttata chose to spend a greater proportion of time at the hypoxic end of the P-O2 gradient compared with the normoxic end. To determine whether hypoxia accentuates metabolic depression in C. alboguttata, we exposed frogs to normoxia (21.0 kPa) or hypoxia (10.5 kPa) for 7 weeks during the transition from an active to an aestivating state. We found that hypoxia exposure accelerated the onset of metabolic depression in C. alboguttata by 2 weeks. Furthermore, we found that frogs exposed to hypoxia exhibited a 66\% reduction in O-2 consumption after 7 weeks compared with active frogs in normoxia, whereas frogs exposed to normoxia reduced O-2 consumption by only 51\%. Overall, our findings indicate that some animals may seek microhabitats to maximally depress metabolic rate during dormancy, and that microhabitat O-2 availability can have significant implications for energy metabolism.",2020,10.1242/jeb.218743,223,2,NA,jeb218743,Dormancy; Aestivation; Hypometabolism; Hypoxia; Oxygen gradient; Amphibians

In hematophagous insects, a blood meal during which the animal ingests huge amounts of salt and water stimulates transepithelial transport processes linked to V-ATPase activation, but how this is accomplished is still unclear. Here we report that membrane-permeant derivatives of cAMP increase the bafilomycin-sensitive ATPase activity in Malpighian tubules of Aedes aegypti twofold and activate ATP-dependent transport processes. In parallel, membrane association of the V-1 subunits C and D increases, consistent with the assembly of the holoenzyme. The protein kinase A inhibitor H-89 abolishes all cAMP-induced effects, consistent with protein kinase A (PKA) being involved in V-ATPase activation.

article,Balanced mitochondrial function at low temperature is linked to cold adaptation in<i> Drosophila</i> species,"Jorgensen, Lisa Bjerregaard and Hansen, Andrea Milena and Willot, Quentin and Overgaard, Johannes",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The ability of ectothermic animals to live in different thermal environments is closely associated with their capacity to maintain physiological homeostasis across diurnal and seasonal temperature fluctuations. For chill-susceptible insects, such as Drosophila, cold tolerance is tightly linked to ion and water homeostasis obtained through a regulated balance of active and passive transport. Active transport at low temperature requires a constant delivery of ATP and we therefore hypothesize that cold-adapted Drosophila are characterized by superior mitochondrial capacity at low temperature relative to cold-sensitive species. To address this, we investigated how experimental temperatures from 1 to 19 degrees C affected mitochondrial substrate oxidation in flight muscle of seven Drosophila species and compared it with a measure of species cold tolerance (CTmin, the temperature inducing cold coma). Mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates measured using a substrate-uncoupler-inhibitor titration (SUIT) protocol showed that cooling generally reduced oxygen consumption of the electron transport system across species, as was expected given thermodynamic effects. Complex I respiration is the primary consumer of oxygen at non-stressful temperatures, but low temperature decreases complex I respiration to a much greater extent in cold -sensitive species than in cold-adapted species. Accordingly, cold -induced reduction of complex I respiration correlates strongly with CTmin. The relative contribution of other substrates (proline, succinate and glycerol 3-phosphate) increased as temperature decreased, particularly in the cold-sensitive species. At present, it is unclear whether the oxidation of alternative substrates can be used to offset the effects of the temperature-sensitive complex I, and the potential functional consequences of such a substrate switch are discussed.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245439,226,8,NA,jeb245439,CTmin; Mitochondrial flexibility; OXPHOS; Thermal sensitivity; Cold tolerance; Complex I

Two occludin isoforms (designated Ocln and Ocln-a) and a tricellulin (Tric) were identified. Transcripts encoding ocln, ocln-a and tric were broadly expressed in larval lamprey, with the greatest abundance of ocln in the gut, liver and kidney, ocln-a in the gill and skin, and tric in the kidney. Ocln and Ocln-a resolved as similar to 63 kDa and similar to 35 kDa MW proteins, respectively, while Tric resolved as a similar to 50 kDa protein. Ocln immunolocalized to the gill vasculature and in gill mucous cells while Ocln-a localized to the gill pouch and gill epithelium. Both Ocln and Ocln-a localized in the nephron, the epidermis and the luminal side of the gut. In branchial tissue, Tric exhibited punctate localization, consistent with its presence at regions of tricellular contact. Following ion-poor water (IPW) acclimation of ammocoetes, serum {[}Na+] and {[}Cl-] decreased, but not {[}Ca2+], and carcass moisture content increased. In association, Ocln abundance increased in the skin and kidney, but reduced in the gill of IPW-acclimated ammocoetes while Ocln-a abundance reduced in the kidney only.

We tested the hypothesis that embryonic oxygen uptake is limited in aquatic environments relative to air using the self-fertilizing amphibious mangrove rivulus, Kryptolebias marmoratus, which typically inhabits hypoxic, water-filled crab burrows. We found that adult mangrove rivulus released twice as many embryos in terrestrial versus aquatic environments and that air-reared embryos had accelerated developmental rates. Surprisingly, air- reared embryos consumed 44\% less oxygen and possessed larger yolk reserves, but attained the same mass, length and chorion thickness. Water-reared embryos moved their opercula similar to 2.5 more times per minute compared with air- reared embryos at 7 days post-release, which probably contributed to the higher rates of oxygen uptake and yolk utilization we observed. Genetically identical air- and water-reared embryos from the same parent were raised to maturity, but the embryonic environment did not affect growth, reproduction or emersion ability in adults. Therefore, although aspects of early development were plastic, these early differences were not sustained into adulthood. Kryptolebias marmoratus embryos hatched out of water when exposed to aerial hypoxia. We conclude that exposure to a terrestrial environment reduces the energetic costs of development partly by reducing the necessity of embryonic movements to dispel stagnant boundary layers. Terrestrial incubation of young would be especially beneficial to amphibious fishes that occupy aquatic habitats of poor water quality, assuming low terrestrial predation and desiccation risks.",2015,10.1242/jeb.127399,218,20,3249-3256,NA,Developmental plasticity; Developmental rate; Oxygen consumption; Operculum; Chorion; Mangrove rivulus

Antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutases (SODs) and catalases, are present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and provide an important means of neutralizing such oxidants. Studies in cnidarians have previously documented the occurrence of antioxidant enzymes (transcript expression, protein expression and/or enzymatic activity), but most of these studies have not been conducted in species with sequenced genomes or included phylogenetic analyses, making it difficult to compare results across species due to uncertainties in the relationships between genes. Through searches of the genome of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis Stephenson, one catalase gene and six SOD family members were identified, including three copper/zinc-containing SODs (CuZnSODs), two manganese-containing SODs (MnSODs) and one copper chaperone of SOD (CCS). In 24 h acute toxicity tests, juvenile N. vectensis showed enhanced sensitivity to combinations of ultraviolet radiation (UV) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, specifically pyrene, benzo{[} a] pyrene and fluoranthene) relative to either stressor alone. Adult N. vectensis exhibited little or no mortality following UV, benzo{[} a] pyrene or crude oil exposure but exhibited changes in gene expression. Antioxidant enzyme transcripts were both upregulated and downregulated following UV and/or chemical exposure.

Characterizing patterns of variation in metabolic, physiological and thermal traits along an elevational gradient, and the plastic potential of these traits, is necessary to understand current and future responses to abiotic constraints at high elevations, including limited oxygen availability. We performed a transplant experiment with the upslope-colonizing common wall lizard (Podarcis muralis) in which we measured nine aspects of thermal physiology and aerobic capacity in lizards from replicate low- (400 m above sea level, ASL) and high-elevation (1700 m ASL) populations. We first measured traits at their elevation of origin and then transplanted half of each group to extreme high elevation (2900 m ASL; above the current elevational range limit of this species), where oxygen availability is reduced by similar to 25\% relative to sea level. After 3 weeks of acclimation, we again measured these traits in both the transplanted and control groups. The multivariate thermal-metabolic phenotypes of lizards originating from different elevations differed clearly when measured at the elevation of origin. For example, high-elevation lizards are more heat tolerant than their low-elevation counterparts (counter-gradient variation). Yet, these phenotypes converged after exposure to reduced oxygen availability at extreme high elevation, suggesting limited plastic responses under this novel constraint. Our results suggest that high-elevation populations are well suited to their oxygen environments, but that plasticity in the thermal-metabolic phenotype does not pre-adapt these populations to colonize more hypoxic environments at higher elevations.",2021,10.1242/jeb.243660,224,24,NA,jeb243660,Climate warming; Hypoxia adaptation; Metabolic physiology; Multivariate phenotype; Phenotypic plasticity; Thermal physiology

Yet, it is not fully understood how coronary O-2 delivery affects tolerance to environmental extremes such as warming and hypoxia. Hypoxia reduces arterial oxygenation, while warming increases overall tissue O-2 demand. Thus, as both stressors are associated with reduced venous O-2 supply to the heart, we hypothesised that coronary flow benefits hypoxia and warming tolerance. To test this hypothesis, we blocked coronary blood flow (via surgical coronary ligation) in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and assessed how in vivo cardiorespiratory performance and whole-animal tolerance to acute hypoxia and warming was affected. While coronary ligation reduced routine stroke volume relative to trout with intact coronaries, cardiac output was maintained by an increase in heart rate. However, in hypoxia, coronary-ligated trout were unable to increase stroke volume to maintain cardiac output when bradycardia developed, which was associated with a slightly reduced hypoxia tolerance. Moreover, during acute warming, coronary ligation caused cardiac function to collapse at lower temperatures and reduced overall heat tolerance relative to trout with intact coronary arteries. We also found a positive relationship between individual hypoxia and heat tolerance across treatment groups, and tolerance to both environmental stressors was positively correlated with cardiac performance. Collectively, our findings show that coronary perfusion improves cardiac O-2 supply and therefore cardiovascular function at environmental extremes. which benefits tolerance to natural and anthropogenically induced environmental perturbations.",2021,10.1242/jeb.239970,224,8,NA,jeb239970,Cardiorespiratory performance; Coronary artery; Hypoxia; Warming
article,Neural dysfunction correlates with heat coma and CT<sub>max</sub> in <i>Drosophila</i> but does not set the boundaries for heat stress survival,"Jorgensen, Lisa B. and Robertson, R. Meldrum and Overgaard, Johannes",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"When heated, insects lose coordinated movement followed by the onset of heat coma (critical thermal maximum, CTmax). These traits are popular measures to quantify interspecific and intraspecific differences in insect heat tolerance, and CTmax correlates well with current species distributions of insects, including Drosophila. Here, we examined the function of the central nervous system (CNS) in five species of Drosophila with different heat tolerances, while they were exposed to either constant high temperature or a gradually increasing temperature (ramp). Tolerant species were able to preserve CNS function at higher temperatures and for longer durations than sensitive species, and similar differences were found for the behavioural indices (loss of coordination and onset of heat coma). Furthermore, the timing and temperature (constant and ramp exposure, respectively) for loss of coordination or complete coma coincided with the occurrence of spreading depolarisation (SD) events in the CNS. These SD events disrupt neurological function and silence the CNS, suggesting that CNS failure is the primary cause of impaired coordination and heat coma. Heat mortality occurs soon after heat coma in insects; to examine whether CNS failure could also be the proximal cause of heat death, we used selective heating of the head (CNS) and abdomen (visceral tissues). When comparing the temperature causing 50\% mortality (LT50) of each body part versus that of the whole animal, we found that the head was not particularly heat sensitive compared with the abdomen. Accordingly, it is unlikely that nervous failure is the principal/proximate cause of heat mortality in Drosophila.",2020,10.1242/jeb.218750,223,13,NA,jeb218750,CNS; Heat death; Spreading depolarisation; Heat sensitivity; Hyperthermia; Thermal tolerance
article,Oxygen safety margins set thermal limits in an insect model system,"Boardman, Leigh and Terblanche, John S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"A mismatch between oxygen availability and metabolic demand may constrain thermal tolerance. While considerable support for this idea has been found inmarine organisms, results from insects are equivocal and raise the possibility that mode of gas exchange, oxygen safety margins and the physico-chemical properties of the gas medium influence heat tolerance estimates. Here, we examined critical thermal maximum(CTmax) and aerobic scope under altered oxygen supply and in two life stages that varied in metabolic demand in Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae). We also systematically examined the influence of changes in gas properties on CTmax. Larvae have a lower oxygen safety margin (higher critical oxygen partial pressure at which metabolism is suppressed relative to metabolic demand) and significantly higher CTmax under normoxia than pupae (53 degrees C vs 50 degrees C). Larvae, but not pupae, were oxygen limited with hypoxia (2.5 kPa) decreasing CTmax significantly from 53 to 51 degrees C. Humidifying hypoxic air relieved the oxygen limitation effect on CTmax in larvae, whereas variation in other gas properties did not affect CTmax. Our data suggest that oxygen safety margins set thermal limits in air-breathing invertebrates and the magnitude of this effect potentially reconciles differences in oxygen limitation effects on thermal tolerance found among diverse taxa to date.",2015,10.1242/jeb.120261,218,11,1677-1685,NA,Bombyx mori; Thermolimit respirometry; Critical temperature; Supply and demand; Oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance
article,Temperature effects on the contractile performance and efficiency of oxidative muscle from a eurythermal versus a stenothermal salmonid,"Gamperl, A. Kurt and Syme, Douglas A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"We compared the thermal sensitivity of oxidative muscle function between the eurythermal Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and the more stenothermal Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus; which prefers cooler waters). Power output was measured in red skeletal muscle strips and myocardial trabeculae, and efficiency (net work/energy consumed) was measured for trabeculae, from cold (6 degrees C) and warm (15 degrees C) acclimated fish at temperatures from 2 to 26 degrees C. The mass-specific net power produced by char red muscle was greater than in salmon, by 2-to 5-fold depending on test temperature. Net power first increased, then decreased, when the red muscle of 6 degrees C-acclimated char was exposed to increasing temperature. Acclimation to 15 degrees C significantly impaired mass-specific power in char (by similar to 40-50\%) from 2 to 15 degrees C, but lessened its relative decrease between 15 and 26 degrees C. In contrast. maximal net power increased, and then plateaued, with increasing temperature in salmon from both acclimation groups. Increasing test temperature resulted in a similar to 3- to 5-fold increase in maximal net power produced by ventricular trabeculae in all groups, and this effect was not influenced by acclimation temperature. Nonetheless, lengthening power was higher in trabeculae from warm-acclimated char, and char trabeculae could not contract as fast as those from salmon. Finally, the efficiency of myocardial net work was approximately 2-fold greater in 15 degrees C-acclimated salmon than char (similar to 15 versus 7\%), and highest at 20 degrees C in salmon. This study provides several mechanistic explanations as to their inter-specific difference in upper thermal tolerance, and potentially why southern char populations are being negatively impacted by climate change.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242487,224,15,NA,jeb242487,Thermal tolerance; Heart; Myocardium; Red muscle; Acute; Temperature acclimation; Muscle performance; Muscle efficiency
article,Constant temperature and fluctuating temperature have distinct effects on hypoxia tolerance in killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus),"Ridgway, Megan R. and Scott, Graham R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Climate change is leading to rapid change in aquatic environments, increasing the mean and variability of temperatures, and increasing the incidence of hypoxia. We investigated how acclimation to constant temperatures or to diel temperature fluctuations affects hypoxia tolerance in mummichog killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus). Killifish were acclimated to constant cool (15 \& DEG;C), constant warm (25 \& DEG;C) or a diel temperature cycle (15 \& DEG;C at night, 25 \& DEG;C during day) for 6 weeks. We then measured hypoxia tolerance (time to loss of equilibrium in severe hypoxia, tLOE; critical O2 tension, Pcrit), whole-animal metabolism, gill morphology, haematology and tissue metabolites at 15 \& DEG;C and 25 \& DEG;C in a full factorial design. Among constant temperature groups, tLOE was highest and Pcrit was lowest in fish tested at their acclimation temperature. Warm-acclimated fish had lower metabolic rate at 25 \& DEG;C and greater gill surface area (less coverage of lamellae by interlamellar cell mass, ILCM), but coolacclimated fish had greater brain glycogen stores. Therefore, effects of constant temperature acclimation on hypoxia tolerance were temperature specific and not exhibited broadly across test temperatures, and they were associated with different underlying mechanisms. Hypoxia tolerance was less sensitive to test temperature in fish acclimated to fluctuating temperatures compared with fish acclimated to constant temperature. Acclimation to fluctuating temperatures also increased haemoglobin-O2 affinity of the blood (decreased P50) compared with constant temperature groups. Therefore, acclimation to fluctuating temperatures helps maintain hypoxia tolerance across a broader range of temperatures, and leads to some distinct physiological adjustments that are not exhibited by fish acclimated to constant temperatures.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245425,226,10,NA,jeb245425,by temperatures; KEY WORDS; Teleost; Thermal breadth; Respiration; O2 transport; Gill remodelling; Anaerobic metabolism
article,Short-duration respirometry underestimates metabolic rate for discontinuous breathers,"Winwood-Smith, Hugh S. and White, Craig R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Metabolic rate is commonly estimated from rates of gas exchange. An underappreciated factor that can influence estimates is patterns of pulmonary respiration. Amphibians display discontinuous respiratory patterns, often including long apnoeas. in addition to cutaneous gas exchange. The contnbution of cutaneous exchange increases at low temperatures when metabolic rate is low. Because of the relatively low permeability of skin, measurements that disproportionately capture cutaneous exchange can produce underestimates of metabolic rate. The permeability of amphibian skin to CO2 is greater than that to O-2; therefore, calculating the ratio of whole-animal C-O2 emission to O-2 uptake (the respiratory exchange ratio, RER) can be used to avoid underestimates of metabolic rate by ensuring that observed values of RER fall within the normal physiological range (similar to 0.7 to 1). Using data for cane toads, Rhinella marina, we show that short-duration measurements lead to underestimates of metabolic rate and overestimates of RER. At low temperatures, this problem is exacerbated, requiring over 12 h for RER to fall within the normal physiological range. Many published values of metabolic rate in animals that utilise cutaneous exchange may be underestimates.",2018,10.1242/jeb.175752,221,14,NA,NA,Respiratory exchange ratio; Cutaneous; Gas exchange; Calorimetry; Cold; Amphibian

WNS is responsible for a catastrophic decline of hibernating bats in North America, yet we have limited understanding of the physiological interactions between pathogen and host. Pseudogymnoascus destructans severely damages wings and tail membranes, by causing dryness that leads to whole sections crumbling off. Four possible mechanisms have been proposed by which infection could lead to dehydration; in this study, we tested one: P. destructans infection could cause disruption to passive gas-exchange pathways across the wing membranes, thereby causing a compensatory increase in water-intensive pulmonary respiration. We hypothesized that total evaporative water loss would be greater when passive gas exchange was inhibited. We found that bats did not lose more water when passive pathways were blocked. This study provides evidence against the proposed proximal mechanism that disruption to passive gas exchange causes dehydration and death to WNS-infected bats.",2015,10.1242/jeb.118950,218,13,1986-1989,NA,Dehydration; White-nose syndrome; Gas exchange; Pseudogymnoascus destructans
article,Could thermal sensitivity of mitochondria determine species distribution in a changing climate?,"Iftikar, Fathima I. and MacDonald, Julia R. and Baker, Daniel W. and Renshaw, Gillian M. C. and Hickey, Anthony J. R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"For many aquatic species, the upper thermal limit (T-max) and the heart failure temperature (T-HF) are only a few degrees away from the species' current environmental temperatures. While the mechanisms mediating temperature-induced heart failure (HF) remain unresolved, energy flow and/or oxygen supply disruptions to cardiac mitochondria may be impacted by heat stress. Recent work using a New Zealand wrasse (Notolabrus celidotus) found that ATP synthesis capacity of cardiac mitochondria collapses prior to THF. However, whether this effect is limited to one species from one thermal habitat remains unknown. The present study confirmed that cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to heat stress-induced HF in two additional wrasses that occupy cold temperate (Notolabrus fucicola) and tropical (Thalassoma lunare) habitats. With exposure to heat stress, T. lunare had the least scope to maintain heart function with increasing temperature. Heat-exposed fish of all species showed elevated plasma succinate, and the heart mitochondria from the cold temperate N. fucicola showed decreased phosphorylation efficiencies (depressed respiratory control ratio, RCR), cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) flux and electron transport system (ETS) flux. In situ assays conducted across a range of temperatures using naive tissues showed depressed complex II (CII) and CCO capacity, limited ETS reserve capacities and lowered efficiencies of pyruvate uptake in T. lunare and N. celidotus. Notably, alterations of mitochondrial function were detectable at saturating oxygen levels, indicating that cardiac mitochondrial insufficiency can occur prior to HF without oxygen limitation. Our data support the view that species distribution may be related to the thermal limits of mitochondrial stability and function, which will be important as oceans continue to warm.",2014,10.1242/jeb.098798,217,13,2348-2357,NA,Fish; Thermal limits; Cardiac mitochondria; Heart failure; Oxidative phosphorylation

The thermal environment during incubation may affect the trade-off between growth and thermoregulation, but the effects of temperature on the ontogeny of endothermy are not fully understood. Therefore, we experimentally tested whether heating the nest cup of Eurasian blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) during incubation would influence cold tolerance of the chicks after hatching. Chicks from both heated and control nests showed a decrease in cooling rate with age as they became increasingly endothermic and homeothermic. However, chicks from previously heated nests cooled at a lower rate per unit surface area and from across the whole body. These chicks also had a greater body mass during the first 12 days of life compared with chicks from control nests. Lower cooling rates in heated chicks may reflect greater thermogenic capacity or a reduced surface area to volume ratio owing to a greater body mass. Future projections for climate change predict rising air temperature and increased likelihood of heatwaves, even in temperate regions. Our results indicate that nest microclimate can affect thermoregulation in offspring, and thus may be used to predict some of the future physiological responses of birds to climate change during breeding.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243933,225,10,NA,jeb243933,Body temperature; Homeothermy; Thermoregulation; Endothermy; Climate change; Avian physiology

The ability of species to acclimate to high temperatures may determine whether populations can persist in their native ranges. We examined physiological and molecular responses of juvenile brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) to six acclimation temperatures (5, 10, 15, 20, 23 and 25 degrees C) that span the thermal distribution of the species to predict acclimation limits. Brook trout exhibited an upregulation of stress-related mRNA transcripts (heat shock protein 90-beta, heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein, glutathione peroxidase 1) and downregulation of transcription factors and osmoregulation-related transcripts (nuclear protein 1, Na+/K+/2Cl(-) co-transporter-1-a) at temperatures >= 20 degrees C. We then examined the effects of acclimation temperature on metabolic rate (MR) and physiological parameters in fish exposed to an acute exhaustive exercise and air exposure stress. Fish acclimated to temperatures >= 20 degrees C exhibited elevated plasma cortisol and glucose, and muscle lactate after exposure to the acute stress. Fish exhibited longer MR recovery times at 15 and 20 degrees C compared with the 5 and 10 degrees C groups; however, cortisol levels remained elevated at temperatures >= 20 degrees C after 24 h. Oxygen consumption in fish acclimated to 23 degrees C recovered quickest after exposure to acute stress. Standard MR was highest and factorial aerobic scope was lowest for fish held at temperatures >= 20 degrees C.

article,Evidence that stress-induced changes in surface temperature serve a thermoregulatory function,"Robertson, Joshua K. and Mastromonaco, Gabriela and Burness, Gary",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The fact that body temperature can rise or fall following exposure to stressors has been known for nearly two millennia; however, the functional value of this phenomenon remains poorly understood. We tested two competing hypotheses to explain stress-induced changes in temperature, with respect to surface tissues. Under the first hypothesis, changes in surface temperature are a consequence of vasoconstriction that occur to attenuate blood loss in the event of injury and serve no functional purpose per se; defined as the `haemoprotective hypothesis'. Under the second hypothesis, changes in surface temperature reduce thermoregulatory burdens experienced during activation of a stress response, and thus hold a direct functional value: the `thermoprotective hypothesis'. To understand whether stress-induced changes in surface temperature have functional consequences, we tested predictions of these two hypotheses by exposing black-capped chickadees (n=20) to rotating stressors across an ecologically relevant ambient temperature gradient, while non-invasively monitoring surface temperature (eye region temperature) using infrared thermography. Our results show that individuals exposed to rotating stressors reduce surface temperature and dry heat loss at low ambient temperature and increase surface temperature and dry heat loss at high ambient temperature, when compared with controls. These results support the thermoprotective hypothesis and suggest that changes in surface temperature following stress exposure have functional consequences and are consistent with an adaptation. Such findings emphasize the importance of the thermal environment in shaping physiological responses to stressors in vertebrates, and in doing so, raise questions about their suitability within the context of a changing climate.",2020,10.1242/jeb.213421,223,4,NA,jeb213421,Thermoregulation; Haemodynamics; Thermography; Poecile atricapilus

However, corals hosting certain symbionts ( notably some members of Symbiodinium clade D) resist bleaching when exposed to high temperatures. To determine whether these symbionts are also cold tolerant, we exposed corals hosting either Symbiodinium C3 or D1a to incremental warming (+1 degrees C week(-1) to 35 degrees C) and cooling (-1 degrees C week-1 to 15 degrees C), and measured photodamage and symbiont loss. During warming to 33 degrees C, C3 corals were photodamaged and lost > 99\% of symbionts, while D1a corals experienced photodamage but did not bleach. During cooling, D1a corals suffered more photodamage than C3 corals but still did not bleach, while C3 corals lost 94\% of symbionts. These results indicate that photodamage does not always lead to bleaching, suggesting alternate mechanisms exist by which symbionts resist bleaching, and helping explain the persistence of D1a symbionts on recently bleached reefs, with implications for the future of these ecosystems.",2017,10.1242/jeb.148239,220,7,1192-1196,NA,Symbiodinium; Montastraea cavernosa; Coral bleaching; Symbiosis
article,Plasticity of non-shivering thermogenesis and brown adipose tissue in high-altitude deer mice,"Coulson, Soren Z. and Robertson, Cayleih E. and Mahalingam, Sajeni and McClelland, Grant B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"High altitude environments challenge small mammals with persistent low ambient temperatures that require high rates of aerobic heat production in face of low O-2 availability. An important component of thermogenic capacity in rodents is non-shivering thermogenesis (NST) mediated by uncoupled mitochondrial respiration in brown adipose tissue (BAT). NST is plastic, and capacity for heat production increases with cold acclimation. However, in lowland native rodents, hypoxia inhibits NST in BAT. We hypothesize that highland deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) overcome the hypoxic inhibition of NST through changes in BAT mitochondrial function. We tested this hypothesis using lab born and raised highland and lowland deer mice, and a lowland congeneric (Peromyscus leucopus), acclimated to either warm normoxia (25 degrees C, 760 mmHg) or cold hypoxia (5 degrees C, 430 mmHg). We determined the effects of acclimation and ancestry on whole-animal rates of NST, the mass of interscapular BAT (iBAT), and uncoupling protein (UCP)-1 protein expression. To identify changes in mitochondrial function, we conducted high-resolution respirometry on isolated iBAT mitochondria using substrates and inhibitors targeted to UCP-1. We found that rates of NST increased with cold hypoxia acclimation but only in highland deer mice. There was no effect of cold hypoxia acclimation on iBAT mass in any group, but highland deer mice showed increases in UCP-1 expression and UCP-1-stimulated mitochondrial respiration in response to these stressors. Our results suggest that highland deer mice have evolved to increase the capacity for NST in response to chronic cold hypoxia, driven in part by changes in iBAT mitochondrial function.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242279,224,10,NA,jeb242279,Mitochondria; Acclimation; Uncoupling protein-1; Peromyscus maniculatus; Peromyscus leucopus

To address these issues we investigated the visual system of the whooping crane Grus americana (Gruiformes, Gruidae), which is one of only two North American crane species. It is a large, long-lived bird in which UV sensitivity might be reduced by chromatic aberration and entrance of UV radiation into the eye could be detrimental to retinal tissues. To investigate the whooping crane visual system we used microspectrophotometry to determine the absorbance spectra of retinal oil droplets and to investigate whether the ocular media (i.e. the lens and cornea) absorb UV radiation. In vitro expression and reconstitution was used to determine the absorbance spectra of rod and cone visual pigments. The rod visual pigments had wavelengths of peak absorbance (lambda(max)) at 500 nm, whereas the cone visual pigment lambda(max) values were determined to be 404 nm (SWS1), 450 nm (SWS2), 499 nm (RH2) and 561 nm (LWS), similar to other characterized bird visual pigment absorbance values. The oil droplet cut-off wavelength (lambda(cut)) values similarly fell within ranges recorded in other avian species: 576 nm (R-type), 522 nm (Y-type), 506 nm (P-type) and 448 nm (C-type). We confirm that G. americana has a violet-sensitive visual system; however, as a consequence of the lambda(max) of the SWS1 visual pigment (404 nm), it might also have some UV sensitivity.",2014,10.1242/jeb.108456,217,21,3883-3890,NA,Whooping crane; Visual pigment; Opsin; Ocular media; Oil droplets

Our previous immunohistochemical studies of chicken retinae with an antiserum that labelled only activated cryptochrome 1a had shown activation of cryptochrome 1a under 373 nm UV, 424 nm blue, 502 nm turquoise and 565 nm green light. Green light, however, does not allow the first step of photoreduction of oxidized cryptochromes to the semiquinone. As the chickens had been kept under `white' light before, we suggested that there was a supply of the semiquinone present at the beginning of the exposure to green light, which could be further reduced and then re-oxidized. To test this hypothesis, we exposed chickens to various wavelengths (1) for 30 min after being kept in daylight, (2) for 30 min after a 30 min pre-exposure to total darkness, and (3) for 1 h after being kept in daylight. In the first case, we found activated cryptochrome 1a under UV, blue, turquoise and green light; in the second two cases we found activated cryptochrome 1a only under UV to turquoise light, where the complete redox cycle of cryptochrome can run, but not under green light. This observation is in agreement with the hypothesis that activated cryptochrome 1a is found as long as there is some of the semiquinone left, but not when the supply is depleted.

article,Functional plasticity of the gut and the Malpighian tubules underlies cold acclimation and mitigates cold-induced hyperkalemia in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>,"Yerushalmi, Gil Y. and Misyura, Lidiya and MacMillan, Heath A. and Donini, Andrew",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"At low temperatures, Drosophila, like most insects, lose the ability to regulate ion and water balance across the gut epithelia, which can lead to a lethal increase of {[}K+] in the hemolymph (hyperkalemia). Cold acclimation, the physiological response to a prior low temperature exposure, can mitigate or entirely prevent these ion imbalances, but the physiological mechanisms that facilitate this process are not well understood. Here, we test whether plasticity in the ionoregulatory physiology of the gut and Malpighian tubules of Drosophila may aid in preserving ion homeostasis in the cold. Upon adult emergence, D. melanogaster females were subjected to 7 days at warm (25 degrees C) or cold (10 degrees C) acclimation conditions. The cold-acclimated flies had a lower critical thermal minimum (CTmin), recovered from chill coma more quickly, and better maintained hemolymph K+ balance in the cold. The improvements in chill tolerance coincided with increased Malpighian tubule fluid secretion and better maintenance of K+ secretion rates in the cold, as well as reduced rectal K+ reabsorption in cold-acclimated flies. To test whether modulation of ion-motive ATPases, the main drivers of epithelial transport in the alimentary canal, mediate these changes, we measured the activities of Na+/K+-ATPase and V-type H+-ATPase at the Malpighian tubules, midgut, and hindgut. Na+/K+-ATPase and V-type H+-ATPase activities were lower in the midgut and the Malpighian tubules of cold-acclimated flies, but unchanged in the hindgut of cold-acclimated flies, and were not predictive of the observed alterations in K+ transport. Our results suggest that modification of Malpighian tubule and gut ion and water transport probably prevents cold-induced hyperkalemia in cold-acclimated flies, and that this process is not directly related to the activities of the main drivers of ion transport in these organs, Na+/K+-and V-type H+-ATPases.",2018,10.1242/jeb.174904,221,6,NA,jeb174904,Chill tolerance; Ionoregulation; Gut; Malpighian tubules; SIET

Wesley and Somero, George N.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Cardiac function is thought to play a central role in determining thermal optima and tolerance limits in teleost fishes. Investigating proteomic responses to temperature in cardiac tissues may provide insights into mechanisms supporting the thermal plasticity of cardiac function. Here, we utilized a global proteomic analysis to investigate changes in cardiac protein abundance in response to temperature acclimation (transfer from 13 degrees C to 9, 19 and 26 degrees C) in a eurythermal goby, Gillichthys mirabilis. Proteomic data revealed 122 differentially expressed proteins across acclimation groups, 37 of which were identified using tandem mass-spectrometry. These 37 proteins are involved in energy metabolism, mitochondrial regulation, iron homeostasis, cytoprotection against hypoxia, and cytoskeletal organization. Compared with the 9 and 26 degrees C groups, proteins involved in energy metabolism increased in 19 degrees C-acclimated fish, indicating an overall increase in the capacity for ATP production. Creatine kinase abundance increased in 9 degrees C-acclimated fish, suggesting an important role for the phosphocreatine energy shuttle in cold-acclimated hearts. Both 9 and 26 degrees C fish also increased abundance of hexosaminidase, a protein directly involved in post-hypoxia stress cytoprotection of cardiac tissues. Cytoskeletal restructuring appears to occur in all acclimation groups; however, the most prominent effect was detected in 26 degrees C-acclimated fish, which exhibited significantly increased actin levels. Overall, proteomic analysis of cardiac tissue suggests that the capacity to adjust ATP-generating processes is crucial to the thermal plasticity of cardiac function.

Juvenile loggerhead turtles in the Mediterranean Sea made prolonged inactive dives (>400 min), indicating a state of dormancy during the cold winter period. However, seasonal differences in dive duration were not detected in juvenile loggerheads in the western North Pacific, even though the ambient water temperature changed by more than 10 degrees C. Thus, metabolic states might differ among populations, explaining differences in the diving behaviour of juveniles during winter. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the active overwintering behaviour of juvenile loggerheads in the western North Pacific is driven by a high resting metabolic rate (RMR) with low thermal dependence. The RMR of juveniles in the western North Pacific (N=13) was 1.4-5.7 times higher (Q(10)=1.8) than that of juveniles in the Mediterranean Sea (Q(10)=5.4), To validate the high RMR values in the western North Pacific, the difference between core body temperature and ambient water temperature (Delta T-b) was estimated from measured RMR and was compared with measured Delta T-b. The measured and estimated Delta T-b matched each other. In addition, most of the dives conducted by the turtles in the western North Pacific were within the calculated aerobic dive limit (cADL) expected from the measured metabolic rate. Our results indicate that high RMR with low thermal dependence induces active diving during the overwintering periods of juvenile loggerheads in the western North Pacific, supporting the suggestion that metabolic states differ among populations.",2018,10.1242/jeb.175836,221,13,NA,NA,Respirometry; Body temperature; Diving behaviour; Overwintering strategy; Satellite tracking; Caretta caretta
article,Severe hypoxia exposure inhibits larval brain development but does not affect the capacity to mount a cortisol stress response in zebrafish,"Mikloska, V, Kristina and Zrini, Zoe A. and Bernier, Nicholas J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Fish nursery habitats are increasingly hypoxic and the brain is recognized as highly hypoxia sensitive, yet there is a lack of information on the effects of hypoxia on the development and function of the larval fish brain. Here, we tested the hypothesis that by inhibiting brain development, larval exposure to severe hypoxia has persistent functional effects on the cortisol stress response in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Exposing 5 days post-fertilization (dpf) larvae to 10\% dissolved O-2 (DO) for 16 h only marginally reduced survival, but it decreased forebrain neural proliferation by 55\%, and reduced the expression of neurod1, gfap and mbpa, markers of determined neurons, glia and oligodendrocytes, respectively. The 5 dpf hypoxic exposure also elicited transient increases in whole-body cortisol and in crf, uts1 and hsd20b2 expression, key regulators of the endocrine stress response. Hypoxia exposure at 5 dpf also inhibited the cortisol stress response to hypoxia in 10 dpf larvae and increased hypoxia tolerance. However, 10\% DO exposure at 5 dpf for 16 h did not affect the cortisol stress response to a novel stressor in 10 dpf larvae or the cortisol stress response to hypoxia in adult fish. Therefore, while larval exposure to severe hypoxia can inhibit brain development, it also increases hypoxia tolerance. These effects may transiently reduce the impact of hypoxia on the cortisol stress response but not its functional capacity to respond to novel stressors. We conclude that the larval cortisol stress response in zebrafish has a high capacity to cope with severe hypoxia-induced neurogenic impairment.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243335,225,2,NA,jeb243335,Environmental stressors; Neural proliferation; Stress response; Hypoxia tolerance; Developmental programming; Hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal axis

However, the individual salt preferences of water-collecting bees were not known. We measured the proboscis extension reflex (PER) response of Apis mellifera water foragers to 0-10\% w/w solutions of Na, Mg and K, ions that provide essential nutrients. We also tested phosphate, which can deter foraging. Bees exhibited significant preferences, with the most PER responses for 1.5-3\% Na and 1.5\% Mg. However, K and phosphate were largely aversive and elicited PER responses only for the lowest concentrations, suggesting a way to deter bees from visiting contaminated water. We then analyzed the salt content of water sources that bees collected in urban and semi-urban environments. Bees collected water with a wide range of salt concentrations, but most collected water sources had relatively low salt concentrations, with the exception of seawater and swimming pools, which had >0.6\% Na. The high levels of PER responsiveness elicited by 1.5-3\% Na may explain why bees are willing to collect such salty water. Interestingly, bees exhibited high individual variation in salt preferences: individual identity accounted for 32\% of variation in PER responses. Salt specialization may therefore occur in water foragers.",2016,10.1242/jeb.132019,219,6,790-796,NA,Apis mellifera; Water foraging; PER; Sodium preference; Salt concentration
article,The potential effects of climate-change-associated temperature increases on the metabolic rate of a small Afrotropical bird,"Thompson, Lindy J. and Brown, Mark and Downs, Colleen T.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Studies have only recently begun to underline the importance of including data on the physiological flexibility of a species when modelling its vulnerability to extinction from climate change. We investigated the effects of a 4 degrees C increase in ambient temperature (T-a), similar to that predicted for southern Africa by the year 2080, on certain physiological variables of a 10-12 g passerine bird endemic to southern Africa, the Cape white-eye Zosterops virens. There was no significant difference in resting metabolism, body mass and intraperitoneal body temperature between birds housed indoors at 4 degrees C above outside ambient temperature and those housed indoors at outside ambient temperature.

article,Influence of surface free energy of the substrate and flooded water on the attachment performance of stick insects (Phasmatodea) with different adhesive surface microstructures,"Thomas, Julian and Gorb, Stanislav N. and Buescher, Thies H.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Stick and leaf insects (Phasmatodea) are exclusively herbivores. As they settle in a broad range of habitats, they need to attach to and walk on a wide variety of plant substrates, which can vary in their surface free energy (SFE). The adhesive microstructures (AMs) on the euplantulae of phasmids are assumed to be adapted to such substrate properties. Moreover, the natural substrates can often be covered with water as a result of high relative humidity or rain. Although considerable experimental research has been carried out on different aspects of stick insect attachment, the adaptations to cope with the influence of flooded water on attachment performance remain unclear. To elucidate the role of AMs in this context, we here measured attachment forces in three species of stick insects with different AMs. The results show that attachment forces of the three species studied were influenced by the SFE and the presence of water: they all showed higher pull-off (vertical) and traction (horizontal) forces on dry surfaces, compared with when the surfaces were covered with a water film. However, the extent to which the surface properties influenced attachment differed depending on the species and its AMs. All three species showed approximately the same attachment performance on dry surfaces with different surface free energy but maintained attachment underwater to different extents.",2023,10.1242/jeb.244295,226,3,NA,jeb244295,Biomechanics; Functional morphology; Friction; Adhesion; Tarsus morphology; Locomotion
article,Phenotypic flexibility in respiratory traits is associated with improved aerial respiration in an amphibious fish out of water,"Blanchard, Tessa S. and Whitehead, Andrew and Dong, Yunwei W. and Wright, Patricia A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Amphibious fishes have evolved multiple adaptive strategies for respiring out of water, but there has been less focus on reversible plasticity. We tested the hypothesis that when amphibious fishes leave water, enhanced respiratory performance on land is the result of rapid functional phenotypic flexibility of respiratory traits. We acclimated four isogenic strains of Kryptolebias marmoratus to air for 0, 1, 3 or 7 days. We compared respiratory performance out of water with traits linked to the O-2 cascade. Aerial O-2 consumption rate was measured over a step-wise decrease in O-2 levels. There were significant differences between strains, but time out of water had the largest impact on measured parameters. Kryptolebias marmoratus had improved respiratory performance {[}lower aerial critical oxygen tension (P-crit), higher regulation index (RI)] after only 1 day of air exposure, and these changes were strongly associated with the change in hematocrit and dorsal cutaneous angiogenesis. Additionally, we found that 1 h of air exposure induced the expression of four angiogenesis-associated genes - vegfa, angpt2, pecam-1 and efna1 - in the skin. After 7 days in air, respiratory traits were not significantly linked to the variation in either aerial P-crit or RI. Overall, our data indicate that there are two phases involved in the enhancement of aerial respiration: an initial rapid response (1 day) and a delayed response (7 days). We found evidence for the hypothesis that respiratory performance on land in amphibious fishes is the result of rapid flexibility in both O-2 uptake and O-2 carrying capacity.",2019,10.1242/jeb.186486,222,2,NA,jeb186486,Oxygen carrying capacity; Angiogenesis; Hematocrit; Skin respiration; Kryptolebias marmoratus; P-crit; Metabolic rate
article,Sucking lice and spiracular transpiration: turning a liability into a benefit and a necessity,"Burgess, Ian F.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Sucking lice feed on blood and therefore ingest more water than they require for maintaining hydration. This water must be excreted; however, unlike other blood-feeding insects, they do not produce urine but do become dehydrated within hours if unable to feed. Using human clothing lice and head lice, Pediculus humanus ssp., and high sensitivity balances, it was shown that recently fed lice lost mass consistently as water ingested with the blood meal was excreted via the respiratory system. If all spiracles were occluded using petroleum jelly, mass/water loss was inhibited. Blocking thoracic spiracles resulted in a slight reduction in the rate of mass loss compared with untreated lice, but blocking the abdominal spiracles resulted in an enhanced rate of mass loss. Lice immersed in water did not lose mass but maintained the same mass for several hours, after which they increased in mass as the tissues became turgid, indicating that the insects were able to block water ingress during the period of stability, but that after some time the mechanism failed allowing water to enter the lice by osmosis.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244041,225,7,NA,jeb244041,Anoplura; Excretion; Spiracles; Transpiration; Water management
article,Integration of celestial compass cues in the central complex of the locust brain,"Pegel, Uta and Pfeiffer, Keram and Homberg, Uwe",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Many insects rely on celestial compass cues such as the polarization pattern of the sky for spatial orientation. In the desert locust, the central complex (CX) houses multiple sets of neurons, sensitive to the oscillation plane of polarized light and thus probably acts as an internal polarization compass. We investigated whether other sky compass cues like direct sunlight or the chromatic gradient of the sky might contribute to this compass. We recorded from polarizationsensitive CX neurons while an unpolarized green or ultraviolet light spot was moved around the head of the animal. All types of neuron that were sensitive to the plane of polarization (E-vector) above the animal also responded to the unpolarized light spots in an azimuthdependent way. The tuning to the unpolarized light spots was independent of wavelength, suggesting that the neurons encode solar azimuth based on direct sunlight and not on the sky chromatic gradient. Two cell types represented the natural 90 deg relationship between solar azimuth and zenithal E-vector orientation, providing evidence to suggest that solar azimuth information supports the internal polarization compass. Most neurons showed advances in their tuning to the E-vector and the unpolarized light spots dependent on rotation direction, consistent with anticipatory signaling. The amplitude of responses and its variability were dependent on the level of background firing, possibly indicating different internal states. The integration of polarization and solar azimuth information strongly suggests that besides the polarization pattern of the sky, direct sunlight might be an important cue for sky compass navigation in the locust.",2018,10.1242/jeb.171207,221,2,NA,jeb171207,Insect brain; Desert locust; Head direction cells; Spatial orientation; Sky compass; Chromatic gradient
article,Evaluating the physiological significance of hypoxic hyperventilation in larval zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>),"Pan, Yihang K. and Mandic, Milica and Zimmer, Alex M. and Perry, Steve F.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In water-breathing fishes, the hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) represents an increase in water flow over the gills during exposure to lowered ambient O-2 levels. The HVR is a critical defense mechanism that serves to delay the negative consequences of hypoxia on aerobic respiration. However, the physiological significance of the HVR in larval fishes is unclear as they do not have a fully developed gill and rely primarily on cutaneous gas transfer. Using larval zebrafish (4, 7, 10 and 15 days post-fertilization; dpf), we examined HVR under three levels of hypoxia (25, 45 and 60 mmHg). The larvae exhibited widely different HVRs as a function of developmental age and level of the hypoxia. Yet, critical O-2 tensions (P-crit) remained constant (30-34 mmHg) over the same period of development. Micro-optrode O-2 sensors were used to measure a significant decrease in buccal cavity water O-2 tensions in 4 and 7 dpf larvae compared with the water they inspired, demonstrating significant extraction of O-2 from the buccal cavity. To assess the physiological significance of the HVR, ventilatory water flow was prevented in larvae at 4 and 7 dpf by embedding their heads in agar. An increase in P-crit was observed in larvae at 7 dpf but not 4 dpf, suggesting that buccal ventilation is important for O-2 extraction by 7 dpf. Combined, these data indicate that branchial/buccal gas transfer plays a significant role in O-2 uptake during hypoxia, and supports a physiological benefit of the HVR in early life stages of zebrafish.",2019,10.1242/jeb.204800,222,13,NA,jeb204800,Oxygen consumption; Critical P-O2; Control of breathing; Cutaneous gas transfer; Gill
article,Cutaneous respiration by diving beetles from underground aquifers of Western Australia (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae),"Jones, Karl K. and Cooper, Steven J. B. and Seymour, Roger S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Insects have a gas-filled respiratory system, which provides a challenge for those that have become aquatic secondarily. Diving beetles (Dytiscidae) use bubbles on the surface of their bodies to supply O-2 for their dives and passively gain O-2 from the water. However, these bubbles usually require replenishment at the water's surface. A highly diverse assemblage of subterranean dytiscids has evolved in isolated calcrete aquifers of Western Australia with limited/no access to an air-water interface, raising the question of how they are able to respire. We explored the hypothesis that they use cutaneous respiration by studying the mode of respiration in three subterranean dytiscid species from two isolated aquifers. The three beetle species consume O-2 directly from the water, but they lack structures on their bodies that could have respiratory function. They also have a lower metabolic rate than other insects. O-2 boundary layers surrounding the beetles are present, indicating that O-2 diffuses into the surface of their bodies via cutaneous respiration. Cuticle thickness measurements and other experimental results were incorporated into a mathematical model to understand whether cutaneous respiration limits beetle size. The model indicates that the cuticle contributes considerably to resistance in the O-2 cascade. As the beetles become larger, their metabolic scope narrows, potentially limiting their ability to allocate energy to mating, foraging and development at sizes above approximately 5 mg. However, the ability of these beetles to utilise cutaneous respiration has enabled the evolution of the largest assemblage of subterranean dytiscids in the world.",2019,10.1242/jeb.196659,222,7,NA,jeb196659,Allometry; Aquatic insect; Body mass; Boundary layer; Cuticle; Metabolic rate; Oxygen consumption
article,Waking to drink: rates of evaporative water loss determine arousal frequency in hibernating bats,"Ben-Hamo, Miriam and Munoz-Garcia, Agusti and Williams, Joseph B. and Korine, Carmi and Pinshow, Berry",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Bats hibernate to cope with low ambient temperatures (T-a) and low food availability during winter. However, hibernation is frequently interrupted by arousals, when bats increase body temperature (T-b) and metabolic rate (MR) to normothermic levels. Arousals account for more than 85\% of a bat's winter energy expenditure. This has been associated with variation in T-b, T-a or both, leading to a single testable prediction, i.e. that torpor bout length (TBL) is negatively correlated with T-a and T-b. T-a and T-b were both found to be correlated with TBL, but correlations alone cannot establish a causal link between arousal and T-b or T-a. Because hydration state has also been implicated in arousals from hibernation, we hypothesized that water loss during hibernation creates the need in bats to arouse to drink. We measured TBL of bats (Pipistrellus kuhlii) at the same T-a but under different conditions of humidity, and found an inverse relationship between TBL and total evaporative water loss, independent of metabolic rate, which directly supports the hypothesis that hydration state is a cue to arousal in bats.",2013,10.1242/jeb.078790,216,4,573-577,NA,water balance; hibernation; Pipistrellus kuhlii; torpor bout length
article,Huffin' and puffin: seabirds use large bills to dissipate heat from energetically demanding flight,"Schraft, Hannes A. and Whelan, Shannon and Elliott, Kyle H.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Endothermic animals regulate body temperature by balancing metabolic heat production and heat exchange with the environment. Heat dissipation is especially important during and immediately after demanding activities such as flapping flight, the most energetically expensive mode of locomotion. As uninsulated appendages, bird bills present a potential avenue for efficient heat dissipation. Puffins possess large bills and are members of the bird family with the highest known flight cost. Here, we used infrared thermography to test whether wild tufted puffins (Fratercula cirrhata) use their bills to dissipate excess heat after energetically expensive flight. Both bill surface temperature and the proportion of total heat exchange occurring at the bill decreased with time since landing, suggesting that bills are used to dissipate excess metabolic heat. We propose that bill size in puffins may be shaped by opposing selective pressures that include dissipating heat after flight and conserving heat in cold air and water temperatures.",2019,10.1242/jeb.212563,222,21,NA,jeb212563,Alcidae; Allen's rule; Energetics; Thermal imaging
article,Hemodynamic responses to warming in euryhaline rainbow trout: implications of the osmo-respiratory compromise,"Morgenroth, Daniel and Ekstrom, Andreas and Hjelmstedt, Per and Grans, Albin and Axelsson, Michael and Sandblom, Erik",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In seawater, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) drink and absorb water through the gastrointestinal tract to compensate for water passively lost to the hyperosmotic environment. Concomitantly, they exhibit elevated cardiac output and a doubling of gastrointestinal blood flow to provide additional O-2 to the gut and increase convective flux of absorbed ions and water. Yet, it is unknown how warming waters, which elevate tissue O-2 demand and the rate of diffusion of ions and water across the gills (i.e. the osmo-respiratory compromise), affects these processes. We measured cardiovascular and blood variables of rainbow trout acclimated to freshwater and seawater during acute warming from 11 to 17 degrees C. Relative to freshwater-acclimated trout, cardiac output was 34\% and 55\% higher in seawater-acclimated trout at 11 and 17 degrees C, respectively, which allowed them to increase gastrointestinal blood flow significantly more during warming (increases of 75\% in seawater vs. 31\% in freshwater). These adjustments likely served to mitigate the impact of warming on osmotic balance, as changes in ionic and osmotic blood composition were minor. Furthermore, seawater-acclimated trout seemingly had a lower tissue O-2 extraction, explaining why trout acclimated to freshwater and seawater often exhibit similar metabolic rates, despite a higher cardiac output in seawater. Our results highlight a novel role of gastrointestinal blood perfusion in the osmo-respiratory compromise in fish, and improve our understanding of the physiological changes euryhaline fishes must undergo when faced with interacting environmental challenges such as transient warming events.",2019,10.1242/jeb.207522,222,17,NA,jeb207522,Cardiovascular; Gastrointestinal blood flow; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Osmoregulation; Warming

Although considerable research on sexual selection has focused on structurally coloured plumage ornaments, the proximate mechanisms of their potential condition dependence, and thus their honesty, is rarely addressed, particularly in an experimental context. Blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) nestlings have ultraviolet (UV)-blue structurally coloured tail feathers, providing a unique opportunity for investigation of the causes of variation in their colour. Here, we examined the influence of early growing conditions on the reflectance and structural properties of UV-blue-coloured tail feathers of blue tit nestlings. We applied a two-stage brood size manipulation to determine which stage of development more strongly impacts the quality of tail feather colouration and microstructure. We used small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and electron microscopy to characterise the nanoscale and microscale structure of tail feather barbs. Nestlings from the broods enlarged at a later stage of growth showed a sex-specific rectrix development delay, with males being more sensitive to this manipulation. Contrary to predictions, treatment affected neither the quality of the barbs' nanostructures nor the brightness and UV chroma of feathers. However. at the microscale. barbs' keratin characteristics were impaired in late-enlarged broods. Our results suggest that nanostructure quality, which determines the UV-blue colour in tail feathers, is not sensitive to early rearing conditions. Furthermore, availability of resources during feather growth seems to impact the quality of feather microstructure more than body condition, which is likely to be determined at an earlier stage of nestling growth.",2020,10.1242/jeb.228387,223,18,NA,jeb228387,Blue tit; Early-rearing conditions; Microstructure; Rectrices; Small angle X-ray scattering; Structural colouration

Regional differences in K+ fluxes along the gut were evident, where K+ efflux in vitro (or absorption into the hemolymph in vivo) was greatest at the anterior ileum, and lowest at the colon. Ileal K+ efflux was inhibited by both Scg-AST-6 and Locmi-FGLa/AST-2, with maximal inhibition at 10-10 and 10(-11) mol l(-1), respectively. Both FGLa/ASTs also inhibited cAMP-stimulated K+ efflux from the ileum. Locmi-FGLa/AST-2 also inhibited efflux of water across the ileum. Locusts are terrestrial insects living in dry climates, risking desiccation and making water conservation a necessity. The results suggest that FGLa/ASTs may be acting as diuretics by increasing K+ excretion and therefore increasing water excretion. Thus it is likely that FGLa/ASTs are involved in the control of hemolymph water and ion levels during feeding and digestion, to help the locust deal with the excess K+ load (and subsequently fluid) when the meal is processed.",2014,10.1242/jeb.101774,217,18,3377-3385,NA,Locusta migratoria; Peptide; FGLa/AST; Scanning ion-selective electrode technique; Ion; Ileum; Hindgut; Second messenger; cAMP; Sequencing; Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight
article,Physiological tradeoffs may underlie the evolution of hypoxia tolerance and exercise performance in sunfish (Centrarchidae),"Crans, Kyle D. and Pranckevicius, Nicole A. and Scott, Graham R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Tradeoffs between hypoxia tolerance and aerobic exercise performance appear to exist in some fish taxa, even though both of these traits are often associated with a high O-2 transport capacity. We examined the physiological basis for this potential tradeoff in four species of sunfish from the family Centrarchidae. Hypoxia tolerance was greatest in rock bass, intermediate in pumpkinseed and bluegill and lowest in largemouth bass, based on measurements of critical O-2 tension (P-crit) and O-2 tension at loss of equilibrium (P-O2 at LOE). Consistent with there being a tradeoff between hypoxia tolerance and aerobic exercise capacity, the least hypoxia-tolerant species had the highest critical swimming speed (U-crit) during normoxia and suffered the greatest decrease in U-crit in hypoxia. There was also a positive correlation between U-crit in normoxia and P-O2 at LOE, which remained significant after accounting for phylogeny using phylogenetically independent contrasts. Several sub-organismal traits appeared to contribute to both hypoxia tolerance and aerobic exercise capacity (reflected by traits that were highest in both rock bass and largemouth bass), such as the gas-exchange surface area of the gills, the pH sensitivity of haemoglobin-O-2 affinity, and the activities of lactate dehydrogenase and the gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase in the liver. Some other sub-organismal traits were uniquely associated with either hypoxia tolerance (low sensitivity of haemoglobin-O-2 affinity to organic phosphates, high pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase activities in the heart) or aerobic exercise capacity (capillarity and fibre size of the axial swimming muscle). Therefore, the cumulative influence of a variety of respiratory and metabolic traits can result in physiological tradeoffs associated with the evolution of hypoxia tolerance and aerobic exercise performance in fish.",2015,10.1242/jeb.124602,218,20,3264-3275,NA,Respiration; Oxygen cascade; Critical O-2 tension; Energy metabolism; Centrarchids; Muscle histology
article,Ecology of ontogenetic body-mass scaling of gill surface area in a freshwater crustacean,"Glazier, Douglas S. and Paul, David A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Several studies have documented ecological effects on intraspecific and interspecific body-size scaling of metabolic rate. However, little is known about how various ecological factors may affect the scaling of respiratory structures supporting oxygen uptake for metabolism. To our knowledge, our study is the first to provide evidence for ecological effects on the scaling of a respiratory structure among conspecific populations of any animal. We compared the body-mass scaling of gill surface area (SA) among eight spring-dwelling populations of the amphipod crustacean Gammarus minus. Although gill SA scaling was not related to water temperature, conductivity or G. minus population density, it was significantly related to predation regime (and secondarily to pH). Body-mass scaling slopes for gill SA were significantly lower in four populations inhabiting springs with fish predators than for four populations in springs without fish (based on comparing means of the population slopes, or slopes calculated from pooled raw data for each comparison group). As a result, gill SA was proportionately smaller in adult amphipods from springs with versus without fish. This scaling difference paralleled similar differences in the scaling exponents for the rates of growth and resting metabolic rate. We hypothesized that gill SA scaling is shallower in fish-containing versus fishless spring populations of G. minus because of effects of size-selective predation on size-specific growth and activity that in turn affect the scaling of oxygen demand and concomitantly the gill capacity (SA) for oxygen uptake. Although influential theory claims that metabolic scaling is constrained by internal body design, our study builds on previous work to show that the scaling of both metabolism and the respiratory structures supporting it may be ecologically sensitive and evolutionarily malleable.",2017,10.1242/jeb.155242,220,11,2120-2127,NA,Allometry; Freshwater springs; Gammarus minus; Metabolism; Oxygen uptake; Predation

Throughout their evolutionary history, they have adapted to tolerate hypoxia, high salinity, low temperature and, in particular, to tolerate conditions of high hydrostatic pressure. To understand the limits of the capacity of lice to survive during host deep dives, we conducted a series of controlled experiments in the laboratory. We collected lice from elephant seals and submitted the different life stages to high pressure conditions. Lice were first exposed to one of four hydrostatic pressures: 30, 80, 150 or 200 kg cm(-2). They were then exposed a second time to higher or lower hydrostatic pressure conditions to test for the impact of the first experience, which could either be deleterious or trigger physiological adaption, allowing them a better tolerance to high pressure. We found that lice from elephant seals can tolerate hydrostatic pressures higher than 200 kg cm(-2) (close to 200 atm), which is equivalent to 2000 m depth. Adults exhibited lower recovery times than nymphs after immersion at high hydrostatic pressure. Our findings show that lice have developed unique adaptations to endure extreme marine conditions.

article,Complexity in the timing of the first postnatal ecdysis in snakes,"Lillywhite, Harvey B. and Jacobson, Elliott R. and Sheehy, Coleman M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Lepidosaurian reptiles, particularly snakes, periodically shed the outer epidermal layers of their skin (ecdysis) to restore or enhance vital functions such as regulating water and gaseous exchange, growth, and protection against insult, infection or physical injury. Although many studies have focused on the nature and mechanisms of skin shedding, little attention has been paid to the timing of the first ecdysis in neonates following birth or hatching. A recent study investigated patterns of the time to first postnatal ecdysis in snakes based on a large dataset taken from the literature. The analysis demonstrated patterns in the time to first postnatal ecdysis related to phylogeny as well as several life history traits. While this assessment provides important advances in our knowledge of this topic, data on known biophysical drivers of ecdysis - temperature and humidity - were largely unavailable and were not evaluated. The first postnatal ecdysis of neonatal snakes can be viewed as an adaptive adjustment to the transition from the aqueous environment of the embryo to the aerial environment of the newborn. Hence, the timing of the first postnatal ecdysis is logically influenced by the aerial environment into which a newborn snake or hatchling finds itself. Therefore, in this Commentary, we first emphasize the putative plasticity of ecdysis with respect to epidermal lipids that structure the water permeability barrier and are established or renewed during ecdysis to reduce transepidermal evaporative water loss. We then discuss the likely importance of biophysical variables as influential covariates that need future investigation as potential co -determinants of the timing of first postnatal ecdysis.",2024,10.1242/jeb.247536,227,12,NA,jeb247536,Aqueous-to-aerial transition; Reptiles; Skin shedding; Transepidermal water loss; Temperature; Humidity

Water-fat MRI revealed that throughout the year this depot is composed of similar to 40\% lipid, similar to brown adipose tissue (BAT). During arousal from torpor, thermal images showed higher surface temperatures near this depot before the rest of the head warmed, suggesting a thermoregulatory function.

article,"Activity, not submergence, explains diving heart rates of captive loggerhead sea turtles","Williams, Cassondra L. and Sato, Katsufumi and Ponganis, Paul J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Marine turtles spend their life at sea and can rest on the seafloor for hours. As air-breathers, the breath-hold capacity of marine turtles is a function of oxygen (O-2) stores, O-2 consumption during dives and hypoxia tolerance. However, some physiological adaptations to diving observed in mammals are absent in marine turtles. This study examined cardiovascular responses in loggerhead sea turtles, which have even fewer adaptations to diving than other marine turtles, but can dive for extended durations. Heart rates (f(H)) of eight undisturbed loggerhead turtles in shallow tanks were measured using self-contained ECG data loggers under five conditions: spontaneous dives, resting motionless on the tank bottom, resting in shallow water with their head out of water, feeding on squid, and swimming at the surface between dives. There was no significant difference between resting f(H) while resting on the bottom of the tank, diving or resting in shallow water with their head out of water. f(H) rose as soon as turtles began to move and was highest between dives when turtles were swimming at the surface. These results suggest cardiovascular responses in captive loggerhead turtles are driven by activity and apneic f(H) is not reduced by submergence under these conditions.",2019,10.1242/jeb.200824,222,8,NA,jeb200824,ECG; Caretta caretta; Cardiovascular; Diving
article,Noise as an informational cue for decision-making: the sound of rain delays bat emergence,"Geipel, Inga and Smeekes, Marcus J. and Halfwerk, Wouter and Page, Rachel A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Background noise can have strong negative consequences for animals, reducing individual fitness by masking communication signals, impeding prey detection and increasing predation risk. While the negative impacts of noise across taxa have been well documented, the use of noise as an informational cue, providing animals with reliable information on environmental conditions, has been less well studied. In the tropical rainforest, downpours can be intense and frequent. Strong rainfall may impede efficient orientation and foraging for bats that need echolocation to both navigate and detect prey, and can result in higher flight costs due to increased metabolic rates. Using playback experiments at natural roosts, we tested whether two bat species, differing in their hunting strategies and foraging habitats, use rain noise as a cue to delay emergence from their roosts. We found that both species significantly delayed their emergence time during rain noise playbacks versus silence and ambient noise controls. We conclude that bats can use background noise, here the acoustic component of rainfall, as a reliable informational cue to make informed decisions, in this case about whether to initiate foraging trips or remain in the shelter of their roosts. Our findings suggest that environmental background noise can sometimes be beneficial to animals, in particular in situations where other sensory cues may be absent.",2019,10.1242/jeb.192005,222,3,NA,jeb192005,Acoustic signals; Environmental conditions; Foraging; Roost emergence; Echolocation; Micronycteris microtis; Molossus molossus

At the molecular level, we identified a Na+ channel and a Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) in the skin of N. obscura, where the NHE was up-regulated when acclimated to extremely low {[}Na+] (0.05 mmol l(-1), pH 5) conditions. Additionally, we found that leeches in dilute freshwater environments use both a vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (VHA)-assisted uptake via a Na+ channel and a NHE-based mechanisms for Na+ uptake. Immunolocalization of VHA and Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) indicated at least two cell types present within leech skin, VHA(+) and VHA-cells, where the VHA(+) cells are probably involved in Na+ uptake. NKA was present throughout the epithelium. We also found that increasing ammonia excretion by decreasing water pH, ammonia loading leeches or exposing leeches to high environmental ammonia does not affect Na+ uptake, providing indications that an NHE-Rh metabolon is not present and that ammonia excretion and Na+ uptake are not coupled in N. obscura. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing the mechanisms of Na+ uptake and their links to ammonia excretion in a freshwater invertebrate, where results suggest an ammonia-independent Na+ uptake mechanism relying on both Na+ channels and NHEs.",2017,10.1242/jeb.159459,220,18,3270-3279,NA,Rh-NHE metabolon; Rh proteins; H+-ATPase; Ammonia excretion; Freshwater; Osmoregulation

Alex and Petrov, Victor and Moore, Michael J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Attaching bio-telemetry or -logging devices ('tags') to marine animals for research and monitoring adds drag to streamlined bodies, thus affecting posture, swimming gaits and energy balance. These costs have never been measured in free-swimming cetaceans. To examine the effect of drag from a tag on metabolic rate, cost of transport and swimming behavior, four captive male dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) were trained to swim a set course, either non-tagged (n=7) or fitted with a tag (DTAG2; n=12), and surface exclusively in a flow-through respirometer in which oxygen consumption ((V) over dot(O2)) and carbon dioxide production ((V) over dot(O2); ml kg(-1) min(-1)) rates were measured and respiratory exchange ratio ((V) over dot(O2)/(V) over dot(O2)) was calculated. Tags did not significantly affect individual mass-specific oxygen consumption, physical activity ratios (exercise (V) over dot(O2)/resting (V) over dot(O2)), total or net cost of transport (COT; J m(-1) kg(-1)) or locomotor costs during swimming or two-minute recovery phases. However, individuals swam significantly slower when tagged (by similar to 11\%; mean +/- s.d., 3.31 +/- 0.35 m s(-1)) than when non-tagged (3.73 +/- 0.41 m s(-1)). A combined theoretical and computational fluid dynamics model estimating drag forces and power exertion during swimming suggests that drag loading and energy consumption are reduced at lower swimming speeds. Bottlenose dolphins in the specific swimming task in this experiment slowed to the point where the tag yielded no increases in drag or power, while showing no difference in metabolic parameters when instrumented with a DTAG2. These results, and our observations, suggest that animals modify their behavior to maintain metabolic output and energy expenditure when faced with tag-induced drag.",2014,10.1242/jeb.108225,217,23,4229-4236,NA,DTAG; Respirometry; Drag; Bio-logging; Transmitter; Cost of transport; Tagging

The Magadi tilapia is the only 100\% ureotelic teleost; it normally excretes no ammonia. This is interpreted as an evolutionary adaptation to overcome the near impossibility of sustaining an NH3 diffusion gradient across the gills against the high external pH. In standard ammoniotelic teleosts, branchial ammonia excretion is facilitated by Rh glycoproteins, and cortisol plays a role in upregulating these carriers, together with other components of a transport metabolon, so as to actively excrete ammonia during high environmental ammonia (HEA) exposure. In Magadi tilapia, we show that at least three Rh proteins (Rhag, Rhbg and Rhcg2) are expressed at the mRNA level in various tissues, and are recognized in the gills by specific antibodies. During HEA exposure, plasma ammonia levels and urea excretion rates increase markedly, and mRNA expression for the branchial urea transporter mtUT is elevated. Plasma cortisol increases and branchial mRNAs for Rhbg, Rhcg2 and Na+,K+-ATPase are all upregulated. Enzymatic activity of the latter is activated preferentially by NH4+ (versus K+), suggesting it can function as an NH4+-transporter.

article,Metabolic cost of thermoregulation decreases after the molt in developing Weddell seal pups,"Pearson, Linnea E. and Weitzner, Emma L. and Tomanek, Lars and Liwanag, Heather E. M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Allocation of energy to thermoregulation greatly contributes to the metabolic cost of endothermy, especially in extreme ambient conditions. Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii) pups born in Antarctica must survive both on ice and in water, two environments with very different thermal conductivities. This disparity likely requires pups to allocate additional energy toward thermoregulation rather than growth or development of swimming capabilities required for independent foraging. We measured longitudinal changes in resting metabolic rate (RMR) for Weddell seal pups (n=8) in air and water from one to seven weeks of age, using open-flow respirometry. Concurrently, we collected molt, morphometric and dive behavior data. Absolute metabolic rate (MR) in air followed the expected allometric relationship with mass. Absolute MR in water was not allometric with mass, despite a 3-fold increase in mass between one and seven weeks of age. Developmental stage (or molting stage), rather than calendar age, determined when pups were thermally capable of being in the water. We consistently observed post-molt pups had lower RMR in air and water (6.67 +/- 1.4 and 7.90 +/- 2.38 ml O-2 min(-1) kg(-1), respectively) than pre-molt (air: 9.37 +/- 2.42 ml O-2 min(-1) kg(-1), water: 13.40 +/- 3.46 ml O-2 min(-1) kg(-1)) and molting pups (air: 8.45 +/- 2.05 ml O-2 min(-1) kg(-1), water: 10.4 +/- 1.63 ml O-2 min(-1) kg(-1)). RMR in air and water were equivalent only for post-molt pups. Despite the increased energy cost, molting pups spent three times longer in the water than other pups. These results support the idea of an energetic trade-off during early development; pups expend more energy for thermoregulation in water, yet gain experience needed for independence.",2022,10.1242/jeb.242773,225,6,NA,jeb242773,Leptonychotes weddellii; Resting metabolic rate; Metabolism; Thermal development; Phocid; Antarctica
article,UV light perception is modulated by the odour element of an olfactory-visual compound in restrained honeybees,"Becker, Mira C. and Roessler, Wolfgang and Strube-Bloss, Martin Fritz",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Honeybees use visual and olfactory cues to detect flowers during foraging trips. Hence, the reward association of a nectar source is a multimodal construct which has at least two major components - olfactory and visual cues. How both sensory modalities are integrated to form a common reward association and whether and how they may interfere, is an open question. The present study used stimulation with UV, blue and green light to evoke distinct photoreceptor activities in the compound eye and two odour components (geraniol, citronellol). To test if a compound of both modalities is perceived as the sum of its elements (elemental processing) or as a unique cue (configural processing), we combined monochromatic light with single odour components in positive (PP) and negative patterning (NP) experiments. During PP, the compound of two modalities was rewarded, whereas the single elements were not. For NP, stimuli comprising a single modality were rewarded, whereas the olfactoryvisual compound was not. Furthermore, we compared the differentiation abilities between two light stimuli that were or were not part of an olfactory-visual compound. Interestingly, the behavioural performances revealed a prominent case of configural processing, but only in those cases when UV light was an element of an olfactoryvisual compound. Instead, learning with green-and blue-containing compounds rather supports elemental processing theory.",2019,10.1242/jeb.201483,222,10,NA,jeb201483,PER conditioning; Positive and negative patterning; Multimodal integration; Olfaction; Vision; Associative learning and memory

A long-standing assumption is that ambient temperature (T-a) largely defines the rate of energy expenditure because of well-known relationships between T-a, metabolic rate and frequency of arousal from torpor. Body condition and humidity also affect energy expenditure but are usually considered secondary factors. We held tricolored bats (Perimyotis subflavus) in captivity under multiple environmental conditions to directly compare the importance of T-a, fat mass and humidity for hibernation energy expenditure. Fat mass was the best predictor of female mass loss, followed by T-a and humidity. However, males had less fat and adopted a more energetically conservative hibernation strategy. Our results demonstrate that understanding the evolution of behavior, physiology and ecology of hibernation requires disentangling the relative contributions of multiple drivers of hibernation energetics, and that T-a is not always the most important factor driving energy expenditure.",2021,10.1242/jeb.239772,224,14,NA,jeb239772,Body composition; Torpor; Perimyotis subflavus; Potential evaporative water loss; Water vapor deficit; White-nose syndrome
article,"Respiratory function of the plastron in the aquatic bug <i>Aphelocheirus</i> <i>aestivalis</i> (Hemiptera, Aphelocheiridae)","Seymour, Roger S. and Jones, Karl K. and Hetz, Stefan K.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The river bug Aphelocheirus aestivalis is a 40 mg aquatic insect that, as an adult, relies totally on an incompressible physical gill to exchange respiratory gases with the water. The gill (called a `plastron') consists of a stationary layer of air held in place on the body surface by millions of tiny hairs that support a permanent air-water interface, so that the insect never has to renew the gas at the water's surface. The volume of air in the plastron is extremely small (0.14 mm(3)), under slightly negative pressure and connected to the gas-filled tracheal system through spiracles on the cuticle. Here, we measure P-O2 of the water and within the plastron gas with O-2-sensing fibre optics to understand the effectiveness and limitations of the gas exchanger. The difference in P-O2 is highest in stagnant water and decreases with increasing convection over the surface. Respiration of bugs in water-filled vials varies between 33 and 296 pmol O-2 s(-1), depending on swimming activity. The effective thickness of the boundary layer around the plastron was calculated from respiration rate, P-O2 difference and plastron surface area, according to the Fick diffusion equation and verified by direct measurements with the fibre-optic probes. In stagnant water, the boundary layer is approximately 500 mu m thick, which nevertheless can satisfy the demands of resting bugs, even if the P-O2 of the free water decreases to half that of air saturation. Active bugs require thinner boundary layers (similar to 100 mu m), which are achieved by living in moving water or by swimming.",2015,10.1242/jeb.125328,218,18,2840-2846,NA,Aquatic insect; Metabolic rate; Optode; Oxygen; Respiration; Spiracle; Tracheal system

We tested that idea by attaching accelerometers to the tails of free-ranging pelagic cormorants (Phalacrocorax pelagicus) and simultaneously estimating energy expenditure using doubly labelled water. Two different formulations of dynamic body acceleration, {[}vectorial and overall DBA (VeDBA and ODBA)], correlated with mass-specific energy expenditure (both R-2=0.91). VeDBA models combining and separately parameterizing flying, diving, activity on land and surface swimming were consistently considered more parsimonious than time budget models and showed less variability in model fit. Additionally, we observed evidence for the presence of hypometabolic processes (i.e. reduced heart rate and body temperature; shunting of blood away from non-essential organs) that suppressed metabolism in cormorants while diving, which was the most metabolically important activity. We concluded that a combination of VeDBA and physiological processes accurately measured energy expenditure for cormorants.",2016,10.1242/jeb.130526,219,14,2192-2200,NA,Doubly labelled water; Accelerometry; Field metabolic rate
article,An evolutionary solution of terrestrial isopods to cope with low atmospheric oxygen levels,"Horvathova, Terezia and Antol, Andrzej and Czarnoleski, Marcin and Kozlowski, Jan and Bauchinger, Ulf",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The evolution of current terrestrial life was founded by major waves of land invasion coinciding with high atmospheric oxygen content. These waves were followed by periods with substantially reduced oxygen concentration and accompanied by the evolution of novel traits. Reproduction and development are limiting factors for evolutionary water-land transitions, and brood care has probably facilitated land invasion. Peracarid crustaceans provide parental care for their offspring by brooding the early stages within the motherly brood pouch, the marsupium. Terrestrial isopod progeny begin ontogenetic development within the marsupium in water, but conclude development within the marsupium in air. Our results for progeny growth until hatching from the marsupium provide evidence for the limiting effects of oxygen concentration and for a potentially adaptive solution. Inclusion of air within the marsupium compensates for initially constrained growth in water through catch-up growth, and it may explain how terrestrial isopods adapted to short-and long-term changes in oxygen concentration.",2017,10.1242/jeb.156661,220,9,1563-1567,NA,Land invasion; Atmospheric oxygen concentration; Hypoxia; Catch-up growth; Progeny development; Brood care
article,Dehydrated snakes reduce postprandial thermophily,"Azzolini, Jill L. and Roderick, Travis B. and DeNardo, Dale F.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Transient thermophily in ectothermic animals is a common response during substantial physiological events. For example, ectotherms often elevate body temperature after ingesting a meal. In particular, the increase in metabolism during the postprandial response of pythons - known as specific dynamic action - is supported by a concurrent increase in preferred temperature. The objective of this study was to determine whether hydration state influences digestion-related behavioral thermophily. Sixteen (8 male and 8 female) Children's pythons (Antaresia childreni) with surgically implanted temperature data loggers were housed individually and provided with a thermal gradient of 25-45 degrees C. Body temperature was recorded hourly beginning 6 days prior to feeding and for 18 days post-feeding, thus covering pre-feeding, postprandial and post-absorptive stages. Each snake underwent this 24 day trial twice, once when hydrated and once when dehydrated. Our results revealed a significant interaction between temperature preference, digestive stage and hydration state. Under both hydrated and dehydrated conditions, snakes similarly increased their body temperature shortly after consuming a meal, but during the later days of the postprandial stage, snakes selected significantly lower (similar to 1.5 degrees C) body temperature when they were dehydrated compared with when they were hydrated. Our results demonstrate a significant effect of hydration state on postprandial thermophily, but the impact of this dehydration-induced temperature reduction on digestive physiology (e.g. passage time, energy assimilation) is unknown and warrants further study.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245925,226,15,NA,jeb245925,Antaresia; Digestion; Thermoregulation; Water balance; Pythons
article,"Acclimation to tidal conditions alters the physiological responses of the green shore crab, <i>Carcinus maenas</i>, to subsequent emersion","Nancollas, Sarah J. and McGaw, Iain J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Animals inhabiting the intertidal zone are exposed to abrupt changes in environmental conditions associated with the rise and fall of the tide. For convenience, the majority of laboratory studies on intertidal organisms have acclimated individuals to permanently submerged conditions in seawater tanks. In this study, green shore crabs, Carcinus maenas, were acclimated to either a simulated tidal regime of continuous emersion-immersion ('tidal') or to permanently submerged conditions ('non-tidal') to assess their physiological responses to subsequent emersion. Tidal crabs exhibited an endogenous rhythm of oxygen consumption during continuous submersion with lower oxygen consumption during periods of anticipated emersion, which was not detected in non-tidal crabs. During emersion. tidal crabs were able to buffer apparent changes in acid-base balance and exhibited no change in venous pH, whereas non-tidal crabs developed an acidosis associated with a rise in lactate levels. These results indicate that tidal crabs were better able to sustain aerobic metabolism and had lower metabolic costs during emersion than non-tidal crabs. It is likely that the elevated levels of haemocyanin exhibited by tidal crabs allowed them to maintain oxygen transport and buffer pH changes during emersion. This suggests that acclimation of C. maenas to submerged conditions results in a loss of important physiological mechanisms that enable it to tolerate emersion. The results of this study show that caution must be taken when acclimating intertidal organisms to submerged conditions in the laboratory, as it may abolish important physiological responses and adaptations that are critical to their performance when exposed to air.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242220,224,15,NA,jeb242220,Crustacean; Air exposure; Haemocyanin; Oxygen consumption; Acid-base balance; Emersion

The incubation behaviour and deposition of egg white antimicrobial proteins (AMPs) vary highly across the avian altricial-precocial spectrum. Experimental evidence of how these alterations in avian reproductive strategies affect the antimicrobial properties of the precocial and altricial egg interior is lacking, however. Here, we tested the egg white antimicrobial activity in eggs of two representative model species, from each end of the avian altricial-precocial spectrum, against potentially pathogenic and beneficial probiotic microorganisms. Eggs were experimentally treated to mimic un-incubated eggs in the nest, partial incubation during the egg-laying period, the onset of full incubation and the increased deposition of two main egg white AMPs, lysozyme and ovotransferrin. We moreover assessed to what extent egg antimicrobial components, egg white pH and AMP concentrations varied as a result of different incubation patterns. Fully incubated precocial and altricial eggs decreased their antimicrobial activity against a potentially pathogenic microorganism, whereas partial incubation significantly enhanced the persistence of a beneficial probiotic microorganism in precocial eggs. These effects were most probably conditioned by temperature-dependent alterations in egg white pH and AMP concentrations. While lysozyme concentration and pH decreased in fully incubated precocial but not altricial eggs, egg white ovotransferrin increased along with the intensity of incubation in both precocial and altricial eggs.

To fully understand how wild organisms are affected by stressors, it is crucial to understand the physiology that underlies an organism's response to a stressor. Prolonged levels of elevated glucocorticoids are associated with a state of chronic stress and decreased fitness. Exogenous glucocorticoid manipulation reduces an individual's ability to forage, avoid predators and grow, thereby limiting the resources available for physiological functions like defence against oxidative stress. Using brown trout (Salmo trutta), we evaluated the short-term (2 weeks) and long-term (4 months over winter) effects of exogenous cortisol manipulations (versus relevant shams and controls) on the oxidative status of wild juveniles. Cortisol caused an increase in glutathione over a 2 week period and appeared to reduce glutathione over winter. Cortisol treatment did not affect oxidative stress levels or low molecular weight antioxidants. Cortisol caused a significant decrease in growth rates but did not affect predation risk. Over-winter survival in the stream was associated with low levels of oxidative stress and glutathione. Thus, oxidative stress may be a mechanism by which elevated cortisol causes negative",2017,10.1242/jeb.155465,220,9,1693-1700,NA,Antioxidants; Salmo trutta; Glucocorticoids; Glutathione; Oxidative ecology; Reactive oxygen species

article,"Protective role of trehalose in the Namib desert ant, <i>Ocymyrmex robustior</i>","Perez, Remy and Aron, Serge",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Over recent decades, increasing attention has been paid to how low-molecular-weight molecules affect thermal tolerance in animals. Although the disaccharide sugar trehalose is known to serve as a thermal protectant in unicellular organisms, nothing is known about its potential role in insects. In this study, we investigated the effect of trehalose on heat tolerance in the Namib desert ant, Ocymyrmex robustior, one of the most thermotolerant animals found in terrestrial ecosystems. First, we tested whether a trehalose-supplemented diet increased worker survival following exposure to heat stress. Second, we assessed the degree of protein damage by comparing protein aggregation levels for trehalose-supplemented workers and control workers. Third, we compared the expression levels of three genes involved in trehalose metabolism. We found that trehalose supplementation significantly enhanced worker heat tolerance, increased metabolic levels of trehalose and reduced protein aggregation under conditions of heat stress. Expression levels of the three genes varied in a manner that was consistent with the maintenance of trehalose in the hemolymph and tissues under conditions of heat stress. Altogether, these results suggest that increased trehalose concentration may help protect Namib desert ant individuals against heat stress.

article,"Decreasing methane yield with increasing food intake keeps daily methane emissions constant in two foregut fermenting marsupials, the western grey kangaroo and red kangaroo","Vendl, Catharina and Clauss, Marcus and Stewart, Mathew and Leggett, Keith and Hummel, Juergen and Kreuzer, Michael and Munn, Adam",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Fundamental differences in methane (CH4) production between macropods (kangaroos) and ruminants have been suggested and linked to differences in the composition of the forestomach microbiome. Using six western grey kangaroos (Macropus fuliginosus) and four red kangaroos (Macropus rufus), we measured daily absolute CH4 production in vivo as well as CH4 yield (CH4 per unit of intake of dry matter, gross energy or digestible fibre) by open-circuit respirometry. Two food intake levels were tested using a chopped lucerne hay (alfalfa) diet. Bodymass-specific absoluteCH(4) production resembled values previously reported in wallabies and non-ruminant herbivores such as horses, and did not differ with food intake level, although there was no concomitant proportionate decrease in fibre digestibility with higher food intake. In contrast, CH4 yield decreased with increasing intake, and was intermediate between values reported for ruminants and non-ruminant herbivores. These results correspond to those in ruminants and other non-ruminant species where increased intake (and hence a shorter digesta retention in the gut) leads to a lower CH4 yield. We hypothesize that rather than harbouring a fundamentally different microbiome in their foregut, the microbiome of macropods is in a particular metabolic state more tuned towards growth (i.e. biomass production) rather than CH4 production. This is due to the short digesta retention time in macropods and the known distinct `digestawashing' in the gut of macropods, where fluids move faster than particles and hence most likely wash out microbes from the forestomach. Although our data suggest that kangaroos only produce about 27\% of the body mass-specific volume of CH4 of ruminants, it remains to be modelled with species-specific growth rates and production conditions whether or not significantly lower CH4 amounts are emitted per kg of meat in kangaroo than in beef or mutton production.",2015,10.1242/jeb.128165,218,21,3425-3434,NA,Macropod; CH4; Forestomach; Digesta washing; Digestion; Fermentation; Methanogenesis

The acquisition of tolerance to hypotonic stress during early life stages is presumed to be essential for their successful freshwater colonisation, but very little empirical evidence has been obtained to support this idea. This study aimed to comprehend the evolutionary changes in osmoregulatory mechanisms that enhance larval freshwater tolerance in amphidromous fishes, which typically spend their larval period in marine (ancestral) habitats and the rest of their life history stages in freshwater (derived) habitats. We compared the life history patterns and changes in larval survivorship and gene expression depending on salinity among three congeneric marine-originated amphidromous goby species (Gymnogobius), which had been suggested to differ in their larval dependence on freshwater habitats. An otolith microchemical analysis and laboratory-rearing experiment confirmed the presence of freshwater residents only in G. urotaenia and higher larval survivorship of this species in the freshwater condition than in the obligate amphidromous G. petschiliensis and G. opperiens. Larval wholebody transcriptome analysis revealed that G. urotaenia from both amphidromous and freshwater-resident populations exhibited the greatest differences in expression levels of several osmoregulatory genes, including aqp3, which is critical for water discharge from their body during early fish development. The present results consistently support the importance of enhanced freshwater tolerance and osmoregulatory plasticity in larval fish to establish freshwater forms, and further identified key candidate genes for larval freshwater adaptation and colonisation in the goby group.",2023,10.1242/jeb.246110,226,21,NA,jeb246110,Amphidromy; Freshwater resident; Life history evolution; Niche expansion; Osmoregulation; Transcriptome analysis
article,The sphingosine rheostat is involved in the cnidarian heat stress response but not necessarily in bleaching,"Kitchen, Sheila A. and Weis, Virginia M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Sphingolipids play important roles in mitigating cellular heat and oxidative stress by altering membrane fluidity, receptor clustering and gene expression. Accumulation of signaling sphingolipids that comprise the sphingosine rheostat, pro-apoptotic sphingosine (Sph) and pro-survival sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is key to determining cell fate. Reef-building corals and other symbiotic cnidarians living in shallow tropical waters can experience elevated seawater temperature and high UV irradiance, two stressors that are increasing in frequency and severity with climate change. In symbiotic cnidarians, these stressors disrupt the photosynthetic machinery of the endosymbiont and ultimately result in the collapse of the partnership (dysbiosis), known as cnidarian bleaching. In a previous study, exogenously applied sphingolipids altered heat-induced bleaching in the symbiotic anemone Aiptasia pallida, but endogenous regulation of these lipids is unknown. Here, we characterized the role of the rheostat in the cnidarian heat stress response (HSR) and in dysbiosis. Gene expression of rheostat enzymes sphingosine kinase (AP-SPHK) and S1P phosphatase (AP-SGPP), and concentrations of sphingolipids were quantified from anemones incubated at elevated temperatures. We observed a biphasic HSR in A. pallida. At early exposure, rheostat gene expression and lipid levels were suppressed while gene expression of a heat stress biomarker increased and 40\% of symbionts were lost. After longer incubations at the highest temperature, AP-SGPP and then Sph levels both increased.

article,"Measurement of oxygen consumption in <i>Tenebrio molitor</i> using a sensitive, inexpensive, sensor-based coulometric microrespirometer","Sandstrom, David J. and Offord, Bruce W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Coulometric respirometry is a highly sensitive method for measuring O-2 consumption in small organisms but it is not in widespread use among physiologists. Here, we describe a coulometric microrespirometer based on a digital environmental sensor inside a sealed glass chamber and controlled by an ArduinoT microcontroller. As O-2 is consumed, exhaled CO2 is removed, causing pressure to decrease in the chamber. The sensor detects the decreased pressure, and the controller activates electrolytic production of O-2, returning pressure to the initial value. O-2 consumption is calculated from electrolytic charge transfer. The effects of developmental stage, body mass and temperature on O-2 consumption of Tenebrio molitor beetles were easily measured by the apparatus. This straightforward design is a significant innovation in that it provides continuous data regarding environmental conditions inside the experimental chamber, can be fabricated easily, and is adaptable to a wide range of uses.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243966,225,9,NA,jeb243966,Beetle; Electrolytic; Insect; Metabolism; Microcontroller; Respirometry
article,Transparent anemone shrimp (<i>Ancylomenes pedersoni</i>) become opaque after exercise and physiological stress in correlation with increased hemolymph perfusion,"Bagge, Laura E. and Kinsey, Stephen T. and Gladman, Justin and Johnsen, Sonke",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Whole-body transparency, an effective camouflage strategy in many aquatic species, can be disrupted by environmental and/or physiological stressors. We found that tail-flip escape responses temporarily disrupt the transparency of the anemone shrimp Ancylomenes pedersoni. After as few as three tail flips, the previously transparent abdominal muscle became cloudy. Eliciting additional tail flips to the point of exhaustion (16 +/- 1 s.e.m.; n=23) resulted in complete opacity, though the original transparency returned after 20-60 min of inactivity. We hypothesized that an exercise-induced increase in blood volume between muscle fibers creates regions of low refractive index fluid between high refractive index muscles, thereby increasing light scattering. We documented pre- and post-contraction perfusion by injecting Alexa Fluor 594 wheat germ agglutinin that labeled sarcolemmal surfaces and endothelial cells in contact with hemolymph and found more hemolymph perfused through the abdominal tissue post-exercise, presumably owing to more capillaries opening. In addition, we altered salinity (to 55\% and 8\%), perforated the abdomen and injected a vasodilator. All three treatments increased both perfusion and opacity, lending further support to our hypothesis that increased hemolymph perfusion to the abdomen is one mechanism that can disrupt a shrimp's transparency. The fact that transparent shrimp at rest have little to no evidence of perfusion to their abdominal musculature (unlike the opaque shrimp Lysmata pederseni, which had more perfusion even at rest) indicates that they may experience significant physiological trade-offs in order to maintain their transparency; specifically, limiting blood flow and thereby reducing oxygen delivery may result in reduced performance.",2017,10.1242/jeb.162362,220,22,4225-4233,NA,Camouflage; Crustacean; Muscle; Light scattering

Better knowledge on composition of these mixtures, and on the mechanisms of individual CP interactions, could inspire development of laboratory CP formulations optimized for cryopreservation of cells and other biological material. Here, we identify and quantify (using high resolution mass spectrometry) a range of putative CPs in larval tissues of a subarctic fly, Chymomyza costata, which survives long-term cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen. The CPs proline, trehalose, glutamine, asparagine, glycine betaine, glycerophosphoethanolamine, glycerophosphocholine and sarcosine accumulate in hemolymph in a ratio of 313:108:55:26:6:4:2.9:0.5 mmol l(-1). Using calorimetry, we show that artificial mixtures, mimicking the concentrations of major CPs in hemolymph of freeze-tolerant larvae, suppress the melting point of water and significantly reduce the ice fraction. We demonstrate in a bioassay that mixtures of CPs administered through the diet act synergistically rather than additively to enable cryopreservation of otherwise freeze-sensitive larvae. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), we show that during slow extracellular freezing trehalose becomes concentrated in partially dehydrated hemolymph where it stimulates transition to the amorphous glass phase. In contrast, proline moves to the boundary between extracellular ice and dehydrated hemolymph and tissues where it probably forms a layer of dense viscoelastic liquid. We propose that amorphous glass and viscoelastic liquids may protect macromolecules and cells from thermomechanical shocks associated with freezing and transfer into and out of liquid nitrogen.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243934,225,8,NA,jeb243934,Freeze tolerance; Cryoprotection; Insects; Metabolites; Natural deep eutectic systems
article,A pathogenic skin fungus and sloughing exacerbate cutaneous water loss in amphibians,"Russo, Catherine J. M. and Ohmer, Michel E. B. and Cramp, Rebecca L. and Franklin, Craig E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is a pathogenic fungus that causes the cutaneous, infectious disease chytridiomycosis and has been implicated in population declines of numerous anuran species worldwide. Proximate cause of death by chytridiomycosis is asystolic cardiac arrest as a consequence of severe disruption to electrolyte balance. Animals heavily infected with Bd also experience a disruption to their skin sloughing regime, indicating that core functions of the skin, such as water retention, may be severely impacted. This study examined how skin sloughing, body size and Bd infection interact to influence water loss rates in five Australian frog species: Litoria caerulea, Limnodynastes peronii, Lechriodus fletcheri, Limnodynastes tasmaniensis and Platyplectrum ornatum. Rates of water loss more than doubled during sloughing in L. caerulea. During active periods across all species, water loss rates were on average 232\% higher in Bd infected frogs than in uninfected frogs. This indicates that dehydration stress may be a significant factor contributing to the morbidity of severely Bd infected anurans, a symptom that is then exacerbated by an increased rate of sloughing. When taking size into account, smaller and/or juvenile anurans may be more at risk from dehydration due to Bd infection, as they lose a greater amount of water and slough more frequently than adults. This may in part explain the higher mortality rates typical for small and juvenile frogs infected with Bd. Understanding how Bd affects the core functions of the skin, including rates of water loss, can improve our predictions of disease outcome in amphibians.",2018,10.1242/jeb.167445,221,9,NA,jeb167445,Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; Chytridiomycosis; Cutaneouswater loss; Dehydration; Fungal pathogen; Skin shedding

However, a recent reappraisal of the method showed that relationships between dynamic body acceleration (DBA) and energy expenditure weaken as the proportion of non-mechanical costs increases. Aquatic air breathing species often exemplify this pattern, as buoyancy, thermoregulation and other physiological mechanisms disproportionately affect oxygen consumption during dives. Combining biologging with the doubly labelled water method, we simultaneously recorded daily energy expenditure (DEE) and triaxial acceleration in one of the world's smallest wing-propelled breath-hold divers, the dovekie (Alle alle). These datawere used to estimate the activity-specific costs of flying and diving and to test whether overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) is a reliable predictor of DEE in this abundant seabird. Average DEE for chick-rearing dovekies was 604 +/- 119 kJ day(-1) across both sampling years. Despite recording lower stroke frequencies for diving than for flying (in line with allometric predictions for auks), dive costs were estimated to surpass flight costs in our sample of birds (flying: 7.24x basal metabolic rate, BMR; diving: 9.37x BMR). As expected, ODBA was not an effective predictor of DEE in this species. However, accelerometer-derived time budgets did accurately estimate DEE in dovekies. This work represents an empirical example of how the apparent energetic costs of buoyancy and thermoregulation limit the effectiveness of ODBA as the sole predictor of overall energy expenditure in small shallow-diving endotherms.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243252,225,12,NA,jeb243252,Accelerometer; Arctic; Ecology; Metabolism
article,A simple and affordable calorespirometer for assessing the metabolic rates of fishes,"Regan, M. D. and Gosline, J. M. and Richards, J. G.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Calorimetry is the measurement of the heat liberated during energy transformations in chemical reactions. When applied to living organisms, it measures the heat released due to the energy transformations associated with metabolism under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. This is in contrast to the often-used respirometric techniques for assessing energy turnover, which can only be used under fully aerobic conditions. Accordingly, calorimetry is considered the `gold standard' for quantifying metabolic rate, yet despite this, it remains a seldom-used technique among comparative physiologists. The reasons for this are related to the expense and perceived difficulty of the technique. We have designed and constructed an inexpensive flow-through calorespirometer capable of detecting rates of metabolic heat loss and oxygen consumption ((M) over dot(O2)) in fish under a variety of environmental conditions over long-term experiments. The metabolic heat of the fish is detected as a voltage by a collection of Peltier units wired in series, while oxygen optodes placed on the inflowing and outflowing water lines are used for the calculation of (M) over dot(O2). The apparatus is constructed in a differential fashion to account for ambient temperature fluctuations. This paper describes the design and construction of the calorespirometer for similar to\$1300 CDN. Using the goldfish (Carassius auratus auratus), we show that the calorespirometer is sensitive to changes in metabolic rate brought about by pharmacological manipulation and severe hypoxia exposures.",2013,10.1242/jeb.093500,216,24,4507-4513,NA,calorespirometry; calorimetry; fish; heat production; metabolism; respirometry

J. and van de Poll, Willem H. and Bininda-Emonds, Olaf R. P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Like other obligate asexuals, bdelloid rotifers are expected to suffer from degradation of their genomes through processes including the accumulation of deleterious mutations. However, sequence-based analyses in this regard remain inconclusive. Instead of looking for historical footprints of mutations in these ancient asexuals, we directly examined the susceptibility and ability to repair point mutations by the bdelloid Philodina roseola by inducing cyclobutane-pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) via exposure to UVB radiation (280-320 nm). For comparison, we performed analogous experiments with the facultative asexual monogonont rotifer Brachionus rubens. Different strategies were found for the two species. Philodina roseola appeared to shield itself from CPD induction through uncharacterized UV-absorbing compounds and, except for the genome reconstruction that occurs after desiccation, was largely unable to repair UVB-induced damage. By contrast, B. rubens was more susceptible to UVB irradiation, but could repair all induced damage in similar to 2 h. In addition, whereas UV irradiation had a significant negative impact on the reproductive output of P. roseola, and especially so after desiccation, that of B. rubens was unaffected. Although the strategy of P. roseola might suffice under natural conditions where UVB irradiation is less intense, the lack of any immediate CPD repair mechanisms in this species remains perplexing. It remains to be investigated how typical these results are for bdelloids as a group and therefore how reliant these animals are on desiccation-dependent genome repair to correct potential DNA damage given their obligate asexual lifestyle.",2013,10.1242/jeb.087064,216,16,3090-3095,NA,genome degradation; asexual reproduction; cyclobutane-pyrimidine dimers; genome repair; UV damage; bdelloid rotifer; desiccation tolerance; anhydrobiosis; deleterious mutations

We investigated the colour preference, learning and memory retention of Camponotus blandus foragers under controlled laboratory conditions. Our results show that C. blandus foragers exhibit a strong innate preference for ultraviolet (UV, 365 nm) over blue (450 nm) and green (528 nm) wavelengths. The ants can learn to discriminate 365 nm from either 528 nm or 450 nm, independent of intensity changes. However, they fail to discriminate between 450 nm and 528 nm. Modelling of putative colour spaces involving different numbers of photoreceptor types revealed that colour discrimination performance of individual ants is best explained by dichromacy, comprising a short-wavelength (UV) receptor with peak sensitivity at about 360 nm, and a long-wavelength receptor with peak sensitivity between 470 nm and 560 nm. Foragers trained to discriminate blue or green from UV light are able to retain the learned colour information in an early mid-term (e-MTM), late midterm (l-MTM), early long-term (e-LTM) and late long-term (l-LTM) memory from where it can be retrieved after 1 h, 12 h, 24 h, 3 days and 7 days after training, indicating that colour learning may induce different memory phases in ants.

article,The energetic costs of living in the surf and impacts on zonation of shells occupied by hermit crabs,"Alcaraz, Guillermina and Toledo, Brenda and Burciaga, Luis M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Crashing waves create a hydrodynamic gradient in which the most challenging effects occur at the wave breaking zone and decrease towards the upper protected tide pools. Hydrodynamic forces depend on the shape of the submerged body; streamlined shapes decrease drag forces compared with bluff or globose bodies. Unlike other animals, hermit crabs can choose their shell shape to cope with the effects of water flow. Hermit crabs occupy larger and heavier shells (conical shape) in wave-exposed sites than those used in protected areas (globose shape). First, we investigated whether a behavioral choice could explain the shells used in sites with different wave action. Then, we experimentally tested whether the shells most frequently used in sites with different wave action reduce the energetic cost of coping with water flow. Metabolic rate was measured using a respirometric system fitted with propellers in opposite walls to generate bidirectional water flow. The choice of shell size when a large array of sizes are available was consistent with the shell size used in different intertidal sites; hermit crabs chose heavier conical shells in water flow conditions than in still water, and the use of heavy conical shells reduced the energetic cost of coping with water motion. In contrast to conical shells, small globose shells imposed lower energy costs of withstanding water flow than large globose shells. The size and type of shells used in different zones of the rocky shore were consistent with an adaptive response to reduce the energetic costs of withstanding wave action.",2020,10.1242/jeb.222703,223,16,NA,jeb222703,Energetics; Gastropod shell; Hydrodynamics; Oxygen consumption; Waves; Intertidal

Meldrum and Hawryshyn, Craig W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Non-visual photoreceptors with diverse photopigments allow organisms to adapt to changing light conditions. Whereas visual photoreceptors are involved in image formation, non-visual photoreceptors mainly undertake various non-image-forming tasks. They form specialised photosensory systems that measure the quality and quantity of light and enable appropriate behavioural and physiological responses. Chromatophores are dermal non-visual photoreceptors directly exposed to light and they not only receive ambient photic input but also respond to it. These specialised photosensitive pigment cells enable animals to adjust body coloration to fit environments, and play an important role in mate choice, camouflage and ultraviolet (UV) protection. However, the signalling pathway underlying chromatophore photoresponses and the physiological importance of chromatophore colour change remain under-investigated. Here, we characterised the intrinsic photosensitive system of red chromatophores (erythrophores) in tilapia. Like some non-visual photoreceptors, tilapia erythrophores showed wavelength-dependent photoresponses in two spectral regions: aggregations of inner pigment granules under UV and short-wavelengths and dispersions under middle-and long-wavelengths. The action spectra curve suggested that two primary photopigments exert opposite effects on these light-driven processes: SWS1 (short-wavelength sensitive 1) for aggregations and RH2b (rhodopsin-like) for dispersions. Both western blot and immunohistochemistry showed SWS1 expression in integumentary tissues and erythrophores. The membrane potential of erythrophores depolarised under UV illumination, suggesting that changes in membrane potential are required for photoresponses. These results suggest that SWS1 and RH2b play key roles in mediating intrinsic erythrophore photoresponses in different spectral ranges and this chromatically dependent antagonistic photosensitive mechanism may provide an advantage to detect subtle environmental photic change.",2015,10.1242/jeb.106831,218,5,748-756,NA,Chromatophores; Opsins; Photoreceptors; Pigment cells; Visual pigments
article,Regional differences in the preferred e-vector orientation of honeybee ocellar photoreceptors,"Ogawa, Yuri and Ribi, Willi and Zeil, Jochen and Hemmi, Jan M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In addition to compound eyes, honeybees (Apis mellifera) possess three single-lens eyes called ocelli located on the top of the head. Ocelli are involved in head-attitude control and in some insects have been shown to provide celestial compass information. Anatomical and early electrophysiological studies have suggested that UV and blue-green photoreceptors in ocelli are polarization sensitive. However, their retinal distribution and receptor characteristics have not been documented. Here, we used intracellular electrophysiology to determine the relationship between the spectral and polarization sensitivity of the photoreceptors and their position within the visual field of the ocelli. We first determined a photoreceptor's spectral response through a series of monochromatic flashes (340-600 nm). We found UV and green receptors, with peak sensitivities at 360 and 500 nm, respectively. We subsequently measured polarization sensitivity at the photoreceptor's peak sensitivity wavelength by rotating a polarizer with monochromatic flashes. Polarization sensitivity (PS) values were significantly higher in UV receptors (3.8 +/- 1.5, N=61) than in green receptors (2.1 +/- 0.6, N=60). Interestingly, most receptors with receptive fields below 35 deg elevation were sensitive to vertically polarized light while the receptors with visual fields above 35 deg were sensitive to a wide range of polarization angles. These results agree well with anatomical measurements showing differences in rhabdom orientations between dorsal and ventral retinae. We discuss the functional significance of the distribution of polarization sensitivities across the visual field of ocelli by highlighting the information the ocelli are able to extract from the bee's visual environment.",2017,10.1242/jeb.156109,220,9,1701-1708,NA,Ocelli; Polarization vision; Retina fine structure

S. and Andree, Karl B. and Estevez, Alicia and Power, Deborah M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Fish are ectotherms and temperature plays a determinant role in their physiology, biology and ecology, and is a driver of seasonal responses. The present study assessed how thermal imprinting during embryonic and larval stages modified the response of adult fish to low water temperature. We targeted the gilthead sea bream, which develops a condition known as winter syndrome when it is exposed to low water temperatures. Eggs and larvae of sea bream were exposed to four different thermal regimes and then the response of the resulting adults to a low temperature challenge was assessed. Sea bream exposed to a high-low thermal regime as eggs and larvae (HLT; 22 degrees C until hatch and then 18 degrees C until larvae-juvenile transition) had increased plasma cortisol and lower sodium and potassium in response to a cold challenge compared with the other thermal history groups. Plasma glucose and osmolality were increased in cold-challenged HLT fish relative to the unchallenged HLT fish. Cold challenge modified bone homeostasis/responsiveness in the low-high thermal regime group (LHT) relative to other groups, and ocn, ogn1/2, igf1, gr and tr alpha/beta transcripts were all downregulated. In the low temperature group (LT) and HLT group challenged with a low temperature, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activities were decreased relative to unchallenged groups, and bone calcium content also decreased in the LT group.

Maintenance of K+ balance is particularly important due to its role in setting the cell membrane potential that is involved in many aspects of cellular function and viability. In most insects, K+ balance is maintained through secretion at the Malpighian tubules, which balances reabsorption from the hindgut and passive leak arising from the gut lumen. Here, we used the scanning ion-selective electrode technique (SIET) at benign (23 degrees C) and low (6 degrees C) temperatures to examine K+ flux across the Malpighian tubules and the rectal pads in the hindgut in five Drosophila species that differ in cold tolerance. We found that chill-tolerant species were better at maintaining K+ secretion and suppressing reabsorption during cold exposure. In contrast, chill-susceptible species exhibited large reductions in secretion with no change, or a paradoxical increase, in K+ reabsorption. Using an assay to measure paracellular leak, we found that chill-susceptible species experience a large increase in leak during cold exposure, which could explain the apparent increase in K+ reabsorption found in these species. Our data therefore strongly support the hypothesis that cold-tolerant Drosophila species are better at maintaining K+ homeostasis through an increased ability to maintain K+ secretion rates and through reduced movement of K+ towards the hemolymph. These adaptations are manifested both at the Malpighian tubule and at the rectal pads in the hindgut, and ensure that cold-tolerant species experience less perturbation of K+ homeostasis during cold stress.",2017,10.1242/jeb.168518,220,22,4261-4269,NA,Chill tolerance; Ion regulation; Hindgut; SIET; Paracellular leak

Using a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE)-based approach coupled with mass spectrometry, we found that climate change stressors did not affect metamorphosis except under OA, but altered the larval proteome and phosphorylation status. Metabolism and various stress and calcification-related proteins were downregulated in response to OA. In OA and HYP combined, HYP restored the expression of the calcification-related proteins to the control levels. We speculate that mild HYP stress could compensate for the negative effects of OA.

However, behavioral thermoregulation is also governed by interactions among physiological and ecological factors other than food availability, such as hydration state, and sometimes it can even conflict with the locomotor activity of animals. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of food intake and hydration state on behavioral thermoregulation and voluntary locomotor activity in the lizard Tropidurus catalanensis. We hypothesized that food intake can influence behavioral thermoregulation via an interaction with hydration state. We also hypothesized that lizards should endeavor to spend as little time as possible to reach their preferred body temperature to defend other physiological and/or ecological functions. We collected lizards in the field and brought them to the laboratory to measure the preferred temperature selected in a thermal gradient and the total distance traveled by them in fed and unfed conditions and with variable hydration state. Our results showed that food consumption was the most important predictor of preferred temperature. In contrast, either the hydration state alone or its interaction with food consumption did not have important effects on the lizards' thermal preference. Also, we found that the total distance traveled by lizards was not affected by food intake and was barely affected by the hydration state. We provide an experimental approach and a robust analysis of the factors that influence behavioral thermoregulation and locomotor activity in a tropical lizard.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242199,224,6,NA,jeb242199,Energy balance; Dehydration; Heat; Water balance; Tropiduridae

Here, we studied the transgenerational effects of sperm pre-fertilization thermal environment in a cold-adapted salmonid, the European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus). We used a full-factorial breeding design where the eggs of five females were fertilized with the milt of 10 males that had been pre-incubated at two different temperatures (3.5 degrees C and 6.5 degrees C) for 15 h prior to fertilization. Thermal manipulation did not affect sperm motility, cell size, fertilization success or embryo mortality. However, offspring that were fertilized with 6.5 degrees C-exposed milt were smaller and had poorer swimming performance than their full-siblings that had been fertilized with the 3.5 degrees C-exposed milt. Furthermore. the effect of milt treatment on embryo mortality varied among different females (treatmentxfemale interaction) and male-female combinations (treatmentxfemalexmale interaction). Together, these results indicate that sperm pre-fertilization thermal environment shapes offspring phenotype and post-hatching performance and modifies both the magnitude of female (dam) effects and the compatibility of the gametes. Generally, our results suggest that short-term changes in sperm thermal conditions may have negative impact for offspring fitness. Thus, sperm thermal environment may have an important role in determining the adaptation potential of organisms to climate change.

S. and Ratliff, J. J. and Langman, V. A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Gigantic size presents both opportunities and challenges in thermoregulation. Allometric scaling relationships suggest that gigantic animals have difficulty dissipating metabolic heat. Large body size permits the maintenance of fairly constant core body temperatures in ectothermic animals by means of gigantothermy. Conversely, gigantothermy combined with endothermic metabolic rate and activity likely results in heat production rates that exceed heat loss rates. In tropical environments, it has been suggested that a substantial rate of heat storage might result in a potentially lethal rise in core body temperature in both elephants and endothermic dinosaurs. However, the behavioral choice of nocturnal activity might reduce heat storage. We sought to test the hypothesis that there is a functionally significant relationship between heat storage and locomotion in Asian elephants (Elephas maximus), and model the thermoregulatory constraints on activity in elephants and a similarly sized migratory dinosaur, Edmontosaurus. Pre- and post-exercise (N=37 trials) measurements of core body temperature and skin temperature, using thermography were made in two adult female Asian elephants at the Audubon Zoo in New Orleans, LA, USA. Over ambient air temperatures ranging from 8 to 34.5 degrees C, when elephants exercised in full sun, similar to 56 to 100\% of active metabolic heat production was stored in core body tissues. We estimate that during nocturnal activity, in the absence of solar radiation, between 5 and 64\% of metabolic heat production would be stored in core tissues. Potentially lethal rates of heat storage in active elephants and Edmontosaurus could be behaviorally regulated by nocturnal activity.",2013,10.1242/jeb.076521,216,10,1774-1785,NA,elephants; gigantothermy; heat storage
article,The energetic cost of filtration by demosponges and their behavioural response to ambient currents,"Ludeman, Danielle A. and Reidenbach, Matthew A. and Leys, Sally P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Sponges (Porifera) are abundant in most marine and freshwater ecosystems, and as suspension feeders they play a crucial role in filtering the water column. Their active pumping enables them to filter up to 900 times their body volume of water per hour, recycling nutrients and coupling a pelagic food supply with benthic communities. Despite the ecological importance of sponge filter feeding, little is known about how sponges control the water flow through their canal system or how much energy it costs to filter the water. Sponges have long been considered textbook examples of animals that use current-induced flow. We provide evidence that suggests that some species of demosponge do not use currentinduced flow; rather, they respond behaviourally to increased ambient currents by reducing the volume of water filtered. Using a morphometric model of the canal system, we also show that filter feeding may be more energetically costly than previously thought. Measurements of volumetric flow rates and oxygen removal in five species of demosponge show that pumping rates are variable within and between species, with the more oxygen consumed the greater the volume filtered. Together, these data suggest that sponges have active control over the volume of water they process, which may be an adaptation to reduce the energetic cost of filtration in times of high stress.",2017,10.1242/jeb.146076,220,6,995-1007,NA,Porifera; Filter feeding; Passive flow; Current-induced flow; Oxygen; Energetic cost
article,"Metabolic rate scaling, ventilation patterns and respiratory water loss in red wood ants: activity drives ventilation changes, metabolic rate drives water loss","Perl, Craig D. and Niven, Jeremy E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Metabolic rate and its relationship with body size is a fundamental determinant of many life history traits and potentially of organismal fitness. Alongside various environmental and physiological factors, the metabolic rate of insects is linked to distinct ventilation patterns. Despite significant attention, however, the precise role of these ventilation patterns remains uncertain. Here, we determined the allometric scaling of metabolic rate and respiratory water loss in the red wood ant, as well as assessing the effect of movement upon metabolic rate and ventilation pattern. Metabolic rate and respiratory water loss are both negatively allometric. We observed both continuous and cyclic ventilation associated with relatively higher and lower metabolic rates, respectively. In wood ants, however, movement not metabolic rate is the primary determinant of which ventilation pattern is performed. Conversely, metabolic rate not ventilation pattern is the primary determinant of respiratory water loss. Our statistical models produced a range of relatively shallow intraspecific scaling exponents between 0.40 and 0.59, emphasising the dependency upon model structure. Previous investigations have revealed substantial variation in morphological allometry among wood ant workers from different nests within a population. Metabolic rate scaling does not exhibit the same variability, suggesting that these two forms of scaling respond to environmental factors in different ways.",2018,10.1242/jeb.182501,221,18,NA,jeb182501,Intraspecific scaling; Metabolic scaling; Cyclic ventilation; Continuous ventilation; Water loss; Allometry
article,Saving energy during hard times: energetic adaptations of Shetland pony mares,"Brinkmann, Lea and Gerken, Martina and Hambly, Catherine and Speakman, John R. and Riek, Alexander",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Recent results suggest that wild Northern herbivores reduce their metabolism during times of low ambient temperature and food shortage in order to reduce their energetic needs. It is, however, not known whether domesticated animals are also able to reduce their energy expenditure. We exposed 10 Shetland pony mares to different environmental conditions (summer and winter) and to two food quantities (60\% and 100\% of maintenance energy requirement) during low winter temperatures to examine energetic and behavioural responses. In summer, ponies showed a considerably higher field metabolic rate (FMR; 63.4 +/- 15.0 MJ day(-1)) compared with food-restricted and control animals in winter (24.6 +/- 7.8 and 15.0 +/- 1.1 MJ day(-1), respectively). During summer, locomotor activity, resting heart rate and total water turnover were considerably elevated (P<0.001) compared with winter. Animals on a restricted diet (N=5) compensated for the decreased energy supply by reducing their FMR by 26\% compared with control animals (N=5). Furthermore, resting heart rate, body mass and body condition score were lower (29.2 +/- 2.7 beats min(-1), 140 +/- 22 kg and 3.0 +/- 1.0 points, respectively) than in control animals (36.8 +/- 41 beats min(-1), 165 +/- 31 kg, 4.4 +/- 0.7 points; P<0.05). While the observed behaviour did not change, nocturnal hypothermia was elevated. We conclude that ponies acclimatize to different climatic conditions by changing their metabolic rate, behaviour and some physiological parameters. When exposed to energy challenges, ponies, like wild herbivores, exhibited hypometabolism and nocturnal hypothermia.",2014,10.1242/jeb.111815,217,24,4320-4327,NA,Body temperature; Energy expenditure; Food restriction; Field metabolic rate; Hypometabolism; Locomotor activity; Seasonal changes
article,Elevated temperature causes metabolic trade-offs at the whole-organism level in the Antarctic fish <i>Trematomus bernacchii</i>,"Sandersfeld, Tina and Davison, William and Lamare, Miles D. and Knust, Rainer and Richter, Claudio",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"As a response to ocean warming, shifts in fish species distribution and changes in production have been reported that have been partly attributed to temperature effects on the physiology of animals. The Southern Ocean hosts some of the most rapidly warming regions on earth and Antarctic organisms are reported to be especially temperature sensitive. While cellular and molecular organismic levels appear, at least partially, to compensate for elevated temperatures, the consequences of acclimation to elevated temperature for the whole organism are often less clear. Growth and reproduction are the driving factors for population structure and abundance. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of long-term acclimation to elevated temperature on energy budget parameters in the high-Antarctic fish Trematomus bernacchii. Our results show a complete temperature compensation for routine metabolic costs after 9 weeks of acclimation to 4 degrees C. However, an up to 84\% reduction in mass growth was measured at 2 and 4 degrees C compared with the control group at 0 degrees C, which is best explained by reduced food assimilation rates at warmer temperatures. With regard to a predicted temperature increase of up to 1.4 degrees C in the Ross Sea by 2200, such a significant reduction in growth is likely to affect population structures in nature, for example by delaying sexual maturity and reducing production, with severe impacts on Antarctic fish communities and ecosystems.",2015,10.1242/jeb.122804,218,15,2373-2381,NA,Antarctica; Climate change; Teleost; Energy budget; Growth; Production; Thermal tolerance
article,Mortality from desiccation contributes to a genotype-temperature interaction for cold survival in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>,"Kobey, Robert L. and Montooth, Kristi L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Survival at cold temperatures is a complex trait, primarily because of the fact that the physiological cause of injury may differ across degrees of cold exposure experienced within the lifetime of an ectothermic individual. In order to better understand how chill-sensitive insects experience and adapt to low temperatures, we investigated the physiological basis for cold survival across a range of temperature exposures from -4 to 6 degrees C in five genetic lines of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Genetic effects on cold survival were temperature dependent and resulted in a significant genotype-temperature interaction for survival across cold temperature exposures that differ by as little as 2 degrees C. We investigated desiccation as a potential mechanism of injury across these temperature exposures. Flies were dehydrated following exposures near 6 degrees C, whereas flies were not dehydrated following exposures near -4 degrees C. Furthermore, decreasing humidity during cold exposure decreased survival, and increasing humidity during cold exposure increased survival at 6 degrees C, but not at -4 degrees C. These results support the conclusion that in D. melanogaster there are multiple physiological mechanisms of cold-induced mortality across relatively small differences in temperature, and that desiccation contributes to mortality for exposures near 6 degrees C but not for subzero temperatures. Because D. melanogaster has recently expanded its range from tropical to temperate latitudes, the complex physiologies underlying cold tolerance are likely to be important traits in the recent evolutionary history of this fruit fly.",2013,10.1242/jeb.076539,216,7,1174-1182,NA,Drosophila melanogaster; cold survival; cold tolerance; desiccation; gene-environment interaction

Given that plasma-accessible carbonic anhydrase (CA) in red muscle of rainbow trout has recently been shown to facilitate oxygen unloading from arterial blood under certain physiological conditions, we tested the hypothesis that plasma-accessible CA is present in the lumen of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) hearts, and may therefore assist in the luminal oxygen supply to the spongy myocardium, which has no coronary circulation. We demonstrate a widespread distribution of CA throughout the heart chambers, including lumen-facing cells in the atrium, and confirm that the membrane-bound isoform ca4 is expressed in the atrium and ventricle of the heart. Further, we confirm thatCA catalytic activity is available to blood in the atrial lumen using a modified electrometric.pH assay in intact atria in combination with either a membrane-impermeable CA inhibitor or specific cleavage of the Ca4 membrane anchor. Combined, these results support our hypothesis of the presence of an enhanced oxygen delivery system in the lumen of a salmonid heart, which could help support oxygen delivery when the oxygen content of venous blood becomes greatly reduced, such as after burst exercise and during environmental hypoxia.",2016,10.1242/jeb.130443,219,5,719-724,NA,Membrane-bound CA; Cardiac tissue; CA4; Oncorhynchus; Teleost; Root effect
article,Developmental changes in hypoxic exposure and responses to anoxia in <i>Drosophila</i> <i>melanogaster</i>,"Callier, Viviane and Hand, Steven C. and Campbell, Jacob B. and Biddulph, Taylor and Harrison, Jon F.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Holometabolous insects undergo dramatic morphological and physiological changes during ontogeny. In particular, the larvae of many holometabolous insects are specialized to feed in soil, water or dung, inside plant structures, or inside other organisms as parasites where they may commonly experience hypoxia or anoxia. In contrast, holometabolous adults usually are winged and live with access to air. Here, we show that larval Drosophila melanogaster experience severe hypoxia in their normal laboratory environments; third instar larvae feed by tunneling into a medium without usable oxygen. Larvae move strongly in anoxia for many minutes, while adults (like most other adult insects) are quickly paralyzed. Adults survive anoxia nearly an order of magnitude longer than larvae (LT50: 8.3 versus 1 h). Plausibly, the paralysis of adults is a programmed response to reduce ATP need and enhance survival. In support of that hypothesis, larvae produce lactate at 3x greater rates than adults in anoxia. However, when immobile in anoxia, larvae and adults are similarly able to decrease their metabolic rate, to about 3\% of normoxic conditions. These data suggest that Drosophila larvae and adults have been differentially selected for behavioral and metabolic responses to anoxia, with larvae exhibiting vigorous escape behavior likely enabling release from viscous anoxic media to predictably normoxic air, while the paralysis behavior of adults maximizes their chances of surviving flooding events of unpredictable duration. Developmental remodeling of behavioral and metabolic strategies to hypoxia/anoxia is a previously unrecognized major attribute of holometabolism.",2015,10.1242/jeb.125849,218,18,2927-2934,NA,Ontogeny; P-O2; Holometabolism; Metabolism
article,Adjustments in the control of mitochondrial respiratory capacity to tolerate temperature fluctuations,"Scott, Katrina Y. and Matthew, Rebecca and Woolcock, Jennifer and Silva, Maise and Lemieux, Helene",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"As the world's climate changes, life faces an evolving thermal environment. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is critical to ensure sufficient cellular energy production, and it is strongly influenced by temperature. The thermally induced changes to the regulation of specific steps within the OXPHOS process are poorly understood. In our study, we used the eurythermal species of planarian Dugesia tigrina to study the thermal sensitivity of the OXPHOS process at 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C. We conducted cold acclimation experiments where we measured the adjustment of specific steps in OXPHOS at two assay temperatures (10 and 20 degrees C) following 4 weeks of acclimation under normal (22 degrees C) or low (5 degrees C) temperature conditions. At the low temperature, the contribution of the NADH pathway to the maximal OXPHOS capacity, in a combined pathway (NADH and succinate), was reduced. There was partial compensation by an increased contribution of the succinate pathway. As the temperature decreased, OXPHOS became more limited by the capacity of the phosphorylation system. Acclimation to the low temperature resulted in positive adjustments of the NADH pathway capacity due, at least in part, to an increase in complex I activity. The acclimation also resulted in a better match between OXPHOS and phosphorylation system capacities. Both of these adjustments following acclimation were specific to the low assay temperature. We conclude that there is substantial plasticity in the mitochondrial OXPHOS process following thermal acclimation in D. tigrina, and this probably contributes to the wide thermal range of the species.",2019,10.1242/jeb.207951,222,18,NA,jeb207951,Mitochondrial respiration; Oxidative phosphorylation; Thermal sensitivity; Cold acclimation; Control; Regulation; Complex I; Phosphorylation system; Dugesia tigrina
article,The effect of water temperature and flow on respiration in barnacles: patterns of mass transfer versus kinetic limitation,"Nishizaki, Michael T. and Carrington, Emily",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In aquatic systems, physiological processes such as respiration, photosynthesis and calcification are potentially limited by the exchange of dissolved materials between organisms and their environment. The nature and extent of physiological limitation is, therefore, likely to be dependent on environmental conditions. Here, we assessed the metabolic sensitivity of barnacles under a range of water temperatures and velocities, two factors that influence their distribution. Respiration rates increased in response to changes in temperature and flow, with an interaction where flow had less influence on respiration at low temperatures, and a much larger effect at high temperatures. Model analysis suggested that respiration is mass transfer limited under conditions of low velocity (<7.5 cm(-1)) and high temperature (20-25 degrees C). In contrast, limitation by uptake reaction kinetics, when the biotic capacity of barnacles to absorb and process oxygen is slower than its physical delivery by mass transport, prevailed at high flows (40-150 cm s(-1)) and low temperatures (5-15 degrees C). Moreover, there are intermediate flow-temperature conditions where both mass transfer and kinetic limitation are important. Behavioral monitoring revealed that barnacles fully extend their cirral appendages at low flows and display abbreviated `testing' behaviors at high flows, suggesting some form of mechanical limitation. In low flow-high temperature treatments, however, barnacles displayed distinct `pumping' behaviors that may serve to increase ventilation. Our results suggest that in slow-moving waters, respiration may become mass transfer limited as temperatures rise, whereas faster flows may serve to ameliorate the effects of elevated temperatures. Moreover, these results underscore the necessity for approaches that evaluate the combined effects of multiple environmental factors when examining physiological and behavioral performance.",2014,10.1242/jeb.101030,217,12,2101-2109,NA,Barnacles; Intertidal; Respiration; Thermal stress; Mass transfer limitation
article,Thermal physiology of the fingered limpet <i>Lottia digitalis</i> under emersion and immersion,"Bjelde, Brittany E. and Todgham, Anne E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Marine animals living high in the rocky intertidal zone experience long durations of aerial emersion, sometimes enduring rapid increases in temperature. To date, much of our understanding of the thermal physiology of intertidal organisms comes from studies in which organisms are exposed to increasing temperatures when immersed, with the added effect of aerial emersion rarely considered. In this study, we examined the physiological response of the finger limpet, Lottia digitalis, to increases in temperature under both immersed and emersed conditions. We investigated the thermal sensitivity and upper temperature tolerance of limpets through assessment of cardiac performance, metabolic rate, glycogen depletion and maintenance of protein integrity. Cardiac performance in response to ecologically relevant increases in temperature was similar in emersed and immersed limpets from 15 to 35 degrees C and showed multiple break patterns in heart rate as temperature was increased. Overall, emersed limpets had a greater upper thermal limit on cardiac performance, with the ability to maintain heart rate at a temperature 3-5 degrees C higher than that for immersed limpets. Metabolism in limpets also differed significantly between emersion and immersion, where a significant depression in aerobic metabolic rate was observed under immersion with increasing temperature. Greater levels of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins were found under emersed conditions compared with immersed limpets. Maintaining cardiac performance and aerobic metabolism to higher temperatures under emersed conditions is likely reflective of physiological adaptations to live in an aerially exposed environment. Measured field temperatures where fingered limpets were collected demonstrated that limpets have a narrow thermal safety margin for aerobic performance, and currently experience multiple days where summer temperatures might exceed their threshold limits.",2013,10.1242/jeb.084178,216,15,2858-2869,NA,intertidal; stress tolerance; temperature; ecophysiology; gastropod

Previous laboratory observations of Japanese flying squid (Todarodes pacificus) suggest that prespawning females might rest on the continental shelf or slope before they ascend above the pycnocline to spawn, and that the egg masses might settle in the pycnocline. Here, two mesocosm experiments were conducted in a 300 m(3) tank that was 6 m deep to investigate this hypothesis. In the first experiment, a thermocline (2.5-3.5 m) was established in the tank by creating a thermally stratified (17-22 degrees C) water column. In the second experiment, the temperature was uniform (22 degrees C) at all depths. Prior to spawning, females did not rest on the tank floor. In the stratified water column, egg masses remained suspended in the thermocline, but in an unstratified water column, they settled on the tank bottom, collapsed and were infested by microbes, resulting in abnormal or nonviable embryos. Eleven females spawned a total of 18 egg masses (17-80 cm in diameter), indicating that females can spawn more than once when under stress. Paralarvae hatched at stage 30/31 and survived for up to 10 days, allowing us to observe the most advanced stage of paralarvae in captivity.

article,Metabolic reduction after long-duration flight is not related to fat-free mass loss or flight duration in a migratory passerine,"Gerson, Alexander R. and DeSimone, Joely G. and Black, Elizabeth C. and Dick, Morag F. and Groom, Derrick J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Migratory birds catabolize large quantities of protein during long flights, resulting in dramatic reductions in organ and muscle mass. One of the many hypotheses to explain this phenomenon is that decrease in lean mass is associated with reduced resting metabolism, saving energy after flight during refueling. However, the relationship between lean body mass and resting metabolic rate remains unclear. Furthermore, the coupling of lean mass with resting metabolic rate and with peak metabolic rate before and after long-duration flight have not previously been explored. We flew migratory yellow-rumped warblers (Setophaga coronata) in a wind tunnel under one of two humidity regimes to manipulate the rate of lean mass loss in flight, decoupling flight duration from total lean mass loss. Before and after long-duration flights, we measured resting and peak metabolism, and also measured fat mass and lean body mass using quantitative magnetic resonance. Flight duration ranged from 28 min to 600 min, and birds flying under dehydrating conditions lost more fat-free mass than those flying under humid conditions. After flight, there was a 14\% reduction in resting metabolism but no change in peak metabolism. Interestingly, the reduction in resting metabolism was unrelated to flight duration or to change in fat-free body mass, indicating that protein metabolism in flight is unlikely to have evolved as an energy-saving measure to aid stopover refueling, but metabolic reduction itself is likely to be beneficial to migratory birds arriving in novel habitats.",2020,10.1242/jeb.215384,223,19,NA,jeb215384,Avian migration; Basal metabolic rate; Peak metabolic rate; Metabolic scope; Flight
article,Gas exchange and dive characteristics of the free-swimming backswimmer <i>Anisops deanei</i>,"Jones, Karl K. and Snelling, Edward P. and Watson, Amy P. and Seymour, Roger S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Many aquatic insects utilise air bubbles on the surface of their bodies to supply O-2 while they dive. The bubbles can simply store O-2, as in the case of an `air store', or they can act as a physical `gas gill', extracting O-2 from the water. Backswimmers of the genus Anisops augment their air store with O-2 from haemoglobin cells located in the abdomen. The O-2 release from the haemoglobin helps stabilise bubble volume, enabling backswimmers to remain near neutrally buoyant for a period of the dive. It is generally assumed that the backswimmer air store does not act as a gas gill and that gas exchange with the water is negligible. This study combines measurements of dive characteristics under different exotic gases (N-2, He, SF6, CO) with mathematical modelling, to show that the air store of the backswimmer Anisops deanei does exchange gases with the water. Our results indicate that approximately 20\% of O-2 consumed during a dive is obtained directly from the water. Oxygen from the water complements that released from the haemoglobin, extending the period of near-neutral buoyancy and increasing dive duration.",2015,10.1242/jeb.125047,218,21,3478-3486,NA,Aquatic insect; Air store; Buoyancy; Exotic gases; Gas exchange
article,Hemolymph metabolites and osmolality are tightly linked to cold tolerance of <i>Drosophila</i> species: a comparative study,"Olsson, Trine and MacMillan, Heath A. and Nyberg, Nils and Staerk, Dan and Malmendal, Anders and Overgaard, Johannes",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Drosophila, like most insects, are susceptible to low temperatures, and will succumb to temperatures above the freezing point of their hemolymph. For these insects, cold exposure causes a loss of extracellular ion and water homeostasis, leading to chill injury and eventually death. Chill-tolerant species are characterized by lower hemolymph {[}Na+] than chill-susceptible species and this lowered hemolymph {[}Na+] is suggested to improve ion and water homeostasis during cold exposure. It has therefore also been hypothesized that hemolymph Na+ is replaced by other `cryoprotective' osmolytes in cold-tolerant species. Here, we compared the hemolymph metabolite profiles of five drosophilid species with marked differences in chill tolerance. All species were examined under `normal' thermal conditions (i.e. 20 degrees C) and following cold exposure (4 h at 0 degrees C). Under benign conditions, total hemolymph osmolality was similar among all species despite chill-tolerant species having lower hemolymph [}Na+]. Using NMR spectroscopy, we found that chill-tolerant species instead have higher levels of sugars and free amino acids in their hemolymph, including classical `cryoprotectants' such as trehalose and proline. In addition, we found that chill-tolerant species maintain a relatively stable hemolymph osmolality and metabolite profile when exposed to cold stress while sensitive species suffer from large increases in osmolality and massive changes in their metabolic profiles during a cold stress. We suggest that the larger contribution of classical cryoprotectants in chill-tolerant Drosophila plays a non-colligative role for cold tolerance that contributes to osmotic and ion homeostasis during cold exposure and, in addition, we discuss how these comparative differences may represent an evolutionary pathway toward more extreme cold tolerance of insects.",2016,10.1242/jeb.140152,219,16,2504-2513,NA,Insect; Chill tolerance; Osmotic balance; Membrane potential; Chill injury; NMR; Metabolomics

Both standard metabolic rate and active metabolic rate continued to increase with temperature, which resulted in an aerobic scope that also increased with temperature, but was statistically similar between 13, 18 and 23 degrees C. The critical swimming speed peaked at 18 degrees C (93.1 +/- 1.2 cm s(-1)), and decreased significantly at the extreme temperatures to 74.8 +/- 0.5 and 84.8 +/- 1.6 cm s(-1) at 3 and 23 degrees C, respectively. At 23 degrees C, the accumulated mortality reached 20\% over 4 weeks, while no fish died during acclimation at colder temperatures. Furthermore, fish at 23 degrees C had poor appetite and lower condition factor despite still having a high aerobic scope, suggesting that oxygen uptake was not the limiting factor in the upper thermal niche boundary. In conclusion, Atlantic salmon were able to maintain a high aerobic capacity and good swimming capabilities throughout the entire thermal interval tested, thus demonstrating a high level of flexibility in respiratory capacity towards different temperature exposures.",2017,10.1242/jeb.154021,220,15,2757-2764,NA,U-crit; Respirometry; Scope for activity; Temperature

In agreement with our recent findings in Drosophila melanogaster, we show that the surface of these insects is regionalised. We also show that, in contrast to the single barrier in D. melanogaster, two barriers with distinct temperature-sensitive and lipid-based physico-chemical material properties act in parallel to protect these insects against penetration of hydrophilic molecules.

article,Strategies of ionoregulation in the freshwater nymph of the mayfly <i>Hexagenia rigida</i>,"Nowghani, Fargol and Jonusaite, Sima and Watson-Leung, Trudy and Donini, Andrew and Kelly, Scott P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"This study investigated ionoregulatory strategies used by freshwater (FW) nymphs of the mayfly Hexagenia rigida. Like other FW organisms, H. rigida nymphs maintain hemolymph ion levels (in mmol l(-1): Na+ similar to 102; Cl- similar to 84; K+ similar to 6; pH similar to 7.35) far in excess of their surroundings. This appears to be accomplished by the combined actions of the alimentary canal, Malpighian tubules (MTs) and tracheal gills. The alimentary canal contributes in a region-specific manner, a view supported by: (1) spatial differences in the activity of basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) and apical V-type H+-ATPase (VA) and (2) region-specific Na+ and K+ flux rates. Both indicate a prominent role for the hindgut (rectum) in K+ reabsorption. MTs also exhibit region-specific differences in Na+ and K+ flux rates that are coupled with an organized but tortuous architecture. NKA and VA activities were highest in MTs versus all other organs examined. Tracheal gills were found to be sites of Na+ uptake, but no difference in Na+ uptake was found between gills taken from different regions of the abdomen or spatially along individual gills. This is likely because each gill exhibited a dense population of NKA and/or VA immunoreactive cells (putative ionocytes). Data provide new insight into how FW mayfly nymphs regulate salt and water balance using the alimentary canal, MTs and tracheal gills as well as the first direct evidence that tracheal gills acquire ions from FW.",2017,10.1242/jeb.166132,220,21,3997-4006,NA,Na+/K+-ATPase; V-type H+-ATPase; Rectum; Gill; Gastrointestinal tract; Malpighian tubule
article,"Body temperature stability in the whale shark, the world's largest fish","Nakamura, Itsumi and Matsumoto, Rui and Sato, Katsufumi",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"It is generally assumed that the body temperature of large animals is less likely to change because of their large body size, resulting in a high thermal inertia and a smaller surface area to volume ratio. The goal of this study was to investigate the stability of body temperature in large fish using data from field experiments. We measured the muscle temperatures of free-ranging whale sharks (Rhincodon typus), the largest extant fish globally, and investigated their ectothermic physiology and the stability of their body temperature. The muscle temperature changed substantially more slowly than the water temperature fluctuations associated with vertical movements, and the whole-body heat-transfer coefficients (HTCs) of whale sharks estimated using heat-budget models were lower than those of any other fish species measured to date. The heat-budget models also showed that internal heat production does not contribute to changes in muscle temperature. A comparative analysis showed that the HTC at cooling in various fish species including both ectothermic and endothermic species ranging from 10(-4) to 10(3) kg was proportional to body mass(-0.63). This allometry was present regardless of whether the fish were ectothermic or endothermic, and was an extension of the relationship observed in previous studies on small fish. Thus, large fish have the advantage of body temperature stability while moving in environments with large temperature variations. Our results suggest that the large body size of whale sharks aids in preventing a decrease in body temperature during deep excursions to more than 1000 m depths without high metabolic costs of producing heat.",2020,10.1242/jeb.210286,223,11,NA,jeb210286,Whale shark; Body temperature; Ectotherm; Thermoregulation; Allometry

Apart from finding favourable foraging sites, they have to develop effective prey search patterns as well as physiological capacities that enable them to capture sufficient prey to meet their energetic needs. To investigate the ontogeny of their thermoregulatory responses at sea, we implanted 30 juvenile king penguins and 8 adult breeders with a small data logger that recorded pressure and subcutaneous temperature continuously for up to 2.5 years. We found important changes in the development of peripheral temperature patterns of foraging juvenile king penguins throughout their first year at sea. Peripheral temperature during foraging bouts fell to increasingly lower levels during the first 6 months at sea, after which it stabilized. Most importantly, these changes re-occurred during their second year at sea, after birds had fasted for similar to 4 weeks on land during their second moult. Furthermore, similar peripheral temperature patterns were also present in adult birds during foraging trips throughout their breeding cycle. We suggest that rather than being a simple consequence of concurrent changes in dive effort or an indication of a physiological maturation process, these seasonal temperature changes mainly reflect differences in thermal insulation. Heat loss estimates for juveniles at sea were initially high but declined to approximately half after similar to 6 months at sea, suggesting that juvenile king penguins face a strong energetic challenge during their early oceanic existence.",2017,10.1242/jeb.160143,220,14,2666-2678,NA,Thermoregulation; Peripheral temperature; Subcutaneous fat; Vasoconstriction; Diving; Seabirds

To test this, we acclimated fish to: (1) non-stochastic and (2) stochastic thermal fluctuations with a similar thermal load (27-35 degrees C), and (3) a stable/ consistent control temperature at the low end of the cycle (27 degrees C). We determined that fecundity was reduced in both cycles, with reproduction ceasing in stochastic thermal environments. Fish acclimated to non-stochastic thermal cycles had growth rates lower than those of control fish. Exposure to warm, fluctuating cycles did not affect emersion temperature, and only regular diel cycles modestly increased critical thermal tolerance. We predicted that warm diel cycling temperatures would increase gill surface area. Notably, fish acclimated to either thermal cycle had a reduced gill surface area and increased intralamellar cell mass when compared with control fish. This decreased gill surface area with warming contrasts with what is observed for exclusively aquatic fish and suggests a preparatory gill response for emersion in these amphibious fish. Collectively, our data reveal the importance of considering stochastic thermal variability when studying the effects of temperature on fishes.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246726,227,14,NA,jeb246726,Diel thermal cycle; Climate warming; ILCM; Gill remodelling; Amphibious fish; Thermal tolerance
article,Cross-species gut microbiota transplantation predictably affects host heat tolerance,"Dallas, Jason W. and Kazarina, Anna and Lee, Sonny T. M. and Warne, Robin W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The gut microbiome is known to influence and have regulatory effects in diverse physiological functions of host animals, but only recently has the relationship between host thermal biology and gut microbiota been explored. Here, we examined how early-life manipulations of the gut microbiota in larval amphibians influenced their critical thermal maximum (CTmax) at different acclimation temperatures. We stripped the resident microbiome from egg masses of wild-caught wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus) via an antibiotic wash, and then inoculated the eggs with pond water (control), no inoculation, or the intestinal microbiota of another species that has a wider thermal tolerance - green frogs (Lithobates clamitans). We predicted that this crossspecies transplant would increase the CTmax of the recipient wood frog larvae relative to the other treatments. In line with this prediction, green frog microbiome-recipient larvae had the highest CTmax while those with no inoculum had the lowest CTmax. Both the microbiome treatment and acclimation temperature significantly influenced the larval gut microbiota communities and alpha-diversity indices. Green frog microbiome-inoculated larvae were enriched in Rikenellaceae relative to the other treatments, which produce short-chain fatty acids and could contribute to greater energy availability and enhanced heat tolerance. Larvae that received no inoculation had a higher relative abundance of potentially pathogenic Aeromonas spp., which negatively affects host health and performance. Our results are the first to show that cross-species gut microbiota transplants alter heat tolerance in a predictable manner. This finding has repercussions for the conservation of species that are threatened by climate change and demonstrates a need to further explore the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota modulate host thermal tolerance.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246735,227,1,NA,jeb246735,CTmax; Thermal acclimation; Gut microbiota; Wood frogs; Microbiome manipulation

H. and Landry, Thomas and Lamarre, Simon G. and Speers-Roesch, Ben",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Poleward winters commonly expose animals, including fish, to frigid temperatures and low food availability. Fishes that remain active over winter must therefore balance trade-offs between conserving energy and maintaining physiological performance in the cold, yet the extent and underlying mechanisms of these trade-offs are not well understood. We investigated the metabolic plasticity of brook char (Salvelinus fontinalis), a temperate salmonid, from the biochemical to whole-animal level in response to cold and food deprivation. Acute cooling (1 degrees C day-1) from 14 degrees C to 2 degrees C had no effect on food consumption but reduced activity by 77\%. We then assessed metabolic performance and demand over 90 days with exposure to warm (8 degrees C) or cold winter (2 degrees C) temperatures while fish were fed or starved. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) decreased substantially during initial cooling from 8 degrees C to 2 degrees C (Q10=4.2-4.5) but brook char exhibited remarkable thermal compensation during acclimation (Q10=1.4-1.6). Conversely, RMR was substantially lower (40-48\%) in starved fish, conserving energy. Thus, the absolute magnitude of thermal plasticity may be masked or modified under food restriction. This reduction in RMR was associated with atrophy and decreases in in vivo protein synthesis rates, primarily in non-essential tissues. Remarkably, food deprivation had no effect on maximum oxygen uptake rates and thus aerobic capacity, supporting the notion that metabolic capacity can be decoupled from RMR in certain contexts. Overall, our study highlights the multi-faceted energetic flexibility of Salvelinus spp. that likely contributes to their success in harsh and variable environments and may be emblematic of winter-active fishes more broadly.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246743,227,3,NA,jeb246743,Brook char; Thermal acclimation; Energy expenditure; Oxygen uptake; Protein synthesis; Food deprivation; Winter
article,Experiencing short heat waves early in development changes thermal responsiveness of turtle embryos to later heat waves,"Breitenbach, Anthony T. and Marroquin-Flores, Rosario A. and Paitz, Ryan T. and Bowden, Rachel M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Although physiological responses to the thermal environment are most frequently investigated using constant temperatures, the incorporation of thermal variability can allow for a more accurate prediction of how thermally sensitive species respond to a rapidly changing climate. In species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), developmental responses to incubation temperature are mediated by several genes involved in gonadal differentiation. Kdm6b and Dmrt1 respond to cool incubation temperatures and are associated with testis development, while FoxL2 and Cyp19A1 respond to warm incubation temperatures and are associated with ovary development. Using fluctuating incubation temperatures, we designed two studies, one investigating how conflicting thermal cues affect the timing of commitment to gonadal development, and another investigating the rapid molecular responses to conflicting thermal cues in the red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta). Using gene expression as a proxy of timing of commitment to gonadal fate, results from the first study show that exposure to high amounts of conflicting thermal cues during development delays commitment to gonadal fate. Results from the second study show that Kdm6b splice variants exhibit differential responses to early heat wave exposure, but rapidly (within 2 days) recover to pre-exposure levels after the heat wave. Despite changes in the expression of Kdm6b splice variants, there was no effect on Dmrt1 expression. Collectively, these findings demonstrate how short exposures to heat early in development can change how embryos respond to heat later in development.",2023,10.1242/jeb.246235,226,18,NA,jeb246235,Sex determination; Temperature fluctuation; Gene expression; Alternative splicing
article,Internal carbonic anhydrase activity in the tissue of scleractinian corals is sufficient to support proposed roles in photosynthesis and calcification,"Hopkinson, Brian M. and Tansik, Anna L. and Fitt, William K.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Reef-building corals import inorganic carbon (Ci) to build their calcium carbonate skeletons and to support photosynthesis by the symbiotic algae that reside in their tissue. The internal pathways that deliver Ci for both photosynthesis and calcification are known to involve the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA), which interconverts CO2 and HCO3-. We have developed a method for absolute quantification of internal CA (iCA) activity in coral tissue based on the rate of O-18-removal from labeled Ci. The method was applied to three Caribbean corals (Orbicella faveolata, Porites astreoides and Siderastrea radians) and showed that these species have similar iCA activities per unit surface area, but that S. radians has similar to 10-fold higher iCA activity per unit tissue volume. A model of coral Ci processing shows that the measured iCA activity is sufficient to support the proposed roles for iCA in Ci transport for photosynthesis and calcification. This is the case even when iCA activity is homogeneously distributed throughout the coral, but the model indicates that it would be advantageous to concentrate iCA in the spaces where calcification (the calcifying fluid) and photosynthesis (the oral endoderm) take place. We argue that because the rates of photosynthesis and calcification per unit surface area are similar among the corals studied here, the areal iCA activity used to deliver Ci for these reactions should also be similar. The elevated iCA activity per unit volume of S. radians compared with that of the other species is probably due to the thinner effective tissue thickness in this species.",2015,10.1242/jeb.118182,218,13,2039-2048,NA,Inorganic carbon; Cnidarians; Symbiodinium; Modelling
article,Automated measurement of upper thermal limits in small aquatic animals,"Burton, Tim and Zeis, Bettina and Einum, Sigurd",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"We present a method for automating the measurement of upper thermal limits in small aquatic organisms. Upper thermal limits are frequently defined by the cessation of movement at high temperature, with measurement being performed by manual observation. Consequently, estimates of upper thermal limits may be subject to error and bias, both within and among observers. Our method utilises video-based tracking software to record the movement of individuals when exposed to high, lethal temperatures. We develop an algorithm in the R computing language that can objectively identify the loss of locomotory function from tracking data.

article,Mechanical properties of the cuticle of the tick <i>Amblyomma hebraeum</i> (Acari: Ixodidae),"Flynn, Peter C. and Kaufman, W. Reuben",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Female ticks of the family Ixodidae increase their mass up to 100-fold during the 7-10 day feeding period. We determined the material properties of the alloscutal cuticle of female Amblyomma hebraeum from the time of moulting through to full engorgement. The material properties of the cuticle were evaluated by a Kelvin-Voigt analysis of compliance determined from the stretch of loops of cuticle under stress. There was a 3-fold increase in cuticle dry mass during the first 3 weeks post-moult, during which the ductility and stiffness of the cuticle increased substantially. Under stress, the cuticle displayed time-dependent stretch, with a plastic (non-recoverable) and viscoelastic (recoverable) component. Plastic deformation was reasonably constant in the range 10-15\% over a wide range of induced stress above similar to 0.6 MPa. The plastic component of tick alloscutal cuticle was about 5-10 times higher than that of unsclerotized insect cuticle. Tick cuticle is far more ductile than unsclerotized insect cuticle. Material properties of the cuticle did not change significantly as a function of cuticular water content over the normal range throughout the feeding cycle (13-37\% wet mass). Injected dopamine (DA) reduced one measure of the viscosity of the cuticle by 38\%. Plastic deformability of the cuticle was reduced by 70\% after an in vitro stretch, but restored in fully engorged ticks, and in in vitro stretched loops by treatment with DA and reduced pH. Thinning of the cuticle by half during the rapid phase of engorgement requires plastic deformation (irreversible strain) in two orthogonal dimensions in excess of 40\%. Treatment with DA increased plastic deformation and enabled extensibility (strain at the point of rupture) above 40\%.",2015,10.1242/jeb.123919,218,17,2806-2814,NA,Cuticular plasticization; Viscoelastic; Plastic deformation; Dopamine; Young's modulus; Extensibility; Amblyomma hebraeum; Kelvin-Voigt
article,A perspective on insect water balance,"O'Donnell, Michael J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Insects have a large ratio of surface area to volume because of their small size; thus, they face the potential for desiccation in the terrestrial environment. Nonetheless, they constitute over half of identified species and their success on land can be attributed, in part, to adaptations that limit water loss and allow for effective gains of water from food, fluids or atmospheric water vapour. Reduction of water loss from the gut involves sophisticated mechanisms of ion recycling and water recovery by epithelia of the Malpighian tubules and hindgut. Water loss across the body surface is greatly reduced by the evolution of very thin but highly impermeable lipid-rich layers in the epicuticle. Respiratory water loss can be reduced through effective spiracular control mechanisms and by mechanisms for convective rather than diffusive gas exchange. In addition to extracting water from food sources, some insects are capable of absorption of atmospheric water vapour through processes that have evolved independently in multiple groups.",2022,10.1242/jeb.242358,225,7,NA,jeb242358,Malpighian tubule; Cuticle; Hindgut; Respiration; Water vapour absorption

Painted turtles exhibit a development-dependent tolerance that allows adults to survive anoxia approximately four times longer than hatchlings: adults survive similar to 170 days and hatchlings survive similar to 40 days at 3 degrees C. We hypothesized that this difference is related to development-dependent differences in ventricular gene expression. Using a comparative ontogenetic approach, we examined whole transcriptomic changes before, during and 5 days after a 20-day bout of anoxic submergence at 3 degrees C. Ontogeny accounted for more gene expression differences than treatment (anoxia or recovery): 1175 versus 237 genes, respectively. Of the 237 differences, 93 could confer protection against anoxia and reperfusion injury, 68 could be injurious and 20may be constitutively protective. Most striking during anoxiawas the main expression pattern of all 76 annotated ribosomal protein (R-protein) mRNAs, which decreased in anoxia-tolerant adults, but increased in anoxia-sensitive hatchlings, suggesting adult-specific regulation of translational suppression. These genes, along with 60 others that decreased their levels in adults and either increased or remained unchanged in hatchlings, implicate antagonistic pleiotropy as amechanismto resolve the long-standing question aboutwhy hatchling painted turtles overwinter in terrestrial nests, rather than emerge and overwinter in water during their first year. In summary, developmental differences in the transcriptome of the turtle ventricle revealed potentially protective mechanisms that contribute to extraordinary adult-specific anoxia tolerance, and provide a unique perspective on differences between the anoxia-induced molecular responses of anoxia-tolerant and anoxia-sensitive phenotypes within a species.",2020,10.1242/jeb.213918,223,4,NA,jeb213918,Chrysemys picta; Comparative transcriptomics; Reptile; Ribosomal protein; RNA-seq
article,Depth- and temperature-specific fatty acid adaptations in ctenophores from extreme habitats,"Winnikoff, Jacob R. and Haddock, Steven H. D. and Budin, Itay",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Animals are known to regulate the composition of their cell membranes to maintain key biophysical properties in response to changes in temperature. For deep-sea marine organisms, high hydrostatic pressure represents an additional, yet much more poorly understood, perturbant of cell membrane structure. Previous studies in fish and marine microbes have reported correlations with temperature and depth of membrane-fluidizing lipid components, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids. Because little has been done to isolate the separate effects of temperature and pressure on the lipid pool, it is still not understood whether these two environmental factors elicit independent or overlapping biochemical adaptive responses. Here, we use the taxonomic and habitat diversity of the phylum Ctenophora to test whether distinct low-temperature and high-pressure signatures can be detected in fatty acid profiles. We measured the fatty acid composition of 105 individual ctenophores, representing 21 species, from deep and shallow Arctic, temperate, and tropical sampling locales (sea surface temperature, -2 degrees to 28 degrees C). In tropical and temperate regions, remotely operated submersibles (ROVs) enabled sampling down to 4000 m. We found that among specimens with body temperatures 7.5 degrees C or colder, depth predicted fatty acid unsaturation levels. In contrast, in the upper 200 m of the water column, temperature predicted fatty acid chain lengths. Taken together, our findings suggest that lipid metabolism may be specialized with respect to multiple physical variables in diverse marine environments. Largely distinct modes of adaptation to depth and cold imply that polar marine invertebrates may not find a ready refugium from climate change in the deep.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242800,224,21,NA,jeb242800,Biochemical adaptation; Ctenophores; Deep sea; Lipids; Pressure; Temperature
article,Positive feedback promotes terrestrial emergence behaviour in an amphibious fish,"Tigert, Liam R. and Wright, Patricia A. and Turko, Andy J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Major ecological transitions such as the invasion of land by aquatic vertebrates may be facilitated by positive feedback between habitat choice and phenotypic plasticity. We used the amphibious fish Kryptolebias marmoratus to test the hypothesis that aquatic hypoxia, emergence behaviour and respiratory plasticity create this type of positive feedback loop that causes fish to spend increasing amounts of time on land. Terrestrially acclimated fish were more sensitive to aquatic hypoxia (emergence at higher P-O2) and were less hypoxia tolerant (shorter time to loss of equilibrium) relative to water-acclimated fish, which are necessary conditions for positive feedback. Next, we tested the prediction that exposure to aquatic hypoxia causes fish to emerge frequently, reduce gill surface area, and become less hypoxia tolerant. Indeed, fish exposed to severe aquatic hypoxia spent almost 50\% of the time out of water and coverage of the gill lamellae by an inter-lamellar cell mass almost doubled. Fish exposed to aquatic hypoxia that could emerge from water were also more sensitive to subsequent acute aquatic hypoxia and were less hypoxia tolerant than normoxia-exposed controls. These results are opposite those of fish that cannot escape from aquatic hypoxia and presumably arise owing to plastic changes that occur during air exposure. Together, these results indicate that emergence behaviour begets further emergence behaviour, driven by gill remodelling which reduces aquatic respiratory function. This type of positive feedback may explain how amphibious behaviour has repeatedly evolved in fishes that occupy hypoxic aquatic habitats despite the associated challenges of life on land.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244236,225,19,NA,jeb244236,Hypoxia; Gill remodelling; Respiration; Phenotypic plasticity; Mangrove rivulus; Kryptolebias marmoratus

It was demonstrated that zebrafish raised in hypoxic water (30 mmHg; control, 155 mmHg P-O2) until 4 days post-fertilization exhibited a substantial reduction in whole-body Ca2+ levels and Ca2+ uptake. Ca2+ uptake in hypoxia-treated fish did not return to pre-hypoxia (control) levels within 2 h of transfer back to normoxic water. Results from real-time PCR showed that hypoxia decreased the whole-body mRNA expression levels of the epithelial Ca2+ channel (ecac), but not plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (pmca2) or Na+/Ca2+-exchanger (ncx1b). Whole-mount in situ hybridization revealed that the number of ecac-expressing ionocytes was reduced in fish raised in hypoxic water. These findings suggested that hypoxic treatment suppressed the expression of ecac, thereby reducing Ca2+ influx. To further evaluate the potential mechanisms for the effects of hypoxia on Ca2+ regulation, a functional gene knockdown approach was employed to prevent the expression of HIF-1 alpha b during hypoxic treatment. Consistent with a role for HIF-1 alpha b in regulating Ca2+ balance during hypoxia, the results demonstrated that the reduction of Ca2+ uptake associated with hypoxic exposure was not observed in fish experiencing HIF-1 alpha b knockdown. Additionally, the effects of hypoxia on reducing the number of ecac-expressing ionocytes was less pronounced in HIF-1 alpha b-deficient fish. Overall, the current study revealed that hypoxic exposure inhibited Ca2+ uptake in developing zebrafish, probably owing to HIF-1 alpha b-mediated suppression of ecac expression.",2016,10.1242/jeb.148700,219,24,3988-3995,NA,Calcium; ECaC; Ion regulation; HIF; Fish; Ionocyte

The eversible vesicles are their unique paired transporting organs, which consist of an epithelium located inside a tube-like structure called the collophore on the first abdominal segment. The vesicles can be protruded out of the collophore and several lines of evidence indicate that they have a vital function in water uptake and ion balance. However, the amount of water absorbed by the vesicles and which other ions apart from Na+ are transported remain unknown. Using Orchesella cincta as a model, we developed protocols for two assays that enabled us to study water and ion movement across the eversible vesicles in whole living springtails. Using an inverse Ramsay assay we demonstrate that the eversible vesicles absorb water from a droplet applied onto their surface. Using the scanning ion-selective electrode technique (SIET), we show that the vesicles absorb Na+ and Cl- from the bathing medium, secrete NH4+, and both absorb and secrete K+. H+ is secreted at a low level in the anterior part and absorbed at the posterior part. We did not detect transport of Ca2+ at significant levels. The highest flux was the absorption of Cl-, and the magnitude of ion fluxes was significantly lower in fully hydrated springtails.

Compression of tracheae induced by abdominal pumping drives external gas exchange, as evidenced by the high correlation between CO2 emission peaks and body movements. During abdominal pumping, both the compression frequency and fractional change in diameter of tracheae increased with body mass. However, abdominal pumping and tracheal compression were only observed in larger, older caterpillars (>0.2.g body mass), suggesting that this hypoxic response increases during ontogeny. The diameters of major tracheae in the thorax increased isometrically with body mass. However, tracheae in the head did not scale with mass, suggesting that there is a large safety margin for oxygen delivery in the head in the youngest animals.

article,Acute thermal stress elicits interactions between gene expression and alternative splicing in a fish of conservation concern,"Thorstensen, Matt J. and Turko, Andy J. and Heath, Daniel D. and Jeffries, Ken M. and Pitcher, Trevor E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Transcriptomic research provides a mechanistic understanding of an organism's response to environmental challenges such as increasing temperatures, which can provide key insights into the threats posed by thermal challenges associated with urbanization and climate change. Differential gene expression and alternative splicing are two elements of the transcriptomic stress response that may work in tandem, but relatively few studies have investigated these interactions in fishes of conservation concern. We studied the imperilled redside dace (Clinostomus elongatus) as thermal stress is hypothesized to be an important cause of population declines. We tested the hypothesis that gene expression-splicing interactions contribute to the thermal stress response. Wild fish exposed to acute thermal stress were compared with both handling controls and fish sampled directly from a river. Liver tissue was sampled to study the transcriptomic stress response. With a gene set enrichment analysis, we found that thermally stressed fish showed a transcriptional response related to transcription regulation and responses to unfolded proteins, and alternatively spliced genes related to gene expression regulation and metabolism. One splicing factor, prpf38b, was upregulated in the thermally stressed group compared with the other treatments. This splicing factor may have a role in the Jun/AP-1 cellular stress response, a pathway with wide-ranging and context-dependent effects. Given large gene interaction networks and the context-dependent nature of transcriptional responses, our results highlight the importance of understanding interactions between gene expression and splicing for understanding transcriptomic responses to thermal stress.

Ammonia and urea net fluxes were reduced by 98\% during air exposure, but rebounded during recovery to >2-fold the control rates. Exchangeable water pools, rate constants of diffusive water exchange, unidirectional diffusive water flux rates (using tritiated waler) and transepithelial potential were also measured during control and recovery treatments, but exhibited no significant changes. Damage to proteins was not observed in either gill.

Catalase activity also decreased significantly in recovery relative to levels during air exposure in both the anterior gill and hepalopancreas, but not in the posterior gill. The crabs did not modify water metabolism or permeability. We conclude that Mo, was maintained but not enhanced during air exposure, while ammonia and urea-N excretion were impaired.

We hypothesized here that immune-challenged birds facing metabolic trade-offs (reduced energy supply/increased energy demand) favor a regulated hypothermic response at the expense of fever. To test this hypothesis, we compared 5 day old broiler chicks exposed to fasting, cold (25 degrees C), and fasting combined with cold with a control group fed under thermoneutral conditions (30 degrees C). The chicks were injected with saline or with a high dose of endotoxin known to induce a biphasic thermal response composed of a drop in body temperature (T-b) followed by fever. Then T-b, oxygen consumption (metabolic rate), peripheral vasomotion (cutaneous heat exchange), breathing frequency (respiratory heat exchange) and huddling behavior (heat conservation indicator) were analyzed. Irrespective of metabolic trade-offs, chicks presented a transient regulated hypothermia in the first hour, which relied on a suppressed metabolic rate for all groups, increased breathing frequency for chicks fedffasted at 30 degrees C, and peripheral vasodilation in chicks fedffasted at 25 degrees C. Fever was observed only in chicks kept at thermoneutrality and was supported by peripheral vasoconstriction and huddling behavior. Fed and fasted chicks at 25 degrees C completely eliminated fever despite the ability to increase metabolic rate for thermogenesis in the phase correspondent to fever when it was pharmacologically induced by 2,4-dinitrophenol.

We examined proteomic responses to increasing emersion times and decreasing recovery (immersion) times in the mussel Geukensia demissa, which occurs in salt marshes along the east coast of North America. Individuals are found above mean tide level, and can be emersed for over 18 h during spring tides. We acclimated mussels to full immersion at 15 degrees C for 4 weeks, and compared changes in gill protein expression between groups of mussels that were continually immersed (control), were emersed for 6 h and immersed during recovery for 18 h (6E/18R), were emersed for 12 h and recovered for 12 h (12E/12R), or were emersed for 18 h with a 6 h recovery (18E/6R). We found clear differences in protein expression patterns among the treatments. Proteins associated with anaerobic fermentation increased in abundance in 6E/18R but not in 12E/12R or 18E/6R. Increases in oxidative stress proteins were most apparent in 12E/12R, and in 18E/6R changes in cytoskeletal protein expression predominated.

Respirometry showed that flies used less energy digesting meals faster at higher temperatures but that their starvation tolerance was reduced, supporting the prediction that warmer temperatures are optimal for bloodmeal digestion while cooler temperatures should be preferred for unfed or post-absorptive flies. C-13-Breath testing revealed that the flies oxidized dietary glucose and amino acids within the first couple of hours of feeding and overall oxidized more dietary nutrients at the cooler temperatures, supporting the premise that warmer digestion temperatures are preferred because theymaximize speed and minimize costs. An independent test of these predictions using a thermal gradient confirmed that recently fed flies selected warmer temperatures and then selected cooler temperatures as they became post-absorptive, presumably to maximize starvation resistance. Collectively these results suggest there are at least two thermal optima in a given population at any time and flies switch dynamically between optima throughout feeding cycles.",2016,10.1242/jeb.138669,219,12,1893-1902,NA,Metabolism; Energetics; Behaviour; Climate change; Stable isotopes; Thermal preference; Heat increment of feeding; Specific dynamic action; Tsetse; Diptera
article,Bitter stimuli modulate the feeding decision of a blood-sucking insect via two sensory inputs,"Pontes, Gina and Minoli, Sebastian and Ortega Insaurralde, Isabel and de Brito Sanchez, Maria Gabriela and Barrozo, Romina B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The gustatory system of animals is involved in food quality assessment and controls the feeding decision of an individual confronted with a potential alimentary source. Triatomines are haematophagous insects that feed on vertebrate blood. Once they reach a potential host, they walk over the host skin searching for an adequate site to pierce. Then, they insert their stylets and take a first sampling gorge to decide whether food is acceptable. Our work reveals that the presence of bitter compounds inhibits the feeding behavior of these bugs. Firstly, triatomines decreased their feeding behavior if substrates spread with quinine or caffeine were detected by external receptors localized exclusively in the antennae. Morphological inspections along with electrophysiological recordings revealed the existence of four gustatory sensilla located in the tip of the antenna that respond to both bitter tastants. The absence of these bitter detectors by antennal ablation reversed the observed feeding inhibition evoked by bitter compounds. Secondly, once triatomines pumped the first volume of food with bitter compounds (quinine, caffeine, berberine, salicin), a decrease in their feeding behavior was observed. Morphological inspections revealed the existence of eight gustatory sensilla located in the pharynx that might be responsible for the internal bitter detection. Finally, we found that a brief pre-exposure to bitter compounds negatively modulates the motivation of bugs to feed on an appetitive solution. Results presented here highlight the relevance of bitter taste perception in the modulation of the feeding behavior of a blood-sucking insect.",2014,10.1242/jeb.107722,217,20,3708-3717,NA,Feeding behavior; Bitter; Taste sensilla; Plasticity; Blood-sucking

Conditions that may be well tolerated at one time can become detrimental if experienced at another, as a result of seasonal acclimation. Temperature is the most critical variable as it affects most aspects of an organism's physiology. To address this, we quantified arm regeneration and respiration in the Australian brittle star Ophionereis schayeri for 10 weeks in response to a +3 degrees C warming (18.5 degrees C, simulating a winter heatwave) compared with ambient winter temperature (15.5 degrees C). The metabolic scaling rate (b=0.635 at 15.5 degrees C and 0.746 at 18.5 degrees C) with respect to size was similar to that of other echinoderms and was not affected by temperature. Elevated temperature resulted in up to a 3-fold increase in respiration and a doubling of regeneration growth; however, mortality was greater (up to 44.2\% at 18.5 degrees C), especially in the regenerating brittle stars. Metabolic rate of the brittle stars held at 18.5 degrees C was much higher than expected (Q(10)approximate to 23) and similar to that of O. schayeri tested in summer, which was near their estimated thermotolerance limits. The additional costs associated with the elevated metabolism and regeneration rates incurred by the unseasonably warm winter temperatures may lead to increased mortality and predation risk.",2023,10.1242/jeb.244613,226,3,NA,jeb244613,Thermotolerance; Climate change; Brittle star; Scaling; Respiration

We conducted a multi-level investigation including cardiac physiology, enzyme activity, and targeted and untargeted metabolomic analyses - that elucidated a spectrum of adaptations to extreme heat in this organism. All systems examined showed heat intensity-dependent responses. Under moderate heat stress (37-45 degrees C), the snail depressed cardiac activity and entered a state of metabolic depression. The global metabolomic and enzymatic analyses revealed production of metabolites characteristic of oxygen-independent pathways of ATP generation (lactate and succinate) in the depressed metabolic state, which suggests that anaerobic metabolism was the main energy supply pathway under heat stress (37-52 degrees C). The metabolomic analyses also revealed alterations in glycerophospholipid metabolism under extreme heat stress (52 degrees C), which likely reflected adaptive changes to maintain membrane structure. Small-molecular-mass organic osmolytes (glycine betaine, choline and carnitine) showed complex changes in concentration that were consistent with a role of these protein-stabilizing solutes in protection of the proteome under heat stress. This thermophilic species can thus deploy a wide array of adaptive strategies to acclimatize to extremely high temperatures.",2021,10.1242/jeb.238659,224,6,NA,jeb238659,Anaerobic metabolism; Cellular stress response; Membrane stability; Metabolic depression; Protein stability; Thermoprotective osmolytes

Astrangia poculata is a temperate scleractinian coral that provides unique opportunities to understand the roles of phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary adaptation in coral physiological tolerance limits. This species inhabits hard-bottom ecosystems from the northwestern Atlantic to the Gulf of Mexico and withstands an annual temperature range of up to 20 degrees C. Additionally, A. poculata is facultatively symbiotic and co-occurs in both symbiotic ('brown') and aposymbiotic ('white') states. Here, brown and white A. poculata were collected from Virginia (VA) and Rhode Island (RI), USA, and exposed to heat (18-32 degrees C) and cold (18-6 degrees C) stress, during which respiration of the coral host along with photosynthesis and photochemical efficiency (F-v/F-m) of Breviolum psygmophilum photosymbionts were measured. Thermal performance curves (TPCs) of respiration revealed a pattern of countergradient variation with RI corals exhibiting higher respiration rates overall, and specifically at 6, 15, 18, 22 and 26 degrees C. Additionally, thermal optimum (T-opt) analyses show a 3.8 degrees C (brown) and 6.9 degrees C (white) higher T-opt in the VA population, corresponding to the warmer in situ thermal environment in VA. In contrast to respiration, no origin effect was detected in photosynthesis rates or F-v/F-m, suggesting a possible host-only signature of adaptation. This study is the first to consider A. poculata's response to both heat and cold stress across symbiotic states and geography, and provides insight into the potential evolutionary mechanisms behind the success of this species along the East Coast of the USA.",2019,10.1242/jeb.189225,222,5,NA,jeb189225,Facultative symbiosis; Thermal performance curve; Local adaptation; Countergradient variation; G matrix; Mitochondrial proliferation
article,Wind of change: a diurnal skink thermoregulates between cooler set-points and for an increased amount of time in the presence of wind,"Virens, Evelyn and Cree, Alison",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Wind has the potential to dramatically alter the thermal landscape of habitats, and consequently, to affect how ectotherms thermoregulate. However, few studies have directly assessed if wind alters thermoregulation by ectotherms. We compared the thermoregulation of a heliothermic New Zealand skink under three treatments: no wind, wind at 2 m s(-1) and wind at 6 m s(-1). We provided captive skinks with housing in which their preferred body temperature was only achievable inside a wind tunnel. During experimental treatments with wind, airflow was generated through the wind tunnel while the maximum available operative temperature remained consistent among treatments. Skinks were able to move in and out of the wind tunnel. Using thermal bio-loggers, we recorded near-continuous skin temperatures of skinks over 90 min. Contrary to our expectations, more skinks tended to thermoregulate in the two wind treatments compared with the treatments without wind (P=0.062) and of the skinks that did thermoregulate, those in the two wind treatments thermoregulated for significantly longer than those in the treatment without wind. The set-point temperatures that skinks thermoregulated between became significantly cooler as windspeed increased, despite skinks having access to the same operative temperatures. Overall, our study suggests that wind has the potential to significantly change the temperatures selected by lizards, even when comparable temperatures are available; wind is therefore an important environmental parameter to consider when studying the thermal ecology of ectotherms, including in the context of climate change.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244038,225,6,NA,jeb244038,Oligosoma; Dehydration; Dry-skinned ectotherm; Optimality model; Behavioural thermoregulation
article,Hypoxia tolerance of giant axon-mediated escape jetting in California market squid (<i>Doryteuthis opalescens</i>),"Li, Diana H. and Gilly, William F.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Squids display a wide range of swimming behaviors, including powerful escape jets mediated by the giant axon system. For California market squid (Doryteuthis opalescens), maintaining essential behaviors like the escape response during environmental variations poses a major challenge as this species often encounters intrusions of cold, hypoxic offshore waters in its coastal spawning habitats. To explore the effects of hypoxia on locomotion and the underlying neural mechanisms, we made in vivo recordings of giant axon activity and simultaneous pressure inside the mantle cavity during escape jets in squid exposed to acute progressive hypoxia followed by return to normal dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration (normoxia). Compared with those in normoxia (>8 mg l(-1) DO), escape jets were unchanged in moderate hypoxia (4 and 2 mg l(-1) DO), but giant axon activity and associated mantle contractions significantly decreased while neuromuscular latency increased under severe hypoxia (0.5 mg l(-1) DO). Animals that survived exposure to severe hypoxia reliably produced escape jets under such conditions and fully recovered as more oxygen became available. The reduction in neuromuscular output under hypoxia suggests that market squid may suppress metabolic activity to maintain sufficient behavioral output, a common strategy in many hypoxia-tolerant species. The ability to recover from the deleterious effects of hypoxia suggests that this species is well adapted to cope with coastal hypoxic events that commonly occur in Monterey Bay, unless these events become more severe in the future as climate change progresses.",2019,10.1242/jeb.198812,222,8,NA,jeb198812,Hypoxia; Squid; Escape response; Giant axon; Recovery
article,MicroRNAs regulate survival in oxygen-deprived environments,"English, Simon G. and Hadj-Moussa, Hanane and Storey, Kenneth B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Some animals must endure prolonged periods of oxygen deprivation to survive. One such extreme model is the northern crayfish (Orconectes virilis), that regularly survives year-round hypoxic and anoxic stresses in its warm stagnant summer waters and in its cold, ice-locked winter waters. To elucidate the molecular underpinnings of anoxia resistance in this natural model, we surveyed the expression profiles of 76 highly conserved microRNAs in crayfish hepatopancreas and tail muscle from normoxic, acute 2 h anoxia, and chronic 20 h anoxia exposures. MicroRNAs are known to regulate a diverse array of cellular functions required for environmental stress adaptations, and here we explored their role in anoxia tolerance. The tissue-specific anoxia responses observed herein, with 22 anoxia-responsive microRNAs in the hepatopancreas and only four in muscle, suggest that microRNAs facilitate a reprioritization of resources to preserve crucial organ functions. Bioinformatic microRNA target enrichment analysis predicted that the anoxia-downregulated microRNAs in hepatopancreas targeted Hippo signalling, suggesting that cell proliferation and apoptotic signalling are highly regulated in this liver-like organ during anoxia. Compellingly, miR-125-5p, miR-33-5p and miR-190-5p, all known to target the master regulator of oxygen deprivation responses HIF1 (hypoxia inducible factor-1), were anoxia downregulated in the hepatopancreas. The anoxia-increased transcript levels of the oxygen-dependent subunit HIF1 alpha highlight a potential critical role for miRNA-HIF targeting in facilitating a successful anoxia response. Studying the cytoprotective mechanisms in place to protect against the challenges associated with surviving in oxygen-poor environments is critical to elucidating the vast and substantial role of microRNAs in the regulation of metabolism and stress in aquatic invertebrates.",2018,10.1242/jeb.190579,221,23,NA,jeb190579,Orconectes virilis; Anoxia tolerance; Metabolic rate depression; HIF1

Here, we ask whether oxygen limitation determines the chronic upper thermal limits in larvae of the mayfly Neocloeon triangulifer, an emerging model for ecological and physiological studies. Our experiments are based on a robust understanding of the upper acute (similar to 40 degrees C) and chronic thermal limits of this species (>28 degrees C, <= 30 degrees C) derived from full life cycle rearing experiments across temperatures. We tested two related predictions derived from the hypothesis that oxygen limitation sets the chronic upper thermal limits: (1) aerobic scope declines in mayfly larvae as they approach and exceed temperatures that are chronically lethal to larvae; and (2) genes indicative of hypoxia challenge are also responsive in larvae exposed to ecologically relevant thermal limits. Neither prediction held true. We estimated aerobic scope by subtracting measurements of standard oxygen consumption rates from measurements of maximum oxygen consumption rates, the latter of which was obtained by treating with the metabolic uncoupling agent carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy) pheylhydrazone (FCCP). Aerobic scope was similar in larvae held below and above chronic thermal limits. Genes indicative of oxygen limitation (LDH, EGL-9) were only upregulated under hypoxia or during exposure to temperatures beyond the chronic (and more ecologically relevant) thermal limits of this species (LDH). Our results suggest that the chronic thermal limits of this species are likely not driven by oxygen limitation, but rather are determined by other factors, e.g. bioenergetics costs. We caution against the use of short-term thermal ramping approaches to estimate critical thermal limits (CTmax) in aquatic insects because those temperatures are typically higher than those that occur in nature.",2017,10.1242/jeb.156919,220,14,2598-2605,NA,Temperature; Aerobic scope; Hypoxia; Aquatic insect; Gene expression

The ability of this desiccation- and cold-sensitive tropical species to evolve in response to seasonal changes in montane localities is largely unknown. Here, we investigated how this sensitive species adapt to seasonally varying environmental conditions that are lethal to its survival. We observed change in the frequency of dark and light morphs of D. ananassae in five mid-altitude localities during the last decade (2000-2010). We document invasion of D. ananassae to montane localities and increase in frequency of the dark morph. The stress tolerance of morphs (dark and light) remained unaffected of developmental acclimation. However, adult acclimation has shown significant effects on tolerance to various environmental stresses in morphs and effect of this acclimation persist for long durations. Desiccation and cold stress tolerance was increased after adult acclimation for respective stress in the dark morph; while tolerance of the light morph was not affected. Further, heat tolerance of the light morph was increased after adult heat acclimation with no influence on heat tolerance of the dark morph. Our results suggest a possible role of adult acclimation in successful invasion and adaptation of D. ananassae to montane localities. Future experiments should be carried out to determine whether the survival in adverse conditions of low versus high temperature and humidity during seasonal changes is assisted by different acclimation abilities of the two morphs of D. ananassae.",2013,10.1242/jeb.080200,216,9,1578-1586,NA,adult acclimation; developmental acclimation; persistence

Theory predicts that ectothermic organisms from thermally stable environments have muted plasticity, and that these species may be particularly vulnerable to temperature increases. Whether such species retained or lost acclimation capacity remains largely unknown. We studied proteome changes in the planarian Crenobia alpina, a prominent member of cold-stable alpine habitats that is considered to be a cold-adapted stenotherm. We found that the species' critical thermal maximum (CTmax) is above its experienced habitat temperatures and that different populations exhibit differential CTmax acclimation capacity, whereby an alpine population showed reduced plasticity. In a separate experiment, we acclimated C. alpina individuals from the alpine population to 8. 11, 14 or 17 degrees C over the course of 168 h and compared their comprehensively annotated proteomes. Network analyses of 3399 proteins and protein set enrichment showed that while the species' proteome is overall stable across these temperatures, protein sets functioning in oxidative stress response, mitochondria, protein synthesis and turnover are lower in abundance following warm acclimation. Proteins associated with an unfolded protein response, ciliogenesis, tissue damage repair, development and the innate immune system were higher in abundance following warm acclimation. Our findings suggest that this species has not suffered DNA decay (e.g. loss of heat-shock proteins) during evolution in a cold-stable environment and has retained plasticity in response to elevated temperatures, challenging the notion that stable environments necessarily result in muted plasticity.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244218,225,15,NA,jeb244218,Phenotypic plasticity; Proteomics; Molecular adaptation; Crenobia alpine; Aquatic ectotherm; Thermal tolerance
article,Feeling the heat: variation in thermal sensitivity within and among populations,"DeLiberto, Amanda N. and Drown, Melissa K. and Ehrlich, Moritz A. and Oleksiak, Marjorie F. and Crawford, Douglas L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Physiology defines individual responses to global climate change and species distributions across environments. Physiological responses are driven by temperature on three time scales: acute, acclimatory and evolutionary. Acutely, passive temperature effects often dictate an expected 2-fold increase in metabolic processes for every 10 degrees C change in temperature (Q10). Yet, these acute responses often are mitigated through acclimation within an individual or evolutionary adaptation within populations over time. Natural selection can influence both responses and often reduces interindividual variation towards an optimum. However, this interindividual physiological variation is not well characterized. Here, we quantified responses to a 16 degrees C temperature difference in six physiological traits across nine thermally distinct Fundulus heteroclitus populations. These traits included whole-animal metabolism (WAM), critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and substrate-specific cardiac metabolism measured in approximately 350 individuals. These traits exhibited high variation among both individuals and populations. Thermal sensitivity (Q10) was determined, specifically as the acclimated Q10, in which individuals were both acclimated and assayed at each temperature. The interindividual variation in Q10 was unexpectedly large: ranging from 0.6 to 5.4 for WAM. Thus, with a 16 degrees C difference, metabolic rates were unchanged in some individuals, while in others they were 15-fold higher. Furthermore, a significant portion of variation was related to habitat temperature. Warmer populations had a significantly lower Q10 for WAM and CTmax after acclimation. These data suggest that individual variation in thermal sensitivity reflects different physiological strategies to respond to temperature variation, providing many different adaptive responses to changing environments.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244831,225,21,NA,jeb244831,KEY WORDS; Fundulus heteroclitus; Metabolism; CTmax; Acclimation; Thermal tolerance; Q10
article,"The influence of stochastic temperature fluctuations in shaping the physiological performance of the California mussel, <i>Mytilus californianus</i>","Nancollas, Sarah J. and Todgham, Anne E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Climate change is forecasted to increase temperature variability and stochasticity. Most of our understanding of thermal physiology of intertidal organisms has come from laboratory experiments that acclimate organisms to submerged conditions and steady-state increases in temperatures. For organisms experiencing the ebb and flow of tides with unpredictable low tide aerial temperatures, the reliability of reported tolerances and thus predicted responses to climate change requires incorporation of environmental complexity into empirical studies. Using the mussel Mytilus californianus, our study examined how stochasticity of the thermal regime influences physiological performance. Mussels were acclimated to either submerged conditions or a tidal cycle that included either predictable, unpredictable or no thermal stress during daytime low tide. Physiological performance was measured through anaerobic metabolism, energy stores and cellular stress mechanisms just before low tide, and cardiac responses during a thermal ramp. Both air exposure and stochasticity of temperature change were important in determining thermal performance. Glycogen content was highest in the mussels from the unpredictable treatment, but there was no difference in the expression of heat shock proteins between thermal treatments, suggesting that mussels prioritise energy reserves to deal with unpredictable low tide conditions. Mussels exposed to fluctuating thermal regimes had lower gill anaerobic metabolism, which could reflect increased metabolic capacity. Our results suggest that although thermal magnitude plays an important role in shaping physiological performance, other key elements of the intertidal environment complexity such as stochasticity, thermal variability and thermal history are also important considerations for determining how species will respond to climate warming.",2022,NA,225,14,NA,NA,Environmental predictability; Unpredictable; Climate; change; Cardiac performance; Intertidal physiology; Bioenergetics

N. and Gillis, Todd E. and Warren, Daniel E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Western painted turtles (Chrysemys picta bellii) are the most anoxia-tolerant tetrapod. Survival time improves at low temperature and during ontogeny, such that adults acclimated to 3 degrees C survive far longer without oxygen than either warm-acclimated adults or cold-acclimated hatchlings. As protein synthesis is rapidly suppressed to save energy at the onset of anoxia exposure, this study tested the hypothesis that cold acclimation would evoke preparatory changes in protein expression to support enhanced anoxia survival in adult but not hatchling turtles. To test this, adult and hatchling turtles were acclimated to either 20 degrees C (warm) or 3 degrees C (cold) for 5 weeks, and then the heart ventricles were collected for quantitative proteomic analysis. The relative abundance of 1316 identified proteins was compared between temperatures and developmental stages. The effect of cold acclimation on the cardiac proteomewas only evident in the context of an interaction with life stage, suggesting that ontogenic differences in anoxia tolerance may be predicated on successful maturation of the heart. The main differences between the hatchling and adult cardiac proteomes reflect an increase in metabolic scope with age that included more myoglobin and increased investment in both aerobic and anaerobic energy pathways. Mitochondrial structure and function were key targets of the life stage- and temperature-induced changes to the cardiac proteome, including reduced Complex II proteins in cold-acclimated adults that may help down-regulate the electron transport system and avoid succinate accumulation during anoxia. Therefore, targeted cold-induced changes to the cardiac proteome may be a contributing mechanism for stage-specific anoxia tolerance in turtles.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242387,224,14,NA,jeb242387,Temperature; Heart; Hatchling; Development; Ectotherm; iTRAQ; Protein expression
article,Oxygen limitation fails to explain upper chronic thermal limits and the temperature size rule in mayflies,"Funk, David H. and Sweeney, Bernard W. and Jackson, John K.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"An inability to adequately meet tissue oxygen demands has been proposed as an important factor setting upper thermal limits in ectothermic invertebrates (especially aquatic species) as well as explaining the observed decline in adult size with increased rearing temperature during the immature stages (a phenomenon known as the temperature size rule, or TSR). We tested this by rearing three aquatic insects (the mayflies Neocloeon triangulifer and two species of the Cloeon dipterum complex) through their entire larval life under a range of temperature and oxygen concentrations. Hyperoxia did not extend upper thermal limits, nor did it prevent the loss of size or fertility experienced near upper chronic thermal limits. At moderate temperatures, the TSR pattern was observed under conditions of hyperoxia, normoxia and hypoxia, suggesting little or no influence of oxygen on this trend. However, fora given rearing temperature, adults were smaller and less fecund under hypoxia as a result of a lowering of growth rates. These mayflies greatly increased the size of their gills in response to lower dissolved oxygen concentrations but not under oxygen-saturated conditions over a temperature range yielding the classic TSR response. Using ommatidium diameter as a proxy for cell size, we found the classic TSR pattern observed under moderate temperature conditions was due primarily to a change in the number of cells rather than cell size. We conclude overall that a failure to meet tissue oxygen demands is not a viable hypothesis for explaining either the chronic thermal limit or TSR pattern in these species.",2021,10.1242/jeb.233338,224,1,NA,jeb233338,Chronic hypoxia; Hyperoxia; TSR; OCLTT; Gill allometry

When under thermal stress, cardiac function plays a crucial role in sustaining adequate oxygen supply for respiring tissues. Thus, adaptive phenotypic plasticity of cardiac performance may be critical for modifying thermal limits during temperature acclimation. Here we investigated effects of temperature acclimation on oxygen consumption, cardiac function and blood oxygen carrying capacity of a eurythermal go by fish, Gillichthys mirabilis, acclimated to 9, 19 and 26 degrees C for 4. weeks. Acclimation did not alter resting metabolic rates or heart rates; no compensation of rates was observed at acclimation temperatures. However, under an acute heat ramp, warm-acclimated fish exhibited greater heat tolerance (CTmax=33.3, 37.1 and 38.9 degrees C for 9 degrees C-, 19 degrees C- and 26 degrees C acclimated fish, respectively) and higher cardiac arrhythmia temperatures compared with 9 degrees C-acclimated fish. Heart rates measured under an acute heat stress every week during 28. days of acclimation suggested that both maximum heart rates and temperature at onset of maximum heart rates changed over time with acclimation. Hemoglobin levels increased with acclimation temperature, from 35. g. l(-1) in 9 degrees C-acclimated fish to 60-80.g.l(-1) in 19 degrees C- and 26 degrees C-acclimated fish. Oxygen consumption rates during recovery from acute heat stress showed post-stress elevation in 26 degrees C-acclimated fish. These data, coupled with elevated resting metabolic rates and heart rates at warm temperatures, suggest a high energetic cost associated with warm acclimation in G. mirabilis. Furthermore, acclimatory capacity appears to be optimized at 19 degrees C, a temperature shown by behavioral studies to be close to the species' preferred temperature.",2013,10.1242/jeb.083873,216,11,2111-2121,NA,cardiac function; Gillichthys mirabilis; heat stress; respirometry; temperature acclimation
article,Upper lethal temperatures in three cold-tolerant insects are higher in winter than in summer,"Vu, Henry M. and Duman, John G.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Upper lethal temperatures (ULTs) of cold-adapted insect species in winter have not been previously examined. We anticipated that as the lower lethal temperatures (LLTs) decreased (by 20-30 degrees C) with the onset of winter, the ULTs would also decrease accordingly. Consequently, given the recent increases in winter freeze-thaw cycles and warmer winters due to climate change, it became of interest to determine whether ambient temperatures during thaws were approaching ULTs during the cold seasons. However, beetle Dendroides canadensis (Coleoptera: Pyrochroidae) larvae had higher 24 and 48 h ULT50 (the temperature at which 50\% mortality occurred) in winter than in summer. The 24 and 48 h ULT50 for D. canadensis in winter were 40.9 and 38.7 degrees C, respectively. For D. canadensis in summer, the 24 and 48 h ULT50 were 36.7 and 36.4 degrees C. During the transition periods of spring and autumn, the 24 h ULT50 was 37.3 and 38.5 degrees C, respectively.

article,Thermal limitation of performance and biogeography in a free-ranging ectotherm: insights from accelerometry,"Gannon, Ruan and Taylor, Matthew D. and Suthers, Iain M. and Gray, Charles A. and van der Meulen, Dylan E. and Smith, James A. and Payne, Nicholas L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Theoretical and laboratory studies generally show that ectotherm performance increases with temperature to an optimum, and subsequently declines. Several physiological mechanisms probably shape thermal performance curves, but responses of free-ranging animals to temperature variation will represent a compromise between these mechanisms and ecological constraints. Thermal performance data from wild animals balancing physiology and ecology are rare, and this represents a hindrance for predicting population impacts of future temperature change. We used internally implanted accelerometers near the middle of a species' geographical distribution and gill-net catch data near the species' latitudinal extremes to quantify temperature-related activity levels of a wild predatory fish (Platycephalus fuscus). We examined our data in the context of established models of thermal performance, and the relationship between thermal performance thresholds and biogeography. Acceleration data approximated a thermal performance curve, with activity peaking at 23 degrees C but declining rapidly at higher temperatures. Gill-net catch data displayed a similar trend, with a temperature-associated increase and decrease in catch rates in temperate and tropical regions, respectively. Extrapolated estimates of zero activity (CTmin and CTmax) from the accelerometers were similar to the minimum and maximum mean monthly water temperatures experienced at the southern and northern (respectively) limits of the species distribution, consistent with performance-limited biogeography in this species. These data highlight the fundamental influence of temperature on ectotherm performance, and how thermal performance limits may shape biogeography. Biologging approaches are rarely used to examine thermal performance curves in free-ranging animals, but these may be central to understanding the tradeoffs between physiology and ecology that constrain species' biogeographies and determine the susceptibility of ectotherms to future increases in temperature.",2014,10.1242/jeb.104455,217,17,3033-3037,NA,Climate change; Pejus; Range contraction; Tagging; Telemetry; Thermal tolerance
article,Symbiont regulation in <i>Stylophora pistillata</i> during cold stress: an acclimation mechanism against oxidative stress and severe bleaching,"Marangoni, Laura Fernandes de Barros and Rottier, Cecile and Ferrier-Pages, Christine",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Widespread coral bleaching and mortality, leading to coral reef decline, have been mainly associated with climate-change-driven increases in sea surface temperature. However, bleaching and mortality events have also been related to decreases in sea surface temperature, with cold stress events (e.g. La Nina events) being expected to increase in frequency or intensity as a result of a changing climate. Cold stress creates physiological symptoms in symbiotic reef-building corals similar to those observed when they are heat stressed, and the biochemical mechanisms underpinning cold stress in corals have been suggested to be related to an oxidative stress condition. However, up to now, this hypothesis had not been tested. This study assessed how short and long cold excursions in seawater temperature affect the physiology and biochemical processes related to oxidative stress in the reef-building coral Stylophora pistillata. We provide, for the first time, direct evidence that the mechanisms underpinning cold stress and bleaching are related to the production of reactive oxygen species, and that rapid expulsion of a significant proportion of the symbiont population by the host during cooling conditions is an acclimation mechanism to avoid oxidative stress and, ultimately, severe bleaching. Furthermore, this study is one of the first to show that upwelling conditions (short-term cold stress+nutrient enrichment) can provoke a more severe oxidative stress condition in corals than cold stress alone.",2021,10.1242/jeb.235275,224,3,NA,jeb235275,Cooling conditions; Coral bleaching; Nutrient enrichment; Oxidative metabolism; Upwelling
article,Autonomic cardiac regulation facilitates acute heat tolerance in rainbow trout: <i>in situ</i> and <i>in vivo</i> support,"Gilbert, Matthew J. H. and Rani, Varsha and McKenzie, Sean M. and Farrell, Anthony P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Acute warming in fish increases heart rate (f(H)) and cardiac output to peak values, after which performance plateaus or declines and arrhythmia may occur. This cardiac response can place a convective limitation on systemic oxygen delivery at high temperatures. To test the hypothesis that autonomic cardiac regulation protects cardiac performance in rainbow trout during acute warming, we investigated adrenergic and cholinergic regulation during the onset and progression of cardiac limitations. We explored the direct effects of adrenergic stimulation by acutely warming an in situ working perfused heart until arrhythmia occurred, cooling the heart to restore rhythmicity and rewarming with increasing adrenergic stimulation. Adrenergic stimulation produced a clear, dose-dependent increase in the temperature and peak f(H) achieved prior to the onset of arrhythmia. To examine how this adrenergic protection functions in conjunction with cholinergic vagal inhibition in vivo. rainbow trout fitted with ECG electrodes were acutely warmed in a respirometer until they lost equilibrium (CTmax) with and without muscarinic (atropine) and beta-adrenergic (sotalol) antagonists. Trout exhibited roughly equal and opposing cholinergic and adrenergic tone on f(H) that persisted up to critical temperatures. beta-Adrenergic blockade significantly lowered peak f(H) by 14-17\%, while muscarinic blockade significantly lowered the temperature for peak f(H) by 2.0 degrees C. Moreover, muscarinic and beta-adrenergic blockers injected individually or together significantly reduced CTmax by up to 3 degrees C, indicating for the first time that cardiac adrenergic stimulation and cholinergic inhibition can enhance acute heat tolerance in rainbow trout at the level of the heart and the whole animal.",2019,10.1242/jeb.194365,222,9,NA,jeb194365,Upper thermal tolerance; Autonomic regulation; Heart rate; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Cardiac arrhythmia
article,"Cardiac plasticity influences aerobic performance and thermal tolerance in a tropical, freshwater fish at elevated temperatures","Nyboer, Elizabeth A. and Chapman, Lauren J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Fishes faced with novel thermal conditions often modify physiological functioning to compensate for elevated temperatures. This physiological plasticity (thermal acclimation) has been shown to improve metabolic performance and extend thermal limits in many species. Adjustments in cardiorespiratory function are often invoked as mechanisms underlying thermal plasticity because limitations in oxygen supply have been predicted to define thermal optima in fishes; however, few studies have explicitly linked cardiorespiratory plasticity to metabolic compensation. Here, we quantified thermal acclimation capacity in the commercially harvested Nile perch (Lates niloticus) of East Africa, and investigated mechanisms underlying observed changes. We reared juvenile Nile perch for 3 months under two temperature regimes, and then measured a series of metabolic traits (e.g. aerobic scope) and critical thermal maximum (CTmax) upon acute exposure to a range of experimental temperatures. We also measured morphological traits of heart ventricles, gills and brains to identify potential mechanisms for compensation. We found that long-term (3 month) exposure to elevated temperature induced compensation in upper thermal tolerance (CTmax) and metabolic performance (standard and maximum metabolic rate, and aerobic scope), and induced cardiac remodeling in Nile perch. Furthermore, variation in heart morphology influenced variations in metabolic function and thermal tolerance. These results indicate that plastic changes enacted over longer exposures lead to differences in metabolic flexibility when organisms are acutely exposed to temperature variation. Furthermore, we established functional links between cardiac plasticity, metabolic performance and thermal tolerance, providing evidence that plasticity in cardiac capacity may be one mechanism for coping with climate change.",2018,10.1242/jeb.178087,221,15,NA,jeb178087,Climate change; Thermal plasticity; Nile perch; Tropical fisheries; Heart remodeling; Acclimation capacity

For insects that live at the air-water interface, such as water striders, non-linear and multi-scale perturbations produce dynamic surface deformations which may impair locomotion. We studied escape jumps of adults, juveniles and first-instar larvae of the water strider Aquarius remigis on smooth, wave-dominated and bubble-dominated water surfaces. Effects of substrate on takeoff jumps were substantial, with significant reductions in takeoff angles, peak translational speeds, attained heights and power expenditure on more perturbed water surfaces. Age effects were similarly pronounced, with the first-instar larvae experiencing the greatest degradation in performance; age-by-treatment effects were also significant for many kinematic variables. Although commonplace in nature, perturbed water surfaces thus have significant and age-dependent effects on water strider locomotion, and on behavior more generally of surface-dwelling insects.",2017,10.1242/jeb.157172,220,15,2809-2815,NA,Aquarius remigis; Capillary waves; Dynamic surfaces; Bubbles; Surface roughness
article,Beat the heat: thermal respites and access to food associated with increased bumble bee heat tolerance,"Quinlan, Gabriela M. and Feuerborn, Cody and Hines, Heather M. and Grozinger, Christina M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Climate change poses a threat to organisms across the world, with cold-adapted species such as bumble bees (Bombus spp.) at particularly high risk. Understanding how organisms respond to extreme heat events associated with climate change as well as the factors that increase resilience or prime organisms for future stress can inform conservation actions. We investigated the effects of heat stress within different contexts (duration, periodicity, with and without access to food, and in the laboratory versus field) on bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) survival and heat tolerance. We found that both prolonged (5 h) heat stress and nutrition limitation were negatively correlated with worker bee survival and thermal tolerance. However, the effects of these acute stressors were not long lasting (no difference in thermal tolerance among treatment groups after 24 h). Additionally, intermittent heat stress, which more closely simulates the forager behavior of leaving and returning to the nest, was not negatively correlated with worker thermal tolerance. Thus, short respites may allow foragers to recover from thermal stress. Moreover, these results suggest there is no priming effect resulting from short- or long-duration exposure to heat - bees remained equally sensitive to heat in subsequent exposures. In field-caught bumble bees, foragers collected during warmer versus cooler conditions exhibited similar thermal tolerance after being allowed to recover in the lab for 16 h. These studies offer insight into the impacts of a key bumble bee stressor and highlight the importance of recovery duration, stressor periodicity and context on bumble bee thermal tolerance outcomes.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245924,226,17,NA,NA,Nutrition; Thermal response; Climate change; Heat hardening; Acclimatization; Heat priming
article,"Evidence for energy reallocation, not oxygen limitation, driving the deceleration in growth of adult fish","Skeeles, Michael R. and Clark, Timothy D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The lifetime growth of almost all fishes follows a biphasic relationship - juvenile growth is rapid and adult growth subsequently decelerates. For a trend that is so ubiquitous, there is no general agreement as to the underlying mechanisms causing adult growth to decelerate. Ongoing theories argue that adult growth slows because either the gills fail to supply the body with surplus oxygen needed for continued somatic gain (i.e. oxygen limited), or sexual maturation induces a switch in energy allocation towards reproduction and away from growth (i.e. energy limited). Here, we empirically tested these notions by tracking the individual growth trajectories of \& SIM;100 female Galaxias maculatus, ranging in size, during their first 3 months of adulthood. At a summer temperature of 20 \& DEG;C, we provided subsets of fish with additional energy (fed once versus twice a day), supplementary oxygen (normoxia versus hyperoxia), or a combination of the two, to assess whether we could change the trajectory of adult growth. We found that growth improved marginally with additional energy, yet remained unaffected by supplementary oxygen, thereby providing evidence for a role for energy reallocation in the deceleration of adult growth. Interestingly, additional dietary energy had a disproportionately larger effect on the growth of fish that matured at a greater size, revealing size-dependent variance in energy acquisition and/or allocation budgets at summer temperatures. Overall, these findings contribute towards understanding the mechanisms driving widespread declines in the body size of fish with climate warming.",2023,10.1242/jeb.246012,226,13,NA,jeb246012,Life history; Climate change; Gill-oxygen limitation theory (GOLT); Growth modelling; Energy allocation

Here, we show that the two species demonstrate distinctive building activity in a laboratory-controlled environment consisting of still air with low ambient humidity. In these conditions, M. michaelseni transports less soil from a central reservoir, deposits this soil over a smaller area, and creates structures with a smaller volumetric envelope than M. natalensis.

article,Limits to sustained energy intake. XXIII. Does heat dissipation capacity limit the energy budget of lactating bank voles?,"Sadowska, Edyta T. and Krol, Elzbieta and Chrzascik, Katarzyna M. and Rudolf, Agata M. and Speakman, John R. and Koteja, Pawel",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Understanding factors limiting sustained metabolic rate (SusMR) is a central issue in ecological physiology. According to the heat dissipation limit (HDL) theory, the SusMR at peak lactation is constrained by the maternal capacity to dissipate body heat. To test that theory, we shaved lactating bank voles (Myodes glareolus) to experimentally elevate their capacity for heat dissipation. The voles were sampled from lines selected for high aerobic exercise metabolism (A; characterized also by increased basal metabolic rate) and unselected control lines (C). Fur removal significantly increased the peak-lactation food intake (mass-adjusted least square means +/- s.e.; shaved: 16.3 +/- 0.3 g day(-1), unshaved: 14.4 +/- 0.2 g day(-1); P<0.0001), average daily metabolic rate (shaved: 109 +/- 2 kJ day(-1), unshaved: 97 +/- 2 kJ day(-1); P<0.0001) and metabolisable energy intake (shaved: 215 +/- 4 kJ day(-1), unshaved: 185 +/- 4 kJ day(-1); P<0.0001), as well as the milk energy output (shaved: 104 +/- 4 kJ day(-1); unshaved: 93 +/- 4 kJ day(-1); P=0.021) and litter growth rate (shaved: 9.4 +/- 0.7 g 4 days(-1), unshaved: 7.7 +/- 0.7 g 4 days(-1); P=0.028). Thus, fur removal increased both the total energy budget and reproductive output at the most demanding period of lactation, which supports the HDL theory. However, digestive efficiency was lower in shaved voles (76.0 +/- 0.3\%) than in unshaved ones (78.5 +/- 0.2\%; P<0.0001), which may indicate that a limit imposed by the capacity of the alimentary system was also approached. Shaving similarly affected the metabolic and reproductive traits in voles from the A and C lines. Thus, the experimental evolution model did not reveal a difference in the limiting mechanism between animals with inherently different metabolic rates.",2016,10.1242/jeb.134437,219,6,805-815,NA,Artificial selection; Doubly labelled water; Food consumption; Maternal investment; Milk energy output; Thermal conductance

GH-transgenic fish also display cardiorespiratory and metabolic modifications that accompany the increased growth rate. An elevated routine metabolic rate has been described for pre- and post-smolt GH-transgenic salmon that also display improvements in oxygen delivery to support the increased aerobic demand. The early ontogenic effects of GH transgenesis on the respiratory and cellular physiology of fish, especially during adverse environmental conditions, and the effect of polyploidy are unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of GH transgenesis and polyploidy on metabolic, heart and ventilation rates and heat shock protein (HSP) levels after exposure to acute hypoxia in post-hatch Atlantic salmon yolk-sac alevins. Metabolic rate decreased with decreasing partial pressures of oxygen in all genotypes. In normoxia, triploid transgenics displayed the highest mass-specific metabolic rates in comparison to diploid transgenics and non-transgenic triploids, which, in contrast, had higher rates than diploid non-transgenics. In hypoxia, we observed a lower mass-specific metabolic rate in diploid non-transgenics compared with all other genotypes. However, no evidence for improved O-2 uptake through heart or ventilation rate was found. Heart rate decreased in diploid non-transgenics while ventilation rate decreased in both diploid non-transgenics and triploid transgenics in severe hypoxia. Regardless of genotype or treatment, inducible HSP70 was not expressed in alevins. Following hypoxia, the constitutive isoform of HSP70, HSC70, decreased in transgenics and HSP90 expression decreased in all genotypes.

Anoxia-tolerant freshwater turtles show reduced mitochondrial respiratory capacity and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) after prolonged anoxia, but the mechanisms are unclear.

Transmission electron microscopy of heart ventricle revealed that these treatments did not affect mitochondrial volume density and morphology. Furthermore, neither enzyme activity, protein content nor supercomplex distribution of electron transport chain (ETC) enzymes changed significantly. Instead, our data imply that turtles inhibit mitochondrial respiration rate and ROS production by a cumulative effect of slight inhibition of ETC complexes.

article,Low incubation temperature slows the development of cold tolerance in a precocial bird,"Nord, Andreas and Nilsson, Jan-Ake",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Incubating birds trade off self-maintenance for keeping eggs warm. This causes lower incubation temperature in more challenging conditions, with consequences for a range of offspring traits. It is not yet clear how low developmental temperature affects cold tolerance early in life. This is ecologically important because before full thermoregulatory capacity is attained, precocial chicks must switch between foraging and being brooded when their body temperature declines. Hence, we studied how cold tolerance during conditions similar to a feeding bout in the wild was affected by incubation temperature in Japanese quail (Cotumix japonica). Cold-incubated (35.5 degrees C) chicks took the longest to develop, hatched at a smaller size, and remained smaller during their first week of life compared with chicks incubated at higher temperatures (37.0 and 38.5 degrees C). This was reflected in increased cooling rate and reduced homeothermy, probably on account of reductions in both heat-producing capacity and insulation. Lower cold tolerance could exacerbate other temperature-linked phenotypic effects and, hence, also the trade-off between future and current reproduction from the perspective of the incubating parent.",2021,10.1242/jeb.237743,224,1,NA,jeb237743,Body temperature; Development; Endothermy; Heterothermy; Life history; Poultry; Thermoregulation

Here, we used Atlantic killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus, to test this hypothesis. Hypoxia tolerance was measured as time to loss of equilibrium in hypoxia (LOEhyp) at 0.4 kPa oxygen. Time to LOEhyp declined from 73.3 +/- 6.9 min at 15 degrees C to 2.6 +/- 3.8 min at 23 degrees C, and at 30 degrees C no fish could withstand this level of hypoxia. Prior acclimation to warm temperatures significantly increased time to LOEhyp. Hypoxia tolerance of the southern subspecies of killifish, F. heteroclitus heteroclitus, was greater than that of the northern subspecies, F. heteroclitus macrolepidotus, measured both as critical oxygen tension (P-crit) and as time to LOEhyp. Warm acclimation offset the negative effects of temperature on time to LOEhyp to a similar extent in the two subspecies. Warm acclimation increased total lamellar surface area of the gill in both subspecies as a result of regression of an interlamellar cell mass (ILCM). However, differences in total lamellar surface area could not explain differences in time to LOEhyp between the subspecies, suggesting that the lower time to LOEhyp of northern fish is related to their higher routine metabolic rate. These data suggest that thermal plasticity in gill morphology can improve the capacity of this species to tolerate hypoxia, and shows how existing plasticity may help organisms to cope with the complex interacting stressors that they will encounter with increasing frequency as our climate changes.",2016,10.1242/jeb.133413,219,4,474-484,NA,Gill; Critical oxygen tension; Interlamellar cell mass; ILCM; Teleost; Temperature

Clara F. and Rosendale, Andrew J. and Lee, Jr., Richard E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"We investigated hibernation physiology and freeze tolerance in a population of the wood frog, Rana sylvatica, indigenous to Interior Alaska, USA, near the northernmost limit of the species' range. Winter acclimatization responses included a 233\% increase in the hepatic glycogen depot that was subsidized by fat body and skeletal muscle catabolism, and a rise in plasma osmolality that reflected accrual of urea (to 106+/-10 mu mol ml(-1)) and an unidentified solute (to similar to 73 mu mol ml(-1)). In contrast, frogs from a cool-temperate population (southern Ohio, USA) amassed much less glycogen, had a lower uremia (28+/-5 mu mol ml(-1)) and apparently lacked the unidentified solute. Alaskan frogs survived freezing at temperatures as low as -16 degrees C, some 10-13 degrees C below those tolerated by southern conspecifics, and endured a 2-month bout of freezing at -4 degrees C. The profound freeze tolerance is presumably due to their high levels of organic osmolytes and bound water, which limits ice formation. Adaptive responses to freezing (-2.5 degrees C for 48 h) and subsequent thawing (4 degrees C) included synthesis of the cryoprotectants urea and glucose, and dehydration of certain tissues. Alaskan frogs differed from Ohioan frogs in retaining a substantial reserve capacity for glucose synthesis, accumulating high levels of cryoprotectants in brain tissue, and remaining hyperglycemic long after thawing. The northern phenotype also incurred less stress during freezing/thawing, as indicated by limited cryohemolysis and lactate accumulation.

C. and Lechner, Emily R. and Brownscombe, Jacob W. and Raby, Graham D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Digestion can make up a substantial proportion of animal energy budgets, yet our understanding of how it varies with sex, body mass and ration size is limited. A warming climate may have consequences for animal growth and feeding dynamics that will differentially impact individuals in their ability to efficiently acquire and assimilate meals. Many species, such as walleye (Sander vitreus), exhibit sexual size dimorphism (SSD), whereby one sex is larger than the other, suggesting sex differences in energy acquisition and/or expenditure. Here, we present the first thorough estimates of specific dynamic action (SDA) in adult walleye using intermittentflow respirometry. We fed male (n=14) and female (n=9) walleye two ration sizes, 2\% and 4\% of individual body mass, over a range of temperatures from 2 to 20 degrees C. SDA was shorter in duration and reached higher peak rates of oxygen consumption with increasing temperature. Peak SDA increased with ration size and decreased with body mass. The proportion of digestible energy lost to SDA (i.e. the SDA coefficient) was consistent at 6\% and was unrelated to temperature, body mass, sex or ration size. Our findings suggest that sex has a negligible role in shaping SDA, nor is SDA a contributor to SSD for this species.

article,Dramatic changes in mitochondrial substrate use at critically high temperatures: a comparative study using <i>Drosophila</i>,"Jorgensen, Lisa Bjerregaard and Overgaard, Johannes and Hunter-Manseau, Florence and Pichaud, Nicolas",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Ectotherm thermal tolerance is critical to species distribution, but at present the physiological underpinnings of heat tolerance remain poorly understood. Mitochondrial function is perturbed at critically high temperatures in some ectotherms, including insects, suggesting that heat tolerance of these animals is linked to failure of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and/or ATP production. To test this hypothesis, we measured mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate in six Drosophila species with different heat tolerance using high-resolution respirometry. Using a substrate-uncoupler-inhibitor titration protocol, we examined specific steps of the electron transport system to study how temperatures below, bracketing and above organismal heat limits affect mitochondrial function and substrate oxidation. At benign temperatures (19 and 30 degrees C), complex I-supported respiration (CI-OXPHOS) was the most significant contributor to maximal OXPHOS. At higher temperatures (34, 38, 42 and 46 degrees C), CI-OXPHOS decreased considerably, ultimately to very low levels at 42 and 46 degrees C. The enzymatic catalytic capacity of complex I was intact across all temperatures and accordingly the decreased CI-OXPHOS is unlikely to be caused directly by hyperthermic denaturation/inactivation of complex I. Despite the reduction in CI-OXPHOS, maximal OXPHOS capacity was maintained in all species, through oxidation of alternative substrates - proline, succinate and, particularly, glycerol-3-phosphate suggesting important mitochondrial flexibility at temperatures exceeding the organismal heat limit. Interestingly, this failure of CI-OXPHOS and compensatory oxidation of alternative substrates occurred at temperatures that correlated with species heat tolerance, such that heat-tolerant species could defend `normal' mitochondrial function at higher temperatures than sensitive species. Future studies should investigate why CI-OXPHOS is perturbed and how this potentially affects ATP production rates.",2021,10.1242/jeb.240960,224,6,NA,jeb240960,Complex I; Mitochondrial flexibility; Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; Substrate control; Thermal sensitivity; Thermal tolerance
article,Thyroid hormone regulates cardiac performance during cold acclimation in zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>),"Little, Alexander G. and Seebacher, Frank",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Limitations to oxygen transport reduce aerobic scope and thereby activity at thermal extremes. Oxygen transport in fish is facilitated to a large extent by cardiac function so that climate variability may reduce fitness by constraining the performance of the heart. In zebrafish (Danio rerio), thyroid hormone (TH) regulates skeletal muscle function and metabolism in response to thermal acclimation. Here, we aimed to determine whether TH also regulates cardiac function during acclimation. We used propylthiouracil and iopanoic acid to induce hypothyroidism in zebrafish over a 3 week acclimation period to either 18 or 28 degrees C. We found that cold-acclimated fish had higher maximum heart rates and sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) activity than warm-acclimated fish. Hypothyroid treatment significantly decreased these responses in the cold-acclimated fish, but it did not affect the warm-acclimated fish. TH did not influence SERCA gene transcription, nor did it increase metabolic rate, of isolated whole hearts. To verify that physiological changes following hypothyroid treatment were in fact due to the action of TH, we supplemented hypothyroid fish with 3,5-diiodothryronine (T-2) or 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T-3). Supplementation of hypothyroid fish with T-2 or T-3 restored heart rate and SERCA activity to control levels. We also show that, in zebrafish, changes in cardiac output in response to warming are primarily mediated by heart rate, rather than by stroke volume. Thus, changes in heart rate are important for the overall aerobic capacity of the fish. In addition to its local effects on heart phenotype, we show that TH increases sympathetic tone on the heart at rest and during maximum exercise. Our findings reveal a new pathway through which fish can mitigate the limiting effects of temperature variability on oxygen transport to maintain aerobic scope and promote thermal tolerance.",2014,10.1242/jeb.096602,217,5,718-725,NA,Heart rate; Sympathetic tone; SERCA; Cardiac muscle; Temperature

This study investigated metabolic and behavioral interactions between two-band anemonefish (Amphiprion bicinctus) and bulb-tentacle sea anemones (Entacmaea quadricolor) at night. We measured the net dark oxygen uptake (VO2, mu mol O(2)h(-1)) of fish-anemone pairs when partners were separate from each other, together as a unit, and together as a unit but separated by a mesh screen that prevented physical contact. We also measured the effects of water current on sea anemone VO2 and quantified the nocturnal behaviors of fish in the absence and presence of host anemones in order to discern the impacts of anemone presence on fish behavior. Net VO2 of united pairs was significantly higher than that of both separated pairs and united pairs that were separated by a mesh screen. Anemone VO2 increased with flow rate from 0.5 to 2.0 cms(-1), after which VO2 remained constant up to a water flow rate of 8.0. cms(-1). Furthermore, the percentage time and bout frequency of flow-modulating behaviors by fish increased significantly when anemones were present.

article,Daily energy expenditure in the face of predation: hedgehog energetics in rural landscapes,"Pettett, Carly E. and Johnson, Paul J. and Moorhouse, Tom P. and Hambly, Catherine and Speakman, John R. and Macdonald, David W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Failure to balance daily energy expenditure (DEE) with energy intake can have an impact on survival and reproduction, and therefore on the persistence of populations. Here we study the DEE of the European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), which is declining in the UK. We hypothesise that there is a gradient of suitable habitat for hedgehogs in rural areas, which is a result of fewer food resources, a higher risk from predation by badgers (Meles meles) and colder ambient temperatures, as distance to the nearest building increases. We used the doubly labelled water method to obtain 44 measurements of DEE from hedgehogs on four predominately arable sites, to determine the energetic costs associated with proximity to buildings, on sites with and without badgers. The mean +/- s.e.m. DEE was 508.9 +/- 34.8 kJ day(-1). DEE increased the further a hedgehog was from buildings during the study, possibly as they ranged larger distances on arable land, supporting the hypothesis that hedgehogs select villages owing to the lower energy demands in comparison to arable farmland. Hedgehogs had an approximately 30\% lower DEE on sites with badgers. We speculate that on badger-occupied sites, hedgehogs may restrict movement and foraging in response to a threat from predation and thus have reduced DEE. Therefore, hedgehogs may also seek refuge in villages where the perceived threat of predation is lower and foraging is unrestricted. In a broader context, we demonstrate that individual differences in DEE can aid in understanding habitat selection in a patchily distributed species.",2017,10.1242/jeb.150359,220,3,460-468,NA,Arable farmland; Doubly labelled water; Landscape of fear; Meles meles; Predation risk
article,Acclimation to warm temperatures has important implications for mitochondrial function in Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>),"Gerber, Lucie and Clow, Kathy A. and Gamperl, Anthony K.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In fish. the capacity of thermal acclimation to preserve cardiac mitochondrial function under future warming scenarios is important to understand given the central roles that cardiac energy metabolism and performance play in this taxa's thermal tolerance. We acclimated Atlantic salmon to 12 and 20 degrees C (for >2 months), and investigated the effects of acute and chronic warming on cardiac mitochondrial respiration and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (release rate) using high-resolution fluorespirometry. Further, we compared the sensitivity of mitochondrial respiration to nitric oxide (i.e. the NO IC50), and assessed the mitochondrial response to anoxiareoxygenation (AR). Acute exposure to 20 degrees C increased maximal mitochondrial respiration by similar to 55\%; however, the mitochondria's complex I respiratory control ratio was 17\% lower and ROS production was increased by >= 60\%. Acclimation to 20 degrees C: (1) preserved mitochondrial coupling and aerobic capacity; (2) decreased the mitochondria's ROS production by similar to 30\%; (3) increased the mitochondria's NO IC50 by similar to 23\%; and (4) improved mitochondrial membrane integrity at 20 degrees C. AR did not affect mitochondrial function at 12 degrees C, but acute exposure to 20 degrees C and AR depressed maximal mitochondrial respiration (by similar to 9\%) and coupling (by similar to 16\%) without impacting ROS production. Finally, warm acclimation did not improve the capacity of mitochondria to recover from AR, indicating that there was no `cross-tolerance' between these challenges. Our findings provide compelling evidence that thermal plasticity of cardiac mitochondrial function contributes to the Atlantic salmon's capability to survive at >= 20 degrees C for prolonged periods, but call into question whether this plasticity may allow them to withstand high temperatures when combined with other stressors.",2021,10.1242/jeb.236257,224,2,NA,jeb236257,Anoxia-reoxygenation; Citrate synthase; Nitric oxide; Reactive oxygen species; Mitochondrial respiration; Superoxide dismutase
article,Cardiorespiratory physiology and swimming capacity of Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>) at cold temperatures,"Porter, Emma S. and Gamperl, A. Kurt",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"We investigated how acclimation to 8, 4 and 1 degrees C, and acute cooling from 8 to 1 degrees C, affected the Atlantic salmon's aerobic and anaerobic metabolism, and cardiac function, during a critical swim speed (U-crit) test. This study revealed several interesting temperature-dependent effects. First, while differences in resting heart rate ( f(H)) between groups were predictable based on previous research (range similar to 28-65 beats min(-1)), with values for 1 degrees C-acclimated fish slightly higher than those of acutely exposed conspecifics, the resting cardiac output (Q\_) of 1 degrees C-acclimated fish was much lower and compensated for by a higher resting blood oxygen extraction ( M. (O2)/Q\_). In contrast, the acutely exposed fish had a similar to 2-fold greater resting stroke volume (VS) compared with that of the other groups. Second, increases in f(H) (1.2-to 1.4-fold) contributed little to Q\_ during the U-crit test, and the contributions of \_Q (V-S) versusM. (O2)/Q\_ to aerobic scope (AS) were very different in the two groups tested at 1 degrees C (1 degrees C-acclimated and 8-1 degrees C fish). Finally, U-crit was 2.08 and 1.69 body lengths (BL) s(-1) in the 8 and 4 degrees C-acclimated groups, but only 1.27 and 1.44 BL s(-1) in the 1 degrees C-acclimated and 8-1 degrees C fish, respectively - this lower value in 1 degrees C versus 8-1 degrees C fish despite higher values for maximum metabolic rate and AS. These data: support recent studies which suggest that the capacity to increase fH is constrained at low temperatures; show that cardiorespiratory function at cold temperatures, and its response to increased demands, depends on exposure duration; and suggest that AS does not constrain swimming capacity in salmon when chronically exposed to temperatures approaching their lower limit.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245990,226,17,NA,jeb245990,Cold; Temperature; Acclimation; Cardiac function; Heart; Swimming; Oxygen extraction
article,"Basking hamsters reduce resting metabolism, body temperature and energy costs during rewarming from torpor","Geiser, Fritz and Gasch, Kristina and Bieber, Claudia and Stalder, Gabrielle L. and Gerritsmann, Hanno and Ruf, Thomas",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Basking can substantially reduce thermoregulatory energy expenditure of mammals. We tested the hypothesis that the largely white winter fur of hamsters (Phodopus sungorus), originating from Asian steppes, may be related to camouflage to permit sun basking on or near snow. Winter-acclimated hamsters in our study were largely white and had a high proclivity to bask when resting and torpid. Resting hamsters reduced metabolic rate (MR) significantly (>30\%) when basking at ambient temperatures (T-a) of similar to 15 and 0 degrees C. Interestingly, body temperature (T-b) also was significantly reduced from 34.7 +/- 0.6 degrees C (T-a 15 degrees C, not basking) to 30.4 +/- 2.0 degrees C (T-a 0 degrees C, basking), which resulted in an extremely low (<50\% of predicted) apparent thermal conductance. Induced torpor (food withheld) during respirometry at T-a 15 degrees C occurred on 83.3 +/- 36.0\% of days and the minimum torpor MR was 36\% of basal MR at an average T-b of 22.0 +/- 2.6 degrees C; movement to the basking lamp occurred at T-b<20.0 degrees C. Energy expenditure for rewarming was significantly reduced (by >50\%) during radiant heat-assisted rewarming; however, radiant heat per se without an endogenous contribution by animals did not strongly affect metabolism and T-b during torpor. Our data show that basking substantially modifies thermal energetics in hamsters, with a drop of resting T-b and MR not previously observed and a reduction of rewarming costs. The energy savings afforded by basking in hamsters suggest that this behaviour is of energetic significance not only for mammals living in deserts, where basking is common, but also for P. sungorus and probably other cold-climate mammals.",2016,10.1242/jeb.137828,219,14,2166-2172,NA,Phodopus; Passive warming; Energy conservation; Thermoregulation; Radiant heat
article,Maintenance of hindgut reabsorption during cold exposure is a key adaptation for <i>Drosophila</i> cold tolerance,"Andersen, Mads Kuhlmann and Overgaard, Johannes",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Maintaining extracellular osmotic and ionic homeostasis is crucial for organismal function. In insects, hemolymph volume and ion content is regulated by the secretory Malpighian tubules and reabsorptive hindgut. When exposed to stressful cold, homeostasis is gradually disrupted, characterized by a debilitating increase in extracellular K+ concentration (hyperkalemia). Accordingly, studies have found a strong link between species-specific cold tolerance and the ability to maintain ion and water homeostasis at low temperature. This is also true for drosophilids where inter- and intra-specific differences in cold tolerance are linked to the secretory capacity of Malpighian tubules. There is, however, little information on the reabsorptive capacity of the hindgut in Drosophila. To address this, we developed a novel method that permits continuous measurements of hindgut ion and fluid reabsorption in Drosophila. We demonstrate that this assay is temporally stable (similar to 2 h) and responsive to cAMP stimulation and pharmacological intervention in accordance with the current insect hindgut reabsorption model. We then investigated how cold acclimation or cold adaptation affected hindgut reabsorption at benign (24 degrees C) and low temperature (3 degrees C). Cold-tolerant Drosophila species and cold-acclimated D. melanogaster maintain superior fluid and Na+ reabsorption at low temperature. Furthermore, cold adaptation and acclimation caused a relative reduction in K+ reabsorption at low temperature. These characteristic responses of cold adaptation/acclimation will promote maintenance of ion and water homeostasis at low temperature. Our study of hindgut function therefore provides evidence that adaptations in the osmoregulatory capacity of insects are critical for their ability to tolerate cold.",2020,10.1242/jeb.213934,223,4,NA,jeb213934,Absorption; Acclimation; Adaptation; Assay; Ion transport; Rectum; Renal system; Temperature

To investigate molecular processes involved in the temporal response by bumble bees to acute cold exposure, we compared mRNA transcript abundance in Bombus impatiens workers exposed to 0 degrees C for 75 min (inducing chill coma) and control bees maintained at a constant ambient temperature (28 degrees C). We sequenced the 3 ` end of mRNA transcripts (TagSeq) to quantify gene expression in thoracic tissue of bees at several time points (0, 10, 30, 120 and 720 min) following cold exposure. Significant differences from control bees were only detectable within 30 min after the treatment, with most occurring at the 10 min recovery time point. Genes associated with gluconeogenesis and glycolysis were most notably upregulated, while genes related to lipid and purine metabolism were downregulated. The observed patterns of expression indicate a rapid recovery after chill coma, suggesting an acute differential transcriptional response during recovery from chill coma and return to baseline expression levels within an hour, with no long-term gene expression markers of this cold exposure. Our work highlights the functions and pathways important for acute cold recovery, provides an estimated time frame for recovery from cold exposure in bumble bees, and suggests that cold hardening may be less important for these heterothermic insects.",2024,10.1242/jeb.247040,227,9,NA,jeb247040,Pollinator; Climate; Chill coma; Metabolism; TagSeq; Differential gene expression
article,Flies on the rise: acclimation effect on mitochondrial oxidation capacity at normal and high temperatures in Drosophila melanogaster,"Blanchard, Arianne and Aminot, Melanie and Gould, Nathalie and Leger, Adele and Pichaud, Nicolas",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Increased average temperatures and extreme thermal events (such as heatwaves) brought forth by climate change impose important constraints on aerobic metabolism. Notably, mitochondrial metabolism, which is affected by both longand short-term temperature changes, has been put forward as an important determinant for thermal tolerance of organisms. This study examined the influence of phenotypic plasticity on metabolic and physiological parameters in Drosophila melanogaster and the link between mitochondrial function and their upper thermal limits. We showed that D. melanogaster acclimated to 15 degrees C have a 0.65 degrees C lower critical thermal maximum (CT max ) compared with those acclimated to 24 degrees C. Drosophila melanogaster acclimated to 15 degrees C exhibited a higher proportion of shorter saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, concomitant with lower proportions of polyunsaturated fatty acids. No mitochondrial quantitative changes (fractional area and number) were detected between acclimation groups, but changes of mitochondrial oxidation capacities were observed. Specifically, in both 15 degrees C- and 24 degrees C-acclimated flies, complex I-induced respiration was increased when measured between 15 and 24 degrees C, but drastically declined when measured at 40 degrees C. When succinate and glycerol-3-phosphate were added, this decrease was however compensated for in flies acclimated to 24 degrees C, suggesting an important impact of acclimation on mitochondrial function related to thermal tolerance. Our study reveals that the use of oxidative substrates at high temperatures is influenced by acclimation temperature and strongly related to upper thermal tolerance as a difference of 0.65 degrees C in CT max translates into significant mitochondrial changes.",2024,10.1242/jeb.247706,227,12,NA,jeb247706,Mitochondrial oxygen consumption; Acclimation; CT max; Insects; Fatty acids; Oxidative substrates; Mitochondrial density

Understanding how tolerance scales from individuals to species and quantifying adaptive potentials is essential to forecasting responses to warming. We reproductively crossed corals from a globally distributed species (Actopora tenuis) on the Great Barrier Reef (Australia) from three thermally distinct reefs to create 85 offspring lineages. Individuals were experimentally exposed to temperatures (27.5, 31 and 35.5 degrees C) in adult and two critical early life stages (larval and settlement) to assess acquired heat tolerance via outcrossing of offspring phenotypes by comparing five physiological responses (photosynthetic yields, bleaching, necrosis, settlement and survival). Adaptive potentials and physiological reaction norms were calculated across three stages to integrate heat tolerance at different biological scales. Selective breeding improved larval survival to heat by 1.5-2.5x but did not result in substantial enhancement of settlement, although population crosses were significantly different. Under heat stress, adults were less variable compared with larval responses in warmer reefs than in the cooler reef. Adults and offspring also differed in their mean population responses, likely underpinned by heat stress imposing strong divergent selection on adults. These results have implications for downstream selection during reproduction, evidenced by variability in a conserved heat tolerance response across offspring lineages. These results inform our ability to forecast the impacts of climate change on wild populations of corals and will aid in developing novel conservation tools such as the assisted evolution of at-risk species.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243344,225,"1, SI",NA,jeb243344,Thermal tolerance; Heritability; Coral reefs; Larvae; Settlement; Survival
article,Thermal performance curves for aerobic scope in a tropical fish (<i>Lates calcarifer</i>): flexible in amplitude but not breadth,"Scheuffele, Hanna and Rubio-Gracia, Francesc and Clark, Timothy D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Aerobic metabolic scope is a popular metric to estimate the capacity for temperature-dependent performance in aquatic animals. Despite this popularity, little is known of the role of temperature acclimation and variability in shaping the breadth and amplitude of the thermal performance curve for aerobic scope. If daily thermal experience can modify the characteristics of the thermal performance curve, interpretations of aerobic scope data from the literature may be misguided. Here, tropical barramundi (Lates calcarifer) were acclimated for similar to 4 months to cold (23 degrees C), optimal (29 degrees C) or warm (35 degrees C) conditions, or to a daily temperature cycle between 23 and 35 degrees C (with a mean of 29 degrees C). Measurements of aerobic scope were conducted every 3-4 weeks at three temperatures (23, 29 and 35 degrees C), and growth rates were monitored. Acclimation to constant temperatures caused some changes in aerobic scope at the three measurement temperatures via adjustments in standard and maximum metabolic rates, and growth rates were lower in the 23 degrees C-acclimated group than in all other groups. The metabolic parameters and growth rates of the thermally variable group remained similar to those of the 29 degrees C-acclimated group. Thus, acclimation to a variable temperature regime did not broaden the thermal performance curve for aerobic scope. We propose that thermal performance curves for aerobic scope are more plastic in amplitude than in breadth, and that the metabolic phenotype of at least some fish may be more dependent on the mean daily temperature than on the daily temperature range.",2021,10.1242/jeb.243504,224,24,NA,jeb243504,Metabolic rate; OCLTT; Temperature acclimation; Climate change; Thermal variability; Barramundi; Asian sea bass
article,"Metabolic suppression during protracted exposure to hypoxia in the jumbo squid, <i>Dosidicus gigas</i>, living in an oxygen minimum zone","Seibel, Brad A. and Haefker, N. Soeren and Truebenbach, Katja and Zhang, Jing and Tessier, Shannon N. and Poertner, Hans-Otto and Rosa, Rui and Storey, Kenneth B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The jumbo squid, Dosidicus gigas, can survive extended forays into the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) of the Eastern Pacific Ocean. Previous studies have demonstrated reduced oxygen consumption and a limited anaerobic contribution to ATP production, suggesting the capacity for substantial metabolic suppression during hypoxic exposure. Here, we provide a more complete description of energy metabolism and explore the expression of proteins indicative of transcriptional and translational arrest that may contribute to metabolic suppression. We demonstrate a suppression of total ATP demand under hypoxic conditions (1\% oxygen, P-O2=0.8 kPa) in both juveniles (52\%) and adults (35\%) of the jumbo squid. Oxygen consumption rates are reduced to 20\% under hypoxia relative to air-saturated controls. Concentrations of arginine phosphate (Arg-P) and ATP declined initially, reaching a new steady state (similar to 30\% of controls) after the first hour of hypoxic exposure. Octopine began accumulating after the first hour of hypoxic exposure, once Arg-P breakdown resulted in sufficient free arginine for substrate. Octopine reached levels near 30 mmol g(-1) after 3.4 h of hypoxic exposure. Succinate did increase through hypoxia but contributed minimally to total ATP production. Glycogenolysis in mantle muscle presumably serves to maintain muscle functionality and balance energetics during hypoxia. We provide evidence that post-translational modifications on histone proteins and translation factors serve as a primary means of energy conservation and that select components of the stress response are altered in hypoxic squids. Reduced ATP consumption under hypoxia serves to maintain ATP levels, prolong fuel store use and minimize the accumulation of acidic intermediates of anaerobic ATP-generating pathways during prolonged diel forays into the OMZ. Metabolic suppression likely limits active, daytime foraging at depth in the core of the OMZ, but confers an energetic advantage over competitors that must remain in warm, oxygenated surface waters. Moreover, the capacity for metabolic suppression provides habitat flexibility as OMZs expand as a result of climate change.",2014,10.1242/jeb.100487,217,14,2555-2568,NA,Climate change; Vertical migration; Ocean acidification; Critical oxygen partial pressure; Cephalopoda; Epigenetics; Stress response; Antioxidant; Metabolic scaling

Based on the conceptual model of `oxygen-and capacity-limited thermal tolerance', we measured critical thermal maximum (CTmax), maximum heart rate (f(H,max)) and aerobic scope to test the hypothesis that these rainbow trout can maintain aerobic scope at high temperatures through a robust cardiac performance supporting oxygen delivery. Across five family groups CTmax averaged 29.0 +/- 0.02 degrees C. Aerobic scope was maximized at 15.8 +/- 0.3 degrees C (T-opt), while the upper pejus temperature (T-pej, set at 90\% of maximum aerobic scope) was 19.9 +/- 0.3 degrees C. Although aerobic scope decreased at temperatures above T-opt, the value at 25 degrees C remained well over 40\% of the maximum. Furthermore, pharmacologically stimulated f(H,max) increased with temperature, reaching a peak value between 23.5 +/- 0.4 and 24.0 +/- 0.4 degrees C(T-max) for three family groups. The Arrhenius breakpoint temperature (T-AB) for f(H,max) was 20.3 +/- 0.3 to 20.7 +/- 0.4 degrees C, while the average Q(10) breakpoint temperature (T-QB, when the incremental Q(10)<1.6) for f(H,max) was 21.6 +/- 0.2 to 22.0 +/- 0.4 degrees C. Collectively, f(H,max) progressively became less temperature dependent beyond 20 degrees C (T-AB andT(QB)), which coincides with the upper T-pej for aerobic scope. Although upper thermal performance indices for both aerobic scope and f(H,max) were compared among family groups in this population, appreciable differences were not evident. Compared with other populations of rainbow trout, the present assessment is consistent with the prediction that this strain has undergone selection and shows the ability to tolerate higher water temperatures.",2015,10.1242/jeb.113993,218,5,803-812,NA,Aerobic scope; Critical thermal maximum; Heart rate; Metabolic rate; Temperature tolerance; Thermal adaptation

Yet, ecophysiological studies on arctic insects typically focus on the ability of species to tolerate low temperatures, whereas studies investigating physiological adaptations of species to periodically warm and variable temperatures are few. In this study, we investigated temporal changes in thermal tolerances and the transcriptome the Greenlandic seed bug Nysius groenlandicus, collected in the field across different times and temperatures in Southern Greenland. We found that plastic changes in heat and cold tolerances occurred rapidly (within hours) and at a daily scale in the field, and that these changes are correlated with diurnal temperature variation. Using RNA sequencing, we provide molecular underpinnings of the rapid adjustments in thermal tolerance across ambient field temperatures and in the laboratory. We show that transcriptional responses are sensitive to daily temperature changes, and days characterized by high temperature variation induced markedly different expression patterns than thermally stable days. Further, genes associated with laboratory-induced heat responses, including expression of heat shock proteins and vitellogenins, were shared across laboratory and field experiments, but induced at time points associated with lower temperatures in the field.

Two species were studied, Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and pacu (Piaractus mesopotamicus). Each fish underwent an incremental swim test to determine gait transition speed (U-GT), where it first engaged the unsteady anaerobic swimming mode that preceded fatigue. After suitable recovery, each fish was exercised at 85\% of their own U-GT and warmed 1 degrees C every 30 min, to identify the temperature at which they fatigued, denoted as CTswim. Fish were also submitted to a standard CTmax, warming at the same rate as CTswim, under static conditions until LOE. All individuals fatigued in CTswim, at a mean temperature approximately 2 degrees C lower than their CTmax. Therefore, if exposed to acute warming in the wild, the ability to perform aerobic metabolic work would be constrained at temperatures significantly below those that directly threatened survival. The collapse in performance at CTswim was preceded by a gait transition qualitatively indistinguishable from that during the incremental swim test. This suggests that fatigue in CTswim was linked to an inability to meet the tissue oxygen demands of exercise plus warming. This is consistent with the oxygen and capacity limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT) hypothesis, regarding the mechanism underlying tolerance of warming in fishes. Overall, fatigue at CTswim provides an ecologically relevant sub-lethal threshold that is more sensitive to extreme events than LOE at CTmax.",2020,10.1242/jeb.218602,223,9,NA,jeb218602,CTmax; Oreochromis niloticus; Piaractus mesopotamicus

Recent data on heterotherms inhabiting warmer regions, however, suggest that passive rewarming reduces the need of metabolic heat production during arousal significantly, leading to the question: to what extent do subtropical or tropical heterotherms depend on NST? The African lesser bushbaby, Galago moholi, enters torpid states as an emergency response only, but otherwise stays normothermic throughout the cold and dry winter season. In addition, this species shows unusual rewarming difficulties during arousal from torpor on cold days. We therefore examined the seasonal adjustments of the capacity for NST of naturally acclimatized G. moholi by stimulation with noradrenaline (NA) injection. Dissection of two adult female bushbabies revealed that G. moholi possesses brown adipose tissue, and NA treatment (0.5 mg.kg(-1), s.c.) induced a significant elevation in oxygen consumption compared with control (saline) injection. However, the increase in oxygen consumption following injection of NA was not significantly different between winter and summer. Our results show that the ability to produce heat via NST seems to be available throughout the year and that G. moholi is able to change NST capacity within a very short time frame in response to cold spells. Together with results from studies on other (Afro-)tropical heterotherms, which also indicate low or even absent seasonal difference in NST capacity, this raises the question of whether the definition of NST needs to be refined for (Afro-)tropical mammals.",2013,10.1242/jeb.089433,216,20,3811-3817,NA,nonshivering thermogenesis; primate; rewarming difficulties; (Afro-)tropical heterotherms; NST definition

On the East Coast of North America, two distinct lineages of the European green crab (Carcinus maenas) have been introduced in the last two centuries. These two lineages with putatively different adaptive properties have hybridized along the coast of the eastern Gulf of Maine, producing new nuclear and mitochondrial combinations that show clinal variation correlated with water temperature. To test the hypothesis that mitochondrial or nuclear genes have effects on thermal tolerance, we first measured the response to cold stress in crabs collected throughout the hybrid zone, then sequenced the mitochondrial CO1 gene and two nuclear single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) representative of nuclear genetic lineage. Mitochondrial haplotype had a strong association with the ability of crabs to right themselves at 4.5 degrees C that was sex specific: haplotypes originally from northern Europe gave male crabs an advantage while there was no haplotype effect on righting in female crabs. By contrast, the two nuclear SNPs that were significant outliers in a comparison between northern and southern C. maenas populations had no effect on righting response at low temperature. These results add C. maenas to the shortlist of ectotherms in which mitochondrial variation has been shown to affect thermal tolerance, and suggest that natural selection is shaping the structure of the hybrid zone across the Gulf of Maine. Our limited genomic sampling does not eliminate the strong possibility that mito-nuclear co-adaptation may play a role in the differences in thermal phenotypes documented here. Linkage between mitochondrial genotype and thermal tolerance suggests a role for local adaptation in promoting the spread of invasive populations of C. maenas around the world.",2019,10.1242/jeb.203521,222,17,NA,jeb203521,Cold tolerance; Gulf of Maine; Hybrid zone; Mitochondria; Mito-nuclear interactions; Natural selection; OCLTT model; Oxygen and capacity-limited thermal tolerance

Therefore, we evaluated the effect of different temperatures (15, 25 and 30 degrees C) on the cardiorespiratory rates and cardiac autonomic tonus of premetamorphic tadpoles of the bullfrog, Lithobates catesbeianus. To this end, a non-invasive method was developed to permit measurements of electrocardiogram (ECG) and buccal movements (f(B); surface electromyography of the buccal floor). For evaluation of autonomic regulation, intraperitoneal injections of Ringer solution (control), atropine (cholinergic muscarinic antagonist) and sotalol (beta-adrenergic antagonist) were performed. Ringer solution injections did not affect heart rate (fH) or fB across temperatures.

In conclusion, the cholinergic and adrenergic tones seem to be independent of temperature for colder thermal intervals (15-25 degrees C), while exposure to a hotter ambient temperature (30 degrees C) seems to be followed by a significant increase in adrenergic tone and may reflect cardiovascular adjustments made to match oxygen delivery to demand.

We studied the relationship between macronutrient ingestion, RER and lipid synthesis using South American locusts (Schistocerca cancellata) reared on artificial diets varying in protein: carbohydrate (p:c) ratio. RER increased and rose above 1 as dietary p:c ratio decreased. Lipid accumulation rates were strongly positively correlated with dietary carbohydrate content and ingestion.

Thus, mussels were exposed sequentially to two different phases (heat hardening and acclimation phases). To gain further insight into the possible mechanisms underlying the metabolic response of the heat-hardened M. galloprovincialis, metabolomics analysis was complemented by the estimation of mRNA expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), pyruvate kinase (PK) and alternative oxidase (AOX) implicated in the metabolic pathways of gluconeogenesis, glycolysis and redox homeostasis, respectively. Heat-hardened mussels showed evidence of higher activity of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and diversification of upregulated metabolic pathways, possibly as a mechanism to increase ATP production and extend survival under heat stress. Moreover, formate and taurine accumulation provide an antioxidant and cytoprotective role in mussels during hypoxia and thermal stress. Overall, the metabolic responses in non-heat-hardened and heat-hardened mussels underline the upper thermal limits of M. galloprovincialis, set at 26 degrees C, and are in accordance with the OCLTT concept. The ability of heat-hardened mussels to undergo a rapid gain and slow loss of heat tolerance may be an advantageous strategy for coping with intermittent and often extreme temperatures.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244795,225,24,NA,jeb244795,Gene expression; Heat hardening; 1H-NMR spectroscopy; Metabolomics; Metabolic patterns; Mussel
article,Water loss in tree weta (<i>Hemideina</i>): adaptation to the montane environment and a test of the melanisation-desiccation resistance hypothesis,"King, Keith J. and Sinclair, Brent J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Montane insects are at a higher risk of desiccation than their lowland counterparts and are expected to have evolved reduced water loss. Hemideina spp. (tree weta; Orthoptera: Anostostomatidae) have both lowland (Hemideina femorata, Hemideina crassidens and Hemideina thoracica) and montane (Hemideina maori and Hemideina ricta) species. H. maori has both melanic and yellow morphs. We use these weta to test two hypotheses: that montane insects lose water more slowly than lowland species, and that cuticular water loss rates are lower in darker insects than lighter morphs, because of incorporation of melanin in the cuticle. We used flow-through respirometry to compare water loss rates among Hemideina species and found that montane weta have reduced cuticular water loss by 45\%, reduced respiratory water loss by 55\% and reduced the molar ratio of (V)over dotH(2)O:(V)over dotCO(2) by 64\% compared with lowland species. Within H. maori, cuticular water loss was reduced by 46\% when compared with yellow morphs. Removal of cuticular hydrocarbons significantly increased total water loss in both melanic and yellow morphs, highlighting the role that cuticular hydrocarbons play in limiting water loss; however, the dark morph still lost water more slowly after removal of cuticular hydrocarbons (57\% less), supporting the melanisation-desiccation resistance hypothesis.",2015,10.1242/jeb.118711,218,13,1995-2004,NA,Cuticular water loss; Montane; Melanism; Desiccation resistance; Alpine
article,Nesting behaviour influences species-specific gas exchange across avian eggshells,"Portugal, Steven J. and Maurer, Golo and Thomas, Gavin H. and Hauber, Mark E. and Grim, Tomas and Cassey, Phillip",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Carefully controlled gas exchange across the eggshell is essential for the development of the avian embryo. Water vapour conductance (G(H2O)) across the shell, typically measured as mass loss during incubation, has been demonstrated to optimally ensure the healthy development of the embryo while avoiding desiccation. Accordingly, eggs exposed to sub-optimal gas exchange have reduced hatching success. We tested the association between eggshell G(H2O) and putative life-history correlates of adult birds, ecological nest parameters and physical characteristics of the egg itself to investigate how variation in G(H2O) has evolved to maintain optimal water loss across a diverse set of nest environments. We measured gas exchange through eggshell fragments in 151 British breeding bird species and fitted phylogenetically controlled, general linear models to test the relationship between G(H2O) and potential predictor parameters of each species. Of our 17 life-history traits, only two were retained in the final model: wet-incubating parent and nest type. Eggs of species where the parent habitually returned to the nest with wet plumage had significantly higher G(H2O) than those of parents that returned to the nest with dry plumage. Eggs of species nesting in ground burrows, cliffs and arboreal cups had significantly higher G(H2O) than those of species nesting on the ground in open nests or cups, in tree cavities and in shallow arboreal nests. Phylogenetic signal (measured as Pagel's.) was intermediate in magnitude, suggesting that differences observed in the G(H2O) are dependent upon a combination of shared ancestry and species-specific life history and ecological traits. Although these data are correlational by nature, they are consistent with the hypothesis that parents constrained to return to the nest with wet plumage will increase the humidity of the nest environment, and the eggs of these species have evolved a higher G(H2O) to overcome this constraint and still achieve optimal water loss during incubation. We also suggest that eggs laid in cup nests and burrows may require a higher G(H2O) to overcome the increased humidity as a result from the confined nest microclimate lacking air movements through the nest. Taken together, these comparative data imply that species-specific levels of gas exchange across avian eggshells are variable and evolve in response to ecological and physical variation resulting from parental and nesting behaviours.",2014,10.1242/jeb.103291,217,18,3326-3332,NA,Avian eggshells; Life history; Museum specimens; Nest environment; Permeability
article,Calorespirometry reveals that goldfish prioritize aerobic metabolism over metabolic rate depression in all but near-anoxic environments,"Regan, Matthew D. and Gill, Ivan S. and Richards, Jeffrey G.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Metabolic rate depression (MRD) has long been proposed as the key metabolic strategy of hypoxic survival, but surprisingly, the effects of changes in hypoxic O-2 tensions (PwO(2)) on MRD are largely unexplored. We simultaneously measured the O-2 consumption rate (MO2) and metabolic heat of goldfish using calorespirometry to test the hypothesis that MRD is employed at hypoxic PwO(2) values and initiated just below P-crit, the PwO(2) below which MO2 is forced to progressively decline as the fish oxyconforms to decreasing PwO(2). Specifically, we used closed-chamber and flow-through calorespirometry together with terminal sampling experiments to examine the effects of PwO(2) and time on MO2, metabolic heat and anaerobic metabolism (lactate and ethanol production). The closedchamber and flow-through experiments yielded slightly different results. Under closed-chamber conditions with a continually decreasing PwO(2), goldfish showed a Pcrit of 3.0 +/- 0.3 kPa and metabolic heat production was only depressed at PwO(2) between 0 and 0.67 kPa. Under flow-through conditions with PwO(2) held at a variety of oxygen tensions for 1 and 4 h, goldfish also initiated MRD between 0 and 0.67 kPa but maintained MO2 to 0.67 kPa, indicating that Pcrit is at or below this PwO(2). Anaerobic metabolism was strongly activated at PwO(2) <= 1.3 kPa, but only used within the first hour at 1.3 and 0.67 kPa, as anaerobic end-products did not accumulate between 1 and 4 h exposure. Taken together, it appears that goldfish reserve MRD for near-anoxia, supporting routine metabolic rate at sub-Pcrit PwO(2) values with the help of anaerobic glycolysis in the closed-chamber experiments, and aerobically after an initial (<1 h) activation of anaerobic metabolism in the flow-through experiments, even at 0.67 kPa PwO(2).",2017,10.1242/jeb.145169,220,4,564-572,NA,Calorespirometry; Critical oxygen tension; Environmental hypoxia; Fish; Metabolic depression; Metabolic heat
article,"Wading through water: effects of water depth and speed on the drag and kinematics of walking Chilean flamingos, <i>Phoenicopterus chilensis</i>","Palecek, Amanda M. and Novak, V, Megan and Blob, Richard W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Wading behaviours, in which an animal walks while partially submerged in water, are present in a variety of taxa including amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds. Despite the ubiquity of wading behaviours, few data are available to evaluate how animals adjust their locomotion to accommodate changes in water depth. Because drag from water might impose additional locomotor costs, wading animals might be expected to raise their feet above the water up to a certain point until such behaviours lead to awkward steps and are abandoned. To test for such mechanisms, we measured drag on models of the limbs of Chilean flamingos (Phoenicopterus chilensis) and measured their limb and body kinematics as they walked and waded through increasing depths of water in a zoo enclosure. Substantial drag was incurred by models of both open- and closed-toed feet, suggesting that flamingos could avoid some locomotor costs by stepping over water, rather than through it, during wading. Step height was highest while wading through intermediate water depths and while wading at a faster speed. Stride length increased with increasing water depth and velocity, and the limb joints generally flexed more while moving through intermediate water depths. However, movements of the head and neck were not strongly correlated with water depth or velocity. Our results show a wide range of kinematic changes that occur to allow wading birds to walk through different water depths, and have implications for better understanding the locomotor strategies employed by semi-aquatic species.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242988,224,19,NA,jeb242988,Biomechanics; Locomotion; Bird; Semi-aquatic; Limb
article,Western and Clark's grebes use novel strategies for running on water,"Clifton, Glenna T. and Hedrick, Tyson L. and Biewener, Andrew A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Few vertebrates run on water. The largest animals to accomplish this feat are western and Clark's grebes (Aechmophorus occidentalis and Aechmophorus clarkii). These birds use water running to secure a mate during a display called rushing. Grebes weigh an order of magnitude more than the next largest water runners, basilisk lizards (Basilicus basiliscus), and therefore face a greater challenge to support their body weight. How do these birds produce the hydrodynamic forces necessary to overcome gravity and sustain rushing? We present the first quantitative study of water running by grebes. High-speed video recordings elucidate the hindlimb movements of grebes rushing in the wild. We complement these findings with laboratory experiments using physical models and a preserved grebe foot to estimate how slapping the water surface contributes to weight support. Our results indicate that grebes use three novel tactics to successfully run on water. First, rushing grebes use exceptionally high stride rates, reaching 10 Hz. Second, grebe foot size and high water impact speed allow grebes to generate up to 30-55\% of the required weight support through water slap alone. Finally, flattened foot bones reduce downward drag, permitting grebes to retract each foot from the water laterally. Together, these mechanisms outline a water-running strategy qualitatively different from that of the only previously studied water runner, the basilisk lizard. The hydrodynamic specializations of rushing grebes could inform the design of biomimetic appendages. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying this impressive display demonstrate that evolution can dramatically alter performance under sexual selection.",2015,10.1242/jeb.118745,218,8,1235-1243,NA,Aechmophorus occidentalis; Aechmophorus clarkii; Biomechanics; Kinematics; Running; Water

This euryhaline teleost lacks both a stomach and the capacity for Cl-uptake at the gills in freshwater. PEG-4000 appearance in the water was minimal up to 10-11 h post-feeding, indicating the virtual absence of Na+ and Cl- loss in the faeces up until this time. Rapid uptake of dietary Na+ and Cl- occurred and more than 88\% of Na-22(+) and Cl-36(-) were absorbed in the intestine by 3 h post-feeding; excretion rates of Na+ and Cl-originating from the food were greatest during this period. Uptake and excretion of Cl-from the diet was fivefold to sixfold greater than that of Na+ in freshwater, and approximately threefold greater in seawater. Excretions of dietary Na+ and Cl- by seawater-acclimated killifish were far greater than by freshwater-acclimated killifish in this time frame, reflecting the much greater branchial efflux rates and turnover rates of the internal exchangeable pools. At both 3 and 9 h post-feeding, the largest fraction of dietary Na+ was found in the carcass of freshwater-acclimated fish, followed by the external water, and finally the digestive tract. However, in seawater-acclimated fish, more was excreted to the water, and less was retained in the carcass. For Cl-, which was taken up and excreted more rapidly than Na+, the majority of the dietary load had moved to the external water by 9 h in both freshwater and seawater animals. After 7 days training on a low-salt natural diet (live Lumbriculus variegatus worms; 31.5 mu mol. Na+ g(-1) wet mass) versus a high-salt synthetic pellet diet (911 mu mol. Na+ g(-1) dry food mass), freshwater killifish exhibited a lower absolute excretion rate of Na+ from the low-salt diet, but relative uptake from the intestine and retention in the carcass were virtually identical from the two diets. Seawater killifish excreted relatively more Na+ from the low-salt diet. Overall, our results emphasize the importance of dietary Na+ and Cl- in the electrolyte economy of the killifish, particularly in freshwater, and especially for Cl-.",2013,10.1242/jeb.084228,216,20,3925-3936,NA,intestine; gills; ion flux rates; chloride uptake; ionoregulation; feeding; defaecation
article,Are individuals consistent? Endocrine reaction norms under different ecological challenges,"Baldan, Davide and Negash, Mekail and Ouyang, Jenny Q.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Quantifying organismal capacity for compensatory mechanisms is essential to forecast responses to environmental change. Despite accumulating evidence for individual variation in physiological plasticity, the causes and consequences of this variation remain unclear. An outstanding question is whether individual reaction norms are consistent across different environmental challenges, i.e. whether an individual that is responsive to one environmental variable will be equally responsive to a different environmental variable. Additionally, are these reaction norms themselves consistent over time, i.e. repeatable? Here, we quantified individual baseline glucocorticoid responses in house sparrows, Passer domesticus, to sequential manipulations of temperature, wind speed and food unpredictability that were repeated in discrete blocks of sampling under both control and stressor-exposed conditions. Individuals significantly decreased their baseline corticosterone levels and increased their mass during treatment exposure. This response was consistent across environmental challenge types. There was high repeatability in the intercept and slope of the baseline corticosterone reaction norm between environmental challenges but broad credible intervals in the repeatability of the reaction normslope, suggesting that although glucocorticoid levels during baseline conditions are repeatable, among-individual variation in the shape of the glucocorticoid response may be higher than within-individual variation. Within-subject variation in baseline corticosterone levels was mainly explained by within-individual variation in body mass during stressor exposure. Despite the high lability in physiological traits, endocrine plasticity is repeatable across environmental challenges and may be able to evolve as a result of genetic accommodation, in which selection acts on genetic variation of reaction norms.",2021,10.1242/jeb.240499,224,12,NA,jeb240499,Glucocorticoids; Corticosterone; House sparrows; Wind; Temperature; Food unpredictability

The outcomes of these activities can differ according to environmental context. In a series of laboratory experiments with diapausing eggs of the water flea Daphnia magna, we manipulated two environmental parameters, temperature and presence of bacteria, and examined their effect on development. At elevated temperatures (>= 26 degrees C), resting eggs developing without live bacteria had reduced hatching success and correspondingly higher rates of severe morphological abnormalities compared with eggs with bacteria in their environment. The beneficial effect of bacteria was strongly reduced at 20 degrees C. Neither temperature nor the presence of bacteria affected directly developing parthenogenetic eggs.

We investigated how stress resistance is affected and compensated for by diet across life stages in the manila fruit fly Ceratitis cosyra (Diptera: Tephritidae). Larvae were fed diets containing either 8\% torula yeast, the standard diet used to rear this species, or 1\% yeast (low protein content similar to known host fruit). At emergence, adults from each larval diet were tested for initial mass, water content, body composition, and desiccation and starvation resistance or they were allocated to one of two adult diet treatments: sucrose only, or sucrose and yeast hydrolysate. The same assays were then repeated after 10 days of adult feeding. Development on a low protein larval diet led to lower body mass and improved desiccation and starvation resistance in newly emerged adults, even though adults from the high protein larval diet had the highest water content. Adult feeding decreased desiccation or starvation resistance, regardless of the diet provided. Irrespective of larval diet history, newly emerged, unfed adults had significantly higher dehydration tolerance than those that were fed. Lipid reserves played a role in starvation resistance. There was no evidence for metabolic water from stored nutrients extending desiccation resistance. Our findings show the possibility of a nutrient-poor larval environment leading to correlated improvement in adult performance, at least in the short term.",2019,10.1242/jeb.192534,222,6,NA,jeb192534,Body composition; Dehydration tolerance; Desiccation resistance; Diet; Starvation resistance; Water content

F. and Val, Adalberto L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Oscars are often subjected to a combination of low levels of oxygen and fasting during nest-guarding on Amazonian floodplains. We questioned whether this anorexia would aggravate the osmo-respiratory compromise. We compared fed and fasted oscars (10-14 days) in both normoxia and hypoxia (10-20 Torr, 4 h). Routine oxygen consumption rates ((M) over dot(O2)) were increased by 75\% in fasted fish, reflecting behavioural differences, whereas fasting improved hypoxia resistance and critical oxygen tensions (P-crit) lowered from 54 Torr in fed fish to 34 Torr when fasting. In fed fish, hypoxia reduced liver lipid stores by approximately 50\% and total liver energy content by 30\%. Fasted fish had a 50\% lower hepatosomatic index, resulting in lower total liver protein, glycogen and lipid energy stores under normoxia. Compared with hypoxic fed fish, hypoxic fasted fish only showed reduced liver protein levels and even gained glycogen (+50\%) on a per gram basis. This confirms the hypothesis that hypoxia-tolerant fish protect their glycogen stores as much as possible as a safeguard for more prolonged hypoxic events. In general, fasted fish showed lower hydroxyacyICoA dehydrogenase activities compared with fed fish, although this effect was only significant in hypoxic fasted fish. Energy stores and activities of enzymes related to energy metabolism in muscle or gills were not affected. Branchial Na+ uptake rates were more than two times lower in fed fish, whereas Na+ efflux was similar. Fed and fasted fish quickly reduced Na+ uptake and efflux during hypoxia, with fasting fish responding more rapidly. Ammonia excretion and K+ efflux were reduced under hypoxia, indicating decreased transcellular permeability. Fasted fish had more mitochondria-rich cells (MRC), with larger crypts, indicating the increased importance of the branchial uptake route when feeding is limited. Gill MRC density and surface area were greatly reduced under hypoxia, possibly to reduce ion uptake and efflux rates. Density of mucous cells of normoxic fasted fish was approximately fourfold of that in fed fish. Overall, a 10-14 day fasting period had no negative effects on hypoxia tolerance in oscars, as fasted fish were able to respond more quickly to lower oxygen levels, and reduced branchial permeability effectively.",2013,10.1242/jeb.082891,216,24,4590-4600,NA,respiration; critical oxygen tension; energy metabolism; ionoregulation; ion flux

The two species express the rhodopsin orthologs Aaop8 and Agop8, respectively, in a large subset of these R7 photoreceptors that function as ultraviolet receptors. We show here that a divergent subfamily of mosquito rhodopsins, Aaop10 and Agop10, is coexpressed in these R7 photoreceptors. The properties of the A. aegypti Aaop8 and Aaop10 rhodopsins were analyzed by creating transgenic Drosophila expressing these rhodopsins. Electroretinogram recordings, and spectral analysis of head extracts, obtained from the Aaop8 strain confirmed that Aaop8 is an ultraviolet-sensitive rhodopsin. Aaop10 was poorly expressed and capable of eliciting only small and slow light responses in Drosophila photoreceptors, and electroretinogram analysis suggested that it is a long-wavelength rhodopsin with a maximal sensitivity near 500 nm. Thus, coexpression of Aaop10 rhodopsin with Aaop8 rhodopsin has the potential to modify the spectral properties of mosquito ultraviolet receptors. Retention of Op10 rhodopsin family members in the genomes of Drosophila species suggests that this rhodopsin family may play a conserved role in insect vision.",2014,10.1242/jeb.096347,217,6,1003-1008,NA,Mosquito vision; Photoreceptor; UV sensitivity; Visual pigment; Rhodopsin coexpression
article,Avian torpor or alternative thermoregulatory strategies for overwintering?,"Douglas, Tegan K. and Cooper, Christine E. and Withers, Philip C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"It is unclear whether torpor really is uncommon amongst passerine birds. We therefore examined body temperature and thermoregulatory strategies of an Austral passerine, the white-browed babbler (Pomatostomus superciliosus), which has characteristics related to a high probability of torpor use; it is a sedentary, insectivorous, cooperative breeding species, which we studied during winter in a temperate habitat. Wild, free-living babblers maintained normothermy overnight, even at sub-zero ambient temperatures, with a mean minimum body temperature of 38.5 +/- 0.04 degrees C that was independent of minimum black bulb temperature. Physiological variables measured in the laboratory revealed that babblers had a lowbasalmetabolic rate and evaporative water loss, but their body temperature and thermal conductance were typical of those of other birds and they had a typical endothermic response to low ambient temperature. Huddling yielded significant energy savings at low temperatures and a roost nest created a microclimate that buffered against low temperatures. Low basal energy requirements, communal roosting and the insulation of a roost nest confer sufficient energetic benefits, allowing babblers tomeet energy requirements without resorting to heterothermia, even in their depauperate, low-productivity landscape, suggesting that passerine birds use alternatives to torpor to balance their energy budgets when possible.",2017,10.1242/jeb.154633,220,7,1341-1349,NA,Temperature telemetry; Heterothermia; Body temperature; Respirometry; Metabolic rate; Evaporative water loss
article,Lipid composition and molecular interactions change with depth in the avian stratum corneum to regulate cutaneous water loss,"Champagne, Alex M. and Allen, Heather C. and Williams, Joseph B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The outermost 10-20 mu m of the epidermis, the stratum corneum (SC), consists of flat, dead cells embedded in a matrix of intercellular lipids. These lipids regulate cutaneous water loss (CWL), which accounts for over half of total water loss in birds. However, the mechanisms by which lipids are able to regulate CWL and how these mechanisms change with depth in the SC are poorly understood. We used attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) to measure lipid-lipid and lipid-water interactions as a function of depth in the SC of house sparrows (Passer domesticus Linnaeus) in the winter and summer. We then compared these molecular interactions at each depth with lipid composition at the same depth. We found that in both groups, water content increased with depth in the SC, and likely contributed to greater numbers of gauche defects in lipids in deeper levels of the SC. In winter-caught birds, which had lower rates of CWL than summer-caught birds, water exhibited stronger hydrogen bonding in deeper layers of the SC, and these strong hydrogen bonds were associated with greater amounts of polar lipids such as ceramides and cerebrosides. Based on these data, we propose a model by which polar lipids in deep levels of the SC form strong hydrogen bonds with water molecules to increase the viscosity of water and slow the permeation of water through the SC.",2015,10.1242/jeb.125310,218,19,3032-3041,NA,Lipids; Skin; Infrared spectroscopy; Birds; Tape stripping
article,Swim and fly: escape strategy in neustonic and planktonic copepods,"Svetlichny, Leonid and Larsen, Poul S. and Kiorboe, Thomas",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Copepods can respond to predators by powerful escape jumps that in some surface-dwelling forms may propel the copepod out of the water. We studied the kinematics and energetics of submerged and out-of-water jumps of two neustonic pontellid copepods, Anomalocera patersoni and Pontella mediterranea, and one pelagic calanoid copepod, Calanus helgolandicus (euxinus). We show that jumping out of the water does not happen just by inertia gained during the copepod's acceleration underwater, but also requires the force generated by the thoracic limbs when breaking through the water's surface to overcome surface tension, drag and gravity. The timing of this appears to be necessary for success. At the moment of breaking the water interface, the instantaneous velocity of the two pontellids reached 125 cm s(-1), while their maximum underwater speed (115 cm s(-1)) was close to that of similarly sized C. helgolandicus (106 cm s(-1)). The average specific power produced by the two pontellids during out-of-water jumps (1700-3300 W kg(-1) muscle mass) was close to that during submerged jumps (900-1600 W kg(-1) muscle mass) and, in turn, similar to that produced during submerged jumps of C. helgolandicus (1300 W kg(-1) muscle mass). The pontellids may shake off water adhering to their body by repeated strokes of the limbs during flight, which leads to a slight acceleration in the air. Our observations suggest that out-of-water jumps of pontellids are not dependent on any exceptional ability to perform this behavior but have the same energetic cost and are based on the same kinematic patterns and contractive capabilities of muscles as those of copepods swimming submerged.",2018,10.1242/jeb.167262,221,2,NA,jeb167262,Copepoda; Escape velocity; Acceleration; Muscle power; Out-of-water jumps

However, visual systems of Lacertidae have rarely been studied and the spectral sensitivity of their retinal photoreceptors remains unknown. Here, we characterise the spectral sensitivity of two Lacertid species from contrasting habitats: the wall lizard Podarcis muralis and the common lizard Zootoca vivipara. Both species possess a pure-cone retina with one spectral class of double cones and four spectral classes of single cones. The two species differ in the spectral sensitivity of the LWS cones, the relative abundance of UVS single cones (potentially more abundant in Z. vivipara) and the coloration of oil droplets. Wall lizards have pure vitamin A1-based photopigments, whereas common lizards possess mixed vitamin A1 and A2 photopigments, extending spectral sensitivity into the near infrared, which is a rare feature in terrestrial vertebrates. We found that spectral sensitivity in the UV and near infrared improves discrimination of small variations in throat coloration among Z. vivipara. Thus, retinal specialisations optimise chromatic resolution in common lizards, indicating that the visual system and visual signals might co-evolve.",2015,10.1242/jeb.115923,218,3,458-465,NA,Colour vision; Chromatic resolution; UV sensitivity; Vitamin A1/A2-based pigments; Cone abundance; Zootoca vivipara; Podarcis muralis

We tested the hypothesis that epicatechin overcomes the suppressive effects of the stressor on LTM formation in the continued presence of the stressor. Snails trained in lowcalcium pond water exhibit learning but not LTM. Epicatechin (15 mg l(-1)) in control pond water enhances LTM formation.

The HVR is an effective mechanism to increase O-2 uptake, but at a high metabolic cost. Therefore, when hypoxia becomes severe enough, ventilation declines, as its benefit is diminished. The water oxygen partial pressure (Pw(O2)) at which this decline occurs is expected to be near the critical Pw(O2) (P-crit), the Pw(O2) at which O-2 consumption begins to decline. Our results indicate that in zebrafish (Danio rerio), the relationship between peak HVR and P-crit is dependent on developmental stage. Peak ventilation occurred at Pw(O2) values higher than P-crit in larvae, but at a Pw(O2) significantly lower than P-crit in adults. Larval zebrafish use cutaneous respiration to a greater extent than branchial respiration and the cost of sustaining the HVR may outweigh the benefit, whereas adult zebrafish, which rely on branchial respiration, may benefit from using HVR at Pw(O2) below P-crit.",2020,10.1242/jeb.213942,223,7,NA,jeb213942,Hypoxia; Ventilation; Hypoxic ventilatory response; Critical O-2 tension
article,Physiological and metabolic consequences of viral infection in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>,"Arnold, Pieter A. and Johnson, Karyn N. and White, Craig R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"An extensively used model system for investigating anti-pathogen defence and innate immunity involves Drosophila C virus (DCV) and Drosophila melanogaster. While there has been a significant effort to understand infection consequences at molecular and genetic levels, an understanding of fundamental higher-level physiology of this system is lacking. Here, we investigate the metabolic rate, locomotory activity, dry mass and water content of adult male flies injected with DCV, measured over the 4. days prior to virus-induced mortality. DCV infection resulted in multiple pathologies, notably the depression of metabolic rate beginning 2. days post-infection as a response to physiological stress. Even in this depressed metabolic state, infected flies did not decrease their activity until 1. day prior to mortality, which further suggests that cellular processes and synthesis are disrupted because of viral infection. Growth rate was also reduced, indicating that energy partitioning is altered as infection progresses. Microbial infection in insects typically results in an increase in excretion; however, water appeared to be retained in DCV-infected flies. We hypothesise that this is due to a fluid intake-output imbalance due to disrupted transport signalling and a reduced rate of metabolic processing. Furthermore, infected flies had a reduced rate of respiration as a consequence of metabolic depression, which minimised water loss, and the excess mass as a result of water retention is concurrent with impaired locomotory ability. These findings contribute to developing a mechanistic understanding of how pathologies accumulate and lead to mortality in infected flies.",2013,10.1242/jeb.088138,216,17,3350-3357,NA,Drosophila C virus; DCV; metabolism; digestion; mass; locomotion
article,Novel and potential physiological roles of vacuolar-type H<SUP>+</SUP>-ATPase in marine organisms,"Tresguerres, Martin",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (VHA) is a multi-subunit enzyme that uses the energy from ATP hydrolysis to transport H+ across biological membranes. VHA plays a universal role in essential cellular functions, such as the acidification of lysosomes and endosomes. In addition, the VHA-generated H+-motive force can drive the transport of diverse molecules across cell membranes and epithelia for specialized physiological functions. Here, I discuss diverse physiological functions of VHA in marine animals, focusing on recent discoveries about base secretion in shark gills, potential bone dissolution by Osedax bone-eating worms and its participation in a carbon-concentrating mechanism that promotes coral photosynthesis. Because VHA is evolutionarily conserved among eukaryotes, it is likely to play many other essential physiological roles in diverse marine organisms. Elucidating and characterizing basic VHA-dependent mechanisms could help to determine species responses to environmental stress, including (but not limited to) that resulting from climate change.",2016,10.1242/jeb.128389,219,14,2088-2097,NA,pH; Soluble adenylyl cyclase; Carbonic anhydrase; Carbon-concentrating mechanism; Ocean acidification; Osedax
article,Tadpole-transporting frogs use stagnant water odor to find pools in the rainforest,"Serrano-Rojas, Shirley J. and Pasukonis, Andrius",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Breeding sites are often a limited and ephemeral resource for rainforest frogs. This resource limitation has driven the evolution of diverse reproductive strategies that increase offspring survival. For example, poison frogs shuttle their tadpoles from terrestrial clutches to aquatic rearing sites, using various cues to assess pool suitability. Yet, how frogs find new pools is unknown. We tested the role of odor cues in the process of finding tadpole deposition sites by the poison frog Allobates femoralis. We created 60 artificial pools grouped into three conditions: stagnant water, tadpole water and clean water control. Fifteen pools were discovered within 6 days, with more tadpoles and more frogs directly observed at pools with stagnant odor cues. Our findings suggest that frogs use odor cues associated with stagnant water for the initial discovery of new breeding pools. These cues may be good indicators of pool stability and increased likelihood of tadpole survival.",2021,10.1242/jeb.243122,224,21,NA,jeb243122,Tropical amphibians; Water finding; Navigation; Frog olfaction; Chemical cues; Reproductive strategy
article,Empirical estimation of skin resistance to water loss in amphibians: agar evaluation as a non-resistance model to evaporation,"Senzano, Luis M. and Bovo, Rafael P. and Andrade, V, Denis",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Total resistance (r(t)) to evaporative water loss (EWL) in amphibians is given by the sum of the boundary layer (r(b)) and the skin resistance (r(s)). Thus, r(s) can be determined if the r(b) component is defined (r(s)=r(t)-r(b)). The use of agar models has become the standard technique to estimate r(b) under the assumption that the agar surface imposes no barrier to evaporation (r(s)=0). We evaluated this assumption by determining EWL rates and r(b) values from exposed surfaces of free water, a physiological solution mimicking the osmotic properties of a generalized amphibian, and agar gels prepared at various concentrations using either water or physiological solution as diluent. Water evaporation was affected by both the presence of solutes and agar concentration. Models prepared with agar at 5\% concentration in water provided the most practical and appropriate proxy for the estimation of r(b).",2022,10.1242/jeb.243941,225,15,NA,jeb243941,Agar model; Biophysical models; Boundary layer resistance; Agar concentration; Body fluid osmolality
article,"Carry-over effect of artificial light at night on daytime mating activity in an ecologically important detritivore, the amphipod Gammarus pulex","He, Yuhan and Ganguly, Anirban and Lindgren, Susan and Quispe, Laura and Suvanto, Corinne and Zhao, Kangshun and Candolin, Ulrika",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Artificial light at night (ALAN) is a growing environmental problem influencing the fitness of individuals through effects on their physiology and behaviour. Research on animals has primarily focused on effects on behaviour during the night, whereas less is known about effects transferred to daytime. Here, we investigated in the lab the impact of ALAN on the mating behaviour of an ecologically important freshwater amphipod, Gammarus pulex, during both daytime and nighttime. We manipulated the presence of ALAN and the intensity of male-male competition for access to females, and found the impact of ALAN on mating activity to be stronger during daytime than during nighttime, independent of male-male competition. At night, ALAN only reduced the probability of precopula pair formation, while during the daytime, it both decreased general activity and increased the probability of pair separation after pair formation. Thus, ALAN reduced mating success in G. pulex not only directly, through effects on mating behaviour at night, but also indirectly through a carry-over effect on daytime activity and the ability to remain in precopula. These results emphasise the importance of considering delayed effects of ALAN on organisms, including daytime activities that can be more important fitness determinants than nighttime activities.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246682,227,8,NA,jeb246682,Environmental change; Maladaptation; Pollution; Precopulatory mate guarding; Reproduction; Trade-off
article,Rainbow trout provide the first experimental evidence for adherence to a distinct Strouhal number during animal oscillatory propulsion,"Nudds, Robert L. and John, Emma L. and Keen, Adam N. and Shiels, Holly A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The relationship between tail (or wing) beat frequency (f(tail)), amplitude (A) and forward velocity (U) in animals using oscillatory propulsion, when moving at a constant cruising speed, converges upon an optimum range of the Strouhal number (St=f(tail) . A/U). Previous work, based on observational data and supported by theory, shows St falling within the broad optimum range (0.2<St<0.4) and considers this adequate to indicate its importance in governing wing or tail kinematics. This study presents the first evidence using an experimental manipulation that supports the importance of maintaining kinematics at a single optimum (or preferred) St. The tail beat kinematics of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, were disturbed by increasing water temperature (T-water) from 11 +/- 1 to 20 +/- 1 degrees C. Elevated Twater increased ftail and decreased A, whilst St at any given U was conserved. St increased with U, driven by concomitant increases in A, whilst ftail was unaffected by U. An increase in Twater also increased basal metabolic costs, but did not affect the incremental increase in metabolic cost with increasing U. Predicted future changes to Twater of lakes and rivers (5-10 degrees C over the next 100 years) may not present major locomotory problems to salmonids.",2014,10.1242/jeb.102236,217,13,2244-2249,NA,Fish; Locomotion; Respirometry; Salmonid; Swim flume; Swimming
article,"A mosquito entomoglyceroporin, <i>Aedes aegypti</i> AQP5, participates in water transport across the Malpighian tubules of larvae","Misyura, Lidiya and Yerushalmi, Gil Y. and Donini, Andrew",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The mosquito Aedes aegypti is the primary vector for arboviral diseases such as Zika fever, dengue fever, chikungunya and yellow fever. The larvae reside in hypo-osmotic freshwater habitats, where they face dilution of their body fluids from osmotic influx of water. The Malpighian tubules help maintain ionic and osmotic homeostasis by removing excess water from the hemolymph; however, the transcellular pathway for this movement remains unresolved. Aquaporins are transmembrane channels thought to permit transcellular transport of water from the hemolymph into the Malpighian tubule lumen. Immunolocalization of A. aegypti aquaporin 5 (AaAQP5) revealed expression by Malpighian tubule principal cells of the larvae, with localization to both the apical and basolateral membranes. Knockdown of AaAQP5 with doubl-estranded RNA decreased larval survival, reduced rates of fluid, K+ and Na+ secretion by the Malpighian tubules, and reduced Cl- concentrations in the hemolymph. These findings indicate that AaAQP5 participates in transcellular water transport across the Malpighian tubules of larval A. aegypti where global AaAQP5 expression is important for larval survival.",2017,10.1242/jeb.158352,220,19,3536-3544,NA,Mosquito; Water transport; Transcellular; Osmoregulation; Ion-selective microelectrode; Hemolymph
article,Limits to sustained energy intake. XIV. Heritability of reproductive performance in mice,"Vaanholt, Lobke M. and Sinclair, Rachel E. and Speakman, John R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Limits to sustained energy intake (SusEI) are important because they constrain many aspects of animal performance. Individual variability in SusEI may be imposed by genetic factors that are inherited from parents to offspring. Here, we investigated heritability of reproductive performance in MF1 mice. Food intake, milk energy output (MEO) and litter mass were measured in mothers (F-0) and daughters (F-1) that were raising litters of 10 pups. Cross-fostering was designed so that half of each litter consisted of biological offspring and the rest came from one unrelated female (i.e. fostered pups). Food intake increased linearly during early lactation and reached a plateau during late lactation (day 9-13, called the asymptotic food intake, FIAS, equivalent to SusEI). Parent-offspring regression showed that FIAS, MEO and litter mass were all positively and significantly related between mothers and their biological daughters, but no significant relationships were found between the same traits for mothers and fostered daughters. FIAS at peak lactation was significantly correlated to adult food intake and body mass when the mice were 6. months old and not lactating. In conclusion, a large part of the variation in FIAS could be explained by genetic variation or maternal effects in pregnancy whereas non-genetic maternal effects in lactation were negligible. As a consequence, biological daughters of mothers with high reproductive performance (i.e. high milk production and hence higher litter mass at weaning) had a better reproductive performance themselves, independent of the mother that raised them during lactation.",2013,10.1242/jeb.078394,216,12,2308-2315,NA,milk energy output; heritability; reproduction; lactation
article,Magnetic resonance imaging analysis of water flow in the mantle cavity of live <i>Mytilus galloprovincialis</i>,"Seo, Eriko and Ohishi, Kazue and Maruyama, Tadashi and Imaizumi-Ohashi, Yoshie and Murakami, Masataka and Seo, Yoshiteru",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Water flow inside the shell of Mytilus galloprovincialis was measured by phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In seawater without algal cells at 23 degrees C, water approached the mussel from the posterior-ventral side, and entered through the inhalant aperture at a velocity of 40-20 mm s(-1). The flow rate in the lower mantle cavity decreased to 10-20 mm s(-1), the water flowed in the anterior-dorsal direction and approached the demibranches at a velocity of 5-10 mm s(-1). After passing through the lamellae to the upper mantle cavity, the water stretched the interlamellar cavity, turned to the posterior-dorsal direction and accumulated in the epibranchial cavity. The water flows came together at the ventral side of the posterior adductor muscle. The velocity increased more to than 50 mm s(-1) in the exhalant siphon, and exhaled out in the posterior-dorsal direction. The anterior-posterior direction of the flow was imaged every 1.92 s by the inflow effect of T-1-weighted MRI. The flow seemed to be constant, and no cyclic motion of the mantles or the gills was detected. Spontaneous closure of the shells caused a quick drop of the flow in the mantle cavity. In the opening process of the shells, water flow in the interlamellar cavities increased before the opening, followed by an increase of flows in the exhalant siphon and inhalant aperture with minimum delay, reaching a plateau within 1 min of the shells opening. This provides direct evidence that the lateral cilia drive water in the mussel M. galloprovincialis.",2014,10.1242/jeb.101949,217,13,2277-2287,NA,Mussel pump; Ventilation; Lateral cilia; Filter-feeding bivalve; MRI
article,Spectral sensitivity of the ctenid spider <i>Cupiennius salei</i>,"Zopf, Lydia M. and Schmid, Axel and Fredman, David and Eriksson, Bo Joakim",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The spectral sensitivity of adult male Cupiennius salei Keys, a nocturnal hunting spider, was studied in a behavioural test. As known from earlier behavioural tests, C. salei will walk towards a black target presented in front of a white background. In this study, a black target (size 42x70 cm) was presented in a white arena illuminated by monochromatic light in the range 365-695 nm using 19 monochromatic filters (half-width in the range 6-10 nm). In the first trial, the transmission of the optical filters was between 40\% and 80\%. In the second trial, the transmission was reduced to 5\% using a neutral density filter. At the high intensity, the spiders showed a spectral sensitivity in the range 380-670 nm. In the second trial, the animals only showed directed walks if the illumination was in the range 449-599 nm, indicating a lower sensitivity at the margins of the spectral sensitivity. In previous intracellular recordings, the measured spectral sensitivity was between 320 and 620 nm. Interestingly, these results do not completely match the behaviourally tested spectral sensitivity of the photoreceptors, where the sensitivity range is shifted to longer wavelengths. In order to investigate the molecular background of spectral sensitivity, we searched for opsin genes in C. salei. We found three visual opsins that correspond to UV and middle to long wavelength sensitive opsins as described for jumping spiders.",2013,10.1242/jeb.086256,216,21,4103-4108,NA,behavioural test; gene expression; eyes; phylogeny; vision; opsins
article,"Light exposure enhances urea absorption in the fluted giant clam, <i>Tridacna squamosa</i>, and up-regulates the protein abundance of a light-dependent urea active transporter, DUR3-like, in its ctenidium","Chan, Christabel Y. L. and Hiong, Kum C. and Boo, Mel V. and Choo, Celine Y. L. and Wong, Wai P. and Chew, Shit F. and Ip, Yuen K.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Giant clams live in nutrient-poor reef waters of the Indo-Pacific and rely on symbiotic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium spp., also known as zooxanthellae) for nutrients. As the symbionts are nitrogen deficient, the host clam has to absorb exogenous nitrogen and supply it to them. This study aimed to demonstrate light-enhanced urea absorption in the fluted giant clam, Tridacna squamosa, and to clone and characterize the urea active transporter DUR3-like from its ctenidium (gill). The results indicate that T. squamosa absorbs exogenous urea, and the rate of urea uptake in the light was significantly higher than that in darkness. The DUR3-like coding sequence obtained from its ctenidium comprised 2346 bp, encoding a protein of 782 amino acids and 87.0 kDa. DUR3-like was expressed strongly in the ctenidium, outer mantle and kidney. Twelve hours of exposure to light had no significant effect on the transcript level of ctenidial DUR3-like. However, between 3 and 12 h of light exposure, DUR3-like protein abundance increased progressively in the ctenidium, and became significantly greater than that in the control at 12 h. DUR3-like had an apical localization in the epithelia of the ctenidial filaments and tertiary water channels. Taken together, these results indicate that DUR3-like might participate in light-enhanced urea absorption in the ctenidium of T. squamosa. When made available to the symbiotic zooxanthellae that are known to possess urease, the absorbed urea can be metabolized to NH3 and CO2 to support amino acid synthesis and photosynthesis, respectively, during insolation.",2018,10.1242/jeb.176313,221,8,NA,jeb176313,Amino acid; Ammonia; Calcification; Nitrogen; Symbiodinium; Zooxanthellae
