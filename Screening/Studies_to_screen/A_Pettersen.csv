article,Thermoprotective properties of <i>Opuntia ficus-indica</i> f. <i>inermis</i> cladodes and mesocarps on sheep lymphocytes,"Slimen, Imen Belhadj and Chabaane, Hanene and Chniter, Mohamed and Mabrouk, Mahmoud and Ghram, Adbeljelil and Miled, Khaled and Behi, Imen and Abderrabba, Manef and Najar, Taha",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"This study aims to investigate the thermoprotective properties of Optmtia ficus-indica f. inermis. Extracts were prepared from cladodes (CE) and mesocarps (ME), then subjected to a spectrophotometric and LC-MS analyses. Lymphocytes were isolated from peripheral blood of non-stressed sheep, supplemented with CE, ME, betanin or alpha-tocopherol, and subjected to two thermal treatments: 40 and 41 degrees C, for 6h. Viable lymphocytes and H2O2 production were evaluated. The antioxidant activity of ME was 3.43 folds higher than CE. The LC-MS analysis of CE and ME allowed identifying 11 phenolic acids, 2 flavanones, 6 flavones, 3 flavonols and 1 betanin type betacyanin. Lymphocytes mortality increased linearly as function of the severity and the duration of heat stress. This mortality was correlated with H2O2 production. At 41 degrees C, only ME allowed maintaining lymphocytes viability. Moreover, ME was more efficient than CE in reducing H2O2 production. This thermoprotection was ensured by betaxanthin and betacyanin pigments. Interestingly, betanin was more efficient than a-tocopherol in preventing hyperthermia-induced lymphocytes' mortality. We report here for the first time the thermoprotective properties of cladodes and mesocarps of Opuntia ficusindica f. inermis. Betanin was able to maintain lymphocyte viability through reducing H2O2 production, and therefore the oxidative-induced heat stress.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.02.018,81,NA,73-81,NA,Heat stress; Opuntia ficus-indica; Lymphocytes; Betalains; H2O2
article,Higher environmental temperatures promote acceleration of spermatogenesis <i>in</i> <i>vivo</i> in mice (<i>Mus musculus</i>),"Costa, Guilherme M. J. and Lacerda, Samyra M. S. N. and Figueiredo, Andre F. A. and Leal, Marcelo C. and Rezende-Neto, Jose V. and Franca, Luiz R.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature is considered a crucial modulator of reproductive activity and testis homeostasis. It is well known that elevated temperatures cause several effects on testicular components, particularly on germ cells, which might lead to the impairment of spermatogenesis and loss of male fertility. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of different environmental temperatures on several morphofunctional testis parameters, with emphasis on duration of spermatogenesis and spermatogenic efficiency. Thirty sexually mature Swiss mice (Mus musculus) were allocated in three different experimental groups, being kept in vivarium for three weeks at 16 degrees C, 23 degrees C (control group) and 32 degrees C. In order to estimate the duration of spermatogenesis, three animals per each group received intraperitoneal injections of tritiated thymidine and the testes were perfused-fixed and routinely processed for histological, morphometrical and immunoperoxidase analyses. Although the lower temperature (16 degrees C) did not change most of the evaluated testicular parameters, our findings showed that higher environmental temperature (32 degrees C) is able to alter important testis parameters, resulting for instance in acceleration of spermatogenesis, alterations in the stages frequencies, increased number of germ and Leydig cells apoptosis and reduced Sertoli cell and spermatogenic efficiencies. As in many conditions infertile men exhibit higher mean scrotal temperature, we believe that experimental studies with mice involving temperature might represent an interesting approach to better understand the mechanisms related to human testis function and sperm production.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.07.010,77,NA,14-23,NA,Temperature; Spermatogenesis; Germ cell pace; Male fertility; Sperm production
article,Recognition of mite-infested brood by honeybee (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) workers may involve thermal sensing,"Bauer, Daniel and Wegener, Jakob and Bienefeld, Kaspar",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Hygienic behavior, i.e. the removal of diseased or damaged brood by worker honey bees (Apis mellifera), is seen as one of the principal behavioral elements of this species' social immunity. Identification of the stimuli that trigger it would be helpful in searching for biochemical and molecular markers of this important breeding trait. While many studies at the genomic, transcriptomic, and behavioral level have pointed to the implication of chemical cues, we here hypothesized that thermal cues are alternatively/additionally involved. To test this hypothesis, we first measured whether infestation by the mite Varroa destructor (a condition known to induce hygienic behavior) leads to a thermal gradient between affected and unaffected brood. We found that infested brood cells were between 0.03 and 0.19 degrees C warmer than uninfested controls. Next, we tested whether artificially heating an area of a brood comb would increase the removal of infested or uninfested brood as compared to an unheated control area, and found that this was not the case. Finally, we investigated whether the heating of individual brood cells, as opposed to comb areas, would influence brood removal from cells adjacent to the heated one. This was the case for uninfested, though not for infested cells. We conclude that infestation by V. destructor leads to a heating of brood cells that should be perceivable by bees, and that small-scale temperature gradients can influence brood removal. This makes it appear possible that thermal cues play a role in triggering hygienic behavior of honey bees directed at varroa-infested larvae/pupae, although our results are insufficient to prove such an involvement.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.04.012,74,NA,311-316,NA,Varroa destructor; Uncapping; Thermography; Gradient sensing
article,Ambient temperatures differently influence colour morphs of the leaf beetle <i>Chrysomela lapponica</i>: Roles of thermal melanism and developmental plasticity,"Zverev, Vitali and Kozlov, V, Mikhail and Forsman, Anders and Zvereva, Elena L.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"We asked whether ambient temperatures can affect morph frequencies within a subarctic population of the polymorphic leaf beetle Chrysomela lapponica through thermal melanism and/or developmental plasticity. Body temperature increased faster in beetles of dark morph than in beetles of light morph under exposure to artificial irradiation. Dark males ran faster than light males in both field and laboratory experiments, and this difference decreased with increasing ambient air temperature, from significant at 10 degrees C to non-significant at 20 degrees C and 26 degrees C. On cold days (6-14 degrees C), significantly more dark males than light males were found on their host plants in copula (40.8\% and 27.3\% respectively); on warm days (15-22 degrees C) this difference disappeared. Light females produced twice as many eggs as dark females; this difference did not depend on the ambient temperature. The proportion of dark morphs in the progenies of pairs with one dark parent was twice as high as that in the progenies of pairs in which both parents were light, and this proportion was greater when larvae developed at low (10 and 15 degrees C) than at high (20 and 25 degrees C) temperatures. We conclude that low temperatures may increase the frequencies of dark morphs in degrees C. lapponica populations due to both the mating advantages of dark males over light males and developmental plasticity. Variation in frequencies of low-fecund dark morphs in the population, caused by among-year differences in temperature together with density-dependent selection, may contribute to the evolutionary dynamics of the colour polymorphism and may influence abundance fluctuations in these leaf beetle populations.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.03.019,74,NA,100-109,NA,Chrysomelidae; Colour polymorphism; Fecundity; Locomotory activity; Mating success; Phenotypic plasticity
article,Lower critical temperature and cold-induced thermogenesis of lean and overweight humans are inversely related to body mass and basal metabolic rate,"Nahon, Kimberly J. and Boon, Mariette R. and Doornink, Fleur and Jazet, Ingrid M. and Rensen, Patrick C. N. and Abreu-Vieira, Gustavo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"It is colloquially stated that body size plays a role in the human response to cold, but the magnitude and details of this interaction are unclear. To explore the inherent influence of body size on cold-exposed metabolism, we investigated the relation between body composition and resting metabolic rate in humans at thermoneutrality and during cooling within the nonshivering thermogenesis range. Body composition and resting energy expenditure were measured in 20 lean and 20 overweight men at thermoneutrality and during individualized cold exposure. Metabolic rates as a function of ambient temperature were investigated considering the variability in body mass and composition. We observed an inverse relationship between body size and the lower critical temperature (LCT), i.e. the threshold where thermoneutrality ends and cold activates thermogenesis. LCT was higher in lean than overweight subjects (22.1 +/- 0.6 vs 19.5 +/- 0.5 degrees C, p < 0.001). Below LCT, minimum conductance was identical between lean and overweight (100 +/- 4 vs 97 +/- 3 kcal/degrees C/day respectively, p = 0.45). Overweight individuals had higher basal metabolic rate (BMR) explained mostly by the higher lean mass, and lower cold-induced thermogenesis (CIT) per degree of cold exposure. Below thermoneutrality, energy expenditure did not scale to lean body mass. Overweight subjects had lower heat loss per body surface area (44.7 +/- 1.3 vs 54.7 +/- 2.3 kcal/degrees C/m(2)/day, p < 0.001). We conclude that larger body sizes possessed reduced LCT as explained by higher BMR related to more lean mass rather than a change in whole-body conductance. Thus, larger individuals with higher lean mass need to be exposed to colder temperatures to activate CIT, not because of increased insulation, but because of a higher basal heat generation. Our study suggests that the distinct effects of body size and composition on energy expenditure should be taken in account when exploring the metabolism of humans exposed to cold.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.08.006,69,NA,238-248,NA,Body composition; Energy expenditure; Cold exposure; Thermoneutrality; Resting metabolic rate; Body weight; Brown adipose tissue
article,Thermoregulatory responses of Holstein cows exposed to experimentally induced heat stress,"Ferrazza, Rodrigo de Andrade and Mogollon Garcia, Henry David and Vallejo Aristizabal, Viviana Helena and Nogueira, Camilla de Souza and Verissimo, Cecilia Jose and Sartori, Jose Roberto and Sartori, Roberto and Pinheiro Ferreir, Joao Carlos",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Heat stress (HS) adversely influences productivity and welfare of dairy cattle. We hypothesized that the thermoregulatory mechanisms vary depending on the exposure time to HS, with a cumulative effect on the adaptive responses and thermal strain of the cow. To identify the effect of HS on adaptive thermoregulatory mechanisms and predictors of caloric balance, Holstein cows were housed in climate chambers and randomly distributed into thermoneutral (TN; n= 12) or HS (n= 12) treatments for 16 days. Vaginal temperature (VT), rectal temperature (Tre), respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), and dry matter intake (DMI) were measured. The temperature and humidity under TN were 25.9 +/- 0.2 degrees C and 73.0 +/- 0.8\%, respectively, and under HS were 36.3 +/- 0.3 degrees C and 60.9 +/- 0.9\%, respectively. The RR of the HS cows increased immediately after exposure to heat and was higher (76.02 +/- 1.70 bpm, p < 0.001) than in the TN (39.70 +/- 0.71 bpm). An increase in Tre (39.87 +/- 0.07 degrees C in the HS vs. 38.56 +/- 0.03 degrees C in the TN, p < 0.001) and in VT (39.82 +/- 0.10 degrees C in the HS vs. 38.26 +/- 0.03 degrees C in the TN, p < 0.001) followed the increase in RR. A decrease (p < 0.05) in HR occurred in the HS (62.13 +/- 0.99 bpm) compared with the TN (66.23 +/- 0.79 bpm); however, the magnitude of the differences was not the same over time. The DMI was lower in HS cows from the third day (8.27 +/- 0.33 kg d(-1) in the HS vs. 14.03 +/- 0.29 kg d(-1) in the TN, p < 0.001), and the reduction of DMI was strongly affected (r= -0.65) by changes in the temperature humidity index. The effect of environmental variables from the previous day on physiological parameters and DMI was more important than the immediate effect, and ambient temperature represented the most determinant factor for heat exchange. The difference in the responses to acute and chronic exposure to HS suggests an adaptive response. Thus, intense thermal stress strongly influence thermoregulatory mechanisms and the acclimation process depend critically on heat exposure time.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.03.014,66,NA,68-80,NA,Hyperthermia; Thermoregulation; Thermal index; Acclimation; Climate chamber; Bos taurus
article,Changes in systolic arterial pressure variability are associated with the decreased aerobic performance of rats subjected to physical exercise in the heat,"Mueller-Ribeiro, Flavia C. and Wanner, Samuel P. and Santos, Weslley H. M. and Malheiros-Lima, Milene R. and Fonseca, Ivana A. T. and Coimbra, Candido C. and Pires, Washington",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Enhanced cardiovascular strain is one of the factors that explains degraded aerobic capacity in hot environments. The cardiovascular system is regulated by the autonomic nervous system, whose activity can be indirectly evaluated by analyzing heart rate variability (HRV) and systolic arterial pressure (SAP) variability. However, no study has addressed whether HRV or SAP variability can predict aerobic performance during a single bout of exercise. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether there is an association between cardiovascular variability and performance in rats subjected to treadmill running at two ambient temperatures. In addition, this study investigated whether the heat-induced changes in cardiovascular variability and reductions in performance are associated with each other. Male Wistar rats were implanted with a catheter into their carotid artery for pulsatile blood pressure recordings. After recovery from surgery, the animals were subjected to incremental-speed exercise until they were fatigued under temperate (25 degrees C) and hot (35 degrees C) conditions. Impaired performance and exaggerated cardiovascular responses were observed in the hot relative to the temperate environment. Significant and negative correlations between most of the SAP variability components (standard deviation, variance, very low frequency {[}VLF], and low frequency [}LF]) at the earlier stages of exercise and total exercise time were observed in both environmental conditions. Furthermore, the heat-induced changes in the sympathetic components of SAP variability (VLF and LF) were associated with heat-induced impairments in performance. Overall, the results indicate that SAP variability at the beginning of exercise predicts the acute performance of rats. Our findings also suggest that heat impairments in aerobic performance are associated with changes in cardiovascular autonomic control.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.11.006,63,NA,31-40,NA,Fatigue; Hot environment; Parasympathetic activity; Sympathetic activity; Sympathovagal balance; Treadmill running
article,Thermal fluctuation within nests and predicted sex ratio of Morelet's Crocodile,"Escobedo-Galvan, Armando H. and Lopez-Luna, Marco A. and Cupul-Magana, Fabio G.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Understanding the interplay between thermal variations and sex ratio in reptiles with temperature dependent sex determination is the first step for developing long-term conservation strategies. In case of crocodilians, the information is fragmentary and insufficient for establishing a general framework to consider how thermal fluctuation influence sex determination under natural conditions. The main goal of this study was to analyze thermal variation in nests of Crocodylus moreletii and to discuss the potential implications for predicting offspring sex ratio. The study was carried out at the Centro de Estudios Tecnologicos del Mar N degrees 2 and at the Sistemas Productivos Cocodrilo, Campeche, Mexico. Data was collected in the nesting season of Morelet's Crocodiles during three consecutive seasons (2007-2009). Thermal fluctuations for multiple areas of the nest chamber were registered by data loggers. We calculate the constant temperature equivalent based on thermal profiles among nests to assess whether there are differences between the nest temperature and its equivalent to constant temperature. We observed that mean nest temperature was only different among nests, while daily thermal fluctuations vary depending on the depth position within the nest chamber, years and nests. The constant temperature equivalent was different among and within nests, but not among survey years. We observed differences between constant temperature equivalent and mean nest temperature both at the top and in the middle of the nest cavities, but were not significantly different at the bottom of nest cavities. Our results enable examine and discuss the relevance of daily thermal fluctuations to predict sex ratio of the Morelet's Crocodile. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

article,An instantaneous approach for determining the infrared emissivity of swine surface and the influencing factors,"Zhang, Kun and Jiao, Leizi and Zhao, Xiande and Dong, Daming",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Infrared thermal imaging technology has been widely employed in temperature measurements of human and animals and its accuracy relies on the determination process of the emissivity of the target to a large extent. However, common used methods were unable to determine the emissivity of the surface of living animals and thus lower the accuracy. In this paper, we suggested a new approach to acquire the infrared emissivity of living swine in real time. In the approach, the surface temperature of swine and reference body were measured to compute the emissivity and the measurement process was completed in a non contact and non-invasive manner. We changed the surface reflection energy of animals and reference body by changing the ambient radiant energy and obtain the surface emissivity in real time without confirming the actual temperature of animal surface. In this way, the infrared emissivity of the animal surface can be determined instantaneously and without knowing the real temperature. Both swine specimen and a living swine were used in this study. Using this method, we measured the emissivity of different body sites of the swine. The results showed that the emissivity values at different body sites show the significant differences. The emissivity values at trotter and eye were respectively 0.895 and 0.930 and the emissivity on swine surface varied from 0.945 to 0.978. More important, the distribution of the infrared emissivity on a living swine was explored and the detailed differences of the emissivity on a swine surface can be cleanly seen. Furthermore, we studied the influencing factors on the emissivity of animal surface, through measuring the emissivity distribution on swine surface when pig specimens were sprayed with water on the surface or heated using this method. This study is of great significance for the accurate measurement of swine surface temperature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

article,A protocol for analysing thermal stress in insects using infrared thermography,"Gallego, Belen and Verdu, Jose R. and Carrascal, Luis M. and Lobo, Jorge M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The study of insect responses to thermal stress has involved a variety of protocols and methodologies that hamper the ability to compare results between studies. For that reason, the development of a protocol to standardize thermal assays is necessary. In this sense, infrared thermography solves some of the problems allowing us to take continuous temperature measurements without handling the individuals, an important fact in cold-blooded organisms like insects. Here, we present a working protocol based on infrared thermography to estimate both cold and heat thermal stress in insects. We analyse both the change in the body temperature of individuals and their behavioural response. In addition, we used partial least squares regression for the statistical analysis of our data, a technique that solves the problem of having a large number of variables and few individuals, allowing us to work with rare or endemic species. To test our protocol, we chose two species of congeneric, narrowly distributed dung beetles that are endemic to the southeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula. With our protocol we have obtained five variables in the response to cold and twelve in the response to heat. With this methodology we discriminate between the two flightless species of Jekelius through their thermal response. In response to cold, Jekelius hernandezi showed a higher rate of cooling and reached higher temperatures of stupor and haemolymph freezing than Jekelius punctatolineatus. Both species displayed similar thermoregulation ranges before reaching lethal body temperature with heat stress. Overall, we have demonstrated that infrared thermography is a suitable method to assess insect thermal responses with a high degree of sensitivity, allowing for the discrimination between closely related species.

article,Reprint of: The effectiveness of common thermo-regulatory behaviours in a cool temperate grasshopper,"Harris, Rebecca M. B. and McQuillan, Peter and Hughes, Lesley",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Behavioural thermoregulation has the potential to alleviate the short-term impacts of climate change on some small ectotherms, without the need for changes to species distributions or genetic adaptation. We illustrate this by measuring the effect of behaviour in a cool temperate species of grasshopper (Phaulacridium vittatum) over a range of spatial and temporal scales in laboratory and natural field experiments. Microhabitat selection at the site scale was tested in free-ranging grasshoppers and related to changing thermal quality over a daily period. Artificial warming experiments were then used to measure the temperature at which common thermoregulatory behaviours are initiated and the subsequent reductions in body temperature. Behavioural means such as timing of activity, choice of substrates with optimum surface temperatures, shade seeking and postural adjustments (e.g. stilting, vertical orientation) were found to be highly effective at maintaining preferred body temperature. The maximum voluntarily tolerated temperature (MVT) was determined to be 44 degrees C +/- 0.4 degrees C, indicating the upper bounds of thermal flexibility in this species. Behavioural thermoregulation effectively enables small ectotherms to regulate exposure to changing environmental temperatures and utilize the spatially and temporally heterogeneous environments they occupy. Species such as the wingless grasshopper, although adapted to cool temperate conditions, are likely to be well equipped to respond successfully to coarse scale climate change.

article,Lack of supercooling evolution related to winter severity in a lizard,"Michels-Boyce, Madeline and Zani, Peter A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"As organisms move into higher latitudes, they may evolve physiological mechanisms to survive in harsher climates. One such mechanism is supercooling, the capacity to survive at subzero temperatures without freezing. While interspecific comparisons reveal greater thermal tolerances at higher latitudes in insects and vertebrates, evidence for intraspecific evolution in supercooling related to latitude is only evident in insects. We measured the supercooling points of lizards from 12 populations reared from hatch in common laboratory conditions to test for evolved differences in supercooling related to winter. Results indicate that winter harshness (depth or length) cannot explain supercooling points regardless of how data are analyzed, which suggests that populations have not evolved greater supercooling capacity. While our results are consistent with the idea that thermal physiology is evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates, we cannot reject several alternatives including the possibility that lizards are able to behaviorally avoid the extreme temperatures that would select for thermal evolution.

article,Performance limitation and the role of core temperature when wearing light-weight workwear under moderate thermal conditions,"Kofler, Philipp and Burtscher, Martin and Heinrich, Dieter and Bottoni, Giuliamarta and Caven, Barnaby and Bechtold, Thomas and Herten, Anne Teresa and Hasler, Michael and Faulhaber, Martin and Nachbauer, Werner",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The objective of this investigation was to achieve an understanding about the relationship between heat stress and performance limitation when wearing a two-layerfire-resistant light-weight workwear (full-clothed ensemble) compared to an one-layer short sports gear (semi-clothed ensemble) in an exhaustive, stressful situation under moderate thermal condition (25 degrees C). Ten well trained male subjects performed a strenuous walking protocol with both clothing ensembles until exhaustion occurred in a climatic chamber. Wearing worlcwear reduced the endurance performance by 10\% (p = 0.007) and the evaporation by 21\% (p=0.003), caused a more pronounced rise in core temperature during submaximal walking (0.7 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.4 degrees C; p <= 0.001) and from start till exhaustion (1.4 +/- 03 vs. 1.8 +/- 0.5 degrees C; p = 0.008), accelerated sweat loss (13 2 vs. 15 +/- 3 g min(-1); p = 0.007), and led to a significant higher heart rate at the end of cool down (103 +/- 6 vs. 111 +/- 7 bpm; p = 0.004). Correlation analysis revealed that core temperature development during submaximal walking and evaporation may play important roles for endurance performance. However, a critical core temperature of 40 degrees C, which is stated to be a crucial factor for central fatigue and performance limitation, was not reached either with the semi-clothed or the fullclothed ensemble (38.3 +/- 0.4 vs. 38.4 +/- 0.5 degrees C). Additionally, perceived exertion did not increase to a higher extent parallel with the rising core temperature with workwear which would substantiate the critical core temperature theory. In conclusion, increased heat stress led to cardiovascular exercise limitation rather than central fatigue. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Responses in acral and non-acral skin vasomotion and temperature during lowering of ambient temperature,"Elstad, Maja and Vanggaard, Leif and Lossius, Astrid H. and Walloe, Lars and Bergersen, Tone Kristin",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Arteriovenous anastomoses (AVA) in acral skin (palms and soles) have a huge capacity to shunt blood directly from the arteries to the superficial venous plexus of the extremities. We hypothesized that acral skin, which supplies blood to the superficial venous plexus, has a stronger influence on blood flow adjustments during cooling in thermoneutral subjects than does non-acral skin. Thirteen healthy subjects were exposed to stepwise cooling from 32 degrees C to 25 degrees C and 17 degrees C in a climate chamber. Laser Doppler flux and skin temperature were measured simultaneously from the left and right third finger pulp and bilateral upper arm skin. Coherence and correlation analyses were performed of short-term fluctuations at each temperature interval. The flux from finger pulps showed the synchronous spontaneous fluctuations characteristic of skin areas containing AVAs. Fluctuation frequency, amplitude and synchronicity were all higher at 25 degrees C than at 32 degrees C and 17 degrees C (p < 0.02). Bilateral flux from the upper arm skin showed an irregular, asynchronous vasomotor pattern with small amplitudes which were independent of ambient temperature. At 32 degrees C, ipsilateral median flux values from the right arm (95\% confidence intervals) were 492 arbitrary units (au) (417, 537) in finger pulp and 43 au (35, 60) in upper arm skin. Flux values gradually decreased in finger pulp to 246 au (109, 363) at 25 degrees C, before an abrupt fall occurred at a median room temperature of 24 degrees C, resulting in a flux value of 79 au (31,116) at 17 degrees C. In the upper arm skin a gradual fall throughout the cooling period to 21 au (13, 27) at 17 degrees C was observed. The fact that the response of blood flow to ambient cooling is stronger in acral skin than in non-acral skin suggests that AVAs have a greater capacity to adjust blood flow in thermoneutral zone than arterioles in non-acral skin.

C. and Gebremedhin, Kifle G.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In this study, the transmission-line modeling (TLM) applied to bio-thermal problems was improved by incorporating several novel computational techniques, which include application of graded meshes which resulted in 9 times faster in computational time and uses only a fraction (16\%) of the computational resources used by regular meshes in analyzing heat flow through heterogeneous media. Graded meshes, unlike regular meshes, allow heat sources to be modeled in all segments of the mesh. A new boundary condition that considers thermal properties and thus resulting in a more realistic modeling of complex problems is introduced. Also, a new way of calculating an error parameter is introduced. The calculated temperatures between nodes were compared against the results obtained from the literature and agreed within less than 1\% difference. It is reasonable, therefore, to conclude that the improved TLM model described herein has great potential in heat transfer of biological systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Ultimate aim is to define a distribution of nanoparticles as well as a combination of other therapeutic parameters to attain thermal ablation temperatures (50-60 degrees C) within whole of the tumour region. Three different cases of nanoparticle distributions are analysed under controlled conditions for all other parameters viz, irradiation intensity and duration, and volume fraction of nanoparticles. Results show that distribution of nanoparticles into only the periphery of tumour resulted in desired thermal ablation temperature in whole of tumour. For the tumour size considered in this study, an irradiation intensity of 1.25 W/cm(2) for duration of 300 s and a nanoparticle volume fraction of 0.001\% was optimal to attain a temperature of >= 53 degrees C within the whole tumour region. It is concluded that distribution of nanoparticles in peripheral region of tumour, along with a controlled combination of other parameters, seems favourable and provides a promising pathway for thermal ablation of a tumour subjected to nanoparticle assisted thermal therapy.

article,Repeated thermal stressor causes chronic elevation of baseline corticosterone and suppresses the physiological endocrine sensitivity to acute stressor in the cane toad (<i>Rhinella marina</i>),"Narayan, Edward J. and Hero, Jean-Marc",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Extreme environmental temperature could impact the physiology and ecology of animals. The stress endocrine axis provides necessary physiological stress response to acute (day-day) stressors. Presently, there are no empirical evidences showing that exposure to extreme thermal stressor could cause chronic stress in amphibians. This could also modulate the physiological endocrine sensitivity to acute stressors and have serious implications for stress coping in amphibians, particularly those living in fragmented and disease prone environments. We addressed this important question using the cane toad (Rhinella marina) model from its introduced range in Queensland, Australia. We quantified their physiological endocrine sensitivity to a standard acute (capture and handling) stressor after exposing the cane toads to thermal shock at 35 degrees C for 30 min daily for 34 days. Corticosterone (CORT) responses to the capture and handling protocol were measured on three sampling intervals (days 14, 24, and 34) to determine whether the physiological endocrine sensitivity was maintained or modulated over-time. Two control groups (Cl for baseline CORT measurement only and C2 acute handled only) and two temperature treatment groups (T1 received daily thermal shock up to day 14 only and a recovery phase of 20 days and T2 received thermal shock daily for 34 days). Results showed that baseline CORT levels remained high on day 14 (combined effect of capture, captivity and thermal stress) for both T1 and T2. Furthermore, baseline CORT levels decreased for T1 once the thermal shock was removed after day 14 and returned to baseline by day 29. On the contrary, baseline CORT levels kept on increasing for T2 over the 34 days of daily thermal shocks. Furthermore, the magnitudes of the acute CORT responses or physiological endocrine sensitivity were consistently high for both Cl and T1. However, acute CORT responses for T2 toads were dramatically reduced between days 24 and 34. These novel findings suggest that repeated exposure to extreme thermal stressor could cause chronic stress and consequently suppress the physiological endocrine sensitivity to acute stressors (e.g. pathogenic diseases) in amphibians.

article,Physiological and biochemical thermoregulatory responses of Chinese bulbuls <i>Pycnonotus sinensis</i> to warm temperature: Phenotypic flexibility in a small passerine,"Zheng, Wei-Hong and Lin, Lin and Liu, Jin-Song and Pan, Hao and Cao, Meng-Ting and Hu, Yi-Lin",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature is an important environmental cue for the regulation of thermogenesis in small birds. We tested the hypothesis that a small passerine, the Chinese bulbul Pycnonotus sinensis can decrease thermogenesis in response to warmer temperatures by decreasing body mass, the organ mass and changing physiological and biochemical processes in the liver and muscle. Captive Chinese bulbuls decreased in body mass and basal metabolic rate (BMR) during 4 weeks of acclimation to 30 +/- 1 degrees C They also showed a decrease in liver, kidney and small intestine mass and reduced mitochondrial state-4 respiration and cytochrome C oxidase (COX) activity in the liver and muscle compared to 10 +/- 1 degrees C. Furthermore, BMR was positively correlated with body mass, organ mass (liver, kidney, small intestine and entire digestive tract), and mitochondrial state-4 respiration and cytochrome C oxidase (COX) activity in the liver and muscle. These results indicate that changes in body mass, organ mass and respiratory enzyme activity are mechanisms by which Chinese bulbuls adapt to warmer temperatures. The data support the hypothesis that such physiological flexibility is ubiquitous in birds. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

article,The effects of geothermal water inflow on longitudinal changes in benthic macroinvertebrate community composition of a temperate stream,"Zivic, Ivana and Zivic, Miroslav and Milosevic, Djuradj and Bjelanovic, Katarina and Stanojlovic, Sanja and Daljevic, Radoslav and Markovic, Zoran",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Studies of macroinvertebrate communities in thermal streams are highly geographically localized and mostly faunistical, making the efforts to understand in situ water thermal regime effects on those biocoenoses barely achievable. We examined the effects of geothermal water inflow on benthic macroinvertebrate community composition in a temperate stream. Environmental data analysis has shown that water temperature is a major factor determining the faunistical composition, especially downstream of the geothermal water inflow situated some 20 m upstream of locality V3. The increase in mean annual water temperature from 11.5 +/- 4.1 degrees C at locality V2 to 22.0 +/- 5.0 degrees C at locality V3 induced an enormous shift in community composition from a diverse one, composed mainly of Gammaridae, Simuliidae, Chironomidae, Trichoptera and Ephemeroptera, and to a lesser extent of Plecoptera, Coleoptera, other Diptera, Hirudinea, Odonata, Mollusca and Oligochaeta, to a uniform one strongly dominated by Chironomidae, Mollusca and Oligochaeta, comprising 98.9 +/- 0.5\% of collected individuals. While the disappearance of Plecoptera and Ephemeroptera and the increase in representation of Mollusca and Oligochaeta at locality V3 might be solely explained by water temperature increase, in the case of Chironomidae the increase in water discharge and relatively high annual water temperature variation at locality V3 had additional positive effects. However, the latter factor induced disappearance of Gammaridae at locality V3. In addition to the increase in water temperature, increase of water velocity significantly determined the longitudinal dynamics of Coleoptera. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

article,"Differential thermal tolerance and energetic trajectories during ontogeny in porcelain crabs, genus <i>Petrolisthes</i>","Miller, Nathan A. and Paganini, Adam W. and Stillman, Jonathon H.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Thermal tolerance limits of marine intertidal zone organisms are elevated compared to subtidal species, but are typically just slightly higher than maximal habitat temperatures. The small thermal safety margins maintained by intertidal zone organisms suggest that high thermal tolerance is associated with a physiological cost. If true, we hypothesize that species that transition between intertidal zone and planktonic habitats during ontogeny, will adjust their thermal tolerance accordingly to capitalize upon potential energy savings while in a thermally benign habitat. We tested this hypothesis in porcelain crabs that transition between the thermally stressful, intertidal zone as embryos, to the thermally benign pelagic zone as larvae, and back at settlement. We found the more thermally tolerant, mid-intertidal zone species, Petrolisthes cinctipes, and the less thermally tolerant, subtidal zone species, Petrolisthes manimacilis, exhibited reduced thermal tolerance (LT50) in the transition from embryos to larvae. This was associated with an increased oxygen consumption rate in both species, though P. cinctipes exhibited a significantly greater increase in oxygen consumption. P. cinctipes also showed an increase in thermal tolerance in settled juveniles compared to pelagic zoea I larvae, resulting in an overall V-shaped thermal tolerance relationship during ontogeny, while in P. manimaculis thermal tolerance was significantly lower in juveniles compared to zoea I. In neither species were these changes (zoea I to juvenile) associated with a significant change in metabolism. While embryos and juveniles of P. cinctipes have thermal tolerance limits near intertidal habitat thermal maxima (similar to 32.5 degrees C), all three life-history stages in P. manimaculis (especially embryos and larvae) exhibit considerable thermal safety margins. The mechanisms underlying this ``excess{''} thermal tolerance in P. manimacilis embryos are unknown, but suggest that patterns of thermal tolerance in early life history stages are species-specific.

article,Seasonal thermoregulation in the burrowing parrot (<i>Cyanoliseus patagonus</i>),"Zungu, Manqoba M. and Brown, Mark and Downs, Colleen T.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Birds exposed to seasonal environments are faced with the problem of maintaining thermogenic homoeostasis. Previous studies have established that birds native to the Holarctic increase their Resting Metabolic Rate at different ambient temperatures (RMRTa) and Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) in winter as an adaptation to cold temperature since winters are more severe, while their non-Holarctic counterparts generally decrease their winter BMR as an energy saving mechanism during unproductive and dry winter months. In this study, we examined seasonal thermoregulation in the burrowing parrot (Cyanoliseus patagonus), a colonial psittacine native to the Patagonian region of Argentina, a region with an unpredictable environment. We found significantly higher mass specific RMRTa and BMR in summer than in winter. Both summer and winter BMR of the species fell within the predicted 95\% confident interval for a parrot of its size. Body mass was significantly higher in winter than in summer. The burrowing parrot had broad thermo-neutral zones in winter and summer. The circadian rhythm of core body temperature (T-b) of burrowing parrots was not affected by season, showing that this species regulated its T-b irrespective of season. These results suggest that the burrowing parrots' seasonal thermoregulatory responses represent that of energy conservation which is important in an unpredictable environment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Our earlier study identified that, bta-mir-2898 can be over expressed in crossbred cattle during heat stress. Nevertheless the differential expression of bta-mir-2898 among native vs crossbred cattle during summer stress along with it's correlation with different heat shock proteins (HSPs) is not yet studied. In the present context, we studied the differential expression of bta-mir-2898 among Frieswal (Bos indicus x Bos taurus) and Sahiwal (Bos indicus) breeds of cattle during a range of environmental air temperatures and further investigated the correlation of bta-mir-2898 with different HSPs (HSP70, HSP90, HSP60. HSF, HSPB8 and HSP27). It was observed that, at peak air temperature the relative miRNA expression level (p < 0.05) of bta-mir-2898 was 3.4 +/- 0.41 and 0.79 +/- 0.22 among Frieswal and Sahiwal, respectively. We also observed significant levels (p < 0.05) of mRNA abundance of HSP70, HSP90, HSPB8 and HSP27 among the breeds. In all the cases Sahiwal found to exhibited higher level of HSPs in comparison to Frieswal. Studies revealed that the expression profile of bta-mir-2898 was negatively correlated with the expression of all the HSPs during thermal stress in post anti-mir2898 treated PBMC invitro cultured model originated from both Frieswal and Sahiwal cattle breeds. However, significantly (p < 0.05) higher negative correlations were observed between bta-mir-2898 and HSP70, HSP60 and HSPB8.

It is an important cause of severe spinal cord injury that can lead to serious spinal cord disorders such as paraplegia. Hypothermia is widely acknowledged as an effective neuroprotective intervention following cardiac arrest injury. However, studies on effects of hypothermia on spinal cord injury following asphyxial cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CA/CPR) are insufficient. The objective of this study was to examine effects of hypothermia on motor deficit of hind limbs of rats and vulnerability of their spinal cords following asphyxial CA/CPR. Experimental groups included a sham group, a group subjected to CA/CPR, and a therapeutic hypothermia group. Severe motor deficit of hind limbs was observed in the control group at 1 day after asphyxial CA/CPR. In the hypothermia group, motor deficit of hind limbs was significantly attenuated compared to that in the control group. Damage/death of motor neurons in the lumbar spinal cord was detected in the ventral horn at 1 day after asphyxial CA/CPR. Neuronal damage was significantly attenuated in the hypothermia group compared to that in the control group. These results indicated that therapeutic hypothermia after asphyxial CA/CPR significantly reduced hind limb motor dysfunction and motoneuronal damage/death in the ventral horn of the lumbar spinal cord following asphyxial CA/CPR. Thus, hypothermia might be a therapeutic strategy to decrease motor dysfunction by attenuating damage/death of spinal motor neurons following asphyxial CA/CPR.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.04.018,83,NA,1-7,NA,Asphyxial cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation; Spinal cord; Motor neuron; Paraplegia; Therapeutic hypothermia

Basically, the analytical solutions in the Laplace domain are easily obtainable. The influences of the fractional derivative and moving heat source velocity on the temperature of skin tissues and the thermal injuries are precisely investigated. The outcomes show that the fractional bioheat model are reduced to the hyperbolic and parabolic bioheat models when the fractional order parameter is equal to one and the relaxation time is close to zero respectively. The thermal injuries to the tissue are assessed by the denatured protein range using the formulation of Arrhenius. The numerical outcomes of thermal injuries and temperatures are graphically introduced.

The sensor has a detection area of 2 x 2 cm(2) and, in its current configuration, facilitates measurement with a resolution of 10 mW. In this paper, measurements of two healthy male subjects of different ages (24 and 60 years) are presented. We study the variation in the power dissipated by the human body surface as a function of time for a thermostat temperature of 28 degrees C. We also study the same power with thermostat temperatures varying from 24 degrees to 36 degrees C. Measurements are performed on three different surface areas of the human body: the sternum, abdomen, and hand. The ambient room temperature during all measurements was in the range of 22-24 degrees C, and the subjects were seated and resting. The results show that the heat flux in the trunk is much more stable than that in the hand and that the heat flux in the sternum is greater than that in other areas. Additionally, this flux is higher in the younger subject (42 mW/cm(2)) than in the older subject (35 mW/cm(2)). We also defined a thermal parameter that represents the thermal resistance between the sensor thermostat and the skin.

article,Thermogenic capacity in subterranean <i>Ctenomys</i>: Species-specific role of thermogenic mechanisms,"Luna, Facundo and Sastre-Serra, Jordi and Oliver, Jordi and Daniel Antenucci, C.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"One way to understand ecological patterns of species is to determine their physiological diversity on a large geographic and/or temporal scales, in a context of hierarchical biodiversity framework. In particular, macrophysiological studies analyze how environmental factors affect the physiology and therefore the distribution of species. Subterranean species are an excellent model for evaluating the large-scale effects of ambient temperature (T-a) conditions on thermal physiology and distribution, due to their extensive use of burrows that provide a relatively thermal stable environment. Species belonging to the genus Ctenomys are all subterranean and endemic of South America. Cold induced maximum metabolic rate (MMR), basal metabolic rate (BMR) and non shivering thermogenesis (NST) were analyzed, as well as the expression of uncoupled proteins (UCP) in brown adipose tissue (BAT). Biogeographical variables appear to have no effect MMR experimentally induced by cold condition within Ctenomys. Also, mechanisms of heat production are species-specific, varying from a combination of ST and NST to a complete use of shivering mechanisms. This pattern is correlated at tissue level, since species that use only ST show a smaller interscapular BAT patch, not detectable presence of UCP1 and low COX activity. Thus, other factors, including body mass, that constrain cold induced MMR could affect thermogenic variability among Ctenomys, In the evolutionary timescale, if low O-2 levels of burrows impose a ceiling in cold induced MMR, and ST is enhanced due to species-specific life history traits, such as digging effort, then the observed differences among Ctenomys species might be explained.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.01.012,80,NA,164-171,NA,Maximum metabolic rate; Thermogenesis; Uncoupling proteins; Subterranean rodents; Genus Ctenomys

When populations are found in isolated water bodies such as small lakes they will have to respond to stressful high temperatures by behavioral avoidance, phenotypic plasticity or microevolutionary change. We analyzed threespine sticklebacks from two large and two small lakes, representing different isolated populations. We determined maximum critical thermal limits (CTmax) and the associated gene expression responses in three heat shock (hsp60, hsp70, hsp90) and two key metabolic (idh2, fbp2) genes at ecologically relevant moderate heat stress (26 degrees C) as well as at the critical thermal limit (CTmax). CTmax showed slight variation across populations with no strong indication of local adaptation. Likewise, there was no strong evidence for local adaptation at the level of gene expression. The expression of the metabolic genes indicated a shift from aerobic towards anaerobic energy production with extreme heat stress. We conclude that threespine sticklebacks do not show severe stress during the warmest temperatures they are likely to encounter during current temperature regimes in Denmark, and following this show no sign of local adaptation even in small, isolated water bodies.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.06.003,75,NA,88-96,NA,Climate change; Thermal adaptation; QPCR; CTmax

The database containing information on the effects heat stress has on the productive and reproductive performance of lactating sows was composed by 20 articles published in international journals from 2000 to 2016, totalizing 2222 lactating sows. The duration of lactation was corrected to 21d. In the studies analyzed, the most representative variables were piglet weight at 21 days (kg) and litter weight at 21 days (kg). Daily ambient temperature (T degrees C) ranged from 15.0 degrees to 32.0 degrees C. Rectal temperature and respiratory rate were higher in lactating sows maintained in hot conditions compared to those maintained in the thermal comfort range. The nutrient intake by the lactating sows was inversely proportional to the ambient temperature. The piglets weaned of lactating sows were kept in thermal comfort 90.84 heavier percentage point after 21 days of the piglets of lactating sows kept in heat stress environment. Piglet weight gain exhibited a high and negative correlation with ambient temperature. At 1 degrees C above the thermal comfort range (from 15 to 25 degrees C) leads to a decrease in food intake (kg/d) and milk yield (kg/d), which represents a high and negative correlation with at room temperature, that is, as the ambient temperature increases, there is less consumption of nutrients, resulting in reduced milk production (less mobilization of nutrients to the mammary gland).

K. and Telles, Shirley",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The Pennes bio-heat model is based on Fourier's law of heat conduction, which assumed that a thermal signal propagate with infinite speed. This gives contradiction in physical situation. Also, the hyperbolic bio-heat model considers the micro scale response in time, but it does not explain the micro scale response in space. Therefore, to consider the thermal behaviour which is not captured by the Fourier's law and to take into account the microstructural effect in space, a dual phase lag (DPL) bio-heat conduction model would be advantageous. In this paper, a two dimensional DPL model is proposed to study the phase change heat transfer process during cryosurgery of lung cancer.

Physiological and biochemical adaptations are in place to facilitate global metabolic depression and protect against the consequences of whole body freezing. This study examined the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) transcription factor family, proteins responsible for coordinating selective gene expression of a myriad of cellular functions from muscle development and remodelling to various stress responses. Immunoblotting, subcellular localization, and RT-PCR were used to analyze the regulation of MEF2A and MEF2C transcription factors and selected downstream targets under their control at transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels in skeletal and cardiac muscles from control, frozen and thawed frogs. Both MEF2A/C proteins were freeze-responsive in skeletal muscle, displaying increases of 1.7-2 fold for phosphorylated MEF2A(Thr312) and MEF2C(Thr300) during freezing with an enrichment of nuclear phosphorylated MEF2 proteins (by 1.7-2.1 fold) observed as early as 4 h post-freezing. Despite the reduced response of total and phosphorylated MEF2A/C protein levels observed in cardiac muscle, the MEF2 downstream gene targets (glucose transporter-4, calreticulin, and creatine kinase brain and muscle isozymes) displayed similar increases in transcript levels (1.7-4.8 fold) after 24 h freezing in both muscle types. This study describes a novel freeze responsive function for MEF2 transcription factors and further elaborates our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying natural freeze tolerance. This novel freeze-responsive regulation suggests a role for MEF2s and downstream genes in myoprotectant glucose distribution, calcium homeostasis, and maintenance of energy reserves vital for successful freeze tolerance.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.04.007,67,NA,1-8,NA,Freeze tolerance; Myocyte enhancer factor 2; Heart; Skeletal muscle; Transcriptional regulation

Nevertheless, pre-cooling is often used in an attempt to improve subsequent performance. This study compared the effects of pre-cooling vs. a pre-thermoneutral application on central- and peripheral fatigue during 60\% of isometric maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) of the right quadriceps femoris muscle. Furthermore, the effects between a pre-cooling and a pre-thermoneutral application on isometric MVC of the right quadriceps femoris muscle and subjective ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were investigated. In this randomized controlled trial, 18 healthy adults voluntarily participated. The participants received either a cold (experimental) application (+8 degrees C) or a thermoneutral (control) application (+32 degrees C) for 20 min on their right thigh (one cuff). After the application, central (fractal dimension - FD) and peripheral (muscle fiber conduction velocity - CV) fatigue was estimated using sEMG parameters during 60\% of isometric MVC. Surface EMG signals were detected from the vastus medialis and lateralis using bidimensional arrays. Immediately after the submaximal contraction, isometric MVC and RPE were assessed. Participants receiving the cold application were able to maintain a 60\% isometric MVC significantly longer when compared to the thermoneutral group (mean time: 78 vs. 46 s; p=0.04). The thermoneutral application had no significant impact on central fatigue (p > 0.05) compared to the cold application (p=0.03). However, signs of peripheral fatigue were significantly higher in the cold group compared to the thermoneutral group (p=0.008). Pre-cooling had no effect on isometric MVC of the right quadriceps muscle and ratings of perceived exertion. Pre-cooling attenuated central fatigue and led to significantly longer submaximal contraction times compared to the pre-thermoneutral application.

Methods: Tumor geometries and volumetric heat generation rate distributions that are generated from microCT scans in our previous study are imported into COMSOL 4.3 (R) multiphysics for heat transfer simulations and heating protocol design using the Arrhenius damage model. Then, parametric studies are performed to evaluate how significantly the infusion rate affects the protocol design and its resulted collateral thermal damage. Results: The simulated temperature field in the generated tumor geometry and volumetric heat generation rate distribution are reasonable and correlates well with the amount of the total thermal energy deposited into the tumors. The time needed for complete thermal damage is determined to be approximately 12 min or 25 min if one uses the Arrhenius integral Omega equal to 1 or 4 as the damage threshold, when the infusion rate is 3 The heating time increases 26\% or 91\% in the higher infusion rate groups of 4 or 5 mu L/min, respectively. Collateral thermal damage to the surrounding tissue is also assessed. Although the two larger infusion rate groups can still cause thermal damage to the entire tumor, the collateral thermal damage would have exceeded the design criterion of 5\%, while the assessment criterion is acceptable only in the infusion rate group of 3 mu L/min.

Ectothermic animals unable to adjust their temperature by local migration, such as farmed fish kept in net pens, may become more vulnerable to contaminants in warmer seas.

Atlantic salmon hepatocytes, harvested from fish pre-acclimated either at 15 degrees C (optimal growth temperature) or 20 degrees C (heat-stressed), were exposed in vitro to two concentrations of Cd (control, 1 and 100 mu m Cd) for 48 h. Cd-induced cytotoxicity, determined with the xCELLigence system, was more pronounced in cells from fish pre-acclimated to a high temperature than in cells from fish grown at optimal temperature. A feed spiked with antioxidants could not ameliorate the Cd-induced cytotoxicity in cells from temperature-stressed fish. At the transcriptional level, Cd exposure affected 11 out of 20 examined genes, of which most are linked to oxidative stress. The transcriptional levels of a majority of the altered genes were changed in cells harvested from fish grown at sub-optimal temperature. Interaction effects between Cd exposure and fish pre-acclimation temperature were seen for four transcripts, hmox1, mapk1, fth1 and mmp13. Overall, this study shows that cells from temperature-stressed fish are modestly more vulnerable to Cd stress, and indicate that mechanisms linked to oxidative stress may be differentially affected in temperature-stressed cells.

The change in culture water temperature may not only modify various chemical and biological processes but also affect the status of fish populations. In previous studies, high temperature induced apoptosis and oxidative stress. However, the precise mechanism and the pathways that are activated in fish are still unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effects of high temperature (34 degrees C) on the induction of apoptosis and oxidative stress in pufferfish (Takifugu obscurus) blood cells. The data showed that high temperature exposure increased oxygen species (ROS), cytoplasmic free-Ca2+ concentration and cell apoptosis. To test the apoptotic pathway, the expression pattern of some key apoptotic related genes including P53, Bax, caspase 9 and caspase 3 were examined. The results showed that acute high temperature stress induced up-regulation of these genes, suggesting that the p53-Bax pathway and the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway could be involved in apoptosis induced by high temperature stress. Furthermore, the gene expression of antioxidant enzymes (Cu/Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD, CAT, GPx, and GR) and heat shock proteins (HSP90 and HSP70) in the blood cells were induced by high temperature stress. Taken together, our results showed that high temperature-induced oxidative stress may cause pufferfish blood cells apoptosis, and cooperatively activated p53-Bax and caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway.

article,"Do sex, body size and reproductive condition influence the thermal preferences of a large lizard? A study in <i>Tupinambis merianae</i>","Roctolfo Cecchetto, Nicelas and Naretto, Sergio",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Body temperature is a key factor in physiological processes, influencing lizard performances; and life history traits are expected to generate variability of thermal preferences in different individuals. Gender, body size and reproductive condition may impose specific requirements on preferred body temperatures. If these three factors have different physiological functions and thermal requirements, then,the preferred temperature may represent a compromise that optimizes these physiological functions. Therefore, the body temperatures that lizards select in a controlled environment may reflect a temperature that maximizes their physiological needs. The tegu lizard Tupinambis merianae is one of the largest lizards in South America and has wide ontogenetic variation in body size and sexual dimorphism. In the present study we evaluate intraspecific variability of thermal preferences of T. merianae. We determined the selected body temperature and the rate at which males and females attain their selected temperature, in relation to body size and reproductive condition. We also compared the behavior in the thermal gradient between males and females and between reproductive condition of individuals. Our study show that T merianae selected body temperature within a narrow range of temperatures variation in the laboratory thermal gradient, with 36.24 +/- 1.49 degrees C being the preferred temperature. We observed no significant differences between sex, body size and reproductive condition in thermal preferences. Accordingly, we suggest that the evaluated categories of 1: merianae have similar thermal requirements. Males showed higher rates to obtain heat than females and reproductive females, higher rates than non-reproductive ones females. Moreover, males and reproductive females showed a more dynamic behavior in the thermal gradient. Therefore, even though they achieve the same selected temperature, they do it differentially.

Rewarming from torpor can be costly. In some small mammals basking is used to reduce the cost of rewarming from torpor. The use and duration of basking was measured in two native Australian marsupials, the red-tailed phascogale (Phascogale calura) and kultarr (Antechinomys laniger), using a heat rock. Animals were observed via video cameras to determine whether they used basking behaviours and whether this behaviour was affected by food availability. Both species became accustomed to the heat rock as time progressed. Absence of food increased basking duration and frequency in some individuals but not all animals. Generally kultarrs basked for longer periods than phascogales, and kultarrs would bask at all hours of the day while phascogales showed a strict nocturnal regime (1900-0700 h). The results demonstrate that basking may be an important behavioural adaptation of the kultarr; while the phascogale requires further research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Gross mismatch between thermal tolerances and environmental temperatures in a tropical freshwater snail: Climate warming and evolutionary implications,"Polgar, Gianluca and Khang, Tsung Fei and Chua, Teddy and Marshall, David J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The relationship between acute thermal tolerance and habitat temperature in ectotherm animals informs about their thermal adaptation and is used to assess thermal safety margins and sensitivity to climate warming. We studied this relationship in an equatorial freshwater snail (Clea nigricans), belonging to a predominantly marine gastropod lineage (Neogastropoda, Buccinidae). We found that tolerance of heating and cooling exceeded average daily maximum and minimum temperatures, by roughly 20 degrees C in each case. Because habitat temperature is generally assumed to be the main selective factor acting on the fundamental thermal niche, the discordance between thermal tolerance and environmental temperature implies trait conservation following `in situ' environmental change, or following novel colonisation of a thermally less-variable habitat. Whereas heat tolerance could relate to an historical association with the thermally variable and extreme marine intertidal fringe zone, cold tolerance could associate with either an ancestral life at higher latitudes, or represent adaptation to cooler, higher-altitudinal, tropical lotic systems. The broad upper thermal safety margin (difference between heat tolerance and maximum environmental temperature) observed in this snail is grossly incompatible with the very narrow safety margins typically found in most terrestrial tropical ectotherms (insects and lizards), and hence with the emerging prediction that tropical ectotherms, are especially vulnerable to environmental warming. A more comprehensive understanding of climatic vulnerability of animal ectotherms thus requires greater consideration of taxonomic diversity, ecological transition and evolutionary history.

But the biological function of HSP32 in this injury is unclear. To investigate the underlying role of HSP32, RT-PCR, immunocytochemical staining and ELISA were applied to confirm the expression of HSP32. And the underlying mechanism in the pathogenesis of hepatic dysfunction following hyperthermic challenge and the possible involvement of oxidative stress to induce oxidative deterioration of liver functions in developing mice were investigated in this study. Caspase-3mRNA expression and caspase-3 activity of heated liver were also analysed. The results showed that liver injury caused by chronic heat stress(39 C, 1.5 h/day for 6 weeks) was reversible, caspase-3mRNA expression and caspase-3 activity of heat treated mice were increased after the first three weeks of heat exposure (P <0.05) and high expression levels of HSP32 were observed throughout the duration of experiment (P < 0.01). A strong correlation exists between heat-induced liver injury and the induction of HSP32, which suggested that the reversibility of liver injury is involved in the induction of HSP32 in the hepatic cells under continuing heat stress.

As lizards shuttled between warm and cool areas, their movements were typically slow; punctuated by bursts of speed. The animals were relatively inactive when heating, moved almost continually when cooling, and spent less time heating than cooling. Traditional modeling techniques proved unsuccessful, so we assessed the movement patterns with nonlinear dynamical techniques. The shuttling frequency, and the pattern of velocity changes, both met the qualitative attributes (self similarity, strange attractors, and noisy power spectra) and the quantitative criteria (positive Lyapunov exponent and capacity and/or correlation dimensions less than 5) that suggest deterministic chaos. These movement patterns appear regular, but at unpredictable times the patterns become disturbed before returning to regulation. There are both behavioral and physiological advantages to movements that follow a model of deterministic chaos control. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

article,"Heat tolerance and physiological plasticity in the Antarctic collembolan, <i>Cryptopygus antarcticus</i>, and mite, <i>Alaskozetes antarcticus</i>","Everatt, M. J. and Convey, P. and Worland, M. R. and Bale, J. S. and Hayward, S. A. L.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Polar amplification of global warming has led to an average 2 degrees C rise in air temperatures in parts of the polar regions in the last 50 years. Poikilothermic ectotherms that are found in these regions, such as Collembola and mites, may therefore be put under pressure by changing environmental conditions. However, it has also been suggested that the thermal sensitivity of invertebrates declines with higher latitudes and, therefore, that polar ectotherms may not be at risk. In the current study, the heat tolerance and physiological plasticity to heat stress of two well-studied Antarctic invertebrates, the collembolan, Cryptopygus antarcticus, and the mite, Alaskozetes antarcticus, were investigated. Both species showed considerable heat tolerance, with each having an Upper Lethal Temperature (ULT) above 35 degrees C (1 h exposure). These species were also able to survive for over 43 d at 10 degrees C and for periods of 5-20 min at 40 degrees C. Across all experimental procedures, A. antarcticus possessed a somewhat greater level of heat tolerance than C antarcticus. Water loss during short duration exposures did not differ between the two species at 30, 35 and 40 degrees C, suggesting that the greater tolerance of A. antarcticus over this timescale was not due to higher desiccation resistance. Physiological plasticity was investigated by testing for Rapid Heat Hardening (RHH) and long-term acclimation. RHH was observed to a small degree in both species at a warming rate of 0.5 degrees C min(-1), and also 0.2 degrees C min(-1) in A. antarcticus alone. Longer-term acclimation (1 week at 10 degrees C) did not enhance the heat tolerance of either species. Even with this limited physiological plasticity, the results of this study indicate that C antarcticus and A. antarcticus have capacity in their heat tolerance to cope with current and future environmental extremes of high temperature.

article,"Effect of low-quality diet on torpor frequency and depth in the pichi <i>Zaedyus pichiy</i> (Xenarthra, Dasypodidae), a South American armadillo","Superina, Mariella and Jahn, Graciela A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Daily torpor is a physiological adaptation that allows mammals to cope with energetic challenges associated with unpredictable periods of food shortage. We experimentally tested whether food quality influences torpor frequency and depth in the pichi (Zaedyus pichiy), a small, opportunistically omnivorous armadillo endemic to arid and semi-arid habitats of southern South America. We recorded body temperature (T-sc) changes in 10 semi-captive, adult female pichis using dataloggers implanted subcutaneously during periods of 21 days. All individuals entered spontaneous daily torpor, but those receiving a low-quality diet had significantly lower daily mean and minimum T-sc, spent more time at T-sc below their individual lower limit of normothermia, and had a higher Heterothermy Index than controls. Five individuals entered prolonged torpor bouts lasting more than 24 h, two of them repeatedly. Nine out of ten prolonged torpor bouts occurred in individuals feeding on a low-quality diet, suggesting that pichis are able to enter prolonged periods of torpor during severe environmental stress. In combination with their ability to hibernate and to respond to a reduced insect abundance by ingesting other food items, this physiological adaptation allows pichis to better cope with food shortages and a more extreme climate than other armadillos. It may explain why Z pichiy naturally occurs farther south than any other armadillo species. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The open reading frame of acot11 beta was found to be 594 bp in length, encoding 198 amino acids. We determined the transcript levels of acot11 beta in ten tissues of hybrid yellow catfish by qRT-PCR and found that it was highly expressed in the liver, so we chose the liver for further analysis.

The physiological responses (core temperature, skin temperature, heart rate, oxygen consumption) and perceptual parameters (thermal sensation, thermal comfort, rate of perceived exertion (RPE), and restriction to movement) were recorded throughout the tests. The results showed that the use of SRBA resulted in higher values of core temperature, mean skin temperature, heart rate, and oxygen consumption during exercise, and a significant difference (p < 0.05) between the SRBA and Control trials in terms of oxygen consumption was observed. The subjects wearing SRBA exhibited higher RPE and restriction to movement during exercise when compared with those in the Control condition, and a significant difference (p < 0.05) between the two trials in terms of restriction to movement was observed. Moreover, no significant differences (p > 0.05) in terms of thermal sensation and thermal comfort were observed between the SRBA and Control trials.

We use standardized thermal methodologies to estimate temperature acclimation ranges, upper and lower acclimation response ratios, and thermal niche areas in common (Periophthalmus kalolo) and barred (Periophthalmus argentilineatus) mudskippers in air and water. Common and barred mudskippers had an upper chronic limit of 37.0 degrees C, and respective low chronic temperatures of 14.0 and 11.4 degrees C, resulting in acclimation scope values of 23.0 degrees C and 25.6 degrees C. Both fishes had moderately large thermal niches, with barred mudskipper expressing larger niche areas in both water and air than common mudskipper (676.6 and 704.2 degrees C-2 compared to 641.6 and 646.5 degrees C-2). Acclimation response ratios were relatively low, with fish gaining or losing between 0.10 and 0.43 degrees C of heat tolerance with each 1 degrees C change in acclimation temperature. Although intraspecific total niche areas remained largely unchanged between media (<= 10\%), both species showed a slight increase in heat tolerance but a notable upward shift in intrinsic tolerance when emerged. Media-dependent thermal niche adjustment is a unique, and thus far undescribed physiological adaptation that in combination with behavioral responses, allow mudskippers to thrive in some of the most austere thermal environments experienced by any fish.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.02.023,81,NA,170-177,NA,Air-breathing fish; Thermal tolerance; Mangrove; Temperature tolerance polygon; Ectotherms

The fact that SMR increases with rising temperatures and gradually decreases after 25 degrees C indicates that the preferred temperature ranges of juvenile European sea bass are between 25 and 30 degrees C.

article,Preterm birth and ambient temperature: Strong association during night-time and warm seasons,"Zhong, Qiong and Lu, Chan and Zhang, Weishe and Zheng, Xiangrong and Deng, Qihong",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Background: Mounting evidence have linked high temperature with increased incidence of preterm birth (PTB), but which time period(s) of increase in temperature within a day and a year during pregnancy play an important role in PTB is not clarified. Objective: This study aims to determine the critical time period(s) of heat exposure on the development of PTB by exploring the risk of PTB for temperature increase during 24 h of a whole day and each of four seasons during pregnancy. Methods: A cohort study was performed with 3509 preschool children in Changsha, China, which evaluated the prevalence of PTB using a questionnaire filled out by the children's parents. The authors estimated the temperature at which each mother was exposed to outdoor air temperature during three trimesters and for 24 h in different seasons of pregnancy. The logistic regression models in regard to odds ratio (OR) and 95\% confidence interval (CI) was applied to study associations of PTB with an increase in temperature during different time windows. Results: Prevalence of PTB (4.1\%) was associated with outdoor temperature with adjusted ORs (95\% CI) = 1.34 (1.11-1.62) for increase of 1 degrees C in temperature exposure during pregnancy, and this association was significantly higher in spring and summer than autumn and winter. Specifically, high temperature during summer night posed the highest risk of PM, with peaks during 03:00-04:00 a.m. We further found that PTB was associated with exposure to temperature and extreme heat day during the 2nd trimester, with ORs = 1.03 (1.00-1.06) and 1.01 (1.00-1.02) respectively. Foetus with male sex and older mothers were more sensitive to the impact of heat exposure during pregnancy on PTB, with higher risk observed during night time. Conclusion: Our study indicates that heat exposure was related to an elevated risk of PTB, with higher risk of PTB for nocturnal exposure and warm seasons.

article,Assessment of MRI issues at 1.5 T for the Temperature Logger Implant,"Mahrouyan, Omeed and Toien, Oivind and Shellock, Frank G.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Purpose: The Temperature Logger Implant is a newly developed device that is capable of providing data for animal studies on thermoregulatory function, hibernation, hypothermia, and general health. During research, it may be necessary to conduct a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination on an animal with this device implanted to assess anatomical changes or other conditions. Notably, this new device was specially designed to be unaffected by the electromagnetic fields used for MRI. Therefore, to verify that there would be no problems related to MRI, the purpose of this investigation was to evaluate MRI-related issues for the Temperature Logger Implant. Methods: Tests were performed on the Temperature Logger Implant using well-accepted techniques to evaluate magnetic field interactions (translational attraction and torque, 1.5 T), MRI-related heating (whole body averaged specific absorption rate, 2.9 W/kg), artifacts (T1-weighted, spin echo and gradient echo pulse sequences), and functional changes related to exposure to eight different imaging conditions. Results: Magnetic field interactions were relatively low (deflection angle 4 degrees, no torque) and heating was minor (highest temperature rise, >= 1.1 degrees C) indicating that these factors will not pose a hazard to an animal. The largest artifact (gradient echo pulse sequence) extended 10 mm from the size and shape of the Temperature Logger Implant. Exposure to the eight different conditions at 1.5 T/64 MHz did not alter or damage the operational aspects of the device. Conclusions: The findings demonstrated that MRI can be performed safely on an animal with this new Temperature Logger Implant and, thus, this device is deemed ``MR Conditional{''} (i.e., using current labeling terminology), according to the conditions used in this investigation.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.03.003,74,NA,249-255,NA,Specific absorption rate; MRI safety; American Society for Testing and Materials; International; Body temperature; Data logger

Here, we analyze the function of recombinant AgsA, a small heat shock protein from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimwium under combined temperature and zinc stress in E. coli. Our results show that the heterologous expression of AgsA significantly increases the tolerance of E. coli cells to the combined effect of temperature stress and zinc toxicity by maintaining the stability of soluble proteins. Furthermore, there was remarkable and significant difference in the half effect concentration (EC50) of zinc at all temperatures treatments in both test cells. The EC50s of zinc at 37 degrees C, 42 degrees C and 50 degrees C were 15.24 mg/L, 29.30 mg/L, and 5.98 mg/L respectively in the AgsA-transformed E. colt cells, and 3.03 mg/L, 2.38 mg/L, and 0.373 mg/L, respectively in the control cells lacking AgsA. Together, our data indicate a good concentration-response relationship between all three temperatures treatment and zinc toxicity in E. colt, and establish for the first time the combined effects of temperature and zinc toxicity on E. colt cells. Also, the AgsA protein response to combined thermal and metal stress could serve as a molecular biomarker for the assessment of interactive stress damage to the cells.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.01.007,72,NA,137-142,NA,E. coli; Zinc; Molecular biomarkei; EC50; SHSPs; AgsA

Many traits in ectotherms have optimal performance within specific temperature ranges. Altitudinal gradients are potentially informative for characterizing differences of sibling species distributions. We collected two sibling species of the tripunctata group - Drosophila mediopunctata (MPT) and D. unipunctata (UNI) - at eight altitudes (ranging from 593 to 1185 m above sea level) located at a continuous Atlantic Rainforest reserve in consecutive years (2009-2011), with two collections at the hot-rainy season and two at the cold-dry season. Mean altitude was significantly different between species and seasons. Their distributions showed a consistent pattern with MPT always occurring at higher altitudes than UNI. A significant correlation was found between altitude and species relative abundance. We characterized the thermal range of fertility, an important fitness component, for each species and found evidence for differential thermal adaptation. Our results suggest that the two species altitudinal distributions and seasonal relative abundances are consistent with their differential thermal adaptations: MPT seems to be adapted to lower temperatures, occupies higher altitudes and occurs at higher relative abundances in the cold-dry season; while UNI tolerates higher temperatures and occurs at lower altitudes and higher relative abundances in the hot-rainy season. However, their thermal ranges overlap at most temperatures, suggesting that additional variables (e.g. habitat choice, competition, differential survival etc.) may also play a role to determine their distribution in the field.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.10.019,71,NA,69-73,NA,Species abundance; Species range limit; Fitness

However, a heat risk evaluation by WBGT requires adjustments depending on the clothing. In this study, we proposed a new effective WBGT (WBGT(eff){*}) for general vapor permeable clothing ensembles and vapor impermeable protective clothing that is applicable to occupants engaged in moderate intensity work with a metabolic heat production value of around 174 W/m(2). WBGT(eff){* enables the conversion of heat stress into the scale experienced by the occupant dressed in the basic clothing ensemble (work clothes) based on the heat balances for a human body. We confirmed that WBGT(eff){*} was effective for expressing the critical thermal environments for the prescriptive zones for occupants wearing vapor impermeable protective clothing. Based on WBGT(eff){*}, we succeeded in clarifying how the weights for natural wet bulb, globe, and air temperatures and the intercept changed depending on clothing properties and the surrounding environmental factors when heat stress is expressed by the weighted sum of natural wet bulb, globe, and air temperatures and the intercept. The weight of environmental temperatures (globe and air temperatures) for WBGT(eff){*} for vapor impermeable protective clothing increased compared with that for general vapor permeable clothing, whereas that of the natural wet bulb temperature decreased.

Bama miniature pig show a heat tolerance in hot summer months. However, the physiological condition of liver under high ambient temperature has not been well elucidated in Bama miniature pig. Here we performed an experiment to investigate the effects of high ambient temperature on liver function, redox status and Nrf2 antioxidant pathway in Bama miniature pigs. Twelve pigs were randomly divided into two groups and separately exposed to the neutral temperature (NT, 25 degrees C) and high temperature (HT, 40 degrees C) for 8 days. The hepatic damage marker, such as total bilirubin (TBIL), alkaline phosphatase (AKP), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidas (gamma-GT), alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartase transminase (AST), didn't reach statistical significance between NT and HT group. Moreover, abnormal observation of hepatic histology and hepatocyte ultrastructure were not detected in HT group. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and catalase (CAT) as well as glutathione (GSH) content, were dramatically increased after heat exposure.

article,Effects of pregnancy on body temperature and locomotor performance of velvet geckos,"Dayananda, Buddhi and Ibarguengoytia, Nora and Whiting, Martin J. and Webb, Jonathan K.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Pregnancy is a challenging period for egg laying squamates. Carrying eggs can encumber females and decrease their locomotor performance, potentially increasing their risk of predation. Pregnant females can potentially reduce this handicap by selecting higher temperatures to increase their sprint speed and ability to escape from predators, or to speed up embryonic development and reduce the period during which they are burdened with eggs ('selfish mother' hypothesis). Alternatively, females might select more stable body temperatures during pregnancy to enhance offspring fitness ('maternal manipulation hypothesis'), even if the maintenance of such temperatures compromises a female's locomotor performance. We investigated whether pregnancy affects the preferred body temperatures and locomotor performance of female velvet geckos Amalosia lesueurii. We measured running speed of females during late pregnancy, and one week after they laid eggs at four temperatures (20 degrees, 25 degrees, 30 degrees and 35 degrees C). Preferred body temperatures of females were measured in a cost-free thermal gradient during late pregnancy and one week after egg-laying. Females selected higher and more stable set-point temperatures when they were pregnant (mean =29.0 C, T-set =27.8-30.5 degrees C) than when they were non-pregnant (mean =26.2 degrees C, Tset =23.7-28.7 degrees C). Pregnancy was also associated with impaired performance; females sprinted more slowly at all four test temperatures when burdened with eggs. Although females selected higher body temperatures during late pregnancy, this increase in temperature did not compensate for their impaired running performance. Hence, our results suggest that females select higher temperatures during pregnancy to speed up embryogenesis and reduce the period during which they have reduced performance. This strategy may decrease a female's probability of encountering predatory snakes that use the same microhabitats for thermoregulation. Selection of stable temperatures by pregnant females may also benefit embryos, but manipulative experiments are necessary to test this hypothesis.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.02.005,65,NA,64-68,NA,Maternal manipulation; Costs of reproduction; Amalosia lesueurii; Locomotor impairment; Lizard; Reptile

A. and Spiers, D. E.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Heat stress in feedlot cattle is known to reduce their performance. The challenge comes in determining reliable predictors of current and near-future changes in thermal status and performance. A 42-d study, using crossbred (Bos taurus) steers was conducted during summer months (July through August) to identify best environmental determinants of rumen temperature (T-rumen) and feed intake (FI) in feedlot cattle with access to shade. A further goal was to define the relationship between T-rumen and FI. Shade coverage was approximately 50\%, and all animals were provided standard feedlot diets and water ad libitum. Intraruminal telemetric boluses recorded T-rumen, several times each hour. Ear tags, telemetrically connected to a feed monitoring system, provided Fl data using RFID technology. Data loggers recorded ambient conditions in sun and shade, along with black globe temperature. Regression analyses identified daylight black globe and air temperatures in shade, with one hour delays, as the best predictors of T-rumen. Prediction of FI was much less reliable. Unexpectedly, T-rumen was not superior to ambient variables in predicting FI. Maximum daily temperature humidity index, calculated using BG in sun with a 5-d lag, was the best significant predictor of FI. These results indicate for feedlot cattle that although air temperature alone in the shade may be the best predictor of T-rumen in the heat, black globe temperature in the sun may be a better determinant of feed intake over time. Additional studies are needed to verify the delayed Fl response which seems unusually long.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.11.015,63,NA,104-111,NA,Telemetry; Heat stress; Feedlot; Environmental physiology
article,Finite element model to study temperature distribution in skin and deep tissues of human limbs,"Agrawal, Mamta and Pardasani, K. R.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The temperature of body tissues is viewed as an indicator of tissue response in clinical applications since ancient times. The tissue temperature depends on various physical and physiological parameters like blood flow, metabolic heat generation, thermal conductivity of tissues, shape and size of organs etc. In this paper a finite element model has been proposed to study temperature distribution in skin and deep tissues of human limbs. The geometry of human limb is taken as elliptical tapered shape. It is assumed that outer surface of the limb is exposed to the environment. The appropriate boundary conditions have been framed based on physical conditions of the problem. The model has been developed for a three dimensional steady state case. Hexahedral circular sectoral elements are used to discretize the region. The results have been computed to obtain temperature profiles and study the relation of tissue temperature with the parameters like atmospheric temperature, rate of evaporation, thickness of tissues layers and shape of the limb.

article,Effect of tidal regime on the thermal tolerance of the marine gastropod <i>Lunella smaragda</i> (Gmelin 1791),"Mortensen, B. J. D. and Dunphy, B. J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The tidal cycle around New Zealand results in spring low tides consistently occurring during the hottest part of the day (mid-afternoon) in north-eastern New Zealand, and during the cooler dawn/dusk periods in the north-west of the country. We hypothesised that due to mid-afternoon spring low tides, intertidal populations residing at north-eastern sites would show greater thermotolerance than their north-west conspecifics. To test this we used the marine gastropod, Lunella smaragda, which were collected from sites on both the East and West coasts of the Auckland region and exposed to an acute heat shock. Thermotolerance was measured as survivorship (LT50), drop down time (time to heat coma) and thermal stability of the anaerobic energy producing enzyme Tauropine dehydrogenase. Furthermore, temperature loggers were deployed at each site so as to record and compare thermal regimes among sites. A strong temperature spike associated with spring low tide was found at all sites, and maximal temperatures of all East coast sites were higher than West coast sites (in some case by up to 10 degrees C). In terms of thermotolerance, mortality of L. smaragda occurred at 42 degrees C leading to 100\% mortality at 45 degrees C. However, comparison of LT50 showed snails were equally thermotolerant regardless of site of collection. Similar results were found in TDH thermal stability with animals from all sites showing an approximately 80\% decrease in enzyme activity after 10 min exposure to 42 degrees C. Whilst drop down times were different among sites these were correlated with animal size as opposed to site of collection. Thus, East coast populations of L. smaragda appear no more thermotolerant than their West coast counterparts. Such a result is concerning as maximal temperatures at East coast sites already exceed the LT50 values of L. smaragda recorded in the lab suggesting these populations have less of a thermal safety margin.

article,Effect of salinity on the upper lethal temperature tolerance of early-juvenile red drum,"McDonald, Dusty and Bumguardner, Britt and Cason, Paul",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Previous work investigating the temperature tolerance of juvenile red drum ranging 18-50 mm TL found evidence for positive size dependence (smaller fish less tolerant to higher temperatures) suggesting smaller size classes ( < 18 mm TL) potentially may succumb to extreme summer water temperatures. Here, we explored the upper lethal temperature tolerance (ULT) in smaller-sized red drum which ranged from 10 to 20 mm TL across multiple salinities to further understand the thermal limitations of this propagated game fish. In order to investigate the combined effect of temperature and salinity on ULT, temperature trials were conducted under three levels of salinity which commonly occur along the coast of Texas (25, 35, and 45 ppt). The rate of temperature increase (+0.25 degrees C/h) was designed to mimic a natural temperature increase of a summer day in Texas. We determined that the lethal temperature at 50\% (LT50) did not differ between the three salinities examined statistically; median lethal temperature for individuals exposed to 25 ppt ranged from 36.4 to 37.7 degrees C, 35 ppt ranged from 36.4 to 37.7 degrees C, and 45 ppt ranged from 36.1 to 37.4 degrees C.

Therefore, the present study assessed the relationship between neuromuscular activation and skin temperature during cycle exercise. Ten physically active participants performed an incremental workload cycling test to exhaustion while neuromuscular activations were recorded (via surface electromyography - EMG) from rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, biceps femoris and gastrocnemius medialis. Thermographic images were recorded before, immediately after and 10 min after finishing the cycling test, at four body regions of interest corresponding to the muscles where neuromuscular activations were monitored. Frequency band analysis was conducted to assess spectral properties of EMG signals in order to infer on priority in recruitment of motor units. Significant inverse relationship between changes in skin temperature and changes in overall neuromuscular activation for vastus lateralis was observed (r < -0.5 and p < 0.04). Significant positive relationship was observed between skin temperature and low frequency components of neuromuscular activation from vastus lateralis (r > 0.7 and p < 0.01). Participants with larger overall activation and reduced low frequency component for vastus lateralis activation presented a better adaptive response of their thermoregulatory system by showing fewer changes in skin temperature after incremental cycling test.

article,Environmental remodelling of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission: Rise of the anoxia-tolerant turtle brain,"Hogg, D. W. and Hawrysh, P. J. and Buck, L. T.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Climate cooling over the past one hundred thousand years has resulted in seasonal ice cover at northern and southern latitudes that has selected for hypoxia and anoxia tolerance in some species, such as freshwater turtles. At the northern reaches of their range, North American freshwater turtles spend 4 months or more buried in the mud bottom of ice covered lakes and ponds. From a comparative perspective this gives us the opportunity to understand how an extremely oxygen-sensitive organ, such as the vertebrate brain, can function without oxygen for long periods. Brain function is based on complex excitatory (on) and inhibitory (off) circuits involving the major neurotransmitters glutamate and, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) respectively. When a mammalian brain becomes anoxic, glutamate levels rise within minutes resulting in excitotoxic cell death which does not occur in anoxic turtle brain.

Laser absorption is enhanced by embedding gold-silica nanoshells in the tumor. Heat transfer in the tissue is modeled using Weinbaum-Jiji bioheat transfer equation. With laser irradiation, the volumetric radiation is accounted in the governing bioheat equation. Radiative information needed in the bioheat equation is calculated using the discrete ordinate method, and the coupled bioheat-radiation equation is solved using the finite volume method. Effects of power density, laser exposure time, beam radius, diameter of blood vessel and volume fractions of nanoshells on temperature spread in the tissue are analyzed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Refining the distinction between heat tolerant and intolerant individuals during a Heat tolerance test,"Amit, Druyan and Itay, Ketko and Ran, Yanovich and Yoram, Epstein and Yuval, Heled",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Background: The heat tolerance test (HIT) is a standardized physiological test that constitutes one of the considerations in the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) for return to duty after a heat injury. The HTT consists of a 2 h controlled exercise-heat stress with a threshold of maximal rectal temperature (Tc) and heart rate (HR) values above which subjects are referred to as heat intolerant; the dynamics of the HR and Tc during the test, which tend to plateau during the 2nd hour of the test, is also considered. Since ``tendency to plateau{''} is a subjective measure, this study aimed to quantify the tendency to plateau during a HTT. Material and methods: The physiological results of 102 HTT subjects (83 normal and 19 heat-intolerant) served as the database for analysis. The first 28 subjects, who were considered heat tolerant (HT) by an experienced examiner, served to evaluate a ``normal{''} dynamic of Tc and HR during a HTT Then, we applied the results on seven heat tolerant and seven heat intolerant (HI) subjects in order to determine which of the two variables (dTc or dHR) in different time intervals (t(120-0), t(60-0), t(120-60), and t(120-100)) may best distinguish heat tolerant from heat intolerant subjects. During the 3rd stage of the study 60 random test results (post factum: 48 heat tolerant and 12 heat intolerant subjects) were evaluated. Post-hoc results of heat tolerance determined by dTc were compared to the expert diagnosis of the test. Results: A rise of less than 0.45 degrees C in Tc during the 2nd hour of the HTF was found acceptable to define a tendency to plateau of the Tc with a 100\% sensitivity and specificity. We did not find a numerical value of HR increase over time during the HTT acceptable to define a tendency of the HR to plateau. Conclusion: During the last hour of the heat tolerance test, there is a tendency to plateau in Tc in heat tolerant individuals. It is concluded that a rise in Tc of less than 0.45 degrees C during this period (Tc120-60) can be used as a supporting measure to distinguish between heat tolerant and heat intolerant individuals.

article,Potential energy expenditure by litter-roosting bats associated with temperature under leaf litter during winter,"Perry, Roger W.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In temperate portions of North America, some bats that remain active during winter undergo short periods of hibernation below leaf litter on the forest floor during episodes of below-freezing weather. These winter roosts may provide above-freezing conditions, but the thermal conditions under leaf litter are unclear. Further, little is known of the relationship between temperatures under litter and potential energy expenditure by bats. Therefore, I characterized thermal conditions below leaf litter, compared temperatures encountered under different litter depths, and evaluated the quality of these sites as hibernacula based on potential energy use by eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis) during winter in forests of the Ouachita Mountains, Arkansas, USA. Over an averaged 24-h period, there was no significant difference in temperature among different depths of leaf litter, but temperatures under litter remained significantly warmer than air temperatures, especially during nighttime and under snow cover. Temperatures below leaf litter were significantly warmer on south-facing slopes than north-facing slopes, but predicted metabolic rates did not differ among aspects. Predicted metabolic rates of eastern red bats were lowest under the deepest leaf litter measured (8 cm) and highest under ambient air conditions. Depending on depth of leaf litter cover, predicted energy savings based on 02 consumption from roosting under litter were 1.9 to 3.1 times greater than remaining in ambient air during periods of freezing weather and around 5.6 times greater when roosting under leaf litter with snow cover. A model for predicted total energy consumption (estimated as the total oxygen consumption during a 24-h period) by eastern red bats indicated that when roosting below leaf litter, energy consumption would be reduced with greater ground temperatures, greater leaf litter moisture, and when located on south-facing slopes. Predicted metabolic rates and total energy consumption may provide more insight on the quality of roost sites for wintering bats than temperature of roost sites alone.

Herein, physiological regulation of C. quadricarinatus was investigated following exposure to low temperature stress at 9 +/- 2 degrees C for 4 weeks. Hepatopancreas tissue was tested for nonspecific enzyme activity, histological structure, and transcriptome sequencing analyses. The results showed that the activities of nonspecific enzymes were inhibited following low temperature stress. Ultrastructural observation revealed that the hepatopancreas structure was oxidatively damaged at low temperature, with numerous autophagic vesicles visible. Apoptosis in the hepatopancreas was significantly increased in the cold stress group, indicating diminished function. Transcriptome sequencing identified 2615 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) following low temperature stress, of which 1147 and 1468 were up- and down-regulated, respectively. Functional analysis of DEGs indicated involvement in substance metabolism, antioxidant defences, signal transduction, and immune responses. Therefore, chronic cold stress can suppress metabolism and cause oxidative damage and immune deficiency in crayfish. The findings provide fundamental molecular information for further study of the regulatory mechanisms of cold tolerance in red claw crayfish.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102404,85,NA,NA,102404,Cherax quadricarinatus; Low temperature response; Enzyme activity; Ultrastructure; RNA-Seq; Expression analysis
article,Effect of inspiration cycle and ventilation rate on heat exchange in human respiratory airways,"Soni, Bharat and Nayak, Ameeya Kumar",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,A transient three dimensional (3D) theoretical axisymmetric model is developed for heat exchange across the human respiratory tract during inspiration phase and applied to study the changes in the airway temperature and velocity profile for varying ventilation rates and inhalation temperatures. A multi-compartment approach is used to study the same to avoid the airway scaling problem from micro to nano scale. This analysis also includes the role of water evaporation in mucus and non perfused tissue layers and the role of capillary bed in thermal variations during respiration. The results of heat transfer in airway and mucus layer depend on the local morphological parameters. The results are compared with the case of hypothetical regular geometry to show the significance of local morphology. The location where the inhaled air gets saturated with the body core temperature is computed to estimate the saturation distance of air. The complete analysis is made for two breathing cycles with different inhalation to exhalation ratios. The results indicate that decreasing the ventilation rate and increasing the respiration cycle can avoid the deep penetration of heat into the tract and consequently tissue thermal injury can be avoided. We have also explained numerically the role of mucus layer in avoiding tissue injury in infra-thoracic airways. We have also observed a significant difference in results for high ventilation rates between the cases of actual (cast replica) and regular airway geometry. The numerical results are in good adjustment with existing experimental data and thus validate our approach.,2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.026,84,NA,357-367,NA,Air conditioning; Multi-compartment mathematical model; Mucus layer; Respiration cycle
article,Numerical simulation of heat induced flow-mediated dilation of blood vessels,"Wang, Yabo and Zhu, Kai and Wang, Jinshan and Yang, Long",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Local heat can accelerate the blood circulation and induce the vasodilatation. Investigators reported that local heat causes an increase in skin blood flow consisting of two phases. The first is solely sensory neural, and the second is nitric oxide mediated. However, the mechanism underlying the skin blood flow response to local heating are complex and poorly understood. The mechanisms behind these two phases are deduced to be linked by flow-mediated dilation. In this study, the variation of the blood flow and the blood vessel diameter are monitored during local heating. According to the dynamic blood flow, the theoretical model of flow mediated dilation involving the key agents production and transportation was first used to study vasodilatation process during heating, and the variations of blood vessel was obtained. Finally, accurate distributions of the nitric oxide, calcium and myosin concentrations in the arterial wall were found during autoregulation. We evaluated the time course of the blood vessel changing and verified the fact that the second increase in blood flow is the result of flow dilation mediation. The effects of dilation of blood vessel were also analyzed.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.022,84,NA,323-330,NA,Local heat; Blood flow; Flow mediated; Dilation
article,Thermal and cardiovascular responses and thermal sensation during hot-water bathing and the influence of room temperature,"Masuda, Yuta and Marui, Shuri and Kato, Issei and Fujiki, Mayuka and Nakada, Mariko and Nagashima, Kei",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The aim of the present study was to clarify physical risks during hot-water bathing by measuring thermal and cardiovascular responses and thermal sensation. Young men and women (n = 7 and 5, respectively) participated in the present study, which consisted of two trials mimicking bathing behavior at room temperature of 25 degrees C and 15 degrees C. Participants bathed in 41 degrees C water for 20 min to the subclavian level. Before bathing, participants rested fully clothed for 15 min and then rested for 15 min without clothes. After bathing, they rested without clothes for 15 min and afterwards rested fully clothed for another 15 min. Tympanic temperature (T-ty), heart rates (HR), mean skin temperature (T-sk), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and laser-Doppler flow at the chest and forehead (LDFhead and LDFchest) were evaluated. Thermal perception was assessed with a visual analogue scale. Mean T-sk in the 15 C trial decreased during the period without clothing while MAP increased. The value remained unchanged in the 25 C trial. During bathing, T-ty, mean T-sk, HR, LDFhead, and LDFchest increased in both trials, and MAP decreased to similar levels. Relative change in LDFchest was greater in the 15 degrees C trial than in the 25 degrees C trial. Participants felt cold when they were without clothes at 15 degrees C; however, the thermal perception during bathing was similar between the two trials. Greater changes in cardiovascular and thermal responses were observed during the bathing behavior. In addition, bathing in cold room augmented the changes, which may induce some physical risks during bathing.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.03.014,82,NA,83-89,NA,Heat stress; Cold stress; Skin blood flow; Skin temperature; Drowing

B.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"This paper presents a thermoregulation model based on the finite element method to perform numerical analyses of brain cooling procedures as a contribution to the investigation on the use of therapeutic hypothermia after ischemia in adults. The use of computational methods can aid clinicians to observe body temperature using different cooling methods without the need of invasive techniques, and can thus be a valuable tool to assist clinical trials simulating different cooling options that can be used for treatment. In this work, we developed a finite element method (FEM) package using isoparametric linear three-dimensional elements which is applied to the solution of the continuum bioheat Pennes equation. Blood temperature changes were considered using a blood pool approach and a lumped analysis for intravascular catheter methods of blood cooling. Some analyses are performed using a three-dimensional mesh based on a complex geometry obtained from computed tomography medical images, considering a cooling blanket and an intravascular catheter. A comparison is made between the results obtained with the two techniques and the effects of each case in brain temperature reduction in a required period of time, maintenance of body temperature at moderate hypothermia levels and gradual rewarming.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.08.019,78,NA,122-130,NA,Thermoregulation; Hypothermia; Brain cooling; Intravascular catheter; Finite element method

Dwayne and DuRant, Sarah E. and Carroll, J. Matthew",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Behavioral adjustments and parental decisions during reproduction can influence the thermal environment at nests, yet our understanding into how environmental factors (i.e., temperature and precipitation) constrain an adults ability to balance self-maintenance and incubation demands is limited. To expand our understanding of how species respond to environmental factors, we investigated the reproductive ecology of two ground-nesting species (northern bobwhite {[}Colinas virginianus] and scaled quail {[}Callipepla squamata]) in a region (i.e., the Southern Great Plains) prone to thermal variability (i.e., extreme hot and cold temperatures). Specifically, our objective was to examine how temperature and precipitation directly influenced behavioral adjustments (i.e., off-bout duration, frequency, and nest attentiveness) and parental decisions (i.e., nest site selection), and indirectly influenced nest fate. Overall, we found that parents chose to nest in sites that were significantly cooler in temperature than randomly selected sites, and parents further altered the thermal environment experienced by embryos through incubation behavior. Daily precipitation and average ambient temperature and/or their interaction best predicted incubation behaviors, yet each species differed in the timing (i.e., morning vs. evening), frequency, and duration of off-bouts. Furthermore, successful nests were associated with cooler nest site temperatures for bobwhite and warmer nest site temperatures for scaled quail. Our finding of relatively stable (35.5 degrees C) incubation temperature for developing embryos of both species suggests that ground-nesting birds are able to regulate microclimate through behavioral adjustments and parental decisions even under extreme temperature fluctuations. Nevertheless, the ability for a ground-nesting species to effectively modify behavioral adjustments and decisions may be altered during long periods of enhanced physiological and environmental stress.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.03.020,74,NA,140-148,NA,Behavioral adjustments; Colinus virginianus; Callipepla squamata; Incubation behavior; Precipitation; Thermal variability
article,<i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i> Say larva adapts to temperature shock through changes in protein turn over and amino acid catabolism,"Gayathri, R. V. Ayana and Evans, D. A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Exposure of Culex quinquefasciatus larvae to hypothermia or hyperthermia in relation to ecological temperature has resulted in alteration of enzyme activities related to maintenance of free amino acid pool and protein degradation. Sudden changes in water temperature have led to elevation of protein content particularly in molecular weight between 66 and 97.4 kDa. MALDI TOF analysis revealed the presence of putative uncharacterized protein and Phospholipase A2 activating protein in larvae subjected to 40 degrees C for 1 hour which was not found in control and other temperature treated larvae. These proteins may be playing a role in survival of larvae at higher temperatures. Thermal shock has resulted in channeling of free amino acids for protein synthesis and elevation of amino acid catabolism through increased deamination and altered transamination, which resulted in a sharp decrease in free amino acid pool. Inhibition of Leucine amino peptidase and elevation of Cathepsin D, under the influence of thermal shock may be an adaptive response of larvae to prevent unnecessary degradation of protein and at the same time facilitated rapid internal re-organization which may accelerate pupation. Elevated activity of Phenol oxidase and its co-stimulator Trypsin -like Serine protease, along with increased expression of Phospholipase A2 activating protein is a well co-ordinated defense mechanism leading to increased immune response in stressed state. This study assumes significance because variation in environmental conditions such as global warming and their impact on mosquito physiology can influence efficiency of disease vector.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.03.016,74,NA,149-159,NA,NA

There were differences between the models, considering the estimates of the parameters T-min, T-max, and T-opt. All of the tested models were able to describe non-linear responses involving the development rates of C. sanguinea at constant temperatures.

The more realistic T-opt estimated by the models varied from 29 degrees to 31 degrees C for egg, 27-28 degrees C for larvae and 28-29 degrees C for pupae. The Logan, Lactin and Analytis models estimated the T-max for egg, larvae and pupae to be approximately 34 degrees C, while the T-min estimated by the Analytis model was 16 degrees C for larvae and pupae.

Temperatures experienced during embryogenesis may also influence post-hatching growth rate, potentially through influencing post-hatching choice of temperatures. We investigated in laboratory settings whether embryonic temperatures (constant 18 degrees C, 21 degrees C and 22 degrees C) influence selected body temperatures (T-sel) of juvenile tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus), providing a possible mechanism for differences in growth rates. We found that incubation temperature does not influence T-sel. Although the average daily mean T-sel was 21.6 +/- 0.3 degrees C, we recorded individual T-sel values up to 33.5 degrees C in juvenile tuatara, which is higher than expected and above the panting threshold of 31-33 degrees C reported for adults. We found diel patterns of T-sel of juvenile tuatara, observing a general pattern of two apparent peaks and troughs per day, with T-sel being significantly lower around dawn and at 1500 h than any other time. When comparing our results with other studies on tuatara there is a remarkable consistency in mean T-sel of similar to 21 degrees C across tuatara of different ages, sizes and acclimatization histories. The ability of juvenile tuatara to withstand a wide range of temperatures supports their former widespread distribution throughout New Zealand and warrants further investigation into their plasticity to withstand climate warming, particularly where they have choices of habitat and the ability to thermoregulate.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.08.008,69,NA,261-266,NA,Body temperature; Circadian; Growth; Selected temperature; Thermoregulation

In most of the large migrating birds, the top of their wings is black. Considering this natural phenomenon in the migrating birds, such as albatross, a thermal analysis of the boundary layer of their wings is performed during the year depending on the solar insulation. It is shown that the temperature difference between the bright and dark colored top wing surface is around 10 degrees C. The dark color on the top of the wing increases the temperature of the boundary layer over the wing which consequently reduces the skin drag force over the wing. This reduction in the drag force can be considered as one of the effective factors for long endurance of these migrating birds.

article,Thermal equilibrium responses in Guzerat cattle raised under tropical conditions,"Camerro, Leandro Zuccherato and Campos Maia, Alex Sandro and Chiquitelli Neto, Marcos and de Melo Costa, Cintia Carol and Castro, Patric Andre",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The literature is very sparse regarding research on the thermal equilibrium in Guzerat cattle (Bos indicus) under field conditions. Some factors can modify the physiological response of Guzerat cattle, such as the reactivity of these animals to handling. Thus, the development of a methodology to condition and select Guzerat cattle to acclimate them to the routine collection of data without altering their physiological response was the objective of the preliminary experiment. Furthermore, the animals selected were used in the main experiment to determine their thermal equilibrium according to the thermal environment. For this proposal, the metabolic heat production and heat exchange between the animal and the environment were measured simultaneously in the field with an indirect calorimetry system coupled to a facial mask. The results of the preliminary experiment showed that the respiratory rate could demonstrate that conditioning efficiently reduced the reactivity of the animals to experimental handling. Furthermore, the respiratory rate can be used to select animals with less reactivity. The results of the main experiment demonstrate that the skin, hair-coat surface and expired air temperature depend on the air temperature, whereas the rectal temperature depends on the time of day; consequently, the sensible heat flow was substantially reduced from 70 to 20 when the air temperature increased from 24 to 34 degrees C. However, the respiratory latent heat flow increased from 10 to 15 W m(-2) with the same temperature increase. Furthermore, the metabolic heat production remained stable, independent of the variation of the air temperature; however, it was higher in males than in females (by approximately 25\%). This fact can be explained by the variation of the ventilation rate, which had a mean value of 1.6 and 2.2 L s(-1) for females and males, respectively. (V) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that an acute 1 h bout of hyperthermic treatment improves glucose, insulin, and leptin responses to an oral glucose challenge (OGTT) in obese type 2 diabetics and healthy humans. Nine obese (45 +/- 7.1\% fat mass) type 2 diabetics (T2DM: 50.1 +/- 12y, 7.5 +/- 1.8\% HbAlc) absent of insulin therapy and nine similar aged (41.1 +/- 13.7y) healthy non-obese controls (HC: 33.4 +/- 7.8\% fat mass, P < 0.01; 5.3 +/- 0.4\% HbA1c, P < 0.01) participated. Using a randomized design, subjects underwent either a whole body passive hyperthermia treatment via head-out hot water immersion (1 h resting in 39.4 +/- 0.4 degrees C water) that increased internal temperature above baseline by Delta 1.6 +/- 0.4 degrees C or a control resting condition. Twenty-four hours post treatments, a 75 g OGTT was administered to evaluate changes in plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and leptin concentrations. Hypeithermia itself did not alter area under the curve for plasma glucose, insulin, or C-peptide during the OGTT in either group.

article,The influence of thermal biology on road mortality risk in snakes,"Mccardle, Logan D. and Fontenot, Clifford L.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Road mortality is a significant threat to terrestrial vertebrates in many areas, and the novel thermal environment of black-topped roads may represent ecological traps for some species and demographic groups. We investigated the relationship between ambient temperature and on-road detection in a snake assemblage in southeastern Louisiana by comparing observations of live snakes on a black-topped road, across measurements of air temperature and road temperature on survey days. Analyses indicated on road detection of snakes was significantly influenced by ambient temperature conditions for five snake species. Additionally, road temperatures, and the difference between air and road temperatures, were strong drivers of on-road snake detections. Permutation analysis methods revealed that significant temperature related group (species or sex) structure exists in occurrences of snakes on the roadway, and that road temperature was the strongest driver of species differences. We also compared how air and road temperatures affected occurrence on the road between sexes in the colubrid snakes Nerodia fasciata, Nerodia cyclopion, Thamnophis proximus, and Pantherophis obsoletus. Males and females of the viviparous species N. fasciata, N. cyclopion, and T proximus diverged significantly in temperature preferences, with females found under warmer conditions, while males and females of the oviparous species P. obsoletus did not. Road temperature was also the strongest driver of differences between sexes. Our results indicate that black-topped roads are an ecological trap that is heavily influenced by sex, reproductive condition, and species specific thermoregulatory requirements, particularly for viviparous species.

Meta-analysis was employed to summarize, analyze, and compare the effects of various MCSs on human performance with corresponding physiological and psychological responses, thereby providing solid suggestions for selecting suitable MCSs for occupational workers. Wearing MCSs significantly attenuated the increases in core temperature (-0.34 degrees C/h) and sweating rate (-0.30 L/h), and significantly improved human performance (+29.9\%, effect size {[}EFS]=1.1) compared with no cooling condition (CON). Cold air-cooled garments (ACG-Cs; +106.2\%, EFS=232) exhibited greater effects on improving human performance among various microclimate cooling garments (MCGs), followed by liquid cooling garments (LCGs; +68.1\%, EFS=1.86) and hybrid cooling garment combining air and liquid cooling (HBCG-AL; +59.1\%, EFS=3.38), natural air-cooled garments (ACG-Ns; +39.9\%, EFS=1.12), and phase change material cooling garments (PCMCGs; +19.5\%, EFS=1.2). Performance improvement was observed to be positively and linearly correlated to the differences of core temperature increase rate (r=0.65, p<0.01) and sweating rate (r=0.80, p<0.001) between MCSs and CON. Considering their application in industrial settings, ACG-Cs, LCGs, and HBCG-AL are practical for work, in which workers do not move frequently, whereas ACG-Ns and PCMCGs are more applicable for the majority of occupational workers.

article,Effects of normobaric hypoxic bed rest on the thermal comfort zone,"Ciuha, Ursa and Eiken, Ola and Mekjavic, Igor B.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Future Lunar and Mars habitats will maintain a hypobaric hypoxic environment to minimise the risk of decompression sickness during the preparation for extra-vehicular activity. This study was part of a larger study investigating the separate and combined effects of inactivity associated with reduced gravity and hypoxia, on the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, neurohumoural, and thermoregulatory systems. Eleven healthy normothermic young male subjects participated in three trials conducted on separate occasions: (1) Normobaric hypoxic ambulatory confinement, (2) Normobaric hypoxic bedrest and (3) Normobaric normoxic bedrest Normobaric hypoxia was achieved by reduction of the oxygen fraction in the air (FiO2=0.141 +/- 0.004) within the facility, while the effects of reduced gravity were simulated by confining the subjects to a horizontal position in bed, with all daily routines performed in this position for 21 days. The present study investigated the effect of the interventions on behavioural temperature regulation. The characteristics of the thermal comfort zone (TCZ) were assessed by a water-perfused suit, with the subjects instructed to regulate the sinusoidally varying temperature of the suit within a range considered as thermally comfortable. Measurements were performed 5 days prior to the intervention (D-5), and on days 10 (D10) and 20 (D20) of the intervention. no statistically significant differences were found in any of the characteristics of the TCZ between the interventions (HAMB, HBR and NBR), or between different measurement days (D-5, D10, D20) within each intervention. rectal temperature remained stable, whereas skin temperature (T-sk) increased during all interventions throughout the one hour trial, no difference in T-sk between 0-5, D10 and D20, and between HAMB, HBR and NBR were revealed, subjects perceived the regulated temperature as thermally comfortable, and neutral or warm, we conclude that regulation of thermal comfort is not compromised by hypoxic inactivity.

article,High follicle density does not decrease sweat gland density in Huacaya alpacas,"Moore, K. E. and Maloney, S. K. and Blache, D.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"When exposed to high ambient temperatures, mammals lose heat evaporatively by either sweating from glands in the skin or by respiratory panting. Like other camelids, alpacas are thought to evaporate more water by sweating than panting, despite a thick fleece, unlike sheep which mostly pant in response to heat stress. Alpacas were brought to Australia to develop an alternative fibre industry to sheep wool. In Australia, alpacas can be exposed to ambient temperatures higher than in their native South America. As a young industry there is a great deal of variation in the quality and quantity of the fleece produced in the national flock. There is selection pressure towards animals with finer and denser fleeces. Because the fibre from secondary follicles is finer than that from primary follicles, selecting for finer fibres might alter the ratio of primary and secondary follicles. In turn the selection might alter sweat gland density because the sweat glands are associated with the primary follicle. Skin biopsy and fibre samples were obtained from the mid-section of 33 Huacaya alpacas and the skin sections were processed into horizontal sections at the sebaceous gland level. Total, primary, and secondary follicles and the number of sweat gland ducts were quantified. Fibre samples from each alpaca were further analysed for mean fibre diameter. The finer-fibred animals had a higher total follicle density (P <0.001) and more sweat glands (P <0.001) than the thicker-fibred animals. The fibre diameter and total follicle density were negatively correlated (R-2=0.56, P < 0.001). Given that the finer-fibred animals had higher follicle density and more sweat glands than animals with thicker fibres, we conclude that alpacas with high follicle density should not be limited for potential sweating ability.

article,"Immunolocalization of aquaporins 1, 3, and 5 in the nasal respiratory mucosa of a panting species, the sheep (<i>Ovis aries</i>)","Vesterdorf, Kristine and Blache, Dominique and Maloney, Shane K.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The nasal respiratory mucosa is the primary site for evaporative water loss in panting species, necessitating the movement of water across the nasal epithelium. Aquaporins (AQP) are protein channels that facilitate water movement in various fluid transporting tissues of non-panting species. Whether the requirement for enhanced capacity for transepithelial water movement in the nasal respiratory mucosa of panting species has led to differences in AQP localization is unknown. Using immunohistochemistry, we report the localization of AQP1, 3, and 5 in the nasal respiratory mucosa of sheep being exposed to ambient temperatures of similar to 21 degrees C or similar to 38 degrees C for 4.5 h before death (n=3/treatment). Exposure to either treatment resulted in panting. While exposure to similar to 38 degrees C resulted in a higher respiratory frequency (mean difference: 82 breaths min(-1); P < 0.001) than exposure to similar to 21 degrees C, there was no difference in the localization of AQPs. Connective tissue and vascular endothelial cells expressed AQP1. Glandular acini expressed AQP1 and apically localized AQP5, which was also present in glandular duct cells. Ciliated columnar epithelial cells expressed AQP5 apically and AQP3 basolaterally. Basal cells expressed AQP3. The distribution and colocalization of AQPs in the ovine nasal respiratory mucosa is different to that reported in non-panting species and may reflect the physiological demands associated with enhanced respiratory evaporation. We propose that AQP1, 3, and 5 may constitute a transepithelial water pathway via glandular secretions and across the surface epithelium, which provides a possible means for rapid and controllable water movement in the nasal respiratory mucosa of a panting species.

article,Estimation of tumor characteristics in a breast tissue with known skin surface temperature,"Das, Koushik and Mishra, Subhash C.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Presence of a tumor and its characteristics like location, size and properties are estimated. Estimation is based on the measurement of the skin surface temperature of the breast. Consideration is given to a 2-D breast tissue infected with a tumor. Heat transfer in the breast tissue modeled using the Pennes bioheat equation is solved by the finite volume method. Skin surface temperature profile of the breast is characteristic of the tumor location, its size and grade. In the inverse analysis, the objective function is minimized using the genetic algorithm. Exact estimation is obtained if one parameter is estimated at a time. However, the accuracies are acceptable even when blood perfusion rate, location and size are estimated simultaneously.

article,Thermal variability in body temperature in an ectotherm: Are cloacal temperatures good indicators of tortoise body temperature?,"McMaster, Megan K. and Downs, Colleen T.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Historically, studies of reptilian thermal biology have compared ambient temperatures (T-a) to body temperatures (T-b) from the animal under study, with T-b usually taken from the cloaca and various instruments being used to measure T-b. The advent of surgically implanted miniature temperature loggers has offered the opportunity to test the efficacy of cloacal T-b as a measurement in thermoregulatory studies. We expected that there was a difference between skin, cloacal, and core T-b's. Temperatures were measured from various positions on leopard tortoises (Stigmochelys pardalis) using thermocouples and miniature temperature loggers, including surgically implanted temperature loggers. Measurements of temperature from various positions on and in the tortoise were significantly different from T-a. Cloacal T-b's were significantly lower than all other body temperatures measured, and core T-b's were significantly different from cloacal T-b, skin and carapace temperatures. In addition, significant differences were found between measures of temperature from other parts of the body. The variations between core T-b, cloacal T-b and other measures of T-b indicated that there are large thermal gradients within the body of a relatively large tortoise at any given time with cloacal T-b not an accurate measure of core T-b.

article,Heat-retention effects of hydrogen-rich water bath assessed by thermography for humans,"Kato, Shinya and Takada, Yuki and Miwa, Nobuhiko",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Hydrogen-rich water bath devices are commercially available, but have been scarcely clarified for heat-retention effects. In this study, heat-retention effects of hydrogen-rich water bath were assessed by thermographic clinical trials, which employed twenty-four healthy subjects. The thermograms indicated that, under the same conditions (41 degrees C, 10-min bathing), hydrogen-rich water bath (hydrogen concentrations: 185-548 mu g/L; oxidation-reduction potentials: -167 to -91 mV, versus 0.8 mu g/L and +479 mV for normal bath, respectively) brought about the heat-retention being more marked than those of normal water bath for several body-parts in the order as follows: abdomen > upper legs > arms > hands > feet, for 30- and 60-min post-bathing, being in contrast to scarce heat-retention for head, armpits and lower legs. Then, as reflection to promotive effects on blood stream, we also examined the thickness of fingertip-capillary in hands. The thickness was expanded in the hydrogen-rich water bath more markedly than that in the normal water bath, suggesting that the hydrogen-rich water bath may have the hydrogen-based promotive effect, exceeding over mere heat retention-based effects, on blood circulation of the whole body. Meanwhile, the heat-retention in hydrogen-rich water bath weakly or moderately correlated with contents of the subcutaneous fat, whole body fat and body mass index, and inversely correlated with skeletal muscle rates, although their correlation degrees did not obviously exceed over normal water bath, with a poor relation with the basal metabolism rate. Thus, the hydrogen-rich water bath was suggested to exert heat-retention effects exceeding over normal water bath, in diverse body-parts such as abdomen, upper legs, arms and hands, via promotion to blood flow which was reflected by expanding the thickness of capillary. The heat-retention after bathing can be noted as effects of the hydrogen-rich water bath, which is applicable for most of people widespread regardless of their body composition index.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102805,95,NA,NA,102805,Hydrogen-rich water bath; Hydrogen water; Thermography; Capillary
article,Heat acclimation does not modify autonomic responses to core cooling and the skin thermal comfort zone,"Sotiridis, Alexandros and Ciuha, Ursa and Debevec, Tadej and Mekjavic, Igor B.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Exercise heat acclimation (HA) is known to magnify the sweating response by virtue of a lower threshold as well as increased gain and maximal capacity of sweating. However, HA has been shown to potentiate the shivering response in a cold-air environment. We investigated whether HA would alter heat loss and heat production responses during water immersion. Twelve healthy male participants underwent a 10-day HA protocol comprising daily 90-min controlled-hyperthermia (target rectal temperature, T-re 38.5 degrees C) exercise sessions. Preceding and following HA, the participants performed a maximal exercise test in thermoneutral conditions (ambient temperature 23 degrees C, relative humidity 50\%) and were, following exercise, immersed in 28 degrees C water for 60 min. Thermal comfort zone (TCZ) was also assessed with participants regulating the temperature of a water-perfused suit during heating and cooling. Baseline pre-immersion T-re was similar pre- and post-HA (pre: 38.33 +/- 0.33 degrees C vs post: 38.12 +/- 0.36 degrees C, p = 0.092). The T-re cooling rate was identical pre-to post-HA (-0.03 +/- 0.01 degrees C.min(-1), p = 0.31), as was the vasomotor response reflected in the forearm-fingertip temperature difference. Shivering thresholds (p = 0.43) and gains (p = 0.61) were not affected by HA. TCZ was established at similar temperatures, with the magnitude in regulated water temperature being 7.6 (16.3) degrees C pre-HA and 5.1 (24.7) degrees C post-HA (p = 0.65). The present findings suggest that heat production and heat loss responses during whole body cooling as well as the skin thermal comfort zone remained unaltered by a controlled-hyperthermia HA protocol.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102602,91,NA,NA,102602,Heat acclimation; Shivering response; Behavioral temperature regulation; Thermal comfort zone
article,Pigeons in the sun: Thermal constraints of eumelanic plumage in the rock pigeon (<i>Columba livia</i>),"Angelier, Frederic",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In wild vertebrates, several species exhibit eumelanic color polymorphism with the coexistence of dark and light morphs. The maintenance of such polymorphism suggests the existence of a selective balance between the morphs and a large body of literature has reported the costs and benefits of darker plumage coloration in birds. Among them, it has been suggested that melanin and dark plumage could entail high energetic costs especially under hot and sunny climates. However, to my knowledge, the thermal constraints of sun exposure have rarely been studied in polymorphic species. Here, we tested the impact of eumelanic plumage coloration on plumage and body temperatures, and evaporative cooling behavior in the polymorphic rock pigeon (Columbia livia). We experimentally exposed light and dark pigeons to direct sun radiation for 1 h while a few birds were maintained in the shade as controls. We found that sun exposure was associated with increased plumage temperature, and this effect was greater for darker pigeons. In addition, we found that sun exposure was also associated with higher cloacal temperature but for dark pigeons only. Finally, light and dark pigeons were more likely to show cooling evaporative behavior when exposed to sun and as their cloacal temperature increases. Altogether, these results suggest that darker pigeons may have a lower ability to cope with heat and solar radiations and that dark plumage can be associated with thermal costs in this polymorphic species.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102601,90,NA,NA,102601,Body temperature; Gular fluttering; Melanin; Polymorphism

Invasive species are assumed to have a greater ability to exploit the thermal environment, higher acclimation capacities, a wider thermal tolerance range, and better relative performance under a range of thermal conditions. Here we compare the thermal ecophysiology of two species that occur in sympatry in a tropical dry forest of the Pacific coast of Mexico, the microendemic species Benedetti's Leaf-toed Gecko (Phyllodactylus benedettii) and the invasive Common House Gecko (Hemidactylus frenatus). We characterized their patterns of thermoregulation, thermoregulatory efficiency, thermal tolerances, and thermal sensitivity of locomotor performance. In addition, we included morphological variables and an index of body condition to evaluate their effects on the thermal sensitivity of locomotor performance in these species. Although the two species had similar selected temperatures and thermal tolerances, they contrasted in their thermoregulatory strategies and thermal sensitivity of locomotor performance. Hemidactylus frenatus had a higher performance than the native species, P. benedettii, which would represent an ecological advantage for the former species. Nevertheless, we suggest that given the spatial and temporal limitations in habitat use of the two species, the probability of agonistic interactions between them is reduced. We recommend exploring additional biotic attributes, such as competition, behavior and niche overlap in order assess the role of alternative factors favoring the success of invasive species.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102607,90,NA,NA,102607,Body condition; Hemidactylus frenatus; Locomotor performance; Phyllodactylus benedettii; Thermal tolerances; Thermoregulation

With an increasing development of partial space regulation and task air conditioning systems and devices, thermal comfort demand concerning local thermal conditions has attracted more and more attention. In the present study, experiment was conducted and data mining technologies were performed to investigate correlations between local thermal conditions and whole body thermal comfort in sleeping state. The identification of local thermal condition included two steps: the first step was to clarify thermal sensation links between local and covered body, and the second step was to identify local thermal sensation inclination towards different thermal comfort levels. Thermal sensation correlations among local body parts and covered body were obtained. Back, face, and thigh were identified as three dominant linear-correlated local parts with weighting factors 0.488, 0.388, and 0.152, respectively; in addition, chest, arm, leg and foot were found as non-negligible local parts in the estimation of covered body thermal sensation. By dividing the sleeping human body into three parts as head, trunk and extremity, the proper local thermal sensations and their coupling relationships for whole body sleeping thermal comfort have been elaborated by three rules.

It was shown that 8-oxo-2'deoxyguanosine was not toxic at concentrations of up to 1 mu M. A tendency to accelerate larval development and fly emergence was observed under the influence of this compound in our experiments. Short-term heat shock causes a 50-80\% decrease in the number of larvae that complete development. The addition of exogenous 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine to the food before thermal influence negates this effect and brings the levels of the imago emergence indicators back to the basal level.

S.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The injection of repeated doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) results in attenuation of the immune response, which is an important mechanism to prevent deleterious long-term excessive inflammation. Brain-mediated mechanisms are involved in this endogenous anti-inflammatory effect, but nothing is known about the putative role of the splenic anti-inflammatory reflex (which has recently been described as a powerful mechanism involved in the suppression of immune response) during immune tolerance. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that endotoxin tolerance is at least in part mediated by the splenic anti-inflammatory reflex. Body core temperature (Tb) was measured in rats previously submitted to splenectomy. Immune tolerance was induced by means of five consecutive LPS (100 mu g/kg) intraperitoneal injections at 24-h intervals. In sham operated rats, we observed a significant reduction of the febrile response to repeated administration of LPS, which was not altered in rats submitted to splenectomy. Moreover, plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines {[}tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1 beta and IL-6] and prostaglanding E-2 (PGE(2)) surges besides preoptic PGE(2) levels were observed after the first LPS administration but not in tolerant animals, and this pattern was kept the same in splenectomized rats. These data are consistent with the notion that the splenic anti-inflammatory reflex does not modulate immune tolerance in rats.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102411,85,NA,NA,102411,Endotoxin; LPS; Fever; Cytokines; PGE(2)
article,Generalized solution and estimation method for cooling performance of downscaled cryoprobe,"Okajima, Junnosuke",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In cryosurgery, downscaling of cryoprobes is important to minimize surgical invasion. In this study, a set of analytical solutions to the freezing phenomenon around a cryoprobe in a dimensionless form is derived and the general trend is discussed to clarify the relationship between the freezing ability of a biological tissue and the cooling power of a cryoprobe. A one-dimensional axisymmetric model in the steady-state condition is considered. The relationship between the size of the frozen region, fluid temperature in the cryoprobe, and heat transfer coefficient on the wall of the cryoprobe in the dimensional form is derived under the condition mentioned above. The fluid temperature and heat transfer coefficient are eliminated from the solutions by introducing the steady-state cryoprobe surface temperature. This transformation indicates that the steady-state surface temperature directly affects the size of the frozen region and combination of fluid temperature and heat transfer coefficient occurs, which has the same cooling effect. The derived solutions are transformed into a dimensionless form using the characteristic length of bioheat transfer and normalizing the temperature distribution in an unfrozen tissue. The applicability of these analytical solutions is evaluated by comparing them with numerical simulation results from existing studies. The dimensionless solutions describe the general trend of the relationship between the frozen region and the cooling power of a cryoprobe, which is independent of the type of organ, fluid temperature, and heat transfer coefficient. Finally, the concept of freezing limit is established using the derived solutions. The freezing limit describes the minimum requirements to freeze a tissue, and it can be used as guideline to design future downscaled cryoprobes with a suitable cooling mechanism.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.04.010,82,NA,213-221,NA,Cryosurgery; Cryoprobe; Dimensionless solution; Biot number; Dimensionless temperature
article,A new local index for predicting local thermal response of individual body segments,"Khiavi, Negin Moallemi and Maerefat, Mehdi and Zolfaghari, Seyed Alireza",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Physiologically, the thermal sensation/perception of human body is related to the response of cutaneous thermoreceptors (TRs) to the environment. However, the thermal response of skin warm and cold TRs is a function of two important factors: TRs temperatures and their time derivative at the subcutaneous locations of TRs. The available thermal models based on TRs response consider the same sensitivity for all thermal receptors of body. Thus, they estimate an average value of thermal response for whole body TRs. Therefore, considering the physiological thermal perception of humans, this study has presented a local thermal response index for estimating local sensation of different body segments based on local thermal response of individual TRs. Further, this index has used the ASHRAE thermal sensation scales to express the TRs thermal responses. Also, the new multi-segmental thermoregulatory bioheat model (MSTB) is utilized to calculate the individual TRs temperature. Finally, the predicted local thermal sensation by the new local index has been compared with published measured data under uniform/non-uniform thermal conditions. The results show that the local thermal sensation of individual body parts could be evaluated by the new local predictive index (LTRESP) with reasonable accuracy under various thermal conditions.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.09.002,78,NA,161-173,NA,Local thermal index; Thermal response; Cutaneous thermoreceptors; Non-uniform environment
article,Screening of cold tolerance in fifteen springtail species,"Holmstrup, Martin",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Springtails (Collembola) are ubiquitous and help ecosystem processes such as the decomposition of dead plant material. Their ability to survive low winter temperatures is an important trait that partly defines their geographic distribution. The cold tolerances of 15 laboratory-reared species of springtails were investigated. Springtails were cold acclimated in the laboratory over two months in order to simulate a seasonal change in temperature during autumn. Springtails were then exposed to decreasing sub-zero temperatures and at the same time simulating the moisture conditions in frozen soil. The cold tolerance of the species reflected well the climate of region of origin. Differential scanning calorimetry of individual springtails showed that melting points of body fluids did not become lower due to long-term cold acclimation (from 20 degrees to 1.5 degrees C). However, both water content and melting point of two arctic species (Hypogastrura viatica and Protaphorura macfadyeni) decreased drastically during exposure to sub-zero temperatures indicating cryoprotective dehydration (CPD). These arctic species survived exposure to - 9 degrees C for two weeks and - 20 degrees C for at least one week using CPD. Four other subarctic or cool temperate species also used CPD and survived - 9 degrees C for weeks, whereas springtails in culture from less cool temperate regions had poor cold tolerance.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.07.017,77,NA,1-6,NA,Chill-susceptible; Collembola; Cryoprotective dehydration; Overwintering; Supercooling
article,Effect of feed intake level on the body temperature of pigs exposed to heat stress conditions,"Cervantes, M. and Antoine, D. and Valle, J. A. and Vasquez, N. and Camacho, R. L. and Bernal, H. and Morales, A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Feed intake (FI) level affects body heat production in thermo-neutral pigs; exposure of pigs to heat stress (HS) also increases body temperature (BT). However remains unclear whether the Fl level affects the heat production of HS pigs. This study analyzed the effect of FI level on BT of 9 HS pigs (46.3 +/- 2.6 kg body weight) implanted with a thermometer set to register the BT at 5-min intervals into the ileum. Pigs were divided in two groups randomly allotted to two FI treatments: high Fl (HFI, 1.20 kg/d), and low FI (LFI, 0.96 kg/d), according to a two period crossover experimental design. Pigs were fed 3-times a day (0600, 1200, and 2200 h), same amount each time (400 g or 320 g). Ambient temperature (AT) ranged from 29.0 to 35.4 degrees C. The BT of both HFI and LFI pigs followed a similar pattern along a 24-h period, but the BT of HFI pigs was higher than that of LFI pigs (P < 0.05). Postprandial afternoon and evening BT was higher than that after the morning meal (P < 0.05). The postprandial BT increment differed between meal times and AT, but not between FI levels. The BT of HFI and LFI pigs increased up to 0.18 and 0.22 degrees C, 0.60 and 0.61 degrees C, and 0.24 and 0.35 degrees C after the morning, afternoon, and evening meal, respectively, compared with the preprandial BT (P < 0.05). Hence, the dissipation capacity of feeding-related body heat appears to depend on the thermal load of HS pigs before consuming their meals; presumably, the thermal load during 6-h before the morning meal (AT below 32 degrees C) was lower than before the evening meal (AT above 32 degrees C). In conclusion, FI level affects the postprandial BT of HS pigs and its magnitude is larger after the evening and afternoon meals. These data suggest that HS pigs may reduce the voluntary Fl during the afternoon and evening hours.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.06.010,76,NA,1-7,NA,Pigs; Heat stress; Feed intake; Body temperature

Methods: Eleven endurance trained male athletes completed four experimental sessions including a 30-min fixed-RPE (15-Hard) cycling exercise in neutral (TMP-22 degrees C) and hot (HOT-37 degrees C) conditions, following a 60-min incongruent Stroop task (EXP) or passively watching documentary films (CON). Central and peripheral performances of the knee extensors were assessed before the cognitive task and after the exercise. Results: Although mental demand and effort were higher in EXP (P < 0.05), no effect of prior cognitive task was observed on subjective feelings of mental fatigue or decline in power output at a fixed RPE. Average exercise intensity was lower in HOT than TMP (3.14 +/- 0.09 W.kg vs. 3.42 +/- 0.10 W.kg(-1) respectively, P < 0.05). Skin temperature and warmth sensations were higher in HOT throughout the exercise (P < 0.05) but not thermal comfort. Central and peripheral parameters were not affected more in HOT than in TMP. Conclusion: Although the effects of combined stressors on the distortion of perceived exertion could not be verified, the greater decline in power output recorded in HOT than TMP suggest a high contribution of both perceptual and cardiovascular responses in the regulation of work rate when the subject is in mild hyperthermia.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.07.006,76,NA,68-76,NA,Mental fatigue; Self-paced exercise; Perceived exertion; Heat strain; Training level

The aim of this work is to determine whether the SCENARIO thermoregulatory model can be adapted to estimate metabolic rate (M) from core body temperature (T-c). To validate this method of M estimation, data were collected from fifteen test volunteers (age = 23 +/- 3 yr, height = 1.73 +/- 0.07 m, mass = 68.6 +/- 8.7 kg, body fat = 16.7 +/- 7.3\%; mean +/- SD) who wore long sleeved nylon jackets and pants (I-tot,I-clo = 1.22, I-m = 0.41) during treadmill exercise tasks (32 trials; 7.8 +/- 0.5 km in 1 h; air temp. = 22 degrees C, 50\% RH, wind speed = 0.35 ms(-1)). Core body temperatures were recorded by ingested thermometer pill and M data were measured via whole room indirect calorimetry. Metabolic rate was estimated for 5 min epochs in a two-step process. First, for a given epoch, a range of M values were input to the SCENARIO model and a corresponding range of Tc values were output. Second, the output Tc range value with the lowest absolute error relative to the observed Tc for the given epoch was identified and its corresponding M range input was selected as the estimated M for that epoch. This process was then repeated for each subsequent remaining epoch. Root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and bias between observed and estimated M were 186 W, 130 +/- 174 W, and 33 +/- 183 W, respectively. The RMSE for total energy expenditure by exercise period was 0.30 MJ. These results indicate that the SCENARIO model is useful for estimating M from T-c when measurement is otherwise impractical.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.12.007,72,NA,44-52,NA,Energy expenditure; Metabolic rate; Core body temperature; Thermoregulation; Physiological status monitoring; Biophysical modeling
article,A simulated heat wave shortens the telomere length and lifespan of a desert lizard,"Zhang, Qiong and Han, Xingzhi and Hao, Xin and Ma, Liang and Li, Shuran and Wang, Yang and Du, Weiguo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Understanding how organisms respond to warming contributes important information to the conservation of biodiversity that is threatened by climate warming. Here, we conducted experiments on a desert agama (Phrynocephalus przewalskii) to test the hypothesis that climate warming (an increase in both mean temperature and heat waves) would induce oxidative stress, shortening telomere length, and thereby decreasing survival. Our results demonstrated that one week of exposure to a simulated heat wave significantly shortened telomere length, and decreased the overwinter survival of lizards, but mean temperature increase did not affect the survival of lizards. However, the antioxidant capacity (anti-oxidative enzyme) was not affected by the warming treatments. Therefore, heat waves might have negative impacts on the desert agama, with shortened telomeres likely causing the lifespan of lizards to decrease under climate warming.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.01.004,72,NA,94-100,NA,Fitness; Global climate change; Heat stress; Oxidative stress; Reptile
article,Do female reproductive stage and phenotype influence thermal requirements in an oviparous lizard?,"Lopez Juri, Guadalupe and Chiaraviglio, Margarita and Cardozo, Gabriela",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Reproduction is an energetically costly activity that can alter thermal requirements in Squamata. This phenomenon has been largely studied in many viviparous species; however, little is known about the role of oviparous females in controlling temperature during vitellogenesis and embryo development before oviposition. Diversity of female phenotypes could be associated with diversity of thermoregulatory performance, since thermal requirements are frequently influenced by body shape. Furthermore, studying the thermoregulatory behaviour is fundamental to understand how females regulate their body temperature. Here, we aimed to determine whether reproduction alters thermal requirements in an oviparous model, Tropidorus spinulosus, and if the preferred body temperature and thermoregulatory behaviour vary among reproductive stages and in relation to the female phenotype. We characterized the female phenotypes according to multiple morphological traits (snout-vent length, inter-axillar length, abdominal perimeter, body condition and head width). Reproductive structures were diagnosed by portable ultrasound scanning. To determine body temperatures, the lizards were placed in an open-top terrarium, where a thermal gradient ranging from 18 to 50 degrees C was set up; we also recorded the permanence of individuals in cold, temperate and warm zones during each experiment. Reproductive females preferred higher temperatures and presented lower amplitude in thermal variability than non-reproductive females. Moreover, within reproductive females, females with wide abdominal perimeter and high body condition showed thermal stability. Females with oviductal eggs tended to select higher temperature and also show more thermal stability than females with vitellogenic follicles. The latter females used the temperate zone most frequently and to a lesser degree the warm one, whereas females with oviductal eggs used the temperate and warm zones with similarly high frequency. We conclude that reproductive stage and phenotypic traits influence the selection of preferred body temperatures and thermoregulatory behaviour in T. spinulosus females.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.11.013,71,NA,202-208,NA,Thermal requirements; Thermoregulatory behaviour; Reproductive stage; Female body shape

We derive the heat balance model in the same form as the WBGT for a human engaged in moderate intensity work with a metabolic heat production of 174 W/m(2) while wearing typical vapor-permeable clothing under shady and sunny conditions. Two important relationships are revealed based on this derivation: (1) the natural wet bulb and black globe temperature coefficients in the WBGT coincide with the heat balance equation for a human body with a fixed skin wettedness of approximately 0.45 at a fixed skin temperature; and (2) the WBGT can be interpreted as the environmental potential to increase skin temperature rather than the heat storage rate of a human body. We propose an adjustment factor calculation method that supports the application of WBGT for humans dressed in various clothing types and working under various air velocity conditions. Concurrently, we note difficulties in adjusting the WBGT by using a single factor for humans wearing vapor-impermeable protective clothing. The WBGT for shady conditions does not need adjustment depending on the positive radiant field (i.e., when a radiant heat source exists), whereas that for the sunny condition requires adjustments because it underestimates heat stress, which may result in insufficient human protection measures.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.10.002,71,NA,1-9,NA,Heat stress; Clothing; Thermal environment; Solar radiation; Wet bulb globe temperature; Adjustment factor
article,An automated approach to enhance the thermographic evaluation on orofacial regions in lateral facial thermograms,"Singh, Jaspreet and Arora, Ajat Shatru",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Segmentation of characteristic facial regions has often been an initial step of thermographic analysis in face recognition and clinical diagnosis. Moreover, fast and accurate thermographic analysis on characteristic areas is highly reliant on segmentation approach. Usually, frontal and lateral projections are used to capture the facial thermograms. The significant role of lateral facial thermography to diagnose the various problems associated with orofacial regions has been remarkable in many studies. So far, no study has presented an automatic approach for the segmentation of characteristic areas in lateral facial thermograms. For this purpose, an automatic approach to segment the characteristic areas in lateral facial thermograms is proposed. The dataset of 140 facial thermograms with 1 left and 1 right lateral view per subject is created. Initially, image binarization is performed using optimal temperature thresholding for better visualization of facial geometry. Then, the automatic localization of characteristic points is performed at two levels, based on (a) geometrical features of the face, and (b) local thermal patterns. At last, the characteristic points and auxiliary points are used to segment the characteristic areas in the orofacial region of the face. To evaluate the segmentation performance of the proposed methodology, the automatically localized characteristic points are compared with manually marked using Euclidean distance based comparison criterion. With the localization error delta(ch-pt)<= 0.05, the proposed automatic approach shows 92.04\% of overall localization accuracy and 85\% of overall segmentation accuracy. The key conclusion is that the proposed algorithm can potentially automate the process of thermographic analysis on characteristic areas to assist the diagnosis of problems in the orofacial region.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.11.001,71,NA,91-98,NA,Facial thermography; Optimal temperature thresholding; Automatic segmentation in lateral face; Mandible; Temporomandibular joint; Maxillary sinus

In controlled field experiments, we quantified heating by thermal absorption of light and airflow-induced heat loss in the white garden snail, Theba pisana, from Normandy, France. Heating experiments revealed a significant positive relation of the internal body temperature with illumination period, shell temperature and air temperature at different times of day. The size of the snails was negatively related with both of the given illumination times: smaller animals heated up stronger than larger ones. The temperature at the surface of the shell significantly depended on the illumination period and the time of day. An AIC-based quality assessment of multiple linear modelling showed that, for explaining both shell surface and internal temperature of the soft body, several factors, i.e., exposure time, daytime, shell size and colouration contributed to the best models, respectively. Similarly, heat loss of the soft body after and during exposure of the snails to sunlight by a constant airflow depended on the initial body temperature, shell size, colouration and ambient air temperature. Our study revealed also the importance of both shell size and colouration for the loss of body temperature under natural conditions: small and banded animals that had heated up to temperatures above 30 degrees C cooled down faster than large and un-banded ones.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.06.001,69,NA,54-63,NA,Environmental stress; Radiation; Land snails; Polymorphism; Warming

article,Recover of peripheral nerve function after prolong hypothermic cardiac arrest in a porcine model with extra corporeal life support,"Kjaergaard, Benedict and Sevcencu, Cristian and Magnusdottir, Sigridur Olga and Krarup, Henrik Bygum and Nielsen, Thomas Norgaard",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Objectives: Surviving long lasting cardiac arrest following accidental hypothermia has been reported after treatment with extra corporeal life support (ECLS), but there is a risk of neurologic injury. Most surviving hypothermia patients have a prolonged stay in the intensive care unit, where most patients experience polyneuropathy. Theoretically, accidental hypothermic cardiac arrest may in itself contribute to polyneuropathy. This study was designed to examine the impact of three hours of cardiac arrest at a core temperature of 20 degrees C followed by reanimation of peripheral nerve function. Methods: Seven pigs were cannulated for ECLS and cooled to a core temperature of 20 degrees C followed by three hours of circulatory arrest where the extremities were packed with ice. After three hours, ECLS was started and rewarming was performed. During the process, neural testing of the ulnar nerve (a somatic nerve) and of the vagus nerve (an autonomic nerve) were performed and blood was drawn for analysis of p-potassium, serum neuron -specific enolase, and S100b protein. Results: The ulnar nerve was cooled from 34.9 1.6C to 12.8 +/- 3.8 degrees C and the vagus nerve from 36.2 +/- 1.2 degrees C to 15.4 +/- 1.4 degrees C. Physiologic function of both somatic and autonomic nerves were strongly affected by cooling, but recovered to almost normal levels during rewarming, even after three hotirs of hypothermic cardiac arrest. P-potassium rose from 3.9 (3.6-4.6) mmo1/1 to 8.1 (7.2-9.1) mmo1/1 after three hours of cardiac arrest, but normalized after recirculation. There was no rise in serum-neuron -specific enolase, but a slight rise in S100b protein during three hours of hypothermic cardiac arrest was observed. All pigs obtained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Conclusions: Reanimation after three hours of hypothermic cardiac arrest using ECLS was possible with no or, if present, minor damage to the two nerves tested.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.12.009,64,NA,41-47,NA,Nerve function; Accidental hypothermia; Extra corporeal life support

By considering the thermometer's height, radius, conductivity, density and specific heat as variables affecting the accuracy of DHFM measurement, we investigated the relationship between those variables and accuracy using 3-D models based on finite element method. The results of our simulation study show that accuracy is proportional to the radius but inversely proportional to the thickness of the thermometer when the radius is less than 30.0 mm, and is also inversely proportional to the heat conductivity of the heat insulator inside the thermometer. The insights from this study would help to build a guideline for design, fabrication and optimization of DHFM-based thermometers, as well as their practical use. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This study is. to our knowledge, the first report on the effects of temperature, density and protein level in food on the rearing of the North African green Frog Pelophylax saharicus. Results show that a temperature of 26 degrees C is optimal for maximum weight gain. The maximum metamorphosis rate is obtained between 24 and 26 degrees C. The highest yields occur at low densities from 1 to 10 tadpoles l(-1). The best survival rate and accelerated metamorphosis are obtained at a level of 35\% protein in food whose impact on food intake and weight gain is low. The maximum weight attained by tadpoles at metamorphosis, however, is obtained with a level of 40\% protein.

Nine athletes performed six tests while running on a treadmill in a climatic chamber at different ambient temperatures: 20, 30, 3, -4, -9 and -14 degrees C and a wind speed of 5 m s(-1). The exercise protocol consisted of a 10-min warm-up, followed by four 5-min intervals at increasing intensities at 76\%, 81\%, 85\%, and 89\% of maximal oxygen consumption. This was followed by an incremental test to exhaustion. Although peak heart rate, body mass loss, and blood lactate concentration after the incremental test to exhaustion increased as the ambient temperature rose, no changes in time to exhaustion, running economy, running speed at lactate threshold or maximal oxygen consumption were found between the different ambient temperature conditions. Endurance performance during one hour of incremental exercise was not affected by ambient temperature in female endurance athletes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

article,"Energy budget, oxidative stress and antioxidant in striped hamster acclimated to moderate cold and warm temperatures","Chen, Ke-Xin and Wang, Chun-Ming and Wang, Gui-Ying and Zhao, Zhi-Jun",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The mechanism of the rate of living-free radical theory suggests that higher rate of oxidative metabolism results from greater rate of mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation, leading to a consequent increase in production of free radicals. However, the relation between metabolic rate and oxidative stress is tissue dependent in animals acclimated to cold temperatures. Here we examined oxidative stress, reflected by changes of antioxidant activity and other related markers, in striped hamsters acclimated to moderate cold (15 degrees C), room (23 degrees C) or warm temperature (30 degrees C) for 6 weeks, by which either higher or lower metabolic rate was induced experimentally. Energy intake and the rate of metabolism and nonshivering thermogenesis were increased at 15 degrees C, but decreased at 30 degrees C compared with that at 23 degrees C. Effects of temperatures on the markers of both oxidative stress and antioxidant activities were rarely significant. The percentages of positive correlation between the 11 tissues (brain, BAT, liver, heart, lung, kidneys, stomach, small and large intestine, caecum and skeletal muscle) were 14.5\% (8/55) for catalase (CAT), 7.3\% (4/55) for the capacity of inhibition of hydroxyl free radical (CIH), 5.5\% (3/55) for activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), 1.8\% (1/55) for total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), 4.3\% (2/46) for H2O2 and 11.1\% (4/36) for the capacity of inhibition of hydroxyl free radical (CIH). This indicated that the tissue-dependent changes of both oxidative stress and antioxidant activity were less consistent among the different tissues. Finally the data from this study were less consistent with the prediction of the mechanism of the rate of living-free radical theory. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

article,"Breaking the temperature-size rule: Thermal effects on growth, development and fecundity of a crustacean from temporary waters","Aguilar-Alberola, Josep A. and Mesquita-Joanes, Francesc",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The temperature-size rule (TSR) is a well-established phenomenon to describe the growth response of ectotherms to temperature by which individuals maintained at low temperatures grow more slowly, but attain a larger size upon maturity. Although there are adaptive and non-adaptive theories about the plasticity of body size in response to temperature, these cannot be applied to all ectotherms, and little is known about the changes in growth and development rates through ontogeny. The ostracod species Heterocypris bosniaca, an inhabitant of freshwater temporary ponds, was used to examine the growth and development rates of its nine growth stages and female fecundity at four different temperatures (15 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C). The development rate of this species accelerates with increasing temperature, reaching a maximum value at 25 degrees C. The growth factor has a reverse-TSR in younger instars, and the typical TSR is followed only in the last two moults, resulting in non-monotonic response of adult size to temperature. Fecundity (total offspring per female) was not directly related to adult size and was generally higher at lower temperatures. Our results agree with recent research showing that the TSR may vary during ontogeny, and may not be a general trend in ostracod species from temporary waters. Indeed, adult carapace size seems to follow the pattern of a thermal reaction norm, probably influenced by the reduction of oxygen bioavailability at low temperature and the drastic increase in metabolic demand at the upper extreme of the thermal gradient.

We here investigate the effects of different frequencies and magnitudes of temperature change in the tropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana, considering developmental (Experiment 1) and adult stage plasticity (Experiment 2). We predicted negative effects of more frequent temperature changes on development, immune function and/or reproduction. Results from Experiment 1 showed that repeated temperature changes during development, if involving large amplitudes, negatively affect larval time, larval growth rate and pupal mass, while adult traits remained unaffected. However, results from treatment groups with smaller temperature amplitudes yielded no clear patterns. In Experiment 2 prolonged but not repeated exposure to 39 degrees C increased heat tolerance, potentially reflecting costs of repeatedly activating emergency responses. At the same time fecundity was more strongly reduced in the group with prolonged heat stress, suggesting a trade-off between heat tolerance and reproduction. Clear effects were restricted to conditions involving large temperature amplitudes or high temperatures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, low bioavailability of Artemisia annua L. limits its therapeutic potential, fermentation of Artemisia annua L. can improve its bioavailability. This study was aimed to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation of enzymatically-treated Artemisia annua L. (EA) on reproductive performance, antioxidant status, milk composition of heat-stressed sows and intestinal barrier integrity of their preweaning offspring. 135 multiparous sows of average parity 4.65 (Landrace x large white) at day 85 of pregnancy were randomly distributed into 3 treatments. Sows in the control group were housed at control rooms (temperature: 27.12 +/- 0.18 degrees C, temperature-humidity index (THI): 70.90 +/- 0.80) and fed the basal diet. Sows in the HS, HS + EA groups were fed the basal diet supplemented with 0 or 1.0 g/kg EA respectively, and reared at heat stress rooms (temperature: 30.11 +/- 0.16 degrees C, THI: 72.70 +/- 0.60). Heat stress increased the malondialdehyde (MDA) content, reduced the activities of total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and total superoxide dismutase (T SOD) of sows and piglets, and seriously compromised the antioxidant capacity of the sows and the intestinal integrity of their offspring. However, dietary supplementation of 1.0 g/kg EA reduced the MDA content, increased the activities of T-SOD and T-AOC in serum, colostrum, and milk of heat-stressed sows, and increased colostrum yield and 14-d milk fat content. EA supplementation also increased piglet weaning weight and the activities of T-SOD and T-AOC in serum. In addition, the abundances of intestinal tight junction proteins claudin1 and occludin were up-regulated in piglets in EA-supplemented group. In conclusion, dietary EA supplementation at 1.0 g/kg can alleviate the oxidative stress in heat-stressed sows, improve the antioxidant capacity in both sows and their offspring, and promote the intestinal barrier integrity in their offspring. EA may be a potent dietary supplement that ameliorates oxidative stress in livestock production by improving the antioxidant capacity.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102751,94,NA,NA,102751,Artemisia annua L; Heat stress; Reproductive performance; Oxidative injury; Gene expression

An induced-hyperthermia technique is used to evaluate the extremities of metabolic heat generation and other dependent parameters. Moreover, a case study is also presented to calculate the parameters of prime importance i.e. exergy consumption (EC) and entropy generation rate (delta S-g) to provide the body's accumulative and exhaustive thermal energy maxima, respectively.

The resulting states have been analysed to setup critical ranges to provide the guidelines for rehabilitation therapy. A thermal manikin has also been developed, mimicking the blood circulation in humans, to further substantiate the use of an exergy-based approach.

Sixteen participants were recruited and divided to three groups based on injury level; high-thoracic T1-T3, mid-thoracic T4-T8, and low thoracic T9-T12 to perform a 30-min arm-crank exercise at a 30 degrees C room condition. Two types of PCM vests at melting temperature of 20 degrees C were tested: i) V1 with PCM covering the trunk of 3.4 kg overall vest mass and ii) V2 with PCM covering chest and upper back of 2.17 kg overall vest mass. High thoracic and low-thoracic groups performed NV and V1 tests; whereas, mid-thoracic group performed NV, V1, and V2 tests. Heart rate, core, and skin temperatures were monitored during 15-min preconditioning, 30-min exercise, and 15-min recovery. In addition, thermal comfort, sensation, skin wettedness, and perceived exertion were recorded during exercise only. The main findings were that the effectiveness of the cooling vest was dependent on injury level and portion of sensate skin of trunk covered by the PCM packets. Rise in core temperature (Delta T-cr) was reduced significantly for the low-thoracic group during exercise and recovery (Delta T-cr = 0.41 degrees C, 0.26 degrees C for NV and V1; respectively, p<0.05).

article,Timing alters how a heat shock affects a host-parasitoid interaction,"Valls, Aleix and Kral-O'Brien, Katherine and Kopco, James and Harmon, Jason P.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Abiotic factors' effects on species are now well-studied, yet they are still often difficult to predict, especially for strongly interacting species. If these altered abiotic factors and species interactions occur as discrete events in time, such complications may occur because of the events' relative timing. One such discrete abiotic factor is the short-duration, large magnitude increase in temperature called a heat shock. This study investigates how the timing of heat shocks affects the successful attack and reproduction of a parasitoid wasp (Aphidius ervi) attacking its host, the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum). We tested three relative timings: 1) heat shock before the wasp attacks hosts, 2) heat shock while the wasp is foraging, and 3) heat shock after the wasp has attacked hosts. In each scenario we compared wasp mummy production (pupal stage) with and without a heat shock. Our results showed that a heat shock had the largest effect when it occurred while wasps actively foraged, with fewer mummies produced when exposed to a heat shock compared to the no heat shock control. Follow-up behavioral tests suggest this was caused by wasps becoming inactive during heat shocks. In contrast, when heat shocks were applied three days before or after foraging, we found no difference in mummy production between the heat shock treatment and no heat shock control. These results show the potential importance of timing when considering the ramifications of an altered abiotic factor, especially with relatively discrete abiotic events and interactions.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102596,90,NA,NA,102596,Acyrthosiphon pisum; Aphidius ervi; Extreme heat; Fecundity; Parasitoid wasp

We investigated whether mild whole-body cold stress would affect isometric force control during submaximal hand grip and key pinch tasks. Twelve male participants performed isometric hand grip and key pinch tasks at 10\% and 30\% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) for 30 and 10 s respectively, in cold (8 degrees C) and control (25 degrees C) conditions. Finger temperature decreased significantly by 18.7 +/- 2.1 degrees C and continuous low-intensity shivering in the upper trunk increased significantly in intensity and duration during cold exposure. Rectal temperature decreased similarly for the 8 degrees C and 25 degrees C exposures. Force variability (FCv) was <2\% for the hand grip tasks, and <3\% for the key pinch tasks. No significant changes in FCv or force accuracy were found between the ambient temperatures. In conclusion, isometric force control during hand grip and key pinch tasks was maintained when participants experienced mild whole-body cold stress compared with when they were thermally comfortable.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102537,89,NA,NA,102537,Force variability; Force accuracy; Continuous low-intensity shivering; Electromyography

Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation have been reported to contribute to the phenotypic plasticity observed in vertebrates in response to environmental changes. Additionally, DNA methylation is a dynamic process that occurs throughout vertebrate ontogeny and it has been associated with the activation and silencing of gene expression during post-embryonic development and metamorphosis. In this study, we investigated genome-wide DNA methylation profiles during turbot metamorphosis, as well as the epigenetic effects of temperature on turbot post-embryonic development. Fish growth and rates of development were greatly affected by rearing temperature. Thus, turbot raised at ambient temperature (18 degrees C) achieved greater body weights and progressed through development more quickly than those reared at a colder temperature (14 degrees C). Genome-wide DNA methylation dynamics analyzed via a methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) technique were not significantly different between animals reared within the two different thermal environments. Furthermore, comparisons between phenotypically similar fish revealed that genome-wide DNA methylation profiles do not necessarily correlate with specific developmental stages in turbot.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102483,88,NA,NA,102483,Turbot; DNA methylation; Temperature; Metamorphosis; MSAP analysis

At 28 days of age, sixty broilers were randomly divided into the control group (25 +/- 2 degrees C; 24 h/day) and the heat stress group (36 +/- 2 degrees C; 8 h/day lasted for 1 week or 2 weeks). Fifteen broilers per group were respectively euthanized, and some samples were respectively collected from the control and the heat stress groups at the end of the 1st week or the 2nd week of heat stress. A typical heat stress response has been observed at this temperature. Compared with the control group, the birds subjected to heat stress at the end of the 1st week reduced (P < 0.05) body weight (BW), average daily feed intake (ADFI), average daily gain (ADG), the activity of serum antioxidant enzyme and content of glutathione (GSH), while increased (P < 0.05) feed conversion ratio (FCR), serum corticosterone and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. However, when the heat stress lasted for the end of the 2nd week, there was no significant difference (P > 0.05) in ADFI, ADG, FCR and serum contents of corticosterone, MDA and GSH. Regardless of duration of thermal stress, the localization of ABCG2 protein had no change. Moreover, heat stress also did not affect (P > 0.05) the IOD of the ABCG2 positive portion and the expression of the ABCG2 mRNA in the pectorales, crureus, duodenum, jejunum, ileum and spleen, while significantly increased (P < 0.05) the corresponding tissues ROS production at the end of the 1st week of heat stress. In contrast, at the end of the 2nd week of heat stress, IOD of the ABCG2 positive portion and the expression of the ABCG2 mRNA in heat stress group significantly increased (P < 0.05), while the corresponding tissues ROS production had no difference (P > 0.05) compared to the control group. Collectively, duration of thermal stress affects growth performance, serum oxidative stress indices, and the expression of ABCG2 and the ROS production of broiler tissues in a time-dependent manner.

F.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata, L.) is very sensitive to low temperatures, which induce fasting and reduced growth performances. There is a strong interest in understanding the impact of cold on fish metabolism to foster the development and optimization of specific aquaculture practices for the winter period. In this study, an 8 week feeding trial was carried out on gilthead sea bream juveniles reared in a Recirculated Aquaculture System (RAS) by applying a temperature ramp in two phases of four weeks each: a cooling phase from 18 degrees C to 11 degrees C and a cold maintenance phase at 11 degrees C. Liver protein profiles were evaluated with a shotgun proteomics workflow based on filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-Q-TOF MS/MS) followed by label-free differential analysis. Along the whole trial, sea breams underwent several changes in liver protein abundance. These occurred mostly during the cooling phase when catabolic processes were mainly observed, including protein and lipid degradation, together with a reduction in protein synthesis and amino acid metabolism. A decrease in protein mediators of oxidative stress protection was also seen. Liver protein profiles changed less during cold maintenance, but pathways such as the methionine cycle and sugar metabolism were significantly affected. These results provide novel insights on the dynamics and extent of the metabolic shift occurring in sea bream liver with decreasing water temperature, supporting future studies on temperature-adapted feed formulations.

Wistar rats were ovariectomized, and implanted with a silastic tube with or without E-2 (E-2(+) and E-2(-) groups). L-menthol (10\%) or vehicle was applied to the skin of the whole trunk in selected animals, which were then exposed to 27 degrees C or 16 degrees C for 2 h. Continuous body temperature (T-b), tail skin temperature (T-tail), and treatment-associated behaviors were measured. cFos immunoreactive (cFos-IR) cells in the median preoptic area, paraventricular nucleus (PVN), medial preoptic area, posterior hypothalamus, and dorsomedial hypothalamus were counted. At 27 degrees C, in the E-2(+) and E-2(-) groups, the T-b and T-tail were greater in rats applied menthol than that in rats applied vehicle. In rats applied menthol, the T-b in the E-2(+) group was lower than that in the E-2(-) group. In the E-2(+) and E-2(-) groups, the number of cFos-IR cells in the PVN was greater in rats applied menthol than that in rats applied vehicle. These results suggested that menthol treatment increased T-b in ovariectomized rats with or without E-2 at 27 degrees C, and that activation of the PVN might be involved in this response.

Fish were exposed to heat stress at 35 C and sampled at 0, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after exposure and compared with a control group maintained at 28 C. The results showed that red and white blood cell counts, hemoglobin levels, and hematocrit values tended to increase (P < 0.05) and reached their maximum levels after 24 h, then declined. Acute heat stress enhanced serum glucose, total protein, and total cholesterol levels, and muscle fatty acid components were also altered. Serum alanine aminonansferase (ALT) activity was significantly increased after heat stress for 6 and 12 h. Polyunsaturated fatty acids levels were increased after heat stress for 12 and 24 h, whereas levels of monounsaturated fatty acids decreased in response to heat stress.

article,Delimitation of the embryonic thermosensitive period for sex determination using an embryo growth model reveals a potential bias for sex ratio prediction in turtles,"Girondot, Marc and Monsinjon, Jonathan and Guillon, Jean-Michel",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The sexual phenotype of the gonad is dependent on incubation temperature in many turtles, all crocodilians, and some lepidosaurians. At hatching, identification of sexual phenotype is impossible without sacrificing the neonates. For this reason, a general method to infer sexual phenotype from incubation temperatures is needed. Temperature influences sex determination during a specific period of the embryonic development, starting when the gonad begins to form. At constant incubation temperatures, this thermosensitive period for sex determination (TSP) is located at the middle third of incubation duration (MID). When temperature fluctuates, the position of the thermosensitive period for sex determination can be shifted from the MTID because embryo growth Is affected by temperature. A method is proposed to locate the thermosensitive period for sex determination based on modelling the embryo growth, allowing its precise identification from a natural regime of temperatures. Results from natural nests and simulations show that the approximation of the thermosensitive period for sex determination to the middle third of incubation duration may create a quasi-systematic bias to lower temperatures when computing the average incubation temperature during this period and thus a male-bias for sex ratio estimate.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.02.006,73,NA,32-40,NA,Temperature; Incubation; Reptile; Turtle; Norm of reaction; Temperature-dependent sex determination; Thermosensitive period; Sex ratio
article,"Moderate intensity, exercise-induced catecholamine release in the preoptic area and anterior hypothalamus in rats is enhanced in a warm environment","Zheng, Xinyan and Takatsu, Satomi and Ishikawa, Ryo and Hasegawa, Hiroshi",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Thermoeffector responses and core body temperature (T-core) homeostasis during exercise are affected by both ambient temperature and exercise intensity. We have previously reported that Tcore, heat loss responses, and catecholamine release in the preoptic area and anterior hypothalamus (PO/AH) increased during incremental treadmill running. However, no previous study has examined whether changes in the thermoregulatory responses at warm ambient temperature are related to catecholamine responses during moderate intensity exercise in rats. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the responsiveness of neurotransmission in the PO/AH to moderate intensity exercise at different ambient temperatures, and to relate this to changes in thermoregulation. We measured the monoamine levels in the PO/AH and the thermoregulatory responses in exercising rats simultaneously using a combination of methods, including in vivo microdialysis, biotelemetry, and animal O-2/CO2 metabolism measuring system. On the day of experiments, rats ran for 60 min at a speed of 18 m min(-1) on a treadmill at a 5\% gradient, in an ambient temperature of 23 degrees C or 30 degrees C. Tcore, tail skin temperature (T-tail; an index of heat loss), and oxygen consumption (VO2: an index of heat production) were monitored. Dopamine (DA), noradrenaline (NA), and serotonin (5-HT) levels were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection. Exercise significantly increased the Tcore, Trail, and VO2 values, as well as DA and NA release in the PO/AH at both temperatures, and the increases were more pronounced at the warm ambient temperature. The results suggest that the increase in the T-core heat production, and heat loss responses even during moderate intensity running in a warm environment are likely associated with an increase in DA and NA release in the PO/AH region.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.11.003,71,NA,123-127,NA,Thermoregulation; Monoamine; Thermoregulatory center; Exercise; Warm ambient temperature
article,Thermal performance curves under daily thermal fluctuation: A study in helmeted water toad tadpoles,"Bartheld, Jose L. and Artacho, Paulina and Bacigalupe, Leonardo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Most research in physiological ecology has focused on the effects of mean changes in temperature under the classic ``hot vs cold{'' acclimation treatment; however, current evidence suggests that an increment in both the mean and variance of temperature could act synergistically to amplify the negative effects of global temperature increase and how it would affect fitness and performance-related traits in ectothermic organisms. We assessed the effects of acclimation to daily variance of temperature on thermal performance curves of swimming speed in helmeted water toad tadpoles (Calyptocephalella gayi). Acclimation treatments were 20 degrees C +/- 0.1 SD (constant) and 20 degrees C +/- 1.5 SD (fluctuating). We draw two key findings: first, tadpoles exposed to daily temperature fluctuation had reduced maximal performance (Z(max)), and flattened thermal performance curves, thus supporting the ``vertical shift or faster-slower{''} hypothesis, and suggesting that overall swimming performance would be lower through an examination of temperatures under more realistic and ecologically-relevant fluctuating regimens; second, there was significant interindividual variation in performance traits by means of significant repeatability estimates. Our present results suggest that the widespread use of constant acclimation temperatures in laboratory experiments to estimate thermal performance curves (TPCs) may lead to an overestimation of actual organismal performance. We encourage the use of temperature fluctuation acclimation treatments to better understand the variability of physiological traits, which predict ecological and evolutionary responses to global change.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.09.008,70,B,80-85,NA,Acclimation; Thermal performance curve; TPCs; Daily thermal fluctuation; Interindividual variation; Tadpole swimming performance; Calyptocephalella gayi
article,Effect of thermal stress on fertility and egg quality of Japanese quail,"El-Tarabany, Mahmoud S.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Heat stress is one of the major causes of a decreased performance of laying quail in tropical and subtropical countries. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of temperature humidity index (THI) on fertility aspects, external and internal egg quality parameters in Japanese quail. One hundred and forty four (144) Japanese quail, 12 of weeks age, were used. Birds were divided randomly into three equal groups, control (at low THI, lower than 70), H-1 (at moderate THI, 70-75) and H-2 (at high THI, 76-80). Quail in the control and H-1 groups had significant greater fertility (p=0.021) and hatchability \% (p=0.037), compared with H-2 group. Quail in the control group (at low THI) laid heavier egg weight with a higher external (egg weight (p=0.03), shell thickness, shell weight, eggshell ratio and eggshell density (p=.001)) and internal egg quality score (albumin weight (p=0.026), yolk height (p=0.003), yolk index (p=0.039) and Haugh unit (p=0.001)). Otherwise, such quality traits were compromised in heat stressed quail. At the high THI level, egg weight had a significant positive correlation with albumin weight (r=0.58, p < 0.01), yolk weight (r=0.22, p < 0.05), albumen ratio (r=0.17, p < 0.05), yolk height (r=0.14, p < 0.05) and yolk index (r=0.18, p < 0.05), but was negatively correlated with yolk ratio (r=-0.15, p < 0.05).

article,Evaluation of physiological strain in hot work areas using thermal imagery,"Holm, Clint A. and Pahler, Leon and Thiese, Matthew S. and Handy, Rodney",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Background: Monitoring core body temperature to identify heat strain in workers engaged in hot work in heat stress environments is intrusive and expensive. Nonintrusive, inexpensive methods are needed to calculate individual Physiological Strain Index (PSI). Objective: Thermal imaging and heart rate monitoring were used in this study to calculate Physiological Strain Index (PSI) from thermal imaging temperatures of human subjects wearing thermal protective garments during recovery from hot work. Methods: Ten male subjects were evaluated for physiological strain while participating in hot work. Thermal images of the head and neck were captured with a high-resolution thermal imaging camera concomitant with measures of gastrointestinal and skin temperature. Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (rho\_c), Pearson's coefficient (r) and bias correction factor (C-b) were calculated to compare thermal imaging based temperatures to gastrointestinal temperatures. Calculations of PSI based thermal imaging recorded temperatures were compared to gastrointestinal based PSI. Results: Participants reached a peak PSI of 5.2, indicating moderate heat strain. Sagittal measurements showed low correlation (rho\_c=0.133), moderate precision (r=0.496) and low accuracy (C\_b=0.269) with gastrointestinal temperature. Bland-Altman plots of imaging measurements showed increasing agreement as gastrointestinal temperature rose; however, the Limits of Agreement (LoA) fell outside the +/- 0.25 C range of clinical significance. Bland-Altman plots of PSI calculated from imaging measurements showed increasing agreement as gastrointestinal temperature rose; however, the LoA fell outside the +/- 0.5 range of clinical significance. Conclusion: Results of this study confirmed previous research showing thermal imagery is not highly correlated to body core temperature during recovery from moderate heat strain in mild ambient conditions. Measurements display a trend toward increasing correlation at higher body core temperatures. Accuracy was not sufficient at mild to moderate heat strain to allow calculation of individual physiological stress. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Our study demonstrates that at the thermal ablation position temperature predicted by non-linear and linear DPL models show significant differences. A comparison has been made among non-linear DPL, thermal wave and Pennes model and it has been found that non-linear DPL and thermal wave bio-heat model show almost same nature whereas non-linear Pennes model shows significantly different temperature profile at the initial stage of thermal ablation treatment. The effect of Fourier number and Vernotte number (relaxation Fourier number) on temperature profile in presence and absence of externally applied heat source has been studied in detail and it has been observed that the presence of externally applied heat source term highly affects the efficiency of thermal treatment method.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the differences in serum mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), rumen temperature (T-RUMEN) and rectal temperature (T-RECTAL) values between adult and kids goats. Ten adult male Maltese goats aged 3-5 years old (Group A) and 30 male kids, raised for meat, were enrolled in this study. The kids were equally divided into 3 groups according to their age: Group B included kids aged 3 months, Group C included kids aged 4 months and Group D included kids aged 5 months. Blood samples and measurements of TRUMEN and T-RECTAL were obtained from each animal. One-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to evaluate the effect of age on the studied parameters. Statistically significant higher serum UCP1 levels (P < 0.001) were found in Group A as compared to Groups B, C and D. Higher TRUMEN values (P < 0.001) were found in Group A than in Groups B, C and D, and in Group B than in Groups C and D. Group A showed lower T-RECTAL values (P < 0.001) than Groups B, C and D. The Pearson's Correlation test was applied to assess significant relationship among studied parameters showing a statistically significant negative correlation between the values of TRECTAL and serum UCP1 in all studied Groups (P < 0.001). These results indicate that goats have good control of body temperature suggesting that further details about the thermogenic capacity and the function of UCP1 in kids and adult goats are worth exploring.

article,"Potential for thermal tolerance to mediate climate change effects on three members of a cool temperate lizard genus, <i>Niveoscincus</i>","Caldwell, Amanda J. and While, Geoffrey M. and Beeton, Nicholas J. and Wapstra, Erik",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Climatic changes are predicted to be greater in higher latitude and mountainous regions but species specific impacts are difficult to predict. This is partly due to inter-specific variance in the physiological traits which mediate environmental temperature effects at the organismal level. We examined variation in the critical thermal minimum (CTmin), critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and evaporative water loss rates (EWL) of a widespread lowland (Niveoscincus ocellatus) and two range restricted highland (N. microlepidotus and N. green members of a cool temperate Tasmanian lizard genus. The widespread lowland species had significantly higher CTmin and CTmax and significantly lower EWL than both highland species. Implications of inter-specific variation in thermal tolerance for activity were examined under contemporary and future climate change scenarios. Instances of air temperatures below CTmin were predicted to decline in frequency for the widespread lowland and both highland species. Air temperatures of high altitude sites were not predicted to exceed the CTmax of either highland species throughout the 21st century. In contrast, the widespread lowland species is predicted to experience air temperatures in excess of CTmax on 1 or 2 days by three of six global circulation models from 2068-2096. To estimate climate change effects on activity we reran the thermal tolerance models using minimum and maximum temperatures selected for activity. A net gain in available activity time was predicted under climate change for all three species; while air temperatures were predicted to exceed maximum temperatures selected for activity with increasing frequency, the change was not as great as the predicted decline in air temperatures below minimum temperatures selected for activity. We hypothesise that the major effect of rising air temperatures under climate change is an increase in available activity period for both the widespread lowland and highland species. The consequences of a greater available activity period will depend on the extent to which changes in climate alters other related factors, such as the nature and level of competition between the respective species.

article,A numerical study on dual-phase-lag model of bio-heat transfer during hyperthermia treatment,"Kumar, P. and Kumar, Dinesh and Rai, K. N.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The success of hyperthermia in the treatment of cancer depends on the precise prediction and control of temperature. It was absolutely a necessity for hyperthermia treatment planning to understand the temperature distribution within living biological tissues. In this paper, dual-phase-lag model of bio-heat transfer has been studied using Gaussian distribution source term under most generalized boundary condition during hyperthermia treatment. An approximate analytical solution of the present problem has been done by Finite element wavelet Galerkin method which uses Legendre wavelet as a basis function. Multi-resolution analysis of Legendre wavelet in the present case localizes small scale variations of solution and fast switching of functional bases. The whole analysis is presented in dimensionless form. The dual-phase-lag model of bin-heat transfer has compared with Pennes and Thermal wave model of bio-heat transfer and it has been found that large differences in the temperature at the hyperthermia position and time to achieve the hyperthermia temperature exist, when we increase the value of tau(T). Particular cases when surface subjected to boundary condition of 1st, 2nd and 3rd kind are discussed in detail. The use of dual-phase-lag model of bin-heat transfer and finite element wavelet Galerkin method as a solution method helps in precise prediction of temperature. Gaussian distribution source term helps in control of temperature during hyperthermia treatment. So, it makes this study more useful for clinical applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Variation in the thermal ecology of an endemic iguana from Mexico reduces its vulnerability to global warming,"Valenzuela-Ceballos, Sara and Castaneda, Gamaliel and Rioja-Paradela, Tamara and Carrillo-Reyes, Arturo and Bastiaans, Elizabeth",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The persistence of reptile populations in a specific location is influenced by individuals' capacity to regulate their body temperatures, among other factors. Anthropogenic climate change may pose a risk to the survival of ectothermic animals due to their dependence on external heat sources to thermoregulate. In this study, we calculated indices of thermal habitat quality, thermoregulatory precision, and thermoregulatory effectiveness for the endemic spiny-tailed iguana Ctenosaura oaxacana. We evaluated these indices and the thermoregulatory behavior of the iguanas in the four types of vegetation that provide the most favorable conditions for thermoregulation. We also performed our experiments during both the wet and dry seasons to capture the full range of thermal conditions available to C oaxacana over the course of a year. Finally, we evaluated the potential niche for the iguana in the years 2020, 2050, and 2080. Thermoregulation depends on both seasonal and environmental factors in this species. We found that thermoregulation effectiveness in both wet and dry seasons depends not only on the thermal conditions of the immediate environment, but also on the cover vegetation and habitat structure available across the range of habitats the species uses. Thus, heterogeneous habitats with dispersed vegetation may be most suitable for this species' thermoregulatory strategy. Likewise, niche modeling results suggested that suitable habitat for our study species may continue to be available for the next few decades, despite global warming tendencies, as long as cover vegetation remains unaltered. Our results suggest that thermoregulation is a complex process that cannot be generalized for all ectothermic species inhabiting a given region. We also found that temperature changes are not the only factor one must consider when estimating the risk of species loss.

Ten male runners were recruited for the study, The run was carried out individually under solar radiation on a predetermined path in the following environmental conditions (ambient temperature: 27.96 +/- 1.70 degrees C, globe temperature: 28.52 +/- 2.51 degrees C, relative humidity: 76.88 +/- 7.49\%, wet bulb globe temperature: 25.80 +/- 1.18 degrees C). Core temperature, skin temperature, head temperature, heat storage, heart rate, expired gases, rating of perceived exertion, and speed were measured or calculated before the start, every 3 km, and immediately following the run. Comparisons were made for each dependent variable using one-way repeated measures analysis of variance tests, and a Bonferroni test. Average run time and pace were 101:00 +/- 9:52 min and 4:48 +/- 00:16 min km(-1), respectively. Participants significantly reduced their running speed, oxygen consumption, and heat storage at 9 km (p < 0.05). While core temperature was significantly increased at 6 km (p < 0.05) before plateauing for the remainder of the run. The key finding was that most of the runners reduced their pace when a T-core of 39 degrees C was reached which occurred between 6 and 9 km of the run, yet runners were able to increase their speed demonstrating an ``end-spurt{''} near the end of the run.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102734,93,NA,NA,102734,Heat stress; Exercise; Running

Ten (10) Caninde goats aged between 2 and 3 years, non-lactating, non-pregnant and having a body weight (B-w) of 22.90 +/- 2.70 kg were used in this study. Air temperature (A(T)) and relative humidity (R-H) were measured, and the radiant heat load (RHL) was subsequently calculated. Rectal temperature (R-T), respiratory rate (R-R), sweating rate (S-R) and heat shock (S) were recorded at 1-h intervals for 24 continuous hours. Hydrogen potential (pH), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2), partial pressure of oxygen (PO2), bicarbonate (HCO3), base excess (BE), total carbon dioxide concentration (TCO2), oxygen saturation (SO2), sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) were recorded at three moments during the day (5 a.m.; 1 p.m.; 6 p.m.). There were also significant differences between the means of hours of the day for A(T) and R-H. R-R was the thermoregulatory response which most closely followed RHL, with important elevations in the periods between 10 a.m. to noon. It was observed that the goats activated their SR mechanism before R-R, more precisely between the hours of 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. The acid-base and electrolytic equilibrium for the goats which showed great association with the first components contributed the most to the total variation of the data. The most important variables in the adaptive profile of these animals in order of importance were: SO2, PO2, R-R, R-T, S-R, HCO3, BE, TCO2 and pH. An association between all variables grouped in each period was observed, where the thermoregulatory responses in the periods of 5 a.m. and 6 p.m. were closer than when compared to 1 p.m., showing a physiological return to the initial state. Therefore, the variation in thermoregulatory responses, acid-base and electrolytic equilibrium indicated that the goats have the ability to recover after a challenging environmental condition.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102593,90,NA,NA,102593,Adaptation; Blood gas; Caninde goats; Daily rhythmicity; Heat stress; Multivariate; Analysis
article,Purine levels and purinergic signaling in plasma and spleen of <i>Brycon amazonicus</i> exposed to acute heat thermal stress: An attempt to regulate the immune response,"Souza, Carine de Freitas and Baldissera, Matheus D. and Barroso, Danilo C. and Val, Adalberto Luis and Baldisserotto, Bernardo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Amazon fish are vulnerable to climate change. Several lines of evidence suggest that the temperature of Amazonian rivers will increase in the coming years. Elevated temperature disturbs homeostasis and subjects fish to physiological stress; however, the effects of temperature on immunity remain poorly understood, particularly those effects involving purinergic signaling. This system fine-tunes the inflammatory and immune responses triggered by stress. Therefore, the aims of this study were to determine whether acute heat stress induces the release of nucleotides into extracellular compartment and to determine whether purinergic enzymes modulate the pminflammatory effects of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in plasma and spleen of matrinxa (Brycon amazonicus) exposed to acute heat stress. We exposed juvenile matrinxa to four temperature regimes (28 degrees C as control, 30, 32 and 34 degrees C) for 72 h and observed the effects on purinergic signaling. Plasma cortisol levels were significantly higher in fish exposed to 34 degrees C than in the control group, while spleen ATP, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) levels were significantly higher in this group than in controls. Activities of spleen nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (NTPDase) and 5'-nucleotidase were significantly higher in fish exposed to 34 degrees C than those of the control group, while spleen interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were higher in this same group than in the control group. No significant differences were observed between the groups regarding plasma parameters. Based on these data, we concluded that acute heat stress at 34 degrees C caused physiological stress in matrinxa, manifesting as elevated plasma cortisol levels. The most important finding is that purinergic enzymes were modulated, though not efficiently, in response to the excessive release of nucleotides into the extracellular space. In summary, the purinergic signaling pathway may be involved in the impairment of immune and inflammatory responses in matrinxa exposed acutely to 34 degrees C.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102569,89,NA,NA,102569,Aquaculture; Climate changes; Immunity; Water temperature; Cortisol

Newly hatched larvae are highly sensitive to changes in environmental conditions, with water temperature (T) and dissolved oxygen (DO) being two important factors that affect their early development. We investigate optimal T (between 19.0 and 33.0 degrees C) and DO (between 2.0 and 12.0 mg L-1) concentrations on growth and antioxidant enzyme activity of newly hatched hybrid yellow catfish larvae (Tachysurus fulvidraco x Pseudobagrus vachellii) using a central composite design. We use a response surface method to optimize the response variables for survival (S) and growth, and the reduction of oxidative stress, over a 50-day experimental duration. T has a significant effect on specific growth rate (SGR), hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities (P < 0.05). DO concentration has a significant effect on SGR, S, hepatic MDA content, and SOD and CAT activities (P < 0.05). T and DO also have significant second order effects on SGR, S, SOD, and CAT activities (P < 0.05). Increased DO at low T stimulates SOD and CAT activities and alleviates oxidative damage. Adjusted R-2 values for SGR, S, CAT, SOD, and MDA models are 0.734, 0.937, 0.916, 0.894 and 0.826, respectively. A combination of 26.8 degrees C and 7.3 mg L-1 represents optimal rearing conditions, in that larval growth and antioxidant ability is improved.

article,Mechanisms related to sexual determination by temperature in reptiles,"Martinez-Juarez, Adriana and Moreno-Mendoza, Norma",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"A number of strategies have emerged that appear to relate to the evolution of mechanisms for sexual determination in vertebrates, among which are genetic sex determination caused by sex chromosomes and environmental sex determination, where environmental factors influence the phenotype of the sex of an individual. Within the reptile group, some orders such as: Chelonia, Crocodylia, Squamata and Rhynchocephalia, manifest one of the most intriguing and exciting environmental sexual determination mechanisms that exists, comprising temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), where the temperature of incubation that the embryo experiences during its development is fundamental to establishing the sex of the individual. This makes them an excellent model for the study of sexual determination at the molecular, cellular and physiological level, as well as in terms of their implications at an evolutionary and ecological level. There are different hypotheses concerning how this process is triggered and this review aims to describe any new contributions to particular TSD hypotheses, analyzing them from the ``eco-evo-devo{''} perspective.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102400,85,NA,NA,102400,Reptiles; Temperature-dependent sex determination; Gonadal morphogenesis; Phenotypic plasticity; Genetic network; Eco-evo-devo
article,"The evolution of wetness perception: A comparison of arachnid, insect and human models","Merrick, Charlotte and Filingeri, Davide",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Hygroreceptors are a type of humidity sensor that have been identified in several invertebrate classes including Insecta and Arachnida. While their structure has been well researched, the nature of the mechanisms behind their function is debated as being either mechanical, evaporative, or psychrometric in insects and potentially also olfactory in arachnids. There is evidence that can be used to support or oppose each of these concepts, which also invites the possibility of multiple unified mechanisms occurring together. The integration of multiple sensory modalities has also formed the foundation of wetness perception in humans, led by thermal and tactile cues with supplementary information from vision and sound. These inputs are integrated by a vast neural network in the brain, which also occurs on a smaller scale in insects and arachnids. It is possible that as cerebral capacity increased throughout human evolution, this facilitated a preferable system of wetness perception via multisensory integration and rendered hygroreceptors obsolete. While this cerebral development hypothesis is only speculative, it gives a framework for further investigation. Additional research needs to be conducted to correctly classify hygroreceptor types in invertebrates and their relative prevalence before evolutionary associations can be made with vertebrate species. This integratory premise also applies to the human system, as knowing the relative contribution and compounding effects of each sensory modality on wetness perception will aid the overall understanding of the system and help to uncover the evolutionary development pathways underpinning each sense.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102412,85,NA,NA,102412,Hygroreceptors; Wetness perception; Multisensory integration; Evolution
article,The effect of temporal adaptation to different temperatures and osmolarities on heat response of TRPV4 in cultured cells,"Sawai, Hiroko and Kohda, Katsunori and Kurahashi, Tetsuo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channel is a polymodal receptor activated by moderate heat and hypoosmolarity. TRPV4 expressed in the skin area contributes to several skin functions as a barrier to maintain internal body physiology and a transporter of external stimuli. The skin condition such as skin temperature and osmolarity varies with internal and external changes, and may influence the activity of TRPV4 contributing to skin physiology, thermal sensation, and thermoregulation. However, the combination effect of skin conditions such as temperature and osmolarity on the activity of TRPV4 has not been examined. In the current study, we investigated the effect of temporal adaptation (5-10 min) to different temperature (25-35 degrees C) and osmolarity (250-350 mOsm) conditions on the heat response (until 40 degrees C) of human TRPV4 in cultured cells using Ca2+ imaging. The temperature to activate TRPV4 increased with elevation of the adaptation temperature, and decreased with the adaptation to hypoosmolarity in the range of 25-35 degrees C. In addition, the heat response was inhibited with the adaptation to hyperosmolarity in the range of 25-35 degrees C. Thus, we demonstrated that the activation temperature of TRPV4 varied with the temporal sensory adaptation to different temperature and osmolarity conditions. These findings may contribute to gaining better understanding of the variation in several TRPV4-mediated skin functions.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102424,85,NA,NA,102424,TRPV4; Polymodal receptor; Activation temperature; Adaptation temperature; Osmolarity
article,Skin TRPA1 ion channel participates in thermoregulatory response to cold. Comparison with the effect of TRPM8,"Kozyreva, V, T. and Kozaruk, V. P. and Meyta, E. S.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"There was no clear evidence of the TRPA1 ion channel involvement in the formation of thermoregulatory responses. The present results convincingly show that the skin TRPA1 ion channel activation has significant influence on the formation of thermoregulatory responses of the body to cooling; it is especially strongly manifested for the metabolic component. At the TRPA1 activation by its agonist AITC (0.04\%), an enhancement in thermoregulatory responses is observed: the temperature thresholds for the first phase and the second one of the metabolic response decrease, the values of all components of the metabolic response considerably increase: the increment of oxygen consumption in the first phase increases from 1.8 +/- 0.24 in the control to 2.9 +/- 0.35 ml/min{*}kg under AITC, P = 0.04; the increment of oxygen consumption in the second phase increases from 6.2 +/- 2.06 to 17.4 +/- 1.20 ml/min{*}kg, P = 0.002, as well as shivering rises from 7.8 +/- 1.79 to 15.4 +/- 1.87 mV, P = 0.011. In consideration of our previous results on the influence of TRPM8 ion channel activation on thermoregulatory responses (Kozyreva et al., J. Therm.Biol., 2010) it is obvious that the TRPM8 and TRPA1 ion channels have a pronounced, but unequal effects on the values of different phases of the metabolic response to cold. The TRPM8 activation manifests itself in an increase of value only the urgent first phase, this phase is associated with carbohydrate metabolism. As the recent results have shown the influence of the TRPA1 activation is realized predominantly in the clearly marked increase in the second phase of the metabolic response associated with lipid metabolism, as well as in evident shivering gain. The ability to predominantly control different parameters of thermoregulatory responses to cold may indicate the importance of both the TRPM8 and the TRPA1 ion channels in the processes of maintaining temperature homeostasis. The obtained data testify to the joint sequential operation of these thermosensitive ion channels.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.06.010,84,NA,208-213,NA,TRPA1 ion channel; Thermoregulation; Cold; TRPM8 ion channel

Ectotherm performance can be maintained in thermally heterogeneous habitats by reducing the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes and concomitant performance. We examined the capacity of juvenile green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris) to respond to daily thermal variation. Juveniles (47 days post-hatch) were exposed to either stable (15 +/- 0.5 degrees C) or variable (narrowly variable: 13-17 degrees C day(-1) or widely variable 11-21 degrees C day(-1)) thermoperiod treatments, with equivalent mean temperatures (15 +/- 0.5 degrees C), for 21 days. Growth (relative growth rate, \% body mass gain), upper thermal tolerance (critical thermal maxima, CTMax) and the thermal sensitivity of swimming performance (critical swimming speed, U-crit) were assessed in fish from all treatments. Accelerated growth was observed in fish maintained under widely variable temperatures compared to narrowly variable and stable temperatures. No significant variation in CTMax was observed among thermoperiod treatments, suggesting all treatment groups acclimated to the mean temperature rather than daily maximums. The widely variable treatment induced a plastic response in swimming performance, where U-crit was insensitive to temperature and performance was maintained across a widened thermal breadth. Maximum U-crit attained was similar among thermoperiod treatments, but performance was maximised at different test temperatures (stable: 4.62 +/- 0.44 BL s(-1) at 15 degrees C; narrowly variable: 4.52 +/- 0.23 BL s(-1) at 21 degrees C; widely variable: 3.90 +/- 0.24 BL s(-1) at 11 degrees C, mean +/- s.e.m.).

In this study, we measured locomotor performance in two different altitude populations of the Qinghai toad-headed lizards (Pluynocephalus vlangalii) at different test temperatures to assess between population differences in thermal sensitivity of sprint speed. Low-elevation lizards ran faster than high-elevation lizards at most test temperatures. Sprint speed varied with test temperature similarly between populations, but the thermal sensitivity (performance breadth) differed significantly. Low-elevation lizards had a lower optimal temperature (T-opt) for sprint speed and narrower performance breadth than high-elevation lizards as inferred from the thermal performance curves constructed for each individual. We also measured the body temperature of active lizards (T-b) in the field and selected temperature (T-sel) in the laboratory. Low-elevation lizards had a lower T-sel and less variable Tb than high-elevation lizards. In both populations, T-opt waslower than T-opt for sprint speed, which was inconsistent with the prediction for a match between thermal preference and Topt. Our results suggest that lower thermal sensitivity and weaker locomotor ability for high-elevation lizards may be an adaptive response to the local environmental conditions (e.g., greater thermal variability, higher food availability, and lower predator pressure).",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.11.005,71,NA,136-141,NA,Phrynocephalus vlangalii; Thermal sensitivity; Optimal temperature; Body temperature

By using RNA-seq, we have previously found that endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) may involve in regulating embryonic muscle development of duck under the influence of temperature alteration. To further clarify the role of ERS in the effect, in the present study, we detected the impact of increasing the incubation temperature by 1 degrees C during embryonic days 10-27 (E10-27) on the development of duck embryos, and investigated the changes in mRNA and protein expression of ERS marker genes and muscle-related genes under the thermal manipulation (TM). The results of relative weight comparison showed that only the relative weight of breast muscle was steadily decreased by TM from E10 to the first day after hatching (WO). Meanwhile, the real-time PCR and western-blot analysis revealed that raising the incubation temperature stimulated the expression of ERS marker genes in breast muscle at E20. The mRNA expressions of muscle hypertrophy and atrophy-related genes were also detected, and were not changed regularly, however, the protein expressions of hypertrophy-related genes were all decreased at both E20 and WO, and the protein expression of atrophy-related genes were up-regulated at E20. The protein expression of muscle proliferation-related genes were also decreased at E20. Additionally, these results were the same as that in the ERS positive control groups. Taken together, these results indicated that long-term TM during late embryonic period could block the development of duck breast muscle by inhibiting muscle hypertrophy and proliferation, and promoting muscle atrophy at a post-transcriptional level via the activation of ERS.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.10.008,70,B,37-45,NA,High temperature; Tunicamycin; ER stress; Poultry; Muscle growth

Water temperature greatly influences the absorption and utilization of dietary lipid by fish. Response values (including growth, hepatic fat deposition, and gene expression) for darkbarbel catfish mediated by two factors (water temperature 20-34 degrees C; dietary lipid level 2-17\%) were the focus of this study. The relationship between the two factors and the response values was evaluated by the response surface method using the central composite design. The experiment was conducted under laboratory conditions and lasted for seven weeks. A total of 975 experimental fish (average weight 11.75 +/- 0.17 g) were selected and placed in 39 plastic tanks. The results showed that the linear effects of lipid level on feed conversion rate (FCR), hepatopancreas somatic index (HSI), hepatic triglycerides (TG), cholesterol (TC), and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene expression were significant (P < 0.05). The linear effects of water temperature on specific growth rate (SGR), HSI, TC level, and LPL mRNA expression were significant (P < 0.05). The quadratic effects of water temperature and lipid level on SGR and FCR were significant (P < 0.05). Low water temperature and low lipid diets significantly inhibited growth, increased HSI, and reduced hepatic TG and TC levels, and LPL mRNA expression.

Apart from that, apoptosis can be induced by various external stimuli such as hyperthermia, ionizing radiation, and electric fields. Despite advantages, both physical and pharmacological approaches bear some limitations as well. The rationale of this study was to overcome the limitations by combining hyperthermia and apoptotic modulator `bortezomib' (Velcade). Two types of human blood cancer cell lines were utilized: human leukemic monocyte lymphoma cell U937 line and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs) derived from the patient diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. Prior to apoptosis experiments, cytotoxicity tests were performed at three types of temperature regimes (40 degrees, 42 degrees and 44 degrees C). We observed a gradual inhibition of cell viability correlating with an increase of temperature and drug concentration in both cell lines. However, there was no significant difference between sham group and groups of leukemic PMBCs treated by high temperature (44 degrees C) and bortezomib. In U937 cells, combined treatment by heat shock and bortezomib led to an increase the number of cells underwent the late apoptosis stage. At the same time, similar treatment of PMBCs resulted in the stimulation of early apoptosis. Our data suggest that combination of bortezomib and hyperthermia enhances apoptosis induction in human cancer white blood cells, indicating a therapeutic potential for blood cancer therapy.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.04.009,67,NA,9-14,NA,Hyperthermia; Cytotoxicity; Apoptosis; Bortezomib; Velcade; Blood cancer
article,Nano-assisted radiofrequency ablation of clinically extracted irregularly-shaped liver tumors,"Shao, Y. L. and Arjun, B. and Leo, H. L. and Chua, K. J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for liver tumors is a minimally invasive procedure that uses electrical energy and heat to destroy cancer cells. One of the critical factors that impedes its successful outcome is the use of inappropriate radiofrequency levels that will not completely destroy the target tumor tissues, resulting in therapy failure. Additionally, the surrounding healthy tissues may suffer from serious damage due to excessive ablation. To address these challenges, this work proposes the employment of injected nanoparticles to thermally promote the ablation efficacy of conventional RFA. A three-dimensional finite difference analysis is employed to simulate the RFA treatment. Based on the data acquired from measured experiments, the simulation results have demonstrated close agreement with experimental data with a maximum discrepancy of within +/- 8.7\%. Several types of nanoparticles were selected to evaluate their influences on liver tissue's thermal and electrical properties. We analysed the effects of nanoparticles on liver RFA via a tumor rending process incorporating several clinically-extracted tumor profiles and vascular systems. Simulations were conducted to explore the temperature difference responses between conventional RFA treatment and one with the inclusion of assisted nanoparticles on several irregularly-shaped tumors. Results have indicated that applying selected nanoparticles with high thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity on the targeted tissue zone promotes heating rate while sustaining a similar ablation zone that experiences lower maximum temperature when compared with the conventional RFA treatment. In sum, incorporating thermally-enhancing nanoparticles promotes heat transfer during the RFA treatment, resulting in improved ablation efficiency.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.04.005,66,NA,101-113,NA,RFA; Nanoparticle; Vascular network; Matrix system of RFA
article,Behavioral thermal tolerances of free-ranging rattlesnakes (<i>Crotalus oreganus</i>) during the summer foraging season,"Putman, Breanna J. and Clark, Rulon W.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Increasing temperature due to climate change is one of the greatest challenges for wildlife worldwide. Behavioral data on free-ranging individuals is necessary to determine at what temperatures animals modify activity as this would determine their capacity to continue to move, forage, and mate under altered thermal regimes. In particular, high temperatures could limit available surface activity time and time spent on fitness related activities. Conversely, performance, such as feeding rate, can increase with temperature potentially having positive fitness effects. Here, we examine how the hunting behaviors of free-ranging Northern Pacific Rattlesnakes (Crotalus oreganus) associate with air temperature and body temperature. We continuously recorded snakes in the field using videography, capturing behaviors rarely considered in past studies such as movements in and out of refuge and strikes on prey. We found that as mean daily air temperature increased, hunting activity and the likelihood of hunting at night decreased, while the number of movements and distance moved per day increased. Snakes typically retreated to refuge before body temperatures reached 31 C. Body temperatures of snakes hunting on the surface were lower compared to temperatures of non-hunting snakes in refuge in the morning, while this relationship was inverted in the afternoon. Snake body size influenced the disparity of these temperatures. Finally, strike initiation and success occurred across a wide range of body temperatures, indicating hunting performance may not be strongly constrained by temperature. These results on the temperatures at which free-ranging rattlesnakes exhibit fitness-related behaviors could be valuable for understanding their vulnerabilities to future climates.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.01.012,65,NA,8-15,NA,Activity; Ambush; Performance; Snake; Strike; Temperature; Voluntary maximum
article,Acute effects of a dopamine/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor on neuromuscular performance following self-paced exercise in cool and hot environments,"Onus, Katrina and Cannon, Jack and Liberts, Liz and Marino, Frank E.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Dopamine/norepinephrine (DA/NE) reuptake inhibitors have been used to manipulate the central mechanisms affecting arousal and motivation during exercise. Eight healthy, physically active males performed 30 min fixed-intensity cycling at 50\% W-max followed by 30 min of self paced time trial (TT) with each section interspersed with a 30 s maximal sprint at 9, 19 and 29 min. The DA/NE re-uptake inhibitor administered was bupropion (BUP) versus a placebo (PLA) in either warm (32 degrees C, BUP32 or PLA32) or moderate (20 degrees C; BUP20, PLA20) ambient conditions. Core and skin temperature, heart rate and perceptual responses, neuromuscular and hormonal measures were assessed at multiple times throughout the trials and post exercise. Time trial performance remained unchanged across conditions (12.7-13.1 km) although core temperature was elevated in the fixed intensity section of the trials for BUP32 and BUP20 but continued to rise only in BUP32 during the time trial reaching 38.6 degrees C (P < 0.05). NE increased in all conditions from pre-exercise with BUP32 values peaking at the end of TT to 1245.3 +/- 203.1 pg/mL (P < 0.05) compared to the other conditions. Neuromuscular responses were similar among conditions although peak force was significantly reduced from pre (262 +/- 31 N) to post (202 +/- 31 N, P < 0.05) exercise along with contraction duration (22\%, P < 0.05) in BUP20. We conclude that DA/NE re-uptake inhibitors influenced thermoregulation in the heat but not exercise performance. DA/NE re-uptake inhibitors are likely to act centrally to override the inhibitory signals for the cessation of exercise with these drugs acting peripherally to reduce the twitch characteristics of skeletal muscle in cooler conditions.

article,Thermal analysis of induced damage to the healthy cell during RFA of breast tumor,"Singh, Sundeep and Bhowmik, Arka and Repaka, Ramjee",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Effective pre-clinical computational modeling strategies have been demonstrated in this article to enable risk free clinical application of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of breast tumor. The present study (a) determines various optimal regulating parameters required for RFA of tumor and (b) introduces an essential clinical monitoring scheme to minimize the extent of damage to the healthy cell during RFA of tumor. The therapeutic capabilities offered by RFA of breast tumor, viz., the rise in local temperature and induced thermal damage have been predicted by integrating the bioheat transfer model, the electric field distribution model and the thermal damage model. The mathematical model has been validated with the experimental results available in the literature. The results revealed that, the effective damage of tumor volume sparing healthy tissue essentially depends on the voltage, the exposure time, the local heat distribution, the tumor stage and the electrode geometric configuration. It has been confirmed that, the assessment of damage front can accurately determine the extent of damage as compared to the thermal front. The study further evaluates the damaged healthy and tumor volumes due to RFA of different stages of breast cancer. The assessment of cell survival and damage fractions discloses the propensity of reappearance/healing of tumor cells after treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Exposure to solar radiation drives organismal vulnerability to climate: Evidence from an intertidal limpet,"Chapperon, Coraline and Volkenborn, Nils and Clavier, Jacques and Seite, Sarah and Seabra, Rui and Lima, Fernando P.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Understanding the physiological abilities of organisms to cope with heat stress is critical for predictions of species' distributions in response to climate change. We investigated physiological responses (respiration and heart beat rate) of the ectotherm limpet Patella vulgata to heat stress events during emersion and the role of seasonal and microclimatic acclimatization for individual thermal tolerance limits. Individuals were collected from 5 microhabitats characterized by different exposure to solar radiation in the high intertidal zone of a semi-exposed rocky shore in winter and summer of 2014. Upper thermal tolerance limits(heat coma temperatures - HCTs, and heart rate Arrhenius break temperatures ABTs) were determined for individuals from each microhabitat in both seasons under laboratory conditions. While we found a clear seasonal acclimatization, i.e., higher Has and ABTs in summer than in winter, we did not find evidence for microhabitat-specific responses that would suggest microclimatic acclimatization. However, operative limpet temperatures derived from in-situ temperature measurements suggest that individuals from sun exposed microhabitats have a much narrower thermal safety margins than those from less exposed surfaces or within crevices. Microhabitat specific thermal safety margins caused by high thermal heterogeneity at small spatial scales and the lack of short term acclimatization will likely shape small scale distribution patterns of intertidal species in response to the predicted increase in the frequency and intensity of heat waves.

article,"Cool Bands: Wing bands decrease rate of heating, but not equilibrium temperature in <i>Anartia fatima</i>","Brashears, Jake and Aiello, Annette and Seymoure, Brett M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Butterflies regulate their internal thoracic temperature in order to optimize performance activities (e.g. flight, foraging). Previous research has shown that butterfly wings, particularly the innermost portions, play a role in thermoregulation. We investigated to see whether a lightly colored wing band would alter the thermal properties of the banded peacock butterfly (Anartia fatima) with two within subject experiments in a laboratory setting: (1) band color manipulation in which euthanized individuals were heated to thermal equilibrium with the band unaltered and then again with the wing darkened; (2) wing ablation in which individuals already run through experiment 1 were heated to equilibrium two more times; once with the outer portion of the wing including the band removed and then with the entire wing removed. Individuals were spread so that the dorsal surface of the wing was exposed to illumination from a lamp suspended above. Twelve Anartia fatima males were collected in Panama and were run through experiment one. Four individuals were run through experiment two. We found no effect of darkening the band on the internal thoracic equilibrium temperature, but the darkened band did increase the rate of heating. The wing ablation experiment revealed that wing removal lowered the internal thoracic equilibrium temperature but did not affect the heating rate. Therefore we show that butterfly bands may be important in butterfly thermoregulation and we discuss the importance of the wing band on thermoregulatory abilities in Anartia fatima with respect to the butterfly's natural history. We conclude that the wing band may allow butterflies to reduce heat stress induced by their warm environments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Highest constant temperature (30 degrees C) reduced the density of M. macrocopa. The cladocerans under the fluctuating temperature regime too had lower population growth (about 50\% lower than that at constant 25 degrees C). The survivorship of M. macrocopa was higher at 20 degrees C than that at 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C or at variable temperature regime. Gross and net reproductive rates were higher at 25 degrees C. At 20 degrees C, neonates had the highest proportion (67\%) of myristic, palmitic and stearic acids while the adults had the lowest (26\%) proportion. For both adults and neonates, palmitoleic, linoleic and linolenic comprised of 15-35\% of the total fatty acids. Higher percentage (19\%) of linoleic acid was present in adults than neonates (7\%). Adults had linolenic acid level which was 3-times higher than in neonates. Linoleic and linolenic fatty acids decreased with increasing temperature for neonates and adults from 20 degrees C to 30 degrees C. The demographic responses and fatty acid profiles of M. macrocopa were discussed in relation to level and mode of temperature exposure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Do gravid female <i>Anolis nebulosus</i> thermoregulate differently than males and non-gravid females?,"Woolrich-Pina, Guillermo A. and Smith, Geoffrey R. and Lemos-Espinal, Julio A. and Pablo Ramirez-Silva, Juan",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In lizards, the role of gravid oviparous females in controlling the temperature experienced by developing embryos prior to oviposition has been rarely examined. In particular, relatively little is known about the effect of gravidity on the thermal ecology of female Anolis lizards. Here we examine the thermal ecology of Anolis nebulosus from Nayarit, Mexico, with a particular goal of comparing the thermal ecology of gravid females to that of non-gravid females and males. The thermal efficiency (E) of gravid female A. nebulosus (E=0.782) was higher than in males (E=0.464), and to a lesser extent, non-gravid females (E=0.637), despite no significant differences observed in body, air, operative, or set point temperatures among males, gravid females, and non-gravid females. Gravid females had smaller differences between body temperatures and set point temperatures (d(b)), but did not differ in the difference between operative temperature and set point temperature (d(e)). Gravid females used sun-shade and shaded micro-habitats proportionately more than males and non-gravid females, and rarely used sunny micro-habitats. Our results suggest that gravid A. nebulosus are using a different and more efficient thermoregulatory strategy than other adults in the population. Such efficient thermoregulation is possibly related to females attempting to provide a thermal environment that is conducive to the development of embryos in eggs prior to oviposition.

article,Metabolic efficiency in yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> in relation to temperature dependent growth and biomass yield,"Zakhartsev, Maksim and Yang, Xuelian and Reuss, Matthias and Poertner, Hans Otto",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Canonized view on temperature effects on growth rate of microorganisms is based on assumption of protein denaturation, which is not confirmed experimentally so far. We develop an alternative concept, which is based on view that limits of thermal tolerance are based on imbalance of cellular energy allocation. Therefore, we investigated growth suppression of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the supraoptimal temperature range (30-40 degrees C), i.e. above optimal temperature (T-opt). The maximal specific growth rate (mu(max)) of biomass, its concentration and yield on glucose (Y-x/glc) were measured across the whole thermal window (5-40 degrees C) of the yeast in batch anaerobic growth on glucose. Specific rate of glucose consumption, specific rate of glucose consumption for maintenance (m(glc)), true biomass yield on glucose (Y-x/glc(true)), fractional conservation of substrate carbon in product and ATP yield on glucose (Y-atp/glc) were estimated from the experimental data. There was a negative linear relationship between ATP, ADP and AMP concentrations and specific growth rate at any growth conditions, whilst the energy charge was always high (similar to 0.83). There were two temperature regions where m(glc) differed 12-fold, which points to the existence of a `low' (within 5-31 degrees C) and a `high' (within 33-40 degrees C) metabolic mode regarding maintenance requirements. The rise from the low to high mode occurred at 31-32 degrees C in step-wise manner and it was accompanied with onset of suppression of mu(max). High m(glc) at supraoptimal temperatures indicates a significant reduction of scope for growth, due to high maintenance cost. Analysis of temperature dependencies of product formation efficiency and Y-atp/glc revealed that the efficiency of energy metabolism approaches its lower limit at 26-31 degrees C. This limit is reflected in the predetermined combination of Y-x/glc(true) elemental biomass composition and degree of reduction of the growth substrate. Approaching the limit implies a reduction of the safety margin of metabolic efficiency. We hypothesize that a temperature increase above T-opt (e.g. > 31 degrees C) triggers both an increment in m(glc) and suppression of mu(max), which together contribute to an upshift of Y-atp/glc from the lower limit and thus compensate for the loss of the safety margin. This trade-off allows adding 10 more degrees to T-opt and extends the thermal window up to 40 degrees C, sustaining survival and reproduction in supraoptimal temperatures. Deeper understanding of the limits of thermal tolerance can be practically exploited in biotechnological applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Isothermic and fixed intensity heat acclimation methods induce similar heat adaptation following short and long-term timescales,"Gibson, Oliver R. and Mee, Jessica A. and Tuttle, James A. and Taylor, Lee and Watt, Peter W. and Maxwell, Neil S.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Heat acclimation requires the interaction between hot environments and exercise to elicit thermoregulatory adaptations. Optimal synergism between these parameters is unknown. Common practise involves utilising a fixed workload model where exercise prescription is controlled and core temperature is uncontrolled, or an isothermic model where core temperature is controlled and work rate is manipulated to control core temperature. Following a baseline heat stress test; 24 males performed a between groups experimental design performing short term heat acclimation (STHA; five 90 min sessions) and long term heat acclimation (LTHA; STHA plus further five 90 min sessions) utilising either fixed intensity (50\% (V) over dot(O2peak)), continuous isothermic (target rectal temperature 38.5 degrees C for STHA and LTHA), or progressive isothermic heat acclimation (target rectal temperature 38.5 degrees C for STHA, and 39.0 degrees C for LTHA). Identical heat stress tests followed STHA and LTHA to determine the magnitude of adaptation. All methods induced equal adaptation from baseline however isothermic methods induced adaptation and reduced exercise durations (STHA=-66\% and LTHA=-72\%) and mean session intensity (STHA=-(V) over dot(O2peak) and LTHA=-9\% (V) over dot(O2peak)) in comparison to fixed (p<0.05). STHA decreased exercising heart rate (-10 b min(-1)), core (-0.2 degrees C) and skin temperature (-0.51 degrees C), with sweat losses increasing (+0.36 L h(-1)) (p<0.05). No difference between heat acclimation methods, and no further benefit of LTHA was observed (p>0.05). Only thermal sensation improved from baseline to STHA (-0.2), and then between STHA and LTHA (-0.5) (p<0.05). Both the continuous and progressive isothermic methods elicited exercise duration, mean session intensity, and mean T-rec analogous to more efficient administration for maximising adaptation. Short term isothermic methods are therefore optimal for individuals aiming to achieve heat adaptation most economically, i.e. when integrating heat acclimation into a pre-competition taper. Fixed methods may be optimal for military and occupational applications due to lower exercise intensity and simplified administration. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

article,A comparative study of thermal effects of 3 types of laser in eye: 3D simulation with bioheat equation,"Joukar, Amin and Nammakie, Erfan and Niroomand-Oscuii, Hanieh",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The application of laser in ophthalmology and eye surgery is so widespread that hardly can anyone deny its importance. On the other hand, since the human eye is an organ susceptible to external factors such as heat waves, laser radiation rapidly increases the temperature of the eye and therefore the study of temperature distribution inside the eye under laser irradiation is crucial; but the use of experimental and invasive methods for measuring the temperature inside the eye is typically high-risk and hazardous. In this paper, using the three-dimensional finite element method, the distribution of heat transfer inside the eye under transient condition was studied through three different lasers named Nd:Yag, Nd:Yap and ArF. Considering the metabolic heat and blood perfusion rate in various regions of the eye, numerical solution of space-time dependant Pennes bioheat transfer equation has been applied in this study. Lambert-Beer's law has been used to model the absorption of laser energy inside the eye tissues. It should also be mentioned that the effect of the ambient temperature, tear evaporation rate, laser power and the pupil diameter on the temperature distribution have been studied. Also, temperature distribution inside the eye after applying each laser and temperature variations of six optional regions as functions of time have been investigated. The results show that these radiations cause temperature rise in various regions, which will in turn causes serious damages to the eye tissues. Investigating the temperature distribution inside the eye under the laser irradiation can be a useful tool to study and predict the thermal effects of laser radiation on the human eye and evaluate the risk involved in performing laser surgery.

Two major public health problems of the human population involving energy balance (i.e. middle-aged obesity and aging cachexia) also appear in other mammals, therefore age-related regulatory alterations may also be assumed in the background. Previous studies demonstrated characteristic age-related shifts in the anorexigenic effects of centrally applied alpha-MSH with strong effects in young adult, diminished efficacy in middle-aged and very pronounced responsiveness in old rats. The present study aimed to investigate age-related changes in the acute central thermoregulatory responsiveness to an alpha-MSH injection in rats and to compare them with those of food intake-related responsiveness. Oxygen consumption (VO2), core (Tc) and tail skin temperatures (Ts, indicating heat loss) of male Wistar rats of different age groups (from 2 to 24 months of age), were recorded in an indirect calorimeter complemented by thermocouples upon intracerebroventricular alpha-MSH administration (0, 5 mu g) at a slightly subthermoneutral environment (25-26 degrees C). Acute alpha-MSH-induced rises in VO2 and Tc were most pronounced in the young adult age-group. In these rats the hyperthemic effects were somewhat diminished by an activation of heat loss. juvenile animals showed weaker hyperthermic responses, middle-aged rats none at all. Alpha-MSH-induced hyperthermia became significant again in old rats. Acute thermoregulatory (hypermetabolic/hyperthermic) responsiveness to alpha-MSH shows a distinct age-related pattern similar to that of acute anorexigenic responsiveness. Thus, our results may also contribute to the explanation of both middle-aged obesity and aging cachexia. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Effect of tissue and atmosphere's parameters on human eye temperature distribution,"Firoozan, Mohammad Sadegh and Porkhial, Soheil and Nejad, Ali Salmani",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"A three dimensional finite element method analysis was employed to investigate the effect of tissue and atmosphere parameters namely, ambient temperature, ambient convection coefficient, local blood temperature, and blood convection coefficient upon temperature distribution of human eyes. As a matter of simplification, only eye ball and skull bone are considered as the system of eye modeling. Decreasing the local blood temperature and keeping it cool is one of the most important ways to control bleeding during surgeries. By lower temperature of body organs such as the eye, the need for oxygenated blood is reduced, allowing for an extension in time for surgery. With this in mind, this study is done to see which one of parameters, such as ambient temperature, ambient convection coefficient, local blood temperature, and blood convection coefficient, has an effective role in decreasing the temperature of the eye. To this end, 3 different paths were employed to find out about the temperature distribution through the eye. The analysis of the three paths demonstrates the interaction of ambient and blood temperature in modeling temperature changes in specific locations of the eye. These data will be important in applications such as eye surgery, relaxation, and sleep therapy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J. and Berry, O. and Whiting, S. and Meekan, M. and Mitchell, N. J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The survival and viability of sea turtle embryos is dependent upon favourable nest temperatures throughout the incubation period. Consequently, future generations of sea turtles may be at risk from increasing nest temperatures due to climate change, but little is known about how embryos respond to heat stress. Heat shock genes are likely to be important in this process because they code for proteins that prevent cellular damage in response to environmental stressors. This study provides the first evidence of an expression response in the heat shock genes of embryos of loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) exposed to realistic and near-lethal temperatures (34 degrees C and 36 degrees C) for I or 3 hours. We investigated changes in Heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60), Hsp70, and Hsp90 mRNA in heart (n=24) and brain tissue (n=29) in response to heat stress. Under the most extreme treatment (36 degrees C, 3 h), Hsp70 increased mRNA expression by a factor of 38.8 in heart tissue and 15.7 in brain tissue, while Hsp90 mRNA expression increased by a factor of 98.3 in heart tissue and 14.7 in brain tissue. Hence, both Hsp70 and Hsp90 are useful biomarkers for assessing heat stress in the late-stage embryos of sea turtles. The method we developed can be used as a platform for future studies on variation in the thermotolerance response from the clutch to population scale, and can help us anticipate the resilience of reptile embryos to extreme heating events.

Predictable rhythmic changes in the physical environment are arguably among the most important forces shaping the evolution of behavior and physiology of animals, and to anticipate and prepare for these predictable changes, animals have evolved biological clocks. Unpredictable changes in the physical environment have important impacts on animal biology as well. The ability of animals to cope with and survive unpredictable perturbations depends on phenotypic plasticity and/or microevolution. From the time metazoans first evolved from their protistan ancestors they have lived in close association with a diverse array of microbes that have influenced, in some way, all aspects of the evolution of animal structure, function and behavior. Yet, few studies have addressed whether daily or seasonal rhythms may affect, or be affected by, an animal's microbial symbionts. This survey highlights how biologists interested in the ecological and evolutionary physiology of animals whose lifestyles are influenced by environmental cycles may benefit from considering whether symbiotic microbes have shaped the features they study.

article,Polysaccharide peptide induces a tumor necrosis factor-α-dependent drop of body temperature in rats,"Jedrzejewski, Tomasz and Piotrowski, Jakub and Wrotek, Sylwia and Kozak, Wieslaw",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Polysaccharide peptide (PSP) extracted from the Coriolus versicolor mushroom is frequently suggested as an adjunct to the chemo- or radiotherapy in cancer patients. It improves quality of the patients' life by decreasing pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting. However, the effect of PSP on body temperature has not thus far been studied, although it is well known that treatment with other polysaccharide adjuvants, such as lipopolysaccharides, may induce fever. The aim of the present study, therefore, was to investigate the influence of PSP on temperature regulation in rats. We report that intraperitoneal injection of PSP provoked a dose-dependent decrease of temperature in male Wistar rats equipped with biotelemetry devices to monitor deep body temperature (T-b). The response was rapid (i.e., with latency of 15-20 min), transient (lasting up to 5 h post-injection), and accompanied by a significant elevation of the blood tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) level. Pretreatment of the rats with anti-TNF-alpha antibody prevented the PSP-induced drop in T-b. Based on these data, we conclude that rats may develop an anapyrexia-like response to the injection of peptidopolysaccharide rather than fever, and the response was TNF-alpha-dependent.

article,"Trade-off between thermal sensitivity, hypoxia tolerance and growth in fish","Roze, Thomas and Christen, Felix and Amerand, Aline and Claireaux, Guy",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"One outcome of contemporary climate trends is that the involvement of hypoxia and heat tolerance in determining individual fitness will increase in many fish populations. Large fish are believed to be more tolerant to hypoxia than small fish (Nilsson and Ostlund-Nilsson, 2008) whereas thermal sensitivity is thought to decrease with body size (Clark et al., 2008). To better understand the bases of inter-individual variation in environmental adaptation performance, the current study examined hypoxia and heat tolerance in a fast growing (FGS; 288.3 +/- 14.4 g, 26.04 +/- 0.49 cm) and a slow growing (SGS; 119.95 +/- 6.41 g; 20.98 +/- 0.41 cm) strain of 1-year old rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). This examination was conducted using two standardized challenge tests aimed at assessing individual incipient lethal oxygen saturation and incipient upper lethal temperature. Results to these tests were then cross-correlated with swim tests during which individual basal and active metabolic rate values were also measured. Measurements of permeabilized ventricular myofibers oxygen consumption were also conducted, as well as various organ-to-body-mass ratios. Experimental data showed that FGS was more hypoxia tolerant than SGS (13.4 to 16.7\% air sat versus 14.7 to 18.9\% air sat respectively). On the other hand, FGS was found less tolerant to heat than SGS (24.7-27.6 degrees C versus 28.5 to 29.7 degrees C respectively). Adding to the body size effect, another source of inter-individual variation in environmental tolerance was found. Residual analysis highlighted that whereas none of the individual morphometric and energetic traits correlated with hypoxia tolerance, permeabilized ventricular myofibers maximal oxygen consumption correlated well with individual tolerance to heat.

AQP1, AQP3 and AQP5 are isoforms of aquaporin known to aid in transepithelial water movement. AQP3 is also known to aid in glycerol transport. The present study was conducted to investigate the role of AQP1, AQP3 and AQP5 in thermoregulation of buffaloes by probing the expression of the genes in skin of buffaloes during different season viz. winter, spring and summer. The skin tissue samples were collected from the neck region of Murrah buffaloes (n = 12) and analyzed for gene expression by RT-PCR and immunolocalization. The physiological responses including respiration rate, rectal temperature and neck skin temperature observed during summer were significantly higher than winter and spring seasons. The study revealed the expression of AQP1, AQP3 and AQP5 genes in skin samples. The relative mRNA expressions of AQP1, AQP3 and AQP5 in skin relative to spring season were 1.41 +/- 0.47, 1.95 +/- 0.22 and 6.77 +/- 1.02 folds during summer which were significantly higher than other seasons. The up-regulation of the expression of the studied AQPs were concomitant with the increase in physiological responses including skin temperature and sweating rate during summer. During summer season, AQP1 were mostly immunolocalized in the walls of skin blood capillaries, while AQP3 were observed mostly in the epidermal layer of the skin.

The basic developmental data and precise age estimates of the pupae are significant for PMImin estimation in forensic investigations. In the present study, we investigated the development data of that species at seven constant temperatures varying from 16 degrees C to 34 degrees C, including body length changes of the larve, developmental duration and accumulated degree hours of the preadults. Several reference genes for relative quantification of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were firstly selected and evaluated in the pupae of different ages under different temperatures. The DEGs of the insects during the pupal period at different constant temperatures (34, 25 and 16 degrees C) were further analyzed for more precise age estimation. The results showed that the developmental durations of the preadults at 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31 and 34 degrees C were 1478.6 +/- 18.3 h, 726.1 +/- 15.8 h, 538.5 +/- 0.9 h, 394.1 +/- 9.5 h, 375.6 +/- 10.8 h, 284.1 +/- 7.3 h, and 252.5 +/- 6.1 h, respectively. The developmental threshold temperature the flies was 12.27 +/- 0.35 degrees C, and the thermal summation constant was 5341.71 +/- 249.29 degrees hours. The most reliable reference genes during the pupal period at different temperatures were found: GST1 and 18S rRNA for the 34 degrees C group, GST1 and RPL49 for 25 degrees C, and 18S rRNA and 28S rRNA for 16 degrees C. The four differential expression genes (Hsp60, A-alpha, ARP, and RPL8) have the potential to be used for more precise age estimation of pupal S. dux.

article,Differences in heat tolerance plasticity between supratidal and intertidal snails indicate complex responses to microhabitat temperature variation,"Brahim, Amalina and Marshall, David J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Tropical intertidal gastropods that experience extreme and highly variable daily temperatures have evolved significant and complex heat tolerance plasticity, comprising components that respond to different timescales of temperature variation. An earlier study showed different plasticity attributes in snails from differently-heated coastlines, suggesting lifelong irreversible responses that matched habitat thermal regimes. To determine whether heat tolerance plasticity varied at a finer, within-shore spatial scale, we compared the responses of supratidal (predominantly shade-dwelling) and intertidal (frequently solar-exposed) populations of the tropical thermophilic gastropod, Echinolittorina malaccana. Snails modified lethal temperature (LT50) under warm or cool laboratory acclimation, with the overall variation in LT 50 being greater in the supratidal (56.0-58.0 degrees C) than in the intertidal population (57.1-58.1 degrees C). Similar maximum LT(50)s expressed by the populations after warm acclimation suggest a capacity limitation under these temperature conditons. The different minimum LT(50)s after cool acclimation corresponded with microhabitat temperature and field acclimatization of the snails. Different responses to the same laboratory acclimation treatment imply long-term (and possibly lifelong) thermal acclimatization, which could benefit sedentary organisms that are randomly recruited as larvae from a common thermally-stable aquatic environment to thermally-unpredictable intertidal microhabitats. These findings provide another example of thermal tolerance plasticity operating at microhabitat scales, suggesting the importance of considering microhabitat thermal responses when assessing broad-scale environmental change.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102620,91,NA,NA,102620,Thermal acclimation; Echinolittorina malaccana; Habitat heterogeneity; Heat tolerance; Intertida
article,Numerical investigations of temperature and hemodynamics in carotid arteries with and without atherosclerotic plaque during open surgery,"Zhang, Xuelan and Zheng, Liancun and Wang, Erhui and Shu, Chang",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Intraoperative monitoring is essential for providing safe and effective care during open surgery. In this paper, numerical simulation is performed to track the flow and heat transfer of carotid arteries with and without atherosclerotic plaque in a real physiological system during surgery, in which the heat transport is first considered to couple to the blood flow due to the temperature dependence of the blood viscosity. The impacts of the operating room temperature and hematocrit (H) on the viscosity, velocity, temperature, wall shear stress (WSS), pressure drop and oscillation are investigated. The results demonstrate that the presence of plaque in the carotid artery induces a greater blood flow velocity, pressure drop, WSS, and oscillation, as well as a smaller viscosity and temperature variations. A decreasing ambient temperature leads to a decrease in the temperature and an increase in the low-WSS area, which implies a greater risk of hypothermia and atherosclerosis. As H increases, the high-WSS areas substantially expand; when H varies from 65\% to 80\%, WSSave increases by 70.02\% and 68.57\% for the arteries with and without plaque, respectively, which indicates a higher risk of vascular injury.

The constant weight method often makes the evaluation results deviating from reality. In this paper, the variable weight theory is adopted to solve above problem. Firstly, a human physiological state evaluation system is proposed. Secondly, the constant weight and variable weight methods are used to obtain the weights of the indexes. Thus, the comprehensive evaluation score is obtained to quantify the human physiological state. Finally, a case study is conducted to demonstrate and verify the proposed evaluation system. It indicates that, the variable weight of rectal temperature, skin temperature, systolic pressure and heart rate is 0.2 similar to 0.77, 0.11 similar to 0.61, 0.03 similar to 0.31, 0.03 similar to 0.31, respectively. And the weights of the skin temperature and the rectal temperature account for a relatively large proportion, ranging from 50\% to 92\%. The physiological parameters with small constant weight may account for a larger percentage in the evaluation when the physiological parameters reach an extremely harmful condition.

The experimental design was 3 x 3 factorial, in which three levels (0.15, 0.20, and 0.25 ppm) and three sources (inorganic, green nano, and market nano) of Se resulted in nine treatments viz. IS-0.15, GNS-0.15, MNS-0.15, IZ-0.20, GNS-0.20, MNS-0.20, IS-0.25, GNS-0.25, and MNS-0.25 (IS: inorganic Se, GNS: green nano Se, MNS: market nano Se). A total of 432 broiler chicken were divided among nine treatments with six replicates of birds per treatment (8 birds/replicate). Results of present study revealed significantly better growth performance of birds supplemented with 0.25 ppm nano Se. The supplementation of 0.25 ppm nano Se improved the immune response and lymphoid organ development of birds. Significantly higher Se and nitrogen digestibility coefficients, serum antioxidant activity and decline of Heterophil: Lymphocyte ratio and expression of HSP70 gene were observed in birds supplemented with 0.25 ppm Se and nano source of Se compared to inorganic Se. Significantly higher Se concentration in liver and breast muscle and higher serum Se concentration were observed in birds fed 0.25 ppm nano Se. The liver Se concentration was much higher than that of breast muscle. However, the nano Se synthesized by green method in this study did not differ significantly from the chemically synthesized nano Se.

This study compared surface temperature distribution of burning moxa stick with and without ash cleaning. The experimental of moxibustion treatment on in-vitro tissue and human abdomen were conducted and corresponding numerical models were developed. The effect of ACDA on thermal performance of biological tissue under moxibustion therapy were analyzed. The results show that the surface temperature of burning moxa stick with ash cleaning maintained at a higher range compared to that without ash cleaning. During moxibustion with ACDA process in in-vitro tissue experiment, the temperature increase (Delta T) at skin surface almost fluctuated in the same temperature range, and the Delta T in subcutaneous tissue (> 11 mm) kept increasing. Relatively, these Delta T under moxibustion treatment without ACDA showed different trends and these values were all much smaller than those with ACDA. In addition, the position of maximum temperature of tissue under moxibustion with and without ACDA was fixed on treatment acupoint and moved away from treatment acupoint, respectively. Besides, the surface temperature of human abdomen tissue under moxibustion treatment with ACDA can be maintained at 46 degrees C-50 degrees C for a longer time compared to that under moxbustion without ACDA. In conclusion, moxibustion with ACDA can create a larger and more durable thermal effect on biological tissue.

A 44-week experiment was performed with four wild males and 12 wild females that had been acclimatized to captive conditions. Water temperature was maintained at 24.4 +/- 1.0 degrees C for weeks 1-22, and then at 29.0 +/- 1.1 degrees C for weeks 22-44. Spawn weight, number of eggs/spawn and hatching rate were satisfactory and ranged 27.5-127.5 g, 1209-5183 and 83-89\%, respectively. Hematocrit, leukocytes and glucose were not influenced by increased water temperature, while higher values for erythrocytes were observed for both sexes. The lowest value for plasma protein was for females maintained at 29.0 degrees C, while the lowest value for testosterone was obtained at the end of the study period at a temperature in 29.0 degrees C. Serum values of 17 beta-estradiol were higher in females than in males, however, there was no evidence of variation as a function of experimental temperature or interaction with sex. The reproductive behavior of L. alexandri in captivity is described for the first time. The present study demonstrates that adult individuals are able to maintain a stable hematological profile during an increase in mean water temperature from 24.4 degrees C to 29.0 degrees C, even during the reproductive period, and still produce good quality larvae.

For this milk samples were collected from cows in winter (THI = 57, comfortable zone), hot-dry (HD; THI = 76, heat stressful zone) and hot-humid (HH; THI = 82, severe heat stress) and estimated for milk somatic cell counts (SCC), phagocytic activity (PA) of milk neutrophils, milk cortisol and heat shock proteins and function associated genes in milk neutrophils. Milk SCC was evaluated using a cell counter and differential cell counts measured microscopically. Cortisol was quantified in skimmed milk by competitive ELISA. Milk PA was estimated using nitro blue tetrazolium assay, and for gene expression studies, milk neutrophils were isolated and studied for heat shock proteins (HSP40, HSP70, HSP90 alpha) and cell adhesion molecules (CD11b, CD25, CD44) using real-time polymerase chain reaction. All the studied parameters increased in HD and HH seasons with highest values observed in Sahiwal cows. However, PA of neutrophil was highest in Tharparkar cows in winter and decreased gradually at higher THI values during hot seasons. Milk cortisol was positively correlated with expression of various CD molecules and HSPs (p < 0.05) in milk neutrophils but negatively correlated (p < 0.05) with PA during HH season in all breeds. The study revealed that Indian native cows were at considerable risk in HH season and Sahiwal cows were more heat stressed followed by Gir and Tharparkar cows, respectively, and thus may require managemental interventions. Also, the higher expression of HSP70 and CD25 with increasing THI levels in hot seasons makes them suitable biological markers for quantifying heat stress.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.08.020,78,NA,27-35,NA,Tropics; Mammary gland; Milk neutrophil; Temperature humidity index; Heat shock protein; Adhesion molecule

F. and Sara, Gianluca and Williams, Gray A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Organisms can mitigate the effects of long term variation in environmental conditions through acclimation, which involves changes in various physiological responses. To elucidate the possible effects of temperature and food concentrations on acclimation capacity, physiological responses of the mussel, Perna viridis, were measured after individuals were held for six weeks under varying temperatures and food availability. Warm-acclimated mussels experiencing higher food levels had significantly greater upper thermal limits than those maintained on lower food levels. In contrast, the upper thermal limits of cold-acclimated mussels were not affected by food levels. For warm-acclimated mussels, differences in upper thermal limits were likely due to rapid depletion of energy storage as predicted by Dynamic Energy Budget model simulations for P. viridis exposed to lower food levels. Clearance rates of cold-acclimated mussels were significantly lower than warm-acclimated mussels, regardless of food availability. The impacts of lower food acquisition on energy storage, however, could be compensated by lower metabolic rates of the cold-acclimated mussels. The availability and the ability to acquire food are not, therefore, the main drivers differentiating between the upper thermal tolerances of cold- and warm-acclimated mussels, but these differences are driven by the past thermal history the mussels experienced. The temperature tolerance range of P. viridis showed a positive shift to tolerate higher temperatures after acclimation. Such flexibility in thermal tolerance implies P. viridis has high capacity to acclimate to novel environments, which will enhance its future success given its commercial importance as an aquaculture species.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.10.014,78,NA,270-276,NA,Acclimation temperature; Food availability; Physiological responses; Clearance rate; Acclimation capacity

The thermal conductivity of twenty bovine trabecular bone samples was measured prior to and after defatting at 37, 47, and 57 degrees C. Computer models were built including the microstructure geometry and the gap between the tissue and measurement probe. The thermal conductivity (k) measured was 0.39 +/- 0.06 W m(-1) K-1 at 37 degrees C, with a temperature dependence of + 0.2\%degrees C-1. Replacing marrow by phosphate-buffered saline (defatting) increased both the computer simulations and measurement results by 0.04 W m(-1) K-1. The computer simulations showed that k increases by 0.02-0.04 W m(-1) K-1 when the model includes a gap filled by phosphate-buffered saline between the tissue and measurement probe. In the presence of microstructure and fatty red marrow, k varies by +/- 0.01 W m(-1) K-1 compared with the case considering matrix only, which suggests that there are no significant differences between cortical and trabecular bone in terms of k. The computer results showed that the presence of a gap filled by phosphate-buffered saline around the energy applicator changes maximum temperature by < 0.7 degrees C, while including the bone microstructure involved a variation of < 0.2 mm in the isotherm location.

In this study, global protein expression in the hypothalami of layer-type Taiwan country chickens in response to acute heat stress was investigated. Twelve 30-week-old female TCCs were divided into three acute heat-stressed groups, namely acute heat stress at 36 degrees C for 4 h with 0 h (without recovery, H4R0), 2 h (H4R2), or 6 h (H4R6) of recovery. A control group was maintained at 25 degrees C. Hypothalamus samples were collected at the end of each time point for proteomic analysis. The analysis results revealed that 134 protein spots representing 118 distinct proteins exhibited differential expressions after acute heat stress treatment. Results of gene ontology analysis showed that most of the differentially expressed proteins are involved in carbohydrate metabolism, cellular processes, actin cytoskeleton organization, and responses to stimuli. Functional pathway analysis results suggested that the proteins are associated with networks of carbon metabolism, glycolysis, and gluconeogenesis. Upregulation of the expression of triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate kinase, pyruvate kinase, alpha-enolase, glycogen phosphorylase (brain form), phosphoglucomutase, L-lactate dehydrogenase A chain and downregulation of 6-phosphogluconolactonase expression indicated an increase in the glycolytic activity and glucose supply for ATP production in the hypothalami in response to heat stress. By contrast, upregulated expressions of heat shock protein 90 alpha, glutathione S-transferase 2s, peroxiredoxin-1, and dihydropyrimidinase-like 2 suggested that acute heat stress adversely affects the hypothalamus; thus, it induces mechanisms that prevent oxidative damage and endoplasmic reticulum stress.

article,"Thermal acclimation is not induced by habitat-of-origin, maintenance temperature, or acute exposure to low or high temperatures in a pit-building wormlion (<i>Vermileo</i> sp.)","Bar-Ziv, Michael A. and Scharf, Inon",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Wormlions are sit-and-wait insect predators that construct pit-traps to capture arthropod prey. They require loose soil and shelter from direct sun, both common in Mediterranean cities, and explaining their high abundance in urban habitats. We studied different aspects of thermal acclimation in wormlions. We compared chill-coma recovery time (CCRT) and heat-shock recovery time (HSRT) of wormlions from urban, semi-urban and natural habitats, expecting those originating from the urban habitat to be more heat tolerant and less cold tolerant. However, no differences were detected among the three habitats. We then examined whether maintenance temperature affects CCRT and HSRT, and expected beneficial acclimation. However, CCRT was unaffected by maintenance temperature, while temperature affected HSRT in an opposite direction to our prediction: wormlions maintained under the higher temperatures took longer to recover. When testing with two successive thermal shocks, wormlions took longer to recover from both cold and heat shock after applying an initial cold shock. We therefore conclude that cold shock inflicts some damage rather than induces acclimation. Finally, both cold- and heat-shocked wormlions constructed smaller pits than wormlions of a control group. Smaller pits probably translate to a lower likelihood of capturing prey and also limit the size of the prey, indicating a concrete cost of thermal shock. In summary, we found no evidence for thermal acclimation related either to the habitat-of-origin or to maintenance temperatures, but, rather, negative effects of unfavorable temperatures.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.03.024,74,NA,181-186,NA,Antlion; Chill-coma recovery time; Trap-building predator; Urban ecology; Wormlion

We hypothesized that 2, 4, and 6 h of hyperthermia would increase apoptosis and autophagy in oxidative skeletal muscle compared to thermoneutral (TN) conditions. Pigs were assigned to four groups (n = 8/group) and exposed to environmental heat stress (37 degrees C) for 0, 2, 4, or 6 h. Immediately following environmental exposure animals were euthanized and the red portion of the semitendinosus was collected. Markers of apoptotic signaling were increased following 2 h of heating but returned to baseline thereafter, while caspase 3 activity remained elevated 2-3 fold (p < .05) throughout the hyperthermic period. Heat stress increased (p < .05) markers of autophagic activation, and nucleation as well as autophagosome formation and degradation linearly throughout the heating intervention.

Extreme temperatures (12 and 32 degrees C) significantly increased mortality of embryos (to 100\%) and nymphs II, whereas larvae and nymphs I suffered reduced survival only at the lowest temperature. Moreover, the lowest temperature reduced the development rate of all stages. The impact of light conditions was less pronounced and more variable: constant light reduced the survival of nymphs I at lower temperatures, but increased that of larvae. Moreover, light increased the time of embryonic development and duration of nymphal stages, particularly at lower temperatures (12-22 degrees C).

Charles",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Avian nests provide a location for incubation, and in many cases rearing of nestlings. These energetically demanding activities have meant that nest insulation has been the subject of many studies but few to date have dealt with how variation among species in nest construction materials could affect nest insulation. This study investigated the insulation of nests constructed by three species of Old Word warblers (Sylviidae), which vary in size and composition. Insulatory values, i.e. difference in cooling rate of temperature loggers placed inside and outside a nest, and internal cooling rates within the nest cup were determined using temperature loggers under still-air and moving-air conditions. Insulatory values determined in still-air conditions of a laboratory were significantly different among nests of the different species but not when the values were determined within the smaller volume of a wind tunnel. Moving-air increased insulatory values by an order of magnitude but also increased internal cooling rates in all species. Insulatory values were positively correlated with the nest base thickness. Moving-air increased the cooling rate of the external temperature logger much more than the internal logger, which inflated the insulatory value of a nest wall in moving-air. Reasons for these results may reflect the thermal properties of the materials individually or in combination. Future testing of nest insulation should be under standard conditions that limit air movement but the role of the nest location in situ should be investigated in future research.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.03.003,81,NA,194-200,NA,Air movement; Eurasian Blackcap; Eurasian Reed Warbler; Insulatory value; Nest construction; Willow Warbler
article,Faster physical performance recovery with cold water immersion is not related to lower muscle damage level in professional soccer players,"Bouzid, Mohamed Amine and Ghattassi, Kais and Daab, Wael and Zarzissi, Slim and Bouchiba, Mustapha and Masmoudi, Liwa and Chtourou, Hamdi",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of cold water immersion (CWI) after an intermittent test on the recovery kinetic of physical performance, muscle damage and perceived muscle soreness in professionals soccer players. In a randomized design, eight soccer players completed the Loughborough Intermittent Shuttle Test followed by 10 min of either CWI (10C degrees) or thermoneutral water immersion (TWI) (28C degrees). Physical performance (Squat jump: SJ, countermovement jump: CMJ, maximal voluntary contraction: MVC, and 20 m sprint: SP), muscle damage parameter (creatine kinase: CK) and perceived muscle soreness were assessed at baseline, 0 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h after the intermittent test. After the test, a decrease was observed in SJ and in CMJ at 0 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h with TWI (p < 0.05) and only at 0 h for SJ with CWI (p < 0.05). SP decreased at 24 h and 48 h after the test with TWI (p < 0.05) and only at 24 h with CWI (p < 0.05). MVC, CK activity and perceived muscle soreness increased in both condition after the test and returned to baseline levels 72 h after the test with TWI (p < 0.05) and at 48 h with CWI (p < 0.05). For the correlation between physical performance and muscle damage parameters in CWI session, the statistical analysis didn't reveal any significant link between CK and SJ, CMJ, MVC or SP values (p > 0.05). The results suggest that CWI immediately after an intermittent test reduces muscle damage and perceived muscle soreness, and accelerate recovery of physical performance in professional soccer players. However, the faster recovery of physical performance seems not be related to the lower level of muscle damage induced by CWI.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.10.001,78,NA,184-191,NA,Creatine kinase; Exercise performance; Cryotherapy; Team sport; Muscle damage

We evaluated the effect of heat stress on developmental stability, the age at onset of foraging (AOF) and longevity in Africanized honey bees (AHBs) in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, one of the main honey producing areas in the Neotropics, where high temperatures occur in spring and summer. To do so, we reared worker AHB pupae under a fluctuating temperature regime, simulating current tropical heatwaves, with a high temperature peak of 40.0 degrees C for 1 h daily across six days, and compared them to control pupae reared at stable temperatures of 34.0-35.5 degrees C. Heat stress did not markedly affect overall body size, though the forewing of heat-stressed bees was slightly shorter than controls. However, bees reared under heat stress showed significantly greater fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in forewing shape. Heat stress also decreased AOF and reduced longevity.

article,Roles for lysine acetyltransferases during mammalian hibernation,"Rouble, Andrew N. and Hawkins, Liam J. and Storey, Kenneth B.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The thirteen-lined ground squirrel (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) is a well-known model for studying hibernation. While in a torpid state, these animals globally suppress energy expensive processes, while supporting specialized pathways necessary for survival. Lysine acetyltransferases (KATs) play a crucial role in modulating the expression and activity of a wide-variety of cellular pathways and processes, and therefore, may play a role during hibernation when the cell is shifting to an energy conservative, cytoprotective state. Here we measured protein levels of four KATs (CBP, PCAF, GCN5L2, HAT1), total histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, and the levels of acetylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9ac), in multiple tissues across the torpor-arousal cycle. Our results show a tissue-specific response of KATs, particularly in the adipose tissues where specific KATs (PCAF and GCN5L2), HAT activity, and H3K9ac increased in the metabolically active BAT while HAT1, HAT activity and H3K9ac decreased in WAT. Liver showed significant increases in the KAT PCAF whereas skeletal muscle had decreased CBP and GCN5L2. Both liver and skeletal muscle showed no change in HAT activity and H3K9me3 increased in muscle during torpor. Together, these results suggest KATs may play specialized roles in the different tissues of the ground squirrel to contribute to the hibernator phenotype.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.03.013,74,NA,71-76,NA,Hibernation; Acetyltransferases; Skeletal muscle; Liver; Adipose tissue
article,"Combined effects of temperature and interspecific competition on the mortality of the invasive garden ant, <i>Lasius neglectus</i>: A laboratory study","Frizzi, Filippo and Bartalesi, Viola and Santini, Giacomo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The invasive garden ant, Lasius neglectus, is a dominant species due to its capacity to form large supercolonies. This species was assumed to possess a wide thermal niche since it is able to adapt to cold climates, which is a factor that boosted its rapid expansion from south to many central-northern European Countries. However, the effect of variations in environmental temperatures on its competitive ability against other species has still not been investigated. In this paper, we analyzed the change in survival ability of Lasius neglectus during encounters with two Mediterranean dominant ants (Crematogaster scutellaris and Tapinoma nigerrimum) at four different temperatures (15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C). Firstly, control tests were performed to provide the baseline survival ability of the three species at different temperatures. Secondly, competition tests were carried out at the same temperatures. Lasius neglectus survival was negatively affected by high temperature (30 degrees C) in control tests, and this impairment was much more pronounced in competition tests. On the contrary, the two opponent species were only marginally affected by temperatures in control tests. Crematogaster scutellaris was a better competitor than L. neglectus, particularly at high temperatures. Tapinoma nigerrimum was a weaker competitor and was always outcompeted by L. neglectus, particularly at low temperatures. This result could suggest that L. neglectus is at a disadvantage during interspecific encounters when temperatures are high and that the predicted future increase in environmental temperatures may potentially enhance this handicap.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.02.007,65,NA,76-81,NA,Formicidae; Invasive species; Temperature; Climate change
article,Pre-cooling with intermittent ice ingestion lowers the core temperature in a hot environment as compared with the ingestion of a single bolus,"Naito, Takashi and Ogaki, Tetsuro",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The timing in which ice is ingested may be important for optimizing its success. However, the effects of differences in the timing of ice ingestion has not been studied in resting participants. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of differences in the timing of ice ingestion on rectal temperature (Tre) and rating of perceptual sensation in a hot environment. Seven males ingested 1.25 g kg(-1) of crushed ice (ICE1.25: 0.5 degrees C) or cold water (CON: 4 degrees C) every 5 min for 30 min, or were given 7.5 g kgBM(-1) of crushed ice (ICE7.5) to consume for 30 min in a hot environment (35 degrees C, 30\% relative humidity). The participants then remained at rest for 1 h. As physiological indices, Tre, body mass and urine specific gravity were measured. Rating of thermal sensation was measured at 5-min intervals throughout the experiment. ICE1.25 continued to decrease Tre until approximately 50 min, and resulted in a greater reduction in Tre (-0.56 +/- 0.20 degrees C) than ICE7.5 (-0.41 +/- 0.14 degrees C). Tre was reduced from 40 to 75 min by ICE1.25, which is a significant reduction in comparison to ICE7.5 (p < .05). Mean RTS with ICE1.25 at 50-65 min was significantly lower than that with ICE7.5 (p < .05). These results suggest that pre-cooling with intermittent ice ingestion is a more effective strategy both for lowering the Tre and for the rating of thermal sensation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The extent of vulnerability to thermal changes depends on the lizard's physiological plasticity to adjust the environmental changes. Herein we studied the thermal biology of Anolis allisoni, an endemic arboreal lizard from the tropical islands of the Banco Chinchorro Biosphere Reserve, Mexico, carried out during April and May 2012 and April 2014. We report field body (T-b) and preferred body temperatures in the laboratory (T-pref), operative temperatures (T-e) and restriction of hours of activity. Anolis allisoni showed high and identical T-b and T-pref (33 degrees C), not significantly different than the mean T-e (32.15 degrees C). The effectiveness of thermoregulation (E = -0.30) and the analysis of hours of restriction suggested that the high temperatures of T-e (40-62.5 degrees C) registered at midday (from 12:00 to 15:00) of A. allisoni habitat are hostile and force lizards to take refuge during a period of 3 h of their daily time of activity. The scarcity of opportunities to find alternative refuges for thermoregulation in Banco Chinchorro point out the vulnerability of A. allisoni and the risk of local extinction when considering future predictions of increase in global environmental temperatures.

article,Novel approaches to the calculation and comparison of thermoregulatory parameters: Non-linear regression of metabolic rate and evaporative water loss in Australian rodents,"Tomlinson, Sean",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The calculation and comparison of physiological characteristics of thermoregulation has provided insight into patterns of ecology and evolution for over half a century. Thermoregulation has typically been explored using linear techniques; I explore the application of non-linear scaling to more accurately calculate and compare characteristics and thresholds of thermoregulation, including the basal metabolic rate (BMR), peak metabolic rate (PMR) and the lower (T-lc) and upper (T-uc) critical limits to the thermoneutral zone (TNZ) for Australian rodents. An exponentially-modified logistic function accurately characterised the response of metabolic rate to ambient temperature, while evaporative water loss was accurately characterised by a Michaelis-Menten function. When these functions were used to resolve unique parameters for the nine species studied here, the estimates of BMR and TNZ were consistent with the previously published estimates. The approach resolved differences in rates of metabolism and water loss between subfamilies of Australian rodents that haven't been quantified before. I suggest that nonlinear scaling is not only more effective than the established segmented linear techniques, but also is more objective. This approach may allow broader and more flexible comparison of characteristics of thermoregulation, but it needs testing with a broader array of taxa than those used here. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Optimal foraging behavior and the thermal neutral zone of <i>Peromyscus leucopus</i> during winter: A test using natural and controlled ambient temperatures,"St Juliana, Justin R. and Mitchell, William A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Endotherms foraging at temperatures outside of their thermal neutral zone (TNZ) pay an increased energetic cost. We asked if thermally-induced changes in foraging costs influence quitting harvest rate (QHR) of mice. We predicted that mice foraging during the winter would have a higher QHR in more costly colder conditions. We conducted our study with wild caught Peromyscus leucopus in an enclosure located in West Terre Haute, Indiana. We assayed changes in QHR using the forager's giving up density (GUD), which is the amount of uneaten seeds reaming in a tray after foraging activity. Each night from January 12th to March 13th, we assigned 4 trays as ``cold trays{''} (at ambient temperature), and 4 trays as ``hot trays{''} (trays with a ceramic heat element that increased the temperatures of feeding trays ca. 10-15 C). GUDs (and therfore QHRs) increased as a function of decreasing ambient temperature. Furthermore there was an interaction between tray temperature and ambient temperature; namely, on cool nights mice had lower GUDs in the ``hot trays{''}, but on warm nights mice had lower GUDs in the ``cold trays{''}. The TNZ for P. leucopus actively foraging during winter may be closer to the environmental average temperature than typically measured in the laboratory. Overall, these results support the idea that QHR is related to an animal's foraging in thermally challenged conditions. We present a unique way of measuring an animal's TNZ in the field using behavioral indicators.

article,Response of body size and developmental time of <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> to constant versus fluctuating thermal conditions,"Malek, D. and Drobniak, S. and Gozdek, A. and Pawlik, K. and Kramarz, P.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature has profound effects on biological functions at all levels of organization. In ectotherms, body size is usually negatively correlated with ambient temperature during development, a phenomenon known as The Temperature-Size Rule (TSR). However, a growing number of studies have indicated that temperature fluctuations have a large influence on life history traits and the implications of such fluctuations for the TSR are unknown. Our study investigated the effect of different constant and fluctuating temperatures on the body mass and development time of red flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum Herbst, 1797); we also examined whether the sexes differed in their responses to thermal conditions. We exposed the progeny of half-sib families of a T. castaneum laboratory strain to one of four temperature regimes: constant 30 degrees C, constant 25 degrees C, fluctuating with a daily mean of 30 degrees C, or fluctuating with a daily mean of 25 degrees C. Sex-specific development time and body mass at emergence were determined. Beetles developed the fastest and had the greatest body mass upon emergence when they were exposed to a constant temperature of 30 degrees C. This pattern was reversed when beetles experienced a constant temperature of 25 degrees C: slowest development and lowest body mass upon emergence were observed. Fluctuations changed those effects significantly - impact of temperature on development time was smaller, while differences in body mass disappeared completely. Our results do not fit TSR predictions. Furthermore, regardless of the temperature regime, females acquired more mass, while there were no differences between sexes in development time to eclosion. This finding fails to support one of the explanations for smaller male size: that selection favors the early emergence of males. We found no evidence of genotype x environment interactions for selected set of traits. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Transcriptional modulation of heat shock proteins and adipogenic regulators in bovine adipocytes following heat exposure,"Kim, Won Seob and Keng, Boon Hong and Kim, Jongkyoo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"This research endeavored to elucidate the transcriptional modulation of heat shock proteins and adipogenic regulators in bovine subcutaneous adipocytes following thermal exposure. Post -differentiation, mature adipocytes were subjected to three treatments of control (CON), moderate (MHS), and extreme (EHS) heat stress. These treatments consist of thermal conditions at temperatures of 38 degrees C (CON), 39.5 degrees C (MHS), or 41 degrees C (EHS) along with of 3 or 12 h. There was no statistically significant variations observed in the gene expressions of HSP27 and HSP70 when comparing CON with MHS across both exposures. Contrastingly, when comparing CON with EHS, an upregulation (P < 0.01) in HSP27 gene expression was evident for both 3 and 12 h of incubation, while HSP70 gene expression exhibited elevation (P < 0.01) at the 3-h mark, with no change observed at 12 h. Protein quantification, however, revealed an elevation (P < 0.01) in HSP27 and HSP70 for both CON vs. MHS and CON vs. EHS at the 12-h exposure. This trend in protein level mirrored (P < 0.05) that of proliferatoractivated receptor -gamma (PPAR gamma). Elevated (P < 0.05) protein levels of fatty acid synthase (FAS) were exclusively discernible in the CON vs. MHS. Increased (P < 0.01) transcriptional activity of PPAR gamma, CCAAT/ enhancer -binding protein alpha (C/EBP alpha), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), and FAS was evident in the CON vs. EHS comparison. Complementary to these molecular findings, an augmented lipid droplet accumulation was observed (P < 0.01) in EHS-exposed adipocytes progressively from day 6 through day 9. Our current study highlights how different levels and lengths of heat stress can impact the activity of important heat -related proteins and factors that play a role in fat development in beef cattle.

To address this gap in knowledge, this study aimed to enhance the prediction of human heat sensation for pilot reserves while operating in extremely hot cabins with decompression. To achieve this, an improved Predicted Heat Strain (PHS) model was developed by incorporating the influence of air pressure on metabolic rate. The model's validity was assessed through experiments conducted at different altitudes (0m, 5000m, and 8000m) and varying environmental conditions (26 degrees C and 45 degrees C, 10\% RH and 40\% RH) within an environmental simulation cabin. During these experiments, local skin temperature, core temperature, heart rate, and blood oxygen saturation were measured. The findings revealed distinct variations in the skin temperature of the hand and foot segments across different experimental stages, and significant correlations were observed between heart rate, core temperature, and local skin temperatures. Furthermore, regression models were established to explore the relationship between heart rate and local skin temperatures. By comparing simulated and experimental core and local skin temperatures, the enhanced PHS model was successfully validated.

We hypothesized that spatial summation would exist within a limited area and the effect would be insignificant for over the 1\%BSA. Fifteen young males participated in this study and we measured their warmth and hot sensation thresholds on the four body regions (the forehead, forearm, abdomen, and instep) using the three sizes of radiant film heaters (10 x 10, 15 x 15, and 20 x 20 cm(2) heating film area). The heating panel was kept at a distance of 10 cm from the skin and the surface temperature of the heating panel increased by 1 degrees C center dot s(-1). The results showed that warmth and hot sensation thresholds were higher for the 100 cm(2) condition than the 225 or 400 cm2 conditions (P < 0.05), but no differences were found between the 225 and 400 cm(2) conditions. Secondly, the instep was most insensitive to the gradual increase of radiant heat among the four body regions for all three stimulating film sizes, even though the hot threshold was lowest for the instep because the initial foot temperature was lower than other skin temperatures. In summary, spatial summation in thermal sensitivity was found for the 100 and 225 cm(-2) conditions, but not for the 225 and 400 cm(2) conditions.

Current thermal comfort researches mainly focused on skin temperature, while other kinds of body temperatures were often ignored. In laboratory with strictly controlled environment, 26 subjects (13 males and 13 females) remained seated for a duration of 130 min in two thermal environments (19 degrees C and 35 degrees C), arranged in a particular order; four kinds of body temperatures (skin temperature, oral temperature, auditory canal temperature and breath temperature) and three kinds of thermal perception votes (thermal sensation, thermal comfort and thermal acceptable) were regularly collected. The analysis results showed that, skin temperature and breath temperature significantly changed with ambient temperature (p < 0.001); the difference between average value of core temperature in two conditions was small (<= 0.3 degrees C), but a significant difference was almost observed in auditory canal temperature of males (p = 0.07). Both skin temperature and breath temperature were significantly related with three subjective votes (p < 0.001), meanwhile, the prediction accuracy of breath temperature for thermal perception was in no way inferior to skin temperature. Although oral temperature and auditory canal temperature had partial significant correlations with thermal perception, they were difficult to be carried out in practical application due to their weak explanatory powers (correlation coefficient <0.3). In summary, this research tried to establish correlation laws between body temperatures and thermal perception votes during a temperature step-change experiment, while finding the potential of utilizing breath temperature for thermal perception prediction, which is expected to be further promoted in the future.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103600,114,NA,NA,103600,Thermal perception; Body temperature; Core temperature; Explanatory power; Prediction accuracy

Under recent climate change, rather than strictly relaxing pressure on overwintering survival, warmer winters can instead disrupt these low-temperature trait-environment associations, with negative consequences for populations. While there is increasing evidence of physiological adaptation to contemporary warming during the growing season, the effects of winter warming on physiological traits are less clear. To address this knowledge gap, we performed a common garden experiment using relatively warmadapted versus cold-adapted populations of the acorn ant, Temnothorax curvispinosus, sampled across an urban heat island gradient, to explore the effects of winter conditions on plasticity and evolution of physiological traits. We found no evidence of evolutionary divergence in chill coma recovery nor in metabolic rate at either of two test temperatures (4 and 10 degrees C). Although we found the expected plastic response of increased metabolic rate under the 10 degrees C acute test temperature as compared with the 4 degrees C test temperature, this plastic response, (i.e., the acute thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate), was not different across populations. Surprisingly, we found that winter-acclimated urban ant populations exhibited higher heat tolerance compared with rural ant populations, and that the magnitude of divergence was comparable to that observed among growing-season acclimated ants. Finally, we found no evidence of differences between populations with respect to changes in colony size from the beginning to the end of the overwintering experiment. Together, these findings indicate that despite the evolution of higher heat tolerance that is often accompanied by losses in low-temperature tolerance, urban acorn ants have retained several components of low-temperature physiological performance when assessed under ecologically relevant overwintering conditions. Our study suggests the importance of measuring physiological traits under seasonally-relevant conditions to understand the causes and consequences of evolutionary responses to contemporary warming.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103591,114,NA,NA,103591,Cold tolerance; Heat tolerance; Urban heat island; Contemporary evolution

Cardiac cells accomplished 70-75\% confluence after 72 h of incubation. Confluent cardiac cells were exposed to heat stress at 42 degrees C for 0 (control), 20, 60, 100 and 200 min. Quantitative RT-PCR for beta 2m (internal control), heat shock factors (HSF1, HSF2, HSF4, HSF5), heat shock proteins (HSP10, HSP40), and Caspase-3 was done and their transcriptional abundance was assessed by Pfaffl method. Transcriptional abun-dance of HSF1, HSF2, and HSF4 did not change at 20 min, increased (P < 0.05) from 60 to 200 min and reached zenith at 200 min of heat exposure. However, transcriptional abundance of HSF5 was gradually escalated (P < 0.05) from 20 to 200 min and registered highest at 200 min of heat exposure. Transcriptional abundance of HSP10 and HSP40 followed an similar pattern like that of HSF5. Transcriptional abundance of Caspase-3 was significantly down-regulated at 200 min of heat exposure. It could be speculated that over-expression of HSFs and HSPs might have reduced Caspase-3 expression at 200 min of heat exposure suggesting their involvement in cardiac cells survival under heat stress. Moreover, hyper-expression of HSFs and HSPs could maintain the integrity and endurance of cardiac tissues of goats under heat stress.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103393,111,NA,NA,103393,Heat stress; HSFs; HSPs; Caspase-3; Cardiac cells; Goat
article,Effects of heat stress on performance and thermoregulatory responses of Piau purebred growing pigs,"Teixeira, Alipio dos Reis and Veroneze, Renata and Moreira, Vinicius Eduardo and Campos, Lorena Duarte and Januario Raimundi, Sabata Cristina and Reis Furtado Campos, Paulo Henrique",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The study of how different breeds adapt to heat stress and the further understanding of mechanisms underlying pigs thermotolerance is of utmost importance to attenuate the negative effects of heat stress on pigs welfare, physiology, and performance. Therefore, this study aimed at evaluating the effects of ambient temperature on performance and thermoregulatory responses of Piau purebred pigs. The Brazilian native pig breed Piau is a fat-type breed characterized by adaptability and resistance to diseases. To achieve our goal, Piau purebred pigs (65 kg initial BW) were allocated to one of the two constant ambient temperature conditions: thermoneutral (22 degrees C; n = 11) and heat stress (30 degrees C; n = 11). The experimental period lasted 15 days (days 1 to 15). Pigs were individually weighed at the beginning and end of the experimental period. Body and rectal temperatures, respiratory rate and blood indicators of stress and metabolism were measured throughout the experiment. Piau purebred pigs exposed to 30 degrees C had lower (p < 0.05) feed intake, body weight gain and final body weight than pigs at 22 degrees C. Feed conversion rate was not affected (p 0.05) by ambient temperature. Irrespective of ambient temperature, pigs had similar (p > 0.05) backfat thickness and loin eye area. Piau pigs at 30 degrees C had increased (p < 0.05) nape, dorsal, flank, and rectal temperatures and increased respiratory rate than their counterparts reared at 22 degrees C. In summary, our results show that Piau purebred pigs acclimation to 30 degrees C of ambient temperature is characterized by increased body skin temperature to optimize sensible heat loss to the environment; increased respiratory rate to promote latent heat loss; and by a concomitant reduced voluntary feed intake to reduce heat production associated with digestion and metabolic processes with negative effects on body weight gain.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103009,99,NA,NA,103009,Adaptation; Genotype; High temperature; Local breed; Thermotolerance

M. and Alagawany, Mahmoud",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Environmental changes pose significant threats to agricultural activities particularly animal production. These changes have induced major concerns which will negatively affect the poultry health and productivity under the current climate changes. Moreover, they also alter the immunological status of the exposed birds and make them susceptible to different diseases. The adverse effects of environmental stress also include poor performance of birds (reduced feed intake, growth, feed efficiency, immunity, and egg production) and inferior product quality. The adverse effect of heat stress on different quail breeds like Japanese quail, bobwhite quail, scaled quail, and Gambel's quail ranged from decreased growth rates (11.0-14.5\%), body weight (7.7-13.2\%), feed intake (6.1-21.6\%), feed efficiency (4.3-8.6\%), and egg production (6.6-23.3\%). Also, birds reared under heat stress (34 degrees C) had significantly decreased Haugh units by 10.8\% and egg weight by 14.3\% in comparison with the control group (reared at 22 degrees C). On the other hand, increasing stoking density from 30 to 45 kg/m2 also negatively affected the feed intake and body weight. Recent studies have focused on evaluating the potential adverse effects of different environmental stresses on poultry performance, behavior, welfare, and reproduction. It is imperative to understand better the interaction of different environmental factors and their subsequent effects on avian physiology, to spotlights on the effective management and nutritional strategies to alleviate the adverse effects of different stresses in poultry. This review aims to present a comprehensive overview of physiological manifestations of major environmental stresses including thermal stress (heat and cold stress) and high stocking densities on poultry health and production. Moreover, we have also critically evaluated the scope and efficacy of some potential strategies to mitigate the influences of these environmental stressors in different poultry species.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102944,99,NA,NA,102944,Environmental stresses; Stocking density; Poultry; Health; Production; Nutrition

Methods: WIS, WKY and SHR rats were subdivided into three different groups according their age: WIS16, WIS48, WIS72, WKY16, WKY48, WKY72, SHR16, SHR48 and SHR72 weeks-old. Body mass and blood pressure were periodically measured along the experiments. All animal group had their circadian rhythm of Tcore evaluated over three consecutive days (72 h) by telemetry using an implanted temperature sensor. The Tcore circadian rhythm was averaged in 1-h blocks and analyzed using the cosinor method. Results: Sixteen-week-old SHR (SHR16) presented higher Tcore than WIS16 (from 06am to 06pm) and WKY16 (from 07am to 06pm). Both normotensive groups exhibited increases in Tcore during circadian rhythm with aging. The cosinor analysis showed no differences between strains and ages for the acrophase. An age effect on the SHR strain (SHR16 < SHR72) was observed regarding the amplitude. SHR16 had higher values regarding MESOR compared to WIS16 and WKY16. In addition, WIS72 and WKY72 showed higher values than WIS16 and WKY16, respectively. Finally, no differences were observed in the strength rhythm analysis. Conclusions: SHR presented impaired thermoregulatory control at only 16 weeks of age when showing a higher body temperature during the activity phase, while other circadian rhythm parameters showed no differences across aging. Therefore, in taking our results as a whole we can conclude that WIS and WKY are appropriate Wistar strains to be used as normotensive controls for SHR.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102807,97,NA,NA,102807,Circadian rhythm; Body core temperature; Hypertension; Experimental strains

Water and phase change material (PCM) were used as splint fillers at two different temperatures (42 degrees C and 44 degrees C). Free cooling and a temperature-controlled thermal splint were also considered. The study showed that a PCM filled splint or a temperature-controlled splint produced relatively larger and deeper temperature changes compared to the one produced with a water filled splint. With a PCM filled splint it was possible to reach a temperature increase of 1 degrees C in muscle tissue (42.61 cm(3)) and not only in fatty tissue.,2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102868,97,NA,NA,102868,Thermotherapy; Pain relief; Hot-packs; Phase change material; 3D FEM modeling
article,Behavioral thermoregulation in the fasted C57BL/6 mouse,"Craig, Molly C. and Silva, Larissa O. and Swoap, Steven J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Under relatively cool ambient temperatures and a caloric deficit, mice will undergo daily torpor ? a short-term regulated reduction in metabolic rate with a concomitant drop in body temperature. Mice can alternatively achieve metabolic savings by utilizing behavioral changes, such as seeking a warmer environment. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the behavioral interaction between torpor utilization and thermotaxis. That is, if a fasted mouse is faced with a choice between a warm environment not conducive for torpor, and a cool environment that will induce torpor, which scenario will the fasting mouse choose? Here, the temperature preferences of fasted mice were studied using a temperature gradient device that allows a mouse to freely move along a gradient of temperatures. C57BL/6 mice were implanted with temperature telemeters that recorded location, core temperature (Tb), and activity concurrently over a 23-h period in the thermal gradient. When the gradient was on, mice preferred the warm end of the gradient when fed (71 ? 4\% of the time) and even more so when fasted (84 ? 2\%). When the gradient was on, the fasted minimum Tb was significantly higher (34.4 ? 0.3 ?C) than when the gradient was off (27.7 ? 1.6 ?C). Further, fasted mice lost significantly more weight when the gradient was off despite maintenance of a metabolically favorable lower minimum Tb in this condition. These results indicate that fasted mice not only prefer warm ambient temperatures when given the choice, but that it is also the pathway with more favorable metabolic outcomes in a period of reduced caloric intake.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102821,96,NA,NA,102821,Metabolic rate; Torpor; Preferred temperature; Core temperature; Behavior

Expression levels of HSP70 and CPT-1 were used to assess the heat tolerance of three Egyptian local breeds (Fayoumi, Dandarawi and Sinai) with and without the naked neck gene and under normal and heat stress conditions. There were two genotypes from each breed that had the same genetic origin (the naked neck and normal plumage genotypes). For each genotype, chicks were divided into two groups, a control group and a treated group. Chicks in the treated group were subjected to heat stress (40 degrees C) for four hours when they were between 3 and 5 days old. This treatment was associated with a highly significant increase in HSP70 and CPT-1 gene expression for the Dandarawi breed compared to the levels in the Fayoumi and Sinai breeds. Moreover, the introduction of the naked neck gene into these local breeds caused marked increases in CPT-1 gene expression, but these increases did not significantly differ among different naked neck genotypes. Therefore, it could be concluded that the Dandarawi breed exhibited the best heat tolerance, followed by the Sinai breed, whereas the Fayoumi breed was inferior in this respect. Furthermore, the naked neck gene improved heat tolerance by increasing HSP70 gene expression rather than only by reducing feather cover. The results obtained recommended using the Sinia naked neck chicken as a male line in commercial parent stock to produce broiler chicks adapted to the hot and warm climates.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.12.018,80,NA,113-118,NA,Gene expression; Heat tolerance; Native breed

However, the contribution of the central cholinergic system on thermoregulatory responses and its relationship with cardiovascular adjustments in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), an animal model of reduced baroreceptor sensitivity and thermoregulatory deficit, has not been completely clarified. Therefore, the aim of this study was to verify the involvement of the central cholinergic system in cardiovascular and thermoregulatory adjustments in SHRs. Male Wistar rats (n = 17) and SHRs (n = 17) were implanted with an intracerebroventricular cannula for injections of 2 mu L of physostigmine (phy) or saline solution. Tail temperature (T-tail), internal body temperature (T-int), systolic arterial pressure (SAP), heart rate (HR) and metabolic rate were registered during 60 min while the animals remained at rest after randomly receiving the injections. The variability of the SAP and the HR was estimated by the fast Fourier transform. Phy treatment began a succession of cardiovascular and thermoregulatory responses that resulted in increased SAP, reduced HR and increased T-tail in both Wistar and SHRs groups. The magnitude of these effects seems to be more intense in SHRs, since the improvement of heat dissipation reflected in T-int. Taken together, these results provide evidence that hypertensive rats present greater cardiovascular and thermoregulatory responses than normotensive rats after central cholinergic stimulation.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.08.014,77,NA,86-95,NA,Thermoregulation; Physostigmine; Hypertension; Central cholinergic synapses
article,The impact of posture and basking orientation on thermoregulation in the Sungazer (<i>Smaug giganteus</i>),"Stanton-Jones, Wade K. and Parusnath, Shivan and Alexander, Graham J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Body temperature (T-b) is one of the most influential factors affecting physiological processes in ectothermic animals. Reptiles use behaviours such as shuttling, and postural and orientation adjustments to ensure that T-b remains close to a target. It is thought that target body temperature (T-target) is aligned to the physiological and behavioural thermal optima of the animal. The Sungazer (Smaug giganteus), a Threatened lizard species, is unique amongst the Cordylidae in that lizards inhabit self-excavated burrows in open grasslands, a habitat in which there are few exposed rock basking sites. In this situation, T(b)s are likely to be greatly influenced by postural and orientation adjustments during basking. We measured T(b)s using modified iButtons, and calculated T-target of free-ranging Sungazers in order to assess the impact of body posture and orientation in the thermoregulation of the species. We used camera traps to record lizard behaviour at burrow entrances and aligned these measures to measures of T-b. T-target was 30 +/- 1.4 degrees C, and T(b)s remained within this range for 371 +/- 162 min per day. The anterior body-up postures resulted in faster heating and higher T(b)s. Lizards heated faster when facing away from the sun and spent proportionally more time in this orientation in the morning when T(b)s were lower than T-target.( )Our findings suggest that their wide behavioural repertoire allows Sungazers to thermoregulate effectively over a broad range of environmental conditions and may thus be able to effectively respond to changing climatic conditions.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.05.005,75,NA,45-53,NA,Behavioural thermoregulation; Smaug giganteus; Target temperature

Furthermore, the standard model was individualized with four parameters (height, weight, sex and age) for more accurate prediction. Besides, both models were validated with experimental data. Results show that the standard model prediction-measurement discrepancies of the skin temperatures lay in the range of S.D. of measurements. Compared to the standard model, there were some improvements in the individualized model, especially for old men. Further validation with published experimental data indicated good predictions were also in good agreement with measurements.

J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Fish species show distinct differences in their muscular concentrations of imidazoles and free amino acids (FAA). This study was conducted to investigate whether metabolic response to mildly elevated water temperature (MEWT) relates to species-dependent muscular concentrations of imidazoles and FAA. Thirteen carp and 17 Nile tilapia, housed one per aquarium, were randomly assigned to either acclimation (25 degrees C) or MEWT (30 degrees C) for 14 days. Main muscular concentrations were histidine (HIS; P < 0.001) in carp versus N-aacetylhistidine (NAH; P < 0.001) and taurine (TAU; P=0.001) in tilapia. Although the sum of imidazole (HIS +NAH) and TAU in muscle remained constant over species and temperatures (12 > 0.05), (NAH+HIS)/TAU ratio was markedly higher in carp versus tilapia, and decreased with MEWT only in carp (P < 0.05). Many of the muscular FAA concentrations were higher in carp than in tilapia (P < 0.05). Plasma acylcarnitine profile suggested a higher use of AA and fatty acids in carp metabolism (P < 0.05). On the contrary, the concentration of 3-hydroxyisovalezylcarnitine, a sink of leucine catabolism, (P=0.009) pointed to avoidance of leucine use in tilapia metabolism. Despite a further increase of plasma longer-chain acylcarnitines in tilapia at MEWT (P=0.009), their corresponding beta-oxidation products (3-hydroxy-longer-chain acylcarnitines) remained constant. Together with higher plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) in carp (P=0.001), the latter shows that carp, being a fatter fish, more readily mobilises fat than tilapia at MEWT, which coincides with more intensive muscular mobilization of imidazoles. This study demonstrates that fish species differ in their metabolic response to MEWT, which is associated with species-dependent changes in muscle imidazole to taurine ratio.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.02.004,65,NA,57-63,NA,Carp; Histidine; Mildly elevated water temperature; N-a-acetylhistidine; Taurine; Tilapia

Innate immunological parameters like phagocytosis and generation of cytotoxic molecules like superoxide anion, nitric oxide and phenoloxidase activity were estimated in E. carteri at different environmentally realistic water temperatures (10, 20, 30 and 40 degrees C) and pH (6.4, 7.4 and 8.4). Phagocytosis and cytotoxicity are established as important immune parameters of invertebrates. Calalase, an antioxidant enzyme and phosphatases are involved in pathogen destruction and are considered as components of innate immunity. Activities of catalase, acid and alkaline phosphatases were estimated in E. carteri at different thermal regimes and pH. Modulation of phagocytic and cytotoxic responses and the activities of catalase and phosphatases at different water temperatures and pH indicated temperature and pH specific immunological status of E. carteri.

The drivers of this variation remain unclear, however, despite obvious consequences for population persistence and conservation in the face of ongoing global change. This study explored local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity of metabolic rates and thermal limits in the supratidal rockpool beetle Ochthebius lejolisii. . Using populations from localities at different ends of the species range that experience contrasting thermal variability, we simultaneously tested two of the major paradigms of spatial physiological ecology: metabolic cold adaptation (MCA) and the climatic variability hypothesis (CVH). Reciprocal acclimation was conducted under spring temperature regimes of both localities, incorporating local diurnal variation. Metabolic rates were measured by closed respirometry, and thermal tolerance limits estimated through thermography. In line with MCA, the higher-latitude population (colder climate) showed higher metabolic rates and temperature coefficients (Q10s) 10 s) at lower temperatures than the lower-latitude population. As predicted by the CVH, the lower-latitude population (more variable climate) showed higher upper thermal tolerance but only the higher-latitude population was able to acclimate upper thermal limits. This result suggests trade-offs between physiological thermal limits and thermal plasticity in this species. A limited acclimation capacity could make populations on Mediterranean coasts especially vulnerable in the face of projected increases in extreme temperatures under ongoing climate change.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103934,123,NA,NA,103934,Metabolic rate; Acclimation capacity; Thermal plasticity; Metabolic trade-offs; Thermal limits; Aquatic insects

While the evidence is contradictory, we hypothesize that the presence of muscle damage and the time window of measurement are confounding factors in the skin temperature response. The objective was to determine whether skin temperature is influenced by different workloads and the time course of temperature measurements over the following 24 h. 24 trained male military were assigned to one of three groups: GC group (n = 8) serving as control not performing exercises, GE group (n = 8) performing a simulated military combat protocol in an exercise track with different obstacles but designed not to elicit muscle damage, and the GEMD group (n = 8) performing the simulated military combat protocol plus 5 sets of 20 drop jumps, with 10-sec between repetitions and with 2-min of rest between sets aiming to induce muscle damage. Skin temperature was measured using infrared thermography before exercise (Pre) and 4 (Post4h), 8 (Post8h) and 24h (Post24h) post-exercise. Perception of pain (DOMS) was evaluated Pre, Post24h, and Post48h, and countermovement jump height was evaluated at Pre and Post24h. DOMS did not differ between groups in the Pre and Post24h measures but GEMD presented higher DOMS than the other groups at Post48h (p < 0.001 and large effect size). Jump height did not differ for GEMD and GC, and GE presented higher jump height at Post24h than GC (p = 0.02 and large effect size).

Eighteen trained participants from distinct sport type - endurance (25.2 +/- 4.9 yr) and speed-power (25.8 +/- 3.1 yr), and 9 controls (24,9 +/- 4,3 yr) - were examined. Lower limbs T-SK and plasma ATP measures were applied in parallel in response to incremental treadmill test and during 30-min recovery period. Plasma ATP kinetics were inversely associated to changes in T-SK. The first significant decrease in T-SK (76-89\% of (V) over dot O-2MAX) occurred shortly before a significant plasma ATP increase (86-97\% of (V) over dot O-2MAX). During recovery, T-SK increased, reaching pre-exercise values (before exercise vs. after 30-min recovery: 31.6 +/- 0.4 degrees C vs. 32.0 +/- 0.8 degrees C, p = 0.855 in endurance; 32.4 +/- 0.5 degrees C vs. 32.9 +/- 0.5 degrees C, p = 0.061 in speed-power; 31.9 +/- 0.7 degrees C vs. 32.4 +/- 0.8 degrees C, p = 0.222 in controls). Plasma ATP concentration did not returned to pre-exercise values in well trained participants (before exercise vs. after 30-min recovery: 699 +/- 57 nmol l(-1) vs. 854 +/- 31 nmol l(-1), p < 0.001, eta(2) = 0.961 and 812 +/- 35 nmol l(-1) vs. 975 +/- 55 nmol l(-1), p < 0.001, eta(2) = 0.974 in endurance and speed-power, respectively), unlike in controls (651 +/- 40 nmol l(-1) vs. 687 +/- 61 nmol center dot l(-)1, p = 0.58, eta(2) = 0.918). The magnitude of T-SK and plasma ATP response differed between the groups (p < 0.001, eta(2) = 0.410 for T-SK; p < 0.001, eta(2) = 0.833 for plasma ATP). We conclude that lower limbs T-SK change indirectly corresponds to the reverse course of plasma ATP during incremental exercise and the magnitude of the response depends on the level of physical activity and the associated to it long-term metabolic adaptation.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103877,122,NA,NA,103877,Infrared thermal imaging; IRT; Adenosine triphosphate; Nucleotides

Eight of them were recaptured the following spring. From October to April, the animals' T-b never dropped below 33 C-degrees, although cosinor analysis revealed a decrease in mesor values and in the amplitude of daily fluctuations of T-b and activity in winter months. Spectral density of circadian rhythms of both indexes also diminished in winter. The magnitude of T-b and fluctuations of activity differed between the two studied familial groups, probably due to their unequal numbers of individuals, which could affect the total heat production.

article,Confounding factors in peripheral thermal recovery time after active cooling,"Pakarinen, Tomppa and Oksala, Niku and Vehkaoja, Antti",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Objectives: The effectiveness of normal physiological thermoregulation complicates differentiation between pathologic changes in medical thermography associated with peripheral artery disease and a number of other clinical conditions. In this study we investigate a number of potential confounding factors to the thermal recovery rate after active limb cooling, with the main focus on age and sex. Approach: The source data consists of 53 healthy individuals with no diagnosed cardiovascular disease or reported symptoms and with a mean age of 38.4 (+/- 12.1) years. The sample population was further divided into male (N = 14) and female groups (N = 39). The thermal recovery time was measured using two thermal cameras from both lower limbs on plantar and dorsal sides. The active cooling was achieved using moldable cold pads placed on the plantar and dorsal side of the lower limb. The recovery was measured until the temperature had reached a stable level. The recovery time was determined from an exponential fit to the measured data. Results: The correlation between the thermal recovery time constant and age varied from low to moderate linear correlation (0.31 <= rho <= 70), depending on the inspected region of interest, with a higher statistically significant correlation in the medial regions. The contralateral limb temperature differences or the thermal time constants did not have statistically significant differences between the male and female sexes. Further, the secondary metrics such as participant's body mass, body-mass index, or systolic blood pressure had low or no correlation with the thermal recovery time in the study group. Conclusion: The thermal recovery time constant after active cooling appears as a relatively independent metric from the majority of the measured potential confounding factors. Age should be accounted for when performing thermal recovery measurements. However, dynamic thermal imaging and its methodologies require further research and exploration.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103826,121,NA,NA,103826,Thermal imaging; Thermoregulation; Dynamic imaging; Thermal recovery; Age; Sex

Within the limits set by genetic makeup, thermal tolerance is affected by the physiological conditioning of individuals (e.g., through acclimation). Considering this phenotypic plasticity may add to accurately estimating changes to the distribution of insects under a changing climate.We studied the effect of thermal acclimation on cold and heat tolerance of the peach fruit fly (Bactrocera zonata) - an invasive, polyphagous pest that is currently expanding through Africa and the Middle East. Females and males were acclimated at 20, 25 and 30 \& DEG;C for up to 19 days following adult emergence. The critical thermal minimum (CTmin) and maximum (CTmax) were subsequently recorded as well adult survival following acute exposure to chilling (0 or-3 \& DEG;C for 2 h). Additionally, we determined the survival of pupae subjected for 2 h to temperatures ranging from-12 \& DEG;C to 5 \& DEG;C.We demonstrate that acclimation at 30 \& DEG;C resulted in significantly higher CTmax and CTmin values (higher heat resistance and lower cold resistance, respectively). Additionally, adult recovery following exposure to-3 \& DEG;C was significantly reduced following acclimation at 30 \& DEG;C, and this effect was significantly higher for females. Pupal mortality increased with the decrease in temperature, reaching LT50 and LT95 values following exposure to-0.32 \& DEG;C and-6.88 \& DEG;C, respectively. Finally, we found that the survival of pupae subjected to 0 and 2 \& DEG;C steadily increased with pupal age.Our findings substantiate a physiological foundation for understanding the current geographic range of B. zonata. We assume that acclimation at 30 \& DEG;C affected the thermal tolerance of the flies partly through modulating feeding and metabolism. Tolerance to chilling during the pupal stage probably changed according to temperature-sensitive processes occurring during metamorphosis, rendering younger pupae more sensitive to chilling.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103677,117,NA,NA,103677,Thermal tolerance; Acclimation; Climate change; Invasiveness; Bactrocera zonata; Tephritidae

This study investigated the effects of high temperature (32 \& DEG;C) on physiology and biochemistry and heat shock proteins (HSPs) gene of spotted sea bass (Lateolabrax maculatus). The spotted sea bass (14.7 \& PLUSMN; 1.54 g) temporarily cultured at 26 \& DEG;C was directly transferred to the 32 \& DEG;C high temperature group, and the gill morphology, liver antioxidant activity, respiratory metabolism related enzyme activity and the expression of five HSP70 family members genes were measured at 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. The results showed that 32 \& DEG;C had damage effect on gill tissue and antioxidant system, and the damage degree increased with high temperature. Respiratory rate and malondialdehyde increased gradually with the continuous heat stress. Superoxide dismutase and total antioxidant capacity increased briefly and then decreased continuously. Succinate dehydrogenase decreased to the lowest value at 24 h and then continued to increase. Lactate dehydrogenase decreased continuously; the expression of HSP70 increased rapidly and then decreased. These results indicated that the antioxidant system and HSP70 were activated under heat stress condition and provided protection to the body, but with the continuous high temperature, the protective effect was limited, and the fish body was irreversibly damaged. It is necessary to pay close attention to the temperature change in the production practice of spotted sea bass to reduce the influence caused by high temperature.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103606,115,NA,NA,103606,Heat stress; Lateolabrax maculatus; Oxidative stress

We assessed internal load, sweat rate, and core temperature. Reported perceived exertion and calves' Tsk showed the highest correlation (r =-0.588; p < 0.01). Mixed regression models revealed that the heart rate and reported perceived exertion were inversely related to calves' Tsk. The exercise duration was directly associated with the nose tip and calf Tsk but inversely related to the forehead and forearm Tsk. The sweat rate was directly related to forehead and forearm Tsk. The association of Tsk with thermoregulatory or exercise load parameters depends on the ROI.

Thirty-two crossbred male lambs {[}Ile-de-France x (Dalagh x Romanov)] with an average weight of 31.2 +/- 1.55 kg and age of 4-5 months were assigned to experimental treatments in a completely randomized design including four treatments and eight replications. The treatments were T0, T20, T40, and T80, representing dietary supplementation of C-NM at 0, 20, 40, and 80 mg per head per day, respectively. The study lasted for 37 days including 7 days of adaptation period. Lambs were weighed on days 0 and 30 of the experiment before morning feeding to determine the average daily gain (ADG) and feed con-version ratio (FCR). Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein on day 30 of the experiment and physiological parameters, including rectal temperature (RT), skin temperature (ST), respiration rate (RR), and pulse rate (PR), were measured once a week on a certain day during the study. Lambs in the T40 group showed higher final live weight (FLW) and ADG, while exhibiting lower FCR (P < 0.01). Regression analysis predicted the optimum levels of dietary inclusion of C-NM to be 44.7, 38.3, and 42.0 mg/day for FLW, ADG, and FCR, respectively. Dietary supplementation of C-NM decreased RT, ST, and RR, while increasing PR (P < 0.01). The levels of immunoglobulins G (IgG) and A (IgA) increased linearly with the dietary inclusion of C-NM (P < 0.01), while levels of immunoglobulin M (IgM) remained unaffected (P > 0.05). Dietary inclusion of C-NM had a quadratic reducing effect on the serum concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) and a cubic increasing effect on the serum activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) (P < 0.05). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) was linearly increased in T80, while total antioxidant capacity (TAC) showed a linear increase in T40 and T80 groups (P < 0.01).

To ensure that intelligent temperature-controlled equipment can deliver a sense of cosiness to people while improving its energy efficiency, we designed a smart decision-making system that sets the thermal comfort adjustment preference as a label, reflecting both the human body's thermal feeling and its acceptance of the thermal environment. By training a series of supervised learning models underpinned by environmental and human features, the most appropriate adjustment mode in the current environment was predicted. To bring this design into reality, we tried six supervised learning models, and then, by comparison and evaluation, we identified that the Deep Forest's performance was the best. The model takes into account objective environmental factors and human body parameters. In this way, it can achieve high accuracy in application and good simulation and prediction results. The results can provide feasible references for feature selection and model selection in further research with the aim of testing thermal comfort adjustment preference. The model can provide recommendations for the thermal comfort preference in a specific place at a particular time, as well as guidance on human thermal comfort preference and thermal safety precautions in specific occupational groups.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103484,112,NA,NA,103484,Thermal sensation; Thermal comfort preference; Machine learning; Deep forest
article,Optimization of hyperthermia process applied to cancer treatment using multi-objective optimization differential evolution,"Lobato, Fran Sergio and Libotte, Gustavo Barbosa and Platt, Gustavo Mendes",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Due to the number of cancer cases diagnosed each year and the fatality rate resulting from some more severe types, the improvement of less invasive and more efficient treatment techniques is of great importance. In this context, hyperthermia is a medical procedure in which the tumor region is heated by using an applicator for a certain period, aiming to destroy pathological cells. Computational models can be used to simulate the heating effect of tumors and adjacent cells. In general, the solution to an optimization problem considering factors such as heating temperature, applicator position, and the time in which the region will be subjected to heating can provide important information about the procedure. Traditionally, this type of problem has been addressed in a single objective context, focusing on minimizing the destruction of adjacent healthy tissue considering the area of the applicator constant. Our fundamental objective is to propose a multi-objective design problem considering the minimization of the area subject to the procedure and the time required for the process of hyperthermia in a breast cancer treatment. The problem is constrained by the degree of tissue destruction and by a partial differential equation that describes the phenomenon of heat transfer in both healthy and tumor tissues.

Environmental changes, such as global warming, adversely affect silkworm viability. Spermidine, a polyamine, protects various organisms against heat stress. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of spermidine on the thermotolerance of Bombyx mori larvae. 5th instar Bombyx mori larvae were divided into the control and spermidine groups and reared at 28 +/- 1 degrees C and 80\%-85\% relative humidity. To induce heat stress, the larvae were exposed to various temperatures 32 degrees C, 36 degrees C, and 40 degrees C for 1 h on day 5 and subsequently allowed to recover at 28 +/- 1 degrees C. Growth characteristics were evaluated by examining larval viability and quantifying proteins and carbohydrates. The thermotolerance of the spermidine group was higher than that of the control group at 40 degrees C heat stress conditions. The spermidine feeding increased the protein content and reduced the carbohydrate content significantly under heat stress condition. For the first time, this study demonstrated that spermidine alleviated thermal stress by enhancing the nutritional indices and antioxidant potential of the Bombyx mori larvae. A significant increase in economic properties was observed in spermidine fed groups.

The present study investigates the risk of cold stress in petroleum transfer centers in Iran's northwestern cold regions. The proposed method by ISO-15743 (E) was used to assess the risk of cold stress. The activity level (M) was calculated using the ISO 8996:2021 standard. The evaluation of local cooling, contact of cold surfaces, and hand and face temperature was performed using ISO 11079, ISO 13732-3, and ISO 9886, respectively. During their work, 28 outdoor site men and mechanics as a case group and 8 operators as a control group put through subjective analysis.

The mean equivalent chill temperature was-13.83 +/- 5.45, and workers were at risk of local cooling stress at levels 1 and 2. The case group showed greater losses in finger skin temperatures after short term exposure to extremely cold environments than the control group (P < 0.001). Based on the questionnaire results a significant percentage of workers performing the activity during the winter have more difficulty.

article,Thermal acclimation and acute temperature effects on cardiac barostatic reflexes in rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>),"Sandblom, Erik and Zena, Lucas A. and Pichaud, Nicolas",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Acute warming raises the metabolism of fish, which is matched by increased heart rate. However, thermal acclimation may reduce heart rate through combinations of lowered intrinsic pacemaker rate and increased inhibitory vagal tone. This could affect the baroreflex, which regulates arterial blood pressure through heart rate changes via altered vagal tone. Using pharmacological tools, we assessed autonomic tones and baroreflex regulation of heart rate in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) at 11 C, and after acute (24 h, 17Cacute) or chronic (> 7 weeks, 17Cchronic) warming to 17 C. We hypothesised that warm acclimation would manifest as reduced heart rate and elevated vagal tone in 17Cchronic trout relative to 11 C and 17Cacute trout, which would increase baroreflex gain and the scope for fH increase through vagal release during hypotension. Compared to 11 C, the 17Cacute group exhibited slightly higher heart rate (Q10 = 1.5) and a strong trend for elevated vagal tone (54\%). Surprisingly, however, routine heart rate was unaltered by warm acclimation (Q10 = 1.6), while intrinsic heart rate and vagal tone (22\%) declined. Consequently, baroreflex sensitivity to reduced blood pressure was elevated in the 17Cacute group but returned towards 11 C conditions in the 17Cchronic group. Atropine abolished nearly all chronotropic changes. Bradycardic responses to hypertension and cardiac adrenergic tone were unaltered across temperature treatments. The lack of a clear acclimation effect on routine heart rate in the present study is likely explained by a seasonal effect as the experiments were performed in early winter. Nonetheless, we conclude that baroreflex sensitivity in trout is thermally plastic; the heightened baroreflex sensitivity to hypotension following acute warming likely serves to safeguard tissue oxygen delivery as meta-bolism is elevated, while the reduced baroreflex sensitivity observed with warm acclimation may be linked to a pronounced metabolic down-regulation.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103315,109,NA,NA,103315,Fish; Baroreflex; Acute warming; Chronic warming; Cholinergic tone; Heart rate; Dorsal aortic blood pressure
article,The use of wearable devices for predicting biphasic basal body temperature to estimate the date of ovulation in women,"Uchida, Yuki and Izumizaki, Masahiko",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The basal body temperature (BBT) in women is biphasic, with high- and low-temperature phases during the menstrual cycle. Biphasic BBT predicts the date of ovulation for contraception and family planning. Although the BBT is measured with a basal thermometer at rest, upon waking up, it is often tedious to measure for women. Additionally, the single measured values are not sufficient to reflect biphasic BBT. To solve these problems, various wearable devices have been developed. In the present review, we introduce these devices, compare them to other available basal thermometers, and discuss possible future devices. Wearable devices used to measure skin temperature, ear canal temperature, and temperature in clothes during nighttime to predict BBT (the type of bracelet, ring, armband, ear, and waist), have been developed. These devices are convenient for users, because they measure and record temperature automatically during the nighttime instead of every morning. The scientific evidence was most documented for the type of bracelet, wherein the wrist skin temperature measured during the nighttime reflected the biphasic BBT and predicted the date of ovulation. The popular wearable device, FitbitCIRCLED LATIN CAPITAL LETTER R measures the wrist skin temperature; in addition, the recent patent information states that the Apple WatchCIRCLED LATIN CAPITAL LETTER R might have added the same function. Although there have been no previous studies, these devices might reflect biphasic BBT, because they are similar to bracelets. These devices are popular in the healthcare market; therefore, their function to measure wrist skin temperature may supplant other devices to predict the date of ovulation in the future.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103290,108,NA,NA,103290,Basal body temperature; Basal thermometer; Wearable device; Female
article,Video analysis of the locomotory behaviour of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> and <i>Ae</i>. <i>japonicus</i> mosquitoes under different temperature regimes in a laboratory setting,"Ziegler, Raphaela and Blanckenhorn, Wolf U. and Mathis, Alexander and Verhulst, Niels O.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Mosquito-borne diseases impose a high burden on human and animal health. Temperature strongly influences the physiology and life cycle of mosquitoes, but also the development and/or propagation of the pathogens they transmit. Thus, the vector capacity of mosquitoes depends strongly on temperature and their behavioural thermoregulation through microhabitat selection. Expanding on a previous study of static thermal preferences, the locomotory dynamics of temperate Aedes japonicus (reared from eggs collected in the field) and tropical Ae. aegypti (from a laboratory colony) was investigated at constant temperatures (10 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 40 degrees C) and in temperature gradients (10-20 degrees C, 20-30 degrees C, 30-40 degrees C). Blood-fed or non-blood-fed female mosquitoes were released in groups of 15 individuals into a Plexiglas box positioned on two thermoregulators connected by an aluminium plate to automatically monitor by video analysis mosquito flying, walking and resting duration, covered distances and velocity. Mosquitoes were predominantly resting, followed by walking and flying. At constant 10 degrees C, flights were rare and brief, and walking was slow. Most activity was observed at 25 degrees C for Ae. japonicus and 40 degrees C for Ae. aegypti. In the 30-40 degrees C gradient, activity of Ae. aegypti increased towards the cold end, suggesting active avoidance of very high temperatures. In the 20-30 degrees C gradient, edge effects were prominent, nevertheless revealing a greater proportion of mosquitoes gathered at the cooler end. Video analysis showed that this effect was not caused by a cold trap but represents true thermal preference. In the coolest gradient (10-20 degrees C), mosquitoes were active in all sectors without displaying a preference for either side. Overall, both the tropical and temperate mosquito species preferred cooler temperatures and actively avoided the hottest temperatures. Further studies with infected mosquitoes should provide important insights for developing models of vector-borne disease outbreaks.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103205,105,NA,NA,103205,Behaviour; Culicidae; Microclimate; Thermal preference; Vector; Video analysis

In the present study, we examined how temperature during early life history might influence growth performance and fatty acid metabolism in age-0 Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) when exposed to cold temperatures at later stages. Fish were initially at 16 degrees C and subsequently held at 16 degrees C or 20 degrees C for 60 days beginning at 34 days post fertilization (dpf). Then, all fish were subsequently raised at the same temperature of 16 degrees C until the onset of cold conditioning at 158 dpf where temperature was gradually decreased to 3.5 degrees C and remained there for two weeks. Samples were collected before (151 dpf) and after cold conditioning (199 dpf) to measure total length, body mass, whole body metabolic rate, fatty acid profile in phospholipids and triglycerides and mRNA expression of genes associated with fatty acid desaturation, elongation and beta-oxidation. Results revealed that before cold conditioning, total length and body mass did not differ between temperature groups, but fish raised at 20 degrees C showed a lower condition factor. During the cold conditioning, only fish raised at 16 degrees C grew significantly longer and heavier. There was no difference in metabolic rates between treatments. Significant increases in total monounsaturated fatty acids with decreases in total saturated fatty acids were identified in phospholipids and triglycerides in both temperature groups after the cold conditioning; however, the 20 degrees C group did not significantly increase levels of gene expression associated with fatty acid desaturation (SCD and FADS1) whereas the 16 degrees C group did.

article,Habitat thermal quality for <i>Gopherus evgoodei</i> in tropical deciduous forest and consequences of habitat modification by buffelgrass,"Lara-Resendiz, Rafael A. and Rosen, Philip C. and Sinervo, Barry and Miles, Donald B. and Mendez-de La Cruz, Fausto R.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Tortoises of the genus Gopherus evolved in North America and have survived major environmental challenges in the past 40 million years. However, this genus now faces multiple anthropogenic threats, such as the introduction of invasive plant species. Buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliaris) is considered one of the greatest threats to arid and tropical ecosystems, where gopher tortoises inhabit, because the grass displaces native flora and fauna. Modification of the environment as a result of this invasive plant portends an alteration of the available thermal landscape. The aim of this paper is twofold: 1) to evaluate the thermal quality of the primary habitat of Gopherus evgoodei (tropical deciduous forest {[}TDF], and 2) determine the potential thermal changes due to habitat modification by buffelgrass. First, we obtained data on body temperature of active tortoises in semi-captivity. Second, we measured the operative environmental temperature during 5 years at three sites south of Sonora, Mexico that support G. evgoodei: a) a pristine TDF (Conserved-TDF); b) a forest patch surrounded by introduced buffelgrass pasture (Partial-TDF); and c) an introduced buffelgrass pasture area (Buffel-Pasture). Our results demonstrate that the intact microhabitats within the TDF provide G. evgoodei with high thermal quality at both spatial and temporal scales. However modified habitat by buffelgrass had higher operative temperatures for G. evgoodei than TDF. The thermal quality of the sites disturbed with buffelgrass can exceed the thermal requirements of G. evgoodei by up to 25 degrees C. Finally, we discussed potential collateral effects of habitat modification by invasion by buffelgrass.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103192,104,NA,NA,103192,Alamos-Sonora; Exotic pasture; Operative thermal models; Testudinidae; Thermal niche; Tropical environment

In this study, heat flux from the body surface was measured on 18 moulting southern elephant seals to estimate metabolic heat loss in three different habitats (beach, wallow and vegetation). Temperature data loggers were also deployed on 10 southern elephant seals to monitor skin surface temperature. On average, heat loss of animals on the beach was greater than in wallows or vegetation, and greater in wallows than in vegetation. Heat loss across all habitats during the moult equated to 1.8 x resting metabolic rate (RMR). The greatest heat loss of animals was recorded in the beach habitat during the late moult, that represented 2.3 x RMR. Mass loss was 3.6 +/- 0.3 kg day-1, resulting in changes in body condition as the moult progressed. As body condition declined, skin surface temperature also decreased, suggesting that as animals approached the end of the moult blood flow to the skin surface was no longer required for hair growth.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103183,104,NA,NA,103183,Mirounga leonina; Marine mammals; Pinnipeds; Heat loss; Skin temperature; Moult; Thermoregulation

Sreeranjit",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Dietary supplementation of ascorbic acid was found to be effective in modifying the composition of essential biomolecules. A relative investigation on effects of exogenous dietary supplementation of 0.2\% ascorbic acid on the fifth instar larvae of silkworm, Bombyx mori exposed to a high thermal stress of range 40 +/- 2 degrees C was carried out in the lab-set conditions. The observed elevation in various biomolecules, viz., DNA, RNA, protein, lipids, and carbohydrates were quantified in both the thermal stress-induced test groups and in the control, set aside. The test results so obtained were proven to be statistically significant. The present study reveals that foliar supplementation of ascorbic acid has been effective in positively-modulating the biochemical performance in larvae exposed to thermal stress. Moreover, the study also uncovers the possibilities of ascorbic acid as a potential candidate, capable of facilitating the production of good quality cocoons, from larvae exposed to thermal stress.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103184,104,NA,NA,103184,Ascorbic acid; Silkworm; Thermal stress; Biomolecules; Foliar supplementation

S. and Tripathi, Priyanka H. and Pandey, Anupam and Ciji, A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Nutritional programming signifies a process in which broodstock feeding approaches have long-term effects on the subsequent progeny. The present study aimed to elucidate whether supplementing golden mahseer, Tor putitora broodstock diets with beta-glucan affects progeny growth performance, survival, thermal tolerance, and non-specific immunity. Initially, the growth performance of progeny produced from brooders fed with different levels of beta-glucan was non-significant. However, on the 15th and 35th DPH, the maximum weight was observed in fry obtained from the brooders fed with 0.5\% followed by 1.0\% beta-glucan. Furthermore, on 50th DPH, significantly higher weight was registered in the fry from the 0.5\% beta-glucan fed group while 1.0\% beta-glucan group had no transgenerational effect on growth. The condition factor of fry obtained from golden mahseer brooders fed with a 0.5\% beta-glucan diet was greater than the control and 1.0\% beta-glucan fed group. On the other hand, we did not find any significant transgenerational influence of beta-glucan on the survival of the progeny. The thermal tolerance of fry produced from brooders fed with beta-glucan was significantly modulated at both end-points (CTmax and CTmin). Expression of interleukin-1 beta was significantly up-regulated in fry obtained from beta-glucan fed brooders. In contrast, the expression level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha was significantly higher only in fry produced from 1.0\% beta-glucan fed brooders. The expression of immunoglobulin light chain and serum amyloid A gene was significantly higher in fry produced from 0.5\% beta-glucan fed brooders. Overall results suggest that the dietary provisioning of beta-glucan in golden mahseer brooders can be a strategy to produce healthy and robust fry in captivity for stock enhancement and conservation programs.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103120,102,NA,NA,103120,Tor putitora; beta-glucan; Thermal tolerance; Transgenerational effect; Immune genes

M. and Chen, Jinjun and Ju, Xianghong",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In many mammalian species, including pigs, heat stress (HS) detrimentally leads to epithelium damage and increases intestinal permeability. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not thoroughly investigated yet. This study aimed to examine the RIP1/RIP3-ERK1/2 signaling pathway that regulates the expression of tight junction proteins in HS-treated pigs. In in vitro cultured intestinal porcine epithelial cells (IPEC-J2), HS induced the expression of tight junction proteins, ZO-1, claudin-1, and claudin-4, that are regulated by the ERK1/ 2-MAPK signaling pathway. Further, high expression of HSP70 in IPEC-J2 cells induced a significant decrease in receptor-interacting protein 1/3 (RIP1/3), phosphorylated ERK, and tight junction protein claudin-1 (P < 0.05). Necrostatin-1 (A selective inhibitor of RIPK1) suppressed the upregulation of phosphorylated ERK1/2 induced by HS, indicating that the RIP1/RIP3 regulates ERK1/2 phosphorylation in IPEC-J2 under heat stress. In addition, HS significantly damaged the intestinal morphology characterized by reduction of villus length and crypt depth in in vivo porcine model. Moreover, the expression of tight junction, ZO-1, and claudin-4 were downregulated, whereas phosphorylated p38 and ERK1/2 were upregulated in the duodenum of heat-stressed pigs. Interestingly, a decrease in ZO-1 and claudin-1 was observed in the colon, where phosphorylated ERK1/2 was similar to that in the duodenum. Our results demonstrate that RIP1/RIP3-ERK1/2 signaling pathway regulates the expression of tight junction proteins in HS-pigs.

article,Effect of heat stress on growth and production performance of livestock and poultry: Mechanism to prevention,"Chen, Shengwei and Yong, Yanhong and Ju, Xianghong",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Heat stress is a widespread phenomenon in domestic animal feeding in tropical and sub-tropical areas that are subjected to a growing negative effect in livestock and poultry due to global warming. It leads to reduced food intake, retarded growth, intestinal disequilibrium, lower reproductive performance, immunity and endocrine disorders in livestock and poultry. Many studies show that the pathogenesis of heat stress is mainly related to oxidative stress, hormone secretion disorder, cytokine imbalance, cell apoptosis, cell autophagy, and abnormal cell function. Its mechanism refers to activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) signaling pathway, the fluctuation of tight junction protein and heat shock protein expression, and protein epigenetic modification. This manuscript reviews the mechanism of heat stress through an insight into the digestive, reproductive, immune, and endocrine system.

article,Metabolic flexibility is unimpaired during exercise in the cold following acute glucose ingestion in young healthy adults,"McCue, Alexus and Munten, Stephanie and Herzig, Karl-Heinz and Gagnon, Dominique D.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Purpose: Metabolic flexibility is compromised in individuals suffering from metabolic diseases, lipo- and glucotoxicity, and mitochondrial dysfunctions. Exercise studies performed in cold environments have demonstrated an increase in lipid utilization, which could lead to a compromised substrate competition, glycotoxic-lipotoxic state, or metabolic inflexibility. Whether metabolic flexibility is altered during incremental maximal exercise to volitional fatigue in a cold environment remains unclear. Methods: Ten young healthy participants performed four maximal incremental treadmill tests to volitional fatigue, in a fasted state, in a cold (0 degrees C) or a thermoneutral (22.0 degrees C) environment, with and without a pre-exercise ingestion of a 75-g glucose solution. Metabolic flexibility was assessed via indirect calorimetry using the change in respiratory exchange ratio (Delta RER), maximal fat oxidation (Delta MFO), and where MFO occurred along the exercise intensity spectrum (Delta Fat(max)), while circulating lactate and glucose levels were measured pre and post exercise. Results: Multiple linear mixed-effects regressions revealed an increase in glucose oxidation from glucose ingestion and an increase in lipid oxidation from the cold during exercise (p < 0.001). No differences were observed in metabolic flexibility as assessed via.RER (0.05 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.05 +/- 0.03; p = 0.734), Delta MFO (0.21 +/- 0.18 vs. 0.16 +/- 0.13 g min (-1); p = 0.133) and Delta Fat(max) (13.3 +/- 19.0 vs. 0.6 +/- 21.3 \%VO2peak; p = 0.266) in cold and thermoneutral, respectively. Conclusions: Following glucose loading, metabolic flexibility was unaffected during exercise to volitional fatigue in a cold environment, inducing an increase in lipid oxidation. These results suggest that competing pathways responsible for the regulation of fuel selection during exercise and cold exposure may potentially be mechanistically independent. Whether long-term metabolic influences of high-fat diets and acute lipid overload in cold and warm environments would impact metabolic flexibility remain unclear.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102912,98,NA,NA,102912,Exercise; Thermal stress; Indirect calorimetry; Metabolism; Health
article,Does thermal history influence thermal tolerance of the freshwater fish <i>Galaxias zebratus</i> in a global biodiversity hotspot?,"Olsen, Toni and Shelton, Jeremy M. and Dallas, Helen F.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Compared to other climate regions of the world, Mediterranean regions are likely to experience more severe effects of climate change as rainfall decreases and temperatures increase. Global climate change models predict a reduction in rainfall and rise in the temperature of rivers in South Africa's Cape Fold Ecoregion (CFE) - a Mediterranean region in the south-west corner of the country. In the climate change context and with the prediction that stream temperatures will increase, determining thermal thresholds of freshwater fish in relation to their thermal history is a key element in understanding the potential impacts climate change and a rise in stream temperatures will have on already threatened freshwater fish. The ability of aquatic species to withstand warming in the CFE will be determined by its upper tolerance limit (critical thermal maximum, CTmax). A fish's CTmax can be influenced by several factors, including the thermal characteristics of its environment (thermal history). In this study, we set out to examine whether the thermal tolerance of an endemic CFE fish species, the Cape Galaxias, Galaxias zebratus Castelnau, 1861, is influenced by its thermal history. We hypothesised that CTmax of G. zebratus individuals from warmer sites will have higher CTmax values than individuals from cooler sites. Hourly in situ water temperature data were collected and the CTmax values were determined for fish (n = 15 per site) from ten sites on six rivers on the Cape Peninsula of the CFE, and regression analyses revealed that G. zebratus upper thermal tolerance limits are indeed significantly influenced by its thermal history (as characterised by the seven day moving average of daily mean, Mean\_7). CTmax was positively related to the thermal history of the rivers, indicating that G. zebratus, and potentially other stenothermic CFE freshwater fish species, is likely to be particularly vulnerable to climate warming. These findings broaden our understanding of thermal history patterns on fish thermal tolerances in Mediterranean rivers, and support G. zebratus conservation by determining its biological temperature thresholds and thermal requirements. Thermal data should be used to monitor and manage stream temperatures to ensure Mediterranean stenotherms can persist in their natural environment.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102890,97,NA,NA,102890,Climate change; Freshwater fish; Mediterranean region; Cape Fold Ecoregion; Galaxias zebratus; Upper thermal tolerance limit

After seven days acclimation, all birds were weighed and allotted by complete random design to four groups with 3 replicates per group. Every group having 93 quails, comprised of 31 birds per replicate. Experimental groups were birds fed: Control (basal); ascorbic acid (AA), at 200 mg/Kg; betaine (BET) at 2 g/kg and combination of AA (200 mg/Kg) + BET (2 g/kg) of diets. Daily dry?bulb temperature (DBT), relative humidity (RH) and temperature?humidity index (THI) measured at 08:00 h, 13:00 h and 17:00 h fluctuated widely and exceeded the zone of thermal comfort for Japanese quails.

With this, the objective of the research was to quantify the levels of thermal stress and the sensible and latent heat losses of Boer crossbred goats submitted to different air temperatures, in a climatic chamber. Six male crossbred goats of the Boer breed, with an average weight of 25.06 ? 4.43 kg and mean age of six months, were grouped using a completely randomized design, with three treatments (air temperatures of the 26, 30 and 34 ?C, respectively) and six replicates (animals) with 68\% relative humidity. The temperature and relative humidity of the air were collected to calculate the temperature and humidity index (THI) and heat exchanges. Were collected the physiological responses rectal temperature (RT) and surface (ST) and respiratory rate (RF), with these data were estimated the heat exchanges by radiation (L), convection (Cr), total sensitive (Gs), latent of the respiratory tract (Er), cutaneous (Ec), total latent (Et) and total heat exchange (Wt). It was found that the THI values were classified as thermal comfort, moderate stress and very stressful, respectively, in the three conditions evaluated. With the increase in AT, the animals significantly increased (P < 0.05) the RT, ST and RF, and consequently reduced sensitive heat exchanges, from 38 to 8\%, and increased latent heat exchanges, from 62 to 92\%, when compared air temperatures of 26 and 34 ?C, respectively. Physiological responses showed a significant negative (P < 0.05) correlation with sensitive heat exchanges and a positive correlation with latent heat exchanges.

article,Numerical simulation of the effect of necrosis area in systemic delivery of magnetic nanoparticles in hyperthermia cancer treatment,"Sefidgar, Mostafa and Bashooki, Ehsan and Shojaee, Pejman",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In a magnetic hyperthermia treatment, malignant cancerous cells are ablated by the heat production of magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) under an external magnetic field. This novel approach is a promising tool to eliminate the tumor cells by a higher temperature inside the tumor microenvironment. MNPs are needed inside the tumor microenvironment to increase the heat, and this could be possible with intravenous drug injection. However, tumors with necrosis regions are more resistant to drug penetration, and this can cause inadequate and nonhomogeneous temperature distribution in the tumor. Hence, in this study, we used numerical methods to investigate the Spatio-temporal temperature field distribution in the necrotic tumor and its surrounding tissue. To this end, an intravenous bolus injection is used to simulate the effect of systemic drug delivery in tumors with necrosis region. Results show that the temperature field with the necrosis region with 10\% of the tumor radius is more prone to higher temperature values. The hypoxia region is affected by the high temperature despite the necrosis region in the tumor. However, a broader necrosis region impedes drug penetration inside the inner layers of tumors, which leads to a lower heat generation by the MNPs. Results also demonstrate that only 15.5\% of MNP concentration distributed to the necrosis with 50\% of tumor radius, leading a temperature of 42 degrees C in the necrosis region, which is not sufficient for the tumor ablation. Therefore, the temperature distribution is dependant on the sizes of necrosis regions in tumors, and tumors with a larger necrotic region (over 20\% of tumor radius) are challenging to treat with hyperthermia treatment. This study could help the future in vitro and in vivo studies of hyperthermia treatment in necrotic tumors.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102742,94,NA,NA,102742,Hyperthermia; Magnetic fluid; Tumor microenvironment; Magnetic nanoparticle; Biological heat and mass transfer; Cancer biology

Physiological and behavioral demands related to an efficient immune response entail a series of costs that compete with other vital activities, specifically energy storage, growth, reproduction, and maintenance functions. Here, we characterize the thermal biology and health status by the presence of injuries, ectoparasites, body condition, and individual immune response capacity (using phytohemagglutinin in a skin-swelling assay) of the southernmost lizards of the world, Liolaemus sarmientoi, endemic to a sub-optimal, cold environment in Patagonia, Argentina. In particular, we study the effect of a bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide; LPStreatment) on thermoregulation. We found that the field-active body temperature (T-b) was much lower than the preferred body temperature (T-p) obtained in the laboratory. All the individuals were in good body condition at the beginning of the experiments. The phytohemagglutinin test caused detectable thickening in sole-pads at 2 h and 24 h post-assay in males and non-pregnant females, indicating a significant innate immune response. In the experimental immune challenge, the individuals tended to prefer a low body temperature after LPS-treatment (2 h post-injection) and developed hypothermia, while the control individuals injected with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), maintained their body temperature throughout the trial. In both the LPS-treatment and PBS-control individuals, BC declined during the experiment. Hypothermia may allow this southernmost species to optimize the use of their energetic resources and reduce the costs of thermoregulation in a cold-temperate environment where they rarely attain the mean T-p (35.16 degrees C) obtained in laboratory.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102706,93,NA,NA,102706,Liolaemus sarmientoi; Lipopolysaccharide; Thermoregulation; Body condition; Infection; Hypothermia

M. and Pech-Jimenez, Cristina and Medina-Medina, Luis A. and Quezada-Euan, Jose Javier G.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Though social insects generally seem to have a reduced individual immunoresponse compared to solitary species, the impact of heat stress on that response has not been studied. In the honey bee, the effect of heat stress on reproductives (queens and males/drones) may also vary compared to workers, but this is currently unknown. Here, we quantified the activity of an enzyme linked to the immune response in insects and known to be affected by heat stress in solitary species: phenoloxidase (PO), in workers, queens and drones of Africanized honey bees (AHBs) experimentally subjected to elevated temperatures during the pupal stage. Additionally, we evaluated this marker in individuals experimentally infected with the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae. Differences in PO activity were found between sexes and castes, with PO activity generally higher in workers and lower in reproductives. Such differences are associated with the likelihood of exposure to infection and the role of different individuals in the colony. Contrary to our expectation, heat stress did not cause an increase in PO activity equally in all classes of individual. Heat stress during the pupal stage significantly decreased the PO activity of AHB queens, but not that of workers or drones, which more frequently engage in extranidal activity. Experimental infection with Metarhizium anisophae reduced PO activity in queens and workers, but increased it in drones. Notably, heat stressed workers lived significantly shorter after infection despite exhibiting greater PO activity than queens or drones. We suggest that this discrepancy may be related to trade-offs among immune response cascades in honey bees such as between heat shock proteins and defensin peptides used in microbial defence. Our results provide evidence for complex relationships among humoral immune responses in AHBs and suggest that heat stress could result in a reduced life expectancy of individuals.",2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102541,89,NA,NA,102541,Global warming; Developmental stress; Immunocompetence; Phenoloxidase; Tropical beekeeping

Due to the unique morphology of females, this fly has become one of the most serious pests of thin-skinned fruits including blueberry, blackberry, cherry, raspberry, and strawberry. Prophylactic insecticide applications are commonly used to control this fly. A more sustainable approach to managing this invasive pest may not be possible without a clear understanding of the biology of this species under extreme environmental conditions. Specifically, high temperature is known to interfere with development and reproduction of drosophilids; however, the impact of high temperature on D. suzukii needs to be further investigated. The objective of the present study was to investigate the impact of exposure to constant and relatively short-term heat stress on reproductive success of D. suzukii, and potential for recovery. Results show that the development and reproduction of D. suzukii were negatively affected by constant and relatively short-term heat stress. Under constant heat stress, oviposition rate and adult lifespan decreased as temperature increased from 24 degrees C to 33 degrees C and reproduction was completely absent at 33 degrees C. Under relatively short-term heat stress, oviposition, pupation, and adult eclosion were significantly decreased as temperature increased from 28 degrees C to 34 degrees C. The short-term heat stress greatly reduced the fertility of both male and female D. suzukii which was recovered eight days after treatment.

article,"To warm on the rocks, to cool in the wind: Thermal relations of a small-sized lizard from a mountain environment","Buza Gontijo, Ana Sofia and Garcia, Camila Santos and Righi, Alexandre Ferreira and Galdino, Conrado A. B.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Rising temperatures accompanying global climate change are expected to affect mountain lizards. Therefore, basic information on how these ectotherms deal with their thermal environment is important for further management. We conducted a field study to evaluate how body temperature of the small-sized mountain lizard Eurolophosaurus nanuzae relates to the thermal environment. After capture, the body temperature of the lizards was measured immediately, quickly followed by the substrate and air temperatures, wind intensity, and solar radiation at the capture locations. Linear relationships showed that the body temperature of individuals was positively related to rocky substrate temperatures but negatively related to wind speed. However, air temperature and solar radiation were unrelated to body temperature. Although the substrate is an important heat source for E. nanuzae, in an open environment it can reach temperatures up to 10 degrees C above the maximum body temperatures of lizards, and can thus be a low-quality thermal substrate. However, individuals seemed to use wind as a cooling source to counterbalance the risks of overheating from high substrate temperatures. As the montane environment that E. nanuzae inhabits seems to have hotter temperatures than those preferred by the species, lizards should benefit from the cooling winds to keep their body temperature at appropriate levels. Different to previous studies that evaluated wind effects on body temperatures of lizards, our results showed that winds seemed to promote thermoregulation for E. nanuzae.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.07.003,76,NA,52-57,NA,Ectothermy; Thermal biology; Thermal ecology; Tropiduridade; Eurolophosaurus nanuzae

The level of these adaptive responses in thermal physiology can vary among populations of broadly distributed species depending on their particular environmental context and genetic backgrounds. Here we examined thermal performances and reaction norms for metabolic rate (MR) and heart rate (HR) of seven populations of the porcelanid crab Petrolisthes violaceus from markedly different thermal environments across the latitudinal gradient of similar to 3000 km. Physiological responses of this intertidal crab under common-garden conditions suggest the absence of local thermal adaptation along the geographic gradient (i.e., lack of latitudinal compensation). Moreover, thermal physiological sensitivities and performances in response to increased temperatures evidenced the existence of some level of: i) metabolic rate control or depression during warm temperature exposures; and ii) homeostasis/canalization (i.e., absence or low levels of plasticity) in physiological traits that may reflect some sort of buffering mechanism in most of the populations. Nevertheless, our results indicate that elevated temperatures can reduce cardiac function but not metabolic rate in high latitude crabs. The lack of congruence between HR and MR supports the idea that energy metabolism in marine invertebrates cannot be inferred from HR and different conclusions regarding geographic differentiation in energy metabolism can be obtained from both physiological traits. Integrating thermal physiology and species range extent can contribute to a better understanding of the likely effects of climate change on natural populations of marine ectotherms.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.02.011,68,A,14-20,NA,Reaction norm; Metabolism; Heart beat; Thermo-tolerance; Genotype x environment; Geographic variation; Physiological flexibility

J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"In this paper, the three-dimensional thermal effects of a clinically-extracted vascular tissue undergoing cryofreezing are numerically investigated. Based on the measured experimental temperature field, the numerical results of the Pennes bioheat model combined with the boundary condition-enforced immersed boundary method (IBM) agreed well with experimental data with a maximum temperature discrepancy of 2.9 degrees C. For simulating the temperature profile of a tumor sited in a dominantly vascularized tissue, our model is able to capture with ease the thermal effects at specified junctions of the blood vessels. The vascular complexity and the ice-ball shape irregularity which cannot be easily quantified via clinical experiments are also analyzed and compared for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional settings with different vessel configurations and developments. For the three-dimensional numerical simulations, a n-furcated liver vessels model from a threedimensional segmented volume using hole-making and subdivision methods is applied. A specific study revealed that the structure and complexity of the vascular network can markedly affect the tissue's freezing configuration with increasing ice-ball irregularity for greater blood vessel complexity.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.01.006,64,NA,92-99,NA,Cryosurgery; Vascular system; Immersed boundary method; Three-dimensional model
article,Positive selection acted on the extracellular transmembrane linkers of heat receptors during evolution,"Liu, Yang and Lu, Fang and Jiang, Hui and Tang, Yezhong",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"All organisms must maintain body temperature within a suitable range and be able to sense the environmental temperature variations. However, it remains largely unknown how thermal sensing systems have evolved in animals. The transient receptor potential cation channel (TRP) protein family acts as warm/heat or cool/cold receptors by changing the probability of channel opening in response to thermal stimulation. Here, we examined the selective pressures acting on the transmembrane region of six segments (S1 S6) of thereto-TRP family members. Our results showed that there exist positive selection sites in heat receptors, but not in cold receptors. When all sequences of thermal TRP channels were pooled together, more significant selection pressures were found in the linker region between the transmembrane segments at the external side of the cellular membrane. Moreover, the P-loop region between S5 and S6 contains the most selected sites, indicating their importance in the thermal sense. Our study suggests that the heat receptor is more evolutionarily diverse than the cold receptor. This is consistent with the idea that hot environments usually have high heterogeneity, and that it is of great biological importance for animals to choosewarm basking places or escape harsh environments which are hot and dangerous such as forest fires.",2017,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.12.004,64,NA,86-91,NA,Thermal sense; Selection pressure; TRP family; Heat receptor; Cold receptor

The effect of chronic exposure (21d) of pigs to high ambient temperature on expression of amino acid (b(0,+)AT, CAT1) and glucose (SGLT1, GLUT4) transporters, ghrelin, leptin and HSP90 was evaluated. Eighteen pigs (32.6 kg body weight) were distributed into 3 groups: (1) pigs housed under natural high ambient temperature conditions, and fed ad libitum (HS); (2) pigs housed in an air-conditioned room at 24 degrees C (thermo-neutral) fed ad libitum (TNad); (3) pigs housed as in (2), but pair-fed with the HS pigs (TNpf). Body temperature, respiratory frequency, weight gain, feed intake, and feed conversion ratio were measured. At d-21 pigs were euthanized and samples from stomach, duodenum, jejunum, liver, longissimus and semitendinosus muscles, and white adipose tissue were collected for mRNA analysis. In the HS room ambient temperature fluctuated every day (23.6-37.6 degrees C). Respiratory frequency and body temperature were higher in HS pigs (P < 0.001). Weight gain and feed intake of TNad were higher (P < 0.001) than TNpf and HS; gain: feed ratio was not affected by ambient temperature. Expression of HSP90 was higher in duodenum and longissimus (P <= 0.038) of HS compared to TNpf: Expression of ghrelin, leptin and b(0,+)AT were not affected by ambient temperature (P > 0.050). CAT1 expression in liver was higher (P=0.050) but in longissimus was lower (P=0.017) in HS than in TNpf pigs. Expression of SGLT1 was higher (P=0.045) in duodenum of HS than in TNpf but it was not different in jejunum (P=0.545); GLUT4 tended to be higher in liver and semitendinosus of HS pigs (P=0.063).

Tufan and Ozsahinoglu, Ilgin and Yilmaz, H. Asuman and Mumogullarinda, Pinar",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The knowledge about the combined effects of higher temperature and dietary nutrient quality on the diurnal nitrogenous excretion rates is very limited in farmed fish species including European sea bass. Therefore this study investigated the combined effects of increasing levels (30 vs. 60\%) of dietary fish oil replacement by equal mixture of cotton seed oil (CSO) and canola oils (CO) and two different ambient temperature (24 vs. 30 degrees C) on diurnal total ammonia and Urea-N excretion rates in European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). Experimental diets were fed to fish three times (08:30-13:30-18:30 h) at a fixed rate of 3\% BW.d(-1). The daily consumed nitrogen and energy intake of fish were similar during the investigation in different dietary treatments. However, the daily excretion rates of TAN, total nitrogen (TAN+Urea-N) and total nitrogen expressed as a proportion of consumed nitrogen by the European sea bass maintained at 30 degrees C were found to be significantly (P < 0.001) higher (40 to 50\%) than fish maintained at 24 degrees C in all the dietary treatments suggesting higher rates of deamination of ingested amino acids with increased temperature. Daily urea-nitrogen excretion of fish accounted for between 20-30\% of total ammonia-nitrogen excretion rates for each dietary treatment at 24 and 30 degrees C and appeared to be slightly increased by the temperature but neither the temperature nor the amount of plant oil mixture inclusion in diets or the interaction of these two factors had a significant effect on the urea nitrogen excretion rates of fish in different dietary treatments. However, Urea-N excretion rates in fish fed fish oil only (FO) diet were significantly higher (P < 0.05) compared to that of fish fed diets containing increasing amount of plant oil mixture (VOM30 and VOM 60) during the light-on phase of the sampling period at 24 degrees C indicating periodic enhancement of permeability for urea at excretion sites. Further research is needed in order to elucidate the mechanism of nitrogenous excretion in European sea bass fed plant oil containing diets under extreme summer time temperatures employing total dietary fish oil replacement to reveal the possible effects of alteration in cell membrane phospholipid composition on enzymes responsible for nitrogenous excretion and/or detoxification.

article,Thermoregulation in leopard tortoises in the Nama-Karoo: The importance of behaviour and core body temperatures,"McMaster, Megan K. and Downs, Colleen T.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Despite being ectotherms, reptiles have an ability to thermoregulate which is enhanced by adopting a variety of behavioural mechanisms. Different behavioural postures, the use of retreat sites and selection of microhabitats enable reptiles to maintain their core body temperatures (T-b) above that of ambient temperatures (T-a) in winter or below T-a maximum in summer. This study describes the daily activity patterns of leopard tortoises (Stigmochelys pardalis) in relation to T-b and T-a, and the extent to which leopard tortoises can manipulate their T-b in response to seasonal changes in T-a. Ten and nine leopard tortoises were radio-tracked in 2002 and 2003, respectively and cloacal T-b and behaviours observed. Core T(b)s were measured using Thermocron iButtons (TM) surgically implanted into the body cavities of 4 and 5 adult telemetered tortoises for summer and winter 2003, respectively. There were seasonal differences in the extent to which certain behaviours were practiced and the time of day that these occurred. Leopard tortoises generally had unimodal activity patterns in winter and bimodal ones in summer. In winter tortoises were active at lower T(b)s, and at lower T-a, than in summer. Tortoises maintained their core T-b well below T-a minimum profiles in summer and well above these in winter. Core T-b closely followed the increase in T-a minimum profiles in the mornings, however tortoises exhibited an extended thermal lag when T-a minimum profiles cooled overnight. By using different behavioural mechanisms in summer and winter, leopard tortoises maintained their core T-b at different levels compared with T-a minimum and maximum profiles. Consequently although they are ectotherms, they maintained their core T-b independent of T-a. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

article,Thermal stress during incubation in an arctic breeding seabird,"Snell, Katherine R. S. and Aldara, Jon and Hammer, Sjurour and Thorup, Kasper",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Arctic breeding seabirds have experienced dramatic population declines in recent decades. The population of Arctic skuas (Stercorarius parasiticus) nesting on the Faroe Islands, North Atlantic, breed near the southern extent of their breeding range and are experiencing some of the largest declines. This is thought to be caused in part by increased warming due to climate change and thus, it is becoming critical to investigate the proximate and ultimate effects of the thermal environment on parental physiology, behaviour and breeding success. Behavioural observations at an Arctic skua long-term monitoring colony were undertaken during the 2016 breeding season to determine the frequencies of thermoregulatory panting, and interrupted incubation events. Incubating Arctic skuas showed thermoregulatory behaviour at air temperatures (T-a) of 9 degree celsius, which suggested that they may be operating near their upper thermal tolerance limit. Arctic skuas spent significantly more time panting as T-a increases, wind speed decreases and sun exposure increases. This relationship was apparent even within the narrow ranges of T-a (7.5-15 degree celsius) and wind speed (0-5 ms(-1)) recorded. Incubation effort was not continuous with birds leaving the nest for up to 100\% of the observation block. While we found no relationship between interrupted incubation and environmental conditions, panting was only observed in birds that were simultaneously incubating eggs. These results highlight the constraints on birds during the incubation phase of breeding, and indicate a potential maladaptive behaviour of maintaining incubation despite the increased cost of thermoregulation under warming temperatures in this species. However, the relationship between thermal stress, nest absence and demographic parameters remains unclear, highlighting the importance of longitudinal and/or high-resolution studies that focus on Arctic specialists and the interrelationships between environmental factors, nest absence rates and productivity.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103967,125,NA,NA,103967,Thermoregulation; Behaviour; Climate change; Stercorarius parasiticus

Testing how viviparous reptiles navigate highly variable thermal conditions (e.g., relatively cold nights and/or highly fluctuating temperatures) is a powerful way to understand how they use microhabitats for thermoregulatory benefits. We assessed the thermal ecology of pregnant and non-pregnant female Prairie Rattlesnakes ( Crotalus viridis) ) inhabiting a high-elevation, montane shrubland in northwest Colorado throughout their short summer active season, addressing the thermal consequences of microhabitat selection with a focus on thermoregulation of pregnant females at communal rookery sites. We deployed operative temperature models to collect data on the thermal quality of microhabitats used by the snakes, and calculated thermoregulatory accuracy of the snakes by comparing their field-active body temperatures with preferred body temperatures of snakes placed in a thermal gradient. Pregnant females inhabited rocky, hilltop rookeries that had higher thermal quality due to higher and less variable nighttime temperatures compared to microhabitats in the surrounding prairie. Pregnant females therefore thermoregulated more accurately than non-pregnant females. The difference was most pronounced during the night, when pregnant females at rookeries maintained higher body temperatures than non-pregnant snakes in the prairie. Our results support the hypothesis that one major reason female rattlesnakes at high latitudes and/or high elevations forgo migration and gestate at communal, rocky, hilltop rookeries is that, relative to prairie microhabitats, they provide better conditions for thermoregulation during pregnancy.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103948,124,NA,NA,103948,NA
article,Heat shock protein 90 and prolyl hydroxylase 2 co-regulate hypoxia-inducible factor-1α expression in porcine small intestinal epithelial cells under heat stress,"Liu, Yongqing and Fan, Gao and Zhang, Gang and Xiong, Yanling and Li, Hui",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Heat stress (HS) poses a substantial threat to animal growth and development, resulting in declining performance and economic losses. The intestinal system is susceptible to HS and undergoes intestinal hyperthermia and pathological hypoxia. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha), a key player in cellular hypoxic adaptation, is influenced by prolyl-4-hydroxylase 2 (PHD2) and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). However, the comprehensive regulation of HIF-1 alpha in the HS intestine remains unclear. This study aims to explore the impact of HS on pig intestinal mucosa and the regulatory mechanism of HIF-1 alpha. Twenty-four Congjiang Xiang pigs were divided into the control and five HS-treated groups (6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h). Ambient temperature and humidity were maintained in a thermally-neutral state (temperature-humidity index (THI) < 74) in the control group, whereas the HS group experienced moderate HS (78 < THI <84). Histological examination revealed villus exfoliation after 12 h of HS in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, with increasing damage as HS duration extended. The villus height to crypt depth ratio (V/C) decreased and goblet cell number increased with prolonged HS. Quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry analysis indicated increased expression of HIF1 alpha and HSP90 in the small intestine with prolonged HS, whereas PHD2 expression decreased. Further investigation in IPEC-J2 cells subjected to HS revealed that overexpressing PHD2 increased PHD2 mRNA and protein expression, while it decreases HIF-1 alpha. Conversely, interfering with HSP90 expression substantially decreased both HSP90 and HIF-1 alpha mRNA and protein levels. These results suggest that HS induces intestinal hypoxia with concomitant small intestinal mucosal damage. The expression of HIF-1 alpha in HS-treated intestinal epithelial cells may be co-regulated by HSP90 and PHD2 and is possibly linked to intestinal hyperthermia and hypoxia.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103881,122,NA,NA,103881,Heat stress; Pig; Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha; Prolyl hydroxylase 2; Heat shock protein 90

Core and skin temperatures, the percent increase of skin blood flow (forearm and chest) from baseline and local sweat rate (forearm and chest) were not different between 3-min and 30-s (all P > 0.35) from the onset of exercise to the end of the exercise. Similarly, the mean body temperature onsets of skin blood flow (forearm and chest) and local sweat rates (forearm and chest) were not different between different mode of intermittent exercises (all P > 0.1). Furthermore, thermal sensitivities of skin blood flow (forearm and chest) and local sweat rate (forearm and chest) with increasing mean body temperature were not different between different mode of intermittent exercises (all P > 0.1).

article,A simple method to account for thermal boundary layers during the estimation of CTmax in small ectotherms,"Corley, Rebecca B. and Dawson, Will and Bishop, Tom R.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"As temperatures rise, understanding how ectotherms will become impacted by thermal stress is of critical importance. In this context, many researchers quantify critical temperatures - these are the upper (CTmax) and lower (CTmin) thermal limits at which organisms can no longer function. Most studies estimate CTs using bathbased methods where organisms are submerged within a set thermal environment. Plate-based methods (i.e. hot plates), however, offer huge opportunity for automation and are readily available in many lab settings. Plates, however, generate a unidirectional thermal boundary layer above their surface which means that the temperatures experienced by organisms of different sizes is different. This boundary layer effect can bias estimates of critical temperatures. Here, we test the hypothesis that biases in critical temperature estimation on hot plates are driven by organism height. We also quantify the composition of the boundary layer in order to correct for these biases. We assayed four differently sized species of UK ants for their CTmax in dry baths (with no boundary layer) and on hot plates (with a boundary layer). We found that hot plates overestimated the CTmax values of the different ants, and that this overestimate was larger for taller species. By statistically modelling the thickness of the thermal boundary layer, and combining with estimates of species height, we were able to correct this overestimation and eliminate methodological differences. Our study provides two main findings. First, we provide evidence that organism height is positively related to the bias present in plate-based estimates of CTmax. Second, we show that a relatively simple statistical model can correct for this bias. By using simple corrections for boundary layer effects, as we have done here, researchers could open up a new possibility space in the design and implementation of thermal tolerance assays using plates rather than restrictive dry or water baths.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103673,116,NA,NA,103673,Ants; Boundary layer; Dry bath; Hot plate; Physiology; Thermal tolerance

However, the tolerance and physiological response to thermal stress is rarely studied in Gymnocypris przewalskii, a rare native fish in the Tibetan plateau. In this study, first, we detected the thermal tolerance of five groups of six-month G. przewalskii which acclimated at 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 \& DEG;C for two weeks, respectively, by critical thermal methodology. Then, through heat challenge, we detected the metabolites, key enzyme activities, and gene expressions involved in metabolism and antioxidant in the hepatopancreas when the temperatures increased from 16 \& DEG;C to 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, and 28 \& DEG;C for 12 h, respectively. The results showed that although the fish are sensitive to high temperatures, the quick acclimation at mild high temperatures could significantly improve the tolerance to acute high-temperature stress in juvenile G. przewalskii.

A total of 240 laying quails (Coturnix coturnix japonica) with 40 weeks of age were used in a completely randomized design with five treatments and six replications containing eight quails per experimental unit. The studied digestible arginine: lysine ratios were 110\%; 120\%, 130\%, 140\% and 150\%, for 63 days divided into three periods of 21 days each. There was a quadratic effect (p < 0.05) for the variables average surface temperature, average body temperature, core to surface thermal gradient, ambient to surface temperature gradient observed in the morning. In the afternoon, a quadratic effect (p < 0.05) of the arginine: lysine ratio was observed for variables average surface temperature, average body temperature, core to surface thermal gradient, ambient to surface thermal gradient, back temperature, head temperature and respiratory frequency. There was no significant effect (p > 0.05) of arginine: lysine ratios on the frequency of behaviors, except drinking and panting (p < 0.05), for which 130\% ratio provided the lowest frequencies of these behaviors. There was a quadratic effect (p < 0.05) for the parameters of nitrogen retention, nitrogen excreted and nitrogen retention efficiency. Nitrogen intake and excreta moisture were not influenced by the different relationships studied (p > 0.05).

Here we examined the effects of elevated temperatures on four riffle beetle species (family: Elmidae) native to central and west Texas, USA. Two of these, Heterelmis comalensis and Heterelmis cf. glabra are known to occupy habitats immediately adjacent to spring openings and are thought to have stenothermal tolerance pro-files. The other two, Heterelmis vulnerata and Microcylloepus pusillus are surface stream species with more cosmopolitan distributions and are assumed to be less sensitive to variation in environmental conditions. We examined performance and survival of elmids in response to increasing temperatures using dynamic and static assays. Additionally, changes in metabolic rate in response to thermal stress were assessed for all four species. Our results indicated that spring-associated H. comalensis is most sensitive while the more cosmopolitan elmid M. pusillus is least sensitive to thermal stress. However, there were differences in temperature tolerances among the two spring-associated species: H. comalensis had relatively narrow thermal tolerance in comparison to H. cf. glabra. This could be due to differences in the climatic and hydrological conditions in the geographical regions which the respective riffle beetle populations reside. However, despite these differences, H. comalensis and H. cf. glabra showed a dramatic increase in their metabolic rates with increasing temperatures indicating that these species are indeed spring specialists and likely have a stenothermal profile.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103485,112,NA,NA,103485,Karst; Stenothermal; Thermal stress; Springs; Oxygen consumption; Elmidae

Ingestible core temperature capsules are a non-invasive and increasingly popular choice for measuring core body temperature, particularly considering the well-established validation of capsule systems. A newer version of the e-Celsius ingestible core temperature capsule has been released since the preceding validation study resulting in a paucity of validated research for the current version of capsules, P022-P, used by researchers. Using a 1:1 ratio of propylene glycol to water in a circulating water bath, and a reference thermometer with resolution and un-certainty of 0.01 degrees C, we assessed the validity and reliability of 24 P022-P e-Celsius capsules in three groups of eight, at seven temperature plateaus between 35 degrees C, and 42 degrees C in a test-retest format. The systematic bias of these capsules across all 3360 measurements was found to be-0.038 degrees C +/- 0.086 degrees C (p < .001), The TEST-RETEST evaluation revealed excellent reliability by way of a minute overall mean difference of 0.0095 degrees C +/- 0.048 degrees C (p < .001), and an intraclass correlation coefficient of 1.00 for each of TEST and RETEST conditions. Although quite small, differences in systematic bias across temperature plateaus were observed for both the OVERALL bias-between 0.00066 degrees C and 0.041 degrees C-and TEST/RETEST bias-between 0.00010 degrees C and 0.016 degrees C. We found that the new capsule version outperforms manufacturer guarantees, with half of the systematic bias observed in a validation study of the previous capsule version. Though these capsules tend to slightly underestimate tem-perature, we find they possess excellent validity and reliability between 35 degrees C and 42 degrees C.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103486,112,NA,NA,103486,Gastrointestinal temperature; Core body temperature; Temperature capsule; Ingestible sensors; Thermometry
article,Individual variability in achievement of short-term heat acclimation during a fixed intensity protocol,"Saillant, Michelle M. and Charkoudian, Nisha and Salgado, Roy M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Introduction: Heat acclimation (HA) occurs with similar to 8-10d of repeated heat exposure; however, adaptations can occur earlier (<7d; termed short-term heat acclimation; STHA). Purpose: To test the hypothesis that some, but not all, young healthy men would achieve STHA after 5d of a standard HA protocol. Methods: We conducted a novel, post-hoc analysis of data from 13 healthy men (21 +/- 3 yrs; 173 +/- 8 cm; 75.1 +/- 12.2 kg) who participated in an 8d HA protocol (120 min treadmill walking: 5 km h 1, 2\% grade; 40. C, 40\% relative humidity). Core temperature (T-c), heart rate (HR), and whole body sweating rate (SR) were compared across 1d, 5d, and 8d of H Lambda. Criteria for H Lambda were delta (Delta)T-c <= 0.9 degrees C and Delta HR=33 beats center dot min(-1). Results: Group averages on 1d, 5d, and 8d of H Lambda for end exercise T-c (38.1 +/- 0.34; 37.9 +/- 0.3; 37.8 +/- 0.3. C) and HR (134 +/- 17; 122 +/- 13; 121 +/- 13 beats center dot min(-1)) were decreased by 5d (p < 0.05) and did not decrease further by 8d..Tc (1.1 +/- 0.36; 0.95 +/- 0.45; 0.95 +/- 0.33 degrees C) and Delta HR (36 +/- 18; 33 +/- 17; 33 +/- 15 beats center dot min(-1)) showed similar patterns (p > 0.05). At 5d, 31\% (4/13) of the volunteers achieved HA; the remaining 9 volunteers had further adaptations between 5d and 8d. SR was not different across 1d, 5d, and 8d (860 +/- 148; 908 +/- 210; 873 +/- 203 mL h(-1) respectively; p > 0.05). Conclusion: Our results suggest that during a fixed-intensity HA protocol in young men, using criteria of changes in T-c and HR,similar to 1/3 achieve STHA.

At normoxia, acute cold exposure did not affect the ventilatory variables, with the exception of HT males, in which cold prevented the reduced VE observed under thermoneutral conditions. Exposure to 20 degrees C caused a decrease in TB in both sexes, and LT and HT females presented a greater hypothermic response. Hypercapnia combined with cold did not alter the ventilatory vari-ables, but LT females and CT males and females showed a blunted CO2-induced hyperventilation due to a higher V O2, compared to the same groups in thermoneutral conditions. Unlike with thermoneutral conditions, the blunted hypercapnic hyperventilation observed in the HT groups was not observed during cold challenge. CO2 exposure promoted a similar decrease in TB in the thermoneutral and acutely cold exposed groups, while LT females under cold condition presented a blunted hypothermic response. During hypoxia, cold challenge attenuated the increase in VE in LT females and HT males, due to changes in VT. Hypoxic metabolic depression was greater in LT females and males and HT males during cold exposure, while no change in VE/ V O2 was observed. The only alteration in monoaminergic concentration under cold challenge was an increase in brain -stem 5-HIAA and 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio in HT females, and an enhanced 5-HT concentration in HT males. In summary, thermal manipulation during embryogenesis induces 14d old chicks to respond differently to cold stress with LT females and HT males being more sensitive.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103317,109,NA,NA,103317,Broiler; Incubation; Hypoxia; Hypercapnia; Ventilation; Body temperature
article,Structural and functional characterization of turbot<i> pparγ:</i> Activation during high temperature and regulation of lipid metabolism,"Zhao, Tingting and Ma, Aijun and Huang, Zhihui and Liu, Zhifeng and Sun, Zhibin and Wang, Xinan and Xu, Rongjing",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Transcription factors of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (ppar gamma) is a ligand-activated receptor that plays key roles in lipid metabolism and inflammation. In this study, we cloned the ppar gamma cDNA of turbot (Scophthalmus maximus). It has a 1659 bp coding sequence (CDS) and encodes 552 amino acids. The deduced PPAR gamma protein of turbot contains two highly conserved domains, a C4-type zinc finger, a nuclear hormone receptor DNA-binding region signature, and a HOLI domain (ligand-binding domain of hormone receptors) identical to that of in other species. qPCR results showed that the expression level of ppar gamma and the expression of the fatty acid transporters fatp and cd36 were significantly increased under high-temperature stress. This indicates that high temperatures activate the transcriptional activity of ppar gamma, and lipid metabolism plays an important role in turbot under high-temperature stress. In addition, RNA interference was used to explore the regulation of ppar gamma on lipid metabolism of turbot at high temperatures. The results showed that the mRNA level of ppar gamma was significantly decreased. After the expression level of ppar gamma was inhibited, the expression levels of fatp and cd36 were significantly decreased. At the same time, GW9662 (a ppar gamma antagonist) was used to inhibit ppar gamma activity in turbot kidney cells, and fatp and cd36 gene expressions were detected. The mRNA expression levels of ppar gamma, fatp, and cd36 were significantly decreased. Our results suggest that high temperatures activate ppar gamma in turbot and that ppar gamma regulates lipid transport and maintains lipid metabolism homeostasis through positive regulation of the expression of downstream genes fatp and cd36. This study further elucidates that the ppar gamma- mediated signaling pathway may play an important role in regulating lipid metabolism during heat stress in teleost fish.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103279,108,NA,NA,103279,Scophthalmus maximus; ppar?; Lipid metabolism; High temperature; RNAi
article,"Impact of relative humidity on the laying performance, egg quality, and physiological stress responses of laying hens exposed to high ambient temperature","Kim, Da-Hye and Lee, Yoo-Kyung and Lee, Sung-Dae and Lee, Kyung-Woo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"The present study investigated the effects of relative humidity (RH) on the laying performance, egg quality, and stress indicators of laying hens raised at high ambient temperatures. A total of 180 Hy-Line Brown laying hens (68-wk-old) were randomly allotted to one of the following three RH conditions for 12 h a day (9:00 a.m.-9:00 p. m.) over four weeks: low RH (LRH; 25\% RH), moderate RH (MRH; 50\% RH), and high RH (HRH; 75\% RH); ambient temperature was 30 degrees C under all treatments. None of the RH treatments affected hen-day egg production, egg weight, or egg mass (P > 0.05). However, feed intake was lower in the HRH group than in the LRH group (P < 0.05). Plasma corticostemne (CORT) concentration on day 21, yolk CORT concentration on day 3, and albumen CORT concentration on day 7 following RH exposure were higher in the HRH group than in the LRH group (P < 0.05). Moreover, plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration on day 14 was higher in the HRH group than in the LRH group (P < 0.05). On days 3 and 14, the Haugh unit decreased (P < 0.05) in the LRH group compared with that in the MRH and HRH groups. The HRH-exposed laying hens showed the lowest (P < 0.05) eggshell thickness on day 14. The absolute weights of eggshell, yolk, and albumen decreased in the HRH group compared with those in the MRH and LRH groups. Overall, high RH lowered feed intake and egg quality except for the Haugh unit, and induced stress response as manifested by elevated plasma, yolk, and albumen CORT concentrations. To our best knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate the role of RH in triggering temperature stress responses in laying hens.",2022,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103167,103,NA,NA,103167,Heat stress; Relative humidity; Stress indicators; Egg quality; Laying hens

We compared the thorax temperatures of 26 odonate species as a function of body size, habitat quality ({''}conserved{''} and cooler vs ``perturbed{''} and warmer) and suborder (Anisoptera vs Zygoptera), as well as critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and as a function of habitat quality in Argia pulla (Zygoptera) and Orthemis ferruginea (Anisoptera). We expected thorax temperatures to differ between suborders based on their differences in body size and habitat quality status, and that populations in perturbed sites would have higher critical thermal maxima compared to those in conserved sites. This study was done in a tropical region with high ambient temperatures. Anisopterans had a higher body temperature than zygopterans, with no difference between habitats. Thoracic and air temperature were positively related, yet body temperatures were higher than the ambient temperature. A. pulla had higher CTmax in the perturbed sites, while O. ferruginea showed the opposite trend. Microenvironmental changes increase the ambient temperature, perhaps filtering insect species.

An integrated approach that focuses on mechanisms of body temperature regulation, water balance and morphology may help to unravel the functional traits underpinning thermoregulation strategies and the most relevant trade-offs between temperature and water balance regulation. Here, we focused on four species of tunneler dung beetles as important providers of ecosystem services. In this experimental research, we first quantified two traits related to desiccation resistance and tolerance via experimental tests, and subsequently defined two levels of resistance and tolerance (i.e. low and high) according to significant differences among species. Second, we identified morphological traits correlated with water balance strategies, and we found that desiccation resistance and tolerance increased with small relative size of spiracles and wings. High levels of desiccation tolerance were also correlated with small body mass. Third, by integrating thermal tolerance with functional traits based on desiccation resistance and desiccation tolerance, we found that the species with the highest survival rates under elevated temperatures (Euoniticellus fulvus) was characterized by low desiccation resistance and high desiccation tolerance. Our results suggest shared physiological and morphological responses to temperature and desiccation, with potential conflicts between the need to regulate heat and water balance.

article,Establishing a warning index for evaluating the physiological stress of sanitation workers in high temperature weather,"Zheng, Guozhong and Fan, Zhuangzhuang and Ge, Meng and Li, Cong",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"High temperature weather occurs frequently in recent years. As a heat-vulnerable group, sanitation workers suffer great physiological safety risks in high temperature weather. In this paper, a physiological warning index (PWI) is established to quantify the physiological stress of the sanitation workers. Firstly, the dynamic weights of the physiological parameters are calculated by the norm grey correlation method. Secondly, the PWI is established by the efficacy coefficient method and the warning level of the PWI is divided based on the relationships between the PWI and thermal sensation vote (TSV). Finally, the reasonability of the PWI is verified. The results show that the weights of the physiological parameters are dynamic, changing with the environments and the physiological states. The weight ranges of the mean skin temperature (MST), tympanic temperature (TT), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) are 0.036-0.538, 0.000-0.369, 0.000-0.362, 0.018-0.367 and 0.009-0.348. And the MST and DBP are more affected by the high temperature than the TT, SBP and HR. The warning interval of PWI is: (0, 0.25] (no warning), (0.25, 0.45] (mild warning), (0.45, 0.7] (moderate warning), and (0.7, 1.0] (severe warning).

After 30 min of baseline at 28 degrees C, T-a increased linearly to 43 degrees C in 30 min (warming) and then gradually decreased to 13 degrees C in 60 min (cooling). T-a was rewarmed to 28 degrees C in 30 min (rewarming), and that temperature was maintained for an additional 30 min (second baseline). During the warming phase, there were no age-related differences in blood pressure (BP) and rectal temperature (T-re), despite a significantly lower cutaneous vascular conductance and heart rate in the elderly (P < 0.05). At the end of the cooling phase, systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the elderly was significantly higher than the young (155.8 +/- 16.1 and 125.0 +/- 12.5 mmHg, P < 0.01). There was a consistent age group difference in SBP during rewarming. Mean skin temperature was significantly lower in the elderly during rewarming (P < 0.05).

Heat stress (HS) induces intestinal inflammation and increases susceptibility of harmful pathogens, such as Salmonella and Escherichia coli. Intestinal inflammation is a common result of body immune dysfunction. Therefore, we designed an experiment to analyze the effects of 35 +/- 2 degrees C HS on salmonella infection in chickens through regulation of the immune responses. 40 broiler chickens were randomly divided into 4 groups: control group, heat stress (HS) group, salmonella typhimurium (ST) group and model group (heat stress + salmonella typhimurium, HS + ST). Birds in HS and model group were treated with 35 +/- 2 degrees C heat stress 6 h a day and for 14 continuous days. Then, ST and model group birds were orally administrated with 1 mL ST inoculum (10(9) cfu/mL). Chickens were sacrificed at the 4th day after ST administration and ileum tissues were measured.

article,Toads use the subsurface thermal gradient for temperature regulation underground,"Forget-Klein, Emilie and Green, David M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"As ectotherms with moist, permeable skins, amphibians continually seek a physiological balance between maintaining hydration and optimizing body temperature. Laboratory studies have suggested that dehydrated and starved amphibians should select cooler temperatures to slow the rate of water loss and reduce metabolism. However, much less is known about amphibian thermoregulatory behaviour in the wild, where environmental conditions and constraints may be more variable. In seasonally cold environments, where animals must maximize growth, gamete production and/or fat storage for winter dormancy over a short active season, maintaining a high metabolic rate may be primary. We investigated the thermoregulatory behaviour of the Fowler's Toads, Anaxyrus fowleri, in the wild at their northern range limit at Long Point, Ontario. We outfitted adult toads with small temperature loggers and radio-tracked them for periods of 24 hours. Simultaneously, we also recorded air and subsurface temperatures to a depth of 18.6 cm. When active at night, toads rapidly equilibrated with ambient air temperatures. However, during the day, resting toads selected and maintained body temperatures around 30 degrees C during the heat of the day by adjusting the depth to which they were buried. This strongly suggests that they behaviourally thermoregulate during their resting hours to maintain a high metabolic rate without regard to the dryness of their immediate surroundings.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102956,99,NA,NA,102956,Fowler's toad; Anaxyrus fowleri; Radio-tracking; Amphibian; Ectotherm; Thermoregulation; Behaviour; Sand dunes; Lake Erie

The experiment was carried out in June and August 2020, covering the winter season in the southern hemisphere. Local microclimatic variables and cows' behaviors were compared in two conditions (shaded and sunny), in three pasture systems: silvopastoral system with disperse trees (SPSdisp), silvopastoral system with trees along the border fences (SPSfen), and treeless pasture (TLP). The black globe-humidity index (BGHI) was calculated to measure thermal comfort. During the afternoon the BGHI values were above animal thermal comfort at the sunny condition in the three pasture systems. The lowest average values (p < 0.05) of BGHI and soil surface temperature were recorded in the SPSdisp and SPSfen when compared to TLP. The highest value of soil surface temperature observed in the three systems were: in the sunny condition of the SPSdisp (24.7 degrees C) and SPSfen (23.1 degrees C), both between 13:00-14:55; in the TLP (28.5 degrees C) between 12:00-12:55. The time cows spent on each behavior was different (p < 0.05) among the pasture systems and conditions (shaded and sunny): in both SPSs, cows spent more time lying (resting and rumination) at the sunny condition between 12:00-12:50, and more time standing (resting and ruminating) at the shaded condition between 13:00-13:50. The frequency of drinking water was approximately 33\% greater in the TLP than in the SPSs when the BGHI exceeded the comfort threshold (12:00-12:50).

article,Hypothermia induces opposite response in vascular and non-vascular smooth muscles,"Mustafa, Seham",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Background and aim: The mechanism of cooling-induced response of smooth muscles remains little understood despite the increasing importance given to it in recent years. The aim of this study was to examine the possibility of releasing a relaxant or a contractile substance during cooling from vascular and non-vascular smooth muscles. Methods: Assessing the effect of cooling for two different smooth muscles together, vascular (aorta or carotid) which induced relaxation, and non-vascular (jejunum or bladder) which induced contraction. Hanging a pair of smooth muscle strips from different body organs in the same organ bath filled with Krebs solution, each strip was connected to its own transducer and recorder and stepwise cooling was applied. Recordings of isometric tension using organ-bath techniques. Results: Step-wise cooling (37 degrees C-4 degrees C) of aorta and carotid smooth muscle preparations induced reproducible graded relaxation while jejunum and bladder preparations induced reproducible graded tonic contractions, inversely proportional to temperature. The responses of all the smooth muscle preparations were the same magnitude either alone or as a pair in the organ bath. Cooling abolished rhythmic smooth muscle activity of jejunum and bladder. Cooling-induced contraction was reduced by incubation in Ca2+-free solution. The effect of cooling either relaxation or contraction was not enhanced or attenuated by the presence of the two different smooth muscles with opposite response in the same organ bath, proving the absence of a relaxant or a contractile substance released during cooling. Conclusions: Cooling of aorta and carotid artery induced relaxation while jejunum and bladder induced contraction. The response to cooling is inversely proportional to the temperature. There was neither a relaxant nor a contractile substance released from vascular or non-vascular smooth muscles during cooling. Our study suggested that the effect of cooling is through a thermal receptor with two subtype one in the vascular smooth muscle (deep blood vessels) which induces relaxation, and the second in non-vascular smooth muscles (nonvascular organs) that induces contraction and the responses depend on extracellular calcium.",2021,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102818,95,NA,NA,102818,Aorta; Blood vessels; Cooling; Hypothermia; Carotid; GIT; Bladder

The present study evaluated for the first time the effect of high temperature stress in red cusk-eel juveniles to determine changes in plasmatic markers of stress (cortisol, glucose and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)), the transcriptional effect in skeletal muscle genes related to (i) heat shock protein response (hsp60 and hsp70), (ii) muscle atrophy and growth (foxo1, foxo3, fbxo32, murf-1, myod1 and ddit4), and (iii) oxidative stress (cat, sod1 and gpx1), and evaluate the DNA damage (AP sites) and peroxidative damage (lipid peroxidation (HNE proteins)) in this tissue. Thermal stress generates a significant increase in plasmatic levels of cortisol, glucose and LDH activity and induced heat shock protein transcripts in muscle. We also observed an upregulation of atrophy-related genes (foxo1, foxo3 and fbxo32) and a significant modulation of growth-related genes (myod1 and ddit4). Thermal stress induced oxidative stress in skeletal muscle, as represented by the upregulation of antioxidant genes (cat and sod1) and a significant increase in DNA damage and lipid peroxidation.

article,Cyclical and stochastic thermal variability affects survival and growth in brook trout,"Pisano, Olivia M. and Kuparinen, Anna and Hutchings, Jeffrey A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Directional changes in temperature have well-documented effects on ectotherms, yet few studies have explored how increased thermal variability (a concomitant of climate change) might affect individual fitness. Using a common-garden experimental protocol, we investigated how bidirectional temperature change can affect survival and growth of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and whether the survival and growth responses differ between two populations, using four thermal-variability treatments (mean: 10 degrees C; range: 7-13 degrees C): (i) constancy; (ii) cyclical fluctuations every two days; (iii) low stochasticity (random changes every 2 days); (iv) high stochasticity (random changes daily). Recently hatched individuals were monitored under thermal variability (6 weeks) and a subsequent one-month period of thermal constancy. We found that variability can positively influence survival, relative to thermal constancy, but negatively affect growth. The observations reported here can be interpreted within the context of Jensen's Inequality (performance at average conditions is unequal to average performance across a range of conditions). Projections of future population viability in the context of climate change would be strengthened by increased experimental attention to the fitness consequences of stochastic and non-stochastic thermal variability.",2019,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.012,84,NA,221-227,NA,Temperature; Common-garden; Fluctuation; Constancy; Fitness; Stochasticity
article,High oxidative stress despite low energy metabolism and vice versa: Insights through temperature acclimation in an ectotherm,"Bury, Stanislaw and Cichon, Mariusz and Bauchinger, Ulf and Sadowska, Edyta T.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are inescapable byproducts of energy metabolism and may cause costly damage to biomolecules. Organisms have evolved different means to counter oxidative stress, such as modulation of ROS production, neutralization of produced ROS through free radical scavenging and the repair or removal of the damaged structures. A positive relationship between metabolic rate and ROS production is commonly expected, but the oxidative burden of aerobic metabolism remains poorly understood. We investigated whether acclimation to ambient temperatures imposing variation in standard metabolic rate (SMR) is mirrored in the oxidative status of an ectotherm. Grass snakes (Natrix natrix) acclimated for six months to warm (32 degrees C) conditions revealed seven times higher SMR compared to cold-acclimated (18 degrees C) individuals. In contrast to SMR, the amount of damage measured as reactive oxygen metabolites test (dROMs) and abundance of micronucleated erythrocytes was significantly lower in warm-acclimated individuals, while non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity of plasma was unaltered by thermal acclimation. Our results support that high SMR may allow snakes to better cope with oxidative stress, possibly through tissue repair or removal of damaged tissues that also requires energy costs. The reversed association between self-maintenance metabolism and oxidative damage to biomolecules provides novel rational for temperature dependent life histories of ectotherms. How oxidative stress may contribute to the known reduced rates of ectotherm growth or reproduction under cold temperatures or if oxidative stress may even drive such life history trait declines are now important challenges to be addressed.",2018,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.08.003,78,NA,36-41,NA,Standard metabolic rate; Oxidative stress; Ambient temperature; Ectotherm; Acclimation; Reptile
article,Seed germination of a South American forest tree described by linear thermal time models,"Felipe Daibes, L. and Cardoso, Victor J. M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Thermal time models may describe and compare seed germination, providing information useful to explain species distribution. However, the capacity of such threshold models to describe germination of tropical native species has been less studied. We evaluated seed germination of a legume tree species (Peltophorum dubium), typical from South American seasonal forests, as described by two linear thermal time models: probit model and graphic model. Seeds were provided from four different provenances in a latitudinal gradient in Brazil, and their physical dormancy mechanically released before the trials. Graphic model and probit regression were used to determine thermal parameters (cardinal temperatures and thermal time requirement) on sub- and supra-optimal ranges for the different seed provenances. Germination rate mainly followed linear relationship with temperature, and regression lines of different germination fractions converged base temperature in the x-axis. Therefore, probit model assumed a single-value of base temperature in the sub-optimal range and a normal distribution of thermal time. Base temperature tended to be higher in the Northern provenance, Porto Velho, showing slower germination under cooler temperatures. Supra-optimal temperatures have shown similar thermal time requirements and different values for ceiling temperature, according to model predictions. No clear patterns have been found between seed provenances and thermal time requirement. Both probit and graphic models have provided reasonable predictions of germination times (t10 and t50), except under the coolest temperatures. Probit regression always described at least 70\% of seed germination.

COCs were treated at 41.5 degrees C (vehicle: 38.5 degrees C) for the first one hour of in vitro maturation, and the mitochondrial kinetics, oocyte function, and developmental competence of oocytes were examined. SHS increased the expression level of heat shock protein 72, which induced the high expression of SIRT1 and the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase.

We studied the seasonal changes in the thermal biology of I. galani between spring and summer. We calculated precision, accuracy and effectiveness of thermoregulation and the habitat thermal quality for spring, and compared with the values of summer. In addition, we studied how the shift in the thermal preferences of lizards would contribute to achieve a higher effectiveness of thermoregulation. Thermal preferences of Leon rock lizards are among the lowest in lacertids, and are also very narrow, maintaining the narrowness among seasons. As for summer (27.90-29.70 degrees C, mean value =28.76 degrees C), the thermal preferences of I. galani are also low in spring (29.60-31.10 degrees C, mean value =30.38 degrees C), supporting the idea that this species is adapted to cold environments. The habitat thermal quality is lower in spring (10.99 degrees C) than in summer (9.36 degrees C), while the effectiveness of thermoregulation is higher in spring (0.92) than in summer (0.80). We found that the seasonal shift in thermal preferences contributes significantly to enhance the effectiveness of thermoregulation in both seasons, more in spring (0.45 degrees C) than in summer (0.16 degrees C). Because I. galani inhabits isolated mountains, where the activity period is reduced from April to October, we hypothesize that the observed adaptation of the thermal preferences, which enhance thermoregulation to a larger extent in spring, may evolved to maximize performance during the reproductive season.",2016,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.10.005,62,A,1-6,NA,Thermoregulation; Mountains; Iberolacerta; Seasonal variation; Thermal preferences; Thermal biology; Lacertidae

G. and Meyer, A. and Pihan, J. C.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Testis and ovarian maturation status, maturity profile and gonado-somatic index (GSI) were assessed in pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) collected from Mirgenbach, a cooling-water reservoir associated with a nuclear power plant, and from the River Moselle 7 km downstream of the reservoir's thermal outflow. Histological investigation indicated that in both sexes, gonadal development of pumpkinseed in the heated reservoir was more advanced than in the cooler Moselle River throughout the breeding season. The histological maturity profile of reservoir males ranked by the advancement of sperm cells was highly correlated with its GSI (r(s)=0.73, P < 0.001). GSI of females in the reservoir increased with the stage at maturity, but GSI was not significantly correlated with total length, age or growth rate of the individual. All sampled individuals of both sexes were mature at age 1 in the heated reservoir, whereas 48\% of age 1 males and 57\% of age 1 females were not mature in the river. GSI patterns suggest that males in the reservoir adopted one of two reproductive strategies (nesters or cuckolders), whereas no small males with large enough testes to be considered cuckolders were apparent in the river. The warm thermal regime of Mirgenbach Reservoir led to precocial maturity, early season reproduction, and the greater prevalence of apparent cuckolder males than would normally occur in this climatic zone.

article,Circannual rhythm of resting metabolic rate of a small Afrotropical bird,"Thompson, Lindy J. and Brown, Mark and Downs, Colleen T.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Seasonal variation in avian metabolic rate is well established in Holarctic and temperate species, while trends in Afrotropical species are relatively poorly understood. Furthermore, given the paucity of data on circannual rhythm in avian metabolism, it is not known whether seasonal measurements made in summer and winter correspond with annual peaks and troughs in avian metabolic rate. Thus, we investigated how mean body mass, resting metabolic rate (RMR) and evaporative water loss (EWL) of a small Afrotropical bird, the Cape white-eye (Zosterops virens), changed monthly over the course of a year at 20 degrees C and 25 degrees C. Mean body mass was 12.2 +/- 1.0 g throughout the study period. However, both EWL and RMR varied monthly, and peaks and troughs in RMR occurred in March and October respectively, which did not correspond to peaks and troughs in mean monthly outdoor ambient temperatures. These results suggest that measuring RMR at the height of summer and winter may underestimate the flexibility of which birds are capable in terms of their metabolic rate. We encourage further studies on this topic, to establish whether the lag between environmental temperature and RMR is consistent in other species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, HO-1 activity modulates synthesis of cytokines and prostaglandins. All of these factors are well-defined components of fever and pyrogenic tolerance mechanisms. We examine the effect of HO-1 induction and activation using cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP) on changes in body temperature (T-b), plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and HO-1 protein in the course of these processes. Intraperitoneally (i.p.) pre-treatment of rats with CoPP (5 mg kg(-1)) significantly accelerated and enhanced the early stage of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced fever and shortened a post-fever recovery to normal temperature. Pre-treatment with CoPP significantly potentiated the increase in plasma IL-6, PGE(2) and HO-1 levels measured 4 h after the LPS administration. Furthermore, induction of HO-1 attenuated the development of pyrogenic tolerance to repeated injections of LPS. Based on these data we conclude that heme oxygenase-1 may act as a physiological regulator of the febrile response intensity to bacterial infections. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Thermal behavior of L wiegmannii was assessed by radiotracking 22 adult individuals in a coastal dune area from Argentina. In order to account for individual responses we analyzed the factors affecting thermal behavior using Generalized Linear Mixed Models. Thermal behavior of L wiegmannii was mainly affected by the time of day and the substrate temperature. The individuals basking on bare sand in the morning shifted to filtered sunlight during midday and to the shade of clump and erect stems and herbs during the afternoon. The individuals buried in sand when the substrate temperature was low and the wind speed was high. The use of sub-shrubs and shrubs could not be explained solely by thermal factors. In natural L. wiegmannii regulated its body temperature by shuttling between microhabitats that provided them with different levels of exposure to sunlight during the day. However, in modified patches individuals varied in the choice of plants used as shaded places to mitigate high microenvironmental temperatures and they were also more exposed to full shaded sites and less to warm sand to bask, which could have negative consequences for its thermal biology.

article,Microclimate and thermal refuge influences on sage-grouse brood habitat selection,"Dungannon, Tyler D. and Anthony, Christopher R. and Bowden, Timothy S. and Hagen, Christian A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Wildlife space use is driven by three primary mechanisms, predator avoidance, foraging, and thermoregulation. The latter has largely been overlooked in wildlife research. Understanding how habitat use is influenced by thermoregulatory properties is a critical component to depicting species' ecology. Galliformes' (i.e., ground nesting birds with precocial young) ecology is predisposed to thermal extremes, where newly hatched chicks are unable to thermoregulate <14 d post-hatch, and have limited capabilities until >21 d post-hatch. We examined greater sage-grouse ( Centrocercus urophasianus) ) brood rearing habitats and provide the first evaluation as to how microscale thermal environments influenced habitat selection. We monitored 24 broods, collected 82,929 black bulb temperature measurements from thermal arrays (n = 256) comprised of stainless steel black bulbs (i.e., surrogate for operative temperature) to compare brood morning (i.e., foraging, n = 78), afternoon (i.e., loafing, n = 82) and associated random locations (n = 96) between early (<= 21 <= 21 d post-hatch) and late (>21 d post-hatch) brood-rearing. We measured vegetation at all locations to disentangle relationships between cover and thermoregulatory metrics. We found that microclimates at all foraging locations heated more rapidly than either their loafing or random locations. Alternatively, loafing locations moderated ambient temperature more effectively than foraging locations but were similar to random locations. Broods were using loafing sites that both increased their ability to avoid predators (i.e., increased shrub structure) and buffered ambient temperature better than their foraging locations. Interestingly, random afternoon locations tended to lack concealment from predators, despite these locations showing improved thermal buffering compared to foraging locations. However, early brood-rearing habitats appeared to moderate ambient temperatures more effectively than late. Our results suggested that managing vegetation for structural heterogeneity will afford a diversity of thermal refuge for greater sage-grouse broods during this critical life history stage.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103957,124,NA,NA,103957,Brood habitat; Great basin; Microclimate temperature; Sagebrush; Sage-grouse; Thermal refuge

This may be particularly important for sedentary species or those unable to change habitats for long periods, such as hibernators. Low ambient temperatures were traditionally thought key to microclimatic selection for hibernation locations, but recent research suggests that other factors may contribute or exceed ambient temperature in importance. We aimed to characterise microclimates at hibernacula of wild hibernating hazel dormice Muscardinus avellanarius, and test how these microclimates differ to those at locations without hibernacula using a microclimatic modelling approach. Dormice hibernated in areas with warmer soil temperatures and lower variability in humidity and relative shortwave radiation. These results add to the growing body of evidence that low ambient temperatures may not be the primary driver of hibernation microclimate selection, although temperature is still likely to play an important role. We also found that ambient temperatures measured at the microclimatic level were substantially buffered compared to point samples taken at the nearest weather station (similar to 1.6 km away), highlighting the importance of considering microclimates in wildlife conservation in the face of future environmental change.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103909,123,NA,NA,103909,Temperature; Humidity; Torpor; Hibernator; Shade; Habitat

Whereas the reptile fauna of desert systems is relatively well studied, the lizard fauna of saline environments has not received much attention and-to our knowledge-thermal ecology and the effects of global warming on lizards from saline environments have not been yet addressed. This pioneer study investigates the thermal ecology, locomotor performance and potential effects of climate warming on Liolaemus ditadai, a lizard endemic to one of the largest salt flats on Earth. We sampled L. ditadai using traps and active searches along its known distribution, as well as in other areas within Salinas Grandes and Salinas de Ambargasta, where the species had not been previously recorded. Using ensemble models (GAM, MARS, RandomForest), we modeled climatically suitable habitats for L. ditadai in the present and under a pessimistic future scenario (SSP585, 2070). L. ditadai emerges as an efficient thermoregulator, tolerating temperatures near its upper thermal limits. Our ecophysiological model suggests that available activity hours predict its distribution, and the projected temperature increase due to global climate change should minimally impact its persistence or may even have a positive effect on suitable thermal habitat. However, this theoretical increase in habitat could be linked to the distribution of halophilous scrub in the future. Our surveys reveal widespread distribution along the borders of Salinas Grandes and Salinas de Ambargasta, suggesting a potential presence along the entire border of both salt plains wherever halophytic vegetation exists. Optimistic model results, extended distribution, and no evidence of flood-related adverse effects offer insights into assessing the conservation status of L. ditadai, making it and the Salinas Grandes system suitable models for studying lizard ecophysiology in largely unknown saline environments.",2024,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103917,123,NA,NA,103917,Climate change; Ecophysiological conservation; Thermal adaptation; Hybrid modeling approach; Salt plains ecology; Thermal performance curve; Thermal ecology

Any changes in behaviour are likely to arise from a combination of both abiotic (e.g. temperature) and biotic (e.g. infection) drivers, and will have important consequences for survival and species interactions. Blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis, have invaded Atlantic Canada and high proportions (30-50\%) are infected with the bacteria causing Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi. Infection is correlated with increased overwintering survival of adult females, and ticks are increasingly active in the winter, but it is unclear if infection is associated with activity. Further, we know little about how temperature drives the frequency of winter activity. Here, we exposed wild-caught, adult, female Ixodes scapularis ticks to three different winter temperature regimes (constant low temperatures, increased warming, and increased warming + variability) to determine the thermal and infection conditions that promote or suppress activity. We used automated behaviour monitors to track daily activity in individual ticks and repeated the study with fresh ticks over three years. Following exposure to winter conditions we determined whether ticks were infected with the bacteria B. burgdorferi and if infection was responsible for any patterns in winter activity. Warming conditions promoted increased activity throughout the overwintering period but infection with B. burgdorferi had no impact on the frequency or overall number of ticks active throughout the winter. Individual ticks varied in their levels of activity throughout the winter, such that some were largely dormant for several weeks, while others were active almost daily; however, we do not yet know the drivers behind this individual variation in behaviour.

While resilience of benthic populations from thermally fluctuating environments has been investigated at a variety of spatial scales, this has received limited attention across depths and has remained unresolved for Antipatharian corals, key habitatforming species across a wide bathymetric range in all of the world oceans. In this study, we aimed at addressing the thermal sensitivity of Antipatharian corals across depths characterized by different levels of temperature fluctuations. We used an acute ramping experimental approach to compare the thermal sensitivity of colonies of (1) the branched Antipatharian Antipathella wollastoni (Gray, 1857) from two distinct depths (25 and 40 m) in Gran Canaria (Canary Islands, Spain); and of (2) unbranched mesophotic (80 m) Stichopathes species, from Lanzarote (Canary Islands, Spain; S. gracilis (Gray, 1857)), and Stichopathes sp. clade C from Mo'orea, French Polynesia. Results showed that the daily temperature range in Gran Canaria was larger at mesophotic depths (3.9 degrees C vs. 2.8 degrees C at 40 and 25 m, respectively) and this coincided with lower thermal sensitivity in mesophotic colonies of A. wollastoni. Second, S. gracilis from Lanzarote showed a lower thermal sensitivity than the previously studied Stichopathes sp. clade C from Mo'orea (French Polynesia) inhabiting a less variable habitat. These results are in line with the climate variability hypothesis, which states that populations under more variable thermal conditions have a lower sensitivity to warming than those from more stable environments, as they have adapted/acclimated to these higher levels of temperature fluctuations.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103593,115,NA,NA,103593,Black corals; Thermotolerance; Marine animal forests; Acute ramping; Stichopathes gracilis; Antipathella wollastoni

Time spent basking is key for many ectothermic animals to keep their body temperature within optimal thermal ranges. However, little is known about the impact of changes in basking time on the thermal physiology of ectothermic animals. We investigated how different basking regimes (low intensity vs high intensity) affected key thermal physiological traits of a widespread Australian skink (Lampropholis delicata). We quantified thermal performance curves and thermal preferences of skinks subjected to low and high intensity basking regimes over a 12-week period. We found that skinks acclimated their thermal performance breadth in both basking regimes, with the skinks from the low-intensity basking regime showing narrower performance breadths. Although maximum velocity and optimum temperatures increased after the acclimation period, these traits did not differ between basking regimes. Similarly, no variation was detected for thermal preference. These results provide insight into mechanisms that allow these skinks to successfully overcome environmental constraints in the field. Acclimation of thermal performance curves seems to be key for widespread species to colonise new environments, and can buffer ectothermic animals in novel climatic scenarios.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103530,113,NA,NA,103530,Thermal performance curve; Thermal preference; Optimum temperatures; Ectotherms; Lizards

The decrease in temperature in a control point inside the biological tissue was 5.3 degrees C. Micro CT and histological analyses showed that cryostimulation twice a week is efficient treatment. In this case, there was an acceleration of maturation of the newly formed bone tissue replacing the defect region. In the control, the newly formed immature bone with a large number of osteocytes and vessels was detected. In the experiment, the newly formed bone had a more mature structure with signs of a compact bone (formation of Haversian canals, reduction in the number of osteocytes, appearance of gluing lines). Morphometric analysis has showed a 2-fold decrease of the relative vessels area near the defect region and an increase of 30\% in the content of mast cells in the entire bone marrow and especially near the site of osteogenesis. Generally, the complete filling of the critical size defect and almost complete mineralization have been observed. This information is expected to be useful for understanding the effectexposure correlation of the cryotherapy and in the design of the cryotherapy protocols.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103501,113,NA,NA,103501,Cryostimulation; Bone regeneration; Bone healing
article,"Expression of the gonad-specific small heat shock protein,<i> CfHSP20.2,</i> in the spruce budworm,<i> Choristoneura</i><i> fumiferana</i> (Clem.)","Quan, Guoxing and Duan, Jun and Fick, William and Candau, Jean-Noel",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,"Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) play important roles in insect development and stress resistance. However, the in vivo functions and mechanisms of action remain largely unknown or unclear for most members of the sHSPs in insects. This study investigated the expression of CfHSP20.2 in the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.) under normal and heat-stress conditions. Under normal conditions, CfHSP20.2 transcript and protein were highly and constantly expressed in the testes of male larvae, pupae and young adults and in the ovaries of female late-stage pupae and adults. After adult eclosion, CfHSP20.2 remained highly and almost constantly expressed in the ovaries, but in contrast, was downregulated in the testes. Upon heat stress, CfHSP20.2 was upregulated in the gonads and non-gonadal tissues in both sexes. These results indicate that CfHSP20.2 expression is gonad-specific and heat-inducible. This provides evidence that the CfHSP20.2 protein plays important roles during reproductive development under normal environmental conditions, while under heat-stress conditions, it may also enhance the thermal tolerance of the gonads and non-gonadal tissues.",2023,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103463,112,NA,NA,103463,Spruce budworm; Testes; Ovaries; Gonads; Chaperone; Heat stress
