article,Visual search in hunting archerfish shares all hallmarks of human performance,"Rischawy, Ingo and Schuster, Stefan",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Archerfish are renowned for shooting down aerial prey with water jets, but nothing is known about how they spot prey items in their richly structured mangrove habitats. We trained archerfish to stably assign the categories `target' and `background' to objects solely on the basis of non-motion cues. Unlike many other hunters, archerfish are able to discriminate a target from its background in the complete absence of either self-motion or relative motion parallax cues and without using stored information about the structure of the background. This allowed us to perform matched tests to compare the ways fish and humans scan stationary visual scenes. In humans, visual search is seen as a doorway to cortical mechanisms of how attention is allocated. Fish lack a cortex and we therefore wondered whether archerfish would differ from humans in how they scan a stationary visual scene. Our matched tests failed to disclose any differences in the dependence of response time distributions, a most sensitive indicator of the search mechanism, on number and complexity of background objects. Median and range of response times depended linearly on the number of background objects and the corresponding effective processing time per item increased similarly - approximately fourfold - in both humans and fish when the task was harder. Archerfish, like humans, also systematically scanned the scenery, starting with the closest object. Taken together, benchmark visual search tasks failed to disclose any difference between archerfish - who lack a cortex - and humans.",2013,10.1242/jeb.087734,216,16,3096-3103,NA,visual search; target detection; attention; cortex; mangrove environment
article,The sensory effects of light on the electric organ discharge rate of <i>Gymnotus omarorum</i>,"Camargo, Ana S. and Caputi, Angel A. and Aguilera, Pedro A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Gymnotiformes are nocturnal fishes inhabiting the root mats of floating plants. They use their electric organ discharge (EOD) to explore the environment and to communicate. Here, we show and describe tonic and phasic sensory-electromotor responses to light distinct from indirect effects depending on the light-induced endogenous circadian rhythm. In the dark, principally during the night, inter-EOD interval histograms are bimodal: the main peak corresponds to the basal rate and a secondary peak corresponds to high-frequency bouts. Light causes a twofold tonic but opposing effect on the EOD histogram: (i) decreasing the main mode and (ii) blocking the high-frequency bouts and consequently increasing the main peak at the expense of removal of the secondary one. Additionally, light evokes phasic responses whose amplitude increases with intensity but whose slow time course and poor adaptation differentiate from the so-called novelty responses evoked by abrupt changes in sensory stimuli of other modalities. We confirmed that Gymnotus omarorum tends to escape from light, suggesting that these phasic responses are probably part of a global `light-avoidance response'. We interpret the data within an ecological context. Fish rest under the shade of aquatic plants during the day and light spots due to the sun's relative movement alert the fish to hide in shady zones to avoid macroptic predators and facilitate tracking the movement of floating plant islands by wind and/or water currents.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245489,226,17,NA,jeb245489,Circadian cycle; High-frequency bouts; Tenebrotaxis
article,Boat noise interferes with Lusitanian toadfish acoustic communication,"Alves, Daniel and Vieira, Manuel and Amorim, M. Clara P. and Fonseca, Paulo J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Anthropogenic noise is considered a major underwater pollutant as increasing ocean background noise due to human activities is impacting aquatic organisms. One of the most prevalent anthropogenic sounds is boat noise. Although motorboat traffic has increased in the past few decades, its impact on the communication of fish is still poorly known. The highly vocal Lusitanian toadfish (Halobatrachus didactylus) is an excellent model to test the impact of this anthropogenic stressor as it relies on acoustic communication to attractmates. Here, we performed two experiments to test the impact of boat noise on the acoustic communication of the Lusitanian toadfish. Using the auditory evoked potential (AEP) technique, we first compared the maximum distance a fish can perceive a boat whistle (BW), the mate attraction acoustic signal, before and after embedding it in boat noise. Noises from a small motorboat and from a ferryboat reduced the active space from a control value of 6.4-10.4 m to 2.0-2.5 m and 6.3-6.7 m, respectively. In the second experiment we monitored the acoustic behaviour of breeding males exposed to boat noise playbacks and we observed an increase in the inter-onset interval of BWs and a disruption of the usual vocal interactions between singing males. These results demonstrate that boat noise can severely reduce the acoustic active space and affect the chorusing behaviour in this species, which may have consequences in breeding success for individuals and could thus affect fitness.",2021,10.1242/jeb.234849,224,11,NA,jeb234849,Boatwhistle; Fish; Communication range; AEP technique; Anthropogenic noise; Vocal patterns
article,Effects of prey density and flow speed on plankton feeding by garden eels: a flume study,"Ishikawa, Kota and Wu, Heng and Mitarai, Satoshi and Genin, Amatzia",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Feeding by zooplanktivorous fish depends on their foraging movements and the flux of prey to which they are exposed. While prey flux is a linear function of zooplankton density and flow speed, those two factors are expected to contribute differently to fish movements. Our objective was to determine the effects of these factors for garden eels, stationary fish that feed while anchored to the sandy bottom by keeping the posterior parts of their bodies inside a burrow. Using a custom-made flume with a sandy bottom, we quantified the effects of prey density and flow speed on feeding rates by spotted garden eels (Heteroconger hassi). Feeding rates increased linearly with prey density. However, feeding rates did not show a linear relationship with flow speed and decreased at 0.25 m s(-1). Using label-free tracking of body points and 3D movement analysis, we found that the reduction in feeding rates was related to modulation of the eel's movements, whereby the expected increase in energy expenditure was avoided by reducing exposure and drag. No effects of flow speed on strike speed, reactive distance or vectorial dynamic body acceleration (VeDBA) were found. A foraging model based on the body length extended from the burrow showed correspondence with observations. These findings suggest that as a result of their unique foraging mode, garden eels can occupy self-made burrows in exposed shelter-free sandy bottoms where they can effectively feed on drifting zooplankton.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243655,225,8,NA,jeb243655,Functional response; Fish; Coral reef; Zooplanktivory; Biomechanics
article,Can the behaviour of threespine stickleback parasitized with <i>Schistocephalus solidus</i> be replicated by manipulating host physiology?,"Grecias, Lucie and Hebert, Francois Olivier and Berger, Chloe Suzanne and Barber, Iain and Aubin-Horth, Nadia",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Sticklebacks infected by the parasitic flatworm Schistocephalus solidus show dramatic changes in phenotype, including a loss of species-typical behavioural responses to predators. The timing of host behaviour change coincides with the development of infectivity of the parasite to the final host (a piscivorous bird), making it an ideal model for studying the mechanisms of infection-induced behavioural modification. However, whether the loss of host anti-predator behaviour results from direct manipulation by the parasite, or is a by-product (e.g. host immune response) or side effect of infection (e. g. energetic loss), remains controversial. To understand the physiological mechanisms that generate these behavioural changes, we quantified the behavioural profiles of experimentally infected fish and attempted to replicate these in non-parasitized fish by exposing them to treatments including immunity activation and fasting, or by pharmacologically inhibiting the stress axis. All fish were screened for the following behaviours: activity, water depth preference, sociability, phototaxis, anti-predator response and latency to feed. We were able to change individual behaviours with certain treatments. Our results suggest that the impact of S. solidus on the stickleback might be of a multifactorial nature. The behaviour changes observed in infected fish might result from the combined effects of modifying the serotonergic axis, lack of energy and activation of the immune system.",2017,10.1242/jeb.151456,220,2,237-246,NA,Manipulation; Parasite; Gasterosteus aculeatus; Serotonin; Fluoxetine; Oxazepam; Immunity; Fasting
article,The comparative hydrodynamics of rapid rotation by predatory appendages,"McHenry, M. J. and Anderson, P. S. L. and Van Wassenbergh, S. and Matthews, D. G. and Summers, A. P. and Patek, S. N.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Countless aquatic animals rotate appendages through the water, yet fluid forces are typically modeled with translational motion. To elucidate the hydrodynamics of rotation, we analyzed the raptorial appendages of mantis shrimp (Stomatopoda) using a combination of flume experiments, mathematical modeling and phylogenetic comparative analyses. We found that computationally efficient blade-element models offered an accurate first-order approximation of drag, when compared with a more elaborate computational fluid-dynamic model. Taking advantage of this efficiency, we compared the hydrodynamics of the raptorial appendage in different species, including a newly measured spearing species, Coronis scolopendra. The ultrafast appendages of a smasher species (Odontodactylus scyllarus) were an order of magnitude smaller, yet experienced values of drag-induced torque similar to those of a spearing species (Lysiosquillina maculata). The dactyl, a stabbing segment that can be opened at the distal end of the appendage, generated substantial additional drag in the smasher, but not in the spearer, which uses the segment to capture evasive prey. Phylogenetic comparative analyses revealed that larger mantis shrimp species strike more slowly, regardless of whether they smash or spear their prey. In summary, drag was minimally affected by shape, whereas size, speed and dactyl orientation dominated and differentiated the hydrodynamic forces across species and sizes. This study demonstrates the utility of simple mathematical modeling for comparative analyses and illustrates the multi-faceted consequences of drag during the evolutionary diversification of rotating appendages.",2016,10.1242/jeb.140590,219,21,3399-3411,NA,Drag; Feeding; Kinematics; Torque; Scaling; Phylogenetic comparative methods
article,Multiple spectral channels in branchiopods. II. Role in light-dependent behavior and natural light environments,"Lessios, Nicolas and Rutowski, Ronald L. and Cohen, Jonathan H.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Light is a primary environmental factor used by aquatic invertebrates for depth selection behavior. Many branchiopod crustaceans live in ephemeral aquatic habitats. All branchiopod crustaceans studied to date express four or more visual opsins in their compound eyes. We asked whether two branchiopods, Triops longicaudatus and Streptocephalus mackini, use multiple spectral channels to regulate their position in the water column. At the lowest intensities that elicited photonegative behavior, both species had broad spectral bandwidths, suggesting they use multiple spectral photoreceptor classes. Male S. mackini were more likely to maintain a vertical position 8.0-12.0 cm below the surface than females, independently of whether females were present. Male photopositive behavior at low intensity was restricted to a narrow bandwidth centered at 532 nm, suggesting a single photoreceptor class is used to maintain position above females. We compared ephemeral pools from two regions in Arizona and found that diffuse light attenuation coefficients were two orders of magnitude greater than the most heavily attenuating coastal waters. At less than 1 m of depth, pools were often dimmer than terrestrial habitats under starlight. Soil particle size distribution in each region affected spectral light environments, and behavioral responses of field-caught shrimp were adapted to the spectral properties of their region. The results suggest that branchiopods predominantly use luminance vision summed from multiple spectral photoreceptor classes for depth selection in dim, spectrally variable environments. The neuroanatomical basis for summation is described in a companion paper.",2018,10.1242/jeb.165878,221,10,NA,jeb165878,Pancrustacea; Behavior; Color vision; Electroretinography; Opsin
article,Multiscale flow between the branches and polyps of gorgonians,"Hamlet, Christina L. and Strickland, W. Christopher and Battista, Nicholas and Miller, Laura A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Gorgonians, including sea fans, are soft corals well known for their elaborate branching structure and how they sway in the ocean. This branching structure can modify environmental flows to be beneficial for feeding in a particular range of velocities and, presumably, for a particular size of prey. As water moves through the elaborate branches, it is slowed, and recirculation zones can form downstream of the colony. At the smaller scale, individual polyps that emerge from the branches expand their tentacles, further slowing the flow. At the smallest scale, the tentacles are covered in tiny pinnules where exchange occurs. In this paper, we quantified the gap to diameter ratios for various gorgonians at the scale of the branches, the polyp tentacles and the pinnules. We then used computational fluid dynamics to determine the flow patterns at all three levels of branching. We quantified the leakiness between the branches, tentacles and pinnules over the biologically relevant range of Reynolds numbers and gap-to-diameter ratios, and found that the branches and tentacles can act as either leaky rakes or solid plates depending upon these dimensionless parameters. The pinnules, in contrast, mostly impede the flow. Using an agent-based modeling framework, we quantified plankton capture as a function of the gap-to -diameter ratio of the branches and the Reynolds number. We found that the capture rate depends critically on both morphology and Reynolds number. The results of the study have implications for how gorgonians modify ambient flows for efficient feeding and exchange.",2023,10.1242/jeb.244520,226,5,NA,jeb244520,Gorgonian; Computational fluid dynamics; Feeding flows; Sea fans
article,Zebrafish larvae evade predators by sensing water flow,"Stewart, William J. and Cardenas, Gilberto S. and McHenry, Matthew J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The ability of fish to evade predators is central to the ecology and evolution of a diversity of species. However, it is largely unclear how prey fish detect predators in order to initiate their escape. We tested whether larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) sense the flow created by adult predators of the same species. When placed together in a cylindrical arena, we found that larvae were able to escape 70\% of predator strikes (mean escape probability P-escape=0.7, N=13). However, when we pharmacologically ablated the flow-sensitive lateral line system, larvae were rarely capable of escape (mean P-escape=0.05, N=11). In order to explore the rapid events that facilitate a successful escape, we recorded freely swimming predators and prey using a custom-built camera dolly. This device permitted two-dimensional camera motion to manually track prey and record their escape response with high temporal and spatial resolution. These recordings demonstrated that prey were more than 3 times more likely to evade a suction-feeding predator if they responded before (P-escape=0.53, N=43), rather than after (P-escape=0.15, N=13), a predator's mouth opened, which is a highly significant difference. Therefore, flow sensing plays an essential role in predator evasion by facilitating a response prior to a predator's strike.",2013,10.1242/jeb.072751,216,3,388-398,NA,lateral line system; bow wave; startle response; predator-prey interaction; suction feeding; zebrafish; larvae
article,Structure and function of the nervous system in nectophores of the siphonophore <i>Nanomia bijuga</i>,"Norekian, Tigran P. and Meech, Robert W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Although the bell-shaped nectophores of the siphonophore Nanomia bijuga are clearly specialized for locomotion, their complex neuroanatomy described here testifies to multiple subsidiary functions. These include secretion, by the extensively innervated `flask cells' located around the bell margin, and protection, by the numerous nematocytes that line the nectophore's exposed ridges. The main nerve complex consists of a nerve ring at the base of the bell, an adjacent column-shaped matrix plus two associated nerve projections. At the top of the nectophore the upper nerve tract appears to have a sensory role; on the lower surface a second nerve tract provides a motor input connecting the nectophore with the rest of the colony via a cluster of nerve cells at the stem. N. bijuga is capable of both forward and backward jet-propelled swimming. During backwards swimming the water jet is redirected by the contraction of the Claus' muscle system, part of the muscular velum that fringes the bell aperture. Contractions can be elicited by electrical stimulation of the nectophore surface, even when both upper and lower nerve tracts have been destroyed. Epithelial impulses elicited there, generate slow potentials and action potentials in the velum musculature. Slow potentials arise at different sites around the bell margin and give rise to action potentials in contracting Claus' muscle fibres. A synaptic rather than an electrotonic model more readily accounts for the time course of the slow potentials. During backward swimming, isometrically contracting muscle fibres in the endoderm provide the Claus' fibres with an immobile base.",2020,10.1242/jeb.233494,223,24,NA,jeb233494,Anti-tubulin antibody; Epithelial conduction; Intracellular recording; Nervous system; Swimming behaviour; Unstriated muscle fibres
article,Hiding opaque eyes in transparent organisms: a potential role for larval eyeshine in stomatopod crustaceans,"Feller, K. D. and Cronin, T. W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Opaque screening pigments are a fundamental requisite for preserving resolution in image-forming eyes. Possession of any type of image-forming eye in a transparent, pelagic animal will thus undermine the ability of that animal to be invisible in the water column. Transparent, pelagic animals must therefore deal with the trade-off between the ability to see and the ability of other animals to see them. Stomatopod larvae, like many transparent crustaceans, possess specialized optics in their compound eyes that minimize the volume of the opaque retina. Though the volumes of these retinas are reduced, their opacity remains conspicuous to an observer. The light reflected from structures overlying the retinas of stomatopod crustacean larval eyes, referred to here as eyeshine, is hypothesized to further reduce the visibility of opaque retinas. Blue or green wavelengths of light are most strongly reflected in stomatopod larval eyeshine, suggesting a putative spectral matching to the light environment against which the larval eyes are viewed. We tested the efficacy of stomatopod crustacean larval eyeshine as an ocular camouflaging mechanism by photographing larvae in their natural light environment and analysing the contrast of eyes with the background light. To test for spectral matching between stomatopod larval eyeshine and the background light environment, we characterized the spectrum of eyeshine and calculated its performance using radiometric measurements collected at the time of each photographic series. These results are the first to demonstrate an operative mirror camouflage matched in both spectrum and radiance to the pelagic background light environment.",2014,10.1242/jeb.108076,217,18,3263-3273,NA,Camouflage; Larva; Stomatopod; Visual ecology
article,A mechanical approach to understanding the impact of the nematode <i>Anguillicoloides crassus</i> on the European eel swimbladder,"Currie, Helen A. L. and Martin, Nicholas Flores and Garcia, Gerardo Espindola and Davis, Frances M. and Kemp, Paul S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"One of the most detrimental factors in the drastic decline of the critically endangered European eel (Anguilla anguilla) was the inadvertent introduction of the invasive nematode Anguillicoloides crassus. Infection primarily affects the swimbladder, a gas-filled organ that enables the eel to control its depth in the water. A reduction in swimbladder function may be fatal for eel undergoing their spawning migration to the Sargasso Sea, a journey of over 5000 km. Although the physiological damage caused by this invasive parasite is well studied through the use of quantifiable gross pathological indices, providing a good measure of the swimbladder health status, they cannot separate the role of mechanical and morphological damage. Our study examined the appropriateness of three commonly used indices as a measure of mechanical damage by performing uniaxial tensile tests on swimbladder specimens obtained from an infected eel population. When the test results were compared with the gross pathological indices it was found that thickness correlated most strongly with mechanical damage, both confirming and, more importantly, explaining the counterintuitive findings of earlier work. In a damaged swimbladder, the immune response leads to a trade-off; increasing wall thickness raises the pressure required for organ rupture but decreases strength. The results indicate that for moderate infection the mechanical integrity of the swimbladder can be maintained. For severe infection, however, a reduction in mechanical integrity may reach a tipping point, thereby affecting the successful completion of their oceanic migration.",2020,10.1242/jeb.219808,223,17,NA,jeb219808,European eel; Mechanical damage; Parasite; Swimbladder
article,"Dietary phosphate affects food selection, post-ingestive phosphorus fate, and performance of a polyphagous herbivore","Cease, Arianne J. and Fay, Michelle and Elser, James J. and Harrison, Jon F.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Comparisons of the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus (P) content of plants and insect herbivores suggests that P limitation and herbivore foraging to balance P intake could be common. However, the lack of synthetic diets for testing the effects of lower ranges of dietary P has been a major impediment to experimental assessment of the ecological importance of, and physiological responses to, P limitation for terrestrial herbivores. We manipulated dietary P content (\%P) over its observed range in terrestrial foliage using artificial diets containing near-optimal content of other nutrients for the grasshopper Schistocerca americana. Over much of the ecologically relevant range, when consuming single diets over a lifetime, higher P stimulated growth rates and increased survival, with an optimal dietary \%P of 0.25-0.50\% when measured throughout development. Excessive dietary P (1\%) reduced growth and survival. However, with only short-term (3 day) confinement to single diets, dietary P had no effect on food consumption or growth rates. During these short exposures, fifth (but not third) instar hoppers increased the proportion of P excreted relative to P assimilated as dietary P increased. Target experiments demonstrated that, when given a choice, grasshoppers select among foods to attain a P intake target of 0.6\%. These data suggest that P limitation could be common for terrestrial insect herbivores and that they can exhibit ingestive and post-ingestive mechanisms to attain sufficient but not excessive P.",2016,10.1242/jeb.126847,219,1,64-72,NA,Ecological stoichiometry; Geometric framework; Grasshopper; Phosphate; Synthetic diet; Diet choice
article,Indefatigable: an erect coralline alga is highly resistant to fatigue,"Denny, Mark and Mach, Katharine and Tepler, Sarah and Martone, Patrick",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Intertidal organisms are subjected to intense hydrodynamic forces as waves break on the shore. These repeated insults can cause a plant or animal's structural materials to fatigue and fail, even though no single force would be sufficient to break the organism. Indeed, the survivorship and maximum size of at least one species of seaweed is set by the accumulated effects of small forces rather than the catastrophic imposition of a single lethal force. One might suppose that fatigue would be especially potent in articulated coralline algae, in which the strain of the entire structure is concentrated in localized joints, the genicula. However, previous studies of joint morphology suggest an alternative hypothesis. Each geniculum is composed of a single tier of cells, which are attached at their ends to the calcified segments of the plant (the intergenicula) but have minimal connection to each other along their lengths. This lack of neighborly attachment potentially allows the weak interfaces between cells to act as ` crack stoppers', inhibiting the growth of fatigue cracks. We tested this possibility by repeatedly loading fronds of Calliarthron cheilosporioides, a coralline alga common on wave-washed shores in California. When repeatedly loaded to 50-80\% of its breaking strength, C. cheilosporioides commonly survives more than a million stress cycles, with a record of 51 million. We show how this extraordinary fatigue resistance interacts with the distribution of wave-induced water velocities to set the limits to size in this species.",2013,10.1242/jeb.091264,216,20,3772-3780,NA,fatigue failure; Calliarthron cheilosporioides; hydrodynamic forces; size limits; intertidal ecology
article,Chromogenic behaviors of the Humboldt squid (<i>Dosidicus gigas</i>) studied <i>in situ</i> with an animal-borne video package,"Rosen, Hannah and Gilly, William and Bell, Lauren and Abernathy, Kyler and Marshall, Greg",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Dosidicus gigas (Humboldt or jumbo flying squid) is an economically and ecologically influential species, yet little is known about its natural behaviors because of difficulties in studying this active predator in its oceanic environment. By using an animal-borne video package, National Geographic's Crittercam, we were able to observe natural behaviors in free-swimming D. gigas in the Gulf of California with a focus on color-generating (chromogenic) behaviors. We documented two dynamic displays without artificial lighting at depths of up to 70 m. One dynamic pattern, termed `flashing' is characterized by a global oscillation (2-4 Hz) of body color between white and red. Flashing was almost always observed when other squid were visible in the video frame, and this behavior presumably represents intraspecific signaling. Amplitude and frequency of flashing can be modulated, and the phase relationship with another squid can also be rapidly altered. Another dynamic display termed `flickering' was observed whenever flashing was not occurring. This behavior is characterized by irregular wave-like activity in neighboring patches of chromatophores, and the resulting patterns mimic reflections of down-welled light in the water column, suggesting that this behavior may provide a dynamic type of camouflage. Rapid and global pauses in flickering, often before a flashing episode, indicate that flickering is under inhibitory neural control. Although flashing and flickering have not been described in other squid, functional similarities are evident with other species.",2015,10.1242/jeb.114157,218,2,265-275,NA,Cephalopod; Chromatophore; Flashing; Signaling; Flickering; Crypsis
article,Rapid depth perception in hunting archerfish. I. The predictive C-starts use an independent estimate of target height,"Reinel, Caroline P. and Schuster, Stefan",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Archerfish dislodge aerial prey with water jets and use their predictive C-starts to secure it. Their C-starts turn the fish to the later point of impact and set the speed so that the fish arrive just in time. The starts are adjusted on the basis of information on speed, direction, timing and honzontal start position of prey movement - sampled during less than 100 ms after prey starts falling. Presently, it is unclear whether one essential parameter, the initial height of prey, can also be determined during this brief sampling time. Shooters and probably also observing bystanders already know target height - used to hit and to shape their jets - and would simply have to feed this information into their C-start circuitry. We challenged archerfish by launching initially invisible prey objects either from the expected height level, at which the fish were looking and at which they fired shots, or from more lateral positions and a lower or higher initial height. The arrangement was designed so that an analysis of the direction and the linear speed chosen by the starting fish could determine whether the C-start information is based on the expected height oron the actual height, which can be detected only after hidden prey has begun falling. Our findings demonstrate that the fish quickly estimate initial height dunng the initial falling phase of prey and do not simply use the expected height level to which they were cued.",2018,10.1242/jeb.177345,221,14,NA,NA,Depth vision; Visual perception; Predation; Fast-start; Decision making
article,The sonar beam of <i>Macrophyllum macrophyllum</i> implies ecological adaptation under phylogenetic constraint,"Olsen, Mads Nedergaard and Surlykke, Annemarie and Jakobsen, Lasse",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"All animals are adapted to their ecology within the bounds of their evolutionary heritage. Echolocating bats clearly show such adaptations and boundaries through their biosonar call design. Adaptations include not only the overall time-frequency structure, but also the shape of the emitted echolocation beam. Macrophyllum macrophyllum is unique within the phyllostomid family, being the only species to predominantly hunt for insects in the open, on or above water, and as such it presents an interesting case for comparing the impact of phylogeny and ecology as it originates from a family of low-intensity, high-directionality gleaning bats, but occupies a niche dominated by very loud and substantially less-directional bats. Here, we examined the sonar beam pattern of M. macrophyllum in the field and in a flight room and compared it to closely related species with very different feeding ecology and to that of the niche-sharing but distantly related Myotis daubentonii. Our results show that M. macrophyllum uses higher source levels and emits less- directional calls than other phyllostomids. In the field, its call directionality is comparable to M. daubentonii, but in the flight room, M. macrophyllum is substantially more directional. Hence our results indicate that ecology influences the emitted call, pushing the bats to emit a louder and broader beam than other phyllostomids, but that phylogeny does limit the emitted intensity and flexibility of the overall beam pattern.",2020,10.1242/jeb.223909,223,12,NA,jeb223909,Echolocation; Ecological adaptation; Sonar beam; Source level
article,Royal knifefish generate powerful suction feeding through large neurocranial elevation and high epaxial muscle power,"Li, Ellen Y. and Kaczmarek, Elska B. and Olsen, Aaron M. and Brainerd, Elizabeth L. and Camp, Ariel L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Suction feeding in ray-finned fishes involves powerful buccal cavity expansion to accelerate water and food into the mouth. Previous XROMMstudies in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) and channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) have shown that more than 90\% of suction power in high performance strikes comes from the axial musculature. Thus, the shape of the axial muscles and skeleton may affect suction feeding mechanics. Royal knifefish (Chitala blanci) have an unusual postcranial morphology, with a ventrally flexed vertebral column and relatively large mass of epaxial muscle. Based on their body shape, we hypothesized that royal knifefish would generate high power strikes by utilizing large neurocranial elevation, vertebral column extension and epaxial shortening. As predicted, C. blanci generated high suction expansion power compared with the other three species studied to date (up to 160 W), which was achieved by increasing both the rate of volume change and the intraoral subambient pressure. The large epaxial muscle (25\% of body mass) shortened at high velocities to produce large neurocranial elevation and vertebral extension (up to 41 deg, combined), as well as high muscle mass-specific power (up to 800 W kg(-1)). For the highest power strikes, axial muscles generated 95\% of the power, and 64\% of the axial muscle mass consisted of the epaxial muscles. The epaxial-dominated suction expansion of royal knifefish supports our hypothesis that postcranial morphology may be a strong predictor of suction feeding biomechanics.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244294,225,11,NA,jeb244294,XROMM; Fluoromicrometry; Muscle strain; Buccal pressure; Body shape; Buccal volume
article,Puncture performance tests reveal distinct feeding modes in pinniped teeth,"Peredo, Carlos Mauricio and Ingle, Danielle N. and Marshall, Christopher D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Marine mammals have undergone a dramatic series of morphological transformations throughout their evolutionary history that facilitated their ecological transition to life in the water. Pinnipeds are a diverse clade of marine mammals that evolved from terrestrial carnivorans in the Oligocene (similar to 27 million years ago). However, pinnipeds have secondarily lost the dental innovations emblematic of mammalian and carnivoran feeding, such as a talonid basin or shearing carnassials. Modern pinnipeds do not masticate their prey, but can reduce prey size through chopping behavior. Typically, small prey are swallowed whole. Nevertheless, pinnipeds display a wide breadth of morphology of the post-canine teeth. We investigated the relationship between dental morphology and pinniped feeding by measuring the puncture performance of the cheek-teeth of seven extant pinniped genera. Puncture performance was measured as the maximum force and the maximum energy required to puncture a standardized prey item (Loligo sp.). We report significant differences in the puncture performance values across the seven genera, and identify three distinct categories based on cheek-teeth morphology and puncture performance: effective, ineffective and moderate puncturers. In addition, we measured the overall complexity of the tooth row using two different metrics, orientation patch count rotated (OPCR) and relief index (RFI). Neither metric of complexity predicted puncture performance. Finally, we discuss these results in the broader context of known pinniped feeding strategies and lay the groundwork for subsequent efforts to explore the ecological variation of specific dental morphologies.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244296,225,11,NA,jeb244296,Biomechanics; Feeding; Marine mammals; Pinnipeds
article,Short-term colour vision plasticity on the reef: changes in opsin expression under varying light conditions differ between ecologically distinct fish species,"Luehrmann, Martin and Stieb, Sara M. and Carleton, Karen L. and Pietzker, Alisa and Cheney, Karen L. and Marshall, N. Justin",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Vision mediates important behavioural tasks such as mate choice, escape from predators and foraging. In fish, photoreceptors are generally tuned to specific visual tasks and/or to their light environment, according to depth or water colour to ensure optimal performance. Evolutionary mechanisms acting on genes encoding opsin, the protein component of the photopigment, can influence the spectral sensitivity of photoreceptors. Opsin genes are known to respond to environmental conditions on a number of time scales, including short time frames due to seasonal variation, or through longer-term evolutionary tuning. There is also evidence for `on-the-fly' adaptations in adult fish in response to rapidly changing environmental conditions; however, results are contradictory. Here, we investigated the ability of three reef fish species that belong to two ecologically distinct families, yellow-striped cardinalfish (Ostorhinchus cyanosoma), Ambon damselfish (Pomacentrus amboinensis) and lemon damselfish (Pomacentrus moluccensis), to alter opsin gene expression as an adaptation to short-term (weeks to months) changes of environmental light conditions, and attempted to characterize the underlying expression regulation principles. We report the ability for all species to alter opsin gene expression within months and even a few weeks, suggesting that opsin expression in adult reef fish is not static. Furthermore, we found that changes in opsin expression in single cones generally occurred more rapidly than in double cones, and identified different responses of RH2 opsin gene expression between the ecologically distinct reef fish families. Quantum catch correlation analysis suggested different regulation mechanisms for opsin expression dependent on gene class.",2018,10.1242/jeb.175281,221,22,NA,jeb175281,Visual ecology; Diurnal/nocturnal feeders; Phenotypic variation; Adaptation; Teleost; Spectral tuning
article,Not just shades of grey: life is full of colour for the ocellate river stingray (<i>Potamotrygon motoro</i>),"Schluessel, Vera and Rick, Ingolf P. and Seifert, Friederike Donata and Baumann, Christina and Davies, Wayne Iwan Lee",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Previous studies have shown that marine stingrays have the anatomical and physiological basis for colour vision, with cone spectral sensitivity in the blue to green range of the visible spectrum. Behavioural studies on Glaucostegus typus also showed that blue and grey can be perceived and discriminated. The present study is the first to assess visual opsin genetics in the ocellate river stingray (Potamotrygon motoro) and test whether individuals perceive colour in two alternative forced choice experiments. Retinal transcriptome profiling using RNA-Seq and quantification demonstrated the presence of Iws and rh2 cone opsin genes and a highly expressed single rod (rhi) opsin gene. Spectral tuning analysis predicted these vitamin A(1)-based visual photopigments to exhibit spectral absorbance maxima at 461 nm (rh2), 496 nm (rh1) and 555 nm (lws); suggesting the presence of dichromacy in this species. Indeed, P. motoro demonstrates the potential to be equally sensitive to wavelengths from 380 to 600 nm of the visible spectrum. Behavioural results showed that red and green plates, as well as blue and yellow plates, were readily discriminated based on colour; however, brightness differences also played a part in the discrimination of blue and yellow. Red hues of different brightness were distinguished significantly above chance level from one another. In conclusion, the genetic and behavioural results support prior data on marine stingrays. However, this study suggests that freshwater stingrays of the family Potamotrygonidae may have a visual colour system that has ecologically adapted to a riverine habitat.",2021,10.1242/jeb.226142,224,9,NA,jeb226142,Elasmobranch; Stingray; Behaviour; Cognition; Colour vision; Colour discrimination; Opsins
article,"Visual system development of the spotted unicornfish, <i>Naso brevirostris</i> (Acanthuridae)","Tettamanti, Valerio and de Busserolles, Fanny and Lecchini, David and Marshall, N. Justin and Cortesi, Fabio",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Ontogenetic changes of the visual system are often correlated with shifts in habitat and feeding behaviour of animals. Coral reef fishes begin their lives in the pelagic zone and then migrate to the reef. This habitat transition frequently involves a change in diet and light environment as well as major morphological modifications. The spotted unicornfish, Naso brevirostris, is known to shift diet from zooplankton to algae and back to mainly zooplankton when transitioning from larval to juvenile and then to adult stages. Concurrently, N. brevirostris also moves from an open pelagic to a coral-associated habitat before migrating up in the water column when reaching adulthood. Using retinal mapping techniques, we discovered that the distribution and density of ganglion and photoreceptor cells in N. brevirostris changes primarily during the transition from the larval to the juvenile stage, with only minor modifications thereafter. Similarly, visual gene (opsin) expression based on RNA sequencing, although qualitatively similar between stages (all fish mainly expressed the same three cone opsins; SWS2B, RH2B, RH2A), also showed the biggest quantitative difference when transitioning from larvae to juveniles. The juvenile stage in particular seems mismatched with its reef-associated ecology, which may be due to this stage only lasting a fraction of the lifespan of these fish. Hence, the visual ontogeny found in N. brevirostris is very different from the progressive changes found in other reef fishes, calling for a thorough analysis of visual system development of the reef fish community.",2019,10.1242/jeb.209916,222,24,NA,jeb209916,Visual ecology; Teleosts; Fish; Ontogeny; Opsin; Retina; Visual acuity
article,Brief exposure to intense turbulence induces a sustained life-history shift in echinoids,"Ferner, Matthew C. and Hodin, Jason and Ng, Gabriel and Gaylord, Brian",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In coastal ecosystems, attributes of fluid motion can prompt animal larvae to rise or sink in the water column and to select microhabitats within which they attach and commit to a benthic existence. In echinoid (sea urchin and sand dollar) larvae living along wave-exposed shorelines, intense turbulence characteristic of surf zones can cause individuals to undergo an abrupt life-history shift characterized by precocious entry into competence - the stage at which larvae will settle and complete metamorphosis in response to local cues. However, the mechanistic details of this turbulence-triggered onset of competence remain poorly defined. Here, we evaluate in a series of laboratory experiments the time course of this turbulence effect, both the rapidity with which it initiates and whether it perdures. We found that larvae become competent with turbulence exposures as brief as 30 s, with longer exposures inducing a greater proportion of larvae to become competent. Intriguingly, larvae can remember such exposures for a protracted period (at least 24 h), a pattern reminiscent of long-term potentiation. Turbulence also induces short-term behavioral responses that last less than 30 min, including cessation of swimming, that facilitate sinking and thus contact of echinoid larvae with the substratum. Together, these results yield a novel perspective on how larvae find their way to suitable adult habitat at the critical settlement transition, and also open new experimental opportunities to elucidate the mechanisms by which planktonic animals respond to fluid motion.",2019,10.1242/jeb.187351,222,4,NA,jeb187351,Dendraster excentricus; Hydrodynamics; Larval settlement; Sensory ecology; Strongylocentrotus purpuratus; Surf zone
article,The mechanical properties of the mantle muscle of European cuttlefish (<i>Sepia officinalis</i>),"Gladman, Nicholas W. and Askew, Graham N.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The circular muscles surrounding the mantle cavity of European cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) generate the mechanical power to compress the cavity, forcing a jet of water out of the funnel, propelling the animal during jet propulsion swimming. During ontogeny, jetting frequency decreases in adults compared with juveniles, and this is expected to be reflected in the contractile properties of the locomotory muscles. To develop greater insight into how the locomotion of these animals is powered during ontogeny, we determined the mechanical properties of bundles of muscle fascicles during isometric, isotonic and cyclic length changes in vitro, at two life stages: juveniles and adults. The twitch kinetics were faster in juveniles than in adults (twitch rise time 257 ms compared with 371 ms; half-twitch relaxation 257 ms compared with 677 ms in juveniles and adults, respectively); however, twitch and tetanic stress, the maximum velocity of shortening and curvature of the force-velocity relationship did not differ. Under cyclic conditions, net power exhibited an inverted U-shaped relationship with cycle frequency in both juveniles and adults; the frequency at which maximum net power was achieved was shifted to lower cycle frequencies with increased maturity, which is consistent with the slower contraction and relaxation kinetics in adults compared with juveniles. The cycle frequency at which peak power was achieved during cyclical contractions in vitro was found to match that seen in vivo in juveniles, suggesting power is being maximised during jet propulsion swimming.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244977,225,23,NA,jeb244977,Cephalopod; Muscle mechanics; Ontogeny; Power output
article,A novel intramandibular joint facilitates feeding versatility in the sixbar distichodus,"Martinez, Christopher M. and Tovar, Angelly J. and Wainwright, Peter C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The intramandibular joint (IMJ) is a secondary point of movement between the two major bones of the lower jaw. It has independently evolved in several groups of teleost fishes, each time representing a departure from related species in which the mandible functions as a single structure rotating only at the quadratomandibular joint (QMJ). In this study, we examine kinematic consequences of the IMJ novelty in a freshwater characiform fish, the herbivorous Distichodus sexfasciatus. We combine traditional kinematic approaches with trajectory-based analysis of motion shapes to compare patterns of prey capture movements during substrate biting, the fish's native feeding mode, and suction of prey from the water column. We find that the IMJ enables complex jaw motions and contributes to feeding versatility by allowing the fish to modulate its kinematics in response to different prey and to various scenarios of jaw-substrate interaction. Implications of the IMJ include context-dependent movements of lower versus upper jaws, enhanced lower jaw protrusion, and the ability to maintain contact between the teeth and substrate throughout the jaw closing or biting phase of the motion. The IMJ in D. sexfasciatus appears to be an adaptation for removing attached benthic prey, consistent with its function in other groups that have evolved the joint. This study builds on our understanding of the role of the IMJ during prey capture and provides insights into broader implications of the innovative trait.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243621,225,2,NA,jeb243621,Innovation; Functional morphology; Geometric morphometrics; Kinematics; Novelty
article,Facultative mobilization of eggshell calcium promotes embryonic growth in an oviparous snake,"Stewart, James R. and Pyles, Rebecca A. and Mathis, Aitlyn A. and Ecay, Tom W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The mineralized eggshell of Reptilia was a major innovation in the evolution of the amniotic egg. Inorganic components strengthen the eggshell and are a potential source of nutrients to developing embryos. Embryos of oviparous reptiles do extract calcium from eggshells but vary interspecifically in exploitation of this resource. The pattern of embryonic calcium nutrition of the corn snake, Pantherophis guttatus, is similar to a diversity of squamate species: embryos obtain most calcium from yolk, yet also mobilize calcium from the eggshell. We tested the hypothesis that embryonic development is not dependent on eggshell calcium by manipulating calcium availability. We peeled away the outer calcareous layer of the eggshell of recently oviposited eggs; control eggs were left intact. Eggs were sampled periodically and calcium content of egg compartments (embryo, yolk, eggshell) was measured. We also analyzed skeletal development and size of hatchlings. There was no difference in survivorship or length of incubation between treatments. However, hatchlings from intact eggs contained more calcium and were larger in mass and length than siblings from peeled eggs. There were no observable differences in ossification but hatchlings from intact eggs had larger skeletal elements (skull, vertebrae). Our results indicate that mobilization of eggshell calcium is not a requirement for embryonic development of P. guttatus and that embryos augment yolk calcium by extracting calcium from the eggshell. This pattern of embryonic calcium nutrition would favor embryos with a greater capacity to mobilize calcium from the eggshell by promoting growth and thereby potentially enhancing hatchling fitness.",2019,10.1242/jeb.193565,222,3,NA,193565,Oviparity; Eggshell; Skeletogenesis; Embryonic nutrition
article,Pelvic girdle mobility of cryptodire and pleurodire turtles during walking and swimming,"Mayerl, Christopher J. and Brainerd, Elizabeth L. and Blob, Richard W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Movements of the pelvic girdle facilitate terrestrial locomotor performance in a wide range of vertebrates by increasing hind limb excursion and stride length. The extent to which pelvic movements contribute to limb excursion in turtles is unclear because the bony shell surrounding the body presents a major obstacle to their visualization. In the Cryptodira, which are one of the two major lineages of turtles, pelvic anatomy indicates the potential for rotation inside the shell. However, in the Pleurodira, the other major suborder, the pelvis shows a derived fusion to the shell, preventing pelvic motion. In addition, most turtles use their hind limbs for propulsion during swimming as well as walking, and the different locomotor demands between water and land could lead to differences in the contributions of pelvic rotation to limb excursion in each habitat. To test these possibilities, we used X-ray reconstruction of moving morphology (XROMM) to compare pelvic mobility and femoral motion during walking and swimming between representative species of cryptodire (Pseudemys concinna) and pleurodire (Emydura subglobosa) turtles. We found that the pelvis yawed substantially in cryptodires during walking and, to a lesser extent, during swimming. These movements contributed to greater femoral protraction during both walking and swimming in cryptodires when compared with pleurodires. Although factors related to the origin of pelvic-shell fusion in pleurodires are debated, its implications for their locomotor function may contribute to the restriction of this group to primarily aquatic habits.",2016,10.1242/jeb.141622,219,17,2650-2658,NA,Locomotion; Biomechanics; XROMM; Kinematics; Long-axis rotation
article,Prolonged fasting activates Nrf2 in post-weaned elephant seals,"Vazquez-Medina, Jose Pablo and Sonanez-Organis, Jose G. and Rodriguez, Ruben and Viscarra, Jose A. and Nishiyama, Akira and Crocker, Daniel E. and Ortiz, Rudy M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Elephant seals naturally experience prolonged periods of absolute food and water deprivation (fasting). In humans, rats and mice, prolonged food deprivation activates the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and increases oxidative damage. In elephant seals, prolonged fasting activates RAS without increasing oxidative damage likely due to an increase in antioxidant defenses. The mechanism leading to the upregulation of antioxidant defenses during prolonged fasting remains elusive. Therefore, we investigated whether prolonged fasting activates the redox-sensitive transcription factor Nrf2, which controls the expression of antioxidant genes, and if such activation is potentially mediated by systemic increases in RAS. Blood and skeletal muscle samples were collected from seals fasting for 1, 3, 5 and 7. weeks. Nrf2 activity and nuclear content increased by 76\% and 167\% at week 7. Plasma angiotensin II (Ang II) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) were 5000\% and 250\% higher at week 7 than at week 1. Phosphorylation of Smad2, an effector of Ang II and TGF signaling, increased by 120\% at week 7 and by 84\% in response to intravenously infused Ang II. NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) mRNA expression, which is controlled by smad proteins, increased 430\% at week 7, while Nox4 protein expression, which can activate Nrf2, was 170\% higher at week 7 than at week 1. These results demonstrate that prolonged fasting activates Nrf2 in elephant seals and that RAS stimulation can potentially result in increased Nox4 through Smad phosphorylation. The results also suggest that Nox4 is essential to sustain the hormetic adaptive response to oxidative stress in fasting seals.",2013,10.1242/jeb.081927,216,15,2870-2878,NA,antioxidants; hormesis; Nox4; oxidative stress; starvation; renin-angiotensin system
article,Functional morphology of terrestrial prey capture in salamandrid salamanders,"Stinson, Charlotte M. and Deban, Stephen M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Salamanders use the hyobranchial apparatus and its associated musculature for tongue projection on land and for suction feeding in water. Hyobranchial apparatus composition and morphology vary across species, and different morphologies are better suited for feeding in aquatic versus terrestrial environments. We hypothesize that differences in hyobranchial morphology result in functional trade-offs in feeding performance. We predict that semi-aquatic and aquatic salamandrids with hyobranchial morphology suited for aquatic feeding will have lower performance, in terms of tongue-projection distance, velocity, acceleration and power, compared with terrestrial salamandrids when feeding in a terrestrial environment. We found that semi-aquatic and aquatic newts had lower velocity, acceleration and muscle-mass-specific power of tongue projection when compared with the terrestrial salamanders Chioglossa lusitanica and Salamandra salamandra. The fully aquatic newt, Paramesotriton labiatus, has a robust, heavily mineralized hyobranchial apparatus and was unable to project its tongue during terrestrial feeding, and instead exhibited suction-feeding movements better suited for aquatic feeding. Conversely, terrestrial species have slender, cartilaginous hyobranchial apparatus and enlarged tongue pads that coincided with greater tongue-projection distance, velocity, acceleration and power. Chioglossa lusitanica exhibited extreme tongue-projection performance, similar to that seen in elastically projecting plethodontid salamanders; muscle-mass-specific power of tongue projection exceeded 2200 W kg(-1), more than 350 times that of the next highest performer, S. salamandra, which reached 6.3 W kg(-1). These findings reveal that two fully terrestrial salamandrids have morphological specializations that yield greater tongue-projection performance compared with species that naturally feed in both aquatic and terrestrial environments.",2017,10.1242/jeb.164285,220,21,3896-3907,NA,Newt; Feeding; Tongue projection; Trade-offs; Salamandridae
article,One rhinophore probably provides sufficient sensory input for odour-based navigation by the nudibranch mollusc <i>Tritonia diomedea</i>,"McCullagh, Gregory B. and Bishop, Cory D. and Wyeth, Russell C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Tritonia diomedea (synonymous with Tritonia tetraquetra) navigates in turbulent odour plumes, crawling upstream towards prey and downstream to avoid predators. This is probably accomplished by odour-gated rheotaxis, but other possibilities have not been excluded. Our goal was to test whether T. diomedea uses odour-gated rheotaxis and to simultaneously determine which of the cephalic sensory organs (rhinophores and oral veil) are required for navigation. In a first experiment, slugs showed no coherent responses to streams of odour directed at single rhinophores. In a second experiment, navigation in prey and predator odour plumes was compared between animals with unilateral rhinophore lesions, denervated oral veils, or combined unilateral rhinophore lesions and denervated oral veils. In all treatments, animals navigated in a similar manner to that of control and sham-operated animals, indicating that a single rhinophore provides sufficient sensory input for navigation (assuming that a distributed flow measurement system would also be affected by the denervations). Amongst various potential navigational strategies, only odour-gated positive rheotaxis can produce the navigation tracks we observed in prey plumes while receiving input from a single sensor. Thus, we provide strong evidence that T. diomedea uses odour-gated rheotaxis in attractive odour plumes, with odours and flow detected by the rhinophores. In predator plumes, slugs turned downstream to varying degrees rather than orienting directly downstream for crawling, resulting in greater dispersion for negative rheotaxis in aversive plumes. These conclusions are the first explicit confirmation of odour-gated rheotaxis as a navigational strategy in gastropods and are also a foundation for exploring the neural circuits that mediate odour-gated rheotaxis.",2014,10.1242/jeb.111153,217,23,4149-4158,NA,Chemosensation; Gastropod; Navigation; Odour-gated rheotaxis; Predator odour; Prey odour
article,Kinematics of the ribbon fin in hovering and swimming of the electric ghost knifefish,"Ruiz-Torres, Ricardo and Curet, Oscar M. and Lauder, George V. and MacIver, Malcolm A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Weakly electric knifefish are exceptionally maneuverable swimmers. In prior work, we have shown that they are able to move their entire body omnidirectionally so that they can rapidly reach prey up to several centimeters away. Consequently, in addition to being a focus of efforts to understand the neural basis of sensory signal processing in vertebrates, knifefish are increasingly the subject of biomechanical analysis to understand the coupling of signal acquisition and biomechanics. Here, we focus on a key subset of the knifefish's omnidirectional mechanical abilities: hovering in place, and swimming forward at variable speed. Using high-speed video and a markerless motion capture system to capture fin position, we show that hovering is achieved by generating two traveling waves, one from the caudal edge of the fin and one from the rostral edge, moving toward each other. These two traveling waves overlap at a nodal point near the center of the fin, cancelling fore-aft propulsion. During forward swimming at low velocities, the caudal region of the fin continues to have counter-propagating waves, directly retarding forward movement. The gait transition from hovering to forward swimming is accompanied by a shift in the nodal point toward the caudal end of the fin. While frequency varies significantly to increase speed at low velocities, beyond approximately one body length per second, the frequency stays near 10 Hz, and amplitude modulation becomes more prominent. A coupled central pattern generator model is able to reproduce qualitative features of fin motion and suggest hypotheses regarding the fin's neural control.",2013,10.1242/jeb.076471,216,5,823-834,NA,aquatic locomotion; gymnotiform swimming; swimming gait transition
article,Nest box exploration may stimulate breeding physiology and alter mRNA expression in the medial preoptic area of female European starlings,"Spool, Jeremy A. and Jay, Melannie D. and Riters, Lauren V.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Environmental resources are proposed to fine-tune the timing of breeding, yet how they may do so remains unclear. In female European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), nest cavities are limited resources that are necessary for breeding. Females that explore nest cavities, compared with those that do not, readily perform sexually motivated behaviors. We assigned female starlings to aviaries with: (1) no nest boxes, (2) nest boxes, or (3) nest boxes, plants, flowing water, insects and berries to test the hypothesis that environmental resources alter neural systems to stimulate mating behavior. Compared with other females, females that were housed with and explored nest boxes had higher estradiol, higher preproenkephalin (PENK) mRNA and lower levels of D1 and D2 dopamine receptor mRNA in the medial preoptic area (mPOA); a region in which opioids and dopamine modify female sexual behaviors and sexual motivation. Additionally, in the mPOA, PENK and tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA positively predicted, whereas estrogen receptor beta mRNA negatively predicted, nest box exploration. In the ventromedial hypothalamus (a region in which estradiol acts to stimulate sexual behavior), estrogen receptor alpha mRNA was highest in females that had access to but did not explore nest cavities. It is likely that seasonal increases in estradiol modify mRNA in the mPOA to facilitate nest cavity exploration. It is also possible that nest cavity exploration further alters gene expression in the mPOA, functioning to coordinate mating with resource availability. Thus, nest cavity exploration may be a form of self-stimulation that alters neural systems to fine-tune sexual behavior.",2018,10.1242/jeb.174441,221,11,NA,jeb174441,Nest cavity; Limited resource; Opioid; Dopamine; Estradiol; Avian

C. and Mullins, Gray and Stokes, Michael and Huber, Daniel R. and Winters, Daniel and Motta, Philip J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Perhaps the most striking feature of billfishes is the extreme elongation of the premaxillary bones forming their rostra. Surprisingly, the exact role of this structure in feeding is still controversial. The goal of this study is to investigate the use of the rostrum from a functional, biomechanical and morphological standpoint to ultimately infer its possible role during feeding. Using beam theory, experimental and theoretical loading tests were performed on the rostra from two morphologically different billfish, the blue marlin (Makaira nigricans) and the swordfish (Xiphias gladius). Two loading regimes were applied (dorsoventral and lateral) to simulate possible striking behaviors. Histological samples and material properties of the rostra were obtained along their lengths to further characterize structure and mechanical performance. Intraspecific results show similar stress distributions for most regions of the rostra, suggesting that this structure may be designed to withstand continuous loadings with no particular region of stress concentration. Although material stiffness increased distally, flexural stiffness increased proximally owing to higher second moment of area. The blue marlin rostrum was stiffer and resisted considerably higher loads for both loading planes compared with that of the swordfish. However, when a continuous load along the rostrum was considered, simulating the rostrum swinging through the water, swordfish exhibited lower stress and drag during lateral loading. Our combined results suggest that the swordfish rostrum is suited for lateral swiping to incapacitate their prey, whereas the blue marlin rostrum is better suited to strike prey from a wider variety of directions.",2015,10.1242/jeb.106146,218,6,824-836,NA,Billfish feeding; Biomechanics; Functional morphology

Attached vortices are produced by relatively large objects that block freestream flow, which fish routinely utilize for flow refuging. To test how flow refuging and the potential harvesting of energy (as seen in Karman gaiting) vary across size classes in adult, 22 cm; n=4 per size class), we used a water flume (4100 l; freestream flow at 65 cm s-1) and created vortices using 45 deg wing dams of varying size (small, 15 cm; medium, 31 cm; large, 48 cm). We monitored microhabitat selection and swimming kinematics of individual trout and measured the flow field in the wake of wing dams using time-resolved particle image velocimetry (PIV). Trout of each size class preferentially swam in vortices rather than the freestream, but the capacity to flow refuge varied according to the ratio of vortex width to fish length (WV:LF). Consistent refuging behavior was exhibited when WV:LF >= 1.5. All size classes exhibited increased wavelength and Strouhal number and decreased tailbeat frequency within vortices compared with freestream, suggesting that swimming in vortices requires less power output. In 17\% of the trials, fish preferentially swam in a manner that suggests energy harvesting from the shear layer.

W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Rhodopsin (rh1) is the visual pigment expressed in rod photoreceptors of vertebrates that is responsible for initiating the critical first step of dim-light vision. Rhodopsin is usually a single copy gene; however, we previously discovered a novel rhodopsin-like gene expressed in the zebrafish retina, rh1-2, which we identified as a functional photosensitive pigment that binds 11-cis retinal and activates in response to light. Here, we localized expression of rh1-2 in the zebrafish retina to a subset of peripheral photoreceptor cells, which indicates a partially overlapping expression pattern with rh1. We also expressed, purified and characterized Rh1-2, including investigation of the stability of the biologically active intermediate. Using fluorescence spectroscopy, we found the half-life of the rate of retinal release of Rh1-2 following photoactivation to be more similar to that of the visual pigment rhodopsin than to the non-visual pigment exo-rhodopsin (exorh), which releases retinal around 5 times faster. Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses show that rh1-2 has ancient origins within teleost fishes, is under similar selective pressure to rh1, and likely experienced a burst of positive selection following its duplication and divergence from rh1. These findings indicate that rh1-2 is another functional visual rhodopsin gene, which contradicts the prevailing notion that visual rhodopsin is primarily found as a single copy gene within ray-finned fishes. The reasons for retention of this duplicate gene, as well as possible functional consequences for the visual system, are discussed.",2017,10.1242/jeb.145953,220,2,294-303,NA,Visual pigment; Vision; Gene duplication; GPCR; Teleost

In this study, we investigate the amphibious hearing capabilities of ringed seals to provide auditory profiles for this species across the full range of hearing. Using psychophysical methods with two trained ringed seals, detection thresholds for narrowband signals were measured under quiet, carefully controlled environmental conditions to generate aerial and underwater audiograms. Masked underwater thresholds were measured in the presence of octave-band noise to determine critical ratios. Results indicate that ringed seals possess hearing abilities comparable to those of spotted seals (Phoca largha) and harbor seals (Phoca vitulina), and considerably better than previously reported for ringed and harp seals. Best sensitivity was 49 dB re. 1 mu Pa (12.8 kHz) in water, and -12 dB re. 20 mu Pa (4.5 kHz) in air, rivaling the acute hearing abilities of some fully aquatic and terrestrial species in their respective media. Critical ratio measurements ranged from 14 dB at 0.1 kHz to 31 dB at 25.6 kHz, suggesting that ringed seals - like other true seals - can efficiently extract signals from background noise across a broad range of frequencies.

For this study, two independent yet complementary techniques for hearing assessment, i.e. behavioral and electrophysiological audiometry, were employed to (1) measure hearing in post-hatchling and juvenile loggerhead sea turtles Caretta caretta (19-62 cm straight carapace length) to determine whether these migratory turtles exhibit an ontogenetic shift in underwater auditory detection and (2) evaluate whether hearing frequency range and threshold sensitivity are consistent in behavioral and electrophysiological tests. Behavioral trials first required training turtles to respond to known frequencies, a multi-stage, time-intensive process, and then recording their behavior when they were presented with sound stimuli from an underwater speaker using a two-response forced-choice paradigm. Electrophysiological experiments involved submerging restrained, fully conscious turtles just below the air-water interface and recording auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) when sound stimuli were presented using an underwater speaker. No significant differences in behavior-derived auditory thresholds or AEP-derived auditory thresholds were detected between post-hatchling and juvenile sea turtles. While hearing frequency range (50-1000/1100 Hz) and highest sensitivity (100-400 Hz) were consistent in audiograms pooled by size class for both behavior and AEP experiments, both post-hatchlings and juveniles had significantly higher AEP-derived than behavior-derived auditory thresholds, indicating that behavioral assessment is a more sensitive testing approach. The results from this study suggest that post-hatchling and juvenile loggerhead sea turtles are low-frequency specialists, exhibiting little differences in threshold sensitivity and frequency bandwidth despite residence in acoustically distinct environments throughout ontogeny.",2014,10.1242/jeb.096651,217,14,2580-2589,NA,Sea turtle hearing; Auditory evoked potentials; Operant conditioning; Behavioral audiograms

We present the first study of the design, fabrication and hydrodynamic testing of a synthetic, flexible, shark skin membrane. A three-dimensional (3D) model of shark skin denticles was constructed using micro-CT imaging of the skin of the shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus). Using 3D printing, thousands of rigid synthetic shark denticles were placed on flexible membranes in a controlled, linear-arrayed pattern. This flexible 3D printed shark skin model was then tested in water using a robotic flapping device that allowed us to either hold the models in a stationary position or move them dynamically at their self-propelled swimming speed. Compared with a smooth control model without denticles, the 3D printed shark skin showed increased swimming speed with reduced energy consumption under certain motion programs. For example, at a heave frequency of 1.5 Hz and an amplitude of +/- 1 cm, swimming speed increased by 6.6\% and the energy cost-of-transport was reduced by 5.9\%. In addition, a leading-edge vortex with greater vorticity than the smooth control was generated by the 3D printed shark skin, which may explain the increased swimming speeds. The ability to fabricate synthetic biomimetic shark skin opens up a wide array of possible manipulations of surface roughness parameters, and the ability to examine the hydrodynamic consequences of diverse skin denticle shapes present in different shark species.",2014,10.1242/jeb.097097,217,10,1656-1666,NA,Hydrodynamics; Shark skin; Denticle; Robot
article,Masters of change: seasonal plasticity in the prey-capture behavior of the Alpine newt <i>Ichthyosaura alpestris</i> (Salamandridae),"Heiss, Egon and Aerts, Peter and Van Wassenbergh, Sam",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Transitions between aquatic and terrestrial environments are significant steps in vertebrate evolution. These transitions require major changes in many biological functions, including food uptake and transport. The Alpine newt, Ichthyosaura alpestris, is known to show a `multiphasic lifestyle' where the adult shifts from a terrestrial to an aquatic lifestyle and then back to a terrestrial lifestyle every year as a result of its breeding activity. These transitions correspond to dramatic changes in morphology, physiology and behavior, resulting in distinct aquatic and terrestrial morphotypes. We hypothesized that these shifts go along with changes in prey-capture mechanics to maintain a sufficiently high performance in both environments. We analyzed the prey-capture kinematics in the four possible modes: aquatic strikes in the aquatic phase, terrestrial strikes in the terrestrial phase, aquatic strikes in the terrestrial phase and terrestrial strikes in the aquatic phase. A multivariate comparison detected significant kinematic differences between the phase-specific feeding modes. In both the aquatic and the terrestrial phase, I. alpestris uses a suction-feeding mechanism for capturing prey in water. By contrast, I. alpestris uses a jaw-based grasping mechanism with a kinematic profile similar to the aquatic modes for terrestrial prey-capture in its aquatic phase but an elaborate lingual-based prehension mechanism to capture terrestrial prey in the terrestrial phase. These results exhibit a so-far unknown amount of behavioral plasticity in prey-capture behavior that is tuned to the seasonal demands of performance, and exemplify functional mechanisms behind aquatic-terrestrial transitions in vertebrates.",2013,10.1242/jeb.091991,216,23,4426-4434,NA,feeding; kinematics; plasticity; salamander
article,Increased apical sodium-dependent glucose transporter abundance in the ctenidium of the giant clam <i>Tridacna squamosa</i> upon illumination,"Chan, Christabel Y. L. and Hiong, Kum C. and Choo, Celine Y. L. and Boo, Mel V. and Wong, Wai P. and Chew, Shit F. and Ip, Yuen K.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Giant clams contain phototrophic zooxanthellae, and live in nutrient-deficient tropical waters where light is available. We obtained the complete cDNA coding sequence of a homolog ofmammalian sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1) - SGLT1-like-from the ctenidium of the fluted giant clam, Tridacna squamosa. SGLT1-like had a host origin and was expressed predominantly in the ctenidium. Molecular characterizations reveal that SGLT1-like of T. squamosa could transport urea, in addition to glucose, as other SGLT1s do. It has an apical localization in the epithelium of ctenidial filaments and water channels, and the apical anti-SGLT1-like immunofluorescence was stronger in individuals exposed to light than to darkness. Furthermore, the protein abundance of SGLT1-like increased significantly in the ctenidium of individuals exposed to light for 12 h, although the SGLT1-like transcript level remained unchanged. As expected, T. squamosa could perform light-enhanced glucose absorption, which was impeded by exogenous urea. These results denote the close relationships between light-enhanced glucose absorption and light-enhanced SGLT1-like expression in the ctenidium of T. squamosa. Although glucose absorption could be trivial compared with the donation of photosynthates from zooxanthellae in symbiotic adults, SGLT1-like might be essential for the survival of aposymbiotic larvae, leading to its retention in the symbiotic stage. A priori, glucose uptake through SGLT1-like might be augmented by the surface microbiome through nutrient cycling, and the absorbed glucose could partially fulfill the metabolic needs of the ctenidial cells. Additionally, SGLT1-like could partake in urea absorption, as T. squamosa is known to conduct light-enhanced urea uptake to benefit the nitrogen-deficient zooxanthellae.",2019,10.1242/jeb.195644,222,7,NA,jeb195644,Carbohydrate; Calcification; Nitrogen; Symbiodinium; Urea; Zooxanthellae

The high flexibility of the fins and complex flow fields generated by distinct propulsion systems require innovative techniques for locomotive assessment. For this study, we used proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) to decouple components of the fin motions and defocusing digital particle tracking velocimetry (DDPTV) to quantify the resultant 3D flow fields. Kinematic footage and DDPTV data were collected from brief squid. Lolliguncula brevis {[}3.1-6.5 cm dorsal mantle length (DML)], swimming freely in a water tunnel at speeds of 0.39-7.20 DMLs(-1). Both flap and wave components were present in all fin motions, but the relative importance of the wave components was higher for arms-first swimming than for tail-first swimming and for slower versus higher speed swimming. When prominent wave components were present, more complex interconnected vortex ring wakes were observed, while fin movements dominated by flapping resulted in more spatially separated vortex ring patterns. Although the jet often produced the majority of the thrust for steady rectilinear swimming, our results demonstrated that the fins can contribute more thrust than the jet at times, consistently produce comparable levels of lift to the jet during arms-first swimming, and can boost overall propulsive efficiency. By producing significant drag signatures, the fins can also aid in stabilization and maneuvenng. Clearly, fins play multiple roles in squid locomotion, and when coupled with the jet, allow squid to perform a range of swimming behaviors integral to their ecological success.",2018,10.1242/jeb.176750,221,14,NA,NA,Cephalopod; Vorticity; Fins; Flapping; Undulation; Proper orthogonal decomposition; 3D velocimetry
article,Effect of magnetic pulses on Caribbean spiny lobsters: implications for magnetoreception,"Ernst, David A. and Lohmann, Kenneth J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The Caribbean spiny lobster, Panulirus argus, is a migratory crustacean that uses Earth's magnetic field as a navigational cue, but how these lobsters detect magnetic fields is not known. Magnetic material thought to be magnetite has previously been detected in spiny lobsters, but its role in magnetoreception, if any, remains unclear. As a first step toward investigating whether lobsters might have magnetite-based magnetoreceptors, we subjected lobsters to strong, pulsed magnetic fields capable of reversing the magnetic dipole moment of biogenic magnetite crystals. Lobsters were subjected to a single pulse directed from posterior to anterior and either: (1) parallel to the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field (i.e. toward magnetic north); or (2) antiparallel to the horizontal field (i.e. toward magnetic south). An additional control group was handled but not subjected to a magnetic pulse. After treatment, each lobster was tethered in a water-filled arena located within 200 m of the capture location and allowed to walk in any direction. Control lobsters walked in seemingly random directions and were not significantly oriented as a group. In contrast, the two groups exposed to pulsed fields were significantly oriented in approximately opposite directions. Lobsters subjected to a magnetic pulse applied parallel to the geomagnetic horizontal component walked westward; those subjected to a pulse directed antiparallel to the geomagnetic horizontal component oriented approximately northeast. The finding that a magnetic pulse alters subsequent orientation behavior is consistent with the hypothesis that magnetoreception in spiny lobsters is based at least partly on magnetite-based magnetoreceptors.",2016,10.1242/jeb.136036,219,12,1827-1832,NA,Magnetite; Orientation; Navigation; Magnetoreceptor; Pulse magnetization; Panulirus argus

Environmental and anthropogenic disturbances can disrupt energy balance by prompting avoidance behaviours that increase transport costs, thereby decreasing foraging efficiency. We examined the ability of 12 free-ranging, juvenile northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) to mitigate the effects of experimentally increased transport costs by modifying their behaviour and/or energy use in a compensatory manner. Under normal locomotion, elephant seals had low energy requirements (106.5 +/- 28.2 kJ kg(-1) day(-1)), approaching or even falling below predictions of basal requirements. Seals responded to a small increase in locomotion costs by spending more time resting between dives (149 +/- 44 s) compared with matched control treatments (102 +/- 11 s; P<0.01). Despite incurred costs, most other dive and transit behaviours were conserved across treatments, including fixed, rhythmic swimming gaits. Because of this, and because each flipper stroke had a predictable effect on total costs (P<0.001), total energy expenditure was strongly correlated with time spent at sea under both treatments (P<0.0001). These results suggest that transiting elephant seals have a limited capacity to modify their locomotory behaviour without increasing their transport costs. Based on this, we conclude that elephant seals and other ocean predators occupying similar niches may be particularly sensitive to increased transport costs incurred when avoiding unanticipated disturbances.",2014,10.1242/jeb.094201,217,9,1485-1495,NA,Accelerometer; Disturbance; Drag; Energetics; Field metabolic rate; Flipper stroking; Foraging; Locomotion; Translocation
article,Suction adhesion in the gliding joint of a cephalopod,"Smith, Andrew M. and LaValva, Scott M. and Loiacono, Matthew M. and Thompson, Joseph T.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"We have discovered features of the nuchal joint in the squid, Doryteuthis pealeii, that are unique compared with moveable joints in other animals. The joint's function is unclear but it allows the head to glide toward and away from the mantle. The head glides along the joint with ease yet disarticulating the joint perpendicular to the axis of movement requires considerable force. After disarticulation, the joint components can be repositioned and full function restored immediately. Thus, an unknown attachment mechanism prevents the joint from being disarticulated yet permits gliding. We show that the joint was formed by the articulation of the nuchal cartilage and a heretofore-undescribed organ that we named the nuchal `joint pad'. The joint pad is composed predominantly of muscle, connective tissue and cartilage organized into two distinct regions: a ventral cartilaginous layer and a dorsal muscular layer. Disarticulating the nuchal joint at a displacement rate of 5 mm s(-1) required 1.5 times greater stress (i.e. force per unit area) than at 1 mm s(-1). The force required to disarticulate the joint increased with nuchal cartilage area(0.91) and with nuchal cartilage length(1.88). The stress required to shear the nuchal joint was nearly three orders of magnitude lower than that required to disarticulate the joint. Stimulation of the joint pad dorso-ventral musculature resulted in significantly greater shear force required to move the joint (P=0.004). Perforating the nuchal cartilage decreased the stress required to disarticulate the joint to nearly zero. The results support the hypothesis that suction is the attachment mechanism.",2020,10.1242/jeb.211227,223,2,NA,jeb211227,Adhesion; Biomechanics; Invertebrate; Attachment mechanism; Squid

The protein abundance of F2 and Fgg in the liver and plasma was determined by immunoblotting. The results indicated that F2 and Fgg of P. annectens were phylogenetically closer to those of amphibians than those of teleosts. Three days of aestivation resulted in an up-regulation in the hepatic fgg mRNA expression level, while 6 days of aestivation led to a significant increase (3-fold) in the protein abundance of Fgg in the plasma. Hence, there could be an increase in the blood-clotting ability in P. annectens during the induction phase of aestivation. By contrast, the blood-clotting ability in P. annectens might be reduced in response to decreased blood flow and increased possibility of thrombosis during the maintenance phase of aestivation, as 6 months of aestivation led to significant decreases in mRNA expression levels of f2 and fgg in the liver. There could also be a decrease in the export of F2 and Fgg from the liver to the plasma so as to avert thrombosis. Three to 6 days after arousal from 6 months of aestivation, the protein abundance of F2 and Fgg recovered partially in the plasma of P. annectens; a complete recovery of the transcription and translation of f2/F2 in the liver might occur only after refeeding.",2015,10.1242/jeb.125260,218,23,3717-3728,NA,Blood circulation; Haemostasis; Prothrombin; Thrombin; Thrombosis; Fibrin
article,Two swimming modes in Trachymedusae; bell kinematics and the role of giant axons,"Meech, Matthew E. and Mills, Claudia E. and Haddock, Steven H. D. and Meech, Robert W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Although members of the Rhopalonematidae family (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa, Trachymedusae) are known to exhibit unusually powerful jet swimming in addition to their more normal slow swimming behaviour, for the most part, reports are rare and anecdotal. Many species are found globally at depths of 600-2000 m, and so observation and collection depend on using remotely operated submersible vehicles. With a combination of in situ video footage and laboratory measurements, we have quantified kinematic aspects of this dual swimming motion and its electrophysiology. The species included are from two Rhopalonematidae clades; they are Colobonema sericeum, Pantachogon haeckeli, Crossota millsae and two species of Benthocodon. Comparison is made with Aglantha digitale, a species from a third Rhopalonematidae clade brought to the surface by natural water movement. We find that although all Rhopalonematidae appear to have two swimming modes, there are marked differences in their neural anatomy, kinematics and physiology. Giant motor axons, known to conduct impulses during fast swimming in A. digitale, are absent from C. sericeum and P. haeckeli. Slow swimming is also different; in C. sericeum and its relatives it is driven by contractions restricted to the base of the bell, whereas in A. digitale it is driven by contractions in the mid-bell region. These behavioural differences are related to the position of the different clades on a ribosomal DNA-based phylogenetic tree. This finding allows us to pinpoint the phylogenetic branch point leading to the appearance of giant motor axons and escape swimming. They place the remarkable dual swimming behaviour of members of the Rhopalonematidae family into an evolutionary context.",2021,10.1242/jeb.239830,224,10,NA,jeb239830,Cnidaria; Dual swimming; Giant motor axon; Hydromedusae; Kinematics; Phylogenetic tree
article,"Getting older, getting smarter: ontogeny of foraging behaviour in the tropical social wasp <i>Ropalidia marginata</i>","Mandal, Souvik and Brahma, Anindita",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Desert ants and honey bees start foraging when they are a few days old, and subsequently increase their foraging effort and the amount of foraged food. This could be an optimal strategy for scavenger/gatherer animals inhabiting landscapes with fewer features. However, animals inhabiting cluttered landscapes, especially predatory animals, may require substantial familiarity with foraging landscapes to forage efficiently. They may acquire such spatial familiarity with increasing age/experience, and eventually reduce their foraging effort without compromising on foraging success/efficiency. To check whether this holds for the individually foraging predatory tropical paper-wasp Ropalidia marginata, we recorded the number and duration of all foraging trips, the identity of foraged materials, and the directions of outbound and inbound flights (with respect to the nest) of known-age wasps for three consecutive days from three naturally occurring colonies: thus, we measured behavioural profiles of wasps of various ages, and not from the same wasp throughout its lifespan. Wasps increased their foraging duration rapidly until about 4 weeks of age, during which they rarely brought food, although some wasps brought building material and water. Thereafter, their foraging duration started decreasing. Nevertheless, their foraging success/efficiency in bringing food kept on increasing. With age, wasps developed individual directional preferences for outbound and inbound flights, indicating the development of spatial memory for rewarding sites. Also, the angular difference between their outbound and subsequent inbound flights gradually increased, indicating older wasps may have followed tortuous foraging routes. High investment in early life to acquire familiarity with foraging landscapes and using that later to perform efficient foraging could be an optimal strategy for individually foraging animals inhabiting feature-rich landscapes.",2019,10.1242/jeb.199844,222,9,NA,jeb199844,Foraging strategy; Spatial learning and memory; Social hymenoptera; Evolution; Behavioural ecology
article,Pre-start timing information is used to set final linear speed in a C-start manoeuvre,"Reinel, Caroline and Schuster, Stefan",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In their unique hunting behaviour, archerfish use a complex motor decision to secure their prey: based solely on how dislodged prey initially falls, they select an adapted C-start manoeuvre that turns the fish right towards the point on the water surface where their prey will later land. Furthermore, they take off at a speed that is set so as to arrive in time. We show here that the C-start manoeuvre and not subsequent tail beating is necessary and sufficient for setting this adaptive level of speed. Furthermore, the C-start pattern is adjusted to independently determine both the turning angle and the take-off speed. The selection of both aspects requires no a priori information and is done based on information sampled from the onset of target motion until the C-start is launched. Fin strokes can occur right after the C-start manoeuvre but are not required to fine-tune take-off speed, but rather to maintain it. By probing the way in which the fish set their take-off speed in a wide range of conditions in which distance from the later catching point and time until impact varied widely and unpredictably, we found that the C-start manoeuvre is programmed based on pre-C-start estimates of distance and time until impact. Our study hence provides the first evidence for a C-start that is fine-tuned to produce an adaptive speed level.",2014,10.1242/jeb.105510,217,16,2866-2875,NA,Decision-making; Time perception; Motor programme; C-start; Motor output space
article,Head removal enhances planarian electrotaxis,"Sabry, Ziad and Wang, Rui and Jahromi, Aryo and Rabeler, Christina and Kristan, William B. and Collins, Eva-Maria S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Certain animal species utilize electric fields for communication, hunting and spatial orientation. Freshwater planarians move toward the cathode in a static electric field (cathodic electrotaxis). This planarian behavior was first described by Raymond Pearl more than a century ago. However, planarian electrotaxis has received little attention since, and the underlying mechanisms and evolutionary significance remain unknown. To close this knowledge gap, we developed an apparatus and scoring metrics for automated quantitative and mechanistic studies of planarian behavior upon exposure to a static electric field. Using this automated setup, we characterized electrotaxis in the planarian Dugesia japonica and found that this species responds to voltage instead of current, in contrast to results from previous studies using other planarian species. Surprisingly, we found differences in electrotaxis ability between small (shorter) and large (longer) planarians. To determine the cause of these differences, we took advantage of the regenerative abilities of planarians and compared electrotaxis in head, tail and trunk fragments of various lengths. We found that tail and trunk fragments electrotaxed, whereas head fragments did not, regardless of size. Based on these data, we hypothesized that signals from the head may interfere with electrotaxis when the head area/body area reached a critical threshold. In support of this hypothesis, we found that (1) smaller intact planarians that cannot electrotax have a relatively larger head-to-body-ratio than large planarians that can electrotax, and (2) the electrotaxis behavior of cut head fragments was negatively correlated with the head-to-body ratio of the fragments. Moreover, we could restore cathodic electrotaxis in head fragments via decapitation, directly demonstrating inhibition of electrotaxis by the head.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243972,225,17,NA,jeb243972,Dugesia japonica; Behavior; Galvanotaxis; Locomotion; Decapitation
article,Directional biosonar beams allow echolocating harbour porpoises to actively discriminate and intercept closely spaced targets,"Malinka, Chloe E. and Rojano-Donate, Laia and Madsen, Peter T.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Echolocating toothed whales face the problem that high sound speeds in water mean that echoes from closely spaced targets will arrive at time delays within their reported auditory integration time of some 264 mu s. Here, we test the hypothesis that echolocating harbour porpoises cannot resolve and discriminate targets within a clutter interference zone given by their integration time. To do this, we trained two harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) to actively approach and choose between two spherical targets at four varying inter-target distances (13.5, 27, 56 and 108 cm) in a two-alternative forced-choice task. The free-swimming, blindfolded porpoises were tagged with a sound and movement tag (DTAG4) to record their echoic scene and acoustic outputs. The known ranges between targets and the porpoise, combined with the sound levels received on target-mounted hydrophones revealed how the porpoises controlled their acoustic gaze. When targets were close together, the discrimination task was more difficult because of smaller echo time delays and lower echo level ratios between the targets. Under these conditions, buzzes were longer and started from farther away, source levels were reduced at short ranges, and the porpoises clicked faster, scanned across the targets more, and delayed making their discrimination decision until closer to the target. We conclude that harbour porpoises can resolve and discriminate closely spaced targets, suggesting a clutter rejection zone much shorter than their auditory integration time, and that such clutter rejection is greatly aided by spatial filtering with their directional biosonar beam.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242779,224,16,NA,jeb242779,Echolocation; Biosonar; Acoustic gaze; Acoustic field of view; Auditory scene analysis; Echo stream

To properly assess the actual risk of predation, anuran tadpoles mostly rely on water-borne chemical cues, and their ability to evaluate environmental information is even more crucial when potential predators consist of unknown alien species. Behavioural plasticity - that is, the capacity to express changes in behaviour in response to different environmental stimuli - is crucial to cope with predation risk. We explored the defensive behaviour of Italian agile frog (Rana latastei) tadpoles when exposed to the chemical cues of two predator species, one native (dragonfly larvae) and one alien (red swamp crayfish). Firstly, we observed whether a plastic life history trait (i.e. hatching time) might be affected by native predatory cues. Secondly, we recorded a suite of behavioural responses (activity level, lateralization and sinuosity) to each cue. For assessing lateralization and sinuosity, we developed a C++ code for the automatic analysis of digitally recorded tadpole tracks. Hatching time seemed not to be affected by the potential risk of predation, while both predator species and diet affected tadpoles' defensive behaviour. Tadpoles responded to a predator threat by two main defensive strategies: freezing and `zig-zagging'. While the first behaviour had previously been reported, the analysis of individual trajectories indicated that tadpoles can also increase path complexity, probably to prevent predators from anticipating their location. We also recorded a decrease in lateralization intensity, which suggests that under predation risk, tadpoles tend to scrutinize the surrounding environment equally on both sides.",2021,10.1242/jeb.240465,224,9,NA,jeb240465,Alien species; Chemical cues; Defensive behaviour; Lateralization; Sinuosity; Tadpoles
article,"Context-dependent behavioural lateralization in the European pond turtle, <i>Emys orbicularis</i> (Testudines, Emydidae)","Pellitteri-Rosa, Daniele and Gazzola, Andrea",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Lateralization presents clear advantages in ecological contexts as the dominance of one brain side prevents the simultaneous activation of contrasting responses in organisms with laterally located eyes. This is crucial in selecting a safe refuge during a predatory attack and may strongly affect predator-prey interactions. We explored the possible presence of lateralization in the anti-predatory behaviour of European pond turtles, considering their escape facing a possible predatory attack. Thirty individuals (17 males, 13 females) were exposed to three different environmental situations of gradually increasing predatory threat: escape underwater from an unsafe shelter, diving into the water from a basking site and righting after being overturned. All turtles were tested 20 times for each of the three experiments (60 trials per individual; 1800 overall trials). We recorded multiple behavioural responses in the general context of predation risk. This was done in order to assess both the existence of lateralization and possible correlations among different behaviours as function of lateralization. The number of significant responses to the left side was always prevalent in each of the three simulated anti-predatory situations, suggesting the existence of a lateralized behaviour in this species. At the individual level, the differences we found in the three experiments could be related to different ecological contexts and consequent risk of predation. Our findings, among the few on chelonians, support the possible involvement of right hemisphere activity and, most importantly, reveal how the complexity of a general predatory context can affect the laterality of escape behaviour.",2018,10.1242/jeb.186775,221,20,NA,jeb186775,Lateralization; Predation; Escape behaviour; Righting; Chelonian; Emydidae
article,Elastic energy storage in seahorses leads to a unique suction flow dynamics compared with other actinopterygians,"Avidan, Corrine and Holzman, Roi",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Suction feeding is a dominant prey-capture strategy across actinopterygians, consisting of a rapid expansion of the mouth cavity that drives a flow of water containing the prey into the mouth. Suction feeding is a power-hungry behavior, involving the actuation of cranial muscles as well as the anterior third of the fish's swimming muscles. Seahorses, which have reduced swimming muscles, evolved a unique mechanism for elastic energy storage that powers their suction flows. This mechanism allows seahorses to achieve head rotation speeds that are 50 times faster than those of fish lacking such a mechanism. However, it is unclear how the dynamics of suction flows in seahorses differ from the conserved pattern observed across other actinopterygians, or how differences in snout length across seahorses affect these flows. Using flow visualization experiments, we show that seahorses generate suction flows that are 8 times faster than those of similar-sized fish, and that the temporal patterns of cranial kinematics and suction flows in seahorses differ from the conserved pattern observed across other actinopterygians. However, the spatial patterns retain the conserved actinopterygian characteristics, where suction flows impact a radially symmetric region of similar to 1 gape diameter outside the mouth. Within seahorses, increases in snout length were associated with slower suction flows and faster head rotation speeds, resulting in a trade-off between pivot feeding and suction feeding. Overall, this study shows how the unique cranial kinematics in seahorses are manifested in their suction-feeding performance, and highlights the trade-offs associated with their unique morphology and mechanics.",2021,10.1242/jeb.236430,224,17,NA,jeb236430,LaMSA; Kinematics; Syngnathidae; Fish
article,The hydrodynamic regime drives flow reversals in suction-feeding larval fishes during early ontogeny,"Krishnan, Krishnamoorthy and Nafi, Asif Shahriar and Gurka, Roi and Holzman, Roi",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Fish larvae are the smallest self-sustaining vertebrates. As such, they face multiple challenges that stem from their minute size, and from the hydrodynamic regime in which they dwell. This regime, of intermediate Reynolds numbers, was shown to affect the swimming of larval fish and impede their ability to capture prey. Prey capture is impeded because smaller larvae produce weaker suction flows, exerting weaker forces on the prey. Previous observations on feeding larvae also showed prey exiting the mouth after initially entering it (hereafter `in-and-out'), although the mechanism causing such failures had been unclear. In this study, we used numerical simulations to investigate the hydrodynamic mechanisms responsible for the failure to feed caused by this in-and-out prey movement. Detailed kinematics of the expanding mouth during prey capture by larval Sparus aurata were used to parameterize agespecific numerical models of the flows inside the mouth. These models revealed that for small larvae which expand their mouth slowly, fluid entering the mouth cavity is expelled through the mouth before it is closed, resulting in flow reversal at the orifice. This relative efflux of water through the mouth was >8\% of the influx through the mouth for younger ages. However, similar effluxes were found when we simulated slow strikes by larger fish. The simulations can explain the observations of larval fish failing to feed because of the in-and-out movement of the prey. These results further highlight the importance of transporting the prey from the gape deeper into the mouth cavity in determining suction-feeding success.",2020,10.1242/jeb.214734,223,9,NA,jeb214734,Sparus aurata; Reynolds numbers; Feeding kinematics

In this study, primary cultured model gill epithelia composed of pavement cells (PVCs) were used to examine TJ protein transcript abundance during the development of epithelium confluence and epithelium resistive properties. Differences in TJ protein expression patterns and transcript abundance between gill models composed of PVCs and models composed of PVCs and mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs) were also examined. Marked alterations in TJ protein transcript abundance were observed as cells developed to confluence in flask-cultured model gill epithelia. In contrast, during the formation of tissue resistance in insert-cultured epithelia (i.e. epithelia cultured on a permeable substrate), changes in TJ protein mRNA abundance were conservative, despite paracellular marker flux decreasing by orders of magnitude. In both cases significant changes in claudin-8b, -8d, -27b, -28b and -32a transcript abundance were observed, suggesting that temporal alterations in the abundance of these genes are important end points of model gill epithelium integrity. When MRCs were present in cultured gill models, the mRNA abundance of several TJ proteins significantly altered and claudin-10c, -10d and -33b were only detected in preparations that included MRCs. These data provide insight into the role of select TJ proteins in the formation and development of gill epithelia and the maintenance of gill barrier properties.

How do barnacles manage to capture copepods despite the fluid disturbances they generate? We examined this question by describing the feeding current architecture of 1 cm sized Balanus crenatus using particle image velocimetry, and by studying the trajectories of captured copepods and the escapes of evading copepods. We found that barnacles produce a feeding current that arrives both from behind and the sides of the barnacle. The flow from the sides represents quiescent corridors of low fluid deformation and uninterrupted by the beating cirral fan. Potential prey arriving from behind are likely to encounter the cirral fan and, hence, capture here is highly unlikely. Accordingly, most captured copepods arrived through the quiet corridors, while most copepods arriving from behind managed to escape. Thus, it is the unique feeding flow architecture that allows feeding on evasive prey. We used the Landau-Squire jet as a simple model of the feeding current. For the Reynolds number of our experiments, the model reproduces the main features of the feeding current, including the lateral feeding corridors. Furthermore, the model suggests that smaller barnacle specimens, operating at lower Reynolds numbers, will produce a fore-aft symmetric feeding current without the lateral corridors. This suggests an ontogenetic diet shift from non-evasive prey to inclusion of evasive prey as the barnacle grows.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246541,227,5,NA,jeb246541,Suspension feeding; Hydro-mechanical sensing; Copepods; Particle image velocimetry (PIV); Landau-Squire jet
article,The role of ecdysis in repair of an attachment system: a case study using geckos,"Pillai, Rishab R. and Riedel, Jendrian and Schwarzkopf, Lin",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Skin provides functions such as protection and prevention of water loss. In some taxa, the outer surface of skin has been modified to form structures that enable attachment to various surfaces. Constant interaction with surfaces is likely to cause damage to these attachment systems and reduce function. It seems logical that when skin is shed via ecdysis, its effectiveness will increase, through repair of damage or other rejuvenating mechanisms. We address two questions using three diplodactylid geckos as model species. (1) Does repeated mechanical damage affect clinging ability in geckos to the point that they cannot support their own body weight? (2) Does use without induced damage reduce effectiveness of the attachment system, and if so, does ecdysis restore clinging ability? We found that repeated damage reduced clinging ability in all three species, although at different rates. Additionally, use reduced clinging ability over time when no apparent damage was incurred. Clinging ability increased after ecdysis in all three species, both when damage was specially induced, and when it was not. After normal use without induced damage, the increase in clinging ability after ecdysis was statistically significant in two of three species. Our findings show that use decreases clinging ability, and mechanical damage also effects geckos' capacity to exert shear forces consistently. Thus, ecdysis improves clinging ability both in scenarios where damage is induced and more generally. In addition to the physiological functions provided by skin, our study highlights an important function of ecdysis in a speciose vertebrate group.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245286,226,10,NA,jeb245286,Attachment; Damage; Diplodactylidae; Ecdysis; Integument; Geckos; Safety factors
article,Suction feeding biomechanics of <i>Polypterus bichir</i>: investigating linkage mechanisms and the contributions of cranial kinesis to oral cavity volume change,"Whitlow, Katrina R. and Ross, Callum F. and Gidmark, Nicholas J. and Laurence-Chasen, J. D. and Westneat, Mark W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Many fishes use substantial cranial kinesis to rapidly increase buccal cavity volume, pulling prey into the mouth via suction feeding. Living polypterids are a key lineage for understanding the evolution and biomechanics of suction feeding because of their phylogenetic position and unique morphology. Polypterus bichir have fewer mobile cranial elements compared with teleosts {[}e.g. immobile (pre)maxillae] but successfully generate suction through dorsal, ventral and lateral oral cavity expansion. However, the relative contributions of these motions to suction feeding success have not been quantified. Additionally, extensive body musculature and lack of opercular jaw opening linkages make P. bichir of interest for examining the role of cranial versus axial muscles in driving mandibular depression. Here, we analyzed the kinematics of buccal expansion during suction feeding in P. bichirusing X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology (XROMM) and quantified the contributions of skeletal elements to oral cavity volume expansion and prey capture. Mouth gape peaks early in the strike, followed by maximum cleithral and ceratohyal rotations, and finally by opercular and suspensorial abductions, maintaining the anterior-to-posterior movement of water. Using a new method of quantifying bones' relative contributions to volume change (RCVC), we demonstrate that ceratohyal kinematics are the most significant drivers of oral cavity volume change. All measured cranial bone motions, except abduction of the suspensorium, are correlated with prey motion. Lastly, cleithral retraction is largely concurrent with ceratohyal retraction and jaw depression, while the sternohyoideus maintains constant length, suggesting a central role of the axial muscles, cleithrum and ceratohyal in ventral expansion.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243283,225,3,NA,jeb243283,Actinopterygian; Buccal expansion; Ceratohyal kinematics; RCVC; Endocast; XROMM
article,"Influence of flow on locomotion, feeding behaviour and spatial distribution of a suspension-feeding sea cucumber","Sun, Jiamin and Hamel, Jean-Francois and Mercier, Annie",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Although movement in response to environmental conditions represents a fundamental link between animal behaviour and population ecology, it is rarely investigated in suspension feeders because they are generally perceived as sessile. Here, the interplay between water flow and fine locomotor and feeding behaviours was experimentally investigated for the first time in a free-moving suspension-feeding sea cucumber (Cucumaria frondosa; Echinodermata, Holothuroidea) using time-lapse videography in a mesocosm setting. Individuals moved away from static conditions in the weakest flow treatment and fled the strongest flows (>40 cm s(-1)) in the more dynamic treatments. The tentacles of individuals located in areas with flows of >= 40 cm s(-1) was aligned with the direction of the current, whereas in flows <40 cm s(-1), they were typically perpendicular to the direction of flow. Tentacle deployment and insertion rates (i.e. feeding rate) increased with flow, from 0.95 min(-1) at 10 cm s(-1) to 1.13 min(-1) at 40 cm s(-1). Three modes of locomotion were detected. Forward crawling was most frequent at flows <= 40 cm s(-1), passive rolling dominated at flows >40 cm s(-1) and active rolling occurred randomly at flows between 0 and 120 cm s(-1). Overall, the flow regime favoured by C. frondosa was determined to be between 21 and 40 cm s(-1), under which an optimal balance between efficient food capture and energy expenditure for attachment to the bottom was presumably found. These findings provide insight into the distribution and population dynamics of suspension-feeding holothuroids, and may also assist the fisheries management and aquaculture development of commercial species.",2018,10.1242/jeb.189597,221,20,NA,jeb189597,Cucumaria; Benthic animal; Echinoderm; Tentacle insertion rate; Current; Movement

Previous studies showed that electric fish (Brachyhypopomus occidentalis) naturally exposed to high predator (Rhamdia quelen) density and tail injury had reduced brain cell proliferation compared with individuals facing few predators and those with intact tails. However, these field studies described only correlations between predator exposure and cell proliferation. Here, we used a congener Brachyhypopomus gauderio and another electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus to experimentally test the hypothesis that exposure to a predator stimulus and tail injury causes alterations in brain cell proliferation. To simulate predator exposure, we either amputated the tail followed by short-term (1 day) or longterm (17-18 days) recovery or repeatedly chased intact fish with a plastic rod over a 7 day period. We measured cell proliferation (PCNA + cell density) in the telencephalon and diencephalon, and plasma cortisol, which commonly mediates stress-induced changes in brain cell proliferation. In both species, either tail amputation or simulated predator chase decreased cell proliferation in the telencephalon in a manner resembling the effect of predators in the field. In A. leptorhynchus, cell proliferation decreased drastically in the short term after tail amputation and partially rebounded after long-term recovery. In B. gauderio, tail amputation elevated cortisol levels, but repeated chasing had no effect. In A. leptorhynchus, tail amputation elevated cortisol levels in the short term but not in the long term. Thus, predator stimuli can cause reductions in brain cell proliferation, but the role of cortisol is not clear.",2017,10.1242/jeb.158246,220,13,2328-2334,NA,Brain plasticity; Predation; Tail injury; Cortisol; Proliferating cell nuclear antigen
article,Channeling vorticity: modeling the filter-feeding mechanism in silver carp using μCT and 3D PIV,"Cohen, Karly E. and Hernandez, L. Patricia and Crawford, Callie H. and Flammang, Brooke E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Invasive silver carp are thriving within eutrophic environments in the United States, in part because of their highly efficient filter-feeding mechanism. Silver carp utilize modified gill rakers to capture a specific range of food; however, their greatly modified filtering morphology allows them to feed on phytoplankton and zooplankton ranging in size from 4 to 85 mu m. The filtering apparatus of silver carp comprises rigid filtering plates where the outer anatomy of these plates is characterized by long parallel channels that change in orientation along the length of the plate. Here, we investigate the underlying morphology and concomitant hydrodynamics that support the filtration mechanisms of silver and bighead carp. Bighead carp are also invasive filter feeders, but their filtering apparatus is morphologically distinct from that of silver carp. Using 3D particle image velocimetry, we determined how particles and fluid interact with the surface of the gill rakers/plates. Filtering plates in silver carp induce strong directed vortical flow, whereas the filtering apparatus of bighead carp resulted in a type of haphazard cross-flow filtration. The organized vortical flow established by silver carp likely increased the number of interactions that the particle-filled water had with the filtering membrane. This strong vortical organization is maintained only at 0.75 body lengths s(-1), and vortical flow is poorly developed and maintained at slower and faster speeds. Moreover, we found that absolute vorticity magnitude in silver carp is an order of magnitude greater than in bighead carp.",2018,10.1242/jeb.183350,221,19,NA,jeb183350,Filter feeding; Particle image velocimetry; Hypophthalmichthys molitrix; Gill rakers
article,The tendinopathic Achilles tendon does not remain iso-volumetric upon repeated loading: insights from 3D ultrasound,"Nuri, Leila and Obst, Steven J. and Newsham-West, Richard and Barrett, Rod S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy (MAT) alters the normal three-dimensional (3D) morphology of the Achilles tendon (AT) at rest and under a single tensile load. However, how MAT changes the 3D morphology of the AT during repeated loading remains unclear. This study compared the AT longitudinal, transverse and volume strains during repeated loading of the tendinopathic AT with those of the contralateral tendon in people with unilateral MAT. Ten adults with unilateral MAT performed 10 successive 25 s submaximal (50\%) voluntary isometric plantarflexion contractions with both legs. Freehand 3D ultrasound scans were recorded and used to measure whole AT, free AT and proximal AT longitudinal strains and free AT cross-sectional area (CSA) and volume strains. The free AT experienced higher longitudinal and CSA strain and reached steady state following a greater number of contractions (five contractions) in the tendinopathic AT compared with the contralateral tendon (three contractions). Further, free tendon CSA and volume strain were greater in the tendinopathic AT than in the contralateral tendon from the first contraction, whereas free AT longitudinal strain was not greater than that of the contralateral tendon until the fourth contraction. Volume loss from the tendon core therefore preceded the greater longitudinal strain in the tendinopathic AT. Overall, these findings suggest that the tendinopathic free AT experiences an exaggerated longitudinal and transverse strain response under repeated loading that is underpinned by an altered interaction between solid and fluid tendon matrix components. These alterations are indicative of accentuated poroelasticity and an altered local stress-strain environment within the tendinopathic free tendon matrix, which could affect tendon remodelling via mechanobiological pathways.",2017,10.1242/jeb.159764,220,17,3053-3061,NA,Creep; Strain; Cross-sectional area; Mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy; Volume; Free tendon
article,Vibrissal sensitivity in a harbor seal (<i>Phoca vitulina</i>),"Murphy, Christin T. and Reichmuth, Colleen and Mann, David",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Prior efforts to characterize the capabilities of the vibrissal system in seals have yielded conflicting results. Here, we measured the sensitivity of the vibrissal system of a harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) to directly coupled sinusoidal stimuli delivered by a vibrating plate. A trained seal was tested in a psychophysical paradigm to determine the smallest velocity that was detectable at nine frequencies ranging from 10 to 1000 Hz. The stimulus plate was driven by a vibration shaker and the velocity of the plate at each frequency-amplitude combination was calibrated with a laser vibrometer. To prevent cueing from other sensory stimuli, the seal was fitted with a blindfold and headphones playing broadband masking noise. The seal was sensitive to vibrations across the range of frequencies tested, with best sensitivity of 0.09 mm s(-1) at 80 Hz. Velocity thresholds as a function of frequency showed a characteristic U-shaped curve with decreasing sensitivity below 20 Hz and above 250 Hz. To ground-truth the experimental setup, four human subjects were tested in the same paradigm using their thumb to contact the vibrating plate. Threshold measurements for the humans were similar to those of the seal, demonstrating comparable tactile sensitivity for their structurally different mechanoreceptive systems. The thresholds measured for the harbor seal in this study were about 100 times more sensitive than previous in-air measures of vibrissal sensitivity for this species. The results were similar to those reported by others for the detection of waterborne vibrations, but show an extended range of frequency sensitivity.",2015,10.1242/jeb.118240,218,15,2463-2471,NA,Vibrissae; Whiskers; Seal; Vibrotactile; Mechanoreception; Psychophysics
article,"Attachment to challenging substrates - fouling, roughness and limits of adhesion in the northern clingfish (<i>Gobiesox maeandricus</i>)","Ditsche, Petra and Wainwright, Dylan K. and Summers, Adam P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Northern clingfish use a ventral suction disc to stick to rough substrates in the intertidal zone. Bacteria, algae and invertebrates grow on these surfaces (fouling) and change the surface properties of the primary substrate, and therefore the attachment conditions for benthic organisms. In this study, we investigate the influence of fouling and surface roughness on the adhesive strength of northern clingfish, Gobiesox maeandricus. We measured clingfish tenacity on unfouled and fouled substrates over four surface roughnesses. We exposed surfaces for 6 weeks in the Pacific Ocean, until they were covered with periphyton. Clingfish tenacity is equivalent on both fouled and unfouled smooth substrates; however, tenacity on fouled rough surfaces is less compared with tenacity on unfouled ones. We hypothesize that parts of biofilm may act as a lubricant and decrease friction of the disc margin, thereby making disc margins slip inwards and fail at lower tenacities. Nevertheless, even on fouled surfaces the adhesive forces are approximately 150 times the body weight of the fish. To identify the upper threshold of surface roughness the fish can cling to, we tested seven unfouled substrates of increasing surface roughness. The threshold roughness at which northern clingfish failed increased with specimen size. We hypothesize that because of the elastic properties of the disc margin, a larger disc can adapt to larger surface irregularities. The largest specimens (length 10-12 cm) were able to cling to surfaces with 2-4 mm grain size. The fish can attach to surfaces with roughness between 2 and 9\% of the suction disc width.",2014,10.1242/jeb.100149,217,14,2548-2554,NA,Biofilm; Periphyton; Surface roughness; Suction disc; Attachment; Functional morphology; Gobiesocidae

Attached vortices are produced by relatively large objects that block freestream flow, which fish routinely utilize for flow refuging. To test how flow refuging and the potential harvesting of energy (as seen in Karman gaiting) vary across size classes in rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss; ; fingerling, 8 cm; parr, 14 cm; adult, 22 cm; n =4 per size class), we used a water flume (4100 l; freestream flow at 65 cm s-1) - 1 ) and created vortices using 45 deg wing dams of varying size (small, 15 cm; medium, 31 cm; large, 48 cm). We monitored microhabitat selection and swimming kinematics of individual trout and measured the flow field in the wake of wing dams using time-resolved particle image velocimetry (PIV). Trout of each size class preferentially swam in vortices rather than the freestream, but the capacity to flow refuge varied according to the ratio of vortex width to fish length (WV:LF). W V : L F ). Consistent refuging behavior was exhibited when W V : L F >= 1.5. All size classes exhibited increased wavelength and Strouhal number and decreased tailbeat frequency within vortices compared with freestream, suggesting that swimming in vortices requires less power output. In 17\% of the trials, fish preferentially swam in a manner that suggests energy harvesting from the shear layer.

article,Turbidity drives plasticity in the eyes and brains of an African cichlid,"Tiarks, J. H. and Gray, Suzanne M. and Chapman, Lauren J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Natural variation in environmental turbidity correlates with variation in the visual sensory system of many fishes, suggesting that turbidity may act as a strong selective agent on visual systems. Since many aquatic systems experience increased turbidity due to anthropogenic perturbations, it is important to understand the degree to which fish can respond to rapid shifts in their visual environment, and whether such responses can occur within the lifetime of an individual. We examined whether developmental exposure to turbidity (clear, <5 NTU; turbid, similar to 9 NTU) influenced the size of morphological structures associated with vision in the African blue -lip cichlid Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor. Parental fish were collected from two sites (clear swamp, turbid river) in western Uganda. F1 broods from each population were split and reared under clear and turbid rearing treatments until maturity. We measured morphological traits associated with the visual sensory system (eye diameter, pupil diameter, axial length, brain mass, optic tectum volume) over the course of development. Age was significant in explaining variation in visual traits even when standardized for body size, suggesting an ontogenetic shift in the relative size of eyes and brains. When age groups were analyzed separately, young fish reared in turbid water grew larger eyes than fish reared in clear conditions. Population was important in the older age category, with swamp -origin fish having relatively larger eyes and optic lobes relative to river -origin fish. Plastic responses during development may be important for coping with a more variable visual environment associated with anthropogenically induced turbidity.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246708,227,7,NA,jeb246708,Sensory system; Ontogeny; Brain size; Optic tectum; Eye size; Morphology

R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The resistance of macroalgae to damage by hydrodynamic forces depends on the mechanical properties of their tissues. Although factors such as water-flow environment, algal growth rate and damage by herbivores have been shown to influence various material properties of macroalgal tissues, the interplay of these factors as they change seasonally and affect algal mechanical performance has not been worked out. We used the perennial kelp Egregia menziesii to study how the material properties of the rachis supporting a frond changed seasonally over a 2 year period, and how those changes correlated with seasonal patterns of the environment, growth rate and herbivore load. Rachis tissue became stiffer, stronger and less extensible with age (distance from the meristem). Thus, slowly growing rachises were stiffer, stronger and tougher than rapidly growing ones. Growth rates were highest in spring and summer when upwelling and long periods of daylight occurred. Therefore, rachis tissue was most resistant to damage in the winter, when waves were large as a result of seasonal storms. Herbivory was greatest during summer, when rachis growth rates were high. Unlike other macroalgae, E. menziesii did not respond to herbivore damage by increasing rachis tissue strength, but rather by growing in width so that the cross-sectional area of the wounded rachis was increased. The relative timing of environmental factors that affect growth rates (e.g. upwelling supply of nutrients, daylight duration) and of those that can damage macroalgae (e.g. winter storms, summer herbivore outbreaks) can influence the material properties and thus the mechanical performance of macroalgae.",2019,10.1242/jeb.190595,222,4,NA,jeb190595,Macroalgae; Material properties; Wave exposure; Damage; Hydrodynamic forces

This study investigated relationships between estimated body composition and metabolic function, inflammatory markers, ovarian activity (females only) and physical activity levels in 44 Asian elephants (n=35 females, n=9 males). Deuterium dilution was used to measure total body water from which fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) could be derived to estimate body composition. Serum was analyzed for progestagens and estradiol (females only), deuterium, glucose, insulin and amyloid A. Physical activity was assessed by an accelerometer placed on the elephant's front leg for at least 2 days. Relative fat mass (RFM) - the amount of fat relative to body mass was calculated to take differences in body size between elephants into consideration. Body fat percentage ranged from 2.01\% to 24.59\%. Male elephants were heavier (P=0.043), with more FFM (P=0.049), but not FM (P>0.999), than females. For all elephants, estimated RFM (r=0.45, P=0.004) was positively correlated with insulin. Distance walked was negatively correlated with age (r=-0.46, P=0.007). When adjusted for FFM and age (P<0.001), non-cycling females had less fat compared with cycling females, such that for every 100 kg increase in FM, the odds of cycling were 3 times higher (P<0.001). More work is needed to determine what an unhealthy amount of fat is for elephants; however, our results suggest higher adiposity may contribute to metabolic perturbations.",2021,10.1242/jeb.219543,224,2,NA,jeb219543,Obesity; Body composition; Elephantidae; Reproduction; Walking
article,A tale of two fish tails: does a forked tail really perform better than a truncate tail when cruising?,"Tack, Nils B. and Gemmell, Brad J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Many fishes use their tail as the main thrust producer during swimming. This fin's diversity in shape and size influences its physical interactions with water as well as its ecological functions. Two distinct tail morphologies are common in bony fishes: flat, truncate tails which are best suited for fast accelerations via drag forces, and forked tails that promote economical, fast cruising by generating lift-based thrust. This assumption is based primarily on studies of the lunate caudal fin of Scombrids (i.e. tuna, mackerel), which is comparatively stiff and exhibits an airfoil-type cross-section. However, this is not representative of the more commonly observed and taxonomically widespread flexible forked tail, yet similar assumptions about economical cruising are widely accepted. Here, we present the first comparative experimental study of forked versus truncate tail shape and compare the fluid mechanical properties and energetics of two common nearshore fish species. We examined the hypothesis that forked tails provide a hydrodynamic advantage over truncate tails at typical cruising speeds. Using experimentally derived pressure fields, we show that the forked tail produces thrust via acceleration reaction forces like the truncate tail during cruising but at increased energetic costs. This reduced efficiency corresponds to differences in the performance of the two tail geometries and body kinematics to maintain similar overall thrust outputs. Our results offer insights into the benefits and tradeoffs of two common fish tail morphologies and shed light on the functional morphology of fish swimming to guide the development of bio-inspired underwater technologies.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244967,225,22,NA,jeb244967,Fish swimming; Caudal fin; Efficiency; Performance; Cruising; PIV

To determine whether differences exist in bat flight behaviour, prey handling and echolocation characteristics when catching fish and insects of different size, we conducted a field experiment focused on the last stage of prey capture. We used synchronized video and ultrasound recordings to measure several flight and dip features as well as echolocation characteristics, focusing on terminal buzz phase I, characterized by a call rate exceeding 100 Hz, and buzz phase II, characterized by a drop in the fundamental well below 20 kHz and a repetition rate exceeding 150 Hz. When capturing insects, bats used both parts of the terminal phase to the same extent, and performed short and superficial drags on the water surface. In contrast, when preying on fish, buzz I was longer and buzz II shorter, and the bats made longer and deeper dips. These variations suggest that lengthening buzz I and shortening buzz II when fishing is beneficial, probably because buzz I gives better discrimination ability and the broader sonar beam provided by buzz II is useless when no evasive flight of the prey is expected. Additionally, bats continued emitting calls beyond the theoretical signal-overlap zone, suggesting that they might obtain information even when they have surpassed that threshold, at least initially. This study shows that M. capaccinii can regulate the temporal components of its feeding buzzes and modify prey capture technique according to the target.",2014,10.1242/jeb.104992,217,18,3318-3325,NA,Long-fingered bat; Feedback control; Feeding buzz; Field experiment; Fishing behaviour; Signal-overlap zone

The recognition of cues originating from predators can be innate or learned. Cues of various modalities might be used alone or in multi-modal combinations to detect and distinguish predators but studies investigating multi-modal integration in predator avoidance are scarce. Here, we used wild, naive tadpoles of the Neotropical poison frog Allobates femoralis (Boulenger, 1884) to test their reaction to cues with two modalities from two different sympatrically occurring potential predators: heterospecific predatory Dendrobates tinctorius tadpoles and dragonfly larvae. We presented A. femoralis tadpoles with olfactory or visual cues, or a combination of the two, and compared their reaction to a water control in a between-individual design. In our trials. A. femoralis tadpoles reacted to multi-modal stimuli (a combination of visual and chemical information) originating from dragonfly larvae with avoidance but showed no reaction to uni-modal cues or cues from heterospecific tadpoles. In addition, visual cues from conspecifics increased swimming activity while cues from predators had no effect on tadpole activity. Our results show that A. femoralis tadpoles can innately recognize some predators and probably need both visual and chemical information to effectively avoid them.

Gary",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Ureotelic elasmobranchs require nitrogen for both protein growth and urea-based osmoregulation, and therefore are probably nitrogen-limited in nature. Mechanisms exist for retaining and/or scavenging nitrogen in the gills, kidney, rectal gland and gut, but as yet, the latter are not well characterized. Intestinal sac preparations of the Pacific spiny dogfish shark (Squalus acanthias suckleys) incubated in vitro strongly reabsorbed urea from the lumen after feeding, but mucosal fluid ammonia concentrations increased with incubation time. Phloretin (0.25 mmol l(-1), which blocked urea reabsorption) greatly increased the rate of ammonia accumulation in the lumen. A sensitive {[}C-14]urea-based assay was developed to examine the potential role of microbial urease in this ammonia production. Urease activity was detected in chyme/intestinal fluid and intestinal epithelial tissue of both fed and fasted sharks. Urease was not present in gall-bladder bile. Urease activities were highly variable among animals, but generally greater in chyme than in epithelia, and greater in fed than in fasted sharks. Comparable urease activities were found in chyme and epithelia of the Pacific spotted raffish (Hydrolagus collier), a ureotelic holocephalan, but were much lower in ammonotelic teleosts. Urease activity in dogfish chyme was inhibited by acetohydroxamic acid (1 mmol l(-1)) and by boiling. Treatment of dogfish gut sac preparations with acetohydroxamic acid blocked ammonia production, changing net ammonia accumulation into net ammonia absorption. We propose that microbial urease plays an important role in nitrogen handling in the elasmobranch intestine, allowing some urea-N to be converted to ammonia, which is then reabsorbed for amino acid synthesis or reconversion to urea.",2019,10.1242/jeb.194787,222,3,NA,jeb194787,Ammonia; Urea; Amino acids; Phloretin; Acetohydroxamic acid; Intestine; Spiral valve; Gut sacs

In species in which males provide parental care, reproduction might have similar effects on fathers. We examined effects of an environmental challenge on metabolically important physiological, morphological and behavioral measures, and determined whether these effects differed between reproductive and non-reproductive males in the biparental California mouse (Peromyscus californicus). Males were paired with an ovary-intact female, an ovariectomized female treated with estrogen and progesterone to induce estrus, or an untreated ovariectomized female. Within each group, half of the animals were housed under standard laboratory conditions and half in cages requiring them to climb wire towers to obtain food and water; these latter animals were also fasted for 24 h every third day. We predicted that few differences would be observed between fathers and non-reproductive males under standard conditions, but that fathers would be in poorer condition than non-reproductive males under challenging conditions. Body and fat mass showed a housing condition x reproductive group interaction: the challenge condition increased body and fat mass in both groups of non-reproductive males, but breeding males were unaffected. Males housed under the physical and energetic challenge had higher blood lipid content, lower maximal aerobic capacity and related traits (hematocrit and relative triceps surae mass), increased pain sensitivity and increased number of fecal boli excreted during tail-suspension tests (a measure of anxiety), compared with controls. Thus, our physical and energetic challenge paradigm altered metabolism, morphology and behavior, but these effects were largely unaffected by reproductive condition.",2018,10.1242/jeb.168559,221,1,NA,jeb168559,Anxiety; Body composition; Fatherhood; Metabolism; Paternal care; Reproduction
article,Induced parental care in a poison frog: a tadpole cross-fostering experiment,"Pasukonis, Andrius and Beck, Kristina Barbara and Fischer, Marie-Therese and Weinlein, Steffen and Stuckler, Susanne and Ringler, Eva",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Understanding the external stimuli and natural contexts that elicit complex behaviours, such as parental care, is key in linking behavioural mechanisms to their real-life function. Poison frogs provide obligate parental care by shuttling their tadpoles from terrestrial clutches to aquatic nurseries, but little is known about the proximate mechanisms that control these behaviours. In this study, we used Allobates femoralis, a poison frog with predominantly male parental care, to investigate whether tadpole transport can be induced in both sexes by transferring unrelated tadpoles to the backs of adults in the field. Specifically, we asked whether the presence of tadpoles on an adult's back can override the decision making rules preceding tadpole pick-up and induce the recall of spatial memory necessary for finding tadpole deposition sites. We used telemetry to facilitate accurate tracking of individual frogs and spatial analysis to compare movement trajectories. All tested individuals transported their foster-tadpoles to water pools outside their home area. Contrary to our expectation, we found no sex difference in the likelihood to transport or in the spatial accuracy of finding tadpole deposition sites. We reveal that a stereotypical cascade of parental behaviours that naturally involves sex-specific offspring recognition strategies and the use of spatial memory can be manipulated by experimental placement of unrelated tadpoles on adult frogs. As individuals remained inside their home area when only the jelly from tadpole-containing clutches was brushed on the back, we speculate that tactile rather than chemical stimuli trigger these parental behaviours.",2017,10.1242/jeb.165126,220,21,3949-3954,NA,Parental behaviour; Behavioural trigger; Flexibility; Spatial cognition; Tadpole transport; Telemetry
article,The evolution of jaw protrusion mechanics is tightly coupled to bentho-pelagic divergence in damselfishes (Pomacentridae),"Cooper, W. James and Carter, Casey B. and Conith, Andrew J. and Rice, Aaron N. and Westneat, Mark W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Most species-rich lineages of aquatic organisms have undergone divergence between forms that feed from the substrate (benthic feeding) and forms that feed from the water column (pelagic feeding). Changes in trophic niche are frequently accompanied by changes in skull mechanics, and multiple fish lineages have evolved highly specialized biomechanical configurations that allow them to protrude their upper jaws toward the prey during feeding. Damselfishes (family Pomacentridae) are an example of a species-rich lineage with multiple trophic morphologies and feeding ecologies. We sought to determine whether bentho-pelagic divergence in the damselfishes is tightly coupled to changes in jaw protrusion ability. Using high-speed video recordings and kinematic analysis, we examined feeding performance in 10 species that include three examples of convergence on herbivory, three examples of convergence on omnivory and two examples of convergence on planktivory. We also utilized morphometrics to characterize the feeding morphology of an additional 40 species that represent all 29 damselfish genera. Comparative phylogenetic analyses were then used to examine the evolution of trophic morphology and biomechanical performance. We find that pelagic-feeding damselfishes (planktivores) are strongly differentiated from extensively benthic-feeding species (omnivores and herbivores) by their jaw protrusion ability, upper jaw morphology and the functional integration of upper jaw protrusion with lower jaw abduction. Most aspects of cranial form and function that separate these two ecological groups have evolved in correlation with each other and the evolution of the functional morphology of feeding in damselfishes has involved repeated convergence in form, function and ecology.",2017,10.1242/jeb.143115,220,4,652-666,NA,Functional morphology; Feeding kinematics; Diet niche; Reticulate adaptive radiation; Ecomorphology; Coral reef
article,"The mechanics of air breathing in gray tree frog tadpoles, <i>Hyla versicolor</i> (Anura: Hylidae)","Phillips, Jackson R. and Hewes, Amanda E. and Schwenk, Kurt",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"We describe air-breathing mechanics in gray tree frog tadpoles (Hyla versicolor). We found that H. versicolor tadpoles breathe by `bubble-sucking', a breathing mode typically employed by tadpoles too small to break the water's surface tension, in which a bubble is drawn into the buccal cavity and compressed into the lungs. In most tadpoles, bubble-sucking is replaced by breach breathing (breaking the surface to access air) at larger body sizes. In contrast, H. versicolor tadpoles bubble-suck throughout the larval period, despite reaching body sizes at which breaching is possible. Hyla versicolor tadpoles exhibit two bubble-sucking behaviors: `single bubble-sucking', previously described in other tadpole species, is characterized by a single suction event followed by a compression phase to fill the lungs; `double bubble-sucking' is a novel, apparently derived form of bubble-sucking that adds a second suction event. Hyla versicolor tadpoles transition from single bubble-sucking to double bubble-sucking at approximately 5.7 mm snout-vent length (SVL), which corresponds to a period of rapid lung maturation when they transition from low to high vascularization (6.0 mm SVL). Functional, behavioral and morphological evidence suggests that double bubble-sucking increases the efficiency of pulmonary gas exchange by separating expired, deoxygenated air from freshly inspired air to prevent mixing. Hyla versicolor, and possibly other hylid tadpoles, may have specialized for bubble-sucking in order to take advantage of this increased efficiency. Single and double bubblesucking represent two- and four-stroke ventilation systems, which we discuss in the context of other anamniote air-breathing mechanisms.",2020,10.1242/jeb.219311,223,5,NA,jeb219311,Anuran larvae; Gas exchange; Development; Functional morphology; Lungs
article,Innate turning preference of leaf-cutting ants in the absence of external orientation cues,"Endlein, Thomas and Sitti, Metin",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Most ants use a combination of cues for orientation but how do ants find their way when all external cues are suppressed? Do they walk in a random way or are their movements spatially oriented? Here, we show for the first time that leaf-cutting ants (Acromyrmex lundii) have an innate preference for turning counter-clockwise (left) when external cues are precluded. We demonstrated this by allowing individual ants to run freely on the water surface of a newly developed treadmill. The surface tension supported medium-sized workers but effectively prevented ants from reaching the wall of the vessel, which was important to avoid wall-following behaviour (thigmotaxis). Most ants ran for minutes on the spot but also slowly turned counter-clockwise in the absence of visual cues. Reconstructing the effective path walked revealed a looping pattern which could be interpreted as a search strategy. A similar turning bias was shown for groups of ants in a symmetrical Y-maze where twice as many ants chose the left branch in the absence of optical cues. Wall-following behaviour was tested by inserting a coiled tube before the Y-fork. When ants traversed a left-coiled tube, more ants chose the left box and vice versa. Adding visual cues in the form of vertical black strips either outside the treadmill or on one branch of the Y-maze led to oriented walks towards the strips. It is suggested that both turning bias and wall following are employed as search strategies for an unknown environment which can be overridden by visual cues.",2018,10.1242/jeb.177006,221,14,NA,NA,Lateralisation; Thigmotaxis; Visual cues; Treadmill; Y-maze; Acromyrmex lundii
article,By land or by sea: a modified C-start motor pattern drives the terrestrial tail-flip,"Perlman, Benjamin M. and Ashley-Ross, Miriam A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Aquatic C-start escape responses in teleost fishes are driven by a well-studied network of reticulospinal neurons that produce a motor pattern of simultaneous contraction of axial muscle on the side of the body opposite the threatening stimulus, bending the fish into the characteristic C shape, followed by a traveling wave of muscle contraction on the contralateral side that moves the fish away from the threat. Superficially, the kinematics of the terrestrial tail-flip resemble the C-start, with the anterior body rolling up and over the tail into a tight C shape, followed by straightening as the fish launches off of the caudal peduncle into ballistic flight. We asked whether similar motor control is used for both behaviors in the amphibious mangrove rivulus, Kryptolebias marmoratus. Fine-wire bipolar electrodes were percutaneously inserted into repeatable paired axial locations in five individual fish. Electromyograms synchronized with high-speed video were made of aquatic C-starts, immediately followed by terrestrial tail-flips. Tail-flips took longer to complete than aquatic escapes; correspondingly, muscles were activated for longer durations on land. In the tail-flip, activity was seen in contralateral posterior axial muscle for an extended period of time during the formation of the C shape, likely to press the caudal peduncle against the ground in preparation for launch. Tail-flips thus appear to be produced by modification of the motor pattern driving the aquatic C-start, with differences consistent with the additional requirement of overcoming gravity.",2016,10.1242/jeb.128744,219,12,1860-1865,NA,Mangrove rivulus; Electromyography; Escape response; Tail-flip; Axial musculature; Motor pattern

The intermediate morphotype orange claw (OC) male exhibits the highest growth rate and is subordinate in hierarchy to blue claw (BC) male while dominant on small male (SM). The present study was undertaken to examine the specific role of insulin-like androgenic gland (iag) hormone in morphotype differentiation of M. rosenbergii. To achieve this, RNAi mediated knockdown as well as augmentation of iag transcripts were effected in similar to 60 g OC males using plasmid-based constructs pcD-IAG-lh and pcD-IAGorf, respectively. The treatments were administered to animals maintained in isolation as well as in community. The knockdown plasmid construct that expresses iag-specific long hairpin RNA caused 16-fold reduction of iag transcripts in the SSN1 cell line in vitro. When injected into OC males living in a community, 2.3-fold iag knockdown was recorded, while in isolated OC males it was 4.2-fold initially, but returned to normal subsequently. Compared with the respective controls, OC to BC transformations in the iag silenced animals were significantly lower in the community-reared group, while no difference was observed in the isolated animals. It is reported here for the first time that iag augmentation in OC males resulted in significantly higher OC to BC transformations, when animals were reared in community.

article,Fishing for drifts: detecting buoyancy changes of a top marine predator using a step-wise filtering method,"Gordine, Samantha Alex and Fedak, Michael and Boehme, Lars",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina), fasting-and foraging-related fluctuations in body composition are reflected by buoyancy changes. Such buoyancy changes can be monitored by measuring changes in the rate at which a seal drifts passively through the water column, i.e. when all active swimming motion ceases. Here, we present an improved knowledge-based method for detecting buoyancy changes from compressed and abstracted dive profiles received through telemetry. By step-wise filtering of the dive data, the developed algorithm identifies fragments of dives that correspond to times when animals drift. In the dive records of 11 southern elephant seals from South Georgia, this filtering method identified 0.8-2.2\% of all dives as drift dives, indicating large individual variation in drift diving behaviour. The obtained drift rate time series exhibit that, at the beginning of each migration, all individuals were strongly negatively buoyant. Over the following 75-150 days, the buoyancy of all individuals peaked close to or at neutral buoyancy, indicative of a seal's foraging success. Independent verification with visually inspected detailed high-resolution dive data confirmed that this method is capable of reliably detecting buoyancy changes in the dive records of drift diving species using abstracted data. This also affirms that abstracted dive profiles convey the geometric shape of drift dives in sufficient detail for them to be identified. Further, it suggests that, using this step-wise filtering method, buoyancy changes could be detected even in old datasets with compressed dive information, for which conventional drift dive classification previously failed.",2015,10.1242/jeb.118109,218,23,3816-3824,NA,Body condition; Marine mammal; Elephant seal; Body composition; Drift diving; Telemetry; Foraging ecology; Diving behaviour

Most vertebrates display flexible mechanisms of intraoral food processing with respect to different environmental conditions or food types. It has recently been shown that newts use cyclical loop-motions of the tongue to rasp prey against the palatal dentition. However, it remains unknown whether newts can adjust their food processing behavior in response to different food types or environmental conditions. Newts are interesting models for studying the functional adaptation to different conditions because of their unique and flexible lifestyle: they seasonally change between aquatic and terrestrial habitats, adapt their prey-capture mode to the respective environment, and consume diverse food types with different mechanical properties. Using X-ray high-speed recordings, anatomical investigations, behavioral analyses and mechanical property measurements, we tested the effects of the medium in which feeding occurs (water/air) and the food type (maggot, earthworm, cricket) on the processing behavior in Triturus carnifex. We discovered that food processing, by contrast to prey capture, differed only slightly between aquatic and terrestrial habitats. However, newts adjusted the number of processing cycles to different prey types: while maggots were processed extensively, earthworm pieces were barely processed at all. We conclude that, in addition to food mechanical properties, sensory feedback such as smell and taste appear to induce flexible processing responses, while the medium in which feeding occurs appears to have less of an effect.",2020,10.1242/jeb.232868,223,21,NA,jeb232868,Feeding; Tongue-palate rasping; Chewing; Amphibians; Kinematics; Penetration force

Previous studies have shown that some fish species exploit a quiet window in the background noise for communication. However, it remains to be examined whether hearing abilities and sound production of fish are adapted to marine habitats presenting high hydrodynamism. Here, we investigated whether the communication system of the painted (Pomatoschistus pictus) and the marbled (Pomatoschistus marmoratus) gobies is adapted to enhance sound transmission and reception in Atlantic shallow water environments. We recorded and measured the sound pressure levels of social vocalisations of both species, as well as snapshots of ambient noise of habitats characterised by different hydrodynamics. Hearing thresholds (in terms of both sound pressure and particle acceleration) and responses to conspecific signals were determined using the auditory evoked potential recording technique. We found that the peak frequency range (100-300 Hz) of acoustic signals matched the best hearing sensitivity in both species and appeared well adapted for short-range communication in Atlantic habitats. Sandy/rocky exposed beaches presented a quiet window, observable even during the breaking of moderate waves, coincident with the main sound frequencies and best hearing sensitivities of both species. Our data demonstrate that the hearing abilities of these gobies are well suited to detect conspecific sounds within typical interacting distances (a few body lengths) in Atlantic shallow waters. These findings lend support to the acoustic adaptive hypothesis, under the sensory drive framework, proposing that signals and perception systems coevolve to be effective within local environment constraints.",2018,10.1242/jeb.183681,221,22,NA,jeb183681,Gobiidae; Pomatoschistus; Acoustic communication; Acoustic window; Ambient noise; Auditory sensitivity
article,"Physostomous channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, modify swimming mode and buoyancy based on flow conditions","Yoshida, Makoto A. and Yamamoto, Daisuke and Sato, Katsufumi",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The employment of gliding in aquatic animals as a means of conserving energy has been theoretically predicted and discussed for decades. Several studies have shown that some species glide, whereas others do not. Freshwater fish species that widely inhabit both lentic and lotic environments are thought to be able to adapt to fluctuating flow conditions in terms of locomotion. In adapting to the different functional demands of lentic and lotic environments on fish energetics, physostomous (open swim bladder) fish may optimise their locomotion and activity by controlling their net buoyancy; however, few buoyancy studies have been conducted on physostomous fish in the wild. We deployed accelerometers on free-ranging channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, in both lentic and lotic environments to quantify their swimming activity, and to determine their buoyancy condition preferences and whether gliding conserves energy. Individual comparisons of swimming efforts between ascent and descent phases revealed that all fish in the lentic environment had negative buoyancy. However, all individuals showed many descents without gliding phases, which was contrary to the behaviour predicted to minimise the cost of transport. The fact that significantly fewer gliding phases were observed in the lotic environment, together with the existence of neutrally buoyant fish, indicated that channel catfish seem to optimise their locomotion through buoyancy control based on flow conditions. The buoyancy optimisation of channel catfish relative to the flow conditions that they inhabit not only reflects differences in swimming behaviour but also provides new insights into the adaptation of physostome fish species to various freshwater environments.",2017,10.1242/jeb.140202,220,4,597-606,NA,Swimming behaviour; Gliding; Buoyancy; Physostome; Data logger; Accelerometry
article,Multimodal mechanosensing enables treefrog embryos to escape egg-predators,"Jung, Julie and Serrano-Rojas, Shirley J. and Warkentin, Karen M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Mechanosensory-cued hatching (MCH) is widespread, diverse and important for survival in many animals. From flatworms and insects to frogs and turtles, embryos use mechanosensory cues and signals to inform hatching timing, yet mechanisms mediating mechanosensing in ovo are largely unknown. The arboreal embryos of red-eyed treefrogs, Agalychnis callidryas, hatch prematurely to escape predation, cued by physical disturbance in snake attacks. When otoconial organs in the developing vestibular system become functional, this response strengthens, but its earlier occurrence indicates another sensor must contribute. Post-hatching, tadpoles use lateral line neuromasts to detect water motion. We ablated neuromast function with gentamicin to assess their role in A. callidryas' hatching response to disturbance. Prior to vestibular function, this nearly eliminated the hatching response to a complex simulated attack cue, egg jiggling, revealing that neuromasts mediate early MCH. Vestibular function onset increased hatching, independent of neuromast function, indicating young embryos use multiple mechanosensory systems. MCH increased developmentally. All older embryos hatched in response to egg jiggling, but neuromast function reduced response latency. In contrast, neuromast ablation had no effect on the timing or level of hatching in motion-only vibration playbacks. It appears only a subset of egg-disturbance cues stimulate neuromasts; thus, embryos in attacked clutches may receive unimodal or multimodal stimuli. Agalychnis callidryas embryos have more neuromasts than described for any other species at hatching, suggesting precocious sensory development may facilitate MCH. Our findings provide insight into the behavioral roles of two mechanosensory systems in ovo and open possibilities for exploring sensory perception across taxa in early life stages.",2020,10.1242/jeb.236141,223,24,NA,jeb236141,Environmentally cued hatching; Lateral line system; Behavioral plasticity; Biotremology; Ontogeny; Vestibular system
article,Eye and heart morphogenesis are dependent on melatonin signaling in chick embryos,"Nogueira, Renato C. and Sampaio, Lucia de Fatima S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Calmodulin is vital for chick embryos morphogenesis in the incubation time 48-66 h when the rudimentary C-shaped heart attains an S-shaped pattern and the optic vesicles develop into optic cups. Melatonin is in the extraembryonic yolk sac of the avian egg; melatonin binds calmodulin. The aim of this study was to investigate the function of melatonin in the formation of the chick embryo optic cups and S-shaped heart, by pharmacological methods and immunoassays. Mel1a melatonin receptor immunofluorescence was distributed in the optic cups and rudimentary hearts. We separated embryonated chicken eggs at 48 h of incubation into basal, control and drug-treated groups, with treatment applied in the egg air sac. At 66 h of incubation, embryos were excised from the eggs and analyzed. Embryos from the basal, control (distilled water), melatonin and 6-chloromelatonin (melatonin receptor agonist) groups had regular optic cups and an S-shaped heart, while those from the calmidazolium (calmodulin inhibitor) group did not. Embryos from the luzindole (melatonin receptor antagonist) and prazosin (Mel1c melatonin receptor antagonist) groups did not have regular optic cups. Embryos from the 4-P-PDOT (Mel1b melatonin receptor antagonist) group did not have an S-shaped heart. Previous application of the melatonin, 6-chloromelatonin or forskolin (adenylate cyclase enhancer) prevented the abnormal appearance of chick embryos from the calmidazolium, luzindole, prazosin and 4-P-PDOT groups. However, 6-chloromelatonin and forskolin only partially prevented the development of defective eye cups in embryos from the calmidazolium group.

article,Visual acuity in ray-finned fishes correlates with eye size and habitat,"Caves, Eleanor M. and Sutton, Tracey T. and Johnsen, Sonke",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Visual acuity (the ability to resolve spatial detail) is highly variable across fishes. However, little is known about the evolutionary pressures underlying this variation. We reviewed published literature to create an acuity database for 159 species of ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii). Within a subset of those species for which we had phylogenetic information and anatomically measured acuity data (n=81), we examined relationships between acuity and both morphological (eye size and body size) and ecological (light level, water turbidity, habitat spatial complexity and diet) variables. Acuity was significantly correlated with eye size (P<0.001); a weaker correlation with body size occurred via a correlation between eye and body size (P<0.001). Acuity decreased as light level decreased and turbidity increased; however, these decreases resulted from fishes in dark or murky environments having smaller eyes and bodies than those in bright or clear environments. We also found significantly lower acuity in horizon-dominated habitats than in featureless or complex habitats. Higher acuity in featureless habitats is likely due to species having absolutely larger eyes and bodies in that environment, though eye size relative to body size is not significantly different from that in complex environments. Controlling for relative eye size, we found that species in complex environments have even higher acuity than predicted. We found no relationship between visual acuity and diet. Our results show that eye size is a primary factor underlying variation in fish acuity. We additionally show that habitat type is an important ecological factor that correlates with acuity in certain species.",2017,10.1242/jeb.151183,220,9,1586-1596,NA,Spatial resolution; Light level; Turbidity; Habitat complexity; Diet; Visual ecology
article,Lower-level predictors and behavioral correlates of maximal aerobic capacity and sprint speed among individual lizards,"Albuquerque, Ralph L. and Zani, Peter A. and Garland, Theodore",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The standard paradigm of organismal biology views lower-level traits (e.g. aspects of physiology) as determining organismal performance ability (e.g. maximal sprint speed), which in turn constrains behavior (e.g. social interactions). However, few studies have simultaneously examined all three levels of organization. We used focal observations to record movement behaviors and push-up displays in the field for adult male Sceloporus occidentalis lizards during the breeding season. We then captured animals, measured aspects of their physiology, morphology and performance, and counted ectoparasites and endoparasites as potential predictors of sprint speed and maximal oxygen consumption (V?O2,max). Field behaviors were statistically repeatable, but not strongly so. Sprint speed and V?O2,max were repeatable using residuals from regressions on body mass (speed: r=0.70; V?O2,max: r=0.88). Both calf [}standardized partial regression (path) coefficient 8=0.53] and thigh [}8=-0.37] muscle mass (as residuals from regressions on body mass) were significant predictors of sprint speed; hemoglobin concentration (8=0.42) was a predictor of V?O2,max. In turn, V?O2,max predicted the maximum number of four-legged push-ups per bout (8=0.39). In path analysis, log likelihood ratio tests indicated no direct paths from lower-level traits to behavior, supporting the idea that morphology, in the broad sense, only affects behavior indirectly through measures of performance. Our results show that inter-individual variation in field behaviors can be related to performance ability, which in turn reflect differences in morphology and physiology, although not parasite load. Given the low repeatability of field behaviors, some of the relationships between behavior and performance may be stronger than suggested by our results.",2023,10.1242/jeb.244676,226,5,NA,jeb244676,Behavior; Locomotion; Parasites; Path analysis; Performance; Social displays

article,"ArHsp40 and ArHsp40-2 contribute to stress tolerance and longevity in <i>Artemia franciscana</i>, but only ArHsp40 influences diapause entry","Rowarth, Nathan M. and MacRae, Thomas H.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Embryos of the crustacean Artemia franciscana develop either ovoviviparously or oviparously, yielding swimming larvae (nauplii) or encysted gastrulae (cysts), respectively. Nauplii moult several times and become adults whereas cysts enter diapause, a state of dormancy characterized by exceptionally low metabolism and high stress tolerance. Synthesis of molecular chaperones such as the J-domain proteins ArHsp40 and ArHsp40-2 occurs during embryo development and post-diapause growth of A. franciscana and they influence development and stress tolerance. To further investigate J-domain protein function, ArHsp40 and ArHsp40-2 were each knocked down by RNA interference. Reductions in ArHsp40 and ArHsp40-2 had no effect on adult survival, time to release of cysts and nauplii from females and first-brood size. However, knockdown of both A. franciscana J-domain proteins reduced the longevity and heat tolerance of nauplii, with the loss of ArHsp40 having a greater effect. The knockdown of ArHsp40, but not of ArHsp40-2, caused approximately 50\% of cysts to abort diapause entry and hatch without exposure to an exogenous signal such as low temperature and/or desiccation. Cysts lacking ArHsp40 that entered diapause exhibited decreased stress tolerance as did cysts with reduced ArHsp40-2, the latter to a lesser degree. The longevity of nauplii hatching prematurely from cysts was less than for nauplii arising by other means. The results expand our understanding of Hsp40 function in A. franciscana stress tolerance and development, especially during diapause, and they provide the first example of a molecular chaperone that influences diapause entry.",2018,10.1242/jeb.189001,221,20,NA,jeb189001,Hsp40; J-domain proteins; Dormancy; Gene expression; RNA interference

To explore the function of trehalose metabolism, two trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) genes (Ab-tps1 and Ab-tps2) encoding enzymes catalysing trehalose synthesis, and three trehalase (TRE) genes (Ab-ntre1, Ab-ntre2 and Ab-atre) encoding enzymes catalysing the hydrolysis of trehalose, were identified and investigated. Ab-tps1 and Ab-tps2 were active during certain periods of anoxybiosis for A. besseyi, and Ab- tps2, Ab-ntre1, Abntre-2 and Ab-atre were active during certain periods of recovery. The results of RNA interference experiments suggested that TRE genes regulated each other and both TPS genes, while a single TPS gene only regulated the other TPS gene. However, two TPS genes together could regulate TRE genes, which indicated a feedback mechanism between these genes. All these genes also positively regulated the survival and resumption of active metabolism of the nematode. Genes functioning at re-aeration have a greater impact on nematode survival, suggesting that these genes could play roles in anoxybiosis regulation, but may function within restricted time frames. Changes in trehalose levels matched changes in TRE activity during the anoxybiosis-re-aeration process, suggesting that trehalose may act as an energy supply source. The observation of up-regulation of TPS genes during anoxybiosis suggested a possible signal role of trehalose. Trehalose metabolism genes could also work together to control trehalose levels at a certain level when the nematode is under anaerobic conditions.",2018,10.1242/jeb.171413,221,4,NA,jeb171413,Stress resistance; Anoxybiosis; Re-aeration; Trehalase; Trehalose-6-phosphate synthase
article,Octopamine and tyramine modulate the thermoregulatory fanning response in honey bees (<i>Apis mellifera</i>),"Cook, Chelsea N. and Brent, Colin S. and Breed, Michael D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Biogenic amines regulate the proximate mechanisms underlying most behavior, including those that contribute to the overall success of complex societies. For honey bees, one crucial set of behaviors contributing to the welfare of a colony is involved with nest thermoregulation. Worker honeybees cool the colony by performing a fanning behavior, the expression of which is largely influenced by response thresholds modulated by the social environment. Here, we examined howchanges in biogenicamines affect this group-performed thermoregulatory fanning behavior in honeybees. Concentrations of two biogenic amines, octopamine and tyramine, are significantly lower in active fanners than in non-fanners, but there is no difference in dopamine and serotonin concentrations. Direct feeding of octopamine and tyramine induced a decrease in fanning responses, but only when both amines were included in the treatment. This is the first evidence that fanning behavior is influenced by these two biogenic amines, and this result is consistent with the typical role of these neurotransmitters in regulating locomotor activity in other insects. Individual variation in amine expression also provides a mechanistic link that helps to explain how this group behavior might be coordinated within a colony.",2017,10.1242/jeb.149203,220,10,1925-1930,NA,Biogenic amines; Octopamine; Tyramine; Honey bees; Social behavior
article,Metabolic allometric scaling model: combining cellular transportation and heat dissipation constraints,"Shestopaloff, Yuri K.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Living organisms need energy to be `alive'. Energy is produced by the biochemical processing of nutrients, and the rate of energy production is called the metabolic rate. Metabolism is very important from evolutionary and ecological perspectives, and for organismal development and functioning. It depends on different parameters, of which organism mass is considered to be one of the most important. Simple relationships between the mass of organisms and their metabolic rates were empirically discovered by M. Kleiber in 1932. Such dependence is described by a power function, whose exponent is referred to as the allometric scaling coefficient. With the increase of mass, the metabolic rate usually increases more slowly; if mass increases by two times, the metabolic rate increases less than two times. This fact has far-reaching implications for the organization of life. The fundamental biological and biophysical mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are still not well understood. The present study shows that one such primary mechanism relates to transportation of substances, such as nutrients and waste, at a cellular level. Variations in cell size and associated cellular transportation costs explain the known variance of the allometric exponent. The introduced model also includes heat dissipation constraints. The model agrees with experimental observations and reconciles experimental results across different taxa. It ties metabolic scaling to organismal and environmental characteristics, helps to define perspective directions of future research and allows the prediction of allometric exponents based on characteristics of organisms and the environments they live in.",2016,10.1242/jeb.138305,219,16,2481-2489,NA,Cellular transportation networks; Living organisms; Metabolic rate; Morphology; Nutrients; Plants

Y. and Sepulveda, Maritza and Santos-Carvallo, Macarena and Burns, Jennifer M. and Costa, Daniel P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Our understanding of how air-breathing marine predators cope with environmental variability is limited by our inadequate knowledge of their ecological and physiological parameters. Because of their wide distribution along both coasts of the sub-continent, South American sea lions (Otaria byronia) provide a valuable opportunity to study the behavioral and physiological plasticity of a marine predator in different environments. We measured the oxygen stores and diving behavior of South American sea lions throughout most of its range, allowing us to demonstrate that diving ability and behavior vary across its range. We found no significant differences in mass-specific blood volumes of sea lions among field sites and a negative relationship between mass-specific oxygen storage and size, which suggests that exposure to different habitats and geographical locations better explains oxygen storage capacities and diving capability in South American sea lions than body size alone. The largest animals in our study (individuals from Uruguay) were the shallowest and shortest duration divers, and had the lowest mass-specific total body oxygen stores, while the deepest and longest duration divers (individuals from southern Chile) had significantly larger mass-specific oxygen stores, despite being much smaller animals. Our study suggests that the physiology of air-breathing diving predators is not fixed, but that it can be adjusted, to a certain extent, depending on the ecological setting and or habitat. These adjustments can be thought of as a `training effect': as the animal continues to push its physiological capacity through greater hypoxic exposure, its breath-holding capacity increases.",2016,10.1242/jeb.138677,219,15,2320-2330,NA,Aerobic dive limit; Diving; Oxygen stores; Pinniped; South America

We examined the effect of UVB on the viscoelastic glycoprotein core of glue droplets deposited on the prey capture threads of these webs, hypothesizing that webs built by species that occupy sunny habitats are less susceptible to UVB damage than are webs built by species that prefer shaded forest habitats or by nocturnal species. Threads were tested shortly after being collected in the early morning and after being exposed to UVB energy equivalent to a day of summer sun and three times this amount. Droplets kept in a dark chamber allowed us to evaluate post-production changes. Droplet volume was unaffected by treatments, indicating that UVB did not damage the hygroscopic compounds in the aqueous layer that covers droplets. UVB exposure did not affect energies of droplet extension for species from exposed and partially to mostly shaded habitats (Argiope aurantia, Leucauge venusta and Verrucosa arenata). However, UVB exposure reduced the energy of droplet extension in Micrathena gracilis from shaded forests and Neoscona crucifera, which forages at night. Only in L. venusta did the energy of droplet extension increase after the dark treatment, suggesting endogenous molecular alignment. This study adds UVB irradiation to the list of factors (humidity, temperature and strain rate) known to affect the performance of spider glycoprotein glue, factors that must be more fully understood if adhesives that mimic spider glycoprotein glue are to be produced.",2015,10.1242/jeb.123067,218,17,2675-2684,NA,Adhesion; Biomaterials; Toughness; Silk; Ultraviolet
article,Streamwise vortices destabilize swimming bluegill sunfish (<i>Lepomis macrochirus</i>),"Maia, Anabela and Sheltzer, Alex P. and Tytell, Eric D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In their natural environment, fish must swim stably through unsteady flows and vortices, including vertical vortices, typically shed by posts in a flow, horizontal cross-flow vortices, often produced by a step or a waterfall in a stream, and streamwise vortices, where the axis of rotation is aligned with the direction of the flow. Streamwise vortices are commonly shed by bluff bodies in streams and by ships' propellers and axial turbines, but we know little about their effects on fish. Here, we describe how bluegill sunfish use more energy and are destabilized more often in flow with strong streamwise vorticity. The vortices were created inside a sealed flow tank by an array of four turbines with similar diameter to the experimental fish. We measured oxygen consumption for seven sunfish swimming at 1.5 body lengths (BL) s(-1) with the turbines rotating at 2 Hz and with the turbines off (control). Simultaneously, we filmed the fish ventrally and recorded the fraction of time spent maneuvering side-to-side and accelerating forward. Separately, we also recorded lateral and ventral video for a combination of swimming speeds (0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 BL s(-1)) and turbine speeds (0, 1, 2 and 3 Hz), immediately after turning the turbines on and 10 min later to test for accommodation. Bluegill sunfish are negatively affected by streamwise vorticity. Spills (loss of heading), maneuvers and accelerations were more frequent when the turbines were on than in the control treatment. These unsteady behaviors, particularly acceleration, correlated with an increase in oxygen consumption in the vortex flow. Bluegill sunfish are generally fast to recover from roll perturbations and do so by moving their pectoral fins. The frequency of spills decreased after the turbines had run for 10 min, but was still markedly higher than in the control, showing that fish partially adapt to streamwise vorticity, but not completely. Coping with streamwise vorticity may be an important energetic cost for stream fishes or migratory fishes.",2015,10.1242/jeb.114363,218,5,786+,NA,Oxygen consumption; Fish swimming; Respirometry; Turbulence; Kinematics

The higher constant perfusion of the lung circulation and the incapability of adjusting the right-left shunt in left-denervated snakes persisted over time, providing a unique model for investigation of the long-term consequences of cardiac shunting in a squamate. Oxygen uptake recorded at rest and during spontaneous and forced activity was not affected by removing control of the cardiac shunt. Furthermore, metabolic rate and energetic balance during the post-prandial metabolic increment, plus the food conversion efficiency and growth rate, were all similarly unaffected.

However, despite the research effort that has been invested in the study of learning and memory in haematophagous insects, hitherto few conclusive results have been obtained. Adapting procedures largely validated in Drosophila, honeybees and butterflies, we demonstrate here that the proboscis extension response (PER) of the haematophagous insect Rhodnius prolixus can be modulated by non-associative (habituation) and associative (aversive conditioning) learning forms. Thermal stimuli were used as both unconditional stimulus (appetitive temperatures) and negative reinforcement (thermal shock). In the first part of this work, the PER was habituated and dishabituated to thermal stimuli, demonstrating the true central processing of information and discarding motor fatigue or sensory adaptation. Habituation was revealed to be modulated by the spatial context. In the second part, bugs that were submitted to aversive operant conditioning stopped responding with PER to thermal stimulation more quickly than by habituation. They were able to use their training experience when tested up to 72. h later. Our work constitutes the first demonstration of PER habituation and conditioning in a blood-sucking insect and provides reproducible experimental tools for the study of the mechanisms underlying learning and memory in disease vectors.",2013,10.1242/jeb.079491,216,5,892-900,NA,haematophagous insect; cognitive ability; memory retention; disease vector

Aran and Katija, Kakani and Fontes, Jorge and Afonso, Pedro and Shorter, K. Alex",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Squid are mobile, diverse, ecologically important marine organisms whose behavior and habitat use can have substantial impacts on ecosystems and fisheries. However, as a consequence in part of the inherent challenges of monitoring squid in their natural marine environment, fine-scale behavioral observations of these free-swimming, soft-bodied animals are rare. Bio-logging tags provide an emerging way to remotely study squid behavior in their natural environments. Here, we applied a novel, high-resolution bio-logging tag (ITAG) to seven veined squid, Loligo forbesii, in a controlled experimental environment to quantify their short-term (24 h) behavioral patterns. Tag accelerometer, magnetometer and pressure data were used to develop automated gait classification algorithms based on overall dynamic body acceleration, and a subset of the events were assessed and confirmed using concurrently collected video data. Finning, flapping and jetting gaits were observed, with the low-acceleration finning gaits detected most often. The animals routinely used a finning gait to ascend (climb) and then glide during descent with fins extended in the tank's water column, a possible strategy to improve swimming efficiency for these negatively buoyant animals. Arms- and mantle-first directional swimming were observed in approximately equal proportions, and the squid were slightly but significantly more active at night. These tag-based observations are novel for squid and indicate a more efficient mode of movement than suggested by some previous observations. The combination of sensing, classification and estimation developed and applied here will enable the quantification of squid activity patterns in the wild to provide new biological information, such as in situ identification of behavioral states, temporal patterns, habitat requirements, energy expenditure and interactions of squid through space-time in the wild.",2019,10.1242/jeb.198226,222,24,NA,jeb198226,Persistent monitoring; Gait; Movement patterns; Energetics; Biotelemetry

Ureotelic elasmobranchs are thought to have low branchial ammonia permeability, and little is known about Rh function in this ancient group. We cloned Rh cDNAs (Rhag, Rhbg and Rhp2) and evaluated gill ammonia handling in Squalus acanthias. Control ammonia excretion was <5\% of urea-N excretion. Sharks exposed to high environmental ammonia (HEA; 1 mmol(-1) NH4HCO3) for 48 h exhibited active ammonia uptake against partial pressure and electrochemical gradients for 36 h before net excretion was re-established. Plasma total ammonia rose to seawater levels by 2 h, but dropped significantly below them by 24-48 h. Control Delta P-NH3 (the partial pressure gradient of NH3) across the gills became even more negative (outwardly directed) during HEA. Transepithelial potential increased by 30 mV, negating a parallel rise in the Nernst potential, such that the outwardly directed NH4+ electrochemical gradient remained unchanged. Urea-N excretion was enhanced by 90\% from 12 to 48 h, more than compensating for ammonia-N uptake. Expression of Rhp2 (gills, kidney) and Rhbg (kidney) did not change, but branchial Rhbg and erythrocytic Rhag declined during HEA. mRNA expression of branchial Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) increased at 24 h and that of H+-ATPase decreased at 48 h, while expression of the potential metabolon components Na+/H+ exchanger2 (NHE2) and carbonic anhydrase IV (CA-IV) remained unchanged.

Regional heterothermy is relatively well understood in endotherms, where physiological mechanisms maintain heterogeneity. However, less is known about regional heterothermy in ectotherms, where behavioral mechanisms are more important for generating thermal variation. In particular, whether small and elongate ectotherms with high surface area to volume ratios such as diminutive snakes can maintain regional heterothermy, despite rapid thermal equilibration, is not yet known. We measured regional variation in body temperature and tested whether environmental heterogeneity is used to generate regional heterothermy in the ring-necked snake (Diadophis punctatus) using both field and laboratory studies. We found that ring-necked snakes have robust regional heterothermy in a variety of contexts, despite their small body size and elongate body shape. Temperature variation along the length of their bodies was not detectable when measured externally. However, snakes had higher mouth than cloacal temperatures both in the field and in laboratory thermal gradients. Further, this regional heterothermy was maintained even in ambient laboratory conditions, where the thermal environment was relatively homogeneous. Our results indicate that regional heterothermy in ring-necked snakes is not solely driven by environmental variation but is instead linked to physiological or morphological mechanisms that maintain regional variation in body temperature irrespective of environmental context.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245380,226,11,NA,jeb245380,Body temperature heterothermy; Squamate; Thermal biology; Thermal heterogeneity
article,"A thermal stressor, propranololand long-term memory formation in freshly collected <i>Lymnaea</i>","Swinton, Cayley and Swinton, Erin and Phillips, Iain and Lukowiak, Ken",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"A heat stressor (1 h at 30 degrees C) in Lymnaea stagnalis before operant conditioning training of aerial respiration is sufficient to enhance long-term memory (LTM) formation in `average' cognitive ability, laboratory-reared, inbred snails. However, in freshly collected outbred snails, the same heat stressor blocks LTM formation in `smart' cognitive phenotype but not in average cognitive phenotype strains. Here, we hypothesize that (1) preventing the stress associated with the heat stressor before training allows LTM to form in the smart phenotype strains; and (2) alleviating the stress before a memory recall session allows a formed LTM to be recalled in the smart phenotype strains. We found that an injection of propranolol, which mitigates the stressor, before snails experience the heat stressor enabled two strains of the smart phenotype snails to form LTM, consistent with our first hypothesis. However, the injection of propranolol before a memory test session did not alleviate a memory recall block in the smart phenotype snails. Thus, our second hypothesis was not supported. Therefore, smart cognitive phenotype snails encountering a heat stressor have an inability to form LTM, but this inability can be overcome by the pre-injection of propranolol.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242293,224,9,NA,jeb242293,Thermal stress; Lymnaea; Cognitive alteration; Stress

Here, we exploited the broadly manipulable freeze tolerance of larval malt flies (Chymomyza costata) to uncover cell and tissue morphological changes associated with freeze mortality. Diapause induction, cold acclimation and dietary proline supplementation generate malt fly variants ranging from weakly to extremely freeze tolerant. Using confocal microscopy and immunostaining of the fat body, Malpighian tubules and anterior midgut, we described tissue and cytoskeletal (F-actin and alpha-tubulin) morphologies among these variants after exposure to various cold stresses (from chilling at -5 degrees C to extreme freezing at -196 degrees C), and upon recovery from cold exposure. Fat body tissue appeared to be the most susceptible to cryoinjury: freezing caused coalescence of lipid droplets, loss of a-tubulin structure and apparent aggregation of F-actin. A combination of diapause and cold acclimation substantially lowered the temperature at which these morphological disruptions occurred. Larvae that recovered from a freezing challenge repaired F-actin aggregation but not lipid droplet coalescence or alpha-tubulin structure. Our observations indicate that lipid coalescence and damage to alpha-tubulin are non-lethal forms of freeze injury, and suggest that repair or removal (rather than protection) of actin proteins is a potential mechanism of acquired freeze tolerance.",2018,10.1242/jeb.189647,221,21,NA,jeb189647,Freeze tolerance; Chymomyza; Diapause; Cytoskeleton; Actin; Drosophilid
article,Exogenous stress hormones alter energetic and nutrient costs of development and metamorphosis,"Kirschman, Lucas J. and Mccue, Marshall D. and Boyles, Justin G. and Warne, Robin W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Variation in environmental conditions during larval life stages can shape development during critical windows and have lasting effects on the adult organism. Changes in larval developmental rates in response to environmental conditions, for example, can trade off with growth to determine body size and condition at metamorphosis, which can affect adult survival and fecundity. However, it is unclear how use of energy and nutrients shape trade-offs across life-stage transitions because no studies have quantified these costs of larval development and metamorphosis. We used an experimental approach to manipulate physiological stress in larval amphibians, along with respirometry and C-13-breath testing to quantify the energetic and nutritional costs of development and metamorphosis. Central to larval developmental responses to environmental conditions is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal/interrenal (HPA/I) axis, which regulates development, as well as energy homeostasis and stress responses across many taxa. Given these pleiotropic effects of HPA/I activity, manipulation of the HPA/I axis may provide insight into costs of metamorphosis. We measured the energetic and nutritional costs across the entire larval period and metamorphosis in a larval amphibian exposed to exogenous glucocorticoid (GC) hormones - the primary hormone secreted by the HPA/I axis. We measured metabolic rates and dry mass across larval ontogeny, and quantified lipid stores and nutrient oxidation via C-13-breath testing during metamorphosis, under control and GC-exposed conditions. Changes in dry mass match metamorphic states previously reported in the literature, but dynamics of metabolism were influenced by the transition from aquatic to terrestrial respiration. GC-treated larvae had lower dry mass, decreased fat stores and higher oxygen consumption during stages where controls were conserving energy. GC-treated larvae also oxidized greater amounts of C-13-labelled protein stores. These results provide evidence for a proximate cause of the physiological trade-off between larval growth and development, and provide insight into the energetic and nutrient costs that shape fitness trade-offs across life stages.",2017,10.1242/jeb.164830,220,18,3391-3397,NA,Amphibian; Life history; Trade-off; Glucocorticoids; Corticosterone; Stable isotopes
article,The incubation environment does not explain significant variation in heart rate plasticity among avian embryos,"Cones, Alexandra G. and Schneider, Eve R. and Westneat, David F.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The conditions an organism experiences during development can modify how they plastically respond to short-term changes in their environment later in life. This can be adaptive because the optimal average trait value and the optimal plastic change in trait value in response to the environment may differ across different environments. For example, early developmental temperatures can adaptively modify how reptiles, fish and invertebrates metabolically respond to temperature. However, whether individuals within populations respond differently (a prerequisite to adaptive evolution), and whether this occurs in birds, which are only ectothermic for part of their life cycle, is not known. We experimentally tested these possibilities by artificially incubating the embryos of Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) at constant or variable temperatures. We measured their consequent heart rate reaction norms to short-term changes in egg temperature and tracked their growth. Contrary to expectations, the early thermal environment did not modify heart rate reaction norms, but regardless, these reaction norms differed among individuals. Embryos with higher average heart rates were smaller upon hatching, but heart rate reaction norms did not predict subsequent growth. Our data also suggests that the thermal environment may affect both the variance in heart rate reaction norms and their covariance with growth. Thus, individual avian embryos can vary in their plasticity to temperature, and in contrast to fully ectothermic taxa, the early thermal environment does not explain this variance.

article,An hourglass mechanism controls torpor bout length in hibernating garden dormice,"Ruf, Thomas and Gasch, Kristina and Stalder, Gabrielle and Gerritsmann, Hanno and Giroud, Sylvain",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Hibernating mammals drastically lower their rate of oxygen consumption and body temperature (Tb) for several weeks, but regularly rewarm and stay euthermic for brief periods (<30 h). It has been hypothesized that these periodic arousals are driven by the development of a metabolic imbalance during torpor; that is, the accumulation or the depletion of metabolites or the accrual of cellular damage that can be eliminated only in the euthermic state. We obtained oxygen consumption (as a proxy of metabolic rate) and Tb at 7 min intervals over entire torpor-arousal cycles in the garden dormouse (Eliomys quercinus). Torpor bout duration was highly dependent on mean oxygen consumption during the torpor bout. Oxygen consumption during torpor, in turn, was elevated by Tb, which fluctuated only slightly in dormice kept at similar to 3-8 degrees C. This corresponds to awell-known effect of higher T-b on shortening torpor bout lengths in hibernators. Arousal duration was independent from prior torpor length, but arousal mean oxygen consumption increased with prior torpor T-b. These results, particularly the effect of torpor oxygen consumption on torpor bout length, point to an hourglass mechanism of torpor control, i.e. the correction of a metabolic imbalance during arousal. This conclusion is in line with previous comparative studies providing evidence for significant interspecific inverse relationships between the duration of torpor bouts and metabolism in torpor. Thus, a simple hourglass mechanism is sufficient to explain torpor/arousal cycles, without the need to involve non-temperature-compensated circadian rhythms.",2021,10.1242/jeb.243456,224,23,NA,jeb243456,Cycles; Interbout euthermia; Metabolic rate; Periodic arousal

Such knowledge also provides information necessary to predict responses of such traits to environmental changes. Studies on latitudinal trends in insect immunity have so far yielded contradictory results, suggesting that multispecies approaches with highly standardised experimental conditions are needed. Here, we studied among-population differences of two parameters reflecting constitutive immunity-phenoloxidase (PO) and lytic activity, using common-garden design on three distantly related moth species represented by populations ranging from northern Finland to Georgia (Caucasus). The larvae were reared at different temperatures and on different host plants under a crossed factors experimental design. Haemolymph samples for measurement of immune status were taken from the larvae strictly synchronously. Clear among-population differences could be shown only for PO activity in one species (elevated activity in the northern populations). There was some indication that the cases of total absence of lytic activity were more common in southern populations. The effects of temperature, host and sex on the immunological traits studied remained highly species specific. Some evidence was found that lytic activity may be involved in mediating trade-offs between immunity and larval growth performance. In contrast, PO activity rarely covaried with fitness-related traits, and neither were the values of PO and lytic activity correlated with each other. The relatively inconsistent nature of the detected patterns suggests that studies on geographic differences in immunological traits should involve multiple species, and rely on several immunological indices if general trends are a point of interest.",2017,10.1242/jeb.154310,220,14,2606-2615,NA,Parasitoid; Climate change; Geographic variation; Immunology; Lepidoptera; Life-history traits

One component of the developmental environment, which is likely central to early life oxidative stress among ectothermic and oviparous species, is that of temperature. We investigated how incubation temperature manipulations affect oxidative damage and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans) hatchlings. First, to determine whether temperature fluctuations elicit oxidative stress, eggs from clutches were randomly assigned to either a constant (29.5 degrees C) or daily fluctuating temperature incubation (28.7 +/- 3 degrees C) treatment. Second, to assess the effect of temperature fluctuation frequency on oxidative stress, eggs were incubated in one of three fluctuating incubation regimes: 28.7 +/- 3 degrees C fluctuations every 12 h (hyper), 24 h (normal) or 48 h (hypo). Third, we tested the influence of average incubation temperature by incubating eggs in a daily fluctuating incubation temperature regime with a mean temperature of 26.5 degrees C (low), 27.1 degrees C (medium) or 27.7 degrees C (high). Although the accumulation of oxidative damage in hatchlings was unaffected by any thermal manipulation, TAC was affected by both temperature fluctuation frequency and average incubation temperature. Individuals incubated with a low frequency of temperature fluctuations had reduced TAC, while incubation at a lower average temperature was associated with enhanced TAC. These results indicate that although sufficient to prevent oxidative damage, TAC is influenced by developmental thermal environments, potentially because of temperature-mediated changes in metabolic rate.

T. and Staedler, M. M. and Mayer, K. A. and Williams, T. M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Sea otters (Enhydra lutris) have the highest mass-specific metabolic rate of any marine mammal, which is superimposed on the inherently high costs of reproduction and lactation in adult females. These combined energetic demands have been implicated in the poor body condition and increased mortality of female sea otters nearing the end of lactation along the central California coast. However, the cost of lactation is unknown and currently cannot be directly measured for this marine species in the wild. Here, we quantified the energetic demands of immature sea otters across five developmental stages as a means of assessing the underlying energetic challenges associated with pup rearing that may contribute to poor maternal condition. Activity-specific metabolic rates, daily activity budgets and field metabolic rates (FMR) were determined for each developmental stage. Mean FMR of pre-molt pups was 2.29 +/- 0.81 MJ day(-1) and increased to 6.16 +/- 2.46 and 7.41 +/- 3.17 MJ day(-1) in post-molt pups and dependent immature animals, respectively. Consequently, daily energy demands of adult females increase 17\% by 3 weeks postpartum and continue increasing to 96\% above pre-pregnancy levels by the average age of weaning. Our results suggest that the energetics of pup rearing superimposed on small body size, marine living and limited on-board energetic reserves conspire to make female sea otters exceptionally vulnerable to energetic shortfalls. By controlling individual fitness, maternal behavior and pup provisioning strategies, this underlying metabolic challenge appears to be a major factor influencing current population trends in southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis).",2014,10.1242/jeb.099739,217,12,2053-2061,NA,Energetics; Enhydra lutris; Maternal investment; Ontogeny; Oxygen consumption
article,Insect diapause: from a rich history to an exciting future,"Denlinger, David L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Diapause, a stage-specific developmental arrest, is widely exploited by insects to bridge unfavorable seasons. Considerable progress has been made in understanding the ecology, physiology and evolutionary implications of insect diapause, yet intriguing questions remain. A more complete understanding of diapause processes on Earth requires a better geographic spread of investigations, including more work in the tropics and at high latitudes. Questions surrounding energy management and trade-offs between diapause and non-diapause remain understudied. We know little about how maternal effects direct the diapause response, and regulators of prolonged diapause are also poorly understood. Numerous factors that were recently linked to diapause are still waiting to be placed in the regulatory network leading from photoreception to engagement of the diapause program. These factors include epigenetic processes and small noncoding RNAs, and emerging data also suggest a role for the microbiome in diapause regulation. Another intriguing feature of diapause is the complexity of the response, resulting in a diverse suite of responses that comprise the diapause syndrome. Select transcription factors likely serve as master switches turning on these diverse responses, but we are far from understanding the full complexity. The richness of species displaying diapause offers a platform for seeking common components of a `diapause toolbox'. Across latitudes, during invasion events and in a changing climate, diapause offers grand opportunities to probe evolutionary change and speciation. At a practical level, diapause responses can be manipulated for insect control and long-term storage. Diapausing insects also contain a treasure trove of pharmacological compounds and offer promising models for human health.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245329,226,4,NA,jeb245329,Dormancy; Overwintering; Seasonality
article,The visual spectral sensitivity of the Chilean recluse spider <i>Loxosceles laeta</i>,"Tapia, Felipe and Olivares, Jesus and Schmachtenberg, Oliver",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Spiders are a large group of arthropods and nearly omnipresent in warm and temperate climates. They rely on tactile and visual information to hunt and breed, but compared with their mechanical senses, little is known about their visual systems. In this study, we analyzed the visual spectral sensitivity of the Chilean recluse spider Loxosceles laeta, a synanthropic species posing a significant threat to humans, using electroretinogram recordings of its three eye types and open field tests with localized chromatic illumination for behavioral analysis. The electroretinogram displayed two sensitivity peaks in the ultraviolet and green ranges, and no differences were observed between the three eye types and between male and female specimens. Selective chromatic adaptation reduced overall light sensitivity, but did not support the expression of more than one type of rhodopsin in photoreceptors. The open field tests revealed a preference for corners over side areas, and an increased exploration of open field areas illuminated by shorter wavelength (violet to green) light compared with non-illuminated areas, while no behavioral responses to red and near-infrared light were observed. These data suggest that L. laeta has monochromatic vision without spectral specializations in its three secondary eye pairs.",2020,10.1242/jeb.217133,223,2,NA,jeb217133,Arthropods; Eye; Retina; Ultraviolet vision; Electroretinogram; Open field test
article,Timing manipulations reveal the lack of a causal link across timing of annual-cycle stages in a long-distance migrant,"Tomotani, Barbara M. and de la Hera, Ivan and Lange, Cynthia Y. M. J. G. and van Lith, Bart and Meddle, Simone L. and Both, Christiaan and Visser, Marcel E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Organisms need to time their annual-cycle stages, like breeding and migration, to occur at the right time of the year. Climate change has shifted the timing of annual-cycle stages at different rates, thereby tightening or lifting time constraints of these annual-cycle stages, a rarely studied consequence of climate change. The degree to which these constraints are affected by climate change depends on whether consecutive stages are causally linked (scenario I) or whether the timing of each stage is independent of other stages (scenario II). Under scenario I, a change in timing in one stage has knock-on timing effects on subsequent stages, whereas under scenario II, a shift in the timing of one stage affects the degree of overlap with previous and subsequent stages. To test this, we combined field manipulations, captivity measurements and geolocation data. We advanced and delayed hatching dates in pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) and measured how the timing of subsequent stages (male moult and migration) were affected. There was no causal effect of manipulated hatching dates on the onset of moult and departure to Africa. Thus, advancing hatching dates reduced the male moult-breeding overlap with no effect on the moult-migration interval. Interestingly, the wintering location of delayed males was more westwards, suggesting that delaying the termination of breeding carries over to winter location. Because we found no causal linkage of the timing of annual-cycle stages, climate change could shift these stages at different rates, with the risk that the time available for some becomes so short that this will have major fitness consequences.",2019,10.1242/jeb.201467,222,17,NA,jeb201467,European pied flycatcher; Ficedula hypoleuca; Climate change; Migration; Moult; Reproduction
article,Maternally derived yolk antioxidants buffer the developing avian embryo against oxidative stress induced by hyperoxia,"Watson, Hannah and Salmon, Pablo and Isaksson, Caroline",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In oviparous animals, maternally transferred antioxidants protect the embryo from oxidative damage from high rates of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production incurred by rapid growth. Elevated ROS exposure, beyond that incurred by normal growth, can occur as a result of exposure to exogenous factors (e.g. pollutants, toxins, radiation), increasing the risk of oxidative damage, with potentially adverse consequences for embryonic development and long-term fitness. The capacity of the avian embryo's antioxidant protection system to counter an increased exogenous oxidative threat is poorly understood. We induced an external oxidative challenge via experimental increase in ambient oxygen concentration throughout incubation of wild great tit Parus major eggs in the laboratory. At day 11 of incubation, brain tissue revealed no consistent differences in oxidative stress status {[}as measured by antioxidant levels (superoxide dismutase and total glutathione), lipid peroxidation and telomere length] between control (21\% oxygen) and hyperoxic (40\% oxygen) embryos. However, the level of vitamin E was significantly lower and lipid peroxidation was significantly higher in yolks of eggs reared under elevated oxygen concentrations. The results suggest that maternally derived yolk antioxidants successfully buffer developing embryonic tissues against an increased exogenous oxidative threat. Furthermore, vitamin E plays a more important role in protecting the embryo than carotenoids. However, the depletion of antioxidants and increased peroxidation of lipids in the yolk could have negative consequences for embryonic development, in particular for the brain and heart that require highly un saturated fatty acids, and protection against the oxidative burst following hatching.",2018,10.1242/jeb.179465,221,13,NA,179465,Antioxidant; Hyperoxia; Lipid peroxidation; Oxidative stress; Prenatal development; Vitamin E
article,Learning to starve: impacts of food limitation beyond the stress period,"McCue, Marshall D. and Terblanche, John S. and Benoit, Joshua B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Starvation is common among wild animal populations, and many individuals experience repeated bouts of starvation over the course of their lives. Although much information has been gained through laboratory studies of acute starvation, little is known about how starvation affects an animal once food is again available (i.e. during the refeeding and recovery phases). Many animals exhibit a curious phenomenon - some seem to `get better' at starving following exposure to one or more starvation events - by this we mean that they exhibit potentially adaptive responses, including reduced rates of mass loss, reduced metabolic rates, and lower costs of digestion. During subsequent refeedings they may also exhibit improved digestive efficiency and more rapid mass gain. Importantly, these responses can last until the next starvation bout or even be inherited and expressed in the subsequent generation. Currently, however, little is known about the molecular regulation and physiological mechanisms underlying these changes. Here, we identify areas of research that can fill in the most pressing knowledge gaps. In particular, we highlight how recently refined techniques (e.g. stable isotope tracers, quantitative magnetic resonance and thermal measurement) as well as next-generation sequencing approaches (e.g. RNA-seq, proteomics and holobiome sequencing) can address specific starvation-focused questions. We also describe outstanding unknowns ripe for future research regarding the timing and severity of starvation, and concerning the persistence of these responses and their interactions with other ecological stressors.",2017,10.1242/jeb.157867,220,23,4330-4338,NA,Bioenergetics; Diet; Epigenetics; Fasting; Nutrition; Weight loss

However, whether cutaneous O-2 uptake is the dominant route of uptake remains under debate; all evidence supporting this hypothesis has been derived using indirect measurements. Here, we used partitioned chambers and direct measurements of oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion to quantify cutaneous and branchial exchanges in Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii) at rest and following exhaustive exercise. Hagfish primarily relied on the gills for both O-2 uptake (81.0\%) and ammonia excretion (70.7\%). Following exercise, both O-2 uptake and ammonia excretion increased, but only across the gill; cutaneous exchange was not increased. When branchial O-2 availability was reduced by exposure to anteriorly localized hypoxia (similar to 4.6 kPa O-2), cutaneous O-2 consumption was only slightly elevated on an absolute basis. These results refute a major role for cutaneous O-2 acquisition in the Pacific hagfish.",2016,10.1242/jeb.141598,219,18,2814-2818,NA,Exercise; Metabolic rate; EPOC; Respiration; Agnathan; Ammonia
article,The high cost of reproduction in sea otters necessitates unique physiological adaptations,"Thometz, Nicole M. and Kendall, Traci L. and Richter, Beau P. and Williams, Terrie M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Superimposed on inherently high basal metabolic demands, the additional energetic requirements of reproduction can push female sea otters beyond physiological limits. Indeed, the resulting energy imbalance contributes to disproportionately high rates of mortality at the end of lactation in this species. To examine and quantify metabolic changes associated with reproduction, we measured the resting metabolic rate (RMR) of a female sea otter across gestation, lactation and non-reproductive periods. Concurrently, measurements were made on a non-breeding control female. Our results suggest that RMR declines during gestation. Conversely, RMR increases during lactation, reaches a peak at 3-4 months postpartum, and remains elevated until weaning. Combining these direct measurements with published data, we found the cost of pup rearing to be significantly higher than previously estimated. High baseline energy demands and limited energy reserves, combined with significant lactation and pup rearing costs, appear to necessitate metabolic and thermal lability during key reproductive stages.",2016,10.1242/jeb.138891,219,15,2260-2264,NA,Enhydra lutris; Gestation; Lactation; Resting metabolic rate; Energetics; Parental investment
article,Increased aggression during pregnancy comes at a higher metabolic cost,"Seebacher, F. and Ward, A. J. W. and Wilson, R. S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Aggressive behaviour is linked to fitness, but it is metabolically costly. Changes in metabolic demand during the reproductive cycle could constrain activity and thereby modulate behavioural phenotypes. We predicted that increased metabolic demands in late pregnancy would lead to reduced aggression and a lower metabolic cost of behaviour in the mosquitofish Gambusia holbrooki. Contrary to our prediction, females became more aggressive in late pregnancy, but metabolic scope (i.e. the metabolic energy available for activity and behaviour) decreased. Consequently, late-stage pregnant females spent significantly more of their available metabolic scope on aggressive behaviour. Hence, as pregnancy progressed, females showed increasingly risky behaviour by depleting metabolic resources available for activities other than fighting. We argue that the metabolic cost of behaviour, and possibly personality, is best expressed with reference to metabolic scope, rather than resting metabolic rates or concentrations of metabolites. This dependence on metabolic scope could render reproductive success sensitive to environmental changes.",2013,10.1242/jeb.079756,216,5,771-776,NA,metabolic scope; oxygen consumption; reproduction; temperature; Gambusia

To mediate this problem and maintain fish biomass in aquatic ecosystems, catch-and-release fishing, whereby a fish is caught and immediately released, has been implemented in many countries. It is unclear whether the injuries to the mouth that are caused by the hook have an impact on feeding performance of fishes. Using high-speed video and computational fluid dynamics (CFD), we asked whether injuries around the mouth caused by fishing hooks have a negative impact on suction feeding performance (measured as maximum prey velocity) of the commonly angled marine shiner perch (Cymatogaster aggregata). We hypothesized that fish with mouth injuries would exhibit decreased feeding performance compared with controls. Ten shiner perch were caught using scientific angling and 10 were caught using a seine net. Feeding events were then recorded at 500 frames per second using a high-speed camera. Compared with the control group, maximum prey velocity was significantly lower in the injured group (P<0.01). Maximum gape, time to peak gape, maximum jaw protrusion and predator-prey distance were comparable between the control and injured groups, leading us to conclude that the injury-induced hole in the buccal cavity wall reduced the pressure gradient during mouth expansion, thereby reducing the velocity of water entering the fish's mouth. This was confirmed with our CFD modelling. Fishing injuries in nature are likely to depress feeding performance of fish after they have been released, although it is currently unclear whether this has a significant impact on survival.",2018,10.1242/jeb.180935,221,19,NA,jeb180935,Fishing; Prey capture; Catch-and-release; Mortality; Conservation; CFD
article,Temperature fluctuations and estrone sulfate affect gene expression via different mechanisms to promote female development in a species with temperature-dependent sex determination,"Marroquin-Flores, Rosario A. and Paitz, Ryan T. and Bowden, Rachel M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Variation in developmental conditions can affect a variety of embryonic processes and shape a number of phenotypic characteristics that can affect offspring throughout their lives. This is particularly true of oviparous species where development typically occurs outside of the female, and studies have shown that traits such as survival and behavior can be altered by both temperature and exposure to steroid hormones during development. In species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), the fate of gonadal development can be affected by temperature and by maternal estrogens present in the egg at oviposition, and there is evidence that these factors can affect gene expression patterns. Here, we explored how thermal fluctuations and exposure to an estrogen metabolite, estrone sulfate, affect the expression of several genes known to be involved in sexual differentiation: Kdm6b, Dmrt1, Sox9, FoxL2 and Cyp19A1. We found that most of the genes responded to both temperature and estrone sulfate exposure, but that the responses to these factors were not identical, in that estrone sulfate effects occur downstream of temperature effects. Our findings demonstrate that conjugated hormones such as estrone sulfate are capable of influencing temperature-dependent pathways to potentially alter how embryos respond to temperature, and highlight the importance of studying the interaction of maternal hormone and temperature effects.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244211,225,16,NA,jeb244211,Steroid hormone; Fluctuating temperature; Sexual differentiation; Intron retention; Maternal effects

Thermal transient receptor potential ion channels (thermo-TRPs) can detect temperature signals and are involved in the regulation of thermogenesis and energy homeostasis. Further, the gut microbiota have also been implicated in thermogenesis and obesity. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that thermo-TRPs and gut microbiota are involved in reducing diet-induced obesity (DIO) during low temperature exposure. C57BL/6J mice in obese (body mass gain >45\%), lean (body mass gain <15\%) and control (body mass gain <1\%) groups were exposed to high (23 +/- 1 degrees C) or low (4 +/- 1 degrees C) ambient temperature for 28 days. Our data showed that low temperature exposure attenuated DIO, but enhanced brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis. Low temperature exposure also resulted in increased noradrenaline (NA) concentrations in the hypothalamus, decreased TRP melastatin 8 (TRPM8) expression in the small intestine, and altered composition and diversity of gut microbiota. In DIO mice, there was a decrease in overall energy intake along with a reduction in TRP ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) expression and an increase in NA concentration in the small intestine. DIO mice also showed increases in Oscillospira, [}Ruminococcus], Lactococcus and Christensenella and decreases in Prevotella, Odoribacter and Lactobacillus at the genus level in fecal samples. Together, our data suggest that thermos-TRPs and gut microbiota are involved in thermogenesis and energy metabolism during low temperature exposure in DIO mice.",2020,10.1242/jeb.218974,223,11,NA,jeb218974,Low temperature exposure; Gut microbiota; Obesity; Thermogenesis; Thermal transient receptor potential
article,Suction feeding across fish life stages: flow dynamics from larvae to adults and implications for prey capture,"Yaniv, Sarit and Elad, David and Holzman, Roi",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Suction feeding is thought to be the primary mode of prey capture in most larval fishes. Similar to adult suction feeders, larvae swim towards their prey while rapidly expanding their mouth cavity to generate an inward flow of water that draws the prey into the mouth. Although larvae are known to experience flows with lower Reynolds numbers than adults, it is unclear how the suction-induced flow field changes throughout ontogeny, and how such changes relate to prey capture performance. To address these questions, we determined mouth dimensions and opening speeds in Sparus aurata from first-feeding larvae to adults. We proceeded to develop a computational model of mouth expansion in order to analyze the scaling of suction flows under the observed parameters. Larval fish produced suction flows that were around two orders of magnitude slower than those of adults. Compared with adult fish, in which flow speed decays steeply with distance in front of the mouth, flow speed decayed more gradually in larval fish. This difference indicates that viscous forces in low Reynolds number flows modify the spatial distribution flow speed in front of the mouth. Consequently, simulated predator-prey encounters showed that larval fish could capture inert prey from a greater distance compared with adults. However, if prey attempted to escape then larval fish performed poorly: simulations inferred capture success in only weakly escaping prey immediately in front of the mouth. These ontogenetic changes in Reynolds number, suction-induced flow field and feeding performance could explain a widespread ontogenetic diet shift from passive prey at early life stages to evasive prey as larvae mature.",2014,10.1242/jeb.104331,217,20,3748-3757,NA,CFD; Critical period; Laminar flow; Larval fish; Reynolds numbers

Based on a few previous studies, the capacity for paracellular nutrient absorption seems greater in flying mammals than in nonflying mammals, but there has been little investigation of the mechanisms driving this difference. Therefore, we studied three species each of bats (Artibeus lituratus, Sturnira lilium and Carollia perspicillata) and nonflying mammals (Akodon montensis, Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus). Using standard pharmacokinetic techniques in intact animals, we confirmed the greater paracellular nutrient absorption in the fliers, comparing one species in each group. Then we conducted in situ intestinal perfusions on individuals of all species. In both approaches, we measured the absorption of 3OMD-glucose, a nonmetabolizable glucose analog absorbed both paracellularly and transcellularly, as well as L-arabinose, which has no mediated transport. Fractional absorption of L-arabinose was three times higher in the bat (S. lilium: 1.2 +/- 0.24) than in the rodent (A. montensis: 0.35 +/- 0.04), whereas fractional absorption of 3OMD-glucose was complete in both species (1.46 +/- 0.4 and 0.97 +/- 0.12, respectively). In agreement, bats exhibited two to 12 times higher L-arabinose clearance per square centimeter nominal surface area than rodents in intestinal perfusions. Using L-arabinose, we estimated that the contribution of the paracellular pathway to total glucose absorption was higher in all three bats (109-137\%) than in the rodents (13-39\%). These findings contribute to an emerging picture that reliance on the paracellular pathway for nutrient absorption is much greater in bats relative to nonflying mammals and that this difference is driven by differences in intestinal permeability to nutrient-sized molecules.",2014,10.1242/jeb.104927,217,18,3311-3317,NA,Intestine; Mediated absorption; Paracellular absorption; Arabinose; Flight; Bats; Intestinal perfusion; Akodon montensis; Sturnira lilium; Artibeus lituratus; Carollia perspicillata; Mus musculus; Rattus norvegicus

However, the regulatory mechanisms that underpin this metabolic suppression have yet to be elucidated. 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is the cellular `master' energy effector and we hypothesized that alterations in the AMPK pathway contribute to metabolic reorganization in hypoxic naked mole-rat skeletal muscle. To test this hypothesis, we exposed naked mole-rats to 4 h of normoxia (21\% O-2) or severe hypoxia (3\% O-2), while indirectly measuring whole-animal metabolic rate and fuel preference. We then isolated skeletal muscle and assessed protein expression and post-translational modification of AMPK, and downstream changes in key glucose and fatty acid metabolic proteins mediated by AMPK, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC1), glycogen synthase (GS) and glucose transporters (GLUTs) 1 and 4. We found that in hypoxic naked mole-rats (1) metabolic rate decreased similar to 80\% and fuel use switched to carbohydrates, and that (2) levels of activated phosphorylated AMPK and GS, and GLUT4 expression were downregulated in skeletal muscle, while ACC1 was unchanged. To explore the regulatory mechanism underlying this hypometabolic state, we used RT-qPCR to examine 55 AMPK-associated microRNAs (miRNAs), which are short non-coding RNA post-transcriptional silencers. We identified changes in 10 miRNAs (three upregulated and seven downregulated) implicated in AMPK downregulation. Our results suggest that miRNAs and post-translational mechanisms coordinately reduce AMPK activity and downregulate metabolism in naked mole-rat skeletal muscle during severe hypoxia.

Estuarine bivalves such as blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) and Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) can survive periodic oxygen deficiency but the molecular mechanisms that underlie cellular injury during hypoxia-reoxygenation are not well understood. We examined the molecular markers of autophagy, apoptosis and inflammation during short-term (1 day) and long-term (6 days) hypoxia and post-hypoxic recovery (1 h) in mussels and oysters by measuring the lysosomal membrane stability, activity of a key autophagic enzyme (cathepsin D) and mRNA expression of the genes involved in the cellular survival and inflammation, including caspase 2, 3 and 8, Bcl-2, BAX, TGF-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), nuclear factor kappa B1 (NF-kappa B) and NF-kappa B activating kinases IKK alpha and TBK1.

Long-term hypoxia resulted in upregulation of Bcl-2 in the oysters and mussels, implying activation of anti-apoptotic mechanisms.

Endotherms are known to maintain high core body temperatures, but temperatures in the periphery of the body can fluctuate. Such a phenomenon occurs in bats, whose wing musculature is relatively poorly insulated, resulting in substantially depressed temperatures in the distal wing. We examined a wing muscle in the small-bodied tropical bat Carollia perspicillata and a hindlimb muscle in the laboratory mouse at 5 degrees C intervals from 22 to 42 degrees C to determine the thermal dependence of the contractile properties of both muscles. We found that the bat extensor carpi radial is longus had low thermal dependence from near body temperature to 10 degrees C lower, with Q(10) values of less than 1.5 for relaxation from contraction and shortening velocities in that interval, and with no significant difference in some rate properties in the interval between 32 and 37 degrees C. In contrast, for all temperature intervals below 37 degrees C, Q(10) values for the mouse extensor digitorum longus were 1.5 or higher, and rate properties differed significantly across successive temperature intervals from 37 to 22 degrees C. An ANCOVA analysis found that the thermal dependencies of all measured isometric and isotonic rate processes were significantly different between the bat and mouse muscles. The relatively low thermal dependence of the bat muscle likely represents a downward shift of its optimal temperature and may be functionally significant in light of the variable operating temperatures of bat wing muscles.",2018,10.1242/jeb.180166,221,14,NA,NA,Temperature effects; Muscle physiology; Flight; Phyllostomidae; Thermal ecology; Regional heterothermy

Although blood oxygen extraction by working muscle would increase the blood oxygen depletion rate in a swimming animal, there is little information on the relationship between muscle workload and blood oxygen depletion during dives. Therefore, we examined flipper stroke rate, a proxy of muscle workload, and posterior vena cava oxygen profiles in four adult female California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) during foraging trips at sea. Flipper stroke rate analysis revealed that sea lions minimized muscle metabolism with a stroke-glide strategy when diving, and exhibited prolonged glides during the descent of deeper dives (>100 m). During the descent phase of these deep dives, 55 +/- 21\% of descent was spent gliding, with the longest glides lasting over 160 s and covering a vertical distance of 340 m. Animals also consistently glided to the surface from 15 to 25 m depth during these deeper dives. Venous hemoglobin saturation (SO2) profiles were highly variable throughout dives, with values occasionally increasing during shallow dives. The relationship between SO2 and flipper stroke rate was weak during deeper dives, while this relationship was stronger during shallow dives. We conclude that (1) the depletion of oxygen in the posterior vena cava in deep-diving sea lions is not dependent on stroke effort, and (2) stroke-glide patterns during dives contribute to a reduction of muscle metabolic rate.",2017,10.1242/jeb.152314,220,8,1533-1540,NA,Diving physiology; Flipper stroke rate; Marine mammal; Venous oxygen

The purpose of this meta-analysis was to examine cardiovascular data from ectothermic and endothermic vertebrates, at rest and during exercise, with the goal of identifying key variables that may have contributed to the role of the cardiovascular system in supporting high rates of O-2 transport associated with endothermy. Vascular conductance, cardiac power and stroke work were summarized and calculated from a variety of studies at rest and during exercise for five classes of vertebrates where data were available. Conductance and cardiac power were linearly related to cardiac output from rest to exercise and also interspecifically. Exercise cardiac power and stroke work were greater in the endothermic species, owing to increased flow resulting from increased heart rate and increased pressure. Increased relative ventricle mass (RVM) was related to increased stroke volume in both groups. However, the increased RVM of endotherms was related to the increased pressure, as stroke work per gram of ventricle during exercise was equivalent between the groups. Cardiac power was linearly related to aerobic metabolic power, with 158 mW aerobic power output achieved per mW of cardiac power input. This analysis indicates that the greatly increased heart rate and cardiac stroke work leading to increased blood flow rate and blood pressure was necessary to support the metabolic requirements of endothermy.",2015,10.1242/jeb.118372,218,8,1143-1150,NA,Cardiac power; Stroke work; Vascular conductance; Vertebrate exercise; Exercise metabolism

Aortic cross-sectional area and ventricle blood velocity at the aortic valve were used to calculate SV, which together with f(H) provided estimates of left CO at rest and following exercise. f(H) and SV stabilized approximately 4-7 s following the post-respiratory tachycardia, so only data after the f(H) had stabilized were used for analysis and comparison.

Postprandial tachycardia, a well-documented phenomenon in these animals, is mediated by the withdrawal of vagal tone associated with the chronotropic effects of non-adrenergic and non-cholinergic (NANC) factors. However, herbivorous reptiles exhibit a modest metabolic increment during digestion and there is no information about postprandial cardiovascular adjustments. Considering the significant impact of feeding characteristics on physiological responses, we investigated cardiovascular and metabolic responses, as well as the neurohumoral mechanisms of cardiac control, in the herbivorous lizard Iguana iguana during digestion. We measured oxygen consumption rate ( \_VO2), heart rate (fH), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), myocardial activity, cardiac autonomic tone, fH/MAP variability and baroreflex efficiency in both fasting and digesting animals before and after parasympathetic blockade with atropine followed by double autonomic blockade with atropine and propranolol. Our results revealed that the peak of \_VO2 in iguanas was reached 24 h after feeding, accompanied by an increase in myocardial activity and a subtle tachycardia mediated exclusively by a reduction in cardiac parasympathetic activity. This represents the first reported case of postprandial tachycardia in digesting reptiles without the involvement of NANC factors. Furthermore, this withdrawal of vagal stimulation during digestion may reduce the regulatory range for shortterm fH adjustments, subsequently intensifying the blood pressure variability as a consequence of limiting baroreflex efficiency.",2024,10.1242/jeb.247105,227,3,NA,jeb247105,Postprandial tachycardia; Green iguana; NANC factors; Cardiovascular adjustments; Autonomic control; Baroreflex

D. and Finch, Geoffrey and Lee, Jr., Richard E. and Denlinger, David L. and Benoit, Joshua B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Rapid hardening is a process that quickly improves an animal's performance following exposure to potentially damaging stress. In this study of the Antarctic midge, Belgica antarctica (Diptera, Chironomidae), we examined how rapid hardening in response to dehydration (RDH) or cold (RCH) improves male pre- and post-copulatory function when the insects are subsequently subjected to a damaging cold exposure. Neither RDH nor RCH improved survival in response to lethal cold stress, but male activity and mating success following sublethal cold exposure were enhanced. Egg viability decreased following direct exposure of the mating males to sublethal cold but improved following RCH and RDH. Sublethal cold exposure reduced the expression of four accessory gland proteins, while expression remained high in males exposed to RCH. Though rapid hardening may be cryptic in males, this study shows that it can be revealed by pre- and post-copulatory interactions with females.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242506,224,14,NA,jeb242506,Pre-copulation; Competition; Post-copulation; Performance; Stress exposure
article,Experimental support towards a metabolic proxy in fish using otolith carbon isotopes,"Martino, Jasmin C. and Doubleday, Zoe A. and Chung, Ming-Tsung and Gillanders, Bronwyn M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Metabolic rate underpins our understanding of how species survive, reproduce and interact with their environment, but can be difficult to measure in wild fish. Stable carbon isotopes (delta C-13) in ear stones (otoliths) of fish may reflect lifetime metabolic signatures but experimental validation is required to advance our understanding of the relationship. To this end, we reared juvenile Australasian snapper (Chrysophrys auratus), an iconic fishery species, at different temperatures and used intermittent-flow respirometry to calculate standard metabolic rate (SMR), maximum metabolic rate (MMR) and absolute aerobic scope (AAS). Subsequently, we analysed delta C-13 and oxygen isotopes (delta O-18) in otoliths using isotope-ratio mass spectrometry. We found that under increasing temperatures, delta C-13 and delta O-18 significantly decreased, while SMR and MMR significantly increased. Negative logarithmic relationships were found between delta C-13 in otoliths and both SMR and MMR, while exponential decay curves were observed between proportions of metabolically sourced carbon in otoliths (Moto) and both measured and theoretical SMR. We show that basal energy for subsistence living and activity metabolism, both core components of field metabolic rates, contribute towards incorporation of delta C-13 into otoliths and support the use of delta C-13 as a metabolic proxy in field settings. The functional shapes of the logarithmic and exponential decay curves indicated that physiological thresholds regulate relationships between delta C-13 and metabolic rates due to upper thresholds of Moto. Here, we present quantitative experimental evidence to support the development of an otolithbased metabolic proxy, which could be a powerful tool in reconstructing lifetime biological trends in wild fish.",2020,10.1242/jeb.217091,223,6,NA,jeb217091,Chemical proxy; Otolith chemistry; Bioenergetics; Field metabolic rate; Teleost

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) released during periodic rewarming throughout hibernation, however, may induce oxidative damage in some tissues. Telomeres, which are the terminal sequences of linear chromosomes, may shorten in the presence of ROS, and thus the telomere length of an individual reflects the degree of accrued oxidative damage. This study quantified telomere length dynamics throughout hibernation in arctic ground squirrels (Urocitellus parryii). We hypothesized that telomere dynamics are tissue specific and predicted that telomere shortening would be most pronounced in brown adipose tissue (BAT), the organ that directly supports non-shivering thermogenesis during arousals. We used qPCR to determine relative telomere length (RTL) in DNA extracted from liver, heart, skeletal muscle (SM) and BAT of 45 juvenile and adult animals sampled either at mid-or late hibernation. Age did not have a significant effect on RTL in any tissue. At mid-hibernation, RTL of juvenile females was longer in BAT and SM than in liver and heart. In juvenile females, RTL in BAT and SM, but not in liver and heart, was shorter at late hibernation than at mid-hibernation. At late hibernation, juvenile males had longer RTL in BAT than did juvenile females, perhaps due to the naturally shorter hibernation duration of male arctic ground squirrels. Finally, BAT RTL at late hibernation negatively correlated with arousal frequency. Overall, our results suggest that, in a hibernating mammal, telomere shortening is tissue specific and that metabolically active tissues might incur higher levels of molecular damage.",2019,10.1242/jeb.204925,222,18,NA,jeb204925,Brown adipose tissue; Skeletal muscle; Oxidative damage; Biomarker; Reactive oxygen species; qPCR
article,What goes up must come down: biomechanical impact analysis of falling locusts,"Reicher, V, Simon and Labisch, Susanna and Dirks, Jan-Henning",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Many insects are able to precisely control their jumping movements. Once in the air, the properties of the actual landing site. however, are almost impossible to predict. Falling insects thus have to cope with the situation at impact. In particular, for insects jumping to escape predators, a controlled landing movement appears to be a major evolutionary advantage. A quick recovery into an upright and stable body posture minimizes the time to prepare for the next escape jump. In this study, we used high-speed recordings to investigate the falling and in particular the impact behavior of Schistocerca gregaria locusts, a common model organism for studies on the biomechanics of jumping. Detailed impact analyses of free-falling locusts show that most insects typically crashed onto the substrate. Although free-falling locusts tended to spread their legs. they mostly fell onto the head and thorax first. The presence of wings did not significantly reduce impact speed; however, it did affect the orientation of the body at impact and significantly reduced the time to recover. Our results also show that alive warm locusts fell significantly faster than inactive or dead locusts. This indicates a possible tradeoff between active control versus reduced speed. Interestingly, alive insects also tended to perform a characteristic bending movement of the body at impact. This biomechanical adaptation might reduce the rebound and shorten the time to recover. The adhesive pads also play an important role in reducing the time to recover by allowing the insect to anchor itself to the substrate.",2019,10.1242/jeb.202986,222,14,NA,jeb202986,Biomechanics; Jumping; Exoskeleton; Cuticle; Bending

However, for animals in light-restricted habitats (e.g. burrows or cavities), thermoperiod may be a more important cue. Our study tested this hypothesis in the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata, which nests in cavities and undergoes development within a brood cell. We assessed the role of environmental cues (thermoperiod and photoperiod) on the process of adult emergence by examining: (1) whether those cues direct circadian rhythms, (2) which cue is more dominant and (3) how sensitive developing bees and emergence-ready adults are to cues. Although we found that 20\% of light penetrates the brood cell, and bees respond to photoperiod by synchronizing emergence, thermoperiod is the dominant cue. When presented with a conflicting zeitgeber, bees entrained to the thermophase instead of the photophase. When temperature cues were removed, we observed free-running of emergence, indicating that underlying circadian mechanisms can be synchronized by daily fluctuations in temperature. We also found that emerging bees were highly sensitive to even small increases in temperature, entraining to a ramp speed of 0.33 degrees C h(-1). The response and sensitivity to temperature cues suggest that M. rotundata evolved a temperature-mediated clock to time emergence from light-restricted cavities.",2018,10.1242/jeb.175406,221,10,NA,jeb175406,Circadian rhythm; Adult emergence; Periodism; Insect

However, the extent of interspecies variation in the control processes that dictate hypoxia responses remains largely unknown.

We show that Andean geese and crested ducks have evolved fundamentally different mechanisms for maintaining oxygen supply during low oxygen (hypoxia) from those of bar-headed geese. Bar-headed geese respond to hypoxia with robust increases in ventilation and heart rate, whereas Andean species increase lung oxygen extraction and cardiac stroke volume. We propose that transient high-altitude performance has favoured the evolution of robust convective oxygen transport recruitment in hypoxia, whereas life-long high-altitude residency has favoured the evolution of structural enhancements to the lungs and heart that increase lung diffusion and stroke volume.",2017,10.1242/jeb.168799,220,22,4186-4194,NA,Altitude; Ventilation; Cardiac output; Metabolism; Goose; Duck

We compare muscle activity during tongue projection in salamanders with elastically powered, ballistic projection with activity of those with musclepowered, non-ballistic projection across a range of temperatures to understand how motor control is integrated with elastically powered movements, and how this integration contributes to reduced thermal sensitivity. Species with ballistic tongue projection activated and deactivated their projector muscles significantly earlier than nonballistic species, in a pattern consistent with a mechanism in which the muscle strains elastic tissue that subsequently recoils to power projection. Tongue projection was more thermally robust in ballistic species, but in both ballistic and non-ballistic species the projector muscles were activated earlier and for longer as temperature decreased. The retractor muscles showed a pattern similar to that of the projector muscles, but declined in a similar manner in the two groups. Muscle activity intensity also decreased at low temperatures in both groups, revealing that compensatory muscle activation does not account for the improved thermal robustness in ballistic species. Thus, relatively minor shifts in motor patterns accompanying morphological changes such as increased elastic tissue are sufficient to improve performance and decrease its thermal sensitivity without specialization of muscle contractile physiology.",2017,10.1242/jeb.145896,220,5,938-951,NA,Electromyography; Feeding; Temperature effects; Ballistic movement; Ectotherm

The aim of this study was to determine whether fasting-induced mitochondrial coupling flexibility depends upon the phenotype of skeletal muscles. The rates of oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial efficiency were measured in pectoralis (glycolytic) and gastrocnemius (oxidative) muscles from cold-acclimated ducklings (Cairina moschata). Pyruvate and palmitoyl-L-carnitine were used in the presence of malate as respiratory substrates. Plasma metabolites, skeletal muscle concentrations of triglycerides, glycogen and total protein and mitochondrial levels of oxidative phosphorylation complexes were also quantified. Results from ad libitum fed ducklings were compared with those from ducklings that were fasted for 4 days. During the 4 days of nutritional treatment, birds remained in the cold, at 4 degrees C. The 4 days of starvation preferentially affected the pectoralis muscles, inducing an up-regulation of mitochondrial efficiency, which was associated with a reduction of both total muscle and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation protein, and with an increase of intramuscular lipid concentration. By contrast, fasting decreased the activity of oxidative phosphorylation but did not alter the coupling efficiency and protein expression of mitochondria isolated from the gastrocnemius muscles. Hence, the adjustment of mitochondrial efficiency to fasting depends upon the muscle phenotype of cold-acclimated birds. Furthermore, these results suggest that the reduced cost of mitochondrial ATP production in pectoralis muscles may trigger lipid storage within this tissue and help to sustain an important metabolic homeostatic function of skeletal muscles, which is to maintain levels of amino acids in the circulation during the fast.",2015,10.1242/jeb.122671,218,15,2427-2434,NA,Mitochondria; Bioenergetics; Energy efficiency; Starvation; Birds; Oxidative metabolism

Observational studies and evolutionary history provide indirect evidence for the existence of a chemoreceptor population at the first major bifurcation of the common carotid artery in lizards, but a chemoreceptive role for this area has not yet been definitively demonstrated. We explored this possibility by measuring changes in cardiorespiratory variables in response to focal arterial injections of the hypoxia mimic sodium cyanide (NaCN) into the carotid artery of 12 unanesthetized specimens of Tupinambis merianae. These injections elicited increases in heart rate (f(H); 101 +/- 35\% increase) and respiratory rate (f(R); 620 +/- 119\% increase), but not mean arterial blood pressure (MAP). These responses were eliminated by vagal denervation. Similar responses were elicited by injections of the neurotransmitters acetylcholine (ACh) and serotonin (5-HT) but not norepinephrine. Heart rate and respiratory rate increases in response to NaCN could be blocked or reduced by antagonists to ACh (atropine) and/or 5-HT (methysergide). Finally, using immunohistochemistry, we demonstrate the presence of putative chemoreceptive cells immunopositive for the cholinergic cell marker vesicular ACh transporter (VAChT) and 5-HT on internal lattice-like structures at the carotid bifurcation. These results provide evidence in lizards for the existence of dispersed chemoreceptor cells at the first carotid bifurcation in the central cardiovascular area that have similar properties to known carotid body homologs, adding to the picture of chemoreceptor evolution in vertebrates.",2015,10.1242/jeb.111633,218,2,228-237,NA,Reptiles; Lizards; Tegu; Arterial chemoreceptors; Oxygen chemoreception; Carotid body; ACh; Serotonin
article,Reduction of blood oxygen levels enhances postprandial cardiac hypertrophy in Burmese python (<i>Python bivittatus</i>),"Slay, Christopher E. and Enok, Sanne and Hicks, James W. and Wang, Tobias",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Physiological cardiac hypertrophy is characterized by reversible enlargement of cardiomyocytes and changes in chamber architecture, which increase stroke volume and <(V)overdot>(O2, max) via augmented convective oxygen transport. Cardiac hypertrophy is known to occur in response to repeated elevations of O-2 demand and/or reduced O-2 supply in several species of vertebrate ectotherms, including postprandial Burmese pythons (Python bivittatus). Recent data suggest postprandial cardiac hypertrophy in P. bivittatus is a facultative rather than obligatory response to digestion, though the triggers of this response are unknown. Here, we hypothesized that an O-2 supply-demand mismatch stimulates postprandial cardiac enlargement in Burmese pythons. To test this hypothesis, we rendered animals anemic prior to feeding, essentially halving blood oxygen content during the postprandial period. Fed anemic animals had heart rates 126\% higher than those of fasted controls, which, coupled with a 71\% increase in mean arterial pressure, suggests fed anemic animals were experiencing significantly elevated cardiac work. We found significant cardiac hypertrophy in fed anemic animals, which exhibited ventricles 39\% larger than those of fasted controls and 28\% larger than in fed controls. These findings support our hypothesis that those animals with a greater magnitude of O-2 supply-demand mismatch exhibit the largest hearts. The `low O-2 signal' stimulating postprandial cardiac hypertrophy is likely mediated by elevated ventricular wall stress associated with postprandial hemodynamics.",2014,10.1242/jeb.092841,217,10,1784-1789,NA,Cardiac plasticity; Cardiovascular regulation; Python molurus bivittatus; Reptile; Heart; Digestion; Postprandial; SDA; Anemia

Rats exposed to cold (4 +/- 1 degrees C) for periods of 1, 3, 7, 12, 21 and 45 days were divided into three groups: untreated, L-arginine treated and N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) treated. Compared with controls (22 +/- 1 degrees C), there was an initial increase in the protein level of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase alpha (day 1), followed by an increase in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs): PPAR alpha and PPAR gamma from day 1 and PPAR delta from day 7 of cold acclimation. Activation of the PGC-1 alpha/PPAR transcription program was accompanied by increased protein expression of the key metabolic enzymes in beta-oxidation, the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, with the exceptions in complex I (no changes) and ATP synthase (decreased at day 1). Cold did not affect hexokinase and GAPDH protein levels, but increased lactate dehydrogenase activity compared with controls (1-45 days). L-arginine sustained, accelerated and/or intensified cold-induced molecular remodeling throughout cold acclimation. L-NAME exerted phase-dependent effects: similar to L-arginine in early cold acclimation and opposite after prolonged cold exposure (from day 21). It seems that upregulation of the PGC-1 alpha/PPAR transcription program early during cold acclimation triggers the molecular recruitment of skeletal muscle underlying the shift to more oxidative metabolism during prolonged cold acclimation.

article,Getting to the heart of anatomical diversity and phenotypic plasticity: fish hearts are an optimal organ model in need of greater mechanistic study,"Farrell, Anthony P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Natural selection has produced many vertebrate `solutions' for the cardiac life-support system, especially among the approximately 30,000 species of fishes. For example, across species, fish have the greatest range for central arterial blood pressure and relative ventricular mass of any vertebrate group. This enormous cardiac diversity is excellent ground material for mechanistic explorations. Added to this species diversity is the emerging field of populationspecific diversity, which is revealing that cardiac design and function can be tailored to a fish population's local environmental conditions. Such information is important to conservation biologists and ecologists, as well as physiologists. Furthermore, the cardiac structure and function of an individual adult fish are extremely pliable (through phenotypic plasticity), which is typically beneficial to the heart's function when environmental conditions are variable. Consequently, exploring factors that trigger cardiac remodelling with acclimation to new environments represents a marvellous opportunity for performing mechanistic studies that minimize the genetic differences that accompany cross-species comparisons. What makes the heart an especially good system for the investigation of phenotypic plasticity and species diversity is that its function can be readily evaluated at the organ level using established methodologies, unlike most other organ systems. Although the fish heart has many merits as an organ-level model to provide a mechanistic understanding of phenotypic plasticity and species diversity, bringing this potential to fruition will require productive research collaborations among physiologists, geneticists, developmental biologists and ecologists.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245582,226,16,NA,jeb245582,Cardiovascular; Environment; Heart; Phenotypic plasticity; Species diversity
article,Optimisation and constraint: explaining metabolic patterns in biology,"White, Craig R. and Marshall, Dustin J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Constraint-based explanations have dominated theories of size -related patterns in nature for centuries. Explanations for metabolic scaling - the way in which metabolism changes with body mass - have been based on the geometry of circulatory networks through which resources are distributed, the need to dissipate heat produced as a by-product of metabolic processes, and surface-area-to-volume constraints on the flux of nutrients or waste. As an alternative to these constraint-based approaches, we recently developed a new theory that predicts that metabolic allometry arises as a consequence of the optimisation of growth and reproduction to maximise fitness within a finite life. Our theory is free of physical geometric constraints that limit the possibilities available to evolution, and we therefore argue that metabolic allometry can be explained without the need to invoke any of the assumed constraints traditionally imposed by metabolic theories. Our findings also suggest that metabolism, growth and reproduction have co-evolved to maximise fitness (i.e. lifetime reproduction) and that the observed patterns in these fundamental characteristics of life can similarly be explained by optimisation rather than constraint. In this Centenary Commentary, we present an overview of our approach and a critique of its limitations. We propose a suite of empirical tests that we hope will move the field forward, discuss the dangers of model overparameterisation and highlight the need to remain open to non-adaptive hypotheses for the origin of biological patterns.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245426,226,11,NA,jeb245426,Evolutionary physiology; Growth; Metabolic rate; Metabolic theory; Optimisation; Scaling

We therefore hypothesized that the adaptive mechanism seen in H. ishmaeli in response to hypoxia constitutes a trait that the Lake Victoria species flock inherited from ancestors that lived in hypoxic environments. We tested this hypothesis by designing split-brood experiments with three other representative species from the same species flock: the insectivorous Haplochromis thereuterion, the mollusk-shelling Platytaeniodus degeni and the zooplanktivorous Haplochromis piceatus, while keeping H. ishmaeli as a reference. Split broods were raised, under either normoxia or hypoxia. All hypoxia-raised (HR) individuals of each of the four species exhibited a distinctly different isoHb pattern compared with their normoxiaraised (NR) siblings. The hemoglobin of HR H. thereuterion showed higher O-2 affinity compared with NR siblings particularly in the presence of ATP and GTP, indicating that blood of HR juveniles has significantly improved O-2-binding affinity under hypoxic conditions. We also tested the capacity to acclimate at greater age in two species by reversing the O-2 condition after 7 (H. thereuterion) and 4 (H. ishmaeli) months. After reacclimation for 1 and 2 months, respectively, we found incomplete reversal with intermediate isoHb patterns.

In oviparous animals whose embryos are exposed to the external environment, maternal provisioning of molecular factors like mRNAs and proteins may help embryos cope with sudden changes in the environment. Here, we sought to modify the maternal mRNA contribution to offspring embryos and test for maternal effects on acute thermal tolerance in early embryos of Drosophila melanogaster. We drove in vivo overexpression of a small heat shock protein gene (Hsp23) in female ovaries and measured the effects of acute thermal stress on offspring embryonic survival and larval development. We report that overexpression of the Hsp23 gene in female ovaries produced offspring embryos with increased thermal tolerance. We also found that brief heat stress in the early embryonic stage (0-1 h old) caused decreased larval performance later in life (5-10 days old), as indexed by pupation height. Maternal overexpression of Hsp23 protected embryos against this heat-induced defect in larval performance.

Movements powered by elastic recoil, however, are known to be more thermally robust than muscle-powered movements. We examined the whole-organism performance, motor control and muscle contractile physiology underlying feeding in the salamander Eurycea guttolineata. We compared elastically powered tongue projection with the associated muscle-powered retraction to determine the thermal robustness of each of these functional levels. We found that tongue-projection distance in E. guttolineata was unaffected by temperature across the entire 4-26 degrees C range, tongue-projection dynamics were significantly affected by temperature across only the 4-11 degrees C interval, and tongue retraction was affected to a higher degree across the entire temperature range. The significant effect of temperature on projection dynamics across the 4-11 degrees C interval corresponds to a significant decline in projector muscle burst intensity and peak contractile force of the projector muscle across the same interval. Across the remaining temperature range, however, projection dynamics were unaffected by temperature, with muscle contractile physiology showing typical thermal effects and motor patterns showing increased activity durations and latencies. These results reveal that elastically powered tongue-projection performance in E. guttolineata is maintained to a higher degree than muscle-powered tongue retraction performance across a wide temperature range. These results further indicate that thermal robustness of the elastically powered movement is dependent on motor control and muscle physiology that results in comparable energy being stored in elastic tissues across a range of temperatures.",2014,10.1242/jeb.105437,217,17,3146-3158,NA,Feeding; Tongue projection; Electromyography; Contractile properties; Temperature effects; Elastic
article,Sulfide metabolism and the mechanism of torpor,"Jensen, Birgitte S. and Fago, Angela",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Hibernation is a powerful response of a number of mammalian species to reduce energy during the cold winter season, when food is scarce. Mammalian hibernators survive winter by spending most of the time in a state of torpor, where basalmetabolic rate is strongly suppressed and body temperature comes closer to ambient temperature. These torpor bouts are regularly interrupted by short arousals, where metabolic rate and body temperature spontaneously return to normal levels. The mechanisms underlying these changes, and in particular the strong metabolic suppression of torpor, have long remained elusive. As summarized in this Commentary, increasing evidence points to a potential key role for hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the suppression of mitochondrial respiration during torpor. The idea that H2S could be involved in hibernation originated in some early studies, where exogenous H2S gas was found to induce a torpor-like state in mice, and despite some controversy, the idea persisted. H2S is a widespread signaling molecule capable of inhibiting mitochondrial respiration in vitro and studies found significant in vivo changes in endogenous H2S metabolites associated with hibernation or torpor. Along with increased expression of H2S-synthesizing enzymes during torpor, H2S degradation catalyzed by the mitochondrial sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQR) appears to have a key role in controlling H2S availability for inhibiting respiration. Specifically, in thirteen-lined squirrels, SQR is highly expressed and inhibited in torpor, possibly by acetylation, thereby limiting H2S oxidation and causing inhibition of respiration. H2S may also control other aspects associated with hibernation, such as synthesis of antioxidant enzymes and of SQR itself.",2021,10.1242/jeb.215764,224,17,NA,jeb215764,H2S; Hypometabolism; Mitochondria; Sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase; Hibernation

The circadian rhythm of body temperature is thought to be an important modulator of molecular clocks in peripheral tissues, but how daily temperature cycles affect physiological function is unclear. Here, we examined the effect of constant temperature (T-con, 25 degrees C) and cycling temperature (T-cyc, 28 degrees C:22 degrees C during light:dark) paradigms on lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster, and the expression of clock genes, heat shock protein 83 (Hsp83), Frost (Fst) and senescence marker protein-30 (smp-30). Male and female D. melanogaster housed at T-cyc had longer median lifespans than those housed at T-con. T-cyc induced robust Hsp83 rhythms and rescued the age-related decrease in smp-30 expression that was observed in flies at T-con, potentially indicating an increased capacity to cope with age-related cellular stress. Ageing under T-con led to a decrease in the amplitude of expression of all clock genes in the bodies of male flies, except for cyc, which was non-rhythmic, and for per and cry in female flies. Strikingly, housing under T-cyc conditions rescued the age-related decrease in amplitude of all clock genes, and generated rhythmicity in cyc expression, in the male flies, but not the female flies.

However, a few studies had difficulty in detecting SLN in FBV/N mice and questioned its relevance to muscle metabolism. It is known that genetic alteration of proteins in different inbred mice strains produces dissimilar functional outcomes. Therefore, here we compared the expression of SLN and key proteins involved in Ca2+ handling and mitochondrial metabolism between FVB/N and C57BU6J mouse strains. Data suggest that SLN expression is less abundant in the skeletal muscles of FVB/N mice than in the C57BL/6J strain. The expression of Ca2+ transporters in the mitochondrial membranes was also lower in FVB/N than in C57BL/6J mice. Similarly, electron transport chain proteins in the mitochondria were less abundant in FVB/N mice, which may contribute to differences in energy metabolism. Future studies using different mouse strains should take these differences into account when interpreting their data.",2021,10.1242/jeb.238634,224,2,NA,jeb238634,Skeletal muscle; Sarcolipin; Ca2+-handling proteins; Mitochondrial metabolism; Mouse strain

We compare multiple curve-fitting approaches to estimate P-crit of the Gulf killifish, Fundulus grandis, during closed and intermittent-flow respirometry. Fitting two line segments of (M) over dot(O2) versus P-O2 produced high and variable estimates of P-crit, as did nonlinear regression using a hyperbolic (Michaelis-Menten) function. Using nonlinear regression fit to an exponential (modified Weibull) function, or linear regression of (M) over dot(O2) versus P-O2 at low P-O2, and determining P-crit as the PO2 when (M) over dot(O2) equals standard metabolic rate (SMR) yielded values that were consistent across fish and among experimental trials.

article,Altitude matters: differences in cardiovascular and respiratory responses to hypoxia in bar-headed geese reared at high and low altitudes,"Lague, Sabine L. and Chua, Beverly and Farrell, Anthony P. and Wang, Yuxiang and Milsom, William K.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Bar-headed geese (Anser indicus) fly at high altitudes during their migration across the Himalayas and Tibetan plateau. However, we know relatively little about whether rearing at high altitude (i.e. phenotypic plasticity) facilitates this impressive feat because most of what is known about their physiology comes from studies performed at sea level. To provide this information, a comprehensive analysis of metabolic, cardiovascular and ventilatory responses to progressive decreases in the equivalent fractional composition of inspired oxygen (FIO2 : 0.21, 0.12, 0.09, 0.07 and 0.05) was made on bar-headed geese reared at either high altitude (3200 m) or low altitude (0 m) and on barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis), a low-altitude migrating species, reared at low altitude (0 m). Bar-headed geese reared at high altitude exhibited lower metabolic rates and a modestly increased hypoxic ventilatory response compared with low-altitude-reared bar-headed geese. Although the in vivo oxygen equilibrium curves and blood-oxygen carrying capacity did not differ between the two bar-headed goose study groups, the blood-oxygen carrying capacity was higher than that of barnacle geese. Resting cardiac output also did not differ between groups and increased at least twofold during progressive hypoxia, initially as a result of increases in stroke volume. However, cardiac output increased at a higher FIO2 threshold in bar-headed geese raised at high altitude. Thus, bar-headed geese reared at high altitude exhibited a reduced oxygen demand at rest and a modest but significant increase in oxygen uptake and delivery during progressive hypoxia compared with bar-headed geese reared at low altitude.",2016,10.1242/jeb.132431,219,13,1974-1984,NA,Anser indicus; Branta leucopsis; Barnacle goose; Ventilation; Cardiac output; Metabolic rate; Oxygen uptake; Stroke volume

Densitometry and visual inspection indicated that polyps bleached while stolons did not. When migration was triggered by temperature, light and confinement, colonies of Sarcothelia sp. decreased rates of oxygen formation in the light (due to the effects of perturbation on photosynthesis and respiration) and increased rates of oxygen uptake in the dark (due to the effects of perturbation on respiration alone). Colonies of P. parrini, by contrast, showed no significant changes in either aspect of oxygen metabolism. When migration was triggered by light and confinement, colonies of Sarcothelia sp. showed decreased rates of oxygen formation in the light and increased rates of oxygen uptake in the dark, while colonies of P. parrini maintained the former and increased the latter. During symbiont migration into their stolons, colonies of both species showed dramatic increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS), as visualized with a fluorescent probe, with stolons of Sarcothelia sp. exhibiting a nearly immediate increase of ROS. Differences in symbiont type may explain the greater sensitivity of colonies of Sarcothelia sp. Using fluorescent probes, direct measurements of migrating symbionts in the stolons of Sarcothelia sp. showed higher levels of reactive nitrogen species and lower levels of ROS than the surrounding host tissue. As measured by native fluorescence, levels of NAD(P) H in the stolons were unaffected by perturbation.

article,The resting frequency of echolocation signals changes with body temperature in the hipposiderid bat <i>Hipposideros armiger</i>,"Schoeppler, Diana and Denzinger, Annette and Schnitzler, Hans-Ulrich",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Doppler shift (DS) compensating bats adjust in flight the second harmonic of the constant-frequency component (CF2) of their echolocation signals so that the frequency of the Doppler-shifted echoes returning from ahead is kept constant with high precision (0.1-0.2\%) at the so-called reference frequency (f(rof)). This feedback adjustment is mediated by an audio-vocal control system that correlates with a maximal activation of the foveal resonance area in the cochlea. Stationary bats adjust the average CF2 with similar precision at the resting frequency (f(rost)), which is slightly below the f(ref). Over a range of time periods (from minutes up to years), variations of the coupled f(ref) and f(rest) have been observed, and were attributed to age, social influences and behavioural situations in rhinolophids and hipposiderids, and to body temperature effects and flight activity in Pteronotus pamellii. We assume that, for all DS-compensating bats, a change in body temperature has a strong effect on the activation state of the foveal resonance area in the cochlea, which leads to a concomitant change in emission frequency. We tested our hypothesis in a hipposiderid bat, Hipposideros armiger, and measured how the circadian variation of body temperature at activation phases affected f(rost). With a miniature temperature logger, we recorded the skin temperature on the back of the bats simultaneously with echolocation signals produced. During warm-up from torpor, strong temperature increases were accompanied by an increase in f(rest) of up to 1.44 kHz. We discuss the implications of our results for the organization and function of the audio-vocal control systems of all DS-compensating bats.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243569,225,3,NA,jeb243569,Audio-vocal feedback control; Auditory fovea; CF-FM echolocation signals; Doppler shift compensation; Flutter detection

Early life stages in coral reef fishes often exhibit extreme physiological and demographic characteristics that are linked to well-established respiratory and ionoregulatory processes. However, gill development and function in coral reef fishes is not well understood. Therefore, we investigated gill morphology, oxygen uptake and ionoregulatory systems throughout embryogenesis in two coral reef damselfishes, Acanthochromis polyacanthus and Amphiprion melanopus (Pomacentridae). In both species, we found key gill structures to develop rapidly early in the embryonic phase. Ionoregulatory cells appear on gill filaments 3-4 days postfertilization and increase in density, whilst disappearing or shrinking in cutaneous locations. Primary respiratory tissue (lamellae) appears 5-7 days post-fertilization, coinciding with a peak in oxygen uptake rates of the developing embryos. Oxygen uptake was unaffected by phenylhydrazine across all ages (pre-hatching), indicating that haemoglobin is not yet required for oxygen uptake. This suggests that gills have limited contribution to respiratory functions during embryonic development, at least until hatching. Rapid gill development in damselfishes, when compared with that in most previously investigated fishes, may reflect preparations for a highperformance, challenging lifestyle on tropical reefs, but may also make reef fishes more vulnerable to anthropogenic stressors.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242364,224,22,NA,jeb242364,Ionoregulatory hypothesis; Oxygen hypothesis; Gas exchange; Metabolic rate; Ionocytes; Ontogeny
article,Chilling induces unidirectional solute leak through the locust gut epithelia,"Brzezinski, Kaylen and MacMillan, Heath A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Chill-susceptible insects, like the migratory locust, often die when exposed to low temperatures from an accumulation of tissue damage that is unrelated to freezing (chilling injury). Chilling injury is often associated with a loss of ion balance across the gut epithelia. It has recently been suggested that this imbalance is at least partly caused by a cold-induced disruption of epithelial barrier function. Here, we aimed to test this hypothesis in the migratory locust (Locusta migratoria). First, chill tolerance was quantified by exposing locusts to -2 degrees C and recording chill coma recovery time and survival 24 h post-cold exposure. Longer exposure times significantly increased recovery time and caused injury and death. Ion-selective microelectrodes were also used to test for a loss of ion balance in the cold. We found a significant increase of haemolymph K+ and decrease of haemolymph Na+ concentration over time. Next, barrier failure along the gut was tested by monitoring the movement of an epithelial barrier marker (FITC-dextran) across the gut epithelia during exposure to -2 degrees C. We found a significant increase in haemolymph FITC-dextran concentration over time in the cold when assayed in the mucosal to serosal direction. However, when tested in the serosal to mucosal direction, we saw minimal marker movement across the gut epithelia. This suggests that while cold-induced barrier disruption is present, it is apparently unidirectional. It is important to note that these data reveal only the phenomenon itself. The location of this leak as well as the underlying mechanisms remain unclear and require further investigation.",2020,10.1242/jeb.215475,223,13,NA,jeb215475,Chill tolerance; Chilling injury; Paracellular leak; Dextran; Alimentary canal
article,Energetics of migratory bats during stopover: a test of the torpor-assisted migration hypothesis,"Baloun, Dylan E. and Guglielmo, Christopher G.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The torpor-assisted migration hypothesis posits that migration is facilitated in bats by the use of torpor during stopover roosting periods, and predicts that at stopover, bats regulate time in torpor facultatively so that daily energy expenditure is independent of ambient roosting temperature. Energy savings can thus be directed to migratory movement. However, direct measurements of total roosting energy expenditure in relation to ambient and body temperature are lacking. We captured migratory silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans; similar to 11 g) at Long Point, ON, Canada, in spring and autumn 2016. We used quantitative magnetic resonance analysis to measure body composition change and energy expenditure over a 12 h roosting period in a ventilated incubator at 10, 17 and 25 degrees C. We assessed the effects of season, body mass, sex and age on energy expenditure. We found that daily energy expenditure was independent of roosting temperature, and that this was achieved by flexible use of torpor. Variation in body mass at capture was driven mainly by differences in fat, and the amount of body fat was negatively related to torpor use, particularly in spring. Season, sex and age also affected torpor use and energy expenditure, notably with pregnant females being generally fatter and using less torpor than males in spring. We estimate that stopover contributes only 15-20\% to the total energy costs of migration in bats compared with 70\% or more in typical birds. This study provides support for the torpor-assisted migration hypothesis. and furthers our understanding of the energy budgets of migratory bats.",2019,10.1242/jeb.196691,222,6,NA,jeb196691,Chiroptera; Heterothermy; Energy budget; Thermoregulation
article,Movements of vastly different performance have similar underlying muscle physiology,"Olberding, Jeffrey P. and Scales, Jeffrey A. and Deban, Stephen M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Many animals use elastic recoil mechanisms to power extreme movements, achieving levels of performance that would not be possible using muscle power alone. Contractile performance of vertebrate muscle depends strongly on temperature, but the release of energy from elastic structures is far less thermally dependent, thus elastic recoil confers thermal robustness to whole-animal performance. Here we explore the role that muscle contractile properties play in the differences in performance and thermal robustness between elastic and non-elastic systems by examining muscle from two species of plethodontid salamanders that use elastically powered tongue projection to capture prey and one that uses non-elastic tongue projection. In species with elastic mechanisms, tongue projection is characterized by higher mechanical power output and thermal robustness compared with tongue projection of closely related genera with non-elastic mechanisms. In vitro and in situ muscle experiments reveal that species differ in their muscle contractile properties, but these patterns do not predict the performance differences between elastic and non-elastic tongue projection. Overall, salamander tongue muscles are similar to other vertebrate muscles in contractile performance and thermal sensitivity. We conclude that changes in the tongue-projection mechanism, specifically the elaboration of elastic structures, are responsible for high performance and thermal robustness in species with elastic tongue projection. This suggests that the evolution of high-performance and thermally robust elastic recoil mechanisms can occur via relatively simple changes to morphology, while muscle contractile properties remain relatively unchanged.",2018,10.1242/jeb.166900,221,2,NA,jeb166900,Elastic recoil; Salamander; Feeding

Differences in flight-related morphology and maximum lifting capacity have been well characterized for different hummingbird species across elevational gradients, but relevant within-species variation has not yet been identified in any bird species. Here we evaluate load-lifting capacity for Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus) populations at three different elevations in China, and correlate maximum lifted loads with relevant anatomical features including wing shape, wing size, and heart and lung masses. Sparrows were heavier and possessed more rounded and longer wings at higher elevations; relative heart and lung masses were also greater with altitude, although relative flight muscle mass remained constant. By contrast, maximum lifting capacity relative to body weight declined over the same elevational range, while the effective wing loading in flight (i.e. the ratio of body weight and maximum lifted weight to total wing area) remained constant, suggesting aerodynamic constraints on performance in parallel with enhanced heart and lung masses to offset hypoxic challenge. Mechanical limits to take-off performance may thus be exacerbated at higher elevations, which may in turn result in behavioral differences in escape responses among populations.",2016,10.1242/jeb.142216,219,22,3642-3648,NA,Altitude; Eurasian tree sparrow; Flight; Maximum performance; Wing loading
article,Inhibition of the oxidative stress response by heat stress in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>,"Crombie, Timothy A. and Tang, Lanlan and Choe, Keith P. and Julian, David",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"It has long been recognized that simultaneous exposure to heat stress and oxidative stress shows a synergistic interaction that reduces organismal fitness, but relatively little is known about the mechanisms underlying this interaction. We investigated the role of molecular stress responses in driving this synergistic interaction using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. To induce oxidative stress, we used the pro-oxidant compounds acrylamide, paraquat and juglone. As expected, we found that heat stress and oxidative stress interact synergistically to reduce survival. Compared with exposure to each stressor alone, during simultaneous sublethal exposure to heat stress and oxidative stress the normal induction of key oxidative-stress response (OxSR) genes was generally inhibited, whereas the induction of key heat-shock response (HSR) genes was not. Genetically activating the SKN-1-dependent OxSR increased a marker for protein aggregation and decreased whole-worm survival during heat stress alone, with the latter being independent of HSF-1. In contrast, compared with wild-type worms, inactivating the HSR by HSF-1 knockdown, which would be expected to decrease basal heat shock protein expression, increased survival during oxidative stress alone. Taken together, these data suggest that, in C. elegans, the HSR and OxSR cannot be simultaneously activated to the same extent that each can be activated during a single stressor exposure. We conclude that the observed synergistic reduction in survival during combined exposure to heat stress and oxidative stress is due, at least in part, to inhibition of the OxSR during activation of the HSR.",2016,10.1242/jeb.135327,219,14,2201-2211,NA,Multiple stressors; Synergistic interaction; SKN-1; HSF-1; Survival
article,Developmentally arrested <i>Austrofundulus limnaeus</i> embryos have changes in post-translational modifications of histone H3,"Toni, Lee S. and Padilla, Pamela A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Although vertebrate embryogenesis is typically a continuous and dynamic process, some embryos have evolved mechanisms to developmentally arrest. The embryos of Austrofundulus limnaeus, a killifish that resides in ephemeral ponds, routinely enter diapause II (DII), a reversible developmental arrest promoted by endogenous cues rather than environmental stress. DII, which starts at 24-26 days post-fertilization and can persist for months, is characterized by a significant decline in heart rate and an arrest of development and differentiation. Thus, A. limnaeus is a unique model to study epigenetic features associated with embryonic arrest. To investigate chromosome structures associated with mitosis or gene expression, we examined the post-translational modifications of histone H3 (phosphorylation of serine 10, mono-, di- and tri-methylation of lysine 4 or 27) in preDII, DII and postDII embryos. As seen by microscopy analysis, DII embryos have a significant decrease in the H3S10P marker for mitotic nuclei and an inner nuclear membrane localization of the H3K27me2 marker associated with silencing of gene expression. ELISA experiments reveal that the levels of methylation at H3K4 and H3K27 are significantly different between preDII, DII and postDII embryos, indicating that there are molecular differences between embryos of different chronological age and stage of development. Furthermore, in DII embryos relative to preDII embryos, there are differences in the level of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3, which may reflect critical chromatin remodeling that occurs prior to arrest of embryogenesis. This work helps lay a foundation for chromatin analysis of vertebrate embryo diapause, an intriguing yet greatly understudied phenomenon.",2016,10.1242/jeb.131862,219,4,544-552,NA,Diapause; Killifish; Chromatin
article,Body mass affects seasonal variation in sickness intensity in a seasonally breeding rodent,"Carlton, Elizabeth D. and Demas, Gregory E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Species that display seasonal variation in sickness intensity show the most intense response in the season during which they have the highest body mass, suggesting that sickness intensity may be limited by an animal's energy stores. Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) display lower body masses and less intense sickness when housed in short, winter-like days as opposed to long, summer-like days. To determine whether reduced sickness intensity displayed by short-day hamsters is a product of seasonal changes in body mass, we food restricted long-day hamsters so that they exhibited body mass loss that mimicked the natural photoperiod-induced loss of body mass in short-day hamsters. We then experimentally induced sickness with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and compared sickness responses among long-day food-restricted and long-and short-day ad libitum fed groups, predicting that long-day food-restricted hamsters would show sickness responses comparable to those of short-day ad libitum fed hamsters and attenuated in comparison to long-day ad libitum fed hamsters. We found that long-day food-restricted hamsters showed attenuated LPS-induced anorexia, loss of body mass and hypothermia compared with long-day ad libitum fed animals; however, anorexia remained elevated in long-day food-restricted animals compared with short-day ad libitum fed animals. Additionally, LPS-induced anhedonia and decreases in nest building were not influenced by body mass. Results of hormone assays suggest that cortisol levels could play a role in the attenuation of sickness in long-day food-restricted hamsters, indicating that future research should target the roles of glucocorticoids and natural variation in energy stores in seasonal sickness variation.",2015,10.1242/jeb.120576,218,11,1667-1676,NA,Acute phase response; Cortisol; Ecoimmunology; Lipopolysaccharide

The liver-derived hibernation protein (HP) complex, consisting of HP-20, HP-25 and HP-27, was shown to oscillate circannually, and this oscillation in the central nervous system (CNS) was suggested to play a role in hibernation. The HP complex has been found in hibernating chipmunks but not in related nonhibernating tree squirrels, leading to the suggestion that hibernation-specific genes may underlie the origin of hibernation. Here, we show that non-hibernating mammals express and regulate the conserved homologous HP complex in a seasonal manner, independent of hibernation. Comparative analyses of cow and chipmunk HPs revealed extensive biochemical and structural conservations. These include liver-specific expression, assembly of distinct heteromeric complexes that circulate in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and the striking seasonal oscillation of the HP levels in the blood and CNS. Central administration of recombinant HPs affected food intake in mice, without altering body temperature, physical activity levels or energy expenditure. Our results demonstrate that HP complex is not unique to the hibernators and suggest that the HP-regulated liver-brain circuit may couple seasonal changes in the environment to alterations in physiology.",2014,10.1242/jeb.095976,217,15,2667-2679,NA,CTRP; Hibernation; Metabolism; Plasma proteins; Cerebrospinal fluids

We identified five different populations of serotonergic NECs in this species (Types I-V) based on location, presence of synaptic vesicles (SV) that stain for the antibody SV2, innervation and labelling with the neural crest marker HNK-1. Cell Types I-III were innervated, and these cells, which participate in central O-2 chemoreflexes, were studied further. Although there was no change in the density of any cell type in bowfin after exposure to sustained hypoxia (6.0 kPa for 7 days) without access to air, all three of these cell types increased in size. In contrast, only Type II and III cells increased in size in bowfin exposed to sustained hypoxia with access to air.

Which components of the translation machinery control hypoxic sensitivity and the precise mechanism has not been systematically investigated, although a reduction in oxygen consumption has been widely assumed to be the mechanism. Using genetic reagents in Caenorhabditis elegans, we examined the effect on organismal survival after hypoxia of knockdown of 10 factors functioning at the three principal steps in translation. Reduction-of-function of all 10 translation factors significantly increased hypoxic survival to varying degrees, not fully accounted for by the level of translational suppression. Measurement of oxygen consumption showed that strong hypoxia resistance was possible without a significant decrease in oxygen consumption. Hypoxic sensitivity had no correlation with lifespan or reactive oxygen species sensitivity, two phenotypes associated with reduced translation. Resistance to tunicamycin, which produces misfolded protein toxicity, was the only phenotype that significantly correlated with hypoxic sensitivity. Translation factor knockdown was also hypoxia protective for mouse primary neurons. These data show that translation factor knockdown is hypoxia protective in both C. elegans and mouse neurons and that oxygen consumption does not necessarily determine survival; rather, mitigation of misfolded protein toxicity is more strongly associated with hypoxic protection.",2013,10.1242/jeb.082263,216,12,2283-2292,NA,hypoxia; ischemia; translation factors; C. elegans

The power of lab work has long been recognized by experimental biologists. For example, in 1932, Georgy Gause published an influential paper in Journal of Experimental Biology describing a series of clever lab experiments that provided the first empirical test of competitive exclusion theory, laying the foundation for a field that remains active today. At the time, Gause wrestled with the dilemma of conducting experiments in the lab or the field, ultimately deciding that progress could be best achieved by taking advantage of the high level of control offered by lab experiments. However, physiological experiments often yield different, and even contradictory, results when conducted in lab versus field settings. This is especially concerning in the Anthropocene, as standard laboratory techniques are increasingly relied upon to predict how wild animals will respond to environmental disturbances to inform decisions in conservation and management. In this Commentary, we discuss several hypothesized mechanisms that could explain disparities between experimental biology in the lab and in the field. We propose strategies for understanding why these differences occur and how we can use these results to improve our understanding of the physiology of wild animals. Nearly a century beyond Gause's work, we still know remarkably little about what makes captive animals different from wild ones.

Although they have proven effective in measuring the biology of complex and dynamic developing organisms, their utility in assessing environmental sensitivity of different species is untested. Using EPTs, we assess the relative thermal sensitivities of embryos of three species of freshwater snail with marked differences in their developmental event timings. Embryos of Lymnaea stagnalis, Radix balthica and Physella acuta were videoed hourly for the duration of their embryonic development at two temperatures: 20 \& DEG;C and 25 \& DEG;C. The video was used to calculate EPTs for the duration of their embryonic development, and during discrete physiological windows in development. Changes in energy spectra during development identified marked differences in thermal sensitivities between species, and suggest a relatively heightened sensitivity of gross rates of embryonic physiology and behaviour in embryos of R. balthica, developmental-window-specific thermal responses that reflect ontogenetic differences in observable physiologies, and temperature-induced changes in physiological event timing. EPTs enabled comparison of high-dimensional spectral phenotypes, providing a unique capability for assessing sensitivity continuously in developing individuals.

For instance, winter worker bees have higher vitellogenin levels and larger reserves of nutrients in the fat body than summer bees. The differences between the immune systems of both populations are well described at the constitutive level; however, our knowledge of its inducibility is still very limited. In this study, we focus on the response of 10-day-old honeybee workers to immune challenges triggered in vivo by injecting heat-killed bacteria, with particular focus on honeybees that emerge and live under hive conditions. Responses to bacterial injections differed between summer and winter bees. Winter bees exhibited a more intense response, including higher expression of antimicrobial genes and antimicrobial activity, as well as a significant decrease in vitellogenin gene expression and its concentration in the hemolymph.

A primary function is thought to be metabolic, mobilizing body reserves to match energetic demands. This view is supported by temperature-dependent GC levels, although reports of this effect show unexplained heterogeneity. We hypothesized that the temperature effect on GC concentrations will depend on food availability through its effect on the energy spent to gather the food needed for thermoregulation. We tested this hypothesis in zebra finches living in outdoor aviaries with manipulated foraging conditions (i.e. easy versus hard), by relating within-individual differences in baseline GCs between consecutive years to differences in ambient temperature. In agreement with our hypothesis, we found the GC-temperature association to be significantly steeper in the hard foraging environment. This supports the metabolic explanation of GC variation, underlining the importance of accounting for variation in energy expenditure when interpreting GC variation.",2018,10.1242/jeb.187880,221,23,NA,jeb187880,Corticosterone; Metabolic rate; Energy expenditure; Foraging environment; Glucose
article,Dynamics and thermal sensitivity of ballistic and non-ballistic feeding in salamanders,"Deban, Stephen M. and Scales, Jeffrey A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Low temperature reduces the performance of muscle-powered movements, but in movements powered by elastic recoil mechanisms, this effect can be mitigated and performance can be increased. To better understand the morphological basis of high performance and thermal robustness of elastically powered movements, we compared feeding dynamics at a range of temperatures (5-25 degrees C) in two species of terrestrial plethodontid salamanders, Plethodon metcalfi and Ensatina eschscholtzii, which differ in tongue muscle architecture and the mechanism of tongue projection. We found that Ensatina is capable of ballistic projection with a mean muscle mass-specific power of 2100 W kg(-1), revealing an elastic mechanism. Plethodon, in contrast, projected its tongue non-ballistically with a mean power of only 18 W kg(-1), indicating it is muscle powered. Ensatina projected its tongue significantly farther than Plethodon and with dynamics that had significantly lower thermal sensitivity at temperatures below 15 degrees C. These performance differences were correlated with morphological differences, namely elongated collagenous aponeuroses in the projector muscle of Ensatina as compared with Plethodon, which are likely the site of energy storage, and the absence in Ensatina of projector muscle fibers attaching to the tongue skeleton that allows projection to be truly ballistic. These findings demonstrate that, in these otherwise similar species, the presence in one species of elaborated connective tissue in series with myofibers confers not only 10-fold greater absolute performance but also greater thermal robustness of performance. We conclude that changes in muscle and connective tissue architecture are sufficient to alter significantly the mechanics, performance and thermal robustness of musculoskeletal systems.",2016,10.1242/jeb.127407,219,3,431-444,NA,Amphibian; Biomechanics; Temperature
article,Antifreeze proteins in the primary urine of larvae of the beetle <i>Dendroides canadensis</i>,"Nickell, Philip K. and Sass, Sandra and Verleye, Dawn and Blumenthal, Edward M. and Duman, John G.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"To avoid freezing while overwintering beneath the bark of fallen trees, Dendroides canadensis (Coleoptera: Pyrochroidae) larvae produce a family of antifreeze proteins (DAFPs) that are transcribed in specific tissues and have specific compartmental fates. DAFPs and associated thermal hysteresis activity (THA) have been shown previously in hemolymph and midgut fluid, but the presence of DAFPs has not been explored in primary urine, a potentially important site that can contain endogenous ice-nucleating compounds that could induce freezing. A maximum mean THA of 2.65 +/- 0.33 degrees C was observed in primary urine of winter-collected D. canadensis larvae. THA in primary urine increased significantly through autumn, peaked in the winter and decreased through spring to levels of 0.2-0.3 degrees C in summer, in a pattern similar to that of hemolymph and midgut fluid. THA was also found in hindgut fluid and excreted rectal fluid, suggesting that these larvae not only concentrate AFPs in the hindgut, but also excrete AFPs from the rectal cavity. Based on dafp transcripts isolated from Malpighian tubule epithelia, cDNAs were cloned and sequenced, identifying the presence of transcripts encoding 24 DAFP isoforms. Six of these Malpighian tubule DAFPs were known previously, but 18 are new. We also provide functional evidence that DAFPs can inhibit ice nucleators present in insect primary urine. This is potentially critical because D. canadensis larvae die if frozen, and therefore ice formation in any body fluid, including the urine, would be lethal.",2013,10.1242/jeb.082461,216,9,1695-1703,NA,antifreeze protein; insect cold tolerance; Malpighian tubule antifreeze; urine antifreeze; Dendroides canadensis
article,Activation of oxygen-responsive pathways is associated with altered protein metabolism in Arctic char exposed to hypoxia,"Cassidy, Alicia A. and Lamarre, Simon G.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Fish exposed to fluctuating oxygen concentrations often alter their metabolism and/or behaviour to survive. Hypoxia tolerance is typically associated with the ability to reduce energy demand by supressing metabolic processes such as protein synthesis. Arctic char is amongst the most sensitive salmonid to hypoxia, and typically engage in avoidance behaviour when faced with lack of oxygen. We hypothesized that a sensitive species will still have the ability (albeit reduced) to regulate molecular mechanisms during hypoxia. We investigated the tissue-specific response of protein metabolism during hypoxia. Little is known about protein degradation pathways during hypoxia in fish and we predict that protein degradation pathways are differentially regulated and play a role in the hypoxia response. We also studied the regulation of oxygen-responsive cellular signalling pathways {[}hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), unfolded protein response (UPR) and mTOR pathways] since most of what we know comes from studies on cancerous mammalian cell lines. Arctic char were exposed to cumulative graded hypoxia trials for 3 h at four air saturation levels (100\%, 50\%, 30\% and 15\%). The rate of protein synthesis was measured using a flooding dose technique, whereas protein degradation and signalling pathways were assessed by measuring transcripts and phosphorylation of target proteins. Protein synthesis decreased in all tissues measured (liver, muscle, gill, digestive system) except for the heart. Salmonid hearts have preferential access to oxygen through a well-developed coronary artery, therefore the heart is likely to be the last tissue to become hypoxic. Autophagy markers were upregulated in the liver, whereas protein degradation markers were downregulated in the heart during hypoxia. Further work is needed to determine the effects of a decrease in protein degradation on a hypoxic salmonid heart. Our study showed that protein metabolism in Arctic char is altered in a tissue-specific fashion during graded hypoxia, which is in accordance with the responses of the three major hypoxia-sensitive pathways (HIF, UPR and mTOR). The activation pattern of these pathways and the cellular processes that are under their control varies greatly among tissues, sometimes even going in the opposite direction. This study provides new insights on the effects of hypoxia on protein metabolism. Adjustment of these cellular processes is likely to contribute to shifting the fish phenotype into a more hypoxia-tolerant one, if more than one hypoxia event were to occur. Our results warrant studying these adjustments in fish exposed to long-term and diel cycling hypoxia.",2019,10.1242/jeb.203901,222,22,NA,jeb203901,Salmonid; Protein degradation; HIF; Unfolded protein response; mTOR; Salvelinus alpinus

A highly plastic species may survive and reproduce in more diverse environments, thereby supporting establishment and colonization. We focused on plasticity in the circadian rhythm of activity, which can favour species coexistence in invasion, for the invasive species Drosophila suzukii, which is expected to be a weaker direct competitor than other Drosophila species of the resident community. We compared the circadian rhythms of the locomotor activity in adults and the expression of clock genes in response to temperature in the invasive D. suzukii and the resident Drosophila melanogaster. We showed that D. suzukii is active in a narrower range of temperatures than D. melanogaster and that the activities of the two species overlap during the day, regardless of the temperature. Both species are diumal and exhibit rhythmic activity at dawn and dusk, with a much lower activity at dawn for D. suzukii females. Our results show that the timeless and clock genes are good candidates to explain the plastic response that is observed in relation to temperature. Overall, our results suggest that thermal phenotypic plasticity in D. suzukii activity is not sufficient to explain the invasive success of D. suzukii and call for testing other hypotheses, such as the release of competitors and/or predators.",2019,10.1242/jeb.199398,222,14,NA,jeb199398,Circadian rhythm; Clock genes; Drosophila melanogaster; Drosophila suzukii; Functional principal component analysis; Invasion biology
article,Assessment of fatigue-related biochemical alterations in a rat swimming model under hypoxia,"Shan, Fabo and Yang, Tao and Li, Junxia and Huang, Qing-Yuan",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"It is well known that exercise induced fatigue is exacerbated following hypoxia exposure and may arise from central and/or peripheral mechanisms. To assess the relative contribution of peripheral and central factors to exercise-induced fatigue under hypoxia, a rat model of fatigue by a bout of exhaustive swimming was established and fatigue-related biochemical changes in normoxic and severe hypoxic conditions were compared. Rats were randomly divided into four groups: normoxia resting (NR), exhaustive swimming (NE), hypoxia resting (HR) and exhaustive swimming (HE). The swimming time to exhaustion with a weight equal to 2.5\% of their body weight reduced under hypoxia. There were lower blood lactate levels, lower gastrocnemius pAMPK/AMPK ratios and higher gastrocnemius glycogen contents in the HE than in the NE groups, which all suggested a lower degree of peripheral fatigue in the HE group than in the NE group. Meanwhile, there was a significant increase in striatal 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) caused by exhaustive swimming under normoxia, whereas this increase was almost blunted under severe hypoxia, indicating that hypoxia might exacerbate exercise-induced central fatigue. These biochemical changes suggest that from normoxia to severe hypoxia, the relative contribution of peripheral and central factors to exercise-induced fatigue alters, and central fatigue may play a predominant role in the decline in exercise performance under hypoxia.",2019,10.1242/jeb.199711,222,14,NA,jep199711,High altitude; Peripheral fatigue; Central fatigue; Exercise
article,Eating increases oxidative damage in a reptile,"Butler, Michael W. and Lutz, Thomas J. and Fokidis, H. Bobby and Stahlschmidt, Zachary R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"While eating has substantial benefits in terms of both nutrient and energy acquisition, there are physiological costs associated with digesting and metabolizing a meal. Frequently, these costs have been documented in the context of energy expenditure while other physiological costs have been relatively unexplored. Here, we tested whether the seemingly innocuous act of eating affects either systemic pro-oxidant (reactive oxygen metabolite, ROM) levels or antioxidant capacity of corn snakes (Pantherophis guttatus) by collecting plasma during absorptive (peak increase in metabolic rate due to digestion of a meal) and non-absorptive (baseline) states. When individuals were digesting a meal, there was a minimal increase in antioxidant capacity relative to baseline (4\%), but a substantial increase in ROMs (nearly 155\%), even when controlling for circulating nutrient levels. We report an oxidative cost of eating that is much greater than that due to long distance flight or mounting an immune response in other taxa. This result demonstrates the importance of investigating non-energetic costs associated with meal processing, and it begs future work to identify the mechanism(s) driving this increase in ROM levels. Because energetic costs associated with eating are taxonomically widespread, identifying the taxonomic breadth of eating-induced ROM increases may provide insights into the interplay between oxidative damage and life history theory.",2016,10.1242/jeb.138875,219,13,1969-1973,NA,Digestion; Food intake; Hydroperoxides; Prandial state; Reactive oxygen metabolites; Specific dynamic action
article,Complex response in size-related traits of bulb mites (<i>Rhizoglyphus robini</i>) under elevated thermal conditions - an experimental evolution approach,"Plesnar-Bielak, Agata and Jawor, Anna and Kramarz, Paulina E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Temperature is a key environmental factor affecting almost all aspects of life history in ectotherms. Theory predicts that they grow faster, reach smaller sizes and produce smaller offspring when temperature increases. In addition, temperature changes, through their effects on metabolism, may also influence the expression of alternative reproductive phenotypes (ARPs) in ectotherms. Although many studies have investigated the phenotypic plasticity of life history traits in relation to temperature change, little is known about how those traits and phenotypic plasticity may evolve together. In our study we subjected bulb mites (non-model, soil organisms that normally experience rather stable thermal conditions) to experimental evolution in two temperature treatments: control (24 degrees C) and elevated (28 degrees C). After 18 generations, we measured adult body size, egg size and development time of both treatments at control as well as at elevated temperatures (test temperatures). Thus, we were able to detect genetic changes (the effects of selection temperature) and environmental effects (the effects of test temperature). We also observed the ARP expression throughout the experimental evolution. Our results revealed quite complex patterns of life history in traits response to temperature. Mites developed faster and reached smaller sizes at increased temperature, but evolutionary responses to increased temperature were not always parallel to the observed phenotypic plasticity. Additionally, despite smaller body sizes, females laid larger eggs at higher temperature. This effect was more pronounced in animals evolving at elevated temperature. Evolution at increased temperature also affected ARP expression, with the proportion of armored fighters decreasing from generation to generation. We propose that this could be the consequence of temperature sensitivity of the cost-to-benefits ratio of expressing ARPs.",2013,10.1242/jeb.090951,216,24,4542-4548,NA,thermal plasticity; thermal evolution; experimental evolution; alternative reproductive phenotypes; egg size; development time
article,The acute effects of higher versus lower load duration and intensity on morphological and mechanical properties of the healthy Achilles tendon: a randomized crossover trial,"Merza, Eman Y. and Pearson, Stephen J. and Lichtwark, Glen A. and Malliaras, Peter",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The Achilles tendon (AT) exhibits volume changes related to fluid flow under acute load which may be linked to changes in stiffness. Fluid flow provides a mechanical signal for cellular activity and may be one mechanism that facilitates tendon adaptation. This study aimed to investigate whether isometric intervention involving a high level of load duration and intensity could maximize the immediate reduction in AT volume and stiffness compared with interventions involving a lower level of load duration and intensity. Sixteen healthy participants (12 males, 4 females; age 24.4 +/- 9.4 years, body mass 70.9 +/- 16.1 kg, height 1.7 +/- 0.1 m) performed three isometric interventions of varying levels of load duration (2 s and 8 s) and intensity (35\% and 75\% maximal voluntary isometric contraction) over a 3 week period. Freehand 3D ultrasound was used to measure free AT volume (at rest) and length (at 35\%, 55\% and 75\% of maximum plantarflexion force) pre- and post-interventions. The slope of the force-elongation curve over these force levels represented individual stiffness (N mm(-1)). Large reductions in free AT volume and stiffness resulted in response to long-duration high-intensity loading whilst less reduction was produced with a lower load intensity. In contrast, no change in free AT volume and a small increase in AT stiffness occurred with lower load duration. These findings suggest that the applied load on the AT must be heavy and sustained for a long duration to maximize immediate volume reduction, which might be an acute response that enables optimal long-term tendon adaptation via mechanotransduction pathways.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243741,225,10,NA,jeb243741,Achilles tendon; Volume; Stiffness; Free tendon; 3D ultrasound
article,Septate junction in the distal ileac plexus of larval lepidopteran <i>Trichoplusia ni</i>: alterations in paracellular permeability during ion transport reversal,"Kolosov, Dennis and Jonusaite, Sima and Donini, Andrew and Kelly, Scott P. and O'Donnell, Michael J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The Malpighian tubules (MTs) and hindgut together act as the functional kidney in insects. MTs of caterpillars are notably complex and consist of several regions that display prominent differences in ion transport. The distal ileac plexus (DIP) is a region of MT that is of particular interest because it switches from ion secretion to ion reabsorption in larvae fed on ion-rich diets. The pathways of solute transport in the DIP are not well understood, but one potential route is the paracellular pathway between epithelial cells. This pathway is regulated by the septate junctions (SJs) in invertebrates, and in this study, we found regional and cellular heterogeneity in the expression of several integral SJ proteins. DIP of larvae fed ion-rich diets demonstrated a reduction in paracellular permeability, coupled with alterations in both SJ morphology and the abundance of its molecular components. Similarly, treatment in vitro with helicokinin (HK), an antidiuretic hormone identified by previous studies, altered mRNA abundance of many SJ proteins and reduced paracellular permeability. HK was also shown to target a secondary cell-specific SJ protein, Tsp2A. Taken together, our data suggest that dietary ion loading, known to cause ion transport reversal in the DIP of larval Trichoplusia ni, leads to alterations in paracellular permeability, SJ morphology and the abundance of its molecular components. The results suggest that HK is an important endocrine factor that coregulates ion transport, water transport and paracellular permeability in MTs of larval lepidopterans. We propose that co-regulation of all three components of the MT function in larval lepidopterans allows for safe toggling between ion secretion and reabsorption in the DIP in response to variations in dietary ion availability.",2019,10.1242/jeb.204750,222,11,NA,jeb204750,Malpighian tubules; Kinin; Ion secretion; Ion reabsorption; Crop pest physiology; Dietary ion loading
article,"Integration of swimming kinematics and ram suspension feeding in a model American paddlefish, <i>Polyodon spathula</i>","Haines, Grant E. and Sanderson, S. Laurie",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Ram suspension-feeding fishes swim with an open mouth to force water through the oral cavity and extract prey items that are too small to be pursued individually. Recent research has indicated that, rather than using a dead-end mechanical sieve, American paddlefish (Polyodon spathula) employ vortical cross-step filtration. In this filtration mechanism, vortical flow that is generated posterior to the branchial arches organizes crossflow filtration processes into a spatial structure across the gill rakers. Despite the known impact of locomotor kinematics on fluid flow around the bodies of swimming fish, the effects of locomotor kinematics on filtration mechanisms in ram suspension feeders are unknown. Potential temporal organization of filtration mechanisms in ram suspension-feeding fish has not been studied previously. We investigated the effects of locomotor kinematics associated with undulatory swimming on intra-oral flow patterns and food particle transport. A mechanized model of the oral cavity was used to simulate the swimming kinematics of suspension-feeding paddlefish. We recorded fluctuations of flow speed and pressure within the model, which occurred at a frequency that corresponded with the frequency of the model's strides. Using the mechanized model in a flow tank seeded with Artemia cysts, we also showed that swimming kinematics aided the transport of this simulated food to the posterior margins of the gill slots, although the time scale of this transport is expected to vary with prey parameters such as size and concentration. Dye stream experiments revealed that, although stable vortical flow formed because of flow separation downstream of backward-facing steps in control trials, vortical flow structures in mechanized trials repeatedly formed and shed. These findings suggest strong integration between locomotor and feeding systems in ram suspension-feeding fishes.",2017,10.1242/jeb.166835,220,23,4535-4547,NA,Crossflow filtration; Backward-facing steps; Filter-feeding fish; Gill rakers; Branchial arches; Yaw
article,Structural plasticity of the avian pectoralis: a case for geometry and the forgotten organelle,"Jimenez, Ana Gabriela",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The avian pectoralis muscle demonstrates incredible plasticity. This muscle is the sole thermogenic organ of small passerine birds, and many temperate small passerines increase pectoralis mass in winter, potentially to increase heat production. Similarly, this organ can double in size prior to migration in migratory birds. In this Commentary, following the August Krogh principle, I argue that the avian pectoralis is the perfect tissue to reveal general features of muscle physiology. For example, in both mammals and birds, skeletal muscle fiber diameter is generally accepted to be within 10-100 mu m. This size constraint is assumed to include reaction-diffusion limitations, coupled with metabolic cost savings associated with fiber geometry. However, avian muscle fiber structure has been largely ignored in this field, and the extensive remodeling of the avian pectoralis provides a system with which to investigate this. In addition, fiber diameter has been linked to whole-animal metabolic rates, although this has only been addressed in a handful of bird studies, some of which demonstrate previously unreported levels of plasticity and flexibility. Similarly, myonuclei, which are responsible for protein turnover within the fiber, have been forgotten in the avian literature. The few studies that have addressed myonuclear domain (MND) changes in avian muscle have found rates of change not previously seen in mammals. Both fiber diameter and MND have strong implications for aging rates; most aging mammals demonstrate muscular atrophy (a decrease in fiber diameter) and changes in MND. As I discuss here, these features are likely to differ in birds.",2020,10.1242/jeb.234120,223,23,NA,jeb234120,Muscle fiber diameter; Muscle ultrastructure; Myonuclear domain
article,Exposure to fluctuating temperatures leads to reduced immunity and to stress response in rattlesnakes,"Fabricio-Neto, Ailton and Madelaire, Carla B. and Gomes, Fernando R. and Andrade, V, Denis",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Ectothermic organisms often experience considerable variation in their body temperature throughout the circadian cycle. However, studies focusing on the measurement of physiological traits are usually performed under constant temperature regimes. This mismatch between thermal exposure in the field and experimental conditions could act as a stressor agent, as physiological functions are strongly influenced by temperature. Herein, we asked the question whether constant thermal regimes would cause a stress response and impact the immunity of the South American rattlesnake (Crotalus durissus) when compared with a fluctuating thermal regime. We addressed this question by determining heterophil:lymphocyte (H:L) ratio, plasma bacteria-killing ability (BKA) and corticosterone (CORT) levels in snakes kept under a constant temperature regime at 30 degrees C, and under a fluctuating regime that oscillated between 25 degrees C at night and 35 degrees C during the day. The experiments had a mirrored design, in which half of the snakes were subjected to a fluctuating-to-constant treatment, while the other half was exposed to a constant-to-fluctuating treatment. The shift from constant to fluctuating thermal regime was accompanied by an increase in plasma CORT levels, indicating the activation of a stress response. Exposure to a fluctuating thermal regime at the onset of the experiments induced a decrease in the BKA of rattlesnakes. H:L ratio was not affected by treatments and, therefore, the shift between thermal regimes seems to have acted as a low-intensity stressor. Our results suggest that removal from temperatures close to the snake's preferred body temperature triggers a stress response in rattlesnakes.",2019,10.1242/jeb.208645,222,22,NA,jeb208645,Thermal regime; Ectothermic; Snakes; Corticosterone; Innate immunity; Heterophil:lymphocyte ratio

HSP32, 60, 70 and 90 were detected, before and at 6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 h following exposure in lymphocytes. In the second part of our investigation, another 10 swine were randomly assigned into two groups (five per group). All swine were subjected to two simulated air dives in a hyperbaric chamber with an interval of 7 days. Eighteen hours before each dive, the swine were pretreated with HBO or air: the first group received air pretreatment prior to the first dive and HBO pretreatment prior to the second; the second group were pretreated with HBO first and then air. Bubble loads, skin lesions, inflammation and endothelial markers were detected after each dive. In lymphocytes, all HSPs increased significantly (P<0.05), with the greatest expression appearing at 18 h for HSP32 and 70. HBO pretreatment significantly reduced all the determined changes compared with air pretreatment.

In the present study, we attempted to determine whether regulation of hemoglobin (Hb) gene expression plays a role in the physiological response to chronic moderate hypoxia in whole larvae and hematopoietic tissues (head kidney and spleen) of juveniles. We also tested the hypothesis that hypoxia exposure at the larval stage could induce a long-term effect on the regulation of Hb gene expression. For this purpose, D. labrax were exposed to a non-lethal hypoxic condition (40\% air saturation) at the larval stage from 28 to 50 days post-hatching (dph) and/or at the juvenile stage from 196 to 296 dph. Data obtained from larvae indicate that hypoxia induced a subtype-specific regulation of Hb gene expression, with a significant decrease of MN-Hba3, MN-Hb beta 4 and MN-Hb beta 5 and increase of MN-Hb alpha 2, LA-Hb alpha 1 and LA-Hb beta 1 transcript levels. Hypoxia did not induce regulation of Hb gene expression in juveniles, except in the head kidney for those that experienced hypoxia at the larval stage. The latter exhibited a significant hypoxia-induced stimulation of MN-Hba2, LA-Hba1 and LA-Hb beta 1 gene expression, associated with stimulation of the PHD-3 gene involved in the hypoxia-inducible factor oxygen-sensing pathway.

In the classical view, muscle lactate must be exported to the liver for clearance. However, lactate also forms under well-oxygenated conditions, and this has led investigators to postulate lactate shuttling from non-oxidative to oxidative muscle fiber, where it can serve as a precursor. Indeed, the intracellular lactate shuttle and the glycogen shunt hypotheses expand the vision to include a dynamic mobilization and utilization of lactate during a muscle contraction cycle. Testing the tenability of these provocative ideas during a rapid contraction cycle has posed a technical challenge. The present study reports the use of hyperpolarized {[}1-C-13] lactate and {[}2-C-13] pyruvate in dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) NMR experiments to measure the rapid pyruvate and lactate kinetics in rat muscle. With a 3 s temporal resolution, C-13 DNP NMR detects both {[}1-C-13] lactate and [}2-C-13] pyruvate kinetics in muscle. Infusion of dichloroacetate stimulates pyruvate dehydrogenase activity and shifts the kinetics toward oxidative metabolism. Bicarbonate formation from {[}1-C-13] lactate increases sharply and acetyl-L-carnitine, acetoacetate and glutamate levels also rise. Such a quick mobilization of pyruvate and lactate toward oxidative metabolism supports the postulated role of lactate in the glycogen shunt and the intracellular lactate shuttle models. The study thus introduces an innovative DNP approach to measure metabolite transients, which will help delineate the cellular and physiological role of lactate and glycolytic end products.",2015,10.1242/jeb.123141,218,20,3308-3318,NA,Muscle metabolism; Lactate bioenergetics; Hyperpolarized C-13; Pyruvate

In this experiment, 15 adult male rats were divided into three equal-sized groups: exercise contingent (CON), non-exercise contingent (NON) and sedentary (SED). The CON group was placed in a cage with a running wheel, where the acquisition of food was contingent upon the distance required to run. Every 3 days the distance required to run to maintain food intake at free feeding levels was increased by 90\% in comparison to the previous 3 days. The NON group was housed identically to the CON group, but food acquisition was not dependent upon running in the wheel. Finally, the SED group was kept in small cages with no opportunity to perform exercise. A two-way ANOVA with repeated measures was used to determine significant differences in responses between the experimental phases and treatment groups, and ANCOVA was used to analyse growth and tissue mass variables with body length and body mass used separately as covariates. A post hoc Tukey's test was used to indicate significant differences. A Pearson's correlation was used to test the relationship between the distance travelled by the animal and the distance/food ratio. The level of significance was set at P<0.05 for all tests. The CON group showed the hypothesized correlation between distance required to run to obtain food and the mean distance travelled (P<0.001), during 45 days in the contingency phase. This group showed a decrease in body mass, rather than an increase as shown by NON and SED groups.

article,Effects of hypoxia-cadmium interactions on rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) mitochondrial bioenergetics: attenuation of hypoxia-induced proton leak by low doses of cadmium,"Onukwufor, John O. and MacDonald, Nicole and Kibenge, Fred and Stevens, Don and Kamunde, Collins",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The goal of the present study was to elucidate the modulatory effects of cadmium (Cd) on hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in light of the limited understanding of the mechanisms of multiple stressor interactions in aquatic organisms. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) liver mitochondria were isolated and energized with complex I substrates (malate-glutamate), and exposed to hypoxia (0>P-O2<2 Torr) for 0-60 min followed by reoxygenation and measurement of coupled and uncoupled respiration and complex I enzyme activity. Thereafter, 5 min hypoxia was used to probe interactions with Cd (0-20 mu mol l(-1)) and to test the hypothesis that deleterious effects of hypoxia/reoxygenation on mitochondria were mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Hypoxia/reoxygenation inhibited state 3 and uncoupler-stimulated (state 3u) respiration while concomitantly stimulating states 4 and 4(ol) (proton leak) respiration, thus reducing phosphorylation and coupling efficiencies. Low doses of Cd (<= 5 mu mol l(-1)) reduced, while higher doses enhanced, hypoxia-stimulated proton leak. This was in contrast to the monotonic enhancement by Cd of hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced reductions of state 3 respiration, phosphorylation efficiency and coupling. Mitochondrial complex I activity was inhibited by hypoxia/reoxygenation, hence confirming the impairment of at least one component of the electron transport chain (ETC) in rainbow trout mitochondria. Similar to the effect on state 4 and proton leak, low doses of Cd partially reversed the hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced complex I activity inhibition. The ROS scavenger and sulfhydryl group donor N-acetylcysteine, administrated immediately prior to hypoxia exposure, reduced hypoxia/reoxygenation-stimulated proton leak without rescuing the inhibited state 3 respiration, suggesting that hypoxia/reoxygenation influences distinct aspects of mitochondria via different mechanisms. Our results indicate that hypoxia/reoxygenation impairs the ETC and sensitizes mitochondria to Cd via mechanisms that involve, at least in part, ROS. Moreover, we provide, for the first time in fish, evidence for a hormetic effect of Cd on mitochondrial bioenergetics - the attenuation of hypoxia/reoxygenation-stimulated proton leak and partial rescue of complex I inhibition by low Cd doses.",2014,10.1242/jeb.093344,217,6,831-840,NA,Hypoxia; Reoxygenation; Cadmium; Interactions; Mitochondrial bioenergetics; Reactive oxygen species (ROS); Proton leak; Fish

The 3D images were analyzed by volume rendering and segmentation, enabling the analysis of the body, tracheal system and gastrointestinal tract through the time course of volume changes.

article,Limits to sustained energy intake. XXX. Constraint or restraint? Manipulations of food supply show peak food intake in lactation is constrained,"Zhao, Zhi-Jun and Derous, Davina and Gerrard, Abby and Wen, Jing and Liu, Xue and Tan, Song and Hambly, Catherine and Speakman, John R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Lactating mice increase food intake 4- to 5-fold, reaching an asymptote in late lactation. A key question is whether this asymptote reflects a physiological constraint, or a maternal investment strategy (a `restraint'). We exposed lactating mice to periods of food restriction, hypothesizing that if the limit reflected restraint, they would compensate by breaching the asymptote when refeeding. In contrast, if it was a constraint, they would by definition be unable to increase their intake on refeeding days. Using isotope methods, we found that during food restriction, the females shut down milk production, impacting offspring growth. During refeeding, food intake and milk production rose again, but not significantly above unrestricted controls. These data provide strong evidence that asymptotic intake in lactation reflects a physiological/physical constraint, rather than restraint. Because hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (Npy) was upregulated under both states of restriction, this suggests the constraint is not imposed by limits in the capacity to upregulate hunger signalling (the saturated neural capacity hypothesis). Understanding the genetic basis of the constraint will be a key future goal and will provide us additional information on the nature of the constraining factors on reproductive output, and their potential links to life history strategies.",2020,10.1242/jeb.208314,223,8,NA,jeb208314,Food restriction; Daily energy intake (DEI); Heat dissipation limit (HDL) theory; Milk energy output (MEO); Gene expression profile; Hunger signalling; Peripheral limitation; Swiss mice; Neuropeptide Y; RNAseq
article,The dive performance of immature king penguins following their annual molt suggests physiological constraints,"Enstipp, Manfred R. and Bost, Charles Andre and Le Bohec, Celine and Bost, Caroline and Laesser, Robin and Le Maho, Yvon and Weimerskirch, Henri and Handrich, Yves",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Like all birds, penguins undergo periodic molt, during which they replace old feathers. However, unlike other birds, penguins replace their entire plumage within a short period while fasting ashore. During molt, king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) lose half of their initial body mass, most importantly their insulating subcutaneous fat and half of their pectoral muscle mass. The latter might challenge their capacity to generate and sustain a sufficient mechanical power output to swim to distant food sources and propel themselves to great depth for successful prey capture. To investigate the effects of the annual molt fast on their dive/foraging performance, we studied various dive/foraging parameters and peripheral temperature patterns in immature king penguins across two molt cycles, after birds had spent their first and second year at sea, using implanted data-loggers. We found that the dive/foraging performance of immature king penguins was significantly reduced during post-molt foraging trips. Dive and bottom duration for a given depth were shorter during post-molt and post-dive surface interval duration was longer, reducing overall dive efficiency and underwater foraging time. We attribute this decline to the severe physiological changes that birds undergo during their annual molt. Peripheral temperature patterns differed greatly between pre- and post-molt trips, indicating the loss of the insulating subcutaneous fat layer during molt. Peripheral perfusion, as inferred from peripheral temperature, was restricted to short periods at night during pre-molt but occurred throughout extended periods during post-molt, reflecting the need to rapidly deposit an insulating fat layer during the latter period.",2019,10.1242/jeb.208900,222,20,NA,jeb208900,Dive/foraging performance; Aptenodytes patagonicus; Body insulation; Thermoregulation; Peripheral temperature; Subcutaneous fat; Wiggles; Seabirds

However, there is little understanding of the underlying mechanisms that drive variation in self-righting performance. To evaluate the mechanical factors that contribute to success versus failure when animals attempt to self-right, we compared force production and kinematic behavior in the rigid-bodied, pleurodire turtle Emydura subglobosa between successful and unsuccessful self-righting efforts. We found that the moment exerted during efforts to roll the body and the velocity of that roll are the primary drivers behind self-righting success. Specifically, turtles that self-righted successfully produced both larger moments and faster rolls than turtles that failed. In contrast, the angle at which the head was directed to lever the body and the extent of yaw that was incorporated in addition to roll had little impact on the likelihood of success. These results show that specific performance metrics can predict the ability of animals to self-right, providing a framework for biomimetic applications as well as future comparisons to test for differences in self-righting performance across animals from different environments, sexes, populations and species.",2018,10.1242/jeb.182642,221,14,NA,NA,Fitness; Performance; Biomechanics; Force
article,Skeletal muscle fuel selection occurs at the mitochondrial level,"Kuzmiak-Glancy, Sarah and Willis, Wayne T.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Mammals exponentially increase the rate of carbohydrate oxidation as exercise intensity rises, while birds combust lipid almost exclusively while flying at high percentages of aerobic capacity. The fuel oxidized by contracting muscle depends on many factors: whole-body fuel storage mass, mobilization, blood transport, cellular uptake, and substrate selection at the level of the mitochondrion. We examined the fuel preferences of mitochondria isolated from mammalian and avian locomotory muscles using two approaches. First, the influence of substrates on the kinetics of respiration (K-m,K-ADP and V-max) was evaluated. For all substrates and combinations, K-m,K-ADP was generally twofold higher in avian mitochondria. Second, fuel competition between pyruvate, glutamate and/or palmitoyl-L-carnitine at three levels of ATP free energy was determined using the principle of mass balance and the measured rates of O-2 consumption and metabolite accumulation/utilization. Avian mitochondria strongly spared pyruvate from oxidation when another substrate was available and fatty acid was the dominant substrate, regardless of energy state. Mammalian mitochondria exhibited some preference for fatty acid over pyruvate at lower flux (higher energy state), but exhibited a much greater tendency to select pyruvate and glutamate when available. Studies in sonicated mitochondria revealed twofold higher electron transport chain electron conductance in avian mitochondria. We conclude that substantial fuel selection occurs at the level of the mitochondrial matrix and that avian flight muscle mitochondria are particularly biased toward the selection of fatty acid, possibly by facilitating high beta-oxidation flux by maintaining a more oxidized matrix.",2014,10.1242/jeb.098863,217,11,1993-2003,NA,Skeletal muscle mitochondria; Fuel selection; Mitochondrial function
article,Transcriptomic changes associated with maternal care in the brain of mouthbrooding cichlid<i> Astatotilapia</i><i> burtoni</i> reflect adaptation to self-induced metabolic stress,"Faber-Hammond, Joshua J. and Renn, Suzy C. P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Parental care in Astatotilapia burtoni entails females protecting eggs and developing fry in a specialized buccal cavity in the mouth. During this mouthbrooding behavior, which can last 2-3 weeks, mothers undergo voluntary fasting accompanied by loss of body mass and major metabolic changes. Following release of fry, females resume normal feeding behavior and quickly recover body mass as they become reproductively active once again. In order to investigate the molecular underpinnings of such dramatic behavioral and metabolic changes, we sequenced whole-brain transcriptomes from females at four time points throughout their reproductive cycle: 2 days after the start of mouthbrooding, 14 days after the start of mouthbrooding, 2 days after the release of fry and 14 days after the release of fry. Differential expression analysis and clustering of expression profiles revealed a number of neuropeptides and hormones, including the strong candidate gene neurotensin, suggesting that molecular mechanisms underlying parental behaviors may be common across vertebrates despite de novo evolution of parental care in these lineages. In addition, oxygen transport pathways were found to be dramatically downregulated, particularly later in the mouthbrooding stage, while certain neuroprotective pathways were upregulated, possibly to mitigate negative consequences of metabolic depression brought about by fasting. Our results offer new insights into the evolution of parental behavior as well as revealing candidate genes that would be of interest for the of ischemia and disorders.",2023,10.1242/jeb.244734,226,4,NA,jeb244734,Behavior; Hypoxia; Parental care; Feeding; Reproductive strategy; Starvation; Transcriptome
article,Does the membrane pacemaker theory of metabolism explain the size dependence of metabolic rate in marine mussels?,"Sukhotin, Alexey and Fokina, Natalia and Ruokolainen, Tatiana and Bock, Christian and Poertner, Hans-Otto and Lannig, Gisela",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"According to the membrane pacemaker theory of metabolism (MPT), allometric scaling of metabolic rate in animals is determined by the composition of cellular and mitochondrial membranes, which changes with body size in a predictable manner. MPT has been elaborated from interspecific comparisons in mammals. It projects that the degree of unsaturation of membrane phospholipids decreases in larger organisms, thereby lowering ion permeability of the membranes and making cellular, and thus whole-animal metabolism more efficient. Here, we tested the applicability of the MPT to a marine ectotherm, the mussel Mytilus edulis at the intraspecific level. We determined effects of body mass on whole-organism, tissue and cellular oxygen consumption rates, on heart rate, metabolic enzyme activities and on the lipid composition of membranes. In line with allometric patterns, the organismal functions and processes such as heart rate, whole-animal respiration rate and phospholipid contents showed a mass-dependent decline. However, the allometry of tissue and cellular respiration and activity of metabolic enzymes was poor; fatty acid unsaturation of membrane phospholipids of gill tissue was independent of animal size. It is thus conceivable that most of the metabolic allometry observed at the organismal level is determined by systemic functions. These wholeorganism patterns may be supported by energy savings associated with growing cell size but not by structural changes in membranes. Overall, the set of processes contributing to metabolic allometry in ectotherms may differ from that operative in mammals and birds, with a reduced involvement of the mechanisms proposed by the MPT.",2017,10.1242/jeb.147108,220,8,1423-1434,NA,Allometric scaling; Cells; Fatty acids; Heart rate; Enzyme activity; Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging
article,Telomere dynamics in free-living edible dormice (<i>Glis glis</i>): the impact of hibernation and food supply,"Hoelzl, Franz and Cornils, Jessica S. and Smith, Steve and Moodley, Yoshan and Ruf, Thomas",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"We studied the impact of hibernation and food supply on relative telomere length (RTL), an indicator for aging and somatic maintenance, in free-living edible dormice. Small hibernators such as dormice have similar to 50\% higher maximum longevity than non-hibernators. Increased longevity could theoretically be due to prolonged torpor directly slowing cellular damage and RTL shortening. However, although mitosis is arrested in mammals at low body temperatures, recent evidence points to accelerated RTL shortening during periodic re-warming (arousal) from torpor. Therefore, we hypothesized that these arousals during hibernation should have a negative effect on RTL. Here, we show that RTL was shortened in all animals over the course of similar to 1 year, during which dormice hibernated for 7.5-11.4 months. The rate of periodic arousals, rather than the time spent euthermic during the hibernation season, was the best predictor of RTL shortening. This finding points to negative effects on RTL of the transition from low torpor to high euthermic body temperature and metabolic rate during arousals, possibly because of increased oxidative stress. The animals were, however, able to elongate their telomeres during the active season, when food availability was increased by supplemental feeding in a year of low natural food abundance. We conclude that in addition to their energetic costs, periodic arousals also lead to accelerated cellular damage in terms of RTL shortening. Although dormice are able to counteract and even over-compensate for the negative effects of hibernation, restoration of RTL appears to be energetically costly.",2016,10.1242/jeb.140871,219,16,2469-2474,NA,Real-time PCR; Feeding experiment; Torpor; Somatic maintenance; Aging

E. and Andersen, Sidsel D. and Hoffmann, Federico G. and Weber, Roy E. and Anderson, Trevor and Storz, Jay F. and Fago, Angela",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Genetically based modifications of hemoglobin (Hb) function that increase blood-O-2 affinity are hallmarks of hypoxia adaptation in vertebrates. Among mammals, felid Hbs are unusual in that they have low intrinsic O-2 affinities and reduced sensitivities to the allosteric cofactor 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG). This combination of features compromises the acclimatization capacity of blood-O-2 affinity and has led to the hypothesis that felids have a restricted physiological niche breadth relative to other mammals. In seeming defiance of this conjecture, the snow leopard (Panthera uncia) has an extraordinarily broad elevational distribution and occurs at elevations above 6000 m in the Himalayas. Here, we characterized structural and functional variation of big cat Hbs and investigated molecular mechanisms of Hb adaptation and allosteric regulation that may contribute to the extreme hypoxia tolerance of the snow leopard. Experiments revealed that purified Hbs from snow leopard and African lion exhibited equally low O-2 affinities and DPG sensitivities. Both properties are primarily attributable to a single amino acid substitution, beta 2His -> Phe, which occurred in the common ancestor of Felidae. Given the low O-2 affinity and reduced regulatory capacity of feline Hbs, the extreme hypoxia tolerance of snow leopards must be attributable to compensatory modifications of other steps in the O-2-transport pathway.",2015,10.1242/jeb.125369,218,15,2402-2409,NA,Felidae; Oxygen affinity; Amino acid substitution; Blood-oxygen transport; Allosteric regulation

Although the diversity of Symbiodinium provides a possible axis for niche diversification, increased functional range and resilience to physical stressors such as elevated temperature, how such diversity relates to the physiological balance between autotrophy and heterotrophy of the host animal remains unknown. Here, we experimentally show interspecific and intraspecific variability of photosynthetic carbon fixation and subsequent translocation by Symbiodinium to the model cnidarian host Aiptasia pallida. By using a clonal anemone line harboring different species of Symbiodinium, we determined that symbiont identity influences trophic plasticity through its density, capacity to fix carbon, quantity of translocated carbon and ultimately the host's capacity to ingest and digest prey. Symbiont carbon translocation and host prey ingestion were positively correlated across symbiont combinations that consisted of different isoclonal lines of Symbiodinium minutum, while a combination with type D4-5 Symbiodinium displayed lower carbon translocation, and prey capture and digestion more similar to Aiptasia lacking symbionts. The absence of a shift toward greater heterotrophy when carbon translocation is low suggests that the metabolic demand of feeding and digestion may overwhelm nutritional stores when photosynthesis is reduced, and amends the possible role of animal feeding in resistance to or recovery from the effects of climate change in more obligate symbioses such as reef-building corals.",2015,10.1242/jeb.115519,218,6,858-863,NA,Symbiodinium; Functional diversity; Nutrition; Photosynthesis

During the hibernation season, many species of hibernating mammals cycle repeatedly between the active (aroused) and hibernating (torpid) states (T-A cycling), using brown adipose tissue (BAT) to drive cyclical rewarming. The regulatory mechanisms controlling this process remain undefined but are presumed to involve thermoregulatory centres in the hypothalamus. Here, we used the golden hamster (Mesoc \& nacute;cetus auratus), and high-resolution monitoring of BAT, core body temperature and ventilation rate, to sample at precisely defined phases of the T-A cycle. Using c-fos as a marker of cellular activity, we show that although the dorsomedial hypothalamus is active during torpor entry, neither it nor the pre-optic area shows any significant changes during the earliest stages of spontaneous arousal. Contrastingly, in three non-neuronal sites previously linked to control of metabolic physiology over seasonal and daily time scales - the choroid plexus, pars tuberalis and third ventricle tanycytes - peak c-fos expression is seen at arousal initiation.

article,A heterothermic spectrum in hummingbirds,"Shankar, Anusha and Cisneros, Isabelle N. H. and Thompson, Sarah and Graham, Catherine H. and Powers, Donald R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Many endotherms use torpor, saving energy by a controlled reduction of their body temperature and metabolic rate. Some species (e.g. arctic ground squirrels, hummingbirds) enter deep torpor, dropping their body temperature by 23-37 degrees C, while others can only enter shallow torpor (e.g. pigeons, 3-10 degrees C reduction). However, deep torpor in mammals can increase predation risk (unless animals are in burrows or caves), inhibit immune function and result in sleep deprivation, so even for species that can enter deep torpor, facultative shallow torpor might help balance energy savings with these potential costs. Deep torpor occurs in three avian orders, but the trade-offs of deep torpor in birds are unknown. Although the literature hints that some bird species (mousebirds and perhaps hummingbirds) can use both shallow and deep torpor, little empirical evidence of such an avian heterothermy spectrum within species exists. We infrared imaged three hummingbird species that are known to use deep torpor, under natural temperature and light cycles, to test whether they were also capable of shallow torpor. All three species used both deep and shallow torpor, often on the same night. Depending on the species, they used shallow torpor for 5-35\% of the night. The presence of a heterothermic spectrum in these bird species indicates a capacity for fine-scale physiological and genetic regulation of avian torpid metabolism.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243208,225,2,NA,jeb243208,Body temperature; Torpor; Metabolism; Hypothermia; Avian; Mammals

Bats have particularly high energy demands compared to other mammals and regularly use torpor to save energy. However, while torpor limits energy expenditure, it can also downregulate important processes, such as sperm production. This constraint could result in a trade-off between energy saving and future reproductive capacity. We mimicked harsh conditions by restricting food and tested the effect on changes in body mass, torpor use and seasonal sexual maturation in male parti-coloured bats (Vespertilio murinus). Food-restricted individuals managed to maintain their initial body mass, while in well-fed males, mass increased. Interestingly, despite large differences in food availability, therewere only small differences in torpor patterns. However, well-fed males reached sexual maturity up to half a month earlier. Our results thus reveal a complex trade-off in resource allocation; independent of resource availability, males maintain a similar thermoregulation strategy and favour fast sexual maturation, but limited resources and low body mass moderate this latter process.",2020,10.1242/jeb.214825,223,8,NA,jeb214825,Vespertilio murinus; Energetic trade-off; Body condition; Spermatogenesis; Heterothermy
article,A radical shift in perspective: mitochondria as regulators of reactive oxygen species,"Munro, Daniel and Treberg, Jason R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Mitochondria are widely recognized as a source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in animal cells, where it is assumed that overproduction of ROS leads to an overwhelmed antioxidant system and oxidative stress. In this Commentary, we describe a more nuanced model of mitochondrial ROS metabolism, where integration of ROS production with consumption by the mitochondrial antioxidant pathways may lead to the regulation of ROS levels. Superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) are the main ROS formed by mitochondria. However, superoxide, a free radical, is converted to the non-radical, membrane-permeant H2O2; consequently, ROS may readily cross cellular compartments. By combining measurements of production and consumption of H2O2, it can be shown that isolated mitochondria can intrinsically approach a steady-state concentration of H2O2 in the medium. The central hypothesis here is that mitochondria regulate the concentration of H2O2 to a value set by the balance between production and consumption. In this context, the consumers of ROS are not simply a passive safeguard against oxidative stress; instead, they control the established steady-state concentration of H2O2. By considering the response of rat skeletal muscle mitochondria to high levels of ADP, we demonstrate that H2O2 production by mitochondria is far more sensitive to changes in mitochondrial energetics than is H2O2 consumption; this concept is further extended to evaluate how the muscle mitochondrial H2O2 balance should respond to changes in aerobic work load. We conclude by considering how differences in the ROS consumption pathways may lead to important distinctions amongst tissues, along with briefly examining implications for differing levels of activity, temperature change and metabolic depression.",2017,10.1242/jeb.132142,220,7,1170-1180,NA,Hydrogen peroxide; Energetics; Antioxidant; Skeletal muscle; Oxidative stress; Glutathione peroxidase; Thioredoxin; Peroxiredoxin
article,Migration increases mitochondrial oxidative capacity without increasing reactive oxygen species emission in a songbird,"Coulson, Soren Z. and Guglielmo, Christopher G. and Staples, James F.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Birds remodel their flight muscle metabolism prior to migration to meet the physiological demands of migratory flight, including increases in both oxidative capacity and defence against reactive oxygen species. The degree of plasticity mediated by changes in these mitochondrial properties is poorly understood but may be explained by two nonmutually exclusive hypotheses: variation in mitochondrial quantity or in individual mitochondrial function. We tested these hypotheses using yellow-rumped warblers ( Setophaga coronata ), a Nearctic songbird which biannually migrates 2000-5000 km. We predicted higher flight muscle mitochondrial abundance and substrate oxidative capacity, and decreased reactive oxygen species emission in migratory warblers captured during autumn migration compared with a short-day photoperiod-induced non-migratory phenotype. We assessed mitochondrial abundance via citrate synthase activity and assessed isolated mitochondrial function using high-resolution fluororespirometry. We found 60\% higher tissue citrate synthase activity in the migratory phenotype, indicating higher mitochondrial abundance. We also found 70\% higher State 3 respiration (expressed per unit citrate synthase) in mitochondria from migratory warblers when oxidizing palmitoylcarnitine, but similar H 2 O 2 emission rates between phenotypes. By contrast, non-phosphorylating respiration was higher and H 2 O 2 emission rates were lower in the migratory phenotype. However, flux through electron transport system complexes I-IV, II-IV and IV was similar between phenotypes. In support of our hypotheses, these data suggest that flight muscle mitochondrial abundance and function are seasonally remodelled in migratory songbirds to increase tissue oxidative capacity without increasing reactive oxygen species formation.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246849,227,9,NA,jeb246849,Flight muscle; Locomotory performance; OXPHOS; Endurance locomotion; Plasticity; ROS; Energetics

This study investigated the effect of temperature reductions on Montastraea cavemosa and Ponies astreoides in Bermuda (32 degrees N; sea surface temperature similar to 19-29 degrees C) over 5 weeks, applying the following treatments: (i) constant control temperature at 28 degrees C, and (ii) temperature reduction (0.5 degrees C day(-1)) followed by constant temperature (20 days; acclimatization period) at 24 degrees C and (iii) at 20 degrees C. Both species decreased photosynthesis and respiration during temperature reduction as expected, which continued to decrease during the acclimatization period, indicating adjustment to a low energy turnover rather than thermal compensation. Trajectories of physiological adjustments and level of thermal compensation, however, differed between species. Montastraea cavemosa zooxanthellae metrics showed a strong initial response to temperature reduction, followed by a return to close to control values during the acclimatization period, reflecting a high physiological flexibility and low thermal compensation. Ponies astreoides zooxanthellae, in contrast, showed no initial response, but an increase in pigment concentration per zooxanthellae and similar photosynthesis rates at 24 degrees C and 20 degrees C at the end of the experiment, indicating low acute thermal sensitivity and the ability for thermal compensation at the lowest temperature. Respiration decreased more strongly than photosynthesis, leading to significant build-up of biomass in both species (energy reserves). Results are important in the light of potential poleward migration of corals and of potential latitudinal and species-specific differences in coral thermal tolerance.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244196,225,13,NA,jeb244196,Seasonal temperature variability; Coral; Symbiodinium; Physiological adjustment; Temperature reduction; Subtropics
article,"Warmer, faster, stronger: Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> cycling in avian myocardium","Filatova, Tatiana S. and Abramochkin, V, Denis and Shiels, Holly A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Birds occupy a unique position in the evolution of cardiac design. Their hearts are capable of cardiac performance on par with, or exceeding that of mammals, and yet the structure of their cardiomyocytes resembles those of reptiles. It has been suggested that birds use intracellular Ca2+ stored within the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) to power contractile function, but neither SR Ca2+ content nor the cross-talk between channels underlying Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) have been studied in adult birds. Here we used voltage clamp to investigate the Ca2+ storage and refilling capacities of the SR and the degree of trans-sarcolemmal and intracellular Ca2+ channel interplay in freshly isolated atrial and ventricular myocytes from the heart of the Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica). A trans-sarcolemmal Ca2+ current (ICa) was detectable in both quail atrial and ventricular myocytes, and was mediated only by L-type Ca2+ channels. The peak density of ICa was larger in ventricular cells than in atrial cells, and exceeded that reported for mammalian myocardium recorded under similar conditions. Steadystate SR Ca2+ content of quail myocardium was also larger than that reported for mammals, and reached 750.6 +/- 128.2 mu mol l(-1) in atrial cells and 423.3 +/- 47.2 mu mol l(-1) in ventricular cells at 24 degrees C. We observed SR Ca2+-dependent inactivation of ICa in ventricular myocytes, indicating cross-talk between sarcolemmal Ca2+ channels and ryanodine receptors in the SR. However, this phenomenon was not observed in atrial myocytes. Taken together, these findings help to explain the high-efficiency avian myocyte excitation-contraction coupling with regard to their reptilian-like cellular ultrastructure.",2020,10.1242/jeb.228205,223,19,NA,jeb228205,Bird; Coturnix japonica; Excitation-contraction coupling; Heart; L-type Ca2+ current; Sarcoplasmic reticulum
article,"Selection for longer limbs in mice increases bone stiffness and brittleness, but does not alter bending strength","Cosman, Miranda N. and Britz, Hayley M. and Rolian, Campbell",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The ability of a bone to withstand loads depends on its structural and material properties. These tend to differ among species with different modes of locomotion, reflecting their unique loading patterns. The evolution of derived limb morphologies, such as the long limbs associated with jumping, may compromise overall bone strength. We evaluated bone mechanical properties in the Longshanks mouse, which was selectively bred for increased tibia length relative to body mass. We combined analyses of 3D shape and cross-sectional geometry of the tibia, with mechanical testing and bone composition assays, to compare bone strength, elastic properties and mineral composition in Longshanks mice and randomly bred controls. Our data show that, despite being more slender, cortical geometry and predicted bending strength of the Longshanks tibia were similar to controls. In whole bone bending tests, measures of bone bending strength were similar across groups; however, Longshanks tibiae were significantly more rigid, more brittle, and required less than half the energy to fracture. Tissue-level elastic properties were also altered in Longshanks mice, but the bones did not differ from the control in water content, ash content or density. These results indicate that while Longshanks bones are as strong as control tibiae, selection for increased tibia length has altered its elastic properties, possibly through changes in organic bony matrix composition. We conclude that selection for certain limb morphologies, and/or selection for rapid skeletal growth, can lead to tissue-level changes that can increase the risk of skeletal fracture, which in turn may favor the correlated evolution of compensatory mechanisms to mitigate increased fracture risk, such as delayed skeletal maturity.",2019,10.1242/jeb.203125,222,9,NA,jeb203125,Artificial selection; Bone cross-sectional geometry; Bone stiffness; Bone strength; Longshanks mouse

Gerardo M. and da Cruz-Neto, Ariovaldo P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The acute phase response (APR) is a core component of the innate immune response and represents the first line of immune defense used in response to infections. Although several studies with vertebrates reported fever, a decrease in food intake and body mass, and an increase in neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and total white blood cell count after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inoculation, there was great variability in the magnitude of these responses. Some of these differences might reflect, to some extent, differences in the time of endotoxin inoculation (during active or rest periods) and dose. Therefore, our study tested the interplay between LPS dose and time of injection on selected physiological ( fever and increase in total white blood cell count and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio) and behavioral (food intake) components of the APR using a Neotropical fruit-eating bat (Carollia perspicillata) as a model organism. We predicted that LPS would trigger a dose- and time-dependent response in APR components. APR components were assessed in rest and active periods after injection of three doses of LPS (5, 10 and 15 mg kg(-1) LPS). The results indicate a more robust decrease in food intake at higher doses during the active period, while increased neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio was more robust during the active period regardless of dose. Furthermore, the skin temperature increase lasted longer at higher doses regardless of the timing of injections. Our study offers important insights into the dependence of time as well as the LPS dosage effect in the APR of bats, and how they deal with the magnitude of infections at different times of day.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244583,225,24,NA,jeb244583,Chiroptera; Lipopolysaccharide; Innate immune response; Activity period; Resting period

Following respirometry to calibrate Oxygen consumption rate ((M) over dot(O2)) with DBA under controlled conditions, predictive models can be applied to DBA data collected from free-ranging individuals. However, laboratory calibrations are generally performed on a relatively narrow size range of animals, which may introduce biases if predictive models are applied to differently sized individuals in the field. Here, we tested the mass dependence of the (M) over dot(O2)-DBA relationship to develop an experimental framework for the estimation of field metabolic rates when organisms differ in size. We performed respirometry experiments with individuals spanning one order of magnitude in body mass (1.74-17.15 kg) and used a two-stage modelling process to assess the intraspecific scale dependence of the (M) over dot(O2)-DBA relationship and incorporate such dependencies into the coefficients of (M) over dotO(2) predictive models. The final predictive model showed scale dependence; the slope of the (M) over dot(O2)-DBA relationship was strongly allometric (M-1.55), whereas the intercept term scaled closer to isometry (M-1.08). Using bootstrapping and simulations, we evaluated the performance of this coefficient-corrected model against commonly used methods of accounting for mass effects on the (M) over dot(O2)-DBA relationship and found the lowest error and bias in the coefficient-corrected approach. The strong scale dependence of the (M) over dot(O2)-DBA relationship indicates that caution must be exercised when models developed using one size class are applied to individuals of different sizes.",2021,10.1242/jeb.233544,224,7,NA,jeb233544,Lemon shark; Negaprion brevirostris; Oxygen consumption rate; Biologging; Ecophysiology; Elasmobranch; Respirometry
article,Early-life hypoxia alters adult physiology and reduces stress resistance and lifespan in <i>Drosophila</i>,"Polan, Danielle M. and Alansari, Mohammad and Lee, Byoungchun and Grewal, Savraj S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In many animals, short-term fluctuations in environmental conditions in early life often exert long-term effects on adult physiology. In Drosophila, one ecologically relevant environmental variable is hypoxia. Drosophila larvae live on rotting, fermenting food rich in microorganisms, an environment characterized by low ambient oxygen. They have therefore evolved to tolerate hypoxia. Although the acute effects of hypoxia in larvae have been well studied, whether early-life hypoxia affects adult physiology and fitness is less clear. Here, we show that Drosophila exposed to hypoxia during their larval period subsequently show reduced starvation stress resistance and shorter lifespan as adults, with these effects being stronger in males. We find that these effects are associated with reduced whole-body insulin signaling but elevated TOR kinase activity, a manipulation known to reduce lifespan. We also identify a sexually dimorphic effect of larval hypoxia on adult nutrient storage and mobilization. Thus, we find that males, but not females, show elevated levels of lipids and glycogen. Moreover, we see that both males and females exposed to hypoxia as larvae show defective lipid mobilization upon starvation stress as adults. These data demonstrate how early-life hypoxia can exert persistent, sexually dimorphic, long-term effects on Drosophila adult physiology and lifespan.",2020,10.1242/jeb.226027,223,22,NA,jeb226027,Glucose; Glycogen; Akt; Lifespan; Starvation stress; Metabolism; Insulin; TOR; Lipids; Sexual dimorphism
article,What determines the basal rate of metabolism?,"McNab, Brian K.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The basal rate of metabolism (BMR) is the most reported estimate of energy expenditure in endotherms. Its principal determinant is body mass, but BMR also correlates with a variety of behavioral and ecological factors that do not determine basal rate: they are byproducts of the mechanisms that are its determinate. In mammals, mass-independent BMR increases when muscle mass is >40\% of total body mass and BMR is then >= 100\% of the value expected from body mass. Mammals with muscle masses <30\% of body mass have lower BMRs, a diminished capacity to regulate body temperature and often have reduced activity levels. At muscle masses <42\% of body mass, birds have body temperatures and basal rates higher than mammals with the same muscle mass. Their high basal rates derive from fast blood flow and increased mitochondrial density in their pectoral muscles. These enhancements also occur in the flight muscles of bats. Oxygen transport to the pectoral muscles of birds is facilitated by an increase in heart mass and hematocrit. This arrangement avoids transporting a large muscle mass to fuel flight, thereby reducing the cost of flight. Pectoral muscle masses <9\% of body mass correlate with a flightless condition in kiwis, rails and ducks but some fruit pigeons have BMRs as low as those measured in kiwis, while remaining volant. The mass-independent BMRs of endotherms principally reflect changes of muscle activity and mass. An increase in muscle mass may have contributed to the evolution of endothermy.",2019,10.1242/jeb.205591,222,15,NA,jeb205591,BMR; Capillary volume; Flightless birds; Migration; Mitochondrial density; Muscle mass; Sedentary lifestyle

P. and Onken, Horst and Treberg, Jason R. and Weihrauch, Dirk",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Many studies have investigated ammonia excretion and acid-base regulation in aquatic arthropods, yet current knowledge of marine chelicerates is non-existent. In American horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus), book gills bear physiologically distinct regions: dorsal and ventral half-lamellae, a central mitochondria-rich area (CMRA) and peripheral mitochondria-poor areas (PMPAs). In the present study, the CMRA and ventral half-lamella exhibited characteristics important for ammonia excretion and/or acid-base regulation, as supported by high expression levels of Rhesus-protein 1 (LpRh-1), cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase (CA-2) and hyperpolarizationactivated cyclic nucleotide-gated K+ channel (HCN) compared with the PMPA and dorsal half-lamella. The half-lamellae displayed remarkable differences; the ventral epithelium was ion-leaky whereas the dorsal counterpart possessed an exceptionally tight epithelium. LpRh-1 was more abundant than Rhesus-protein 2 (LpRh-2) in all investigated tissues, but LpRh-2 was more prevalent in the PMPA than in the CMRA. Ammonia influx associated with high ambient ammonia (HAA) treatment was counteracted by intact animals and complemented by upregulation of branchial CA-2, Vtype H+-ATPase (HAT), HCN and LpRh-1 mRNA expression. The dorsal epithelium demonstrated characteristics of active ammonia excretion. However, an influx was observed across the ventral epithelium as a result of the tissue's high ion conductance, although the influx rate was not proportionately high considering the similar to 3-fold inwardly directed ammonia gradient. These novel findings suggest a role for the coxal gland in excretion and in the maintenance of hemolymph ammonia regulation under HAA. Hypercapnic exposure induced compensatory respiratory acidosis and partial metabolic depression. Functional differences between the two halves of a branchial lamella may be physiologically beneficial in reducing the backflow of waste products into adjacent lamellae, especially in fluctuating environments where ammonia levels can increase.",2018,10.1242/jeb.151894,221,6,NA,jeb151894,Ussing chamber; Gills; Rh-proteins; Carbonic anhydrase

Although considerable work has been invested in trying to understand each of the major diapause stages (induction, maintenance and termination), we know very little about the transitions between stages, especially diapause termination. Understanding diapause termination is crucial for modelling and predicting spring emergence and winter physiology of insects, including many pest insects. In order to gain these insights, we investigated metabolome dynamics across diapause development in pupae of the butterfly Pieris napi, which exhibits adaptive latitudinal variation in the length of endogenous diapause that is uniquely well characterized. By employing a time-series experiment, we show that the whole-body metabolome is highly dynamic throughout diapause and differs between pupae kept at a diapause-terminating (low) temperature and those kept at a diapause-maintaining (high) temperature. We showmajor physiological transitions through diapause, separate temperature-dependent from temperature-independent processes and identify significant patterns of metabolite accumulation and degradation. Together, the data show that although the general diapause phenotype (suppressed metabolism, increased cold tolerance) is established in a temperature-independent fashion, diapause termination is temperature dependent and requires a cold signal. This revealed several metabolites that are only accumulated under diapause-terminating conditions and degraded in a temperature-unrelated fashion during diapause termination. In conclusion, our findings indicate that some metabolites, in addition to functioning as cryoprotectants, for example, are candidates for having regulatory roles as metabolic clocks or time-keepers during diapause.",2018,10.1242/jeb.169508,221,2,NA,jeb169508,Hypometabolism; Stress; Cryoprotectant; Developmental plasticity; Biological clock; Phenology
article,Winter metabolic depression does not change arterial baroreflex control of heart rate in the tegu lizard <i>Salvator merianae</i>,"Zena, Lucas A. and Dantonio, Valter and Gargaglioni, Luciane H. and Andrade, Denis V. and Abe, Augusto S. and Bicego, Kenia C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Baroreflex regulation of blood pressure is important for maintaining appropriate tissue perfusion. Although temperature affects heart rate (f(H)) reflex regulation in some reptiles and toads, no data are available on the influence of temperature-independent metabolic states on baroreflex. The South American tegu lizard Salvator merianae exhibits a clear seasonal cycle of activity decreasing f(H) along with winter metabolic downregulation, independent of body temperature. Through pharmacological interventions (phenylephrine and sodium nitroprusside), the baroreflex control of f(H) was studied at similar to 25 degrees C in spring-summer-and winter-acclimated tegus. In winter lizards, resting and minimum fH were lower than in spring-summer animals (respectively, 13.3 +/- 0.82 versus 10.3 +/- 0.81 and 11.2 +/- 0.65 versus 7.97 +/- 0.88 beats min(-1)), while no acclimation differences occurred in resting blood pressure (5.14 +/- 0.38 versus 5.06 +/- 0.56 kPa), baroreflex gain (94.3 +/- 10.7 versus 138.7 +/- 30.3\% kPa(-1)) or rate-pressure product (an index ofmyocardial activity). Vagal tone exceeded the sympathetic tone of f(H), especially in the winter group. Therefore, despite the lower f(H), winter acclimation does not diminish the f(H) baroreflex responses or rate-pressure product, possibly because of increased stroke volume that may arise because of heart hypertrophy. Independent of acclimation, f(H) responded more to hypotension than to hypertension. This should imply that tegus, which have no pressure separation within the single heart ventricle, must have other protection mechanisms against pulmonary hypertension or oedema, presumably through lymphatic drainage and/or vagal vasoconstriction of pulmonary artery. Such a predominant f(H) reflex response to hypotension, previously observed in anurans, crocodilians and mammals, may be a common feature of tetrapods.",2016,10.1242/jeb.129130,219,5,725-733,NA,Adrenergic receptors; Baroreceptor; Blood pressure; Cholinergic tone; Hibernation; Seasonal changes
article,Physiological responses of ectotherms to daily temperature variation,"Kern, Pippa and Cramp, Rebecca L. and Franklin, Craig E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Daily thermal fluctuations (DTFs) impact the capacity of ectotherms to maintain performance and energetic demands because of thermodynamic effects on physiological processes. Mechanisms that reduce the thermal sensitivity of physiological traits may buffer ectotherms from the consequences of DTFs. Species that experience varying degrees of DTFs in their environments may differ in their responses to thermally variable conditions, if thermal performance curves reflect environmental conditions. We tested the hypothesis that in response to DTFs, tadpoles from habitats characterised by small DTFs would show greater plasticity in the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes than tadpoles from environments characterised by large DTFs. We tested the thermal sensitivity of physiological traits in tadpoles of three species that differ naturally in their exposure to DTFs, raised in control (24 degrees C) and DTF treatments (20-30 degrees C and 18-38 degrees C). DTFs reduced growth in all species. Development of tadpoles experiencing DTFs was increased for tadpoles from highly thermally variable habitats (similar to 15\%), and slower in tadpoles from less thermally variable habitats (similar to 30\%). In general, tadpoles were unable to alter the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes, although DTFs induced plasticity in metabolic enzyme activity in all species, although to a greater extent in species from less thermally variable environments. DTFs increased upper thermal limits in all species (between 0.89 and 1.6 degrees C). Our results suggest that the impact of increased thermal variability may favour some species while others are negatively impacted.

article,Interindividual variation in maximum aerobic metabolism varies with gill morphology and myocardial bioenergetics in Gulf killifish,"Rees, Bernard B. and Reemeyer, Jessica E. and Irving, Brian A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"This study asked whether interindividual variation in maximum and standard aerobic metabolic rates of the Gulf killifish, Fundulus grandis, correlates with gill morphology and cardiac mitochondrial bioenergetics, traits reflecting critical steps in the O-2 transport cascade from the environment to the tissues. Maximum metabolic rate (MMR) was positively related to body mass, total gill filament length and myocardial oxygen consumption during maximum oxidative phosphorylation (multiple R-2=0.836). Standard metabolic rate (SMR) was positively related to body mass, total gill filament length and myocardial oxygen consumption during maximum electron transport system activity (multiple R-2=0.717). After controlling for body mass, individuals with longer gill filaments, summed over all gill arches, or greater cardiac respiratory capacity had higher whole-animal metabolic rates. The overall model fit and the explanatory power of individual predictor variables were better for MMR than for SMR, suggesting that gill morphology and myocardial bioenergetics are more important in determining active rather than resting metabolism. After accounting for body mass, heart ventricle mass was not related to variation in MMR or SMR, indicating that the quality of the heart (i.e. the capacity for mitochondrial metabolism) was more influential than heart size. Finally, the myocardial oxygen consumption required to offset the dissipation of the transmembrane proton gradient in the absence of ATP synthesis was not correlated with either MMR or SMR. The results support the idea that interindividual variation in aerobic metabolism, particularly MMR, is associated with variation in specific steps in the O-2 transport cascade.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243680,225,12,NA,jeb243680,Fundulus; Gill morphology; Heart; Metabolic rate; Mitochondria; Oxygen transport cascade
article,Long duration advertisement calls of nesting male plainfin midshipman fish are honest indicators of size and condition,"Balebail, Sujay and Sisneros, Joseph A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The plainfin midshipman fish (Porichthys notatus) has long served as a model organism for neuroethology research on acoustic communication and related social behaviors. Type I or `singing' males produce highly stereotyped, periodic advertisement calls that are the longest known uninterrupted vertebrate vocalizations. Despite the extensive literature on the acoustic behaviour of this species, it remains unclear whether reproductive males signal their quality via their highly energetic, multiharmonic advertisement calls. Here, we recorded the advertisement calls of 22 reproductive type I males at night in a controlled laboratory setting in which males were housed in aquaria maintained at a constant temperature (13.9 +/- 0.3 degrees C). The duration of the advertisement calls from type I males was observed to increase from the first call of the night to the middle call after which call duration remained steady until the early morning hours and first light. A strong positive correlation was observed between loudness (sound pressure level and maximum sound pressure level) of the advertisement call and body size (mass and standard length; r(s) >0.8). In addition, an asymptotic relationship was observed between the harmonic frequencies (f(0)-f(10)) of the advertisement calls and male body condition, with harmonic frequencies initially increasing with body condition indices, but then plateauing when body condition measures were high. Taken together, our results suggest that type I male advertisement calls provide reliable honest information about male quality regarding size and body condition. Such condition-dependent information of calling males could potentially be used by receptive females to help facilitate mate choice decisions.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243889,225,8,NA,jeb243889,Fish bioacoustics; Toadfish; Social acoustic signals; Honest signals; Plainfin midshipman; Porichthys notatus

In ectotherms, environmental temperature can affect the magnitude and/or duration of the SDA, but is likely to also alter the mixture of nutrients that are oxidized to cover these costs. Here, we examined metabolic rate, gut passage time, assimilation efficiency and fuel use in the lizard Agama atra digesting cricket meals at three ecologically relevant temperatures (20, 25 and 32 degrees C). Crickets were isotopically enriched with C-13-leucine or C-13-palmitic-acid tracers to distinguish between protein and lipid oxidation, respectively. Our results show that higher temperatures increased the magnitude of the SDA peak (by 318\% between 32 and 20 degrees C) and gut passage rate (63\%), and decreased the duration of the SDA response (by 20\% for males and 48\% for females). Peak rate of dietary protein oxidation occurred sooner than peak lipid oxidation at all temperatures (70, 60 and 31 h earlier for 20, 25 and 32 degrees C, respectively). Assimilation efficiency of proteins, but not lipids, was positively related to temperature. Interestingly, the SDA response exhibited a notable circadian rhythm. These results show that temperature has a pronounced effect on digestive energetics in A. atra, and that this effect differs between nutrient classes.

article,Asymmetric energetic costs in reciprocal-cross hybrids between carnivorous mice (<i>Onychomys</i>),"Shipley, J. Ryan and Campbell, Polly and Searle, Jeremy B. and Pasch, Bret",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Aerobic respiration is a fundamental physiological trait dependent on coordinated interactions between gene products of the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Mitonuclear mismatch in interspecific hybrids may contribute to reproductive isolation by inducing reduced viability (or even complete inviability) due to increased metabolic costs. However, few studies have tested for effects of mitonuclear mismatch on respiration at the whole-organism level. We explored how hybridization affects metabolic rate in closely related species of grasshopper mice (genus Onychomys) to better understand the role of metabolic costs in reproductive isolation. We measured metabolic rate across a range of temperatures to calculate basal metabolic rate (BMR) and cold-induced metabolic rate (MRc) in O. leucogaster, O. torridus and O. arenicola, and in reciprocal F-1 hybrids between the latter two species. Within the genus, we found a negative correlation between mass-specific BMR and body mass. Although O. arenicola was smaller than O. torridus, hybrids from both directions of the cross resembled O. arenicola in body mass. In contrast, hybrid BMR was strongly influenced by the direction of the cross: reciprocal F-1 hybrids were different from each other but indistinguishable from the maternal species. In addition, MRc was not significantly different between hybrids and either parental species. These patterns indicate that metabolic costs are not increased in Onychomys F-1 hybrids and, while exposure of incompatibilities in F-2 hybrids cannot be ruled out, suggest that mitonuclear mismatch does not act as a primary barrier to gene flow. Maternal matching of BMR is suggestive of a strong effect of mitochondrial genotype on metabolism in hybrids. Together, our findings provide insight into the metabolic consequences of hybridization, a topic that is understudied in mammals.",2016,10.1242/jeb.148890,219,23,3803-3809,NA,Mitonuclear mismatch; Metabolic rate; Interspecific hybrids; F-1 hybrid; OXPHOS; Reproductive isolation
article,Skeletal muscle contractile function predicts activity and behaviour in zebrafish,"Seebacher, Frank and Little, Alexander G. and James, Rob S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Locomotion facilitates behaviour and its underlying physiological mechanisms may therefore impact behavioural phenotypes. Metabolism is often thought to modulate locomotion and behaviour, but empirical support for this suggestion is equivocal. Muscle contractile function is directly associated with locomotion. Here, we test the hypotheses that muscle mechanics determine locomotor performance and activity in zebrafish (Danio rerio) and thereby also affect risk-taking behaviour. We show that there is a mechanistic link between muscle performance and behaviour by manipulating muscle contractile properties, which caused proportional changes in critical sustained swimming performance and, in an open arena, voluntary swimming speed, the proportion of time fish were active, and the latency to move. We modelled the relationships between muscle contractile properties, swimming performance, activity and behaviour with a partial least-squares path model. The latent variable `muscle', formed by isolated muscle force production, stress, fatigue resistance and activation and relaxation rates, had a significant positive effect on swimming performance ('swim' reflected in sustained and sprint speeds). Together, muscle and swim had a significant positive effect on activity, and explained 71.8\% of variation in the distance moved, time active and maximum voluntary speed in an open field. Activity had a significant positive effect on boldness, explaining 76.0\% of variation in latencies to move and to approach a novel object. Muscle contractile function determines voluntary movement and we suggest that exploration and dispersal are functions of physiological and mechanical optimisation. Boldness therefore may be partly explained by the greater likelihood of faster fish to move further and encounter novel objects and conspecifics more quickly as a result.",2015,10.1242/jeb.129049,218,24,3878-3884,NA,Locomotor performance; Voluntary speed; Boldness; Muscle force; Muscle fatigue resistance; Open field

A few toothed whale species have fully adapted to river systems, where sonar operation is likely to result in higher clutter and reverberation levels than those experienced by most toothed whales at sea because of the shallow water and dense vegetation. To test the hypothesis that habitat shapes the evolution of toothed whale biosonar parameters by promoting simpler auditory scenes to interpret in acoustically complex habitats, echolocation clicks of wild Amazon river dolphins were recorded using a vertical seven-hydrophone array. We identified 404 on-axis biosonar clicks having a mean SLpp of 190.3 +/- 6.1 dB re. 1 mu Pa, mean SLEFD of 132.1 +/- 6.0 dB re. 1 mu Pa(2)s, mean F-c of 101.2 +/- 10.5 kHz, mean BWRMS of 29.3 +/- 4.3 kHz and mean ICI of 35.1 +/- 17.9 ms.

These results support the hypothesis that river-dwelling toothed whales operate their biosonars at lower amplitude and higher sampling rates than similar-sized marine species without sacrificing high directivity, in order to provide high update rates in acoustically complex habitats and simplify auditory scenes through reduced clutter and reverberation levels. We conclude that habitat, along with body size, is an important evolutionary driver of source parameters in toothed whale biosonars.",2015,10.1242/jeb.120501,218,19,3091-3101,NA,Beamwidth; Clutter; Directionality; Echolocation; Habitat; Toothed whale
article,Male and female syringeal muscles exhibit superfast shortening velocities in zebra finches,"Gladman, Nicholas W. and Elemans, Coen P. H.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Vocalisations play a key role in the communication behaviour of many vertebrates. Vocal production requires extremely precise motor control, which is executed by superfast vocal muscles that can operate at cycle frequencies over 100 Hz and up to 250 Hz. The mechanical performance of these muscles has been quantified with isometric performance and the workloop technique, but owing to methodological limitations we lack a key muscle property characterising muscle performance, the force-velocity relationship. Here, we quantified the force-velocity relationship in zebra finch superfast syringeal muscles using the isovelocity technique and tested whether the maximal shortening velocity is different between males and females. We show that syringeal muscles exhibit high maximal shortening velocities of 25L0 s-1at 30 degrees C. Using Q10-based extrapolation, we estimate they can reach 37-42L0 s-1on average at body temperature, exceeding other vocal and non-avian skeletal muscles. The increased speed does not adequately compensate for reduced force, which results in low power output. This further highlights the importance of high-frequency operation in these muscles. Furthermore, we show that isometric properties positively correlate with maximal shortening velocities. Although male and female muscles differ in isometric force development rates, maximal shortening velocity is not sex dependent. We also show that cyclical methods to measure force-length properties used in laryngeal studies give the same result as conventional stepwise methodologies, suggesting either approach is appropriate. We argue that vocal behaviour may be affected by the high thermal dependence of superfast vocal muscle performance.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246330,227,7,NA,jeb246330,Muscle performance; Isovelocity; Vmax; Vocal performance; Song learning
article,Measurements of body temperature and oxidative stress reveal differential costs associated with humoral immune function in a passerine bird,"Bryla, Amadeusz and Zagkle, Elisavet and Sadowska, Edyta T. and Cichon, Mariusz and Bauchinger, Ulf",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Eco-immunology considers resistance to antigens a costly trait for an organism, but actual quantification of such costs is not straightforward. Costs of the immune response are visible in impaired coloration and reduced growth or reproductive success. Activation of the humoral immune response is a slow, complex and long-lasting process, which makes the quantification of its energetic cost a potential losing game. We implemented near-continuous measurements of body temperature in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) as a proxy for the energetic cost, with a particular focus during activation of the humoral immune response until the peak of antibody release several days later. At the peak of the antibody release we additionally measured oxygen consumption (open-flow respirometry) and markers of oxidative stress (dROMs, OXY). Birds with an activated immune response maintained a higher night-time body temperature during the first 4 nights after an immune challenge in comparison to controls, implying increased night-time energy use. At peak antibody production, we did not find differences in night-time body temperature and oxygen consumption but observed differentiated results for oxygen consumption during the day. Immune-challenged females had significantly higher oxygen consumption compared with other groups. Moreover, we found that activation of the humoral immune response increases oxidative damage, a potential cost of maintaining the higher night-time body temperature that is crucial at the early stage of the immune response. The costs generated by the immune system appear to consist of two components - energetic and non-energetic - and these appear to be separated in time.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244897,225,23,NA,jeb244897,Core body temperature; Immune response; Oxidative damage; Eco-immunology
article,Genetic and environmental effects on the scaling of metabolic rate with body size,"Fossen, Erlend I. F. and Pelabon, Christophe and Einum, Sigurd",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Metabolic rate (MR) often scales with body mass (BM) following a power function of the form MR= aBM(b), where log(a) is the allometric intercept and b is the allometric exponent (i.e. slope on a log-log scale). The variational properties of b have been debated, but very few studies have tested for genetic variance in b, and none have tested for a genotype-by-environment (GxE) interaction in b. Consequently, the short-term evolutionary potentials of both b and its phenotypic plasticity remain unknown. Using 10 clones of a population of Daphnia magna, we estimated the genetic variance in b and assessed whether a GxE interaction affected b. We measured MR on juveniles of different sizes reared andmeasured at three temperatures (17, 22 and 28 degrees C). Overall, b decreased with increasing temperature. We found no evidence of genetic variance in b at any temperature, and thus no GxE interaction in b. However, we found a significant GxE interaction in size-specific MR. Using simulations, we show how this GxE interaction can generate genetic variation in the ontogenetic allometric slope of animals experiencing directional changes in temperature during growth. This suggests that b can evolve despite having limited genetic variation at constant temperatures.",2019,10.1242/jeb.193243,222,7,NA,jeb193243,Allometry; Body size; Constraints; Genotype-environment interaction; Metabolic scaling; Temperature; Evolvability
article,An intra-population heterothermy continuum: notable repeatability of body temperature variation in food-deprived yellow-necked mice,"Boratynski, Jan S. and Iwinska, Karolina and Bogdanowicz, Wieslaw",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Theoretical modelling predicts that the thermoregulatory strategies of endothermic animals range from those represented by thermal generalists to those characteristic for thermal specialists. While the generalists tolerate wide variations in body temperature (T-b), the specialists maintain T-b at a more constant level. The model has gained support from inter-specific comparisons relating to species and population levels. However, little is known about consistent among-individual variation within populations that could be shaped by natural selection. We studied the consistency of individual heterothermic responses to environmental challenges in a single population of yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis), by verifying the hypothesis that T-b variation is a repeatable trait. To induce the heterothermic response, the same individuals were repeatedly food deprived for 24 h. We measured T-b with implanted miniaturised data loggers. Before each fasting experiment, we measured basal metabolic rate (BMR). Thus, we also tested whether individual variation of heterothermy correlates with individual self-maintenance costs, and the potential benefits arising from heterothermic responses that should correlate with body size/mass. We found that some individuals clearly entered torpor while others kept T-b stable, and that there were also individuals that showed intermediate thermoregulatory patterns. Heterothermy was found to correlate negatively with body mass and slightly positively with the BMR achieved 1-2 days before fasting. Nonetheless, heterothermy was shown to be highly repeatable, irrespective of whether we controlled for self-maintenance costs and body size. Our results indicate that specialist and generalist thermoregulatory phenotypes can co-exist in a single population, creating a heterothermy continuum.",2019,10.1242/jeb.197152,222,6,NA,jeb197152,Torpor; Repeatability; Homeothermy; Endothermy; Mammals; Specialist-generalist
article,Physiological vagility and its relationship to dispersal and neutral genetic heterogeneity in vertebrates,"Hillman, Stanley S. and Drewes, Robert C. and Hedrick, Michael S. and Hancock, Thomas V.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Vagility is the inherent power of movement by individuals. Vagility and the available duration of movement determine the dispersal distance individuals can move to interbreed, which affects the fine-scale genetic structure of vertebrate populations. Vagility and variation in population genetic structure are normally explained by geographic variation and not by the inherent power of movement by individuals. We present a new, quantitative definition for physiological vagility that incorporates aerobic capacity, body size, body temperature and the metabolic cost of transport, variables that are independent of the physical environment. Physiological vagility is the speed at which an animal can move sustainably based on these parameters. This meta-analysis tests whether this definition of physiological vagility correlates with empirical data for maximal dispersal distances and measured microsatellite genetic differentiation with distance \{{[}F-ST/{[}1-F-ST)]/ln distance\} for amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals utilizing three locomotor modes (running, flying, swimming). Maximal dispersal distance and physiological vagility increased with body mass for amphibians, reptiles and mammals utilizing terrestrial movement. The relative slopes of these relationships indicate that larger individuals require longer movement durations to achieve maximal dispersal distances. Both physiological vagility and maximal dispersal distance were independent of body mass for flying vertebrates. Genetic differentiation with distance was greatest for terrestrial locomotion, with amphibians showing the greatest mean and variance in differentiation. Flying birds, flying mammals and swimming marine mammals showed the least differentiation. Mean physiological vagility of different groups (class and locomotor mode) accounted for 98\% of the mean variation in genetic differentiation with distance in each group. Genetic differentiation with distance was not related to body mass. The physiological capacity for movement (physiological vagility) quantitatively predicts genetic isolation by distance in the vertebrates examined.",2014,10.1242/jeb.105908,217,18,3356-3364,NA,Vagility; Dispersal and body mass; Genetic isolation by distance; Meta-analysis; Microsatellites
article,"PPAR expression, muscle size and metabolic rates across the gray catbird's annual cycle are greatest in preparation for fall migration","DeMoranville, Kristen J. and Corder, Keely R. and Hamilton, Angelica and Russell, David E. and Huss, Janice M. and Schaeffer, Paul J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Phenotypic flexibility across the annual cycle allows birds to adjust to fluctuating ecological demands. Varying energetic demands associated with time of year have been demonstrated to drive metabolic and muscle plasticity in birds, but it remains unclear what molecular mechanisms control this flexibility. We sampled gray catbirds at five stages across their annual cycle: tropical overwintering (January), northward spring (late) migration (early May), breeding (mid June), the fall pre-migratory period (early August) and southward fall (early) migration (end September). Across the catbird's annual cycle, cold-induced metabolic rate ((V) over dot(O2summit)) was highest during migration and lowest during tropical wintering. Flight muscles exhibited significant hypertrophy and/or hyperplasia during fall migratory periods compared with breeding and the fall pre-migratory period. Changes in heart mass were driven by the tropical wintering stage, when heart mass was lowest. Mitochondrial content of the heart and pectoralis remained constant across the annual cycle as quantified by aerobic enzyme activities (CS, CCO), as did lipid catabolic capacity (HOAD). In the pectoralis, transcription factors PPAR alpha, PPAR delta and ERR beta, coactivators PGC-1 alpha and beta, and genes encoding proteins associated with fat uptake (FABPpm, Plin3) were unexpectedly upregulated in the tropical wintering stage, whereas those involved in fatty acid oxidation (ATGL, LPL, MCAD) were downregulated, suggesting a preference for fat storage over utilization. Transcription factors and coactivators were synchronously upregulated during pre-migration and fall migration periods in the pectoralis but not the heart, suggesting that these pathways are important in preparation for and during early migration to initiate changes to phenotypes that facilitate long-distance migration.",2019,10.1242/jeb.198028,222,14,NA,jeb198028,Avian migration; Metabolic flexibility; (V) over dot(O2summit); Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors; Pectoralis

One aspect that has been previously overlooked is possible change in transepithelial potential (TEP) caused by hypoxia, which will influence branchial ionic fluxes. Using the euryhaline killifish, we show that acute hypoxia reduces the TEP across the gills by approximately 10 mV in animals acclimated to both freshwater (FW) and seawater (SW), with a higher PO2 threshold in the former. TEP becomes negative in FW, and less positive in SW. The effects are immediate, stable for at least 3 h, and reverse immediately upon return to normoxia. Hypoxia also blocks the normal increase in TEP that occurs upon transfer from FW to SW, but does not reduce the fall in TEP that occurs with transfer in the opposite direction. These effects may be beneficial in FW but not in SW.",2015,10.1242/jeb.122176,218,14,2152-2155,NA,Transepithelial potential; Gill permeability; P-Cl/P-Na ratio; Diffusion potential; Electrogenic potential
article,Myoglobin oxygen affinity in aquatic and terrestrial birds and mammals,"Wright, Traver J. and Davis, Randall W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Myoglobin (Mb) is an oxygen binding protein found in vertebrate skeletal muscle, where it facilitates intracellular transport and storage of oxygen. This protein has evolved to suit unique physiological needs in the muscle of diving vertebrates that express Mb at much greater concentrations than their terrestrial counterparts. In this study, we characterized Mb oxygen affinity (P-50) from 25 species of aquatic and terrestrial birds and mammals. Among diving species, we tested for correlations between Mb P-50 and routine dive duration. Across all species examined, Mb P-50 ranged from 2.40 to 4.85 mmHg. The mean P-50 of Mb from terrestrial ungulates was 3.72 +/- 0.15 mmHg (range 3.70-3.74 mmHg). The P-50 of cetaceans was similar to terrestrial ungulates ranging from 3.54 to 3.82 mmHg, with the exception of the melon-headed whale, which had a significantly higher P-50 of 4.85 mmHg. Among pinnipeds, the P-50 ranged from 3.23 to 3.81 mmHg and showed a trend for higher oxygen affinity in species with longer dive durations. Among diving birds, the P-50 ranged from 2.40 to 3.36 mmHg and also showed a trend of higher affinities in species with longer dive durations. In pinnipeds and birds, low Mb P-50 was associated with species whose muscles are metabolically active under hypoxic conditions associated with aerobic dives. Given the broad range of potential globin oxygen affinities, Mb P-50 from diverse vertebrate species appears constrained within a relatively narrow range. High Mb oxygen affinity within this range may be adaptive for some vertebrates that make prolonged dives.",2015,10.1242/jeb.119321,218,14,2180-2189,NA,Aerobic dive limit; Marine mammal; Hypoxia; Molecular evolution; nitric oxide
article,Magnetic navigation behavior and the oceanic ecology of young loggerhead sea turtles,"Putman, Nathan F. and Verley, Philippe and Endres, Courtney S. and Lohmann, Kenneth J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"During long-distance migrations, animals navigate using a variety of sensory cues, mechanisms and strategies. Although guidance mechanisms are usually studied under controlled laboratory conditions, such methods seldom allow for navigation behavior to be examined in an environmental context. Similarly, although realistic environmental models are often used to investigate the ecological implications of animal movement, explicit consideration of navigation mechanisms in such models is rare. Here, we used an interdisciplinary approach in which we first conducted lab-based experiments to determine how hatchling loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) respond to magnetic fields that exist at five widely separated locations along their migratory route, and then studied the consequences of the observed behavior by simulating it within an ocean circulation model. Magnetic fields associated with two geographic regions that pose risks to young turtles (due to cold wintertime temperatures or potential displacement from the migratory route) elicited oriented swimming, whereas fields from three locations where surface currents and temperature pose no such risk did not. Additionally, at locations with fields that elicited oriented swimming, simulations indicate that the observed behavior greatly increases the likelihood of turtles advancing along the migratory pathway. Our findings suggest that the magnetic navigation behavior of sea turtles is intimately tied to their oceanic ecology and is shaped by a complex interplay between ocean circulation and geomagnetic dynamics.",2015,10.1242/jeb.109975,218,7,1044-1050,NA,Magnetic orientation; Navigation; Magnetoreception; Caretta caretta; Ocean circulation model

Studies have shown that some diving mammals exhibit changes in the metabolic phenotype of locomotory muscles compared with non-divers, but the pervasiveness of such changes across diving animals is unclear, particularly among diving birds. Here, we examined whether changes in muscle phenotype and mitochondrial abundance are associated with dive capacity across 17 species of ducks from three distinct evolutionary clades (tribes) in the subfamily Anatinae: the longest diving sea ducks, the mid-tier diving pochards and the non-diving dabblers. In the gastrocnemius (the primary swimming and diving muscle), mitochondrial volume density in both oxidative and glycolytic fiber types was 70\% and 30\% higher in sea ducks compared with dabblers, respectively. These differences were associated with preferential proliferation of the subsarcolemmal subfraction, the mitochondria adjacent to the cell membrane and nearest to capillaries, relative to the intermyofibrillar subfraction. Capillary density and capillary-to-fiber ratio were positively correlated with mitochondrial volume density, with no variation in the density of oxidative fiber types across tribes. In the pectoralis, sea ducks had greater abundance of oxidative fiber types than dabblers, whereas pochards were intermediate between the two. These data suggest that skeletal muscles of sea ducks have a heightened capacity for aerobic metabolism and an enhanced ability to utilize O-2 stores in the blood and muscle while diving.",2024,10.1242/jeb.247550,227,15,NA,jeb247550,KEY WORDS: Mitochondria; Locomotion; Exercise performance; Hypoxia; Muscle ultrastructure
article,Limits to sustained energy intake. XXXIII. Thyroid hormones play important roles in milk production but do not define the heat dissipation limit in Swiss mice,"Yang, Rui and Cao, Jing and Speakman, John R. and Zhao, Zhijun",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The limits to sustained energy intake set physiological upper boundaries that affect many aspects of human and animal performance. The mechanisms underlying these limits, however, remain unclear. We exposed Swiss mice to either supplementary thyroid hormones (THs) or the inhibitor methimazole during lactation at 21 or 32.5 degrees C, and measured food intake, resting metabolic rate (RMR), milk energy output (MEO), serum THs and mammary gland gene expression of females, and litter size and mass of their offspring. Lactating females developed hyperthyroidism following exposure to supplementary THs at 21 degrees C, but they did not significantly change body temperature, asymptotic food intake, RMR or MEO, and litter and mass were unaffected. Hypothyroidism, induced by either methimazole or 32.5 degrees C exposure, significantly decreased asymptotic food intake, RMR and MEO, resulting in significantly decreased litter size and litter mass. Furthermore, gene expression of key genes in the mammary gland was significantly decreased by either methimazole or heat exposure, including gene expression of THs and prolactin receptors, and Stat5a and Stat5b. This suggests that endogenous THs are necessary to maintain sustained energy intake and MEO. Suppression of the thyroid axis seems to be an essential aspect of the mechanism by which mice at 32.5 degrees C reduce their lactation performance to avoid overheating. However, THs do not define the upper limit to sustained energy intake and MEO at peak lactation at 21 degrees C. Another, as yet unknown, factor prevents supplementary thyroxine exerting any stimulatory metabolic impacts on lactating mice at 21 degrees C.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245393,226,20,NA,jeb245393,Body temperature; Heat dissipation limitation; Lactation; Milk energy output; Resting metabolic rate; Thyroid hormones
article,Catecholamines modulate the hypoxic ventilatory response of larval zebrafish<i> (Danio</i><i> rerio)</i>,"Pan, Yihang Kevin and Julian, Tess and Garvey, Kayla and Perry, Steve F.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) in fish is an important reflex that aids O2 uptake when low environmental O2 levels constrain diffusion. In developing zebrafish (Danio rerio), the acute HVR is multiphasic, consisting of a rapid increase in ventilation frequency ( fV) during hypoxia onset, followed by a decline to a stable plateau phase above fV under normoxic conditions. In this study, we examined the potential role of catecholamines in contributing to each of these phases of the dynamic HVR in zebrafish larvae. We showed that adrenaline elicits a dose-dependent 6-adrenoreceptor (AR)-mediated increase in fV that does not require expression of 61-ARs, as the hyperventilatory response to 6-AR stimulation was unaltered in adrb1-/- mutants, generated by CRISPR/Cas9 knockout. In response to hypoxia and propranolol co-treatment, the magnitude of the rapidly occurring peak increase in fV during hypoxia onset was attenuated (112 +/- 14 breaths min-1 without propranolol to 68 +/- 17 breaths min-1 with propranolol), whereas the increased fV during the stable phase of the HVR was prevented in both wild type and adrb1-/- mutants. Thus, 61-AR is not required for the HVR and other 6-ARs, although not required for initiation of the HVR, are involved in setting the maximal increase in fV and in maintaining hyperventilation during continued hypoxia. This adrenergic modulation of the HVR may arise from centrally released catecholamines because adrenaline exposure failed to activate (based on intracellular Ca2+ levels) cranial nerves IX and X, which transmit O2 signals from the pharyngeal arch to the central nervous system.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245051,226,1,NA,jeb245051,Adrenaline; ?-Adrenoreceptor; Hypoxia; In vivo calcium imaging; Knockout

The biological role of these SCs is unclear but suggestions so far include enhanced electron transfer between complexes, decreased production of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) O-2(-) and H2O2, or enhanced structural stability. Here, we provide the first overview on the stability, composition and activity of mitochondrial SCs in representative species of several vertebrate classes to determine patterns of SC variation across endotherms and ectotherms. We found that the stability of the CICIII2 SC and the inclusion of CIV within the SC varied considerably. Specifically, when solubilized by the detergent DDM, mitochondrial CICIII2SCs were unstable in endotherms (birds and mammals) and highly stable in reptiles. Using mass-spectrometric complexomics, we confirmed that the CICIII2 is the major SC in the turtle, and that 90\% of CI is found in this highly stable SC. Interestingly, the presence of stable SCs did not prevent mitochondrial H2O2 production and was not associated with elevated respiration rates of mitochondria isolated from the examined species. Together, these data show that SC stability varies among vertebrates and is greatest in poikilothermic reptiles and weakest in endotherms. This pattern suggests an adaptive role of SCs to varying body temperature, but not necessarily a direct effect on electron transfer or in the prevention of ROS production.",2020,10.1242/jeb.223776,223,12,NA,jeb223776,Bioenergetics; Complexomics; Mass spectrometry; Mitochondria; Oxidative phosphorylation; Reactive oxygen species

However, knowledge of how these environmental factors interact to shape physiological processes and life-history traits of birds and other animals is largely lacking. By exposing adult great tits (Paws major) to two contrasting diets (saturated or unsaturated fatty acids; SFAs and UFAs, respectively) and ambient temperatures (3 degrees C versus 20 degrees C) that the birds encounter in nature, we investigated the effects of these two factors on several physiological parameters. Our results show that diet and ambient temperature interact to affect the composition of plasma fatty acids, basal metabolic rate (BMR) and oxidative stress, which are thought to affect the life-history and survival of individuals. Specifically, birds provided the SFA-rich diet had higher mass-specific BMR and oxidative stress (levels of lipid peroxidation) after exposure to low compared with high ambient temperature, whereas the opposite pattern was evident for birds with a UFA-rich diet. Surprisingly, birds on the SFA diet had higher relative levels of monounsaturated fatty acids compared with the UFA-fed birds at low ambient temperature, whereas the opposite, and expected, pattern was found at the high temperature. Although the present study focuses on the physiological implications of the dietxtemperature interaction, our results might also be important for the leading theories of ageing, which currently do not take interactions between environmental factors into account.

article,To boldly gulp: standard metabolic rate and boldness have context-dependent influences on risk-taking to breathe air in a catfish,"McKenzie, David J. and Belao, Thiago C. and Killen, Shaun S. and Rantin, F. Tadeu",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The African sharptooth catfish Clarias gariepinus has bimodal respiration, it has a suprabranchial air-breathing organ alongside substantial gills. We used automated bimodal respirometry to reveal that undisturbed juvenile catfish (N=29) breathed air continuously in normoxia, with a marked diurnal cycle. Air breathing and routine metabolic rate (RMR) increased in darkness when, in the wild, this nocturnal predator forages. Aquatic hypoxia (20\% air saturation) greatly increased overall reliance on air breathing. We investigated whether two measures of risk taking to breathe air, namely absolute rates of aerial O-2 uptake ((M) over dotO(2), air) and the percentage of RMR obtained from air (\% (M) over dotO(2), air), were influenced by individual standard metabolic rate (SMR) and boldness. In particular, whether any influence varied with resource availability (normoxia versus hypoxia) or relative fear of predation (day versus night). Individual SMR, derived from respirometry, had an overall positive influence on (M) over dotO(2), air across all contexts but a positive influence on \% (M) over dotO(2), air only in hypoxia. Thus, a pervasive effect of SMR on air breathing became most acute in hypoxia, when individuals with higher O-2 demand took proportionally more risks. Boldness was estimated as time required to resume air breathing after a fearful stimulus in daylight normoxia (T-res). Although T-res had no overall influence on (M) over dotO(2), air or \% (M) over dotO(2), air, there was a negative relationship between Tres and \% (M) over dotO(2), air in daylight, in normoxia and hypoxia. There were two Tres response groups, `bold' phenotypes with Tres below 75 min (N= 13) which, in daylight, breathed proportionally more air than `shy' phenotypes with Tres above 115 min (N= 16). Therefore, individual boldness influenced air breathing when fear of predation was high. Thus, individual energy demand and personality did not have parallel influences on the emergent tendency to take risks to obtain a resource; their influences varied in strength with context.",2015,10.1242/jeb.122903,218,23,3762-3770,NA,Bimodal respiration; Energy metabolism; Hypoxia; Personality; Respiratory partitioning; Risk-taking

The post-hatch environment was identical among the treatment groups. We found that hatching success was lowest in the 38.4 degrees C group, while post-hatch survival was lowest in the 36.2 degrees C group. Incubation temperature had sex-specific effects on offspring phenotype: incubation temperatures affected body mass (M-b) but not physiological parameters of males and conversely, the physiological parameters but not M-b of females. Specifically, males from the 38.4 degrees C group weighed significantly less than males from the 36.2 degrees C group from the nestling period to adulthood, whereas females from different incubation temperature groups did not differ in M-b.

The blood glucose level was 2.5 mmol l(-1) in Atlantic cod and 0.2 mmol l(-1) in short-horned sculpin, respectively. Oxygen consumption, lactate production and glucose utilization were measured in whole blood and related to grams of RBCs. Glucose utilization was assessed by measuring both glucose disappearance and the production of (H2O)-H-3 from {[}2-H-3]-glucose. RBCs from both species have an aerobic-based metabolism. In Atlantic cod, extracellular glucose is sufficient to provide the sum of glucosyl equivalents to support both oxidative metabolism and lactate production. In contrast, extracellular glucose can account for only 10\% of the metabolic rate in short-horned sculpin RBCs. In both species, about 70\% of glucose enters the RBCs via facilitated transport.

article,Activation of the immune system incurs energetic costs but has no effect on the thermogenic performance of house sparrows during acute cold challenge,"King, Marisa O. and Swanson, David L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Trade-offs between the immune system and other condition-dependent life-history traits (reproduction, predator avoidance and somatic growth) have been well documented in both birds and mammals. However, no studies have examined the impact of immune activation on thermoregulatory performance during acute cold exposure. Because of their high surface-area-to-volume ratios, small birds incur high energetic costs associated with thermoregulation during cold exposure. Consequently, we predicted that the immune system and the thermoregulatory system would compete for energetic resources. To test this, we immunologically challenged adult house sparrows (Passer domesticus) with 5. mg.kg(-1) of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce an acute phase response and measured both resting (RMR; minimum metabolic rate) and summit (M-sum; maximal metabolic rate during cold exposure) metabolic rates. We found that birds injected with LPS had significantly higher RMR and M-sum than birds injected with phosphate-buffered saline, indicating that LPS-treated birds were able to support the cost of both immune activation and thermoregulation under conditions eliciting maximal thermogenic performance. These results suggest that, in the absence of a pathogen, birds that experience short-term activation of the immune system have higher energetic costs during cold exposure, but immune activation does not compromise maximum thermoregulatory performance.",2013,10.1242/jeb.079574,216,11,2097-2102,NA,immune; life history; thermogenic capacity; trade-off; lipopolysaccharide

Christoffer and Deakin, Jessica E. and Voigt, Christian C. and Hedenstroem, Anders",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Cost of flight at various speeds is a crucial determinant of flight behaviour in birds. Aerodynamic models, predicting that mechanical power (P-mech) varies with flight speed in a U-shaped manner, have been used together with an energy conversion factor (efficiency) to estimate metabolic power (P-met). Despite few empirical studies, efficiency has been assumed constant across flight speeds at 23\%. Ideally, efficiency should be estimated from measurements of both P-mech and P-met in un-instrumented flight. Until recently, progress has been hampered by methodological constraints. The main aim of this study was to evaluate recently developed techniques and estimate flight efficiency across flight speeds. We used the C-13-labelled sodium bicarbonate method (NaBi) and particle image velocimetry (PIV) to measure P-met and P-mech in blackcaps flying in a wind tunnel. We also cross-validated measurements made by NaBi with quantitative magnetic resonance (QMR) body composition analysis in yellow-rumped warblers. We found that P-met estimated by NaBi was similar to 12\% lower than corresponding values estimated by QMR. P-met varied in a U-shaped manner across flight speeds in blackcaps, but the pattern was not statistically significant. P-mech could only be reliably measured for two intermediate speeds and estimated efficiency ranged between 14\% and 22\% (combining the two speeds for raw and weight/lift-specific power, with and without correction for the similar to 12\% difference between NaBi and QMR), which were close to the currently used default value. We conclude that NaBi and PIV are viable techniques, allowing researchers to address some of the outstanding questions regarding bird flight energetics.",2020,10.1242/jeb.223545,223,18,NA,jeb223545,Metabolic power input; Metabolic power output; Energy efficiency; Particle image velocimetry; C-13-Labelled sodium bicarbonate; Wind tunnel
article,Blood oxygen transport and depletion in diving emperor penguins,"Ponganis, Paul J. and Williams, Cassondra L. and Kendall-Bar, Jessica M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Oxygen store management underlies dive performance and is dependent on the slow heart rate and peripheral vasoconstriction of the dive response to control tissue blood flow and oxygen uptake. Prior research has revealed two major patterns of muscle myoglobin saturation profiles during dives of emperor penguins. In Type A profiles, myoglobin desaturated rapidly, consistent with minimal muscle blood flow and low tissue oxygen uptake. Type B profiles, with fluctuating and slower declines in myoglobin saturation, were consistent with variable tissue blood flow patterns and tissue oxygen uptake during dives. We examined arterial and venous blood oxygen profiles to evaluate blood oxygen extraction and found two primary patterns of venous hemoglobin desaturation that complemented corresponding myoglobin saturation profiles. Type A venous profiles had a hemoglobin saturation that (a) increased/plateaued for most of a dive's duration, (b) only declined during the latter stages of ascent, and (c) often became arterialized [}arterio-venous (a -v) shunting]. In Type B venous profiles, variable but progressive hemoglobin desaturation profiles were interrupted by inflections in the profile that were consistent with fluctuating tissue blood flow and oxygen uptake. End -of -dive saturation of arterial and Type A venous hemoglobin saturation profiles were not significantly different, but did differ from those of Type B venous profiles. These findings provide further support that the dive response of emperor penguins is a spectrum of cardiac and vascular components (including a -v shunting) that are dependent on the nature and demands of a given dive and even of a given segment of a dive.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246832,227,6,NA,jeb246832,Arterio-venous shunt; Arterial; Hemoglobin saturation; Vasoconstriction; Venous
article,The effects of temperature on elastic energy storage and release in a system with a dynamic mechanical advantage latch,"Mendoza, Elizabeth and Martinez, Maya and Olberding, Jeffrey P. and Azizi, Emanuel",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Changes in temperature alter muscle kinetics and in turn affect whole-organism performance. Some organisms use the elastic recoil of biological springs, structures which are far less temperature sensitive, to power thermally robust movements. For jumping frogs, the use of elastic energy in tendons is facilitated through a geometric latching mechanism that operates through dynamic changes in the mechanical advantage (MA) of the hindlimb. Despite the well-documented use of elastic energy storage, frog jumping is a locomotor behavior that is significantly affected by changes in temperature. Here, we used an in vitro muscle preparation interacting in real time with an in silico model of a legged jumper to understand how changes in temperature affect the flow of energy in a system using a MA latch. We used the plantaris longus muscle- tendon unit (MTU) to power a virtual limb with changing MA and a mass being accelerated through a real-time feedback controller. We quantified the amount of energy stored in and recovered from elastic structures and the additional contribution of direct muscle work after unlatching. We found that temperature altered the duration of the energy loading and recovery phase of the in vitro/ in silico experiments. We found that the early phase of loading was insensitive to changes in temperature. However, an increase in temperature did increase the rate of force development, which in turn allowed for increased energy storage in the second phase of loading. We also found that the contribution of direct muscle work after unlatching was substantial and increased significantly with temperature. Our results show that the thermal robustness achieved by an elastic mechanism depends strongly on the nature of the latch that mediates energy flow, and that the relative contribution of elastic and direct muscle energy likely shapes the thermal sensitivity of locomotor systems.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245805,226,19,NA,jeb245805,LaMSA; Elastic recoil; Jumping; Muscle; Temperature

Measuring the viscosity of insect fluids is challenging because of the small amount available per specimen. Using particle tracking microrheology, which is well suited to characterise the rheology of the fluid part of the haemolymph, we studied the plasma viscosity in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. In a sealed geometry, the viscosity exhibits an Arrhenius dependence with temperature, with an activation energy comparable to that previously estimated in hornworm larvae. In an open to air geometry, it increases by 4-5 orders of magnitude during evaporation. Evaporation times are temperature dependent and longer than typical insect haemolymph coagulation times. Unlike standard bulk rheology, microrheology can be applied to even smaller insects, paving the way to characterise biological fluids such as pheromones, pad secretions or cuticular layers.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245894,226,14,NA,245894,Biological fluids; Viscosity; Insect physiology
article,Mild hypoxia exposure impacts peripheral serotonin uptake and degradation in Gulf toadfish (<i>Opsanus beta</i>),"Sebastiani, John and Sabatelli, Allyson and McDonald, M. Danielle",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Plasma serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) homeostasis is maintained through the combined processes of uptake (via the 5-HT transporter SERT, and others), degradation (via monoamine oxidase, MAO) and excretion. Previous studies have shown that inhibiting SERT, which would inhibit 5-HT uptake and degradation, attenuates parts of the cardiovascular hypoxia reflex in gulf toadfish (Opsanus beta), suggesting that these 5-HT clearance processes may be important during hypoxia exposure. Therefore, the goal of this experiment was to determine the effects of mild hypoxia on 5-HT uptake and degradation in the peripheral tissues of toadfish. We hypothesized that 5-HT uptake and degradation would be upregulated during hypoxia, resulting in lower plasma 5-HT, with uptake occurring in the gill, heart, liver and kidney. Fish were exposed to normoxia (97.6\% O-2 saturation, 155.6 Torr) or 2 min, 40 min or 24 h mild hypoxia (50\% O-2 saturation, similar to 80 Torr), then injected with radiolabeled {[}H-3]5-HT before blood, urine, bile and tissues were sampled. Plasma 5-HT levels were reduced by 40\% after 40 min of hypoxia exposure and persisted through 24 h. 5-HT uptake by the gill was upregulated following 2 min of hypoxia exposure, and degradation in the gill was upregulated at 40 min and 24 h. Interestingly, there was no change in 5-HT uptake by the heart and degradation in the heart decreased by 58\% within 2 min of hypoxia exposure and by 85\% at 24 h. These results suggest that 5-HT clearance is upregulated during hypoxia and is likely driven, in part, by mechanisms within the gill and not the heart.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244064,225,13,NA,jeb244064,5-hydroxytryptamine; MAO; Monoamine oxidase; SERT; Serotonin transporter; Hypoxia

The two main hormones of the IIS network, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), are present in all vertebrates, yet little is known regarding the responsiveness of IGF2 in particular to external stimuli in non-mammalian animals. We manipulated diet (low or high quantity of food: low and high diet group, respectively) in adult green anole (Anolis carolinensis) females to test the effect of energetic state on hepatic gene expression of IGF1 and IGF2. The absolute expression of IGF2 in female green anoles was 100 times higher than that of IGF1 regardless of diet treatment, and IGF1 and IGF2 expression interacted with post-treatment body mass and treatment, as did the expression of the purported housekeeping genes glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (EEF2). The low diet group showed a negative relationship between body mass and gene expression for all genes, whereas the relationships between body mass and gene expression in the high diet group were either absent (in the case of IGF1) or positive (for all other genes). After accounting for total change in mass, the low diet group expressed IGF2, GAPDH and EEF2 at higher levels compared with individuals in the high diet group of a similar change in mass. These results illustrate that expression of IGF1 and IGF2, and of the housekeeping genes is affected by energetic status in reptiles.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242665,224,15,NA,jeb242665,IGF1; IGF2; Energetic continuum; Diet manipulation; Anolis carolinensis
article,Consequences of <i>HSF</i> knockdown on gene expression during the heat shock response in <i>Tigriopus californicus</i>,"Harada, Alice E. and Burton, Ronald S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Although the existence of a cellular heat shock response is nearly universal, its relationship to organismal thermal tolerance is not completely understood. Many of the genes involved are known to be regulated by the highly conserved heat shock transcription factor-1 (HSF-1), yet the regulatory network is not fully characterized. Here, we investigated the role of HSF-1 in gene expression following thermal stress using knockdown of HSF-1 by RNA interference in the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus. We observed some evidence for decreased transcription of heat shock protein genes following knockdown, supporting the widely acknowledged role of HSF-1 in the heat shock response. However, the majority of differentially expressed genes between the control and HSF-1 knockdown groups were upregulated, suggesting that HSF-1 normally functions to repress their expression. Differential expression observed in genes related to chitin and cuticle formation lends support to previous findings that these processes are highly regulated following heat stress. We performed a genome scan and identified a set of 396 genes associated with canonical heat shock elements. RNA-seq data did not find those genes to be more highly represented in our HSF-1 knockdown treatment, indicating that requirements for binding and interaction of HSF-1 with a given gene are not simply predicted by the presence of HSF-1 binding sites. Further study of the pathways implicated by these results and future comparisons among populations of T. californicus may help us understand the role and importance of HSF-1 in the heat shock response and, more broadly, in organismal thermal tolerance.",2020,10.1242/jeb.208611,223,3,NA,jeb208611,HSF-1; Heat stress; Arthropod; RNAi
article,Extreme blood-boosting capacity of an Antarctic fish represents an adaptation to life in a sub-zero environment,"Brijs, Jeroen and Axelsson, Michael and Rosengren, Malin and Jutfelt, Fredrik and Grans, Albin",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Blood doping, the practice of boosting the oxygen carrying capacity of blood, is an illegal strategy used by human athletes to enhance aerobic capacity and athletic performance. Interestingly, the practice of boosting blood oxygen carrying capacity is also naturally prevalent in the animal kingdom via the splenic release of stored erythrocytes. Here, we demonstrate that an Antarctic notothenioid fish, the bald notothen (Pagothenia borchgrevinki), is a master of this practice. Because of the sub-zero environment these fish inhabit, they sequester a large proportion of erythrocytes in the spleen during times of inactivity to reduce the energetic and physiological costs associated with continuously pumping highly viscous blood around the body. However, in response to metabolically demanding situations (i.e. exercise and feeding), these fish contract the spleen to eject stored erythrocytes into circulation, which boosts blood oxygen carrying capacity by up to 207\% (cf. exercise-induced increases of similar to 40-60\% in a range of other vertebrates and similar to 5-25\% in blood-doping athletes). By evaluating cardiorespiratory differences between splenectomized (unable to release erythrocytes from the spleen) and sham-operated individuals, we demonstrate the metabolic benefits (i.e. aerobic scope increase of 103\%) and the cardiovascular trade-offs (i.e. ventral aortic blood pressure and cardiac workload increase of 12\% and 30\%, respectively) associated with the splenic blood-boosting strategy. In conclusion, this strategy provides bald notothens with an extraordinary facultative aerobic scope that enables an active lifestyle in the extreme Antarctic marine environment, while minimizing the energetic and physiological costs of transporting highly viscous blood during times of reduced energetic demand.",2020,10.1242/jeb.218164,223,2,NA,jeb218164,Blood pressure; Cardiac workload; Cold adaptation; Haematocrit; Metabolism; Notothenioids

Fifty pearl oysters were grafted with magnetized nuclei to allow the rotation of the pearls to be described. Four months later, 32 of these pearl oysters were exposed to four temperatures (22, 26, 30 and 34 degrees C) for 2 weeks. Results showed that the rotation speed differed according to the movement direction: pearls with axial movement had a significantly higher rotation speed than those with random movement. Pearl growth rate was influenced by temperature, with a maximum between 26 and 30 degrees C but almost no growth at 34 degrees C. Lastly, among the nine genes implicated in the biomineralization process, only Pmarg-Pif177 expression was significantly modified by temperature. These results showed that the rotation speed of the pearls was not linked to pearl growth or to the expression profiles of biomineralizing genes targeted in this study. On the basis of our results, we consider that pearl rotation is a more complex process than formerly thought. Mechanisms involved could include a strong environmental forcing in immediate proximity to the pearl. Another implication of our findings is that, in the context of ocean warming, pearl growth and quality can be expected to decrease in pearl oysters exposed to temperatures above 30 degrees C.",2018,10.1242/jeb.186858,221,18,NA,jeb186858,Magnetometer; Rotation speed; Nacre growth; Nacre thickness; Gene expression; Pmarg-Pif177
article,The relevance of vascular adjustments to hemodynamic control in the face of temperature change in Crotalus durissus,"Castro, Samanta A. and Prado, V, Joao and Wang, Tobias and Leite, Cleo A. C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The presence of cardiac shunts in ectothermic tetrapods is thought to be consistent with active vascular modulations for proper hemodynamic support. Local control of blood flow modulates tissue perfusion and thus systemic conductance (Gsys) G sys ) is assumed to increase with body temperature (Tb) T b ) to accommodate higher aerobic demand. However, the general increase of G sys presses for a higher right-to-left (R-L) shunt, which reduces arterial oxygen concentration. In contrast, T b reduction leads to a G sys decrease and a left-to-right shunt, which purportedly increases pulmonary perfusion and plasma filtration in the respiratory area. This investigation addressed the role of compensatory vascular adjustments in the face of the metabolic alterations caused by T b change in the South American rattlesnake ( Crotalus durissus). ). Cardiovascular recordings were performed in decerebrated rattlesnake preparations at 10, 20 and 30 degrees C. The rise in T b increased metabolic demand, and correlated with an augmentation in heart rate. Although cardiac output increased, systemic stroke volume reduced while pulmonary stroke volume remained stable. Although that resulted in a proportionally higher increase in pulmonary blood flow, the R-L shunt was maintained. While the systemic compliance of large arteries was the most relevant factor in regulating arterial systemic blood pressure, peripheral conductance of pulmonary circulation was the major factor influencing the final cardiac shunt. Such dynamic adjustment of systemic compliance and pulmonary resistance for shunt modulation has not been demonstrated before and contrasts with previous knowledge on shunt control.",2024,10.1242/jeb.247724,227,15,NA,jeb247724,KEY WORDS; Compliance; Conductance; Pulmonary circulation; Rattlesnake; Reptile; Shunt

Rapid cold hardening (RCH) is a process commonly used by arthropods, including ticks, to improve survival of acute low temperature exposure. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms in ticks associated with RCH, cold shock and recovery from these stresses. In the present study, we investigated the extent to which RCH influences gene expression and metabolism during recovery from cold stress in Dermacentor variabilis, the American dog tick, using a combined transcriptomics and metabolomics approach. Following recovery from RCH, 1860 genes were differentially expressed in ticks, whereas only 99 genes responded during recovery to direct cold shock. Recovery from RCH resulted in an upregulation of various pathways associated with ion binding, transport, metabolism and cellular structures seen in the response of other arthropods to cold. The accumulation of various metabolites, including several amino acids and betaine, corresponded to transcriptional shifts in the pathways associated with these molecules, suggesting congruent metabolome and transcriptome changes. Ticks, D. variabilis and Amblyomma maculatum, receiving exogenous betaine and valine demonstrated enhanced cold tolerance, suggesting cryoprotective effects of these metabolites. Overall, many of the responses during recovery from cold shock in ticks were similar to those observed in other arthropods, but several adjustments may be distinct from the responses in other currently examined taxa.",2022,10.1242/jeb.236497,225,8,NA,jeb236497,Cold hardiness; Rapid cold hardening; Dermacentor variabilis; Amblyomma maculatum; Gene expression

To gain a better understanding of the impact of fluctuating temperatures, we investigated the effects of increased temperature variation on Phanaeus vindex dung beetles across levels of biological organization. Specifically, we hypothesized that increased temperature variation is energetically demanding. We predicted that thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate and energetic reserves would be reduced with increasing fluctuation. To test this, we examined the responses of dung beetles to constant (20 degrees C), low fluctuation (20 +/- 5 degrees C), or high fluctuation (20 +/- 12 degrees C) temperature treatments using respirometry, assessment of energetic reserves and HPLC-MS-based metabolomics. We found no significant differences in metabolic rate or energetic reserves, suggesting increased fluctuations were not energetically demanding. To understand why there was no effect of increased amplitude of temperature fluctuation on energetics, we assembled and annotated a de novo transcriptome, finding non-overlapping transcriptomic and metabolomic responses of beetles exposed to different fluctuations. We found that 58 metabolites increased in abundance in both fluctuation treatments, but 15 only did so in response to high-amplitude fluctuations. We found that 120 transcripts were significantly upregulated following acclimation to any fluctuation, but 174 were upregulated only in beetles from the high-amplitude fluctuation treatment. Several differentially expressed transcripts were associated with post-translational modifications to histones that support a more open chromatin structure. Our results demonstrate that acclimation to different temperature fluctuations is distinct and may be supported by increasing transcriptional plasticity. Our results indicate for the first time that histone modifications may underlie rapid acclimation to temperature variation.",2020,10.1242/jeb.233239,223,23,NA,jeb233239,Coleoptera; Histones; Insects; Metabolism; Temperature variation; Thermal physiology

It has been estimated that pigs lost UCP1 similar to 20 million years ago (MYA), dictating cold intolerance among piglets. Our current understanding of the root causes of UCP1 loss are, however, incomplete. Thus, examination of additional species can shed light on these fundamental evolutionary questions. Here, we investigated UCP1 in the Chacoan peccary (Catagonus wagneri), a member of the Tayassuid lineage that diverged from pigs during the late Eocene-mid Oligocene. Exons 1 and 2 have been deleted in peccary UCP1 and the remaining exons display additional inactivating mutations. A common nonsense mutation in exon 6 revealed that UCP1 was pseudogenized in a shared ancestor of pigs and peccaries. Our selection pressure analyses indicate that the inactivation occurred 36.2-44.3 MYA during the mid-late Eocene, which is much earlier than previously thought. Importantly, pseudogenized UCP1 provides the molecular rationale for cold sensitivity and current tropical biogeography of extant peccaries.",2020,10.1242/jeb.223974,223,15,NA,jeb223974,Uncoupling protein 1; Endothermy; Evolution; Brown adipose tissue

Over the past 20 years, individual growth rates of beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) have declined, which may be a response to climate change; however, the scarcity of physiological data makes it difficult to gauge the adaptive capacity and resilience of the species. We explored relationships between body condition and physiological parameters pertaining to oxygen (O-2) storage capacity in 77 beluga whales in the eastern Beaufort Sea. Muscle myoglobin concentrations averaged 77.9 mg g(-1), one of the highest values reported among mammals. Importantly, blood haematocrit, haemoglobin and muscle myoglobin concentrations correlated positively to indices of body condition, including maximum half-girth to length ratios. Thus, a whale with the lowest body condition index would have similar to 27\% lower blood (26.0 versus 35.7 ml kg(-1)) and 12\% lower muscle (15.6 versus 17.7 ml kg(-1)) O-2 stores than a whale of equivalent mass with the highest body condition index; with the conservative assumption that underwater O-2 consumption rates are unaffected by body condition, this equates to a >3 min difference in maximal aerobic dive time between the two extremes (14.3 versus 17.4 min). Consequently, environmental changes that negatively impact body condition may hinder the ability of whales to reach preferred prey sources, evade predators and escape ice entrapments. The relationship between body condition and O(2 )storage capacity may represent a vicious cycle, in which environmental changes resulting in decreased body condition impair foraging, leading to further reductions in condition through diminished prey acquisition and/or increased foraging efforts.",2019,10.1242/jeb.191916,222,11,NA,jeb191916,Arctic climate change; Cetacean; Aerobic dive time; Haemoglobin; Marine mammals; Myoglobin

article,Respiratory mechanics and morphology of Tibetan and Andean high-altitude geese with divergent life histories,"York, Julia M. and Scadeng, Miriam and McCracken, Kevin G. and Milsom, William K.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"High-altitude bar-headed geese (Anser indicus) and Andean geese (Chloephaga melanoptera) have been shown to preferentially increase tidal volume over breathing frequency when increasing ventilation during exposure to hypoxia. Increasing tidal volume is a more effective breathing strategy but is also thought to be more mechanically and metabolically expensive. We asked whether there might be differences in the mechanics or morphology of the respiratory systems of high-altitude transient bar-headed geese and high-altitude resident Andean geese that could minimize the cost of breathing more deeply. We compared these two species with a low-altitude migratory species, the barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis). We ventilated anesthetized birds to measure mechanical properties of the respiratory system and used CT scans to quantify respiratory morphology. We found that the respiratory system of Andean geese was disproportionately larger than that of the other two species, allowing use of a deeper breathing strategy for the same energetic cost. The relative size of the respiratory system, especially the caudal air sacs, of bar-headed geese was also larger than that of barnacle geese. However, when normalized to respiratory system size, the mechanical cost of breathing did not differ significantly among these three species, indicating that deeper breathing is enabled by morphological but not mechanical differences between species. The metabolic cost of breathing was estimated to be < 1\% of basal metabolic rate at rest in normoxia. Because of differences in the magnitude of the ventilatory response, the cost of breathing was estimated to increase 7-to 10-fold in bar-headed and barnacle geese in severe hypoxia, but less than 1-fold in Andean geese exposed to the same low atmospheric P-O2.",2018,10.1242/jeb.170738,221,1,NA,jeb170738,Air sac morphology; Andean goose; Bar-headed goose; Barnacle goose; Chloephaga melanoptera; Anser indicus; Branta leucopsis; Compliance; High-altitude hypoxia; Respiratory mechanics; Work of breathing
article,Individual variation in metabolic reaction norms over ambient temperature causes low correlation between basal and standard metabolic rate,"Briga, Michael and Verhulst, Simon",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is often assumed to be indicative of the energy turnover at ambient temperatures (T-a) below the thermoneutral zone (SMR), but this assumption has remained largely untested. Using a new statistical approach, we quantified the consistency in nocturnal metabolic rate across a temperature range in zebra finches (N=3213 measurements on 407 individuals) living permanently in eight outdoor aviaries. Foraging conditions were either benign or harsh, and body mass and mass-adjusted BMR (BMRm) and SMR (SMRm) were lower in individuals living in a harsh foraging environment. The correlation between SMRm at different T-a was high (r=0.91), independent of foraging environment, showing that individuals are consistently ranked according to their SMRm. However, the correlations between BMRm and SMRm were always lower (average: r=0.29; range: 0<r<0.50), in particular in the benign foraging environment. Variation in metabolic response to lower T-a at least in part reflected differential body temperature (T-b) regulation: early morning T-b was lower at low T-a, and more so in individuals with a weaker metabolic response to lower T-a. Our findings have implications for the use of BMR in the estimation of time-energy budgets and comparative analyses: we suggest that the use of metabolic rates at ecologically relevant T-a, such as the easily tractable SMR, will be more informative than the use of BMR as a proxy for energy turnover.",2017,10.1242/jeb.160069,220,18,3280-3289,NA,BMR; SMR; Repeatability; Foraging; Daily energy expenditure; Body temperature
article,Energetic cost determines voluntary movement speed only in familiar environments,"Seebacher, Frank and Borg, Jason and Schlotfeldt, Kathryn and Yan, Zhongning",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Locomotor performance is closely related to fitness. However, in many ecological contexts, animals do not move at their maximal locomotor capacity, but adopt a voluntary speed that is lower than maximal. It is important to understand the mechanisms that underlie voluntary speed, because these determine movement patterns of animals across natural environments. We show that voluntary speed is a stable trait in zebrafish (Danio rerio), but there were pronounced differences between individuals in maximal sustained speed, voluntary speed and metabolic cost of locomotion. We accept the hypothesis that voluntary speed scales positively with maximal sustained swimming performance (U-crit), but only in unfamiliar environments (1st minute in an open-field arena versus 10th minute) at high temperature (30 degrees C). There was no significant effect of metabolic scope on U-crit. Contrary to expectation, we rejected the hypothesis that voluntary speed decreases with increasing metabolic cost of movement, except in familiar spatial (after 10 min of exploration) and thermal (24 degrees C but not 18 or 30 degrees C) environments. The implications of these data are that the energetic costs of exploration and dispersal in novel environments are higher than those for movement within familiar home ranges.",2016,10.1242/jeb.136689,219,11,1625-1631,NA,Metabolic scope; Locomotor performance; Calcium cycling; Muscle; Cost of transport

However, feedback control during maturational growth or adaptive remodelling of local muscle capillarisation is likely to be more complex than simply matching O-2 supply and demand in response to integrated tissue function. We tested the hypothesis that the maximal oxygen consumption (M-O2,M-max) supported by a capillary is relatively constant, and independent of the volume of tissue supplied (capillary domain). We demonstrate that local M-O2,M-max assessed by succinate dehydrogenase histochemistry: (1) varied more than 100-fold between individual capillaries and (2) was positively correlated to capillary domain area in both human vastus lateralis (R=0.750, P<0.001) and soleus (R=0.697, P<0.001) muscles. This suggests that, in contrast to common assumptions, capillarisation is not primarily dictated by local oxidative capacity, but rather by factors such as fibre size, or consequences of differences in fibre size such as substrate delivery and metabolite removal.",2015,10.1242/jeb.126664,218,21,3377-3380,NA,Succinate dehydrogenase; Capillarisation; Muscle; Capillary domains
article,Insect herbivores can choose microclimates to achieve nutritional homeostasis,"Clissold, Fiona J. and Coggan, Nicole and Simpson, Stephen J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The interaction between temperature and diet quality can affect the life history of ectotherms. The rate and ratio at which protein and carbohydrate are obtained from food are important aspects of diet quality, and insects have a well-developed capacity to adjust their feeding behaviour and post-ingestive physiology to regulate intake and allocation of these nutrients. If the supply of protein and carbohydrate varies with temperature (e.g. via effects on intake, digestion or metabolism), then herbivorous insects can use thermoregulatory behaviour to help achieve nutritional homeostasis. When fed the host grass Triticum aestivum, Locusta migratoria nymphs absorbed and allocated protein and carbohydrate to growth with the same efficiency at 38 degrees C as at 32 degrees C; however, at the higher temperature, they ingested more food. In contrast, when feeding on Themeda triandra, the nymphs absorbed carbohydrate with higher efficiency at 32 degrees C, and protein at 38 degrees C. Using synthetic diets, we induced either a protein or a carbohydrate deficiency in experimental insects and showed that locusts placed in a thermal gradient following a meal of T. triandra selected 32 degrees C when deprived of carbohydrate, and 38 degrees C when deprived of protein. This capacity to use thermoregulatory behaviour to redress an imposed nutritional imbalance improved with experience of feeding on T. triandra. As predicted, locusts fed T. aestivum always chose higher temperatures, irrespective of nutritional state. Our results have consequences for understanding host-plant choice by herbivores and interpreting the effects of changed environmental temperatures and microclimate on animal-plant interactions.",2013,10.1242/jeb.078782,216,11,2089-2096,NA,nutrient balance; dynamic thermoregulatory behaviour; behavioural plasticity; learning

In this study, we assessed the energetic demands of long-distance migration in a multigenerational ectothermic migrant, the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus). We tested the hypotheses that temperaturedependent physiological processes reduce energy reserves faster during migration than previously estimated, and that increasing climatic temperatures resulting from the climate crisis will intensify baseline daily energy expenditure. First, we reared monarchs under laboratory conditions to assess energy and mass conversion from fifth instar to adult stages, as a baseline for migratory adult mass and ontogenetic shifts in metabolic rate from larvae to adult. Then, using historical tag-recapture data, we estimated the movement propensity and migratory pace of autumn migrants using computer simulations and subsequently calculated energy expenditure. Finally, we estimated the energy use of monarchs based on these tag- recapture data and used this information to estimate daily energy expenditure over a 57 year period. We found support for our two hypotheses, noting that incorporating standard metabolic rate into estimates of migratory energy expenditure shows higher energy demand and that daily energy expenditure has been gradually increasing over time since 1961. Our study shows the deleterious energetic consequences under current climate change trajectories and highlights the importance of incorporating energetic estimates for understanding migration by small, ectothermic migrants.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245296,226,21,NA,jeb245296,Energetics; Lepidoptera; Metabolism; Migration; Simulation; Tag-recapture

J. and Cox, Val M. and Hurst, Josh",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The present study examined whether high-fat diet (HFD) consumption for 20 weeks had a temperature-specific effect on the contractile performance and regional thermal sensitivity of isolated mouse soleus and diaphragm muscle. Four-week-old female CD-1 micewere randomly selected to consume either a standard laboratory diet or a standard laboratory diet in conjunction with a HFD for 20 weeks. Peripheral soleus and core diaphragm were isolated from each animal and maximal isometric force and work loop power were assessed at 20, 28, 35 and 40 degrees C. Increasing temperature to 35 degrees C resulted in greater isometric stress, lower activation and relaxation time, and higher work loop power in both muscles. A further increase in temperature to 40 degrees C did not affect isometric force but increased work loop power output of the soleus. Conversely, isometric force of the diaphragm was reduced and work loop power maintained when temperature was increased to 40 degrees C. HFD consumption resulted in greater isometric force and absolute work loop power of the soleus and reduced isometric stress of the diaphragm, effects that were less apparent at lower temperatures. When the relationship between temperature and each measure of contractile function was examined by linear regression, there was no difference in slope between the control or HFD groups for either the soleus or diaphragm. These results indicate that whilst contractile function initially increases with temperature, the temperature to elicit maximal performance is muscle and contractile mode specific. Furthermore, HFD effects on contractile function are temperature specific, but HFD does not influence the relationship between temperature and performance.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244178,225,9,NA,jeb244178,Obesity; Work loop; Isometric; Force; Power
article,The temperature sensitivity of memory formation and persistence is altered by cold acclimation in a pond snail,"Fernell, Maria and Rivi, Veronica and Batabyal, Anuradha and Lukowiak, Ken",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"There are reports on the inability of inbred, laboratory-reared Lymnaea stagnalis to perform feeding and aerial respiration in the cold. It has also been suggested that laboratory-bred snails have an inability to perform aerial respiration in winter months in the laboratory. Here, we used an inbred, laboratory-reared strain of Lymnaea (the S-strain) to demonstrate that the snails are capable of performing those behaviours in a cold (4 degrees C) environment after a 2 day acclimation period. In addition, the inbred snails were able to perform aerial respiration during winter months at room temperature (20 degrees C) in the laboratory. The persistence of long-term memory (LTM) was extended for at least 4 weeks by placing S-strain snails into a 4 degrees C environment following training. Typically, the cold block (CB) procedure (1 h at 4 degrees C) immediately after a training session blocks LTM formation in the S-strain but not in a freshly collected strain. Four weeks at 4 degrees C transformed the S-strain phenotype into one resisting the CB procedure. Thus, with a 4 week cold spell snails gain a resistance to the CB procedure, and that would explain why freshly collected snails are resistant to the procedure. However, we found that F1 progeny of a freshly collected strain reared in the laboratory were resistant to the CB procedure. This suggests that an unknown selection resulted in the Sstrain being susceptible to the CB procedure.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242513,224,11,NA,jeb242513,Lymnaea; Strain transformation; Cold block; Memory formation; LTM persistence

We used a common garden experiment to determine whether offspring with varying parental origins display adaptive phenotypic variation related to different thermal conditions experienced in parental environments. We compared burst swimming performance and critical thermal limits of African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) tadpoles bred from adults captured at high (similar to 2000 m above sea level) and low (similar to 5 m above sea level) altitudes. Maternal origin significantly affected swimming performance. Optimal swimming performance temperature (T-opt) had a >9 degrees C difference between tadpoles with low altitude maternal origins (pure- and cross-bred, 35.0 degrees C) and high-altitude maternal origins (pure-bred, 25.5 degrees C; cross-bred, 25.9 degrees C). Parental origin significantly affected critical thermal (CT) limits. Pure-bred tadpoles with low-altitude parental origins had higher CTmax (37.8 +/- 0.8 degrees C) than pure-bred tadpoles with high-altitude parental origins and all crossbred tadpoles (37.0 +/- 0.8 and 37.1 +/- 0.8 degrees C). Pure-bred tadpoles with low-altitude parental origins and all cross-bred tadpoles had higher CTmin (4.2 +/- 0.7 and 4.2 +/- 0.7 degrees C) than pure-bred tadpoles with high-altitude parental origins (2.5 +/- 0.6 degrees C). Our study shows that the varying thermal physiological traits of Xenopus laevis tadpoles are the result of adaptive responses to their parental thermal environments. This study is one of few demonstrating potential intraspecific evolution of critical thermal limits in a vertebrate species. Multi-generation common garden experiments and genetic analyses would be required to further tease apart the relative contribution of plastic and genetic effects to the adaptive phenotypic variation observed in these tadpoles.",2021,10.1242/jeb.233031,224,7,NA,jeb233031,Anuran; Locomotor performance; Plasticity; Thermal adaptation; Thermal performance curve
article,Copepod feeding strategy determines response to seawater viscosity: videography study of two calanoid copepod species,"Tyrell, Abigail S. and Jiang, Houshuo and Fisher, Nicholas S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Calanoid copepods, depending on feeding strategy, have different behavioral and biological controls on their movements, thereby responding differently to environmental conditions such as changes in seawater viscosity. To understand how copepod responses to environmental conditions are mediated through physical, physiological and/or behavioral pathways, we used high-speed microvideography to compare two copepod species, Acartia hudsonica and Parvocalanus crassirostris, under different temperature, viscosity and dietary conditions. Acadia hudsonica exhibited `sink and wait' feeding behavior and typically responded to changes in seawater viscosity; increased seawater viscosity reduced particle-capture behavior and decreased the size of the feeding current. In contrast, P. crassirosttis continuously swam and did not show any behavioral or physical responses to changes in viscosity. Both species showed a physiological response to temperature, with reduced appendage beating frequency at cold temperatures, but this did not generally translate into effects on swimming speed, feeding flux or active time. Both copepod species swam slower when feeding on diatom rather than dinoflagellate prey, showing that prey type mediates copepod behavior. These results differentiate species-specific behaviors and responses to environmental conditions, which may lead to better understanding of niche separation and latitudinal patterns in copepod feeding and movement strategies.",2020,10.1242/jeb.220830,223,13,NA,jeb220830,Temperature; Zooplankton; Temperature-viscosity response; Feeding mechanism; Micro-particle tracking velocimetry; mu PTV

This is partly accomplished by an anoxia-mediated increase in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release, which activates GABA receptors and mediates spike arrest in turtle neurons via shunting inhibition. Extracellular taurine levels also increase during anoxia; why this occurs is unknown but it is speculated that glycine and/or GABA(A/B) receptors are involved. Given the general importance of inhibitory neurotransmission in the anoxia-tolerant painted turtle brain, we investigated the function of taurine as an inhibitory neuromodulator in turtle pyramidal neurons. Using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiological methods to record from neurons within a cortical brain sheet, we found that taurine depolarized membrane potential by similar to 8 mV, increased whole-cell conductance similar to 2-fold, and induced an inward current that possessed characteristics similar to GABA- and glycine-evoked currents. These effects were mitigated following glycine receptor antagonism with strychnine and GABA(A) receptor antagonism with gabazine, bicuculine or picrotoxin, but were unchanged following GABA(B) or glutamatergic receptor inhibition. These data indicate that a high concentration of taurine in vitro mediates its effects through both glycine and GABA(A) receptors, and suggests that taurine, in addition to GABA, inhibits neuronal activity during anoxia in the turtle cortex.",2018,10.1242/jeb.181529,221,21,NA,jeb181529,Taurine; GABA; Glycine; Pyramidal neurons; Whole-cell patch-clamp; Anoxia tolerance; Spike arrest; Chrysemys picta bellii

Fish were exposed to a stepwise decrease in air saturation (100\%, 20\%, 10\% and 5\%) for 2 h at each level, and sampled throughout the experiment. A flooding dose technique using a stable isotope allowed us to observe an overall decrease in protein synthesis during hypoxia in liver, muscle, gill and heart. We estimate that this decrease in rates of protein synthesis accounts for a 20 to 36\% decrease in metabolic rate, which would enable oscars to maintain stable levels of ATP and prolong survival. It was also determined for the first time in fish that a decrease in protein synthesis during hypoxia is likely controlled by signaling molecules (4EBP1 and eIF2-alpha), and not simply due to a lack of ATP. We could not detect any effects of hypoxia on protein degradation as the levels of NH4 excretion, indicators of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, and enzymatic activities of lysosomal and non-lysosomal proteolytic enzymes were maintained throughout the experiment.",2018,10.1242/jeb.167601,221,2,NA,jeb167601,Hypoxia; Protein synthesis; Protein degradation; Oscars; Signaling pathways

We previously documented that chronic embryonic hypoxia has a lasting impact on the metabolic response to feeding in juvenile snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina). Turtles exposed to hypoxia as embryos {[}10\% O-2 (H10)] exhibited an earlier and increased peak postprandial oxygen consumption rate, compared with control turtles [}21\% O-2 (N21)]. In the current study, we measured central blood flow patterns to determine whether the elevated postprandial metabolic response in H10 turtles is linked to lasting impacts on convective transport. Five years after hatching, turtles were instrumented to quantify systemic (Q(sys)) and pulmonary (Q(pul)) blood flows and heart rate (f(H)) before and after a similar to 5\% body mass meal. In adult N21 and H10 turtles, f(H) was increased significantly by feeding. Although total stroke volume (V-S, (tot)) remained at fasted values, this tachycardia contributed to an elevation in total cardiac output (Q(tot)). However, there was a postprandial reduction in a net left-right (L-R) shunt in N21 snapping turtles only. Relative to N21 turtles, H10 animals exhibited higher Q(sys) due to increased blood flow through the right systemic outflow vessels of the heart. This effect of hypoxic embryonic development, reducing a net L-R cardiac shunt, may support the increased postprandial metabolic rate we previously reported in H10 turtles, and is further demonstration of adult reptile cardiovascular physiology being programmed by embryonic hypoxia.",2017,10.1242/jeb.160549,220,14,2589-2597,NA,Cardiac output; Cardiac shunting; Developmental programming; Chronic hypoxia; Phenotypic plasticity; Reptile
article,Shiver me titin! Elucidating titin's role in shivering thermogenesis,"Taylor-Burt, Kari R. and Monroy, Jenna and Pace, Cinnamon and Lindstedt, Stan and Nishikawa, Kiisa C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Shivering frequency scales predictably with body mass and is 10 times higher in a mouse than a moose. The link between shivering frequency and body mass may lie in the tuning of muscle elastic properties. Titin functions as a muscle `spring', so shivering frequency may be linked to titin's structure. The muscular dystrophy with myositis (mdm) mouse is characterized by a deletion in titin's N2A region. Mice that are homozygous for the mdm mutation have a lower body mass, stiffer gait and reduced lifespan compared with their wild-type and heterozygous siblings. We characterized thermoregulation in these mice by measuring metabolic rate and tremor frequency during shivering. Mutants were heterothermic at ambient temperatures of 20-37 degrees C while wild-type and heterozygous mice were homeothermic. Metabolic rate increased at smaller temperature differentials (i.e. the difference between body and ambient temperatures) in mutants than in non-mutants. The difference between observed tremor frequencies and shivering frequencies predicted by body mass was significantly larger for mutant mice than for wild-type or heterozygous mice, even after accounting for differences in body temperature. Together, the heterothermy in mutants, the increase in metabolic rate at low temperature differentials and the decreased tremor frequency demonstrate the thermoregulatory challenges faced by mice with the mdm mutation. Oscillatory frequency is proportional to the square root of stiffness, and we observed that mutants had lower active muscle stiffness in vitro. The lower tremor frequencies in mutants are consistent with reduced active muscle stiffness and suggest that titin affects the tuning of shivering frequency.",2015,10.1242/jeb.111849,218,5,694+,NA,Muscle; Stiffness; Thermoregulation; mdm; Mouse

The ease of manipulation of the Caenorhabditis model system also has encouraged its application to comparative analyses of phenotypic evolution, particularly contrasts of the classic model C. elegans with C. briggsae. And yet few studies have investigated natural genetic variation in behaviour in any nematode. Here we measure thermotaxis and isothermal tracking behaviour in genetically distinct strains of C. briggsae, further motivated by the latitudinal differentiation in C. briggsae that is associated with temperature-dependent fitness differences in this species. We demonstrate that C. briggsae performs thermotaxis and isothermal tracking largely similar to that of C. elegans, with a tendency to prefer its rearing temperature. Comparisons of these behaviours among strains reveal substantial heritable natural variation within each species that corresponds to three general patterns of behavioural response. However, intraspecific genetic differences in thermal behaviour often exceed interspecific differences. These patterns of temperature-dependent behaviour motivate further development of C. briggsae as a model system for dissecting the genetic underpinnings of complex behavioural traits.",2013,10.1242/jeb.075408,216,5,850-858,NA,Caenorhabditis elegans; behaviour; genetic variation; temperature; thermotaxis
article,Migratory songbirds exhibit seasonal modulation of the oxygen cascade,"Ivy, Catherine M. and Guglielmo, Christopher G.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Migratory flight requires birds to maintain intensive aerobic exercise for many hours or days. Maintaining O-2 supply to flight muscles is therefore important during migration, especially since migratory songbirds have been documented flying at altitudes greater than 5000 m above sea level, where O-2 is limited. Whether songbirds exhibit seasonal plasticity of the O-2 cascade to maintain O-2 uptake and transport during migratory flight is not well understood. We investigated changes in the hypoxic ventilatory response, haematology and pectoralis ( flight) muscle phenotype of 6 songbird species from3 families during migratory and non-migratory conditions. Songbirds were captured during southbound migration in southern Ontario, Canada. Half of the birds were assessed during migration, and the rest were transitioned onto a winter photoperiod to induce a non-migratory phenotype and measured. All species exhibited seasonal plasticity at various stages along the O-2 cascade, but not all species exhibited the same responses. Songbirds tended to be more hypoxia tolerant during migration, withstanding 5 kPa O-2 and breathed more effectively through slower, deeper breaths. Warblers had a stronger haemoglobin-O-2 affinity during autumn migration (decrease of similar to 4.7 Torr), while the opposite was observed in thrushes (increase of similar to 2.6 Torr). In the flight muscle there was an similar to 1.2-fold increase in the abundance of muscle fibres with smaller fibre transverse areas during autumn migration, but no changes in capillary:fibre ratio. These adjustments would enhance O-2 uptake and transport to the flight muscle.

article,Temperature effects on metabolic scaling of a keystone freshwater crustacean depend on fish-predation regime,"Glazier, Douglas S. and Gring, Jeffrey P. and Holsopple, Jacob R. and Gjoni, Vojsava",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"According to the metabolic theory of ecology, metabolic rate, an important indicator of the pace of life, varies with body mass and temperature as a result of internal physical constrains. However, various ecological factors may also affect metabolic rate and its scaling with body mass. Although reports of such effects on metabolic scaling usually focus on single factors, the possiblity of significant interactive effects between multiple factors requries further study. In this study, we show that the effect of temperature on the ontogenetic scaling of resting metabolic rate of the freshwater amphipod Gammams minus depends critically on habitat differences in predation regime. Increasing temperature tends to cause decreases in the metabolic scaling exponent (slope) in population samples from springs with fish predators, but increases in population samples from springs without fish. Accordingly, the temperature sensitivity of metabolic rate is not only size-specific, but also its relationship to body size shifts dramatically in response to fish predators. We hypothesize that the dampened effect of temperature on the metabolic rate of large adults in springs with fish, and of small juveniles in springs without fish are adaptive evolutionary responses to differences in the relative mortality risk of adults and juveniles in springs with versus without fish predators. Our results demonstrate a complex interaction among metabolic rate, body mass, temperature and predation regime. The intraspecific scaling of metabolic rate with body mass and temperature is not merely the result of physical constraints related to internal body design and biochemical kinetics, but rather is ecologically sensitive and evolutionarily malleable.",2020,10.1242/jeb.232322,223,21,NA,jeb232322,Allometry; Freshwater springs; Gammarus minus; Metabolism; Predation; Temperature
article,Bilateral auditory processing studied by selective cold-deactivation of cricket hearing organs,"Zhang, Xinyang and Hedwig, Berthold",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"We studied bilateral processing in the auditory ON neurons of crickets using reversible cold-deactivation of the hearing organs by means of Peltier elements. Intracellular recordings of the neurons' activity in response to acoustic stimuli were obtained, while either the ipsilateral or the contralateral hearing organ was cold-deactivated. Afferent activity was abolished at a temperature of approximately 10 degrees C. In ON1, contralateral inhibition had no effect on the latency and amplitude of the phasic onset activity, it enhanced the decline of the onset activity and it decreased the subsequent tonic spiking response to acoustic stimuli. As a consequence, the phasic onset activity became more salient and reciprocal inhibition may support the detection of sound pulses. Contralateral inhibition had a significant impact on the tonic ON1 response, in line with its presumed function to enhance the bilateral auditory contrast. In ON2, experiments confirmed a bilateral excitatory input, with the ipsilateral input dominating the response, and no inhibitory coupling between the ON2 neurons.",2019,10.1242/jeb.210799,222,21,NA,jeb210799,Peltier element; Chill coma; Reciprocal inhibition; Omega neurons

In this study, we investigated the direct effects of temperature on reproductive timing in house finches (Haemorhous mexicanus), which have a range and breeding diet not well represented in previous studies of temperature and reproductive timing. We conducted experiments with captive male house finches in which temperature was elevated within realistic ranges and the effects on the timing of preparations for reproduction, as well as on the termination of reproduction and the onset of prebasic feather molt, were examined. We found no adjustments in the timing of reproductive preparations of males in direct response to temperature. However, elevated temperature did advance the breeding-molt transition.

article,"A new cue for torpor induction: charcoal, ash and smoke","Stawski, Clare and Nowack, Julia and Koertner, Gerhard and Geiser, Fritz",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Recent work has shown that the use of torpor for energy conservation increases after forest fires in heterothermic mammals, probably in response to the reduction of food. However, the specific environmental cues for this increased torpor expression remain unknown. It is possible that smoke and the novel substrate of charcoal and ash act as signals for an impending period of starvation requiring torpor. We therefore tested the hypothesis that the combined cues of smoke, a charcoal/ash substrate and food shortage will enhance torpor expression in a small forest-dwelling marsupial, the yellowfooted antechinus (Antechinus flavipes), because like other animals that live in fire-prone habitats they must effectively respond to fires to ensure survival. Activity and body temperature patterns of individuals in outdoor aviaries were measured under natural environmental conditions. All individuals were strictly nocturnal, but diurnal activity was observed shortly after smoke exposure. Overall, torpor in females was longer and deeper than that in males. Interestingly, while both males and females increased daily torpor duration during food restriction by >2-fold as anticipated, a combination of food restriction and smoke exposure on a charcoal/ash substrate further increased daily torpor duration by >2-fold in both sexes. These data show that this combination of cues for torpor induction is stronger than food shortage on its own. Our study provides significant new information on how a small forest-dwelling mammal responds to fire cues during and immediately after a fire and identifies a new, not previously recognised, regulatory mechanism for thermal biology in mammals.",2017,10.1242/jeb.146548,220,2,220-226,NA,Activity; Behaviour; Fire; Heterothermy; Mammal; Physiology

article,Mass and volume growth of an insect tracheal system within a single instar,"Helm, Bryan R. and Davidowitz, Goggy",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Organisms must accommodate oxygen delivery to developing tissues as body mass increases during growth. In insects, the growth of the respiratory system has been assumed to occur only during molts, whereas body mass and volume increase during the larval stages between molts. This decouples whole-body growth from the growth of the oxygen supply system. This assumption is derived from the observation that the insect respiratory system is an invagination of the exoskeleton, which must be shed during molts for continued growth to occur.

article,Echolocation click parameters and biosonar behaviour of the dwarf sperm whale (<i>Kogia</i> <i>sima</i>),"Malinka, Chloe E. and Tonnesen, Pernille and Dunn, Charlotte A. and Claridge, Diane E. and Gridley, Tess and Elwen, Simon H. and Madsen, Peter Teglberg",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Dwarf sperm whales (Kogia sima) are small toothed whales that produce narrow-band high-frequency (NBHF) echolocation clicks. Such NBHF clicks, subject to high levels of acoustic absorption, are usually produced by small, shallow-diving odontocetes, such as porpoises, in keeping with their short-range echolocation and fast click rates. Here, we sought to address the problem of how the little-studied and deep-diving Kogia can hunt with NBHF clicks in the deep sea. Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that Kogia produce NBHF clicks with longer inter-click intervals (ICIs), higher directionality and higher source levels (SLs) compared with other NBHF species. We did this by deploying an autonomous deep-water vertical hydrophone array in the Bahamas, where no other NBHF species are present, and by taking opportunistic recordings of a close-range Kogia sima in a South African harbour. Parameters from on-axis clicks (n=46) in the deep revealed very narrow-band clicks (root mean squared bandwidth, BWRMS, of 3 +/- 1 kHz), with SLs of up to 197 dB re. 1 mu Pa peak-to-peak (mu Papp) at 1 m, and a half-power beamwidth of 8.8 deg. Their ICIs (mode of 245 ms) were much longer than those of porpoises (<100 ms), suggesting an inspection range that is longer than detection ranges of single prey, perhaps to facilitate auditory streaming of a complex echo scene. On-axis clicks in the shallow harbour (n=870) had ICIs and SLs in keeping with source parameters of other NBHF cetaceans. Thus, in the deep, dwarf sperm whales use a directional, but short-range echolocation system with moderate SLs, suggesting a reliable mesopelagic prey habitat.",2021,10.1242/jeb.240689,224,6,NA,jeb240689,Beam pattern; Bioacoustics; Hydrophone array; Narrow-band high-frequency; Passive acoustic monitoring; Source parameters

To overwinter, insects have adapted a range of strategies to become truly cold hardy. However, although the mechanisms underlying the ability to avoid or tolerate freezing have been well studied, little attention has been given to the challenge of maintaining ion homeostasis at frigid temperatures in these species, despite this limiting cold tolerance for insects susceptible to mild chilling. Here, we investigated how prolonged exposure to temperatures just above the supercooling point affects ion balance in freeze-avoidant mountain pine beetle ( Dendroctonus ponderosae ) larvae in autumn, mid-winter and spring, and related it to organismal recovery times and survival. Hemolymph ion balance was gradually disrupted during the first day of exposure, characterized by hyperkalemia and hyponatremia, after which a plateau was reached and maintained for the rest of the 7-day experiment. The degree of ionoregulatory collapse correlated strongly with recovery times, which followed a similar asymptotical progression. Mortality increased slightly during extensive cold exposures, where hemolymph K + concentration was highest, and a sigmoidal relationship was found between survival and hyperkalemia. Thus, the cold tolerance of the freezeavoiding larvae of D. ponderosae appears limited by the ability to prevent ionoregulatory collapse in a manner similar to that of chill-susceptible insects, albeit at much lower temperatures. Based on these results, we propose that a prerequisite for the evolution of insect freeze avoidance may be a convergent or ancestral ability to maintain ion homeostasis during extreme cold stress.",2024,10.1242/jeb.247498,227,9,NA,jeb247498,Cold tolerance; Chill coma recovery; Freeze avoidant; Cold hardiness; Osmoregulation; Cold injury

However, the effect of body mass on mitochondrial energy transduction is still poorly understood and has mainly been described in mammals. Using 13 species of birds ranging from 15 g (finches) to 160 kg (ostrich), we report here that the mitochondrial production of ATP, and the corresponding oxygen consumption, are negatively dependent on body mass in skeletal muscles but not in the heart.

Here, we examined the cardiovascular responses to progressive hypoxia in four high-altitude Andean duck species compared with four related low-altitude populations in North America, tested at their native altitude. Ducks were exposed to stepwise decreases in inspired partial pressure of O-2 while we monitored heart rate, O-2 consumption rate, blood O-2 saturation, haematocrit (Hct) and blood haemoglobin (Hb) concentration. We calculated O-2 pulse (the product of stroke volume and the arterial-venous O-2 content difference), blood O-2 concentration and heart rate variability. Regardless of altitude, all eight populations maintained O-2 consumption rate with minimal change in heart rate or O-2 pulse, indicating that O-2 consumption was maintained by either a constant arterial-venous O-2 content difference (an increase in the relative O-2 extracted from arterial blood) or by a combination of changes in stroke volume and the arterial-venous O-2 content difference. Three high-altitude taxa (yellow-billed pintails, cinnamon teal and speckled teal) had higher Hct and Hb concentration, increasing the O-2 content of arterial blood, and potentially providing a greater reserve for enhancing O-2 delivery during hypoxia. Hct and Hb concentration between low- and high-altitude populations of ruddy duck were similar, representing a potential adaptation to diving life. Heart rate variability was generally lower in high-altitude ducks, concurrent with similar or lower heart rates than low-altitude ducks, suggesting a reduction in vagal and sympathetic tone. These unique features of the Andean ducks differ from previous observations in both Andean geese and bar-headed geese, neither of which exhibit significant elevations in Hct or Hb concentration compared with their low-altitude relatives, revealing yet another avian strategy for coping with high altitude.",2020,10.1242/jeb.211250,223,5,NA,jeb211250,Heart rate variability; Oxygen transport; Oxygen consumption; Heart rate; Haemoglobin; Hypoxia
article,Effects of unsaturated fatty acids on torpor frequency and diet selection in Djungarian hamsters (<i>Phodopus sungorus</i>),"Diedrich, Victoria and Steinlechner, Stephan and Scherbarth, Frank",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have been shown to play a beneficial role in hibernating mammals. High amounts of dietary PUFA led to an earlier hibernation onset, deeper and longer hibernation bouts and a higher proportion of hibernating animals in several species. In contrast, the relevance of dietary PUFA for daily heterotherms exhibiting only brief and shallow torpor bouts is less well studied. Therefore, diets differing in PUFA composition were used to examine the effects on the frequency of spontaneous daily torpor in Djungarian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus). In contrast to earlier studies, we were interested in whether the ratio of n-6 to n-3 PUFA affects torpor expression, and in comparison with a diet rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). Although we found a positive effect on torpor frequency in hamsters fed a diet rich in n-6 PUFA compared with the groups fed diets either rich in n-3 PUFA or MUFA, the latter two groups did not show unusually low torpor frequencies. The results of the additional diet choice experiment indicated that hamsters in short photoperiod select food with only a slight excess of n-6 PUFA compared with n-3 PUFA (ratio of 1 to 1.5). However, there was no significant difference in torpor frequency between the diet choice group and hamsters fed on standard chow with a sevenfold excess of n-6 PUFA. In summary, the present data strongly indicate that the dietary composition of unsaturated fatty acids plays a minor role in the occurrence of spontaneous daily torpor in Djungarian hamsters.",2014,10.1242/jeb.113217,217,24,4313-4319,NA,Heterothermic; PUFA; MUFA; Thermoregulatory behaviour; Diet choice
article,Maternal provisioning and fluctuating thermal regimes enhance immune response in a reptile with temperature-dependent sex determination,"Leivesley, Jessica Alice and Rollinson, Njal",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The Charnov-Bull model of differential fitness is often used to explain the evolution and maintenance of temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). Most tests of the model focus on morphological proxies of fitness, such as size traits, whereas early life physiological traits that are closely related to lifetime fitness might provide a framework for generalizing the Charnov-Bull model across taxa. One such trait is the strength of the early-life immune response, which is strongly linked to early-life survival and fitness. Here, we manipulated temperature, variance in temperature, and sex to test the Charnov-Bull model using a physiological trait, immune system strength, in the snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina). We found no evidence of sex-specific differences in bactericidal capacity of hatchling blood, and no evidence that mean temperature influences bactericidal capacity. However, we did find that fluctuating incubation temperature (i.e. a more naturalized incubation regime) is associated with a greater bactericidal capacity compared with constant temperature incubation. We also found that egg mass, a proxy for maternal provisioning, is positively associated with bactericidal capacity. Our findings suggest that the evolution of temperature-dependent sex determination in reptiles is unrelated to our measure of early-life innate immunity. Our study also underlines how immune response is condition dependent in early life, and questions the biological relevance of constant temperature incubation in experimental studies on ectotherm development.",2021,10.1242/jeb.237016,224,5,NA,jeb237016,Fitness; Bacteria-killing assay; Thermal fluctuations; Maternal provisioning; Chelydra serpentina
article,Clocks and meals keep mice from being cool,"van der Vinne, Vincent and Bingaman, Mark J. and Weaver, David R. and Swoap, Steven J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Daily torpor is used by small mammals to reduce daily energy expenditure in response to energetic challenges. Optimizing the timing of daily torpor allows mammals to maximize its energetic benefits and, accordingly, torpor typically occurs in the late night and early morning in most species. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying such temporal regulation have not been elucidated. Direct control by the circadian clock and indirect control through the timing of food intake have both been suggested as possible mechanisms. Here, feeding cycles outside of the circadian range and brain-specific mutations of circadian clock genes ( Vgat-Cre(+) CK1 delta(fl/fl) epsilon(fl/+); Vgat-Cre(+)Bmal1(fl/fl)) were used to separate the roles of the circadian clock and food timing in controlling the timing of daily torpor in mice. These experiments revealed that the timing of daily torpor is transiently inhibited by feeding, while the circadian clock is the major determinant of the timing of torpor. Torpor never occurred during the early part of the circadian active phase, but was preferentially initiated late in the subjective night. Food intake disrupted torpor in the first 4-6 h after feeding by preventing or interrupting torpor bouts. Following interruption, re-initiation of torpor was unlikely until after the next circadian active phase. Overall, these results demonstrate that feeding transiently inhibits torpor while the central circadian clock gates the timing of daily torpor in response to energetic challenges by restricting the initiation of torpor to a specific circadian phase.",2018,10.1242/jeb.179812,221,15,NA,jeb179812,Body temperature; Circadian rhythm; Clock mutant; Energetic savings; Metabolism; Suprachiasmatic nucleus
article,Understanding variation in metabolic rate,"Pettersen, Amanda K. and Marshall, Dustin J. and White, Craig R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Metabolic rate reflects an organism's capacity for growth, maintenance and reproduction, and is likely to be a target of selection. Physiologists have long sought to understand the causes and consequences of within-individual to among-species variation in metabolic rates - how metabolic rates relate to performance and how they should evolve. Traditionally, this has been viewed from a mechanistic perspective, relying primarily on hypothesis-driven approaches. A more agnostic, but ultimately more powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of phenotypic variation is through use of the breeder's equation, because variation in metabolic rate is likely to be a consequence of underlying microevolutionary processes. Here we show that metabolic rates are often significantly heritable, and are therefore free to evolve under selection. We note, however, that `metabolic rate' is not a single trait: in addition to the obvious differences between metabolic levels (e.g. basal, resting, free-living, maximal), metabolic rate changes through ontogeny and in response to a range of extrinsic factors, and is therefore subject to multivariate constraint and selection. We emphasize three key advantages of studying metabolic rate within a quantitative genetics framework: its formalism, and its predictive and comparative power. We make several recommendations when applying a quantitative genetics framework: (i) measuring selection based on actual fitness, rather than proxies for fitness; (ii) considering the genetic covariances between metabolic rates throughout ontogeny; and (iii) estimating genetic covariances between metabolic rates and other traits. A quantitative genetics framework provides the means for quantifying the evolutionary potential of metabolic rate and why variance in metabolic rates within populations might be maintained.",2018,10.1242/jeb.166876,221,1,NA,jeb166876,Metabolism; Evolution; Selection; Quantitative genetics

As mitochondrial metabolism represents the main physiological link between the endogenous energy store and animal performance, the aim of this study was to determine how a very long, natural period of fasting affected skeletal muscle mitochondrial bioenergetics in king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus) chicks. Rates of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation were measured in pectoralis permeabilized fibres and isolated mitochondria. Mitochondrial ATP synthesis efficiency and the activities of respiratory chain complexes were measured in mitochondria isolated from pectoralis muscle. Results from long-term (4-5 months) naturally fasted chicks were compared with those from short-term (10 day) fasted birds. The respiratory activities of muscle fibres and isolated mitochondria were reduced by 60\% and 45\%, respectively, on average in long-term fasted chicks compared with short-term fasted birds. Oxidative capacity and mitochondrial content of pectoralis muscle were lowered by long-term fasting. Bioenergetic analysis of pectoralis muscle also revealed that mitochondria were, on average, 25\% more energy efficient in the final stage of fasting (4-5 months) than after 10 days of fasting (short-term fasted birds). These results suggest that the strong reduction in respiratory capacity of pectoralis muscle was partly alleviated by increased mitochondrial ATP synthesis efficiency. Such oxidative phosphorylation optimization can impact animal performance, e.g. the metabolic cost of locomotion or the foraging efficiency.",2017,10.1242/jeb.159087,220,13,2445-2451,NA,Mitochondria; Oxidative phosphorylation; Bioenergetics; Starvation; Birds; Skeletal muscle

As embryonic mortality at early stages mainly results from defects in cardiovascular development, we focused on heart formation and angiogenesis. We found that high-salt exposure enhanced the risk of abnormal heart tube looping and blood congestion in the heart chamber. In the presence of high salt, both ventricular cell proliferation and apoptosis increased. The high osmolarity induced by high salt in the ventricular cardiomyocytes resulted in incomplete differentiation, which might be due to reduced expression of Nkx2.5 and GATA4. Blood vessel density and diameter were suppressed by exposure to high salt in both the yolk sac membrane (YSM) and chorioallantoic membrane models. In addition, high-salt-induced suppression of angiogenesis occurred even at the vasculogenesis stage, as blood island formation was also inhibited by high-salt exposure. At the same time, cell proliferation was repressed and cell apoptosis was enhanced by high-salt exposure in YSM tissue. Moreover, the reduction in expression of HIF2 and FGF2 genes might cause high-salt-suppressed angiogenesis. Interestingly, we show that high-salt exposure causes excess generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the heart and YSM tissues, which could be partially rescued through the addition of antioxidants. In total, our study suggests that excess generation of ROS might play an important role in high-saltinduced defects in heart and angiogenesis.",2015,10.1242/jeb.129486,218,21,3468-3477,NA,High salt/osmolarity; Heart formation; Angiogenesis; ROS

Here we report how three geographically different populations of Enchytraeus albidus (Germany, Iceland and Svalbard) respond to three temperature treatments - constant thawed (0 degrees C), constant freezing (-5 degrees C) and fluctuating temperature (0 to -5 degrees C) over a period of 42 days. Survival varied between treatments and populations such that enchytraeids from arctic locations had a higher survival following prolonged freeze periods compared with temperate populations. However, enchytraeids from temperate locations had the same survival rate as arctic populations when exposed to repeated freeze-thaw events. Across all populations, metabolic rate decreased markedly in frozen animals (-5 degrees C) compared with thawed controls (0 degrees C). This decrease is likely due to the lower temperature of frozen animals, but also to the transition to the frozen state per se. Animals exposed to repeated freeze-thaw events had an intermediate metabolic rate and freeze-thaw events were not associated with pronounced excess energetic costs. Overwintering under either condition was not associated with a decrease in lipid content; however, during exposure to constant freezing and repeated freeze-thaw events there was a noticeable decrease in carbohydrate stores over time. Thus, animals exposed to constant freezing showed a decrease in glycogen stores, while both glucose and glycogen content decreased over time when the organisms were exposed to repeated freezing. The results therefore suggest that carbohydrate resources are important as a fuel for E. albidus during freezing whereas lipid resources are of marginal importance.",2014,10.1242/jeb.105650,217,21,3843-3852,NA,Freeze-thaw cycles; Glucose; Glycogen; Metabolic rate; Cold tolerance
article,Spontaneous unraveling of hagfish slime thread skeins is mediated by a seawater-soluble protein adhesive,"Bernards, Jr., Mark A. and Oke, Isdin and Heyland, Andreas and Fudge, Douglas S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Hagfishes are known for their ability to rapidly produce vast quantities of slime when provoked. The slime is formed via the interaction between seawater and two components released by the slime glands: mucin vesicles from gland mucous cells, which swell and rupture in seawater to form a network of mucus strands, and intermediate filament-rich threads, which are produced within gland thread cells as tightly coiled bundles called skeins. A previous study showed that the unraveling of skeins from Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) requires both the presence of mucins and hydrodynamic mixing. In contrast, skeins from Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii) unravel in the absence of both mucins and mixing. We tested the hypothesis that spontaneous unraveling of E. stoutii skeins is triggered by the dissolution of a seawater-soluble protein adhesive and the release of stored strain energy within the coiled thread. Here we show that, as predicted by this hypothesis, unraveling can be initiated by a protease under conditions in which unraveling does not normally occur. We also demonstrate, using high resolution scanning electron microscopy, that the treatment of skeins with solutions that cause unraveling also leads to the disappearance of surface and inter-thread features that remain when skeins are washed with stabilizing solutions. Our study provides a mechanism for the deployment of thread skeins in Pacific hagfish slime, and raises the possibility of producing novel biomimetic protein adhesives that are salt, temperature and kosmotrope sensitive.",2014,10.1242/jeb.096909,217,8,1263-1268,NA,Hagfish; Eptatretus stoutii; Slime; Mucus; Skein; Unraveling; Adhesive

In this experimental study, we exposed eels to different combinations of temperature (12-20 degrees C) and pressure (100-800 kPa) during long-term sustained swimming (32-47 days).

Prevailing theory suggests that many species exploit hydrodynamic refuges to minimize the cost of locomotion while foraging. Here, we challenge this theory based on direct oxygen consumption measurements of drift-feeding trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) foraging in the freestream and from behind a flow refuge at velocities up to 100 cm s(-1). We demonstrate that refuging is not energetically beneficial when foraging in fast flows because of a high attack cost and low prey capture success associated with leaving a station-holding refuge to intercept prey. By integrating optimum foraging theory with empirical data from respirometry and video tracking, we developed a mathematical model to predict when drift-feeding fishes should exploit or avoid refuges based on prey density, size and flow velocity. Our optimum foraging and refuging model provides new mechanistic insights into locomotor costs, habitat use and prey choice of fish foraging in current-swept habitats.",2020,10.1242/jeb.220962,223,12,NA,jeb220962,Swimming; Flow refuging; Karman gait; Prey capture; Turbulence; Respirometry; Ecology; Behavior

R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Processes associated with recovery of survivors are understudied components of wildlife infectious diseases. White-nose syndrome (WNS) in bats provides an opportunity to study recovery of disease survivors, understand implications of recovery for individual energetics, and assess the role of survivors in pathogen transmission. We documented temporal patterns of recovery from WNS in little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) following hibernation to test the hypotheses that: (1) recovery of wing structure from WNS matches a rapid time scale (i.e. approximately 30 days) suggested by data from free-ranging bats; (2) torpor expression plays a role in recovery; (3) wing physiological function returns to normal alongside structural recovery; and (4) pathogen loads decline quickly during recovery. We collected naturally infected bats at the end of hibernation, brought them into captivity, and quantified recovery over 40 days by monitoring body mass, wing damage, thermoregulation, histopathology of wing biopsies, skin surface lipids and fungal load. Most metrics returned to normal within 30 days, although wing damage was still detectable at the end of the study. Torpor expression declined overall throughout the study, but bats expressed relatively shallow torpor bouts-with a plateau in minimum skin temperature-during intensive healing between approximately days 8 and 15. Pathogen loads were nearly undetectable after the first week of the study, but some bats were still detectably infected at day 40. Our results suggest that healing bats face a severe energetic imbalance during early recovery from direct costs of healing and reduced foraging efficiency. Management of WNS should not rely solely on actions during winter, but should also aim to support energy balance of recovering bats during spring and summer.",2020,10.1242/jeb.211912,223,6,NA,jeb211912,Healing; Heterothermy; Histology; Lipid profiles; Myotis lucifugus; Wildlife disease

We examined the effect of shoaling on metabolism and body condition in the gregarious damselfish Chromis viridis.

article,Transcriptome profiling reveals mechanisms for the evolution of insect seasonality,"Wadsworth, Crista B. and Dopman, Erik B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Rapid evolutionary change in seasonal timing can facilitate ecological speciation and resilience to climate warming. However, the molecular mechanisms behind shifts in animal seasonality are still unclear. Evolved differences in seasonality occur in the European corn borer moth (Ostrinia nubilalis), in which early summer emergence in E-strain adults and later summer emergence in Z-strain adults is explained by a shift in the length of the termination phase of larval diapause. Here, we sample from the developmental time course of diapause in both strains and use transcriptome sequencing to profile regulatory and amino acid changes associated with timing divergence. Within a previously defined quantitative trait locus (QTL), we nominate 48 candidate genes, including several in the insulin signaling and circadian rhythm pathways. Genome-wide transcriptional activity is negligible during the extended Z-strain termination, whereas shorter E-strain termination is characterized by a rapid burst of regulatory changes involved in resumption of the cell cycle, hormone production and stress response. Although gene expression during diapause termination in Ostrinia is similar to that found previously in flies, nominated genes for shifts in timing are species specific. Hence, across distant relatives the evolution of insect seasonality appears to involve unique genetic switches that direct organisms into distinct phases of the diapause pathway through wholesale restructuring of conserved gene regulatory networks.",2015,10.1242/jeb.126136,218,22,3611-3622,NA,Temporal isolation; Dormancy; Phenology; Developmental timing; Lepidoptera

Brevinin-1SY was predicted to be an amphipathic, hydrophobic, alpha helical peptide that inserts into a lipid bilayer. Brevinin-1SY transcripts were detected in tadpoles and were significantly increased during the later stages of development. Effects of environmental stress (24 h anoxia, 40\% dehydration or 24 h frozen) on the mRNA levels of brevinin-1SY in the dorsal and ventral skin were examined. The brevinin-1SY mRNA levels were increased in dorsal and ventral skin of dehydrated frogs, and in ventral skin of anoxic frogs, compared with controls (non-stressed). Brevinin-1SY protein levels in peptide extracts of dorsal skin showed a similar, but not significant, trend to that of brevinin-1SY mRNA levels.

One hypothesis is that potentially energetically costly processes such as immune function and protection from oxidative stress may be compromised during reproductive attempts because of selective resource allocation. Lower temperatures also impose energy costs, and hence allocation decisions might be more pronounced when animals are forced to reproduce in the cold. Here, we experimentally tested whether reproduction at different ambient temperatures was associated with elevated oxidative stress and suppressed immune function in Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus). Using a variety of different markers for both immune function and oxidative stress, we found that some measures of immune function (serum bactericidal capacity and size of the thymus) were significantly suppressed, while some measures of oxidative protection {[}serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity] were also reduced, and a marker of oxidative damage (protein carbonyls in serum) was increased in lactating compared with non-reproductive gerbils. These changes were in line with the selective resource allocation predictions. However, the phytohaemagglutinin response and serum total immunoglobulin (IgG) were not suppressed, and other markers of oxidative damage {[}malondialdehyde (MDA) (TBARS) and protein carbonyls in the liver] were actually lower in lactating compared with non-reproductive gerbils, consistent with increased levels of SOD activity and total antioxidant capacity in the liver. These latter changes were opposite of the expectations based on resource allocation. Furthermore, other measures of protection (GPx levels in the liver and protein thiols in both serum and liver) and damage {[}MDA (TBARS) in serum] were unrelated to reproductive status. Ambient temperature differences did not impact on these patterns. Collectively, our results indicated that the inferred effects of reproduction on immunosuppression and oxidative damage, and hence support or otherwise for particular physiological mechanisms that underpin life history trade-offs, are critically dependent on the exact markers and tissues used. This may be because during reproduction individuals selectively allocate protection to some key tissues, but sacrifice protection of others.",2013,10.1242/jeb.092049,216,22,4242-4250,NA,environmental temperature; immune function; lactation; Mongolian gerbil; Meriones unguiculatus; oxidative damage; trade-offs
article,Ontogenetic changes in larval swimming and orientation of pre-competent sea urchin <i>Arbacia punctulata</i> in turbulence,"Wheeler, Jeanette D. and Chan, Kit Yu Karen and Anderson, Erik J. and Mullineaux, Lauren S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Many marine organisms have complex life histories, having sessile adults and relying on the planktonic larvae for dispersal. Larvae swim and disperse in a complex fluid environment and the effect of ambient flow on larval behavior could in turn impact their survival and transport. However, to date, most studies on larvae-flow interactions have focused on competent larvae near settlement. We examined the importance of flow on early larval stages by studying how local flow and ontogeny influence swimming behavior in pre-competent larval sea urchins, Arbacia punctulata. We exposed larval urchins to grid-stirred turbulence and recorded their behavior at two stages (4- and 6-armed plutei) in three turbulence regimes. Using particle image velocimetry to quantify and subtract local flow, we tested the hypothesis that larvae respond to turbulence by increasing swimming speed, and that the increase varies with ontogeny. Swimming speed increased with turbulence for both 4- and 6-armed larvae, but their responses differed in terms of vertical swimming velocity. 4-Armed larvae swam most strongly upward in the unforced flow regime, while 6-armed larvae swam most strongly upward in weakly forced flow. Increased turbulence intensity also decreased the relative time that larvae spent in their typical upright orientation. 6-Armed larvae were tilted more frequently in turbulence compared with 4-armed larvae. This observation suggests that as larvae increase in size and add pairs of arms, they are more likely to be passively re-oriented by moving water, rather than being stabilized (by mechanisms associated with increased mass), potentially leading to differential transport. The positive relationship between swimming speed and larval orientation angle suggests that there was also an active response to tilting in turbulence. Our results highlight the importance of turbulence to planktonic larvae, not just during settlement but also in earlier stages through morphology-flow interactions.",2016,10.1242/jeb.129502,219,9,1303-1310,NA,Pluteus; Behavior; Hydrodynamics; Particle image velocimetry
article,Multi-omics reveals largely distinct transcript- and protein-level responses to the environment in an intertidal mussel,"Gleason, Lani U. and Fekete, Florian J. and Tanner, Richelle L. and Dowd, W. Wesley",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Organismal responses to stressful environments are influenced by numerous transcript-and protein-level mechanisms, and the relationships between expression changes at these levels are not always straightforward. Here, we used paired transcriptomic and proteomic datasets from two previous studies from gill of the California mussel, Mytilus californianus, to explore how simultaneous transcript and protein abundance patterns may diverge under different environmental scenarios. Field -acclimatized mussels were sampled from two disparate intertidal sites; individuals from one site were subjected to three further treatments (common garden, low-intertidal or high-intertidal outplant) that vary in temperature and feeding time. Assessing 1519 genes shared between the two datasets revealed that both transcript and protein expression patterns differentiated the treatments at a global level, despite numerous underlying discrepancies. There were far more instances of differential expression between treatments in transcript only (1451) or protein only (226) than of the two levels shifting expression concordantly (68 instances). Upregulated expression of cilium-associated transcripts (likely related to feeding) was associated with relatively benign field treatments. In the most stressful treatment, transcripts, but not proteins, for several molecular chaperones (including heat shock proteins and endoplasmic reticulum chaperones) were more abundant, consistent with a threshold model for induction of translation of constitutively available mRNAs. Overall, these results suggest that the relative importance of transcript-and protein-level regulation (translation and/or turnover) differs among cellular functions and across specific microhabitats or environmental contexts. Furthermore, the degree of concordance between transcript and protein expression can vary across benign versus acutely stressful environmental conditions.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245962,226,22,NA,jeb245962,RNA-seq; Proteomics; Mollusk; Rocky intertidal; Environmental stress; Mytilus californianus

Here, we introduce a controlled system that allows large aquatic ectotherms to roam freely in a tank at sub-optimal temperatures, using thermal refuges to increase body temperature to their thermal optimum as desired. Of the 10 coral grouper (Plectropomus leopardus; length -400 mm) implanted with thermal loggers, three fish maintained themselves at the ambient tank temperature of 17.5-20.5 degrees C for the entire 2-4 days of the trial. Of the other seven fish, body temperature never exceeded -21.5 degrees C, which was well below the temperature available in the thermal refuges (-31 degrees C) and below the species' optimal temperature of -27 degrees C.

article,Context-dependent effects on attack and defense behaviors in the praying mantis <i>Tenodera</i> <i>sinensis</i>,"Bosse, Jacob W. and Svenson, Gavin J. and Bowers, Troy A. and Bourges-Sevenier, Brendan M. and Ritzmann, Roy E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Most behavior needs to strike a balance between the competing needs to find food and protect an animal from predators. The factors that influence this balance and the resulting behavior are not well understood in many animals. Here, we examined these influences in the praying mantis Tenodera sinensis by presenting perching individuals with alternating sinusoidally moving prey-like stimuli and rapidly expanding looming stimuli then scoring their behavior on a defensive-aggressive scale. In this way, we tested the hypothesis that such behaviors are highly context dependent. Specifically, we found that defensive responses, which are normally very consistent, are decreased in magnitude if the animal has just performed an aggressive response to the previous sinusoid. A thrash behavior not normally seen with looming alone was often seen following aggression. In thrashing, the animal tries to push the looming stimulus away. Thrashing almost exclusively followed aggressive responses to the sinusoid stimulus. Moreover, aggression levels were found to shift from low to high and back to low as adult animals aged and, in general, female mantises were more aggressive than males. Finally, the specific nature of the mid-life spike in aggressive behaviors differed according to whether the animals were lab raised or caught in the wild. Lab-raised animals showed roughly equal amounts of increased attention to the stimulus and very aggressive strike behaviors, whereas wild-caught animals tended to either ignore the stimulus or react very aggressively with strikes. Therefore, our hypothesis regarding context-dependent effects was supported, with all four factors influencing the behaviors that were studied.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243710,225,11,NA,jeb243710,Escape; Hunting; Aggression; Insect predators; Looming
article,Timing of increased temperature sensitivity coincides with nervous system development in winter moth embryos,"van Dis, Natalie E. and van der Zee, Maurijn and Hut, Roelof A. and Wertheim, Bregje and Visser, Marcel E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Climate change is rapidly altering the environment and many species will need to genetically adapt their seasonal timing to keep up with these changes. Insect development rate is largely influenced by temperature, but we know little about the mechanisms underlying the temperature sensitivity of development. Here, we investigate seasonal timing of egg hatching in the winter moth, one of the few species which has been found to genetically adapt to climate change, likely through selection on temperature sensitivity of egg development rate. To study when during development winter moth embryos are most sensitive to changes in ambient temperature, we gave eggs an increase or decrease in temperature at different moments during their development. We measured their developmental progression and time of egg hatching, and used fluorescence microscopy to construct a timeline of embryonic development for the winter moth. We found that egg development rate responded more strongly to temperature once embryos were in the fully extended germband stage. This is the phylotypic stage at which all insect embryos have developed a rudimentary nervous system. Furthermore, at this stage, timing of ecdysone signaling determines developmental progression, which could act as an environment dependent gateway. Intriguingly, this may suggest that, from the phylotypic stage onward, insect embryos can start to integrate internal and environmental stimuli to actively regulate important developmental processes. As we found evidence that there is genetic variation for temperature sensitivity of egg development rate in our study population, such regulation could be a target of selection imposed by climate change.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242554,224,17,NA,jeb242554,Temperature sensitivity; Insect development; Seasonal timing; Climate change; Adaptation; Operophtera brumata
article,Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<SUP>2+</SUP>-ATPase (SERCA) activity during the transition to endothermy in an altricial bird,"Price, Edwin R. and Sirsat, Tushar S. and Sirsat, Sarah K. G. and Dzialowski, Edward M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) is a transmembrane pump critical to muscle calcium cycling during contraction, and SERCA has also been proposed as the basis for a non-shivering thermogenesis mechanism in birds. Despite its potential importance to both shivering and non-shivering thermogenesis, the activity of this transporter has rarely been studied in altricial birds, and never during the developmental transition from ectothermy to endothermy. Here, we describe SERCA activity in the pectoralis musde and heart ventricle of red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) nestlings, fledglings and adults. Additionally, using a diet manipulation, we tested the hypothesis that muscle SERCA activity is affected by dietary fatty acid composition, as has been shown in some previous studies. In blackbird hearts, SERCA activity increased throughout development and into adulthood, conspicuously jumping higher just prior to fledging. In pectoralis muscle, SERCA activity increased throughout the nestling period, but then declined after fledging, an effect we attribute to remodeling of the muscle from a primarily heat-generating organ to a primarily force-generating organ. SERCA activity of the pectoralis muscle was correlated with the proportion of linoleic acid in muscle phospholipids when including all ages in the control group. However, in diet-manipulated birds, there was no consistent relationship between SERCA activity and muscle membrane fatty acid composition at any tested age (5-9 days old). It is unclear whether SERCA might be affected by developmental changes in fatty acid composition at younger ages.",2019,10.1242/jeb.201111,222,13,NA,jeb201111,Linoleic acid; Docosahexaenoic acid; Maximal metabolic rate; Agelaius phoeniceus; Diet; Development
article,Further miniaturisation of the Thermochron iButton to create a thermal bio-logger weighing 0.3 g,"Virens, Josef and Cree, Alison",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Thermochron iButtons are commonly used by thermal biologists to continuously measure body temperature from animals. However, if unmodified, these devices are of a size that limits their use with very small animals. To allow iButtons to be used to study smaller species, methods to miniaturise them by 61\% have been previously described. We present a method to reduce iButton mass by a further 71\%. The modified devices have a shorter battery life, but the minimum size of vertebrates able to carry the devices is reduced from 28.9 g to 6.6 g, if the arbitrary, yet widely cited, maximum of 5\% body mass for attached devices is adhered to. We demonstrate the application of our method by recording surface temperatures of captive and wild skinks and show that captive cockroaches weighing 0.8 g are also able to carry the device. We believe this to be the first time that temperature data have been recorded from an insect in this way.",2018,10.1242/jeb.176354,221,11,NA,jeb176354,Temperature datalogger; iButton modification; Thermal biology; Body temperature; Biotelemetry; Small animal
article,Navigating under sea ice promotes rapid maturation of diving physiology and performance in beluga whales,"Noren, Shawn R. and Suydam, Robert",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Little is known about the postnatal development of the physiological characteristics that support breath-hold in cetaceans, despite their need to swim and dive at birth. Arctic species have the additional demand of avoiding entrapment while navigating under sea ice, where breathing holes are patchily distributed and ephemeral. This is the first investigation of the ontogeny of the biochemistry of the locomotor muscle in a year-round Arctic-dwelling cetacean (beluga whale, Delphinapterus leucas). Compared with what we know about other cetaceans, belugas are born with high myoglobin content (1.56+/-0.02 g 100 g(-1) wet muscle mass, N=2) that matures rapidly. Myoglobin increased by 452\% during the first year after birth and achieved adult levels (6.91+/-0.35 g 100 g(-1) wet muscle mass, N=9) by 14 months postpartum. Buffering capacity was 48.88+/-0.69 slykes (N=2) at birth; adult levels (84.31+/-1.38 slykes, N=9) were also achieved by 14 months postpartum. As the oxygen stores matured, calculated aerobic dive limit more than doubled over the first year of life, undoubtedly facilitating the movements of calves under sea ice. Nonetheless, small body size theoretically continues to constrain the diving ability of newly weaned 2 year olds, as they only had 74\% and 69\% of the aerobic breath-hold capacity of larger adult female and male counterparts. These assessments enhance our knowledge of the biology of cetaceans and provide insight into age-specific flexibility to alter underwater behaviors, as may be required with the ongoing alterations in the Arctic marine ecosystem associated with climate change and increased anthropogenic activities.",2016,10.1242/jeb.143644,219,18,2828-2836,NA,Myoglobin; Muscle acid buffering capacity; Diving capacity; Marine mammal; Cetacean; Arctic
article,"Artemin, a diapause-specific chaperone, contributes to the stress tolerance of <i>Artemia franciscana</i> cysts and influences their release from females","King, Allison M. and Toxopeus, Jantina and MacRae, Thomas H.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Females of the crustacean Artemia franciscana produce either motile nauplii or gastrula stage embryos enclosed in a shell impermeable to nonvolatile compounds and known as cysts. The encysted embryos enter diapause, a state of greatly reduced metabolism and profound stress tolerance. Artemin, a diapause-specific ferritin homolog in cysts has molecular chaperone activity in vitro. Artemin represents 7.2\% of soluble protein in cysts, approximately equal to the amount of p26, a small heat shock protein. However, there is almost twice as much artemin mRNA in cysts as compared with p26 mRNA, suggesting that artemin mRNA is translated less efficiently. RNA interference employing the injection of artemin double-stranded RNA into the egg sacs of A. franciscana females substantially reduced artemin mRNA and protein in cysts. Decreasing artemin diminished desiccation and freezing tolerance of cysts, demonstrating a role for this protein in stress resistance. Knockdown of artemin increased the time required for complete discharge of a brood of cysts carried within a female from a few hours up to 4 days, an effect weakened in successive broods. Artemin, an abundant molecular chaperone, contributes to stress tolerance of A. franciscana cysts while influencing their development and/or exit from females.",2014,10.1242/jeb.100081,217,10,1719-1724,NA,Artemin; Molecular chaperone; Diapause; Stress tolerance; Artemia franciscana
article,Aerodynamics of the flying snake <i>Chrysopelea</i> <i>paradisi</i>: how a bluff body cross-sectional shape contributes to gliding performance,"Holden, Daniel and Socha, John J. and Cardwell, Nicholas D. and Vlachos, Pavlos P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"A prominent feature of gliding flight in snakes of the genus Chrysopelea is the unique cross-sectional shape of the body, which acts as the lifting surface in the absence of wings. When gliding, the flying snake Chrysopelea paradisi morphs its circular cross-section into a triangular shape by splaying its ribs and flattening its body in the dorsoventral axis, forming a geometry with fore-aft symmetry and a thick profile. Here, we aimed to understand the aerodynamic properties of the snake's cross-sectional shape to determine its contribution to gliding at low Reynolds numbers. We used a straight physical model in a water tunnel to isolate the effects of 2D shape, analogously to studying the profile of an airfoil of a more typical flyer. Force measurements and time-resolved (TR) digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) were used to determine lift and drag coefficients, wake dynamics and vortex-shedding characteristics of the shape across a behaviorally relevant range of Reynolds numbers and angles of attack. The snake's cross-sectional shape produced a maximum lift coefficient of 1.9 and maximum lift-to-drag ratio of 2.7, maintained increases in lift up to 35 deg, and exhibited two distinctly different vortex-shedding modes. Within the measured Reynolds number regime (Re= 3000-15,000), this geometry generated significantly larger maximum lift coefficients than many other shapes including bluff bodies, thick airfoils, symmetric airfoils and circular arc airfoils. In addition, the snake's shape exhibited a gentle stall region that maintained relatively high lift production even up to the highest angle of attack tested (60 deg). Overall, the cross-sectional geometry of the flying snake demonstrated robust aerodynamic behavior by maintaining significant lift production and near-maximum lift-to-drag ratios over a wide range of parameters. These aerodynamic characteristics help to explain how the snake can glide at steep angles and over a wide range of angles of attack, but more complex models that account for 3D effects and the dynamic movements of aerial undulation are required to fully understand the gliding performance of flying snakes.",2014,10.1242/jeb.090902,217,3,382-394,NA,Flying snake; Gliding; Bluff body aerodynamics; Wake dynamics; Particle image velocimetry
