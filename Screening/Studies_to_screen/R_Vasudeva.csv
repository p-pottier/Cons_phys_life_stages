article,Hydrodynamic function of dorsal fins in spiny dogfish and bamboo sharks during steady swimming,"Maia, Anabela and Lauder, George V. and Wilga, Cheryl D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"A key feature of fish functional design is the presence of multiple fins that allow thrust vectoring and redirection of fluid momentum to contribute to both steady swimming and maneuvering. A number of previous studies have analyzed the function of dorsal fins in teleost fishes in this context, but the hydrodynamic function of dorsal fins in freely swimming sharks has not been analyzed, despite the potential for differential functional roles between the anterior and posterior dorsal fins. Previous anatomical research has suggested a primarily stabilizing role for shark dorsal fins. We evaluated the generality of this hypothesis by using time-resolved particle image velocimetry to record water flow patterns in the wake of both the anterior and posterior dorsal fins in two species of freely swimming sharks: bamboo sharks (Chiloscyllium plagiosum) and spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias). Cross-correlation analysis of consecutive images was used to calculate stroke-averaged mean longitudinal and lateral velocity components, and vorticity. In spiny dogfish, we observed a velocity deficit in the wake of the first dorsal fin and flow acceleration behind the second dorsal fin, indicating that the first dorsal fin experiences net drag while the second dorsal fin can aid in propulsion. In contrast, the wake of both dorsal fins in bamboo sharks displayed increased net flow velocity in the majority of trials, reflecting a thrust contribution to steady swimming. In bamboo sharks, fluid flow in the wake of the second dorsal fin had higher absolute average velocity than that for first dorsal fin, and this may result from a positive vortex interaction between the first and second dorsal fins. These data suggest that the first dorsal fin in spiny dogfish has primarily a stabilizing function, while the second dorsal fin has a propulsive function. In bamboo sharks, both dorsal fins can contribute thrust and should be considered as propulsive adjuncts to the body during steady swimming. The function of shark dorsal fins can thus differ considerably among fins and species, and is not limited to a stabilizing role.",2017,10.1242/jeb.152215,220,21,3967-3975,NA,Elasmobranchs; Particle image velocimetry; PIV; Functional morphology; Locomotion; Wake; Flow visualization
article,"Nitrogen metabolism of the intestine during digestion in a teleost fish, the plainfin midshipman (<i>Porichthys notatus</i>)","Bucking, Carol and LeMoine, Christophe M. R. and Craig, Paul M. and Walsh, Patrick J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Digestion affects nitrogen metabolism in fish, as both exogenous and endogenous proteins and amino acids are catabolized, liberating ammonia in the process. Here we present a model of local detoxification of ammonia by the intestinal tissue of the plainfin midshipman (Porichthys notatus) during digestion, resulting in an increase in urea excretion of gastrointestinal origin. Corroborating evidence indicated whole-animal ammonia and urea excretion increased following feeding, and ammonia levels within the lumen of the midshipman intestine increased to high levels (1.8 +/- 0.4. mu mol N g(-1)). We propose that this ammonia entered the enterocytes and was detoxified to urea via the ornithine-urea cycle (O-UC) enzymes, as evidenced by a 1.5- to 2.9-fold postprandial increase in glutamine synthetase activity (0.14 +/- 0.05 and 0.28 +/- 0.02 mu mol min(-1) g(-1) versus 0.41 +/- 0.03 mu mol min(-1) g(-1)) and an 8.7-fold increase in carbamoyl phosphate synthetase III activity (0.3 +/- 1.2 versus 2.6 +/- 0.4 nmol min(-1) g(-1)). Furthermore, digestion increased urea production by isolated gastrointestinal tissue 1.7-fold, supporting our hypothesis that intestinal tissue synthesizes urea in response to feeding. We further propose that the intestinal urea may have been excreted into the intestinal lumen via an apical urea transporter as visualized using immunohistochemistry. A portion of the urea was then excreted to the environment along with the feces, resulting in the observed increase in urea excretion, while another portion may have been used by intestinal ureolytic bacteria. Overall, we propose that P. notatus produces urea within the enterocytes via a functional O-UC, which is then excreted into the intestinal lumen. Our model of intestinal nitrogen metabolism does not appear to be universal as we were unable to activate the O-UC in the intestine of fed rainbow trout. However, literature values suggest that multiple fish species could follow this model.",2013,10.1242/jeb.081562,216,15,2821-2832,NA,ammonia; urea; prandial; ureolytic bacteria; Porichthys notatus; Oncorhynchus mykiss
article,Anti-diuretic action of a CAPA neuropeptide against a subset of diuretic hormones in the disease vector <i>Aedes</i> <i>aegypti</i>,"Sajadi, Farwa and Curcuruto, Carmela and Al Dhaheri, Afra and Paluzzi, Jean-Paul V.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The mosquito Aedes aegypti is a vector responsible for transmitting various pathogens to humans, and their prominence as chief vectors of human disease is largely due to their anthropophilic blood feeding behaviour. Larval stage mosquitoes must deal with the potential dilution of their haemolymph in freshwater, whereas the haematophagus A. aegypti female faces the challenge of excess ion and water intake after a blood meal. The excretory system, composed of the Malpighian tubules (MTs) and hindgut, is strictly controlled by neuroendocrine factors, responsible for the regulation of diuresis across all developmental stages. The highly studied insect MTs are influenced by a variety of diuretic hormones and, in some insects, anti-diuretic factors. In the present study, we investigated the effects of AedaeCAPA-1 neuropeptide on larval and adult female A. aegypti MTs stimulated with various diuretic factors including serotonin (5-HT), a corticotropin-related factor (CRF) diuretic peptide, a calcitonin-related diuretic hormone (DH31) and a kinin-related diuretic peptide. Overall, our findings establish that AedaeCAPA-1 specifically inhibits secretion of larval and adult MTs stimulated by 5-HT and DH31, whilst having no activity on MTs stimulated by other diuretic factors. Furthermore, although AedaeCAPA-1 acts as an antidiuretic, it does not influence the relative proportions of cations transported by adult MTs, thus maintaining the kaliuretic activity of 5-HT and natriuretic activity of DH31. In addition, we tested the effects of the second messenger cGMP in adult MTs. We established that cGMP has similar effects to AedaeCAPA-1, strongly inhibiting 5-HT-nd DH31-stimulated fluid secretion, but with only minor effects on CRF-stimulated diuresis. Interestingly, although AedaeCAPA-1 has no inhibitory activity on kinin-stimulated fluid secretion, cGMP strongly inhibited fluid secretion by this diuretic hormone, which targets stellate cells specifically. Collectively, these results support that AedaeCAPA-1 inhibits select diuretic factors acting on the principal cells and this probably involves cGMP as a second messenger. Kinin-stimulated diuresis, which targets stellate cells, is also inhibited by cGMP, suggesting that another anti-diuretic factor in addition to AedaeCAPA-1 exists and may utilize cGMP as a second messenger.",2018,10.1242/jeb.177089,221,7,NA,jeb177089,Disease vector; Anti-diuretic hormone; Malpighian tubules; Calcitonin-like diuretic hormone; DH31; Corticotropin-releasing factor-related diuretic hormone; Kinin; Serotonin

In fishes, M O 2 ,max is commonly quantified by measuring oxygen uptake either during incremental swimming tests or during recovery from an exhaustive chase. In this Commentary, we compile recent studies that apply both techniques to the same fish and show that the two methods typically yield different mean estimates of M O 2 ,max for a group of individuals. Furthermore, within a group of fish, estimates of M O 2 ,max determined during swimming are poorly correlated with estimates determined during recovery from chasing (i.e. an individual's M O 2 ,max is not repeatable across methods). One explanation for the lack of agreement is that these methods measure different physiological states, each with their own behavioural, anatomical and biochemical determinants. We propose that these methods are not directly interchangeable but, rather, each is suited to address different questions in fish biology. We suggest that researchers select the method that reflects the biological contexts of their study, and we advocate for the use of accurate terminology that acknowledges the technique used to elevate M O 2 (e.g. peak M O 2 ,swim or peak M O 2 ,recovery ). If the study's objective is to estimate the `true' M O 2 ,max of an individual or species, we recommend that pilot studies compare methods, preferably using repeated-measures designs. We hope that these recommendations contribute new insights into the causes and consequences of variation in M O 2 ,max within and among fish species.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246439,227,11,NA,jeb246439,Respirometry; Aerobic metabolism; Swim tunnel; Exhaustive chase; Individual variation
article,Glucose tolerance predicts survival in old zebra finches,"Montoya, Bibiana and Briga, Michael and Jimeno, Blanca and Verhulst, Simon",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The capacity to deal with external and internal challenges is thought to affect fitness, and the age-linked impairment of this capacity defines the ageing process. Using a recently developed intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (GTT), we tested for a link between the capacity to regulate glucose levels and survival in zebra finches. We also investigated for the effects of ambient factors, age, sex, and manipulated developmental and adult conditions (i.e. natal brood size and foraging cost, in a full factorial design) on glucose tolerance. Glucose tolerance was quantified using the incremental `area under the curve' (AUC), with lower values indicating higher tolerance. Glucose tolerance predicted survival probability in old birds, above the median age, with individuals with higher glucose tolerance showing better survival than individuals with low or intermediate glucose tolerance. In young birds there was no association between glucose tolerance and survival. Experimentally induced adverse developmental conditions did not affect glucose tolerance, but lowambient temperature at sampling and hard foraging conditions during adulthood induced a fast return to baseline levels (i.e. high glucose tolerance). These findings can be interpreted as an efficient return to baseline glucose levels when energy requirements are high, with glucose presumably being used for energy metabolism or storage. Glucose tolerance was independent of sex. Our main finding that old birds with higher glucose tolerance had better survival supports the hypothesis that the capacity to efficiently cope with a physiological challenge predicts lifespan, at least in old birds.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243205,225,11,NA,jeb243205,Early-life environment; Glucose regulation; Glucose tolerance test; Survival; Age-dependent mortality; Taeniopygia guttata
article,Bivalves maintain repair when faced with chronically repeated mechanical stress,"Crane, R. L. and Denny, M. W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Even though mollusks' capacity to repair shell damage is usually studied in response to a single event, their shells have to defend them against predatory and environmental threats throughout their potentially multi-decadal life. We measured whether and how mollusks respond to chronic mechanical stress. Once a week for 7 months, we compressed whole live California mussels (Mytilus califomianus) for 15 cycles at similar to 55\% of their predicted one-time breaking force, a treatment known to cause fatigue damage in shells. We found mussels repaired their shells. Shells of experimentally stressed mussels were just as strong at the end of the experiment as those of control mussels that had not been experimentally loaded, and they were more heavily patched internally. Additionally, stressed shells differed in morphology; they were heavier and thicker at the end of the experiment than control shells but they had increased less in width, resulting in a flatter, less domed shape. Finally, the chronic mechanical stress and repair came at a cost, with stressed mussels having higher mortality and less soft tissue than the control group. Although associated with significant cost, mussels' ability to maintain repair in response to ongoing mechanical stress may be vital to their survival in harsh and predator-filled environments.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243813,225,10,NA,jeb243813,Cyclic loading; Fatigue; Functional morphology; Mollusk; Mussel; Mytilus californianus
article,Developmental plasticity in metabolism but not in energy reserve accumulation in a seasonally polyphenic butterfly,"Kivela, Sami M. and Gotthard, Karl and Lehmann, Philipp",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The evolution of seasonal polyphenisms (discrete phenotypes in different annual generations) associated with alternative developmental pathways of diapause (overwintering) and direct development is favoured in temperate insects. Seasonal life history polyphenisms are common and include faster growth and development under direct development than in diapause. However, the physiological underpinnings of this difference remain poorly known despite its significance for understanding the evolution of polyphenisms. We measured respiration and metabolic rates through the penultimate and final larval instars in the butterfly Pieris napi and show that directly developing larvae grew and developed faster and had a higher metabolic rate than larvae entering pupal diapause. The metabolic divergence appeared only in the final instar, that is, after induction of the developmental pathway that takes place in the penultimate instar in P. napi. The accumulation of fat reserves during the final larval instar was similar under diapause and direct development, which was unexpected as diapause is predicted to select for exaggerated reserve accumulation. This suggests that overwinter survival in diapause does not require larger energy reserves than direct development, likely because of metabolic suppression in diapause pupae. The results, nevertheless, demonstrate that physiological changes coincide with the divergence of life histories between the alternative developmental pathways, thus elucidating the proximate basis of seasonal life history polyphenisms.",2019,10.1242/jeb.202150,222,13,NA,jeb202150,Allometry; Diapause; Direct development; Fat reserve; Life history; Metabolic rate; Polyphenism
article,Vultures respond to challenges of near-ground thermal soaring by varying bank angle,"Williams, Hannah J. and Duriez, Olivier and Holton, Mark D. and Dell'Omo, Giacomo and Wilson, Rory P. and Shepard, Emily L. C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Many large birds rely on thermal soaring flight to travel cross-country. As such, they are under selective pressure to minimise the time spent gaining altitude in thermal updrafts. Birds should be able to maximise their climb rates by maintaining a position close to the thermal core through careful selection of bank angle and airspeed; however, there have been few direct measurements of either parameter. Here, we apply a novel methodology to quantify the bank angles selected by soaring binds using on-board magnetometers. We couple these data with airspeed measurements to parameterise the soaring envelope of two species of Gyps vulture, from which it is possible to predict `optimal' bank angles. Our results show that these large birds respond to the challenges of gaining altitude in the initial phase of the climb, where thermal updrafts are weak and narrow, by adopting relatively high, and conserved, bank angles (25-35 deg). The bank angle decreased with increasing altitude, in a manner that was broadly consistent with a strategy of maximising the rate of climb. However, the lift coefficients estimated in our study were lower than those predicted by theoretical models and wind-tunnel studies. Overall, our results highlight how the relevant currency for soaring performance changes within individual climbs: when thermal radius is limiting, birds vary bank angle and maintain a constant airspeed, but speed increases later in the climb in order to respond to decreasing air density.",2018,10.1242/jeb.174995,221,23,NA,jeb174995,Gyps vulture; Aeronautical theory; Circling envelope; Magnetometry; Biologging; Thermal updraft
article,Energetic costs of locomotion in bears: is plantigrade locomotion energetically economical?,"Pagano, Anthony M. and Carnahan, Anthony M. and Robbins, Charles T. and Owen, Megan A. and Batsons, Tammy and Wagner, Nate and Cutting, Amy and Nicassio-Hiskey, Nicole and Hash, Amy and Williams, Terrie M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Ursids are the largest mammals to retain a plantigrade posture. This primitive posture has been proposed to result in reduced locomotor speed and economy relative to digitigrade and unguligrade species, particularly at high speeds. Previous energetics research on polar bears (Ursus maritimus) found locomotor costs were more than double predictions for similarly sized quadrupedal mammals, which could be a result of their plantigrade posture or due to adaptations to their Arctic marine existence. To evaluate whether polar bears are representative of terrestrial ursids or distinctly uneconomical walkers, this study measured the mass-specific metabolism, overall dynamic body acceleration, and gait kinematics of polar bears and grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) trained to rest and walk on a treadmill. At routine walking speeds, we found polar bears and grizzly bears exhibited similar costs of locomotion and gait kinematics, but differing measures of overall dynamic body acceleration. Minimum cost of transport while walking in the two species (2.21 J kg(-1) m(-1)) was comparable to predictions for similarly sized quadrupedal mammals, but these costs doubled (4.42 J kg(-1) m(-1)) at speeds >= 5.4 km h(-1).

article,"X-ray computed tomography study of the flight-adapted tracheal system in the blowfly <i>Calliphora vicina</i>, analysing the ventilation mechanism and flow-directing valves","Wasserthal, Lutz Thilo and Cloetens, Peter and Fink, Rainer H. and Wasserthal, Lennard Knut",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Following the discovery of flight motor-driven unidirectional gas exchange with rising P-O2 in the blowfly, X-ray computed tomography (CT) was used to visualize the organization of the tracheal system in the anterior body with emphasis on the arrangement of the pathways for airflow. The fly's head is preferentially supplied by cephalic tracheae originating from the ventral orifice of the mesothoracic spiracle (Sp1). The respiratory airflow during flight is a by-product of cyclic deformations of the thoracic box by the flight muscles. The air sacs below the tergal integument (scutum and scutellum) facilitate the respiratory airflow: the shortening of the thorax turns the scutellum and the wings downward and the scutum upward with a volume increase in the scutal air sacs. The resulting negative pressure sucks air from Sp1 through special tracheae towards the scutal air sacs. The airflow is directed by two valves that open alternately: (1) the hinged filter flaps of the metathoracic spiracles (Sp2) are passively pushed open during the upstroke by the increased tracheal pressure, thereby enabling expiration; (2) a newly described tracheal valve-like septum behind the regular spiracular valve lids of Sp1 opens passively and air is sucked in through Spl during the downstroke and prevents expiration by closing during the upstroke. This stabilizes the unidirectional airflow. The tracheal volume of the head, thorax and abdomen and their mass were determined. Despite the different anatomy of birds and flies, the unidirectional airflow reveals a comparable efficiency of the temporal throughput in flies and hummingbirds.",2018,10.1242/jeb.176024,221,12,NA,jeb176024,Tracheae; Spiracles; Auto-ventilation; Synchrotron; X-ray imaging; Micro-tomography; Insect respiration; Gas exchange
article,Blood flow for bone remodelling correlates with locomotion in living and extinct birds,"Allan, Georgina H. and Cassey, Phillip and Snelling, Edward P. and Maloney, Shane K. and Seymour, Roger S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Nutrient arteries enter limb bones through discrete foramina on the shafts. They are required for bone remodelling in response to mechanical loading and dynamic forces imposed by locomotion. The cross-sectional area of the nutrient foramen of the femur represents an index of blood flow rate to the shaft and thus provides insight into the animal's level of activity. Morphometric data on femoral length, mass and foramen size from 100 extant bird species and eight extinct moa species were analysed allometrically and phylogenetically. The nutrient foramen blood flow index (Q(i)) and femur mass (M-f) increase with body mass (M-b). At 1 kg body mass, cursorial species have approximately 2.1 times higher Q(i) and 1.9 times heavier M-f than volant species. The scaling of Q(i) on M-f is independent of the primary mode of locomotion, but the ratio Q(i)/M-f decreases significantly in larger birds, although absolute Q(i) increases. The overall avian equation for Q(i) on M-b is not significantly different from previous data from mammals, but when differences in blood pressure are accounted for, estimated blood flow to the femur is approximately 1.9 times higher in cursorial birds than in mammals, possibly in relation to bipedalism and quadrupedalism, respectively. Femoral bone blood flow in both endothermic groups is estimated to be 50-100 times higher than in ectothermic reptiles.",2014,10.1242/jeb.102889,217,16,2956-2962,NA,Bird; Locomotion; Blood flow; Bone remodelling; Nutrient foramen; Allometry
article,Multitasking in an eye: the unusual organization of the <i>Thermonectus marmoratus</i> principal larval eyes allows for far and near vision and might aid in depth perception,"Stowasser, Annette and Buschbeck, Elke K.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Very few visual systems diverge fundamentally from the basic plans of well-studied animal eyes. However, investigating those that do can provide novel insights into visual system function. A particularly unusual system exists in the principal larval eyes of a visually guided aquatic predator, the sunburst diving beetle, Thermonectus marmoratus (Coleoptera: Dystiscidae). These eyes are characterized by complex layered distal and proximal retinas. We previously reported that their principal eye E2 has a bifocal lens, and previous behavioral experiments suggested that these larvae have a unilateral range-finding mechanism that may involve their bizarre eye organization. In the present study, we expanded our optical measurements and found that: (1) E1 also has a bifocal lens, (2) E1 is best suited for far vision while E2 is best suited for near vision and (3) throughout their typical hunting range, the positions of focused images shift across specific retinal layers. This anatomical and optical organization in principle could support unilateral range finding. Taken together, our findings outline an unusual visual mechanism that is likely to be essential for the extraordinary hunting ability of these larvae.",2014,10.1242/jeb.098624,217,14,2509-2516,NA,Stemmata; Prey capture; Predator; Range finding; Distance vision; Insect
article,Differences in contractile behaviour between the soleus and medial gastrocnemius muscles during human walking,"Cronin, Neil J. and Avela, Janne and Finni, Taija and Peltonen, Jussi",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The functional roles of individual lower limb muscles during human walking may differ depending on walking speed or duration. In this study, 11 volunteers walked on a treadmill for 60. min at speeds corresponding to both optimal and 20\% above optimal energetic cost of transport whilst oxygen consumption and medial gastrocnemius (MG) and soleus fascicle lengths were measured. Although energetic cost of transport was similar to 12\% higher at the faster speed, it remained constant over 60. min at both speeds, suggesting that humans can walk for prolonged periods at a range of speeds without compromising energetic efficiency. The fascicles of both muscles exhibited rather `isometric' behaviour during the early to mid stance phase of walking, which appears to be independent of walking speed or movement efficiency. However, several functional differences were observed between muscles. MG exhibited time- and speed-dependent decreases in operating length, and shortened faster during the pushoff phase at the faster walking speed. Conversely, soleus exhibited consistent contractile behaviour regardless of walking speed or duration, and always shortened slower than MG during pushoff. Soleus appears to play a more important functional role than MG during walking. This may be especially true when walking for prolonged periods or at speeds above the most energetically efficient, where the force potential and thus the functional importance of MG appears to decline.",2013,10.1242/jeb.078196,216,5,909-914,NA,muscle fascicle; human locomotion; efficiency; ultrasound; automatic tracking
article,Drosophila melanogaster sperm turn more oxidative in the female,"Wetzker, Cornelia and Froschauer, Christin and Massino, Christian and Reinhardt, Klaus",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Males and females of many species store sperm for extended periods. During storage, sperm are predicted to undergo cellular and functional changes, especially towards glycolytic energy metabolism because oxygen radicals derived from oxidative phosphorylation can affect sperm motility and fertilisation ability. However, not all species can use both major energy metabolism pathways. Here, we examined the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and asked whether sperm metabolism can be fuelled by both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, and to what extent metabolism changes during storage. Inhibiting glycolysis in vitro led to a more oxidative state of sperm; inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation increased the glycolytic component, assessed by multi-photon autofluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of NAD(P)H. We further examined sperm in male and female sperm storage organs using FLIM of NAD(P)H and FAD. In intact storage organs, we found that, unexpectedly, (i) sperm were more oxidative in females than in males, and (ii) oxidative phosphorylation increased with storage duration in females.

article,"Selective breeding for high voluntary exercise in mice increases maximal ((V)over dot<sub>O2,max</sub>) but not basal metabolic rate","Schwartz, Nicole E. and McNamara, Monica P. and Orozco, Jocelyn M. and Rashid, Jaanam O. and Thai, Angie P. and Garland, Jr., Theodore",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In general, sustained high rates of physical activity require a high maximal aerobic capacity ((V)over dot(O2,max)), which may also necessitate a high basal aerobic metabolism (BMR), given that the two metabolic states are linked via shared organ systems, cellular properties and metabolic pathways. We tested the hypotheses that (a) selective breeding for high voluntary exercise in mice would elevate both (V)over dot(O2,max) and BMR, and (b) these increases are accompanied by increases in the size of some internal organs (ventricle, triceps surae muscle, liver, kidney, spleen, lung, brain). We measured 72 females from generations 88 and 96 of an ongoing artificial selection experiment comprising four replicate High Runner (HR) lines bred for voluntary daily wheel-running distance and four non-selected control lines. With body mass as a covariate, HR lines as a group had significantly higher (V)over dot(O2,max) (+13.6\%, P<0.0001), consistent with previous studies, but BMR did not significantly differ between HR and control lines (+6.5\%, P=0.181). Additionally, HR mice did not statistically differ from control mice for whole-body lean or fat mass, or for the mass of any organ collected (with body mass as a covariate). Finally, mass-independent (V)over dot(O2,max) and BMR were uncorrelated (r=0.073, P=0.552) and the only statistically significant correlation with an organ mass was for (V)over dot(O2,max) and ventricle mass (r=0.285, P=0.015).

However, the respective mechanisms are incompletely understood. In the context of their analysis, animal model systems, specifically rodent treadmill running protocols, playan important role.

Here, we analyzed physiological adaptation to 10 weeks of regular, moderate-intensity, uphill treadmill running inmice, awidely usedmodel for endurance exercise training. To study the effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which have been suggested to be major regulators of training adaptation, a subgroup of mice was treated with the ROS scavenger PDTC (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate). We found that mass gain in mice that exercised under PDTC treatment lagged behind that of all other experimental groups. In addition, both exercise and PDTC significantly and additively decreased resting heart rate. Furthermore, there was a trend towards an enhanced proportion of type 2A skeletal muscle fibers and differential expression of metabolism-associated genes, indicating metabolic and functional adaptation of skeletalmuscle fibers. By contrast, therewere no effects on grip strength and relative mass of individual muscles, suggesting that our protocol of uphill running did not increase skeletal muscle hypertrophyandstrength.

article,Internal state transition to switch behavioral strategies in cricket phonotaxis,"Hommaru, Naoto and Shidara, Hisashi and Ando, Noriyasu and Ogawa, Hiroto",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Animals employ multiple behavioral strategies for exploring food and mating partners based on both their internal state and external environment. Here, we examined how cricket phonotaxis, which was considered an innate reactive behavior of females to approach the calling song of conspecific males, depended on these internal and external conditions. Our observation revealed that the phonotaxis process consisted of two distinctive phases: wandering and approaching. In the latter phase, crickets moved directly towards the sound source. The transition into this phase, referred to as the `approach phase', was based on changes in the animal's internal state. Moreover, retention of the approach phase required recognition of the calling song, while song loss downregulated cricket mobility and induced frequent stopping. This is a typical movement in local search behaviors.

article,Maternal exercise before and during gestation modifies liver and muscle mitochondria in rat offspring,"Siti, Farida and Dubouchaud, Herve and Hininger, Isabelle and Quiclet, Charline and Vial, Guillaume and Galinier, Anne and Casteilla, Louis and Fontaine, Eric and Batandier, Cecile and Couturier, Karine",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"It is now well established that the intrauterine environment is of major importance for offspring health during later life. Endurance training during pregnancy is associated with positive metabolic adjustments and beneficial effects on the balance between pro-oxidants and antioxidants (redox state) in the offspring. Our hypothesis was that these changes could rely on mitochondrial adaptations in the offspring due to modifications of the fetal environment induced by maternal endurance training. Therefore, we compared the liver and skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and the redox status of young rats whose mothers underwent moderate endurance training (treadmill running) before and during gestation (T) with those of young rats from untrained mothers (C). Our results show a significant reduction in the spontaneous H2O2 release by liver and muscle mitochondria in the T versus C offspring (P<0.05). These changes were accompanied by alterations in oxygen consumption. Moreover, the percentage of short-chain fatty acids increased significantly in liver mitochondria from T offspring. This may lead to improvements in the fluidity and the flexibility of the membrane. In plasma, glutathione peroxidase activity and protein oxidation were significantly higher in T offspring than in C offspring (P<0.05). Such changes in plasma could represent an adaptive signal transmitted from mothers to their offspring. We thus demonstrated for the first time, to our knowledge, that it is possible to act on bioenergetic function including alterations of mitochondrial function in offspring by modifying maternal physical activity before and during pregnancy. These changes could be crucial for the future health of the offspring.",2019,10.1242/jeb.194969,222,10,NA,jeb194969,Endurance training; Intrauterine environment; Oxidative phosphorylation; Offspring
article,Oxidation of linoleic and palmitic acid in pre-hibernating and hibernating common noctule bats revealed by <SUP>13</SUP>C breath testing,"Rosner, Elisabeth and Voigt, Christian C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Mammals fuel hibernation by oxidizing saturated and unsaturated fatty acids from triacylglycerols in adipocytes, yet the relative importance of these two categories as an oxidative fuel may change during hibernation. We studied the selective use of fatty acids as an oxidative fuel in noctule bats (Nyctalus noctula). Prehibernating noctule bats that were fed C-13-enriched linoleic acid (LA) showed 12 times higher tracer oxidation rates compared with conspecifics fed C-13-enriched palmitic acid (PA). After this experiment, we supplemented the diet of bats with the same fatty acids on five subsequent days to enrich their fat depots with the respective tracer. We then compared the excess C-13-enrichment (excess atom percentage, APE) in breath of bats for torpor and arousal events during early and late hibernation. We observed higher APE values in breath of bats fed C-13-enriched LA than in bats fed C-13-enriched PA for both states (torpor and arousal), and also for both periods. Thus, hibernating bats selectively oxidized endogenous LA instead of PA, probably because of faster transportation rates of polyunsaturated fatty acids compared with saturated fatty acids. We did not observe changes in APE values in the breath of torpid animals between early and late hibernation. Skin temperature of torpid animals increased by 0.7 degrees C between early and late hibernation in bats fed PA, whereas it decreased by -0.8 degrees C in bats fed LA, highlighting that endogenous LA may fulfil two functions when available in excess: serving as an oxidative fuel and supporting cell membrane functionality.",2018,10.1242/jeb.168096,221,4,NA,jeb168096,Hibernation; Fatty acid metabolism; Bats
article,Aerobic power and flight capacity in birds: a phylogenetic test of the heart-size hypothesis,"Nespolo, Roberto F. and Gonzalez-Lagos, Cesar and Solano-Iguaran, Jaiber J. and Elfwing, Magnus and Garitano-Zavala, Alvaro and Manosa, Santiago and Carlos Alonso, Juan and Altimiras, Jordi",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Flight capacity is one of the most important innovations in animal evolution; it only evolved in insects, birds, mammals and the extinct pterodactyls. Given that powered flight represents a demanding aerobic activity, an efficient cardiovascular system is essential for the continuous delivery of oxygen to the pectoral muscles during flight. It is well known that the limiting step in the circulation is stroke volume (the volume of blood pumped from the ventricle to the body during each beat), which is determined by the size of the ventricle. Thus, the fresh mass of the heart represents a simple and repeatable anatomical measure of the aerobic power of an animal. Although several authors have compared heart masses across bird species, a phylogenetic comparative analysis is still lacking. By compiling heart sizes for 915 species and applying several statistical procedures controlling for body size and/or testing for adaptive trends in the dataset (e.g. model selection approaches, phylogenetic generalized linear models), we found that (residuals of) heart size is consistently associated with four categories of flight capacity. In general, our results indicate that species exhibiting continuous hovering flight (i.e. hummingbirds) have substantially larger hearts than other groups, species that use flapping flight and gliding show intermediate values, and that species categorized as poor flyers show the smallest values. Our study reveals that on a broad scale, routine flight modes seem to have shaped the energetic requirements of birds sufficiently to be anatomically detected at the comparative level.",2018,10.1242/jeb.162693,221,1,NA,jeb175208,Comparative phylogenetics; Cardiovascular system; Stroke volume; Aves; Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models
article,Effects of a social cue on reproductive development and pre-alternate molt in seasonally breeding migrant and resident female songbirds (<i>Zonotrichia leucophrys</i>),"Chmura, Helen E. and Meddle, Simone L. and Wingfield, John C. and Hahn, Thomas P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"To time reproduction optimally, birds have evolved diverse mechanisms by which they respond to environmental changes that help them anticipate and prepare for the breeding season. While residents initiate reproductive preparation and breed in the same geographic location, migrant birds simultaneously prepare for breeding and migration far from their breeding grounds. As a result, it is hypothesized that migrant and resident birds use environmental cues differently to prepare to breed and that there is adaptive specialization in mechanisms regulating reproductive preparation. Specifically, residents are expected to rely more on non-photic cues (e.g. food, temperature, social cues) than migrants. We tested this general prediction using a social cue manipulation. First, we compared the effects of subspecies-appropriate recorded male song on reproductive development in migrants and residents on a naturally increasing photoperiod. Second, we tested the sensitivity of migrant-specific life history events (fattening and pre-alternate molt) to song treatment. After 82 days, residents had higher luteinizing hormone and greater ovarian development than migrants, but song treatment had no effect on these metrics in either subspecies. Song advanced pre-alternate molt but had no effect on fattening in migrants. While our study does not support specialization in social cue use in migrants and residents, it is consistent with findings in the literature of specialization in photoperiodic response. It also demonstrates for the first time that social cues can influence molt in a migrant species. Additional findings from a pilot study looking at responses to a live male suggest it is important to test other kinds of social cues.",2017,10.1242/jeb.160994,220,16,2947-2956,NA,Migration; Reproduction; Song; Phenology; Avian; Seasonal timing
article,Heart rate dynamics in a marsupial hibernator,"Swoap, Steven J. and Kortner, Gerhard and Geiser, Fritz",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The eastern pygmy possum (Cercartetus nanus) is a small marsupial that can express spontaneous short bouts of torpor, as well as multi-day bouts of deep hibernation. To examine heart rate (f(H)) control at various stages of torpor in a marsupial hibernator, and to see whether fH variability differs from that of deep placental hibernators, we used radiotelemetry to measure ECG and body temperature (T-b) while measuring the rate of O-2 consumption and ventilation. f(H) and O-2 consumption rate during euthermia were at a minimum (321 +/- 34 beats min(-1), 0.705 +/- 0.048 ml O-2 g(-1) h(-1)) at an ambient temperature (T-a) of 31 degrees C. f(H) had an inverse linear relationship with T-a to a maximum of 630 +/- 19 beats min(-1) at a T-a of 20 degrees C. During entry into torpor at a Ta of 20 degrees C, f(H) slowed primarily as a result of episodic periods of cardiac activity where electrical activity of the heart occurred in groups of 3 or 4 heart beats. When T-b was stable at 24 degrees C in these torpor bouts, the episodic nature of f(H) had disappeared (i.e. no asystoles) with a rate of 34 +/- 3 beats min(-1). For multi-day bouts of deep torpor, T-a was lowered to 6.6 +/- 0.8 degrees C. During these deep bouts of torpor, T-b reached a minimum of 8.0 +/- 1.0 degrees C, with a minimum fH of 8 beats min(-1) and a minimum O-2 consumption rate of 0.029 +/- 0.07 ml O-2 g(-1) h(-1). Shivering bouts occurred in deep torpor about every 8 min, during which ventilation occurred, and f(H) was elevated to 40 beats min(-1). The duration of the QRS complex increased from 12 ms during euthermia to 69 ms at a Tb of 8 degrees C. These findings demonstrate the dynamic functioning range of f(H) to be about 600 beats min(-1) (similar to 80-fold), one of the largest known ranges in mammals. Our study shows that despite a separation of similar to 160 million years, the control and function of the cardiac system seems indistinguishable in marsupial and placental hibernating mammals.",2017,10.1242/jeb.155879,220,16,2939-2946,NA,Torpor; Hibernation; Cardiac; ECG; Metabolism
article,Mutualistic damselfish induce higher photosynthetic rates in their host coral,"Garcia-Herrera, Nur and Ferse, Sebastian C. A. and Kunzmann, Andreas and Genin, Amatzia",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Coral reefs are amongst the most diverse ecosystems on Earth where complex inter-specific interactions are ubiquitous. An example of such interactions is the mutualistic relationship between damselfishes and branching corals in the Northern Red Sea, where the fish use corals as shelter and provide them with nutrients, enhance the flow between their branches, and protect them from predators. By enhancing the flow between the coral branches, the fish ventilate the coral's inner zone, mitigating hypoxic conditions that otherwise develop within that zone during the night. Here, we tested, for the first time, the effects of the damselfish Dascyllus marginatus on photosynthesis and respiration in its host coral Stylophora pistillata. Laboratory experiments using an intermittent-flow respirometer showed that the presence of fish between the coral branches under light conditions augmented the coral's photosynthetic rate. No effect on the coral's respiration was found under dark conditions. When a fish was allowed to enter the inner zone of a dead coral skeleton, its respiration was higher than when it was in a live coral. Field observations indicated that damselfish were present between coral branches 18-34\% of the time during daylight hours and at all times during the night. Considering the changes induced by the fish together with the proportion of time they were found between coral branches in the field, the effect of the fish amounted to an augmentation of 3-6\% of the coral's daily photosynthesis. Our findings reveal a previously unknown positive contribution of coral-dwelling fish to their host's photosynthesis.",2017,10.1242/jeb.152462,220,10,1803-1811,NA,Dascyllus; Mutualism; Physiology; Red Sea; Respiration; Stylophora

We tested for differences in colour change in response to background colour and light intensity in two populations of central bearded dragon lizards (Pogona vitticeps) representing the extremes in body coloration and geographical range. We found that bearded dragons change colour in response to various backgrounds and that colour change is affected by illumination intensity. Within-individual colour change was similar in magnitude in the two populations but varied between backgrounds. However, at the endpoints of colour change, each population showed greater similarity to backgrounds that were representative of the local habitat compared with the other population, indicating local adaptation to visual backgrounds. Our results suggest that even in species that change colour, both phenotypic plasticity and geographic divergence of coloration may contribute to improved camouflage.",2017,10.1242/jeb.148544,220,6,1048-1055,NA,Animal coloration; Camouflage; Predator avoidance; Phenotypic plasticity; Local adaptation
article,<i>In situ</i> cardiac perfusion reveals interspecific variation of intraventricular flow separation in reptiles,"Joyce, William and Axelsson, Michael and Altimiras, Jordi and Wang, Tobias",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The ventricles of non-crocodilian reptiles are incompletely divided and provide an opportunity for mixing of oxygen-poor blood and oxygen-rich blood (intracardiac shunting). However, both cardiac morphology and in vivo shunting patterns exhibit considerable interspecific variation within reptiles. In the present study, we develop an in situ double-perfused heart approach to characterise the propensity and capacity for shunting in five reptile species: the turtle Trachemys scripta, the rock python Python sebae, the yellow anaconda Eunectes notaeus, the varanid lizard Varanus exanthematicus and the bearded dragon Pogona vitticeps. To simulate changes in vascular bed resistance, pulmonary and systemic afterloads were independently manipulated and changes in blood flow distribution amongst the central outflow tracts were monitored. As previously demonstrated in Burmese pythons, rock pythons and varanid lizards exhibited pronounced intraventricular flow separation. As pulmonary or systemic afterload was raised, flow in the respective circulation decreased. However, flow in the other circulation, where afterload was constant, remained stable. This correlates with the convergent evolution of intraventricular pressure separation and the large intraventricular muscular ridge, which compartmentalises the ventricle, in these species. Conversely, in the three other species, the pulmonary and systemic flows were strongly mutually dependent, such that the decrease in pulmonary flow in response to elevated pulmonary afterload resulted in redistribution of perfusate to the systemic circuit (and vice versa). Thus, in these species, the muscular ridge appeared labile and blood could readily transverse the intraventricular cava. We conclude that relatively minor structural differences between non-crocodilian reptiles result in the fundamental changes in cardiac function. Further, our study emphasises that functionally similar intracardiac flow separation evolved independently in lizards (varanids) and snakes (pythons) from an ancestor endowed with the capacity for large intracardiac shunts.",2016,10.1242/jeb.139543,219,14,2220-2227,NA,Cardiovascular; Cardiac shunting; Reptile; Blood flow; Perfused heart

David and Drijfhout, Falko P. and da Cruz-Landim, Carminda",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Most advanced eusocial bees recruit their nest mates to food resources. Recent studies in Meliponini species have revealed that the cephalic salivary (labial) glands (CSGs) are responsible for the production of scent trail pheromones. Studies on CSGs have shown that changes occur in worker glandular cell morphology from emergence from brood combs until forager phase, which may be correlated to changes in the composition of the CSG secretion. However, the composition of the CSG secretion and the chemical changes that occur in it according to the worker's life phase or tasks performed are unknown for many species, including Scaptotrigona postica. In this study, the chemical profile of CSG secretion in S. postica workers was studied. Glands were taken from specimens that were newly emerged (NE), working in the brood comb area (CA) and foraging (FO), and were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results showed that the glandular secretion consists of oxygenated compounds of middle volatility (acids, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters and ether), and their quantity varies among the different life phases, increasing as the individual moves fromintra- to extra-colonial activities. The NE phase contained the smallest variety and quantity of compounds. Because of the variability of compounds, the CA workers were separated into three subgroups according to the chemical constitution of their secretion. Forager workers showed the largest quantity and variety of chemical compounds. The major compounds in forager gland secretion were 7-hexadecen-1-yl acetate and 5-tetradecen-1-yl acetate. Statistical analysis indicates that the chemical composition of glandular secretion is phase related.",2015,10.1242/jeb.124180,218,17,2738-2744,NA,GC-MS; Ester; Labial glands; Life phases; Multivariate statistics; Stingless bee
article,Hydrodynamics and energetics of jumping copepod nauplii and copepodids,"Wadhwa, Navish and Andersen, Anders and Kiorboe, Thomas",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Within its life cycle, a copepod goes through drastic changes in size, shape and swimming mode. In particular, there is a stark difference between the early (nauplius) and later (copepodid) stages. Copepods inhabit an intermediate Reynolds number regime (between similar to 1 and 100) where both viscosity and inertia are potentially important, and the Reynolds number changes by an order of magnitude during growth. Thus we expect the life stage related changes experienced by a copepod to result in hydrodynamic and energetic differences, ultimately affecting the fitness. To quantify these differences, we measured the swimming kinematics and fluid flow around jumping Acartia tonsa at different stages of its life cycle, using particle image velocimetry and particle tracking velocimetry. We found that the flow structures around nauplii and copepodids are topologically different, with one and two vortex rings, respectively. Our measurements suggest that copepodids cover a larger distance compared to their body size in each jump and are also hydrodynamically quieter, as the flow disturbance they create attenuates faster with distance. Also, copepodids are energetically more efficient than nauplii, presumably due to the change in hydrodynamic regime accompanied with a well-adapted body form and swimming stroke.",2014,10.1242/jeb.105676,217,17,3085-3094,NA,Copepodids; Nauplii; Reynolds number; Swimming; Velocimetry; Energy dissipation

S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Marine mammal foraging behaviour inherently depends on diving ability. Declining populations of Steller sea lions may be facing nutritional stress that could affect their diving ability through changes in body composition or metabolism. Our objective was to determine whether nutritional stress (restricted food intake resulting in a 10\% decrease in body mass) altered the calculated aerobic dive limit (cADL) of four captive sea lions diving in the open ocean, and how this related to changes in observed dive behaviour. We measured diving metabolic rate (DMR), blood O-2 stores, body composition and dive behaviour prior to and while under nutritional restriction. We found that nutritionally stressed sea lions increased the duration of their single long dives, and the proportion of time they spent at the surface during a cycle of four dives. Nutritionally stressed sea lions lost both lipid and lean mass, resulting in potentially lower muscle O-2 stores. However, total body O-2 stores increased due to rises in blood O-2 stores associated with having higher blood volumes. Nutritionally stressed sea lions also had higher mass-specific metabolic rates. The greater rise in O-2 stores relative to the increase in mass-specific DMR resulted in the sea lions having a longer cADL when nutritionally stressed. We conclude that there was no negative effect of nutritional stress on the diving ability of sea lions. However, nutritional stress did lower foraging efficiency and require more foraging time to meet energy requirements due to increases in diving metabolic rates and surface recovery times.",2014,10.1242/jeb.089599,217,5,769-778,NA,Steller sea lion; Blood volume; Nutritional stress; Diving metabolism; Oxygen store; Dive behaviour

Colour reversibility has many different functions in animals, such as thermoregulation, crypsis through background matching and social interactions. However, the mechanisms underlying reversible colour changes are yet to be thoroughly investigated. This study aims to determine the environmental and hormonal factors underlying morphological colour changes in Thomisus onustus crab spiders and the biochemical metabolites produced during these changes. We quantified the dynamics of colour changes over time: spiders were kept in yellow and white containers under natural light conditions and their colour was measured over 15. days using a spectrophotometer. We also characterised the chemical metabolites of spiders changing to a yellow colour using HPLC. Hormonal control of colour change was investigated by injecting 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) into spiders. We found that background colouration was a major environmental factor responsible for colour change in crab spiders: individuals presented with white and yellow backgrounds changed to white and yellow colours, respectively. An ommochrome precursor, 3-OH-kynurenine, was the main pigment responsible for yellow colour. Spiders injected with 20E displayed a similar rate of change towards yellow colouration as spiders kept in yellow containers and exposed to natural sunlight. This study demonstrates novel hormonal manipulations that are capable of inducing reversible colour change.",2013,10.1242/jeb.086470,216,20,3886-3895,NA,reversible colour change; ommochromes; crypsis; crab spiders

In mammalian muscle, SLN is a small regulatory protein which binds to sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) and uncouples Ca2+ transport from ATP hydrolysis, increasing energy consumption, heat production, and cytosolic Ca2+ transients that signal for mitochondrial biogenesis, fatigue resistance and a shift fatty acid oxidation. Using a photoperiod manipulation of captive gray catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis), we investigated whether SLN may play a role in coordinating the development of the migratory phenotype. In response to long-day photostimulation, catbirds demonstrated migratory restlessness and significant body fat stores, alongside higher SLN transcription while SERCA2 remained constant. SLN transcription was strongly correlated with h-FABP and PGC1 alpha transcription, as well as fat mass. However, SLN was not significantly correlated with HOAD or CD36 transcripts measurements of SERCA activity, SR membrane Ca2+ leak, Ca2+ uptake rates, pumping efficiency or mitochondrial biogenesis. Therefore, SLN may be involved in the process of storing fat and shifting to fat as a fuel, but the mechanism of its involvement remains unclear.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246897,227,1,NA,jeb246897,Migration; Physiology; SERCA; Sarcolipin; Photoperiod; Calcium signaling

article,"Urban ecophysiology: beyond costs, stress and biomarkers","Isaksson, Caroline",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Natural habitats are rapidly declining due to urbanisation, with a concomitant decline in biodiversity in highly urbanised areas. Yet thousands of different species have colonised urban environments. These organisms are exposed to novel urban conditions, which are sometimes beneficial, but most often challenging, such as increased ambient temperature, chemicals, noise and light pollution, dietary alterations and disturbance by humans. Given the fundamental role of physiological responses in coping with such conditions, certain physiological systems such as the redox system, metabolism and hormones are thought to specifically influence organisms' ability to persist and cope with urbanisation. However, these physiological systems often show mixed responses to urbanisation. Does this mean that some individuals, populations or species are resilient to the urban environmental challenges? Or is something missing from our analyses, leading us to erroneous conclusions regarding the impact of urbanisation? To understand the impact of urbanisation, I argue that a more integrated mechanistic and ecological approach is needed, along with experiments, in order to fully understand the physiological responses; without knowledge of their ecological and evolutionary context, physiological measures alone can be misinterpreted. Furthermore, we need to further investigate the causes of and capacity for individual plasticity in order to understand not only the impact of urbanisation, but also species resilience. I argue that abiotic and biotic urban factors can interact (e.g. pollution with micro- and macronutrients) to either constrain or relax individual physiological responses - and, thereby, plasticity - on a temporal and/or spatial scale, which can lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the impact of urbanisation.",2020,10.1242/jeb.203794,223,22,NA,jeb203794,Anthropogenic; Endocrinology; Environmental stress; Nutrition; Oxidative stress

Here, we tested the general hypothesis that humans and other mammals selected for vigorous endurance activities evolved derived thoracic features to increase ventilatory capacity. To do so, we investigated whether humans and dogs rely on thoracic motion to increase tidal volume during running to a greater extent than goats, a species that was not selected for endurance locomotion. We found that while all three species use diaphragmatic breathing to increase tidal volume with increasing oxygen demand, humans also use both dorsoventral and mediolateral expansion of the thorax. Dogs use increased dorsoventral expansion of the thorax, representing an intermediate between humans and goats. 3D analyses of joint morphology of 10 species across four mammalian orders also showed that endurance-adapted cursorial species independently evolved more concavoconvex costovertebral joint morphologies that allow for increased rib mobility for thoracic expansion. Evidence for similarly derived concavoconvex costovertebral joints in Homo erectus corresponds with other evidence for the evolution of endurance running in the genus Homo.",2019,10.1242/jeb.189357,222,21,NA,jeb189357,Respiration; Thorax; Human evolution; Ribcage; Bipedalism; Endurance running
article,Ground reaction forces of overground galloping in ridden Thoroughbred racehorses,"Davies, Zoe T. Self and Spence, Andrew J. and Wilson, Alan M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The horse has evolved to gallop economically at high speed. Limb force increases with speed but direct measures of limb ground reaction forces (GRFs) at gallop are sparse. This study reports GRFs for multiple limbs, using force plates, across seven Thoroughbred racehorses during ridden galloping. The results show peak vertical GRF values of 13.6 N kg(-1) (non-lead hindlimb), 12.3 N kg(-1) (lead hindlimb), 14.0 N kg(-1) (non-lead forelimb) and 13.6 N kg(-1) (lead forelimb) at 11.4 m s(-1) and recorded values are consistent with those predicted from duty factor. The distribution of body weight between the forelimbs and hindlimbs is approximated to 50:50, and is variable with speed, unlike the 60:40 commonly stated for cursorial quadrupeds in the literature. An even distribution of load on all limbs may help minimise accumulation of fatigue and assist in injury avoidance. Cranio-caudal force data concur with the observation that horses apply a net accelerative impulse with the hindlimbs and a net decelerative impulse with the forelimbs.

We therefore sought to investigate whether sleep is important for optimizing attention in an invertebrate species, the genetic model Drosophila melanogaster. We developed a high-throughput paradigm to measure visual attention in freely walking Drosophila, using competing foreground/background visual stimuli. We found that whereas sleep-deprived flies could respond normally to either stimulus alone, they were more distracted by background cues in a visual competition task. Other stressful manipulations such as starvation, heat exposure and mechanical stress had no effects on visual attention in this paradigm. In contrast to sleep deprivation, providing additional sleep using the GABA-A agonist 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo-{[}5,4-c]pyridine-3-ol (THIP) did not affect attention in wild-type flies, but specifically improved attention in the learning mutant dunce.

article,Effects of a titin mutation on negative work during stretch-shortening cycles in skeletal muscles,"Hessel, Anthony L. and Nishikawa, Kiisa C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Negative work occurs in muscles during braking movements such as downhill walking or landing after a jump. When performing negative work during stretch-shortening cycles, viscoelastic structures within muscles store energy during stretch, return a fraction of this energy during shortening and dissipate the remaining energy as heat. Because tendons and extracellular matrix are relatively elastic rather than viscoelastic, energy is mainly dissipated by cross bridges and titin. Recent studies demonstrate that titin stiffness increases in active skeletal muscles, suggesting that titin contributions to negative work may have been underestimated in previous studies. The muscular dystrophy with myositis (mdm) mutation in mice results in a deletion in titin that leads to reduced titin stiffness in active muscle, providing an opportunity to investigate the contribution of titin to negative work in stretch-shortening cycles. Using the work loop technique, extensor digitorum longus and soleus muscles from mdm and wild-type (WT) mice were stimulated during the stretch phase of stretch-shortening cycles to investigate negative work. The results demonstrate that, compared with WT muscles, negative work is reduced in muscles from mdm mice. We suggest that changes in the viscoelastic properties of mdm titin reduce energy storage by muscles during stretch and energy dissipation during shortening. Maximum isometric stress is also reduced in muscles from mdm mice, possibly due to impaired transmission of cross-bridge force, impaired cross-bridge function or both. Functionally, the reduction in negative work could lead to increased muscle damage during eccentric contractions that occur during braking movements.",2017,10.1242/jeb.163204,220,22,4177-4185,NA,Energy storage and dissipation; Force enhancement; Force depression; Negative work; Muscular dystrophy with myositis; Titin/connectin

We then tested this by varying light and temperature to create phenotypes with different growth rates, which resulted in fast growers (5 times larger) having 3 times more vaterite than slow growers.

article,Wings as impellers: honey bees co-opt flight system to induce nest ventilation and disperse pheromones,"Peters, Jacob M. and Gravish, Nick and Combes, Stacey A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Honey bees (Apis mellifera) are remarkable fliers that regularly carry heavy loads of nectar and pollen, supported by a flight system the wings, thorax and flight muscles that one might assume is optimized for aerial locomotion. However, honey bees also use this system to perform other crucial tasks that are unrelated to flight. When ventilating the nest, bees grip the surface of the comb or nest entrance and fan their wings to drive airflow through the nest, and a similar wing-fanning behavior is used to disperse volatile pheromones from the Nasonov gland. In order to understand how the physical demands of these impeller-like behaviors differ from those of flight, we quantified the flapping kinematics and compared the frequency, amplitude and stroke plane angle during these non-flight behaviors with values reported for hovering honey bees. We also used a particle-based flow visualization technique to determine the direction and speed of airflow generated by a bee performing Nasonov scenting behavior. We found that ventilatory fanning behavior is kinematically distinct from both flight and scenting behavior. Both impeller-like behaviors drive flow parallel to the surface to which the bees are clinging, at typical speeds of just under 1 m s(-1). We observed that the wings of fanning and scenting bees frequently contact the ground during the ventral stroke reversal, which may lead to wing wear. Finally, we observed that bees performing Nasonov scenting behavior sometimes display `clap-and-fling' motions, in which the wings contact each other during the dorsal stroke reversal and fling apart at the start of the downstroke. We conclude that the wings and flight motor of honey bees comprise a multifunctional system, which may be subject to competing selective pressures because of its frequent use as both a propeller and an impeller.",2017,10.1242/jeb.149476,220,12,2203-2209,NA,Apis mellifera; Thermoregulation; Flight biomechanics; Fanning behavior; Nasonov scenting
article,Oxidative stress during courtship affects male and female reproductive effort differentially in a wild bird with biparental care,"Montoya, Bibiana and Valverde, Mahara and Rojas, Emilio and Torres, Roxana",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Oxidative stress has been suggested as one of the physiological mechanisms modulating reproductive effort, including investment in mate choice. Here, we evaluated whether oxidative stress influences breeding decisions by acting as a cost of or constraint on reproduction in the brown booby (Sula leucogaster), a long-lived seabird with prolonged biparental care. We found that during courtship, levels of lipid peroxidation (LP) of males and females were positively associated with gular skin color, a trait presumably used in mate choice, while levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were higher as laying approached and in early breeding pairs. Evidence of a constraining effect of oxidative stress for females was suggested by the fact that females with higher ROS during courtship laid smaller first eggs and had chicks with lower rates of body mass gain, and higher female LP was associated with lower offspring attendance time. No evidence of an oxidative cost of parental effort was found; from courtship to parental care, levels of ROS in males and females decreased, and changes in LP levels were non-significant. Finally, using a cross-fostering experiment we found that offspring ROS was unrelated to rearing and genetic parents' ROS. Interestingly, offspring LP was positively associated with the LP during courtship of both the rearing parents and the genetic father, suggesting that offspring LP might have both a genetic and an environmental component. Hence, in the brown booby, oxidative stress may be a cost of investment in reproductive traits before egg laying and constrain females' investment in eggs and parental care.",2016,10.1242/jeb.141325,219,24,3915-3926,NA,Color; Constraint; Cost of reproduction; Life-history trade-off; Parental care
article,"Penguin lungs and air sacs: implications for baroprotection, oxygen stores and buoyancy","Ponganis, P. J. and St Leger, J. and Scadeng, M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The anatomy and volume of the penguin respiratory system contribute significantly to pulmonary baroprotection, the body O-2 store, buoyancy and hence the overall diving physiology of penguins. Therefore, three-dimensional reconstructions from computerized tomographic (CT) scans of live penguins were utilized to measure lung volumes, air sac volumes, tracheobronchial volumes and total body volumes at different inflation pressures in three species with different dive capacities [}Adelie (Pygoscelis adeliae), king (Aptenodytes patagonicus) and emperor (A. forsteri) penguins]. Lung volumes scaled to body mass according to published avian allometrics. Air sac volumes at 30 cm H2O (2.94 kPa) inflation pressure, the assumed maximum volume possible prior to deep dives, were two to three times allometric air sac predictions and also two to three times previously determined end-of-dive total air volumes. Although it is unknown whether penguins inhale to such high volumes prior to dives, these values were supported by (a) body density/buoyancy calculations, (b) prior air volume measurements in free-diving ducks and (c) previous suggestions that penguins may exhale air prior to the final portions of deep dives. Based upon air capillary volumes, parabronchial volumes and tracheobronchial volumes estimated from the measured lung/airway volumes and the only available morphometry study of a penguin lung, the presumed maximum air sac volumes resulted in air sac volume to air capillary/parabronchial/tracheobronchial volume ratios that were not large enough to prevent barotrauma to the non-collapsing, rigid air capillaries during the deepest dives of all three species, and during many routine dives of king and emperor penguins. We conclude that volume reduction of airways and lung air spaces, via compression, constriction or blood engorgement, must occur to provide pulmonary baroprotection at depth. It is also possible that relative air capillary and parabronchial volumes are smaller in these deeper-diving species than in the spheniscid penguin of the morphometry study. If penguins do inhale to this maximum air sac volume prior to their deepest dives, the magnitude and distribution of the body O-2 store would change considerably. In emperor penguins, total body O-2 would increase by 75\%, and the respiratory fraction would increase from 33\% to 61\%. We emphasize that the maximum pre-dive respiratory air volume is still unknown in penguins. However, even lesser increases in air sac volume prior to a dive would still significantly increase the O-2 store. More refined evaluations of the respiratory O-2 store and baroprotective mechanisms in penguins await further investigation of species-specific lung morphometry, start-of-dive air volumes and body buoyancy, and the possibility of air exhalation during dives.",2015,10.1242/jeb.113647,218,5,720-730,NA,Air sac; Barotrauma; Lung; Penguin; Pressure tolerance; Volume
article,Unilateral range finding in diving beetle larvae,"Bland, Kevin and Revetta, Nicholas P. and Stowasser, Annette and Buschbeck, Elke K.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"One of the biggest challenges that predators, such as the larvae of the diving beetle Thermonectus marmoratus (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae), are faced with is to accurately assess the distance of their prey. Most animals derive distance information from disparities of images that are viewed from different angles, from information that is obtained from well-controlled translational movements (motion parallax) or from the image size of known objects. Using a behavioral assay we demonstrated that T. marmoratus larvae continue to accurately strike at artificial prey, even if none of these typical distance estimation cues are available to them. Specifically, we excluded bilateral binocular stereopsis by occlusion, confounded possible motion parallax cues with an artificially moving prey, and excluded the possibility that beetle larvae simply approached their targets based on known prey size by presenting different prey sizes. Despite these constraints, larvae consistently struck our artificial targets from a distance of similar to 4.5 mm. Based on these findings we conclude that T. marmoratus likely employ an unusual mechanism to accurately determine prey distances, possibly mediated by the object-distance-dependent activation of specific subsets of their many-tiered and peculiarly positioned photoreceptors.",2014,10.1242/jeb.092833,217,3,327-330,NA,Insect; Distance estimation; Predator; Vision

Fibres were `skinned' to remove all membranes, leaving the contractile filament array intact and functional. Segments of skinned fibres from these cheetah muscles and from rabbit psoas muscle were activated at 20 degrees C by a temperature-jump protocol. Step and ramp length changes were imposed after active stress had developed. The stiffness of the non-contractile ends of the fibres (series elastic component) was measured at two different stress values in each fibre; stiffness was strongly dependent on stress. Using these stiffness values, the speed of shortening of the contractile component was evaluated, and hence the power it was producing. Fibres were analysed for myosin heavy chain content using gel electrophoresis, and identified as either slow (type I) or fast (type II). The power output of cheetah type II fibre segments was 92.5 +/- 4.3 W kg(-1) (mean +/- s.e., 14 fibres) during shortening at relative stress 0.15 (the stress during shortening/isometric stress). For rabbit psoas fibre segments (presumably type IIX) the corresponding value was significantly higher (P<0.001), 119.7 +/- 6.2 W kg(-1) (mean +/- s.e., 7 fibres). These values are our best estimates of the maximum power output under the conditions used here. Thus, the contractile filament power from cheetah was less than that of rabbit when maximally activated at 20 degrees C, and does not account for the superior locomotor performance of the cheetah.",2013,10.1242/jeb.083667,216,15,2974-2982,NA,energetics; muscle mechanics; rabbit; contraction
article,High muscle mitochondrial volume and aerobic capacity in a small marsupial (<i>Sminthopsis crassicaudata</i>) reveals flexible links between energy-use levels in mammals,"Dawson, Terence J. and Webster, Koa N. and Lee, Enhua and Buttemer, William A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"We investigated the muscle structure-function relationships that underlie the aerobic capacity of an insectivorous, small (similar to 15 g) marsupial, Sminthopsis crassicaudata (Family: Dasyuridae), to obtain further insight into energy use patterns in marsupials relative to those in placentals, their sister clade within the Theria (advanced mammals). Disparate hopping marsupials (Suborder Macropodiformes), a kangaroo (Macropus rufus) and a rat-kangaroo (Bettongia penicillata), show aerobic capabilities as high as those of `athletic' placentals. Equivalent muscle mitochondrial volumes and cardiovascular features support these capabilities. We examined S. crassicaudata to determine whether highly developed aerobic capabilities occur elsewhere in marsupials, rather than being restricted to the more recently evolved Macropodiformes. This was the case. Treadmill-trained S. crassicaudata attained a maximal aerobic metabolic rate ((V) over dot(O2,max) or MMR) of 272 ml O-2 min(-1) kg(-1) (N=8), similar to that reported for a small (similar to 20 g), `athletic' placental, Apodemus sylvaticus, 264 ml O-2 min(-1) kg(-1). Hopping marsupials have comparable aerobic levels when body mass variation is considered. Sminthopsis crassicaudata has a basal metabolic rate (BMR) about 75\% of placental values but it has a notably large factorial aerobic scope (fAS) of 13; elevated fAS also features in hopping marsupials. The (V) over dot(O2,max) of S. crassicaudata was supported by an elevated total muscle mitochondrial volume, which was largely achieved through high muscle mitochondrial volume densities, Vv(mt,f), the mean value being 14.0 +/- 1.33\%. These data were considered in relation to energy use levels in mammals, particularly field metabolic rate (FMR). BMR is consistently lower in marsupials, but this is balanced by a high fAS, such that marsupial MMR matches that of placentals. However, FMR shows different mass relationships in the two clades, with the FMR of small (<125 g) marsupials, such as S. crassicaudata, being higher than that in comparably sized placentals, with the reverse applying for larger marsupials. The flexibility of energy output in marsupials provides explanations for this pattern. Overall, our data refute widely held notions of mechanistically closely linked relationships between body mass, BMR, FMR and MMR in mammals generally.",2013,10.1242/jeb.079087,216,7,1330-1337,NA,aerobic scope; basal metabolism; exercise; field metabolism; maximum metabolism; mitochondria

article,The functional basis for variable antipredatory behavioral strategies in the chameleon <i>Chamaeleo calyptratus</i>,"Drown, Rachel M. and Liebl, Andrea L. and Anderson, V, Christopher",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"To counterbalance demands of different selective pressures, many species possess morphological, physiological and behavioral specializations that increase survival in their environments. Predation is one such pressure that can elicit multiple adaptive responses, and the effectiveness of antipredator behaviors likely vary both by environment and individual across time. Chameleons use multiple antipredator strategies, many of which vary with body size and habitat type. Although their unique morphological and physiological traits produce relatively slow locomotion, which is poorly suited for fleeing, chameleons can also use crypsis or aggression to avoid predation. To examine the functional basis for variable antipredator behavioral responses, we subjected chameleons to a series of mock predation trials and determined how often individuals adopted each antipredator strategy, and then quantified the performance capacities underlying each strategy. In particular, we measured bite force as a determinant for aggression, sprint velocity for fleeing, and degree of color change for crypsis. We found that aggression was predicted by traits associated with higher absolute and relative bite force, as well as habitat type; fleeing was predicted by higher normalized sprint velocity and habitat type; and crypsis was predicted by habitat type, color change capacity in bird color space and the interaction between the two. These results illustrate the importance of considering both functional capacity and environmental context in antipredator behavior decision-making.",2022,10.1242/jeb.242955,225,10,NA,jeb242955,Sprint speed; Bite force; Crypsis; Performance; Predation; Chamaeleonidae
article,Allometry in desert ant locomotion (<i>Cataglyphis albicans</i> and <i>Cataglyphis bicolor</i>) - does body size matter?,"Tross, Johanna and Wolf, Harald and Pfeffer, Sarah Elisabeth",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Desert ants show a large range of adaptations to their habitats. They can reach extremely high running speeds, for example, to shorten heat stress during foraging trips. It has recently been examined how fast walking speeds are achieved in different desert ant species. It is intriguing in this context that some species exhibit distinct intraspecific size differences. We therefore performed a complete locomotion analysis over the entire size spectrum of the species Cataglyphis bicolor, and we compared this intraspecific dataset with that of the allometrically similar species Cataglyphis albicans. Emphasis was on the allometry of locomotion: we considered the body size of each animal and analysed the data in terms of relative walking speed. Body size was observed to affect walking parameters, gait patterns and phase relationships in terms of absolute walking speed. Unexpectedly, on a relative scale, all ants tended to show the same overall locomotion strategy at low walking speeds, and significant differences occurred only between C. albicans and C. bicolor at high walking speeds. Our analysis revealed that C. bicolor ants use the same overall strategy across all body sizes, with small ants reaching the highest walking speeds (up to 80 body lengths s(-1)) by increasing their stride length and incorporating aerial phases. By comparison, C. albicans reached high walking speeds mainly by a high synchrony of leg movement, lower swing phase duration and higher stride frequency ranging up to 40 Hz.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242842,224,18,NA,jeb242842,Desert ant; Insect model; Locomotion strategy; Walking speed; Aerial phases
article,Regional femoral bone blood flow rates in laying and non-laying chickens estimated with fluorescent microspheres,"Hu, Qiaohui and Nelson, Thomas J. and Seymour, Roger S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The metabolic rate of vertebrate bone tissue is related to bone growth, repair and homeostasis, which are all dependent on life stage. Bone metabolic rate is difficult to measure directly, but absolute blood flow rate ((Q) over dot) should reflect local tissue oxygen requirements. A recent `foramen technique' has derived an index of blood flow rate (Q(i)) by measuring nutrient foramen sizes of long bones. Q(i) is assumed to be proportional to (Q) over dot; however, the assumption has never been tested. This study used fluorescent microsphere infusion to measure femoral bone (Q) over dot in anaesthetized non-laying hens, laying hens and roosters. Mean mass-specific cardiac output was 338 +/- 38 ml min(-1) kg(-1), and the two femora received 0.63 +/- 0.10\% of this. Laying hens had higher wet bone mass-specific (Q) over dot to femora (0.23 +/- 0.09 ml min(-1) g(-1)) than the non-laying hens (0.12 +/- 0.06 ml min(-1) g(-1)) and roosters (0.14 +/- 0.04 ml min(-1) g(-1)), presumably associated with higher bone calcium mobilization during eggshell production. Estimated metabolic rate of femoral bone was 0.019 ml O-2 min(-1) g(-1). Femoral (Q) over dot increased significantly with body mass, but was not correlated with nutrient foramen radius (r), probably because of a narrow range in foramen radius. Over all 18 chickens, femoral shaft (Q) over dot/r was 1.07 +/- 0.30 ml min(-1) mm(-1). Mean Q(i) in chickens was significantly higher than predicted by an allometric relationship for adult cursorial bird species, possibly because the birds were still growing.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242597,224,16,NA,jeb242597,Allometry; Bone blood flow; Microsphere infusion; Calcium mobilization; Metabolic rate; Nutrient foramen

S. and Scapigliati, Giuseppe and Knigge, Thomas and Monsinjon, Tiphaine",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Thymus plasticity following gonadectomy or sex hormone replacement has long since exemplified sex hormone effects on the immune system in mammals and, to a lesser extent, in `lower vertebrates', including amphibians and fish. Nevertheless, the underlying physiological significances as well as the ontogenetic establishment of this crosstalk remain largely unknown. Here, we used a teleost fish, the European sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax, to investigate: (1) whether the regulation of thymus plasticity relies on resource trade-off with somatic growth and reproductive investment and (2) if the gonad-thymus interaction takes place during gonadal differentiation and development. Because gonadal development and, supposedly, thymus function in sea bass depend on environmental changes associated with the winter season, we evaluated thymus changes (foxnl expression, and thymocyte and T cell content) in juvenile D. labrax raised for 1 year under either constant or fluctuating photoperiod and temperature. Importantly, in both conditions, intensive gonadal development following sex differentiation coincided with a halt of thymus growth, while somatic growth continued. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing that gonadal development during prepuberty regulates thymus plasticity. This finding may provide an explanation for the initiation of the thymus involution related to ageing in mammals. Comparing fixed and variable environmental conditions, our work also demonstrates that the extent of the effects on the thymus, which are related to reproduction, depend on ecophysiological conditions, rather than being directly related to sexual maturity and sex hormone levels.",2021,10.1242/jeb.238576,224,7,NA,jeb238576,11-Ketotestosterone; 17 beta-Oestradiol T-lymphocyte; Gonadal development; Life history theory; Thymic epithelial cell

These seasonal patterns are often expressed even when insects are kept in captivity, suggesting they are functionally and evolutionarily important. In this study, we examined whether workers of the eusocial bumble bee Bombus impatiens maintained a seasonal signature when kept in captivity. We used an integrative approach and compared worker egg laying, ovarian activation, body size and mass, lipid content in the fat body, cold tolerance and expression of genes related to cold tolerance, metabolism and stress throughout colony development. We found that bumble bee worker physiology and gene expression patterns shift from reproductive-like to diapause-like as the colony ages. Workers eclosing early in the colony cycle had increased egg laying and ovarian activation, and reduced cold tolerance, body size, mass and lipid content in the fat body, in line with a reproductive-like profile, while late-eclosing workers exhibited the opposite characteristics. Furthermore, expression patterns of genes associated with reproduction and diapause differed between early- and late-eclosing workers, partially following the physiological patterns. We suggest that a seasonal signature, innate to individual workers, the queen or the colony, is used by workers as a social cue determining the phenology of the colony and discuss possible implications for understanding reproductive division of labor in bumble bee colonies and the evolutionary divergence of female castes in the genus Bombus.",2020,10.1242/jeb.218768,223,9,NA,jeb218768,Caste; Cold tolerance; Gene expression; Reproduction; Seasonality; Social insects

Eusocial insects have large colonies where individuals experience a large number of social interactions with nest mates during all life stages, making them excellent candidates for understanding the effects of social isolation on brain development and behaviour. Here, we used the honey bee Apis mellifera to study the effect of social isolation and group size on reward perception and discrimination leaming and memory. We confined day-old adult workers into three different size groups (1, 8 or 32 bees) for 6 days during a critical period associated with adult behavioural maturation. We quantified their sucrose responsiveness, their ability to use and remember olfactory cues to discriminate between sucrose and salt (i.e. discrimination learning), and four biogenic amines in the brain. We found that the smaller the group size, the more responsive a worker was to the sucrose reward. Honey bees raised in groups of 32 performed the best in the learning trials and had the highest levels of dopamine. We found no effect of group size on memory. The observed group size effect on learning but not memory supports the hypothesis that social interactions modulate learning through the dopaminergic system.",2019,10.1242/jeb.193888,222,9,NA,jeb193888,Social behaviour; Eusociality; Social isolation; Biogenic amines; Dopamine; Social interactions
article,Immune challenge-induced oxidative damage may be mitigated by biliverdin,"Baylor, Jessica L. and Butler, Michael W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"An effective immune response results in the elimination of pathogens, but this immunological benefit may be accompanied by increased levels of oxidative damage. However, organisms have evolved mechanisms to mitigate the extent of such oxidative damage, including the production and mobilization of antioxidants. One potential mechanism of mitigating immune challenge-induced changes in oxidative physiology is increasing biliverdin production. Biliverdin is chemically an antioxidant, but within-tissue correlations between biliverdin concentration and oxidative damage have never been directly examined. To test how biliverdin tissue concentrations are associated with physiological responses to an immune challenge, we exposed northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) to one of four treatments: injection of a non-pathogenic antigen - either lipopolysaccharide or phytohemagglutinin, control injection of phosphate-buffered saline or a sham procedure with no injection. Twenty-four hours later, we quantified oxidative damage and triglyceride concentration in the plasma, and biliverdin concentration in the plasma, liver and spleen. We found that both types of immune challenge increased oxidative damage relative to both non-injected and vehicle-injected controls, but treatment had no effects on any other metric. However, across all birds, oxidative damage and biliverdin concentration in the plasma were negatively correlated, which is consistent with a localized antioxidant function of biliverdin. Additionally, we uncovered multiple links between biliverdin concentration, change in mass during the immune challenges and triglyceride levels, suggesting that pathways associated with biliverdin production may also be associated with aspects of nutrient mobilization. Future experiments that manipulate biliverdin levels or oxidative damage directly could establish a systemic antioxidant function or elucidate important physiological impacts on body mass maintenance and triglyceride storage, mobilization or transport.",2019,10.1242/jeb.200055,222,6,NA,jeb200055,LPS; Metabolism; Nutrient; Oxidative stress; PHA; Triglyceride

We propose that theorizing about exercise regulation would benefit from establishing cross-disciplinary bridges to research fields, such as affective psychology and neuroscience, in which changes along the dimension of pleasure-displeasure are considered the main channel via which homeostatic perturbations enter consciousness and dictate corrective action (slowing down or stopping). We hypothesized that ratings of pleasure-displeasure would respond to the severity of homeostatic perturbation and would be related to time to exhaustion during exercise performed at an unsustainable intensity. In a within-subjects experiment (N=15, 13 men and 2 women, age 23.4 +/- 2.2 years; maximal oxygen uptake 46.0 +/- 8.0 ml kg(-1) min(-1)), we compared the slope of ratings of pleasure-displeasure (acquired every 1 min) during cycling exercise at a power output 10\% above critical power until volitional termination under glycogen-loaded and glycogen-depleted conditions. As hypothesized, ratings of pleasure-displeasure declined more steeply under glycogen depletion (P=0.009, d=0.70) and correlated closely with time to exhaustion under both glycogen-loaded (r=0.85; P<0.001) and glycogen-depleted conditions (r=0.83; P<0.001). We conclude that in exercise, as in other domains, changes in pleasure-displeasure may be the main channel via which homeostatic perturbations enter consciousness. This proposal may have important implications for conceptualizing and identifying the neurobiological mechanisms of the sense of exertional physical fatigue.",2019,10.1242/jeb.186585,222,3,NA,jeb186585,Homeostasis; Perceived exertion; Oxygen uptake kinetics; Slow component

Diapause is widespread among insects and plays a key role in enhancing overwinter survival as well as defining the seasonal and geographic distributions of populations. Next-generation sequencing has greatly advanced our understanding of the transcriptional basis for this crucial adaptation but less is known about the regulation of embryonic diapause physiology at the metabolite level. Here, we characterized the lipid and metabolite profiles of embryonic diapause in the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus. We used an untargeted approach to capture the relative abundance of 250 lipids and 241 metabolites. We observed adjustments associated with increased energy storage, including an accumulation of lipids, the formation of larger lipid droplets and increased lipogenesis, as well as metabolite shifts suggesting reduced energy utilization. We also found changes in neuroregulatory- and insulin-associated metabolites with potential roles in diapause regulation. Finally, we detected a group of unidentified, diapause-specific metabolites which have physical properties similar to those of steroids/steroid derivatives and may be associated with the ecdysteroidal regulation of embryonic diapause in A. albopictus.

article,"Dietary antioxidants, but not courtship effort, affect oxidative balance in the testes and muscles of crickets","Simmons, Leigh W. and Lovegrove, Maxine and Lymbery, Samuel J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Recent interest has focused on the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as universal constraints in life-history evolution. Empirical studies have examined the oxidative costs of reproduction for females, with little work conducted on males. The male germline is thought to be particularly susceptible to oxidative damage because the testes, and the sperm themselves, can be prolific producers of ROS. We tested the hypothesis that protection of the male germline from oxidative damage represents a cost of reproduction for males. We fed male crickets, Teleoglyilus oceanicus, with one of two experimental diets in which we manipulated the availability of dietary antioxidants, and we induced variation in their expenditure on courtship effort by manipulating access to females. We measured the total antioxidant capacity, levels of ROS production and the amount of oxidative damage to proteins in both testis and thoracic muscle tissues. Dietary antioxidants contributed to positive oxidative balance in both tissue types. Although the testes had greater antioxidant defences than muscle tissue, they also produced considerably higher levels of ROS and sustained higher levels of oxidative damage. Courtship effort had no impact on any measure of oxidative balance. Our data confirm that the male germline is especially susceptible to oxidative stress and that dietary antioxidants can alleviate this oxidative cost of reproduction.",2018,10.1242/jeb.184770,221,20,NA,jeb184770,Oxidative stress; Fertility; Life-history trade-off; Cost of reproduction; Ejaculate quality
article,HSP90 regulates larval settlement of the bryozoan <i>Bugula neritina</i> through the nitric oxide pathway,"Yang, Xiao-Xue and Zhang, Yu and Wong, Yue-Him and Qian, Pei-Yuan",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The larvae of many sessile marine invertebrates go through a settlement process, during which planktonic larvae attach to a substrate and metamorphose into sessile juveniles. Larval attachment and metamorphosis (herein defined as `settlement') are complex processes mediated by many signalling pathways. Nitric oxide (NO) signalling is one of the pathways that inhibits larval settlement in marine invertebrates across different phyla. NO is synthesized by NO synthase (NOS), which is a client of the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). In the present study, we provide evidence that NO, a gaseous messenger, regulates larval settlement of Bugula neritina. By using pharmacological bioassays and western blotting, we demonstrated that NO inhibits larval settlement of B. neritina and that NO signals occur mainly in the sensory organ of swimming larvae. The settlement rate of B. neritina larvae decreased after heat shock treatment. Inhibition of HSP90 induced larval settlement, and attenuated the inhibition of NO donors during larval settlement. In addition, the expression level of both HSP90 and NOS declined upon settlement. These results demonstrate that HSP90 regulates the larval settlement of B. neritina by interacting with the NO pathway.",2018,10.1242/jeb.167478,221,8,NA,jeb167478,Biofouling; Larval attachment; Larval metamorphosis; NO; Heat shock protein 90

Previous data suggest that this species resembles bears in the preservation of bone mass and biomechanical properties during prolonged passivity and catabolism. This longitudinal study examined the osteological properties of tibiae in farm-bred raccoon dogs that were either fed or fasted (n=6 per group) for a 10 week period. Peripheral quantitative computed tomography was utilized and plasma markers of bone turnover measured before fasting and at 9 weeks followed by mechanical testing (three-point bending), micro-computed tomography and Fourier transform infrared imaging at 10 weeks. Passive wintering with prolonged catabolism (body mass loss 32\%) had no significant effects on bone mineralization, porosity or strength. The concentration of C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen, indicative of bone resorption, increased in the plasma of the fasted raccoon dogs, while the bone formation markers were unchanged. The levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were reduced in the fasted animals. Based on these data, the preservation of bone in wintering raccoon dogs shares characteristics with that of bears with no apparent decrease in the formation of bone but increased resorption. To conclude, raccoon dogs were able to minimize bone loss during a 10 week period of catabolism and passivity.",2017,10.1242/jeb.135475,220,12,2196-2202,NA,Bone mineral density; Bone turnover markers; Catabolism; Fasting; Fourier transform infrared imaging; Hibernation; Nyctereutes procyonoides
article,Deep-diving sea lions exhibit extreme bradycardia in long-duration dives,"McDonald, Birgitte I. and Ponganis, Paul J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Heart rate and peripheral blood flow distribution are the primary determinants of the rate and pattern of oxygen store utilisation and ultimately breath-hold duration in marine endotherms. Despite this, little is known about how otariids (sea lions and fur seals) regulate heart rate (f(H)) while diving. We investigated dive f(H) in five adult female California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) during foraging trips by instrumenting them with digital electrocardiogram (ECG) loggers and time depth recorders. In all dives, dive f(H) (number of beats/duration; 50 +/- 9 beats min(-1)) decreased compared with surface rates (113 +/- 5 beats min(-1)), with all dives exhibiting an instantaneous f(H) below resting (<54 beats min(-1)) at some point during the dive. Both dive f(H) and minimum instantaneous f(H) significantly decreased with increasing dive duration. Typical instantaneous f(H) profiles of deep dives (>100 m) consisted of: (1) an initial rapid decline in f(H) resulting in the lowest instantaneous f(H) of the dive at the end of descent, often below 10 beats min-1 in dives longer than 6 min in duration; (2) a slight increase in f(H) to similar to 10-40 beats min(-1) during the bottom portion of the dive; and (3) a gradual increase in f(H) during ascent with a rapid increase prior to surfacing. Thus, f(H) regulation in deep-diving sea lions is not simply a progressive bradycardia. Extreme bradycardia and the presumed associated reductions in pulmonary and peripheral blood flow during late descent of deep dives should (a) contribute to preservation of the lung oxygen store, (b) increase dependence of muscle on the myoglobin-bound oxygen store, (c) conserve the blood oxygen store and (d) help limit the absorption of nitrogen at depth. This f(H) profile during deep dives of sea lions may be characteristic of deep-diving marine endotherms that dive on inspiration as similar f(H) profiles have been recently documented in the emperor penguin, another deep diver that dives on inspiration.",2014,10.1242/jeb.098558,217,9,1525-1534,NA,Dive response; Otariid; Electrocardiogram; ECG; Heart rate; f(H); Resting; Pinniped
article,Eye-specific detection and a multi-eye integration model of biological motion perception,"De Agro, Massimo and Roessler, Daniela C. and Shamble, Paul S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"`Biological motion' refers to the distinctive kinematics observed in many living organisms, where visually perceivable points on the animal move at fixed distances from each other. Across the animal kingdom, many species have developed specialized visual circuitry to recognize such biological motion and to discriminate it from other patterns. Recently, this ability has been observed in the distributed visual system of jumping spiders. These eight-eyed animals use six eyes to perceive motion, while the remaining two (the principal anterior medial eyes) are shifted across the visual scene to further inspect detected objects. When presented with a biologically moving stimulus and a random one, jumping spiders turn to face the latter, clearly demonstrating the ability to discriminate between them. However, it remains unclear whether the principal eyes are necessary for this behavior, whether all secondary eyes can perform this discrimination, or whether a single eye-pair is specialized for this task. Here, we systematically tested the ability of jumping spiders to discriminate between biological and random visual stimuli by testing each eye-pair alone. Spiders were able to discriminate stimuli only when the anterior lateral eyes were unblocked, and performed at chance levels in other configurations. Interestingly, spiders showed a preference for biological motion over random stimuli - unlike in past work. We therefore propose a new model describing how specialization of the anterior lateral eyes for detecting biological motion contributes to multi-eye integration in this system. This integration generates more complex behavior through the combination of simple, single-eye responses. We posit that this in-built modularity may be a solution to the limited resources of these invertebrates' brains, constituting a novel approach to visual processing.",2024,10.1242/jeb.247061,227,12,NA,jeb247061,Jumping spider; Psychophysics; Life detector; Invertebrate; Vision
article,Evaluating the role of social context and environmental factors in mediating overwintering physiology in honey bees (<i>Apis mellifera</i>),"Quinlan, Gabriela M. and Grozinger, Christina M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In temperate climates, honey bees show strong phenotypic plasticity associated with seasonal changes. In summer, worker bees typically only survive for about a month and can be further classified as young nurse bees (which feed the developing brood) and older forager bees. In winter, brood production and foraging halt and the worker bees live for several months. These differences in task and longevity are reflected in their physiology, with summer nurses and long-lived winter bees typically having large fat bodies, high expression levels of vitellogenin (a longevity-, nutrition- and immune-related gene), and large provisioning glands in their head. The environmental factors (both within the colony and within the surrounding environment) that trigger this transition to long-lived winter bees are poorly understood. One theory is that winter bees are an extended nurse bee state, brought on by a reduction in nursing duties in autumn (i.e. lower brood area). We examined that theory here by assessing nurse bee physiology in both the summer and autumn, in colonies with varying levels of brood. We found that season is a better predictor of nurse bee physiology than brood area. This suggests that seasonal factors beyond brood area, such as pollen availability and colony demography, may be necessary for inducing the winter bee phenotype. This finding furthers our understanding of winter bee biology, which could have important implications for colony management for winter, a critical period for colony survival.",2024,10.1242/jeb.247314,227,8,NA,jeb247314,Autumn; Brood; Fat body; Hypopharyngeal gland; Season; Vitellogenin
article,Metabolomic responses to high-intensity interval exercise in equine skeletal muscle: effects of rest interval duration,"Takahashi, Kenya and Mukai, Kazutaka and Takahashi, Yuji and Ebisuda, Yusaku and Hatta, Hideo and Kitaoka, Yu",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"High -intensity interval training has attracted considerable attention as a time -efficient strategy for inducing physiological adaptations, but the underlying mechanisms have yet to be elucidated. By using metabolomics techniques, we investigated changes in the metabolic network responses in Thoroughbred horses to high -intensity interval exercise performed with two distinct (15 min or 2 min) rest intervals. The peak plasma lactate level was higher during high -intensity exercise with a 2 min rest duration than that with a 15 min rest duration (24.5 +/- 6.8 versus 13.3 +/- 2.7 mmol l-1). The arterial oxygen saturation was lower at the end of all exercise sessions with a 2 min rest duration than that with a 15 min rest duration. Metabolomic analysis of skeletal muscle revealed marked changes in metabolite concentrations in the first and third bouts of the 15 min rest interval conditions. In contrast, there were no metabolite concentrations or pathways that significantly changed during the third bout of exercise performed with a 2 min rest interval. Our findings suggest that the activity of each energy production system is not necessarily reflected by apparent changes in metabolite concentrations, potentially due in part to a better match between metabolite flux into and out of the pathway and cycle, as well as between metabolite production and disposal. This study provides evidence that changes in metabolite concentrations vary greatly depending on the number of repetitions and the length of rest periods between exercises, even if the exercises themselves are identical.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246896,227,4,NA,jeb246896,Metabolomics; High-intensity interval exercise; Thoroughbred; Skeletal muscle
article,Energetics of collective movement in vertebrates,"Zhang, Yangfan and Lauder, George V.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The collective directional movement of animals occurs over both short distances and longer migrations, and is a critical aspect of feeding, reproduction and the ecology of many species. Despite the implications of collective motion for lifetime fitness, we know remarkably little about its energetics. It is commonly thought that collective animal motion saves energy: moving alone against fluid flow is expected to be more energetically expensive than moving in a group. Energetic conservation resulting from collective movement is most often inferred from kinematic metrics or from computational models. However, the direct measurement of total metabolic energy savings during collective motion compared with solitary movement over a range of speeds has yet to be documented. In particular, longer duration and higher speed collective motion must involve both aerobic and non-aerobic (high-energy phosphate stores and substrate-level phosphorylation) metabolic energy contributions, and yet no study to date has quantified both types of metabolic contribution in comparison to locomotion by solitary individuals. There are multiple challenging questions regarding the energetics of collective motion in aquatic, aerial and terrestrial environments that remain to be answered. We focus on aquatic locomotion as a model system to demonstrate that understanding the energetics and total cost of collective movement requires the integration of biomechanics, fluid dynamics and bioenergetics to unveil the hydrodynamic and physiological phenomena involved and their underlying mechanisms.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245617,226,20,NA,jeb245617,Locomotion; Metabolism; Fish; Energy

Previous studies have linked physiological features to coding DNA sequence, regulatory DNA sequence, and epigenetic state, but few have disentangled their relative contributions or unambiguously distinguished causative effects (`drivers') from correlations. Progress has been limited by several factors, including the classical approach of treating continuous and fluid phenotypes as discrete and static across time and environment, and difficulty in considering the full diversity of mechanisms that can modulate phenotype, such as gene accessibility, transcription, mRNA processing and translation. We argue that attention to phenotype nuance, progressing to association with epigenetic marks and then causal analyses of the epigenetic mechanism, will enable clearer evaluation of the evolutionary path. This would underlie an essential paradigm shift, and power the search for links between genomic and epigenomic features and physiology.

article,Controlled expression of the migratory phenotype affects oxidative status in birds,"Marasco, Valeria and Sebastiano, Manrico and Costantini, David and Pola, Gianni and Fusani, Leonida",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"High caloric intake can increase production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. We examined whether the emergence of the migratory phenotype, primarily signalled by increased food intake and fuelling, is accompanied by changes in oxidative status. We induced autumn migration followed by a non-migratory wintering phase in common quails (Coturnix coturnix). We compared three markers of oxidative status - oxidative damage to lipids expressed as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS); superoxide dismutase (SOD); and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) - between birds sampled during the migratory and non-migratory phase. We found that the emergence of the migratory phenotype was associated with: (i) higher levels of TBARS in the liver; (ii) lower levels of SOD in red blood cells and, marginally, in the liver; (iii) higher levels of GPx in the pectoral muscle; and (iv) sex-specific changes in red blood cells and liver. We found no link between food intake and variation in markers of oxidative status in any of the tissues examined, despite food intake being higher in the migratory birds. However, the increase in body mass was positively correlated with muscle GPx activity as birds entered the pre-migratory fattening phase, while the amount of decrease in body mass was negatively correlated with muscle GPx as birds transitioned to the non-migratory phase. Such correlations were absent in red blood cells and liver. Our work suggests that during the emergence of the migratory phenotype, birds might strategically displace oxidative costs on the liver in order to safeguard the pectoral muscles, which have a fundamental role in successfully completing the migratory flight.",2021,10.1242/jeb.233486,224,6,NA,jeb233486,Avian migration; Refuelling; Oxidative stress; Oxidative damage; Lipid peroxidation; Enzymatic antioxidants
article,Low-dose immune challenges result in detectable levels of oxidative damage,"Armour, Ellen M. and Bruner, Taylor L. and Hines, Justin K. and Butler, Michael W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Infection can result in substantial costs to animals, so they frequently respond by removing infectious agents with an immune response. However, immune responses entail their own costs, including upregulation of processes that destroy pathogens (e.g. the production of reactive oxygen species) and processes that limit the extent of self-damage during the immune response (e.g. production of anti-inflammatory proteins such as haptoglobin). Here, we simulated bacterial infection across a 1000-fold range using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administered to northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus), and quantified metrics related to pro-inflammatory conditions {[}i.e. generation of oxidative damage (d-ROMs), depletion of antioxidant capacity], anti-inflammatory mechanisms (i.e. production of haptoglobin, expression of the enzyme heme oxygenase, production of the organic molecule biliverdin) and nutritional physiology (e.g. circulating triglyceride levels, maintenance of body mass). We detected increases in levels of haptoglobin and d-ROMs even at LPS doses that are 1/1000th the concentration of doses frequently used in ecoimmunological studies, while loss of body mass and decreases in circulating triglycerides manifested only in individuals receiving the highest dose of LPS (1 mg LPS kg(-1) body mass), highlighting variation among dose-dependent responses. Additionally, individuals that lost body mass during the course of the experiment had lower levels of circulating triglycerides, and those with more oxidative damage had greater levels of heme oxygenase expression, which highlights the complex interplay between pro- and anti-inflammatory processes. Because low doses of LPS may simulate natural infection levels, variation in dose-dependent physiological responses may be particularly important in modeling how free-living animals navigate immune challenges.",2020,10.1242/jeb.220095,223,6,NA,jeb220095,Dose-response; d-ROMs; Heme oxygenase; Lipopolysaccharide; Oxidative stress; Triglyceride

article,The significance of respiration timing in the energetics estimates of free-ranging killer whales (<i>Orcinus</i> <i>orca</i>),"Roos, Marjoleine M. H. and Wu, Gi-Mick and Miller, Patrick J. O.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Respiration rate has been used as an indicator of metabolic rate and associated cost of transport (COT) of free-ranging cetaceans, discounting potential respiration-by-respiration variation in O-2 uptake. To investigate the influence of respiration timing on O-2 uptake, we developed a dynamic model of O-2 exchange and storage. Individual respiration events were revealed from kinematic data from 10 adult Norwegian herring-feeding killer whales (Orcinus orca) recorded with high-resolution tags (DTAGs). We compared fixed O-2 uptake per respiration models with O-2 uptake per respiration estimated through a simple `broken-stick' O-2-uptake function, in which O-2 uptake was assumed to be the maximum possible O-2 uptake when stores are depleted or maximum total body O-2 store minus existing O-2 store when stores are close to saturated. In contrast to findings assuming fixed O-2 uptake per respiration, uptake from the broken-stick model yielded a high correlation (r(2)>0.9) between O-2 uptake and activity level. Moreover, we found that respiration intervals increased and became less variable at higher swimming speeds, possibly to increase O-2 uptake efficiency per respiration. As found in previous studies, COT decreased monotonically versus speed using the fixed O-2 uptake per respiration models. However, the broken-stick uptake model yielded a curvilinear COT curve with a clear minimum at typical swimming speeds of 1.7-2.4 m s(-1). Our results showed that respiration-by-respiration variation in O-2 uptake is expected to be significant. And though O-2 consumption measurements of COT for free-ranging cetaceans remain impractical, accounting for the influence of respiration timing on O-2 uptake will lead to more consistent predictions of field metabolic rates than using respiration rate alone.",2016,10.1242/jeb.137513,219,13,2066-2077,NA,Metabolic rate; Oxygen uptake; Respiration timing; Cetacean; Respiration rate; In situ
article,Unihemispheric sleep in crocodilians?,"Kelly, Michael L. and Peters, Richard A. and Tisdale, Ryan K. and Lesku, John A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Reduced vigilance is the conspicuous cost of sleep inmost animals. To mitigate against this cost, some birds and aquatic mammals have evolved the ability to sleep with one-half of their brain at a time, a phenomenon known as unihemispheric sleep. During unihemispheric sleep the eye neurologically connected to the `awake' hemisphere remains open while the other eye is closed. Such unilateral eye closure (UEC) has been observed across avian and non-avian reptiles, but has received little attention in the latter. Here, we explored the use of UEC in juvenile saltwater crocodiles (1) under baseline conditions, and in the presence of (2) other young crocodiles and (3) a human. Crocodiles increased the amount of UEC in response to the human, and preferentially oriented their open eye towards both stimuli. These results are consistent with observations on unihemispherically sleeping cetaceans and birds, and could have implications for our understanding of the evolution of unihemispheric sleep.",2015,10.1242/jeb.127605,218,20,3175-3178,NA,Anti-predator; Archosaur; Interhemispheric asymmetry; Laterality; Vigilance
article,Suppressed bone remodeling in black bears conserves energy and bone mass during hibernation,"McGee-Lawrence, Meghan and Buckendahl, Patricia and Carpenter, Caren and Henriksen, Kim and Vaughan, Michael and Donahue, Seth",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Decreased physical activity in mammals increases bone turnover and uncouples bone formation from bone resorption, leading to hypercalcemia, hypercalcuria, bone loss and increased fracture risk. Black bears, however, are physically inactive for up to 6 months annually during hibernation without losing cortical or trabecular bone mass. Bears have been shown to preserve trabecular bone volume and architectural parameters and cortical bone strength, porosity and geometrical properties during hibernation. The mechanisms that prevent disuse osteoporosis in bears are unclear as previous studies using histological and serum markers of bone remodeling show conflicting results. However, previous studies used serum markers of bone remodeling that are known to accumulate with decreased renal function, which bears have during hibernation. Therefore, we measured serum bone remodeling markers (BSALP and TRACP) that do not accumulate with decreased renal function, in addition to the concentrations of serum calcium and hormones involved in regulating bone remodeling in hibernating and active bears. Bone resorption and formation markers were decreased during hibernation compared with when bears were physically active, and these findings were supported by histomorphometric analyses of bone biopsies. The serum concentration of cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART), a hormone known to reduce bone resorption, was 15-fold higher during hibernation. Serum calcium concentration was unchanged between hibernation and non-hibernation seasons. Suppressed and balanced bone resorption and formation in hibernating bears contributes to energy conservation, eucalcemia and the preservation of bone mass and strength, allowing bears to survive prolonged periods of extreme environmental conditions, nutritional deprivation and anuria.",2015,10.1242/jeb.120725,218,13,2067-2074,NA,Skeletal adaptation; Ursus americanus; CART; Calcium metabolism; Disuse

Y. and Bailleul, Frederic and Guinet, Christophe",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Mature female southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) come ashore only in October to breed and in January to moult, spending the rest of the year foraging at sea. Mature females may lose as much as 50\% of their body mass, mostly in lipid stores, during the breeding season due to fasting and lactation. When departing to sea, post-breeding females are negatively buoyant, and the relative change in body condition (i.e. density) during the foraging trip has previously been assessed by monitoring the descent rate during drift dives. However, relatively few drift dives are performed, resulting in low resolution of the temporal reconstruction of body condition change. In this study, six post-breeding females were equipped with time-depth recorders and accelerometers to investigate whether changes in active swimming effort and speed could be used as an alternative method of monitoring density variations throughout the foraging trip. In addition, we assessed the consequences of density change on the swimming efforts of individuals while diving and investigated the effects on dive duration. Both descent swimming speed and ascent swimming effort were found to be strongly correlated to descent rate during drift dives, enabling the fine-scale monitoring of seal density change over the whole trip. Negatively buoyant seals minimized swimming effort during descents, gliding down at slower speeds, and reduced their ascent swimming effort to maintain a nearly constant swimming speed as their buoyancy increased. One per cent of seal density variation over time was found to induce a 20\% variation in swimming effort during dives with direct consequences on dive duration.",2014,10.1242/jeb.088542,217,14,2609-2619,NA,Body condition; Buoyancy; Speed; Swimming effort; Mirounga leonina

Therefore, we aimed to determine how pineal melatonin synthesis is affected by exposing rainbow trout to different stressors, such as hypoxia, chasing and high stocking density. In addition, to test the hypothesis that cortisol is a mediator of such stress-induced effects, a set of animals were intraperitoneally implanted with coconut oil alone or containing cortisol (50 mg kg(-1) body mass) and sampled 5 or 48 h post-injection at midday and midnight. The specificity of such effect was also assessed in cultured pineal organs exposed to cortisol alone or with the general glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, mifepristone (RU486). Stress (in particular chasing and high stocking density) affected the patterns of plasma and pineal organ melatonin content during both day and night, with the greatest reduction occurring at night. The decrease in nocturnal melatonin levels in the pineal organ of stressed fish was accompanied by increased serotonin content and decreased AANAT2 enzymatic activity and mRNA abundance. Similar effects on pineal melatonin synthesis to those elicited by stress were observed in trout implanted with cortisol for either 5 or 48 h. These data indicate that stress negatively influences the synthesis of melatonin in the pineal organ, thus attenuating the day-night variations of circulating melatonin. The effect might be mediated by increased cortisol, which binds to trout pineal organ-specific glucocorticoid receptors to modulate melatonin rhythms. Our results in cultured pineal organs support this. Considering the role of melatonin in the synchronization of daily and annual rhythms, the results suggest that stress-induced alterations in melatonin synthesis could affect the availability of fish to integrate rhythmic environmental information.",2014,10.1242/jeb.087916,217,8,1407-1416,NA,Melatonin; Pineal organ; AANAT2; Cortisol; Rainbow trout; Stress

Using pregnant Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata), a live-bearing teleost, we examined the effects of reproductive traits, pectoral fin use and burst-assisted swimming on swimming metabolic rate, standard metabolic rate ((M) over dot(O2std)) and prolonged swimming performance (U-crit). Reproductive traits included reproductive allocation and pregnancy stage, the former defined as the mass of the reproductive tissues divided by the total body mass. Results showed that the metabolic rate increased curvilinearly with swimming speed. The slope of the relationship was used as an index of swimming cost. There was no evidence that reproductive traits correlated with swimming cost, (M) over dot(O2std) or U-crit. In contrast, data revealed strong effects of pectoral fin use on swimming cost and U-crit. Poecilia reticulata employed body-caudal fin (BCF) swimming at all tested swimming speeds; however, fish with a high simultaneous use of the pectoral fins exhibited increased swimming cost and decreased U-crit. These data indicated that combining BCF swimming and pectoral fin movement over a wide speed range, presumably to support swimming stability and control, is an inefficient swimming behaviour. Finally, transition to burst-assisted swimming was associated with an increase in aerobic metabolic rate. Our study highlights factors other than swimming speed that affect swimming cost and suggests that intraspecific diversity in biomechanical performance, such as pectoral fin use, is an important source of variation in both locomotor cost and maximal performance.",2013,10.1242/jeb.083089,216,18,3564-3574,NA,basal metabolic rate; energetics; gait transition; gravidity; life history; respiratory physiology

Chill coma is mediated by a spreading depolarization of neurons and glia in the CNS, triggered by a failure of ion homeostasis. We used biochemical and electrophysiological approaches in the locust, Locusta migratoria, to test the hypothesis that the protection afforded by RCH is mediated by activation of the Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) in neural tissue. RCH did not affect NKA activity measured in a biochemical assay of homogenized thoracic ganglia. However, RCH hyperpolarized the axon of a visual interneuron (DCMD) and increased the amplitude of an activity-dependent hyperpolarization (ADH) shown previously to be blocked by ouabain.

article,Social instability influences rank-specific patterns of oxidative stress in a cichlid fish,"Border, Shana E. and Piefke, Taylor J. and Funnell, Tyler R. and Fialkowski, Robert F. and Sawecki, Jacob and Dijkstra, Peter D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In many animal societies, dominant individuals have priority access to resources. However, defending high rank can be costly, especially in unstable social hierarchies where there is more intense competition. Oxidative stress has been proposed as a potential cost of social dominance, but few studies have examined this cost in relation to social stability. We studied the cost of social dominance in the cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni by manipulating social stability among males in replicate naturalistic communities for 22 weeks. We found that our social stability treatment influenced status-specific patterns in 3 out of 6 measurements of oxidative stress. Specifically, dominant males experienced increased plasma oxidative damage (measured as reactive oxygen metabolites, ROMs) compared with subordinate males in stable hierarchies only. Subordinate males in unstable hierarchies had higher ROMs than their stable community counterparts, but we found no effect of social stability treatment for dominant males. However, dominant males tended to have reduced total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in the liver when compared with subordinate males in unstable hierarchies, suggesting that the cost of social dominance is higher in unstable hierarchies. There were no effects of status and treatment on gonad TAC, muscle TAC or oxidative DNA damage. We conclude that the stability of the social environment influences the relative cost of social dominance in a tissue- and marker-specific manner.",2021,10.1242/jeb.237172,224,19,NA,jeb237172,Social stability; Habitat stability; Dominance; Oxidative stress
article,Gonads or body? Differences in gonadal and somatic photoperiodic growth response in two vole species,"van Rosmalen, Laura and van Dalum, Jayme and Hazlerigg, David G. and Hut, Roelof A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"To optimally time reproduction, seasonal mammals use a photoperiodic neuroendocrine system (PNES) that measures photoperiod and subsequently drives reproduction. To adapt to late spring arrival at northern latitudes, a lower photoperiodic sensitivity and therefore a higher critical photoperiod for reproductive onset is necessary in northern species to arrest reproductive development until spring onset. Temperature-photoperiod relationships, and hence food availability-photoperiod relationships, are highly latitude dependent. Therefore, we predict PNES sensitivity characteristics to be latitude dependent. Here, we investigated photoperiodic responses at different times during development in northern (tundra or root vole, Microtus oeconomus) and southern vole species (common vole, Microtus arvalis) exposed to constant short (SP) or long photoperiod (LP). Although the tundra vole grows faster under LP, no photoperiodic effect on somatic growth is observed in the common vole. In contrast, gonadal growth is more sensitive to photoperiod in the common vole, suggesting that photoperiodic responses in somatic and gonadal growth can be plastic, and might be regulated through different mechanisms. In both species, thyroid-stimulating hormone n-subunit (Tsh beta) and iodothyronine deiodinase 2 (Dio2) expression is highly increased under LP, whereas Tshr and Dio3 decrease under LP. High Tshrlevels in voles raised under SP may lead to increased sensitivity to increasing photoperiods later in life. The higher photoperiodic-induced Tshr response in tundra voles suggests that the northern vole species might be more sensitive to thyroid-stimulating hormone when raised under SP. In conclusion, species differences in developmental programming of the PNES, which is dependent on photoperiod early in development, may form different breeding strategies as part of latitudinal adaptation.",2020,10.1242/jeb.230987,223,20,NA,jeb230987,Latitudinal adaptation; Microtus; Pars tuberalis; Photoperiod ism; Seasonality
article,"Mitochondrial performance of a continually growing marine bivalve, <i>Mytilus edulis</i>, depends on body size","Sukhotin, Alexey and Kovalev, Anton and Sokolov, Eugene and Sokolova, Inna M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Allometric decline of mass-specific metabolic rate with increasing body size in organisms is a well-documented phenomenon. Despite a long history of research, the mechanistic causes of metabolic scaling with body size remain under debate. Some hypotheses suggest that intrinsic factors such as allometry of cellular and mitochondrial metabolism may contribute to the organismal-level metabolic scaling. The aim of our present study was to determine the metabolic allometry at the mitochondrial level using a continually growing marine ectotherm, the mussel Mytilus edulis, as a model. Mussels from a single cohort that considerably differed in body size were selected, implying faster growth in the larger specimens. We determined the body mass-dependent scaling of the mitochondrial proton leak respiration, respiration in the presence of ADP indicative of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and maximum activity of the mitochondrial electron transport system (ETS) and cytochrome c oxidase (COX). Respiration was measured at normal (15 degrees C), and elevated (27 degrees C) temperatures. The results demonstrated a pronounced allometric increase in both proton leak respiration and OXPHOS activity of mussel mitochondria. Mussels with faster growth (larger body size) showed an increase in OXPHOS rate, proton leak respiration rate, and ETS and COX activity (indicating an overall improved mitochondrial performance) and higher respiratory control ratio (indicating better mitochondrial coupling and potentially lower costs of mitochondrial maintenance at the same OXPHOS capacity) compared with slower growing (smaller) individuals. Our data show that the metabolic allometry at the organismal level cannot be directly explained by mitochondrial functioning.",2020,10.1242/jeb.226332,223,13,NA,jeb226332,Mitochondrial respiration; Allometric scaling; Metabolic rate; Proton leak; Temperature; Growth rate

There are few data on the effect of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields on self-renewal of neural progenitor cells. A particular glial type that shows characteristics of stem cells is olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs). Herein, we assessed the non-thermal effects induced on OECs through radiofrequency electromagnetic fields changing the envelope of the electromagnetic wave. Primary OEC cultures were exposed to continuous or amplitude-modulated 900 MHz electromagnetic fields, in the far-field condition and at different exposure times (10, 15, 20 min). The expression of OEC markers (S-100 and nestin), cytoskeletal proteins (GFAP and vimentin), apoptotic pathway activation by caspase-3 cleavage and cell viability were evaluated. Our results highlight that 20 min of exposure to continuous or amplitude-modulated 900 MHz electromagnetic fields induced a different and significant decrease in cell viability. In addition, according to the electromagnetic field waveform, diverse dynamic changes in the expression of the analysed markers in OECs and activation of the apoptotic pathway were observed.

This response is variable and modulated by factors such as dive duration, depth, exercise and cognitive control. This study assessed the potential role of exercise and relative lung volume in the regulation of heart rate (f(H)) during dives of adult female California sea lions instrumented with electrocardiogram (ECG), depth and tri-axial acceleration data loggers. A positive relationship between activity (minimum specific acceleration) and f(H) throughout dives suggested increased muscle perfusion associated with exercise. However, apart from late ascent, f(H) during dives was still less than or equal to resting f(H) (on land). In addition, the activity-f(H) relationship was weaker in long, deep dives consistent with prioritization of blood oxygen conservation over blood oxygen delivery to muscle in those dives. Pulmonary stretch receptor reflexes may also contribute to f(H) regulation as f(H) profiles generally paralleled changes in relative lung volume, especially in shallower dives and during early descent and late ascent of deeper dives. Overall, these findings support the concept that both exercise and pulmonary stretch receptor reflexes may influence the dive response in sea lions.",2020,10.1242/jeb.214163,223,5,NA,jeb214163,Depth; Dive response; Exercise; Minimum specific acceleration; Parasympathetic; Stroke rate; Sympathetic
article,Femoral bone perfusion through the nutrient foramen during growth and locomotor development of western grey kangaroos (<i>Macropus</i> <i>fuliginosus</i>),"Hu, Qiaohui and Nelson, Thomas J. and Snelling, Edward P. and Seymour, Roger S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The nutrient artery passes through the nutrient foramen on the shaft of the femur and supplies more than half of the total blood flow to the bone. Assuming that the size of the nutrient foramen correlates with the size of the nutrient artery, an index of blood flow rate (Q(i)) can be calculated from nutrient foramen dimensions. Interspecific Q(i) is proportional to locomotor activity levels in adult mammals, birds and reptiles. However, no studies have yet estimated intraspecific Q(i) to test for the effects of growth and locomotor development on bone blood flow requirements. In this study, we used micro-CT and medical CT scanning to measure femoral dimensions and foramen radius to calculate femoral Q(i) during the in-pouch and post-pouch life stages of western grey kangaroos (Macropus fuliginosus) weighing 5.7 g to 70.5 kg and representing a 12,350-fold range in body mass. A biphasic scaling relationship between Q(i) and body mass was observed (breakpoint at ca. 1-5 kg body mass right before permanent pouch exit), with a steep exponent of 0.96 +/- 0.09 (95\% CI) during the in-pouch life stage and a statistically independent exponent of -0.59 +/- 0.90 during the post-pouch life stage. In-pouch joeys showed Q(i) values that were 50-100 times higher than those of adult diprotodont marsupials of the same body mass, but gradually converged with them as post-pouch adults. Bone modelling during growth appears to be the main determinant of femoral bone blood flow during in-pouch development, whereas bone remodelling for micro-fracture repair due to locomotion gradually becomes the main determinant when kangaroos leave the pouch and become more active.",2018,10.1242/jeb.168625,221,4,NA,jeb168625,Allometry; Blood flow; CT scan; Femur; Locomotion; Ontogeny

Here, we use L. stagnalis to study the effects of other environmentally relevant stressors on memory formation in two other strains of freshly collected snails, one `smart' and one `average'. The stressors we examined are thermal, resource restriction combined with food odour, predator detection and, for the first time, tissue injury (shell damage). We show that the same stressor has significantly different effects on memory formation depending on whether snails are `smart' or `average'. Specifically, our data suggest that a stressor or a combination of stressors act to enhance memory in `average' snails but obstruct memory formation in `smart' snails. These results are consistent with the YDH law and our hypothesis that `smart' snails are more easily stressed than `average' snails.",2017,10.1242/jeb.149161,220,5,891-899,NA,Lymnaea; Learning and memory; Smart; Average; Strain-specific learning abilities; Environmentally relevant stressors
article,Effect of light intensity on flight control and temporal properties of photoreceptors in bumblebees,"Reber, Therese and Vahakainu, Antti and Baird, Emily and Weckstrom, Matti and Warrant, Eric and Dacke, Marie",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"To control flight, insects rely on the pattern of visual motion generated on the retina as they move through the environment. When light levels fall, vision becomes less reliable and flight control thus becomes more challenging. Here, we investigated the effect of light intensity on flight control by filming the trajectories of free-flying bumblebees (Bombus terrestris, Linnaeus 1758) in an experimental tunnel at different light levels. As light levels fell, flight speed decreased and the flight trajectories became more tortuous but the bees were still remarkably good at centring their flight about the tunnel's midline. To investigate whether this robust flight performance can be explained by visual adaptations in the bumblebee retina, we also examined the response speed of the green-sensitive photoreceptors at the same light intensities. We found that the response speed of the photoreceptors significantly decreased as light levels fell. This indicates that bumblebees have both behavioural (reduction in flight speed) and retinal (reduction in response speed of the photoreceptors) adaptations to allow them to fly in dim light. However, the more tortuous flight paths recorded in dim light suggest that these adaptations do not support flight with the same precision during the twilight hours of the day.",2015,10.1242/jeb.113886,218,9,1339-1346,NA,Insects; Vision; Bombus terrestris; Retina; Behavioural adaptation; Speed control; Position control
article,Mechanisms of naturally evolved ethanol resistance in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>,"Fry, James D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The decaying fruit in which Drosophila melanogaster feed and breed can contain ethanol in concentrations as high as 6-7\%. In this cosmopolitan species, populations from temperate regions are consistently more resistant to ethanol poisoning than populations from the tropics, but little is known about the physiological basis of this difference. I show that when exposed to low levels of ethanol vapor, flies from a tropical African population accumulated 2-3 times more internal ethanol than flies from a European population, giving evidence that faster ethanol catabolism by European flies contributes to the resistance difference. Using lines differing only in the origin of their third chromosome, however, I show that faster ethanol elimination cannot fully explain the resistance difference, because relative to African third chromosomes, European third chromosomes confer substantially higher ethanol resistance, while having little effect on internal ethanol concentrations. European third chromosomes also confer higher resistance to acetic acid, a metabolic product of ethanol, than African third chromosomes, suggesting that the higher ethanol resistance conferred by the former might be due to increased resistance to deleterious effects of ethanol-derived acetic acid. In support of this hypothesis, when ethanol catabolism was blocked with an Alcohol dehydrogenase mutant, there was no difference in ethanol resistance between flies with European and African third chromosomes.",2014,10.1242/jeb.110510,217,22,3996-4003,NA,Genetic correlation; Geographic variation; Metabolic pathways; Toxin resistance
article,"Prostaglandin catabolism in <i>Spodoptera exigua</i>, a lepidopteran insect","Ahmed, Shabbir and Kim, Yonggyun",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Several prostaglandins (PGs) and PG-synthesizing enzymes have been identified from insects. PGs mediate cellular and humoral immune responses. However, uncontrolled and prolonged immune responses might have adverse effects on survival. PG catabolism in insects has not been reported. Here, using a transcriptomic analysis, we predicted the presence of two PG-degrading enzymes, PG dehydrogenase (SePGDH) and PG reductase (SePGR), in Spodoptera exigua, a lepidopteran insect. SePGDH and SePGR expression levels were upregulated after immune challenge. However, their expression peaks occurred after those of PG biosynthesis genes, such as those encoding PGE(2) synthase or PGD(2) synthase. SePGDH and SePGR expression levels were upregulated after injection with PGE(2) or PGD(2). In contrast, such upregulated expression was not detected after injection with leukotriene B-4, an eicosanoid inflammatory mediator. RNA interference (RNAi) using double-stranded RNAs specific to SePGDH or SePGR suppressed their expression levels. The RNAi treatment resulted in an excessive and fatal melanization of larvae even after a non-pathogenic bacterial infection. Phenoloxidase (PO) activity mediating the melanization in larval plasma was induced by bacterial challenge or PGE(2) injection. Although the induced PO activity decreased after 8 h in control larvae, those treated with dsRNAs specific to PG-degrading enzyme genes kept a high PO activity for a longer period. These results suggest that SePGDH and SePGR are responsible for PG degradation at a late phase of the immune response.",2020,10.1242/jeb.233221,223,21,NA,jeb233221,Eicosanoids; RNA interference; Immunity
article,Extreme diving in mammals: first estimates of behavioural aerobic dive limits in Cuvier's beaked whales,"Quick, Nicola J. and Cioffi, William R. and Shearer, Jeanne M. and Fahlman, Andreas and Read, Andrew J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"We analysed 3680 dives from 23 satellite-linked tags deployed on Cuvier's beaked whales to assess the relationship between long duration dives and inter-deep dive intervals and to estimate aerobic dive limit (ADL).

We found no relationship between the longest 5\% of dive durations and the following inter-deep dive interval nor any relationship with the ventilation period immediately prior to or following a long dive. We suggest that Cuvier's beaked whales have low metabolic rates, high oxygen storage capacities and a high acid-buffering capacity to deal with the by-products of both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism, which enables them to extend dive durations and exploit their bathypelagic foraging habitats.",2020,10.1242/jeb.222109,223,18,NA,jeb222109,Ziphius cavirostris; ADL; Dive duration; Diving behaviour; Metabolic rate
article,Flight muscle protein damage during endurance flight is related to energy expenditure but not dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids in a migratory bird,"Dick, Morag F. and Guglielmo, Christopher G.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Migration poses many physiological challenges for birds, including sustaining high intensity aerobic exercise for hours or days. A consequence of endurance flight is the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS production may be influenced by dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), which, although prone to oxidative damage, may limit mitochondrial ROS production and increase antioxidant capacity. We examined how flight muscles manage oxidative stress during flight, and whether dietary long-chain PUFA influence ROS management or damage. Yellow-rumped warblers were fed diets low in PUFA, or high in long-chain n-3 or n-6 PUFA. Flight muscle was sampled from birds in each diet treatment at rest or immediately after flying for up to a maximum of 360 min in a wind tunnel. Flight increased flight muscle superoxide dismutase activity but had no effect on catalase activity. The ratio of glutathione to glutathione disulphide decreased during flight. Oxidative protein damage, indicated by protein carbonyls, increased with flight duration (Pearson r=0.4). Further examination of just individuals that flew for 360 min (N=15) indicates that oxidative damage was related more to total energy expenditure (Pearson r=0.86) than to flight duration itself. This suggests that high quality individuals with higher flight efficiency have not only lower energy costs but also potentially less oxidative damage to repair after arrival at the destination. No significant effects of dietary long-chain PUFA were observed on antioxidants or damage. Overall, flight results in oxidative stress and the degree of damage is likely driven more by energy costs than fatty acid nutrition.",2019,10.1242/jeb.187708,222,5,NA,jeb187708,Migration; Oxidative stress; Antioxidants; Songbird; Flight; Wind tunnel; Polyunsaturated fatty acids
article,Threshold effect in the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production of skeletal muscle mitochondria during fasting and refeeding,"Roussel, Damien and Boel, Melanie and Mortz, Mathieu and Romestaing, Caroline and Duchamp, Claude and Voituron, Yann",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Under nutritional deprivation, the energetic benefits of reducing mitochondrial metabolism are often associated with enhanced harmful pro-oxidant effects and a subsequent long-term negative impact on cellular integrity. However, the flexibility of mitochondrial functioning under stress has rarely been explored during the transition from basal non-phosphorylating to maximal phosphorylating oxygen consumption. Here, we experimentally tested whether ducklings (Cairina moscnata), fasted for 6 days and subsequently refed for 3 days, exhibited modifications to their mitochondrial fluxes, i.e. oxygen consumption, ATP synthesis, reactive oxygen species generation (ROS) and associated ratios, such as the electron leak (\% ROS/O) and the oxidative cost of ATP production (\% ROS/ATP). This was carried out at different steady-state rates of oxidative phosphorylation in both pectoralis (glycolytic) and gastrocnemius (oxidative) muscles. Fasting induced a decrease in the rates of oxidative phosphorylation and maximal ROS release. These changes were completely reversed by 3 days of refeeding. Yet, the fundamental finding of the present study was the existence of a clear threshold in ROS release and associated ratios, which remained low until a low level of mitochondrial activity was reached (30-40\% of maximal oxidative phosphorylation activity).",2019,10.1242/jeb.196188,222,4,NA,jeb196188,Free electron leak; ROS/ATP ratio; Oxidative phosphorylation; Reactive oxygen species; Skeletal muscle; Starvation; Bird
article,The cell specificity of gene expression in the response to heat stress in corals,"Traylor-Knowles, Nikki and Rose, Noah H. and Palumbi, Stephen R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Previous transcriptional studies in heat-stressed corals have shown that many genes are responsive to generalized heat stress whereas the expression patterns of specific gene networks after heat stress show strong correlations with variation in bleaching outcomes. However, where these specific genes are expressed is unknown. In this study, we employed in situ hybridization to identify patterns of spatial gene expression of genes previously predicted to be involved in general stress response and bleaching. We found that tumor necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs), known to be strong responders to heat stress, were not expressed in gastrodermal symbiont-containing cells but were widely expressed in specific cells of the epidermal layer. The transcription factors AP-1 and FosB, implicated as early signals of heat stress, were widely expressed throughout the oral gastrodermis and epidermis. By contrast, a G protein-coupled receptor gene (GPCR) and a fructose bisphosphate aldolase C gene (aldolase), previously implicated in bleaching, were expressed in symbiont-containing gastrodermal cells and in the epidermal tissue. Finally, chordin-like/kielin (chordin-like), a gene highly correlated to bleaching, was expressed solely in the oral gastrodermis. From this study, we confirm that heat-responsive genes occur widely in coral tissues outside of symbiont-containing cells. Joint information about expression patterns in response to heat and cell specificity will allow greater dissection of the regulatory pathways and specific cell reactions that lead to coral bleaching.",2017,10.1242/jeb.155275,220,10,1837-1845,NA,Bleaching; Cnidarians; Cnidocytes; Coral reef; Heat stress; Tumor necrosis factor receptor

Relative humidity (RH) affects the performance of the thread's hygroscopic droplets by altering the viscoelasticity of each droplet's adhesive glycoprotein core. Studies that have characterized this performance used smooth glass and steel surfaces and uniform forces. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that these changes in performance translate into differences in prey retention times. We first characterized the glycoprotein contact surface areas and maximum extension lengths of Araneus marmoreus droplets at 20\%, 37\%, 55\%, 72\% and 90\% RH and then modeled the relative work required to initiate pull-off of a 4 mm thread span, concluding that this species' droplets and threads performed optimally at 72\% RH. Next, we evaluated the ability of three equally spaced capture thread strands to retain a house fly at 37\%, 55\% and 72\% RH. Each fly's struggle was captured in a video and bouts of active escape behavior were summed. House flies were retained 11 s longer at 72\% RH than at 37\% and 55\% RH. This difference is ecologically significant because the short time after an insect strikes a web and before a spider begins wrapping it is an insect's only opportunity to escape from the web. Moreover, these results validate the mechanism by which natural selection can tune the performance of an orb spider's capture threads to the humidity of its habitat.",2017,10.1242/jeb.148080,220,7,1313-1321,NA,Adhesion; Araneus marmoreus; Biomaterial; Extended phenotypic plasticity; Orb web; Viscous capture thread

In this study, we characterized the expression pattern of ZBED1 (zinc finger, BED-type containing 1), a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in regulating cell proliferation, in five tissues of the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) during pre-hibernation, deep hibernation and post-hibernation. Moreover, we investigated the ZBED1 genetic divergence from individuals with variable hibernation phenotypes that cover all three known mtDNA lineages of the species. Expression analyses showed that ZBED1 is overexpressed only in brain and skeletal muscle, not in the other three tissues, suggesting an increased cell proliferation in these two tissues during deep hibernation. Evolutionary analyses showed that ZBED1 sequences were clustered into two well-supported clades with each one dominated by hibernating and non-hibernating individuals, respectively.

Endurance runners are also often advised to maintain short strides and avoid landing with the feet too far in front of their hips or knees (colloquially termed `overstriding'), but how do different kinematic strategies for varying stride length at the same stride frequency affect economy and impact peaks? Linear mixed models were used to analyze repeated measures of stride frequency, the anteroposterior position of the foot at landing, V-O2, lower extremity kinematics and vertical ground reaction forces in 14 runners who varied substantially in height and body mass and who were asked to run at 75, 80, 85, 90 and 95 strides min(-1) at 3.0 m s(-1). For every increase of 5 strides min-1, maximum hip flexor moments in the sagittal plane increased by 5.8\% (P< 0.0001), and the position of the foot at landing relative to the hip decreased by 5.9\% (P=0.003). Higher magnitudes of posteriorly directed braking forces were associated with increases in foot landing position relative to the hip (P=0.0005) but not the knee (P=0.54); increases in foot landing position relative to the knee were associated with higher magnitudes (P< 0.0001) and rates of loading (P=0.07) of the vertical ground reaction force impact peak. Finally, the mean metabolically optimal stride frequency was 84.8 +/- 3.6 strides min(-1), with 50.4\% of the variance explained by the trade-off between minimizing braking forces versus maximum hip flexor moments during swing.

Using X-ray imaging, we performed the first kinematic investigation of the subsurface locomotion of the long, slender shovel-nosed snake (Chionactis occipitalis) and compared its biomechanics with those of the shorter, limbed sandfish lizard (Scincus scincus). The sandfish was previously shown to maximize swimming speed and minimize the mechanical cost of transport during burial. Our measurements revealed that the snake also swims through sand by propagating traveling waves down the body, head to tail. Unlike the sandfish, the snake nearly followed its own tracks, thus swimming in an approximate tube of self-fluidized granular media. We measured deviations from tube movement by introducing a parameter, the local slip angle, beta(s), which measures the angle between the direction of movement of each segment and body orientation. The average beta(s), was smaller for the snake than for the sandfish; granular resistive force theory (RFT) revealed that the curvature utilized by each animal optimized its performance. The snake benefits from its slender body shape (and increased vertebral number), which allows propagation of a higher number of optimal curvature body undulations. The snake's low skin friction also increases performance. The agreement between experiment and RFT combined with the relatively simple properties of the granular `frictional fluid' make subarenaceous swimming an attractive system to study functional morphology and bauplan evolution.",2015,10.1242/jeb.108357,218,3,440-450,NA,Undulatory locomotion; Granular media; Resistive force theory; Snake; Lizard; Subsurface
article,Mitochondrial uncoupling as a regulator of life-history trajectories in birds: an experimental study in the zebra finch,"Stier, Antoine and Bize, Pierre and Roussel, Damien and Schull, Quentin and Massemin, Sylvie and Criscuolo, Francois",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Mitochondria have a fundamental role in the transduction of energy from food into ATP. The coupling between food oxidation and ATP production is never perfect, but may nevertheless be of evolutionary significance. The `uncoupling to survive' hypothesis suggests that `mild' mitochondrial uncoupling evolved as a protective mechanism against the excessive production of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS). Because resource allocation and ROS production are thought to shape animal life histories, alternative life-history trajectories might be driven by individual variation in the degree of mitochondrial uncoupling. We tested this hypothesis in a small bird species, the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), by treating adults with the artificial mitochondrial uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) over a 32-month period. In agreement with our expectations, the uncoupling treatment increased metabolic rate. However, we found no evidence that treated birds enjoyed lower oxidative stress levels or greater survival rates, in contrast to previous results in other taxa. In vitro experiments revealed lower sensitivity of ROS production to DNP in mitochondria isolated from skeletal muscles of zebra finch than mouse. In addition, we found significant reductions in the number of eggs laid and in the inflammatory immune response in treated birds. Altogether, our data suggest that the `uncoupling to survive' hypothesis may not be applicable for zebra finches, presumably because of lower effects of mitochondrial uncoupling on mitochondrial ROS production in birds than in mammals. Nevertheless, mitochondrial uncoupling appeared to be a potential life-history regulator of traits such as fecundity and immunity at adulthood, even with food supplied ad libitum.",2014,10.1242/jeb.103945,217,19,3579-3589,NA,Mitochondria; Uncoupling; Free radical theory of ageing; Oxidative stress; Reactive oxygen species; Life-history trade-off; Bird
article,"Cost, effectiveness and environmental relevance of multidrug transporters in sea urchin embryos","Cole, Bryan J. and Hamdoun, Amro and Epel, David",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"ATP-binding cassette transporters protect cells via efflux of xenobiotics and endogenous byproducts of detoxification. While the cost of this ATP-dependent extrusion is known at the molecular level, i.e. the ATP used for each efflux event, the overall cost to a cell or organism of operating this defense is unclear, especially as the cost of efflux changes depending on environmental conditions. During prolonged exposure to xenobiotics, multidrug transporter activity could be costly and ineffective because effluxed substrate molecules are not modified in the process and could thus undergo repeated cycles of efflux and re-entry. Here we use embryos of the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, as a model to determine transport costs and benefits under environmentally relevant xenobiotic concentrations. Strikingly, our results show that efflux transporter activity costs less than 0.2\% of total ATP usage, as a proportion of oxygen consumption. The benefits of transport, defined as the reduction in substrate accumulation due to transporter activity, depended largely, but not entirely, on the rate of passive flux of each substrate across the plasma membrane. One of the substrates tested exhibited rapid membrane permeation coupled with high rates of efflux, thus inducing rapid and futile cycles of efflux followed by re-entry of the substrate. This combination significantly reduced transporter effectiveness as a defense and increased costs even at relatively low substrate concentrations. Despite these effects with certain substrates, our results show that efflux transporters are a remarkably effective and low-cost first line of defense against exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of xenobiotics.",2013,10.1242/jeb.090522,216,20,3896-3905,NA,ABC transporters; environmental toxicology; P-GP; MRP; Strongylocentrotus purpuratus

PPG showed perfect synchronization with electrocardiogram (ECG), with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.99999. For rPPG, the results showed good agreement with ECG. Under active provision of green light, the Pearson's correlation coefficient was 0.966, surpassing the value of 0.947 under natural light.

However, there are surprisingly few within-species tests of whether metabolic rate and gill area scale similarly. We examined the relationship between oxygen supply (gill area) and demand (metabolic rate) by making paired estimates of gill area with resting and maximum metabolic rates across ontogeny in the relatively inactive California horn shark, Heterodontus francisci. We found that the allometric slope of resting metabolic rate was 0.966 +/- 0.058 (+/- 95\% CI), whereas that of maximum metabolic rate was somewhat steeper (1.073 +/- 0.040). We also discovered that the scaling of gill area shifted with ontogeny: the allometric slope of gill area was shallower in individuals <0.203 kg in body mass (0.564 +/- 0.261), but increased to 1.012 +/- 0.113 later in life. This appears to reflect changes in demand for gill-oxygen uptake during egg case development and immediately post hatch, whereas for most of ontogeny, gill area scales in between that of resting and maximum metabolic rate. These relationships differ from predictions of the gill oxygen limitation theory, which argues that the allometric scaling of gill area constrains metabolic processes. Thus, for the California horn shark, metabolic rate does not appear limited by theoretical surface-area-to-volume ratio constraints of gill area. These results highlight the importance of data from paired and size-matched individuals when comparing physiological scaling relationships.",2023,10.1242/jeb.246054,226,15,NA,jeb246054,Aerobic scope; Aquatic respirometry; Elasmobranch; Gill oxygen limitation; Gill surface area; Metabolic rate
article,Long-term memory of configural learning is enhanced via CREB upregulation by the flavonoid quercetin in <i>Lymnaea</i> <i>stagnalis</i>,"Batabyal, Anuradha and Rivi, Veronica and Benatti, Cristina and Blom, Johanna M. C. and Lukowiak, Ken",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Animals respond to acute stressors by modifying their behaviour and physiology. The pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis exhibits configural learning (CL), a form of higher order associative learning. In CL snails develop a landscape of fear when they experience a predatory cue along with a taste of food. This experience results in a suppression of the food response; but the memory only persists for 3 h. Lymnaea has also been found to upregulate heat shock proteins (HSPs) as a result of acute heat stress, which leads to the enhancement of memory formation. A plant flavonoid quercetin blocks the upregulation of HSPs when experienced prior to heat stress. Here, we used this blocking mechanismto test the hypothesis that HSP upregulation plays a critical role in CL. Snails experienced quercetin prior to CL training and surprisingly instead of blocking memory formation it enhanced the memory such that it now persisted for at least 24 h. Quercetin exposure either prior to or after CL enhanced long-term memory (LTM) up to 48 h. We quantified mRNA levels of the transcription factor CREB1 in the Lymnaea central nervous system and found LymCREB1 to be upregulated following quercetin exposure. The enhanced LTM phenotype in L. stagnalis was most pronounced when quercetin was experienced during the consolidation phase. Additionally, quercetin exposure during the memory reconsolidation phase also led to memory enhancement. Thus, we found no support of our original hypothesis but found that quercetin exposure upregulated LymCREB1 leading to LTM formation for CL.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242761,224,13,NA,jeb242761,Associative learning; Transcription factor; Consolidation; Reconsolidation

While moderate activity might be beneficial, animals living in the wild often work at the margins of their resources and performance limits. Individuals using ARTs may have divergent capacities for activity. When pushed beyond their respective capacities, they may experience condition loss, oxidative stress, and molecular damage that must be repaired with limited resources. We used the Australian painted dragon lizard that exhibits color polymorphism as a model to experimentally test the effect of exercise on body condition, growth, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and telomere dynamics -a potential marker of stress and aging and a correlate of longevity. For most males, ROS levels tended to be lower with greater exercise; however, males with yellow throat patches - or bibs - had higher ROS levels than non-bibbed males. At the highest level of exercise, bibbed males exhibited telomere loss, while non-bibbed males gained telomere length; the opposite pattern was observed in the no-exercise controls. Growth was positively related to food intake but negatively correlated with telomere length at the end of the experiment. Body condition was not related to food intake but was positively correlated with increases in telomere length. These results, along with our previous work, suggest that aggressive - territory holding - bibbed males suffer physiological costs that may reduce longevity compared with non-bibbed males with superior postcopulatory traits.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242164,224,9,NA,jeb242164,Alternative mating tactics; Telomere lengthening; Reptiles; Ctenophorus pictus; Painted dragon lizards

Animals initially showed negative phototaxis to white light and positive taxis to blue light. Using an aversive learning paradigm, we investigated the plasticity of innate behaviour following operant conditioning. The initial rate of choosing a blue-lit exit was analysed by a dual choice experiment between blue-lit and white-lit exits in pre-test conditions. During training, electrical shocks were applied to the animals when they oriented to the blue-lit exit. Memory tests were given to analyse the orientation rate to the blue-lit exit in trials 1 and 24 h after training and these rates were compared with the pre-test. In general, animals avoided the blue-lit exit in the memory tests. When training was carried out three times, the long-term memory was retained for at least 48 h, although a single bout of training was also enough to form a long-term memory. Cooling animals at 4 degrees C or injection of cycloheximide immediately after training altered the formation of long-term memory, but had no effect on short-term memory formation. Administration of the adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ22536, the PKA inhibitor H89 or the CREB inhibitor KG-501 immediately after training also blocked the formation of long-term memory, but had no effect on short-term memory formation. Thus, our pharmacological behavioural analyses showed that new protein synthesis was necessary to form long-term memories and that the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway is the main signal cascade for long-term memory formation in the marbled crayfish.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242180,224,6,NA,jeb242180,CREB; PKA; Learning; Long-term memory; Taxis

S. and Reid, Angus M. A. and Meddle, Simone L. and Wingfield, John C. and Krause, Jesse S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is under complex regulatory control at multiple levels. Enzymatic regulation plays an important role in both circulating levels of glucocorticoids and target tissue exposure. Three key enzyme pathways are responsible for the immediate control of glucocorticoids. De novo synthesis of glucocorticoid from cholesterol involves a multistep enzymatic cascade. This cascade terminates with 11 beta-hydroxylase, responsible for the final conversion of 11-deoxy precursors into active glucocorticoids. Additionally, 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11 beta-HSD1) controls regeneration of glucocorticoids from inactive metabolites, providing a secondary source of active glucocorticoids. Localized inactivation of glucocorticoids is under the control of Type 2 11 beta-HSD (11 beta-HSD2). The function of these enzymes is largely unexplored in wild species, particularly songbirds. Here, we investigated the contribution of both clearance and generation of glucocorticoids to regulation of the hormonal stress response via the use of pharmacological antagonists. Additionally, we mapped 11 beta-HSD gene expression. We found 11 beta-HSD1 primarily in liver, kidney and adrenal glands, although it was detectable across all tissue types. 11 beta-HSD2 was predominately expressed in the adrenal glands and kidney with moderate gonadal and liver expression. Inhibition of glucocorticoid generation by metyrapone was found to decrease levels peripherally, while both peripheral and central administration of the 11 beta-HSD2 inhibitor DETC resulted in elevated concentrations of corticosterone. These data suggest that during the stress response, peripheral antagonism of the 11 beta-HSD system has a greater impact on circulating glucocorticoid levels than central control. Further studies should aim to elucidate the respective roles of the 11 beta-HSD and 11 beta-hydroxylase enzymes.",2020,10.1242/jeb.209346,223,1,NA,jeb209346,Glucocorticoid; Corticosterone; Hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis; HPA axis; 11 beta-HSD; Negative feedback; Songbird; Stress
article,"Weighing the evidence for using vascular conductance, not resistance, in comparative cardiovascular physiology","Joyce, William and White, Daniel W. and Raven, Peter B. and Wang, Tobias",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Vascular resistance and conductance are reciprocal indices of vascular tone that are often assumed to be interchangeable. However, in most animals in vivo, blood flow (i.e. cardiac output) typically varies much more than arterial blood pressure. When blood flow changes at a constant pressure, the relationship between conductance and blood flow is linear, whereas the relationship between resistance and blood flow is non-linear. Thus, for a given change in blood flow, the change in resistance depends on the starting point, whereas the attendant change in conductance is proportional to the change in blood flow regardless of the starting conditions. By comparing the effects of physical activity at different temperatures or between species - concepts at the heart of comparative cardiovascular physiology - we demonstrate that the difference between choosing resistance or conductance can be marked. We also explain here how the ratio of conductance in the pulmonary and systemic circulations provides a more intuitive description of cardiac shunt patterns in the reptilian cardiovascular system than the more commonly used ratio of resistance. Finally, we posit that, although the decision to use conductance or resistance should be made on a case-by-case basis, in most circumstances, conductance is a more faithful portrayal of cardiovascular regulation in vertebrates.",2019,10.1242/jeb.197426,222,6,NA,jeb197426,Exercise; Cardiac shunting; Cardiac output; Vasodilation
article,Contraction of atrial smooth muscle reduces cardiac output in perfused turtle hearts,"Joyce, William and Axelsson, Michael and Wang, Tobias",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Unusual undulations in resting tension (tonus waves) were described in isolated atria from freshwater turtles more than a century ago. These tonus waves were soon after married with the histological demonstration of a rich layer of smooth muscle on the lumina) side of the atrial wall. Research thereafter waned and the functional significance of this smooth muscle has remained obscure. Here, we provide evidence that contraction of the smooth muscle in the atria may be able to change cardiac output in turtle hearts. In in situ perfused hearts of the red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans), we demonstrated that activation of smooth muscle contraction with histamine (100 nmol kg (-1) bolus injected into perfusate) reduced cardiac output by decreasing stroke volume (>50\% decrease in both parameters). Conversely, inhibition of smooth muscle contraction with wortmannin (10 mu mol l(-1) perfusion) approximately doubled baseline stroke volume and cardiac output. We suggest that atrial smooth muscle provides a unique mechanism to control cardiac filling that could be involved in the regulation of stroke volume during diving.",2019,10.1242/jeb.199828,222,6,NA,jeb199828,Stroke volume; Diving; Cardiac filling; Tonus waves
article,Insulin-like growth factor signaling regulates developmental trajectory associated with diapause in embryos of the annual killifish <i>Austrofundulus limnaeus</i>,"Woll, S. Cody and Podrabsky, Jason E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Annual killifishes exhibit a number of unique life history characters including the occurrence of embryonic diapause, unique cell movements associated with dispersion and subsequent reaggregation of the embryonic blastomeres, and a short postembryonic life span. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling is known to play a role in the regulation of metabolic dormancy in a number of animals but has not been explored in annual killifishes. The abundance of IGF proteins during development and the developmental effects of blocking IGF signaling by pharmacological inhibition of the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF1R) were explored in embryos of the annual killifish Austrofundulus limnaeus. Blocking of IGF signaling in embryos that would normally escape entrance into diapause resulted in a phenotype that was remarkably similar to that of embryos entering diapause. IGF-I protein abundance spikes during early development in embryos that will not enter diapause. In contrast, IGF-I levels remain low during early development in embryos that will enter diapause II. IGF-II protein is packaged at higher levels in escape-bound embryos compared with diapause-bound embryos. However, IGF-II levels quickly decrease and remain low during early development and only increase substantially during late development in both developmental trajectories. Developmental patterns of IGF-I and IGF-II protein abundance under conditions that would either induce or bypass entrance into diapause are consistent with a role for IGF signaling in the regulation of developmental trajectory and entrance into diapause in this species. We propose that IGF signaling may be a unifying regulatory pathway that explains the larger suite of characters that are associated with the complex life history of annual killifishes.",2017,10.1242/jeb.151373,220,15,2777-2786,NA,Developmental arrest; Life history evolution; Phenotypic plasticity; Metabolic depression
article,Not flying blind: a comparative study of photoreceptor function in flying and non-flying cockroaches,"Frolov, Roman V. and Matsushita, Atsuko and Arikawa, Kentaro",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Flying is often associated with superior visual performance, as good vision is crucial for detection and implementation of rapid visually guided aerial movements. To understand the evolution of insect visual systems it is therefore important to compare phylogenetically related species with different investments in flight capability. Here, we describe and compare morphological and electrophysiological properties of photoreceptors from the habitually flying green cockroach Panchlora nivea and the American cockroach Periplaneta americana, which flies only at high ambient temperatures. In contrast to Periplaneta, ommatidia in Panchlora were characterized by two-tiered rhabdom, whichmight facilitate detection of polarized light while flying in the dark. In patch-clamp experiments, we assessed the absolute sensitivity to light, elementary and macroscopic light-activated current and voltage responses, voltage-activated potassium (Kv) conductances, and information transfer. Both species are nocturnal, and their photoreceptors were similarly sensitive to light. However, a number of important differences were found, including the presence in Panchlora of a prominent transient Kv current and a generally low variability in photoreceptor properties. The maximal information rate in Panchlora was one-third higher than in Periplaneta, owing to a substantially higher gain and membrane corner frequency. The differences in performance could not be completely explained by dissimilarities in the light-activated or Kv conductances; instead, we suggest that the superior performance of Panchlora photoreceptors mainly originates from better synchronization of elementary responses. These findings raise the issue of whether the evolutionary tuning of photoreceptor properties to visual demands proceeded differently in Blattodea than in Diptera.",2017,10.1242/jeb.159103,220,13,2335-2344,NA,Panchlora nivea; Periplaneta americana; Information processing; Visual ecology
article,Do respiratory limitations affect metabolism of insect larvae before moulting? An empirical test at the individual level,"Kivela, Sami M. and Lehmann, Philipp and Gotthard, Karl",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Recent data suggest that oxygen limitation may induce moulting in larval insects. This oxygen-dependent induction of moulting (ODIM) hypothesis stems from the fact that the tracheal respiratory system of insects grows primarily at moults, whereas tissue mass increases massively between moults. This may result in a mismatch between oxygen supply and demand at the end of each larval instar because oxygen demand of growing tissues exceeds the relatively fixed supply capacity of the respiratory system. The ODIM hypothesis predicts that, within larval instars, respiration and metabolic rates of an individual larva first increase with increasing body mass but eventually level off once the supply capacity of the tracheal system starts to constrain metabolism. Here, we provide the first individual-level test of this key prediction of the ODIM hypothesis. We use a novel methodology where we repeatedly measure respiration and metabolic rates throughout the penultimate- and final-instar larvae in the butterfly Pieris napi. In the penultimate instar, respiration and metabolic rates gradually decelerated along with growth, supporting the ODIM hypothesis. However, respiration and metabolic rates increased linearly during growth in the final instar, contradicting the prediction. Moreover, our data suggest considerable variation among individuals in the association between respiration rate and mass in the final instar. Overall, the results provide partial support for the ODIM hypothesis and suggest that oxygen limitation may emerge gradually within a larval instar. The results also suggest that there may be different moult induction mechanisms in larva-to-larva moults compared with the final metamorphic moult.",2016,10.1242/jeb.140442,219,19,3061-3071,NA,Critical mass; Growth; Larval instar; Metabolic rate; Pieris napi; Respirometry

J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Maximal performance is an essential metric for understanding many aspects of an organism's biology, but it can be difficult to determine because a measured maximum may reflect only a peak level of effort, not a physiological limit. We used a unique opportunity provided by a frog jumping contest to evaluate the validity of existing laboratory estimates of maximum jumping performance in bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana). We recorded video of 3124 bullfrog jumps over the course of the 4-day contest at the Calaveras County Jumping Frog Jubilee, and determined jump distance from these images and a calibration of the jump arena. Frogs were divided into two groups: `rental' frogs collected by fair organizers and jumped by the general public, and frogs collected and jumped by experienced, `professional' teams. A total of 58\% of recorded jumps surpassed the maximum jump distance in the literature (1.295 m), and the longest jump was 2.2 m. Compared with rental frogs, professionally jumped frogs jumped farther, and the distribution of jump distances for this group was skewed towards long jumps. Calculated muscular work, historical records and the skewed distribution of jump distances all suggest that the longest jumps represent the true performance limit for this species. Using resampling, we estimated the probability of observing a given jump distance for various sample sizes, showing that large sample sizes are required to detect rare maximal jumps. These results show the importance of sample size, animal motivation and physiological conditions for accurate maximal performance estimates.",2013,10.1242/jeb.090357,216,21,3947-3953,NA,jumping; muscle; frog; anuran; elastic; contest
article,Cold exposure increases intestinal paracellular permeability to nutrients in the mouse,"Price, Edwin R. and Ruff, Lisa J. and Guerra, Alberto and Karasov, William H.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In situations of increased energy demand and food intake, animals can often acclimate within several days. The intestine generally responds to elevated digestive demand by increasing in size. However, there is likely a limit to how quickly the intestine can grow to meet the new demand. We investigated the immediate and longer-term changes to intestinal properties of the mouse when suddenly exposed to 4 C. We hypothesized that paracellular permeability to nutrients would increase as part of an immediate response to elevated absorptive demand. We measured absorption of L-arabinose, intestinal size and gene expression of several tight junction proteins (claudin-2, claudin-4, claudin-15 and ZO-1) at three time points: pre-exposure, and after 1. day and 2. weeks of cold exposure. Cold exposure increased food intake by 62\% after 2. weeks but intake was not significantly increased after 1. day. Intestinal wet mass was elevated after 1. day and throughout the experiment. Absorption of arabinose rose by 20\% after 1. day in the cold and was 33\% higher after 2. weeks. Expression of claudin-2 increased after 1. day of cold exposure, but there were no changes in expression of any claudin genes when normalized to ZO-1 expression. Our results indicate that intestinal mass can respond rapidly to increased energy demand and that increased paracellular permeability is also part of that response. Increased paracellular permeability may be a consequence of enterocyte hyperplasia, resulting in more tight junctions across which molecules can absorb.",2013,10.1242/jeb.088203,216,21,4065-4070,NA,claudin; paracellular absorption; cold; arabinose; intestinal acclimation; tight junction

We fed pregnant females with either low or high food levels for 6 weeks and quantified the consequences for offspring size and body fat at birth and 1 week after birth. We further measured fast-start escape performance of offspring at birth, as well as swimming kinematics during prey capture at 0, 2 and 7 days after birth.

Moreover, it impacted the locomotor performance of offspring during prey capture at birth and during the first week after birth. We did not observe an effect of food restriction on fast-start escape performance of offspring. Our study suggests that matrotrophic poeciliid fish are maladapted to unpredictably fluctuating resource environments, because sudden reductions in maternal food availability during pregnancy result in smaller offspring with slower postnatal body fat gain and an inhibition of postnatal improving swimming skills during feeding, potentially leading to lower competitive abilities after birth.",2022,10.1242/jeb.242850,225,2,NA,jeb242850,Life-history; Matrotrophy; Placenta; Placentotrophy; Poeciliidae; Viviparity

To date, however, no studies have gauged whether there are significant energetic costs to social call production in bats, which heavily rely on acoustic communication for a diversity of social tasks. We measured energetic expenditure during acoustic signaling in Spix's disc-winged bats (Thyroptera tricolor), a species that commonly uses contact calls to locate the ephemeral furled leaves that they use for roosting. To determine the cost of sound production, we measured oxygen consumption using intermittent-flow respirometry methods, with and without social signaling. Our results show that the emission of contact calls significantly increases oxygen consumption; vocal individuals spent, on average, 12.42 kJ more during social signaling trials than they spent during silent trials. We also found that as resting metabolic rate increased in males, there was a decreasing probability that they would emit response calls. These results provide support to the `allocation model', which predicts that only individuals with lower self-maintenance costs can afford to spend energy in additional activities. Our results provide a step forward in our understanding of how physiology modulates behavior, specifically how the costs of call production and resting metabolic rate may explain the differences in vocal behavior among individuals.",2021,10.1242/jeb.238279,224,14,NA,jeb238279,Allocation model; Bats; Energetic expenditure; Resting metabolic rate; Social calls

Reproduction has been shown to increase or reduce oxidative stress under different conditions and to modify mitochondria! performance. We hypothesized that the changes associated with reproduction can alter how animals respond to future oxidative stressors. We tested this theory by comparing the organ-specific mitochondria! response in wild-derived female house mice. Specifically, we examined the effect of an oxidant (X-irradiation) on virgin mice and on mice that had reproduced. We measured liver and skeletal muscle mitochondrial density, respiratory performance, enzyme activity and oxidant production, as well as markers of oxidative damage to tissues. In the liver, prior reproduction prevented a radiation-induced reduction in mitochondrial density and increased mitochondrial respiratory performance. In skeletal muscle, prior reproduction resulted in a radiation-induced decline in mitochondrial density which could reduce the bioenergetic capacity of skeletal muscle mitochondria. Yet, electron transport chain complex I activity in skeletal muscle, which dropped after reproduction, returned to control levels following oxidant exposure. The results of this investigation indicate that prior reproduction alters the response of mitochondria to an oxidative challenge in an organ-specific manner. Such changes could have differential effects on future reproductive performance and risk of death.",2019,10.1242/jeb.195545,222,12,NA,jeb195545,Oxidative stress; Life history; House mice; RCR; Reactive oxygen species

We also used a dietary manipulation, supplementing the natural diet with fish oil (high DHA) or sunflower oil (high linoleic acid) to alter membrane composition and then assessed metabolic rate. In support of the membrane pacemaker hypothesis, DHA proportions increased in membranes from pectoralis muscle, muscle mitochondria and liver during post-hatch development. By contrast, elevated dietary DHA had no effect on resting metabolic rate, despite causing significant changes to membrane lipid composition. During cold challenges, higher metabolic rates were achieved by birds that had lower DHA and higher linoleic acid in membrane phospholipids.

Levels and activity of pro-oxidants and small-molecule and enzymatic antioxidants, and levels of oxidized lipids and proteins in the liver, oxidative skeletal muscle and heart ventricle were quantified in five species of notothenioid fishes differing in the expression of Hb and Mb. Levels of ubiquitinated proteins and rates of protein degradation by the 20S proteasome were also quantified. Although levels of oxidized proteins and lipids, ubiquitinated proteins, and antioxidants were higher in red-blooded fishes than in Hb-less icefishes in some tissues, this pattern did not persist across all tissues. Expression of Mb was not associated with oxidative damage in the heart ventricle, whereas the activity of citrate synthase and the contents of heme were positively correlated with oxidative damage in most tissues. Despite some tissue differences in levels of protein carbonyls among species, rates of degradation by the 20S proteasome were not markedly different, suggesting either alternative pathways for eliminating oxidized proteins or that redox tone varies among species. Together, our data indicate that the loss of Hb and Mb does not correspond with a clear pattern of either reduced oxidative defense or oxidative damage.",2018,10.1242/jeb.162503,221,5,NA,jeb162503,Antarctic fish; Antioxidants; Oxygen-binding proteins; Oxidative damage
article,"Nurse honeybee workers tend capped brood, which does not require feeding, around the clock","Nagari, Moshe and Brenner, Yafit and Bloch, Guy",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"`Nurse' honeybees tend brood around the clock with attenuated or no circadian rhythms, but the brood signals inducing this behavior remain elusive. We first tested the hypothesis that worker circadian rhythms are regulated by brood pheromones. We monitored locomotor activity of individually isolated nurse bees that were exposed to either various doses of larval extract or synthetic brood ester pheromone (BEP). Bees orally treated with larval extract showed attenuated circadian rhythms in one of four tested colonies; a similar but statistically non-significant trend was seen in two additional colonies. Nurse bees treated with synthetic BEP showed rhythm attenuation in one of three tested colonies. Next, we tested the hypothesis that capped brood, which does not require feeding, nevertheless induces around-the-clock activity in nurses. By combining a new protocol that enables brood care by individually isolated nurse bees, detailed behavioral observations and automatic high-resolution monitoring of locomotor activity, we found that isolated nurses tended capped brood around the clock with attenuated circadian rhythms. Bees individually isolated in similar cages but without brood showed strong circadian rhythms in locomotor activity and rest. This study shows for the first time that the need to feed hungry larvae is not the only factor accounting for around-the-clock activity in nurse bees. Our results further suggest that the transition between activity with and without circadian rhythms is not a simple switch triggered by brood pheromones. Around-the-clock tending may enhance brood development and health in multiple ways that include improved larval feeding, thermoregulation or hygienic behavior.",2017,10.1242/jeb.166884,220,22,4130-4140,NA,Apis mellifera; Social behavior; Division of labor; Circadian; Pheromones; Brood care; Plasticity; Hygienic behavior

Russell",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Repeated stimulation of unfatigued rodent fast-twitch skeletal muscle accelerates the kinetics of tension relaxation through an unknown mechanism. This effect varies with muscle type and stimulation parameters, and has been observed at physiological temperatures for submaximal but not maximal contractions. The purpose of this study was to compare relaxation kinetics of C57BL/6 mouse lumbrical muscles ex vivo from maximal isometric force (500 Hz for 20 ms) when evoked before (pre) and after (post) an intervening tetanic contraction at 37 degrees C. During post contractions, we noted significant increases in the rate of tension decline during both the slow linear phase and the fast exponential phase of relaxation, as well as a reduced duration of the slow phase of relaxation compared with pre contractions (all P< 0.05). This is the first demonstration of enhanced slow and fast relaxation phases from maximal isometric tension induced by prior stimulation in intact muscle at a physiological temperature.",2017,10.1242/jeb.158998,220,16,2870-2873,NA,Potentiation; Inorganic phosphate; Contractile kinetics; Skeletal muscle

We compared retinal function of fully metamorphosed, immature Mordacia mordax (which are about to commence parasitic feeding) with those of sexually mature individuals of its non-parasitic derivative M. praecox. We focused on elucidating the retinal adaptations to dim-light environments in these nocturnally active lampreys, using electroretinography to determine the temporal resolution (flicker fusion frequency, FFF) and temporal contrast sensitivity of enucleated eyecups at different temperatures and light intensities. FFF was significantly affected by temperature and light intensity. Critical flicker fusion frequency (cFFF, the highest FFF recorded) of M. praecox and M. mordax increased from 15.1 and 21.8 Hz at 9 degrees C to 31.1 and 36.9 Hz at 24 degrees C, respectively. Contrast sensitivity of both species increased by an order ofmagnitude between 9 and 24 degrees C, but remained comparatively constant across all light intensities. Although FFF values for Mordacia spp. are relatively low, retinal responses showed a particularly high contrast sensitivity of 625 in M. praecox and 710 in M. mordax at 24 degrees C. This suggests selective pressures favour low temporal resolution and high contrast sensitivity in both species, thereby enhancing the capture of photons and increasing sensitivity in their light-limited environments. FFF indicated all retinal photoreceptors exhibit the same temporal response. Although the slow response kinetics (i.e. low FFF) and saturation of the response at bright light intensities characterise the photoreceptors of both species as rod-like, it is unusual for such a photoreceptor to be functional under scotopic and photopic conditions.",2017,10.1242/jeb.150383,220,7,1245-1255,NA,Flicker fusion frequency; Electroretinography; Retinal adaptations; Dim-light vision

This study addresses characteristics of the first two steps in glucose utilization in the gas gland of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Glucose metabolism by isolated gas gland cells was 12- and 170-fold higher, respectively, than that in heart and red blood cells (RBCs) as determined by the production of (H2O)-H-3 from {[}2-H-3] glucose. In the gas gland, essentially all of the glucose consumed was converted to lactate. Glucose uptake in the gas gland shows a very high dependence upon facilitated transport as evidenced by saturation of uptake of 2-deoxyglucose at a low extracellular concentration and a requirement for high levels of cytochalasin B for uptake inhibition despite the high efficacy of this treatment in heart and RBCs. Glucose transport is via glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), which is localized to the glandular cells. GLUT1 western blot analysis from whole-tissue lysates displayed a band with a relative molecular mass of 52 kDa, consistent with the deduced amino acid sequence. Levels of 52 kDa GLUT1 in the gas gland were 2.3- and 33-fold higher, respectively, than those in heart and RBCs, respectively. Glucose phosphorylation is catalysed by hexokinase Ib (HKIb), a paralogue that cannot bind to the outer mitochondrial membrane. Transcript levels of HKIb in the gas gland were 52- and 57-fold more abundant, respectively, than those in heart and RBCs. It appears that high levels of GLUT1 protein and an unusual isoform of HKI are both critical for the high rates of glycolysis in gas gland cells.",2016,10.1242/jeb.141721,219,17,2763-2773,NA,Glucose metabolism; Heart; RBC; {[}2-H-3]glucose; Facilitated transport
article,The metabolic cost of incline locomotion in the Svalbard rock ptarmigan (<i>Lagopus muta hyperborea</i>): the effects of incline grade and seasonal fluctuations in body mass,"Lees, John and Folkow, Lars and Stokkan, Karl-Arne and Codd, Jonathan",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In a terrestrial environment animals must locomote over varying terrain; despite this, the majority of studies of animal locomotion focus on level locomotion. The influence moving up an inclined surface has on the metabolic cost of locomotion and the efficiency with which animals perform positive work against gravity is still not well understood. Generally speaking, existing data sets lack consistency in the use of grades, further compounded by differences between species in terms of morphology and locomotor gait. Here we investigated the metabolic cost of locomotion using respirometry in the Svalbard ptarmigan (Lagopus muta hyperborea). The Svalbard ptarmigan provides a unique opportunity to investigate the cost of incline locomotion as it undergoes a seasonal fluctuation in body mass, which doubles in winter, meaning the requirement for positive mechanical work also fluctuates with season. We demonstrate that at the same degree of incline, the cost of lifting 1 kg by 1 vertical metre remains relatively constant between seasons despite the large differences in body mass from summer to winter. These findings are consistent with the notion that positive mechanical work alone dictates the cost of lifting above a certain body mass. However, our data indicate that this cost may vary according to the degree of incline and gait.",2013,10.1242/jeb.078709,216,8,1355-1363,NA,Arctic; energetics; ptarmigan; respirometry

In this study, we used western blotting and immunofluorescence techniques to demonstrate for the first time that pig spermatozoa express PPAR gamma. To investigate the functional role of PPAR. in pig sperm, we evaluated its action on different events that characterize the biology of sperm cells, i.e. motility, capacitation, viability and acrosome reaction, using the PPAR gamma-agonist 15-deoxy-12,14-prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2). In responses to PGJ2 treatment, motility, cholesterol efflux and tyrosine phosphorylation were increased, which broadens the role of PPAR gamma from that previously described in the literature, as it also acts to improve sperm functionality. To further our understanding of the significance of PPA gamma in pig sperm, we focused its effects on lipid and glucose metabolism. Evaluation of triglyceride content and lipase, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and G6PDH activities suggests that PPAR gamma induces energy expenditure in pig spermatozoa. These data represent a meaningful advance in the field of sperm energy metabolism. Taken together, our results demonstrate for the first time that PPAR gamma is expressed by pig sperm, thus improving its functionalities in terms of motility, capacitation, acrosome reaction, survival and metabolism.",2013,10.1242/jeb.079327,216,6,1085-1092,NA,spermatozoa; prostaglandin; reproduction; nuclear receptor; PPARgamma

R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The anaesthetic isoeugenol has been used as metabolic suppressant for commercial transport of live lobsters in order to decrease energy expenditure and improve survival. Given the central role of mitochondria in metabolism and structural similarities of isoeugenol to the mitochondrial electron carrier coenzyme Q, we explored the influence on mitochondrial function of isoeugenol. Mitochondrial function was measured using high-resolution respirometry and saponin-permeabilised heart fibres from the Australasian red spiny lobster, Jasus edwardsii. Relative to vehicle (polysorbate), isoeugenol inhibited respiration supported by complex I (CI) and cytochrome c oxidase (CCO). While complex II (CII), which also reduces coenzyme Q, was largely unaffected by isoeugenol, respiration supported by CII when uncoupled was depressed. Titration of isoeugenol indicates that respiration through CI has a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 2.4 +/- 0.1 mu mol l(-1), and a full-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC100) of approximately 6.3 mu mol l(-1). These concentrations are consistent with those used for transport and euthanasia of J. edwardsii and indicate that CI is a possible target of isoeugenol, like many other anaesthetics with quinone-like structures.",2022,10.1242/jeb.242771,225,12,NA,jeb242771,Crustacean; Coenzyme Q; Quinone; Mitochondria

In addition to the sun, the gradient of radiance and the spectral distribution across the sky could provide directional information that T. saltator can potentially use to orient itself during the day even when the sun is not visible (e.g. cloudy sky). The scope of this work was (1) to determine the intensity levels of sky radiance that the sandhoppers use in their zonal recovery and (2) to investigate whether this species relies on the celestial spectral gradient in its zonal recovery. Sandhoppers were tested in the laboratory under artificial radiance or spectral gradients. Our results show that under an artificial sky simulating the natural radiance gradient on a cloudless day, sandhoppers orientated toward the correct seaward direction of their home beach; however, individuals lost their ability to use the intensity gradient as an orientation cue when the radiance was attenuated by at least 40\%. Sandhoppers were also able to head in the correct seaward direction of their home beach at any time of the day by using the spectral gradient as their only source of visual orientation reference.",2021,10.1242/jeb.239574,224,2,NA,jeb239574,Sky radiance; Spectral gradient; Orientation; Sandhopper; Talitrus saltator
article,Flight muscle power increases with strain amplitude and decreases with cycle frequency in zebra finches (<i>Taeniopygia guttata</i>),"Bahlman, Joseph W. and Baliga, Vikram B. and Altshuler, Douglas L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Birds that use high flapping frequencies can modulate aerodynamic force by varying wing velocity. which is primarily a function of stroke amplitude and wingbeat frequency. Previous measurements from zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) flying across a range of speeds in a wind tunnel demonstrate that although the birds modulated both wingbeat kinematic parameters, they exhibited greater changes in stroke amplitude. These two kinematic parameters contribute equally to aerodynamic force, so the preference for modulating amplitude over frequency may instead derive from limitations of muscle physiology at high frequency. We tested this hypothesis by developing a novel in situ work loop approach to measure muscle force and power output from the whole pectoralis major of zebra finches. This method allowed for multiple measurements over several hours without significant degradation in muscle power. We explored the parameter space of stimulus, strain amplitude and cycle frequencies measured previously from zebra finches, which revealed overall high net power output of the muscle, despite substantial levels of counter-productive power during muscle lengthening. We directly compared how changes to muscle shortening velocity via strain amplitude and cycle frequency affected muscle power. Increases in strain amplitude led to increased power output during shortening with little to no change in power output during lengthening. In contrast, increases in cycle frequency did not lead to increased power during shortening but instead increased counterproductive power during lengthening. These results demonstrate why at high wingbeat frequency, increasing wing stroke amplitude could be a more effective mechanism to cope with increased aerodynamic demands.",2020,10.1242/jeb.225839,223,21,NA,jeb225839,Pectoralis major; Work loop; Skeletal muscle; Bird flight

The kinematics, oxygen uptake (<(V)over dot >(O2)), ventilation and heart rate of 24 subjects were sampled during climbing one and two flights of stairs while using the two gaits. Although motor acts were very short in time (5-22 s), metabolic kinetics, extending into the 250 s after the end of climbing, consistently reflected the (metabolic equivalent of the) required mechanical energy and allowed comparison of the two ascent choices: despite a 250\% higher mechanical power associated with running, measured <(V)over dot>(O2), ventilation and heart rate peaked at only +25\% with respect to walking, and in both gaits at much lower values than <(V)over dot >(O2,max) despite predictions based on previous gradient locomotion studies. Mechanical work and metabolic cost of transport, as expected, showed a similar increase (+25\%) in running. For stairs up to a height of 4.8 m (30 steps at 53\% gradient), running makes us consume slightly more calories than walking, and in both gaits with no discomfort at all. The cardio-respiratory-metabolic responses similarly delay and dampen the replenishment of phosphocreatine stores, which were depleted much faster during the impulsive, highly powered mechanical event, with almost overlapping time courses. This discrepancy between mechanical and metabolic dynamics allows us to afford climbs ranging from almost to very anaerobic, and to interchangeably decide whether to walk or run up a short flight of stairs.",2020,10.1242/jeb.218982,223,19,NA,jeb218982,Mechanics; Metabolism; <(V)over dot >(O2) kinetics; Incline locomotion; Pulse exercise

Nicolas",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The perception. processing and response to environmental challenges involves the activation of the immuno-neuroendocrine (INE) interplay. Concerted environmental challenges might induce trade-off when resource allocation to one trait occurs at the expense of another, also producing potential transgenerational effects in the offspring. We evaluated whether concerted challenges, in the form of an immune inoculum against inactivated Salmonella enteritidis (immune challenge, ICH) and a chronic heat stress (CHS) exposure on adult Japanese quail, modulate the INE responses of the parental generation and their offspring. Adults were inoculated and later exposed to a CHS along nine consecutive days. For the last 5 days of the CHS, eggs were collected for incubation. Chicks were identified according to their parental treatments and remained undisturbed. Induced inflammatory response, heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio and specific humoral response against sheep red blood cells (SRBC) were evaluated in both generations. Regardless of the ICH, stressed adults showed a reduced inflammatory response and an elevated H/L ratio compared with controls. In offspring, the inflammatory response was elevated and the specific SRBC antibody titres were diminished in those chicks prenatally exposed to CHS, regardless of the ICH. No differences were found in the H/L ratio of the offspring. Together, our results suggest that CHS exposure influences the INE interplay of adult quail, establishing trade-offs within their immune system. Moreover, CHS not only affected parental INE responses but also modulated their offspring INE responses, probably affecting their potential to respond to future challenges. The adaptability of the developmental programming of offspring would depend on the environment encountered.",2020,10.1242/jeb.219386,223,17,NA,jeb219386,Chronic heat stress; Immune challenge; Salmonella; Transgenerational effects; Trade-offs; Developmental programming

In order to explore the mechanism of dopamine (DA) regulation, we investigated hemolymph neuroendocrine hormones, gill intracellular signaling pathways, ion and ammonia transporters, hemolymph osmolality and ammonia concentration in Litopenaeus vannamei after injection of 10(-7) and 10(-6) mol DA per shrimp. The data showed a significant increase in crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) concentration at 1-12 h and a transient significant decrease in corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol concentration under DA stimulation. The up-regulation of guanylyl cyclase (GC) mRNA, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and protein kinase G (PKG) concentration, together with the down-regulation of DA receptor D-4 mRNA and up-regulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), protein kinase A (PKA), diacylglycerol (DAG) and protein kinase C (PKC) concentration suggested the activation of complicated intracellular signaling pathways. The expression of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), FXYD2 and 14-3-3 protein mRNA was significantly increased by PKA regulation. The increase in Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) activity and the stabilization of V-type Fr-ATPase (V-rATPase) activity were accompanied by an up-regulation of K+ channel, Na+/K+/2Cl(-) cotransporter (NKCC), Rh protein and vesicle associated membrane protein (VAMP) mRNA, resulting in an increase in hemolymph osmolality and a decrease in hemolymph ammonia concentration. These results suggest that DA stimulates the secretion of CHH and inhibits the release of cortisol, which activates intracellular signaling factors to facilitate ion and ammonia transport across the gills, and may not affect intracellular acidification.",2019,10.1242/jeb.204073,222,15,NA,jeb204073,Biogenic amine; Hormone; Second messenger; Protein kinase; Ammonia transport

In some social insects, dominance status is used to determine a reproductive division of labor, where a few colony members reproduce while most remain functionally sterile. Changes in reproduction and behavior in this context must be coordinated through crosstalk between the brain and the reproductive system. We investigated a role for biogenic amines in forming this connection in the ant Harpegnathos saltator. In this species, workers engage in an elaborate dominance tournament to establish a group of reproductive workers termed gamergates. We analyzed biogenic amine content in the brains of gamergates, inside-workers and foragers under stable colony conditions and found that gamergates had the highest levels of dopamine. Dopamine levels were also positively correlated with increased ovarian activity among gamergates. Next, we experimentally induced workers to compete in a reproductive tournament to determine how dopamine may be involved in the establishment of a new hierarchy. Dopamine levels rose in aggressive workers at the start of a tournament, while workers that were policed by their nestmates (a behavior that inhibits ovarian activity) showed a rapid decline in dopamine. In addition to dopamine, levels of serotonin and tyramine differed among castes, and these changes could contribute to differences in caste-specific behavioral patterns observed among non-reproductive workers. Overall, these results provide support that biogenic amines link changes in behavior and dominance with reproductive activity in H. saltator as well as drive differences in worker task performance.",2014,10.1242/jeb.098301,217,9,1496-1503,NA,Biogenic amines; Dopamine; Dominance; Aggression; Social insects

Eleven runners (aged 29-54 years) participated in an ultraendurance competition consisting of three running stages of 25, 55 and 13km on three consecutive days. Anthropometric characteristics, body composition, morphological properties of the gastrocnemius medialis, maximal explosive power of the lower limb and V-O2,V-max were determined before the competition. In addition, biomechanics of running and CoT were determined, before and immediately after each running stage. Performance was directly proportional to V-O2,V-max (r=0.77) and F (r= 0.36), and inversely proportional to CoT (r=-0.30). Low CoT values were significantly related to high maximal power of the lower limbs (r=-0.74) and vertical stiffness (r=-0.65) and low footprint index (FPI, r-0.70), step frequency (r-0.62) and external work (r=0.60). About 50\% of the increase in CoT during the stages of the competition was accounted for by changes in FPI, which represents a global evaluation of medio-lateral displacement of the foot during the whole stance phase, which in turn is associated with the myotendinous characteristics of the lower limb. Thus, lower CoT values were related to greater muscular power and lower FPI, suggesting that a better ankle stability is likely to achieve better performance in an ultra-endurance running competition.",2014,10.1242/jeb.091645,217,5,787-795,NA,Maximal oxygen uptake; Ultra-marathon; Kinematics; Stiffness; Energy cost of running

Yet, arboreal species show morphological specializations relative to other ecological specialists allowing them to hold on to narrow substrates. However, almost nothing is known about the effects of substrate characteristics on locomotion in frogs. Here, we quantified the 3D kinematics of forelimb movement for frogs moving across branches of different diameters (1 and 40 mm) and two different inclines (horizontal and 45 deg uphill). Our results show that grip types differ while moving across substrates of different diameters and inclines. The kinematics of the wrist, elbow and shoulder as well as the body position relative to the substrate also showed significant effects of individual, diameter and incline. Kinematic differences involved duration, velocity of movement and angular excursions. Differences were most pronounced for the proximal joints of the forelimb and effects for substrate diameter were greater than for incline. Interestingly, the effects of diameter and incline on both grip type and kinematics are similar to what has been observed for lizards and primates, suggesting that the mechanics of narrow substrate locomotion drive the kinematics of movement independent of morphology and phylogeny.",2013,10.1242/jeb.090027,216,19,3599-3605,NA,kinematics; movement; fine branch milieu; grasping; walking

Two subspecies of red knot (Calidris canutus rogersi and C. c. piersmai) use northern Bohai Bay, Yellow Sea, China, for the final prebreeding stopover, during their 10,000-15,000. km long migrations between wintering and breeding areas. Here, they feed on small bivalves, especially 2-7. mm long Potamocorbula laevis. With an average stay of 29 days, and the need to store 80 g of fat for the onward flights to high-Arctic breeding grounds, red knots need to refuel fast. Using existing knowledge, we expected them to achieve this on the basis of (1) prey with high flesh to shell mass ratios, (2) large gizzards to crush the ingested molluscs, or (3) a combination of the two. Rejecting all three predictions, we found that red knots staging in Bohai Bay had the smallest gizzards on record (4.9 +/- 0.8 g, mean +/- s.e.m., N=27), and also found that prey quality of P. laevis is much lower than predicted for the measured gizzard size (i.e. 1.3 rather than the predicted 4.5 kJ. g(-1) dry shell mass, DMshell). The estimated handling time of P. laevis (0.2 s) is much shorter than the observed time between two prey ingestions (0.7 s), indicating that prey handling time is no constraint. Based on field observations of dropping rates and on indoor digestion trails, the shell processing rate was estimated at 3.9 mg DMshell s(-1), i.e. three times higher the rate previously predicted for red knots eating as fast as they can with the measured gizzard size. This is explained by the small and easily crushed P. laevis enabling high processing rates. As P. laevis also occurred in high densities, the metabolizable energy intake rate of red knots with small gizzards at 5 J s(-1) was as high as at northward staging sites elsewhere in the world. Currently, therefore, food characteristics in Bohai Bay are such that red knots can refuel fast whilst economizing on the size of their gizzard.

article,Ontogeny of risk assessment and escape-hatching performance by red-eyed treefrog embryos in two threat contexts,"Guell, Brandon A. and Jung, Julie and Almanzar, Adeline and Cuccaro-Diaz, Juliana and Warkentin, Karen M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Arboreal embryos of red-eyed treefrogs, Agalychnis callidryas, hatch prematurely in response to hypoxia when flooded and to mechanosensory cues in snake attacks, but hatching later improves tadpole survival. We studied ontogenetic changes in risk assessment and hatching performance of embryos in response to flooding and physical disturbance. We hypothesized that risk assessment decreases as hatchling survival improves and hatching performance increases as embryos develop. Because snakes eat faster than embryos asphyxiate, we hypothesized that embryos decide to hatch sooner and hatch faster in response to mechanosensory cues. We video-recorded individual embryos hatching in response to each cue type, then compared the incidence and timing of a series of events and behaviors from cue onset to complete hatching across ages and stimuli. Latency from cue to hatching decreased developmentally in both contexts and was shorter with mechanosensory cues, but the elements contributing to those changes differed. Hypoxia assessment involved position changes, which decreased developmentally along with assessment time. Mechanosensory cue assessment occurred more rapidly, without movement, and decreased with age. The first stages of hatching, membrane rupture and head emergence, were surprisingly age independent but faster with mechanosensory cues, congruent with greater effort under more immediate risk. In contrast, body emergence and compression showed ontogenetic improvement consistent with morphological constraints but no cue effect. Both appropriate timing and effective performance of hatching are necessary for continued development. Different stages of the process vary with development and environmental context, suggesting combinations of adaptive context- and stage-dependent behavior, cue-related constraints on information acquisition, and ontogenetic constraints on elements of performance.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244533,225,20,NA,NA,Behavioral latency; Embryo behavior; Environmentally cued hatching; Information sampling; Ontogenetic adaptation; Phenotypic plasticity

M. and Cyrino, Joao C. and Nogueira, Leticia A. K. and Gomes, Fernando R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Mammals show immune up-regulation and increased plasma and local (gastrointestinal tract) concentrations of some immunoregulatory hormones, such as corticosterone and melatonin, after feeding. However, little is known about the endocrine and immune modulation in the postprandial period of ectothermic animals. This study investigated the effects of feeding on endocrine and immune responses in the bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus). Frogs were fasted for 10 days and divided into two groups: fasted and fed with fish feed (5\% of body mass). Blood and gastrointestinal tract tissues (stomach and intestine) were collected at 6, 24, 48, 96 and 168 h to measure neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, plasma bacterial killing ability, phagocytosis of blood leukocytes, plasma corticosterone and melatonin, and stomach and intestine melatonin. Feeding increased plasma corticosterone at 24 h and decreased it at 168 h, and increased neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio at 6, 24 and 96 h. We also observed decreased bacterial killing ability 48 h after feeding. Stomach melatonin increased after 17 days of fasting. We show that feeding activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal axis and promotes transient immunosuppression, without stimulating an inflammatory response. Increased corticosterone may mobilize energy to support digestive processes and melatonin may protect the stomach during fasting. We conclude that feeding modulates secretion of immunoregulatory hormones, initially increasing plasma corticosterone levels, followed by a decrease at the end of meal digestion, and causes systemic immune cell redistribution, increasing neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio for almost the entire period of meal digestion in bullfrogs. Also, fasting modulates secretion of melatonin in the stomach.",2021,10.1242/jeb.243153,224,22,NA,jeb243153,Anuran; Corticosterone; Fasting; Feeding; Melatonin; Immune response

Individuals living in large groups were overall more resistant to instability but were seemingly slower to recover from perturbation. Members of small groups were more vulnerable to instability but recovered faster.

This is achieved using eyes specialized for discerning fine detail, but there has been minimal research on the capacity that salticids might have for visual performance under low ambient light levels. Here, we investigated the capacity of two salticid species, Cyrba algerina from Portugal and Cyrba ocellata from Kenya, to perform two specific visual tasks under low ambient light levels. We used lures made from spiders and midges in prey-identification experiments and mirror images (virtual conspecifics) in rival-identification experiments. These experiments were implemented under a range of ambient light levels (234, 1.35, 0.54, 0.24 cd m(-2)). In most instances, C. algerina and C. ocellata were proficient at performing both of these visual tasks when ambient light was 234 and 1.35 cd m(-2), and a minority performed these tasks at 0.54 cd m(-2), but none succeeded when the light level was 0.24 cd m(-2).

article,Cuticular gas exchange by Antarctic sea spiders,"Lane, Steven J. and Moran, Amy L. and Shishido, Caitlin M. and Tobalske, Bret W. and Woods, H. Arthur",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Many marine organisms and life stages lack specialized respiratory structures, like gills, and rely instead on cutaneous respiration, which they facilitate by having thin integuments. This respiratory mode may limit body size, especially if the integument also functions in support or locomotion. Pycnogonids, or sea spiders, are marine arthropods that lack gills and rely on cutaneous respiration but still grow to large sizes. Their cuticle contains pores, which may play a role in gas exchange. Here, we examined alternative paths of gas exchange in sea spiders: (1) oxygen diffuses across pores in the cuticle, a common mechanism in terrestrial eggshells, (2) oxygen diffuses directly across the cuticle, a common mechanism in small aquatic insects, or (3) oxygen diffuses across both pores and cuticle. We examined these possibilities by modeling diffusive oxygen fluxes across all pores in the body of sea spiders and asking whether those fluxes differed from measured metabolic rates. We estimated fluxes across pores using Fick's law parameterized with measurements of pore morphology and oxygen gradients. Modeled oxygen fluxes through pores closely matched oxygen consumption across a range of body sizes, which means the pores facilitate oxygen diffusion. Furthermore, pore volume scaled hypermetrically with body size, which helps larger species facilitate greater diffusive oxygen fluxes across their cuticle. This likely presents a functional trade-off between gas exchange and structural support, in which the cuticle must be thick enough to prevent buckling due to external forces but porous enough to allow sufficient gas exchange.",2018,10.1242/jeb.177568,221,8,NA,jeb177568,Arthropod; Cuticle; Metabolism; Oxygen; Polar gigantism; Pycnogonids

Accordingly, refractive errors are frequently assessed in vertebrates, but not in the very small invertebrate eyes. We describe a micro-ophthalmoscope that takes advantage of autofluorescent properties of invertebrate photoreceptors and test the device on the relatively well-understood eyes of jumping spiders and flies. In each case, our measurements confirmed previous findings with a greater degree of accuracy. For example, we could precisely resolve the layering of the anterior median eyes and could map out the extensive retina of the anterior lateral eyes of the spider. Measurements also confirmed that fly ommatidia are focused into infinity, but showed that their focal plane is situated slightly below the receptor surface. In contrast to other approaches, this device does not rely on reflective tapeta and allows for precise optical assessment of diverse invertebrate eyes.",2017,10.1242/jeb.166629,220,22,4095-4100,NA,Optics; Spiders; Flies; Retina; Invertebrate vision; Refractive error
article,Synchronous activity lowers the energetic cost of nest escape for sea turtle hatchlings,"Rusli, Mohd Uzair and Booth, David T. and Joseph, Juanita",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"A potential advantage of group movement in animals is increased locomotion efficiency. This implies a reduced energetic cost for individuals that occur in larger groups such as herds, flocks and schools. When chelonian hatchlings hatch in the underground nest with finite energy for their post-hatching dispersal phase, they face the challenge of minimizing energetic expenditure while escaping the nest. The term `social facilitation' has been used to describe the combined digging effort of sea turtle hatchlings during nest escape. Given that in a normal clutch, a substantial part of the energy reserve within the residual yolk is used by hatchlings in the digging out process, a decreased cohort size may reduce the energy reserve available to cross the beach and sustain the initial swimming frenzy. This hypothesis was experimentally tested by varying cohort size in hatchling green turtles (Chelonia mydas) and measuring energy expenditure during the nest escape process using open-flow respirometry. The energetic cost of escaping through 40 cm of sand was calculated to vary between 4.4 and 28.3 kJ per individual, the cost decreasing as the number of individuals in the cohort increased. This represents 11-68\% of the energy contained in a hatchling's residual yolk at hatching. The reduced energetic cost associated with large cohorts resulted from both a lower metabolic rate per individual and a shortened nest escape time. We conclude that synchronous digging activity of many hatchlings during nest escape evolved not only to facilitate rapid nest emergence but also to reduce the energetic cost to individuals.",2016,10.1242/jeb.134742,219,10,1505-1513,NA,Aggregation behaviour; Social facilitation; Metabolic expenditure; Green turtle; Oxygen consumption; Hatchlings
article,Intraspecific metabolic scaling exponent depends on red blood cell size in fishes,"Luo, Yiping and He, Dingcong and Li, Ge and Xie, Hang and Zhang, Yurong and Huang, Qingda",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The metabolic-level boundaries (MLB) hypothesis and the cell metabolism (CM) hypothesis have been proposed to explain the body mass scaling of metabolic rate. The MLB hypothesis focuses mainly on the influence of the metabolic level on the relative importance of volume and surface area constraints. The CM hypothesis focuses on the variation of cell size as the body grows. The surface area to volume ratio of individual cells may vary among species with different cell sizes, by which surface area constraints on metabolic scaling may change according to the MLB hypothesis. The present study aimed to extend the MLB and the CM hypotheses by proposing that, in addition to metabolic level, the varying cell surface area constraints among species also influence the intraspecific scaling exponents. The red blood cell area (S), and intraspecific scaling exponents for resting (b(R)) and maximum metabolic rates of four species of cyprinids were assessed. The scaling exponents varied among species, but mass-specific resting metabolic rates (RMR) of each species were similar. No significant correlation was found between S and mass-specific RMR among species. As predicted, a significantly negative relationship exists between S and bR among species. The results suggest that the varying bR could be attributed to cell size differences among species, as those with larger cells may face stronger surface boundary limits, as predicted by the MLB hypothesis. This mechanism represents an additional way of relating the MLB and the CM hypotheses and does not exclude another mechanism based on the recent contextual multimodal theory.",2015,10.1242/jeb.117739,218,10,1496-1503,NA,Body mass; Metabolic rate; Erythrocyte

Signals also provide a means for individuals to appear better than they actually are, deceiving opponents and gaining access to resources that would otherwise be unattainable. However, other than resource gains, incentives for dishonest signalling remain unexplored. In this study, we tested the idea that unreliable signallers pay lower metabolic costs for their signals, and that energetic savings could represent an incentive for cheating. We focused on two-toned fiddler crabs (Uca vomeris), a species that frequently uses its enlarged claws as signals of dominance to opponents. Previously, we found that regenerated U. vomeris claws are often large but weak (i.e. unreliable). Here, we found that the original claws of male U. vomeris consumed 43\% more oxygen than weaker, regenerated claws, suggesting that muscle quantity drives variation in metabolic costs.

Here we used fibre-optic and electrochemical microsensors along with variable chlorophyll fluorescence imaging to directly measure lateral light propagation within living coral tissues. Our results show that corals can transfer light laterally within their tissues to a distance of similar to 2 cm. Such light transport stimulates O-2 evolution and photosystem II operating efficiency in areas >0.5-1 cm away from direct illumination. Light is scattered strongly in both coral tissue and skeleton, leading to photon trapping and lateral redistribution within the tissue. Lateral light transfer in coral tissue is a new mechanism by which light is redistributed over the coral colony and we argue that tissue optical properties are one of the key factors in explaining the high photosynthetic efficiency of corals.",2014,10.1242/jeb.091116,217,4,489-498,NA,Coral reef; Tissue optics; Photobiology; Microenvironment; Microsensor; Photosynthesis
article,Dinosaur lactation?,"Else, Paul L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Lactation is a process associated with mammals, yet a number of birds feed their newly hatched young on secretions analogous to the milk of mammals. These secretions are produced from various sections (crop organ, oesophageal lining and proventriculus) of the upper digestive tract and possess similar levels of fat and protein, as well as added carotenoids, antibodies and, in the case of pigeons and doves, epidermal growth factor. Parental care in avian species has been proposed to originate from dinosaurs. This study examines the possibility that some dinosaurs used secretory feeding to increase the rate of growth of their young, estimated to be similar to that of present day birds and mammals. Dinosaur `lactation' could also have facilitated immune responses as well as extending parental protection as a result of feeding newly hatched young in nest environments. While the arguments for dinosaur lactation are somewhat generic, a case study for lactation in herbivorous site-nesting dinosaurs is presented. It is proposes that secretory feeding could have been used to bridge the gap between hatching and establishment of the normal diet in some dinosaurs.",2013,10.1242/jeb.065383,216,3,347-351,NA,nesting; parenting; crop milk; crop; birds; mammals

Here, we describe another shared stress-responsive gene, glycine N-methyltransferase (Gnmt), which is known as a key metabolic switch controlling cellular methylation reactions. We observed Gnmt induction by both abiotic and biotic stressors. We also found increased levels of the GNMT reaction product sarcosine in the midgut after stress, linking metabolic changes with the observed changes in gene regulation. Prior to this study, Gnmt upregulation had not been associated with cellular stress responses in other organisms. To determine whether this novel stress-responsive gene would behave similarly in other bee species, we first characterized the cellular response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in lab-reared adults of the solitary alfalfa leafcutting bee (Megachile rotundata) and compared this with age-matched honey bees. The novel stress gene Gnmt was induced in addition to a number of canonical gene targets induced in both bee species upon induced regulation of cellular methylation reactions is a common feature of bees.

article,Per capita sperm metabolism is density dependent,"Potter, Ashley E. and White, Craig R. and Marshall, Dustin J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"From bacteria to metazoans, higher density populations have lower per capita metabolic rates than lower density populations. The negative covariance between population density and metabolic rate is thought to represent a form of adaptive metabolic plasticity. A relationship between density and metabolism was actually first noted 100 years ago, and was focused on spermatozoa; even then, it was postulated that adaptive plasticity drove this pattern. Since then, contemporary studies of sperm metabolism specifically assume that sperm concentration has no effect on metabolism and that sperm metabolic rates show no adaptive plasticity. We did a systematic review to estimate the relationship between sperm aerobic metabolism and sperm concentration, for 198 estimates spanning 49 species, from protostomes to humans from 88 studies. We found strong evidence that per capita metabolic rates are concentration dependent: both within and among species, sperm have lower metabolisms in dense ejaculates, but increase their metabolism when diluted. On average, a 10 -fold decrease in sperm concentration increased per capita metabolic rate by 35\%. Metabolic plasticity in sperm appears to be an adaptive response, whereby sperm maximize their chances of encountering eggs.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246674,227,6,NA,jeb246674,Respiratory dilution effect; Sperm respiration; Sperm oxygen consumption; Metabolic plasticity; Metabolic ecology of gametes
article,Food and temperature change photoperiodic responses in two vole species,"van Rosmalen, Laura and Hut, Roelof A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Seasonal timing of reproduction in voles is driven by photoperiod. We hypothesized that a negative energy balance can modify spring-programmed photoperiodic responses in the hypothalamus, controlling reproductive organ development. We manipulated energy balance by the `work-for-food' protocol, in which voles were exposed to increasing levels of food scarcity at different ambient temperatures under long photoperiod. We found that in common voles (Microtus arvalis) and tundra voles (Microtus oeconomus), photoperiod-induced pars tuberalis thyroid-stimulating hormone beta-subunit (Tsh beta) expression is reduced to potentially inhibit gonadal development when food is scarce. Reduction in gonadal size is more pronounced in tundra voles, in which anterior hypothalamic Kiss1 is additionally downregulated, especially in males. Low temperature additionally leads to decreased hypothalamic Rfrp expression, which potentially may facilitate further suppression of gonadal growth. Shutting off the photoperiodic axis when food is scarce in spring may be an adaptive response to save energy, leading to delayed reproductive organ development until food resources are sufficient for reproduction, lactation and offspring survival. Defining the mechanisms through which metabolic cues modify photoperiodic responses will be important for a better understanding of how environmental cues impact reproduction.",2021,10.1242/jeb.243030,224,23,NA,jeb243030,Seasonal reproduction; Photoperiodism; Ambient temperature; Food scarcity; Hypothalamic gene expression; Voles

However, for the most part, evidence for costs of increased foraging and/or reproductive effort is weak. Furthermore, despite some experimental evidence demonstrating negative effects of increased foraging and parental effort, the physiological mechanisms underlying costs associated with high workload remain poorly understood. To examine how high workload affects haematology, oxidative stress and reproductive output, we experimentally manipulated foraging effort in captive zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, using a previously described technique, and allowed individuals to breed first in low foraging effort conditions and then in high foraging effort conditions. We found that birds upregulated haematocrit and haemoglobin concentration in response to training. Birds subjected to increased workload during reproduction had lower fecundity, although final reproductive output was not significantly different than that of controls. Offspring of parents subjected to high workload during reproduction also had higher oxidative stress when they were 90 days of age.

E. and Newman, Amy E. M. and Raine, Nigel E. and Mitchell, Greg W. and Norris, D. Ryan",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Migratory insects use a variety of innate mechanisms to determine their orientation and maintain correct bearing. For long-distance migrants, such as the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), these journeys could be affected by exposure to environmental contaminants. Neonicotinoids are synthetic insecticides that work by affecting the nervous system of insects, resulting in impairment of their mobility, cognitive performance, and other physiological and behavioural functions. To examine how neonicotinoids might affect the ability of monarch butterflies to maintain a proper directional orientation on their similar to 4000 km migration, we grew swamp milkweed (Asclepias incarnate) in soil that was either untreated (0 ng g(-1): control) or mixed with low (15 ng g(-1) of soil) or high (25 ng g(-1) of soil) levels of the neonicotinoid clothianidin. Monarch caterpillars were raised on control or clothianidin-treated milkweed and, after pupation, either tested for orientation in a static flight simulator or radio-tracked in the wild during the autumn migration period. Despite clothianidin being detectable in milkweed tissue consumed by caterpillars, there was no evidence that clothianidin influenced the orientation, vector strength (i.e. concentration of direction data around the mean) or rate of travel of adult butterflies, nor was there evidence that morphological traits (i.e. mass and forewing length), testing time, wind speed or temperature impacted directionality. Although sample sizes for both flight simulator and radio-tracking tests were limited, our preliminary results suggest that clothianidin exposure during early caterpillar development does not affect the directed flight of adult migratory monarch butterflies or influence their orientation at the beginning of migration.",2021,10.1242/jeb.230870,224,4,NA,jeb230870,Insect migration; Pollinator conservation; Radio-tracking; Clothianidin

Dental microwear texture analysis (DMTA) is an established method for dietary reconstruction which describes a tooth's surface topography on a micrometre scale. The method has yielded conflicting results as to the effect of external abrasives. In the present study, a feeding experiment was performed on sheep (Ovis aries) fed seven diets of different abrasiveness. Our aim was to discern the individual effects of size (4, 50 and 130 mu m) and concentration (0\%, 4\% and 8\% of dry matter) of abrasives on dental wear, applying DMTA to four tooth positions. Microwear textures differed between individual teeth, but surprisingly, showed no gradient along the molar tooth row, and the strongest differentiation of experimental groups was achieved when combining data of all maxillary molars. Overall, a pattern of increasing height, volume and complexity of the tooth's microscopic surface appeared with increasing size of dietary abrasives, and when compared with the control, the small abrasive diets showed a polishing effect. The results indicate that the size of dietary abrasives is more important for dental microwear texture traces than their concentration, and that different sizes can have opposing effects on the dietary signal. The latter finding possibly explains conflicting evidence from previous experimental DMTA applications. Further exploration is required to understand whether and how microscopic traces created by abrasives translate quantitatively to tissue loss.",2020,10.1242/jeb.220442,223,3,NA,jeb220442,Microtexture; Feeding experiment; Ruminant; Diet; Abrasives; Tooth wear

Here, we show that the likelihood of a strike increases with the strength of the stimulus and that activity in nerves innervating the body wall increases rapidly in response to noxious stimuli. Mechanical and thermal stimuli to the dorsal body wall activate the same sensory unit, suggesting it represents a multimodal neuron. This is further supported by the effects of rapidly repeated thermal or mechanical stimuli, which cause a depression of neuronal responsiveness that is generalized across modalities. Mapping the receptive fields of neurons responding to strong thermal stimuli indicates that these multimodal, nociceptive units are produced by class gamma multidendritic neurons in the body wall.",2020,10.1242/jeb.218859,223,3,NA,jeb218859,Nociception; Caterpillar; Mechanosensation; Strike; Thermosensation; Multidendritic

Given their high whole-organism metabolic rate and the importance of flight in foraging and predator avoidance, flight muscle deterioration and accumulated oxidative stress and tissue deterioration may be an important contributor to physiological senescence in wild birds. As a by-product of aerobic respiration, reactive oxygen species are produced and can cause structural damage within cells. The anti-oxidant system deters oxidative damage to macromolecules. We examined oxidative stress and muscle ultrastructure in thick-billed murres aged 8 to 37 years (N=50) in pectoralis muscle biopsies. When considered in general linear models with body mass, body size and sex, no oxidative stress parameter varied with age. In contrast, there was a decrease in myonuclear domain similar to that seen in human muscle aging. We conclude that for wild birds with very high flight activity levels, muscle ultrastructural changes may be an important contributor to demographic senescence.

We used 72 female great tits from two generations of lines artificially selected for early and late egg laying, which were housed in climate-controlled aviaries and went through two breeding cycles within 1 year. In the first breeding season we obtained individual egg-laying dates, while in the second breeding season, using the same individuals, we sampled several tissues at three time points based on the timing of the first breeding attempt. For each tissue, mRNA expression levels were measured using qPCR for a set of candidate genes associated with the timing of reproduction and subsequently analysed for differences between generations, time points and individual timing of breeding. We found differences in gene expression between generations in all tissues, with the most pronounced differences in the hypothalamus. Differences between time points, and early- and late-laying females, were found exclusively in the ovary and liver. Altogether, we show that fine-tuning of the seasonal timing of breeding, and thereby the opportunity for adaptation in the neuroendocrine system, is regulated mostly downstream in the neuro-endocrine system.",2019,10.1242/jeb.202481,222,17,NA,jeb202481,Reproductive timing; Individual variation; Gene expression; qPCR; Parus major

We report here on an experiment in which Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were reared through the embryonic and larval stages of development, and under differing temperatures, in order to examine the effects of environmental temperature during early life on telomere dynamics, oxidative DNA damage and cellular proliferation. Telomere length significantly increased between the embryonic and larval stages of development. Contrary to our expectations, variation in telomere length at the end of the larval stage was unrelated to either cell proliferation rate or the relative level of oxidative DNA damage, and did not vary between the temperature treatments. This study suggests that salmon are able to restore the length of their telomeres during early development, which may possibly help to buffer potentially harmful environmental effects experienced in early life.",2018,10.1242/jeb.178616,221,11,NA,jeb178616,Oxidative stress; Environmental effect; Cell proliferation; Physiology; Fish; Telomeres
article,Species-specific differences in the fine structure of learning walk elements in <i>Cataglyphis</i> ants,"Fleischmann, Pauline N. and Grob, Robin and Wehner, Rudiger and Roessler, Wolfgang",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Cataglyphis desert ants are famous navigators. Like all central place foragers, they are confronted with the challenge to return home, i.e. relocate an inconspicuous nest entrance in the ground, after their extensive foraging trips. When leaving the underground nest for the first time, desert ants perform a striking behavior, so-called learning walks that are well structured. However, it is still unclear how the ants initially acquire the information needed for sky-and landmark-based navigation, in particular how they calibrate their compass system at the beginning of their foraging careers. Using high-speed video analyses, we show that different Cataglyphis species include different types of characteristic turns in their learning walks. Pirouettes are full or partial rotations (tight turns about the vertical body axis) during which the ants frequently stop and gaze back in the direction of the nest entrance during the longest stopping phases. In contrast, voltes are small walked circles without directed stopping phases. Interestingly, only Cataglyphis ant species living in a cluttered, and therefore visually rich, environment (i.e. C. noda and C. aenescens in southern Greece) perform both voltes and pirouettes. They look back to the nest entrance during pirouettes, most probably to take snapshots of the surroundings. In contrast, C. fortis inhabiting featureless saltpans in Tunisia perform only voltes and do not stop during these turns to gaze back at the nest - even if a set of artificial landmarks surrounds the nest entrance.",2017,10.1242/jeb.158147,220,13,2426-2435,NA,Celestial compass; Central place forager; Panorama snapshot; Spatial orientation; Visual landmark; Vector navigation
article,The ability to survive intracellular freezing in nematodes is related to the pattern and distribution of ice formed,"Raymond, Meliane R. and Wharton, David A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"A few species of nematodes can survive extensive intracellular freezing throughout all their tissues, an event that is usually thought to be fatal to cells. How are they able to survive in this remarkable way? The pattern and distribution of ice formed, after freezing at -10 degrees C, can be observed using freeze substitution and transmission electron microscopy, which preserves the former position of ice as white spaces. We compared the pattern and distribution of ice formed in a nematode that survives intracellular freezing well (Panagrolaimus sp. DAW1), one that survives poorly (Panagrellus redivivus) and one with intermediate levels of survival (Plectus murrayi). We also examined Panagrolaimus sp. in which the survival of freezing had been compromised by starvation. Levels of survival were as expected and the use of vital dyes indicated cellular damage in those that survived poorly (starved Panagrolaimus sp. and P. murrayi). In fed Panagrolaimus sp. the intracellular ice spaces were small and uniform, whereas in P. redivivus and starved Panagrolaimus sp. there were some large spaces that may be causing cellular damage. The pattern and distribution of ice formed was different in P. murrayi, with a greater number of individuals having no ice or only small intracellular ice spaces. Control of the size of the ice formed is thus important for the survival of intracellular freezing in nematodes.",2016,10.1242/jeb.137190,219,13,2060-2065,NA,Intracellular ice; Panagrolaimus; Antarctic; Freeze substitution; Transmission electron microscopy
article,Skating by: low energetic costs of swimming in a batoid fish,"Di Santo, Valentina and Kenaley, Christopher P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"We quantify the oxygen consumption rates and cost of transport (COT) of a benthic batoid fish, the little skate, Leucoraja erinacea, at three swimming speeds. We report that this species has the lowest mass-adjusted swimming metabolic rate measured for any elasmobranch; however, this species incurs a much higher COT at approximately five times the lowest values recorded for some teleosts. In addition, because skates lack a propulsive caudal fin and could not sustain steady swimming beyond a relatively low optimum speed of 1.25 body lengths s(-1), we propose that the locomotor efficiency of benthic rajiform fishes is limited to the descending portion of a single COT-speed relationship. This renders these species poorly suited for long-distance translocation and, therefore, especially vulnerable to regional-scale environmental disturbances.",2016,10.1242/jeb.136358,219,12,1804-1807,NA,COT; Elasmobranch; Locomotion; Metabolic rate; Performance

Lynne and McGowan, Craig P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Locomotion of plantigrade generalists has been relatively little studied compared with more specialised postures even though plantigrady is ancestral among quadrupeds. Bears (Ursidae) are a representative family for plantigrade carnivorans, they have the majority of the morphological characteristics identified for plantigrade species, and they have the full range of generalist behaviours. This study compared the locomotion of adult grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis Linnaeus 1758), including stride parameters, gaits and analysis of three-dimensional ground reaction forces, with that of previously studied quadrupeds. At slow to moderate speeds, grizzly bears use walks, running walks and canters. Vertical ground reaction forces demonstrated the typical M-shaped curve for walks; however, this was significantly more pronounced in the hindlimb. The rate of force development was also significantly higher for the hindlimbs than for the forelimbs at all speeds. Mediolateral forces were significantly higher than would be expected for a large erect mammal, almost to the extent of a sprawling crocodilian. There may be morphological or energetic explanations for the use of the running walk rather than the trot. The high medial forces (produced from a lateral push by the animal) could be caused by frontal plane movement of the carpus and elbow by bears. Overall, while grizzly bears share some similarities with large cursorial species, their locomotor kinetics have unique characteristics. Additional studies are needed to determine whether these characters are a feature of all bears or plantigrade species.",2015,10.1242/jeb.121806,218,19,3102-3109,NA,Quadruped; Plantigrade; Mammal; Mediolateral forces

This question motivated an experimental study on rock sandpipers (Calidris ptilocnemis). The species' nonbreeding range spans 20 deg of latitude, the extremes of which are inhabited by two subspecies: C. p. ptilocnemis that winters primarily in upper Cook Inlet, Alaska (61 degrees N) and C. p. tschuktschorum that overlaps slightly with C. p. ptilocnemis but whose range extends much farther south (similar to 40 degrees N). In view of the strongly contrasting energetic demands of their distinct nonbreeding distributions, we conducted experiments to assess the behavioral, physiological and sensory aspects of foraging and we used the bivalve Macoma balthica for all trials. C. p. ptilocnemis consumed a wider range of prey sizes, had higher maximum rates of energy intake, processed shell waste at higher maximum rates and handled prey more quickly. Notably, however, the two subspecies did not differ in their abilities to find buried prey. The subspecies were similar in size and had equally sized gizzards, but the more northern ptilocnemis individuals were 10-14\% heavier than their same-sex tschuktschorum counterparts. The higher body mass in ptilocnemis probably resulted from hypertrophy of digestive organs (e.g. intestine, liver) related to digestion and nutrient assimilation. Given the previously established equality of the metabolic capacities of the two subspecies, we propose that the high-latitude nonbreeding range of ptilocnemis rock sandpipers is primarily facilitated by digestive (i.e. physiological) aspects of their foraging ecology rather than behavioral or sensory aspects.",2015,10.1242/jeb.108894,218,8,1188-1197,NA,Intake rate; Foraging ecology; Functional response; Nonbreeding distribution; Subspecific differences
article,The repeatability of metabolic rate declines with time,"White, Craig R. and Schimpf, Natalie G. and Cassey, Phillip",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The evolutionary causes of variation in metabolic rate within and among species are a topic of enduring interest. Variation between individuals is the raw material on which natural selection acts, and so recent years have seen an increase in the number of studies that examine the consequences of inter-individual differences in metabolic rate for organismal performance. A minimum requirement for a trait to evolve is that it must differ consistently between individuals, and these differences must be heritable. The time constancy of a trait is assessed by estimating its repeatability, which represents the ratio of the between-individual component of phenotypic variance to total phenotypic variance. A previous meta-analysis of repeatability concluded that metabolic rate is, on average, repeatable. Here, we expand on this earlier analysis by including extra data published in the intervening years and demonstrate that the repeatability of metabolic rate decreases as the interval between measurements increases.",2013,10.1242/jeb.076562,216,10,1763-1765,NA,inter-individual variation; heritability; intraclass correlation

Polly and Lichtwark, Glen A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The human Achilles tendon (AT) has often been considered to act as a single elastic structure in series with the muscles of the triceps surae. As such it has been commonly modelled as a Hookean spring of uniform stiffness. However, the free AT and the proximal AT have distinctly different structures that lend themselves to different elastic properties. This study aimed to use three-dimensional freehand ultrasound imaging to determine whether the proximal AT and the free AT exhibit different elastic behaviour during sub-maximal, fixed-end contractions of the triceps surae. Six male and five female participants (mean +/- s.d. age=27 +/- 5. years) performed fixed position contractions of the plantar-flexors on an isokinetic dynamometer at 50\% of their maximum voluntary contraction in this position. Freehand three-dimensional ultrasound imaging was used to reconstruct the free-tendon and proximal AT at rest and during contraction. The free-tendon exhibited significantly (P=0.03) greater longitudinal strain (5.2 +/- 1.7\%) than the proximal AT (2.6 +/- 2.0\%). The lesser longitudinal strain of the proximal AT was linked to the fact that it exhibited considerable transverse (orthogonal to the longitudinal direction) strains (5.0 +/- 4\%). The transverse strain of the proximal AT is likely due to the triceps surae muscles bulging upon contraction, and thus the level of bulging may influence the elastic behaviour of the proximal AT. This might have implications for the understanding of triceps surae muscle-tendon interaction during locomotion, tendon injury mechanics and previous measurements of AT elastic properties.",2013,10.1242/jeb.077131,216,4,594-600,NA,transverse strain; triceps surae; gastrocnemius; elastic

Nonetheless, it is unclear towhat extent these changes are attributable to the exercise of flight itself versus endogenous changes. Using starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) flying in a wind tunnel, we tested the effects of exercise training, a single bout of flight and dietary lipid composition on pectoralis muscle oxidative enzymes and lipid transporters. Starlings were either unexercised or trained over 2 weeks to fly in a wind tunnel and sampled either immediately following a long flight at the end of this training or after 2 days recovery from this flight. Additionally, they were divided into dietary groups that differed in dietary fatty acid composition (high polyunsaturates versus high monounsaturates) and amount of dietary antioxidant. Trained starlings had elevated (19\%) carnitine palmitoyl transferase and elevated (11\%) hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase in pectoralis muscle compared with unexercised controls, but training alone had little effect on lipid transporters. Immediately following a long windtunnel flight, starling pectoralis had upregulated lipid transportermRNA (heart-type fatty acid binding protein, H-FABP, 4.7-fold; fatty acid translocase, 1.9-fold; plasma membrane fatty acid binding protein, 1.6-fold), and upregulated H-FABP protein (68\%). Dietary fatty acid composition and the amount of dietary antioxidants had no effect on muscle catabolic enzymes or lipid transporter expression. Our results demonstrate that birds undergo rapid upregulation of catabolic capacity that largely becomes available during flight itself, with minor effects due to training.

Yet, the plasticity and capacity for long-term myocardial restructuring and recovery following a restriction in coronary blood supply are unknown. Here, we analyzed the consequences of acute (3 days) and chronic ( from 33 to 62 days) coronary occlusion (i.e. coronary artery ligation) on cardiac morphological characteristics and in vivo function in juvenile rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. Acute coronary artery occlusion resulted in elevated resting heart rate and decreased inter-beat variability, which are both markers of autonomic dysfunction following acute myocardial ischemia, along with severely reduced heart rate scope (maximum-resting heart rate) relative to sham-operated trout. We also observed a loss of myocardial interstitial collagen and compact myocardium. Following long-term coronary artery ligation, resting heart rate and heart rate scope normalized relative to sham-operated trout. Moreover, a distinct fibrous collagen layer separating the compact myocardium into two layers had formed. This may contribute to maintain ventricular integrity across the cardiac cycle or, alternatively, demark a region of the compact myocardium that continues to receive oxygen from the luminal venous blood. Taken together, we demonstrate that rainbow trout may cope with the aversive effects caused by coronary artery obstruction through plastic ventricular remodeling, which, at least in part, restores cardiac performance and myocardium oxygenation.",2021,10.1242/jeb.243578,224,23,NA,jeb243578,Cardiac performance; Cardiac remodeling; Coronary arteriosclerosis; Myocardial infarction

This transition involves upheavals in their energy management as major changes in growth and activity occur. Understanding such ontogenetic transitions in energy allocation has been difficult because collecting continuous data on energy costs in wild developing birds was previously largely impossible. Here, we continuously measured heart rate and fine-scale movements of 20 free-living juvenile white storks (Ciconia ciconia) using on-board biologgers to explore individual and environmental factors relating to daily mean heart rate. In addition, we explored which specific energy management strategy storks use during these crucial early life stages. We found that daily mean heart rate increased with overall movement activity, and increasing body temperature, but that it decreased with age. Further, we found that during the nestling period, when growth costs are high, activity costs are low, and post-fledging that activity costs are increased while maintenance costs are low, indicating a constraint on overall energy use in both phases. Our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that individuals invested more energy per unit time while still in the nest than after fledging despite the high costs of flight.",2020,10.1242/jeb.219337,223,2,NA,jeb219337,Energy management model; Daily energy expenditure; Heart rate; Ciconia ciconia; Ontogeny
article,"Straight arm walking, bent arm running: gait-specific elbow angles","Yegian, Andrew K. and Tucker, Yanish and Gillinov, Stephen and Lieberman, Daniel E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Stereotypically, walking and running gaits in humans exhibit different arm swing behavior: during walking, the arm is kept mostly straight, while during running, the arm is bent at the elbow. The mechanism for this behavioral difference has not been explored before. We hypothesized that a mechanical tradeoff exists between the shoulder joint and the elbow joint. Bending the elbow reduces the radius of gyration of the arm and reduces shoulder muscle torque, but at the price of increasing elbow torque. We predicted that the mechanical tradeoff would result in energetics that favored straight arms during walking and bent arms during running. The hypothesis was tested experimentally by having eight subjects walk and run with both straight arms and bent arms while recording arm swing mechanics, and oxygen consumption in a subset of six subjects. The mechanical tradeoff hypothesis was confirmed, with bent arms reducing normalized shoulder muscle torque in both gaits (walking: -33\%, running: -32\%) and increasing normalized elbow muscle torque in both gaits (walking: +110\%, running: +30\%). Bent arms increased oxygen consumption by 11\% when walking, supporting our prediction that energetics favor straight arms during walking. However, oxygen consumption was equivalent for the straight and bent arm running conditions, and did not support our running prediction. We conclude that straight arms are stereotyped in walking as a result of optimal energetics, while the mechanism leading to bent arms during running remains unknown.",2019,10.1242/jeb.197228,222,13,NA,jeb197228,Arm swing; Locomotion; Biomechanics; Gait
article,Bee and floral traits affect the characteristics of the vibrations experienced by flowers during buzz pollination,"Arroyo-Correa, Blanca and Beattie, Ceit and Vallejo-Marin, Mario",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"During buzz pollination, bees use their indirect flight muscles to produce vibrations that are transmitted to the flowers and result in pollen release. Although buzz pollination has been known for >100 years, we are still in the early stages of understanding how bee and floral characteristics affect the production and transmission of floral vibrations. Here, we analysed floral vibrations produced by four closely related bumblebee taxa (Bombus spp.) on two buzz-pollinated plants species (Solanum spp.). We measured floral vibrations transmitted to the flower to establish the extent to which the mechanical properties of floral vibrations depend on bee and plant characteristics. By comparing four bee taxa visiting the same plant species, we found that peak acceleration, root mean-squared acceleration (RMS) and frequency vary between bee taxa, but that neither bee size (intertegular distance) nor flower biomass (dry mass) affects peak acceleration, RMS or frequency. A comparison of floral vibrations of two bee taxa visiting flowers of two plant species showed that, while bee species affects peak acceleration, RMS and frequency, plant species only affects acceleration ( peak acceleration and RMS), not frequency. When accounting for differences in the transmission of vibrations across the two types of flower, using a species-specific `coupling factor', we found that RMS acceleration and peak displacement do not differ between plant species. This suggests that bees produce the same initial acceleration in different plants but that transmission of these vibrations through the flower is affected by floral characteristics.",2019,10.1242/jeb.198176,222,4,NA,jeb198176,Floral biomechanics; Bombus; Substrate-borne vibrations; Solanum; Sonication

Here, we demonstrate that the type of Wolbachia infection determines the effect on Drosophila melanogaster egg production as a proxy for fecundity, and metabolism of juvenile hormone (JH), which acts as gonadotropin in adult insects. For this study, we used six D. melanogaster lineages carrying the nuclear background of interbred Bi90 lineage and cytoplasmic backgrounds with or without Wolbachia of different genotype variants. The wMeICS genotype of Wolbachia decreases egg production in infected D. melanogaster females in the beginning of oviposition and increases it later (from the sixth day after eclosion), whereas the wMelPop Wolbachia strain causes the opposite effect, and the wMel, wMel2 and wMel4 genotypes of Wolbachia do not show any effect on these traits compared with uninfected 8190 D. melanogasterfemales. The intensity of JH catabolism negatively correlates with the fecundity level in the flies carrying both wMelCS and wMelPop Wolbachia. The JH catabolism in females infected with genotypes of the wMel group does not differ from that in uninfected females. The effects of wMelCS and wMelPop infection on egg production can be levelled by the modulation of JH titre (via precocene/JH treatment of the flies). Thus, at least one of the mechanisms promoting the effect of Wolbachia on D. melanogaster female fecundity is mediated by JH.",2019,10.1242/jeb.195347,222,4,NA,jeb195347,Juvenile hormone; Oocytes; Egg production; Heat stress; Precocene; Fecundity
article,"Deciphering (<i>V</i>) over dot<sub>O2,max</sub>: limits of the genetic approach","Hoppeler, Hans",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Maximal oxygen consumption ((V) over dot(O2,max)) denotes the upper limit of aerobic energy flux through the cascade of oxygen transfer from the environment to tissue mitochondria, essentially to skeletal muscle mitochondria during intense exercise. A high (V) over dot(O2,max )is a key component for athletic success in human and animal endurance sports. From a public health perspective, a high (V) over dot(O2,max) is a validated negative predictor for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. (V) over dot(O2,max) varies by more than twofold between sedentary subjects and shows a heritability value greater than 50\%. Likewise, the capacity for an individual's (V) over dot(O2,max) to be increased with exercise training (i.e. its trainability) varies massively between subjects, independent of each subject's (V) over dot(O2,max) in the absence of training (i.e. their sedentary (V) over dot(O2,max)), and with a similarly high heritability. Athletic as well as public health interests have prompted a search for the genetic profile of sedentary (V) over dot(O2,max) and of trainability. Candidate-gene studies, gene-expression studies and genome-wide-association studies (GWAS) have not been able to identify a genetic signature that distinguishes subjects or athletes with a favorable (V) over dot(O2,max) phenotype or a high trainability from controls. Here, I propose that multigenetic phenotypes such as (V) over dot(O2,max) are emergent properties of multiple underlying transcriptomic networks modified by epistasis, the epigenome and the epitranscriptome.

M. and Craveiro, Giovana and Souza, Anderson de O. and Alberici, Luciane C. and Hartfelder, Klaus",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"During adult life, honey bee workers undergo a succession of behavioral states. Nurse bees perform tasks inside the nest, and when they are about 2-3 weeks old they initiate foraging. This switch is associated with alterations in diet, and with the levels of juvenile hormone and vitellogenin circulating in hemolymph. It is not clear whether this behavioral maturation involves major changes at the cellular level, such as mitochondrial activity and the redox environment in the head, thorax and abdomen. Using highresolution respirometry, biochemical assays and RT-qPCR, we evaluated the association of these parameters with this behavioral change. We found that tissues from the head and abdomen of nurses have a higher oxidative phosphorylation capacity than those of foragers, while for the thorax we found the opposite situation. As higher mitochondrial activity tends to generate more H2O2, and H2O2 is known to stabilize HIF-1 alpha, this would be expected to stimulate hypoxia signaling. The positive correlation that we observed between mitochondrial activity and hif-1 alpha gene expression in abdomen and head tissue of nurses would be in line with this hypothesis. Higher expression of antioxidant enzyme genes was observed in foragers, which could explain their low levels of protein carbonylation. No alterations were seen in nitric oxide (NO) levels, suggesting that NO signaling is unlikely to be involved in behavioral maturation. We conclude that the behavioral change seen in honey bee workers is reflected in differential mitochondrial activities and redox parameters, and we consider that this can provide insights into the underlying aging process.",2017,10.1242/jeb.161844,220,21,4035-4046,NA,Honey bee; High-resolution respirometry; Redox state; Hypoxia signaling; Nitric oxide

Here, we investigated whether diagonal stride cross-country roller skiing (DIA) utilizes similar mechanisms. Based on previous studies, we hypothesized that running and DIA would share similar phase relationships and magnitudes of kinetic energy (KE), and gravitational potential energy (GPE) fluctuations, indicating elastic energy storage and return, as if roller skiing is like `running on wheels'. Experienced skiers (N=9) walked and ran at 1.25 and 3ms(-1), respectively, and roller skied with DIA at both speeds on a level dual-belt treadmill that recorded perpendicular and parallel forces. We calculated the KE and GPE of the center of mass from the force recordings. As expected, the KE and GPE fluctuated with an out-of-phase pattern during walking and an in-phase pattern during running. Unlike walking, during DIA, the KE and GPE fluctuations were in phase, as they are in running. However, during the glide phase, KE was dissipated as frictional heat and could not be stored elastically in the tendons, as in running. Elastic energy storage and return epitomize running and thus we reject our hypothesis.

article,Gait-specific adaptation of locomotor activity in response to dietary restriction in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>,"Lueersen, Kai and Faust, Ulla and Gottschling, Dieter-Christian and Doering, Frank",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Locomotion is crucial for the survival of living organisms, as it allows foraging, flight and mating behaviour. In response to environmental cues, many organisms switch between alternative forms of locomotion, referred to as gaits. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans exhibits two gaits: swimming in liquids and crawling on dense gels. The kinematics and patterns of muscle activity differ between the two gaits, with swimming being less efficient than crawling. We found that C. elegans when grown on dietary restriction (DR) plates and then tested immediately for swimming activity exhibit an accelerated frequency of body-bending swimming compared with ad libitum-fed worms, resulting in an increased swimming speed. This response is independent of the presence or absence of food bacteria in the assay liquid. In contrast, the crawling speed of DR worms on assay agar plates is decreased and influenced by food availability. Because DR also attenuates the disturbed swimming activity of worms that are deficient in the presynaptic dopamine transporter DAT-1, our data link DR-induced alterations of the swimming gait to synaptic processes. This strongly suggests a biochemical rather than a biomechanical response to DR provoked by changes in the worm's body structure. We conclude that the increase in locomotor activity in response to DR is specific to the swimming gait and might represent a survival strategy, allowing food-deprived nematodes to exit unfavourable environments.",2014,10.1242/jeb.099382,217,14,2480-2488,NA,Dietary restriction; Locomotory gait; C. elegans; Dopamine transporter

Overall, black disks moving erratically against a white background were strong releasers of both behaviors. When stimulus presentation order was randomized by size, P. affinis and P. spurca struck at progressively higher rates as the stimuli enlarged up to 44 deg; S. lineola struck most at intermediate sized (10-20 deg) disks. When disks were size-ordered from small to large, P. affinis and S. lineola struck at the smaller disks at higher rates; however, when the order was reversed, the early appearance of large disks suppressed subsequent responses to the smaller disks. Stimulus order did not differentially affect the responses of P. spurca. All species responded at higher rates to black disks moving against a white background versus the reverse. However, only P. spurca and S. lineola responded at higher rates to relatively darker grey disks, only P. affinis responded to mottled grey disks moving against an identically patterned background, and only P. spurca struck more frequently in response to rectangular stimuli oriented parallel (versus orthogonal) to their direction of movement.

The buoyancy provided by an oxygen-filled swim bladder at 74.4 MPa pressure was estimated to be 0.164 N, at a theoretical energy cost of 20 kJ, 200 times less than the cost of equivalent lipid buoyancy. During normal metabolism, 192 days would be required to fill the swimbladder. At these depths, oxygen is very incompressible, so changes in volume during ascent or descent are small. However, swimbladder function is crucially dependent on a very low rate of diffusion of oxygen across the swimbladder wall. The oxygen in the swimbladder could theoretically sustain aerobic metabolism for over 1 year but is unlikely to be used as a reserve.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246522,227,3,NA,jeb246522,Deep-sea fish; Teleosts; Swimbladder; Buoyancy; Hydrostatic pressure; Physiology
article,Background matching can reduce responsiveness of jumping spiders to stimuli in motion,"Tan, Min and Chan, Jeremiah Y. O. and Yu, Long and Tan, Eunice J. and Li, Daiqin",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Motion and camouflage were previously considered to be mutually exclusive, as sudden movements can be easily detected. Background matching, for instance, is a well-known, effective camouflage strategy where the colour and pattern of a stationary animal match its surrounding background. However, background matching may lose its efficacy when the animal moves, as the boundaries of the animal become more defined against its background. Recent evidence shows otherwise, as camouflaged objects can be less detectable than uncamouflaged objects even while in motion. Here, we explored whether the detectability of computer-generated stimuli varies with the speed of motion, background (matching and unmatching) and size of stimuli in six species of jumping spiders (Araneae: Salticidae). Our results showed that, in general, the responsiveness of all six salticid species tested decreased with increasing stimulus speed regardless of whether the stimuli were conspicuous or camouflaged. Importantly, salticid responses to camouflaged stimuli were significantly lower compared with those to conspicuous stimuli. There were significant differences in motion detectability across species when the stimuli were conspicuous, suggesting differences in visual acuity in closely related species of jumping spiders. Furthermore, small stimuli elicited significantly lower responses than large stimuli across species and speeds. Our results thus suggest that background matching is effective even when stimuli are in motion, reducing the detectability of moving stimuli.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246092,227,1,NA,jeb246092,Background matching; Camouflage; Movement; Jumping spiders; Salticidae; Visual acuity; Visual responsiveness
article,<i>Wolbachia</i> manipulate fitness benefits of olfactory associative learning in a parasitoid wasp,"Farahani, Hossein Kishani and Ashouri, Ahmad and Abroon, Pouria and Pierre, Jean-Sebastien and van Baaren, Joan",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Upon encountering a host, a female parasitoid wasp has to decide whether to learn positive or negative cues related to the host. The optimal female decision will depend on the fitness costs and benefits of learned stimuli. Reward quality is positively related to the rate of behavioral acquisition in processes such as associative learning. Wolbachia, an endosymbiotic bacterium, often plays an impressive role in the manipulation of its arthropod host's biology. Here, we studied the responses of two natural Wolbachia infected/uninfected Trichogramma brassicae wasp populations to theoretically highand low-reward values during a conditioning process and the consequences of their responses in terms of memory duration. According to our results, uninfected wasps showed an attraction response to high-value rewards, but showed aversive learning in response to low-value rewards. The memory span of uninfected wasps after conditioning by low-value rewards was significantly shorter than that for high-value rewards. As our results revealed, responses to high-quality hosts will bring more benefits (bigger size, increased fecundity and enhanced survival) than those to lowquality hosts for uninfected wasps. Infected wasps were attracted to conditioned stimuli with the same memory duration after conditioning by both types of hosts. This was linked to the fact that parasitoids emerging from both types of hosts present the same life-history traits. Therefore, these hosts represent the same quality reward for infected wasps. According to the obtained results, it can be concluded that Wolbachia manipulates the learning ability of its host, resulting in the wasp responding to all reward values similarly.",2021,10.1242/jeb.240549,224,11,NA,jeb240549,Conditioning; Aversive learning; Trichogramma brassicae; Wolbachia; Reward

Such dive performance is dependent on many factors, including total body oxygen (O-2) stores. For diving penguins, the respiratory system (air sacs and lungs) constitutes 30-50\% of the total body O-2 store. To better understand the role and mechanism of parabronchial ventilation and O-2 utilization in penguins both on the surface and during the dive, we examined air sac partial pressures of O-2 (P-O2) in emperor penguins (Aptenodytes fasten) equipped with backpack PO2, recorders. Cervical air sac P-O2 values at rest were lower than in other birds, while the cervical air sac to posterior thoracic air sac P-O2 difference was larger. Pre-dive cervical air sac P-O2 values were often greater than those at rest, but had a wide range and were not significantly different from those at rest. The maximum respiratory O-2 store and total body O-2 stores calculated with representative anterior and posterior air sac P-O2 data did not differ from prior estimates. The mean calculated anterior air sac O-2 depletion rate for dives up to 11 min was approximately one-tenth that of the posterior air sacs. Low cervical air sac P-O2 values at rest may be secondary to a low ratio of parabronchial ventilation to parabronchial blood O-2 extraction. During dives, overlap of simultaneously recorded cervical and posterior thoracic air sac P-O2 profiles supported the concept of maintenance of parabronchial ventilation during a dive by air movement through the lungs.",2021,10.1242/jeb.230219,224,1,NA,jeb230219,Antarctica; Anterior air sacs; Avian lung; Aptenodytes forsteri; Parabronchus; Partial pressure of oxygen; Posterior air sacs

We gathered muscle activation data via electromyography (EMG), with simultaneous recordings of biotremors using an accelerometer, to test for the role of hyoid muscles in biotremor production. We recorded a mean biotremor frequency of 150.87 Hz for females and 136.01 Hz for males. The durations of activity and the latencies to onset and offset for the M. stemohyoideus profundus (SP), M. stemohyoideus superficialis (SS), Mm. mandibulohyoideus (MH) and M. levator scapulae (LS) were all significantly correlated with biotremor durations and biotremor onset and offset, respectively. Linear mixed-effect regression model comparisons of biotremor duration indicated that models containing either the MH and/or the SP and LS account for the most variation in biotremor duration. Twitch times for the SP (100 ms) and the SS (132 ms) at field active body temperature. however, were individually too slow to produce the biotremors at the observed frequency without alteration after production by other anatomical structures. These results implicate the SP, SS, MH and LS in the production of biotremors, but the exact mechanism of production requires further study.",2020,10.1242/jeb.227603,223,22,NA,jeb227603,Biotremor; Chameleons; Communication; Vibration; Muscle physiology; Biotremology
article,Synaptic convergence of afferent inputs in primary infrared-sensitive nucleus (LTTD) neurons of rattlesnakes (Crotalinae as the origin for sensory contrast enhancement,"Bothe, Maximilian S. and Luksch, Harald and Straka, Hans and Kohl, Tobias",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Pitvipers have a specialized sensory system in the upper jaw to detect infrared (IR) radiation. The bilateral pit organs resemble simple pinhole cameras that map IR objects onto the sensory epithelium as blurred representations of the environment. Trigeminal afferents transmit information about changing temperature patterns as neuronal spike discharge in a topographic manner to the hindbrain nucleus of the lateral descending trigeminal tract (LTTD). A presumed, yet so far unknown neuronal connectivity within this central nucleus exerts a synaptic computation that constrains the relatively large receptive field of primary afferent fibers. Here, we used intracellular recordings of LTTD neurons in isolated rattlesnake brains to decipher the spatio-temporal pattern of excitatory and inhibitory responses following electrical stimulation of single and multiple peripheral pit organ-innervating nerve branches. The responses of individual neurons consisted of complex spike sequences that derived from spatially and temporally specific interactions between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs from the same as well as from adjacent peripheral nerve terminal areas. This pattern complies with a central excitation that is flanked by a delayed lateral inhibition, thereby enhancing the contrast of IR sensory input, functionally reminiscent of the computations for contrast enhancement in the peripheral visual system.",2018,10.1242/jeb.185611,221,17,NA,jeb185611,Pit organ; EPSP; IPSP; Organotopic organization; Contrast enhancement

Repeated collapse and re-expansion exposes the lungs to multiple stressors, including ischemia-reperfusion, alveolar shear stress and inflammation. There is no evidence, however, that diving damages pulmonary function in these species. To investigate potential protective strategies in deep-diving seals, we examined the inflammatory response of seal whole blood exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). a potent endotoxin. Interleukin-6 (IL6) cytokine production elicited by LPS exposure was 50 to 500 times lower in blood of healthy northern elephant seals and Weddell seals compared with that of healthy human blood. In contrast to the similar to 6x increased production of IL6 protein from LPS-exposed Weddell seal whole blood, isolated Weddell seal peripheral blood mononuclear cells, under standard cell culture conditions using medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS), produced a robust LPS response (similar to 300x). Induction of 116 mRNA expression as well as production of IL6, IL8, IL10. KC-like and TNFa were reduced by substituting FBS with an equivalent amount of autologous seal serum. Weddell seal serum also attenuated the inflammatory response of RAW 267.4 mouse macrophage cells exposed to LPS. Cortisol level and the addition of serum lipids did not impact the cytokine response in cultured cells. These data suggest that seal serum possesses anti-inflammatory properties, which may protect deep divers from naturally occurring inflammatory challenges such as dive-induced hypoxia-reoxygenation and lung collapse.",2018,10.1242/jeb.178491,221,13,NA,178491,Innate immunity; Cytokine; IL6; Endotoxin; Pinniped
article,Fasting enhances mitochondrial efficiency in duckling skeletal muscle by acting on the substrate oxidation system,"Roussel, Damien and Boel, Melanie and Romestaing, Caroline",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"During food deprivation, animals must develop physiological responses to maximize energy conservation and survival. At the subcellular level, energy conservation is mainly achieved by a reduction in mitochondrial activity and an upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation efficiency. The aim of this study was to decipher mechanisms underlying the increased mitochondrial coupling efficiency reported in fasted birds. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation activity, efficiency and membrane potential were measured in mitochondria isolated from the gastrocnemius muscle of ducklings. The content and activities of respiratory chain complexes were also determined. Results from ducklings fasted for 6 days were compared with ducklings fed ad libitum. Here, we report that 6 days of fasting improved coupling efficiency in muscle mitochondria of ducklings by depressing proton-motive force through the downregulation of substrate oxidation reactions. Fasting did not change the basal proton conductance of mitochondria but largely decreased the oxidative phosphorylation activity, which was associated with decreased activities of succinate-cytochrome c reductase (complexes II-III) and citrate synthase, and altered contents in cytochromes b and c+ c1. In contrast, fasting did not change cytochrome aa3 content or the activity of complexes I, II and IV. Altogether, these data show that the lower capacity of the respiratory machinery to pump protons in ducklings fasted for 6 days generates a lower membrane potential, which triggers a decreased proton leak activity and thus a higher coupling efficiency. We propose that the main site of action would be located at the level of co-enzyme Q pool/complex III of the electron transport chain.",2018,10.1242/jeb.172213,221,4,NA,jeb172213,Bioenergetics; Proton conductance; Membrane potential; Oxidative phosphorylation; Electron transport chain; Birds

For such an endeavour, the Drosophila larva is simple enough to be tractable, yet complex enough to be interesting. It features about 10,000 neurons and is capable of various taxes, kineses and Pavlovian conditioning. All its neurons are currently being mapped into a light-microscopical atlas, and Gal4 strains are being generated to experimentally access neurons one at a time. In addition, an electron microscopic reconstruction of its nervous system seems within reach. Notably, this electron microscope-based connectome is being drafted for a stage 1 larva - because stage 1 larvae are much smaller than stage 3 larvae. However, most behaviour analyses have been performed for stage 3 larvae because their larger size makes them easier to handle and observe. It is therefore warranted to either redo the electron microscopic reconstruction for a stage 3 larva or to survey the behavioural faculties of stage 1 larvae. We provide the latter. In a community-based approach we called the Ol(1)mpiad, we probed stage 1 Drosophila larvae for free locomotion, feeding, responsiveness to substrate vibration, gentle and nociceptive touch, burrowing, olfactory preference and thermotaxis, light avoidance, gustatory choice of various tastants plus odour-taste associative learning, as well as light/dark-electric shock associative learning. Quantitatively, stage 1 larvae show lower scores inmost tasks, arguably because of their smaller size and lower speed. Qualitatively, however, stage 1 larvae perform strikingly similar to stage 3 larvae in almost all cases.

However, measuring the energy expenditure of animals in the field has proved difficult, especially for aquatic taxa. Accelerometry presents a means of translating metabolic rates measured in the laboratory to individuals studied in the field, pending appropriate laboratory calibrations. Such calibrations have only been performed on a few fish species to date, and only one where the effects of temperature were accounted for. Here, we present calibrations between activity, measured as overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA), and metabolic rate, measured through respirometry, for nurse sharks (Ginglymostoma cirratum), lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris) and blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus). Calibrations were made at a range of volitional swimming speeds and experimental temperatures. Linear mixed models were used to determine a predictive equation for metabolic rate based on measured ODBA values, with the optimal model using ODBA in combination with activity state and temperature to predict metabolic rate in lemon and nurse sharks, and ODBA and temperature to predict metabolic rate in blacktip sharks.

article,A long life in the fast lane: positive association between peak metabolic rate and lifespan in a butterfly,"Niitepold, Kristjan and Hanski, Ilkka",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"High peak metabolic rates may provide a performance advantage, but it may also entail a physiological cost. A long-held assumption is that high mass-specific energy expenditure is associated with short lifespan. To examine the relationship between energy expenditure and lifespan we asked two questions. First, do individuals have a consistent rate of metabolism throughout their life? Second, is metabolic rate correlated with lifespan? We analysed the repeatability of measurements of resting (RMR) and peak flight metabolic rate (MRpeak) throughout the life of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia). Measurements of MRpeak showed significant repeatability. Senescence occurred only shortly before death. RMR showed a U-shaped relationship with age and very low repeatability. Intraspecific association between metabolic rates and lifespan was tested under three conditions: in the laboratory, under field conditions and in a laboratory experiment with repeated flight treatments. There was a significant correlation between MRpeak and lifespan in all three experiments, but the correlation was positive, not negative. RMR was not correlated with lifespan. Both MRpeak and lifespan may reflect physiological condition and therefore be positively correlated. Individuals with a large resource pool may be able to invest in mechanisms that slow down ageing. Individuals with high metabolic capacity may also possess adaptations against ageing. Molecular polymorphism in the gene phosphoglucose isomerase (Pgi) was significantly associated with both MRpeak and lifespan, and may have coevolved with defence mechanisms against senescence. Generalisations such as `live fast, die young' may be too simple to explain the complex processes affecting ageing and lifespan.",2013,10.1242/jeb.080739,216,8,1388-1397,NA,ageing; flight; longevity; oxidative stress; phosphoglucose isomerase; Pgi; physiological condition; rate of living; senescence; trade-off
article,Modulation of prey capture kinematics in relation to prey distance helps predict success,"Oufiero, Christopher E. and Garikipati, Lohitashwa and McMillan, Elizabeth and Sullivan, Mary Katherine and Turnbaugh, Ryan",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Predators are not perfect, as some of their prey capture attempts result in failure. Successful attempts may be partly due to predators modulating their capture kinematics in relation to variation in the visual cues of the prey to increase the probability of success. In praying mantises, which have been suggested to possess stereoscopic vision, variation in prey distance has been shown to elicit variation in the probability of an attempt. However, it remains to be examined whether variation in prey distance results in mantises modulating their attempt to successfully capture prey. The goals of this study were to examine these relationships using the praying mantis system. Using 11 adult female Sphodromantis lineola, we recorded 192 prey capture attempts at 1000 Hz with two cameras to examine the 3D kinematics of successful and unsuccessful prey capture attempts. Using a combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and logistic regression, our results show that as prey distance increases, mantises adjust through greater and faster expansion of the forelegs and body (PC1), which significantly predicts capture success. However, PC1 only explains 22\% of the variation in all prey capture attempts, suggesting that the other components may be related to additional aspects of the prey. Our results suggest that the distances at which mantises prefer to attempt to capture prey may be the result of their greater probability of successfully capturing the prey. These results highlight the range of motions mantises use when attempting to capture prey, suggesting flexibility in their prey capture attempts in relation to prey position.",2024,10.1242/jeb.247311,227,11,NA,jeb247311,Predation success; Praying mantis; Behavior flexibility; Sphodromantis lineola

To perform such experiments, various artificial saline solutions have been developed, but their osmolality varies significantly from one to the next. Such a variation of osmolality stems, in part, from the difficulty of determining the true value of haemolymph osmolality in Drosophila larvae. Thus, there is a pressing need to refine protocols for collecting and measuring the osmolality of the larval haemolymph. Two major obstacles are thought to impede the accurate analysis of haemolymph collected from small insects: melanin formation and gut-derived contamination.

But despite the large body of work on performance traits, along with well-established protocols to measure them, performance can be challenging to measure. Endurance, for instance, is commonly measured by recording how long an animal can run at a set pace until exhaustion, which is time consuming and requires dedicated equipment. Consequently, exertion or distance capacity, measured as distance run until exhaustion when chased, is often used as a proxy for endurance, but the relationship between these two metrics has never been assessed even though they likely rely on different underlying physiological mechanisms. We tested experimentally for a relationship between endurance and exertion by training green anole lizards for sprinting and endurance and measuring whether exertion capacity responds to either type of training. Prior to training and across treatments, males displayed a mean (+/- s.d.) exertion capacity of 14.08 +/- 0.29 m and females 12.03 +/- 3.52 m; after training, this was 14.78 +/- 3.57 m and 12.19 +/- 2.21 m, respectively. We found that exertion capacity was unaffected by either type of training in green anoles. We also show that a positive relationship between endurance and exertion capacity pre-training exists only in females and that this relationship is inconsistent among studies.

article,Worker-like behavioral and physiological phenotype in queens with removed wings in a ponerine ant,"Pyenson, Benjamin and Albin-Brooks, Christopher and Burhyte, Corinne and Liebig, Jurgen",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Many highly eusocial insects are characterized by morphological differences between females, which are especially pronounced in ants. How these differences associate with particular behavioral and physiological phenotypes can illuminate early ant evolution. In ants, the morphological queen usually possesses a larger thorax with wings compared with a wingless worker. While queens specialize in reproduction, workers help with non-reproductive tasks and show various levels of reproductive degeneration. Here, we investigated the level of behavioral and physiological plasticity within queens in the ant species Harpegnathos saltator , which shows limited queen-worker dimorphism. We found that the experimental removal of wings led to the expression of worker behaviors and physiology, by examining young queens with wings, known as alate gynes, and those whose wings have been experimentally removed or naturally shed, known as dealate gynes. Compared with alate gynes, dealate gynes displayed higher frequencies of behaviors that are naturally shown by workers during reproductive competition. In addition, dealate gynes exhibited a worker-like range of ovarian activity. Like workers, they lacked the putative sex pheromones on their cuticle characteristic of dispersing gynes. Because gynes activate a worker-like phenotype after wing removal, the essential difference between the queen and worker in this species is a dispersal polyphenism. If the queen plasticity observed in H. saltator reflects the early stages of ant eusociality, a dispersal dimorphism rather than a distinct reproductive dimorphism might represent an early step in ant evolution.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243684,225,18,NA,jeb243684,Behavioral plasticity; Dealation; Queen-worker dimorphism; Dispersal polyphenism; Sex pheromones; Ovarian activity

In neonatal rodents, a single brainstem slice can be obtained to record respiratory-related motor nerve discharge along with individual rhythm-generating cells or motoneurons because of the close proximity of these neurons in the brainstem. However, most ex vivo preparations in other vertebrates can only capture respiratory motor outflow or electrophysiological properties of putative respiratory neurons in slices without relevant synaptic inputs. Here, we detail a method to horizontally slice away the dorsal portion of the brainstem to expose fluorescently labeled motoneurons for patch-clamp recordings in American bullfrogs. This `semi-intact' preparation allows tandem recordings of motor output and single motoneurons during respiratory-related synaptic inputs.

H. and Matthews, Benjamin J. and Marshall, Katie E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Ice-binding proteins (IBPs) have evolved independently in multiple taxonomic groups to improve their survival at sub-zero temperatures. Intertidal invertebrates in temperate and polar regions frequently encounter sub-zero temperatures, yet there is little information on IBPs in these organisms. We hypothesized that there are far more IBPs than are currently known and that the occurrence of freezing in the intertidal zone selects for these proteins. We compiled a list of genome-sequenced invertebrates across multiple habitats and a list of known IBP sequences and used BLAST to identify a wide array of putative IBPs in those invertebrates. We found that the probability of an invertebrate species having an IBP was significantly greater in intertidal species than in those primarily found in open ocean or freshwater habitats. These intertidal IBPs had high sequence similarity to fish and tick antifreeze glycoproteins and fish type II antifreeze proteins. Previously established classifiers based on machine learning techniques further predicted ice-binding activity in the majority of our newly identified putative IBPs. We investigated the potential evolutionary origin of one putative IBP from the hard-shelled mussel Mytilus coruscus and suggest that it arose through gene duplication and neofunctionalization. We show that IBPs likely readily evolve in response to freezing risk and that there is an array of uncharacterized IBPs, and highlight the need for broader laboratory-based surveys of the diversity of ice-binding activity across diverse taxonomic and ecological groups.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243409,225,"1, SI",NA,jeb243409,Antifreeze proteins; Freezing risk; Low-temperature tolerance; Environmental selection; BLAST
article,Insect cuticular hydrocarbon composition influences their interaction with spider capture threads,"Joel, Anna-Christin and Schmitt, Dorothea and Baumgart, Lucas and Menzel, Florian",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Insects represent the main prey of spiders, and spiders and insects co-diversified in evolutionary history. One of the main features characterizing spiders is their web as a trap to capture prey. Phylogenetically, the cribellate thread is one of the earliest thread types that was specialized to capture prey. In contrast to other capture threads, it lacks adhesive glue and consists of nanofibres, which do not only adhere to insects via van der Waals forces but also interact with the insects' cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) layer, thus enhancing adhesion. The CHC layer consists of multiple hydrocarbon types and is highly diverse between species. In this study, we show that CHC interaction with cribellate capture threads is affected by CHC composition of the insect. We studied the interaction in detail for four insect species with different CHC profiles and observed a differential migration of CHCs into the thread. The migration depends on the molecular structure of the hydrocarbon types as well as their viscosity, influenced by the ambient temperature during the interaction. As a consequence, adhesion forces to CHC layers differ depending on their chemical composition. Our results match predictions based on biophysical properties of hydrocarbons, and show that cribellate spiders can exert selection pressure on the CHC composition of their insect prey.",2022,10.1242/jeb.242514,225,5,NA,jeb242514,Adhesion; Cribellate capture thread; Cuticular hydrocarbons; Evolutionary arms race; Predator-prey interactions; Selection pressure; Spider silk; Viscosity
article,Dental microwear texture gradients in guinea pigs reveal that material properties of the diet affect chewing behaviour,"Winkler, Daniela E. and Clauss, Marcus and Rolle, Maximilian and Schulz-Kornas, Ellen and Codron, Daryl and Kaiser, Thomas M. and Tuetken, Thomas",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Dental microwear texture analysis (DMTA) is widely used for diet inferences in extant and extinct vertebrates. Often, a reference tooth position is analysed in extant specimens, while isolated teeth are lumped together in fossil datasets. It is therefore important to test whether dentalmicrowear texture (DMT) is tooth position specific and, if so, what causes the differences in wear. Here, we present results from controlled feeding experiments with 72 guinea pigs, which received either fresh or dried natural plant diets of different phytolith content (lucerne, grass, bamboo) or pelleted diets with and without mineral abrasives (frequently encountered by herbivorous mammals in natural habitats). We tested for gradients in dentalmicrowear texture along the upper cheek tooth row. Regardless of abrasive content, guinea pigs on pelleted diets displayed an increase in surface roughness along the tooth row, indicating that posterior tooth positions experience more wear compared with anterior teeth. Guinea pigs feedings on plants of low phytolith content and low abrasiveness (fresh and dry lucerne, fresh grass) showed almost no DMT differences between tooth positions, while individuals feeding on more abrasive plants (dry grass, fresh and dry bamboo) showed a gradient of decreasing surface roughness along the tooth row. We suggest that plant feeding involves continuous intake and comminution by grinding, resulting in posterior tooth positions mainly processing food already partly comminuted and moistened. Pelleted diets require crushing, which exerts higher loads, especially on posterior tooth positions, where bite forces are highest. These differences in chewing behaviour result in opposing wear gradients for plant versus pelleted diets.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242446,224,13,NA,jeb242446,Mastication; Bite force; Tooth wear; Abrasion

However, elasmobranchs are often underrepresented in such studies. Here, we measured the escape latency (time interval between the stimulus and first visible reaction) of mechanically induced escape responses in the Pacific spiny dogfish, Squalus suckleyi, and in two teleosts from the same region, the great sculpin, Myoxocephatus palyacanthocephalus, and the pile perch, Rhacochilus vacca. We found that the dogfish had a longer minimum latency (66.7 ms) compared with that for the great sculpin (20.8 ms) and pile perch (16.7 ms). Furthermore, the dogfish had a longer latency than that of 48 different teleosts identified from 35 different studies. We suggest such long latencies in dogfish may be due to the absence of Mauthner cells, the giant neurons that control fast escape responses in fishes.",2021,10.1242/jeb.230698,224,3,NA,jeb230698,Predator avoidance; Survival; Elasmobranch; Reaction time; Escape kinematics; Mauthner cells

To clarify this issue, we studied REDD1, FOXO4, PGC-1 alpha, FOXO1 and atrogin-1 proteins to determine the potential cause of the different antioxidant strategies in Daurian ground squirrels during hibernation, and to clarify whether different strategies affect atrophy-related signals. Results showed that the soleus (SOL) muscle experienced intracellular hypoxia during interbout arousal. but no oxidative stress. This may be due to increased PGC-1 alpha expression enhancing antioxidant capacity in the SOL under hypoxic conditions. Extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle showed no change in oxidative stress, hypoxia or antioxidant capacity during hibernation. The FOXO1 and PGC-1 alpha results strongly suggested differentially regulated fuel metabolism in the SOL and EDL muscles during hibernation, i.e. enhanced lipid oxidation and maintained anaerobic glycolysis, respectively. Atrogin-1 expression did not increase during hibernation in either the SOL or EDL, indicating that protein synthesis was not inhibited by atrogin-1. Thus, our results suggest that different fuel regulation may be one mechanism related to antioxidant defense strategy formation in different kinds of skeletal muscle fibers of Daurian ground squirrels during hibemation.",2021,10.1242/jeb.231639,224,2,NA,jeb231639,Hibernation; Skeletal muscle; Fuel regulation; Antioxidant defense strategy; Ground squirrels

This is highly relevant in sacoglossan sea slugs that host functional chloroplasts `stolen' from their algal foods (kleptoplasts), because of limited repair capacities resulting from the absence of algal nuclear genes. Here, we experimentally demonstrate (i) a hostmediated photoprotection mechanism in the photosynthetic sea slug Elysia timida, characterized by the closure of the parapodia under high irradiance and the reduction of kleptoplast light exposure; and (ii) the activation of a reversible xanthophyll cycle in kleptoplasts, which allows excessive energy to be dissipated. The described mechanisms reduce photoinactivation under high irradiance. We conclude that both host-mediated behavioural and plastid-based physiological photoprotective mechanisms can mitigate oxidative stress induced by high light in E. timida. These mechanisms may play an important role in the establishment of long-term photosynthetically active kleptoplasts.",2019,10.1242/jeb.202580,222,12,NA,jeb202580,Kleptoplasty; Light stress; Photobehaviour; Photoprotection; Photoinactivation; Violaxanthin cycle

Although increasing amounts of data suggest that non-genetic variability may be inherited, we have limited empirical data in animals. Here, we performed an artificial selection experiment using Drosophila melanogaster inbred lines. We quantified the response to selection for a decrease in chill coma recovery time and an increase in starvation resistance. We observed a weak response to selection in the inbred and outbred lines, with variability across lines. At the end of the selection process, differential expression was detected for some genes associated with epigenetics, the piRNA pathway and canalization functions. As the selection process can disturb the canalization process and increase the phenotypic variance of developmental traits, we also investigated possible effects of the selection process on the number of scutellar bristles, fluctuating asymmetry levels and fitness estimates. These results suggest that, contrary to what was shown in plants, selection of non-genetic variability is not straightforward in Drosophila and appears to be strongly genotype dependent.",2018,10.1242/jeb.186254,221,23,NA,jeb186254,Environmental effects; Selection; Stress; Phenotypic variation; Inheritance

Here, we used rotational stereo-videography to record the free-flight trajectories of foraging common swifts. We found that, despite their exquisite manoeuvring capabilities, the swifts only rarely performed high-acceleration turns. More surprisingly, we also found that despite feeding on tiny insects probably moving with ambient flow, the birds adjust their air speed to optimize cost of transport over distance. Finally, swifts spent only 25\% of their time flapping; the majority of their time (71\%) was spent in extended wing gliding, during which the average power expended for changes in speed or elevation was 0.84 W kg(-1) and not significantly different from 0. Thus, gliding swifts extracted sufficient environmental energy to pay the cost of flight during foraging.",2018,10.1242/jeb.186270,221,22,NA,jeb186270,Glide polar; Kinematics; Rotational stereo videography; Soaring; Thermal; Wind
article,How the simple shape and soft body of the larvae might explain the success of endopterygote insects,"Maddrell, S. H. P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The body forms of the larvae of most endopterygote insects are remarkably similar. I argue that their typical worm-like shape cuts costs; in particular, this allows the larvae to benefit from cheaper moulting and from less costly provision of fuel and oxygen to their respiring tissues. Furthermore, the shape confers a reduction of larval mortality in moulting. Together, these factors allow endopterygote larvae to grow fast and as this speedy growth reduces the dangers of predation, attack by parasitoids and disease before the larvae can reach adulthood, they increase offspring survival. I argue that this goes a long way to explain the very pronounced success of endopterygote insects.",2018,10.1242/jeb.177535,221,11,NA,jeb177535,Body form; Cost; Endopterygote; Survival

We experimentally enlarged or reduced litter size in mice during their first lactation, and then followed them through a successive unmanipulated lactation. Measurements of food intake, body mass, milk energy output (MEO), litter size and litter mass were taken. Offspring from the first lactation were also bred to investigate their reproductive success. In their first lactation, mothers with enlarged litters (n=9, 16 pups) weaned significantly smaller pups, culled more pups, and increased MEO and food intake compared with mothers with reduced litters (n=9, 5 pups). In the second lactation, no significant differences in pup mass or litter size were observed between groups, but mothers that had previously reared enlarged litters significantly decreased pup mass, MEO and food intake compared with those that had reared reduced litters. Female offspring from enlarged litters weaned slightly smaller pups than those from reduced litters, but displayed no significant differences in any of the other variables measured. These results suggest that females with enlarged litters suffered from a greater energetic burden during their first lactation, and this was associated with lowered performance in a successive reproductive event and impacted on their offspring's reproductive performance. Female `choice' about how much to invest in the first lactation may thus be driven by trade-offs with future reproductive success. Hence, the `limit' on performance may not be a hard physiological limit.

We investigated anterior vena caval P-O2 and S-O2 during dives of an adult female sea lion to investigate two hypotheses: (1) posterior vena caval S-O2 is not representative of the entire venous oxygen store and (2) a well-oxygenated (arterialized) central venous oxygen reservoir might account for maintenance of arterial S-O2 during lung collapse. During deep dives, initial anterior vena caval S-O2 was elevated at 83.6 +/- 8.4\% (n = 102), presumably owing to arteriovenous shunting. It remained high until the bottom phase of the dive and then decreased during ascent, whereas previously determined posterior vena caval S-O2 declined during descent and then often increased during ascent. These divergent patterns confirmed that posterior vena caval S-O2 was not representative of the entire venous oxygen store. Prior to and early during descent of deep dives, the high S-O2 values of both the anterior and posterior venae cavae may enhance arterialization of a central venous oxygen store. However, anterior vena caval S-O2 values at depths beyond lung collapse reached levels as low as 40\%, making it unlikely that even a completely arterialized central venous oxygen store could account for maintenance of high arterial S-O2. These findings suggest that maintenance of high arterial S-O2 during deep dives is due to persistence of some gas exchange at depths beyond presumed lung collapse.",2018,10.1242/jeb.163428,221,1,NA,jeb174235,Blood oxygen; Dive; Hemoglobin saturation; Otariid; Vena cava

We recently established a link between heritable variation in post-stress cortisol production and cardiac growth in salmonid fish too. A conserved stimulatory effect of the otherwise catabolic steroid hormone cortisol is probably implied, but has to date not been established experimentally. Furthermore, whereas cardiac growth is associated with failure of the mammalian heart, pathological cardiac hypertrophy has not previously been described in fish. Here, we show that rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) treated with cortisol in the diet for 45 days have enlarged hearts with lower maximum stroke volume and cardiac output. In accordance with impaired cardiac performance, overall circulatory oxygen-transporting capacity was diminished as indicated by reduced aerobic swimming performance. In contrast to the well-known adaptive/physiological heart growth observed in fish, cortisol-induced growth is maladaptive. Furthermore, the observed heart growth was associated with up-regulated signature genes of mammalian cardiac pathology, suggesting that signalling pathways mediating cortisol-induced cardiac remodelling in fish are conserved from fish to mammals. Altogether, we show that excessive cortisol can induce pathological cardiac remodelling. This is the first study to report and integrate the etiology, physiology and molecular biology of cortisol-induced pathological remodelling in fish.",2017,10.1242/jeb.135046,220,14,2545-2553,NA,Myocardial hypertrophy; Chronic stress; Heart failure; Rainbow trout; Cardiac performance
article,Acoustic measurements of post-dive cardiac responses in southern elephant seals (<i>Mirounga leonina</i>) during surfacing at sea,"Day, Louise and Jouma'a, Joffrey and Bonnel, Julien and Guinet, Christophe",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Measuring physiological data in free-ranging marine mammals remains challenging, owing to their far-ranging foraging habitat. Yet, it is important to understand how these divers recover from effort expended underwater, as marine mammals can perform deep and recurrent dives. Among them, southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) are one of the most extreme divers, diving continuously at great depth and for long duration while travelling over large distances within the Southern Ocean. To determine how they manage post-dive recovery, we deployed hydrophones on four post-breeding female southern elephant seals. Cardiac data were extracted from sound recordings when the animal was at the surface, breathing. Mean heart rate at the surface was 102.4 +/- 4.9 beats min(-1) and seals spent on average 121 +/- 20 s breathing. During these surface intervals, the instantaneous heart rate increased with time. Elephant seals are assumed to drastically slow their heart rate (bradycardia) while they are deep underwater, and increase it (tachycardia) during the ascent towards the surface. Our finding suggests that tachycardia continues while the animal stays breathing at the surface. Also, the measured mean heart rate at the surface was unrelated to the duration and swimming effort of the dive prior to the surface interval. Recovery (at the surface) after physical effort (underwater) appears to be related to the overall number of heart beats performed at the surface, and therefore total surface duration. Southern elephant seals recover from dives by adjusting the time spent at the surface rather than their heart rate.",2017,10.1242/jeb.146928,220,9,1626-1633,NA,Marine mammal; Heart rate; Dive recovery; Diving behaviour; Passive acoustic

Digestive physiology limits the energy intake of several glossophaginid bats, and could play an important role in the onset of torpor in these tropical animals. We measured the effect that diet quality and T-a had on the use of torpor by the nectar-feeding bats Glossophaga soricina and Leptonycteris yerbabuenae. Captive bats were fed with 5\% (low) or 35\% ( high) sucrose solutions while exposed to two different T-a (17.7 and 23.2 degrees C; low T-a and high T-a) in four different treatments: (1) high sucrose: high T-a, (2) high sucrose: low T-a, (3) low sucrose: high T-a and (4) low sucrose: low T-a. We measured their energy intake, changes in body mass (Delta M-b) and skin temperature (T-skin) as response variables. Energy intake (in 10 h) was limited when both species fed on 5\% sucrose, but body mass gain was only affected in G. soricina. Energy intake and T-a had a negative effect on the minimum T-skin of both species, and Delta M-b affected the time that G. soricina used torpor. Both species remained normothermic on the high sucrose: high T-a treatment, but used torpor on the other three treatments. Bats used torpor during their resting and activity periods. Leptonycteris yerbabuenae spent more time in torpor in the low sucrose: high T-a treatment, while G. soricina used this strategy for longer periods of time in the high sucrose: low T-a treatment.

article,Patterns of variation in feeding strike kinematics of juvenile ghost praying mantis (<i>Phyllocrania paradoxa</i>): are components of the strike stereotypic?,"Oufiero, Christopher E. and Nguyen, Tammy and Sragner, Annie and Ellis, Angelah",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Functional systems, such as feeding mechanics, often involve the evolution of several components of the musculoskeletal system that are moved in coordination to capture prey. Because these systems often involve the quick movement of several structures, some feeding systems have been hypothesized to be stereotypic. While the motor activity patterns are often stereotyped, the subsequent kinematics can be variable, many times in response to variation in prey stimulus (e.g. prey position). Patterns of feeding kinematics have been well studied among vertebrates, with less attention on invertebrate systems. The goal of this study was to examine the amount of stereotypy in the feeding strike kinematics of praying mantises. We filmed eight juvenile ghost praying mantises (Phyllocrania paradoxa) at 1000 Hz across several days within instar 7. We digitized several points that represent the movement of the coxa, trochanter-femur and tibia of the raptorial foreleg to obtain a set of kinematics including angles and angular velocities of the joint, as well as body lunge. Using the coefficient of variation, we found less stereotypy in the approach stage of the strike compared with the sweep. Using Bonferroni-corrected Pearson's correlations of kinematics with prey position, we found few traits related to prey position with the exception of some kinematics of the coxa joint and the amount of lunge used during the strike. Our results suggest that several components of the praying mantis strike are stereotypic, while others exhibit flexibility to ensure successful capture of the prey.",2016,10.1242/jeb.139675,219,17,2733-2742,NA,Mantodea; Prey capture; Stereotypy; Feeding mechanics; Coefficient of variation; Motor patterns

In addition, complex behaviors such as sun-compass orientation and time learning are clearly regulated by the circadian system in these organisms. Despite these unique features of social insect clocks, the mechanisms as well as the functional and evolutionary relevance of these traits remain largely unknown. Here we show a modification of the Drosophila activity monitoring (DAM) system that allowed us to measure locomotor rhythms of the honey bee, Apis mellifera (three variants; gAHB, carnica and caucasica), and two paper wasps (Polistes crinitus and Mischocyttarus phthisicus). A side-by-side comparison of the endogenous period under constant darkness (free-running period) led us to the realization that these social insects exhibit significant deviations from the Earth's 24 h rotational period as well as a large degree of inter-individual variation compared with Drosophila. Experiments at different temperatures, using honey bees as a model, revealed that testing the endogenous rhythm at 35 degrees C, which is the hive's core temperature, results in average periods closer to 24 h compared with 25 degrees C (23.8 h at 35 degrees C versus 22.7 h at 25 degrees C). This finding suggests that the degree of tuning of circadian temperature compensation varies among different organisms.

Many fish plastically darken their body colouration in response to dark visual backgrounds, and this functions to reduce predation risk. Here, we tested the hypotheses that colour change in fish (1) carries with it an energetic cost and (2) affects subsequent shoal and habitat choice decisions. We demonstrate that guppies (Poecilia reticulata) change colour in response to dark and light visual backgrounds, and that doing so carries an energetic cost in terms of food consumption. By increasing food intake, however, guppies are able to maintain growth rates and meet the energetic costs of changing colour. Following colour change, fish preferentially choose habitats and shoals that match their own body colouration, and maximise crypsis, thus avoiding the need for further colour change but also potentially paying an opportunity cost associated with restriction to particular habitats and social associates. Thus, colour change to match the background is complemented by behavioural strategies, which should act to maximise fitness in variable environments.",2013,10.1242/jeb.080879,216,14,2760-2767,NA,physiological colour change; morphological colour change; phenotypic plasticity; camouflage; background matching

A large brood size is known to affect chick growth, leading in some cases to long-lasting effects for the offspring, such as a decrease in size at fledgling and in survival after fledging. An important pathway underlying different growth patterns could be the variation in offspring mitochondrial metabolism through its central role in converting energy. Here, we performed a brood size manipulation in great tits (Parus major) to unravel its impact on offspring mitochondrial metabolism and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in red blood cells. We investigated the effects of brood size on chick growth and survival, and tested for long-lasting effects on juvenile mitochondrial metabolism and phenotype. As expected, chicks raised in reduced broods had a higher body mass compared with enlarged and control groups. However, mitochondrial metabolism and ROS production were not significantly affected by the treatment at either chick or juvenile stages. Interestingly, chicks raised in very small broods were smaller in size and had higher mitochondrial metabolic rates. The nest of rearing had a significant effect on nestling mitochondrial metabolism. The contribution of the rearing environment in determining offspring mitochondrial metabolism emphasizes the plasticity of mitochondrial metabolism in relation to the nest environment.

However, these associations were based on biomarkers that fail to provide a retrospective view of stress. This study is the first whereby the association of long-term stress, using scale cortisol as a chronic stress biomarker, with cardiac morphology and growth performance of wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is made. Growth, heart morphology, plasma and scale cortisol levels, and expression of genes involved in cortisol regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary- interrenal axis of undisturbed fish (control) were compared with those of fish exposed daily to stress for 8 weeks. Though scale cortisol levels showed a time-dependent accumulation in both groups, plasma and scale cortisol levels of stress group fish were 29.1\% and 25.0\% lower than those of control fish, respectively. These results correlated with the overall upregulation of stress-axis genes involved in the systemic negative feedback of cortisol, and local feedback via 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases, glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors in the stress treatment at the hypothalamus and pituitary level. These lower cortisol levels were, however, counterintuitive in terms of the growth performance as stress group fish grew 33.7\% slower than control fish, which probably influenced the 8.4\% increase in relative ventricle mass in the stress group. Though compact myocardium area between the treatments was comparable, these parameters showed significant linear correlations with scale cortisol levels, indicating the involvement of chronic stress in cardiac remodeling. These findings underscore the importance of scale cortisol as biomarker when associating chronic stress with long-term processes including cardiac remodeling.",2023,10.1242/jeb.246504,226,22,NA,jeb246504,Chronic stress; Heart morphology; HPI axis; Scales; Salmonids

This suggests that molecular changes in one or more clock genes could contribute to the inability to diapause in a second form of this mosquito, Culex pipiens f. molestus. Temperate populations of Cx. pipiens f. molestus inhabit underground locations generally devoid of predictable photoperiods. For this reason, there could be limited fitness consequences if the hypothesized molecular changes to its clock genes also eliminated this mosquito's ability to regulate circadian rhythms in response to photoperiod variation. Here, we demonstrate that in contrast to this prediction, underground derived Cx. pipiens f. molestus retain exogenously influenceable circadian rhythms. Nonetheless, our genetic analyses indicate that the gene Helicase domino (dom) has a nine-nucleotide, in-frame deletion specific to Cx. pipiens f. molestus. Previous work has shown that splice variants in this gene differentially influence circadian behavior in Drosophila melanogaster. We also find derived, non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in eight genes thatmay also affect circadian rhythms and/or diapause induction in Cx. pipiens f. molestus. Finally, four putative circadian genes were found to have no quantifiable expression during any examined life stage, suggesting potential regulatory effects. Collectively, our findings indicate that the distinct, but molecularly interconnected life-history traits of diapause induction and circadian rhythms are decoupled in Cx. pipiens f. molestus and suggest this taxon may be a valuable tool for exploring exogenously influenced phenotypes in mosquitoes more broadly.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242231,224,10,NA,jeb242231,Clock genes; Life-history traits; Diapause; Culicidae; Helicase domino; Photoperiod

Jumping spiders (Salticidae) do this by coordinating eyes with different capabilities. Objects are examined by a pair of high-acuity principal eyes, whose narrow field of view is compensated for by retinal movements. The principal eyes overlap in field of view with motion-sensitive anterior-lateral eyes (ALEs), which direct their gaze to new stimuli. Using a salticid-specific eyetracker, we monitored the gaze direction of the principal eyes as they examined a primary stimulus. We then presented a distractor stimulus visible only to the ALEs and observed whether the principal eyes reflexively shifted their gaze to it or whether this response was flexible. Whether spiders redirected their gaze to the distractor depended on properties of both the primary and distractor stimuli. This flexibility suggests that higher-order processing occurs in the management of the attention of the principal eyes.",2021,10.1242/jeb.231035,224,8,NA,jeb231035,Salticidae; Gaze direction; Principal eyes; Vision; Eye tracking

The southern elephant seal (SES) is a major consumer of mesopelagic organisms, in particular the abundant myctophid fish, yet the fine-scale relationship between this predator's foraging behaviour and bioluminescent prey remains poorly understood. We hypothesised that brief, intense light emissions should be closely connected with prey strikes when the seal is targeting bioluminescent prey that reacts by emitting anti-predator flashes. To test this, we developed a biologging device containing a fast-sampling light sensor together with location and movement sensors to measure simultaneously anti-predator bioluminescent emissions and the predator's attack motions with a 20 ms resolution. Tagswere deployed on femaleSESbreeding at Kerguelen Islands and Penin sula Vald ` s, Argentina. In situ light levels in combination with duration of prey capture attempts indicated that seals were targeting a variety of prey types. For some individuals, bioluminescent flashes occurred in a large proportion of prey strikes, with the timing of flashes closely connected with the predator's attack motion, suggestive of antipredator emissions. Marked differences across individuals and location indicate that SES do exploit bioluminescent organisms but the proportion of these in the diet varies widely with location. The combination of wideband light and acceleration data provides new insight into where and when different prey types are encountered and how effectively they might be captured.",2020,10.1242/jeb.222810,223,10,NA,jeb222810,Anti-predator tactic; Bioluminescence; Biologging; Mirounga leonina; Foraging ecology; Predator-prey interactions
article,Measurement of mitochondrial respiration in permeabilized fish gills,"Dawson, Neal J. and Millet, Caroline and Selman, Colin and Metcalfe, Neil B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Physiological investigations of fish gills have traditionally centred on the two principal functions of the gills: gas exchange and ion regulation. Mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs) are primarily found within the gill filaments of fish, and are thought to proliferate in order to increase the ionoregulatory capacity of the gill in response to environmentally induced osmotic challenges. However, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the metabolic function of mitochondria within fish gills. Here, we describe and validate a simple protocol for the permeabilization of fish gills and subsequent measurement of mitochondrial respiration rates in vitro. Our protocol requires only small tissue samples (8 mg), exploits the natural structure of fish gills, does not require mechanical separation of the gill tissue (so is relatively quick to perform), and yields accurate and highly reproducible measurements of respiration rates. It offers great potential for the study of mitochondrial function in gills over a wide range of fish sizes and species.",2020,10.1242/jeb.216762,223,4,NA,jeb216762,LEAK; Oxidative phosphorylation; Mitochondrion-rich cells; Oxygraph; Oxygen consumption; Electron transport chain
article,microRNA-29b knocks down collagen type I production in cultured rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) cardiac fibroblasts,"Johnston, Elizabeth F. and Cadonic, Ivan G. and Craig, Paul M. and Gillis, Todd E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Warm acclimation of rainbow trout can cause a decrease in the collagen content of the heart. This ability to remove cardiac collagen is particularly interesting considering that collagen deposition in the mammalian heart, following an injury, is permanent. We hypothesized that collagen removal can be facilitated by microRNA-29b (miR-29b), a highly conserved, small, non-coding RNA, as a reduction in this microRNA has been reported during the development of fibrosis in the mammalian heart. We also used a bioinformatics approach to investigate the binding potential of miR-29b to the seed sequences of vertebrate collagen isoforms. Cultured trout cardiac fibroblasts were transfected with zebrafish mature miR-29b mimic for 7 days with re-transfection occurring after 3 days. Transfection induced a 17.8-fold increase in miR-29b transcript abundance (P<0.05) as well as a 54\% decrease in the transcript levels of the col1a3 collagen isoform, compared with non-transfected controls (P<0.05). Western blotting demonstrated that the level of collagen type I protein was 85\% lower in cells transfected with miR-29b than in control cells (P<0.05). Finally, bioinformatic analysis suggested that the predicted 3'-UTR of rainbow trout col1a3 has a comparatively higher binding affinity for miR-29b than the 3'-UTR of col1a1. Together, these results suggest that miR-29b is a highly conserved regulator of collagen type I protein in vertebrates and that this microRNA decreases collagen in the trout heart by targeting col1a3.",2019,10.1242/jeb.202788,222,17,NA,jeb202788,Cardiac remodelling; Heart; Cultured fibroblasts; Extracellular matrix; MicroRNA; Transcriptional regulation
article,"Flight energetics, caste dimorphism and scaling properties in the bumblebee, <i>Bombus impatiens</i>","Billardon, Fannie and Darveau, Charles-A",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Animal size affects the energetics of locomotion. Using female caste dimorphism in bumblebees, we assessed how body mass impacts morphological and physiological traits linked with flight. The allometric relationships obtained for wing surface area, wingbeat frequency, and flight and resting metabolic rates of workers could predict the trait values of queens that were more than fourfold larger. Flight success of queens decreased over time in part because of a large increase in body mass and a decrease in traits linked with flight, namely wingbeat frequency and metabolic rate, and the activity of metabolic enzymes tended to decrease. After taking into account temporal changes, body mass, flight wingbeat frequency and metabolic rate were repeatable. Finally, we found significant family resemblance for all traits measured, indicating that shared genes and/or environmental effects impact phenotypic variation. Together, our results show that the functional association between body morphology and flight physiology is robust, providing further insights into the mechanistic basis of metabolic rate scaling patterns during locomotion in animals.",2019,10.1242/jeb.187807,222,1,NA,jeb187807,Metabolic rate; Flight; Wingbeat frequency; Muscle; Enzyme; Allometry
article,"Effects of flight activity and age on oxidative damage in the honey bee, <i>Apis mellifera</i>","Margotta, Joseph W. and Roberts, Stephen P. and Elekonich, Michelle M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Frequent and highly aerobic behaviors likely contribute to naturally occurring stress, accelerate senescence and limit lifespan. To understand how the physiological and cellular mechanisms that determine the onset and duration of senescence are shaped by behavioral development and behavioral duration, we exploited the tractability of the honey bee (Apis mellifera) model system. First, we determined whether a cause-effect relationship exists between honey bee flight and oxidative stress by comparing oxidative damage accrued from intense flight bouts to damage accrued from D-galactose ingestion, which induces oxidative stress and limits lifespan in other insects. Second, we experimentally manipulated the duration of honey bee flight across a range of ages to determine the effects on reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and associated enzymatic antioxidant protective mechanisms. In bees fed D-galactose, lipid peroxidation (assessed by measuring malondialdehyde levels) was higher than in bees fed sucrose and age-matched bees with a high and low number of flight experiences collected from a colony. Bees with high amounts of flight experience exhibited elevated 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, a marker of oxidative DNA damage, relative to bees with less flight experience. Bees with high amounts of flight experience also showed increased levels of pro-oxidants (superoxide and hydrogen peroxide) and decreased or unchanged levels of antioxidants (superoxide dismutase and catalase). These data implicate an imbalance of pro- to anti-oxidants in flight-associated oxidative stress, and reveal how behavior can damage a cell and consequently limit lifespan.",2018,10.1242/jeb.183228,221,14,NA,NA,Honey bee; Oxidative stress; Flight; Senescence; Lifespan

Lab experiments that test memory for the location of food show that animals have a similar capability to act in anticipation of future needs, but less work has been done on animals foraging in the wild. We hypothesized that planning abilities are critical and common in breath-hold divers who adjust each dive to forage on prey varying in quality, location and predictability within constraints of limited oxygen availability. We equipped Risso's dolphins with sound-and-motion recording tags to reveal where they focus their attention through their externally observable echolocation and how they fine tune search strategies in response to expected and observed prey distribution. The information from the dolphins was integrated with synoptic prey data obtained from echosounders on an underwater vehicle. At the start of the dives, whales adjusted their echolocation inspection ranges in ways that suggest planning to forage at a particular depth. Once entering a productive prey layer, dolphins reduced their search range comparable to the scale of patches within the layer, suggesting that they were using echolocation to select prey within the patch. On ascent, their search range increased, indicating that they decided to stop foraging within that layer and started searching for prey in shallower layers. Information about prey, learned throughout the dive, was used to plan foraging in the next dive. Our results demonstrate that planning for future dives is modulated by spatial memory derived from multi-modal prey sampling (echoic, visual and capture) during earlier dives.",2018,10.1242/jeb.165209,221,4,NA,jeb165209,Predator-prey dynamics; Perceptual range; Grampus griseus; Animal decision making; Episodic-like memory; Foraging behaviour
article,"Lean, mean, lipolytic machines: lipid mobilization in rainbow trout during graded swimming","Turenne, Eric D. and Weber, Jean-Michel",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The mobilization of mammalian lipid reserves is strongly stimulated during exercise to reach a maximum at moderate intensities, but the effects of swimming speed on fish lipolysis have never been quantified. Continuous infusion of 2-{[}H-3] glycerol was used to measure the rate of appearance of glycerol or lipolytic rate (R-a glycerol) in rainbow trout kept at rest, or during graded exercise in a swim tunnel up to critical swimming speed (U-crit). Results show that Ra glycerol is 1.67 +/- 0.18 mu mol kg-1 min(-1) in control animals, and remains at a steady level of 1.24 +/- 0.10 mu mol kg(-1) min(-1) in exercising fish at all swimming intensities. Baseline lipolytic rate provides more than enough fatty acids from lipid reserves to accommodate all the oxidative fuel requirements for swimming at up to 2 body lengths per second (BL s(-1)), and more than 50\% of the energy needed at Ucrit (3.4 +/- 0.1 BL s(-1)). Such `excess lipolysis' also means that trout sustain high rates of fatty acid reesterification. Maintaining steady lipolysis at rest and throughout graded swimming is strikingly different from mammals that stimulate Ra glycerol by twofold to fivefold to support exercise. Instead, trout act like `lipolytic machines' that do not modulate Ra glycerol even when their metabolic rate triples - a strategy that eliminates the need to increase lipolytic rate during exercise. This study also supports the notion that maintaining a high rate of reesterification (or triacylglycerol/fatty acid cycling) may be a mechanism widely used by ectotherms to achieve rapid membrane remodelling in variable environments.",2018,10.1242/jeb.171553,221,2,NA,jeb171553,Fish lipolysis; Exercise; Fuel metabolism; In vivo metabolite fluxes

However, even in a sophisticated genetic model system like Drosophila melanogaster, few genes have been identified as functioning in cold tolerance. The accumulation of the Frost (Fst) gene transcript increases after cold exposure, making it a good candidate for a gene that has a role in cold tolerance. Despite extensive RNAi knockdown analysis, no role in cold tolerance has been assigned to Fst. CRISPR is an effective technique for completely knocking down genes, and is less likely to produce offtarget effects than GAL4-UAS RNAi systems. We have used CRISPR-mediated homologous recombination to generate Fst-null alleles, and these Fst alleles uncovered a requirement for FST protein in maintaining female fecundity following cold exposure. However, FST does not have a direct role in survival following cold exposure. FST mRNA accumulates in the Malpighian tubules, and the FST protein is a highly disordered protein with a putative signal peptide for export from the cell. Future work is needed to determine whether FST is exported from the Malpighian tubules and directly interacts with female reproductive tissues post-cold exposure, or whether it is required for other repair/recovery functions that indirectly alter energy allocation to reproduction.",2017,10.1242/jeb.160176,220,18,3344-3354,NA,Genome editing; CRISPR-Cas9; Cold tolerance; Chill coma; Intrinsically disordered protein; Insect

Here, we tested two hypotheses: (1) the production of HSPs is necessary for enhanced LTM formation; and (2) blocking DNA methylation prevents the heat stressor-induced enhancement of LTM formation. We show here that the enhancing effect of the heat stressor on LTM formation occurs even if snails experienced the stressor 3 days previously.

It has been proposed that the capacity of the gut to digest and absorb food is not the limiting factor to sustained energy intake (SusEI) during peak lactation. In this study, plasticity in energy intake and gastrointestinal morphology was examined in striped hamsters at different stages of reproduction and when raising litters of different sizes. Mechanisms associated with digestive enzymes and neuroendocrine hormones underpinning the plasticity were also examined. Females significantly increased energy intake, digestibility, digestive tract mass and the activity of stomach pepsin and small intestine maltase, sucrase and aminopeptidase in peak lactation compared with the non-productive and post-lactating periods. Further, females raising large litters significantly increased energy intake, digestibility, gastrointestinal mass and activity of digestive enzymes, and weaned heavier offspring compared with those nursing small and medium litters, indicating that the significant plasticity of digestive physiology increased reproductive performance. Agouti-related protein (AgRP) mRNA expression in the hypothalamus was up-regulated significantly in females raising large litters relative to those raising small litters. Serum leptin levels, and mRNA expression of hypothalamus neuropeptide Y (NPY) and the anorexigenic neuropeptides proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and cocaine-and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) did not differ among females raising small, medium and large litters. Leptin levels in lactation may only reflect a state of energy balance rather than being the prime driver of hyperphagia. Some hypothalamic neuropeptides, such as NPY, POMC and CART, may be involved in the limits to the SusEI during lactation.",2016,10.1242/jeb.138396,219,9,1327-1336,NA,Digestive enzymes; Lactation; Leptin; Litter size; Neuropeptide; Phenotypic plasticity; Sustained energy intake
article,Sex- and melanism-specific variations in the oxidative status of adult tawny owls in response to manipulated reproductive effort,"Emaresi, Guillaume and Henry, Isabelle and Gonzalez, Esther and Roulin, Alexandre and Bize, Pierre",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Oxidative stress, determined by the balance between the production of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant defences, is hypothesized to play an important role in shaping the cost of reproduction and life history trade-offs. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated reproductive effort in 94 breeding pairs of tawny owls (Strix aluco) to investigate the sex-and melanism-specific effects on markers of oxidative stress in red blood cells (RBCs). This colour polymorphic bird species shows sex-specific division of labour and melanism-specific history strategies. Brood sizes at hatching were experimentally enlarged or reduced to increase or decrease reproductive effort, respectively. We obtained an integrative measure of the oxidative balance by measuring ROS production by RBCs, intracellular antioxidant glutathione levels and membrane resistance to ROS. We found that light melanic males (the sex undertaking offspring food provisioning) produced more ROS than darker conspecifics, but only when rearing an enlarged brood. In both sexes, light melanic individuals had also a larger pool of intracellular antioxidant glutathione than darker owls under relaxed reproductive conditions (i.e. reduced brood), but not when investing substantial effort in current reproduction (enlarged brood). Finally, resistance to oxidative stress was differently affected by the brood size manipulation experiment in males and females independently of their plumage coloration. Altogether, our results support the hypothesis that reproductive effort can alter the oxidative balance in a sex-and colour-specific way. This further emphasizes the close link between melanin-based coloration and life history strategies.",2016,10.1242/jeb.128959,219,1,73-79,NA,Brood size manipulation; Colour polymorphism; Glutathione; Life history traits; ROS production; Oxidative stress

Two thousand individually tagged juvenile European sea bass were submitted to two `fasting/feeding' cycles each comprising 3 weeks of food deprivation followed by 3 weeks of ad libitum feeding at 25 degrees C. Rates of mass loss during the two fasting periods were averaged for each individual to calculate a population mean. Extreme fasting tolerant (FT) and sensitive (FS) phenotypes were identified that were at least one and a half standard deviations, on opposing sides, from this mean. Respirometry was used to investigate two main hypotheses: (1) tolerance of food deprivation reflects lower mass-corrected routine metabolic rate (RMR) in FT phenotypes when fasting, and (2) tolerance reflects differences in substrate utilisation; FT phenotypes use relatively less proteins as metabolic fuels during fasting, measured as their ammonia quotient (AQ), the simultaneous ratio of ammonia excretion to RMR. There was no difference in mean RMR between FT and FS over 7 days fasting, being 6.70 +/- 0.24 mmol h(-1) fish(-1) (mean +/- s.e.m., N=18) versus 6.76 +/- 0.22 mmol h(-1) fish(-1) (N=17), respectively, when corrected to a body mass of 130 g. For any given RMR, however, the FT lost mass at a significantly lower rate than FS, overall 7-day average being 0.72 +/- 0.05 versus 0.90 +/- 0.05 g day(-1) fish(-1), respectively (P<0.01, t-test). At 20 h after receiving a ration equivalent to 2\% body mass as food pellets, ammonia excretion and simultaneous RMR were elevated and similar in FT and FS, with AQs of 0.105 +/- 0.009 and 0.089 +/- 0.007, respectively. At the end of the period of fasting, ammonia excretion and RMR had fallen in both phenotypes, but AQ was significantly lower in FT than FS, being 0.038 +/- 0.004 versus 0.061 +/- 0.005, respectively (P<0.001, t-test). There was a direct linear relationship between individual fasted AQ and rate of mass loss, with FT and FS individuals distributed at opposing lower and upper extremities, respectively. Thus the difference between the phenotypes in their tolerance of food deprivation did not depend upon their routine energy use when fasting. Rather, it depended upon their relative use of tissue proteins as metabolic fuels when fasting, which was significantly lower in FT phenotypes.",2014,10.1242/jeb.101857,217,18,3283-3292,NA,Ammonia excretion; Ammonia quotient; Energetic strategy; Respirometry; Routine metabolic rate; Specific dynamic action

We also recorded the behavior of wood frogs preparing to freeze in artificial hibernacula, and tissue glucose concentrations in captive wood frogs frozen in the laboratory to -2.5 degrees C. Wood frogs in natural hibernacula remained frozen for 193 +/- 11 consecutive days and experienced average (October-May) temperatures of -6.3 degrees C and average minimum temperatures of -14.6 +/- 2.8 degrees C (range -8.9 to -18.1 degrees C) with 100\% survival (N=18).

Antifreeze glycolipid was present in extracts from muscle and internal organs, but not skin, of frozen frogs. Wood frogs in Interior Alaska survive freezing to extreme limits and durations compared with those described in animals collected in southern Canada or the Midwestern United States.

article,Environmental response and adaptation of glycoprotein glue within the droplets of viscous prey capture threads from araneoid spider orb-webs,"Opell, Brent D. and Karinshak, Shannon E. and Sigler, Mary A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Viscous threads that form the prey capture spiral of araneoid orb-webs retain insects that strike the web, giving a spider more time to locate and subdue them. The viscoelastic glycoprotein glue responsible for this adhesion forms the core of regularly spaced aqueous droplets, which are supported by protein axial fibers. Glycoprotein extensibility both facilitates the recruitment of adhesion from multiple droplets and dissipates the energy generated by insects struggling to free themselves from the web. Compounds in the aqueous material make the droplets hygroscopic, causing an increase in both droplet volume and extensibility as humidity ( RH) rises. We characterized these humidity-mediated responses at 20\%, 37\%, 55\%, 72\% and 90\% RH in two large orbweavers, Argiope aurantia, which is found in exposed habitats, and Neoscona crucifera, which occupies forests and forest edges. The volume-specific extension of A. aurantia glycoprotein reached a maximum value at 55\% RH and then declined, whereas that of N. crucifera increased exponentially through the RH range. As RH increased, the relative stress on droplet filaments at maximum extension, as gauged by axial line deflection, decreased in a linear fashion in A. aurantia, but in N. crucifer increased logarithmically, indicating that N. crucifera threads are better equipped to dissipate energy through droplet elongation. The greater hygroscopicity of A. aurantia threads equips them to function in lower RH environments and during the afternoon when RH drops, but their performance is diminished during the high RH of the morning hours. In contrast, the lower hygroscopicity of N. crucifera threads optimizes their performance for intermediate and high RH environments and during the night and morning. These interspecific differences support the hypothesis that viscous capture threads are adapted to the humidity regime of an orbweavers habitat.",2013,10.1242/jeb.084822,216,16,3023-3034,NA,Araneoidea; Argiope aurantia; biomaterial; glycoprotein; hygroscopic; Neoscona crucifera

Aran",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Although many crustaceans produce sounds, their hearing abilities and mechanisms are poorly understood, leaving uncertainties regarding whether or how these animals use sound for acoustic communication. Marine invertebrates lack gas-filled organs required for sound pressure detection, but some of them are known to be sensitive to particle motion. Here, we examined whether the American lobster (Homarus americanus) could detect sound and subsequently sought to discern the auditory mechanisms. Acoustic stimuli responses were measured using auditory evoked potential (AEP) methods. Neurophysiological responses were obtained from the brain using tone pips between 80 and 250 Hz, with best sensitivity at 80-120 Hz. There were no significant differences between the auditory thresholds of males and females. Repeated controls (recordings from deceased lobsters, moving electrodes away from the brain and reducing seawater temperature) indicated the evoked potentials' neuronal origin. In addition, AEP responses were similar before and after antennules (including statocysts) were ablated, demonstrating that the statocysts, a long-proposed auditory structure in crustaceans, are not the sensory organs responsible for lobster sound detection. However, AEPs could be eliminated (or highly reduced) after immobilizing hairfans, which cover much of lobster bodies. These results suggest that these external cuticular hairs are likely to be responsible for sound detection, and imply that hearing is mechanistically possible in a wider array of invertebrates than previously considered. Because the lobsters' hearing range encompasses the fundamental frequency of their buzzing sounds, it is likely that they use sound for intraspecific communication, broadening our understanding of the sensory ecology of this commercially vital species. The lobsters' low-frequency acoustic sensitivity also underscores clear concerns about the potential impacts of anthropogenic noise.",2021,10.1242/jeb.240747,224,6,NA,jeb240747,Marine invertebrate; Crustacean; Hearing; Auditory evoked potential; Acoustic communication

D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Spittlebugs (superfamily Cercopoidea) live within a mass of frothy, spittle-like foam that is produced as a by-product of their xylemfeeding habits. The wet spittle represents a unique respiratory environment for an insect, potentially acting either as a reserve of trapped oxygen (O-2) or as a significant barrier to O-2 diffusion from the surrounding atmosphere. Feeding on xylem sap under tension is also assumed to be energetically expensive, potentially placing further constraints on their gas exchange. To understand the respiratory strategies used by spittlebugs, this study measured the P-O2 within the spittle of the meadow spittlebug, Philaenus spumarius, as well as the non feeding metabolic rate (RMR) and respiratory quotient (RQ) of both nymphs and adults. The metabolic rate of nymphs feeding on xylem was also measured. In separate experiments, the ability of a nymph to obtain O-2 from bubbles while submerged in foam was determined using a glass microscope slide coated in an O-2-sensitive fluorophore. We determined that P. spumarius breathes atmospheric O-2 by extending the tip of its abdomen outside of its spittle, rather than respiring the O-2 trapped in air bubbles within the foam. However, spittlebugs can temporarily use these air bubbles to breathe when forcibly submerged. (V) over dot(O2) and (V) over dot(CO)(2) did not differ statistically within life stages, giving a RQ of 0.92 for nymphs and 0.95 for adults.

After 19 weeks of growth, we observed a decrease in final body mass in fish with an HC dietary history. Feed efficiency was significantly affected by both hypoxic and HC dietary histories. After a short challenge test (5 days) performed with a 30\% carbohydrate diet in juvenile trout, our results also showed that, in trout that experienced hypoxic history, mRNA levels of gluconeogenic genes in liver and glucose transport genes in both liver and muscle were significantly increased at the juvenile stage. Besides, mRNA levels of glycolytic genes were decreased in fish with an HC dietary history. Both hypoxic and dietary histories barely affected plasma metabolites or global epigenetic modifications in juvenile fish after the challenge test.

Because biofilms exist on immersed surfaces on which they attach, barnacles must interact with bacteria during initial attachment and subsequent growth. The objective of this study was to characterize the developing interface of the barnacle and substratum during this key developmental transition to inform potential mechanisms that promote attachment. The interface was characterized using confocal microscopy and fluorescent dyes to identify morphological and chemical changes to the interface and the status of bacteria present as a function of barnacle developmental stage. Staining revealed patchy material containing proteins and nucleic acids, reactive oxygen species amidst developing cuticle, and changes in bacteria viability at the developing interface. We found that as barnacles metamorphose from the cyprid to juvenile stage, proteinaceous materials with the appearance of coagulated liquid were released into and remained at the interface. It stained positive for proteins, including phosphoprotein, as well as nucleic acids. Regions of the developing cuticle and the patchy material itself stained for reactive oxygen species. Bacteria were absent until the cyprid was firmly attached, but populations died as barnacle development progressed.

Javier",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Mollusk larvae have a stable, velum-up orientation that may influence how they sense and react to hydrodynamic signals applied in different directions. Directional sensing abilities and responses could affect how a larva interacts with anisotropic fluid motions, including those in feeding currents and in boundary layers encountered during settlement. Oyster larvae (Crassostrea virginica) were exposed to simple shear in a Couette device and to solid-body rotation in a single rotating cylinder. Both devices were operated in two different orientations, one with the axis of rotation parallel to the gravity vector, and one with the axis perpendicular. Larvae and flow were observed simultaneously with near-infrared particle-image velocimetry, and behavior was quantified as a response to strain rate, vorticity and centripetal acceleration. Only flows rotating about a horizontal axis elicited the diving response observed previously for oyster larvae in turbulence. The results provide strong evidence that the turbulence-sensing mechanism relies on gravity-detecting organs (statocysts) rather than mechanosensors (cilia). Flow sensing with statocysts sets oyster larvae apart from zooplankters such as copepods and protists that use external mechanosensors in sensing spatial velocity gradients generated by prey or predators. Sensing flow-induced changes in orientation, rather than flow deformation, would enable more efficient control of vertical movements. Statocysts provide larvae with a mechanism of maintaining their upward swimming when rotated by vortices and initiating dives toward the seabed in response to the strong turbulence associated with adult habitats.",2015,10.1242/jeb.125096,218,17,2782-2792,NA,Crassostrea virginica; Mechanosensors; Shear; Statocysts; Veligers; Vorticity

Here, we investigated the role of amylase in the digestive processes of Crassostrea gigas, using in vivo RNA interference. This approach also allowed us to investigate the relationship between energy intake by feeding and gametogenesis in oysters. Double-stranded (ds) RNA designed to target the two alpha-amylase genes A and B was injected in vivo into the visceral mass of oysters at two doses. These treatments caused significant reductions in mean mRNA levels of the amylase genes: -50.7\% and -59\% mRNA A, and -71.9\% and -70.6\% mRNA B in 15 and 75 mu g dsRNA-injected oysters, respectively, relative to controls. Interestingly, reproductive knock-down phenotypes were observed for both sexes at 48 days post-injection, with a significant reduction of the gonad area (-22.5\% relative to controls) and germ cell under-proliferation revealed by histology. In response to the higher dose of dsRNA, we also observed reductions in amylase activity (-53\%) and absorption efficiency (-5\%). Based on these data, dynamic energy budget modeling showed that the limitation of energy intake by feeding that was induced by injection of amylase dsRNA was insufficient to affect gonadic development at the level observed in the present study. This finding suggests that other driving mechanisms, such as endogenous hormonal modulation, might significantly change energy allocation to reproduction, and increase the maintenance rate in oysters in response to dsRNA injection.",2015,10.1242/jeb.116699,218,11,1740-1747,NA,alpha-Amylase; dsRNA; Gametogenesis; Marine bivalve; Dynamic energy budget
article,"Decreased hydrogen peroxide production and mitochondrial respiration in skeletal muscle but not cardiac muscle of the green-striped burrowing frog, a natural model of muscle disuse","Reilly, Beau D. and Hickey, Anthony J. R. and Cramp, Rebecca L. and Franklin, Craig E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Suppression of disuse-induced muscle atrophy has been associated with altered mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in mammals. However, despite extended hindlimb immobility, aestivating animals exhibit little skeletal muscle atrophy compared with artificially immobilised mammalian models. Therefore, we studied mitochondrial respiration and ROS (H2O2) production in permeabilised muscle fibres of the green-striped burrowing frog, Cyclorana alboguttata. Mitochondrial respiration within saponin-permeabilised skeletal and cardiac muscle fibres was measured concurrently with ROS production using high-resolution respirometry coupled to custom-made fluorometers. After 4 months of aestivation, C. alboguttata had significantly depressed whole-body metabolism by similar to 70\% relative to control (active) frogs, and mitochondrial respiration in saponin-permeabilised skeletal muscle fibres decreased by almost 50\% both in the absence of ADP and during oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial ROS production showed up to an 88\% depression in aestivating skeletal muscle when malate, succinate and pyruvate were present at concentrations likely to reflect those in vivo. The percentage ROS released per O-2 molecule consumed was also similar to 94\% less at these concentrations, indicating an intrinsic difference in ROS production capacities during aestivation. We also examined mitochondrial respiration and ROS production in permeabilised cardiac muscle fibres and found that aestivating frogs maintained respiratory flux and ROS production at control levels. These results show that aestivating C. alboguttata has the capacity to independently regulate mitochondrial function in skeletal and cardiac muscles. Furthermore, this work indicates that ROS production can be suppressed in the disused skeletal muscle of aestivating frogs, which may in turn protect against potential oxidative damage and preserve skeletal muscle structure during aestivation and following arousal.",2014,10.1242/jeb.096834,217,7,1087-1093,NA,Cyclorana alboguttata; Mitochondria; Muscle atrophy; Oxidative stress; Reactive oxygen species; Skeletal muscle

This new procedure combines a method for removing the aqueous coating of the fibres and a technique that allows the accurate measurement of their cross-sectional area. Comparison of the tensile behaviour of different samples indicated that naturally spun viscid lines show a large variability, comparable to that of other silks, such as major ampullate gland silk and silkworm silk. Nevertheless, application of a statistical analysis allowed the identification of two independent parameters that underlie the variability and characterize the observed range of true stress-true strain curves.

Although many fruit consumers (legitimate seed dispersers as well as seed predators) are clearly exposed to plant secondary compounds (PSCs), their impact on the consumers' physiology and foraging behaviour has been largely overlooked. Here, we document the divergent behavioural and physiological responses to fruit consumption of three congeneric rodent species in the Middle East, representing both seed dispersers and seed predators. The fruit pulp of the desert plant Ochradenus baccatus contains high concentrations of glucosinolates (GLSs). These GLSs are hydrolyzed into active toxic compounds upon contact with the myrosinase enzyme released from seeds crushed during fruit consumption. Acomys russatus and A. cahirinus share a desert habitat. Acomys russatus acts as an O. baccatus seed predator, and A. cahirinus circumvents the activation of the GLSs by orally expelling vital seeds. We found that between the three species examined, A. russatus was physiologically most tolerant to whole fruit consumption and even A. minous, which is evolutionarily naive to O. baccatus, exhibits greater tolerance to whole fruit consumption than A. cahirinus. However, like A. cahirinus, A. minous may also behaviourally avoid the activation of the GLSs by making a hole in the pulp and consuming only the seeds. Our findings demonstrate that seed predators have a higher physiological tolerance than seed dispersers when consuming fruits containing toxic PSCs. The findings also demonstrate the extreme ecological/evolutionary lability of this plant-animal symbiosis to shift from predation to mutualism and vice versa.",2013,10.1242/jeb.089664,216,19,3667-3673,NA,Acomys; alanine aminotransferase; bitter taste; body mass; fruits; glucosinolates; liver; pulp; secondary compounds; seeds
article,"Environment, behavior and physiology: do birds use barometric pressure to predict storms?","Breuner, Creagh W. and Sprague, Rachel S. and Patterson, Stephen H. and Woods, H. Arthur",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Severe storms can pose a grave challenge to the temperature and energy homeostasis of small endothermic vertebrates. Storms are accompanied by lower temperatures and wind, increasing metabolic expenditure, and can inhibit foraging, thereby limiting energy intake. To avoid these potential problems, most endotherms have mechanisms for offsetting the energetic risks posed by storms. One possibility is to use cues to predict oncoming storms and to alter physiology and behavior in ways that make survival more likely. Barometric pressure declines predictably before inclement weather, and several lines of evidence indicate that animals alter behavior based on changes in ambient pressure. Here we examined the effects of declining barometric pressure on physiology and behavior in the white-crowned sparrow, Zonotrichia leucophrys. Using field data from a long-term study, we first evaluated the relationship between barometric pressure, storms and stress physiology in free-living white-crowned sparrows. We then manipulated barometric pressure experimentally in the laboratory and determined how it affects activity, food intake, metabolic rates and stress physiology. The field data showed declining barometric pressure in the 12-24 h preceding snowstorms, but we found no relationship between barometric pressure and stress physiology. The laboratory study showed that declining barometric pressure stimulated food intake, but had no effect on metabolic rate or stress physiology. These data suggest that white-crowned sparrows can sense and respond to declining barometric pressure, and we propose that such an ability may be common in wild vertebrates, especially small ones for whom individual storms can be life-threatening events.",2013,10.1242/jeb.081067,216,11,1982-1990,NA,activity; corticosterone; environmental cues; inclement weather; metabolic rate; stress
article,Trade-offs in muscle physiology in selectively bred high runner mice,"Castro, Alberto A. and Garland, Jr., Theodore and Ahmed, Saad and Holt, Natalie C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"A trade-off between locomotor speed and endurance occurs in various taxa, and is thought to be underpinned by a muscle-level trade-off. Among four replicate high runner (HR) lines of mice, selectively bred for voluntary wheel-running behavior, a negative correlation between average running speed and time spent running has evolved. We hypothesize that this trade-off is due to changes in muscle physiology. We studied the HR lines at generation 90, at which time one line (L3) is fixed for the mini-muscle phenotype, another is polymorphic (L6) and the others (L7, L8) lack mini-muscle individuals. We used in situ preparations to quantify the contractile properties of the triceps surae muscle complex. Maximal shortening velocity varied significantly, being lowest in mini-muscle mice (L3 mini=25.2 mm s(-1), L6 mini=25.5 mm s(-1)), highest in normal-muscle mice L6 and L8 (40.4 and 50.3 mm s(-1), respectively) and intermediate in normal-muscle L7 mice (37.2 mm s(-1)). Endurance, measured both as the slope of the decline in force and the proportion of initial force that could be sustained, also varied significantly. The slope was shallowest in mini-muscle mice (L3 mini=-0.00348, L6 mini=-0.00238), steepest in lines L6 and L8 (-0.01676 and -0.01853), and intermediate in L7 (-0.01145). Normalized sustained force was highest in mini-muscle mice (L3 mini=0.98, L6 mini=0.92) and lowest in L8 (0.36). There were significant, negative correlations between velocity and endurance metrics, indicating a muscle-level trade-off. However, this muscle-level trade-off does not seem to underpin the organismal-level speed and endurance trade-off previously reported as the ordering of the lines is reversed: the lines that run the fastest for the least time have the lowest muscle complex velocity and highest endurance.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244083,225,23,NA,jeb244083,Artificial selection; Endurance; Force-velocity; Locomotion; Muscle physiology; Trade-offs

Moreover, perturbation of the microbiome during critical developmental periods potentially has long-lasting impacts on hosts. Using four selectively bred high runner and four non-selected control lines of mice, we examined the effects of early-life diet and exercise manipulations on the adult microbiome by sequencing the hypervariable internal transcribed spacer region of the bacterial gut community. Mice from high runner lines run similar to 3-fold more on wheels than do controls, and have several other phenotypic differences (e.g. higher food consumption and body temperature) that could alter the microbiome, either acutely or in terms of coevolution. Males from generation 76 were given wheels and/or a Western diet from weaning until sexual maturity at 6 weeks of age. then housed individually without wheels on standard diet until 14 weeks of age, when fecal samples were taken. Juvenile Western diet reduced bacterial richness and diversity after the 8-week washout period (equivalent to similar to 6 human years). We also found interactive effects of genetic line type, juvenile diet and/or juvenile exercise on microbiome composition and diversity. Microbial community structure clustered significantly in relation to both line type and diet. Western diet also reduced the relative abundance of Muribaculum intestinale. These results constitute one of the first reports of juvenile diet having long-lasting effects on the adult microbiome after a substantial washout period.

article,Reactive oxygen species or reactive sulfur species: why we should consider the latter,"Olson, Kenneth R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The biological effects of oxidants, especially reactive oxygen species (ROS), include signaling functions (oxidative eustress), initiation of measures to reduce elevated ROS (oxidative stress), and a cascade of pathophysiological events that accompany excessive ROS (oxidative distress). Although these effects have long been studied in animal models with perturbed ROS, their actions under physiological conditions are less clear. I propose that some of the apparent uncertainty may be due to confusion of ROS with endogenously generated reactive sulfur species (RSS). ROS and RSS are chemically similar, but RSS are more reactive and versatile, and can be stored and reused. Both ROS and RSS signal via oxidation reactions with protein cysteine sulfur and they produce identical effector responses, but RSS appear to be more effective. RSS in the form of persulfidated cysteines (Cys-S-S) are produced endogenously and co-translationally introduced into proteins, and there is increasing evidence that many cellular proteins are persulfidated. A number of practical factors have contributed to confusion between ROS and RSS, and these are discussed herein. Furthermore, essentially all endogenous antioxidant enzymes appeared shortly after life began, some 3.8 billion years ago, when RSS metabolism dominated evolution. This was long before the rise in ROS, 600 million years ago, and I propose that these same enzymes, with only minor modifications, still effectively metabolize RSS in extant organisms. I am not suggesting that all ROS are RSS; however, I believe that the relative importance of ROS and RSS in biological systems needs further consideration.",2020,10.1242/jeb.196352,223,4,NA,jeb196352,ROS; RSS; Oxidative stress; Evolution; Sulfur metabolism; Signaling
article,Stress coping and evolution of aerobic exercise performance: corticosterone levels in voles from a selection experiment,"Lipowska, Malgorzata M. and Sadowska, Edyta T. and Bauchinger, Ulf and Koteja, Pawel",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The locomotor performance achieved in a challenging situation depends not only on physiological limitations, such as the aerobic exercise capacity, but also on behavioral characteristics, such as adequate coping with stress. The stress response is mediated largely by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, through modulated release of glucocorticoids. We used a unique experimental evolution model system to test the hypothesis that the evolution of an increased aerobic exercise performance can be facilitated by modification of the glucocorticoid-related stress-coping mechanisms. Bank voles (Myodes glareolus) from `aerobic' (A) lines, selected for 22 generations for high maximum swim-induced rate of oxygen consumption ((V) over dot(O2,swim)), achieved a 64\% higher (V) over dot(O2,swim) than those from unselected, control lines. The temporal pattern of exercise during the swimming trial also evolved, and the A-line voles achieved (V) over dot(O2,swim) later in the course of the trial, which indicates a modification of the stress response characteristics. Both (V) over dot(O2,swim) and the average metabolic rate measured during the trial tended to increase with baseline corticosterone level, and decreased with the post-exercise corticosterone level. Thus, increased baseline corticosterone level promotes high metabolic performance, but a high corticosterone response to swimming acts as an inhibitor rather than stimulator of intense activity. However, neither of the corticosterone traits differed between the A-selected and control lines. Thus, the experiment did not provide evidence that evolution of increased aerobic performance is facilitated by the modification of glucocorticoid levels. The results, however, do not exclude the possibility that other aspects of the HPA axis function evolved in response to the selection.",2019,10.1242/jeb.209593,222,20,NA,jeb209593,Aerobic performance; HPA axis; Corticosterone; Artificial selection; Myodes glareolus
article,The effects of target contrast on <i>Drosophila</i> courtship,"Agrawal, Sweta and Dickinson, Michael H.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Many animals use visual cues such as object shape, color and motion to detect and pursue conspecific mates. Contrast is another possibly informative visual cue, but has not been studied in great detail. In this study, we presented male Drosophila melanogaster with small, flysized, moving objects painted either black, white or gray to test whether they use contrast cues to identify mates. We found that males frequently chased gray objects and rarely chased white or black objects. Although males started chasing black objects as often as gray objects, the resulting chases were much shorter. To test whether the attraction to gray objects was mediated via contrast, we fabricated black and gray behavioral chambers. However, wild-type males almost never chased any objects in these darkly colored chambers. To circumvent this limitation, we increased baseline levels of chasing by thermogenetically activating P1 neurons to promote courtship. Males with thermogenetically activated P1 neurons maintained a similar preference for gray objects despite elevated levels of courtship behavior. When placed in a black chamber, males with activated P1 neurons switched their preference and chased black objects more than gray objects. We also tested whether males use contrast cues to orient to particular parts of the female's body during courtship. When presented with moving objects painted two colors, males positioned themselves next to the gray half regardless of whether the other half was painted black or white. These results suggest that males can use contrast to recognize potential mates and to position themselves during courtship.",2019,10.1242/jeb.203414,222,16,NA,jeb203414,Mate recognition; P1 neurons; Object recognition

We contrasted markers of oxidative damage with antioxidant profiles across age and sex for propulsive (longissismus dorsi) and maneuvering (pectoralis) muscles of Weddell seals to determine whether previously observed morphological senescence is associated with oxidative stress. In longissismus dorsi, old (age 17-26 years) seals exhibited a nearly 2-fold increase in apoptosis over young (age 9-16 years) seals. There was no evidence of age-associated changes in lipid peroxidation or enzymatic antioxidant profiles. In pectoralis, 4-hydroxynonenal-Lys (4-HNE-Lys) levels increased 1.5-fold in old versus young seals, but lipid hydroperoxide levels and apoptotic index did not vary with age. Glutathione peroxidase activity was 1.5-fold higher in pectoralis of old versus young animals, but no other antioxidants changed with age in this muscle. With respect to sex, no differences in lipid hydroperoxides or apoptosis were observed in either muscle. Males had higher HSP70 expression (1.4-fold) and glutathione peroxidase activity (1.3-fold) than females in longissismus dorsi, although glutathione reductase activity was 1.4-fold higher in females. No antioxidants varied with sex in pectoralis. These results show that apoptosis is not associated with oxidative stress in aged Weddell seal muscles.

To understand how poison frogs move alkaloids from their diet to their skin granular glands, we focused on measuring gene expression in the intestines, skin and liver. Across these tissues, we found many differentially expressed transcripts involved in small molecule transport and metabolism, as well as sodium channels and other ion pumps. We then used proteomic approaches to quantify plasma proteins, where we found several protein abundance differences between wild and laboratory frogs, including the amphibian neurotoxin binding protein saxiphilin. Finally, because many blood proteins are synthesized in the liver, we used thermal proteome profiling as an untargeted screen for soluble proteins that bind the alkaloid decahydroquinoline. Using this approach, we identified several candidate proteins that interact with this alkaloid, including saxiphilin.

Mean heart rate (f(H)) recovered rapidly (<24 h) from anaesthesia and operative procedures. This preceded a more gradual development of heart rate variability (HRV), with instantaneous f(H) increasing during each lung ventilation cycle. Atropine injection increased mean f(H) and abolished HRV. Complete autonomic blockade revealed a cholinergic tonus on the heart of 55\% and an adrenergic tonus of 37\%. Power spectral analysis of HRV identified a peak at the same frequency as ventilation. This correlation was sustained after temperature changes and it was more evident, marked by a more prominent power spectrum peak, when ventilation is less episodic. This HRV component is homologous to that observed in mammals, termed respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). Evidence for instantaneous control of f(H) indicated rapid conduction of activity in the cardiac efferent nervous supply, as supported by the description of myelinated fibres in the cardiac vagus.

We have used a previously developed methodology focused on the detailed mathematical description of head compensatory movements in frogs without the need for any surgical procedures on the examined specimens. Our comparative study comprising 35 species of frogs from different phylogenetic backgrounds revealed species-specific head compensatory abilities ensuring gaze stabilization. Moreover, we found a strong phylogenetic signal highlighting the great ability of compensatory head movements in families of Pyxicephalidae and Rhacophoridae from the Natatanura group. By contrast, families of Dendrobatidae and Microhylidae exhibited only poor or no head compensatory movements. Contrary to our expectation, the results did not corroborate an ecomorphological hypothesis anticipating a close relationship between ecological parameters and the head compensatory movements. We did not find any positive association between more complex (3D structured, arboreal or aquatic) habitats or more saltatory behavior and elevated abilities of head compensatory movements. Moreover, we found compensatory movements in most basal Archeobatrachia, giving an indication of common ancestry of these abilities in frogs that are variously pronounced in particular families. We hypothesize that the uncovered proper gaze stabilization during locomotion provided by the higher head compensatory abilities can improve or even enable visual perception of the prey. We interpret this completely novel finding as a possible gyroscopic advantage in a foraging context.

To test whether the swimming energetics and kinematics of shiner perch, Cymatogaster aggregata (a labriform swimmer), were affected by turbulence, two flow conditions were constructed in a swim-tunnel respirometer. A low-turbulence flow was created using a common swim-tunnel respirometry setup with a flow straightener and finemesh grid to minimize velocity fluctuations. A high-turbulence flow condition was created by allowing large velocity fluctuations to persist without a flow straightener or fine grid. The two conditions were tested with particle image velocimetry to confirm significantly different turbulence properties throughout a range of mean flow speeds. Oxygen consumption rate of the swimming fish increased with swimming speed and pectoral fin beat frequency in both flow conditions. Higher turbulence also caused a greater positional variability in swimming individuals (versus low-turbulence flow) at medium and high speeds. Surprisingly, fish used less oxygen in high-turbulence compared with low-turbulence flow at medium and high swimming speeds. Simultaneous measurements of swimming kinematics indicated that these reductions in oxygen consumption could not be explained by specific known flow-adaptive behaviours such as Karman gaiting or entraining. Therefore, fish in highturbulence flow may take advantage of the high variability in turbulent energy through time. These results suggest that swimming behaviour and energetics measured in the lab in straightened flow, typical of standard swimming respirometers, might differ from that of more turbulent, semi-natural flow conditions.",2018,10.1242/jeb.168773,221,11,NA,jeb168773,Vortex; Eddy; Gait; Swimming kinematics; Metabolism; Space use

Our objective was to investigate the effect of skMLCK-catalyzed RLC phosphorylation on the energetic cost of contraction and the contractile economy (ratio of mechanical output to metabolic input) of mouse fast twitch muscle in vitro (25 degrees C). To this end, extensor digitorumlongus (EDL) muscles from wild-type (WT) and from skMLCK-devoid (skMLCK(-/-)) mice were subjected to repetitive low-frequency stimulation (10 Hz for 15 s) to produce staircase potentiation of isometric twitch force, after which muscles were quick frozen for determination of high-energy phosphate consumption (HEPC). During stimulation, WT muscles displayed significant potentiation of isometric twitch force while skMLCK(-/-)muscles did not (i.e. 23\% versus 5\% change, respectively). Consistent with this, RLC phosphorylation was increased similar to 3.5-fold from the unstimulated control value in WT but not in skMLCK(-/-)muscles. Despite these differences, the HEPC of WT muscles was not greater than that of skMLCK(-/-)muscles. As a result of the increased contractile output relative to HEPC, the calculated contractile economy of WT muscles was greater than that of skMLCK(-/-)muscles. Thus, our results suggest that skMLCK-catalyzed phosphorylation of the myosin RLC increases the contractile economy of WT mouse EDL muscle compared with skMLCK(-/-)muscles without RLC phosphorylation.",2018,10.1242/jeb.167718,221,2,NA,jeb167718,Regulatory light chain; Myosin light chain kinase; Isometric twitch; Energetics

Although mites accelerated and decelerated rapidly during straight running (7.2 +/- 1.2 and -10.1 +/- 2.1 m s(-2), respectively), the forces involved were comparable to those found in other animals. Paratarsotomus macropalpis employs an alternating tetrapod gait during steady running. Shallow turns were accomplished by a simple asymmetry in stride length. During tight turns, mites pivoted around the tarsus of the inside third leg (L3), which thus behaved like a grappling hook. Pivot turns were characterized by a 42\% decrease in turning radius and a 40\% increase in angular velocity compared with non-pivot turns. The joint angle amplitudes of the inner L2 and L3 were negligible during a pivot turn. While exceptional, running speeds in P. macropalpis approximate values predicted from inter-specific scaling relationships.",2016,10.1242/jeb.128652,219,5,676-685,NA,Paratarsotomus; Relative speed; Stride frequency; Gait; Turning
article,Is oxidative status influenced by dietary carotenoid and physical activity after moult in the great tit (Parus major)?,"Vaugoyeau, Marie and Decenciere, Beatriz and Perret, Samuel and Karadas, Filiz and Meylan, Sandrine and Biard, Clotilde",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In the context of sexual and natural selection, an allocation trade-off for carotenoid pigments may exist because of their obligate dietary origin and their role both in the antioxidant and immune systems and in the production of coloured signals in various taxa, particularly birds. When birds have expended large amounts of carotenoids to feather growth such as after autumn moult, bird health and oxidative status might be more constrained. We tested this hypothesis in a bird species with carotenoid-based plumage colour, by manipulating dietary carotenoids and physical activity, which can decrease antioxidant capacity and increase reactive oxygen metabolite (ROM) concentration. Great tits were captured after moult and kept in aviaries, under three treatments: physical handicap and dietary supplementation with carotenoids, physical handicap and control diet, and no handicap and control diet. We measured plasma composition (antioxidant capacity, ROM concentration, and vitamin A, vitamin E and total carotenoid concentrations), immune system activation (blood sedimentation) and stress response (heterophil/lymphocyte ratio) and predicted that handicap treatment should influence these negatively and carotenoid supplementation positively. Coloration of yellow feathers was also measured. Carotenoid supplementation increased total plasma carotenoid concentration, decreased feather carotenoid chroma and marginally increased ROM concentration. Handicap increased blood sedimentation only in males but had no clear influence on oxidative stress, which contradicted previous studies. Further studies are needed to investigate how physical activity and carotenoid availability might interact and influence oxidative stress outside the moult period, and their combined potential influence on attractiveness and reproductive investment later during the breeding season.",2015,10.1242/jeb.111039,218,13,2106-2115,NA,Antioxidants; Carotenoid-based colour; Physiological stress; Immunity
article,Vocal performance affects metabolic rate in dolphins: implications for animals communicating in noisy environments,"Holt, Marla M. and Noren, Dawn P. and Dunkin, Robin C. and Williams, Terrie M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Many animals produce louder, longer or more repetitious vocalizations to compensate for increases in environmental noise. Biological costs of increased vocal effort in response to noise, including energetic costs, remain empirically undefined in many taxa, particularly in marine mammals that rely on sound for fundamental biological functions in increasingly noisy habitats. For this investigation, we tested the hypothesis that an increase in vocal effort would result in an energetic cost to the signaler by experimentally measuring oxygen consumption during rest and a 2 min vocal period in dolphins that were trained to vary vocal loudness across trials. Vocal effort was quantified as the total acoustic energy of sounds produced. Metabolic rates during the vocal period were, on average, 1.2 and 1.5 times resting metabolic rate (RMR) in dolphin A and B, respectively. As vocal effort increased, we found that there was a significant increase in metabolic rate over RMR during the 2 min following sound production in both dolphins, and in total oxygen consumption (metabolic cost of sound production plus recovery costs) in the dolphin that showed a wider range of vocal effort across trials. Increases in vocal effort, as a consequence of increases in vocal amplitude, repetition rate and/or duration, are consistent with behavioral responses to noise in free - ranging animals. Here, we empirically demonstrate for the first time in a marine mammal, that these vocal modifications can have an energetic impact at the individual level and, importantly, these data provide a mechanistic foundation for evaluating biological consequences of vocal modification in noise - polluted habitats.",2015,10.1242/jeb.122424,218,11,1647-1654,NA,Bottlenose dolphin; Tursiops truncatus; Metabolic cost; Oxygen consumption; Vocal effort; Vocal modification
article,Pregnancy limits lung function during exercise and depresses metabolic rate in the skink <i>Tiliqua nigrolutea</i>,"Munns, Suzanne L. and Edwards, Ashley and Nicol, Stewart and Frappell, Peter B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"High gestational loads have been associated with a range of ecological costs, such as decreased locomotor ability; however, the physiological mechanisms that underpin these changes are poorly understood. In this study, breathing patterns, metabolic rates, lung volume and lung diffusing capacity were measured at rest and during exercise in the pregnant skink Tiliqua nigrolutea. Breathing patterns were largely unaffected by gestation; however, decreases in metabolic rate (rate of oxygen consumption) in the late stages of pregnancy induced a relative hyperventilation. The reductions in metabolic rate during late pregnancy prevent the calculation of the maintenance cost of pregnancy based on post-partum and neonatal metabolic rates. Despite the high relative litter mass of 38.9 +/- 5.3\%, lung diffusing capacity was maintained during all stages of pregnancy, suggesting that alterations in diffusion at the alveolar capillary membrane were not responsible for the relative hyperventilation. Lung volume was increased during pregnancy compared with non-pregnant females, but lung volume was significantly lower during pregnancy compared with post-partum lung volume. Pregnant females were unable to produce the same metabolic and ventilatory changes induced by exercise in nonpregnant females. This lack of ability to respond to increased respiratory drive during exercise may underpin the locomotor impairment measured during gestation in previous studies.",2015,10.1242/jeb.111450,218,6,931-939,NA,Ventilation; Breathing pattern; Oxygen consumption; Gestation; Lizard; Reptile; Pulmonary gas exchange; Lung diffusion capacity; Lung volume; Cost of pregnancy
article,"Elevated carboxyhemoglobin in a marine mammal, the northern elephant seal","Tift, Michael S. and Ponganis, Paul J. and Crocker, Daniel E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Low concentrations of endogenous carbon monoxide (CO), generated primarily through degradation of heme from hemeproteins, have been shown to maintain physiological function of organs and to exert cytoprotective effects. However, high concentrations of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), formed by CO binding to hemoglobin, potentially prevent adequate O-2 delivery to tissues by lowering arterial O-2 content. Elevated heme-protein concentrations, as found in marine mammals, are likely associated with greater heme degradation, more endogenous CO production and, consequently, elevated COHb concentrations. Therefore, we measured COHb in elephant seals, a species with large blood volumes and elevated hemoglobin and myoglobin concentrations. The levels of COHb were positively related to the total hemoglobin concentration. The maximum COHb value was 10.4\% of total hemoglobin concentration. The mean (+/- s.e.m.) value in adult seals was 8.7 +/- 0.3\% (N=6), while juveniles and pups (with lower heme-protein contents) had lower mean COHb values of 7.6 +/- 0.2\% and 7.1 +/- 0.3\%, respectively (N=9 and N=9, respectively). Serial samples over several hours revealed little to no fluctuation in COHb values. This consistent elevation in COHb suggests that the magnitude and/ or rate of heme-protein turnover is much higher than in terrestrial mammals. The maximum COHb values from this study decrease total body O-2 stores by 7\%, thereby reducing the calculated aerobic dive limit for this species. However, the constant presence of elevated CO in blood may also protect against potential ischemia-reperfusion injury associated with the extreme breath-holds of elephant seals. We suggest the elephant seal represents an ideal model for understanding the potential cytoprotective effects, mechanisms of action and evolutionary adaptation associated with chronically elevated concentrations of endogenously produced CO.",2014,10.1242/jeb.100677,217,10,1752-1757,NA,Calculated aerobic dive limit; Carbon monoxide; Hemoglobin absorption spectra; Marine mammal; Oxygen stores
article,Analysis of the transitional flow field over a fixed hummingbird wing,"Elimelech, Yossef and Ellington, Charles P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"We analyzed the flow fields characterized by chord-based Reynolds numbers of 5000 to 15,000 over a stationary model of a hummingbird (Calypte anna) wing. Utilizing two experimental techniques, constant-temperature anemometry and stereo particle image velocimetry, the high-fidelity results depict a laminar-to-turbulent transition process that develops over the wing. At both zero and non-zero angles of attack the spectrum of the velocity signals is wide. At non-zero angles of attack the flow separates from the wing surface and a shear layer forms. As a result, unsteady flow disturbances amplify at a chord-based Reynolds numbers as low as 5000. Nevertheless, only at a Reynolds number of 15,000 is the flow disturbance growth rate sufficient to bring enough momentum from the outer region of the boundary layer to reattach the flow to the wing surface. For a Reynolds number of 5000, a comparison between the observed growth rates and a theoretical approximation concludes that flow disturbances of a Strouhal number of unity (and above) are no longer two-dimensional. In view of these conclusions, this study could serve as the first step towards a better understanding of the flow mechanisms over steady revolving and periodically flapping wings at this Reynolds number regime.",2013,10.1242/jeb.075341,216,2,303-318,NA,laminar-to-turbulent transition; separation-induced transition; low Reynolds number flow; aerodynamics; hummingbird flight

In this study, we present a novel strategy for automated scoring of thermal tolerance videos by inferring motor activity with motion detection using an open-source Python command line application called DIME (detector of insect motion endpoint).

article,Diving behaviour of southern elephant seals: new models of behavioural and ecophysiological adjustments of oxygen store management,"Piot, Erwan and Picard, Baptiste and Badaut, Jerome and Gilbert, Caroline and Guinet, Christophe",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Among pinnipeds, southern elephant seals (SESs, Mirounga leonina) are extreme divers that dive deeply and continuously along foraging trips to restore their body stores after fasting on land during breeding or moulting. Their replenishment of body stores influences their energy expenditure during dives and their oxygen (O2) reserves (via muscular mass), yet how they manage their O2 stores during their dives is not fully understood. In this study, 63 female SESs from Kerguelen Island were equipped with accelerometers and time-depth recorders to investigate changes in diving parameters through their foraging trips. Two categories of dive behaviour were identified and related to the body size of individuals, with smaller SESs performing shallower and shorter dives requiring greater mean stroke amplitude compared with larger individuals. In relation to body size, the larger seals had lower estimated oxygen consumption levels for a given buoyancy (i.e. body density) compared with smaller individuals. However, both groups were estimated to have the same oxygen consumption of 0.079 \& PLUSMN;0.001 ml O2 stroke-1 kg-1 for a given dive duration and at neutral buoyancy when the cost of transport was minimal. Based on these relationships, we built two models that estimate changes in oxygen consumption according to dive duration and body density. The study highlights that replenishing body stores improves SES foraging efficiency, as indicated by increased time spent at the bottom of the ocean. Thus, prey-capture attempts increase as SES buoyancy approaches the neutral buoyancy point.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245157,226,13,NA,jeb245157,Accelerometer; Aerobic dive limit; Diving behaviours; Energetics; Metabolism; Mirounga leonina

Studies examining the effects of environmental stressors on a female's physiological state and body condition during reproduction, as well as the physiological condition of offspring, have yielded equivocal results. Mitochondrial physiology and oxidative stress have been implicated as important mediators of life-history trade-offs. The goal of this investigation was to uncover the physiological mechanisms responsible for the enhanced trade-off between self-maintenance and offspring investment when an animal is exposed to stressful conditions during reproduction. To that end, we manipulated circulating corticosterone (CORT) levels by orally supplementing lactating female mice with CORT and investigated mitochondrial physiology and oxidative stress of both the reproductive females and their young. We found that maternal CORT exposure resulted in lower litter mass at weaning, but mitochondrial performance and oxidative status of females were not impacted. We also found potential beneficial effects of maternal CORT on mitochondrial function (e.g. higher respiratory control ratio) and oxidative stress (e.g. lower reactive oxygen species production) of offspring in adulthood, suggesting that elevated maternal CORT may be a signal for early-life adversity and prepare the organism with a predictive, adaptive response to future stressors.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244171,225,22,NA,jeb244171,Stress; Glucocorticoids; Mitochondria; Oxidative stress; Maternal effects
article,"Larval nutrition impacts survival to adulthood, body size and the allometric scaling of metabolic rate in adult honeybees","Nicholls, Elizabeth and Rossi, Marta and Niven, Jeremy E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Resting metabolic rate (RMR) is a fundamental physiological measure linked to numerous aspects of organismal function, including lifespan. Although dietary restriction in insects during larval growth/development affects adult RMR, the impact of the nutritional composition of larval diets (i.e. diet quality) on adult RMR has not been studied. Using in vitro rearing to control larval diet quality, we determined the effect of dietary protein and carbohydrate on honeybee survival to adulthood, time to eclosion, body mass/size and adult RMR. High carbohydrate larval diets increased survival to adulthood and time to eclosion compared with both low carbohydrate and high protein diets. Upon emergence, bees reared on the high protein diet were smaller and lighter than those reared on other diets, whilst those raised on the high carbohydrate diet varied more in body mass. Newly emerged adult bees reared on the high carbohydrate diet showed a significantly steeper increase in allometric scaling of RMR compared with those reared on other diets. This suggests that the nutritional composition of larval diets influences survival to adulthood, time to eclosion and the allometric scaling of RMR. Given that agricultural intensification and increasing urbanisation have led to a decrease in both forage availability and dietary diversity for bees, our results are critical to improving understanding of the impacts of poor developmental nutrition on bee growth/development and physiology.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242393,224,14,NA,jeb242393,Diet; Protein; Development; Carbohydrate; Metabolic scaling; Apis mellifera
article,Algorithms underlying flexible phototaxis in larval zebrafish,"Chen, Alex B. and Deb, Diptodip and Bahl, Armin and Engert, Florian",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"To thrive, organisms must maintain physiological and environmental variables in suitable ranges. Given that these variables undergo constant fluctuations over varying time scales, how do biological control systems maintain control over these values? We explored this question in the context of phototactic behavior in larval zebrafish. We demonstrate that larval zebrafish use phototaxis to maintain environmental luminance at a set point, that the value of this set point fluctuates on a time scale of seconds when environmental luminance changes, and that it is determined by calculating the mean input across both sides of the visual field. These results expand on previous studies of flexible phototaxis in larval zebrafish; they suggest that larval zebrafish exert homeostatic control over the luminance of their surroundings, and that feedback from the surroundings drives allostatic changes to the luminance set point. As such, we describe a novel behavioral algorithm with which larval zebrafish exert control over a sensory variable.",2021,10.1242/jeb.238386,224,10,NA,jeb238386,Larval zebrafish; Phototaxis; Homeostasis; Allostatic control; Luminance adaptation; Behavioral tracking
article,<i>Drosophila</i> larval epidermal cells only exhibit epidermal aging when they persist to the adult stage,"Wang, Yan and Burra, Sirisha and Galko, Michael J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Holometabolous insects undergo a complete transformation of the body plan from the larval to the adult stage. In Drosophila, this transformation includes replacement of larval epidermal cells (LECs) by adult epidermal cells (AECs). AECs in Drosophila undergo a rapid and stereotyped aging program where they lose both cell membranes and nuclei. Whether LECs are capable of undergoing aging in a manner similar to AECs remains unknown. Here, we addressed this question in two ways. First, we looked for hallmarks of epidermal aging in larvae that have a greatly extended third instar and/or carry mutations that would alter the pace of epidermal aging at the adult stage. Such larvae, irrespective of genotype, did not show any of the signs of epidermal aging observed in the adult. Second, we developed a procedure to effect a heterochronic persistence of LECs into the adult epidermal sheet. Lineage tracing verified that presumptive LECs in the adult epidermis are not derived from imaginal epidermal histoblasts. LECs embedded within the adult epidermal sheet undergo clear signs of epidermal aging; they form multinucleate cells with each other and with the surrounding AECs. The incidence of adult cells with mixed AEC nuclei (small) and persistent LEC nuclei (large) increased with age. Our data reveal that epidermal aging in holometabolous Drosophila is a stage-specific phenomenon and that the capacity of LECs to respond to aging signals does exist.",2021,10.1242/jeb.240986,224,9,NA,jeb240986,Adult epidermal cells; Aging signals; Larvae; Heterochronic; Drosophila

Recent evidence suggests that curcumin, a yellow pigment derived from turmeric and shown to exhibit antioxidant properties as a RONS scavenger, influences the regulation of genetic elements in endogenous antioxidant pathways. To investigate the role of curcumin in sex-specific in vivo responses to oxidative stress, Drosophila were reared on media supplemented with 025, 2.5 or 25 mmol l(-1) curcuminoids (consisting of cuncumin, demethoxycuncumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin) and resistance to oxidative stress and neural parameters were assessed. High levels of curcuminoids exhibited two sex-specific effects: protection from hydrogen peroxide as an oxidative stressor and alterations in turning rate in an open field. Taken together, these results suggest that the influence of curcuminoids as antioxidants probably relies on changes in gene expression and that sexual dimorphism exists in the in vivo response to curcuminoids.",2020,10.1242/jeb.223867,223,22,NA,jeb223867,Curcumin; Drosophila; Neural development; Oxidative stress
article,Mechanical fatigue fractures bivalve shells,"Crane, R. L. and Denny, M. W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Mollusk shells protect against diverse environmental and predatory physical threats, from one-time impacts to chronic, low-magnitude stresses. The effectiveness of shells as armor is often quantified with a test of shell strength: increasing force is applied until catastrophic fracture. This test does not capture the potential role of fatigue, a process by which chronic or repeated, low-magnitude forces weaken and break a structure. We quantified the strength and fatigue resistance of California mussel (Mytilus californianus) shells. Shells were fatigue tested until catastrophic failure by either loading a valve repeatedly to a set force (cyclic) or loading a valve under constant force (static). Valves fatigued under both cyclic and static loading, i.e. subcritical forces broke valves when applied repeatedly or for long durations. Stronger and more fatigue-resistant valves tended to be more massive, relatively wider and the right-hand valve. Furthermore, after accounting for the valves' predicted strength, fatigue resistance curves for cyclic and static loading did not differ, suggesting that fatigue fracture of mussels is more dependent on force duration than number of cycles. Contextualizing fatigue resistance with the forces mussels typically experience clarifies the range of threats for which fatigue becomes relevant. Some predators could rely on fatigue, and episodic events like large wave impacts or failed predation attempts could weaken shells across long time scales. Quantifying shell fatigue resistance when considering the ecology of shelled organisms or the evolution of shell form offers a perspective that accounts for the accumulating damage of a lifetime of threats, large and small.",2020,10.1242/jeb.220277,223,10,NA,jeb220277,Mytilus californianus; Cyclic loading; Functional morphology; Mollusk; Mussel; Strength

Tuning of contractile properties may therefore provide an opportunity for muscles to better perform their different roles and impact their associated whole-organism performance. Here, we examined the muscle contractile physiology of a jaw and a leg muscle in five Anolis species to determine whether consistent physiological differences are found in these muscles. We found that these jaw and leg muscles exhibited consistent patterns of variation across species, which may be related to the functional use of each muscle. In particular, we found that each muscle had differentially increased different measures of muscle speed. Although the jaw muscles had faster peak contractile velocities than the leg muscles, the leg muscles had faster twitch times and faster contractile velocities under intermediate loads. We also found that the jaw muscles exerted higher specific tensions and had a greater curvature to their force-velocity relationship.

Here, we investigated their potential role during the diving phase of the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). To this effect, the whole vertebral retia mirabilia of a series of dolphins were removed during post-mortem analysis and examined to assess vessel diameters, and estimate vascular volume and flow rate. We formulated a new hemodynamic model to help clarify vascular dynamics throughout the diving phase, based on the total blood volume of a bottlenose dolphin, and using data available about the perfusion of the main organs and body systems. We computed the minimum blood perfusion necessary to the internal organs, and the stroke volume and cardiac output during the surface state. We then simulated breath-holding conditions and perfusion of the internal organs under the diving-induced bradycardia and reduction of stroke volume and cardiac output, using 10 beats min(-1) as the limit for the heart rate for an extended dive of over 3 min. Within these simulated conditions, the retia mirabilia play a vital role as reservoirs of oxygenated blood that permit functional performances and survival of the heart and brain.

We previously demonstrated the upregulation of transcripts related to DNA replication and repair pathways in Spalax. Yet, to date, no direct experimental evidence for improved genomic maintenance has been demonstrated for this genus.

Here, we show that persistent daily rhythms in AGS are maintained through a circadian system that readily entrains to the polar day yet remains insensitive to entrainment by rapid light-dark transitions, which AGS generate naturally as a consequence of their semi-fossorial behavior. Additionally, AGS do not show `jet lag', the slow realignment of circadian rhythms induced by the inertia of an intrinsically stable master circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).

Some studies indicate that torpor prevents sleeping and causes effects similar to sleep deprivation. Impairment of processes stabilizing memory slows down learning accuracy and speed. We conducted two experiments to test whether greater mouse-eared bats, Myotis myotis, which commonly use torpor during the summer period, experience a trade-off between energy savings and learning abilities. We compared learning speed and accuracy in bats that were exposed to low (7 degrees C) and higher ambient temperatures (22 degrees C) between training and experimental sessions. Tests were conducted in experiments with food reward (food search) and without food reward (perch search). Time spent with the skin temperature above 30 degrees C was significantly longer for bats exposed to 22 degrees C than for those exposed to 7 degrees C, and longer in experiments with food reward than without food reward. We observed only a very weak tendency for better accuracy and shorter search times in bats exposed to 22 degrees C than in those exposed to 7 degrees C. Our data indicate that memory consolidation of bats under natural conditions is not affected by daily torpor when bats are in good condition and may therefore defend against a rapid fall into torpor.

I.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Animals cope with seasonal variation in environmental factors by adjustments of physiology and life history. When seasonal variation is partly predictable, such adjustments can be based on a genetic component or be phenotypically flexible. Animals have to allocate limited resources over different demands, including immune function. Accordingly, immune traits could change seasonally, and such changes could have a genetic component that differs between environments. We tested this hypothesis in genotypically distinct groups of a widespread songbird, the stonechat (Saxicola torquata). We compared variation in immunity during 1 year in long-distance migrants, short-distance migrants, tropical residents and hybrids in a common garden environment. Additionally, we investigated phenotypically flexible responses to temperature by applying different temperature regimes to one group. We assessed constitutive immunity by measuring hemagglutination, hemolysis, haptoglobin and bactericidal ability against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Genotypic groups differed in patterns of variation of all measured immune indices except haptoglobin. Hybrids differed from, but were rarely intermediate to, parental subspecies. Temperature treatment only influenced patterns of hemolysis and bactericidal ability against E. coli. We conclude that seasonal variation in constitutive immunity has a genetic component, that heredity does not follow simple Mendelian rules, and that some immune measures are relatively rigid while others are more flexible. Furthermore, our results support the idea that seasonal variability in constitutive immunity is associated with variability in environment and annualcycle demands. This study stresses the importance of considering seasonal variation in immune function in relation to the ecology and life history of the organism of interest.",2014,10.1242/jeb.097105,217,9,1510-1518,NA,Common garden; Constitutive immunity; Genetic components; Phenotypic flexibility; Seasonal variation; Stonechats
article,Physiological adaptations to reproduction. I. Experimentally increasing litter size enhances aspects of antioxidant defence but does not cause oxidative damage in mice,"Garratt, Michael and Pichaud, Nicolas and King, Edith D. Aloise and Brooks, Robert C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Life history theory suggests that investment in reproduction can trade off against growth, longevity and both reproduction and performance later in life. One possible reason for this trade-off is that reproduction directly causes somatic damage. Oxidative stress, an overproduction of reactive oxygen species in relation to cellular defences, can correlate with reproductive investment and has been implicated as a pathway leading to senescence. This has led to the suggestion that this aspect of physiology could be an important mechanism underlying the trade-off between reproduction and lifespan. We manipulated female reproductive investment to test whether oxidative stress increases with reproduction in mice. Each female's pups were cross-fostered to produce litters of either two or eight, representing low and high levels of reproductive investment for wild mice. No differences were observed between reproductive groups at peak lactation for several markers of oxidative stress in the heart and gastrocnemius muscle. Surprisingly, oxidative damage to proteins was lower in the livers of females with a litter size of eight than in females with two pups or non-reproductive control females. While protein oxidation decreased, activity levels of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase increased in the liver, suggesting this may be one pathway used to protect against oxidative stress.

A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Most marine mammals are hypothesized to routinely dive within their aerobic dive limit (ADL). Mammals that regularly perform deep, long-duration dives have locomotor muscles with elevated myoglobin concentrations that are composed of predominantly large, slow-twitch (Type I) fibers with low mitochondrial volume densities (V-mt). These features contribute to extending ADL by increasing oxygen stores and decreasing metabolic rate. Recent tagging studies, however, have challenged the view that two groups of extreme deep-diving cetaceans dive within their ADLs. Beaked whales (including Ziphius cavirostris and Mesoplodon densirostris) routinely perform the deepest and longest average dives of any air-breathing vertebrate, and short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus) perform high-speed sprints at depth. We investigated the locomotor muscle morphology and estimated total body oxygen stores of several species within these two groups of cetaceans to determine whether they (1) shared muscle design features with other deep divers and (2) performed dives within their calculated ADLs. Muscle of both cetaceans displayed high myoglobin concentrations and large fibers, as predicted, but novel fiber profiles for diving mammals. Beaked whales possessed a sprinter's fiber-type profile, composed of similar to 80\% fast-twitch (Type II) fibers with low V-mt. Approximately one-third of the muscle fibers of short-finned pilot whales were slow-twitch, oxidative, glycolytic fibers, a rare fiber type for any mammal. The muscle morphology of beaked whales likely decreases the energetic cost of diving, while that of short-finned pilot whales supports high activity events. Calculated ADLs indicate that, at low metabolic rates, both beaked and short-finned pilot whales carry sufficient onboard oxygen to aerobically support their dives.",2013,10.1242/jeb.081323,216,10,1862-1871,NA,aerobic dive limit; muscle morphology; fiber type; cetacean; beaked whale; short-finned pilot whale; myoglobin
article,Serotonin mediates stress-like effects on responses to non-nociceptive stimuli in the medicinal leech Hirudo verbana,"Mack, Danielle and Yevugah, Andrew and Renner, Kenneth and Burrell, Brian D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Noxious stimuli can elicit stress in animals that produce a variety of adaptations including changes in responses to nociceptive and non-nociceptive sensory input. One example is stress-induced analgesia that may be mediated, in part, by the endocannabinoid system. However, endocannabinoids can also have pro-nociceptive effects. In this study, the effects of electroshock, one experimental approach for producing acute stress, were examined on responses to non-nociceptive mechanical stimuli and nociceptive thermal stimuli in the medicinal leech (Hirudo verbana). The electroshock stimuli did not alter the leeches' responses to nociceptive stimuli, but did cause sensitization to non-nociceptive stimuli, characterized by a reduction in response threshold. These experiments were repeated with drugs that either blocked synthesis of the endocannabinoid transmitter 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) or transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) channel, which is known to act as an endocannabinoid receptor. Surprisingly, neither treatment had any effect on responses following electroshock. However, the electroshock stimuli reliably increased serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5HT) levels in the H. verbana CNS. Injection of 5HT mimicked the effects of the electroshocks, sensitizing responses to non-nociceptive stimuli and having no effect on responses to nociceptive stimuli. Injections of the 5HT receptor antagonist methysergide reduced the sensitization effect to non-nociceptive stimuli after electroshock treatment. These results indicate that electroshocks enhance response to non-nociceptive stimuli but do not alter responses to nociceptive stimuli. Furthermore, while 5HTappearstoplayacritical role in this shock-induced sensitizing effect, the endocannabinoid system seems to have no effect.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243404,225,11,NA,jeb243404,Serotonin; Sensitization; Nociception; Endocannabinoid; Stress; Hirudo verbana

Egg formation is best understood in the anautogenous mosquito Aedes aegypti, where insulin-like peptides (ILPs), ovary ecdysteroidogenic hormone (OEH) and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) interact to regulate gonadotrophic cycles. Circulating hemocytes also approximately double in abundance in conjunction with a gonadotrophic cycle, but the factors responsible for stimulating this increase remain unclear. Focusing on Ae. aegypti, we determined that hemocyte abundance similarly increased in intact blood-fed females and decapitated blood-fed females that were injected with ILP3, whereas OEH, 20E or heat-killed bacteria had no stimulatory activity. ILP3 upregulated insulin-insulin growth factor signaling in hemocytes, but few genes - including almost no transcripts for immune factors -were differentially expressed. ILP3 also stimulated circulating hemocytes to increase in two other anautogenous (Anopheles gambiae and Culex quinquefasciatus) and two facultatively autogenous mosquitoes (Aedes atropalpus and Culex pipiens molestus), but had no stimulatory activity in the obligately autogenous mosquito Toxorhynchites amboinensis. Altogether, our results identify ILPs as the primary regulators of hemocyte proliferation in association with egg formation, but also suggest this response has been lost in the evolution of obligate autogeny.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243460,225,5,NA,jeb243460,Neuropeptide; Insulin-like peptides; Ecdysone; Anautogeny; Autogeny; Immunity
article,"Acoustic deterrents influence foraging activity, flight and echolocation behaviour of free-flying bats","Gilmour, V, Lia R. and Holderied, Marc W. and Pickering, Simon P. C. and Jones, Gareth",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Acoustic deterrents have shown potential as a viable mitigation measure to reduce human impacts on bats; however, the mechanisms underpinning acoustic deterrence of bats have yet to be explored. Bats avoid ambient ultrasound in their environment and alter their echolocation calls in response to masking noise. Using stereo thermal videogrammetry and acoustic methods, we tested predictions that: (i) bats would avoid acoustic deterrents and forage and social call less in a `treated airspace'; (ii) deterrents would cause bats to fly with more direct flight paths akin to commuting behaviour and in line with a reduction in foraging activity, resulting in increased flight speed and decreased flight tortuosity; and (iii) bats would alter their echolocation call structure in response to the masking deterrent sound. As predicted, overall bat activity was reduced by 30\% and we recorded a significant reduction in counts of Pipistrellus pygmaeus (27\%), Myotis spp. (probably M. daubentonii) (26\%), and Nyctalus spp. and Eptesicus spp. (68\%) passes. Pipistrellus pygmaeus feeding buzzes were also reduced by the deterrent in relation to general activity (by 38\%); however, social calls were not (only 23\% reduction). Bats also increased their flight speed and reduced the tortuosity of their flight paths, and P. pygmaeus reduced echolocation call bandwidth and start frequency of calls in response to deterrent playback, probably owing to the masking effect of the sound. Deterrence could therefore be used to remove bats from areas where they forage, for example wind turbines and roads, where they may be under threat from direct mortality.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242715,224,20,NA,jeb242715,Thermal imaging; Videogrammetry; Ultrasound; Chiroptera; Flight-path tracking

To determine if this state is reversible in a non-food caching species, we fed hibernating grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) dextrose for 10 days to replace 53\% or 100\% of the estimated minimum daily energetic cost of hibernation. Feeding caused serum concentrations of glycerol and ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate) to return to active season levels irrespective of the amount of glucose fed. By contrast, free fatty acids (FFAs) and indices of metabolic rate, such as general activity, heart rate, strength of heart rate circadian rhythm, and insulin sensitivity were restored to approximately 50\% of active season levels. Body temperature was unaffected by feeding. To determine the contribution of adipose to the metabolic effects observed after glucose feeding, we cultured bear adipocytes collected at the beginning and end of the feeding and performed metabolic flux analysis. We found a similar to 33\% increase in energy metabolism after feeding. Moreover, basal metabolism before feeding was 40\% lower in hibernation cells compared with fed cells or active cells cultured at 37 degrees C, thereby confirming the temperature independence of metabolic rate. The partial depression of circulating FFAs with feeding likely explains the incomplete restoration of insulin sensitivity and other metabolic parameters in hibernating bears. Further depression of metabolic function is likely to be an active process. Together, the results provide a highly controlled model to examine the relationship between nutrient availability and metabolism on the hibernation phenotype in bears.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242560,224,12,NA,jeb242560,Bear; Hibernation; Metabolism; Circadian rhythm; Cell culture; Adipocyte
article,Analysis of why sea turtles swim slowly: a metabolic and mechanical approach,"Kinoshita, Chihiro and Fukuoka, Takuya and Narazaki, Tomoko and Niizuma, Yasuaki and Sato, Katsufumi",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Animals with high resting metabolic rates and low drag coefficients typically have fast optimal swim speeds in order to minimise energy costs per unit travel distance. The cruising swim speeds of sea turtles (0.5-0.6 m s(-1)) are slower than those of seabirds and marine mammals (1-2 m s(-1)). This study measured the resting metabolic rates and drag coefficients of sea turtles to answer two questions: (1) do turtles swim at the optimal swim speed?; and (2) what factors control the optimal swim speed of turtles? The resting metabolic rates of 13 loggerhead and 12 green turtles were measured; then, the cruising swim speeds of 15 loggerhead and 9 green turtles were measured and their drag coefficients were estimated under natural conditions. The measured cruising swim speeds (0.27-0.50 m s(-1)) agreed with predicted optimal swim speeds (0.19-0.32 m s(-1)). The resting metabolic rates of turtles were approximately one-twentieth those of penguins, and the products of the drag coefficient and frontal area of turtles were 8.6 times higher than those of penguins. Therefore, our results suggest that both low resting metabolic rate and high drag coefficient of turtles determine their slow cruising speed.",2021,10.1242/jeb.236216,224,4,NA,jeb236216,Optimal swim speed; Cost of transport; Metabolic rate; Drag coefficient; Stroke frequency; Loggerhead turtle; Green turtle

The energetic costs of these functions are important components in the energy budget during locomotion. We investigated how the pattern of stimulation and movement affects the mechanics and energetics of muscle fibre bundles isolated from wild rabbits (Otyctolagus cuniculus). The fibres were from muscles consisting of mainly fast-twitch, type 2 fibres. Fibre length was held constant (isometric) or a sinusoidal pattern of movement was imposed at a frequency similar to the stride frequency of running wild rabbits. Duty cycle (stimulation duration x movement frequency) and phase (timing of stimulation relative to movement) were varied. Work and impulse were measured as well as energy produced as heat. The sum of net work (work output-work input) and heat was taken as a measure of energetic cost. Maximum work output was produced with a long duty cycle and stimulation starting slightly before shortening, and was produced quite efficiently. However, efficiency was even higher with other stimulation patterns that produced less work. The highest impulse (considerably higher than isometric impulse) was produced when stimulation started while the muscle fibres were being lengthened. High impulse was produced very economically because of the low cost of producing force during lengthening. Thus, locomotion demanding high work, high impulse or economical work output or impulse requires a distinct pattern of stimulation and movement.",2019,10.1242/jeb.203877,222,13,NA,jeb203877,Energy; Heat; Cost of transport; Performance; Rabbit
article,Swimming strategies and energetics of endothermic white sharks during foraging,"Watanabe, Yuuki Y. and Payne, Nicholas L. and Semmens, Jayson M. and Fox, Andrew and Huveneers, Charlie",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Some fishes and sea turtles are distinct from ectotherms by having elevated core body temperatures and metabolic rates. Quantifying the energetics and activity of the regionally endothermic species will help us understand how a fundamental biophysical process (i.e. temperature-dependent metabolism) shapes animal ecology; however, such information is limited owing to difficulties in studying these large, highly active animals. White sharks, Carcharodon carcharias, are the largest fish with regional endothermy, and potentially among the most energy-demanding fishes. Here, we deployed multi-sensor loggers on eight white sharks aggregating near colonies of long-nosed fur seals, Arctocephalus forsteri, off the Neptune Islands, Australia. Simultaneous measurements of depth, swim speed (a proxy for swimming metabolic rate) and body acceleration (indicating when sharks exhibited energy-efficient gliding behaviour) revealed their fine-scale swimming behaviour and allowed us to estimate their energy expenditure. Sharks repeatedly dived (mean swimming depth, 29 m) and swam at the surface between deep dives (maximum depth, 108 m). Modal swim speeds (0.80-1.35 ms(-1)) were slower than the estimated speeds that minimize cost of transport (1.3-1.9 ms(-1)), a pattern analogous to a `sit-and-wait' strategy for a perpetually swimming species. All but one shark employed unpowered gliding during descents, rendering deep (>50 m) dives 29\% less costly than surface swimming, which may incur additional wave drag. We suggest that these behavioural strategies may help sharks to maximize net energy gains by reducing swimming cost while increasing encounter rates with fast-swimming seals.",2019,10.1242/jeb.185603,222,4,NA,jeb185603,Biologging; Swim speed; Cost of transport; Optimal behaviour

Telomere length predicts individual lifespan and in this study we investigated whether embryonic growth rate, manipulated using incubation temperature, affects erythrocyte telomere length in a wild bird species, the common tern (Sterna hirundo). A 1 degrees C lower incubation temperature decreased growth rate by 5\%, without affecting size at hatching. The slower growth was associated with an average telomere length that was 147 base pairs longer at hatching. If carried through to adulthood, this effect would correspond with an approximately 3 year longer lifespan. Our results thus suggest that an effect of growth rate on lifespan may be mediated by telomere dynamics or a physiological process reflected by telomere length.",2018,10.1242/jeb.181586,221,15,NA,jeb181586,Ageing; Embryonic development; Cell division; Life-history trade-off; Lifespan; Senescence

HOXA5, which is expressed in the mesenchyme of the trachea, lung and diaphragm, and in phrenic motor neurons, is a key transcription factor regulating lung development and function. Consequently, most Hoxa5(-/-) mutants die at birth from respiratory failure. However, the extensive effect of the null mutation makes it difficult to identify the origins of respiratory dysfunction in newborns. To address the physiological impact of Hoxa5 tissue-specific roles, we used conditional gene targeting with the Dermo1(Cre) and Olig2(Cre) mouse lines to produce specific Hoxa5 deletions in the mesenchyme and motor neurons, respectively. Hoxa5 expression in the mesenchyme is critical for trachea development, whereas its expression in phrenic motor neurons is essential for diaphragm formation. Breathing measurements in adult mice with whole-body plethysmography demonstrated that, at rest, only the motor neuron deletion affects respiration, resulting in higher breathing frequency and decreased tidal volume. But subsequent exposure to a moderate hypoxic challenge (F-IO2 = 0.12; 10 min) revealed that both mutant mice hyperventilate more than controls. Hoxa5(flox/flox);Dermo(1+/Cre) mice showed augmented tidal volume while Hoxa(5flox/flox);Olig(2+/Cre) mice had the largest increase in breathing frequency. No significant differences were observed between medulla-spinal cord preparations from E18.5 control and Hoxa(5flox/flox);Olig(2+/Cre) mouse embryos that could support a role for Hoxa5 in fetal inspiratory motor command. According to our data, Hoxa5 expression in the mesenchyme and phrenic motor neurons controls distinct aspects of respiratory development.",2017,10.1242/jeb.165084,220,24,4571-4577,NA,Transcription factor; Respiration; Mutant mouse models; Diaphragm
article,Metabolic cost of human hopping,"Gutmann, Anne K. and Bertram, John E. A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"To interpret the movement strategies employed in locomotion, it is necessary to understand the source of metabolic cost. Muscles must consume metabolic energy to do work, but also must consume energy to generate force. The energy lost during steady locomotion and, hence, the amount of mechanical work muscles need to perform to replace it can be reduced and, in theory, even eliminated by elastically storing and returning some portion of this energy via the tendons. However, even if muscles do not need to perform any mechanical work, they still must generate sufficient force to tension tendons and support body weight. This study shows that the metabolic cost per hop of human hopping can largely be explained by the cost of producing force over the duration of a hop. Metabolic cost determined via oxygen consumption is compared with theoretical predictions made using a number of different cost functions that include terms for average muscle work, force, force rate and impulse (time integral of muscle force). Muscle impulse alone predicts metabolic cost per hop as well as more complex functions that include terms for muscle work, force and force rate, and explains a large portion (92\%) of the variation in metabolic cost per hop. This is equivalent to 1/effective mechanical advantage, explaining a large portion (66\%) of the variation in metabolic cost per time per unit body weight. This result contrasts with studies that suggest that muscle force rate or muscle force rate per time determines the metabolic cost per time of force production in other bouncing gaits such as running.",2017,10.1242/jeb.150284,220,9,1654-1662,NA,Energetics; Biomechanics; Work; Force; Impulse; Locomotion

E. and Nilsen, Tom O. and Flik, Gert and Gorissen, Marnix",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Combinations of stressors occur regularly throughout an animal's life, especially in agriculture and aquaculture settings. If an animal fails to acclimate to these stressors, stress becomes chronic, and a condition of allostatic overload arises with negative results for animal welfare. In the current study, we describe effects of exposing Atlantic salmon parr to an unpredictable chronic stressor (UCS) paradigm for 3 weeks. The paradigm involves exposure of fish to seven unpredictable stressors three times a day. At the end of the trial, experimental and control fish were challenged with yet another novel stressor and sampled before and 1 h after that challenge. Plasma cortisol decreased steadily over time in stressed fish, indicative of exhaustion of the endocrine stress axis. This was confirmed by a lower cortisol response to the novel stressor at the end of the stress period in chronically stressed fish compared with the control group. In the preoptic area (POA) and pituitary gland, chronic stress resulted in decreased gene expression of 11 beta hsd2, gr1 and gr2 in the POA and increased expression of those genes in the pituitary gland. POA crf expression and pituitary expression of pomcs and mr increased, whereas interrenal gene expression was unaffected. Exposure to the novel stressor had no effect on POA and interrenal gene expression. In the pituitary, crfr1, pomcs, 11 beta hsd2, grs and mr were downregulated.

However, interspecific comparisons of reproductive mode are confounded by numerous other inherent differences among the species. Therefore, we compared oxygen consumption, as a reflection of energy costs, during reproduction in oviparous and viviparous females of the reproductively bimodal lizard Zootoca vivipara (Jaquin 1787). Female oxygen consumption progressively increased over the course of reproduction, peaking just prior to parition when it was 46\% (oviparous form) and 82\% (viviparous form) higher than it was at the pre-reproductive stage. Total increase in oxygen consumption (TIOC) during the pre-ovulation period was not different between the reproductive modes. Conversely, post-ovulation TIOC was more than three times higher in viviparous females, reflecting a dramatic increase in embryonic metabolism as well as maternal metabolic costs of pregnancy (MCP). MCP accounted for 22\% of total metabolism in viviparous females, whereas it was negligible in oviparous females. Our results demonstrate that egg retention through the first third of development, as is typical of most oviparous squamates, entails minimal maternal energy demand, while extending retention imposes much greater metabolic constraints. Selection for transition from oviparity to viviparity must therefore provide benefits that outweigh not only the added burden associated with prolonged embryonic retention, but also the substantial additional energy costs that are incurred.",2014,10.1242/jeb.104315,217,22,4049-4056,NA,Reproduction; Oviparity; Viviparity; Squamate; Metabolic cost; Evolution

Two loss-of-function mutant alleles in this gene region, low pyridoxal oxidase (Po-lpo) and aldehyde oxidase-1 (Aldox-1(n1)) are associated with a phenotype characterized by undetectable AOX enzymatic activity. However, the genes involved and the corresponding mutations have not yet been identified. In this study we characterized the activities, substrate specificities and expression profiles of the four AOX enzymes in D. melanogaster. We show that the Po-lpo-associated phenotype is the consequence of a structural alteration of the AOX1 gene. We identified an 11-bp deletion in the Po-lpo allele, resulting in a frame-shift event, which removes the molybdenum cofactor domain of the encoded enzyme. Furthermore, we show that AOX2 activity is detectable only during metamorphosis and characterize a Minos-AOX2 insertion in this developmental gene that disrupts its activity. We demonstrate that the Aldox-1(n1) phenotype maps to the AOX3 gene and AOX4 activity is not detectable in our assays.",2014,10.1242/jeb.102129,217,12,2201-2211,NA,Aldehyde oxidase; Molybdoenzymes; Drosophila melanogaster; Gene duplication; Substrate specificities

Mound builders (Aves: Megapodiidae) are unique among birds in that they produce heat for developing embryos not by sitting on eggs but by burying them in carefully tended mounds of soil and microbially decomposing vegetation. The low infection rate of eggs of one species in particular, the Australian brush-turkey (Alectura lathami), suggests that they possess strong defensive mechanisms. To identify some of these mechanisms, we first quantified antimicrobial albumen proteins and characterized eggshell structure, finding that albumen was not unusually antimicrobial, but that eggshell cuticle was composed of nanometer-sized calcite spheres. Experimental tests revealed that these modified eggshells were significantly more hydrophobic and better at preventing bacterial attachment and penetration into the egg contents than chicken eggs.

While variation in baseline values of individual immune parameters is well established, studies in wild animals on multiple parameters during an immune response are lacking. It also remains to be tested whether and how immune responses correlate with baseline values that vary, for example, over the course of an annual cycle. We studied immunological responses to an endotoxin challenge in skylarks (Alauda arvensis), a partial migrant bird breeding in temperate zones. We compared birds injected with the endotoxin LPS with un-injected controls, characterizing immunological responses with leukocyte profiles, titres of lytic enzymes and natural antibodies, and concentrations of haptoglobin and heat shock proteins. We did this in five annual-cycle stages to test whether the response varied throughout the year. The endotoxin challenge affected six of 10 measured parameters. Lysis titres and proportions of heterophils increased; haptoglobin concentrations and proportions of lymphocytes, basophils and eosinophils decreased. The variable effects on different immune components demonstrate the complexity of an immune response. We found no evidence that the response differed between annual-cycle stages. The response was independent of baseline measures taken directly upon capture in the field, indicating that birds were facing no immunological ceiling when mounting an immune response. Values of five parameters collected under field conditions were significantly related to values taken under standardized laboratory conditions. We conclude that multiple parts of the immune system are modulated during an immunological response and that responses are not re-organized throughout the annual cycle.",2013,10.1242/jeb.083147,216,14,2573-2580,NA,inflammation; ecological immunology; acute phase response; lipopolysaccharide; LPS; annual cycle; birds
article,Neither male gonadal androgens nor female reproductive costs drive development of sexual size dimorphism in lizards,"Starostova, Zuzana and Kubicka, Lukas and Golinski, Alison and Kratochvil, Lukas",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) is an extensively studied phenomenon in animals, including reptiles, but the proximate mechanism of its development is poorly understood. The most pervasive candidates are: (1) androgen-mediated control of growth, i.e. a positive effect of gonadal androgens (testosterone) on male growth in male-larger species, and a negative effect in female-larger species; and (2) sex-specific differences in energy allocation to growth, e.g. sex with larger reproductive costs should result in smaller body size. We tested these hypotheses in adults of the male-larger lizard Paroedura picta by conducting castrations with and without testosterone implants in males and manipulating reproductive status in females. Castration or testosterone replacement had no significant effect on final body length in males. High investment to reproduction had no significant effect on final body length in intact females. Interestingly, ovariectomized females and females with testosterone implants grew to larger body size than intact females. We did not find support for either of the above hypotheses and suggest that previously reported effects of gonadal androgens on growth in male lizards could be a consequence of altered behaviour or social status in manipulated individuals. Exogenous testosterone in females led to decreased size of ovaries; its effect on body size may be caused by interference with normal ovarian function. We suggest that ovarian factors, perhaps estrogens, not reproductive costs, can modify growth in female lizards and may thus contribute to the development of SSD. This hypothesis is largely supported by published results on the effect of testosterone treatment or ovariectomy on body size in female squamates.",2013,10.1242/jeb.079442,216,10,1872-1880,NA,gecko; growth; life history; phenotypic plasticity; reproductive investment; trade-off

Lake char are also attracted to juvenile odour but have lost the anadromous phenotype and spawn on nearshore reefs, where juvenile odour does not persist long enough to act as a cue for spawning site selection by adults. Previous behavioural data raised the possibility that males release a pheromone that includes components of juvenile odour. Using metabolomics, we found that the most abundant molecule released by males was also released by juveniles but not females. Tandem mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance were used to identify the molecule as taurocholic acid (TCA), which was previously implicated as a component of juvenile odour. Additional chemical analyses revealed that males release TCA at high rates via their urine during the spawning season. Finally, picomolar concentrations of TCA attracted pre-spawning and spawning females but not males. Taken together, our results indicate that male lake char release TCA as a mating pheromone and support the hypothesis that the pheromone is a partial match of juvenile odour.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246801,227,2,NA,jeb246801,"Receiver bias,; Communication; Chemical signal; Sensory trap"
article,Hungry or angry? Experimental evidence for the effects of food availability on two measures of stress in developing wild raptor nestlings,"Catitti, Benedetta and Grueebler, Martin U. and Kormann, Urs G. and Scherler, Patrick and Witczak, Stephanie and van Bergen, Valentijn S. and Jenni-Eiermann, Susanne",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Food shortage challenges the development of nestlings; yet, to cope with this stressor, nestlings can induce stress responses to adjust metabolism or behaviour. Food shortage also enhances the antagonism between siblings, but it remains unclear whether the stress response induced by food shortage operates via the individual nutritional state or via the social environment experienced. In addition, the understanding of these processes is hindered by the fact that effects of food availability often co-vary with other environmental factors. We used a food supplementation experiment to test the effect of food availability on two complementary stress measures, feather corticosterone (CORTf) and heterophil/lymphocyte ratio (H/L) in developing red kite (Mi/vus milvus) nestlings, a species with competitive brood hierarchy. By statistically controlling for the effect of food supplementation on the nestlings' body condition, we disentangled the effects of food and ambient temperature on nestlings during development. Experimental food supplementation increased body condition, and both CORTf and H/L were reduced in nestlings of high body condition. Additionally, CORTf decreased with age in non-supplemented nestlings. H/L decreased with age in all nestlings and was lower in supplemented last-hatched nestlings compared with non-supplemented ones. Ambient temperature showed a negative effect on H/L. Our results indicate that food shortage increases the nestlings' stress levels through a reduced food intake affecting both their nutritional state and their social environment. Thus, food availability in conjunction with ambient temperature shapes between- and within-nest differences in stress load, which may have carry-over effects on behaviour and performance in further life-history stages.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244102,225,15,NA,jeb244102,Food supplementation; Development; Feather corticosterone; H/L ratio; Hatching rank

However, telomeres shorten during cell replication and at critically low lengths can reduce cell replicative potential, induce cell senescence and decrease fitness. Stress exposure, which elevates glucocorticoid hormone concentrations, can exacerbate telomere attrition. This phenomenon has been attributed to increased oxidative stress generated by glucocorticoids ('oxidative stress hypothesis'). We recently suggested that glucocorticoids could increase telomere attrition during stressful periods by reducing the resources available for telomere maintenance through changes in the metabolic machinery ('metabolic telomere attrition hypothesis'). Here, we tested whether experimental increases in glucocorticoid levels affected telomere length and mitochondrial function in wild great tit (Parus major) nestlings during the energy-demanding early growth period. We monitored resulting corticosterone (Cort) concentrations in plasma and red blood cells, telomere lengths and mitochondrial metabolism (metabolic rate, proton leak, oxidative phosphorylation, maximal mitochondrial capacity and mitochondrial inefficiency). We assessed oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolites as well as the total non-enzymatic antioxidant protection in plasma. Compared with control nestlings, Cort-nestlings had higher baseline corticosterone, shorter telomeres and higher mitochondrial metabolic rate. Importantly, Cort-nestlings showed increased mitochondrial proton leak, leading to a decreased ATP production efficiency. Treatment groups did not differ in oxidative damage or antioxidants. Hence, glucocorticoid-induced telomere attrition is associated with changes in mitochondrial metabolism, but not with ROS production. These findings support the hypothesis that shortening of telomere length during stressful periods is mediated by glucocorticoids through metabolic rearrangements.",2020,10.1242/jeb.222513,223,15,NA,jeb222513,Mitochondria; Metabolism; Proton leak; Oxidative stress; Telomere; Nr3c1; Glucocorticoid receptor

Adipose tissue is important in the context of diving because nitrogen gas (N-2) is five times more soluble in fat than in blood, creating a potential N-2 sink in diving animals. Previous research demonstrates that unusual lipid composition {[}waxes and short-chained fatty acids (FA)] in adipose tissue of some whales leads to increased N-2 solubility. We evaluated the N-2 solubility of adipose tissue from 12 species of diving tetrapods lacking these unusual lipids to explore whether solubility in this tissue can be linked to lipid structure. Across all taxonomic groups, the same eight FA accounted for 70-80\% of the entire lipid profile; almost all adipose tissues were dominated by monounsaturated FA (40.2-67.4 mol\%). However, even with consistent FA profiles, there was considerable variability in N2 solubility, ranging from 0.051 +/- 0.003 to 0.073 +/- 0.004 ml N-2 ml(-1) oil. Interestingly, differences in N-2 solubility could not be attributed to taxonomic group (P=0.06) or FA composition (P>0.10). These results lead to two main conclusions: (1) in triacylglycerol-only adipose tissues, the FA pool itself may not have a strong influence on N-2 solubility; and (2) samples with similar FA profiles can have different N-2 solubility values, suggesting that 3D arrangement of individual FA within a triacylglycerol molecule may have important roles in determining N-2 solubility.",2020,10.1242/jeb.216770,223,5,NA,jeb216770,N-2 solubility; Adipose tissue; Diving tetrapods; Decompression sickness; Diving physiology
article,A tale of two genes: divergent evolutionary fate of haptoglobin and hemopexin in hemoglobinless Antarctic icefishes,"Bilyk, Kevin T. and Zhuang, Xuan and Murphy, Katherine R. and Cheng, C-H Christina",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The evolution of Antarctic notothenioid fishes in the isolated freezing Southern Ocean has led to remarkable trait gains and losses. One of the most extraordinary was the loss of the major oxygen carrier hemoglobin (Hb) in the icefishes (family Channichthyidae). Although the mechanisms of this loss and the resulting compensatory changes have been well studied, the impact of Hb loss on the network of genes that once supported its recycling and disposal has remained unexplored. Here, we report the functional fate and underlying molecular changes of two such key Hb-supporting proteins across the icefish family - haptoglobin (Hp) and hemopexin (Hx), crucial in removing cytotoxic free Hb and heme, respectively. Hp plays a critical role in binding free Hb for intracellular recycling and absent its primary client, icefish Hp transcription is now vanishingly little, and translation into a functional protein is nearly silenced. Hp genotype degeneration has manifested in separate lineages of the icefish phylogeny with three distinct nonsense mutations and a deletion frame shift, as well as mutated polyadenylation signal sequences. Thus, Hb loss appears to have diminished selective constraint on Hp maintenance, resulting in its stochastic, co-evolutionary drift towards extinction. Hx binds free heme for iron recycling in hepatocytes. In contrast to Hp, Hx genotype integrity is preserved in the icefishes and transcription occurs at levels comparable to those in the red-blooded notothenioids. The persistence of Hx likely owes to continued selective pressure for its function from mitochondrial and non-Hb cellular hemoproteins.",2019,10.1242/jeb.188573,222,6,NA,jeb188573,Notothenioid; Channichthyidae; Relaxed selection
article,Digestive and locomotor capacity show opposing responses to changing food availability in an ambush predatory fish,"Fu, Shi-Jian and Peng, Jing and Killen, Shaun S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Metabolic rates vary widely within species, but little is known about how variation in the `floor' {[}i.e. standard metabolic rate (SMR) in ectotherms] and `ceiling' {[}maximum metabolic rate (MMR)] for an individual's aerobic scope (AS) are linked with digestive and locomotor function. Any links among metabolic traits and aspects of physiological performance may also be modulated by fluctuations in food availability. This study followed changes in SMR, MMR, and digestive and locomotor capacity in southern catfish (Silurus meridionalis) throughout 15 days of food deprivation and 15 days of refeeding. Individuals downregulated SMR during food deprivation and showed only a 10\% body mass decrease during this time. Whereas critical swim speed (U-crit) was robust to food deprivation, digestive function decreased after fasting with a reduced peak oxygen uptake during specific dynamic action (SDA) and prolonged SDA duration. During refeeding, individuals displayed rapid growth and digestive function recovered to pre-fasting levels. However, refed fish showed a lower U-crit than would be expected for their increased body length and in comparison to measures at the start of the study. Reduced swimming ability may be a consequence of compensatory growth: growth rate was negatively correlated with changes in U-crit during refeeding. Southern catfish downregulate digestive function to reduce energy expenditure during food deprivation, but regain digestive capacity during refeeding, potentially at the cost of decreased swimming performance. The plasticity of maintenance requirements suggests that SMR is a key fitness trait for in this ambush predator. Shifts in trait correlations with food availability suggest that the potential for correlated selection may depend on context.",2018,10.1242/jeb.173187,221,12,NA,jeb173187,Energy budget; Metabolic rate; Aerobic scope; Teleost fish; Plasticity
article,Lowering metabolic rate mitigates muscle atrophy in western fence lizards,"Balaban, Jordan and Azizi, Emanuel",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Extended periods of skeletal muscle disuse can cause a significant loss of contractile proteins, which compromises the ability to generate force, mechanical work or power, thus compromising locomotor performance. Several hibernating organisms can resist muscle atrophy despite months of inactivity. This resistance has been attributed to a reduction in body temperature and metabolic rate and activation of physiological pathways that counteract pathways of protein degradation. However, in these systems, such strategies are not mutually exclusive and the effects of these mechanisms can be difficult to separate. In this study, we used the western fence lizard, Sceloporus occidentalis, as an ectothermic model to determine whether a reduction in metabolic rate is sufficient to resist muscle atrophy. We induced atrophy through sciatic denervation of the gastrocnemius muscle and housed lizards at either 15 or 30 degrees C for 6-7 weeks. Following treatment, we used muscle ergometry to measure maximum isometric force, the force-velocity relationship and contractile dynamics in the gastrocnemius. This approach allowed us to relate changes in the size and morphology to functional metrics of contractile performance. A subset of samples was used to histologically determine muscle fiber types. At 30 degrees C, denervated muscles had a larger reduction in muscle mass, physiological cross-sectional area and maximum isometric force than at 15 degrees C. Maximum shortening velocity of the muscle decreased slightly in animals housed at 30 degrees C but did not change in those housed at 15 degrees C. Our results suggest that metabolic rate alone can influence the rate of muscle atrophy and that ectothermic vertebrates may have an intrinsic mechanism to resist muscle atrophy during seasonal periods of inactivity.",2017,10.1242/jeb.154294,220,15,2748-2756,NA,Sceloporus occidentalis; Ectotherm; Skeletal muscle; Hibernation; Temperature

Birds were anesthetized and mechanically ventilated in sternal recumbency with known tidal volumes and breathing frequencies. The work done by the ventilator was measured, and these values were applied to the combinations of tidal volumes and breathing frequencies used by the birds to breathe at rest. We found the respiratory system of high-altitude species to be of a similar size, but consistently more compliant than that of lowaltitude sister taxa, although this did not translate to a significantly reduced work of breathing. The metabolic cost of breathing was estimated to be between 1 and 3\% of basal metabolic rate, as low or lower than estimates for other groups of tetrapods.",2017,10.1242/jeb.151191,220,6,1079-1089,NA,Avian respiratory system; Compliance; Hypoxia; Pulmonary mechanics; Waterfowl; Work of breathing

In the crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus, the molar tooth, which is part of the mandibular exoskeleton, contains an unusual crystalline enamel-like apatite layer. As this layer resembles vertebrate enamel in composition and function, it offers an interesting example of convergent evolution. Unlike other parts of the crayfish exoskeleton, which is periodically shed and regenerated during the molt cycle, molar mineral deposition takes place during the pre-molt stage. The molar mineral composition transforms continuously from fluorapatite through amorphous calcium phosphate to amorphous calcium carbonate and is mounted on chitin. The process of crayfish molar formation is entirely extracellular and presumably controlled by proteins, lipids, polysaccharides, low-molecular weight molecules and calcium salts. We have identified a novel molar protein termed Cq-M15 from C. quadricarinatus and cloned its transcript from the molar-forming epithelium. Its transcript and differential expression were confirmed by a next-generation sequencing library. The predicted acidic pI of Cq-M15 suggests its possible involvement in mineral arrangement. Cq-M15 is expressed in several exoskeletal tissues at pre-molt and its silencing is lethal. Like other arthropod cuticular proteins, Cq-M15 possesses a chitin-binding Rebers-Riddiford domain, with a recombinant version of the protein found to bind chitin. Cq-M15 was also found to interact with calcium ions in a concentration-dependent manner. This latter property might make Cq-M15 useful for bone and dental regenerative efforts. We suggest that, in the molar tooth, this protein might be involved in calcium phosphate and/or carbonate precipitation.",2015,10.1242/jeb.123539,218,21,3487-3498,NA,Biomineralization; Crustacean; RNAi; Calcium; Hydroxyapatite; Chitin
article,Natural selection constrains personality and brain gene expression differences in Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>),"Thornqvist, Per-Ove and Hoglund, Erik and Winberg, Svante",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In stream-spawning salmonid fishes there is a considerable variation in the timing of when fry leave the spawning nests and establish a feeding territory. The timing of emergence from spawning nests appears to be related to behavioural and physiological traits, e.g. early emerging fish are bolder and more aggressive. In the present study, emerging Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) alevins were sorted into three fractions: early, intermediate and late emerging. At the parr stage, behaviour, stress responses, hindbrain monoaminergic activity and forebrain gene expression were explored in fish from the early and late emerging fractions (first and last 25\%). The results show that when subjected to confinement stress, fish from the late emerging fraction respond with a larger activation of the brain serotonergic system than fish from the early fraction. Similarly, in late emerging fish, stress resulted in elevated expression of mRNA coding for serotonin 1A receptors (5-HT1A), GABA-A receptor-associated protein and ependymin, effects not observed in fish from the early emerging fraction. Moreover, fish from the early emerging fraction displayed bolder behaviour than their late emerging littermates. Taken together, these results suggest that time of emergence, boldness and aggression are linked to each other, forming a behavioural syndrome in juvenile salmon. Differences in brain gene expression between early and late emerging salmon add further support to a relationship between stress coping style and timing of emergence. However, early and late emerging salmon do not appear to differ in hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis reactivity, another characteristic of divergent stress coping styles.",2015,10.1242/jeb.114314,218,7,1077-1083,NA,Animal personality; Behaviour; Boldness; Confinement stress; Hypoxia; Swim-up

In this study, we combined physiological studies with in vivo behavioral experiments to examine the presence of a putative TRPV-like receptor in the medicinal leech, building upon earlier studies in this lophotrochozoan invertebrate. The leech polymodal nociceptive neuron was activated by both peripheral and central application of the TRPV1-activator capsaicin in a concentration-dependent manner, with 100 mu moll(-1) being the lowest effective concentration. Responses to capsaicin were inhibited by the selective TRPV1 antagonist SB366791. The polymodal nociceptive neuron also responded to noxious thermal stimuli (>40 degrees C), and this response was also blocked by SB366791. Capsaicin sensitivity was selective to the polymodal nociceptor with no direct response being elicited in the mechanical nociceptive neuron or in the non-nociceptive touch-or pressure-sensitive neurons. Capsaicin also elicited nocifensive behavioral responses (withdrawals and locomotion) in a concentration-dependent manner, and these behavioral responses were significantly attenuated with SB366791. These results suggest the presence of a capsaicin-sensitive TRPV-like channel in the medicinal leech central nervous system and are relevant to the evolution of nociceptive signaling.",2014,10.1242/jeb.110049,217,23,4167-4173,NA,Leech; TRPV; Invertebrate; Nociception

Such active searching movements are more sinuous than travelling movements, and supposedly more costly in energy. Here we provide an empirical validation of this long-lasting assumption. To this end, we evaluated simultaneously energy expenditure and trajectory in northern gannets (Morus bassanus) using GPS loggers, dive recorders and three-dimensional accelerometers. Three behavioural states were determined from GPS data: foraging, when birds actively searched for prey (high tortuosity, medium speed); travelling, when birds were commuting (straight trajectory, high speed); and resting (straight trajectory, low speed). Overall dynamic body acceleration, calculated from acceleration data, was used as a proxy for energy expenditure during flight. The impact of windscape characteristics (wind force and direction) upon flight costs was also tested. Energy expenditure of northern gannets was higher during sinuous foraging flight than during more rectilinear travelling flight, demonstrating that turns are indeed costly. Yet wind force and direction also strongly shaped flight energy expenditure; within any behavioural state it was less costly to fly with the wind than against it, and less costly to fly with strong winds. Despite the major flight costs of wind action, birds did not fully optimize their flight track relative to wind direction, probably because of prey distributions relative to the coastline and wind predictability. Our study illustrates how both tortuosity and windscape shape the foraging costs of marine predators such as northern gannets.",2014,10.1242/jeb.097915,217,6,876-885,NA,Energetics; Accelerometry; State-space model; Foraging; Seabird; Wind

Many of the new data were obtained with running-wheel respirometers instead of the treadmill systems used in most previous measurements of mammalian (V) over dot(O2,max).

article,"Inflammatory challenge increases measures of oxidative stress in a free-ranging, long-lived mammal","Schneeberger, Karin and Czirjak, Gabor A. and Voigt, Christian C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Oxidative stress - the imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neutralising antioxidants - has been under debate as the main cause of ageing in aerobial organisms. The level of ROS should increase during infection as part of the activation of an immune response, leading to oxidative damage to proteins, lipids and DNA. Yet, it is unknown how long-lived organisms, especially mammals, cope with oxidative stress. Bats are known to carry a variety of zoonotic pathogens and at the same time are, despite their high mass-specific basal metabolic rate, unusually long lived, which may be partly the result of low oxidative damage of organs. Here, we asked whether an immune challenge causes oxidative stress in free-ranging bats, measuring two oxidative stress markers. We injected 20 short-tailed fruit bats (Carollia perspicillata) with bacterially derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and 20 individuals with phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) as a control. Individuals injected with LPS showed an immune reaction by increased white blood cell count after 24 h, whereas there was no significant change in leukocyte count in control animals. The biological antioxidant potential (BAP) remained the same in both groups, but reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs) increased after treatment with LPS, indicating a significant increase in oxidative stress in animals when mounting an immune reaction toward the inflammatory challenge. Control individuals did not show a change in oxidative stress markers. We conclude that in a long-lived mammal, even high concentrations of antioxidants do not immediately neutralise free radicals produced during a cellular immune response. Thus, fighting an infection may lead to oxidative stress in bats.",2013,10.1242/jeb.090837,216,24,4514-4519,NA,reactive oxygen metabolites; immune response; bat; antioxidants
article,The scaling of metabolic traits differs among larvae and juvenile colonies of scleractinian corals,"Bean, Nina K. and Edmunds, Peter J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Body size profoundly affects organism fitness and ecosystem dynamics through the scaling of physiological traits. This study tested for variation in metabolic scaling and its potential drivers among corals differing in life history strategies and taxonomic identity. Data were compiled from published sources and augmented with empirical measurements of corals in Moorea, French Polynesia. The data compilation revealed metabolic isometry in broadcasted larvae, but size -independent metabolism in brooded larvae; empirical measurements of Pocillopora acuta larvae also supported sizeindependent metabolism in brooded coral larvae. In contrast, for juvenile colonies (i.e. 1-4 cm diameter), metabolic scaling was isometric for Pocillopora spp., and negatively allometric for Porites spp. The scaling of biomass with surface area was isometric for Pocillopora spp., but positively allometric for Porites spp., suggesting the surface area to biomass ratio mediates metabolic scaling in these corals. The scaling of tissue biomass and metabolism were not affected by light treatment (i.e. either natural photoperiods or constant darkness) in either juvenile taxa. However, biomass was reduced by 9-15\% in the juvenile corals from the light treatments and this coincided with higher metabolic scaling exponents, thus supporting the causal role of biomass in driving variation in scaling. This study shows that metabolic scaling is plastic in early life stages of corals, with intrinsic differences between life history strategy (i.e. brooded and broadcasted larvae) and taxa (i.e. Pocillopora spp . and Porites spp . ), and acquired differences attributed to changes in areanormalized biomass.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246362,227,9,NA,jeb246362,Scleractinia; Respiration; Planula; Pocillopora; Porites; Metabolic scaling

This study was designed to (1) assess the collective behaviours of blow fly larvae (Diptera: Calliphoridae) in groups varying in density and species composition, and (2) relate them to the costs and benefits of aggregating on fresh or decomposed food. First, experiments testing conspecific groups of Lucilia sericata and Calliphora vicina larvae, two species feeding at the same time on fresh carcasses, demonstrated decreases in growth and survival on rotten beef liver compared with fresh liver. However, mixing species together reduced this adverse impact of decomposition by increasing the mass of emerged adults. Second, larval groups were observed in binary choice tests between fresh and rotten liver (i.e. optimal and sub-optimal food sources). The results showed that larvae interacted with each other and that these interactions influenced their food preferences. We observed that (1) larvae were able to collectively choose the optimal food, (2) their choice accuracy increased with larval density and (3) the presence of another species induced a reversal in larval preference towards rotten food. These results highlight the ubiquity of collective decision properties in gregarious insects.

Our findings illustrate that surfacing is accompanied by an increase in heart rate that is primarily due to beta-adrenergic stimulation.

In this Commentary, I discuss some key issues faced by the emerging field of oxidative stress ecology, and seek to provide interpretations and solutions. First, I show that the way in which we define oxidative stress has far-reaching implications for the interpretation of results, and that we need to distinguish between (1) a biochemical definition in terms of the molecular outcomes of oxidative stress (e.g. generation of oxidative damage) and (2) a biological definition in terms of the fitness consequences for the organism (e.g. effects on fertility). Second, I discuss the dangers of comparing different tissues and markers. Third, I highlight the need to pay more attention to the cross-talk between oxidative stress and other important physiological costs and functions; this will allow us to better understand the mechanistic basis of fitness costs. Fourth, I propose the `redox signalling hypothesis' of life history to complement the current `oxidative stress hypothesis' of life history. The latter states that oxidative damage underlies trade-offs because it affects traits like growth, reproduction or cell senescence. By contrast, the redox signalling hypothesis states that a trade-off between signalling and biochemical oxidative stress underlies the regulation of reactive oxygen species production and their subsequent control. Finally, I critically appraise our current knowledge of oxidative stress ecology, highlighting key research themes and providing an optimistic overview of future opportunities for the discipline to yield considerable insight into the ecological and evolutionary meaning of oxidative stress.",2019,10.1242/jeb.194688,222,13,NA,jeb194688,Antioxidants; Life history; Redox; Reproduction; Senescence; Signalling

Here, we identified mRNAs expressed in Lymnaea stagnalis central nervous system that encode two G-protein-coupled receptors (Lymnaea CBr-like 1 and 2) that structurally resemble mammalian cannabinoid receptors (CBrs). We found that injection of a mammalian CBr agonist WIN 55,212-2 (WIN 55) into the snail before operant conditioning obstructed learning and memory formation. This effect of WIN 55 injection persisted for at least 4 days following its injection. A similar obstruction of learning and memory occurred when a severe traumatic stimulus was delivered to L. stagnalis. In contrast, injection of a mammalian CBr antagonist AM 251 enhanced long-term memory formation in snails and reduced the duration of the effects of the severe traumatic stressor on learning and memory. Neither WIN 55 nor AM 251 altered normal homeostatic aerial respiratory behaviour elicited in hypoxic conditions. Our results suggest that putative cannabinoid receptors mediate stressful stimuli that alter learning and memory formation in Lymnaea. This is also the first demonstration that putative CBrs are present in Lymnaea and play a key role in learning and memory formation.",2017,10.1242/jeb.159038,220,17,3026-3038,NA,Aerial respiratory behaviour; Cannabinoid; Long-term memory; Lymnaea stagnalis; Operant conditioning
article,Diet-induced co-variation between architectural and physicochemical plasticity in an extended phenotype,"Blamires, Sean J. and Hasemore, Matthew and Martens, Penny J. and Kasumovic, Michael M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The adaptive benefits of extended phenotypic plasticity are imprecisely defined due to a paucity of experiments examining traits that are manipulable and measurable across environments. Spider webs are often used as models to explore the adaptive benefits of variations in extended phenotypes across environments. Nonetheless, our understanding of the adaptive nature of the plastic responses of spider webs is impeded when web architectures and silk physicochemical properties appear to co-vary. An opportunity to examine this co-variation is presented by modifying prey items while measuring web architectures and silk physiochemical properties. Here, we performed two experiments to assess the nature of the association between web architectures and gluey silk properties when the orb web spider Argiope keyserlingi was fed a diet that varied in either mass and energy or prey size and feeding frequency. We found web architectures and gluey silk physicochemical properties to co-vary across treatments in both experiments. Specifically, web capture area co-varied with gluey droplet morphometrics, thread stickiness and salt concentrations when prey mass and energy were manipulated, and spiral spacing co-varied with gluey silk salt concentrations when prey size and feeding frequency were manipulated. We explained our results as A. keyserlingi plastically shifting its foraging strategy as multiple prey parameters simultaneously varied. We confirmed and extended previous work by showing that spiders use a variety of prey cues to concurrently adjust web and silk traits across different feeding regimes.",2017,10.1242/jeb.150029,220,5,876-884,NA,Argiope keyserlingi; Extended phenotype; Gluey silk; Orb web architecture; Plasticity; Predatory trap; Silk properties; Stickiness
article,"Ontogeny of learning walks and the acquisition of landmark information in desert ants, <i>Cataglyphis fortis</i>","Fleischmann, Pauline N. and Christian, Marcelo and Mueller, Valentin L. and Roessler, Wolfgang and Wehner, Ruediger",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"At the beginning of their foraging lives, desert ants (Cataglyphis fortis) are for the first time exposed to the visual world within which they henceforth must accomplish their navigational tasks. Their habitat, North African salt pans, is barren, and the nest entrance, a tiny hole in the ground, is almost invisible. Although natural landmarks are scarce and the ants mainly depend on path integration for returning to the starting point, they can also learn and use landmarks successfully to navigate through their largely featureless habitat. Here, we studied how the ants acquire this information at the beginning of their outdoor lives within a nest-surrounding array of three artificial black cylinders. Individually marked `newcomers' exhibit a characteristic sequence of learning walks. The meandering learning walks covering all directions of the compass first occur only within a few centimeters of the nest entrance, but then increasingly widen, until after three to seven learning walks, foraging starts. When displaced to a distant test field in which an identical array of landmarks has been installed, the ants shift their search density peaks more closely to the fictive goal position, the more learning walks they have performed. These results suggest that learning of a visual landmark panorama around a goal is a gradual rather than an instantaneous process.",2016,10.1242/jeb.140459,219,19,3137-3145,NA,Landmark learning; Navigation; Experience-dependent behavior; Visual landmark; Central place forager; Path integration
article,<i>In vitro</i> evidence supports the presence of glucokinase-independent glucosensing mechanisms in hypothalamus and hindbrain of rainbow trout,"Otero-Rodino, Cristina and Velasco, Cristina and Alvarez-Otero, Rosa and Lopez-Patino, Marcos A. and Miguez, Jesus M. and Soengas, Jose L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"We previously obtained evidence in rainbow trout for the presence and response to changes in circulating levels of glucose (induced by intraperitoneal hypoglycaemic and hyperglycaemic treatments) of glucosensing mechanisms based on liver X receptor (LXR), mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to increased expression of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), and sweet taste receptor in the hypothalamus, and on sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT-1) in hindbrain. However, these effects of glucose might be indirect. Therefore, we evaluated the response of parameters related to these glucosensing mechanisms in a first experiment using pooled sections of hypothalamus and hindbrain incubated for 6 h at 15 degrees C in modified Hanks' medium containing 2, 4 or 8 mmol l(-1) D-glucose. The responses observed in some cases were consistent with glucosensing capacity. In a second experiment, pooled sections of hypothalamus and hindbrain were incubated for 6 h at 15 degrees C in modified Hanks' medium with 8 mmol l(-1) D-glucose alone (control) or containing 1 mmol l(-1) phloridzin (SGLT-1 antagonist), 20 mu mol l(-1) genipin (UCP2 inhibitor), 1 mu mol l(-1) trolox (ROS scavenger), 100 mu mol l(-1) bezafibrate (T1R3 inhibitor) and 50 mu mol l(-1) geranyl-geranyl pyrophosphate (LXR inhibitor). The response observed in the presence of these specific inhibitors/antagonists further supports the proposal that critical components of the different glucosensing mechanisms are functioning in rainbow trout hypothalamus and hindbrain.",2016,10.1242/jeb.137737,219,11,1750-1759,NA,Rainbow trout; Glucosensing; Hypothalamus; Hindbrain
