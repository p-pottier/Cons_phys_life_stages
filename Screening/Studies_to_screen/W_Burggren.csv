article,Independent effects of seawater pH and high <i>P</i><sub>CO2</sub> on olfactory sensitivity in fish: possible role of carbonic anhydrase,"Velez, Zelia and Costa, Rita A. and Wang, Wenjing and Hubbard, Peter C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Ocean acidificationmay alter olfactory-driven behaviour in fish by direct effects on the peripheral olfactory system; olfactory sensitivity is reduced in CO2-acidified seawater. The current study tested whether this is due to elevated P-CO2 or the consequent reduction in seawater pH and, if the former, the possible involvement of carbonic anhydrase, the enzyme responsible for the hydration of CO2 and production of carbonic acid. Olfactory sensitivity to amino acids was assessed by extracellularmulti-unit recording from the olfactory nerve of the gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata L.) in normal seawater (pH similar to 8.2), and after acute exposure to acidified seawater (pH similar to 7.7) but normal P-CO2 (similar to 340 mu atm) or to high P-CO2 seawater (similar to 1400 mu atm) at normal pH (similar to 8.2). Reduced pH in the absence of elevated P-CO2 caused a reduction in olfactory sensitivity to L-serine, L-leucine, L-arginine and L-glutamine, but not L-glutamic acid. Increased P-CO2 in the absence of changes in pH caused reduced olfactory sensitivity to L-serine, L-leucine and L-arginine, including increases in their threshold of detection, but had no effect on sensitivity to L-glutamine and L-glutamic acid. Inclusion of 1 mmol l(-1) acetazolamide (a membrane-permeant inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase) in the seawater reversed the inhibition of olfactory sensitivity to L-serine caused by high P-CO2. Ocean acidification may reduce olfactory sensitivity by reductions in seawater pH and intracellular pH (of olfactory receptor neurones); the former by reducing odorant-receptor affinity, and the latter by reducing the efficiency of olfactory transduction. The physiological role of carbonic anhydrase in the olfactory receptor neurones remains to be explored.",2021,10.1242/jeb.238485,224,6,NA,jeb238485,Ocean acidification; Olfaction; Amino acid; Odorant-receptor affinity; Olfactory receptor; Carbon dioxide
article,Aquatic insects in a multistress environment: cross-tolerance to salinity and desiccation,"Pallares, Susana and Botella-Cruz, Maria and Arribas, Paula and Millan, Andres and Velasco, Josefa",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Exposing organisms to a particular stressor may enhance tolerance to a subsequent stress, when protective mechanisms against the two stressors are shared. Such cross-tolerance is a common adaptive response in dynamic multivariate environments and often indicates potential co-evolution of stress traits. Many aquatic insects in inland saline waters from Mediterranean-climate regions are sequentially challenged with salinity and desiccation stress. Thus, cross-tolerance to these physiologically similar stressors could have been positively selected in insects of these regions. We used adults of the saline water beetles Enochrus jesusarribasi (Hydrophilidae) and Nebrioporus baeticus (Dytiscidae) to test cross-tolerance responses to desiccation and salinity. In independent laboratory experiments, we evaluated the effects of (i) salinity stress on the subsequent resistance to desiccation and (ii) desiccation stress (rapid and slow dehydration) on the subsequent tolerance to salinity. Survival, water loss and haemolymph osmolality were measured. Exposure to stressful salinity improved water control under subsequent desiccation stress in both species, with a clear cross-tolerance (enhanced performance) in N. baeticus. In contrast, general negative effects on performance were found under the inverse stress sequence. The rapid and slow dehydration produced different water loss and haemolymph osmolality dynamics that were reflected in different survival patterns. Our finding of cross-tolerance to salinity and desiccation in ecologically similar species from distant lineages, together with parallel responses between salinity and thermal stress previously found in several aquatic taxa, highlights the central role of adaption to salinity and co-occurring stressors in arid inland waters, having important implications for the species' persistence under climate change.",2017,10.1242/jeb.152108,220,7,1277-1286,NA,Inland waters; Beetles; Drought; Osmotic stress; Homeostasis; Water balance
article,"Impacts and mechanisms of CO<sub>2</sub> narcosis in bumble bees: narcosis depends on dose, caste and mating status and is not induced by anoxia","Cressman, Anna and Amsalem, Etya",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Carbon dioxide (CO2) is commonly used to immobilize insects and to induce reproduction in bees. However, despite its wide use and potential off-target impacts, its underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we used Bombus impatiens to examine whether CO2 impacts are mediated by anoxia and whether these mechanisms differ between female castes or following mating in queens. We examined the behavior, physiology and gene expression of workers, mated queens and virgin queens following exposure to anoxia, hypoxia, full and partial hypercapnia, and controls. Hypercapnia and anoxia caused immobilization, but only hypercapnia resulted in behavioral, physiological and molecular impacts in bees. Recovery from hypercapnia resulted in increased abdominal contractions and took longer in queens. Additionally, hypercapnia activated the ovaries of queens, but inhibited those of workers in a dose-dependent manner and caused a depletion of fat-body lipids in both castes. All responses to hypercapnia were weaker following mating in queens. Analysis of gene expression related to hypoxia and hypercapnia supported the physiological findings in queens, demonstrating that the overall impacts of CO2, excluding virgin queen ovaries, were unique and were not induced by anoxia. This study contributes to our understanding of the impacts and the mechanistic basis of CO2 narcosis in insects and its impacts on bee physiology.

article,Hypercapnia and low pH induce neuroepithelial cell proliferation and emersion behaviour in the amphibious fish <i>Kryptolebias marmoratus</i>,"Robertson, Cayleih E. and Turko, Andy J. and Jonz, Michael G. and Wright, Patricia A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Aquatic hypercapnia may have helped to drive ancestral vertebrate invasion of land. We tested the hypothesis that amphibious fishes sense and respond to elevated aquatic P-CO2 by behavioural avoidance mechanisms, and by morphological changes at the chemoreceptor level. Mangrove rivulus (Kryptolebias marmoratus) were exposed to 1 week of normocapnic control water (pH8), air, hypercapnia (5\% CO2, pH 6.8) or isocapnic acidosis (pH 6.8). We found that the density of CO2/H+ chemoreceptive neuroepithelial cells (NECs) was increased in hypercapnia or isocapnic acidosis-exposed fish. Projection area (a measure of cell size) was unchanged. Acute exposure to progressive hypercapnia induced the fish to emerse (leave water) at water pH values similar to 6.1, whereas addition of HCl to water caused a more variable response with a lower pH threshold (similar to pH 5.5). These results support our hypothesis and suggest that aquatic hypercapnia provides an adequate stimulus for extant amphibious fishes to temporarily transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitats.",2015,10.1242/jeb.123133,218,19,2987-2990,NA,P-CO2; Chemoreceptor; Phenotypic plasticity
article,Facultative hyperthermia during a heatwave delays injurious dehydration of an arboreal marsupial,"Turner, James M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Heatwaves negatively impact wildlife populations and their effects are predicted to worsen with ongoing global warming. Animal mass mortality at extremely high ambient temperature (Ta) is evidence for physiological dysfunction and, to aid conservation efforts, improving our understanding of animal responses to environmental heat is crucial. To address this, I measured the water loss, body temperature and metabolism of an Australian marsupial during a simulated heatwave. The body temperature of the common ringtail possum Pseudocheirus peregrinus increased passively by similar to 3 degrees C over a T-a of 29-39 degrees C, conveying water savings of 9.6 ml h(-1). When T-a crossed a threshold of 35-36 degrees C, possums began actively cooling by increasing evaporative water loss and thermal conductance. It is clear that facultative hyperthermia is effective up to a point, but once this point is surpassed - the frequency and duration of which are increasing with climate change - body water would rapidly deplete, placing possums in danger of injury or death from dehydration.",2020,10.1242/jeb.219378,223,5,NA,jeb219378,Water loss; Metabolism; Energetics; Thermal tolerance; Pseudocheiridae; Climate change
article,Flea fitness is reduced by high fractional concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> that simulate levels found in their hosts' burrows,"Downs, Cynthia J. and Pinshow, Berry and Khokhlova, Irina S. and Krasnov, Boris R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Nidicolous ectoparasites such as fleas and gamasid mites that feed on small and medium-sized mammals spend much of their time in their hosts' burrows, which provide an environment for living, and often feeding, to their pre-imaginal and/or adult stages. Thus, these ectoparasites should be adapted to environmental conditions in burrows, including high fractional concentrations of CO2 (F-CO2). We examined how a high F-CO2 (0.04) affected survival and reproductive success of a hematophagous ectoparasite of burrowing rodents using fleas Xenopsylla ramesis and Sundevall's jirds Meriones crassus. In the first experiment, fleas fed on hosts housed in high-CO2 (F-CO2 = 0.04) or atmospheric-CO2 (F-CO2 approximate to 0.0004) air, and were allowed to breed. In a second experiment, fleas were maintained in high CO2 or CO2-free air with no hosts to determine how CO2 levels affect survival and activity levels. We found that at high F-CO2 fleas laid fewer eggs, reducing reproductive success. In addition, at high F-CO2, activity levels and survival of fleas were reduced. Our results indicate that fleas do not perform well in the F-CO2 used in this experiment. Previous research indicated that the type and intensity of the effects of CO2 concentration on the fitness of an insect depend on the F-CO2 used, so we advise caution when generalizing inferences drawn to insects exposed to other F-CO2. If, however, F-CO2 found in natural mammal burrows brings about reduced fitness in fleas in general, then burrowing hosts may benefit from reduced parasite infestation if burrow air F-CO2 is high.",2015,10.1242/jeb.122812,218,22,3596-3603,NA,Development; Carbon dioxide; Ectoparasite; Life history; Reproductive success; Survival
article,"Gas exchange patterns and water loss rates in the Table Mountain cockroach, <i>Aptera fusca</i> (Blattodea: Blaberidae)","Groenewald, Berlize and Bazelet, Corinna S. and Potter, C. Paige and Terblanche, John S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The importance of metabolic rate and/or spiracle modulation for saving respiratory water is contentious. One major explanation for gas exchange pattern variation in terrestrial insects is to effect a respiratory water loss (RWL) saving. To test this, we measured the rates of CO2 and H2O release ((V) over dot(CO2) and (V) over dot(H2O), respectively) in a previously unstudied, mesic cockroach, Aptera fusca, and compared gas exchange and water loss parameters among the major gas exchange patterns (continuous, cyclic, discontinuous gas exchange) at a range of temperatures. Mean (V) over dot(CO2), (V) over dot(H2O) and (V) over dot(H2O) per unit (V) over dot(CO2) did not differ among the gas exchange patterns at all temperatures (P>0.09). There was no significant association between temperature and gas exchange pattern type (P=0.63). Percentage of RWL (relative to total water loss) was typically low (9.79 +/- 1.84\%) and did not differ significantly among gas exchange patterns at 15 degrees C (P=0.26). The method of estimation had a large impact on the percentage of RWL, and of the three techniques investigated (traditional, regression and hyperoxic switch), the traditional method generally performed best. In many respects, A. fusca has typical gas exchange for what might be expected from other insects studied to date (e.g. (V) over dot(CO2), (V) over dot(H2O), RWL and cuticular water loss). However, we found for A. fusca that (V) over dot(H2O) expressed as a function of metabolic rate was significantly higher than the expected consensus relationship for insects, suggesting it is under considerable pressure to save water. Despite this, we found no consistent evidence supporting the conclusion that transitions in pattern type yield reductions in RWL in this mesic cockroach.",2013,10.1242/jeb.091199,216,20,3844-3853,NA,water conservation; hyperoxic switch method; regression method; metabolic rates; metabolic efficiency
article,Disentangling environmental drivers of circadian metabolism in desert-adapted mice,"Colella, Jocelyn P. and Blumstein, Danielle M. and MacManes, Matthew D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Metabolism is a complex phenotype shaped by natural environmental rhythms, as well as behavioral, morphological and physiological adaptations. Metabolism has been historically studied under constant environmental conditions, but new methods of continuous metabolic phenotyping now offer a window into organismal responses to dynamic environments, and enable identification of abiotic controls and the timing of physiological responses relative to environmental change. We used indirect calorimetry to characterize metabolic phenotypes of the desert-adapted cactus mouse (Peromyscus eremicus) in response to variable environmental conditions that mimic their native environment versus those recorded under constant warm and constant cool conditions, with a constant photoperiod and full access to resources. We found significant sexual dimorphism, with males being more prone to dehydration than females. Under circadian environmental variation. most metabolic shifts occurred prior to physical environmental change and the timing was disrupted under both constant treatments. The ratio of CO2 produced to O-2 consumed (the respiratory quotient) reached greater than 1.0 only during the light phase under diurnally variable conditions, a pattern that strongly suggests that lipogenesis contributes to the production of energy and endogenous water. Our results are consistent with historical descriptions of circadian torpor in this species (torpid by day, active by night), but reject the hypothesis that torpor is initiated by food restriction or negative water balance.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242529,224,18,NA,jeb242529,Circadian torpor; Deer mice; Lipogenesis; Metabolism; Peromyscus; Physiology
article,Carbon dioxide and bicarbonate accumulation in caiman erythrocytes during diving,"Bautista, Naim M. and Damsgaard, Christian and Fago, Angela and Wang, Tobias",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The ability of crocodilian haemoglobins to bind HCO3- has been appreciated for more than half a century, but the functional implication of this exceptional mechanism has not previously been assessed in vivo. Therefore, the goal of the present study was to address the hypothesis that CO2 primarily binds to haemoglobin, rather than being accumulated in plasma as in other vertebrates, during diving in caimans. Here, we demonstrate that CO2 primarily accumulates within the erythrocyte during diving and that most of the accumulated CO2 is bound to haemoglobin. Furthermore, we show that this HCO3- binding is tightly associated with the progressive blood deoxygenation during diving; therefore, crocodilians differ from the classic vertebrate pattern, where HCO3- accumulates in the plasma upon excretion from the erythrocytes by the Cl-/HCO3- exchanger.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242435,224,9,NA,jeb242435,Blood gases; pH; Blood-oxygen affinity; Haemoglobin-bicarbonate binding; Reptile

In the present study, we show that future predictions of ocean warming (+4 degrees C) and acidification (Delta pH=0.5 units) may compromise the development of early life stages of a highly commercial teleost fish, Solea senegalensis. Exposure to future conditions caused a decline in hatching success and larval survival. Growth, metabolic rates and thermal tolerance increased with temperature but decreased under acidified conditions. Hypercapnia and warming amplified the incidence of deformities by 31.5\% (including severe deformities such as lordosis, scoliosis and kyphosis), while promoting the occurrence of oversized otoliths (109.3\% increase). Smaller larvae with greater skeletal deformities and larger otoliths may face major ecophysiological challenges, which might potentiate substantial declines in adult fish populations, putting in jeopardy the species' fitness under a changing ocean.",2014,10.1242/jeb.092635,217,12,2062-2070,NA,Ocean warming; Acidification; Fish larvae; Ecophysiology; Skeletal deformities
article,Temperature and acidification variability reduce physiological performance in the intertidal zone porcelain crab <i>Petrolisthes cinctipes</i>,"Paganini, Adam W. and Miller, Nathan A. and Stillman, Jonathon H.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"We show here that increased variability of temperature and pH synergistically negatively affects the energetics of intertidal zone crabs. Under future climate scenarios, coastal ecosystems are projected to have increased extremes of low tide-associated thermal stress and ocean acidification-associated low pH, the individual or interactive effects of which have yet to be determined. To characterize energetic consequences of exposure to increased variability of pH and temperature, we exposed porcelain crabs, Petrolisthes cinctipes, to conditions that simulated current and future intertidal zone thermal and pH environments. During the daily low tide, specimens were exposed to no, moderate or extreme heating, and during the daily high tide experienced no, moderate or extreme acidification. Respiration rate and cardiac thermal limits were assessed following 2.5 weeks of acclimation. Thermal variation had a larger overall effect than pH variation, though there was an interactive effect between the two environmental drivers. Under the most extreme temperature and pH combination, respiration rate decreased while heat tolerance increased, indicating a smaller overall aerobic energy budget (i.e. a reduced O-2 consumption rate) of which a larger portion is devoted to basal maintenance (i.e. greater thermal tolerance indicating induction of the cellular stress response). These results suggest the potential for negative long-term ecological consequences for intertidal ectotherms exposed to increased extremes in pH and temperature due to reduced energy for behavior and reproduction.",2014,10.1242/jeb.109801,217,22,3974-3980,NA,Ocean acidification; Global warming; Thermal tolerance; Comparative physiology; Metabolism; Marine
article,Interaction of osmoregulatory and acid-base compensation in white sturgeon (<i>Acipenser transmontanus</i>) during exposure to aquatic hypercarbia and elevated salinity,"Shaughnessy, Ciaran A. and Baker, Dan W. and Brauner, Colin J. and Morgan, John D. and Bystriansky, Jason S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Migratory fishes encounter a variety of environmental conditions, including changes in salinity, temperature and dissolved gases, and it is important to understand how these fishes are able to acclimate to multiple environmental stressors. The gill is the primary site of both acid-base balance and ion regulation in fishes. Many ion transport mechanisms involved with acid-base compensation are also required for the regulation of plasma Na+ and Cl+, the predominant extracellular ions, potentially resulting in a strong interaction between ionoregulation and acid-base regulation. The present study examined the physiological interaction of elevated dissolved CO2 (an acid-base disturbance) on osmoregulation during seawater acclimation (an ionoregulatory disturbance) in juvenile white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus). Blood pH (pH(e)), plasma {[}HCO3-], {[}Na+], {[}Cl-] and osmolality, white muscle water content, and gill Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) and Na+/K+/2Cl(-) co-transporter (NKCC) abundance were examined over a 10 day seawater (SW) acclimation period under normocarbia (NCSW) or during prior and continued exposure to hypercarbia (HCSW), and compared with a normocarbic freshwater (NCFW) control. Hypercarbia induced a severe extracellular acidosis (from pH 7.65 to pH 7.2) in HCSW sturgeon, and these fish had a 2-fold greater rise in plasma osmolarity over NCSW by day 2 of SW exposure. Interestingly, pHe recovery in HCSW was associated more prominently with an elevation in plasma Na+ prior to osmotic recovery and more prominently with a reduction in plasma Cl- following osmotic recovery, indicating a biphasic response as the requirements of osmoregulation transitioned from ion-uptake to ion-excretion throughout SW acclimation. These results imply a prioritization of osmoregulatory recovery over acid-base recovery in this period of combined exposure to acid-base and ionoregulatory disturbances.",2015,10.1242/jeb.125567,218,17,2712-2719,NA,Osmoregulation; Acid-base balance; Seawater; Hypercarbia; Multiple stressors
article,New insights into the allosteric effects of CO<sub>2</sub> and bicarbonate on crocodilian hemoglobin,"Bautista, Naim M. and Malte, Hans and Natarajan, Chandrasekhar and Wang, Tobias and Storz, Jay F. and Fago, Angela",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Crocodilians are unique among vertebrates in that their hemoglobin (Hb) O-2 binding is allosterically regulated by bicarbonate, which forms in red blood cells upon hydration of CO2. Although known for decades, this remarkable mode of allosteric control has not yet been experimentally verified with direct evidence of bicarbonate binding to crocodilian Hb, probably because of confounding CO2 -mediated effects. Here, we provide the first quantitative analysis of the separate allosteric effects of CO2 and bicarbonate on purified Hb of the spectacled caiman (Caiman crocodilus). Using thin-layer gas diffusion chamber and Tucker chamber techniques, we demonstrate that both CO2 and bicarbonate bind to Hb with high affinity and strongly decrease O-2 saturation of Hb. We propose that both effectors bind to an unidentified positively charged site containing a reactive amino group in the low-O(2 )affinity T conformation of Hb. These results provide the first experimental evidence that bicarbonate binds directly to crocodilian Hb and promotes O-2 delivery independently of CO2. Using the gas diffusion chamber, we observed similar effects in Hbs of a phylogenetically diverse set of other caiman, alligator and crocodile species, suggesting that the unique mode of allosteric regulation by CO2 and bicarbonate evolved >80-100 million years ago in the common ancestor of crocodilians. Our results show a tight and unusual linkage between O-2 and CO2 transport in the blood of crocodilians, where the build-up of erytrocytic CO2 and bicarbonate ions during breath-hold diving or digestion facilitates O-2 delivery, while Hb desaturation facilitates CO2 transport as protein-bound CO2 and bicarbonate.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242615,224,15,NA,jeb242615,Adaptation; Oxygen; Carbon dioxide; Blood; Allosteric regulation
article,Differential impacts of ocean acidification and warming on winter and summer progeny of a coastal squid (<i>Loligo vulgaris</i>),"Rosa, Rui and Truebenbach, Katja and Pimentel, Marta S. and Boavida-Portugal, Joana and Faleiro, Filipa and Baptista, Miguel and Dionisio, Gisela and Calado, Ricardo and Poertner, Hans O. and Repolho, Tiago",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Little is known about the capacity of early life stages to undergo hypercapnic and thermal acclimation under the future scenarios of ocean acidification and warming. Here, we investigated a comprehensive set of biological responses to these climate change-related variables (2 degrees C above winter and summer average spawning temperatures and Delta pH=0.5 units) during the early ontogeny of the squid Loligo vulgaris. Embryo survival rates ranged from 92\% to 96\% under present-day temperature (13-17 degrees C) and pH (8.0) scenarios. Yet, ocean acidification (pH 7.5) and summer warming (19 degrees C) led to a significant drop in the survival rates of summer embryos (47\%, P<0.05). The embryonic period was shortened by increasing temperature in both pH treatments (P<0.05). Embryo growth rates increased significantly with temperature under present-day scenarios, but there was a significant trend reversal under future summer warming conditions (P<0.05). Besides pronounced premature hatching, a higher percentage of abnormalities was found in summer embryos exposed to future warming and lower pH (P<0.05). Under the hypercapnic scenario, oxygen consumption rates decreased significantly in late embryos and newly hatched paralarvae, especially in the summer period (P<0.05). Concomitantly, there was a significant enhancement of the heat shock response (HSP70/HSC70) with warming in both pH treatments and developmental stages. Upper thermal tolerance limits were positively influenced by acclimation temperature, and such thresholds were significantly higher in late embryos than in hatchlings under present-day conditions (P<0.05). In contrast, the upper thermal tolerance limits under hypercapnia were higher in hatchlings than in embryos. Thus, we show that the stressful abiotic conditions inside the embryo's capsules will be exacerbated under near-future ocean acidification and summer warming scenarios. The occurrence of prolonged embryogenesis along with lowered thermal tolerance limits under such conditions is expected to negatively affect the survival success of squid early life stages during the summer spawning period, but not winter spawning.",2014,10.1242/jeb.096081,217,4,518-525,NA,Ocean acidification; Global warming; Thermal tolerance limits; Early life stages; Squid
article,Differential reaction norms to ocean acidification in two oyster species from contrasting habitats,"Caillon, Coline and Pernet, Fabrice and Lutier, Mathieu and Di Poi, Carole",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Ocean acidification (OA), a consequence of the increase in anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide, causes major changes in the chemistry of carbonates in the ocean with deleterious effects on calcifying organisms. The pH/P-CO2 range to which species are exposed in nature is important to consider when interpreting the response of coastal organisms to OA. In this context, emerging approaches, which assess the reaction norms of organisms to a wide pH gradient, are improving our understanding of tolerance thresholds and acclimation potential to OA. In this study, we deciphered the reaction norms of two oyster species living in contrasting habitats: the intertidal oyster Crassostrea gigas and the subtidal flat oyster Ostrea edulis, which are two economically and ecologically valuable species in temperate ecosystems. Six-month-old oysters of each species were exposed in common garden tanks for 48 days to a pH gradient ranging from 7.7 to 6.4 (total scale). Both species were tolerant down to a pH of 6.6 with high plasticity in fitness-related traits such as survival and growth. However, oysters underwent remodelling of membrane fatty acids to cope with decreasing pH along with shell bleaching impairing shell integrity and consequently animal fitness. Finally, our work revealed species-specific physiological responses and highlights that intertidal C. gigas seem to have a better acclimation potential to rapid and extreme OA changes than O. edulis. Overall, our study provides important data about the phenotypic plasticity and its limits in two oyster species, which is essential for assessing the challenges posed to marine organisms by OA.",2023,10.1242/jeb.246432,226,23,NA,jeb246432,Bleaching; Fatty acid; Mollusc; pH; Plasticity; Tipping point
article,Metabolic cost of freeze thaw and source of CO<sub>2</sub> production in the freeze-tolerant cricket <i>Gryllus veletis</i>,"Smith, Adam and Turnbull, Kurtis F. and Moulton, Julian H. and Sinclair, Brent J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Freeze-tolerant insects can survive the conversion of a substantial portion of their body water to ice. While the process of freezing induces active responses from some organisms, these responses appear absent from freeze-tolerant insects. Recovery from freezing likely requires energy expenditure to repair tissues and re-establish homeostasis, which should be evident as elevations in metabolic rate after thaw. We measured carbon dioxide (CO2) production in the spring field cricket (Gryllus veletis) as a proxy for metabolic rate during cooling, freezing and thawing and compared the metabolic costs associated with recovery from freezing and chilling. We hypothesized that freezing does not induce active responses, but that recovery from freeze-thaw is metabolically costly. We observed a burst of CO2 release at the onset of freezing in all crickets that froze, including those killed by either cyanide or an insecticide (thiacloprid), implying that the source of this CO2 was neither aerobic metabolism nor a coordinated nervous system response. These results suggest that freezing does not induce active responses from G. veletis, but may liberate buffered CO2 from hemolymph. There was a transient `overshoot' in CO2 release during the first hour of recovery, and elevated metabolic rate at 24, 48 and 72 h, in crickets that had been frozen compared with crickets that had been chilled (but not frozen). Thus, recovery from freeze-thaw and the repair of freeze-induced damage appears metabolically costly in G. veletis, and this cost persists for several days after thawing.",2021,10.1242/jeb.234419,224,1,NA,jeb234419,Metabolic rate; TCO2; Hemolymph; Respiratory quotient; Spiracles; CTmin
article,"Salmonid gene expression biomarkers indicative of physiological responses to changes in salinity and temperature, but not dissolved oxygen","Houde, Aimee Lee S. and Akbarzadeh, Arash and Gunther, Oliver P. and Li, Shaorong and Patterson, David A. and Farrell, Anthony P. and Hinch, Scott G. and Miller, Kristina M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"An organism's ability to respond effectively to environmental change is critical to its survival. Yet, life stage and overall condition can dictate tolerance thresholds to heightened environmental stressors, such that stress may not be equally felt across individuals and at all times. Also, the transcriptional responses induced by environmental changes can reflect both generalized responses as well as others that are highly specific to the type of change being experienced. Thus, if transcriptional biomarkers specific to a stressor, even under multi-stressor conditions, can be identified, the biomarkers could then be applied in natural environments to determine when and where an individual experiences such a stressor. Here, we experimentally challenged juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) to validate candidate gill gene expression biomarkers. A sophisticated experimental design manipulated salinity (freshwater, brackish water and seawater), temperature (10, 14 and 18 degrees C) and dissolved oxygen (normoxia and hypoxia) in all 18 possible combinations for 6 days using separate trials for three smolt statuses (pre-smolt, smolt and de-smolt). In addition, changes in juvenile behaviour, plasma variables, gill Na+/K+-ATPase activity, body size, body morphology and skin pigmentation supplemented the gene expression responses. We identified biomarkers specific to salinity and temperature that transcended the multiple stressors, smolt status and mortality (live, dead and moribund). Similar biomarkers for dissolved oxygen were not identified. This work demonstrates the unique power of gene expression biomarkers to identify a specific stressor even under multi-stressor conditions, and we discuss our next steps for hypoxia biomarkers using an RNA-seq study.",2019,10.1242/jeb.198036,222,13,NA,jeb198036,Transcription; Environmental stressors; Smolt status; Na+/K+-ATPase activity; Plasma ions; Behaviour
article,Reduced thermal tolerance during salinity acclimation in brook trout (<i>Salvelinus fontinalis</i>) can be rescued by prior treatment with cortisol,"Shaughnessy, Ciaran A. and McCormick, Stephen D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The aims of this study were to assess whether thermal tolerance of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) is affected during seawater (SW) acclimation and to investigate the role of cortisol in osmoregulation and thermal tolerance during SW acclimation. Freshwater (FW)-acclimated brook trout at 18 degrees C (T-acc) were exposed to SW for 16 days, whilst maintaining a FW control. Fish were examined for critical thermal maximum (CTmax) 0 (before), 2, 5 and 16 days after SW exposure, and sampled at T-acc and CTmax for analysis of plasmacortisol, glucose and Cl-, gill Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) activity and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) abundance, and white muscle water content. At 2 days in SW, CTmax was significantly reduced (from 31 to 26 degrees C), and then recovered by 16 days. This transient decrease in thermal tolerance coincided with a transient increase in plasma Cl- and decrease in muscle moisture content. Salinity itself had no effect on gill HSP70 abundance compared with the large and immediate effects of high temperature exposure during CTmax testing. To examine the role of cortisol in osmoregulation, brook trout were administered a cortisol implant (5 and 25 mu g g(-1)CORT) prior to SW exposure. Both CORT doses significantly increased their capacity tomaintain plasma Cl- during SW acclimation.

article,Impact of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> background levels on the host-seeking behaviour of <i>Aedes aegypti</i>,"Majeed, Shahid and Hill, Sharon Rose and Ignell, Rickard",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Mosquitoes rely on carbon dioxide (CO2) to detect and orient towards their blood hosts. However, the variable and rapid fluctuations of atmospheric CO2 concentrations may have an impact on the host-seeking behaviour of mosquitoes. In this study, we analysed the effect of transient elevated background levels of CO2 on the host-seeking behaviour and the physiological characteristics of the CO2-sensitive olfactory receptor neurones (ORNs) in female yellow fever mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti. We show that the take-off and source contact behaviour of A. aegypti is impeded at elevated background levels of CO2 as a result of masking of the stimulus signal. The mechanism underlying this masking during take-off behaviour is one of sensory constraint. We show that the net response of the CO2-ORNs regulates this CO2-related behaviour. Since these neurones themselves are not habituated or fatigued by the transient elevation of background CO2, we propose that habituation of second-order neurones in response to the elevated CO2-ORN activity could be one mechanism by which the net response is transduced by the olfactory system. The findings from this study may help to predict future shifts in mosquito-host interactions and consequently to predict vectorial capacity in the light of climate change.",2014,10.1242/jeb.092718,217,4,598-604,NA,Olfaction; Single sensillum recording; Wind tunnel; Climate change; Absolute detector
article,Effects of elevated carbon dioxide and temperature on locomotion and the repeatability of lateralization in a keystone marine mollusc,"Domenici, Paolo and Torres, Rodrigo and Manriquez, Patricio H.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Recent work has shown that the behaviour of marine organisms can be affected by elevated P-CO2, although little is known about the effect of multiple stressors. We therefore investigated the effect of elevated P-CO2 and temperature on locomotion and behaviour during prey searching in the marine gastropod Concholepas concholepas, a predator characteristic of the southeastern Pacific coast. Movement duration, decision time, route finding and lateralization were measured using a T-maze tank with a prey positioned behind a barrier. Four treatments, representing present day and near-future scenarios of ocean acidification and warming were used in rearing the individuals for 6 months. Regardless of the treatment, no significant differences were found in relative and absolute lateralization before and after exposure for 6 months. However, relative lateralization was not repeatable for animals tested after 6 months at elevated P-CO2 at both experimental temperatures, whereas it was repeatable in individuals kept at the present day level of P-CO2. We suggest that these effects may be related to a behavioural malfunction caused by elevated P-CO2. Movement duration, decision time and route finding were not repeatable. However, movement duration and decision time increased and route finding decreased in elevated P-CO2 (at 15 degrees C), suggesting that elevated P-CO2 has negative effects on the locomotor and sensory performance of C. concholepas in the presence of a prey odour, thereby decreasing their ability to forage efficiently.",2017,10.1242/jeb.151779,220,4,667-676,NA,Ocean acidification; Temperature; Gastropod locomotion; Lateralization; Route finding; Concholepas concholepas
article,Quantifying the acid-base status of dragonflies across their transition from breathing water to breathing air,"Lee, Daniel J. and Matthews, Philip G. D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Amphibiotic dragonflies show a significant increase in hemolymph total CO2 (TCO2) as they transition from breathing water to breathing air. This study examined the hemolymph acid-base status of dragonflies from two families (Aeshnidae and Libellulidae) as they transition from water to air. CO2 solubility (alpha(CO2)) and the apparent carbonic acid dissociation constant (pK(app)) were determined in vitro, and pH/bicarbonate concentration ({[}HCO3-]) plots were produced by equilibrating hemolymph samples with P-CO2 between 0.5 and 5 kPa in custom-built rotating microtonometers. Hemolymph alpha(CO2) varied little between families and across development (mean 0.355 +/- 0.005 mmol l(-1) kPa(-1)) while pK(app) was between 6.23 and 6.27, similar to values determined for grasshopper hemolymph. However, the non-HCO3- buffer capacity for dragonfly hemolymph was uniformly low relative to that of other insects (3.6-5.4 mmol l(-1) pH(-1)). While aeshnid dragonflies maintained this level as bimodally breathing late-final instars and air-breathing adults, the buffer capacity of bimodally breathing late-final instar Libellula nymphs increased substantially to 9.9 mmol l(-1) pH(-1). Using the pH/{[}HCO3-] plots and in vivo measurements of TCO2 and P-CO2 from early-final instar nymphs, it was calculated that the in vivo hemolymph pH was 7.8 for an aeshnid nymph and 7.9 for a libellulid nymph. The pH/{[}HCO3-] plots show that the changes in acid-base status experienced by dragonflies across their development are more moderate than those seen in vertebrate amphibians. Whether these differences are due to dragonflies being secondarily aquatic, or arise from intrinsic differences between insect and vertebrate gas exchange and acid-base regulatory mechanisms, remains an open question.",2019,10.1242/jeb.210294,222,22,NA,jeb210294,Acid-base balance; Ontogeny; Odonata; Rectal gill; Respiratory acidosis; Evolution
article,"Cutaneous water collection by a moisture-harvesting lizard, the thorny devil (<i>Moloch horridus</i>)","Comanns, Philipp and Withers, Philip C. and Esser, Falk J. and Baumgartner, Werner",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Moisture-harvesting lizards, such as the Australian thorny devil, Moloch horridus, have the remarkable ability to inhabit arid regions. Special skin structures, comprising a micro-structured surface with capillary channels in between imbricate overlapping scales, enable the lizard to collect water by capillarity and transport it to the mouth for ingestion. The ecological role of this mechanism is the acquisition of water from various possible sources such as rainfall, puddles, dew, condensation on the skin, or absorption from moist sand, and we evaluate here the potential of these various sources for water uptake by M. horridus. The water volume required to fill the skin capillary system is 3.19\% of body mass. Thorny devils standing in water can fill their capillary system and then drink from this water, at approximately 0.7 mu l per jaw movement. Thorny devils standing on nearly saturated moist sand could only fill the capillary channels to 59\% of their capacity, and did not drink. However, placing moist sand on skin replicas showed that the capillary channels could be filled from moist sand when assisted by gravity, suggesting that their field behaviour of shovelling moist sand onto the dorsal skin might fill the capillary channels and enable drinking. Condensation facilitated by thermal disequilibrium between a cool thorny devil and warm moist air provided skin capillary filling to approximately 0.22\% of body weight, which was insufficient for drinking. Our results suggest that rain and moist sand seem to be ecologically likely water sources for M. horridus on a regular basis.",2016,10.1242/jeb.148791,219,21,3473-3479,NA,Lizard; Water uptake; Skin; Moist sand; Capillary; Micro-ornamentation
article,Carbon dioxide-induced bioluminescence increase in <i>Arachnocampa larvae</i>,"Charlton, Hamish Richard and Merritt, David John",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Arachnocampa larvae utilise bioluminescence to lure small arthropod prey into their web-like silk snares. The luciferin-luciferase light-producing reaction occurs in a specialised light organ composed of Malpighian tubule cells in association with a tracheal mass. The accepted model for bioluminescence regulation is that light is actively repressed during the non-glowing period and released when glowing through the night. The model is based upon foregoing observations that carbon dioxide (CO2) - a commonly used insect anaesthetic produces elevated light output in whole, live larvae as well as isolated light organs. Alternative anaesthetics were reported to have a similar light-releasing effect. We set out to test this model in Arachnocampa flava larvae by exposing them to a range of anaesthetics and gas mixtures. The anaesthetics isoflurane, ethyl acetate and diethyl ether did not produce high bioluminescence responses in the same way as CO2. Ligation and dissection experiments localised the CO2 response to the light organ rather than it being a response to general anaesthesia. Exposure to hypoxia through the introduction of nitrogen gas combined with CO2 exposures highlighted that continuity between the longitudinal tracheal trunks and the light organ tracheal mass is necessary for recovery of the CO2-induced light response. The physiological basis of the CO2-induced bioluminescence increase remains unresolved, but is most likely related to access of oxygen to the photocytes. The results suggest that the repression model for bioluminescence control can be rejected. An alternative is proposed based on neural upregulation modulating bioluminescence intensity.",2020,10.1242/jeb.225151,223,15,NA,jeb225151,Glow-worm; Anaesthesia; Fungus gnat; Light organ; Photocyte

Consequently, the geographic origin of an organism can influence its responses to environmental changes, and therefore its sensitivity to combined global change drivers. This study aimed at determining the physiological responses of the northern shrimp, Pandalus borealis, at different levels of biological organization and from four different geographic origins, exposed to elevated temperature and low pH to define its sensitivity to future ocean warming and acidification. Shrimp sampled within the northwest Atlantic were exposed for 30 days to combinations of three temperature (2, 6 or 10 \& DEG;C) and two pH levels (7.75 or 7.40). Survival, metabolic rates, whole-organism aerobic performance and cellular energetic capacity were assessed at the end of the exposure. Our results show that shrimp survival was negatively affected by temperature above 6 \& DEG;C and low pH, regardless of their origin. Additionally, shrimp from different origins show overall similar whole-organism performances: aerobic scope increasing with increasing temperature and decreasing with decreasing pH. Finally, the stability of aerobic metabolism appears to be related to cellular adjustments specific to shrimp origin. Our results show that the level of intraspecific variation differs among levels of biological organization: different cellular capacities lead to similar individual performances. Thus, the sensitivity of the northern shrimp to ocean warming and acidification is overall comparable among origins. Nonetheless, shrimp vulnerability to predicted global change scenarios for 2100 could differ among origins owing to different regional environmental conditions.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245400,226,16,NA,jeb245400,Ocean warming; Ocean acidification; Comparative physiology; Aerobic performance; Pandalus borealis; Conservation

Our study investigated how the presence of symbiotic dinoflagellates affects the response of pH(i) to P-CO2-driven seawater acidification in cells isolated from Pocillopora damicornis. Using the fluorescent dye BCECF-AM, in conjunction with confocal microscopy, we simultaneously characterised the pH(i) response in host coral cells and their dinoflagellate symbionts, in symbiotic and non-symbiotic states under saturating light, with and without the photosynthetic inhibitor DCMU. Each treatment was run under control (pH 7.8) and CO2-acidified seawater conditions (decreasing pH from 7.8 to 6.8). After 105 min of CO2 addition, by which time the external pH (pH(e)) had declined to 6.8, the dinoflagellate symbionts had increased their pH(i) by 0.5 pH units above control levels when in the absence of DCMU. In contrast, in both symbiotic and non-symbiotic host coral cells, 15 min of CO2 addition (0.2 pH unit drop in pH(e)) led to cytoplasmic acidosis equivalent to 0.3-0.4 pH units irrespective of whether DCMU was present. Despite further seawater acidification over the duration of the experiment, the pH(i) of non-symbiotic coral cells did not change, though in host cells containing a symbiont cell the pH(i) recovered to control levels when photsynthesis was not inhibited. This recovery was negated when cells were incubated with DCMU. Our results reveal that photosynthetic activity of the endosymbiont is tightly coupled with the ability of the host cell to recover from cellular acidosis after exposure to high CO2/low pH.",2014,10.1242/jeb.099549,217,11,1963-1969,NA,Symbiodinium; Acidosis; Climate change

Little, however, is known about the thermal sensitivity of a diverse and abundant group of reef animals, the gastropods. The humpbacked conch (Gibberulus gibberulus gibbosus), inhabiting subtidal zones of the Great Barrier Reef, was chosen as a model because vigorous jumping, causing increased oxygen uptake ((M) over dot O-2), can be induced by exposure to odour from a predatory cone snail (Conus marmoreus). We investigated the effect of present-day ambient (417-454 mu atm) and projected-future (955-987 mu atm) PCO2 on resting ((M) over dot O-2,(rest)) and maximum ((M) over dot O-2,(max)) ((M) over dot O-2,O- (rest)), as well as MO2 during hypoxia and critical oxygen tension (PO2, crit), in snails kept at present-day ambient (28 degrees C) or projected-future temperature (33 degrees C). ((M) over dot O-2,O-rest), rest and ((M) over dot O-2,O-max), were measured both at the acclimation temperature and during an acute 5 degrees C increase. Jumping caused a 4-to 6-fold increase in ((M) over dot O-2), and ((M) over dot O-2,(max)) increased with temperature so that absolute aerobic scope was maintained even at 38 degrees C, although factorial scope was reduced. The humpbacked conch has a high hypoxia tolerance with a PO2, crit of 2.5 kPa at 28 degrees C and 3.5 kPa at 33 degrees C. There was no effect of elevated CO2 on respiratory performance at any temperature.

By holding fish with indwelling catheters at temperatures from 25 to 36 degrees C and measuring blood gasses, we show that this animal follows the ubiquitous poikilotherm pattern of reducing arterial pH with increasing temperature. Surprisingly, the temperature increase caused an elevation of Pa-CO2 from 5 to 12 mmHg while the plasma bicarbonate concentration remained constant at around 8 mmol l(-1). The temperature increase also gave rise to a larger fractional increase in air breathing than in gill ventilation frequency.

But the genetic and physiological bases of anoxic coma induction and recovery are only partially understood, as are the long-term consequences for the animal's performance. We examined three populations of Drosophila melanogaster (designated B) that have been inadvertently under selection for rapid recovery from CO2 exposure for nearly 40 years (around 1000 generations) resulting from routine maintenance practices. We contrasted CO2 and N-2 (presumed a less reactive gas) knockdown and recovery times of these B flies with six populations of common ancestry (A and C populations) that were not exposed to CO2 over the same period. We found that B populations showed faster and more consistent locomotor recovery than A or C populations after CO2 knockdown, a result also observed with N-2 knockdown. A and C populations showed much higher variance in recovery time after CO2 exposure than after N-2 exposure, suggesting gas-specific effects on pathways associated with locomotor recovery. Although these selection treatments result in considerable variation in life history attributes and body size, with the characteristic intermediacy of B populations, their superiority in resistance to gas exposure and locomotor recovery suggests that this is a direct consequence of prior repeated exposure to anoxia, broadly, and CO2, specifically. Hence we describe a powerful new evolutionary model for the genetic and physiological investigation of anoxic coma in insects.",2019,10.1242/jeb.199521,222,14,NA,jeb199521,Anoxic coma; Laboratory selection; Carbon dioxide; Adaptation; Locomotor behaviour; Locomotor recovery; Time to immobilization

How species will respond to these changes depends on their capacity for plastic and adaptive responses. Little is known about the mechanisms that govern plasticity and adaptability or how global changes will influence these relationships across multiple generations. Here, we exposed the emerging model marine polychaete Ophryotrocha labronica to conditions simulating ocean warming and acidification, in isolation and in combination over five generations to identify: (i) how multiple versus single global change drivers alter both juvenile and adult life-history traits; (ii) the mechanistic link between adult physiological and fitness-related life-history traits; and (iii) whether the phenotypic changes observed over multiple generations are of plastic and/or adaptive origin. Two juvenile (developmental rate; survival to sexual maturity) and two adult (average reproductive body size; fecundity) life-history traits were measured in each generation, in addition to three physiological (cellular reactive oxygen species content, mitochondrial density, mitochondrial capacity) traits. We found that multi-generational exposure to warming alone caused an increase in juvenile developmental rate, reactive oxygen species production and mitochondrial density, decreases in average reproductive body size and fecundity, and fluctuations in mitochondrial capacity, relative to control conditions. Exposure to ocean acidification alone had only minor effects on juvenile developmental rate. Remarkably, when both drivers of global change were present, only mitochondrial capacity was significantly affected, suggesting that ocean warming and acidification act as opposing vectors of stress across multiple generations.",2017,10.1242/jeb.149989,220,4,551-563,NA,Selection; Acclimation; Phenotypic plasticity; Evolution

Extreme weather such as heatwaves can cause mass-mortality events that may significantly impact populations and species. There are currently insufficient data concerning physiological plasticity to inform models of species' response to extreme events and develop mitigation strategies. Consequently, we examine here the physiological plasticity of a small desert bird in response to hot (mean maximum ambient temperature=42.7 degrees C) and cooler (mean maximum ambient temperature=31.4 degrees C) periods during a single Austral summer. We measured body mass, metabolic rate, evaporative water loss and body temperature, along with blood parameters (corticosterone, glucose and uric acid) of wild zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) to assess their physiological state and determine the mechanisms by which they respond to heatwaves. Hot days were not significant stressors; they did not result in modification of baseline blood parameters or an inability to maintain body mass, provided drinking water was available. During heatwaves, finches shifted their thermoneutral zone to higher temperatures. They reduced metabolic heat production, evaporative water loss and wet thermal conductance, and increased hyperthermia, especially when exposed to high ambient temperature. A consideration of the significant physiological plasticity that we have demonstrated to achieve more favourable heat and water balance is essential for effectively modelling and planning for the impacts of climate change on biodiversity.",2020,10.1242/jeb.225524,223,12,NA,jeb225524,Blood parameters; Climate change; Evaporative water loss; Metabolic rate; Physiological stress; Temperature

Global climate change has the potential to impact continental Antarctic organisms because of increasing temperatures and ultraviolet radiation. This research evaluates how ongoing climate changes will affect Antarctic species, and whether Antarctic organisms will be able to adapt to the new environmental conditions. Tardigrades represent one of the main terrestrial components of Antarctic meiofauna; therefore, the pan-Antarctic tardigrade Acutuncus antarcticus was used as model to predict the fate of Antarctic meiofauna threatened by climate change. Acutuncus antarcticus individuals tolerate events of desiccation, increased temperature and UV radiation. Both hydrated and desiccated animals tolerate increases in UV radiation, even though the desiccated animals are more resistant. Nevertheless, the survivorship of hydrated and desiccated animals is negatively affected by the combination of temperature and UV radiation, with the hydrated animals being more tolerant than desiccated animals. Finally, UV radiation has a negative impact on the life history traits of successive generations of A. antarcticus, causing an increase in egg reabsorption and teratological events. In the long run, A. antarcticus could be at risk of population reductions or even extinction. Nevertheless, because the changes in global climate will proceed gradually and an overlapping of temperature and UV increase could be limited in time, A. antarcticus, as well as many other Antarctic organisms, could have the potential to overcome global warming stresses, and/or the time and capability to adapt to the new environmental conditions.",2018,10.1242/jeb.160622,221,4,NA,jeb160622,Meiofauna; Life history traits; Desiccation; Thermo-tolerance; Ultraviolet radiation; Antarctica

Some fishes preferentially regulate tissue pH {[}intracellular pH (pH(i))] against changes in pHe; this has been proposed to be associated with exceptional CO2 tolerance and has never been identified in amniotes. As embryonic turtles may be CO2 tolerant based on nesting strategy, we hypothesized that they preferentially regulate pH(i), conferring tolerance to severe acute acid-base challenges. This hypothesis was tested by investigating pH regulation in common snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina) reared in normoxia then exposed to hypercarbia (13 kPa PCO2) for 1 h at three developmental ages: 70\% and 90\% of incubation, and yearlings. Hypercarbia reduced pH(e) but not pH(i), at all developmental ages. At 70\% of incubation, pH(e) was depressed by 0.324 pH units while pH(i) of brain, white muscle and lung increased; heart, liver and kidney pHi remained unchanged. At 90\% of incubation, pH(e) was depressed by 0.352 pH units but heart pH(i) increased with no change in pH(i) of other tissues. Yearlings exhibited a pHe reduction of 0.235 pH units but had no changes in pH(i) of any tissues. The results indicate common snapping turtles preferentially regulate pH(i) during development, but the degree of response is reduced throughout development.

article,The black-legged tick Ixodes scapularis detects CO2 without the Haller's organ,"Staedele, Carola",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Both male and female ticks have a strong innate drive to find and blood-feed on hosts. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is considered a critical behavioral activator and attractant for ticks and an essential sensory cue to find hosts. Yet, how CO2 activates and promotes host seeking in ticks is poorly understood. CO2 responses were studied in the black-legged tick Ixodes scapularis, the primary vector for Lyme disease in North America. Adult males and females were exposed to 1\%, 2\%, 4\% or 8\% CO2, and changes in walking behavior and foreleg movement were analyzed. CO2 is a potent stimulant for adult I. scapularis, even at lower concentrations (1\%). Behavioral reactions depended on the animal's state: walking ticks increased their walking speed, while stationary ticks started to wave their forelegs and began to quest - both behaviors resembling aspects of host seeking. Only in sporadic cases did stationary animals start to walk when exposed to CO2, supporting the hypothesis that CO2 acts as an activator rather than an attractant. Furthermore, I. scapularis did not show a clear concentration preference and was not tuned more robustly to breathlike CO2 concentrations (similar to 4\%) than to the other concentrations tested. Moreover, convincing evidence is provided showing that the foreleg Haller's organ is not necessary for CO2 detection. Even with a disabled or amputated Haller's organ, I. scapularis responded robustly to CO2, signifying that there must be CO2sensitive structures important for tick host seeking that have not yet been identified.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246874,227,6,NA,jeb246874,Host seeking; Kairomone; Disease vector; Behavior; Parasites

Nonetheless, currently available climatic datasets lack data from the forest interior and, furthermore, our knowledge of thermal tolerance among tropical ectotherms is limited. We therefore studied natural variation in the microclimate experienced by tropical butterflies in the genus Heliconius across their Andean range in a single year. We found that the forest strongly buffers temperature and humidity in the understorey, especially in the lowlands, where temperatures are more extreme. There were systematic differences between our yearly records and macroclimate databases (WorldClim2), with lower interpolated minimum temperatures and maximum temperatures higher than expected. We then assessed thermal tolerance of 10 Heliconius butterfly species in the wild and found that populations at high elevations had significantly lower heat tolerance than those at lower elevations. However, when we reared populations of the widespread H. erato from high and low elevations in a common-garden environment, the difference in heat tolerance across elevations was reduced, indicating plasticity in this trait.

article,Living in flowing water increases resistance to ultraviolet B radiation,"Ghanizadeh-Kazerouni, Ensiyeh and Franklin, Craig E. and Seebacher, Frank",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Ultraviolet B radiation (UV-B) is an important environmental driver that can affect locomotor performance negatively by inducing production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Prolonged regular exercise increases antioxidant activities, which may alleviate the negative effects of UV-B-induced ROS. Animals naturally performing exercise, such as humans performing regular exercise or fish living in flowing water, may therefore be more resilient to the negative effects of UV-B. We tested this hypothesis in a fully factorial experiment, where we exposed mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) to UV-B and control (no UV-B) conditions in flowing and still water. We show that fish exposed to UV-B and kept in flowing water had increased sustained swimming performance (U-crit), increased antioxidant defences (catalase activity and glutathione concentrations) and reduced cellular damage (lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl concentrations) compared with fish in still water. There was no effect of UV-B or water flow on resting or maximal rates of oxygen consumption. Our results show that environmental water flow can alleviate the negative effects of UV-Binduced ROS by increasing defence mechanisms. The resultant reduction in ROS-induced damage may contribute to maintain locomotor performance. Hence, the benefits of regular exercise are `transferred' to improve resilience to the negative impacts of UV-B. Ecologically, the mechanistic link between responses to different habitat characteristics can determine the success of animals. These dynamics have important ecological connotations when river or stream flow changes as a result of weather patterns, climate or human modifications.",2017,10.1242/jeb.151019,220,4,582-587,NA,Reactive oxygen species; Exercise; Locomotion; Antioxidants; Habitat modification

Although infaunal organisms can be expected to be particularly impacted by decreases in seawater pH, as a result of naturally acidified conditions in benthic habitats, information regarding physiological and behavioral responses is still scarce. Determination of P-O2 and P-CO2 gradients within burrows of the brittlestar Amphiura filiformis during environmental hypercapnia demonstrated that besides hypoxic conditions, increases of environmental P-CO2 are additive to the already high P-CO2 (up to 0.08 kPa) within the burrows. In response to up to 4 weeks exposure to pH 7.3 (0.3 kPa P-CO2) and pH 7.0 (0.6 kPa P-CO2), metabolic rates of A. filiformis were significantly reduced in pH 7.0 treatments, accompanied by increased ammonium excretion rates. Gene expression analyses demonstrated significant reductions of acid-base (NBCe and AQP9) and metabolic (G6PDH, LDH) genes. Determination of extracellular acid-base status indicated an uncompensated acidosis in CO2-treated animals, which could explain the depressed metabolic rates. Metabolic depression is associated with a retraction of filter feeding arms into sediment burrows. Regeneration of lost arm tissues following traumatic amputation is associated with significant increases in metabolic rate, and hypercapnic conditions (pH 7.0, 0.6 kPa) dramatically reduce the metabolic scope for regeneration, reflected in an 80\% reduction in regeneration rate. Thus, the present work demonstrates that elevated seawater P-CO2 significantly affects the environment and the physiology of infaunal organisms like A. filiformis.",2014,10.1242/jeb.100024,217,13,2411-2421,NA,Acid-base regulation; Carbon capture storage; Behavior; Hypercapnia; Ocean acidification; Invertebrates

R. and Tresguerres, Martin and Wilson, Rod W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Fish in coastal ecosystems can be exposed to acute variations in CO2 of between 0.2 and 1 kPa CO2 (2000-10,000 mu atm). Coping with this environmental challenge will depend on the ability to rapidly compensate for the internal acid-base disturbance caused by sudden exposure to high environmental CO2 (blood and tissue acidosis); however, studies about the speed of acid-base regulatory responses in marine fish are scarce. We observed that upon sudden exposure to similar to 1 kPa CO2, European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) completely regulate erythrocyte intracellular pH within similar to 40 min, thus restoring haemoglobin-O-2 affinity to pre-exposure levels. Moreover, blood pH returned to normal levels within similar to 2 h, which is one of the fastest acid-base recoveries documented in any fish. This was achieved via a large upregulation of net acid excretion and accumulation of HCO3- in blood, which increased from similar to 4 to similar to 22 mmol l(-1). While the abundance and intracellular localisation of gill Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) and Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3) remained unchanged, the apical surface area of acid-excreting gill ionocytes doubled. This constitutes a novel mechanism for rapidly increasing acid excretion during sudden blood acidosis. Rapid acid-base regulation was completely prevented when the same high CO2 exposure occurred in seawater with experimentally reduced HCO3- and pH, probably because reduced environmental pH inhibited gill H+ excretion via NHE3. The rapid and robust acid-base regulatory responses identified will enable European sea bass to maintain physiological performance during large and sudden CO2 fluctuations that naturally occur in coastal environments.",2022,10.1242/jeb.242735,225,2,NA,jeb242735,Hypercapnia; Ionocytes; Respiratory acidosis; O-2 transport; Gill plasticity
article,Discontinuous gas exchange in Madagascar hissing cockroaches is not a consequence of hysteresis around a fixed <i>P</i><sub>CO2</sub> threshold,"Rowe, Tormod T. C. and Gutbrod, Martin S. and Matthews, Philip G. D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"It has been hypothesised that insects display discontinuous gas-exchange cycles (DGCs) as a result of hysteresis in their ventilatory control, where CO2-sensitive respiratory chemoreceptors respond to changes in haemolymph P-CO2 only after some delay. If correct, DGCs would be a manifestation of an unstable feedback loop between chemoreceptors and ventilation, causing P-CO2 to oscillate around some fixed threshold value: P-CO2 above this ventilatory threshold would stimulate excessive hyperventilation, driving P-CO2 below the threshold and causing a subsequent apnoea. This hypothesis was tested by implanting micro-optodes into the haemocoel of Madagascar hissing cockroaches and measuring haemolymph P-O2 and P-CO2 simultaneously during continuous and discontinuous gas exchange. The mean haemolymph P-CO2 of 1.9 kPa measured during continuous gas exchange was assumed to represent the threshold level stimulating ventilation, and this was compared with P-CO2 levels recorded during DGCs elicited by decapitation. Cockroaches were also exposed to hypoxic (P-O2 10 kPa) and hypercapnic (P-CO2 2 kPa) gas mixtures to manipulate haemolymph P-O2 and P-CO2. Decapitated cockroaches maintained DGCs even when their haemolymph P-CO2 was forced above or below the putative similar to 2 kPa ventilation threshold, demonstrating that the characteristic oscillation between apnoea and gas exchange is not driven by a lag between changing haemolymph P-CO2 and a P-CO2 chemoreceptor with a fixed ventilatory threshold. However, it was observed that the gas exchange periods within the DGC were altered to enhance O-2 uptake and CO2 release during hypoxia and hypercapnia exposure. This indicates that while respiratory chemoreceptors do modulate ventilatory activity in response to haemolymph gas levels, their role in initiating or terminating the gas exchange periods within the DGC remains unclear.",2022,10.1242/jeb.242860,225,2,NA,jeb242860,Blood gas; In vivo; Optode; Episodic gas exchange

Todd and Midway, Stephen R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The diamondback terrapin is the only temperate turtle species that exclusively inhabits estuarine environments. Morphological, behavioral and physiological features contribute to the terrapin's ability to regulate body fluid osmotic pressure in a euryhaline environment. Low integument permeability combined with aquatic-terrestrial shuttling behavior limits passive exchange of water and salts with the environment, and terrapins regulate active uptake of salts via alterations in drinking and feeding behavior. The lachrymal salt gland facilitates excretion of excess sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) ions through active transport mechanisms. We investigated body fluid dynamics, oxygen consumption ((V) over dot O-2) and osmotic status of terrapins exposed to an acute increase in salinity (12 to 35 psu) at 10 and 25 degrees C to gain insight into the relative importance of behavioral versus physiological osmoregulatory adjustments over a range of seasonally relevant temperatures. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate the effects of experimental temperature, salinity and mass. Overall, temperature effects were stronger than salinity effects. Terrapins acclimated to 25 degrees C had significantly lower blood osmolality and Na+, and higher water turnover rates, daily water flux (DWF) and (V) over dot O-2 compared with terrapins acclimated to 10 degrees C. Salinity effects were restricted to DWF, which significantly decreased in response to acute exposure to 35 psu.

article,Preferential intracellular pH regulation: hypotheses and perspectives,"Shartau, Ryan B. and Baker, Daniel W. and Crossley, II, Dane A. and Brauner, Colin J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The regulation of vertebrate acid-base balance during acute episodes of elevated internal P-CO2 is typically characterized by extracellular pH (pH(e)) regulation. Changes in pHe are associated with qualitatively similar changes in intracellular tissue pH (pH(i)) as the two are typically coupled, referred to as `coupled pH regulation'. However, not all vertebrates rely on coupled pH regulation; instead, some preferentially regulate pH(i) against severe and maintained reductions in pHe. Preferential pH(i) regulation has been identified in several adult fish species and an aquatic amphibian, but never in adult amniotes. Recently, common snapping turtles were observed to preferentially regulate pH(i) during development; the pattern of acid-base regulation in these species shifts from preferential pH(i) regulation in embryos to coupled pH regulation in adults. In this Commentary, we discuss the hypothesis that preferential pH(i) regulation may be a general strategy employed by vertebrate embryos in order to maintain acid-base homeostasis during severe acute acid-base disturbances. In adult vertebrates, the retention or loss of preferential pH(i) regulation may depend on selection pressures associated with the environment inhabited and/or the severity of acid-base regulatory challenges to which they are exposed. We also consider the idea that the retention of preferential pH(i) regulation into adulthood may have been a key event in vertebrate evolution, with implications for the invasion of freshwater habitats, the evolution of air breathing and the transition of vertebrates from water to land.",2016,10.1242/jeb.126631,219,15,2235-2244,NA,Acid-base regulation; Preferential pH(i) regulation; Fish; Amniotes; Hypercarbia; Development; Physiology
article,Thermal tachypnea in avian embryos,"Bicego, Kenia C. and Mortola, Jacopo P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Many adult mammals and birds respond to high surrounding temperatures with thermal tachypnea - an increase in breathing frequency accompanied by shallow tidal volume, with minimal increase in oxygen consumption (VO2). This pattern favors heat dissipation by evaporative water loss (EWL) through the respiratory tract. We asked to what extent this response was apparent at the earliest stages of development, when pulmonary ventilation initiates. Measurements of pulmonary ventilation (V. E; barometric technique), VO2 (open-flow methodology) and EWL (water scrubbers) were performed on chicken embryos at the earliest appearance of pulmonary ventilation, during the internal pipping stage. Data were collected, first, at the normal incubation temperature (37.5 degrees C); then, ambient and egg temperatures were increased to approximately 44 degrees C over a 2 h period. Other embryos of the same developmental stage (controls) were maintained in normothermia for the whole duration of the experiment. During heat exposure, the embryo's VO2 and carbon dioxide production increased little. In contrast, V. E more than doubled (similar to 128\% increase), entirely because of the large rise in breathing frequency (similar to 132\% increase), with no change in tidal volume. EWLdid not change significantly, probably because, within the egg, the thermal and water vapor gradients are almost nonexistent. We conclude that chicken embryos respond to a major heat load with tachypnea, like many adult mammals and birds do. Its appearance so early in development, although ineffective for heat loss, signifies that thermal tachypnea represents an important breathing response necessary to be functional from hatching.",2017,10.1242/jeb.171702,220,24,4634-4643,NA,Heat stress; Breathing pattern; O-2 consumption; CO2 production; Evaporative water loss; Breathing frequency
article,Temperature-dependent variation in gas exchange patterns and spiracular control in <i>Rhodnius prolixus</i>,"Heinrich, Erica and Bradley, Timothy",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Insects display an array of respiratory behaviors, including the use of discontinuous gas exchange. This pattern is characterized by periods of spiracular closure, micro-openings (flutter), and complete openings during which the majority of gas exchange takes place. A current model of insect spiracular control suggests that spiracles are controlled by two interacting feedback loops, which produce the discontinuous pattern. The flutter period is thought to be initiated by a critically low partial pressure of oxygen, while the open period is initiated by a critically high CO2 threshold. The goal of our study was to test this control model under conditions of feeding-induced or temperature-induced changes in metabolic rate. We manipulated the metabolic rate of the insect Rhodnius prolixus using two discrete mechanisms: (1) feeding the insects a bloodmeal or (2) exposing them to a range of temperatures (18-38 degrees C). Examining the variation in the gas exchange patterns produced by insects in each of these treatments allowed us to determine whether spiracular control is sensitive to metabolic rate and/or temperature. We found that increases in temperature caused significant decreases in open phase burst volumes and premature abandonment of discontinuous gas exchange cycles. These effects were not observed in fed individuals maintained at a single temperature despite their higher metabolic rates. Our results indicate that some part of the spiracular control mechanism is temperature sensitive, suggesting a possible role for pH in CO2 sensing.",2014,10.1242/jeb.103986,217,15,2752-2760,NA,DGC; Insect; Metabolism; Respiration; Spiracles; Temperature
article,The insect ovipositor as a volatile sensor within a closed microcosm,"Yadav, Pratibha and Borges, Renee M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"We show that the insect ovipositor is an olfactory organ that responds to volatiles and CO2 in gaseous form. We demonstrate this phenomenon in parasitic wasps associated with Ficus racemosa where ovipositors, as slender as a human hair, drill through the syconium (enclosed inflorescences) and act as a guiding probe to locate highly specific egg-laying sites hidden inside. We hypothesize that olfaction will occur in the ovipositors of insects such as parasitic fig wasps where the hosts are concealed and volatile concentrations can build up locally. Relevant stimuli such as herbivore-induced fig volatiles and CO2 elicited electrophysiological responses from the ovipositors. Silver nitrate staining also revealed pores in ovipositor sensilla, indicating their olfactory nature. Insects could use volatile sensors on their ovipositors to evaluate ecologically relevant stimuli for oviposition. Further investigations on the sensory nature of ovipositors can provide designs for development of ovipositor-inspired micro-chemosensors.",2017,10.1242/jeb.152777,220,9,1554-1557,NA,Ovipositor; Olfaction; Sensilla; Carbon dioxide; Electrophysiology

Here, we examined seasonal variation in metabolic rate and evaporative water loss of worker bees, and seasonal variation of hive temperature and relative humidity (RH), for the stingless bee Austroplebeia essingtoni (Apidae: Meliponini) in arid tropical Australia. Both water loss and metabolic rate were lower in the cooler, dry winter than in the hot, wet summer at most ambient temperatures between 20 degrees C and 45 degrees C. Contrary to expectation, thermal tolerance thresholds were higher in the winter than in the summer. Hives were cooler in the cooler, dry winter than in the hot, wet summer, linked to an apparent lack of hive thermoregulation. The RH of hives was regulated at approximately 65\% in both seasons, which is higher than unoccupied control hives in the dry season, but less than unoccupied control hives in the wet season. Although adaptations to promote water balance appear more important for survival of A. essingtoni than traits related to temperature regulation, their capacity for water conservation is coincident with increased thermal tolerance. For these small, eusocial stingless bees in the arid tropics, where air temperatures are relatively high and stable compared with temperate areas, regulation of hive humidity appears to be of more importance than temperature for maintaining hive health.",2016,10.1242/jeb.137588,219,10,1552-1562,NA,Austroplebeia essingtoni; Hymenoptera; Thermal performance; Acclimatisation; Metabolic rate; Evaporative water loss; Hive regulation

Red blood cell carbonic anhydrase (RBC CA) activity limits the rate of intracellular acidification, yet its role in O-2 delivery has been downplayed. We developed an in vitro assay to manipulate RBC CA activity while measuring Hb-O-2 offloading following a physiologically relevant CO2-induced acidification. RBC CA activity in red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) was inhibited with ethoxzolamide by 53.7 +/- 0.5\%, which prompted a significant reduction in O-2 offloading rate by 54.30.4\% (P=0.0206, two-tailed paired t-test; n=7). Conversely, a 2.03-fold increase in RBC CA activity prompted a 2.14-fold increase in O-2 offloading rate (P<0.001, two-tailed paired t-test; n=8). This approximately 1:1 relationship between RBC CA activity and Hb-O-2 offloading rate coincided with a similar allometric scaling exponent for RBC CA activity and maximum metabolic rate.

article,Acidification can directly affect olfaction in marine organisms,"Porteus, Cosima S. and Roggatz, Christina C. and Velez, Zelia and Hardege, Jorg D. and Hubbard, Peter C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In the past decade, many studies have investigated the effects of low pH/high CO2 as a proxy for ocean acidification on olfactory-mediated behaviours of marine organisms. The effects of ocean acidification on the behaviour of fish vary from very large to none at all, and most of the maladaptive behaviours observed have been attributed to changes in acid-base regulation, leading to changes in ion distribution over neural membranes, and consequently affecting the functioning of gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated (GABAergic) neurotransmission. Here, we highlight a possible additional mechanism by which ocean acidification might directly affect olfaction in marine fish and invertebrates. We propose that a decrease in pH can directly affect the protonation, and thereby, 3D conformation and charge distribution of odorants and/or their receptors in the olfactory organs of aquatic animals. This can sometimes enhance signalling, but most of the time the affinity of odorants for their receptors is reduced in high CO2/low pH; therefore, the activity of olfactory receptor neurons decreases as measured using electrophysiology. The reduced signal reception would translate into reduced activation of the olfactory bulb neurons, which are responsible for processing olfactory information in the brain. Over longer exposures of days to weeks, changes in gene expression in the olfactory receptors and olfactory bulb neurons cause these neurons to become less active, exacerbating the problem. A change in olfactory system functioning leads to inappropriate behavioural responses to odorants. We discuss gaps in the literature and suggest some changes to experimental design in order to improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms and their effects on the associated behaviours to resolve some current controversy in the field regarding the extent of the effects of ocean acidification on marine fish.",2021,10.1242/jeb.237941,224,14,NA,jeb237941,Invertebrates; Fish; Acidification; Carbon dioxide; Behaviour; Electrophysiology

Brain cooling reduced brain temperature by 2-6 degrees C below ambient water temperature and increased thermal tolerance by 0.5 and 0.6 degrees C on average relative to instrumented and uninstrumented controls, respectively, suggesting that direct thermal effects on brain neurons may contribute to setting upper thermal limits in fish.

article,High <i>P</i><sub>CO2</sub> does not alter the thermal plasticity of developing Pacific herring embryos during a marine heatwave,"Murray, Christopher S. and Klinger, Terrie",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Forage fish tend to respond strongly to environmental variability and therefore may be particularly sensitive to marine climate stressors. We used controlled laboratory experiments to assess the vulnerability of Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) embryos to the combined effects of high partial pressure of carbon dioxide (P-CO2) and a simulated marine heatwave. The two P-CO2, treatments reflected current conditions (similar to 550 mu atm) and a future extreme level (similar to 2300 mu atm). The dynamics of the heatwave (i.e. rate of onset: similar to 0.85 degrees C day(-1); maximum intensity: +4.4 degrees C) were modeled from the most extreme events detected by a long-term regional temperature dataset. Simultaneous exposure to these potential stressors did not affect embryo survival. However, the heatwave did elicit significant metabolic effects that included higher rates of routine metabolism (Q(10)=1.15-1.72). growth (Q(10)=1.87), rate of development to hatch (Q(10)=3.01) and yolk consumption (Q(10)=3.21), as well as a significant reduction in production efficiency (-10.8\%) and a three-fold increase in the rate of developmental anomalies. By contrast, high P-CO2, conditions produced comparatively small effects on vital rates, including a significant increase in time to hatch (+0.88 days) and a reduction in routine metabolic rate (-6.3\%) under the ambient temperature regime only. We found no evidence that high P-CO2, increased routine metabolic rate at either temperature. These results indicate that Pacific herring embryos possess sufficient physiological plasticity to cope with extreme seawater acidification under optimal and heatwave temperature conditions, although lingering metabolic inefficiencies induced by the heatwave may lead to important carryover effects in later life stages.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243501,225,5,NA,jeb243501,Ocean acidification; Extreme climatic events; Clupea pallasii; Early life history; Metabolic rates; Embryogenesis; Survival

Manymarine organisms are found in intertidal zones where they experience episodes of emersion (air exposure) daily as the tide rises and recedes. During episodes of emersion, the accumulation of metabolic carbon dioxide (CO2) leads to hypercapnia for many species. How this metabolic hypercapnia impacts the TGP response of marine organisms to climate change is unknown as all previous transgenerational studies have been done under subtidal conditions, where parents are constantly immersed. Here, we assess the capacity of the ecologically and economically important oyster, Saccostrea glomerata, to acclimate to elevated CO2 dependent on habitat, across its vertical distribution, from the subtidal to intertidal zone. Tidal habitat altered both the existing tolerance and transgenerational response of S. glomerata to elevated CO2. Overall, larvae fromparents conditioned in an intertidal habitat had a greater existing tolerance to elevated CO2 than larvae from parents conditioned in a subtidal habitat, but had a lower capacity for beneficial TGP following parental exposure to elevated CO2.

Here, we investigated how salinity acclimation affects whole-animal respiratory gas exchange during hypoxia using Fundulus heteroclitus, a fish that inhabits salt marshes where salinity and oxygen levels vary greatly. Salinity had marked effects on hypoxia tolerance, with fish acclimated to 11 and 35 ppt showing much longer time to loss of equilibrium (LOE) in hypoxia than 0 ppt-acclimated fish. Fish acclimated to 11 ppt (isosmotic salinity) exhibited the greatest capacity to regulate oxygen consumption rate ((M) over dot(O2)) under hypoxia, as measured through the regulation index (RI) and P-crit. At 35 ppt, fish had a higher routine metabolic rate (RMR) but a lower RI than fish at 11 ppt, but there were no differences in gill morphology, ventilation or blood O-2 transport properties between these groups. In contrast, 0 ppt-acclimated fish had the highest ventilation and lowest O-2 extraction efficiency in normoxia and hypoxia, indicating a higher ventilatory workload in order to maintain similar levels of (M) over doO(2).

Analysis of the existing data for interclass responses of ectothermic vertebrates shows different degrees of Pa-CO2 increases and pH declines with temperature between the classes, with reptiles>amphibians>fish. The Pa-CO2 at the temperature where maximal aerobic metabolism (<(V)over dot>(O2),(max)) is achieved is significantly and positively correlated with temperature for all vertebrate classes. For ectotherms, the Pa-CO2 where <(V)over dot>(O2),(max) is greatest is also correlated with <(V)over dot>(O2),(max), indicating there is an increased driving force for CO2 efflux that is lowest in fish, intermediate in amphibians and highest in reptiles. The pattern of increased Pa-CO2 and the resultant reduction of pHa in response to increased body temperature would serve to increase CO2 efflux, O-2 delivery and blood buffering capacity and maintain ventilatory scope. This represents a new hypothesis for the selective advantage of arterial pH regulation from a systems physiology perspective in addition to the advantages of maintenance of protein structure-function.",2018,10.1242/jeb.168955,221,1,NA,jeb168955,Pa-CO2; Blood acid-base balance; Alphastat; Temperature

S. and Calosi, P. and Calder-Potts, R. and Foggo, A. and Nightingale, G. and Widdicombe, S. and Spicer, J. I.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The distribution patterns of many species in the intertidal zone are partly determined by their ability to survive and recover from tidal emersion. During emersion, most crustaceans experience gill collapse, impairing gas exchange. Such collapse generates a state of hypoxemia and a hypercapnia-induced respiratory acidosis, leading to hyperlactaemia and metabolic acidosis. However, how such physiological responses to emersion are modified by prior exposure to elevated CO2 and temperature combinations, indicative of future climate change scenarios, is not known. We therefore investigated key physiological responses of velvet swimming crabs, Necora puber, kept for 14 days at one of four pCO(2)/temperature treatments (400 mu atm/10 degrees C, 1000 mu atm/10 degrees C, 400 mu atm/15 degrees C or 1000 mu atm/15 degrees C) to experimental emersion and recovery. Pre-exposure to elevated pCO(2) and temperature increased pre-emersion bicarbonate ion concentrations [}HCO3-], increasing resistance to short periods of emersion (90 min). However, there was still a significant acidosis following 180 min emersion in all treatments. The recovery of extracellular acid-base via the removal of extracellular pCO(2) and lactate after emersion was significantly retarded by exposure to both elevated temperature and pCO(2). If elevated environmental pCO(2) and temperature lead to slower recovery after emersion, then some predominantly subtidal species that also inhabit the low to mid shore, such as N. puber, may have a reduced physiological capacity to retain their presence in the low intertidal zone, ultimately affecting their bathymetric range of distribution, as well as the structure and diversity of intertidal assemblages.",2014,10.1242/jeb.089011,217,14,2499-2508,NA,Climate change; Ocean acidification; OA; Crustacea; Acid-base balance; Lactate

Using the changes in the respiratory exchange ratio (RER; CO2 excretion divided by O-2 uptake) as a proxy for changes in bodily gas stores, we quantified time constants in response to hypoxia and hypercapnia in Cuvier's dwarf caiman. We confirm distinct and prolonged changes in RER during and after exposure to hypoxia or hypercapnia. Gas exchange transients were evaluated in reference to predictions from a two-compartment model of CO2 exchange to quantify the effects of the levels of hypoxia and hypercapnia, duration of hypercapnia (30-300 min) and body temperature (23 versus 33 degrees C). For hypercapnia, the transients could be adequately fitted by two-phase exponential functions, and slow time constants (after 300 min hypercapnia) concurred reasonably well with modelling predictions. The slow time constants for the decays after hypercapnia were not affected by the level of hypercapnia, but they increased (especially at 23 degrees C) with exposure time, possibly indicating a temporal and slow recruitment of tissues for CO2 storage. In contrast to modelling predictions, elevated body temperature did not reduce the time constants, probably reflecting similar ventilation rates in transients at 23 and 33 degrees C. Our study reveals that attainment of steady state for gas exchange requires considerable time and this has important implications for designing experimental protocols when studying ventilatory control and conducting respirometry.",2016,10.1242/jeb.143537,219,23,3810-3821,NA,Steady state; Time constants; Gas exchange; Hypoxia; Hypercapnia; Reptile

In normoxic water, A. gigas is reported to satisfy 70-80\% of its O-2 requirement from the air while excreting 60-90\% of its CO2 to the water. If this pattern of gas exchange were to continue in severely hypoxic water, O-2 loss at the gills would be expected. We hypothesized therefore that partitioning of CO2 would shift to the air phase in severe aquatic hypoxia, eliminating the risk of branchial O2 loss. By adapting a respirometer designed to measure aquatic <(M) over dot>(O2)/<(M) over dot>(CO2), we were able to run intermittent closed respirometry on both water and air phase for both of these gasses as well as sample water for N-waste measurements (ammonia-N, urea-N) so as to calculate metabolic fuel utilization. In contrast to our prediction, we found that partitioning of CO2 excretion changed little between normoxia and severe hypoxia (83\% versus 77\% aquatic excretion, respectively) and at the same time there was no evidence of branchial O-2 loss in hypoxia. This indicates that A. gigas can utilize distinct transfer pathways for O-2 and CO2. Routine and standard <(M)over dot>(O2), N-waste excretion and metabolic fuel utilization did not change with water oxygenation. Metabolism was fuelled mostly by protein oxidation (53\%), while carbohydrates and lipids accounted for 27\% and 20\%, respectively.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243672,225,6,NA,jeb243672,Air-breathing fish; Anoxia; Fuel use; Gas exchange; Respirometry; Teleost
article,Evaporative cooling via panting and its metabolic and water balance costs for lizards in the American Southwest,"Loughran, Caleb L. and Wolf, Blair O.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In lizards there is considerable variation in the ability to dissipate environmental/endogenous heat loads through evaporative cooling via panting, which effects how long lizards can spend exposed to high solar heat loads. We recently described the differing capacities of lizards to depress body temperature (T-b) through evaporative cooling via panting. Here, we link panting and T-b depression with rates of evaporative water loss and its metabolic costs under high heat loads. We used flow-through respirometry to measure evaporative water loss rates and metabolism of 17 lizard species from the American Southwest while simultaneously measuring T-b. We exposed lizards to air temperatures (T-a) ranging from 35 degrees C to their critical thermal maximum (CTmax) while marking the onset of panting. We then estimated pre-panting Q(10) values for metabolism to partition increases in metabolism associated with the van't Hoff effect from the mechanical cost of panting with increasing heat loads. We found that evaporative cooling costs substantially varied among species, with panting effort significantly affecting lizards' evaporative capacity. Lizard evaporation rates ranged from 0.32 to 1.5 g H2O h(-1), with individuals losing as much as 6\% h(-1) of body mass while panting. Lizards also experienced an increase of up to 7.9-fold in metabolic rate while panting, although the overall energetic costs of panting remained relatively low compared with evaporative water costs. Across species, there was a significant positive relationship between the overall rate of evaporative heat loss and the maximum T-a-T-b gradient a species could maintain. While evaporative cooling may be an effective mechanism for reducing Tb and extending activity in hot environments for many species, it has significant metabolic and water balance costs that should be considered, as habitats with high environmental heat loads can be especially costly to an animal's water budgets.",2023,10.1242/jeb.243877,226,3,NA,jeb243877,Heat dissipation; Body temperature; Evaporative water loss; Metabolism; Thermoregulation; Respirometry
article,Water relations of an insular pit viper,"Sandfoss, Mark R. and Lillywhite, Harvey B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Colonization of novel habitats often requires plasticity or adaptation to local conditions. There is a critical need to maintain hydration in terrestrial environments having limited water. Atypical populations of Florida cottonmouth snakes, Agkistrodon conanti, inhabit continental islands with no permanent sources of fresh water. Here, we report investigations related to how these insular snakes maintain water balance considering the mainland conspecifics are semi-aquatic and typically associate with freshwater mesic habitats. We tested three hypotheses related to water relations of insular populations of cottonmouth snakes compared with those on the mainland. (1) Voluntary drinking of fresh water in free-ranging insular snakes should reflect a relationship to recency of rainfall more strongly than in mainland snakes. (2) Insular snakes will tolerate greater dehydration before drinking than will mainland snakes. (3) Insular snakes will avoid drinking seawater more strongly than will those from the mainland. Between 2001 and 2018, we quantitatively estimated the hydration status of 337 individual cottonmouth snakes from insular populations and 30 cottonmouth snakes from mainland Florida, as judged by the tendency of wild-caught snakes to drink fresh water immediately following capture. We found that insular cottonmouth snakes had a higher incidence of dehydration than did mainland cottonmouth snakes (64\% versus 23\%), and the hydration status of the insular snakes correlated with patterns of precipitation. We also determined experimentally the dehydration threshold for drinking fresh water in insular (meants.d. -5.64 +/- 4.3\%, n=34) and mainland cottonmouth snakes (-5.74 +/- 4.5\%, n=21), and these were not significantly different. Discrimination tests for drinking serially from a graded series of brackish water showed that mainland snakes did not discriminate against the highest brackish value (10.5 ppt or 30\% seawater), whereas insular snakes showed a preference for <15\% seawater. Naive neonates from insular and mainland cohorts behaved similarly. The preference of insular snakes for fresh water represents an important aspect of the maintenance of water balance that differs from the mainland conspecifics and is likely a habituated or adaptive response to dependence on rainfall.",2019,10.1242/jeb.204065,222,9,NA,jeb204065,Water relations; Florida cottonmouth; Island; Drinking; Dehydration; Brackish water

Given the importance of pH in the control of ventilation, we examined the CO2/H+ sensitivity of neurons from the locus coeruleus (LC) region of monitor lizard brainstems. Whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology was used to recordmembrane voltage in LC neurons in brainstem slices. Artificial cerebral spinal fluid equilibrated with 80\% O-2, 0.0-10.0\% CO2, balance N-2, was superfused across brainstem slices. Changes in firing rate of LC neurons were calculated from action potential recordings to quantify the chemosensitive response to hypercapnic acidosis. Our results demonstrate that the LC brainstem region contains neurons that can be excited or inhibited by, and/or are not sensitive to CO2 in V. exanthematicus. While few LC neurons were activated by hypercapnic acidosis (15\%), a higher proportion of the LC neurons responded by decreasing their firing rate during exposure to high CO2 at 20 degrees C (37\%); this chemosensitive response was no longer exhibited when the temperaturewas increased to 30 degrees C. Further, the proportion of chemosensitive LC neurons changed at 35 degrees C with a reduction in CO2-inhibited (11\%) neurons and an increase in CO2-activated (35\%) neurons. Expressing a high proportion of inhibited neurons at low temperature may provide insights into mechanisms underlying the temperature-dependent pH-stat regulatory strategy of savannah monitor lizards.",2016,10.1242/jeb.138800,219,18,2856-2864,NA,Chemosensitivity; Brainstem; CO2 inhibition; Ventilation; Ectothermic vertebrates; pH regulation
article,Reconciling the variability in the biological response of marine invertebrates to climate change,"Dellaert, Zoe and Putnam, Hollie M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"As climate change increases the rate of environmental change and the frequency and intensity of disturbance events, selective forces intensify. However, given the complicated interplay between plasticity and selection for ecological - and thus evolutionary - outcomes, understanding the proximate signals, molecular mechanisms and the role of environmental history becomes increasingly critical for eco-evolutionary forecasting. To enhance the accuracy of our forecasting, we must characterize environmental signals at a level of resolution that is relevant to the organism, such as the microhabitat it inhabits and its intracellular conditions, while also quantifying the biological responses to these signals in the appropriate cells and tissues. In this Commentary, we provide historical context to some of the longstanding challenges in global change biology that constrain our capacity for eco-evolutionary forecasting using reef-building corals as a focal model. We then describe examples of mismatches between the scales of external signals relative to the sensors and signal transduction cascades that initiate and maintain cellular responses. Studying cellular responses at this scale is crucial because these responses are the basis of acclimation to changing environmental conditions and the potential for environmental `memory' of prior or historical conditions through molecular mechanisms. To challenge the field, we outline some unresolved questions and suggest approaches to align experimental work with an organism's perception of the environment; these aspects are discussed with respect to human interventions.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245834,226,17,NA,jeb245834,Coral; Plasticity; Eco-evolutionary forecasting
article,Implications of heat exchange for a free-living endangered marsupial determined by non-invasive thermal imaging,"Cooper, Christine E. and Withers, Philip C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"We used thermal imagining and heat balance modelling to examine the thermal ecology of wild mammals, using the diurnal marsupial numbat (Myrmecobius fasciatus) as a model. Body surface temperature was measured using infra-red thermography at environmental wet and dry bulb temperatures of 11.7-29(degrees)C and 16.4-49.3(degrees)C, respectively; surface temperature varied for different body parts and with environmental temperature. Radiative and convective heat exchange varied markedly with environmental conditions and for various body surfaces reflecting their shapes, surface areas and projected areas. Both the anterior and posterior dorsolateral body areas functioned as thermal windows. Numbats in the shade had lower rates of solar radiative heat gain but non-solar avenues for radiative heat gain were substantial. Radiative gain was higher for black and lower for white stripes, but overall, the stripes had no thermal role. Total heat gain was generally positive (<4 to >20 W) and often greatly exceeded metabolic heat production (3-6 W). Our heat balance model indicates that high environmental heat loads limit foraging in open areas to as little as 10 min and that climate change may extend periods of inactivity, with implications for future conservation and management. We conclude that non-invasive thermal imaging is informative for modelling heat balance of free-living mammals.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246301,227,1,NA,jeb246301,Numbat; Myrmecobius; Myrmecophage; Diurnality; Thermography; Heat balance; Foraging
article,Beneficial effects of a heat wave: higher growth and immune components driven by a higher food intake,"Van Dievel, Marie and Stoks, Robby and Janssens, Lizanne",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"While heat waves will become more frequent and intense under global warming, the ability of species to deal with extreme weather events is poorly understood. We investigated how a heat wave influenced growth rate and investment in two immune components (phenoloxidase activity and melanin content) in larvae of two damselfly species, Ischnura elegans and Enallagma cyathigerum. Late instar larvae were kept at 18 degrees C (i.e. their average natural water temperature) or under a simulated long heat wave at 30 degrees C. To explain the heat wave effects, we quantified traits related to energy uptake (food intake and growth efficiency), energy expenditure (metabolic rate measured as activity of the electron transport system, ETS) and investment in energy storage (fat content). The two species differed in life strategy, with I. elegans having a higher growth rate, growth efficiency, ETS activity and fat content. In line with its preference for cooler water bodies, the heat wave was only lethal for E. cyathigerum. However, both species benefited from the heat wave by increasing growth rate, which can be explained by the higher increase in food intake than metabolic rate. This may also have contributed to the increased investment in energy storage and immune components under the heat wave. This mediatory role of food intake indicates the critical role of food availability and behaviour in shaping the impact of heat waves. Our results highlight the importance of including behavioural and physiological variables to unravel and predict the impact of extreme climate events on organisms.",2017,10.1242/jeb.158899,220,21,3908-3915,NA,Climate change; Extreme temperature; Immune investment; Performance; Thermal acclimation
article,Oxygen-limited thermal tolerance is seen in a plastron-breathing insect and can be induced in a bimodal gas exchanger,"Verberk, Wilco C. E. P. and Bilton, David T.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Thermal tolerance has been hypothesized to result from a mismatch between oxygen supply and demand. However, the generality of this hypothesis has been challenged by studies on various animal groups, including air-breathing adult insects. Recently, comparisons across taxa have suggested that differences in gas exchange mechanisms could reconcile the discrepancies found in previous studies. Here, we test this suggestion by comparing the behaviour of related insect taxa with different gas exchange mechanisms, with and without access to air. We demonstrate oxygen-limited thermal tolerance in air-breathing adults of the plastron-exchanging water bug Aphelocheirus aestivalis. Ilyocoris cimicoides, a related, bimodal gas exchanger, did not exhibit such oxygen-limited thermal tolerance and relied increasingly on aerial gas exchange with warming. Intriguingly, however, when denied access to air, oxygen-limited thermal tolerance could also be induced in this species. Patterns in oxygen-limited thermal tolerance were found to be consistent across life-history stages in these insects, with nymphs employing the same gas exchange mechanisms as adults. These results advance our understanding of oxygen limitation at high temperatures; differences in the degree of respiratory control appear to modulate the importance of oxygen in setting tolerance limits.",2015,10.1242/jeb.119560,218,13,2083-2088,NA,Global warming; Heat tolerance; Hypoxia; Multi stressor; OCLTT; Respiration physiology
article,"Cardiac responses to hypercapnia in larval zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>): the links between CO<sub>2</sub> chemoreception, catecholamines and carbonic anhydrase","Miller, Scott and Pollack, Jacob and Bradshaw, Julia and Kumai, Yusuke and Perry, Steve F.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The ontogeny of carbon dioxide (CO2) sensing in zebrafish (Danio rerio) has not been examined. In this study, CO2-mediated increases in heart rate were used to gauge the capacity of zebrafish larvae to sense CO2. CO2 is thought to be detected via neuroepithelial cells (NECs), which are homologous to mammalian carotid body glomus cells. Larvae at 5 days post-fertilization (d.p.f.) exhibited tachycardia when exposed for 30 min to 0.75\% CO2 (similar to 5.63 mmHg); at 7 d.p.f., tachycardia was elicited by 0.5\% CO2 (similar to 3.75 mmHg). Based on pharmacological evidence using beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) antagonists, and confirmed by beta(1)-AR translational gene knockdown using morpholinos, the reflex tachycardia accompanying hypercapnia was probably mediated by the interaction of catecholamines with cardiac beta(1) receptors. Because the cardiac response to hypercapnia was abolished by the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium, it is probable that the reflex cardio-acceleration was mediated by catecholamines derived from sympathetic adrenergic neurons. Owing to its likely role in facilitating intracellular acidification during exposure to hypercapnia, it was hypothesized that carbonic anhydrase (CA) is involved in CO2 sensing, and that inhibition of CA activity would blunt the downstream responses. Indeed, the cardiac response to hypercapnia (0.75\% CO2) was reduced in fish at 5 d.p.f. exposed to acetazolamide, a CA inhibitor, and in fish experiencing zCAc (CA2-like a) knockdown. Successful knockdown of zCAc was confirmed by CA activity measurements, western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Co-injection of embryos with zCAc morpholino and mRNA modified at the morpholino binding site restored normal levels of CA activity and protein levels, and restored (rescued) the usual cardiac responses to hypercapnia. These data, combined with the finding that zCAc is expressed in NECs located on the skin, suggest that the afferent limb of the CO2-induced cardiac reflex in zebrafish larvae is initiated by coetaneous CO2-sensing neuroepithelial cells.",2014,10.1242/jeb.107987,217,19,3569-3578,NA,Hypercapnia; Chemoreception; Neuroepithelial cell; Tachycardia cardiorespiratory control

It burrows into mud during the dry season, is highly tolerant of air exposure, and experiences severe hypoxia both in its natural habitat and in aquaculture. To study the ability of M. albus to compensate for respiratory acidosis, we implanted catheters to sample both arterial blood and urine during hypercapnia (4\% CO2) in either water or air, or during whole-animal air exposure. These hypercapnic challenges caused an immediate reduction in arterial pH, followed by progressive compensation through a marked elevation of plasma HCO3- over the course of 72 h. There was no appreciable rise in urinary acid excretion in fish exposed to hypercapnia in water, although urine pH was reduced and ammonia excretion did increase. In the air-exposed fish, however, hypercapnia was attended by a large elevation of ammonia in the urine and a large rise in titratable acid excretion. The time course of the increased renal acid excretion overlapped with the time period required to elevate plasma HCO3-, and we estimate that the renal compensation contributed significantly to whole-body acid-base compensation.",2019,10.1242/jeb.198259,222,9,NA,jeb198259,Respiratory acidosis; Arterial pH; Metabolic compensation; Kidney; Urine; Renal function; Air-breathing fish
article,Do naked mole rats accumulate a metabolic acidosis or an oxygen debt in severe hypoxia?,"Pamenter, Matthew E. and Dzal, Yvonne A. and Thompson, Illiam A. and Milsom, William K.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In severe hypoxia, most vertebrates increase anaerobic energy production, which results in the development of a metabolic acidosis and an O-2 debt that must be repaid during reoxygenation. Naked mole rats (NMRs) are among the most hypoxia-tolerant mammals, capable of drastically reducing their metabolic rate in acute hypoxia while staying active and alert. We hypothesized that a key component of remaining active is an increased reliance on anaerobic metabolism during severe hypoxia. To test this hypothesis, we exposed NMRs to progressive reductions in inspired O-2 (9-3\% O-2) followed by reoxygenation (21\% O-2) and measured breathing frequency, heart rate, behavioural activity, body temperature, metabolic rate, and also metabolic substrates and pH in blood and tissues. We found that NMRs exhibit robust metabolic rate depression in acute hypoxia, accompanied by declines in all physiological and behavioural variables examined. However, blood and tissue pH were unchanged, and tissue concentrations of ATP and phosphocreatine were maintained. NMRs increased their reliance on carbohydrates in hypoxia, and glucose was mobilized from the liver to the blood. Upon reoxygenation, NMRs entered into a coma-like state for similar to 15-20 min, during which metabolic rate was negligible and body temperature remained suppressed. However, an imbalance in the time taken for the rates of O-2 uptake ((V)over dot(O2)) and CO2 production ((V)over dot(CO2)) to return to normoxic levels during reoxygenation hint at the possibility that NMRs do utilize anaerobic metabolism during hypoxia but have a tissue and/ or blood buffering capacity that masks typical markers of metabolic acidosis, and that the synthesis of glucose from lactate, rather than lactate oxidation, is prioritized during recovery.",2019,10.1242/jeb.191197,222,3,NA,jeb191197,Hypoxic metabolic response; Hypoxic ventilatory response; Anaerobic metabolism; Thermoregulation; Behaviour; Metabolic fuel switching
article,"Future ocean warming may prove beneficial for the northern population of European seabass, but ocean acidification will not","Howald, Sarah and Cominassi, Louise and LeBayon, Nicolas and Claireaux, Guy and Mark, Felix C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The world's oceans are acidifying and warming as a result of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. The thermal tolerance of fish greatly depends on the cardiovascular ability to supply the tissues with oxygen. The highly oxygen-dependent heart mitochondria thus might play a key role in shaping an organism's tolerance to temperature. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of acute and chronic warming on the respiratory capacity of European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.) heart mitochondria. We hypothesized that acute warming would impair mitochondrial respiratory capacity, but be compensated for by life-time conditioning. Increasing P-CO2 may additionally cause shifts in metabolic pathways by inhibiting several enzymes of the cellular energy metabolism. Among other shifts in metabolic pathways, acute warming of heart mitochondria of cold life-conditioned fish increased leak respiration rate, suggesting a lower aerobic capacity to synthesize ATP with acute warming. However, thermal conditioning increased mitochondrial functionality, e.g. higher respiratory control ratios in heart mitochondria of warm life-conditioned compared with cold life-conditioned fish. Exposure to high P-CO2 synergistically amplified the effects of acute and long-term warming, but did not result in changes by itself. This high ability to maintain mitochondrial function under ocean acidification can be explained by the fact that seabass are generally able to acclimate to a variety of environmental conditions. Improved mitochondrial energy metabolism after warm conditioning could be due to the origin of this species in the warm waters of the Mediterranean. Our results also indicate that seabass are not yet fully adapted to the colder temperatures in their northern distribution range and might benefit from warmer temperatures in these latitudes.",2019,10.1242/jeb.213017,222,21,NA,jeb213017,Mitochondrial respiration; Developmental acclimation; Temperate teleost; Heart
article,Univariate and multivariate plasticity in response to incubation temperature in an Australian lizard,"De Jong, Madeleine J. and White, Craig R. and Wong, Bob B. M. and Chapple, David G.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Environments, particularly developmental environments, can generate a considerable amount of phenotypic variation through phenotypic plasticity. Plasticity in response to incubation temperature is well characterised in egg-laying reptiles. However, traits do not always vary independently of one another, and studies encompassing a broad range of traits spanning multiple categories are relatively rare but crucial to better understand whole-organism responses to environmental change, particularly if covariation among traits may constrain plasticity. In this study, we investigated multivariate plasticity in response to incubation across three temperatures in the delicate skink, Lampropholis delicata, and whether this was affected by covariation among traits. At approximately 1 month of age, a suite of growth, locomotor performance, thermal physiology and behavioural traits were measured. Plasticity in the multivariate phenotype of delicate skinks was distinct for different incubation temperatures. Cool temperatures drove shifts in growth, locomotor performance and thermal physiology, while hot temperatures primarily caused changes in locomotor performance and behaviour. These differences are likely due to variation in thermal reaction norms, as there was little evidence that covariation among traits or phenotypic integration influenced plasticity, and there was no effect of incubation temperature on the direction or strength of covariation. While there were broad themes in terms of which trait categories were affected by different incubation treatments, traits appeared to be affected independently by developmental temperature. Comparing reaction norms of a greater range of traits and temperatures will enable better insight into these patterns among trait categories, as well as the impacts of environmental change.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244352,225,22,NA,jeb244352,Developmental environment; Lampropholis delicata; Multivariate phenotype; Phenotypic integration; Phenotypic plasticity; Thermal physiology

Disrupted functioning of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors (ligand-gated chloride channels) is suggested to underlie CO2-induced behavioural changes in fish. However, the mechanisms underlying behavioural changes in marine invertebrates are poorly understood. We pharmacologically tested the role of GABA-, glutamate-, acetylcholine- and dopamine-gated chloride channels in CO2-induced behavioural changes in a cephalopod, the two-toned pygmy squid (Idiosepius pygmaeus). We exposed squid to ambient (similar to 450 mu atm) or elevated (similar to 1000 mu atm) CO2 for 7 days. Squid were treated with sham, the GABA(A) receptor antagonist gabazine or the non-specific GABA(A) receptor antagonist picrotoxin, before measurement of conspecific-directed behaviours and activity levels upon mirror exposure. Elevated CO2 increased conspecific-directed attraction and aggression, as well as activity levels. For some CO2-affected behaviours, both gabazine and picrotoxin had a different effect at elevated compared with ambient CO2, providing robust support for the GABA hypothesis within cephalopods. In another behavioural trait, picrotoxin but not gabazine had a different effect in elevated compared with ambient CO2, providing the first pharmacological evidence, in fish and marine invertebrates, for altered functioning of ligand-gated chloride channels, other than the GABA(A)R, underlying CO2-induced behavioural changes. For some other behaviours, both gabazine and picrotoxin had a similar effect in elevated and ambient CO2, suggesting altered function of ligand-gated chloride channels was not responsible for these CO2-induced changes. Multiple mechanisms may be involved, which could explain the variability in the CO2 and drug treatment effects across behaviours.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242335,224,13,NA,jeb242335,Ocean acidification; Squid; GABA; Ligand-gated chloride channels; Gabazine; Picrotoxin

This ability is due, in part. to the shell and skeleton simultaneously releasing calcium and magnesium carbonates, and sequestering lactate and H(+)to prevent lethal decreases in body fluid pH. We evaluated the effects of anoxic submergence at 3 degrees C on various material properties of painted turtle bone after 60, 130 and 167-170 days, and compared them with those of normoxic turtles held at the same temperature for the same time periods. To assess changes in the mechanical properties, beams (4x25 mm) were milled from the plastron and broken in a three-point flexural test. Bone mineral density, CO2 concentration (a measure of total bone HCO3-/CO32-) and elemental composition were measured using microcomputed tomography, HCO3-/CO32- titration and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), respectively. Tissue mineral density of the sampled bone beams was not significantly altered by 167-170 days of aquatic overwintering in anoxic or normoxic water, but bone CO2 and Mg were depleted in anoxic compared with normoxic turtles. At this time point, the plastron beams from anoxic turtles yielded at stresses that were significantly smaller and strains that were significantly greater than the plastron beams of normoxic turtles. When data from anoxic and normoxic turtles were pooled, plastron beams had a diminished elastic modulus after 167-170 days compared with those of control turtles sampled on day 1, indicating an effect of prolonged housing of the turtles in 3 degrees C water without access to basking sites. There were no changes in the mechanical properties of the plastron beams at any of the earlier time points in either group. We conclude that anoxic hibernation can weaken the painted turtle's plastron, but likely only after durations that exceed what it might naturally experience. The duration of aquatic overwintering, regardless of oxygenation state, is likely to be an important factor determining the mechanical properties of the turtle shell during spring emergence.",2018,10.1242/jeb.176990,221,18,NA,jeb176990,Bone; Buffering; Carbonate; Chrysemys picta bellii; Metabolic acidosis; MicroCT
article,Two lines of evidence for physiological control of insensible evaporative water loss by a tiny marsupial,"Cooper, Christine Elizabeth and Withers, Philip Carew",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"We present two independent lines of evidence that a tiny dasyurid marsupial, the ningaui (Ningaui spp.), has acute physiological control of its insensible evaporative water loss below and within thermoneutrality. Perturbation of the driving force for evaporation by varying relative humidity, and therefore the water vapour pressure deficit between the animal and the ambient air, does not have the expected physical effect on evaporative water loss. Exposure to a helox atmosphere also does not have the expected physical effect of increasing evaporative water loss for live ningauis (despite it having the expected effect of increasing heat loss for live ningauis), but increases evaporative water loss for dead ningauis. We discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of both experimental approaches for demonstrating physiological control of insensible evaporative water loss. An appreciation of physiological control is important because insensible evaporative water loss contributes to both water and heat balance, is clearly under environmental selection pressure, and potentially impacts the distribution of endotherms and their response to environmental change.",2020,10.1242/jeb.234450,223,23,NA,jeb234450,Dasyurid; Evaporation; Helox; Ningaui; Relative humidity; Temperature
article,"Effects of anoxia on ATP, water, ion and pH balance in an insect (<i>Locusta migratoria</i>)","Ravn, V, Mathias and Campbell, Jacob B. and Gerber, Lucie and Harrison, Jon F. and Overgaard, Johannes",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"When exposed to anoxia, insects rapidly go into a hypometabolic coma from which they can recover when exposed to normoxia again. However, prolonged anoxic bouts eventually lead to death in most insects, although some species are surprisingly tolerant. Anoxia challenges ATP, ion, pH and water homeostasis, but it is not clear how fast and to what degree each of these parameters is disrupted during anoxia, nor how quickly they recover. Further, it has not been investigated which disruptions are the primary source of the tissue damage that ultimately causes death. Here, we show, in the migratory locust (Locusta migratoria), that prolonged anoxic exposures are associated with increased recovery time, decreased survival, rapidly disrupted ATP and pH homeostasis and a slower disruption of ion ({[}K+] and {[}Na+]) and water balance. Locusts could not fully recover after 4 h of anoxia at 30 degrees C, and at this point hemolymph {[}K+] was elevated 5-fold and [}Na+] was decreased 2-fold, muscle {[}ATP] was decreased to <= 3\% of normoxic values, hemolymph pH had dropped 0.8 units from 7.3 to 6.5, and hemolymph water content was halved. These physiological changes are associated with marked tissue damage in vivo and we show that the isolated and combined effects of hyperkalemia, acidosis and anoxia can all cause muscle tissue damage in vitro to equally large degrees. When locusts were returned to normoxia after a moderate (2 h) exposure of anoxia, ATP recovered rapidly (15 min) and this was quickly followed by recovery of ion balance (30 min), while pH recovery took 2-24 h. Recovery of {[}K+] and {[}Na+] coincided with the animals exiting the comatose state, but recovery to an upright position took similar to 90 min and was not related to any of the physiological parameters examined.",2019,10.1242/jeb.190850,222,5,NA,jeb190850,Anoxia tolerance; Anoxic stress; Ion homeostasis; Extracellular potassium; Migratory locust

Females were more desiccation tolerant than males, surviving for longer periods than males under all experimental conditions. In addition, younger adults were more tolerant of desiccation than older groups. Both species showed reduced water loss rate (WLR) as the primary mechanism by which they tolerate desiccation. Although A. arabiensis is often considered to be the more arid-adapted of the two species, it showed lower survival times and higher WLR than A. funestus.

Although there is a wealth of research on the plasticity of thermal and hydric physiology in response to temperature acclimation, there is a comparative gap for research on acclimation to different hydric regimes, as well as the interaction between water and temperature. We sought to fill this gap by acclimating western fence lizards (Sceloporus occidentalis) to experimental climate conditions (crossed design of hot or cool, dry or humid) for 8 days, and measuring cutaneous evaporative water loss (CEWL), plasma osmolality, hematocrit and body mass before and after acclimation. CEWL changed plastically in response to the different climates, with lizards acclimated to hot humid conditions experiencing the greatest increase in CEWL. Change in CEWL among individuals was negatively related to treatment vapor pressure deficit and positively related to treatment water vapor pressure. Plasma osmolality, hematocrit and body mass all showed greater changes in response to temperature than to humidity or vapor pressure deficit. CEWL and plasma osmolality were positively related across treatment groups before acclimation and within treatment groups after acclimation, but the two variables showed different responses to acclimation, suggesting that they are interrelated but governed by different mechanisms. This study is among few that assess more than one metric of hydric physiology and that test the interactive effects of temperature and humidity. Such measurements will be essential for predictive models of activity and survival for animals under climate change.",2023,10.1242/jeb.246459,226,20,NA,jeb246459,Hematocrit; Osmoregulation; Plasma osmolality; Sceloporus occidentalis; Skin; Vapor pressure deficit

In hypoxia, changes in gill blood flow patterns and functional surface area that increase gas transfer can promote an exacerbation in ion and water flux. Our goal was to determine whether the osmorespiratory compromise is flexible, depending on environmental salinity (fresh, isosmotic and sea water) and oxygen levels (hypoxia) in euryhaline killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus. Plasma ion concentrations were minimally affected by hypoxia, indicating a maintenance of osmoregulatory homeostasis. In freshwater killifish, hypoxia exposure reduced branchial Na+/K+-ATPase and NEM-sensitive ATPase activities, as well as diffusive water flux rates. Unidirectional Na+ influx and Na+ efflux decreased during hypoxia in freshwater, but net Na+ flux remained unchanged. Net loss rates of Cl-, K+. and ammonia were also attenuated in hypoxia, suggesting both transcellular and paracellular reductions in permeability. These reductions appeared to be regulated phenomena as fluxes were restored immediately in normoxia. Na+ flux rates increased during hypoxia in 11 ppt, but decreased in 35 ppt, the latter suggesting a similar response to hypoxia to that in freshwater. In summary, freshwater and seawater killifish experience a reduction in gill permeability, as seen in other hypoxia-tolerant species. Fish acclimated to isosmotic salinity increased Na+ influx and efflux rates, as well as paracellular permeability in hypoxia, responses in accord with the predictions of the classic osmorespiratory compromise.",2020,10.1242/jeb.216309,223,13,NA,jeb216309,Ion regulation; Respiratory gas exchange; Mummichog; Trade-offs

We investigated a proposed mechanism of Rb-86 turnover, its analogy to K+, by comparing the turnover of Rb-86 in a model insect, the rhinoceros beetle Xylotrupes gideon, fed a diet of plum jam or plum jam enriched with K+ or Rb+. The turnover of Rb-86 in the beetles on the K+ and the Rb+ diets was higher than that for beetles on the jam diet (F-2,F-311=32.4; P=1.58x10(-13)). We also exposed the beetles to different ambient temperatures to induce differences in metabolic rate (V-CO2) while feeding them the jam and K+ diets. V-CO2 was higher at higher ambient temperature (T-a) for both jam (F-1,F-11=14.56; P=0.003) and K+ (F-1,F-8=15.39; P=0.004) dietary groups, and the turnover of Rb-86 was higher at higher T-a for both jam (F-1,F-11=10.80; P=0.007) and K+ (F-1,F-8=12.34; P=0.008) dietary groups. There was a significant relationship between Rb-86 turnover and V-CO2 for both the jam (F-1,F-11=35.00; P=1.0x10(-3)) and the K+ (F-1,F-8=64.33; P=4.3x10(-5)) diets, but the relationship differed between the diets (F1,19=14.07; P=0.001), with a higher Rb-86 turnover in beetles on the K+-enriched than on the jam diet at all T-a. We conclude that Rb-86 turnover is related to K+ metabolism, and that this is the mechanism of the relationship between Rb-86 turnover and V-CO2. Studies relating Rb-86 turnover to V-CO2 should maintain dietary {[}K+] as close as possible to that of natural diets for the most accurate calibrations for free-ranging animals.",2014,10.1242/jeb.096222,217,7,1040-1045,NA,Rb-86 k(b); Xylotrupes gideon; Insect; Isotope turnover; Metabolic rate

Little is known about paracellular transport (via intercellular junctions) in corals and other marine calcifiers. Here, we investigated whether the permeability of the paracellular pathway varied in different environmental conditions in the coral Stylophora pistillata. Using the fluorescent dye calcein, we characterised the dynamics of calcein influx from seawater to the ECM and showed that increases in paracellular permeability (leakiness) induced by hyperosmotic treatment could be detected by changes in calcein influx rates. We then used the calcein-imaging approach to investigate the effects of two environmental stressors on paracellular permeability: seawater acidification and temperature change. Under conditions of seawater acidification (pH 7.2) known to depress pH in the ECM and the calcifying cells of S. pistillata, we observed a decrease in half-times of calcein influx, indicating increased paracellular permeability. By contrast, high temperature (31 degrees C) had no effect, whereas low temperature (20 degrees C) caused decreases in paracellular permeability. Overall, our study establishes an approach to conduct further in vivo investigation of paracellular transport and suggests that changes in paracellular permeability could form an uncharacterised aspect of the physiological response of S. pistillata to seawater acidification.",2020,10.1242/jeb.227074,223,17,NA,jeb227074,Scleractinia; Climate change; Calcification; Ocean acidification; Temperature; Physiology; Acid-base; Carbon dioxide; Biomineralisation
article,"Substantial heat tolerance acclimation capacity in tropical thermophilic snails, but to what benefit?","Marshall, David J. and Brahim, Amalina and Mustapha, Nurshahida and Dong, Yunwei and Sinclair, Brent J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The theory for thermal acclimation of ectotherms suggests that (1) heat tolerance is traded off for thermal acclimation in thermophilic species and that (2) plasticity is constrained in tropically distributed ectotherms, which commonly experience relatively thermally stable environments. We observed substantial heat tolerance plasticity in a test of this theory using tropical, thermophilic marine intertidal snails that inhabit extremely hot and highly variable thermal environments. The implication of these results is that plasticity selection is largely driven by habitat temperature conditions irrespective of basal heat tolerance or latitude. However, heat tolerance of field-fresh snails was comparable with that of laboratory warm-acclimated snails, suggesting that snails in the field may often be unable to improve heat hardening with further environmental warming. These findings suggest that field referencing is crucial to using laboratory-measured acclimation capacity when inferring climate warming vulnerability in ectotherms, and overall they question how well current thermal biology theory predicts the outcomes of global change in intertidal environments.",2018,10.1242/jeb.187476,221,22,NA,jeb187476,Climate change; Gastropods; Heat stress; Latitudinal gradients; Thermal adaptation
article,Cardiorespiratory adjustments to chronic environmental warming improve hypoxia tolerance in European perch (<i>Perca fluviatilis</i>),"Ekstrom, Andreas and Sundell, Erika and Morgenroth, Daniel and McArley, Tristan and Gardmark, Anna and Huss, Magnus and Sandblom, Erik",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Aquatic hypoxia will become increasingly prevalent in the future as a result of eutrophication combined with climate warming. While short-term warming typically constrains fish hypoxia tolerance, many fishes cope with warming by adjusting physiological traits through thermal acclimation. Yet, little is known about how such adjustments affect tolerance to hypoxia. We examined European perch (Perca fluviatilis) from the Biotest enclosure (23 degrees C, Biotest population), a unique similar to 1 km(2) ecosystem artificially warmed by cooling water from a nuclear power plant, and an adjacent reference site (16-18 degrees C, reference population). Specifically, we evaluated howacute and chronic warming affect routine oxygen consumption rate (<(M)over dot>(O2,routine)) and cardiovascular performance in acute hypoxia, alongside assessment of the thermal acclimation of the aerobic contribution to hypoxia tolerance (critical O-2 tension for <(M)over dot>(O2,routine): P-crit) and absolute hypoxia tolerance (O-2 tension at loss of equilibrium; P-LOE). Chronic adjustments (possibly across lifetime or generations) alleviated energetic costs of warming in Biotest perch by depressing <(M)over dot>(O2,routine) and cardiac output, and by increasing blood O-2 carrying capacity relative to reference perch acutely warmed to 23 degrees C. These adjustments were associated with improved maintenance of cardiovascular function and <(M)over dot>(O2,routine) in hypoxia (i.e. reduced P-crit). However, while P-crit was only partially thermally compensated in Biotest perch, they had superior absolute hypoxia tolerance (i.e. lowest P-LOE) relative to reference perch irrespective of temperature. We show that European perch can thermally adjust physiological traits to safeguard and even improve hypoxia tolerance during chronic environmental warming. This points to cautious optimism that eurythermal fish species may be resilient to the imposition of impaired hypoxia tolerance with climate warming.",2021,10.1242/jeb.241554,224,6,NA,jeb241554,Cardiac performance; Global warming; Hypoxia tolerance; Teleost fish; Thermal acclimation
article,Rates of hypoxia induction alter mechanisms of O<sub>2</sub> uptake and the critical O<sub>2</sub> tension of goldfish,"Regan, Matthew D. and Richards, Jeffrey G.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The rate of hypoxia induction (RHI) is an important but overlooked dimension of environmental hypoxia that may affect an organism's survival. We hypothesized that, compared with rapid RHI, gradual RHI will afford an organism more time to alter plastic phenotypes associated with O-2 uptake and subsequently reduce the critical O-2 tension (P-crit) of the rate of O-2 uptake (M-O2). We investigated this by determining Pcrit values for goldfish exposed to short (similar to 24 min), typical (similar to 84 min) and long (similar to 480 min) duration P-crit trials to represent different RHIs. Consistent with our predictions, long duration P-crit trials yielded significantly lower P-crit values (1.0-1.4 kPa) than short and typical duration trials, which did not differ (2.6 +/- 0.3 and 2.5 +/- 0.2 kPa, respectively). Parallel experiments revealed these timerelated shifts in P(cri)t were associated with changes to aspects of the O-2 transport cascade that took place over the hypoxia exposures: gill surface areas and haemoglobin-O-2 binding affinities were significantly higher in fish exposed to gradual RHIs over 480 min than fish exposed to rapid RHIs over 60 min. Our results also revealed that the choice of respirometric technique (i. e. closed versus intermittent) does not affect Pcrit or routine M-O2, despite the significantly reduced water pH and elevated CO2 and ammonia levels measured following closed-circuit P-crit trials of similar to 90 min. Together, our results demonstrate that gradual RHIs result in alterations to physiological parameters that enhance O-2 uptake in hypoxic environments. An organism's innate P-crit is therefore most accurately determined using rapid RHIs (< 90 min) so as to avoid the confounding effects of hypoxic acclimation.",2017,10.1242/jeb.154948,220,14,2536-2544,NA,Critical O-2 tension; Environmental change; Goldfish; Hypoxia; Metabolic responses; Plasticity

The intertidal zone porcelain crab, Petrolisthes cinctipes, was used to study physiological responses to low pH in embryonic, larval and newly recruited juvenile life-history stages. In these crabs, embryonic development occurs in the pH-variable intertidal zone (pH 6.9-9.5), larvae mature in the more stable pelagic environment (pH 7.9-8.2), and juvenile crabs settle back into the pH-variable intertidal zone. We examined survival, cardiac performance, energetics and morphology in embryonic, larval and juvenile crabs exposed to two pH conditions (pH 7.9 and 7.6). Embryos and larvae were split by brood between the pH treatments for 9 days to examine brood-specific responses to low pH. Hatching success did not differ between pH conditions, but ranged from 30\% to 95\% among broods. Larval survival was not affected by acidification, but juvenile survival was reduced by similar to 30\% after longer (40 days) exposure to low pH. Embryonic and larval heart rates were 37\% and 20\% lower at low pH, and there was a brood-specific response in embryos. Embryos did not increase in volume under acidified conditions, compared with a 15\% increase in ambient conditions. We conclude that sustained exposure to low pH could be detrimental to P. cinctipes embryos and larvae despite the fact that embryos are regularly exposed to naturally fluctuating hypercapnic water in the intertidal zone.

We compared the influence of external salinity on the oxygen consumption rates (M O2) of three species of freshwater insects, one snail and two crustaceans. Consistent with available literature, we found a clear decrease in M O2 with increasing salinity in the snail Elimia sp. and crustaceans Hyalella azteca and Gammarus pulex (r5=-0.90, P=0.03). However, we show here for the first time that metabolic rate was unchanged by salinity in the aquatic insects, whereas ion transport rates were positively correlated with higher salinities. In contrast, when we examined the ionic influx rates in the freshwater snail and crustaceans, we found that Ca uptake rates were highest under the most dilute conditions, while Na uptake rates increased with salinity. In G. pulex exposed to a serially diluted ion matrix, Ca uptake rates were positively associated with M O2 (r5=-0.93, P=0.02). This positive association between Ca uptake rate and M O2 was also observed when conductivity was held constant but Ca concentration was manipulated (1.7-17.3 mg Ca l-1) (r5=0.94, P=0.05). This finding potentially implicates the cost of calcium uptake as a driver of increased metabolic rate under dilute conditions in organisms with calcified exoskeletons and suggests major phyletic differences in osmoregulatory physiology.

This study analyzed the long-term response of the sea bream (Sparus aurata L.) to relevant changes of external salinity (12, 35 and 55. p.p.t.), focusing on the anterior intestine and in the less-often studied rectum. Intestinal water absorption, epithelial HCO3- secretion and gene expression of the main molecular mechanisms (SLC26a6, SLC26a3, SLC4a4, atp6v1b, CFTR, NKCC1 and NKCC2) involved in Cl- and HCO3- movements were examined. The anion transporters SLC26a6 and SLC26a3 are expressed severalfold higher in the anterior intestine, while the expression of Atp6v1b (V-type H+-ATPase beta-subunit) is severalfold higher in the rectum. Prolonged exposure to altered external salinity was without effect on water absorption but was associated with concomitant changes in intestinal fluid content, epithelial HCO3- secretion and salinity-dependent expression of SLC26a6, SLC26a3 and SLC4a4 in the anterior intestine. However, the most striking response to external salinity was obtained in the rectum, where a 4- to 5-fold increase in water absorption was paralleled by a 2- to 3-fold increase in HCO3- secretion in response to a salinity of 55. p.p.t. In addition, the rectum of high salinity-acclimated fish shows a sustained (and enhanced) secretory current (I-sc), identified in vitro in Ussing chambers and confirmed by the higher expression of CFTR and NKCC1 and by immunohistochemical protein localization.

M. and Sokolov, Eugene P. and Bock, Christian and Sokolova, Inna M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Coastal environments commonly experience fluctuations in salinity and hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) stress that can negatively affect mitochondrial functions of marine organisms. Although intertidal bivalves are adapted to these conditions, the mechanisms that sustain mitochondrial integrity and function are not well understood. We determined the rates of respiration and reactive oxygen species (ROS) efflux in the mitochondria of oysters, Crassostrea gigas, acclimated to high (33 psu) or low (15 psu) salinity, and exposed to either normoxic conditions (control; 21\% O-2) or short-term hypoxia (24 h at <0.01\% O-2) and subsequent reoxygenation (1.5 h at 21\% O-2). Further, we exposed isolated mitochondria to anoxia in vitro to assess their ability to recover from acute (similar to 10 min) oxygen deficiency (<0.01\% O-2). Our results showed that mitochondria of oysters acclimated to high or low salinity did not show severe damage and dysfunction during H/R stress, consistent with the hypoxia tolerance of C. gigas. However, acclimation to low salinity led to improved mitochondrial performance and plasticity, indicating that 15 psu might be closer to the metabolic optimum of C. gigas than 33 psu. Thus, acclimation to low salinity increased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation rate and coupling efficiency and stimulated mitochondrial respiration after acute H/R stress. However, elevated ROS efflux in the mitochondria of low-salinity-acclimated oysters after acute H/R stress indicates a possible tradeoff of higher respiration. The high plasticity and stress tolerance of C. gigas mitochondria may contribute to the success of this invasive species and facilitate its further expansion into brackish regions such as the Baltic Sea.",2023,10.1242/jeb.246164,226,15,NA,jeb246164,Hypoxia tolerance; Mitochondria; Aerobic capacity; High-resolution respirometry; Oxidative stress marker; AmplexRed
article,"The effects of elevated temperature on the sexual traits, immunology and survivorship of a tropical ectotherm","Breckels, Ross D. and Neff, Bryan D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projected an average global air temperature increase of 1.1-6.4 degrees C by the end of the 21st century. Although the tropics are predicted to experience less extreme temperature increases than regions of higher latitude, tropical ectotherms live close to their thermal limits, and are thus particularly vulnerable to increases in temperature. In this study, we examined how predicted patterns of global warming will affect survival and sexual traits in the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata). Guppies were exposed from birth to one of four temperature treatments: 23, 25 (control), 28 or 30 degrees C. We measured brood survival and, at sexual maturity, male ornamentation, sperm traits and immune response. Our results show that increases in temperature result in guppies that have shorter, slower sperm but that there is an optimum temperature for ornamental hue at 28 degrees C. Given the importance of sperm quality for reproduction, these results suggest population viability could be affected by warming. However, we found no difference in brood survival or immune response to a novel antigen across the treatments, indicating that survival may not be as vulnerable as previously thought. Overall, our data suggest that male sexual traits, and in particular sperm performance, are more sensitive than survival to a warming environment.",2013,10.1242/jeb.084962,216,14,2658-2664,NA,global warming; phenotypic plasticity; Poecilia reticulata; survival; sperm; ornamentation; immune response
article,Thermal spikes from the urban heat island increase mortality and alter physiology of lizard embryos,"Hall, Joshua M. and Warner, Daniel A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Effects of global change (i.e. urbanization, climate change) on adult organisms are readily used to predict the persistence of populations. However, effects on embryo survival and patterns of development are less studied, even though embryos are particularly sensitive to abiotic conditions that are altered by global change (e.g. temperature). In reptiles, relatively warm incubation temperatures increase developmental rate and often enhance fitness-relevant phenotypes, but extremely high temperatures cause death. Due to the urban heat island effect, human-altered habitats (i.e. cities) potentially create unusually warm nest conditions that differ from adjacent natural areas in both mean and extreme temperatures. Such vanation may exert selection pressures on embryos. To address this, we measured soil temperatures in places where the Puerto Rican crested anole lizard (Anolis cristatellus) nests in both city and forest habitats. We bred anoles in the laboratory and subjected their eggs to five incubation treatments that mimicked temperature regimes from the field, three of which included brief exposure to extremely high temperatures (i.e. thermal spikes) measured in the city. We monitored growth and survival of hatchlings in the laboratory for 3 months and found that warmer, city temperatures increase developmental rate, but brief, thermal spikes reduce survival. Hatchling growth and survival were unaffected by incubation treatment. The urban landscape can potentially create selection pressures that influence organisms at early (e.g. embryo) and late life stages. Thus, research aimed at quantifying the impacts of urbanization on wildlife populations must include multiple life stages to gain a comprehensive understanding of this important aspect of global change.",2018,10.1242/jeb.181552,221,14,NA,NA,Anolis; Embryonic development; Global change; Heart rate; Plasticity; Thermal adaptation; Urbanization
article,Foraging strategy of wasps - optimisation of intake rate or energetic efficiency?,"Kovac, Helmut and Stabentheiner, Anton and Brodschneider, Robert",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In endothermic wasps, foraging is an expensive activity. To maximise the benefit for the colony, wasps can optimise either the intake rate or energetic efficiency of a foraging trip. We investigated the foraging behaviour of vespine wasps under vanable environmental and reward conditions. We trained them to forage for 0.5 mol l(-1) sucrose solution from an artificial flower in a flow-through respiratory measurement chamber, and simultaneously measured their body temperature using infrared thermography to investigate interactions between thermoregulation and energetics. Measurement of carbon dioxide release (for energetic calculations) and load mass enabled the direct determination of foraging efficiency. An unlimited reward increased the wasps' energetic effort to increase the suction speed through high body temperatures. With reduced reward (limited flow), when an increased body temperature could not increase suction speed, the wasps decreased their body temperature to reduce the metabolic effort. Solar heat gain was used differently, either to increase body temperature without additional metabolic effort or to save energy. The foraging efficiency was mainly determined by the flow rate, ambient temperature and solar heat gain. In shade, an unlimited sucrose flow and a high ambient temperature yielded the highest energetic benefit. A limited flow reduced foraging efficiency in the shade, but only partly in sunshine. Solar radiation boosted the efficiency at all reward rates. Wasps responded flexibly to varying reward conditions by maximising intake rate at unlimited flow and switching to the optimisation of foraging efficiency when the intake rate could not be enhanced due to a limited flow rate.",2018,10.1242/jeb.174169,221,14,NA,NA,Energetics; Foraging; Motivation; Metabolic rate; Thermoregulation; Wasps
article,Avian thermoregulation in the heat: is evaporative cooling more economical in nocturnal birds?,"O'Connor, Ryan S. and Smit, Ben and Talbot, William A. and Gerson, Alexander R. and Brigham, R. Mark and Wolf, Blair O. and McKechnie, Andrew E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Evaporative cooling is a prerequisite for avian occupancy of hot, arid environments, and is the only avenue of heat dissipation when air temperatures (T-a) exceed body temperature (T-b). Whereas diurnal birds can potentially rehydrate throughout the day, nocturnal species typically forgo drinking between sunrise and sunset. We hypothesized that nocturnal birds have evolved reduced rates of evaporative water loss (EWL) and more economical evaporative cooling mechanisms compared with diurnal species, permitting nocturnal species to tolerate extended periods of intense heat without becoming lethally dehydrated. We used phylogenetically informed regressions to compare EWL and evaporative cooling efficiency {[}ratio of evaporative heat loss (EHL) and metabolic heat production (MHP); EHL/MHP] among nocturnal and diurnal birds at high T-a. We analyzed variation in three response variables: (1) slope of EWL at T-a between 40 and 46 degrees C, (2) EWL at T-a=46 degrees C and (3) EHU MHP at T-a=46 degrees C. Nocturnality emerged as a weak, negative predictor, with nocturnal species having slightly shallower slopes and reduced EWL compared with diurnal species of similar mass. In contrast, nocturnal activity was positively correlated with EHL/MHP, indicating a greater capacity for evaporative cooling in nocturnal birds. However, our analysis also revealed conspicuous differences among nocturnal taxa. Caprimulgids and Australian owlet-nightjars had shallower slopes and reduced EWL compared with similarly sized diurnal species, whereas owls had EWL rates comparable to those of diurnal species. Consequently, our results did not unequivocally demonstrate more economical cooling among nocturnal birds. Owls predominately select refugia with cooler microclimates, but the more frequent and intense heat waves forecast for the 21st century may increase microclimate temperatures and the necessity for active heat dissipation, potentially increasing owls' vulnerability to dehydration and hyperthermia.",2018,10.1242/jeb.181420,221,17,NA,jeb181420,Caprimulgiformes; Dehydration tolerance; Diurnal; Evaporative water loss; Heat tolerance; Strigiformes
article,Rapid-warming tolerance correlates with tolerance to slow warming but not growth at non-optimal temperatures in zebrafish,"Asheim, Eirik R. and Andreassen, Anna H. and Morgan, Rachael and Jutfelt, Fredrik",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Global warming is predicted to increase both acute and prolonged thermal challenges for aquatic ectotherms. Severe short- and medium-term thermal stress over hours to days may cause mortality, while longer sub-lethal thermal challenges may cause performance declines. The inter-relationship between the responses to short, medium and longer thermal challenges is unresolved. We asked if the same individuals are tolerant to both rapid and slow warming challenges, a question that has so far received little attention. Additionally, we investigated the possibility of a thermal syndrome where individuals in a population are distributed along a warm-type to cold-type axis. We tested whether different thermal traits correlate across individuals by acclimating 200 juvenile zebrafish (Danio rerio) to sub- or supra-optimal temperatures for growth (22 and 34 degrees C) for 40 days and measuring growth and thermal tolerance at two different warming rates. We found that tolerance to rapid warming correlated with tolerance to slow warming in the 22 degrees C treatment. However, individual tolerance to neither rapid nor slow warming correlated with growth at the supra-optimal temperature. We thus find some support for a syndrome-like organisation of thermal traits, but the lack of connection between tolerance and growth performance indicates a restricted generality of a thermal syndrome. The results suggest that tolerance to rapid warming may share underlying physiological mechanisms with tolerance to slower heating, and indicate that the relevance of acute critical thermal tolerance extends beyond the rapid ramping rates used to measure them.",2020,10.1242/jeb.229195,223,23,NA,jeb229195,Climate change; CTmax; Growth; Teleost; Thermal biology; Thermal syndrome; Thermal tolerance; Warming rates
article,Keeping your cool: thermoregulatory performance and plasticity in desert cricetid rodents,"Ramirez, Richard W. and Riddell, Eric A. and Beissinger, Steven R. and Wolf, Blair O.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Small mammals in hot deserts often avoid heat via noctumality and fossoriality, and are thought to have a limited capacity to dissipate heat using evaporative cooling. Research to date has focused on thermoregulatory responses to air temperatures (T-a) below body temperature (T-b). Consequently, the thermoregulatory performance of small mammals exposed to high T-a is poorly understood, particularly responses across geographic and seasonal scales. We quantified the seasonal thermoregulatory performance of four cricetid rodents (Neotoma albigula, Neotoma lepida, Peromyscus eremicus, Peromyscus crinitus) exposed to high T-a, at four sites in the Mojave Desert. We measured metabolism, evaporative water loss and T-b using flow-through respirometry. When exposed to T-a >= T-b, rodents showed steep increases in T-b, copious salivation and limited evaporative heat dissipation. Most individuals were only capable of maintaining T-a -T-b gradients of similar to 1 degrees, resulting in heat tolerance limits (HTLs) in the range T-a =43-45 degrees C. All species exhibited a thermoneutral T-b of similar to 35-36 degrees C, and T-b increased to maximal levels of similar to 43 degrees C. Metabolic rates and rates of evaporative water loss increased steeply in all species as T-a approached T-b. We also observed significant increases in resting metabolism and evaporative water loss from summer to winter at T-a within and above the thermoneutral zone. In contrast, we found few differences in the thermoregulatory performance within species across sites. Our results suggest that cricetid rodents have a limited physiological capacity to cope with environmental temperatures that exceed T-b and that a rapidly warming environment may increasingly constrain their nocturnal activity.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243131,225,5,NA,jeb243131,Cricetid; High air temperatures; Water balance; Hyperthermia; Metabolism
article,Carbonic anhydrase expression in the branchial ionocytes of rainbow trout,"Brannen, Michael and Gilmour, Kathleen M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) exposed to acid-base challenges activate branchial mechanisms for the excretion of acid-base equivalents. Current models of branchial acid-base excretion in freshwater rainbow trout propose two main ionocyte types: the peanut lectin agglutinin-positive (PNA(+)) mitochondrion-rich cell or ionocyte is believed to secrete HCO3- in exchange for Cl-, whereas H+ secretion is thought to occur across PNA(-) ionocytes in exchange for Na+. Both HCO3- and H+ are supplied by intracellular hydration of CO2 catalysed by cytosolic carbonic anhydrase (CAc). Immunohistochemical approaches revealed that under control conditions, CAc was detectable in 92.3 +/- 1.0\% (N=11) of PNA(-) ionocytes, and the abundance of PNA(-) ionocytes increased in response to systemic acidosis elicited by 72 h exposure to water of low pH (nominally pH 4.5), hypercapnia (1\% CO2, nominally 7.6 Torr) or hyperoxia (achieved by gassing water with pure O-2), as did the abundance of PNA(-) ionocytes that exhibited immunofluorescence for CAc. However, just 4.3 +/- 0.6\% (N=11) of PNA+ ionocytes expressed detectable CAc under control conditions. Marked increases in the abundance of CAc-positive PNA(+) ionocytes were detected following exposure of trout to a base load via recovery from hypercapnia or base infusion (72 h infusion with 140 mmol l(-1) NaHCO3). The percentage of CAc-positive PNA+ ionocytes also was increased in trout treated with cortisol (10 mg kg(-1) hydrocortisone 21-hemisuccinate daily for 7 days). These results suggest that regulation of CA within PNA(+) ionocytes and/or the abundance of CAc-positive PNA(+) ionocytes plays a role in activating base secretion in response to systemic alkalosis.",2018,10.1242/jeb.164582,221,5,NA,jeb164582,Oncorhynchus mykiss; Gill; Ionic regulation; Acid-base; Cortisol
article,Changes in body surface temperature reveal the thermal challenge associated with catastrophic moult in captive gentoo penguins,"Lewden, Agnes and du Fretay, Tristan Halna and Stier, Antoine",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Once a year, penguins undergo a catastrophic moult, replacing their entire plumage during a fasting period on land or on sea-ice during which time individuals can lose 45\% of their body mass. In penguins, new feather synthesis precedes the loss of old feathers, leading to an accumulation of two feather layers (double coat) before the old plumage is shed. We hypothesized that the combination of the high metabolism required for new feather synthesis and the potentially high thermal insulation linked to the double coat could lead to a thermal challenge requiring additional peripheral circulation to thermal windows to dissipate the extra heat. To test this hypothesis, we measured the surface temperature of different body regions of captive gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) throughout the moult under constant environmental conditions. The surface temperature of the main body trunk decreased during the initial stages of the moult, suggesting greater thermal insulation. In contrast, the periorbital region, a potential proxy of core temperature in birds, increased during these same early moulting stages. The surface temperature of the bill, flipper and foot (thermal windows) tended to initially increase during the moult, highlighting the likely need for extra heat dissipation in moulting penguins. These results raise questions regarding the thermoregulatory capacities of penguins in the wild during the challenging period of moulting on land in the current context of global warming.",2024,NA,227,11,NA,jeb247332,Thermal challenge; Moult; Thermoregulation; Penguin; Global warming

Previous work suggests that freshwater populations expanded their physiology to accommodate low salinity environments; however, it is unknown whether this compromises their tolerance to high salinity. We used a comparative approach to investigate the mechanisms of a derived freshwater phenotype and the fate of an ancestral euryhaline phenotype after invasion of a freshwater environment. We compared physiological and transcriptomic responses to high-and low-salinity stress in fresh and brackish water populations and found an enhanced plasticity to low salinity in the freshwater population coupled with a reduced ability to acclimate to high salinity. Transcriptomic data identified genes with a conserved common response, a conserved salinity-dependent response and responses associated with population divergence. Conserved common acclimation responses revealed stress responses and alterations in cell-cycle regulation as important mechanisms in the general osmotic response. Salinity-specific responses included the regulation of genes involved in ion transport, intracellular calcium, energetic processes and cellular remodeling. Genes diverged between populations were primarily those showing salinity-specific expression and included those regulating polyamine homeostasis and the cell cycle. Additionally, when populations were matched with their native salinity, expression patterns were consistent with the concept of `transcriptomic resilience', suggesting local adaptation. These findings provide insight into the fate of a plastic phenotype after a shift in environmental salinity and help to reveal mechanisms allowing for euryhalinity.",2015,10.1242/jeb.110445,218,8,1212-1222,NA,Comparative physiology; Comparative genomics; Ecological genomics; Fundulus heteroclitus; Plasticity

Here, we investigated the effects of four chemically distinct DOM isolates (three natural, one commercial, ranging from autochthonous to highly allochthonous, all at similar to 6 mg C l(-1)) on the physiology of gill ionoregulation and nitrogenous waste excretion in zebrafish acclimated to either circumneutral (7.0-8.0) or acidic pH (5.0). Overall, lower pH tended to increase net branchial ammonia excretion, net K+ loss and [}H-3] PEG-4000 clearance rates (indicators of transcellular and paracellular permeability, respectively). However, unidirectional Na+ efflux, urea excretion and drinking rates were unaffected. DOM sources tended to stimulate unidirectional Na+ influx rate and exerted subtle effects on the concentration-dependent kinetics of Na+ uptake, increasing maximum transport capacity. All DOM sources reduced passive Na+ efflux rates regardless of pH, but exerted negligible effects on nitrogenous waste excretion, drinking rate, net K+ loss or {[}H-3] PEG-4000 clearance, so the mechanism of Na+ loss reduction remains unclear. Overall, these actions appear beneficial to ionoregulatory homeostasis in zebrafish, and some may be related to physicochemical properties of the DOM sources. They are very different from those seen in a recent parallel study on Daphnia magna using the same DOM isolates, indicating that DOM actions may be both species and DOM specific.",2016,10.1242/jeb.139444,219,15,2289-2299,NA,DOC; Na+ fluxes; K+ fluxes; Ammonia fluxes; Urea fluxes; Drinking rate
article,When less means more: dehydration improves innate immunity in rattlesnakes,"Brusch, George A. and DeNardo, Dale F.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Immune function can vary based on availability of resources, and most studies of such influences have focused on the co-investment of energy into immune and other physiological functions. When energy resources are limited, trade-offs exist, which can compromise immunity for other functions. As with energy, water limitation can also alter various physiological processes, yet water has received little consideration for its possible role in modulating immune functions. We examined the relationship between immunocompetence and hydration state using the western diamond-backed rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox). This species is known to undergo substantial seasonal fluctuations in water availability with extreme limitations during the hot-dry season. We collected blood samples from free ranging C. atrox to compare osmolality and innate immune function (lysis, agglutination and bacterial growth inhibition) during the milder and relatively moister early spring season, the hot-dry season and the hot-wet season. To isolate effects of dehydration from other possible seasonal influences, we complemented this field study with a laboratory study in which we withheld food and water from individually housed adult C. atrox for up to 16 weeks. We collected blood samples from each snake as it dehydrated and collected a final sample after the snake was given water ad libitum at the end of the experiment. Our results demonstrate that C. atrox experience significant dehydration during the hot-dry season, and that, in general, innate immune function is highly correlated with osmolality, whether natural or artificially manipulated.",2017,10.1242/jeb.155028,220,12,2287-2295,NA,Hydration; Immune function; Osmotic stress; Immunocompetence; Water limitations
article,Roles of multi-level temperature-adaptive responses and microhabitat variation in establishing distributions of intertidal species,"Dong, Yun-Wei",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"How intertidal species survive their harsh environment and how best to evaluate and forecast range shifts in species distribution are two important and closely related questions for intertidal ecologists and global change biologists. Adaptive variation in responses of organisms to environmental change across all levels of biological organization - from behavior to molecular systems - is of key importance in setting distribution patterns, yet studies often neglect the interactions of diverse types of biological variation (e.g. differences in thermal optima owing to genetic and acclimationinduced effects) with environmental variation, notably at the scale of microhabitats. Intertidal species have to cope with extreme and frequently changing thermal stress, and have shown high variation in thermal sensitivities and adaptive responses at different levels of biological organization. Here, I review the physiological and biochemical adaptations of intertidal species to environmental temperature on multiple spatial and temporal scales. With fine-scale datasets for the thermal limits of individuals and for environmental temperature variation at the microhabitat scale, we can map the thermal sensitivity for each individual in different microhabitats, and then scale up the thermal sensitivity analysis to the population level and, finally, to the species level by incorporating physiological traits into species distribution models. These more refined mechanistic models that include consideration of physiological variations have higher predictive power than models that neglect these variations, and they will be crucial to answering the questions posed above concerning adaptive mechanisms and the roles they play in governing distribution patterns in a rapidly changing world.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245745,226,21,NA,jeb245745,Climate change; Rocky shore; Habitat; Physiological diversity; Temperature

Under near-future scenarios of ocean acidification, the swimming behaviour of marine invertebrate sperm is altered. We tested whether this was due to changes in sperm mitochondrial activity by investigating the effects of ocean acidification on sperm metabolism and swimming behaviour in the sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii. We used a fluorescent molecular probe (JC-1) and flow cytometry to visualize mitochondrial activity (measured as change in mitochondrial membrane potential, MMP). Sperm MMP was significantly reduced in Delta pH-0.3 (35\% reduction) and Delta pH-0.5 (48\% reduction) treatments, whereas sperm swimming behaviour was less sensitive with only slight changes (up to 11\% decrease) observed overall. There was significant inter-individual variability in responses of sperm swimming behaviour and MMP to acidified seawater. We suggest it is likely that sperm exposed to these changes in pH are close to their tipping point in terms of physiological tolerance to acidity. Importantly, substantial inter-individual variation in responses of sperm swimming to ocean acidification may increase the scope for selection of resilient phenotypes, which, if heritable, could provide a basis for adaptation to future ocean acidification.",2015,10.1242/jeb.114900,218,7,1084-1090,NA,CO2; Reproduction; Fertilization kinetics; Resilience; Sperm metabolism

D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Dragonflies (Odonata, Anisoptera) are amphibiotic; the nymph is aquatic and breathes water using a rectal gill before metamorphosing into the winged adult, which breathes air through spiracles. While the evolutionary and developmental transition from water breathing to air breathing is known to be associated with a dramatic rise in internal CO2 levels, the changes in blood-gas composition experienced by amphibiotic insects, which represent an ancestral air-to-water transition, are unknown. This study measured total CO2 (TCO2) in hemolymph collected from aquatic nymphs and air-breathing adults of Anax junius, Aeshna multicolor (Aeshnidae), Libellula quadrimaculata and Libellula forensis (Libellulidae). Hemolymph Pco, was also measured in vivo in both aeshnid nymphs and marbled crayfish (Procambarus fallax. f. virginalis) using a novel fiber-optic CO2 sensor. The hemolymph TCO2 of the pre- and early-final instar nymphs was found to be significantly lower than that of the air-breathing adults. However, the TCO2 of the late-final instar aeshnid nymphs was not significantly different from that of the air-breathing adults, despite the late-final nymphs still breathing water. TCO2 and P-CO2 were also significantly higher in the hemolymph of early-final aeshnid nymphs compared with values for the water-breathing crayfish. Thus, while dragonfly nymphs show an increase in internal CO2 as they transition from water to air, from an evolutionary standpoint, the nymph's ability to breathe water is associated with a comparatively minor decrease in hemolymph TCO2 relative to that of the air-breathing adult.",2018,10.1242/jeb.181438,221,15,NA,jeb181438,Blood-gas composition; Insect; TCO2; P-CO2; Tracheal gill; Aquatic

However, the main evidence for this is that gabazine, a GABA(A) receptor antagonist, reverses these effects when applied to the water, assuming that exposure to systems other than the CNS would be without effect. Here, we show the expression of both metabotropic and ionotropic GABA receptors, and the presence of GABA(A) receptor protein, in the olfactory epithelium of gilthead seabream. Furthermore, exposure of the olfactory epithelium to muscimol (a specific GABA(A) receptor agonist) increases or decreases the apparent olfactory sensitivity to some odorants. Thus, although the exact function of GABA(A) receptors in the olfactory epithelium is not yet clear, this may complicate the interpretation of studies wherein water-borne gabazine is used to reverse the effects of high CO2 levels on olfactory-driven behaviour in fish.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243112,225,3,NA,jeb243112,Ocean acidification; Olfaction; GABA(A) receptors; Gabazine
article,Functional development of carbon dioxide detection in the maxillary palp of <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>,"Omondi, Bonaventure Aman and Majeed, Shahid and Ignell, Rickard",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Olfactory information drives several behaviours critical for the survival and persistence of insect pests and vectors. Insect behaviour is variable, linked to their biological needs, and regulated by physiological dynamics. For mosquitoes, CO2 is an important cue that signifies the presence of a host, and which elicits activation and attraction. To investigate the genetic basis of olfactory modulation in mosquitoes, we assayed changes in CO2 detection from receptor gene expression through physiological function to behaviour, associated with the onset of host seeking in the malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae. The gene encoding a subunit of the CO2 receptor, AgGr22, was found to be significantly up-regulated in host-seeking females, consistent with a significant increase in sensitivity of CO2-responsive neurons (cpA) housed in capitate peg sensilla of the maxillary palp. In addition, the odorant receptor AgOr28, which is expressed in cpC neurons, was significantly up-regulated. In contrast, AgOr8, which is expressed in cpB neurons, was not affected by this change in physiological state, in agreement with results for the obligate co-receptor Orco. Moreover, the sensitivity of the cpB neuron to (R)-1-octen-3-ol, a well-known mammalian kairomone, did not change in response to the onset of host seeking. The concentration of CO2 flux influenced both the propensity of A. gambiae to take off into the wind and the speed with which this activation occurred. Female A. gambiae mosquitoes responded to CO2 whether mature for host seeking or not, but onset of host seeking enhanced sensitivity and speed of activation at relevant doses of CO2.",2015,10.1242/jeb.116798,218,15,2482-2488,NA,Gene expression; Modulation; Host seeking; Behaviour; Physiology; Mosquito
article,A new approach for measuring temperature inside turtle eggs,"Tezak, Boris M. and Sifuentes-Romero, Itzel and Wyneken, Jeanette",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"For turtles, the thermal environment experienced during development plays critical roles in many biological processes. While the temperature inside an egg is assumed to match the substrate temperature, many factors such as evaporative cooling, metabolic heating and the insulating properties of extra-embryonic components can lead to thermal differences. However, no method developed to date has allowed for measurement of the embryonic temperature in live chelonian eggs. We designed a thermocouple-based technique to measure embryonic temperature, achieving 94\% survival in Trachemys scripta. This methodology may be applicable to other reptile species. We found that, while the temperature in the substrate adjacent to the eggshell accurately reflects the internal egg temperature, it differs from air temperature (similar to 2 degrees C) in a moisture-dependent manner. Our results demonstrate that external egg temperature, but not air temperature, is suitable for assessing the effects of temperature on biological processes, which could be critical when considering that processes such as temperature-dependent sex determination in turtles occurs within a 4 degrees C window.",2018,10.1242/jeb.188698,221,20,NA,jeb188698,Embryonic temperature; Thermocouple; Reptile egg manipulation; Egg breaching; Thermal biology; Substrate moisture

Hence, bats which are resident at northern latitudes throughout the year will need to undergo a long hibernation season and a short reproductive season where foraging time is limited by extended daylight periods. Eptesicus nilssonii is the northernmost occurring bat species worldwide and hibernates locally when ambient temperatures (Ta) limit prey availability. Therefore, we investigated the energy spent maintaining normothermy at different Ta, as well as how much bats limit energy expenditure while in torpor. We found that, despite being exposed to Ta as low as 1.1 degrees C, bats did not increase torpid metabolic rate, thus indicating that E. nilssonii can survive and hibernate at low ambient temperatures. Furthermore, we found a lower critical temperature (Tlc) of 27.8 degrees C, which is lower than in most other vespertilionid bats, and we found no indication of any metabolic response to Ta up to 37.1 degrees C. Interestingly, carbon dioxide production increased with increasing Ta above the Tlc, presumably caused by a release of retained CO2 in bats that remained in torpor for longer and aroused at Ta above the Tlc. Our results indicate that E. nilssonii can thermoconform at near-freezing Ta, and hence maintain longer torpor bouts with limited energy expenditure, yet also cope with high Ta when sun exposed in roosts during long summer days. These physiological traits are likely to enable the species to cope with ongoing and predicted climate change.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245260,226,21,NA,jeb245260,Vespertilionidae; Torpor; Normothermic; Northern latitudes; Respirometry

This study aimed to investigate the influence of ocean acidification and warming on maximum performance parameters of B. saida as indicators for the species' acclimation capacities under environmental conditions projected for the end of this century. After 4 months at four acclimation temperatures (0, 3, 6, 8 degrees C) each combined with two P-CO2 levels (390 and 1170 mu atm), aerobic capacities and swimming performance of B. saida were recorded following a U-crit protocol. At both CO2 levels, standard metabolic rate (SMR) was elevated at the highest acclimation temperature indicating thermal limitations. Maximum metabolic rate (MMR) increased continuously with temperature, suggesting an optimum temperature for aerobic scope for exercise (AS(ex)) at 6 degrees C. Aerobic swimming performance (U-gait) increased with acclimation temperature irrespective of CO2 levels, while critical swimming speed (U-crit) did not reveal any clear trend with temperature. Hypercapnia evoked an increase in MMR (and thereby AS(ex)). However, swimming performance (both U-gait and U-crit) was impaired under elevated nearfuture P-CO2 conditions, indicating reduced efficiencies of oxygen turnover. The contribution of anaerobic metabolism to swimming performance was very low overall, and further reduced under hypercapnia. Our results revealed high sensitivities of maximum performance parameters (MMR, U-gait, U-crit) of B. saida to ocean acidification.

A possible but rarely considered mechanism is that the metabolic response of ectotherms to warming is associated with changes in brain morphology and function. Here, we compared aerobic metabolism, brain volume, boldness and accuracy of maze solving of common minnows (Phoxinus phoxinus) acclimated for 8 months to either their current optimal natural (14 degrees C) or warm (20 degrees C) water temperature. Metabolic rates indicated increased energy expenditure in warm-acclimated fish, but also at least partial thermal compensation as warm-acclimated fish maintained high aerobic scope. Warm-acclimated fish had larger brains than cool-acclimated fish. The volume of the dorsal medulla relative to the overall brain size was larger in warm-than in cool-acclimated fish, but the proportion of other brain regions did not differ between the temperature treatments. Warm-acclimated fish did not differ in boldness but made more errors than cool-acclimated fish in exploring the maze across four trials. Inter-individual differences in the number of exploration errors were repeatable across the four trials of the maze test. Our findings suggest that in warm environments, maintaining a high aerobic scope, which is important for the performance of physically demanding tasks, can come at the cost of changes in brain morphology and impairment of the capacity to explore novel environments.

article,Physiological responses to hypoxia are constrained by environmental temperature in heterothermic tenrecs,"Devereaux, Maiah E. M. and Rubio, Claudia Silva and van Breukelen, Frank and Pamenter, Matthew E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Malagasy tenrecs are placental hibernating mammals that seal the entrances to their burrows and hibernate either singly or in groups for 8-9 months, which is likely to create a hypoxic and hypercapnic burrow environment. Therefore, we hypothesized that tenrecs are tolerant to environmental hypoxia and hypercapnia. Many hypoxia-and hypercapnia-tolerant fossorial mammals respond to hypoxia by decreasing metabolic rate and thermogenesis, and have blunted ventilatory responses to both environmental hypoxia and hypercapnia. However, tenrecs exhibit extreme metabolic and thermoregulatory plasticity, which exceeds that of most heterothermic mammals and approaches that of ectothermic reptiles. Thus, we predicted that tenrecs would have abnormal physiological responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia relative to other fossorial mammals. To test this, we exposed common tenrecs (Tenrec ecaudatus) to moderate and severe hypoxia (9 and 4\% O2) or hypercapnia (5 and 10\% CO2) in either 28 or 16 degrees C while non-invasively measuring metabolic rate, thermogenesis and ventilation. We found that tenrecs exhibit robust metabolic decreases in both hypoxia and hypercapnia. Furthermore, tenrecs have blunted ventilatory responses to both hypoxia and hypercapnia, and these responses are highly temperature sensitive such that they are reduced or absent in 16 degrees C. Thermoregulation was highly variable in 16 degrees C but constrained in 28 degrees C across all treatment conditions and was not impacted by hypoxia or hypercapnia, unlike in other heterothermic mammals.

article,Heat and water loss versus shelter: a dilemma in thermoregulatory decision making for a retreat-dwelling nocturnal gecko,"Chukwuka, Christian O. and Monks, Joanne M. and Cree, Alison",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Understanding the interaction between upper voluntary thermal limit (VTmax) and water loss may aid in predicting responses of ectotherms to increasing temperatures within microhabitats. However, the temperature at which climate heating will force cool-climate nocturnal lizards to abandon daytime retreats remains poorly understood. Here, we developed a new laboratory protocol for determining VTmax in the retreat-dwelling, viviparous Woodworthia `Otago/Southland' gecko, based on escape behaviour (abandonment of heated retreat). We compared the body temperature (T-b) at VTmax and duration of heating, between two source groups with different thermal histories, and among three reproductive groups. We also examined continuous changes in T-b (via an attached biologger) and total evaporative water loss (EWL) during heating. In the field, we measured T-b and microhabitat thermal profiles to establish whether geckos reach VTmax in nature. We found that VTmax and duration of heating varied between source groups (and thus potentially with prior thermal experience), but not among reproductive groups. Moreover, geckos reached a peak temperature slightly higher than VTmax before abandoning the retreat. Total EWL increased with increasing VTmax and with the duration of heating. In the field, pregnant geckos with attached biologgers reached VT(max )temperature, and temperatures of some separately monitored microhabitats exceeded VT(max)in hot weather implying that some retreats must be abandoned to avoid overheating. Our results suggest that cool-climate nocturnal lizards that inhabit daytime retreats may abandon retreats more frequently if climate warming persists, implying a trade-off between retention of originally occupied shelter and ongoing water loss due to overheating.",2020,10.1242/jeb.231241,223,20,NA,jeb231241,Costs of thermoregulation; Ectotherm; Evaporative water loss; Retreat-dwelling gecko; Thermal tolerance
article,Discontinuous gas-exchange cycle characteristics are differentially affected by hydration state and energy metabolism in gregarious and solitary desert locusts,"Talal, Stav and Ayali, Amir and Gefen, Eran",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The termination of discontinuous gas exchange cycles (DGCs) in severely dehydrated insects casts doubt on the generality of the hygric hypothesis, which posits that DGCs evolved as a water conservation mechanism. We followed DGC characteristics in the two density-dependent phases of the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria throughout exposure to an experimental treatment of combined dehydration and starvation stress, and subsequent rehydration. We hypothesized that, under stressful conditions, the more stress-resistant gregarious locusts would maintain DGCs longer than solitary locusts. However, we found no phase-specific variations in body water content, water loss rates (total and respiratory) or timing of stress-induced abolishment of DGCs. Likewise, locusts of both phases re-employed DGCs after ingesting comparable volumes of water when rehydrated. Despite comparable water management performances, the effect of exposure to stressful experimental conditions on DGC characteristics varied significantly between gregarious and solitary locusts. Interburst duration, which is affected by the ability to buffer CO2, was significantly reduced in dehydrated solitary locusts compared with gregarious locusts. Moreover, despite similar rehydration levels, only gregarious locusts recovered their initial CO2 accumulation capacity, indicating that cycle characteristics are affected by factors other than haemolymph volume. Haemolymph protein measurements and calculated respiratory exchange ratios suggest that catabolism of haemolymph proteins may contribute to a reduced haemolymph buffering capacity, and thus a compromised ability for CO2 accumulation, in solitary locusts. Nevertheless, DGC was lost at similar hydration states in the two phases, suggesting that DGCs are terminated as a result of inadequate oxygen supply to the tissues.",2015,10.1242/jeb.126490,218,23,3807-3815,NA,Buffering capacity; Desiccation; DGCs; Grasshoppers; Haemolymph; Oxygen; Starvation

The role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in regulating spermatogenesis has attracted considerable attention. Our previous study found that red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans), could survive in 10 PSU water for over 1 year. To understand the chronic impact of salinity on testicular spermatogenesis and underlying mechanisms, male T. s. elegans were subjected to treatment with water of 5 PSU and 10 PSU for a year, and spermatogenesis and regulation of the RAS signal pathway was assessed. Results showed induced inflammation in the testes of T. s. elegans in the 10 PSU group, as evidenced by a decrease in the number of testicular germ cells from 1586 to 943. Compared with the control group, the levels of proinflammatory genes, including TNF-alpha, IL12A and IL-6 were elevated 3.1, 0.3, and 1.4 times, respectively, in animals exposed to 10 PSU water. Testicular antiapoptotic processes of T. s. elegans might involve the vasoactive peptide angiotensin-(1-7) in the RAS, as its level was significantly increased from 220.2 ng ml-1 in controls to 419.2 ng ml-1 in the 10 PSU group. As expected, specific inhibitor (A-779) for the Ang-(1-7) acceptor effectively prevented the salinity-induced upregulation of genes encoding anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic factors (TGF-beta 1, Bcl-6) in the testis of the 10 PSU animals, whereas it promoted the upregulation of proinflammatory and proapoptotic factors (TNF-alpha, IL-12A, IL-6, Bax and caspase-3). Our data indicated that Ang-(1-7) attenuates the effect of salinity on inflammation and apoptosis of the testis in T. s. elegans.

These animals show vulnerability to changing carbonate chemistry conditions, are geographically widespread, and are both biogeochemically and trophically important. The objective of this study was to determine how increasing duration and severity of CO2 treatment influence the physiology of the thecosome Limacina retroversa, integrating both gene expression and organism-level (respiration and calcification) metrics. We exposed pteropods to over-saturated, near-saturated or under-saturated conditions and sampled individuals at 1, 3, 7, 14 and 21 days of exposure to test for the effect of duration. We found that calcification was affected by borderline and under-saturated conditions by week two, while respiration appeared to be more strongly influenced by an interaction between severity and duration of exposure, showing complex changes by one week of exposure. The organismal metrics were corroborated by specific gene expression responses, with increased expression of biomineralization-associated genes in the medium and high treatments throughout and complex changes in metabolic genes corresponding to both captivity and CO2 treatment. Genes associated with other physiological processes such as lipid metabolism, neural function and ion pumping had complex responses, influenced by both duration and severity. Beyond these responses, our findings detail the captivity effects for these pelagic organisms, providing information to contextualize the conclusions of previous studies, and emphasizing a need for better culturing protocols.",2018,10.1242/jeb.164400,221,3,NA,jeb164400,Zooplankton; Ocean acidification; Respiration; Calcein; Transcriptomics; RNA-seq; Biomineralization; Shell formation (need 6-10)
article,Intricate but tight coupling of spiracular activity and abdominal ventilation during locust discontinuous gas exchange cycles,"Talal, Stav and Gefen, Eran and Ayali, Amir",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Discontinuous gas exchange (DGE) is the best studied among insect gas exchange patterns. DGE cycles comprise three phases, which are defined by their spiracular state: closed, flutter and open. However, spiracle status has rarely been monitored directly; rather, it is often assumed based on CO2 emission traces. In this study, we directly recorded electromyogram (EMG) signals from the closer muscle of the second thoracic spiracle and from abdominal ventilation muscles in a fully intact locust during DGE. Muscular activity was monitored simultaneously with CO2 emission, under normoxia and under various experimental oxic conditions. Our findings indicate that locust DGE does not correspond well with the commonly described three-phase cycle. We describe unique DGE-related ventilation motor patterns, coupled to spiracular activity. During the open phase, when CO2 emission rate is highest, the thoracic spiracles do not remain open; rather, they open and close rapidly. This fast spiracle activity coincides with in-phase abdominal ventilation, while alternating with the abdominal spiracle and thus facilitating a unidirectional air flow along the main trachea. A change in the frequency of rhythmic ventilation during the open phase suggests modulation by intratracheal CO2 levels. A second, slow ventilatory movement pattern probably serves to facilitate gas diffusion during spiracle closure. Two flutter-like patterns are described in association with the different types of ventilatory activity. We offer a modified mechanistic model for DGE in actively ventilating insects, incorporating ventilatory behavior and changes in spiracle state.",2018,10.1242/jeb.174722,221,6,NA,jeb174722,Tracheal system; Insects; Active ventilation; Spiracles; Electromyogram; Central pattern generator

Scott and Soar, Rupert and Mahadevan, L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"How termite mounds function to facilitate climate control is still only partially understood. Recent experimental evidence in the mounds of a single species, the south Asian termite Odontotermes obesus, suggests that the daily oscillations of radiant heating associated with diurnal insolation patterns drive convective flow within them. How general this mechanism is remains unknown. To probe this, we consider the mounds of the African termite Macrotermes michaelseni, which thrives in a very different environment. By directly measuring air velocities and temperatures within the mound, we see that the overall mechanisms and patterns involved are similar to that in the south Asian species. However, there are also some notable differences between the physiology of these mounds associated with the temporal variations in radiant heating patterns and CO2 dynamics. Because of the difference between direct radiant heating driven by the position of the sun in African conditions, and the more shaded south Asian environments, we see changes in the convective flows in the two types of mounds. Furthermore, we also see that the south Asian mounds show a significant overturning of stratified gases, once a day, while the African mounds have a relatively uniform concentration of CO2. Overall, our observations show that despite these differences, termite architectures can harness periodic solar heating to drive ventilation inside them in very different environments, functioning as an external lung, with clear implications for human engineering.",2017,10.1242/jeb.160895,220,18,3260-3269,NA,Animal architecture; Termite mounds; Ventilation

All paralogs except aqp7 and aqp10a had a broad tissue distribution, and several were affected by salinity in both osmoregulatory and non-osmoregulatory tissues. In the intestine, aqp1a, aqp7, aqp8ab and aqp10a decreased upon seawater (SW) acclimation in both long-term acclimated fish and during 1-3 days of the transition period. In the gill, aqp3a was lower and aqp10a higher in SW than in freshwater (FW). In the kidney no aqps were affected by salinity. In the skin, aqp1a and aqp3a were lower in SW than in FW. In the liver, aqp8ab and aqp10a were lower in SW than in FW. Furthermore, six Na+, K+-ATPase a-subunit isoform transcripts were analysed in the intestine but none showed a consistent response to salinity, suggesting that water transport is not regulated at this level. In contrast, mRNA of the Na+, K+, 2Cl(-)-cotransporter type-2 strongly increased in the intestine in SW compared with FW fish. Using custom-made antibodies, Aqp1a, Aqp8ab and Aqp10a were localized in the apical region of enterocytes of FW fish. Apical staining intensity strongly decreased, vanished or moved to subapical regions, when fish were acclimated to SW, supporting the lower mRNA expression in SW. Western blots confirmed the decrease in Aqp1a and Aqp10a in SW. The strong decrease in aquaporin expression in the intestine of SW fish is surprising, and challenges the paradigm for transepithelial intestinal water absorption in SW fishes.",2014,10.1242/jeb.105098,217,17,3108-3121,NA,Aquaporin; Intestine; Salinity; Water transport

To date, the reason for the evolution of such extreme pH conditions in the gut of these organisms remains unknown. Here, we test the hypothesis that, analogous to the acidic stomachs of vertebrates, these alkaline conditions may represent a first defensive barrier to protect from environmental pathogens. pH-optimum curves for five different species of marine bacteria demonstrated a rapid decrease in proliferation rates by 50-60\% between pH 8.5 and 9.5. Using the marine bacterium Vibrio diazotrophicus, which elicits a coordinated immune response in the larvae of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, we studied the physiological responses of the midgut pH regulatory machinery to this pathogen. Gastroscopic microelectrode measurements demonstrate a stimulation of midgut alkalization upon infection with V. diazotrophicus accompanied by an upregulation of acid-base transporter transcripts of the midgut. Pharmacological inhibition of midgut alkalization resulted in an increased mortality rate of larvae during Vibrio infection. Reductions in seawater pH resembling ocean acidification conditions lead to moderate reductions in midgut alkalization. However, these reductions in midgut pH do not affect the immune response or resilience of sea urchin larvae to a Vibrio infection under ocean acidification conditions. Our study addressed the evolutionary benefits of the alkaline midgut of Ambulacraria larval stages. The data indicate that alkaline conditions in the gut may serve as a first defensive barrier against environmental pathogens and that this mechanism can compensate for changes in seawater pH.",2020,10.1242/jeb.222844,223,9,NA,jeb222844,Vibrio diazotrophicus; Ocean acidification; Bacterial infection; Na+/H+-exchange; Ion selective micro-electrodes

While numerous experimental studies have explored the physiological and behavioural effects of short-term, acute exposure to low salinity in echinoids, surprisingly few have investigated the consequences of chronic exposure, or compared the two. In this study, the European sea urchin, Echinus esculentus, was exposed to low salinity over the short term (11 parts per thousand, 16 parts per thousand, 21 parts per thousand, 26 parts per thousand and 31 parts per thousand for 24 h) and longer term (21, 26 and 31 parts per thousand for 25 days). Over the short term, oxygen consumption, activity coefficient and coelomic fluid osmolality were directly correlated with reduced salinity, with 100\% survival at >= 21 parts per thousand and 0\% at <= 16 parts per thousand. Over the longer term at 21 parts per thousand (25 days), oxygen consumption was significantly higher, feeding was significantly reduced and activity coefficient values were significantly lower than at control salinity (31 parts per thousand). At 26 parts per thousand, all metrics were comparable to the control by the end of the experiment, suggesting acclimation. Furthermore, beneficial functional resistance (righting ability and metabolic capacity) to acute low salinity was observed at 26 parts per thousand. Osmolality values were slightly hyperosmotic to the external seawater at all acclimation salinities, while coelomocyte composition and concentration were unaffected by chronic low salinity. Overall, E. esculentus demonstrate phenotypic plasticity that enables acclimation to reduced salinity around 26 parts per thousand; however, 21 parts per thousand represents a lower acclimation threshold, potentially limiting its distribution in coastal areas prone to high freshwater input.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246707,227,2,NA,jeb246707,Osmotic stress; Echinoderm; Acclimation; Coastal freshening; Climate change; Phenotypic plasticity

However, these physiological hypotheses have not been well investigated. Here, we report the effects of aggregation on metabolic ((V) over dot(CO2)) and evaporative water-loss rates ((V) over dot(H2O)) of the gregarious caterpillar Eutricha capensis, by comparing individuals and groups of individuals (N=10-100). Contrary to findings from previous physiological studies, we did not find an advantage to aggregation: unexpectedly, (V) over dot(CO2) and (V) over dot(H2O) did not decrease with increasing group size. (V) over dot(CO2) and (V) over dot(H2O) generally remained constant or increased in larger groups relative to individuals. The amount of water lost per unit of CO2 exchanged ((V) over dot(H2O):(V) over dot(CO2) ratio) showed a marked increase in grouped caterpillars, particularly in larger groups. Other benefits of aggregation (e. g. reduced predation or increased growth rates) likely outweigh these potential costs, because individuals of E. capensis aggregate voluntarily despite no obvious energetic or hygric advantage, and other potentially confounding group effects (e. g. increased thermoregulatory advantage or whole-animal activity) are inconsequential.

Jane and Julian, David",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Fertilized eggs of the American horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus, are buried in shallow nests above the high tide line, where they are exposed to variations in abiotic conditions during early development. Using a multiple-stressors approach, we examined whether the rate of embryonic development is affected by exposure to combinations of three factors: temperature (25, 30 and 35 degrees C), salinity (5, 15 and 34 ppt) and ambient O-2 (5\%, 13\% and 21\% O-2). Newly fertilized eggs were incubated under 27 fully factorial stressor combinations for 14 days, then allowed to recover in control conditions (30 degrees C, 34 ppt, 21\% O-2) for an additional 14 days. Growth rate was measured every 2 days throughout the experiment (N=1289). We found that the effect of isolated stressors (high temperature, low salinity or low O-2) reduced developmental success by up to 72\% (low salinity), and that stressor combinations showed stronger effects and evidence of complex interactions. For example, low O-2 had little effect individually but was lethal in combination with high temperature, and low temperature in isolation slightly decreased the rate of development but reduced the negative effects of low salinity and low O-2. Development was delayed under exposure to low O-2 but resumed upon return to control conditions after a 10 day lag. These data demonstrate that complex, synergistic interactions among abiotic stressors can substantially alter the development of a coastal invertebrate in ways that may not be predicted from the effects of the stressors in isolation.",2015,10.1242/jeb.117184,218,15,2355-2364,NA,Multiple abiotic stressors; Compound stressors; Osmotic stress; Hypoxia; Heat stress; Niche space model

Relative to other marine organisms, molluscs have been identified as vulnerable to future ocean acidification; however, paradoxically it has also been shown that molluscs exposed to high CO2 environments are more resilient compared with those molluscs naive to CO2 exposure. Two competing hypotheses were tested using a novel experimental design incorporating tidal simulations to predict the future intertidal limit of oysters in a high-CO2 world; either high-shore oysters will be more tolerant of elevated PCO2 because of their regular acidosis, or elevated PCO2 will cause high-shore oysters to reach their limit. Sydney rock oysters, Saccostrea glomerata, were collected from the high-intertidal and subtidal areas of the shore and exposed in an orthogonal design to either an intertidal or a subtidal treatment at ambient or elevated PCO2, and physiological variables were measured. The combined treatment of tidal emersion and elevated PCO2 interacted synergistically to reduce the haemolymph pH (pHe) of oysters, and increase the PCO2 in the haemolymph (Pe, CO2) and standard metabolic rate. Oysters in the intertidal treatment also had lower condition and growth. Oysters showed a high degree of plasticity, and little evidence was found that intertidal oysters were more resilient than subtidal oysters. It is concluded that in a high-CO2 world the upper vertical limit of oyster distribution on the shore may be reduced. These results suggest that previous studies on intertidal organisms that lacked tidal simulations may have underestimated the effects of elevated PCO2",2017,10.1242/jeb.151365,220,5,765-774,NA,Emersion; Ocean acidification; Hypercapnia; Multiple stressors; Mollusc
article,Inadequate food intake at high temperatures is related to depressed mitochondrial respiratory capacity,"Salin, Karine and Auer, Sonya K. and Anderson, Graeme J. and Selman, Colin and Metcalfe, Neil B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Animals, especially ectotherms, are highly sensitive to the temperature of their surrounding environment. Extremely high temperature, for example, induces a decline of average performance of conspecifics within a population, but individual heterogeneity in the ability to cope with elevating temperatures has rarely been studied. Here, we examined inter-individual variation in feeding ability and consequent growth rate of juvenile brown trout Salmo trutta acclimated to a high temperature (19 degrees C), and investigated the relationship between these metrics of whole-animal performances and among-individual variation in mitochondrial respiration capacity. Food was provided ad libitum, yet intake varied ten-fold amongst individuals, resulting in some fish losing weight whilst others continued to grow. Almost half of the variation in food intake was related to variability in mitochondrial capacity: low intake (and hence growth failure) was associated with high leak respiration rates within liver and muscle mitochondria, and a lower coupling of muscle mitochondria. These observations, combined with the inability of fish with low food consumption to increase their intake despite ad libitum food levels, suggest a possible insufficient capacity of the mitochondria for maintaining ATP homeostasis. Individual variation in thermal performance is likely to confer variation in the upper limit of an organism's thermal niche and might affect the structure of wild populations in warming environments.",2016,10.1242/jeb.133025,219,9,1356-1362,NA,Ecophysiology; Food intake; Global warming; Proton leak; Respiratory control ratio; Respiration rate

Environmental salinity serves as a key barrier to the distribution of nearly all aquatic organisms, and species diversification is likely to be enabled by adaptation to alternative osmotic environments. The threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is a euryhaline species with populations found both in marine and freshwater environments. It has evolved both highly plastic and locally adapted phenotypes due to salinity-derived selection, but the physiological and genetic basis of adaptation to salinity is not fully understood. We integrated comparative cellular morphology of the kidney, a key organ for osmoregulation, and candidate gene expression to explore the underpinnings of evolved variation in osmotic plasticity within two populations of sticklebacks from distinct salinity zones in the Baltic Sea: the high salinity Kattegat, representative of the ancestral marine habitat; and the low salinity Bay of Bothnia. A common-garden experiment revealed that kidney morphology in the ancestral high-salinity population had a highly plastic response to salinity conditions whereas this plastic response was reduced in the low-salinity population. Candidate gene expression in kidney tissue revealed a similar pattern of population specific differences, with a higher degree of plasticity in the native high-salinity population. Together these results suggest that renal cellular morphology has become canalized to low salinity, and that these structural differences may have functional implications for osmoregulation.",2017,10.1242/jeb.146027,220,12,2175-2186,NA,Osmoregulation; Local adaptation; Adaptive plasticity; Kidney morphology

Freeze-tolerant wood frogs, Rana sylvatica, have an active response to the initiation of ice formation that includes mobilising glucose from glycogen and circulating it around the body to act as a cryoprotectant. We used flow-through respirometry to measure CO2 production (V-CO2) in real time during cooling, freezing and thawing. CO2 production increases sharply at three points during freeze-thaw: at +1 degrees C during cooling prior to ice formation (total of 104 +/- 17 mu l CO2 frog(-1) event(-1)), at the initiation of freezing (565 +/- 85 mu l CO2 frog(-1) freezing event(-1)) and after the frog has thawed (564 +/- 75 mu l CO2 frog(-1) freezing event(-1)). We interpret these increases in metabolic rate to represent the energetic costs of preparation for freezing, the response to freezing and the re-establishment of homeostasis and repair of damage after thawing, respectively. We assumed that frogs metabolise lipid when unfrozen and that carbohydrate fuels metabolism during cooling, freezing and thawing, and when frozen. We then used microclimate temperature data to predict overwinter energetics of wood frogs. Based on the freezing and melting points we measured, frogs in the field were predicted to experience as many as 23 freeze-thaw cycles in the winter of our microclimate recordings. Overwinter carbohydrate consumption appears to be driven by the frequency of freeze-thaw events, and changes in overwinter climate that affect the frequency of freeze-thaw will influence carbohydrate consumption, but changes that affect mean temperatures and the frequency of winter warm spells will modify lipid consumption.",2013,10.1242/jeb.076331,216,2,292-302,NA,energetics; freeze tolerance; respirometry

Consequently, blood O-2 uptake at the gills occurs at the environmental temperature at which the individual is found, but O-2 offloading will occur at different temperatures in different tissues. While several regionally heterothermic fishes (e.g. billfishes, tunas and sharks) show a reduced temperature effect on haemoglobin (Hb)-O-2 affinity, the temperature dependence of Hb-O-2 affinity in opah and swordfish is unknown. We hypothesized that the Hb of opah and swordfish would also show a reduced temperature dependence. Opah whole-blood-O-2 affinity exhibited a reverse temperature dependence above 50\% Hb-O-2 saturation (10-20 degrees C, pH 7.2-8.0), while the temperature dependence of swordfish blood-O-2 affinity (10-25 degrees C) was saturation and pH dependent, becoming temperature independent below 50\% Hb-O-2 saturation and pH 7.4. Experiments on stripped haemolysates showed that adding ATP ({[}ATP]/{[}Hb]=30) decreased the temperature sensitivity of Hb-O-2 affinity, changing the overall oxygenation enthalpy (Delta H') values of opah (10-20 degrees C) and swordfish (10-25 degrees C) Hbs at pH 7.4 from -15 and -42 kJ mol-O-1(2), respectively, to +84 and -9 kJ mol(-1) O-2. Swordfish blood-O-2 affinity was high compared with that of other large, pelagic, marine teleosts, which may be the result of unusually low ATP/Hb levels, but might also enable swordfish to forage in the potentially low-oxygenated water of the upper reaches of the oxygen minimum layer. The existence of Hbs with reduced temperature sensitivity in regionally heterothermic fishes may prevent marked changes in Hb-O-2 affinity between the cold and warm tissues.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243820,225,19,NA,jeb243820,Haemoglobin; Blood; Oxygen; Temperature; Regional heterothermy
article,A novel perspective on the evolutionary loss of plasma-accessible carbonic anhydrase at the teleost gill,"Harter, Till S. and Smith, Emma A. and Tresguerres, Martin",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The gills of most teleost fishes lack plasma-accessible carbonic anhydrase (paCA) that could participate in CO2 excretion. We tested the prevailing hypothesis that paCA would interfere with red blood cell (RBC) intracellular pH regulation by 0-adrenergic sodium-proton exchangers (beta-NHE) that protect pH-sensitive haemoglobin-oxygen (Hb-O-2) binding during an acidosis. In an open system that mimics the gills, 0-NHE activity increased Hb-O-2 saturation during a respiratory acidosis in the presence or absence of paCA, whereas the effect was abolished by NHE inhibition. However, in a closed system that mimics the tissue capillaries, paCA disrupted the protective effects of 0-NHE activity on Hb-O-2 binding. The gills are an open system, where CO2 generated by paCA can diffuse out and is not available to acidifying the RBCs. Therefore, branchial paCA in teleosts may not interfere with RBC pH regulation by beta-NHEs, and other explanations for the evolutionary loss of the enzyme must be considered.",2023,10.1242/jeb.246016,226,19,NA,jeb246016,beta-NHE; Slc9a1b; Short-circuiting; Haemoglobin; Root effect; Fish
article,Avian thermoregulation in the heat: evaporative cooling capacity and thermal tolerance in two Australian parrots,"McWhorter, Todd J. and Gerson, Alexander R. and Talbot, William A. and Smith, Eric Krabbe and McKechnie, Andrew E. and Wolf, Blair O.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Avian orders differ in their thermoregulatory capabilities and tolerance of high environmental temperatures. Evaporative heat loss, and the primary avenue whereby it occurs, differs amongst taxa. Although Australian parrots (Psittaciformes) have been impacted by mass mortality events associated with extreme weather events (heat waves), their thermoregulatory physiology has not been well characterized. We quantified the upper limits to thermoregulation under extremely hot conditions in two Australian parrots: the mulga parrot (Psephotellus varius; similar to 55 g) and the galah (Eolophus roseicapilla; similar to 265 g). At air temperatures (T-a) exceeding body temperature (T-b), both species showed increases in Tb to maximum values around 43-44 degrees C, accompanied by rapid increases in resting metabolic rate above clearly defined upper critical limits of thermoneutrality and increases in evaporative water loss to levels equivalent to 700-1000\% of baseline rates at thermoneutral Ta. Maximumcooling capacity, quantified as the fraction of metabolic heat production dissipated evaporatively, ranged from 1.71 to 1.79, consistent with the known range for parrots, similar to the corresponding range in passerines, and well below the corresponding ranges for columbids and caprimulgids. Heat tolerance limit (the maximum Ta tolerated) ranged from 44 to 55 degrees C, similar to the range reported for passerines, but lower than that reported for columbids and caprimulgids. Our data suggest that heat tolerance in parrots is similar to that in passerines. We argue that understanding how thermoregulatory capacity and heat tolerance vary across avian orders is vital for predicting how climate change and the associated increase in frequency of extreme weather events may impact avian populations in the future.",2018,10.1242/jeb.168930,221,6,NA,jeb168930,Body temperature; Evaporative water loss; Hyperthermia; Psittaciformes; Respiratory evaporative water loss; Resting metabolic rate
article,"Sea urchins in a high-CO<sub>2</sub> world: partitioned effects of body size, ocean warming and acidification on metabolic rate","Carey, Nicholas and Harianto, Januar and Byrne, Maria",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Body size and temperature are the major factors explaining metabolic rate, and the additional factor of pH is a major driver at the biochemical level. These three factors have frequently been found to interact, complicating the formulation of broad models predicting metabolic rates and hence ecological functioning. In this first study of the effects of warming and ocean acidification, and their potential interaction, on metabolic rate across a broad range in body size (two to three orders of magnitude difference in body mass), we addressed the impact of climate change on the sea urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma in context with climate projections for southeast Australia, an ocean warming hotspot. Urchins were gradually introduced to two temperatures (18 and 23 degrees C) and two pH levels (7.5 and 8.0), at which they were maintained for 2 months. Identical experimental trials separated by several weeks validated the fact that a new physiological steady state had been reached, otherwise known as acclimation. The relationship between body size, temperature and acidification on the metabolic rate of H. erythrogramma was strikingly stable. Both stressors caused increases in metabolic rate: 20\% for temperature and 19\% for pH. Combined effects were additive: a 44\% increase in metabolism. Body size had a highly stable relationship with metabolic rate regardless of temperature or pH. None of these diverse drivers of metabolism interacted or modulated the effects of the others, highlighting the partitioned nature of how each influences metabolic rate, and the importance of achieving a full acclimation state. Despite these increases in energetic demand there was very limited capacity for compensatory modulating of feeding rate; food consumption increased only in the very smallest specimens, and only in response to temperature, and not pH. Our data show that warming, acidification and body size all substantially affect metabolism and are highly consistent and partitioned in their effects, and for H. erythrogramma, near-future climate change will incur a substantial energetic cost.",2016,10.1242/jeb.136101,219,8,1178-1186,NA,Metabolic scaling; Metabolism; Heliocidaris erythrogramma; Ocean acidification; Ocean warming; Acclimation
article,Short-term dehydration influences baseline but not stress-induced corticosterone levels in the house sparrow (<i>Passer domesticus</i>),"Brischoux, Francois and Beaugeard, Erika and Mohring, Bertille and Parenteau, Charline and Angelier, Frederic",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Future environmental variations linked to climate change are expected to influence precipitation regimes and thus drinking water availability. Dehydration can be a particularly challenging physiological state for most organisms, yet no study has examined the effect of dehydration on the functioning of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis in wild endothermic animals, despite its central role in maintaining homeostasis. In this study, we experimentally imposed a temporary water shortage (similar to 20 h) on captive house sparrows in order to investigate the consequences of short-term dehydration on baseline and stress-induced corticosterone levels. As expected, water-deprived birds displayed higher plasma osmolality and haematocrit. Additionally, water-deprived birds had lower defecation rates, suggesting that the mechanisms allowing caecal water absorption may be triggered very rapidly during water deprivation. Baseline but not stress-induced corticosterone levels were higher in water-deprived birds. Taken together, these results suggest that water restriction may have critical consequences on several corticosterone-related traits such as energy budget (protein catabolism and possibly feeding reduction), enhanced mobility (to promote water acquisition) and potential responses to predators (thirst threshold overriding the acute stress response). Owing to the possible fitness consequences of such components of the day-to-day life of birds, further studies should aim at investigating the influence of future changes in precipitation regimes and drinking water availability on bird populations.",2020,10.1242/jeb.216424,223,3,NA,jeb216424,Water; Osmolality; Haematocrit; Stress; Birds; Defecation rate

At high environmental temperatures, diurnal endotherms maintain body temperature (T-b) below lethal limits via physiological and behavioural adjustments. Accurate models of these processes are crucial for predicting effects of climate variability on avifauna. We evaluated the performance of a biophysical model (NicheMapR) for predicting evaporative water loss (EWL), resting metabolic rate (RMR) and T-b at environmental temperatures approaching or exceeding normothermic T-b for three arid-zone birds: southern yellow-billed hornbill (Tockus leucomelas), southern pied babbler (Turdoides bicolor) and southern fiscal (Lanius collaris). We simulated metabolic chamber conditions and compared model outputs with thermal physiology data collected at air temperatures (T-air) between 10 and 50 degrees C. Additionally, we determined the minimum data needed to accurately model diurnal birds' thermoregulatory responses to T-air using sensitivity analyses. Predicted EWL, metabolic rate and T-b corresponded tightly with observed values across T-air, with only minor discrepancies for EWL in two species at T-air approximate to 35 degrees C. Importantly, the model captured responses at T-air=30-40 degrees C, a range spanning threshold values for sublethal fitness costs associated with sustained hot weather in arid-zone birds. Our findings confirm how taxon-specific parameters together with biologically relevant morphological data can accurately model avian thermoregulatory responses to heat. Biophysical models can be used as a non-invasiveway to predict species' sensitivity to climate, accounting for organismal (e.g. physiology) and environmental factors (e.g. microclimates).",2023,10.1242/jeb.245066,226,15,NA,jeb245066,Avian thermoregulation; Biophysical ecology; Endotherms; Heat; NicheMapR
article,Thermal tolerance in the urban heat island: thermal sensitivity varies ontogenetically and differs between embryos of two sympatric ectotherms,"Hall, Joshua M. and Warner, Daniel A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Most studies of thermal tolerance use adults, but early-life stages (e.g. embryos) are often more sensitive to thermal agitation. Studies that examine effects on embryos rarely assess the potential for thermal tolerance to change with ontogeny or how effects differ among sympatric species, and often utilize unrealistic temperature treatments. We used thermal fluctuations from nests within the urbanheat island to determine how thermal tolerance of embryos changes across development and differs among two sympatric lizard species (Antis sagrei and Antis cristatefius). We applied fluctuations that varied in frequency and magnitude at different times during development and measured effects on embryo physiology and survival, and hatchling morphology, growth and survival. Thermal tolerance differed between the species by similar to 2 degrees C: embryos of A. sagrei, a lizard that prefers warmer, open-canopy microhabitats, were more robust to thermal stress than embryos of A. cristatellus, which prefers cooler, closed-canopy microhabitats. Moreover, thermal tolerance changed through development; however, the nature of this change differed between the species. For A. cristatellus, thermal tolerance was greatest mid-development. For A. sagrei, the relationship was not statistically clear. The greatest effects of thermal stress were on embryo and hatchling survival and embryo physiology. Hatchling morphology and growth were less affected. Inter-specific responses and the timing of stochastic thermal events with respect to development have important effects on embryo mortality. Thus, research that integrates ecologically meaningful thermal treatments, considers multiple life-history stages and examines interspecific responses will be critical to make robust predictions of the impacts of global change on wildlife.",2019,10.1242/jeb.210708,222,19,NA,jeb210708,Anolis; Critical thermal maximum; Early-life stage; Global change; Oxygen-limited thermal tolerance; Urbanization

In euryhaline fish, movement from seawater to freshwater (and vice versa) exposes the epithelium to massive changes in salinity and ionic concentrations. How does the olfactory system function in the face of such changes? The current study compared olfactory sensitivity in seawater- (35\%0) and brackish water-adapted seabass (5\%0) using extracellular multi-unit recording from the olfactory nerve. Seawater-adapted bass had higher olfactory sensitivity to amino acid odorants when delivered in seawater than in freshwater. Conversely, brackish water-adapted bass had largely similar sensitivities to the same odorants when delivered in seawater or freshwater, although sensitivity was still slightly higher in seawater. The olfactory system of seawater-adapted bass was sensitive to decreases in external {[}Ca2+], whereas brackish water-adapted bass responded to increases in {[}Ca2+]; both seawater- and brackish water-adapted bass responded to increases in external {[}Na+] but the sensitivity was markedly higher in brackish water-adapted bass. In seawater-adapted bass, olfactory sensitivity to L-alanine depended on external Ca2+ ions, but not Na+; brackish water-adapted bass did respond to L-alanine in the absence of Ca2+, albeit with lower sensitivity, whereas sensitivity was unaffected by removal of Na+ ions. A possible adaptation of the olfactory epithelium was the higher number of mucous cells in brackish water-adapted bass. The olfactory system of seabass is able to adapt to low salinities, but this is not immediate; further studies are needed to identify the processes involved.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246448,227,3,NA,jeb246448,Olfaction; Salinity; Osmoregulation; Calcium; Sodium; Seabass; Amino acids
article,The water channel aquaporin-1a1 facilitates movement of CO<sub>2</sub> and ammonia in zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) larvae,"Talbot, Krystle and Kwong, Raymond W. M. and Gilmour, Kathleen M. and Perry, Steve F.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The present study tested the hypothesis that zebrafish (Danio rerio) aquaporin-1a1 (AQP1a1) serves as a multi-functional channel for the transfer of the small gaseous molecules, CO2 and ammonia, as well as water, across biological membranes. Zebrafish embryos were microinjected with a translation-blocking morpholino oligonucleotide targeted to AQP1a1. Knockdown of AQP1a1 significantly reduced rates of CO2 and ammonia excretion, as well as water fluxes, in larvae at 4 days post fertilization (dpf). Because AQP1a1 is expressed both in ionocytes present on the body surface and in red blood cells, the haemolytic agent phenylhydrazine was used to distinguish between the contributions of AQP1a1 to gas transfer in these two locations. Phenylhydrazine treatment had no effect on AQP1a1-linked excretion of CO2 or ammonia, providing evidence that AQP1a1 localized to the yolk sac epithelium, rather than red blood cell AQP1a1, is the major site of CO2 and ammonia movements. The possibility that AQP1a1 and the rhesus glycoprotein Rhcg1, which also serves as a dual CO2 and ammonia channel, act in concert to facilitate CO2 and ammonia excretion was explored. Although knockdown of each protein did not affect the abundance of mRNA and protein of the other protein under control conditions, impairment of ammonia excretion by chronic exposure to high external ammonia triggered a significant increase in the abundance of AQP1a1 mRNA and protein in 4 dpf larvae experiencing Rhcg1 knockdown. Collectively, these results suggest that AQP1a1 in zebrafish larvae facilitates the movement of CO2 and ammonia, as well as water, in a physiologically relevant fashion.",2015,10.1242/jeb.129759,218,24,3931-3940,NA,CO2 excretion; Ammonia excretion; Aquaporin; Rh glycoprotein; High external ammonia
article,The amphibious fish <i>Kryptolebias marmoratus</i> uses different strategies to maintain oxygen delivery during aquatic hypoxia and air exposure,"Turko, Andy J. and Robertson, Cayleih E. and Bianchini, Kristin and Freeman, Megan and Wright, Patricia A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Despite the abundance of oxygen in atmospheric air relative to water, the initial loss of respiratory surface area and accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood of amphibious fishes during emersion may result in hypoxemia. Given that the ability to respond to low oxygen conditions predates the vertebrate invasion of land, we hypothesized that amphibious fishes maintain O-2 uptake and transport while emersed by mounting a co-opted hypoxia response. We acclimated the amphibious fish Kryptolebias marmoratus, which are able to remain active for weeks in both air and water, for 7 days to normoxic brackish water (15\%, similar to 21kPa O-2; control), aquatic hypoxia (similar to 3.6kPa), normoxic air (similar to 21 kPa) or aerial hypoxia (similar to 13.6kPa). Angiogenesis in the skin and bucco-opercular chamber was pronounced in air-versus water-acclimated fish, but not in response to hypoxia. Aquatic hypoxia increased the O-2-carrying capacity of blood via a large (40\%) increase in red blood cell density and a small increase in the affinity of hemoglobin for O-2 (P-50 decreased 11\%). In contrast, air exposure increased the hemoglobin O-2 affinity (decreased P-50) by 25\% without affecting the number of red blood cells. Acclimation to aerial hypoxia both increased the O-2-carrying capacity and decreased the hemoglobin O-2 affinity. These results suggest that O-2 transport is regulated both by O-2 availability and also, independently, by air exposure. The ability of the hematological system to respond to air exposure independent of O-2 availability may allow extant amphibious fishes, and may also have allowed primitive tetrapods to cope with the complex challenges of aerial respiration during the invasion of land.",2014,10.1242/jeb.110601,217,22,3988-3995,NA,Hemoglobin; Oxygen-carrying capacity; Hemoglobin-oxygen affinity; Air-breathing organ; Air-breathing fish; Mangrove rivulus

In March 2011, recruits were incubated at 31, 41, 70, 122 and 226 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) under ambient (493 mu atm) and high P-CO2 (878 mu atm). After 5 days, calcification was measured gravimetrically and survivorship estimated as the number of living recruits. Calcification was affected by the interaction of P-CO2 with light, and at 493 mu atm P-CO2 the response to light intensity resembled a positive parabola. At 878 mu atm P-CO2, the effect of light on calcification differed from that observed at 493 mu atm P-CO2, with the result that there were large differences in calcification between 493 mu atm and 878 mu atm P-CO2 at intermediate light intensities (ca. 70 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)), but similar rates of calcification at the highest and lowest light intensities. Survivorship was affected by light and P-CO2, and was highest at 122 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) in both P-CO2 treatments, but was unrelated to calcification. In June 2012 the experiment was repeated, and again the results suggested that exposure to high P-CO2 decreased calcification of P. damicornis recruits at intermediate light intensities, but not at lower or higher intensities. Together, our findings demonstrate that the effect of P-CO2 on coral recruits can be light dependent, with inhibitory effects of high P-CO2 on calcification at intermediate light intensities that disappear at both higher and lower light intensities.",2013,10.1242/jeb.080549,216,9,1570-1577,NA,Scleractinia; juvenile coral; climate change; bicarbonate; growth; Pocillopora damicornis

Changes in water temperature profoundly influence the performance of ectothermic aquatic organisms. This is an especially crucial issue for migratory fish, because they traverse multiple environments in order to reproduce. In externally fertilizing migratory fish, gametes are affected by water temperature indirectly, within the reproductive organ in which they are produced during migration, as well as directly, upon release into the surrounding medium at the spawning grounds. Both direct (after release) and indirect (during production) thermal impacts on gamete quality have been investigated, but never in conjunction. Here, we assessed the cumulative influence of temperature on brown trout, Salmo trutta, sperm quality during sperm production (male acclimation temperature) as well as upon release (sperm activation water temperature) on two consecutive dates during the brown trout spawning season. Early in the season, warm acclimation of males reduced their fertilization probability (lower sperm velocity) when compared with cold-acclimated males, especially when the activation water temperature was also increased beyond the thermal optimum (resulting in a lower proportion of motile sperm with lower velocity). Later in the season, sperm quality was unaffected by acclimation temperature and thermal sensitivity of sperm was reduced. These results give novel insights into the complex impacts of climate change on fish sperm, with implications for the reproduction and management of hatchery and wild trout populations in future climate scenarios.",2017,10.1242/jeb.156018,220,14,2513-2520,NA,Computer-assisted sperm analysis; Climate change; Motility; Reproduction; Salmonid; Temperature

Burrowing is considered an energetically expensive activity, yet the energy costs of burrowing and the potential impacts of multiple stressors (such as salinity stress and wave action) on bioenergetics and burrowing performance of marine bioturbators are not well understood. We investigated the effects of mechanical disturbance and salinity stress on the burrowing behavior, aerobic capacity and energy expense of digging in a common marine bioturbator, the soft-shell clam Mya arenaria from the Baltic Sea (control salinity 15). Mya arenaria showed large individual variability in the burrowing efficiency, with an average of similar to 7\% of the body energy reserves used per burial. Clams with higher mitochondrial capacity and lower energy expenditure per burial showed higher endurance. Acclimation for 3-4 weeks to low (5) or fluctuating (5-15) salinity reduced the burrowing speed and the number of times the clams can rebury but did not affect the mitochondrial capacity of the whole body or the gill. Acclimation to the fluctuating salinity shifted the predominant fuel use for burrowing from proteins to lipids. Our data indicate that the reduced burrowing performance of clams under the salinity stress is not due to the limitations of energy availability or aerobic capacity but must involve other mechanisms (such as impaired muscle performance). The reduction in the burrowing capacity of clams due to salinity stress may have important implications for survival, activity and ecological functions of the clams in shallow coastal ecosystems.",2018,10.1242/jeb.172643,221,4,NA,jeb172643,Bioturbation; Energy costs; Hyposalinity; Fluctuating salinity; Mitochondria; Aerobic capacity; Energy reserves; Proteins; Lipids; Glycogen

We examined cocoon architectural dimorphism in robin moths (Hyalophora cecropia), which construct multilayered silk-woven cocoons that possess either a `baggy' or `compact' morphology. These dimorphic cocoons reflect extended phenotypes that can enable survival during a critical developmental period ( pupal stage to adult emergence), with cocoons occurring either sympatrically or as monomorphic groups across different climatic regions in North America. We hypothesized that cocoon dimorphism is related to the cocoon's role as a mediating barrier for moisture. We predicted that the macro- and micro-architectural differences between the cocoon morphs would be consistent with this function. We compared the cocoon morphs in terms of their orientation when spun under natural field conditions, examined how these orientations affected cocoon water absorption under simulated rain trials, and performed material surface tests to compare the hydrophobicity of cocoons. We found that compact cocoons had traits that increased water resistance, as they had significantly greater hydrophobicity than baggy cocoons, because they absorbed less water and released water vapor faster. In contrast, the increased water absorptiveness of baggy cocoons can allow for greater moisture retention, a function related to the prevention of desiccation. Our study suggests that cocoon dimorphism in robin moths reflects distinct architectural syndromes, in which cocoons are spun to optimize either water resistance or retention. These different functions are consistent with strategies that act to respond to uncertain external environmental conditions that an individual might encounter during development.",2021,10.1242/jeb.239780,224,10,NA,jeb239780,Animal architecture; Architectural syndrome; Dimorphism; Extended phenotype; Moisture regulation; Silk cocoon; Silk moths

The emergence of non-invasive corticosterone (CORT) assays allows us to rapidly assess physiological responses to environmental change on a large scale. We lack, however, a basic understanding of how temperature affects CORT, and whether temperature and CORT interactively affect performance. Here, we examined the effects of elevated temperature on CORT and whole-organism performance in a terrestrial salamander, Plethodon cinereus, across a latitudinal gradient. Using water-borne hormone assays, we found that raising ambient temperature from 15 to 25 degrees C increased CORT release at a similar rate for salamanders from all sites. However, CORT release rates were higher overall in the warmest, southernmost site. Elevated temperatures also affected physiological performance, but the effects differed among sites. Ingestion rate increased in salamanders from the warmer sites but remained the same for those from cooler sites. Mass gain was reduced for most individuals, although this reduction was more dramatic in salamanders from the cooler sites. We also found a temperature-dependent relationship between CORT and food conversion efficiency (i.e. the amount of mass gained per unit food ingested). CORT was negatively related to food conversion efficiency at 25 degrees C but was unrelated at 15 degrees C. Thus, the energetic gains of elevated ingestion rates may be counteracted by elevated CORT release rates experienced by salamanders in warmer environments. By integrating multiple physiological metrics, we highlight the complex relationships between temperature and individual responses to warming climates.",2018,10.1242/jeb.178236,221,18,NA,jeb178236,Corticosterone; Performance; Amphibian; Ectotherm; Plethodontid; Climate; Water-bome hormones
article,Ocean acidification impacts sperm swimming performance and pHi in the New Zealand sea urchin <i>Evechinus</i> <i>chloroticus</i>,"Hudson, Michael E. and Sewell, Mary A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In sea urchins, spermatozoa are stored in the gonads in hypercapnic conditions (pH<7.0). During spawning, sperm are diluted in seawater of pH>8.0, and there is an alkalinization of the sperm's internal pH ( pHi) through the release of CO2 and H+. Previous research has shown that when pHi is above 7.2-7.3, the dynein ATPase flagellar motors are activated, and the sperm become motile. It has been hypothesized that ocean acidification (OA), which decreases the pH of seawater, may have a narcotic effect on sea urchin sperm by impairing the ability to regulate pHi, resulting in decreased motility and swimming speed. Here, we used data collected from the same individuals to test the relationship between pHi and sperm motility/ performance in the New Zealand sea urchin Evechinus chloroticus under near-future (2100) and far-future (2150) atmospheric PCO2 conditions (RCP 8.5: pH 7.77, 7.51). Decreasing seawater pH significantly negatively impacted the proportion of motile sperm, and four of the six computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) sperm performance measures. In control conditions, sperm had an activated pHi of 7.52. Evechinus chloroticus sperm could not defend pHi in future OA conditions; there was a stepped decrease in the pHi at pH 7.77, with no significant difference in mean pHi between pH 7.77 and 7.51. Paired measurements in the same males showed a positive relationship between pHi and sperm motility, but with a significant difference in the response between males.

S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The increased incidence of solar ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation has been proposed as an environmental stressor, which may help to explain the enigmatic decline of amphibian populations worldwide. Despite growing knowledge regarding the UV-induced biological effects in several amphibian models, little is known about the efficacy of DNA repair pathways. In addition, little attention has been given to the interplay between these molecular mechanisms with other physiological strategies that avoid the damage induced by sunlight. Here, DNA lesions induced by environmental doses of solar UVB and UVA radiation were detected in genomic DNA samples of treefrog tadpoles (Hypsiboas pulchellus) and their DNA repair activity was evaluated. These data were complemented by monitoring the induction of apoptosis in blood cells and tadpole survival. Furthermore, the tadpoles' ability to perceive and escape from UV wavelengths was evaluated as an additional strategy of photoprotection. The results show that tadpoles are very sensitive to UVB light, which could be explained by the slow DNA repair rates for both cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and pyrimidine (6,4) pyrimidone photoproducts (6,4PPs). However, they were resistant to UVA, probably as a result of the activation of photolyases during UVA irradiation. Surprisingly, a sensory mechanism that triggers their escape from UVB and UVA light avoids the generation of DNA damage and helps to maintain the genomic integrity. This work demonstrates the genotoxic impact of both UVB and UVA radiation on tadpoles and emphasizes the importance of the interplay between molecular and sensory mechanisms to minimize the damage caused by sunlight.",2015,10.1242/jeb.126672,218,19,3059-3067,NA,Amphibian decline; DNA photoproducts; Nucleotide excision repair; Photolyases; UV radiation

NKA and VA activity were measured in four distinct regions of the alimentary canal as follows: the combined foregut and anterior midgut, the posterior midgut, the Malpighian tubules and the hindgut. Both enzymes exhibited 10-20 times greater activity in the hindgut relative to all other areas. When larvae were reared in either ion-poor water (IPW) or freshwater (FW), no significant difference in hindgut enzyme activity was observed. However, in larvae reared in brackish water (BW), NKA and VA activity in the hindgut significantly decreased. Immunolocalization of NKA and VA in the hindgut revealed that the bulk of protein was located in the rectum. Therefore, K+ transport across the rectum was examined using SIET. Measurement of K+ flux along the rectum revealed a net K+ reabsorption that was reduced fourfold in BW-reared larvae versus larvae reared in FW or IPW. Inhibition of NKA with ouabain, VA with bafilomycin and K+ channels with charybdotoxin diminished rectal K+ reabsorption in FW- and IPW-reared larvae, but not BW-reared larvae.

Building from our previous research demonstrating that net calcification of Pocillopora verrucosa (2-13 cm diameter) was unaffected by P-CO2 (400 and 1000 mu atm) and temperature (26.5 and 29.7 degrees C), we sought generality to this outcome by testing how colony size modulates P-CO2 and temperature sensitivity in a branching acroporid. Together, these taxa represent two of the dominant lineages of branching corals on Indo-Pacific coral reefs. Two trials conducted over 2 years tested the hypothesis that the seasonal range in seawater temperature (26.5 and 29.2 degrees C) and a future P-CO2 (1062 mu atm versus an ambient level of 461 mu atm) affect net calcification of an ecologically relevant size range (5-20 cm diameter) of colonies of Acropora hyacinthus. As for P. verrucosa, the effects of temperature and P-CO2 on net calcification (mg day(-1)) of A. verrucosa were not statistically detectable. These results support the generality of a null outcome on net calcification of exposing intact colonies of branching corals to environmental conditions contrasting seasonal variation in temperature and predicted future variation in P-CO2. While there is a need to expand beyond an experimental culture relying on coral nubbins as tractable replicates, rigorously responding to this need poses substantial ethical and logistical challenges.",2020,10.1242/jeb.217000,223,8,NA,jeb217000,Scleractinia; Ocean acidification; Allometry

Todd and Williard, Amanda Southwood",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Water and salt concentrations in an animal's body fluids can fluctuate with changing environmental conditions, posing osmoregulatory challenges that require behavioral and physiological adjustments. The purpose of this study was to investigate body water dynamics in the estuarine diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin), a species that undergoes seasonal dormancy in salt marsh habitats. We conducted a field study to determine the total body water (\% TBW), water turnover rate (WTR) and daily water flux (DWF) of female terrapins in south eastern North Carolina pre-and post-emergence from winter dormancy. Terrapins were injected with {[}H-2] deuterium on two occasions and washout of the isotope was monitored by taking successive blood samples during the period of transition from dormancy to activity. The WTR and DWF of dormant terrapins were significantly lower than those of active terrapins (WTRdormant= 49.70 +/- 15.94 ml day(-1), WTRactive= 100.20 +/- 20.36 ml day(-1), DWFdormant= 10.52 +/- 2.92\% TBW day(-1), DWFactive= 21.84 +/- 7.30\% TBW day(-1)). There was no significant difference in \% TBW between dormant and active terrapins (75.05 +/- 6.19\% and 74.54 +/- 4.36\%, respectively).

article,Hotter nests produce hatchling lizards with lower thermal tolerance,"Dayananda, Buddhi and Murray, Brad R. and Webb, Jonathan K.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In many regions, the frequency and duration of summer heatwaves is predicted to increase in future. Hotter summers could result in higher temperatures inside lizard nests, potentially exposing embryos to thermally stressful conditions during development. Potentially, developmentally plastic shifts in thermal tolerance could allow lizards to adapt to climate warming. To determine how higher nest temperatures affect the thermal tolerance of hatchling geckos, we incubated eggs of the rock-dwelling velvet gecko, Amalosia lesueurii, at two fluctuating temperature regimes to mimic current nest temperatures (mean 23.2 degrees C, range 10-33 degrees C, `cold') and future nest temperatures (mean 27.0 degrees C, range 14-37 degrees C, `hot'). Hatchlings from the hot incubation group hatched 27 days earlier and had a lower critical thermal maximum (CTmax 38.7 degrees C) and a higher critical thermal minimum (CTmin 6.2 degrees C) than hatchlings from cold incubation group (40.2 and 5.7 degrees C, respectively). In the field, hatchlings typically settle under rocks near communal nests. During the hatching period, rock temperatures ranged from 13 to 59 degrees C, and regularly exceeded the CTmax of both hot- and cold-incubated hatchlings. Because rock temperatures were so high, the heat tolerance of lizards had little effect on their ability to exploit rocks as retreat sites. Instead, the timing of hatching dictated whether lizards could exploit rocks as retreat sites; that is, cold-incubated lizards that hatched later encountered less thermally stressful environments than earlier hatching hot-incubated lizards. In conclusion, we found no evidence that CTmax can shift upwards in response to higher incubation temperatures, suggesting that hotter summers may increase the vulnerability of lizards to climate warming.",2017,10.1242/jeb.152272,220,12,2159-2165,NA,Climate warming; Developmental plasticity; Incubation temperature; Amalosia lesueurii; Critical thermal limits
article,Is warmer better? Decreased oxidative damage in notothenioid fish after long-term acclimation to multiple stressors,"Enzor, Laura A. and Place, Sean P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Antarctic fish of the suborder Notothenioidei have evolved several unique adaptations to deal with subzero temperatures. However, these adaptations may come with physiological trade-offs, such as an increased susceptibility to oxidative damage. As such, the expected environmental perturbations brought on by global climate change have the potential to significantly increase the level of oxidative stress and cellular damage in these endemic fish. Previous single stressor studies of the notothenioids have shown they possess the capacity to acclimate to increased temperatures, but the cellular-level effects remain largely unknown. Additionally, there is little information on the ability of Antarctic fish to respond to ecologically relevant environmental changes where multiple variables change concomitantly. We have examined the potential synergistic effects that increased temperature and P-CO2 have on the level of protein damage in Trematomus bernacchii, Pagothenia borchgrevinki and Trematomus newnesi, and combined these measurements with changes in total enzymatic activity of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in order to gauge tissue-specific changes in antioxidant capacity. Our findings indicate that total SOD and CAT activity levels displayed only small changes across treatments and tissues. Short-term acclimation to decreased seawater pH and increased temperature resulted in significant increases in oxidative damage. Surprisingly, despite no significant change in antioxidant capacity, cellular damage returned to near-basal levels, and significantly decreased in T. bernacchii, after long-term acclimation. Overall, these data suggest that notothenioid fish currently maintain the antioxidant capacity necessary to offset predicted future ocean conditions, but it remains unclear whether this capacity comes with physiological trade-offs.",2014,10.1242/jeb.108431,217,18,3301-3310,NA,Ocean acidification; Oxidative damage; Superoxide dismutase; Thermal stress; Notothenioid; Global climate change

Gummy sharks (Mustelus antarcticus) and school sharks (Galeorhinus galeus) use the same Tasmanian estuary as a nursery ground; however, each species has distinct distribution patterns that are coincident with changes in local environmental conditions, such as increases in salinity. We hypothesized that these differences were directly related to differential physiological tolerances to high salinity. To test this hypothesis, we exposed wild, juvenile school and gummy sharks to an environmentally relevant hypersaline (120\% SW) event for 48 h. Metabolic rate decreased 20-35\% in both species, and gill Na+/K+-ATPase activity was maintained in gummy sharks but decreased 37\% in school sharks. We measured plasma ions (Na+, K+, Cl-) and osmolytes {[}urea and trimethylamine oxide (TMAO)], and observed a 33\% increase in plasma Na+ in gummy sharks with hyperosmotic exposure, while school sharks displayed a typical ureosmotic increase in plasma urea (similar to 20\%). With elevated salinity, gill TMAO concentration increased by 42\% in school sharks and by 30\% in gummy sharks. Indicators of cellular stress (heat shock proteins HSP70, 90 and 110, and ubiquitin) significantly increased in gill and white muscle in both a species- and a tissue-specific manner.

However, initial tachycardia (22.4 +/- 2.8 versus 12.8 +/- 1.1 min(-1); P<0.01) was not reversed by acclimation (21.0 +/- 1.9 min(-1)).

One approach to understanding the impact of rising temperatures on animals and their ability to cope with climate change is to quantify variation in thermal-sensitive traits. Here, we examined the thermal biology, temperature dependence and thermal plasticity of bite force (endurance and magnitude) in Diplolaemus leopardinus, an aggressive and territorial lizard endemic to Mendoza province, Argentina. Our results indicate that this lizard behaves like a moderate thermoregulator that uses the rocks of its environment as the main heat source. Bite endurance was not influenced by head morphometry and body temperature, whereas bite force was influenced by head length and jaw length, and exhibited thermal dependence. Before thermal acclimation treatments, the maximum bite force for D. leopardinus occurred at the lowest body temperature and fell sharply with increasing body temperature. After acclimation treatments, lizards acclimated at higher temperatures exhibited greater bite force. Bite force showed phenotypic plasticity, which reveals that leopard iguanas are able to maintain (and even improve) their bite force under a rising-temperature scenario.",2020,10.1242/jeb.221382,223,12,NA,jeb221382,Global warming; Performance; Phenotypic plasticity; Reptiles; Thermal acclimation

Here, we quantified gene expression and sensitivity to ocean acidification across a set of developmental stages in the rice coral, Montipora capitata. Embryos and swimming larvae were exposed to pH treatments of 7.8 (ambient), 7.6 (low) and 7.3 (extreme low) from fertilization to 9 days post-fertilization. Embryo and larval volume, and stage-specific gene expression were compared between treatments to determine the effects of acidified seawater on early development. Although there was no measurable size differentiation between pH treatments at the fertilized egg and prawn chip (9 h post-fertilization) stages, early gastrulae and larvae raised in reduced pH treatments were significantly smaller than those raised in ambient seawater, suggesting an energetic cost to developing under low pH. However, no differentially expressed genes were found until the swimming larval stage. Notably, gene expression patterns of larvae developing at pH 7.8 and pH 7.3 were more similar than those of larvae developing at pH 7.6. Larvae from pH 7.6 showed upregulation of genes involved in cell division, regulation of transcription, lipid metabolism and response to oxidative stress in comparison to the other two treatments. Although low pH appears to increase energetic demands and trigger oxidative stress in larvae, the developmental process is robust to this at a molecular level, with the swimming larval stage reached in all pH treatments.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243187,225,19,NA,jeb243187,DESeq2; MZT; Maternal provisioning; RNA-seq; Montipora capitata

In small north temperate zone lakes, cold water piscivores rely on nearshore prey; however, this region exceeds the optimal temperature of the foraging species during summer. To cope, piscivores make short excursions into the nearshore to feed and return to cold water to digest their meal, but the physiological impacts of these repeated acute exposures to warm water are not well understood. We exposed juvenile lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) to treatments where they were held at similar to 10 degrees C and exposed to either 17 or 22 degrees C for 5-10 min daily for 53 days mimicking warm-water forays. Control fish, held at an average temperature of similar to 10 degrees C but not exposed to thermal variation, consumed more food and grew slightly faster than heat challenged fish, with no clear differences in body condition, hepatosomatic index, ventricle mass, or muscle concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase and cytochrome c oxidase. Aerobic metabolic rates measured at 10 degrees C indicated that standard metabolic rates (SMR) were similar among treatments; however, fish that were repeatedly exposed to 17 degrees C had higher maximum metabolic rates (MMR) and aerobic scopes (AS) than control fish and those repeatedly exposed to 22 degrees C. There were no differences in MMR or AS between fish exposed to 22 degrees C and control fish. These results suggest that although SMR of fish are robust to repeated forays into warmer environments, MMR displays plasticity, allowing fish to be less constrained aerobically in cold water after briefly occupying warmer waters.",2019,10.1242/jeb.198143,222,12,NA,jeb198143,Metabolic rate; Aerobic scope; Behavioural thermoregulation; Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush); Physiology; Temperature; Climate change

However, the colonisation history of flightless Pachyrhynchus weevils, inferred from genetic data, reveals their ability to travel long distances to colonise remote islands. Here, we used captive-bred Pachyrhynchus jitanasaius to analyse (i) the physiological tolerance of weevils (egg, larva and adult stages) to different levels of salinity; (ii) the survival rate of larvae in a simulated ocean environment in the laboratory; and (iii) the survival rate of larvae in a field experiment in the ocean using fruit of the fish poison tree floating on the Kuroshio current in the Pacific Ocean. We found that the survival rate of larvae in seawater was lower than in fresh water, although if the larvae survived 7 days of immersion in seawater, some emerged as adults in the subsequent rearing process. No adults survived for more than 2 days, regardless of salinity level. After floating separately for 6 days in salt water in the laboratory and in the Kuroshio current, two of 18 larvae survived in the fruit. This study provides the first empirical evidence that P. jitanasaius larvae can survive `rafting' on ocean currents and that the eggs and larvae of these weevils have the highest probability of crossing the oceanic barrier. This ability may facilitate over-the-sea dispersal of these flightless insects and further shape their distribution and speciation pattern in the Western Pacific islands.",2018,10.1242/jeb.190488,221,24,NA,jeb190488,Barringtonia asiatica; Kuroshio current; Oceanic islands; Pachyrhynchus jitanasaius; Salinity tolerance; Fish poison tree; Taiwan
article,"Master of all trades: thermal acclimation and adaptation of cardiac function in a broadly distributed marine invasive species, the European green crab, <i>Carcinus maenas</i>","Tepolt, Carolyn K. and Somero, George N.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"As global warming accelerates, there is increasing concern about how ecosystems may change as a result of species loss and replacement. Here, we examined the thermal physiology of the European green crab (Carcinus maenas Linnaeus 1758), a globally invasive species, along three parallel thermal gradients in its native and invasive ranges. At each site, we assessed cardiac physiology to determine heat and cold tolerance and acclimatory plasticity. We found that, overall, the species is highly tolerant of both heat and cold, and that it survives higher temperatures than co-occurring native marine crustaceans. Further, we found that both heat and cold tolerance are plastic in response to short-term acclimation (18-31 days at either 5 or 25 degrees C). Comparing patterns within ranges, we found latitudinal gradients in thermal tolerance in the native European range and in the invasive range in eastern North America. This pattern is strongest in the native range, and likely evolved there. Because of a complicated invasion history, the latitudinal pattern in the eastern North American invasive range may be due either to rapid adaptation post-invasion or to adaptive differences between the ancestral populations that founded the invasion. Overall, the broad thermal tolerance ranges of green crabs, which may facilitate invasion of novel habitats, derive from high inherent eurythermality and acclimatory plasticity and potentially adaptive differentiation among populations. The highly flexible physiology that results from these capacities may represent the hallmark of a successful invasive species, and may provide a model for success in a changing world.",2014,10.1242/jeb.093849,217,7,1129-1138,NA,Acclimatory plasticity; Cardiac physiology; Local adaptation; Species invasion; Thermal tolerance

Studying desert-adapted species provides a unique opportunity to investigate the survival strategies employed by organisms in some of the harshest habitats on Earth. Two of the primary challenges faced in desert environments are maintaining water balance and thermoregulation. We collected data in a simulated desert environment and a captive colony of cactus mice (Peromyscus eremicus) and used lab-based experiments with real time physiological measurements; energy expenditure, water loss rate and respiratory exchange rate, to characterize the response to water deprivation. Mice without access to water had significantly lower energy expenditures and in turn, reduced water loss compared to mice with access to water after the first 24 h of the experiment. Additionally, we observed significant mass loss that is probably due to dehydration-associated anorexia a response to limit fluid loss by reducing waste and the solute load as well as allowing water reabsorption from the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract. Finally, we observed body temperature correlated with sex, with males without access to water maintaining body temperature when compared with hydrated males, whereas body temperature decreased for females without access to water, suggesting daily metabolic depression in females.",2023,10.1242/jeb.246386,226,23,NA,jeb246386,Energy expenditure; Peromyscus; Physiology; Respirometry; Total water loss; Dehydration
article,"Alanine, proline and urea are major organic osmolytes in the snail <i>Theodoxus fluviatilis</i> under hyperosmotic stress","Wiesenthal, Amanda A. and Mueller, Christian and Harder, Katrin and Hildebrandt, Jan-Peter",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Hyperosmotic stress may result in osmotic volume loss from the body to the environment in animals that cannot control the water permeability of their integument. Euryhaline animals (which have a wide tolerance range of environmental salinities) have generally evolved the ability to counteract cell volume shrinkage by accumulating inorganic and organic osmolytes within their cells to balance internal and external osmolalities. Molluscs use very different combinations of amino acids and amino acid derivatives to achieve this goal. Theodoxus fluviatilis is a neritid gastropod that is distributed not only in limnic habitats in Europe but also in brackish waters (e.g. along the shoreline of the Baltic Sea). Animals from brackish sites survive better in high salinities than animals from freshwater locations. The results of the present study indicate that these differences in salinity tolerance cannot be explained by differences in the general ability to accumulate amino acids as organic osmolytes. Although there may be differences in the metabolic pathways involved in osmolyte accumulation in foot muscle tissue, the two groups of animals accumulate amino acid mixtures equally well when stepwise acclimated to their respective maximum tolerable salinity for extended periods. Among these amino acids, alanine and proline, as well as the osmolyte urea, hold a special importance for cell volume preservation in T. fluviatilis under hyperosmotic stress. It is possible that the accumulation of various amino acids during hyperosmotic stress occurs via hydrolysis of storage proteins, while alanine and proline are probably newly synthesised under conditions of hyperosmotic stress in the animals.",2019,10.1242/jeb.193557,222,3,NA,jeb193557,Free amino acids; Salinity acclimation; Salinity tolerance; Phenotypic plasticity; Genetic adaptation; Gastropod

During winter in the NW Mediterranean Sea, the European sardine Sardina pilchardus naturally experiences caloric restriction owing to a decrease in the diversity and quantity of plankton. However, ongoing global warming has had deleterious effects on plankton communities such that food shortages may occur throughout the year, especially under warm conditions in the summer. We investigated the interactive effects of temperature and food availability on sardine metabolism by continuously monitoring whole-animal respiration of groups of control (fed) and food-deprived sardines over a 60-day experiment in winter (12 degrees C) or summer (20 degrees C) conditions under natural photoperiod. In addition, we measured mitochondrial respiration of red muscle fibres, biometric variables and energy reserves of individuals sampled at 30 and 60days. This revealed that winter food deprivation elicits energy saving mechanisms at whole animal and cellular levels by maintaining a low metabolism to preserve energy reserves, allowing high levels of survival. By contrast, despite energy saving mechanisms at the mitochondrial level, whole animal metabolic rate was high during food deprivation in summer, causing increased consumption of energy reserves at the muscular level and high mortality after 60days. Furthermore, a 5-day re-feeding did not improve survival, and mortalities continued, suggesting that long-term food deprivation at high temperatures causes profound stress in sardines that potentially impairs nutrient absorption.",2023,10.1242/jeb.244984,226,2,NA,jeb244984,Bioenergetics; Red muscle; Mitochondria; Respirometry; Global warming; Small pelagic fish
article,The effect of discontinuous gas exchange on respiratory water loss in grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae) varies across an aridity gradient,"Huang, Shu-Ping and Talal, Stav and Ayali, Amir and Gefen, Eran",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The significance of discontinuous gas-exchange cycles (DGC) in reducing respiratory water loss (RWL) in insects is contentious. Results from single-species studies are equivocal in their support of the classic `hygric hypothesis' for the evolution of DGC, whereas comparative analyses generally support a link between DGC and water balance. In this study, we investigated DGC prevalence and characteristics and RWL in three grasshopper species (Acrididae, subfamily Pamphaginae) across an aridity gradient in Israel. In order to determine whether DGC contributes to a reduction in RWL, we compared the DGC characteristics and RWL associated with CO2 release (transpiration ratio, i.e. the molar ratio of RWL to CO2 emission rates) among these species. Transpiration ratios of DGC and continuous breathers were also compared intraspecifically. Our data show that DGC characteristics, DGC prevalence and the transpiration ratios correlate well with habitat aridity. The xericadapted Tmethis pulchripennis exhibited a significantly shorter burst period and lower transpiration ratio compared with the other two mesic species, Ocneropsis bethlemita and Ocneropsis lividipes. However, DGC resulted in significant water savings compared with continuous exchange in T. pulchripennis only. These unique DGC characteristics for T. pulchripennis were correlated with its significantly higher mass-specific tracheal volume. Our data suggest that the origin of DGC may not be adaptive, but rather that evolved modulation of cycle characteristics confers a fitness advantage under stressful conditions.

article,A desert bee thermoregulates with an abdominal convector during flight,"Johnson, Meredith G. and Glass, Jordan R. and Harrison, Jon F.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Flying endothermic insects thermoregulate, likely to improve flight performance. Males of the Sonoran Desert bee, Centris caesalpiniae, seek females at aggregations beginning at sunrise and cease flight near midday when the air temperature peaks. To identify the thermoregulatory mechanisms for C. caesalpiniae males, we measured tagma temperature, wingbeat frequency, water loss rate, metabolic rate and tagma mass of flying bees across shaded air temperatures of 19-38 degrees C. Surface area, wet mass and dry mass declined with air temperature, suggesting that individual bees do not persist for the entire morning. The largest bees may be associated with cool, early mornings because they are best able to warm themselves and/or because they run the risk of overheating in the hot afternoons. Thorax temperature was high (38-45 degrees C) and moderately well regulated, while head and abdomen temperatures were cooler and less controlled. The abdominal temperature excess ratio increased as air temperature rose, indicating active heat transfer from the pubescent thorax to the relatively bare abdomen with warming. Mass-specific metabolic rate increased with time, and air and thorax temperatures, but wingbeat frequency did not vary. Mass-specific water loss rate increased with air temperature, but this was a minor mechanism of thermoregulation. Using a heat budget model, we showed that whole-body convective conductance more than doubled through the morning, providing strong evidence that the primary mechanism of regulating thorax temperature during flight for these bees is increased use of the abdomen as a convector at higher air temperatures.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244147,225,19,NA,jeb244147,Heat budget; Thermal biology; Thermoregulation; Biophysical ecology; Solitary bees

Rhodnius prolixus is the most important haematophagous vector of Chagas disease in the north of South America and a model organism in insect physiology. Although there have been some studies on patterns of gas exchange and metabolic rates, there is little information regarding water loss in R. prolixus. We investigated whether there is any modulation of water loss and metabolic rate under different requirements for saving water. We measured simultaneously CO2 production, water emission and activity in individual insects in real time by open-flow respirometry at different temperatures (15, 25 and 35 degrees C) and post-feeding days (0, 5, 13 and 29). We found: (1) a clear drop in metabolic rate between 5 and 13 days after feeding that cannot be explained by activity and (2) a decrease in water loss rate with increasing starvation level, by a decrease in cuticular water loss during the first 5 days after feeding and a drop in the respiratory component thereafter. We calculated the surface area of the insects and estimated cuticular permeability. In addition, we analysed the pattern of gas exchange; the change from a cyclic to a continuous pattern was affected by temperature and activity, but it was not affected by the level of starvation. Modulation of metabolic and water loss rates with temperature and starvation could help R. prolixus to be more flexible in tolerating different periods of starvation, which is adaptive in a changing environment with the uncertainty of finding a suitable host.",2014,10.1242/jeb.109298,217,24,4414-4422,NA,Flow-through respirometry; Respiratory water loss; Cuticular permeability; CO2 emission rate

Of the primary host-associated cues known to attract bed bugs - CO2, odors, heat-heat has received little attention as an independent stimulus. We evaluated the effects of target temperatures ranging from 23 to 48 degrees C on bed bug activation, orientation and feeding. Activation and orientation responses were assessed using a heated target in a circular arena. All targets heated above ambient temperature activated bed bugs (initiated movement) and elicited oriented movement toward the target, with higher temperatures generally resulting in faster activation and orientation. The distance over which bed bugs could orient toward a heat source was measured using a 2-choice T-maze assay. Positive thermotaxis was limited to distances < 3 cm. Bed bug feeding responses on an artificial feeding system increased with feeder temperature up to 38 and 43 degrees C, and declined precipitously at 48 degrees C. In addition, bed bugs responded to the relative difference between ambient and feeder temperatures. These results highlight the wide range of temperatures that elicit activation, orientation and feeding responses in bed bugs. In contrast, the ability of bed bugs to correctly orient towards a heated target, independently of other cues, is limited to very short distances (< 3 cm).

This study focuses on the gastric caecum of the larvae, an organ that has not been widely studied. We provide the first measurements of H+, K+ and Na+ fluxes at the distal and proximal gastric caecum, and have shown that they differ in the two regions, consistent with previously reported regionalization of ion transporters. Moreover, we have shown that the regionalization of vacuolar H+-ATPase and Na+/K+-ATPase is altered when larvae are reared in brackish water (30\% seawater) relative to freshwater. Measurements of luminal Na+ and K+ concentrations also show a 5-fold increase in Na+/K+ ratio in the caecal lumen in larvae reared in brackish water relative to freshwater, whereas transepithelial potential and luminal pH were unchanged. Calculated electrochemical potentials reveal changes in the active accumulation of Na+ and K+ in the lumen of the gastric caecum of freshwater versus brackish water larvae. Together with the results of previous studies of the larval midgut, our results show that the caecum is functionally distinct from the adjacent anterior midgut, and may play an important role in osmoregulation as well as uptake of nutrients.",2017,10.1242/jeb.163170,220,17,3172-3180,NA,Mosquito; V-ATPase; Na+/K+-ATPase; Ion-selective microelectrodes; Ionoregulation; Gastric caecum
article,"Meal consumption is ineffective at maintaining or correcting water balance in a desert lizard, <i>Heloderma suspectum</i>","Wright, Christian D. and Jackson, Marin L. and DeNardo, Dale F.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Many xeric organisms maintain water balance by relying on dietary and metabolic water rather than free water, even when free water may be available. For such organisms, hydric state may influence foraging decisions, since meal consumption is meeting both energy and water demands. To understand foraging decisions it is vital to understand the role of dietary water in maintaining water balance. We investigated whether meal consumption was sufficient to maintain water balance in captive Gila monsters (Heloderma suspectum) at varying levels of dehydration. Gila monsters could not maintain water balance over long time scales through meal consumption alone. Animals fed a single meal took no longer to dehydrate than controls when both groups were deprived of free water. Additionally, meal consumption imparts an acute short-term hydric cost regardless of hydration state. Meal consumption typically resulted in a significant elevation in osmolality at 6 h post-feeding, and plasma osmolality never fell below pre-feeding levels despite high water content (similar to 70\%) of meals. These results failed to support our hypothesis that dietary water is valuable to Gila monsters during seasonal drought. When considered in conjunction with previous research, these results demonstrate that Gila monsters, unlike many xeric species, are heavily reliant on seasonal rainfall and the resulting free-standing water to maintain water balance.",2013,10.1242/jeb.080895,216,8,1439-1447,NA,dehydration; dietary water; water balance; reptile
article,Thermal strategies vary with life history stage,"Truebano, Manuela and Fenner, Phillip and Tills, Oliver and Rundle, Simon D. and Rezende, Enrico L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"With both global surface temperatures and the incidence and intensity of extreme temperature events projected to increase, the assessment of species' sensitivity to chronic and acute changes in temperature has become crucial. Sensitivity predictions are based predominantly on adult responses, despite the fact that early life stages may be more vulnerable to thermal challenge. Here, we compared the sensitivity of different life history stages of the intertidal gastropod Littorina obtusata using thermal death time curves, which incorporate the intensity and duration of heat stress, and used these to calculate upper critical thermal limits (CTmax) and sensitivity to temperature change (z). Early (larval) life stages had both a lower CTmax and a lower z than adults, suggesting they are less good at withstanding short-term extreme thermal challenges but better able to survive moderate temperatures in the long term. This result supports the predicted trade-off between acute and chronic tolerance to thermal stress, and is consistent with the different thermal challenges that these stages encounter in the intertidal zone. We conclude that different life history stages employ different thermal strategies that may be adaptive. Our findings caution against the use of predictions of the impact of global warming that are based on only adult responses and, hence, which may underestimate vulnerability.",2018,10.1242/jeb.171629,221,8,NA,jeb171629,TDT curves; Thermal tolerance; CTmax; Thermal sensitivity; Trade-off

To test the role of life-stage and stress-intensity dependence in eliciting enhanced tolerance under subsequent stress encounters, we initially conditioned pediveliger Pacific geoduck (Panopea generosa) larvae to ambient and moderately elevated P-CO2 (920 mu atm and 2800 mu atm, respectively) for 110 days. Then, clams were exposed to ambient, moderate or severely elevated P-CO2 (750, 2800 or 4900 mu atm, respectively) for 7 days and, following 7 days in ambient conditions, a 7-day third exposure to ambient (970 mu atm) or moderate P-CO2 (3000 mu atm). Initial conditioning to moderate P-CO2 stress followed by second and third exposure to severe and moderate P-CO2 stress increased respiration rate, organic biomass and shell size, suggesting a stress-intensity-dependent effect on energetics. Additionally, stressacclimated clams had lower antioxidant capacity compared with clams under ambient conditions, supporting the hypothesis that stress over postlarval-to-juvenile development affects oxidative status later in life.

We agree and expand on the importance of cross-disciplinary integration and transparency to improve consensus building and advance climate change research in experimental biology. We investigated reproducible research practices in experimental biology through a review of open data and analysis code associated with empirical studies on three debated paradigms and for unrelated studies published in leading journals in comparative physiology and behavioural ecology over the last 10 years. Nineteen per cent of studies on the three paradigms had open data, and 3.2\% had open code. Similarly, 12.1\% of studies in the journals we examined had open data, and 3.1\% had open code. Previous research indicates that only 50\% of shared datasets are complete and re-usable, suggesting that fewer than 10\% of studies in experimental biology have usable open data. Encouragingly, our results indicate that reproducible research practices are increasing over time, with data sharing rates in some journals reaching 75\% in recent years. Rigorous empirical research in experimental biology is key to understanding the mechanisms by which climate change affects organisms, and ultimately promotes evidence-based conservation policy and practice. We argue that a greater adoption of open science practices, with a particular focus on FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-usable) data and code, represents a much-needed paradigm shift towards improved transparency, cross-disciplinary integration, and consensus building to maximize the contributions of experimental biologists in addressing the impacts of environmental change on living organisms.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243559,225,"1, SI",NA,jeb243559,Behavioural ecology; Comparative physiology; GOLT; OCLTT; Ocean acidification; Open data; Transdisciplinary; Transparency

We quantified thermoregulatory responses to high air temperature (T-a) in similar to 100-g representatives of three orders, namely, the African cuckoo (Cuculus gularis, Cuculiformes), lilac-breasted roller (Coracias caudatus, Coraciiformes) and Burchell's starling (Lamprotornis australis, Passeriformes). All three species initiated respiratory mechanisms to increase evaporative heat dissipation when body temperature (T-b) approached 41.5 degrees C in response to increasing Ta, with gular flutter observed in cuckoos and panting in rollers and starlings. Resting metabolic rate and evaporative water loss increased by quantitatively similar magnitudes in all three species, although maximum rates of evaporative water loss were proportionately lower in starlings. Evaporative cooling efficiency {[}defined as the ratio of evaporative heat loss (EHL) to metabolic heat production (MHP)] generally remained below 2.0 in cuckoos and starlings, but reached a maximum of similar to 3.5 in rollers. The high value for rollers reveals a very efficient evaporative cooling mechanism, and is similar to EHL/MHP maxima for similarly sized columbids which very effectively dissipate heat via cutaneous evaporation. This unexpected phylogenetic variation among the orders tested in the physiological mechanisms of heat dissipation is an important step toward determining the evolution of heat tolerance traits in desert birds.",2018,10.1242/jeb.174870,221,6,NA,jeb174870,Evaporative heat loss; Heat dissipation; Upper critical limits of thermoneutrality; Panting; Gular flutter

We thus non-invasively measured these variables from wild-caught star-nosed moles exposed to normoxia (21\% O-2) or acute graded hypoxia (21-6\% O-2). Surprisingly, star-nosed moles did not exhibit a blunted HVR or decreased Tb in hypoxia, and only manifested a significant, albeit small (<8\%), depression of metabolic rate at 6\% O-2 relative to normoxic controls.

C. and Cramp, Rebecca L. and Wang, Yadong and Mager, Edward M. and Dwyer, Ross G. and Franklin, Craig E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Estuarine crocodiles, Crocodylus porosus, inhabit freshwater, estuarine and marine environments. Despite being known to undertake extensive movements throughout and between hypoosmotic and hyperosmotic environments, little is known about the role of the cloaca in coping with changes in salinity. We report here that, in addition to the well-documented functional plasticity of the lingual salt glands, the middle of the three cloacal segments (i.e. the urodaeum) responds to increased ambient salinity to enhance solute-coupled water absorption. This post-renal modification of urine serves to conserve water when exposed to hyperosmotic environments and, in conjunction with lingual salt gland secretions, enables C. porosus to maintain salt and water balance and thereby thrive in hyperosmotic environments. Isolated epithelia from the urodaeum of 70\% seawater-acclimated C. porosus had a strongly enhanced short-circuit current (an indicator of active ion transport) compared with freshwater-acclimated crocodiles. This enhanced active ion absorption was driven by increased Na+/K+-ATPase activity, and possibly enhanced proton pump activity, and was facilitated by the apical epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) and/or the apical Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE2), both of which are expressed in the urodaeum. NHE3 was expressed at very low levels in the urodaeum and probably does not contribute to solute-coupled water absorption in this cloacal segment. As C. porosus does not appear to drink water of salinities above 18 ppt, observations of elevated short-circuit current in the rectum as well as a trend for increased NHE2 expression in the oesophagus, the anterior intestine and the rectum suggest that dietary salt intake may stimulate salt and possibly water absorption by the gastrointestinal tract of C. porosus living in hyperosmotic environments.",2020,10.1242/jeb.210732,223,4,NA,jeb210732,Osmoregulation; Salt and water balance; Crocodylians; NKA; ENaC; NHE2; NHE3; Phenotypic plasticity; Salt glands; Cloaca; Spatial ecology; Telemetry

The life cycle of Aedes aegypti, the yellow fever mosquito, consists of a terrestrial adult and an aquatic larval life stage. Developing in coastal waters can expose larvae to fluctuating salinity, causing salt and water imbalance, which is addressed by two prime osmoregulatory organs - the Malpighian tubules (MTs) and anal papillae (AP). Voltage-gated ion channels (VGICs) have recently been implicated in the regulation of ion transport in the osmoregulatory epithelia of insects. In the current study, we: (i) generated MT transcriptomes of freshwater-acclimated and brackish water-exposed larvae of Ae. aegypti, (ii) detected expression of several voltage-gated Ca2+, K+, Na+ and non-ionselective ion channels in the MTs and AP using transcriptomics, PCR and gel electrophoresis, (iii) demonstrated that mRNA abundance of many altered significantly following brackish water exposure, and (iv) immunolocalized CaV1, NALCN, TRP/Painless and KCNH8 in the MTs and AP of larvae using custom-made antibodies. We found CaV1 to be expressed in the apical membrane of MTs of both larvae and adults, and its inhibition to alter membrane potentials of this osmoregulatory epithelium.

Exposure to temperatures above optimal during development is known to reduce adult body size but how it affects the development and scaling of body parts remains unclear. In bees, a reduction in body size and/or a reduction in body parts, such as the antennae, tongue and wings, and how they scale with body size (i.e. their allometry) could severely affect their fitness. To date, it remains unclear how temperature affects body size and the scaling of morphological traits in bees. To address this knowledge gap, we exposed both males and workers of Bombus terrestris to elevated temperature during development and assessed the effects on (i) the size of morphological traits and (ii) the allometry between these traits. Colonies were exposed to optimal (25 degrees C) or stressful (33 degrees C) temperatures. We then measured the body size, wing size, antenna and tongue length, as well as the allometry between these traits. We found that workers were smaller and the antennae of both castes were reduced at the higher temperature. However, tongue length and wing size were not affected by developmental temperature. The allometric scaling of the tongue was also affected by developmental temperature. Smaller body size and antennae could impair both individual and colony fitness, by affecting foraging efficiency and, consequently, colony development.

At air temperatures (T-a) exceeding body temperature (T-b), all five species showed increases in Tb to maximum values around 44-45 degrees C, accompanied by rapid increases in resting metabolic rate above clearly defined upper critical limits of thermoneutrality and increases in evaporative water loss (EWL) to levels equivalent to 670-860\% of baseline rates at thermoneutral T-a. Maximum cooling capacity, quantified as the fraction of metabolic heat production dissipated evaporatively, ranged from 1.20 to 2.17, consistent with the known range for passerines, and well below the corresponding ranges for columbids and caprimulgids. Heat tolerance limit (HTL, the maximum T-a tolerated) scaled positively with body mass, varying from 46 degrees C in yellow-plumed honeyeaters to 52 degrees C in a single apostlebird, but was lower than that of three southern African ploceid passerines investigated previously.

Artemia franciscana were hatched at 20 ppt (designated control salinity) and were then exposed to 10, 30, 40 or 50 ppt either chronically (days 1-15) or only on days 1-6, 7-9, 10-12 or 13-15. On day 15, maturity was assessed and morphometric characteristics, including mass, total body length, tail length and width, length of the third swimming appendage and eye diameter, were measured. Maturation and morphometry on day 15 were influenced by the exposure window and salinity dose. Artemia franciscana were generally larger following exposure to 10 and 40 ppt during days 1-6 and 7-9 when compared with days 10-12 and 13-15, in part due to a higher percentage of mature individuals. Exposure to different salinities on days 1-6 produced the greatest differences in morphometry, and thus this appears to be a period in development when A. franciscana is particularly sensitive to salinity.

Although gas exchange is known to increase with the opening of these spiracles, it is not clear how this event relates to gas flow through the tracheal system. We examined the relationship between respiratory airflow and spiracle activity in a ventilating insect, the hissing cockroach, Gromphadorhina portentosa, to better understand the complexity of insect respiratory function. Using simultaneous video recordings of multiple spiracular valves, we found that abdominal spiracles open and close in unison during periods of ventilation. Additionally, independent recordings of CO2 release from the abdominal and thoracic regions and observations of hyperoxic tracer gas movement indicate that air is drawn into the thoracic spiracles and expelled from the abdominal spiracles. Our video recordings suggest that this unidirectional flow is driven by abdominal contractions that occur when the abdominal spiracles open. The spiracles then close as the abdomen relaxes and fills with air from the thorax. Therefore, the respiratory system of the hissing cockroach functions as a unidirectional pump through the coordinated action of the spiracles and abdominal musculature.

However, empirical evidence indicates that interactive effects exist. Here, we investigated the response of individual standard metabolic rate (SMR) to annual temperature range and forecasted temperature rises of 0.6-1.2 degrees C above the current maxima, under the conservative climate change scenario IPCC RCP2.6. As a model organism, we used the amphipod Gammarus insensibilis, collected across latitudes along the western coast of the Adriatic Sea down to the southernmost limit of the species' distributional range, with individuals varying in body mass (0.4-13.57 mg). Overall, we found that the effect of temperature on SMR is mass dependent. Within the annual temperature range, the mass-specific SMR of small/young individuals increased with temperature at a greater rate (activation energy: E=0.48 eV) than large/old individuals (E=0.29 eV), with a higher metabolic level for high-latitude than low-latitude populations. However, under the forecasted climate conditions, the mass-specific SMR of large individuals responded differently across latitudes. Unlike the higher-latitude population, whose mass-specific SMR increased in response to the forecasted climate change across all size classes, in the lower-latitude populations, this increase was not seen in large individuals. The larger/older conspecifics at lower latitudes could therefore be the first to experience the negative impacts of warming on metabolism-related processes. Although the ecological collapse of such a basic trophic level (aquatic amphipods) owing to climate change would have profound consequences for population ecology, the risk is significantly mitigated by phenotypic and genotypic adaptation.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244842,225,22,NA,jeb244842,Metabolic scaling; Body size; Temperature; Global warming; Species distribution; Thermal tolerance
article,"Cross-generation plasticity in cold hardiness is associated with diapause, but not the non-diapause developmental pathway, in the blow fly <i>Calliphora vicina</i>","Coleman, Paul C. and Bale, Jeffrey S. and Hayward, Scott A. L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Predicting insect responses to global climate change involves understanding cross-generation effects of temperature. The majority of temperate insects overwinter in a state of diapause, a pre-emptive response to winter conditions associated with increased cold hardiness. Diapause is often induced following maternal adult detection of an environmental cue signifying the onset of winter, whilst diapause is initiated in a subsequent life stage and/or generation. Continued global warming will expose adults to higher late-autumn temperatures, whilst diapause life stages will still experience prolonged winter cold. The cross-generation effect of temperature was investigated by acclimating adult Calliphora vicina to present-day (15 degrees C) and future (20 degrees C) late-autumn conditions and assessing cold-hardiness in diapause (D15 and D20) and non-diapause (ND15 and ND20) progeny. A cross-generation plasticity in cold hardiness was associated with D but not ND larvae. D15 larvae exhibited an enhanced ability to suppress internal freezing (supercooling point=- 18.9 +/- 0.9 degrees C) compared with D20 (- 15.3 +/- 0.8 degrees C), and displayed a greater tolerance of prolonged exposure to - 4 degrees C (LT50= 26.0 +/- 1.0 and 11.4 +/- 1.1 days, respectively) and - 8 degrees C (5.1 +/- 1.1 and 3.0 +/- 1.1 days, respectively). These changes were associated with a reduced glucose content in D15 (2.4 +/- 0.3 g mg(-1)) compared with D20 (3.0 +/- 0.3 g mg(-1)) larvae. In conclusion, C. vicina adults exposed to warmer autumn conditions during diapause induction will produce larvae with a reduced cold hardiness capacity, which could negatively impact winter survival.

article,Ontogenetic variation in metabolic rate-temperature relationships during larval development,"Powers, Sean D. and Grayson, Kristine L. and Martinez, Eloy and Agosta, Salvatore J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Predictive models of ectotherm responses to environmental change often rely on thermal performance data from the literature. For insects, the majority of these data focus on two traits, development rate and thermal tolerance limits. Data are also often limited to the adult stage. Consequently, predictions based on these data generally ignore other measures of thermal performance and do not account for the role of ontogenetic variation in thermal physiology across the complex insect life cycle. Theoretical syntheses for predicting metabolic rate also make similar assumptions despite the strong influence of body size as well as temperature on metabolic rate. The aim of this study was to understand the influence of ontogenetic variation on ectotherm physiology and its potential impact on predictive modeling. To do this, we examined metabolic rate-temperature (MR-T) relationships across the larval stage in a laboratory strain of the spongy moth (Lymantria dispar dispar). Routine metabolic rates (RMRs) of larvae were assayed at eight temperatures across the first five instars of the larval stage. After accounting for differences in body mass, larval instars showed significant variation in MR-T. Both the temperature sensitivity and allometry of RMR increased and peaked during the third instar, then declined in the fourth and fifth instar. Generally, these results show that insect thermal physiology does not remain static during larval ontogeny and suggest that ontogenetic variation should be an important consideration when modeling thermal performance.",2024,10.1242/jeb.247912,227,14,NA,jeb247912,Ectotherm; Invasive species; Lymantria dispar dispar; Routine metabolic rate; Thermal performance

F.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The H+-ATPase-rich (HR) cells of zebrafish larvae are a sub-type of ion-transporting cell located on the yolk sac epithelium that are responsible for Na+ uptake and H+ extrusion. Current models of HR cell ion transport mechanisms in zebrafish larvae are well established, but little is known about the involvement of the various ion transport pathways in regulating intracellular acid-base status. Here, a ratiometric imaging techniquewas developed and validated to monitor intracellular pH (pHi) continuously in larval zebrafish HRcells in vivo. Gene knockdown or CRISPR/Cas9 knockout approaches were used to evaluate the roles of the two principal apical membrane acid excretory pathways, the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE3b; slc9a3.2) and the H+-ATPase (atpv1aa). Additionally, the role of HR cell cytosolic carbonic anhydrase (CAc) was investigated because of its presumed role in providing H+ for Na+/H+ exchange and H+-ATPase. The temporal pattern and extent of intracellular acidification during exposure of fish to 1\% CO2 and the extent of post-CO2 alkalisation were altered markedly in fish experiencing knockdown/knockout of CAc, NHE3b or H+-ATPase. Although there were slight differences among the three knockdown/knockout experiments, the typical response was a greater degree of intracellular acidification during CO2 exposure and a reduced capacity to restore pHi to baseline levels post-hypercapnia. The metabolic alkalosis and subsequent acidification associated with 20 mmol l(-1) NH4Cl exposure and its washout were largely unaffected by gene knockdown. Overall, the results suggest markedly different mechanisms of intracellular acid-base regulation in zebrafish HR cells depending on the nature of the acid-base disturbance.",2020,10.1242/jeb.212928,223,5,NA,jeb212928,Ionic regulation; Acid-base balance; Sodium-hydrogen exchanger (NHE); Carbonic anhydrase; Danio rerio; Morpholino knockdown; Ammonium chloride; Hypercapnia
article,Strong negative effects of simulated heat waves in a tropical butterfly,"Fischer, Klaus and Klockmann, Michael and Reim, Elisabeth",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Climate change poses a significant challenge to all natural systems on Earth. Especially increases in extreme weather events such as heat waves have the potential to strongly affect biodiversity, though their effects are poorly understood because of a lack of empirical data. Therefore, we here explore the sensitivity of a tropical ectotherm, which are in general believed to have a low warming tolerance, to experimentally simulated climate change using ecologically realistic diurnal temperature cycles. Increasing the mean temperature permanently by 3 degrees C had mostly minor effects on developmental traits in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana. Simulated heat waves (strongly elevated temperatures for some time though retaining the same overall temperature mean), in contrast, caused strong negative effects by prolonging development time (by up to 10\%) and reducing body mass (-21\%), especially when combined with reduced relative humidity. Detrimental effects were carried over into the adult stage, diminishing subsequent performance. Most strikingly, higher temperatures suppressed adult immune function (haemocytes: -54\%, lysozyme activity: -32\%), which may potentially change the way species interact with antagonists. Heat waves thus reduced fitness parameters by 10-25\% for development time and body mass and by up to 54\% for immune parameters even in this plastic and widespread butterfly, exemplifying the potentially dramatic impact of extreme weather events on biodiversity.",2014,10.1242/jeb.106245,217,16,2892-2898,NA,Climate warming; Extreme weather event; Global change; Immune function; Tropical ectotherm; Warming tolerance

B. and Wall, Christopher B. and Cunning, Ross and Dove, Sophie and Gates, Ruth D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The absorbtion of human-emitted CO2 by the oceans (elevated P-CO2) is projected to alter the physiological performance of coral reef organisms by perturbing seawater chemistry (i.e. ocean acidification). Simultaneously, greenhouse gas emissions are driving ocean warming and changes in irradiance (through turbidity and cloud cover), which have the potential to influence the effects of ocean acidification on coral reefs. Here, we explored whether physiological impacts of elevated P-CO2, on a coral-algal symbiosis (Pocillopora acuta-Symbiodiniaceae) are mediated by light and/or temperature levels. In a 39 day experiment, elevated P-CO2 (962 versus 431 patm P-CO2) had an interactive effect with midday light availability (400 versus 800 pmol photons m(-2) s(-1)) and temperature (25 versus 29 degrees C) on areal gross and net photosynthesis, for which a decline at 29 degrees C was ameliorated under simultaneous high-Pm and high-light conditions. Light-enhanced dark respiration increased under elevated P-CO2 and/or elevated temperature. Symbiont to host cell ratio and chlorophyll a per symbiont increased at elevated temperature, whilst symbiont areal density decreased. The ability of moderately strong light in the presence of elevated P-CO2 to alleviate the temperature-induced decrease in photosynthesis suggests that higher substrate availability facilitates a greater ability for photochemical quenching, partially offsetting the impacts of high temperature on the photosynthetic apparatus. Future environmental changes that result in moderate increases in light levels could therefore assist the P. acuta holobiont to cope with the `one-two punch' of rising temperatures in the presence of an acidifying ocean.",2020,10.1242/jeb.223198,223,20,NA,jeb223198,Scleractinia; Irradiance; Multiple stressors; Ocean acidification; Ocean warming; Symbiodiniaceae

Gordon and Seale, Andre P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"This study characterizes the differences in osmoregulatory capacity among Mozambique tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus, reared in freshwater (FW), in seawater (SW) or under tidally driven changes in salinity. This was addressed through the use of an abrupt exposure to a change in salinity. We measured changes in: (1) plasma osmolality and prolactin (PRL) levels; (2) pituitary expression of prolactin (PRL) and its receptors, PRLR1 and PRLR2; (3) branchial expression of PRLR1, PRLR2, Na+/Cl- co-transporter (NCC), Na+/K+/2Cl(-) co-transporter (NKCC), alpha 1a and alpha 1b isoforms of Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), aquaporin 3 (AQP3) and Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3). Mozambique tilapia reared in a tidal environment successfully adapted to SW while fish reared in FW did not survive a transfer to SW beyond the 6 h sampling. With the exception of CFTR, the change in the expression of ion pumps, transporters and channels was more gradual in fish transferred from tidally changing salinities to SW than in fish transferred from FW to SW. Upon transfer to SW, the increase in CFTR expression was more robust in tidal fish than in FW fish. Tidal and SW fish successfully adapted when transferred to FW. These results suggest that Mozambique tilapia reared in a tidally changing salinity, a condition that more closely represents their natural history, gain an adaptive advantage compared with fish reared in FW when facing a hyperosmotic challenge.",2015,10.1242/jeb.112664,218,5,731-739,NA,Ion transporter; Osmoregulation; Prolactin; Rearing salinity; Tidal cycle; Tilapia

Although several recent studies have assessed their physiological responses to heat, most of them have focused solely on arid-zone species. We investigated thermoregulatory responses to heat in eight small-sized songbirds occurring in the Mediterranean Basin, where heatwaves are becoming more frequent and intense. Specifically, we determined their heat tolerance limits (HTLs) and evaporative cooling efficiency, and evaluated their current and future vulnerabilities to heat in southwestern Iberia, a Mediterranean climate warming hotspot. To do this, we exposed birds to an increasing profile of air temperatures (T-a) and measured resting metabolic rate (RMR), evaporative water loss (EWL), evaporative cooling efficiency (the ratio between evaporative heat loss and metabolic heat production) and body temperature (T-b). HTL ranged between 40 and 46 degrees C across species, and all species showed rapid increases in RMR, EWL and T-b in response to increasing T-a. However, only the crested lark (Galerida cristata) achieved an evaporative cooling efficiency greater than 1. The studied songbirds currently experience summer T-a maxima that surpass the upper critical temperatures of their thermoneutral zone and even their HTL. Our estimates indicate that five of the eight species will experience moderate risk of lethal dehydration by the end of the century. We argue that the limited heat tolerance and evaporative cooling efficiency of small-sized Mediterranean songbirds make them particularly vulnerable to heatwaves, which will be exacerbated under future climate change scenarios.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244848,225,23,NA,jeb244848,Climate warming; Heat stress; Heatwaves; Passerines; Thermal physiology; Thermoregulatory traits

Thus, there has been interest in using surface water management to mitigate problems associated with localized elephant overabundance. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying the elephant's water dependence remain unclear. Although thermoregulation is likely an important driver, the relationship between thermoregulation, water use and climate has not been quantified. We measured skin surface temperature of and cutaneous water loss from 13 elephants (seven African, 3768 +/- 642 kg; six Asian, 3834 +/- 498 kg) and determined the contribution of evaporative cooling to their thermal and water budgets across a range of air temperatures (8-33 degrees C). We also measured respiratory evaporative water loss and resting metabolic heat production on a subset of elephants (N=7). The rate of cutaneous evaporative water loss ranged between 0.31 and 8.9 g min(-1) m(-2) for Asian elephants and 0.26 and 6.5 g min(-1) m(-2) for African elephants. Simulated thermal and water budgets using climate data from Port Elizabeth, South Africa, and Okaukuejo, Namibia, suggested that the 24-h evaporative cooling water debt incurred in warm climates can be more than 4.5 times that incurred in mesic climates. This study confirms elephants are obligate evaporative coolers but suggests that classification of elephants as water dependent is insufficient given the importance of climate in determining the magnitude of this dependence.

To understand new possible pathways of sensitivity to CO2 in marine ectotherms, we examined the metabolic plasticity of S. spallanzanii exposed in situ to elevated P-CO2 by measuring fundamental metabolite and carbonic anhydrase concentrations. We show that whilst this species can survive elevated P-CO2 conditions in the short term, and exhibits an increase in energy metabolism, this is accompanied by a significant decrease in carbonic anhydrase concentration. These homeostatic changes are unlikely to be sustainable in the longer term, indicating S. spallanzanii may struggle with future high P-CO2 conditions.",2015,10.1242/jeb.117705,218,14,2148-2151,NA,Individual approach; P-CO2; Climate change; Homeostatic capacity; Annelid; Mediterranean Sea
article,Tolerance of an acutewarming challenge declines with body mass in Nile tilapia: evidence of a link to capacity for oxygen uptake,"Blasco, Felipe R. and Taylor, Edwin W. and Leite, Cleo A. C. and Monteiro, Diana A. and Rantin, F. Tadeu and McKenzie, David J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"It has been proposed that larger individuals within fish species may be more sensitive to global warming, as a result of limitations in their capacity to provide oxygen for aerobic metabolic activities. This could affect size distributions of populations in a warmer world but evidence is lacking. In Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus (n=18, mass range 21-313 g), capacity to provide oxygen for aerobic activities (aerobic scope) was independent of mass at an acclimation temperature of 26 degrees C. Tolerance of acute warming, however, declined significantly with mass when evaluated as the critical temperature for fatigue from aerobic swimming (CTSmax). The CTSmax protocol challenges a fish to meet the oxygen demands of constant aerobic exercise while their demands for basal metabolism are accelerated by incremental warming, culminating in fatigue. CTSmax elicited pronounced increases in oxygen uptake in the tilapia but the maximum rates achieved prior to fatigue declined very significantly with mass. Mass-related variation in CTSmax and maximum oxygen uptake rates were positively correlated, which may indicate a causal relationship. When fish populations are faced with acute thermal stress, larger individuals may become constrained in their ability to perform aerobic activities at lower temperatures than smaller conspecifics. This could affect survival and fitness of larger fish in a future world with more frequent and extreme heatwaves, with consequences for population productivity.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244287,225,16,NA,jeb244287,Exercise performance; Respiratory metabolism; Thermal tolerance

However, in these studies the possible interaction between the corresponding stress factors in natural environments has not been taken into consideration. We investigated changes in heat and desiccation resistance of adult Drosophila simulans after short-term exposures to different temperatures (35, 31 and 18 degrees C) in combination with high and low relative humidity (ca. 90 and 20\%, respectively). Hardening under extreme conditions (35 or 31 degrees C and low relative humidity) commonly resulted in higher resistance to heat and desiccation as compared with other less stressful combinations of temperature and humidity levels. The concentration of the heat-shock protein Hsp70 in the experimental flies increased following almost all applied treatments. Life span of the hardened flies under non-stressful conditions was reduced irrespective of the stress dose, indicating a fitness cost for the plastic responses. The results of the study show that hardening using combined heat and desiccation stress can be very efficient with regard to induction of plastic responses improving tolerance to both types of stress. This may favour adaptation to hot and dry climatic conditions, though the negative effects on fitness are likely to constrain evolution of such plastic responses.",2013,10.1242/jeb.092502,216,24,4601-4607,NA,insect; heat stress; desiccation stress; hardening; stress resistance; heat-shock proteins; longevity
article,Life stages differ in plasticity to temperature fluctuations and uniquely contribute to adult phenotype in <i>Onthophagus taurus</i> dung beetles,"Carter, Amanda W. and Sheldon, Kimberly S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Adaptive thermal plasticity allows organisms to adjust their physiology to cope with fluctuating environments. However, thermal plasticity is rarely studied in response to thermal variability and is often measured in a single life stage. Plasticity in response to thermal variability likely differs from responses to constant temperature or acute stress. In addition, life stages likely differ in their plasticity, and responses in one stage may be affected by the experiences in a previous stage. Increasing the resolution with which we understand thermal plasticity in response to thermal variation across ontogeny is crucial to understanding how organisms cope with the thermal variation in their environment and to estimating the capacity of plasticity to mitigate costs of rapid environmental change. We wanted to know whether life stages differ in their capacity for thermal plasticity under temperature fluctuations. We reared Onthophagus taurus dung beetles in either low or high temperature fluctuation treatments and quantified thermal plasticity of metabolism of pupae and adults. We found that adults were thermally plastic and pupae were not. Next, we tested whether the plasticity observed in the adult life stage was affected by the thermal conditions during development. We again used low and high temperature fluctuation treatments and reared individuals in one condition through all egg to pupal stages. At eclosion, we switched half of the individuals in each treatment to the opposite fluctuation condition and, later, measured thermal plasticity of metabolism in adults. We found that temperature conditions experienced during the adult stage, but not egg to pupal stages, affect adult thermal plasticity. However, temperature fluctuations during development affect adult body size, suggesting that some aspects of the adult phenotype are decoupled from previous life stages and others are not. Our data demonstrate that life stages mount different responses to temperature variability and uniquely contribute to the adult phenotype. These findings emphasize the need to broadly integrate the life cycle into studies of phenotypic plasticity and physiology; doing so should enhance our ability to predict organismal responses to rapid global change and inform conservation efforts.",2020,10.1242/jeb.227884,223,20,NA,jeb227884,Acclimation; Body size; Coleoptera; Development; Dung beetle; Metabolism; Ontogeny; Temperature fluctuation
article,Thermal strategies of king penguins during prolonged fasting in water,"Lewden, Agnes and Enstipp, Manfred R. and Bonnet, Batsheva and Bost, Caroline and Georges, Jean-Yves and Handrich, Yves",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Most animals experience periods of unfavourable conditions, challenging their daily energy balance. During breeding, king penguins fast voluntarily for up to 1.5 months in the colony, after which they replenish their energy stores at sea. However, at sea, birds might encounter periods of low foraging profitability, forcing them to draw from previously stored energy (e.g. subcutaneous fat). Accessing peripheral fat stores requires perfusion, increasing heat loss and thermoregulatory costs. Hence, how these birds balance the conflicting demands of nutritional needs and thermoregulation is unclear. We investigated the physiological responses of king penguins to fasting in cold water by: (1) monitoring tissue temperatures, as a proxy of tissue perfusion, at four distinct sites (deep and peripheral); and (2) recording their oxygen consumption rate while birds floated inside a water tank. Despite frequent oscillations, temperatures of all tissues often reached near-normothermic levels, indicating that birds maintained perfusion to peripheral tissues throughout their fasting period in water. The oxygen consumption rate of birds increased with fasting duration in water, while it was also higher when the flank tissue was warmer, indicating greater perfusion. Hence, fasting king penguins in water maintained peripheral perfusion, despite the associated greater heat loss and, therefore, thermoregulatory costs, probably to access subcutaneous fat stores. Hence, the observed normothermia in peripheral tissues of king penguins at sea, upon completion of a foraging bout, is likely explained by their nutritional needs: depositing free fatty acids (FFA) in subcutaneous tissues after profitable foraging or mobilizing FFA to fuel metabolism when foraging success was insufficient.",2017,10.1242/jeb.168807,220,24,4600-4611,NA,Thermoregulation; Seabirds; Subcutaneous fat; Normothermia; Fat mobilization; Heat loss

High temperatures adversely affect the ability to dissipate heat, which has negative effects on reproductive output. The cumulative effects on growth of F1 offspring after weaning, and future reproductive performance of offspring, remain uncertain. In this study, F1 mice weaned from mothers lactating at 21 and 32.5 degrees C were housed at 21 degrees C from day 19 until day 56 of age, during which food intake and body mass were measured. The F1 adult females that were weaned at the two temperatures were bred and then exposed to 32.5 degrees C during lactation. Energy intake and milk output, and litter size and mass, were determined. The F1 adults weaned at 32.5 degrees C consumed less food and had lower body mass than their counterparts weaned at 21 degrees C. Several visceral organs or reproductive tissues were significantly lower in mass in F1 weaned at 32.5 degrees C than at 21 degrees C. The exposure to 32.5 degrees C significantly decreased energy intake, milk output and litter mass in F1 adult females during lactation. The F1 adult females weaned at 32.5 degrees C produced less milk and raised lighter pups than those previously weaned at 21 degrees C.

Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) acclimated to sea water have higher proportions of compact myocardium and display stroke volume-mediated elevations in resting cardiac output relative to freshwater-acclimated trout, probably to meet the higher metabolic needs of osmoregulatory functions. Here, we tested the hypothesis that cardiorespiratory performance of rainbow trout in sea water is more dependent on coronary perfusion by assessing the effects of coronary ligation on cardiorespiratory function in resting and exhaustively exercised trout acclimated to fresh water or sea water. While ligation only had minor effects on resting cardiorespiratory function across salinities, cardiac function after chasing to exhaustion was impaired, presumably as a consequence of atrioventricular block. Ligation reduced maximum O2 consumption rate by 33\% and 17\% in fish acclimated to sea water and fresh water, respectively, which caused corresponding 41\% and 17\% reductions in aerobic scope. This was partly explained by different effects on cardiac performance, as maximum stroke volume was only significantly impaired by ligation in sea water, resulting in 38\% lower maximum cardiac output in seawater compared with 28\% in fresh water. The more pronounced effect on respiratory performance in sea water was presumably also explained by lower blood O2 carrying capacity, with ligated seawater-acclimated trout having 16\% and 17\% lower haemoglobin concentration and haematocrit, respectively, relative to ligated freshwater trout. In conclusion, we show that the coronary circulation allows seawater-acclimated trout to maintain aerobic scope at a level comparable to that in fresh water.",2023,10.1242/jeb.244733,226,4,NA,jeb244733,Physiology; Exercise; Coronary circulation; Salinity

Blood circulates inside vessels and it must be pumped through narrow tubular stylets to be ingested. We analysed the respiratory pattern and the energetic cost of taking a blood meal in Rhodnius prolixus using flow-through and stop-flow respirometry to measure carbon dioxide emission, oxygen consumption and water loss before and during feeding. We observed an increase of up to 17-fold in the metabolic rate during feeding and a change in the respiratory pattern, which switched from a discontinuous cyclic pattern during resting to a continuous pattern when the insects started to feed, remaining in this condition unchanged for several hours. The energetic cost of taking a meal was significantly higher when bugs fed on a living host, compared with feeding on an artificial feeder. No differences were observed between feeding on blood or on saline solution in vitro, revealing that the substrate for feeding (vessels versus membrane) and not the nature of the fluid was responsible for such a difference in the energetic cost. Water loss significantly increased during feeding, but did not vary with feeding method or type of food. The mean respiratory quotient in resting bugs was 0.83, decreasing during feeding to 0.52.

article,Oxygen delivery does not limit thermal tolerance in a tropical eurythermal crustacean,"Ern, Rasmus and Do Thi Thanh Huong and Nguyen Thanh Phuong and Wang, Tobias and Bayley, Mark",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In aquatic environments, rising water temperatures reduce water oxygen content while increasing oxygen demand, leading several authors to propose cardiorespiratory oxygen transport capacity as the main determinant of aquatic animal fitness. It has also been argued that tropical species, compared with temperate species, live very close to their upper thermal limit and hence are vulnerable to even small elevations in temperature. Little, however, is known about physiological responses to high temperatures in tropical species. Here we report that the tropical giant freshwater shrimp (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) maintains normal growth when challenged by a temperature rise of 6 degrees C above the present day average (from 27 degrees C to 33 degrees C). Further, by measuring heart rate, gill ventilation rate, resting and maximum oxygen uptake, and hemolymph lactate, we show that oxygen transport capacity is maintained up to the critical maximum temperature around 41 degrees C. In M. rosenbergii heart rate and gill ventilation rate increases exponentially until immediately below critical temperatures and at 38 degrees C animals still retained more than 76\% of aerobic scope measured at 30 degrees C, and there was no indication of anaerobic metabolism at the high temperatures.

Nonetheless, basal heat tolerance often correlates negatively with tolerance plasticity ('trade-off hypothesis'), a constraint that could limit plasticity benefits. We tested the trade-off hypothesis at the individual level with respect to heat hardening in two lizard species, Anolis carolinensis and Anolis sagrei. Heat hardening is a rapid increase in heat tolerance after heat shock that is rarely measured in reptiles but is generally considered to be a first line of physiological defense against heat. We also employed a biophysical model of operative habitat temperatures to estimate the performance consequences of hardening under ecologically relevant conditions. Anolis carolinensis hardened by 2 h post-heat shock and maintained hardening for several hours. However, A. sagrei did not harden. Biophysical models showed that hardening in A. carolinensis reduces their overheating risk in the field. Therefore, while not all lizards heat harden, hardening has benefits for species that can. We initially found a negative relationship between basal tolerance and hardening within both species, consistent with the trade-off hypothesis. However, permutation analyses showed that the apparent trade-offs could not be differentiated from statistical artifact. We found the same result when we re-analyzed published data supporting the trade-off hypothesis in another lizard species. Our results show that false positives may be common when testing the trade-off hypothesis. Statistical approaches that account for this are critical to ensure that the hypothesis, which has broad implications for thermal adaptation and responses to warming, is assessed appropriately.",2021,10.1242/jeb.240994,224,7,NA,jeb240994,Phenotypic plasticity; Trade-offs; Thermal physiology; Biophysical model; Operative temperature; Climate change

These extreme weather events often occur simultaneously and may alter organismal physiology, yet their combined impacts remain largely unknown. Here, we experimentally investigated physiological responses of a temperate ectotherm, the asp viper (Opera aspis), to a simulated heatwave and drought. We applied a two-by-two factorial design by manipulating the daily temperature cycle (control versus heatwave) and the water availability (water available versus water deprived) over a month followed by exposure to standard thermal conditions with ad libitum access to water. Simulated heatwave and water deprivation additively increased mass loss, while water deprivation led to greater plasma osmolality (dehydration). Mass gain from drinking after the treatment period was higher in vipers from the heatwave and water-deprived group, suggesting that thirst was synergistically influenced by thermal and water constraints. Heatwave conditions and water deprivation also additively increased baseline corticosterone levels but did not influence basal metabolic rate and plasma markers of oxidative stress. Our results demonstrate that a short-term exposure to combined heatwave and drought can exacerbate physiological stress through additive effects, and interactively impact behavioral responses to dehydration.

Measurements were made by means of a flow-through CO2 analyser and a coulometric respirometer. Under the elytra of these beetles there is a more or less tightly enclosed space, the subelytral cavity (SEC). When the cavity was tightly closed, air pressure inside was sub-atmospheric, as a result of oxygen uptake into the tracheae by the beetle. In about half of the beetles, regular opening-closing rhythms of the SEC were observed visually and also recorded; these beetles displayed a discontinuous gas exchange pattern. The SEC opened at the start of the CO2 burst and was immediately closed. On opening, a rapid passive suction inflow of atmospheric air into the SEC occurred, recorded coulometrically as a sharp upward peak. As the CO2 burst lasted beyond the closure of the SEC, we suggest that most of the CO2 was expelled through the mesothoracic spiracles.

article,Temperature and UV-B-insensitive performance in tadpoles of the ornate burrowing frog: an ephemeral pond specialist,"Kern, Pippa and Cramp, Rebecca L. and Franklin, Craig E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Animals may overcome the challenges of temperature instability through behavioural and physiological mechanisms in response to short-and long-term temperature changes. When ectotherms face the challenge of large diel temperature fluctuations, one strategy may be to reduce the thermal sensitivity of key traits in order to maintain performance across the range of temperatures experienced. Additional stressors may limit the ability of animals to respond to these thermally challenging environments through changes to energy partitioning or interactive effects. Ornate burrowing frog (Platyplectrum ornatum) tadpoles develop in shallow ephemeral pools that experience high diel thermal variability (> 20 degrees C) and can be exposed to high levels of UV-B radiation. Here, we investigated how development in fluctuating versus stable temperature conditions in the presence of high or low UV-B radiation influences thermal tolerance and thermal sensitivity of performance traits of P. ornatum tadpoles. Tadpoles developed in either stable (24 C) or fluctuating temperatures (18-32 degrees C) under high or low UV-B conditions. Tadpoles were tested for upper critical thermal limits, thermal dependence of resting metabolic rate and maximum burst swimming performance. We hypothesised that developmental responses to thermal fluctuations would increase thermal tolerance and reduce thermal dependence of physiological traits, and that trade-offs in the allocation of metabolic resources towards repairing UV-B-induced damage may limit the ability to maintain performance over the full range of temperatures experienced. We found that P. ornatum tadpoles were thermally insensitive for both burst swimming performance, across the range of temperatures tested, and resting metabolic rate at high temperatures independent of developmental conditions. Maintenance of performance led to a trade-off for growth under fluctuating temperatures and UV-B exposure. Temperature treatment and UV-B exposure had an interactive effect on upper critical thermal limits possibly due to the upregulation of the cellular stress response. Thermal independence of key traits may allow P. ornatum tadpoles to maintain performance in the thermal variability inherent in their environment.",2014,10.1242/jeb.097006,217,8,1246-1252,NA,Thermal fluctuation; Thermal insensitivity; Thermal tolerance; Metabolic rate

The body's capacity to dissipate heat is reduced by high ambient temperatures, increasing the risk of hyperthermia. Exposure to wind, a pervasive environmental factor for most terrestrial animals, is known to increase heat loss, but its effects on the reproductive performance of small mammals remains unclear. In the present study, the effects of wind on the energy budgets, resting metabolic rate and milk energy output (MEO) were measured in lactating Swiss mice at 21 and 32.5 degrees C. Females kept at 32.5 degrees C had a significantly lower resting metabolic rate, food intake and MEO, and lighter offspring, than those kept at 21 degrees C. However, exposure to wind increased the asymptotic food intake of females kept at 32.5 degrees C by 22.5\% (P<0.01), their MEO by 20.7\% (P<0.05) and their litter mass by 17.6\% (P<0.05). The body temperature of females kept at 32.5 degrees C was significantly higher during lactation than that of females kept at 21 degrees C, but this difference was reduced by exposure to wind. These findings suggest that exposure to wind considerably improves reproductive performance, increasing the fitness of small mammals while undergoing hot temperatures during heatwaves.",2020,10.1242/jeb.231415,223,17,NA,jeb231415,Energy budget; Heat dissipation; Hot temperature; Lactation; Reproductive performance; Swiss mice; Wind

For example, euryhaline crustaceans show predictable changes in the expression of ion-transporter genes during salinity transfers, although studies have typically been limited to specific genes, taxa and ecosystems of interest. Here, we investigated responses to salinity change at multiple organizational levels in five species of shrimp representing at least three independent invasions of the anchialine ecosystem, defined as habitats with marine and freshwater influences with spatial and temporal fluctuations in salinity. Although all five species were generally strong osmoregulators, salinity-induced changes in gill physiology and gene expression were highly species specific. While some species exhibited patterns similar to those of previously studied euryhaline crustaceans, instances of distinct and atypical patterns were recovered from closely related species. Species-specific patterns were found when examining: (1) numbers and identities of differentially expressed genes, (2) salinity-induced expression of genes predicted a priori to play a role in osmoregulation, and (3) salinity-induced expression of orthologs shared among all species. Notably, ion transport genes were unchanged in the atyid Halocaridina rubra while genes normally associated with vision and light perception were among those most highly upregulated. Potential reasons for species-specific patterns are discussed, including variation among anchialine habitats in salinity regimes and divergent evolution in anchialine taxa. Underexplored mechanisms of osmoregulation in crustaceans revealed here by the application of transcriptomic approaches to ecologically and taxonomically understudied systems are also explored.",2019,10.1242/jeb.211920,222,24,NA,jeb211920,Euryhalinity; RNA-Seq; Acclimation; Atyidae
article,"ATP-induced reversed thermal sensitivity of O<sub>2</sub> binding in both major haemoglobin polymorphs of the non-endothermic Atlantic cod, <i>Gadus morhua</i>","Nelson, Charlotte and Barlow, Samantha L. and Berenbrink, Michael",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Atlantic cod is a species that is affected by climate change, with some populations being exposed to higher temperatures than others. The two polymorphs of its major haemoglobin type (Hbl) show an inverse change in frequency along a latitudinal temperature dine in the North East Atlantic, which has been associated with differences in population performance and behavioural traits. An earlier study at the northern distribution limit of the species reported differential temperature sensitivities of red blood cell oxygen (O-2) affinity between the northern cold-water Hbl-2 polymorph and its southern. warm-water Hbl-1 counter-part, which has since widely been held as adaptive for the species across its distributional range. The present study critically re-examined this hypothesis by comparing the thermal sensitivity of O-2 binding in both purified Hbl polymorphs from the southern, high-temperature distribution limit of the species under controlled conditions of allosteric modifiers of Hb function. Contrary to the prevailing view, the O-2 affinity of the major Hbl polymorphs did not differ from each other under any of the tested conditions. Depending on pH and ATP concentration, the temperature-sensitive and temperature-insensitive Hb-O-2 affinity phenotypes - previously exclusively ascribed to Hbl-1 and Hbl-2, respectively - could be induced in both Hbl polymorphs. These results are the first to establish a molecular mechanism behind a reversed temperature dependence of red blood cell O-2 affinity in a non-endotherm fish and lay the basis for future studies on alternative mechanisms behind the differences in distribution, performance and behavioural traits associated with the different Hbl polymorphs of Atlantic cod.",2019,10.1242/jeb.200279,222,12,NA,jeb200279,Allosteric interaction; Climate Change; Enthalpy; Oxygen affinity; P50; Phenotypic plasticity

Plastic responses can immediately buffer against environmental changes, although this buffering may impact the organism's ability to evolve in subsequent generations. While plasticity and evolution are not mutually exclusive, the relative contribution and interaction between them remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the roles of plastic and evolved responses of C. virginica acclimated to low salinity using a common garden experiment with four populations exposed to two salinities. We used three transcriptomic analyses (edgeR, PERMANOVA and WGCNA) combined with physiology data to identify the effect of genotype (population), environment (salinity) and the genotype-environment interaction on both whole-organism and molecular phenotypes. We demonstrate that variation in gene expression is mainly driven by population, with relatively small changes in response to salinity. In contrast, the morphology and physiology data reveal that salinity has a larger influence on oyster performance than the population of origin. All analyses lacked signatures of the genotypexenvironment interaction and, in contrast to previous studies, we found no evidence for population-specific responses to low salinity. However, individuals from the highest salinity estuary displayed highly divergent gene expression from that of other populations, which could potentially drive population-specific responses to other stressors. Our findings suggest that C. virginica largely rely on plasticity in physiology to buffer the effects of low salinity, but that these changes in physiology do not rely on large persistent changes in gene expression.",2023,10.1242/jeb.244315,226,14,NA,jeb244315,Transcriptomics; Plasticity; Evolution; Common; garden; Genotypexenvironment interaction
article,Feeding begets drinking: insights from intermittent feeding in snakes,"Lillywhite, Harvey B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"An important question related to the survival of dehydrating animals is whether feeding provides a net gain of water - contributing postprandial free water and metabolic water - or, alternatively, whether digestion and assimilation of ingested food incur a net loss of water because of requirements for digestion and the excretion of resulting metabolic wastes. Here, I address the question whether voluntary drinking increases or decreases following the ingestion of food. Increased postprandial drinking implies that food consumption increases rather than decreases the requirement for free water, whereas decreased postprandial drinking suggests there is a net profit of water from food. Snakes are ideally suited for such inquiry because they feed intermittently, and the temporal separation of meals allows relatively clear examination of the associated patterns of pre- and postprandial drinking. Voluntary drinking associated with meal consumption was quantified during consecutive feeding trials in four species representing two families of snakes. Postprandial relative to preprandial drinking increased in all four species, indicating that eating increases the physiological requirement for water. These data add to a growing literature pointing to some generality that eating can have negative rather than positive consequences for fluid homeostasis in some dehydrating animals.",2017,10.1242/jeb.163725,220,19,3565-3570,NA,Water; Postprandial drinking; Water balance; Fluid homeostasis; Dehydration; Digestion

Seeking to identify the consequences of evolution at low temperature, we examined hyperosmotic/hypo-osmotic and ionic regulation and gill ion transporter gene expression in two sub-Antarctic Eubrachyura from the Beagle Channel, Tierra del Fuego. Despite sharing the same osmotic niche, Acanthocyclus albatrossis tolerates a wider salinity range (2-65\%0 S) than Halicarcinus planatus (5-60\%0 S); their respective lower and upper critical salinities are 4\%0 and 12\%0 S, and 63\%0 and 50\%0 S. Acanthocyclus albatrossis is a weak hyperosmotic regulator, while H. planatus hyperosmoconforms; isosmotic points are 1380 and similar to 1340 mOsm kg-1 H2O, respectively. Both crabs hyper/hypo-regulate {[}Cl-] well with iso-chloride points at 452 and 316 mmol l-1 Cl-, respectively. {[}Na+] is hyper-regulated at all salinities. mRNA expression of gill Na{*}/K{*}-ATPase is salinity sensitive in A. albatrossis, increasing similar to 1.9-fold at 5\%0 compared with 30\%0 S, decreasing at 40-60\%0 S. Expression in H. planatus is very low salinity sensitive, increasing similar to 4.7-fold over 30\%0 S, but decreasing at 50\%0 S. V-ATPase expression decreases in A. albatrossis at low and high salinities as in H. planatus. Na{*}/K{*}/ 2Cl- symporter expression in A. albatrossis increases 2.6-fold at 5\%0 S, but decreases at 60\%0 S versus 30\%0 S. Chloride uptake may be mediated by increased Na{*}/K{*}/2Cl- expression but Cl- secretion is independent of symporter expression. These unrelated eubrachyurans exhibit similar systemic osmoregulatory characteristics and are better adapted to dilute media; however, the expression of genes underlying ion uptake and secretion shows marked interspecific divergence.

The light environments of these habitats differ: visible radiation (VIS) but not ultraviolet radiation (UV) reaches the undersurface of leaves, but neither enters dark hibernacula. Thus, mites of either seasonal form could locate their preferred habitat by photo-orientation responses to UV and VIS. To investigate this possibility, we analysed the mites' locomotion behaviour on a virtual field with a programmed chequered pattern of light and dark patches in a micro-locomotion compensator. Both non-diapausing and diapausing mites moved away from UV-illuminated patches into dark patches. Non-diapausing mites moved towards VIS-illuminated patches, whereas diapausing mites did not show a preference. Our results show that non-diapausing mites avoid UV and are attracted to VIS, suggesting that this can guide them beneath a leaf. Diapausing mites simply avoid UV. The lack of a preference for VIS during diapause could be due to changes in carotenoid metabolism, which also involve orange pigmentation of diapausing mites. We consider that a diapause-mediated switch of the response to VIS, together with regular avoidance of UV, plays a key role in the seasonal change of habitat selection in this species. This seasonal polyphenism involves alterations in not only reproductive state and pigmentation, but also in photo-spectral responses.",2013,10.1242/jeb.079582,216,6,977-983,NA,diapause; locomotion compensator; seasonal change; ultraviolet radiation; virtual field; visible radiation
article,Conspecific aggregations mitigate the effects of ocean acidification on calcification of the coral <i>Pocillopora verrucosa</i>,"Evensen, Nicolas R. and Edmunds, Peter J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In densely populated communities, such as coral reefs, organisms can modify the physical and chemical environment for neighbouring individuals. We tested the hypothesis that colony density (12 colonies each placed similar to 0.5 cm apart versus similar to 8 cm apart) can modulate the physiological response (measured through rates of calcification, photosynthesis and respiration in the light and dark) of the coral Pocillopora verrucosa to partial pressure of CO2 (P-CO2) treatments (similar to 400 mu atm and similar to 1200 mu atm) by altering the seawater flow regimes experienced by colonies placed in aggregations within a flume at a single flow speed. While light calcification decreased 20\% under elevated versus ambient P-CO2 for colonies in low-density aggregations, light calcification of high-density aggregations increased 23\% at elevated versus ambient P-CO2. As a result, densely aggregated corals maintained calcification rates over 24 h that were comparable to those maintained under ambient P-CO2, despite a 45\% decrease in dark calcification at elevated versus ambient P-CO2. Additionally, densely aggregated corals experienced reduced flow speeds and higher seawater retention times between colonies owing to the formation of eddies. These results support recent indications that neighbouring organisms, such as the conspecific coral colonies in the present example, can create small-scale refugia from the negative effects of ocean acidification.",2017,10.1242/jeb.152488,220,6,1097-1105,NA,High P-CO2; Coral growth; Facilitation; Species interactions; Hydrodynamics

Common products of mitochondrial activity are reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, which may cause oxidative stress by degrading key cell components, while playing essential roles in cell homeostasis. Given the delicate equilibrium between pro- and antioxidants in fueling acclimation responses, the need for a thorough understanding of the relationship between salinity-induced oxidative stress and osmoregulation arises as an important issue, especially in the context of global changes and anthropogenic impacts on coastal habitats. This is especially urgent for intertidal/estuarine organisms, which may be subject to drastic salinity and habitat changes, leading to redox imbalance. How do osmoregulation strategies determine energy expenditure, and how do these processes affect organisms in terms of oxidative stress? What mechanisms are used to cope with salinity-induced oxidative stress? This Commentary aims to highlight the main gaps in our knowledge, covering all levels of organization. From an energy-redox perspective, we discuss the link between environmental salinity changes and physiological responses at different levels of biological organization.

Environmental calcium levels ({[}Ca2+](e)) are pivotal in maintaining branchial junction integrity, with supplemental Ca2+ reversing the negative effects of low pH in some animals. Tolerance of some naturally acidic environments by aquatic animals is further complicated by low [}Ca2+](e), yet many of these environments are surprisingly biodiverse. How animals overcome the damaging actions of low pH and low environmental Ca2+ remains unknown. We examined the effects of [}Ca2+](e) on the response to low pH in larvae of the highly acid-tolerant frog Limnodynastes terraereginae. Acute exposure to low pH water in the presence of low (5 mu mol l(-1)) {[}Ca2+](e) increased net Na+ efflux. Provision of additional {[}Ca2+](e) reduced net Na+ efflux, but the effect was saturable. Acclimation to both low and high (250 mu mol l(-1)) {[}Ca2+](e) improved the resistance of larvae to Na+ efflux at low pH. Exposure to the Ca2+ channel inhibitor ruthenium red resulted in an abrupt loss of tolerance in low pH-acclimated larvae. Acclimation to acidic water increased branchial gene expression of the intracellular Ca2+ transport protein calbindin, consistent with a role for increased transcellular Ca2+ trafficking in the tolerance of acidic water.

It has been suggested that right-to-left (R-L) shunt (recirculation of systemic blood within the body) fuels the gastric mucosa with acidified and CO2-rich blood to facilitate gastric acid secretion during digestion. However, in addition to elevating P-CO2, R-L shunt also reduces arterial O-2 levels and would compromise O-2 delivery during the increased metabolic state of digestion. Conversely, arterial P-CO2 can also be elevated by lowering ventilation relative to metabolism (i.e. reducing the air convection requirement, ACR). Based on a mathematical analysis of the relative roles of ACR and R-L shunt on O-2 and CO2 levels, we predict that ventilatory modifications are much more effective for gastric CO2 supply with only modest effects on O-2 delivery. Conversely, elevating CO2 levels by means of R-L shunt would come at a cost of significant reductions in O-2 levels. The different effects of altering ACR and R-L shunt on O-2 and CO2 levels are explained by the differences in the effective blood capacitance coefficients.",2017,10.1242/jeb.149625,220,4,531-536,NA,Gas exchange; Heart; Mathematical model; Reptile; Shunting

article,Eco-immunology in the cold: the role of immunity in shaping the overwintering survival of ectotherms,"Ferguson, V, Laura and Kortet, Raine and Sinclair, Brent J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The effect of temperature on physiology mediates many of the challenges that ectotherms face under climate change. Ectotherm immunity is thermally sensitive and, as such, environmental change is likely to have complex effects on survival, disease resistance and transmission. The effects of temperature on immunity will be particularly profound in winter because cold and overwintering are important triggers and regulators of ectotherm immune activity. Low temperatures can both suppress and activate immune responses independent of parasites, which suggests that temperature not only affects the rate of immune responses but also provides information that allows overwintering ectotherms to balance investment in immunity and other physiological processes that underlie winter survival. Changing winter temperatures are now shifting ectotherm immunity, as well as the demand for energy conservation and protection against parasites. Whether an ectotherm can survive the winter will thus depend on whether new immune phenotypes will shift to match the conditions of the new environment, or leave ectotherms vulnerable to infection or energy depletion. Here, we synthesise patterns of overwintering immunity in ectotherms and examine how new winter conditions might affect ectotherm immunity. We then explore whether it is possible to predict the effects of changing winter conditions on ectotherm vulnerability to the direct and indirect effects of parasites.",2018,10.1242/jeb.163873,221,13,NA,163873,Winter; Climate change; Trade-offs; Immune system; Host-parasite interaction

While this aptitude is widely recognized, the role of `shunting' as a homeostatic mechanism to match convective transport with tissue demand remains unknown. In crocodilians, it has been hypothesized that a pulmonary vascular bypass of systemic venous blood - a right-to-left (R-L) shunt - serves to deliver CO2-rich blood with protons needed for gastric acid secretion during digestion. This hypothesis is partially based on the unique crocodilian vascular anatomy where a left aorta (LAo) arises from the right ventricle, and appears to preferentially supply the gastrointestinal system, whereas the right aorta emerges from the left ventricle. Recent theoretical considerations imply that a R-L shunt would have minuscule effects on P-CO2, but direct measurements of blood gases in both the right and left aortae or both the right and left atria in fed animals have not been conducted. For this reason, we measured blood parameters including P-O2, P-CO2, pH(e) and {[}HCO3-] in the right and left aortae and atria following ingestion of a gavage-fed standardizedmeal (5\% bodymass). Blood samples were taken at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h into the digestive period to encompass the period ofmaximal gastric acid secretion. At no point did P-CO2 or pH differ between the left and right aortae, whereas P-O2 was significantly lower in the left aorta at several time points during digestion.

We performed detailed comparisons of survivorship under varying salinities, using multiple strains of A. gambiae, A. coluzzii and A. merus, as well as F1 progeny from reciprocal crosses of A. merus and A. coluzzii. Additionally, using immunohistochemistry, we compared the location of three ion regulatory proteins (Na+/K+-ATPase, carbonic anhydrase and Na+/H+-antiporter) in the recta of A. coluzzii and A. merus reared in freshwater or saline water. As expected, we found that A. merus survives exposure to high salinities better than A. gambiae and A. coluzzii. Further, we found that exposure to a salinity level of 15.85. g NaCl l(-1) is a discriminating dose that kills all A. gambiae, A. coluzzii and A. coluzzii-A. merus F1 larvae, but does not negatively impact the survival of A. merus. Importantly, phenotypic expression of saltwater tolerance by A. merus is highly dependent upon the developmental time of exposure, and based on immunohistochemistry, salt tolerance appears to involve a major shift in Na+/K+-ATPase localization in the rectum, as observed previously for the distantly related saline-tolerant species A. albimanus.",2013,10.1242/jeb.087189,216,18,3433-3441,NA,Anopheles coluzzii; Anopheles gambiae; Anopheles merus; DAR cells; ion transport; malaria vector; mosquito; Na+/K+-ATPase; osmoregulation; salinity tolerance
article,Warmer and more acidic conditions enhance performance of an endemic low-shore gastropod,"Martin, Nicole and Robinson, Tamara B. and Clusella-Trullas, Susana",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Changing ocean temperatures are predicted to challenge marine organisms, especially when combined with other factors, such as ocean acidification. Acclimation, as a form of phenotypic plasticity, can moderate the consequences of changing environments for biota. Our understanding of how altered temperature and acidification together influence species' acclimation responses is, however, limited compared with that of responses to single stressors. This study investigated how temperature and acidification affect the thermal tolerance and righting speed of the girdled dogwhelk, Trochia cingulata. Whelks were acclimated for 2 weeks to combinations of three temperatures (11 \& DEG;C: cold, 13 \& DEG;C: moderate and 15 \& DEG;C: warm) and two pH regimes (8.0: moderate and 7.5: acidic). We measured the temperature sensitivity of the righting response by generating thermal performance curves from individual data collected at seven test temperatures and determined critical thermal minima (CTmin) and maxima (CTmax). We found that T. cingulata has a broad basal thermal tolerance range (-38 \& DEG;C) and after acclimation to the warm temperature regime, both the optimal temperature for maximum righting speed and CTmax increased. Contrary to predictions, acidification did not narrow this population's thermal tolerance but increased CTmax. These plastic responses are likely driven by the predictable exposure to temperature extremes measured in the field which originate from the local tidal cycle and the periodic acidification associated with ocean upwelling in the region. This acclimation ability suggests that T. cingulata has at least some capacity to buffer the thermal changes and increased acidification predicted to occur with climate change.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245423,226,11,NA,jeb245423,Marine gastropod; Thermal history; Climate warming; Seawater pH; Gaussian performance model; Critical thermal limits; Benguela upwelling region
article,Thirst and drinking in North American watersnakes (<i>Nerodia</i> spp.),"Edwards, Matthew and Sheehy, Coleman M. and Fedler, Matthew T. and Lillywhite, Harvey B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"We quantified drinking behavior in three species of North American watersnakes: Nerodia clarkii, which is a marine or brackish water amphibious species, and Nerodia fasciata and Nerodia taxispilota, both freshwater amphibious species. All three species have relatively small and similar thresholds of dehydration (TH, approximately -4\% loss of body mass) that elicit thirst and drinking of fresh water. These species have higher thirst sensitivity than several species of hydrophiine and laticaudine sea snakes, which are characterized by much lower TH ( greater dehydration, -9\% to <-20\%). Nerodia clarkii, which is often found in coastal oceanic water, refused to drink seawater, but drank fresh water when dehydrated. In separate trials involving dehydration of N. clarkii and N. fasciata that were concurrently fed fish at regular intervals, snakes eventually refused to eat at TH of approximately -12\% of original bodymass, but resumed eating after they were allowed to drink fresh water and rehydrate. The drinking behaviors of Nerodia corroborate previous data on the importance of fresh water for drinking, and they complement growing evidence that dietary water does not itself mitigate dehydration in snakes. These new data increase understanding of water relationships in the context of evolutionary transitions from land to sea, and they emphasize the importance of fresh water resources in the conservation of coastal and marine species of reptiles.",2021,10.1242/jeb.241414,224,5,NA,jeb241414,Dehydration; Snakes; Thirst sensitivity; Water; Water balance; Osmoregulation

C. and Griffith, Andrew W. and Li, Ning and Manahan, Donal T.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Understanding the mechanisms of biological responses to environmental change is a central theme in comparative and evolutionary physiology. Here, we analyzed variation in physiological responses to temperature, using 21 full-sibling larval families of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas. Pedigrees were confirmed with genetic markers for adult broodstock obtained from our breeding program. From these 21 larval families, 41 determinations of thermal sensitivity (Q(10) values) were assayed for larvae of different sizes. For respiration, thermal sensitivity was consistent within a larval family during growth, but showed significant differences among families. Different Q(10) values were evident among 21 larval families, with family accounting for 87\% of variation. Specifically, four larval families maintained an increased thermal sensitivity for respiration (Q(10) of 3). This physiology would confer resilience to rising temperature by matching the increased energy demand of protein synthesis (Q(10) of 3 previously reported). For protein synthesis, differences in Q(10) values were also observed. Notably, a family was identified that had a decreased thermal sensitivity for protein synthesis (Q(10) of 1.7 cf. Q(10) of 3 for other families), conferring an optimal energy allocation with rising temperature. Different thermal sensitivities across families for respiration (energy supply) and protein synthesis (energy demand) were integrated into models of energy allocation at the whole-organism level. The outcome of these analyses provides insights into the physiological bases of optimal energy allocation with rising temperature. These transgenerational (egg-to-egg) experiments highlight approaches to dissect components of phenotypic variance to address long-standing questions of genetic adaptation and physiological resilience to environmental change.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244518,225,22,NA,jeb244518,Biosynthesis; Development; Metabolism; Oyster; Temperature
article,Hyperoxia increases maximum oxygen consumption and aerobic scope of intertidal fish facing acutely high temperatures,"McArley, Tristan J. and Hickey, Anthony J. R. and Herbert, Neill A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Daytime low tides that lead to high-temperature events in stranded rock pools often co-occur with algae-mediated hyperoxia as a result of strong solar radiation. Recent evidence shows aerobic metabolic scope (MS) can be expanded under hyperoxia in fish but so far this possibility has not been examined in intertidal species despite being an ecologically relevant scenario. Furthermore, it is unknown whether hyperoxia increases the upper thermal tolerance limits of intertidal fish and, therefore, their ability to withstand extreme high-temperature events. Therefore, we measured the metabolic response (massspecific rate of oxygen consumption, (M) over dot(O2)) to thermal ramping (21-29 degrees C) and the upper thermal tolerance limit (U-TL) of two intertidal triplefin fishes (Bellapiscis medius and Forsterygion lapillum) under hyperoxia and normoxia. Hyperoxia increased maximal oxygen consumption ((M) over dot(O2,max)) and MS of each species at ambient temperature (21 degrees C) but also after thermal ramping to elevated temperatures such as those observed in rock pools (29 degrees C). While hyperoxia did not provide a biologically meaningful increase in upper thermal tolerance of either species (>31 degrees C under all conditions), the observed expansion of MS at 29 degrees C under hyperoxia could potentially benefit the aerobic performance, and hence the growth and feeding potential, etc., of intertidal fish at non-critical temperatures. That hyperoxia does not increase upper thermal tolerance in a meaningful way is cause for concern as climate change is expected to drive more extreme rock pool temperatures in the future and this could present a major challenge for these species.",2018,10.1242/jeb.189993,221,22,NA,jeb189993,Oxygen consumption; Respirometry; Thermal tolerance; Thermal ramping; Metabolism

Transgenerational plasticity may therefore depend on the environmental conditions experienced by each parent. We tested this hypothesis by conducting a fully factorial experiment across three generations of guppies (Poecilia reticulata), determining the effects of warm (28 \& DEG;C) and cold (21 \& DEG;C) thermal backgrounds of mothers and fathers on mass and length, and thermal performance (sustained and sprint swimming speeds, citrate synthase and lactate dehydrogenase activities; 18, 24, 28, 32 and 36 \& DEG;C test temperatures) of sons and daughters. Offspring sex was significant for all traits except for sprint speed. Warmer mothers produced sons and daughters with reduced mass and length, and warmer fathers produced shorter sons. Sustained swimming speed (Ucrit) of male offspring was greatest when both parents were raised at 28 \& DEG;C, and warmer fathers produced daughters with greater Ucrit. Similarly, warmer fathers produced sons and daughters with greater metabolic capacity. We show that the thermal variation experienced by parents can modify offspring phenotype, and that predicting the impacts of environmental change on populations would require knowledge of the thermal background of each mother and father, particularly where sexes are spatially segregated.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245798,226,12,NA,jeb245798,KEY WORDS; Parental effects; Thermal plasticity; Epigenetics; Performance curve; Metabolism; Locomotor performance; Climate; change

In this study, we determined the spectral corneal transmission properties of 38 species belonging to 13 non-salticid families. We used these data to estimate the T-50 transmission cut-off value, the wavelength corresponding to 50\% maximal transmission for each species. The corneas of almost all species from the families Deinopidae, Lycosidae, Oxyopidae, Pisauridae, Sparassidae and Thomisidae, all of which have been reported to rely to a substantial extent on vision, transmitted short wavelength light below 400 nm, ranging from 306 to 381 nm. However, species from the families Atypidae and Ctenizidae are not known to rely substantially on vision, and the corneas of these species tended to absorb light of wavelengths below 380 nm, which may not allow UV sensitivity in these spiders. Liphistiidae, the family widely regarded as most basal among spiders, is of particular interest. The species in this family are not known to make substantial use of vision, and yet we found that liphistiid corneas transmitted UV light with a low T-50 value (359 nm). T-50 values of non-salticid spider corneas also varied with light habitat. Species living in dim environments tended to have UV-opaque corneas, but species inhabiting open areas had UV-transmitting corneas. However, there was no evidence of corneal transmission properties being related to whether a species is diurnal or nocturnal.",2014,10.1242/jeb.099069,217,15,2698-2703,NA,Araneae; Ocular media; Sensory modality; Ultraviolet; Light habitat; Circadian rhythms
article,Evidence that Rh proteins in the anal papillae of the freshwater mosquito <i>Aedes aegypti </i>are involved in the regulation of acid-base balance in elevated salt and ammonia environments,"Durant, Andrea C. and Donini, Andrew",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Aedes aegypti commonly inhabit ammonia-rich sewage effluents in tropical regions of the world where the adults are responsible for the spread of disease. Studies have shown the importance of the anal papillae of A. aegypti in ion uptake and ammonia excretion. The anal papillae express ammonia transporters and Rhesus (Rh) proteins which are involved in ammonia excretion and studies have primarily focused on understanding these mechanisms in freshwater. In this study, effects of rearing larvae in salt (5 mmol l(-1) NaCl) or ammonia (5 mmol l(-1) NH4Cl) on physiological endpoints of ammonia and ion regulation were assessed. In anal papillae of NaCI-reared larvae, Rh protein expression increased. NHE3 transcript abundance decreased and NH(4)(+ )excretion increased, and this coincided with decreased hemolymph {[}NH4+] and pH. We propose that under these conditions. larvae excrete more NH(4)(+ )through Rh proteins as a means of eliminating acid from the hemolymph. In anal papillae of NH4Cl-reared larvae, expression of an apical ammonia transporter and the Rh proteins decreased, the activities of NKA and VA decreased and increased, respectively, and this coincided with hemolymph acidification. The results present evidence for a role of Rh proteins in acid-base balance in response to elevated levels of salt, whereby ammonia is excreted as an acid equivalent.",2018,10.1242/jeb.186866,221,23,NA,jeb186866,Ammonium transporter; Carbon dioxide; Disease vector; NHE; Rhesus glycoproteins; Sodium chloride
article,Heat dissipation capacity influences reproductive performance in an aerial insectivore,"Tapper, Simon and Nocera, Joseph J. and Burness, Gary",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Climatic warming is predicted to increase the frequency of extreme weather events, which may reduce an individual's capacity for sustained activity because of thermal limits. We tested whether the risk of overheating may limit parental provisioning of an aerial insectivorous bird in population decline. For many seasonally breeding birds, parents are thought to operate close to an energetic ceiling during the 2-3 week chick-rearing period. The factors determining the ceiling remain unknown, although it may be set by an individual's capacity to dissipate body heat (the heat dissipation limitation hypothesis). Over two breeding seasons we experimentally trimmed the ventral feathers of female tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) to provide a thermal window. We then monitored maternal and paternal provisioning rates, nestling growth rates and fledging success. We found the effect of our experimental treatment was context dependent. Females with an enhanced capacity to dissipate heat fed their nestlings at higher rates than controls when conditions were hot, but the reverse was true under cool conditions. Control females and their mates both reduced foraging under hot conditions. In contrast, male partners of trimmed females maintained a constant feeding rate across temperatures, suggesting attempts to match the feeding rate of their partners. On average, nestlings of trimmed females were heavier than controls, but did not have a higher probability of fledging. We suggest that removal of a thermal constraint allowed females to increase provisioning rates, but additionally provided nestlings with a thermal advantage via increased heat transfer during maternal brooding. Our data provide support for the heat dissipation limitation hypothesis and suggest that depending on temperature, heat dissipation capacity can influence reproductive success in aerial insectivores.",2020,10.1242/jeb.222232,223,10,NA,jeb222232,Energy expenditure; Thermal constraint; Parental care; Climate change; Activity

We measured thorax temperature, rates of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production, and abdominal pumping rates of bees randomly exposed to oxygen levels of 20, 15, 10 and 5 kPa at 26 degrees C. Under normoxia, bumblebees maintained an elevated mean thorax temperature of 35.5 degrees C. There was no significant change in thorax temperature at 15 kPa O-2 (33.4 degrees C). Mean thorax temperature decreased significantly at 10 kPa O-2 (31.6 degrees C) and 5 kPa O-2 (27.3 degrees C). Bees were able to maintain an elevated metabolic rate at 15 and 10 kPa O-2. In normoxia, endothermic bees exhibited periods of rapid abdominal pumping (327 min(-1)) interspaced by periods of no abdominal pumping. At 10 kPa O-2, abdominal pumping rate decreased (255 min(-1)) but became more continuous. Upon exposure to 5 kPa, metabolic rate and abdominal pumping rate (152 min(-1)) decreased, although the animals continued abdominal pumping at the reduced rate throughout the exposure period. Bumblebees are able to meet the energetic demands of endothermy at 15 kPa O-2, but become compromised at levels of 10 kPa O-2 and below.",2014,10.1242/jeb.107052,217,21,3834-3842,NA,Thermoregulation; Bombus terrestris; Hypoxia; Ventilation; Metabolism
article,Intraspecific variation in physiological performance of a benthic elasmobranch challenged by ocean acidification and warming,"Di Santo, Valentina",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Elucidating the combined effects of increasing temperature and ocean acidification on performance of fishes is central to our understanding of how species will respond to global climate change. Measuring the metabolic costs associated with intense and short activities, such as those required to escape predators, is key to quantifying changes in performance and estimating the potential effects of environmental stressors on survival. In this study, juvenile little skate Leucoraja erinacea from two neighboring locations (Gulf of Maine, or northern location, and Georges Bank, or southern location) were developmentally acclimatized and reared at current and projected temperatures (15, 18 or 20 degrees C) and acidification conditions (pH 8.1 or 7.7), and their escape performance was tested by employing a chasing protocol. The results from this study suggest countergradient variation in growth between skates from the two locations, while the optimum for escape performance was at a lower temperature in individuals from the northern latitudes, which could be related to adaptation to the local thermal environment. Aerobic performance and scope declined in skates from the northern latitudes under simulated ocean warming and acidification conditions. Overall, the southern skates showed lower sensitivity to these climatic stressors. This study demonstrates that even mobile organisms from neighboring locations can exhibit substantial differences in energetic costs of exercise and that skates from the northern part of the geographic range may be more sensitive to the directional increase in temperature and acidification expected by the end of the century.",2016,10.1242/jeb.139204,219,11,1725-1733,NA,Aerobic scope; Climate change; Escape response; Leucoraja erinacea; P-CO2; Thermal adaptation

Grant and Hargreaves, Anna L. and Love, Oliver P. and Vezina, Francois and Elliott, Kyle H.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The Arctic is warming at approximately twice the global rate, with well-documented indirect effects on wildlife. However, few studies have examined the direct effects of warming temperatures on Arctic wildlife, leaving the importance of heat stress unclear. Here, we assessed the direct effects of increasing air temperatures on the physiology of thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia), an Arctic seabird with reported mortalities due to heat stress while nesting on sun-exposed cliffs. We used flow-through respirometry to measure the response of body temperature, resting metabolic rate, evaporative water loss and evaporative cooling efficiency (the ratio of evaporative heat loss to metabolic heat production) in murres while experimentally increasing air temperature. Murres had limited heat tolerance, exhibiting: (1) a low maximum body temperature (43.3 degrees C); (2) a moderate increase in resting metabolic rate relative that within their thermoneutral zone (1.57 times); (3) a small increase in evaporative water loss rate relative that within their thermoneutral zone (1.26 times); and (4) a low maximum evaporative cooling efficiency (0.33). Moreover, evaporative cooling efficiency decreased with increasing air temperature, suggesting murres were producing heat at a faster rate than they were dissipating it. Larger murres also had a higher rate of increase in resting metabolic rate and a lower rate of increase in evaporative water loss than smaller murres; therefore, evaporative cooling efficiency declined with increasing body mass. As a cold-adapted bird, murres' limited heat tolerance likely explains their mortality on warm days.

article,When it's hot and dry: life-history strategy influences the effects of heat waves and water limitation,"Padda, Sugjit S. and Glass, Jordan R. and Stahlschmidt, Zachary R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The frequency, duration and co-occurrence of several environmental stressors, such as heat waves and droughts, are increasing globally. Such multiple stressors may have compounding or interactive effects on animals, resulting in either additive or non-additive costs, but animals may mitigate these costs through various strategies of resource conservation or shifts in resource allocation. Through a factorial experiment, we investigated the independent and interactive effects of a simulated heat wave and water limitation on life-history, physiological and behavioral traits. We used the variable field cricket, Gryllus lineaticeps, which exhibits a wing dimorphism that mediates two distinct life-history strategies during early adulthood. Long-winged individuals invest in flight musculature and are typically flight capable, whereas short-winged individuals lack flight musculature and capacity. A comprehensive and integrative approach with G. lineaticeps allowed us to examine whether life-history strategy influenced the costs of multiple stressors as well as the resulting cost-limiting strategies. Concurrent heat wave and water limitation resulted in largely non-additive and single-stressor costs to important traits (e.g. survival and water balance), extensive shifts in resource allocation priorities (e.g. reduced prioritization of body mass) and a limited capacity to conserve resources (e.g. heat wave reduced energy use only when water was available). Life-history strategy influenced the emergency life-history stage because wing morphology and stressor(s) interacted to influence body mass, boldness behavior and immunocompetence. Our results demonstrate that water availability and life-history strategy should be incorporated into future studies integrating important conceptual frameworks of stress across a suite of traits - from survival and life history to behavior and physiology.",2021,10.1242/jeb.236398,224,7,NA,jeb236398,Cricket; Flight; Immunocompetence; Metabolic rate; Multiple stressor; Wing dimorphism

Here, we discuss how functional genomics can be used in conservation biology to provide a cellular-level understanding of organismal responses to environmental conditions. In particular, the integration of transcriptomics with physiological and ecological research is increasingly playing an important role in identifying functional physiological thresholds predictive of compensatory responses and detrimental outcomes, transforming the way we can study issues in conservation biology. Notably, with technological advances in RNA sequencing, transcriptome-wide approaches can now be applied to species where no prior genomic sequence information is available to develop species-specific tools and investigate sublethal impacts that can contribute to population declines over generations and undermine prospects for long-term conservation success. Here, we examine the use of transcriptomics as a means of determining organismal responses to environmental stressors and use key study examples of conservation concern in fishes to highlight the added value of transcriptome-wide data to the identification of functional response pathways. Finally, we discuss the gaps between the core science and policy frameworks and how thresholds identified through transcriptomic evaluations provide evidence that can be more readily used by resource managers.",2018,10.1242/jeb.148833,221,2,NA,jeb148833,Conservation physiology; Endangered species; Molecular approaches
article,Body temperature stability achieved by the large body mass of sea turtles,"Sato, Katsufumi",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"To investigate the thermal characteristics of large reptiles living in water, temperature data were continuously recorded from 16 free-ranging loggerhead turtles, Caretta caretta, during internesting periods using data loggers. Core body temperatures were 0.7-1.7 degrees C higher than ambient water temperatures and were kept relatively constant. Unsteady numerical simulations using a spherical thermodynamic model provided mechanistic explanations for these phenomena, and the body temperature responses to fluctuating water temperature can be simply explained by a large body mass with a constant thermal diffusivity and a heat production rate rather than physiological thermoregulation. By contrast, body temperatures increased 2.6-5.1 degrees C in 107-152 min during their emergences to nest on land. The estimated heat production rates on land were 7.4-10.5 times the calculated values in the sea. The theoretical prediction that temperature difference between body and water temperatures would increase according to the body size was confirmed by empirical data recorded from several species of sea turtles. Comparing previously reported data, the internesting intervals of leatherback, green and loggerhead turtles were shorter when the body temperatures were higher. Sea turtles seem to benefit from a passive thermoregulatory strategy, which depends primarily on the physical attributes of their large body masses.",2014,10.1242/jeb.109470,217,20,3607-3614,NA,Data logger; Heat production rate; Thermal conductivity; Thermal diffusivity; Thermal inertia; Unsteady model
article,Thermoregulatory trade-offs underlie the effects of warming summer temperatures on deer mice,"Flewwelling, Luke D. and Wearing, Oliver H. and Garrett, Emily J. and Scott, Graham R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Climate warming could challenge the ability of endotherms to thermoregulate and maintain normal body temperature (Tb), but the effects of warming summer temperatures on activity and thermoregulatory physiology in many small mammals remain poorly understood. We examined this issue in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), an active nocturnal species. Mice were exposed in the lab to simulated seasonal warming, in which an environmentally realistic diel cycle of ambient temperature (Ta) was gradually warmed from spring conditions to summer conditions (controls were maintained in spring conditions). Activity (voluntary wheel running) and Tb (implanted bio-loggers) were measured throughout, and indices of thermoregulatory physiology (thermoneutral zone, thermogenic capacity) were assessed after exposure. In control mice, activity was almost entirely restricted to the night-time, and Tb fluctuated-1.7 degrees C between daytime lows and night-time highs. Activity, body mass and food consumption were reduced and water consumption was increased in later stages of summer warming. This was accompanied by strong Tb dysregulation that culminated in a complete reversal of the diel pattern of Tb variation, with Tb reaching extreme highs (-40 degrees C) during daytime heat but extreme lows (-34 degrees C) at cooler night-time temperatures. Summer warming was also associated with reduced ability to generate body heat, as reflected by decreased thermogenic capacity and decreased mass and uncoupling protein (UCP1) content of brown adipose tissue. Our findings suggest that thermoregulatory trade-offs associated with daytime heat exposure can affect Tb and activity at cooler night-time temperatures, impacting the ability of nocturnal mammals to perform behaviours important for fitness in the wild.",2023,10.1242/jeb.244852,226,5,NA,jeb244852,Climate change; Hyperthermia; Thermal plasticity; Thermoregulation; Metabolism

We exposed brown trout to normoxic and hypoxic water in the absence and presence of added ambient nitrite to decipher the cellular metabolism and effects of nitrite at basal and elevated concentrations under different oxygen regimes. We also tested hypotheses concerning the influence of nitrite on branchial nitric oxide synthase (NOS), Na+/K+-ATPase (nka) and heat shock protein (hsp70) mRNA expression. Basal plasma and erythrocyte nitrite levels were higher in hypoxia than normoxia, suggesting increased NOS activity. Nitrite exposure strongly elevated nitrite concentrations in plasma, erythrocytes, heart tissue and white muscle, which was associated with an extensive metabolism of nitrite to nitrate and to iron-nitrosylated and S-nitrosated compounds. Nitrite uptake was slightly higher in hypoxia than normoxia, and high internal nitrite levels extensively converted blood hemoglobin to methemoglobin and nitrosylhemoglobin. Hypoxia increased inducible NOS (iNOS) mRNA levels in the gills, which was overruled by a strong inhibition of iNOS expression by nitrite in both normoxia and hypoxia, suggesting negative-feedback regulation of iNOS gene expression by nitrite. A similar inhibition was absent for neuronal NOS. Branchial NKA activity stayed unchanged, but mRNA levels of the nka alpha 1a subunit increased with hypoxia and nitrite, which may have countered an initial NKA inhibition. Nitrite also increased hsp70 gene expression, probably contributing to the cytoprotective effects of nitrite at low concentrations.

article,Desiccation resistance reflects patterns of microhabitat choice in a Central American assemblage of wandering spiders,"Lapinski, Witold and Tschapka, Marco",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The lowland rainforest of northeastern Costa Rica harbours an assemblage of large wandering spider species belonging to three habitat subguilds: (1) semi-aquatic, (2) forest ground dwelling and (3) vegetation dwelling. We hypothesized that desiccation resistance should differ among species preferring different microhabitats and the associated microclimate. Desiccation resistance was assessed by: (1) measuring water loss rates of the spiders under relatively dry experimental conditions, and (2) recording desiccation susceptibility, i.e. the reactions of the spiders to a relatively dry environment. High water loss rates and desiccation susceptibility of the semi-aquatic and forest-ground-dwelling subguilds clearly mirrored the relatively humid microclimate of the understory. Significantly lower water loss rates and desiccation susceptibility of the vegetation-dwelling species reflected the highly variable, often dry and hot conditions of the rainforest canopy and forest edge habitats.

Mangrove rivulus fish inhabit mangrove ecosystems where salinities range from 0 to 65 ppt, but are most often collected from areas with salinities of similar to 25 ppt. We examined the salinity preference of mangrove rivulus in a lateral salinity gradient, in the absence of predators and competitors. Fish could swim freely for 8 h throughout the gradient with chambers containing salinities ranging from 5 to 45 ppt (or 25 ppt throughout in the control). We defined preference as the salinity in which the fish spent most of their time, and also measured preference strength, latency to begin exploring the arena, and number of transitions between chambers. To determine whether these traits were repeatable, each fish experienced three trials. Mangrove rivulus spent a greater proportion of time in salinities lower (5-15 ppt) than they occupy in the wild. Significant among-individual variation in the (multivariate) behavioral phenotype emerged when animals experienced the gradient, indicating strong potential for selection to drive behavioral evolution in areas with diverse salinity microhabitats. We also showed that mangrove rivulus had a significantly greater probability of laying eggs in low salinities compared with control or high salinities. Eggs laid in lower salinities also had higher hatching success compared with those laid in higher salinities. Thus, although mangrove rivulus can tolerate a wide range of salinities, they prefer low salinities. These results raise questions about factors that prevent mangrove rivulus from occupying lower salinities in the wild, whether higher salinities impose energetic costs, and whether fitness changes as a function of salinity.",2020,10.1242/jeb.219196,223,5,NA,jeb219196,Fitness; Rivulidae; Killifish

Effect of exposing the mother, but not her pups, to a cold environment during lactation in mice","Valencak, Teresa G. and Wright, Paul and Weir, Ashleigh and Mitchell, Sharon E. and Vaanholt, Lobke M. and Hambly, Catherine and Krol, Elzbieta and Speakman, John R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The capacity of females to dissipate heat may constrain sustained energy intake during lactation. However, some previous experiments supporting this concept have confounded the impact of temperature on the mothers with the impact on the pups. We aimed to separate these effects in lactating laboratory mice (MF1 strain) by giving the mothers access to cages at two ambient temperatures (10 and 21 degrees C) joined by a tube. Food was available only in the cold cage, but females could also choose go to this cage to cool down while their pups were housed in the warmer cage. Control animals had access to the same configuration of cages but with both maintained at 21 degrees C. We hypothesised that if females were limited by heat dissipation, alleviating the heat load by providing a cool environment would allow them to dissipate more heat, take in more food, generate more milk and hence wean heavier litters. We measured maternal energy budgets and monitored time courses of core body temperature and physical activity. To minimise the variance in energy budgets, all litters were adjusted to 12 (+/-1) pups. Females in the experimental group had higher energy intake (F-1,F-14=15.8, P=0.0014) and higher assimilated energy (F-1,F-13=10.7, P=0.006), and provided their pups with more milk (F-1,F-13=6.65, P=0.03), consistent with the heat dissipation limit theory. Yet, despite keeping demand constant, mean pup growth rates were similar (F-1,F-13=0.06, P=0.8); thus, our data emphasise the difficulties of inferring milk production indirectly from pup growth.",2013,10.1242/jeb.092023,216,23,4326-4333,NA,physiological limitation; choice; thermal conditions; heat dissipation limitation; MF1; body temperature; activity
article,Comparative physiology reveals heat stress disrupts acid-base homeostasis independent of symbiotic state in the model cnidarian Exaiptasia diaphana,"-Waller, Luella R. Allen and Jones, Katelyn G. and Martynek, Marcelina P. and Brown, Kristen T. and Barott, Katie L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Climate change threatens the survival of symbiotic cnidarians by causing photosymbiosis breakdown in a process known as bleaching. Direct effects of temperature on cnidarian host physiology remain difficult to describe because heatwaves depress symbiont performance, leading to host stress and starvation. The symbiotic sea anemone Exaiptasia diaphana provides an opportune system to disentangle direct versus indirect heat effects on the host, as it can survive indefinitely without symbionts. We tested the hypothesis that heat directly impairs cnidarian physiology by comparing symbiotic and aposymbiotic individuals of two laboratory subpopulations of a commonly used clonal strain of E. diaphana, CC7. We exposed anemones to a range of temperatures (ambient, +2 degrees C, +4 degrees C and +6 degrees C) for 15-18 days, then measured their symbiont population densities, autotrophic carbon assimilation and translocation, photosynthesis, respiration and host intracellular pH (pHi). Symbiotic anemones from the two subpopulations differed in size and symbiont density and exhibited distinct heat stress responses, highlighting the importance of acclimation to different laboratory conditions. Specifically, the cohort with higher initial symbiont densities experienced dose-dependent symbiont loss with increasing temperature and a corresponding decline in host photosynthate accumulation. In contrast, the cohort with lower initial symbiont densities did not lose symbionts or assimilate less photosynthate when heated, similar to the response of aposymbiotic anemones. However, anemone pHi decreased at higher temperatures regardless of cohort, symbiont presence or photosynthate translocation, indicating that heat consistently disrupts cnidarian acid-base homeostasis independent of symbiotic status or mutualism breakdown. Thus, pH regulation may be a critical vulnerability for cnidarians in a changing climate.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246222,227,4,NA,jeb246222,KEY WORDS; Intracellular pH; Thermal stress; Aiptasia; Symbiosis; Climate change; Symbiodiniaceae
article,Blood as fuel: the metabolic cost of pedestrian locomotion in <i>Rhodnius prolixus</i>,"Leis, Miguel and Lazzari, Claudio R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Active searching for vertebrate blood is a necessary activity for haematophagous insects, and it can be assumed that this search should also be costly in terms of energetic expenditure. Whether by swimming, walking, running or flying, active movement requires energy, increasing metabolic rate relative to resting situations. We analysed the respiratory pattern and energetic cost of pedestrian locomotion in the blood-sucking bug Rhodnius prolixus using flow-through respirometry, by measuring carbon dioxide emission and water loss before, during and after walking. We observed an increase in the metabolic rate during walking as compared with resting of up to 1.7-fold in male R. prolixus and 1.5-fold in females, as well as a change in their respiratory pattern, which switched from cyclic during rest to continuous when the insects started to walk, remaining in this condition during locomotion and for several minutes after stopping. Walking induced a significant loss of mass in both males and females. This can be explained by an increase in both metabolic rate and water loss during walking. These data constitute the first metabolic measures of active haematophagous insects and provide the first insights into the energetic expenditure associated with the active search for blood in this group.",2021,10.1242/jeb.227264,224,1,NA,jeb227264,Respiration; Activity; Metabolic rate; Disease vectors; Chagas

Although noctumality buffers desert-dwelling owls from significant heat stress during activity, roost sites in tree and cactus cavities or in deep shade provide only limited refuge from high environmental temperatures during the day. We measured thermoregulatory responses to acute heat stress in two species of small owls, the elf owl (Micrathene whiffler) and the western screechowl (Megascops kennicottii), which occupy the Sonoran Desert of southwestern North America, an area of extreme heat and aridity. We exposed wild-caught birds to progressively increasing air temperatures (T-a) and measured resting metabolic rate (RMR), evaporative water loss (EWL), body temperature (T-b) and heat tolerance limits (HTL; the maximum T-a reached). Comparatively low RMR values were observed in both species, T-b approximated T-a at 40 degrees C and mild hyperthermia occurred as T-a was increased toward the HTL. Elf owls and screechowls reached HTLs of 48 and 52 degrees C, respectively, and RMR increased to 1.5 and 1.9 times thermoneutral values. Rates of EWL at the HTL allowed for the dissipation of 167-198\% of metabolic heat production (MHP). Gular flutter was used as the primary means of evaporative heat dissipation and produced large increases in evaporative heat loss (44-100\%), accompanied by only small increases (<5\%) in RMR.

article,Exposure to seawater increases intestinal motility in euryhaline rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss)</i>,"Brijs, Jeroen and Hennig, Grant W. and Grans, Albin and Dekens, Esmee and Axelsson, Michael and Olsson, Catharina",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Upon exposure to seawater, euryhaline teleosts need to imbibe and desalinate seawater to allow for intestinal ion and water absorption, as this is essential for maintaining osmotic homeostasis. Despite the potential benefits of increased mixing and transport of imbibed water for increasing the efficiency of absorptive processes, the effect of water salinity on intestinal motility in teleosts remains unexplored. By qualitatively and quantitatively describing in vivo intestinal motility of euryhaline rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), this study demonstrates that, in freshwater, the most common motility pattern consisted of clusters of rhythmic, posteriorly propagating contractions that lasted similar to 1-2 min followed by a period of quiescence lasting similar to 45 min. This pattern closely resembles mammalian migrating motor complexes (MMCs). Following a transition to seawater, imbibed seawater resulted in a significant distension of the intestine and the frequency of MMCs increased twofold to threefold with a concomitant reduction in the periods of quiescence. The increased frequency of MMCs was also accompanied by ripple-type contractions occurring every 12-60 s. These findings demonstrate that intestinal contractile activity of euryhaline teleosts is dramatically increased upon exposure to seawater, which is likely part of the overall response for maintaining osmotic homeostasis as increased drinking and mechanical perturbation of fluids is necessary to optimise intestinal ion and water absorption. Finally, the temporal response of intestinal motility in rainbow trout transitioning from freshwater to seawater coincides with previously documented physiological modifications associated with osmoregulation and may provide further insight into the underlying reasons shaping the migration patterns of salmonids.",2017,10.1242/jeb.156000,220,13,2397-2408,NA,Fish; Osmoregulation; Enteric electrical activity; Spatio-temporal maps; Video recordings; Salinity
article,"Comparative physiological, biochemical and molecular thermal stress response profiles for two unionid freshwater mussel species","Payton, Samantha L. and Johnson, Paul D. and Jenny, Matthew J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Freshwater mussels, aquatic keystone species, are in global decline. Long life spans, sedentary lifestyles, and unique reproductive strategies involving obligate parasitic stages make unionid freshwater mussels particularly sensitive to environmental perturbations resulting from global climate change. A greater understanding of the mechanisms by which closely related species differ in their response to thermal challenge is critical for successful conservation and management practices. As such, both an acute heat shock and a chronic warming simulation were conducted in order to evaluate responses between hypothesized thermally tolerant (Villosa lienosa) and thermally sensitive (Villosa nebulosa) freshwater mussels in response to predicted thermal warming. Multiple biological responses were quantified, including mortality, condition index, growth rates, glycogen and triglyceride content, and candidate gene expression. During acute heat shock, both species upregulated HSP90 and HSP70, although V. lienosa showed consistently greater transcript levels during upregulation. This pattern was consistent during the chronic warming simulation, with V. nebulosa showing greater induction of HSP60. Chronic warming stimulated increases in condition index for V. nebulosa; however, declines in growth rates during a recovery period were observed with no concurrent change in tissue glycogen levels. This contrasts with V. lienosa, where tissue glycogen significantly increased during chronic warming, although no response was observed for condition index or growth rates. These biological differences might indicate disparate thermal stress response mechanisms correlated with metabolic demands and resource utilization, and could thus be a factor influencing current ranges of these two species and their ability to cope with future persistent warming in their native habitats.",2016,10.1242/jeb.140129,219,22,3562-3574,NA,Global warming; Growth; Thermal tolerance; Villosa; Heat shock protein; Condition index; Glycogen; Triglycerides; Chronic heat shock
article,Thermoregulatory consequences of salt loading in the lizard <i>Pogona vitticeps</i>,"Scarpellini, Carolina da Silveira and Bicego, Kenia C. and Tattersall, Glenn J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Previous research has demonstrated that dehydration increases the threshold temperature for panting and decreases the thermal preference of lizards. Conversely, it is unknown whether thermoregulatory responses such as shuttling and gaping are similarly influenced. Shuttling, as an active behavioural response, is considered one of the most effective thermoregulatory behaviours, whereas gaping has been proposed to be involved in preventing brain over-heating in lizards. In this study we examined the effect of salt loading, a proxy for increased plasma osmolality, on shuttling and gaping in Pogona vitticeps. Then, we determined the upper and lower escape ambient temperatures (UETa and LETa), the percentage of time spent gaping, the metabolic rate ((V) over dot(O2)), the evaporative water loss (EWL) during gaping and non-gaping intervals and the evaporative effectiveness (EWL/(V) over dot(O2)) of gaping. All experiments were performed under isotonic (154 mmol l(-1)) and hypertonic saline injections (625, 1250 or 2500 mmol l(-1)). Only the highest concentration of hypertonic saline altered the UETa and LETa, but this effect appeared to be the result of diminishing the animal's propensity to move, instead of any direct reduction in thermoregulatory set-points. Nevertheless, the percentage of time spent gaping was proportionally reduced according to the saline concentration; (V) over dot(O2) was also decreased after salt loading. Thermographic images revealed lower head than body surface temperatures during gaping; however this difference was inhibited after salt loading. Our data suggest that EWL/(V) over dot(O2) is raised during gaping, possibly contributing to an increase in heat transfer away from the lizard, and playing a role in head or brain cooling.",2015,10.1242/jeb.116723,218,8,1166-1174,NA,Gaping; Shuttling; Metabolic rate; Evaporative water loss; Brain cooling

Here we studied the effect of two cold spells (January 1985 and February 2012) on the energetics of greater flamingos (Phoenicopterus roseus) in the Camargue (southern France). To understand the cause of observed flamingo mass mortalities, we first assessed the energy stores of flamingos found dead in February 2012, and compared them with those found in other bird species exposed to cold spells and/or fasting. Second, we evaluated the monthly energy requirements of flamingos across 1980-2012 using the mechanistic model Niche Mapper (TM). Our results show that the body lipids of flamingos found dead in 2012 corresponded to 2.6 +/- 0.3\% of total body mass, which is close to results found in woodcocks (Scolopax rusticola) that died from starvation during a cold spell (1.7 +/- 0.1\%), and much lower than in woodcocks which were fed throughout this same cold spell (13.0 +/- 2\%). Further, Niche Mapper (TM) predicted that flamingo energy requirements were highest (+6-7\%) during the 1985 and 2012 cold spells compared with `normal' winters. This increase was primarily driven by cold air temperatures. Overall, our findings strongly suggest that flamingos starved to death during both cold spells. This study demonstrates the relevance of using mechanistic energetics modelling and body condition analyses to understand and predict the impact of extreme climatic events on animal energy balance and winter survival probabilities.",2014,10.1242/jeb.106344,217,20,3700-3707,NA,Bioenergetics; Energy requirements; Energy stores; Fasting; Body condition; Niche Mapper (TM); Mechanistic modelling; Winter stress
article,Developmental thermal plasticity of prey modifies the impact of predation,"Seebacher, Frank and Grigaltchik, Veronica S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Environmental conditions during embryonic development can influence the mean expression of phenotypes as well as phenotypic responses to environmental change later in life. The resulting phenotypes may be better matched to their environment and more resilient to environmental change, including human-induced climate change. However, whether plasticity does improve success in an ecological context is unresolved. In a microcosm experiment, we show that developmental plasticity in embryos of the frog Limnodynastes peronii is beneficial by increasing survivorship of tadpoles in the presence of predators when egg incubation (15 or 25 degrees C) and tadpole acclimation temperature inmicrocosms(15 or 25 degrees C) coincided at 15 degrees C. Tadpoles that survived predation were smaller, and had faster burst swimming speeds than those kept in no-predator control conditions, but only at high (25 degrees C) egg incubation or subsequent microcosm temperatures. Metabolic rates were determined by a three-way interaction between incubation and microcosm temperatures and predation; maximal glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolic capacities (enzyme activities) were lower in survivors from predation compared with controls, particularly when eggs were incubated at 25 degrees C. We show that thermal conditions experienced during early development are ecologically relevant by modulating survivorship from predation. Importantly, developmental thermal plasticity also impacts population phenotypes indirectly by modifying species interactions and the selection pressure imposed by predation.",2015,10.1242/jeb.116558,218,9,1402-1409,NA,Acclimation; Climate change; Fish; Locomotor performance; Species interactions; Survivorship; Tadpoles
article,Drivers of plasticity n freeze tolerance in the intertidal mussel <i>Mytilus trossulus</i>,"Kennedy, Jessica R. and Harley, Christopher D. G. and Marshall, Katie E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Freezing is an extreme stress to living cells, and so freeze-tolerant animals often accumulate protective molecules (termed cryoprotectants) to prevent the cellular damage caused by freezing. The bay mussel, Mytilus trossulus, is an ecologically important intertidal invertebrate that can survive freezing. Although much is known about the biochemical correlates of freeze tolerance in insects and vertebrates, the cryoprotectants that are used by intertidal invertebrates are not well characterized. Previous work has proposed two possible groups of low-molecular weight cryoprotectants in intertidal invertebrates: osmolytes and anaerobic byproducts. In our study, we examined which group of candidate cryoprotectants correlate with plasticity in freeze tolerance in mussels using H-1 NMR metabolomics. We found that the freeze tolerance of M. trossulus varies on a seasonal basis, along an intertidal shore-level gradient, and with changing salinity. Acclimation to increased salinity (30 ppt compared with 15 ppt) increased freeze tolerance, and mussels were significantly more freeze tolerant during the winter. Mussel freeze tolerance also increased with increasing shore level. There was limited evidence that anaerobic byproduct accumulation was associated with increased freeze tolerance. However, osmolyte accumulation was correlated with increased freeze tolerance after high salinity acclimation and in the winter. The concentration of most low molecular weight metabolites did not vary with shore level, indicating that another mechanism is likely responsible for this pattern of variation in freeze tolerance. By identifying osmolytes as a group of molecules that assist in freezing tolerance, we have expanded the known biochemical repertoire of the mechanisms of freeze tolerance.",2020,10.1242/jeb.233478,223,24,NA,jeb233478,Cryoinjury; Salinity; Cryoprotectant; Plasticity; Osmolyte; Anaerobic by-product

Invasive species are often expected to have broad thermal tolerance, be highly plastic, or have high adaptive potential when faced with novel environments. Tropical island ectotherms are expected to be vulnerable to climate change as they often have narrow thermal tolerance and limited plasticity. In Fiji, only one species of endemic bee, Homalictus fijiensis, is commonly found in the lowland regions, but two invasive bee species, Braunsapis puangensis and Ceratina dentipes, have recently been introduced into Fiji. These introduced species pollinate invasive plants and might compete with H. fijiensis and other native pollinators for resources. To test whether certain performance traits promote invasiveness of some species, and to determine which species are the most vulnerable to climate change, we compared the thermal tolerance, desiccation resistance, metabolic rate and seasonal performance adjustments of endemic and invasive bees in Fiji. The two invasive species tended to be more resistant to thermal and desiccation stress than H. fijiensis, while H. fijiensis had greater capacity to adjust their CTmax with season, and H. fijiensis females tended to have higher metabolic rates than B. puangensis females. These findings provide mixed support for current hypotheses for the functional basis of the success of invasive species; however, we expect the invasive bees in Fiji to be more resilient to climate change because of their increased thermal tolerance and desiccation resistance.",2021,10.1242/jeb.230326,224,1,NA,jeb230326,Desiccation resistance; Global warming; Native bees; Plasticity; Pollinators; Thermal tolerance

Teleost possess two enzyme forms, AANAT1 and AANAT2, preferentially expressed in the retina and the pineal gland, respectively. The concomitant action of light and temperature shapes the daily and seasonal changes in melatonin secretion: the former controls duration while the latter modulates amplitude. Investigating the respective roles of light and temperature is particularly relevant in the context of global warming, which is likely to affect the way fish decode and anticipate seasonal changes, with dramatic consequences on their physiology and behavior. Here we investigated the impact of temperature on pineal melatonin secretion of a migratory species, the Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus), the northernmost living and cold-adapted salmonid. We show that temperature directly impacts melatonin production in cultured pineal glands.

We determined maximum rates of evaporative heat dissipation and thermal end points (T-b and T-a associated with thermoregulatory failure) in three southern African ploceid passerines, the scaly-feathered weaver (Sporopipes squamifrons, M-b approximate to 10 g), sociable weaver (Philetairus socius, M-b approximate to 25 g) and white-browed sparrow-weaver (Plocepasser mahali, M-b approximate to 40 g). Birds were exposed to a ramped profile of progressively increasing T-a, with continuous monitoring of behaviour and T-b used to identify the onset of severe hyperthermia. The maximum T-a birds tolerated ranged from 48 degrees C to 54 degrees C, and was positively related to M-b. Values of T-b associated with severe heat stress were in the range of 44 to 45 degrees C. Rates of evaporative water loss (EWL) increased rapidly when T-a exceeded T-b, and maximum evaporative heat dissipation was equivalent to 141-222\% of metabolic heat production.

Crabs were exposed to one of three pH levels - 8.1, 7.8 or 7.5 -for 2 years. Reduced pH led to a suite of body region-specific effects on the exoskeleton. Microhardness of the claw was 38\% lower in crabs at pH 7.5 compared with those at pH 8.1, but carapace microhardness was unaffected by pH. In contrast, reduced pH altered elemental content in the carapace (reduced calcium, increased magnesium), but not the claw. Diminished structural integrity and thinning of the exoskeleton were observed at reduced pH in both body regions; internal erosion of the carapace was present in most crabs at pH 7.5, and the claws of these crabs showed substantial external erosion, with tooth-like denticles nearly or completely worn away. Using infrared spectroscopy, we observed a shift in the phase of calcium carbonate present in the carapace of pH 7.5 crabs: a mix of ACC and calcite was found in the carapace of crabs at pH 8.1, whereas the bulk of calcium carbonate had transformed to calcite in pH 7.5 crabs.

article,Seasonal and geographical variation in heat tolerance and evaporative cooling capacity in a passerine bird,"Noakes, Matthew J. and Wolf, Blair O. and McKechnie, Andrew E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Intraspecific variation in avian thermoregulatory responses to heat stress has received little attention, despite increasing evidence that endothermic animals show considerable physiological variation among populations. We investigated seasonal (summer versus winter) variation in heat tolerance and evaporative cooling in an Afrotropical ploceid passerine, the white-browed sparrow-weaver (Plocepasser mahali; similar to 47 g) at three sites along a climatic gradient with more than 10 degrees C variation in mid-summer maximum air temperature (T-a). We measured resting metabolic rate (RMR) and total evaporative water loss (TEWL) using open flow-through respirometry, and core body temperature (T-b) using passive integrated transponder tags. Sparrow-weavers were exposed to a ramped profile of progressively higher T-a between 30 and 52 degrees C to elicit maximum evaporative cooling capacity (N=10 per site per season); the maximum T-a birds tolerated before the onset of severe hyperthermia (T-b approximate to 44 degrees C) was considered to be their hyperthermia threshold T-a (T-a, HT). Our data reveal significant seasonal acclimatisation of heat tolerance, with a desert population of sparrow-weavers reaching significantly higher T-a in summer (49.5 +/- 1.4 degrees C, i.e. higher T-a, HT) than in winter (46.8 +/- 0.9 degrees C), reflecting enhanced evaporative cooling during summer. Moreover, desert sparrow-weavers had significantly higher heat tolerance and evaporative cooling capacity during summer compared with populations from more mesic sites (T-a, HT=47.3 +/- 1.5 and 47.6 +/- 1.3 degrees C). A better understanding of the contributions of local adaptation versus phenotypic plasticity to intraspecific variation in avian heat tolerance and evaporative cooling capacity is needed for modelling species' responses to changing climates.",2016,10.1242/jeb.132001,219,6,859-869,NA,Acclimatisation; Heat stress; Hyperthermia; Evaporative water loss; Arid-zone birds
article,Respiratory gas levels interact to control ventilatory motor patterns in isolated locust ganglia,"Talal, Stav and Ayali, Amir and Gefen, Eran",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Large insects actively ventilate their tracheal system even at rest, using abdominal pumping movements, which are controlled by a central pattern generator (CPG) in the thoracic ganglia. We studied the effects of respiratory gases on the ventilatory rhythm by isolating the thoracic ganglia and perfusing its main tracheae with various respiratory gas mixtures. Fictive ventilation activity was recorded from motor nerves controlling spiracular and abdominal ventilatory muscles. Both hypoxia and hypercapnia increased the ventilation rate, with the latter being much more potent. Sub-threshold hypoxic and hypercapnic levels were still able to modulate the rhythm as a result of interactions between the effects of the two respiratory gases. Additionally, changing the oxygen levels in the bathing saline affected ventilation rate, suggesting a modulatory role for haemolymph oxygen. Central sensing of both respiratory gases as well as interactions of their effects on the motor output of the ventilatory CPG reported here indicate convergent evolution of respiratory control among terrestrial animals of distant taxa.",2019,10.1242/jeb.195388,222,8,NA,jeb195388,Central pattern generator; Thoracic ganglia; Ventilation; Hypoxia; Hypercapnia; Tracheal system
article,Temperature during embryonic development has persistent effects on metabolic enzymes in the muscle of zebrafish,"Schnurr, Meghan E. and Yin, Yi and Scott, Graham R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Global warming is intensifying interest in the physiological consequences of temperature change in ectotherms, but we still have a relatively poor understanding of the effects of temperature on early life stages. This study determined how embryonic temperature (T-E) affects development and the activity of metabolic enzymes in the swimming muscle of zebrafish. Embryos developed successfully to hatching (survival >= 88\%) from 22 to 32 degrees C, but suffered sharp increases in mortality outside of this range. Embryos that were incubated until hatching at a control TE (27 C) or near the extremes for successful development (22 or 32 C) were next raised to adulthood under control conditions at 27 C. Growth trajectories after hatching were altered in the 22 C and 32 C TE groups compared with 27 C TE controls, but growth slowed after 3 months of age in all groups. Maximal enzyme activities of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), citrate synthase (CS), hydroxyacyl-coA dehydrogenase (HOAD), pyruvate kinase (PK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were measured across a range of assay temperatures (22, 27, 32 and 36 C) in adults from each TE group that were acclimated to 27 or 32 C. Substrate affinities (Km) were also determined for COX and LDH. In adult fish acclimated to 27 C, COX and PK activities were higher in 22 C and 32 C TE groups than in 27 C TE controls, and the temperature optimum for COX activity was higher in the 32 C TE group than in the 22 C TE group. Warm acclimation reduced COX, CS and/or PK activities in the 22 and 32 C TE groups, possibly to compensate for thermal effects on molecular activity. This response did not occur in the 27 C TE controls, which instead increased LDH and HOAD activities. Warm acclimation also increased thermal sensitivity (Q(10)) of HOAD to cool temperatures across all TE groups. We conclude that the temperature experienced during early development can have a persistent impact on energy metabolism pathways and acclimation capacity in later life.",2014,10.1242/jeb.094037,217,8,1370-1380,NA,Developmental plasticity; Phenotypic plasticity; Thermal performance curve; Acclimatization; Muscle phenotype

Preparations were made from animals that were euthanized after 1-2. weeks of fasting, or at 24-48. h after voluntary feeding on a 3\% ration of teleost fish (hake). Sacs were incubated under initially symmetrical conditions with dogfish saline on both surfaces. In comparison to an earlier in vivo study, the results confirmed that feeding caused increases in H+ secretion in both stomach sections, but an increase in Cl(-)secretion only in stomach 2. Na+ absorption, rather than Na+ secretion, occurred in both stomach sections after feeding. All sections of the tract absorbed water and the intestine strongly absorbed Na+ and Cl-, regardless of feeding condition. The results also confirmed that feeding increased water absorption in the intestine (but not in the colon), and had little influence on the handling of Ca2+ and Mg2+, which exhibited negligible absorption across the tract. However, K+ was secreted in the intestine in both fasted and fed preparations. Increased intestinal water absorption occurred despite net osmolyte secretion into the mucosal saline. The largest changes occurred in urea and CO2/ HCO3- fluxes. In fasted preparations, urea was absorbed at a low rate in all sections except the intestine, where it was secreted. Instead of an increase in intestinal urea secretion predicted from in vivo data, feeding caused a marked switch to net urea absorption. This intestinal urea transport occurred at a rate comparable to urea reabsorption rates reported at gills and kidney, and was apparently active, establishing a large serosal-to-mucosal concentration gradient. Feeding also greatly increased intestinal CO2/HCO3- secretion; if interpreted as HCO3 transport, the rates were in the upper range of those reported in marine teleosts. Phloretin (0.25. mmol.l(-1), applied mucosally) completely blocked the increases in intestinal urea absorption and CO2/HCO3- secretion caused by feeding, but had no effect on Na+, Cl(-)or water absorption.",2013,10.1242/jeb.082313,216,11,2063-2072,NA,cardiac stomach; pyloric stomach; intestine; spiral valve; colon; gut sac
article,Why do models of insect respiratory patterns fail?,"Terblanche, John S. and Woods, H. Arthur",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Insects exchange respiratory gases using an astonishing diversity of patterns. Of these, discontinuous gas exchange cycles (DGCs) have received the most study, but there are many other patterns exhibited intraspecifically and interspecrfically. Moreover, some individual insects transition between patterns based on poorly understood combinations of internal and external factors. Why have biologists failed, so far, to develop a framework capable of explaining this diversity? Here, we propose two answers. The first is that the framework will have to be simultaneously general and highly detailed. It should describe, in a universal way, the physical and chemical processes that any insect uses to exchange gases through the respiratory system (i.e. tracheal tubes and spiracles) while simultaneously containing enough morphological, physiological and neural detail that it captures the specifics of patterns exhibited by any species or individual. The second difficulty is that the framework will have to provide ultimate, evolutionary explanations for why patterns vary within and among insects as well as proximate physiological explanations for how different parts of the respiratory system are modified to produce that diversity. Although biologists have made significant progress on all of these problems individually, there has been little integration among approaches. We propose that renewed efforts be undertaken to integrate across levels and approaches with the goal of developing a new class of general, flexible models capable of explaining a greater fraction of the observed diversity of respiratory patterns.",2018,10.1242/jeb.130039,221,13,NA,130039,Respiration; Metabolic downregulation; Evaporative water loss; Environmental adaptation; Complex systems; Emergent property; Biomimetics

Mummichogs were transferred from freshwater (FW) to seawater (SW, 35 parts per thousand) and from SW to hypersaline SW (2SW, 60 parts per thousand) in a time course with transfer control groups (FW to FW, and SW to SW). FW to SW transfer increased mRNA abundance of cldn-10d and cldn-10e twofold, whilst cldn-10c and cldn-10f transcripts were unchanged. Transfer from SW to 2SW did not alter cldn-10d, and transiently altered cldn-10e abundance, but increased cldn-10c and cldn-10f fourfold. This was coincident with an increased number of single-stranded junctions (observed by transmission electron microscopy). For both salinity transfers, (1) cldn-10e mRNA was acutely responsive (i.e. after 24 h), (2) other responsive cldn-10 isoforms increased later (3-7 days), and (3) cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) mRNA was elevated in accordance with established changes in transcellular Cl- movement. Changes in mRNA encoding cldn-10c and -10f appeared linked, consistent with the tandem repeat locus in the Fundulus genome, whereas mRNA for tandem cldn-10d and cldn-10e seemed independent of each other. Cation selectivity sequence measured by voltage and conductance responses to artificial SW revealed Eisenman sequence VII:Na+>K+>Rb+similar to Cs+>Li+.

article,Internal pigment cells respond to external UV radiation in frogs,"Franco-Belussi, Lilian and Skold, Helen Nilsson and de Oliveira, Classius",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Fish and amphibians have pigment cells that generate colorful skins important for signaling, camouflage, thermoregulation and protection against ultraviolet radiation (UVR). However, many animals also have pigment cells inside their bodies, on their internal organs and membranes. In contrast to external pigmentation, internal pigmentation is remarkably little studied and its function is not well known. Here, we tested genotoxic effects of UVR and its effects on internal pigmentation in a neotropical frog, Physalaemus nattereri. We found increases in body darkness and internal melanin pigmentation in testes and heart surfaces and in the mesenterium and lumbar region after just a few hours of UVR exposure. The melanin dispersion in melanomacrophages in the liver and melanocytes in testes increased after UV exposure. In addition, the amount of melanin inside melanomacrophages cells also increased. Although mast cells were quickly activated by UVR, only longer UVR exposure resulted in genotoxic effects inside frogs, by increasing the frequency of micronuclei in red blood cells. This is the first study to describe systemic responses of externalUVRon internal melanin pigmentation, melanomacrophages and melanocytes in frogs and thus provides a functional explanation to the presence of internal pigmentation.",2016,10.1242/jeb.134973,219,9,1378-1383,NA,Melanocytes; Melanomacrophages; Solar radiation; DNA damage; Anuran; Physalaemus nattereri
article,Salinity-induced regulation of the <i>myo</i>-inositol biosynthesis pathway in tilapia gill epithelium,"Sacchi, Romina and Li, Johnathon and Villarreal, Fernando and Gardell, Alison M. and Kueltz, Dietmar",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The myo-inositol biosynthesis (MIB) pathway converts glucose-6-phosphate to the compatible osmolyte myo-inositol that protects cells from osmotic stress. Using proteomics, the enzymes that constitute the MIB pathway, myo-inositol phosphate synthase (MIPS) and inositol monophosphatase 1 (IMPA1), are identified in tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) gill epithelium. Targeted, quantitative, label-free proteomics reveals that they are both upregulated during salinity stress. Upregulation is stronger when fish are exposed to severe (34 ppt acute and 90 ppt gradual) relative to moderate (70 ppt gradual) salinity stress. IMPA1 always responds more strongly than MIPS, suggesting that MIPS is more stable during salinity stress. MIPS is N-terminally acetylated and the corresponding peptide increases proportionally to MIPS protein, while non-acetylated N-terminal peptide is not detectable, indicating that MIPS acetylation is constitutive and may serve to stabilize the protein. Hyperosmotic induction of MIPS and IMPA1 is confirmed using western blot and real-time qPCR and is much higher at the mRNA than at the protein level. Two distinct MIPS mRNA variants are expressed in the gill, but one is more strongly regulated by salinity than the other. A single MIPS gene is encoded in the tilapia genome whereas the zebrafish genome lacks MIPS entirely. The genome of euryhaline tilapia contains four IMPA genes, two of which are expressed, but only one is salinity regulated in gill epithelium. The genome of stenohaline zebrafish contains a single IMPA gene. We conclude that the MIB pathway represents a major salinity stress coping mechanism that is regulated at multiple levels in euryhaline fish but absent in stenohaline zebrafish.",2013,10.1242/jeb.093823,216,24,4626-4638,NA,osmoregulation; compatible osmolytes; fish gill; targeted LC-MS/MS; N-terminal acetylation
article,The alternative oxidase (AOX) increases sulphide tolerance in the highly invasive marine invertebrate <i>Ciona intestinalis</i>,"Brerner, Katharina and Yasuo, Hitoyoshi and Debes, Paul Vincent and Jacobs, Howard Trevor",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Ecological communities and biodiversity are shaped by both abiotic and biotic factors. This is well illustrated by extreme environments and invasive species. Besides naturally occurring sulphide-rich environments, global change can lead to an increase in hydrogen sulphide episodes that threaten many multicellular organisms. With the increase in the formation, size and abundance of oxygen minimum zones and hypoxic environments, bacterial-associated sulphide production is favoured and, as such, hydrogen-sulphide-rich environments are likely to also increase in size and abundance. Many species are challenged by the inhibiting effect of sulphide on aerobic energy production via cytochrome c oxidase, ultimately causing the death of the organism. Interestingly, many protist, yeast, plant and also animal species possess a sulphide-resistant alternative oxidase (AOX). In this study, we investigated whether AOX is functionally involved in the sulphide stress response of the highly invasive marine tunicate Ciona intestinalis. At the LC50, the sulphide-induced reduction of developmental success was three times stronger in AOX knock-down embryos than in control embryos. Further, AOX mRNA levels were higher under sulphide than under control conditions, and this effect increased during embryonic development. Together, we found that AOX is indeed functionally involved in the sulphide tolerance of C. intestinalis embryos, hence, very likely contributing to its invasive potential; and that the response of AOX to sulphide seems to be controlled at the transcriptional level. We suggest that AOX-possessing species play an important role in shaping marine ecological communities, and this importance may increase under ongoing global change.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242985,224,16,NA,jeb242985,Climate change; Embryonic development; Energy metabolism; Invasive species; Morpholino
article,Water restriction increases oxidation of endogenous amino acids in house sparrows (Passer domesticus),"Rogers, Elizabeth J. and Gerson, Alexander R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Animals can cope with dehydration in a myriad of ways, both behaviorally and physiologically. The oxidation of protein produces more metabolic water per kilojoule than that of fat or carbohydrate, and it is well established that birds increase protein catabolism in response to high rates of water loss. However, the fate of amino acids mobilized in response to water restriction has not been explicitly determined. While protein catabolism releases bound water, we hypothesized that water-restricted birds would also oxidize the resulting amino acids, producing additional water as a product of oxidative phosphorylation. To test this, we fed captive house sparrows (Passer domesticus)13C-labeled leucine for 9 weeks to label endogenous proteins. We conducted weekly trials during which we measured the physiological response to water restriction as changes in lean mass, fat mass, metabolism and the enrichment of 13C in exhaled CO2 (delta 13Cbreath). If water-restricted birds catabolized proteins and oxidized the resulting amino acids, we expected to simultaneously observe greater lean mass loss and elevated delta 13Cbreath relative to control birds. We found that water-restricted birds catabolized more lean tissue and also had enriched delta 13Cbreath in response to water restriction, supporting our hypothesis. delta 13Cbreath, however, varied with metabolic rate and the length of the water restriction period, suggesting that birds may spare protein when water balance can be achieved using other physiological strategies.",2024,10.1242/jeb.246483,227,6,NA,jeb246483,Water balance; Metabolism; Body composition; Stable isotopes; Birds

S. and Artigaud, Sebastien and Pisapia, Julia and Bernay, Benoit and Miner, Philippe and Pichereau, Vianney and Strand, Oivind and Boudry, Pierre and Charrier, Gregory",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Ocean acidification and warming are key stressors for many marine organisms. Some organisms display physiological acclimatization or plasticity, but this may vary across species ranges, especially if populations are adapted to local climatic conditions. Understanding how acclimatization potential varies among populations is therefore important in predicting species responses to climate change. We carried out a common garden experiment to investigate how different populations of the economically important great scallop (Pecten maximus) from France and Norway responded to variation in temperature and PCO2 concentration. After acclimation, post-larval scallops (spat) were reared for 31 days at one of two temperatures (13 \& DEG;C or 19 \& DEG;C) under either ambient or elevated PCO2 (pH 8.0 and pH 7.7). We combined measures of proteomic, metabolic and phenotypic traits to produce an integrative picture of how physiological plasticity varies between the populations. The proteome of French spat showed significant sensitivity to environmental variation, with 12 metabolic, structural and stress-response proteins responding to temperature and/or PCO2. Principal component analysis revealed seven energy metabolism proteins in French spat that were consistent with countering ROS stress under elevated temperature. Oxygen uptake in French spat did not change under elevated temperature but increased under elevated PCO2. In contrast, Norwegian spat reduced oxygen uptake under both elevated temperature and PCO2. Metabolic plasticity allows French scallops to maintain greater energy availability for growth compared with Norwegian spat. However, increased physiological plasticity and growth in French spat may come at a cost, as they showed reduced survival compared with Norwegian scallops under elevated temperature.",2023,10.1242/jeb.245383,226,11,NA,jeb245383,Bivalve; Proteomics; Trade-offs; Calcification; Climate change; Physiological plasticity

We measured thermoregulatory responses to acute heat stress in three species of Caprimulgiformes that nest in areas of extreme heat and aridity, the common poorwill (Phalaenoptilus nuttallii: Caprimulgidae) and lesser nighthawk (Chordeiles acutipennis: Caprimulgidae) in the Sonoran Desert of Arizona, and the Australian owlet-nightjar (Aegotheles cristatus: Aegothelidae) in the mallee woodlands of South Australia. We exposed wild-caught birds to progressively increasing air temperatures (T-a) and measured resting metabolic rate (RMR), evaporative water loss (EWL), body temperature (T-b) and heat tolerance limit (HTL; the maximum T-a reached). Comparatively low RMR values were observed in all species (0.35, 0.36 and 0.40 Wfor the poorwill, nighthawk and owlet-nightjar, respectively), with T-b approximating T-a at 40 degrees C and mild hyperthermia occurring as T-a reached the HTL. Nighthawks and poorwills reached HTLs of 60 and 62 degrees C, respectively, whereas the owlet-nightjar had a HTL of 52 degrees C. RMR increased gradually above minima at T-a of 42, 42 and 35 degrees C, and reached 1.7, 1.9 and 2.0 times minimum resting values at HTLs in the poorwill, nighthawk and owlet-nightjar, respectively. EWL increased rapidly and linearly as T-a exceeded T-b and resulted in maximum rates of evaporative heat dissipation equivalent to 237-424\% of metabolic heat production. Bouts of gular flutter resulted in large transient increases in evaporative heat loss (50-123\%) accompanied by only small increments in RMR (<5\%). The cavity-nesting/roosting owlet-nightjar had a lower HTL and less efficient evaporative cooling compared with the species that nest and/or roost on open desert surfaces.

Little is known about whether such changes occur independently of external cues, such as photoperiod or temperature, or how they may impact the central nervous system. We compared membrane properties of neurons isolated from the retina of goldfish (Carassius auratus), an organism well adapted to extreme environmental change, during the summer and winter months. Goldfish were maintained in a facility under constant environmental conditions throughout the year. Analysis of whole-retina phospholipid composition using mass spectrometry-based lipidomics revealed a twofold increase in phosphatidylethanolamine species during the winter, suggesting an increase in cell membrane fluidity. Atomic force microscopy was used to produce localized, nanoscale-force deformation of neuronal membranes. Measurement of Young's modulus indicated increased membrane-cortical stiffness (or decreased elasticity) in neurons isolated during the winter. Voltage-clamp electrophysiology was used to assess physiological changes in neurons between seasons. Winter neurons displayed a hyperpolarized reversal potential (V-rev) and a significantly lower input resistance (R-in) compared with summer neurons. This was indicative of a decrease in membrane excitability during the winter. Subsequent measurement of intracellular Ca2+ activity using Fura-2 microspectrofluorometry confirmed a reduction in action potential activity, including duration and action potential profile, in neurons isolated during the winter. These studies demonstrate chemical and biophysical changes that occur in retinal neurons of goldfish throughout the year without exposure to seasonal cues, and suggest a novel mechanism of seasonal regulation of retinal activity.",2022,10.1242/jeb.244238,225,10,NA,jeb244238,Season; Retina; Phosphatidylethanolamine; Horizontal cell; Membrane; Action potential

To study these impacts, we exposed a common sediment-dwelling bivalve, the soft-shell clam Mya arenaria, for 21 days to chronic hypoxia (P-O2 similar to 4.1 kPa), cyclic hypoxia (P-O2 similar to 12.7-1.9 kPa, mean 5.7 kPa) or normoxia (P-O2 similar to 21.1 kPa). pH was manipulated to mimic the covariation in CO2/pH and oxygen levels in coastal hypoxic zones. Mitochondria' respiration, including proton leak, the capacity for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), the maximum activity of the electron transport system (ETS), reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and activity and oxygen affinity of cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) were assessed. Acclimation to constant hypoxia did not affect the studied mitochondrial traits except for a modest decrease in the OXPHOS coupling efficiency. Cyclic hypoxia had no effect on OXPHOS or ETS capacity, but increased proton leak and lowered mitochondrial OXPHOS coupling efficiency. Furthermore, mitochondria of clams acclimated to cyclic hypoxia had higher rates of ROS generation compared with the clams acclimated to normoxia or chronic hypoxia. CCO activity was upregulated under cyclic hypoxia, but oxygen affinity of CCO did not change. These findings indicate that long-term cyclic hypoxia has a stronger impact on the mitochondria of M. arenaria than chronic hypoxia and might lead to impaired ATP synthesis, higher costs of mitochondrial maintenance and oxidative stress. These changes might negatively affect populations of M. arenaria in the coastal Baltic Sea under increasing hypoxia pressure.",2021,10.1242/jeb.237156,224,4,NA,jeb237156,Cyclic hypoxia; Chronic hypoxia; Oxidative phosphorylation; Mitochondrial proton leak; Oxidative stress; Electron leak; Bivalve

S. and Ando, Masaaki",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The intestine of marine teleosts secretes HCO3- into the lumen and precipitates Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the imbibed seawater as carbonates to decrease luminal fluid osmolality and facilitate water absorption. However, the hormonal regulation of HCO3- secretion is largely unknown. Here, mucosally added guanylin (GN) increased HCO3- secretion, measured by pH-stat, across isolated seawater-acclimated eel intestine bathed in saline at pH 7.4 (5\% CO2). The effect of GN on HCO3- secretion was slower than that on the short-circuit current, and the time course of the GN effect was similar to that of bumetanide. Mucosal bumetanide and serosal 4,4'-dinitrostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DNDS) inhibited the GN effect, suggesting an involvement of apical Na+-K+-2Cl(-) cotransporter (NKCC2) and basolateral Cl-/HCO3- exchanger (AE)/Na+-HCO3- cotransporter (NBC) in the GN effect. As mucosal DNDS failed to inhibit the GN effect, apical DNDS-sensitive AE may not be involved. To identify molecular species of transporters involved in the GN effect, we performed RNA-seq analyses followed by quantitative real-time PCR after transfer of eels to seawater. Among the genes upregulated after seawater transfer, AE genes (draa, b, and pat1a, c) on the apical membrane, and NBC genes (nbce1a, n1, n2a) and an AE gene (sat-1) on the basolateral membrane were candidates involved in HCO3- secretion. Judging from the slow effect of GN, we suggest that GN inhibits NKCC2b on the apical membrane and decreases cytosolic Cl- and Na+, which then activates apical DNDS-insensitive DRAs and basolateral DNDS-sensitive NBCs to enhance transcellular HCO3- flux across the intestinal epithelia of seawater-acclimated eels.",2019,10.1242/jeb.203539,222,13,NA,jeb203539,Bicarbonate secretion; Euryhaline teleost; Gene expression; Intestine; Molecular identification; Seawater adaptation

However, recent work shows that lactate ions activate arterial chemoreceptors independent of pH to stimulate breathing. Although lactate rises in the central nervous system (CNS) during metabolic challenges, the ability of lactate ions to enhance ventilation by directly targeting the central respiratory network remains unclear. To address this possibility, we isolated the amphibian brainstem-spinal cord and found that small increases in CNS lactate stimulate motor output that causes breathing. In addition, lactate potentiated the excitatory postsynaptic strength of respiratory motor neurons, thereby coupling central lactate to the excitatory drive of neurons that trigger muscle contraction. Lactate did not affect motor output through pH or pyruvate metabolism, arguing for sensitivity to lactate anions per se.

Harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) are among the smallest marine mammals, and yet they live in cold, high-latitude waters where their high surface-to-volume ratio suggests high FMRs to stay warm. However, published FMR estimates of harbour porpoises are contradictory, with some studies claiming high FMRs and others concluding that the energetic requirements of porpoises resemble those of similar-sized terrestrial mammals. Here, we address this controversy using data from a combination of captive and wild porpoises to estimate the FMR of wild porpoises. We show that FMRs of harbour porpoises are up to two times greater than for similar-sized terrestrial mammals, supporting the hypothesis that small, carnivorous marine mammals in cold water have elevated FMRs. Despite the potential cost of thermoregulation in colder water, harbour porpoise FMRs are stable over seasonally changing water temperatures. Varying heat loss seems to be managed via cyclical fluctuations in energy intake, which serve to build up a blubber layer that largely offsets the extra costs of thermoregulation during winter. Such high FMRs are consistent with the recently reported high feeding rates of wild porpoises and highlight concerns about the potential impact of human activities on individual fitness and population dynamics.",2018,10.1242/jeb.185827,221,23,NA,jeb185827,Bio-logging; Doubly labelled water; Energetics; Food intake; Phocoena; Respiration
article,Divergent strategies for adaptations to stress resistance in two tropical <i>Drosophila</i> species: effects of developmental acclimation in <i>D. bipectinata</i> and the invasive species <i>D. malerkotliana</i>,"Parkash, Ravi and Singh, Divya and Lambhod, Chanderkala",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Previous studies on two tropical Drosophila species (D. malerkotliana and D. bipectinata) have shown lower resistance to stress-related traits but the rapid colonization of D. malerkotliana in the past few decades is not consistent with its sensitivity to desiccation and cold stress. We tested the hypothesis that developmental acclimation at two growth temperatures (17 and 25 degrees C) can confer adaptations to desiccation and thermal stresses. We found divergence in developmental plastic effects on cuticular traits, i.e. a significant increase of body melanisation (similar to 2-fold) and of cuticular lipid mass (similar to 3-fold) in D. malerkotliana but only 1.5-fold higher cuticular lipid mass in D. bipectinata when grown at 17 degrees C compared with 25 degrees C. A comparison of the water budget of these two species showed significantly higher effects of developmental acclimation on body water content, rate of water loss and dehydration tolerance resulting in higher desiccation resistance in D. malerkotliana than in D. bipectinata. When grown in cooler conditions (17 degrees C), D. malerkotliana had greater resistance to cold as well as desiccation stress. In contrast, heat resistance of D. bipectinata was higher when grown at 25 degrees C. These laboratory observations are supported by data on seasonally varying populations. Furthermore, adult D. malerkotliana acclimated to different stresses showed greater resistance to those stresses than D. bipectinata adults. Thus, significant increase in stress resistance of D. malerkotliana through developmental acclimation may be responsible for its invasion and ecological success on different continents compared with D. bipectinata.",2014,10.1242/jeb.096818,217,6,924-934,NA,Developmental acclimation; Stress resistance; Drosophila bipectinata; Invasion by Drosophila malerkotliana

A case study of the leopard iguana (<i>Diplolaemus leopardinus</i>) in Central Andes of Argentina,"Vicenzi, Nadia and Bacigalupe, Leonardo D. and Laspiur, Alejandro and Ibarguengoytia, Nora and Sassi, Paola L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The predicted rise of global temperatures is of major concern for ectotherms because of its direct impact on their behavior and physiology. As physiological performance mediates a species' resilience to warming exposure, physiological plasticity could greatly reduce the susceptibility to climate change. We studied the degree to which Diplolaemus leopardinus lizards are able to adjust behavioral and physiological traits in response to short periods of temperature change. We used a split cross design to measure the acclimation response of preferred body temperature (T-p), and the thermal performance curve of resting metabolic rate (RMR) and evaporative water loss (EWL). Our results showed that plasticity differs among traits: whereas T-p and EWL showed lower values in warm conditions, the body temperature at which RMR was highest increased. Moreover, RMR was affected by thermal history, showing a large increase in response to cold exposure in the group initially acclimated to warm temperatures. The reduction of EWL and the increase in optimal temperature will give lizards the potential to partially mitigate the impact of rising temperatures in the energy cost and water balance. However, the decrease in T-p and the sensitivity to the warm thermal history of RMR could be detrimental to the energy net gain, increasing the species' vulnerability, especially considering the increase of heat waves predicted for the next 50 years. The integration of acclimation responses in behavioral and physiological traits provides a better understanding of the range of possible responses of lizards to cope with the upcoming climatic and environmental modifications expected as a result of climate change.",2021,10.1242/jeb.242647,224,14,NA,jeb242647,Metabolism; Phenotypic plasticity; Reptiles; Thermal preference; Water loss
article,"Going with the flow - how a stream insect, <i>Pteronarcys californica</i>, exploits local flows to increase oxygen availability","Birrell, Jackson H. and Woods, H. Arthur",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"For insects, life in water is challenging because oxygen supply is typically low compared with in air. Oxygen limitation may occur when oxygen levels or water flows are low or when warm temperatures stimulate metabolic demand for oxygen. A potential mechanism for mitigating oxygen shortages is behavior - moving to cooler, more oxygenated or faster flowing microhabitats. Whether stream insects can make meaningful choices, however, depends on: (i) how temperature, oxygen and flow vary at microspatial scales and (ii) the ability of insects to sense and exploit that variation. To assess the extent of microspatial variation in conditions, we measured temperature, oxygen saturation and flow velocity within riffles of two streams in Montana, USA. In the lab, we then examined preferences of nymphs of the stonefly Pteronarcys californica to experimental gradients based on field-measured values. Temperature and oxygen level varied only slightly within stream riffles. By contrast, flow velocity was highly heterogeneous, often varying by more than 125 cm s(-1) within riffles and 44 cm s(-1) around individual cobbles. Exploiting micro-variation in flow may thus be the most reliable option for altering rates of oxygen transport. In support of this prediction, P. californica showed little ability to exploit gradients in temperature and oxygen but readily exploited micro-variation in flow consistently choosing higher flows when conditions were warm or hypoxic. These behaviors may help stream insects mitigate lowoxygen stress from climate change and other anthropogenic disturbances.",2023,10.1242/jeb.244609,226,3,NA,jeb244609,Aquatic insects; Behavior; Boundary layer; Discharge; Microclimates; Temperature
article,The planarian <i>TRPA1</i> homolog mediates extraocular behavioral responses to near-ultraviolet light,"Birkholz, Taylor R. and Beane, Wendy S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Although light is most commonly thought of as a visual cue, many animals possess mechanisms to detect light outside of the eye for various functions, including predator avoidance, circadian rhythms, phototaxis and migration. Here we confirm that planarians (like Caenorhabditis elegans, leeches and Drosophila larvae) are capable of detecting and responding to light using extraocular photoreception. We found that, when either eyeless or decapitated worms were exposed to near-ultraviolet (near-UV) light, intense wildtype photophobic behaviors were still observed. Our data also revealed that behavioral responses to green wavelengths were mediated by ocular mechanisms, whereas near-UV responses were driven by extraocular mechanisms. As part of a candidate screen to uncover the genetic basis of extraocular photoreception in the planarian species Schmidtea mediterranea, we identified a potential role for a homolog of the transient receptor potential channel A1 (TRPA1) in mediating behavioral responses to extraocular light cues. RNA interference (RNAi) to Smed-TrpA resulted in worms that lacked extraocular photophobic responses to near-UV light, a mechanism previously only identified in Drosophila. These data show that the planarian TRPA1 homolog is required for planarian extraocular-light avoidance and may represent a potential ancestral function of this gene. TRPA1 is an evolutionarily conserved detector of temperature and chemical irritants, including reactive oxygen species that are byproducts of UV-light exposure. Our results suggest that planarians possess extraocular photoreception and display an unconventional TRPA1-mediated photophobic response to near-UV light.",2017,10.1242/jeb.152298,220,14,2616-2625,NA,Planaria; Extraocular photoreception; Dermal phototransduction; UV-light detection; TRPA1; Neuroethology

Here, we quantified the thermal dependence of physiological performance in neonates of a tropical shark species (blacktip reef shark, Carcharhinus melanopterus) from shallow, nearshore habitats. We measured minimum and maximum oxygen uptake rates ((M) over dot(O2)), calculated aerobic scope, excess post-exercise oxygen consumption and recovery from exercise, and measured critical thermal maxima (CTmax), thermal safety margins, hypoxia tolerance, specific growth rates, body condition and food conversion efficiencies at two ecologically relevant acclimation temperatures (28 and 31 degrees C). Owing to high post-exercise mortality, a third acclimation temperature (33 degrees C) was not investigated further. Acclimation temperature did not affect (M) over dot(O2) or growth, but CTmax and hypoxia tolerance were greatest at 31 degrees C and positively associated. We also quantified in vitro temperature (25, 30 and 35 degrees C) and pH effects on haemoglobin-oxygen (Hb-O-2) affinity of wild-caught, non-acclimated sharks. As expected, Hb-O-2 affinity decreased with increasing temperatures, but pH effects observed at 30 degrees C were absent at 25 and 35 degrees C. Finally, we logged body temperatures of free-ranging sharks and determined that C. melanopterus neonates avoided 31 degrees C in situ. We conclude that C. melanopterus neonates demonstrate minimal thermal dependence of whole-organism physiological performance across a seasonal temperature range and may use behaviour to avoid unfavourable environmental temperatures. The association between thermal tolerance and hypoxia tolerance suggests a common mechanism warranting further investigation.

article,"Periodic heartbeat reversals cause cardiogenic inspiration and expiration with coupled spiracle leakage in resting blowflies, <i>Calliphora</i> <i>vicina</i>","Wasserthal, Lutz T.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Respiration in insects is thought to be independent of the circulatory system because insects typically lack respiratory pigments and because oxygen transport occurs in the gaseous phase through a ramified tracheal system by diffusion and convection directly to the tissues. In the blowfly, as in other insects with periodic heartbeat reversal, the haemolymph is periodically shifted between the anterior body and abdomen, exerting alternating pressure changes on the compliant tracheae in the thorax and in the abdomen. Simultaneous pressure and O-2 optode measurements show that, during negative pressure periods, the tracheal partial pressure of oxygen (P-O2) increases by 0.5 kPa. In the quiescent fly, tracheal P-O2 is rather high (17.5-18.9 kPa), although the thoracic spiracles remain constricted. Microscopic video recordings and reflectance measurements revealed that the dorsal soft edges of the valve lips of the second spiracle leave a very small leak, which is passively widened during backward pulses of the heart. Thus, negative pressure, combined with increased leakage of the spiracle Sp(2) valve enable inspiration in the thorax. The positive pressure periods are correlated with a new type of convective CO2 micro-bursts as shown in flow-through measurements. The bulk of the CO2 is, however, released after longer interbursts in macro-bursts with actively opening valves reminiscent of the open phase in a cyclic gas exchange. When the valves open, the P-O2 in the thoracic air sacs unexpectedly drops by a mean of 2.75 +/- 1.09 kPa, suggesting a displacement of O-2 by the transient accumulation of CO2 in the tracheal system before its release.",2014,10.1242/jeb.097238,217,9,1543-1554,NA,Insect respiration; Circulation; Tracheal pressure; Tracheae; Spiracles; Oxygen; Haemolymph; Cyclic gas exchange; Suction ventilation; CO2 release; Macro-burst; Flutter phase; Water retention

However, previous studies have mainly examined decapod brachyurans with marine ancestries inhabiting estuaries or tidal creeks on a seasonal basis. Here, we describe osmoregulation in the atyid Halocaridina rubra, an endemic Hawaiian shrimp of freshwater ancestry from the islands' anchialine ecosystem (coastal ponds with subsurface freshwater and seawater connections) that encounters near-continuous spatial and temporal salinity changes. Given this, survival and osmoregulatory responses were examined over a wide salinity range. In the laboratory, H. rubra tolerated salinities of similar to 0-56\%, acting as both a hyper- and hypo-osmoregulator and maintaining a maximum osmotic gradient of similar to 868 mOsm kg(-1) H2O in freshwater. Furthermore, hemolymph osmolality was more stable during salinity transfers relative to other crustaceans. Silver nitrate and vital mitochondria-rich cell staining suggest all gills are osmoregulatory, with a large proportion of each individual gill functioning in ion transport (including when H. rubra acts as an osmoconformer in seawater). Additionally, expression of ion transporters and supporting enzymes that typically undergo upregulation during salinity transfer in osmoregulatory gills (i.e. Na+/K+-ATPase, carbonic anhydrase, Na+/K+/2Cl(-) cotransporter, V-type H+-ATPase and arginine kinase) were generally unaltered in H. rubra during similar transfers. These results suggest H. rubra (and possibly other anchialine species) maintains high, constitutive levels of gene expression and ion transport capability in the gills as a means of potentially coping with the fluctuating salinities that are encountered in anchialine habitats. Thus, anchialine taxa represent an interesting avenue for future physiological research.",2014,10.1242/jeb.103051,217,13,2309-2320,NA,Arginine kinase; Carbonic anhydrase; Crustacean; Euryhaline; Gene expression; Gill; Na+/K+-ATPase; Na+/K+/2Cl(-) co-transporter; qPCR; Salt/ion transport; Transcriptome; V-type H+-ATPase

The purpose of our study was to examine features necessary for survival in the same apparent habitat, because the two species co- exist in riffle areas of freshwater streams. Both species are highly sensitive to water loss as a result of high water loss rates and depend on immersion in fresh water (hypo-osmotic) to maintain water stores. In contrast to C. pettiti, H. morosa is larger, retains water more effectively, and features reduced water loss rates with suppressed activation energies. When H. morosa was confined to areas of low or no water flow, overhydration led to rapid mortality, whereas the same conditions favored water balance maintenance and survival in C. pettiti. In attraction bioassays, H. morosa moved and remained within areas of high water flow and C. pettiti preferred areas with low water flow. Because water flow rates are unlikely to directly impact water gain, the mechanism responsible for increased survival and water balance maintenance is likely related to the impact of water flow on oxygen availability, differences in feeding ecology, or other underlying factors.",2015,10.1242/jeb.110684,218,3,363-369,NA,Water exchange; Hyperosmotic; Attraction; Freshwater; Biological indicator
article,A thermoregulatory role for the medullary raphe in birds,"Cristina-Silva, Caroline and Gargaglioni, Luciane H. and Bicego, Kenia Cardoso",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The brainstem region medullary raphe modulates non-shivering and shivering thermogenesis and cutaneous vasomotion in rodents. Whether the same scenario occurs in the other endothermic group, i.e. birds, is still unknown. Therefore, we hypothesized that the medullary raphe modulates heat gain and loss thermoeffectors in birds. We investigated the effect of glutamatergic and GABAergic inhibition in this specific region on body temperature (T-b), oxygen consumption (thermogenesis), ventilation (O-2 supply in cold, thermal tachypnea in heat) and heat loss index (cutaneous vasomotion) in 1 week old chicken exposed to neutral (31 degrees C), cold (26 degrees C) and hot (36 degrees C) conditions. Infra-medullary raphe antagonism of NMDA glutamate (AP5; 0.5, 5 mmol l(-1)) and GABA A (bicuculline; 0.05, 0.5 mmol l(-1)) receptors reduced T-b of chicks at 31 and 26 degrees C, mainly as a result of an O(2 )consumption decrease. AP5 transiently increased breathing frequency during cold exposure. At 31 degrees C, heat loss index was higher in the bicuculline and AP5 groups (higher doses) than in the saline groups at the beginning of the T-b reduction. No treatment affected any variable tested at 36 degrees C. The results suggest that glutamatergic and GABAergic excitatory influences on the medullary raphe of chicks modulate thermogenesis, and glutamatergic stimulation prevents tachypnea, without having any role in warmth-defense responses. A double excitation influence on the medullary raphe may provide a protective neural mechanism for supporting thermogenesis during early life, when energy expenditure to support growth and homeothermy is high. This novel demonstration of a thermoregulatory role for the raphe in birds suggests a convergent brainstem neurochemical regulation of T-b in endotherms.",2021,10.1242/jeb.234344,224,9,NA,jeb234344,Brainstem; GABA; Glutamate; Chick; Oxygen consumption; Heat loss index; Thermal tachypnea

From a physiological point of view, temperature is also positively correlated to metabolism and is often associated with an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. It has recently been suggested that ROS play a role in lifespan and resource allocation. However, only a few authors have attempted to explore the relationships between temperature, resource allocation and oxidative balance in ectotherms. Here, we measured the effect of temperature on growth, reproductive effort, offspring quantity and quality, hatching and survival rates, and the associated proximal costs, which were evaluated through the quantification of oxidative balance elements. We reared adult fish (Oryzias latipes) at two non-stressful temperatures (20 and 30 degrees C) during a relatively long period (4 months, approximately the entire adult life). The results show a trade-off between reproduction and maintenance because investment toward growth could be neglected at the adult stage (confirmed by our results). Intriguingly, ROS-dependent damages did not differ between the two groups, probably because of the higher rate of activation of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase for warm-acclimated fish. The allocation toward antioxidant defences is associated with an earlier reproduction and a lower quality of offspring. These interesting results bring new perspectives in terms of the prediction of the impact of global warming on biota through the use of ecological theories based on oxidative balance and metabolism.",2014,10.1242/jeb.096172,217,2,274-282,NA,Maintenance; Reproduction; Oxidative metabolism; Ectotherms

We know little about whether such changes remain to adulthood, which is important to understand the links between climate change, development and fitness. We investigated whether phenotypic consequences of the thermal environment in early life remained in adulthood in two studies on Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica). Birds were raised under simulated heatwave, cold snap or control conditions, from hatching until halfway through the growth period, and then in common garden conditions until reproductively mature. We measured biometric and thermoregulatory [}metabolic heat production (MHP), evaporative water and heat loss (EWL, EHL) and body temperature] responses to variation in submaximal air temperature at the end of the thermal acclimation period and in adulthood. Warm birds had lower MHP than control birds at the end of the thermal acclimation period and, in the warmest temperature studied (40(degrees)C), also had higher evaporative cooling capacity compared with controls. No analogous responses were recorded in cold birds, although they had higher EWL than controls in all but the highest test temperature. None of the effects found at the end of the heatwave or cold snap period remained until adulthood. This implies that chicks exposed to higher temperatures could be more prepared to counter heat stress as juveniles but that they do not enjoy any advantages of such developmental conditions when facing high temperatures as adults.

article,Transient-state mechanisms of wind-induced burrow ventilation,"Turner, J. Scott and Pinshow, Berry",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Burrows are common animal habitations, yet living in a burrow presents physiological challenges for its inhabitants because the burrow isolates them from sources and sinks for oxygen, carbon dioxide, water vapor and ammonia. Conventionally, the isolation is thought to be overcome by either diffusion gas exchange within the burrow or some means of capturing wind energy to power steady or quasi-steady bulk flows of air through it. Both are examples of what may be called `DC' models, namely steady to quasi-steady flows powered by steady to quasi-steady winds. Natural winds, however, are neither steady nor quasi-steady, but are turbulent, with a considerable portion of the energy contained in so-called `AC' (i.e. unsteady) components, where wind velocity varies chaotically and energy to power gas exchange is stored in some form. Existing DC models of burrow gas exchange do not account for this potentially significant source of energy for ventilation. We present evidence that at least two AC mechanisms operate to ventilate both single-opening burrows (of the Cape skink, Trachylepis capensis) and double-opening model burrows (of Sundevall's jird, Meriones crassus).

With climate change, an increase in the occurrence of extreme high temperatures and drought events is expected. While the effects of cold and dehydration stress on polar arthropods are well studied in combination, little is known about how these species respond to the combined effects of heat and dehydration stress. In this paper, we investigated how the heat tolerance of the Arctic collembola Megaphorura arctica is affected by combinations of different temperature and humidity acclimation regimes under controlled laboratory conditions. The effect of acclimation temperature was complex and highly dependent on both acclimation time and temperature, and was found to have a positive, negative or no effect depending on experimental conditions. Further, we found marked effects of the interaction between temperature and humidity on heat tolerance, with lower humidity severely decreasing heat tolerance when the acclimation temperature was increased. This effect was more pronounced with increasing acclimation time. Lastly, the effect of acclimation on heat tolerance under a fluctuating temperature regime was dependent on acclimation temperature and time, as well as humidity levels. Together, these results show that thermal acclimation alone has moderate or no effect on heat tolerance, but that drought events, likely to be more frequent in the future, in combination with high temperature stress can have large negative impacts on heat tolerance of some Arctic arthropods.",2024,10.1242/jeb.247394,227,12,NA,jeb247394,Arctic; Collembola; Climate change; Thermal tolerance; Upper thermal limit; Cross-tolerance

We observed that dehydration during gestation negatively affects maternal physiological condition (lower mass gain, higher tail reserve mobilization) but has little effect on reproductive output. These effects are mainly additive to temperature regimes, with a proportional increase in maternal costs in warmer environments.

article,UV-B exposure reduces locomotor performance by impairing muscle function but not mitochondrial ATP production,"Kazerouni, Ensiyeh Ghanizadeh and Franklin, Craig E. and Seebacher, Frank",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Ultraviolet B radiation (UV-B) can reduce swimming performance by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. High concentrations of ROS can damage mitochondria, resulting in reduced ATP production. ROS can also damage muscle proteins, thereby leading to impaired muscle contractile function. We have shown previously that UV-B exposure reduces locomotor performance in mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) without affecting metabolic scope. Our aim was therefore to test whether UV-B influences swimming performance of mosquitofish by ROS-induced damage to muscle proteins without affecting mitochondrial function. In a fully factorial design, we exposed mosquitofish to UV-B and no-UV-B controls in combination with exposure to N-acetylcysteine (NAC) plus no-NAC controls. We used NAC, a precursor of glutathione, as an antioxidant to test whether any effects of UV-B on swimming performance were at least partly due to UV-B-induced ROS. UV-B significantly reduced critical sustained swimming performance and tail beat frequencies, and it increased ROS-induced damage (protein carbonyl concentrations and lipid peroxidation) in muscle. However, UV-B did not affect the activity of sarco-endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA), an enzyme associated with muscle calcium cycling and muscle relaxation. UV-B did not affect ADP phosphorylation (state 3) rates of mitochondrial respiration, and it did not alter the amount of ATP produced per atom of oxygen consumed (P:O ratio). However, UV-B reduced the mitochondrial respiratory control ratio. Under UV-B exposure, fish treated with NAC showed greater swimming performance and tail beat frequencies, higher glutathione concentrations, and lower protein carbonyl concentrations and lipid peroxidation than untreated fish. Tail beat amplitude was not affected by any treatment. Our results showed, firstly, that the effects of UV-B on locomotor performance were mediated by ROS and, secondly, that reduced swimming performance was not caused by impaired mitochondrial ATP production. Instead, reduced tail beat frequencies indicate that muscle of UV-B exposed fish were slower, which was likely to have been caused by slower contraction rates, because SERCA activities remained unaffected.",2016,10.1242/jeb.131615,219,1,96-102,NA,Reactive oxygen species; Swimming kinematic; Calcium cycling; SERCA; Mitochondrial respiration; Glutathione

The abundance of NKA alpha 1a was lower in smolts than in parr, remained relatively constant during spring and decreased in summer. NKA alpha 1b increased tenfold in smolts during spring, peaking in late April, coincident with downstream migration and increased salinity tolerance. NKA alpha 1b increased a further twofold after seawater exposure of smolts, whereas NKA alpha 1a decreased by 98\%. The abundance of NKA alpha 1b-positive, and NKA alpha 1b and NKA alpha 1a co-labeled ionocytes increased during smolt development, whereas the number of NKA alpha 1a cells decreased. After seawater exposure of smolts, NKA alpha 1b-positive ionocytes increased, NKA alpha 1a-positive cells decreased, and co-labeled cells disappeared. Plasma growth hormone and cortisol increased during spring in smolts, but not in parr, peaking just prior to the highest levels of NKA alpha 1b. The results indicate that the increase in the abundance of NKA alpha 1b during smolt development is directly linked to the increase in salinity tolerance that occurs at this stage, but that significant changes also occur after seawater exposure. Spring increases in circulating levels of growth hormone and cortisol indicate that these hormones may be instrumental in upregulating NKA alpha 1b during smolt development.",2013,10.1242/jeb.080440,216,7,1142-1151,NA,osmoregulation; ion transport; ionocyte; Salmo salar
article,Effects of saturation deficit on desiccation resistance and water balance in seasonal populations of the tropical drosophilid <i>Zaprionus indianus</i>,"Kalra, Bhawna and Parkash, Ravi",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Seasonally varying populations of ectothermic insect taxa from a given locality are expected to cope with simultaneous changes in temperature and humidity through phenotypic plasticity. Accordingly, we investigated the effect of saturation deficit on resistance to desiccation in wild-caught flies from four seasons (spring, summer, rainy and autumn) and corresponding flies reared in the laboratory under season-specific simulated temperature and humidity growth conditions. Flies raised under summer conditions showed approximately three times higher desiccation resistance and increased levels of cuticular lipids compared with flies raised in rainy season conditions. In contrast, intermediate trends were observed for water balance-related traits in flies reared under spring or autumn conditions but trait values overlapped across these two seasons. Furthermore, a threefold difference in saturation deficit (an index of evaporative water loss due to a combined thermal and humidity effect) between summer (27.5 mB) and rainy (8.5 mB) seasons was associated with twofold differences in the rate of water loss. Higher dehydration stress due to a high saturation deficit in summer is compensated by storage of higher levels of energy metabolite (trehalose) and cuticular lipids, and these traits correlated positively with desiccation resistance. In Z. indianus, the observed changes in desiccation-related traits due to plastic effects of simulated growth conditions correspond to similar changes exhibited by seasonal wild-caught flies. Our results show that developmental plastic effects under ecologically relevant thermal and humidity conditions can explain seasonal adaptations for water balance-related traits in Z. indianus and are likely to be associated with its invasive potential.",2016,10.1242/jeb.141002,219,20,3237-3245,NA,Zaprionus indianus; Desiccation resistance; Phenotypic plasticity; Energy metabolites; Seasonal variation; Saturation deficit; Water balance
article,Thermal physiological traits and plasticity of metabolism are sensitive to biogeographic breaks in a rock-pool marine shrimp,"Barria, Aura M. and Bacigalupe, Leonardo D. and Lagos, Nelson A. and Lardies, Marco A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Populations of broadly distributed species commonly exhibit latitudinal variation in thermal tolerance and physiological plasticity. This variation can be interrupted when biogeographic breaks occur across the range of a species, which are known to affect patterns of community structure, abundance and recruitment dynamics. Coastal biogeographic breaks often impose abrupt changes in environmental characteristics driven by oceanographic processes and can affect the physiological responses of populations inhabiting these areas. Here, we examined thermal limits, performances for heart rate and plasticity in metabolic rate of the intertidal shrimp Betaeus emarginatus from seven populations along its latitudinal range (similar to 3000 km). The distribution of this species encompass two breaks along the southeastern Pacific coast of Chile: the northern break is characterized by sharp discontinuities in upwelling regimes, and the southern break constitutes a major discontinuity in water conditions (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen and nutrients), coastline topography and divergence of main oceanographic currents. For B. emarginatus, we found higher plasticity in metabolism at the sites sampled at the biogeographic breaks, and at the site subjected to seasonal upwelling. The variation in metabolic rate was not consistent with increasing latitude and it was not affected by breaks. The lower and upper thermal limits were lower in populations around breaks, although the optimum temperature decreased towards higher latitudes. Overall, whereas thermal limits and plasticity of metabolism are related to biogeographic breaks, metabolic rate is not related to increasing latitude or the presence of breaks in the sampled range.",2018,10.1242/jeb.181008,221,19,NA,jeb181008,Intraspecific variation; Thermal limits; Intertidal; Upwelling; Heart rate; Thermal performance curve; Reaction norm

The co-existence of similar tissues serving different functions allows the study of differential adaptation, in terms of free radical metabolism, upon salinity change. Crabs were immersed for 2 weeks in seawater (SW, 37 ppt), diluted SW (dSW, 10 ppt) and concentrated SW (cSW, 45 ppt). Exposure to dSW was the most challenging condition, elevating respiration rates of whole animals and free radical formation in hemolymph (assessed fluorometrically using C-H(2)DFFDA). Further analyses considered anterior and posterior gills separately, and the results showed that posterior gills are the main tissues fueling osmoregulatory-related processes because their respiration rates in dSW were 3.2-fold higher than those of anterior gills, and this was accompanied by an increase in mitochondrial density (citrate synthase activity) and increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation (1.4-fold greater, measured through electron paramagnetic resonance). Paradoxically, these posterior gills showed undisturbed caspase 3/7 activity, used here as a marker for apoptosis. This may only be due to the high antioxidant protection that posterior gills benefit from {[}superoxide dismutase (SOD) in posterior gills was over 6 times higher than in anterior gills]. In conclusion, osmoregulating posterior gills are better adapted to dSW exposure than respiratory anterior gills because they are capable of controlling the deleterious effects of the ROS production resulting from this salinity-induced stress.",2016,10.1242/jeb.128595,219,1,80-89,NA,Antioxidant defense; Carcinus aestuarii; ROS production; Osmoregulation
article,Life on the edge: O<sub>2</sub> binding in Atlantic cod red blood cells near their southern distribution limit is not sensitive to temperature or haemoglobin genotype,"Barlow, Samantha L. and Metcalfe, Julian and Righton, David A. and Berenbrink, Michael",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Atlantic cod are a commercially important species believed to be threatened by warming seas near their southern, equatorward upper thermal edge of distribution. Limitations to circulatory O-2 transport, in particular cardiac output, and the geographic distribution of functionally different haemoglobin (Hb) genotypes have separately been suggested to play a role in setting thermal tolerance in this species. The present study assessed the thermal sensitivity of O-2 binding in Atlantic cod red blood cells with different Hb genotypes near their upper thermal distribution limit and modelled its consequences for the arterio-venous O-2 saturation difference, Sa-v(O2), another major determinant of circulatory O-2 supply rate. The results showed statistically indistinguishable red blood cell O2 binding between the three HbI genotypes in wild-caught Atlantic cod from the Irish Sea (53 degrees N). Red blood cells had an unusually low O-2 affinity, with reduced or even reversed thermal sensitivity between pH 7.4 and 7.9, and 5.0 and 20.0 degrees C. This was paired with strongly pH-dependent affinity and cooperativity of red blood cell O-2 binding (Bohr and Root effects). Modelling of Sa-v(O2) at physiological pH, temperature and O-2 partial pressures revealed a substantial capacity for increases in Sa-v(O2) to meet rising tissue O-2 demands at 5.0 and 12.5 degrees C, but not at 20 degrees C. Furthermore, there was no evidence for an increase of maximal Sa-v(O2) with temperature. It is suggested that Atlantic cod at such high temperatures may solely depend on increases in cardiac output and blood O-2 capacity, or thermal acclimatisation of metabolic rate, for matching circulatory O-2 supply to tissue demand.",2017,10.1242/jeb.141044,220,3,414-424,NA,Climate change; Gadus morhua; Oxygen transport; O-2 affinity; Thermal tolerance; Bohr effect

Survival of dehydration stress is achieved through severe reduction of evaporative water loss. We assessed dehydration stress tolerance in diapausing and developing Austrofundulus limnaeus embryos. We measured oxygen consumption rates under aquatic and aerial conditions to test the hypothesis that there is a trade-off between water retention and oxygen permeability. Diapausing embryos survive dehydrating conditions for over 1.5 years, and post-diapause stages can survive for over 100 days. Diapausing embryos respond to dehydration stress by increasing oxygen consumption rates while post-diapause embryos exhibit the same or reduced rates compared with aquatic embryos. Thus, water retention does not always limit oxygen diffusion. Aerial incubation coupled with hypoxia causes some embryos to arrest development. The observed stage-specific responses are consistent with an intrinsic bethedging strategy in embryos that would increase developmental variation in a potentially adaptive manner.",2020,10.1242/jeb.231985,223,18,NA,jeb231985,Metabolism; Austrofundulus limnaeus; Dehydration; Development; Diapause; Oxygen consumption

Allele frequencies are correlated with environmental temperature, suggesting that the alleles have temperature-dependent fitness benefits. We determined the enzyme activity of each allele across a range of temperatures in vitro. The F and S alleles have higher activity and are less sensitive to high temperatures than the M allele, which loses activity after incubation at temperatures found in the thorax of foraging bees in hot climates. Next, we predicted the protein structure of each allele and used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate their molecular flexibility. The M allozyme is more flexible than the S and F allozymes at 50 degrees C, suggesting a plausible explanation for its loss of activity at high temperatures, and has the greatest structural flexibility at 15 degrees C, suggesting that it can retain some enzyme activity at cooler temperatures. MM bees recovered from 2 h of cold narcosis significantly better than all other genotypes. Combined, these results explain clinal variation in malate dehydrogenase allele frequencies in the honeybee at the molecular level.",2020,10.1242/jeb.228239,223,18,NA,jeb228239,Temperature clines; Temperature-dependent selection; Molecular dynamics; Temperature adaptation; Cold narcosis; Geographic distribution; Cline; Allozyme

One involves birds exposed to a stepped series of progressively increasing T-air setpoints for short periods (<20-30 min), whereas a second seeks to achieve steady-state conditions by exposing birds to a single T-air for longer periods (>1-2 h). To compare these two approaches, we measured T-b, RMR and EWL over T-air=28 degrees C to 44 degrees C in the dark-capped bulbul (Pycnonotus tricolor). The two protocols yielded indistinguishable values of T-b, RMR and EWL and related variables at most T-air values, revealing that both are appropriate for quantifying avian thermal physiology during heat exposure over the range of T-air in the present study.

Yet, interactions among ALAN, life-history strategy and tolerance to climate-related stressors are unknown. We determined if developmental ALAN exposure (1) affects development, (2) affects adult phenotype, including heat and desiccation tolerance, and (3) affects and/or interacts with life-history strategy. We used the variable field cricket (Gryllus lineaticeps) because its geographic range is increasingly exposed to ALAN, heat, and drought conditions, and it exhibits different life-history strategies (flight-capability versus flight-incapability). ALAN affected adult phenotype, with positive effects on body mass (and size) and female reproductive investment, and a negative effect on heat tolerance. Life-history strategy also affected stress tolerance; flight-incapable females had greater heat tolerance and their desiccation tolerance was improved by ALAN exposure.

article,Variation in developmental temperature alters adulthood plasticity of thermal tolerance in <i>Tigriopus californicus</i>,"Healy, Timothy M. and Bock, Antonia K. and Burton, Ronald S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"In response to environmental change, organisms rely on both genetic adaptation and phenotypic plasticity to adjust key traits that are necessary for survival and reproduction. Given the accelerating rate of climate change, plasticity may be particularly important. For organisms in warming aquatic habitats, upper thermal tolerance is likely to be a key trait, and many organisms express plasticity in this trait in response to developmental or adulthood temperatures. Although plasticity at one life stage may influence plasticity at another life stage, relatively little is known about this possibility for thermal tolerance. Here, we used locally adapted populations of the copepod Tigriopus californicus to investigate these potential effects in an intertidal ectotherm. We found that low latitude populations had greater critical thermal maxima (CTmax) than high latitude populations, and variation in developmental temperature altered CTmax plasticity in adults. After development at 25 degrees C, CTmax was plastic in adults, whereas no adulthood plasticity in this trait was observed after development at 20 degrees C. This pattern was identical across four populations, suggesting that local thermal adaptation has not shaped this effect among these populations. Differences in the capacities to maintain ATP synthesis rates and to induce heat shock proteins at high temperatures, two likely mechanisms of local adaptation in this species, were consistent with changes in CTmax owing to phenotypic plasticity, which suggests that there is likely mechanistic overlap between the effects of plasticity and adaptation. Together, these results indicate that developmental effects may have substantial impacts on upper thermal tolerance plasticity in adult ectotherms.",2019,10.1242/jeb.213405,222,22,NA,jeb213405,Phenotypic plasticity; Critical thermal maximum; Development; Heat shock protein; ATP synthesis; Copepod

Detrimental effects of Al toxicity on aquatic organisms are well known and can have consequences for survival. Fish exposed to Al in low pH waters will experience physiological and neuroendocrine changes that disrupt homeostasis and alter behavior. To investigate the effects of Al exposure on both the brain and behavior, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) kept in water treated with Al (pH. 5.7, 0.37 +/- 0.04 mu mol 1(-1) Al) for 2 weeks were compared with fish kept in under control conditions (pH. 6.7, <0.04 mu mol 1(-1) Al). Fish exposed to Al and acidic conditions had increased Al accumulation in the gills and decreased gill Na+, K+-ATPase activity, which impaired osmoregulatory capacity and caused physiological stress, indicated by elevated plasma cortisol and glucose levels. Here we show for the first time that exposure to Al in acidic conditions also impaired learning performance in a maze task. Al toxicity also reduced the expression of NeuroD1 transcript levels in the forebrain of exposed fish. As in mammals, these data show that exposure to chronic stress, such as acidified Al, can reduce neural plasticity during behavioral challenges in salmon, and may impair the ability to cope with new environments.",2013,10.1242/jeb.083550,216,16,3148-3155,NA,parr-smolt transformation; telencephalon; salmonid; spatial learning; chronic mild stress; physiology
article,Respirometry and cutaneous oxygen flux measurements reveal a negligible aerobic cost of ion regulation in larval zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>),"Parker, Julian J. and Zimmer, Alex M. and Perry, Steve F.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Fishes living in fresh water counter the passive loss of salts by actively absorbing ions through specialized cells termed ionocytes. lonocytes contain ATP-dependent transporters and are enriched with mitochondria; therefore ionic regulation is an energy-consuming process. The purpose of this study was to assess the aerobic costs of ion transport in larval zebrafish (Danio ratio). We hypothesized that changes in rates of Na+ uptake evoked by acidic or low Na+ rearing conditions would result in corresponding changes in whole-body oxygen consumption ((M)over dot(O2)) and/or cutaneous oxygen flux(J(O2)), measured at the ionocyte-expressing yolk sac epithelium using the scanning micro-optrode technique (SMOT). Larvae at 4 days post-fertilization (dpf) that were reared under low pH (pH 4) conditions exhibited a higher rate of Na+ uptake compared with fish reared under control conditions (pH 7.6), yet they displayed a lower (M)over dot(O2 )and no difference in cutaneous J(O2). Despite a higher Na+ uptake capacity in larvae reared under low Na+ conditions, there were no differences in (M)over dot(O2) and J(O2), at 4 dpf. Furthermore, although Na+ uptake was nearly abolished in 2 dpf larvae lacking ionocytes after morpholino knockdown of the ionocyte proliferation regulating transcription factor foxi3a, (M)over dot(O2) and J(O2) were unaffected. Finally, laser ablation of ionocytes did not affect cutaneous J(O2). Thus, we conclude that the aerobic costs of ion uptake by ionocytes in larval zebrafish, at least in the case of Na+, are below detection using whole-body respirometry or cutaneous SMOT scans, providing evidence that ion regulation in zebrafish larvae incurs a low aerobic cost.",2020,10.1242/jeb.226753,223,18,NA,jeb226753,Foxi3a; H+-ATPase-rich (HR) cell; lonocyte; Low pH; Morpholino knockdown; Na+ uptake; Scanning micro-optrode technique (SMOT)

A. and Bickmeyer, U. and Abele, D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The respiration rate of meiofauna is difficult to measure, and the response to variations in the environmental oxygen concentration has so far been mainly addressed through behavioral investigation. We investigated the effect of different oxygen concentrations on the physiology of the marine platyhelminth Macrostomum lignano. Respiration was measured using batches of 20 animals in a glass microtiter plate equipped with optical oxygen sensor spots. At higher oxygen saturations (>12 kPa), the animals showed a clear oxyconforming behavior. However, below this value, the flatworms kept respiration rates constant at 0.064 +/- 0.001 nmol O-2 l(-1) h(-1) individual(-1) down to 3 kPa P-O2, and this rate was increased by 30\% in animals that were reoxygenated after enduring a period of 1.5 h in anoxia. Physiological changes related to tissue oxygenation were assessed using live imaging techniques with different fluorophores in animals maintained in normoxic (21 kPa), hyperoxic (40 kPa) or near-anoxic (similar to 0 kPa) conditions and subjected to anoxia-reoxygenation. The pH-sensitive dyes Ageladine-A and BCECF both indicated that pH(i) under near-anoxia increases by about 0.07-0.10 units. Mitochondrial membrane potential, Delta Psi(m), was higher in anoxic and hyperoxic than in normoxic conditions (JC1 dye data). Staining with ROS-sensitive dyes - DHE for detection of superoxide anion (O-2 center dot(-)) formation and C-H(2)DFFDA for other ROS species aside from O-2 center dot(-) (H2O2, HOO center dot and ONOO-) - showed increased ROS formation following anoxia-reoxygenation treatment. Animals exposed to hyperoxic, normoxic and anoxic treatments displayed no significant differences in O-2 center dot(-) formation, whereas mitochondrial ROS formation as detected by C-H(2)DFFDA was higher after hyperoxic exposure and lowest under near-anoxia conditions compared with the normoxic control group.

Instead, phenotypic plasticity could provide a means for marine fish to cope with rapid environmental changes. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying plastic responses to environmental conditions that favour small phenotypes. Our aim was to investigate how and why European sea bass that had experienced a short episode of moderate hypoxia during their larval stage subsequently exhibited a growth depression at the juvenile stage compared with the control group. We examined whether energy was used to cover higher costs for maintenance, digestion or activity metabolisms, as a result of differing metabolic rate. The lower growth was not a consequence of lower food intake. We measured several respirometry parameters and we only found a higher specific dynamic action (SDA) duration and lower SDA amplitude in a fish phenotype with lower growth; this phenotype was also associated with a lower protein digestive capacity in the intestine. Our results contribute to the understanding of the observed decrease in growth in response to climate change. They demonstrate that the reduced growth of juvenile fishes as a consequence of an early life hypoxia eventwas not due to a change of fish aerobic scope but to a specific change in the efficiency of protein digestive functions.

Under natural conditions, all three physiological states may occur simultaneously, but the integrated response is not well understood. Adult male and female checkered gartersnakes (Thamnophis marcianus) were used to examine increments in oxygen consumption (i.e. (V)over dot(O2))and carbon dioxide production (i.e. (V)over dot(CO2)) associated with activity (Act), digestion (Dig) and post-prandial activity (Act+Dig). For females, we carried out these trials in the non-reproductive state, and also during the vitellogenic (V) and embryogenic (E) phases of a reproductive cycle. Endurance time (i.e. time to exhaustion, TTE) was recorded for all groups during Act and Act+Dig trials. Our results indicate that male and non-reproductive female T. marcianus exhibit significant increments in (V)over dot(O2) during digestion (similar to 5-fold) and activity (similar to 9-fold), and that Act+Dig results in a similar increment in (V)over dot(O2) (similar to 9- to 10-fold). During reproduction, resting (V)over dot(O2) increased by 1.6- to 1.7-fold, and peak increments during digestion were elevated by 30-50\% above non-reproductive values, but values associated with Act and Act+Dig were not significantly different from non-reproductive values. During Act+Dig, endurance time remained similar for all of the groups in the present study.

In the present study, we focused on the kidney because this is the only organ that can excrete excess water from the body in a hypoosmotic environment. We conducted a transfer experiment of bull sharks from SW to FW and performed differential gene expression analysis between the two conditions using RNA-sequencing. A search for genes upregulated in the FW-acclimated bull shark kidney indicated that the expression of the Na+-Cl- cotransporter (NCC; Slc12a3) was 10 times higher in the FW-acdimated sharks compared with that in SW sharks. In the kidney, apically located NCC was observed in the late distal tubule and in the anterior half of the collecting tubule, where basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase was also expressed, implying that these segments contribute to NaCl reabsorption from the filtrate for diluting the urine. This expression pattern was not observed in the houndshark, Triakis scyllium, which had been transferred to 30\% SW; this species cannot survive in FW environments.

To understand the differing susceptibility of desert birds to increasing temperatures, we examined thermoregulatory performance and estimated heat tolerance limits (HTLs) for three Sonoran Desert nesting bird species - Gambel's quail, mourning doves and white-winged doves. Using flow-through respirometry we measured daytime resting metabolism, evaporative water loss and real-time body temperature at air temperatures (T-air) from 30 degrees C to 66 degrees C. We found marked increases in resting metabolism at the upper critical temperature (T-uc), which was significantly lower in the quail (T-air=41.1 degrees C) than in both dove species (T-air=45.9-46.5 degrees C). Gambel's quail maintained low resting metabolic rates and low rates of evaporative water loss at their T-uc (0.71 W and 1.20 g H2O h(-1), respectively), but were more sensitive to increasing air temperature, reaching their HTL at T-air of 52 degrees C. Mourning doves and white-winged doves maintained low resting metabolic rates (0.66 and 0.94 W), but higher rates of evaporative water loss (1.91 and 2.99 g H2O h(-1)) at their T-uc and reached their HTL at T-air of 58-60 degrees C.

Diving heart rates of pinnipeds are highly variable and modulated by many factors, such as breath holding (apnea), pressure, swimming activity, temperature and even cognitive control. However, the individual effects of these factors on diving heart rate are poorly understood because of the difficulty of parsing their relative contributions in diving pinnipeds. Here, we examined the effects of apnea and external sensory inputs as autonomic drivers of bradycardia. Specifically, we hypothesized that (1) water stimulation of facial receptors would - as is the case for terrestrial mammals - enhance the dive response, (2) increasing the facial area stimulated would lead to a more intense bradycardia, and (3) cold water would elicit a more pronounced bradycardia than warm water. Three harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) and a California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) were trained to breath hold in air and with their heads submerged in a basin with variable water level and temperature. We show that bradycardia occurs during apnea without immersion. We also demonstrate that bradycardia is strengthened by both increasing the area of facial submersion and colder water. Thus, we conclude that the initiation of the dive response in pinnipeds is more strongly related to breath holding than in terrestrial mammals, but the degree of the dive response is potentiated autonomically via stimulation of facial mechano- and thermo-receptors upon submergence.",2018,10.1242/jeb.176545,221,13,NA,NA,Bradycardia; Breath hold; Facial receptors; Heart rate; Harbor seal; California sea lion
article,Cold tolerance is linked to osmoregulatory function of the hindgut in <i>Locusta migratoria</i>,"Gerber, Lucie and Overgaard, Johannes",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"There is growing evidence that maintenance of ion and water balance determines cold tolerance in many insects. The hindgut of terrestrial insects is critical for maintaining organismal homeostasis as it regulates solute and water balance of the haemolymph. Here, we used ex vivo everted gut sacs of Locusta migratoria to examine the effects of temperature (0-30 degrees C), thermal acclimation, hypoxia, and ionic and osmotic forces on bulk water and ion (Na+, K+ and Cl-) movement across the rectal epithelium. These findings were related to simultaneous in vivo measurements of water and ion balance in locusts exposed to similar temperatures. As predicted, we observed a critical inhibition of net water and ion reabsorption at low temperature that was proportional to the in vivo loss of water and ion homeostasis. Further, cold-acclimated locusts, which are known to defend ion and water balance at low temperature, were characterised by improved reabsorptive capacity at low temperature. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that transport mechanisms in the hindgut at low temperature are essential for cold tolerance. The loss of osmoregulatory capacity at low temperature was primarily caused by reduced active transport, while rectal paracellular permeability to fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran was unchanged at 0 and 30 degrees C. During cold exposure, water reabsorption was independent of major cation gradients across the epithelia, while a reduction in mucosal Cl- availability and an increase in mucosal osmolality markedly depressed water reabsorption. These findings are discussed in the context of existing knowledge and with suggestions for future physiological studies on cold acclimation and adaptation in insects.",2018,10.1242/jeb.173930,221,5,NA,jeb173930,Hypoxia; Insect; Ion flux; Paracellular permeability; Rectal sac; Water reabsorption
article,Limits to sustained energy intake. XXIX. The case of the golden hamster (<i>Mesocricetus auratus</i>),"Ohrnberger, Sarah A. and Hambly, Catherine and Speakman, John R. and Valencak, Teresa G.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Golden hamster females have the shortest known gestation period among placental mammals, and at the same time raise very large litters of up to 16 offspring, which are born in a naked and blind state and are only able to pick up food from days 12 to 14 onwards. We quantified energy metabolism and milk production in female golden hamsters raising offspring under cold (8 degrees C), normal (22 degrees C) and hot (30 degrees C) ambient temperature conditions. We monitored energy intake, subcutaneous body temperature, daily energy expenditure, litter size and pup masses over the course of lactation. Our results show that, in line with the concept of heat dissipation limitation, female golden hamsters had the largest energy intake under the coldest conditions and a significantly lower intake at 30 degrees C (partial for influence of ambient temperature: F-2.403 =5.6; P=0.004). Metabolisable energy intake as well as milk energy output showed the same pattern and were significantly different between the temperatures (partial for milk energy production: F-1.40=86.4; P<0.0001), with consistently higher subcutaneous temperatures in the reproductive females (F-1(,813)=36.77; P<0.0001) compared with baseline females. These data suggest that raising offspring in golden hamsters comes at the cost of producing large amounts of body heat up to a level constraining energy intake, similar to that observed in some laboratory mice. Notably, we observed that females seemed to adjust litter size according to their milk production, with the smallest litters (3.4 +/- 0.7 pups) being raised by hot-exposed mothers. Future research is needed to unravel the mechanism by which females assess their own milk production capabilities and how this may be linked to litter size at different ambient temperatures. Golden hamsters reach 8-10 times resting metabolic rate when raising offspring under cold conditions, which is compatible with the findings from laboratory mice and other rodents.",2018,10.1242/jeb.183749,221,21,NA,jeb183749,Resting metabolic rate; Litter size; Heat dissipation limitation; Subcutaneous temperature; Milk production
article,Autotrophic and heterotrophic responses of the coral <i>Porites lutea</i> to large amplitude internal waves,"Pacherres, Cesar O. and Schmidt, Gertraud M. and Richter, Claudio",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Large amplitude internal waves (LAIW) cause frequent and severe changes in the physico-chemical environment of Andaman Sea coral reefs and are a potentially important source of disturbance for corals. To explore the coral response to LAIW, prey capture disposition and photosynthesis were investigated in relation to changes in seawater temperature, pH, flow speed and food availability in LAIW simulation studies under controlled laboratory conditions, using Porites lutea as a model organism. Although food presence stimulated polyp expansion, we found an overriding effect of low temperature (19 degrees C) causing retraction of the coral polyps into their calices, particularly when pH was altered concomitantly. Decreases in pH alone, however, caused the expansion of the polyps. The exposure history of the colonies played a crucial role in coral responses: prior field exposure to LAIW yielded lower retraction levels than in LAIW-inexperienced corals, suggesting acclimatization. Low temperature (19 degrees C) exposure did not seem to influence the photosynthetic performance, but LAIW-experienced corals showed higher values of maximum dark-adapted quantum yield (F-v/F-m) of photosystem II than LAIW-inexperienced controls. Collectively, these data suggest that P. lutea, the dominant hermatypic coral in the Andaman Sea, can acclimatize to extreme changes in its abiotic environment by modulating its mixotrophic nutrition, through polyp expansion and potential feeding, as well as its photosynthetic efficiency.",2013,10.1242/jeb.085548,216,23,4365-4374,NA,large amplitude internal waves; Porites lutea; acclimatization; behavior

However, the molecular mechanisms involved in their acclimation to different environmental salinities have remained largely unknown. In the present study, we acclimated kuruma shrimp (Marsupenaeus japonicus) at 1.7\%, 3.4\% and 4.0\% salinities. After acclimating for 6, 12, 24 and 72 h, we determined free amino acid concentrations in their abdominal muscle, and performed RNA sequencing analysis on this muscle. The concentrations of free amino acids were clearly altered depending on salinity after 24 h of acclimation. Glutamine and alanine concentrations were markedly increased following the increase of salinity. In association with such changes, many genes related to amino acid metabolism changed their expression levels. In particular, the increase of the expression level of the gene encoding glutamate-ammonia ligase, which functions in glutamine metabolism, appeared to be associated with the increased glutamine concentration at high salinity. Furthermore, the increased alanine concentration at high salinity was likely associated with the decrease in the expression levels of the the gene encoding alanine-glyoxylate transaminase. Thus, there is a possibility that changes in the concentration of free amino acids for osmoregulation in kuruma shrimp are regulated by changes in the expression levels of genes related to amino acid metabolism.",2018,10.1242/jeb.168997,221,11,NA,jeb168997,Alanine-glyoxylate transaminase; Glutamate-ammonia ligase; RNA-seq analysis; Osmolytes; Osmoregulation
article,The effects of hypoxic bradycardia and extracellular HCO<sub>3</sub><SUP>-</SUP>/CO<sub>2</sub> on hypoxic performance in the eel heart,"Joyce, William and Simonsen, Maj and Gesser, Hans and Wang, Tobias",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"During hypoxia, fishes exhibit a characteristic hypoxic bradycardia, the functional significance of which remains debated. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that hypoxic bradycardia primarily safeguards cardiac performance. In preparations from the European eel (Anguilla anguilla), a decrease in stimulation frequency from 40 to 15 beats min(-1), which replicates hypoxic bradycardia in vivo, vastly improved cardiac performance during hypoxia in vitro. As eels display dramatic shifts in extracellular HCO3-/CO2, we further investigated the effect this has upon hypoxic cardiac performance. Elevations from 10 mmol l(-1) HCO3-/1\% CO2 to 40 mmol l(-1) HCO3-/4\% CO2 had few effects on performance; however, further, but still physiologically relevant, increases to 70 mmol l(-1) HCO3-/7\% CO2 compromised hypoxia tolerance. We revealed a four-way interaction between HCO3-/CO2, contraction frequency, hypoxia and performance over time, whereby the benefit of hypoxic bradycardia was most prolonged at 10 mmol l(-1) HCO3-/1\% CO2. Together, our data suggest that hypoxic bradycardia greatly benefits cardiac performance, but its significance may be context specific.",2016,10.1242/jeb.130971,219,3,302-305,NA,Heart rate; Myocardial hypoxia; Contractility; Anguilla anguilla
article,Freshwater adaptation in prickly sculpin (Pisces: Cottidae): intraspecific comparisons reveal evidence for water pH and Na plus concentration driving diversity in gill H plus -ATPase and ion regulation br,"Liu, Shuang and Wilson, Jonathan M. and Taylor, Eric B. and Richards, Jeffrey G.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Phenotypic divergence is a hallmark of adaptive radiation. One example involves differentiation in physiological traits involved in ion regulation among species with contrasting lifestyles and living in distinct environments. Differentiation in ion regulation and its ecological implications among populations within species are, however, less well understood. To address this knowledge gap, we collected prickly sculpin (Cottus asper) from distinct habitat types including coastal rivers connected to estuaries, coastal lakes and interior lakes, all from British Columbia, Canada. We tested for differences in plasma Na+ and Cl-, gill Na+/K+-ATPase and H+- ATPase activity and protein abundance as well as changes in body mass and arterial blood pH in fish sampled from the field and acclimated to two different freshwater conditions in the laboratory: artificial lake water (ALW) and ion-poor water (IPW). We also tested for links between environmental water chemistry and the physiological characteristics associated with ion regulation. Transfer to IPW resulted in upregulation of gill Na+/K+-ATPase and H+-ATPase activity as well as increases in gill H+-ATPase protein expression level in each habitat compared with that in the common ALW treatment. Despite the presence of population-within-habitat-type differences, significant habitat-type effects were revealed in most of the ion regulation characteristics examined under different acclimation conditions. Significantly lower plasma Cl- was detected in fish from coastal rivers than in fish from the other two habitat types during the IPW treatment, which was also significantly lower compared with that in ALW. Similarly, gill Na+/K+-ATPase activity was lower in the coastal river populations in IPW than in fish from coastal and interior lakes, which was not in accordance with the protein expression in the gill. For gill H+-ATPase, fish from interior lake populations had the highest level of activity across all habitat types under all conditions, which was related to the protein levels in the gill. The activity of gill H+-ATPase was positively correlated with the combined effect of water Na+ and pH under the ALW treatment. Our results suggest that variation in habitat may be an important factor driving differences in gill Na+/K+- ATPase and H+-ATPase activity across populations of C. asper. Further, the combined effect of water Na+ and pH may have played a key role in physiological adaptation in C. asper during post-glacial freshwater colonization and dispersal.",2022,10.1242/jeb.243500,225,18,NA,jeb243500,Fish; Cottus asper; Ion regulation; Ecological implication; Na plus; K plus -ATPase activity; H plus -ATPase activity

We studied reproductive performance in two lines of mice selected for high and low food intake (MH and ML, respectively), and known to have large differences in thermal conductance (29\% higher in the MH line at 21 degrees C). When these mice raised their natural litters, their metabolisable energy intake significantly increased over the first 13 days of lactation and then reached a plateau. At peak lactation, MH mice assimilated on average 45.3\% more energy than ML mice (222.9 +/- 7.1 and 153.4 +/- 12.5 kJ day(-1), N=49 and 24, respectively). Moreover, MH mice exported on average 62.3 kJ day(-1) more energy as milk than ML mice (118.9 +/- 5.3 and 56.6 +/- 5.4 kJ day(-1), N=subset of 32 and 21, respectively). The elevated milk production of MH mice enabled them to wean litters (65.2 +/- 2.1 g) that were on average 50.2\% heavier than litters produced by ML mothers (43.4 +/- 3.0 g), and pups that were on average 27.2\% heavier (9.9 +/- 0.2 and 7.8 +/- 0.2 g, respectively). Lactating mice in both lines had significantly longer and heavier guts compared with non-reproductive mice. However, inconsistent with the `central limit hypothesis', the ML mice had significantly longer and heavier intestines than MH mice. An experiment where the mice raised litters of the opposing line demonstrated that lactation performance was not limited by the growth capacity of offspring. Our findings are consistent with the idea that the SusEI at peak lactation is constrained by the capacity of the mothers to dissipate body heat.",2014,10.1242/jeb.103705,217,20,3718-3732,NA,Artificial selection; Cross-fostering; Daily energy expenditure; Heat dissipation limit; Milk production; Lactation

We used an integrative approach to assess the impact of elevated water temperature on two fishes of immediate conservation concern in a large estuary system, the threatened longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys) and endangered delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus). Abundances have reached record lows in California, USA, and these populations are at imminent risk of extirpation. California is currently impacted by a severe drought, resulting in high water temperatures, conditions that will become more common as a result of climate change. We exposed fish to environmentally relevant temperatures (14 degrees C and 20 degrees C) and used RNA sequencing to examine the transcriptome-wide responses to elevated water temperature in both species. Consistent with having a lower temperature tolerance, longfin smelt exhibited a pronounced cellular stress response, with an upregulation of heat shock proteins, after exposure to 20 degrees C that was not observed in delta smelt. We detected an increase in metabolic rate in delta smelt at 20 degrees C and increased expression of genes involved in metabolic processes and protein synthesis, patterns not observed in longfin smelt. Through examination of responses across multiple levels of biological organization, and by linking these responses to habitat distributions in the wild, we demonstrate that longfin smelt may be more susceptible than delta smelt to increases in temperatures, and they have little room to tolerate future warming in California. Understanding the species-specific physiological responses of sensitive species to environmental stressors is crucial for conservation efforts and managing aquatic systems globally.",2016,10.1242/jeb.134528,219,11,1705-1716,NA,Longfin smelt; Spirinchus thaleichthys; Delta smelt; Hypomesus transpacificus; Transcriptomics; Endangered fishes
