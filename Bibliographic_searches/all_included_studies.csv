"Dehydration enhances multiple physiological defense mechanisms in a desert lizard, <i>Heloderma suspectum</i>","Moeller, Karla T. and Demare, Guillaume and Davies, Scott and DeNardo, Dale F.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.150367,"The physiological challenges associated with dehydration can induce an increase in plasma glucocorticoid concentrations, a response thought to provide the mechanism for dehydration suppressing immune function. However, a comprehensive examination of the inter-relationship of dehydration, stress and immune function has not been conducted within a single species. We previously demonstrated that Gila monsters (Heloderma suspectum), which inhabit a xeric environment with a predictable seasonal drought, have enhanced measures of innate immunity when dehydrated. These results suggest that, in this species, dehydration may not induce a glucocorticoid response, but, instead, enhances physiological defense mechanisms. To explore this possibility, we examined multiple measures of innate immunity as well as initial and reactive plasma concentrations of glucocorticoids in captive and free-ranging Gila monsters at various hydration states. Our results show that, in this species, dehydration alone does not cause a substantial increase in plasma glucocorticoids, and we provide broader evidence that dehydration enhances defensive mechanisms including stress reactivity and various measures of innate immune function. These findings suggest that physiological responses to dehydration may depend heavily on an organism's ecology. More research on the effects of dehydration on the glucocorticoid response and immunity will help clarify the interactive roles they play in response to hydration challenges and whether adaptations to water-limited environments influence these interactions.",2017,220,12,2166-2174
"Distinct physiological, biochemical and morphometric adjustments in the malaria vectors <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> and <i>A</i>. <i>coluzzii</i> as means to survive dry season conditions in Burkina Faso","Hidalgo, K. and Montazeau, C. and Siaussat, D. and Braman, V. and Trabalon, M. and Simard, F. and Renault, D. and Dabire, R. K. and Mouline, K.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.174433,"Aestivation and dispersive migration are the two strategies evoked in the literature to explain the way in which malaria vectors Anopheles coluzzii and A. gambiae survive the harsh climatic conditions of the dry season in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the physiological mechanisms regulating these two strategies are unknown. In the present study, mosquito species were exposed to controlled environmental conditions mimicking the rainy and dry seasons of south western Burkina Faso. Survival strategies were studied through morphometric (wing length), ecophysiological (respiratory gas exchanges), biochemical (cuticular hydrocarbons composition) and molecular (AKH mRNA expression levels) parameters, variations of which are usually considered to be hallmarks of aestivation and dispersion mechanisms in various insects. Our results showed that ecophysiological and morphometric adjustments are made in both species to prevent water losses during the dry season. However, the usual metabolic rate modifications expected as signatures of aestivation and migration were not observed, highlighting specific and original physiological mechanisms sustaining survival in malaria mosquitoes during the dry season. Differences in epicuticular hydrocarbon composition and AKH levels of expression were found between the permanent and temporary A. coluzzii populations, illustrating the great phenotypic plasticity of this mosquito species. Altogether, our work underlines the diverse and complex pattern of changes occurring in the two mosquito species and at the population level to cope with the dry season and highlights potential targets of future control tools.",2018,221,6,NA
Divergent physiological responses in laboratory rats and mice raised at high altitude,"Jochmans-Lemoine, Alexandra and Villalpando, Gabriella and Gonzales, Marcelino and Valverde, Ibana and Soria, Rudy and Joseph, Vincent",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.112862,"Ecological studies show that mice can be found at high altitude (HA - up to 4000 m) while rats are absent at these altitudes, and there are no data to explain this discrepancy. We used adult laboratory rats and mice that have been raised for more than 30 generations in La Paz, Bolivia (3600 m), and compared their hematocrit levels, right ventricular hypertrophy (index of pulmonary hypertension) and alveolar surface area in the lungs. We also used whole-body plethysmography, indirect calorimetry and pulse oxymetry to measure ventilation, metabolic rate (O-2 consumption and CO2 production), heart rate and pulse oxymetry oxygen saturation (p(O2, sat)) under ambient conditions, and in response to exposure to sea level P-O2 (32\% O-2 = 160 mmHg for 10 min) and hypoxia (18\% and 15\% O-2 = 90 and 75 mmHg for 10 min each). The variables used for comparisons between species were corrected for body mass using standard allometric equations, and are termed mass-corrected variables. Under baseline, compared with rats, adult mice had similar levels of p(O2), sat, but lower hematocrit and hemoglobin levels, reduced right ventricular hypertrophy and higher mass-corrected alveolar surface area, tidal volume and metabolic rate. In response to sea level P-O2 and hypoxia, mice and rats had similar changes of ventilation, but metabolic rate decreased much more in hypoxia in mice, while p(O2), sat remained higher in mice. We conclude that laboratory mice and rats that have been raised at HA for > 30 generations have different physiological responses to altitude. These differences might explain the different altitude distribution observed in wild rats and mice.",2015,218,7,1035-1043
The relationship between longevity and diet is genotype dependent and sensitive to desiccation in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>,"McCracken, Andrew W. and Buckle, Eleanor and Simons, Mirre J. P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.230185,"Dietary restriction (DR) is a key focus in ageing research. Specific conditions and genotypes were recently found to negate lifespan extension by DR, questioning its universal relevance. However, the concept of dietary reaction norms explains why the effects of DR might be obscured in some situations. We tested the importance of dietary reaction norms by measuring longevity and fecundity on five diets in five genotypes, with and without water supplementation in female Drosophila melanogaster (N>25,000). We found substantial genetic variation in the response of lifespan to diet. Flies supplemented with water rescued putative desiccation stress on the richest diets, suggesting that water availability can be an experimental confound. Fecundity declined on these richest diets, but was unaffected by water, and this reduction is thus most likely to be caused by nutritional toxicity. Our results demonstrate empirically that a range of diets need to be considered to conclude an absence of the DR longevity effect.",2020,223,23,NA
The thermal dependence of Na<SUP>+</SUP> flux in isolated liver cells from ectotherms and endotherms,"Else, Paul L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.136747,"The thermal dependence (0-40 degrees C) of Na+ flux in isolated liver cells of three endotherms (mice, rat and rabbit) was compared with that of ectotherms in the form of a thermally tolerant amphibian (cane toad), a cold-water fish (rainbow trout) and a thermophilic reptile (lizard). Mammals were found to share similar high rates of Na+ flux (3.0-3.7 nmol Na+ mg(-1) protein min(-1)) at their normal body temperatures (36-39 degrees C). These Na+ flux rates were significantly greater (P<0.0004-0.0001) than those of the ectotherms, which shared similar low rates of Na+ flux (0.7-1.3 nmol Na+ mg(-1) protein min(-1)) at their very different normal acclimated body temperatures (15 degrees C for trout, 25 degrees C for toad and 37 degrees C for the lizard species). Trout, which possess highly unsaturated membranes (similar to those ofmammals), showed a Na+ flux with high thermal sensitivity at low temperatures similar to that found in mammals at higher temperatures. The thermal sensitivity of toad Na+ flux was significantly less (P<0.05-0.01) than that of rat and rabbit. Trout Na+ flux did not increase with increasing temperature much above 20 degrees C, whereas all other species measured increased their Na+ flux with increasing temperature up to 40 degrees C. In conclusion, at normal operating body temperatures, the rate of Na+ flux is much lower in ectotherms.",2016,219,14,2098-2102
Anti-diuretic activity of a CAPA neuropeptide can compromise <i>Drosophila</i> chill tolerance,"MacMillan, Heath A. and Nazal, Basma and Wali, Sahr and Yerushalmi, Gil Y. and Misyura, Lidiya and Donini, Andrew and Paluzzi, Jean-Paul",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.185884,"For insects, chilling injuries that occur in the absence of freezing are often related to a systemic loss of ion and water balance that leads to extracellular hyperkalemia, cell depolarization and the triggering of apoptotic signalling cascades. The ability of insect ionoregulatory organs (e.g. the Malpighian tubules) to maintain ion balance in the cold has been linked to improved chill tolerance, and many neuroendocrine factors are known to influence ion transport rates of these organs. Injection of micromolar doses of CAPA (an insect neuropeptide) have been previously demonstrated to improve Drosophila cold tolerance, but the mechanisms through which it impacts chill tolerance are unclear, and low doses of CAPA have been previously demonstrated to cause anti-diuresis in insects, including dipterans. Here, we provide evidence that low (femtomolar) and high (micromolar) doses of CAPA impair and improve chill tolerance, respectively, via two different effects on Malpighian tubule ion and water transport. While low doses of CAPA are anti-diuretic, reduce tubule K+ clearance rates and reduce chill tolerance, high doses facilitate K+ clearance from the haemolymph and increase chill tolerance. By quantifying CAPA peptide levels in the central nervous system, we estimated the maximum achievable hormonal titres of CAPA and found further evidence that CAPA may function as an antidiuretic hormone in Drosophila melanogaster. We provide the first evidence of a neuropeptide that can negatively affect cold tolerance in an insect and further evidence of CAPA functioning as an anti-diuretic peptide in this ubiquitous insect model.",2018,221,19,NA
"Cardiorespiratory interactions in the Pacific spiny dogfish, <i>Squalus suckleyi</i>","Acharya-Patel, Neha and Deck, Courtney A. and Milsom, William K.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.183830,"Elasmobranchs are a group of cartilaginous fish with no direct sympathetic innervation of the heart or gills. Fast cardiorespiratory regulation is controlled solely by the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system. Cardiovascular changes associated with ventilation are commonly present in the form of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and as cardiorespiratory synchrony (CRS. in which there is a 1:1 beat to breath ratio). The latter has been hypothesized to maximize oxygen uptake, coupling the pulsatile flows of blood and water in the gills. Given this, we hypothesized that CRS should be more prevalent in situations of low oxygen supply and RSA should be abolished by vagotomy. To test this, we investigated the role of the vagus nerve in mediating cardiorespiratory responses to changing environmental oxygen conditions in the elasmobranch Squalus suckleyi. Hypoxia and hyperoxia had little effect on heart rate but did alter breathing frequency and amplitude. Atropine yielded an overall tachycardia in all oxygen conditions and abolished all heart rate variability (HRV), suggesting that HRV solely reflects fluctuating vagal tonus on the heart. Regardless of the presence of atropine, hypoxia still induced an increase in ventilation rate and depth. CRS was only found during progressive hyperoxia post-atropine, when heart rate was uninhibited and ventilation was slowed owing to the increase in oxygen supply, suggesting that in S. suckleyi, CRS is an epiphenomenon and not actively regulated to maximize gas exchange efficiency.",2018,221,17,NA
Are the surface areas of the gills and body involved with changing metabolic scaling with temperature?,"Li, Ge and Lv, Xiao and Zhou, Jing and Shen, Cong and Xia, Danyang and Xie, Hang and Luo, Yiping",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.174474,"The metabolic-level boundaries (MLB) hypothesis proposes that metabolic level mediates the relative influence of surface area (SA)versus volume-related metabolic processes on the body-mass scaling of metabolic rate in organisms. The variation in the scaling of SA may affect how metabolic level affects the metabolic scaling exponent. This study aimed to determine the influence of increasing metabolic level at a higher temperature on the metabolic scaling exponent of the goldfish and determine the link between metabolic scaling exponents and SA parameters of both gills and body. The SA of gills and body and the resting metabolic rate (RMR) of the goldfish were assessed at 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C, and their mass scaling exponents were analyzed. The results showed a significantly higher RMR, with a lower scaling exponent, in the goldfish at a higher temperature. The SA of the gills and the total SA of the fish (TSA) were reduced with the increasing temperature. The scaling exponent of RMR (b(RMR)) tended to be close to that of the TSA at a higher temperature. This suggests that temperature positively affects metabolic level but negatively affects b(RMR). The findings support the MLB hypothesis. The lower scaling exponent at a higher temperature can be alternatively explained as follows: the higher viscosity of cold water impedes respiratory ventilation and oxygen uptake and reduces metabolic rate more in smaller individuals than in larger individuals at lower temperature, thus resulting in a negative association between temperature and b(RMR).",2018,221,8,NA
"Hypoxia tolerance is unrelated to swimming metabolism of wild, juvenile striped bass (<i>Morone saxatilis</i>)","Kraskura, Krista and Nelson, Jay A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.217125,"Juvenile striped bass residing in Chesapeake Bay are likely to encounter hypoxia that could affect their metabolism and performance. The ecological success of this economically valuable species may depend on their ability to tolerate hypoxia and perform fitness-dependent activities in hypoxic waters. We tested whether there is a link between hypoxia tolerance (HT) and oxygen consumption rate (M-O2) of juvenile striped bass measured while swimming in normoxic and hypoxic water, and to identify the interindividual variation and repeatability of these measurements. HT (loss of equilibrium) of fish (N=18) was measured twice collectively, 11 weeks apart, between which M-O2 was measured individually for each fish while swimming in low flow (10.2 cm s(-1)) and high flow (similar to 67\% of critical swimming speed, U-crit) under normoxia and hypoxia. Both HT and M-O2 varied substantially among individuals. HT increased across 11 weeks while the rank order of individual HT was significantly repeatable. Similarly, M-O2 increased in fish swimming at high flow in a repeatable fashion, but only within a given level of oxygenation. M-O2 was significantly lower when fish were swimming against high flow under hypoxia. There were no clear relationships between HT and M-O2 while fish were swimming under any conditions. Only the magnitude of increase in HT over 11 weeks and an individual's M-O2 under low flow were correlated. The results suggest that responses to the interacting stressors of hypoxia and exercise vary among individuals, and that HT and change in HT are not simple functions of aerobic metabolic rate.",2020,223,5,NA
Acute stress and restricted diet reduce bill-mediated heat dissipation in the song sparrow (<i>Melospiza melodia</i>): implications for optimal thermoregulation,"Zuluaga, Juan D. and Danner, Raymond M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.245316,"We used thermal imaging to show that two environmental factors acute stress and diet - influence thermoregulatory performance of a known thermal window, the avian bill. The bill plays important roles in thermoregulation and water balance. Given that heat loss through the bill is adjustable through vasoconstriction and vasodilation, and acute stress can cause vasoconstriction in peripheral body surfaces, we hypothesized that stress may influence the bill's role as a thermal window. We further hypothesized that diet influences heat dissipation from the bill, given that body condition influences the surface temperature of another body region (the eye region). We measured the surface temperature of the bills of song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) before, during and after handling by an observer at 37 degrees C ambient temperature. We fed five birds a restricted diet intended to maintain body mass typical of wild birds, and we fed six birds an unrestricted diet for 5 months prior to experiments. Acute stress caused a decrease in the surface temperature of the bill, resulting in a 32.4\% decrease in heat dissipation immediately following acute stress, before recovering over approximately 2.3 min. The initial reduction and subsequent recovery provide partial support for the hemoprotective and thermoprotective hypotheses, which predict a reduction or increase in peripheral blood flow, respectively. Birds with unrestricted diets had larger bills and dissipated more heat, indicating that diet and body condition influence bill-mediated heat dissipation and thermoregulation. These results indicate that stress-induced vascular changes and diet can influence mechanisms of heat loss and potentially inhibit optimal thermoregulation.",2023,226,3,NA
Contrasting strategies of osmotic and ionic regulation in freshwater crabs and shrimps: gene expression of gill ion transporters,"Mantovani, Milene and McNamara, John Campbell",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.233890,"Owing to their extraordinary niche diversity, the Crustacea are ideal for comprehending the evolution of osmoregulation. The processes that effect systemic hydro-electrolytic homeostasis maintain hemolymph ionic composition via membrane transporters located in highly specialized gill ionocytes. We evaluated physiological and molecular hyper- and hypo-osmoregulatory mechanisms in two phylogenetically distant, freshwater crustaceans, the crab Dilocarcinus pagei and the shrimp Macrobrachium jelskii, when osmotically challenged for up to 10 days. When in distilled water, D. pagei survived without mortality, hemolymph osmolality and {[}Cl-] increased briefly, stabilizing at initial values, while {[}Na+] decreased continually. Expression of gill V-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), Na+/K+-ATPase and Na+/K+/2Cl(-) symporter genes was unchanged. In M. jelskii, hemolymph osmolality, {[}Cl-] and {[}Na+] decreased continually for 12 h, the shrimps surviving only around 15-24 h exposure. Gill transporter gene expression increased 2- to 5-fold. After 10 days exposure to brackish water (25 parts per thousand S), D. pagei was isosmotic, iso-chloremic and iso-natriuremic. Gill V-ATPase expression decreased while Na+/K+-ATPase and Na+/K+/2Cl(-) symporter expression was unchanged. In M. jelskii (20 parts per thousand S), hemolymph was hypo-regulated, particularly {[}Cl-]. Transporter expression initially increased 3- to 12-fold, declining to control values. Gil V-ATPase expression underlies the ability of D. pagei to survive in fresh water while V-ATPase, Na+/K+-ATPase and Na+/K+/2Cl(-) symporter expression enables M. jelskii to confront hyper/ hypo-osmotic challenges. These findings reveal divergent responses in two unrelated crustaceans inhabiting a similar osmotic niche. While D. pagei does not secrete salt, tolerating elevated cellular isosmoticity, M. jelskii exhibits clear hypo-osmoregulatory ability. Each species has evolved distinct strategies at the transcriptional and systemic levels during its adaptation to fresh water.",2021,224,3,NA
"Oxidative ecology of paternal care in wild smallmouth bass, <i>Micropterus dolomieu</i>","Elmer, Laura K. and O'Connor, Constance M. and Philipp, David P. and Van der Kraak, Glen and Gilmour, Kathleen M. and Willmore, William G. and Barthel, Brandon L. and Cooke, Steven J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.153775,"Physiologically, oxidative stress is considered a homeostatic imbalance between reactive oxygen species production and absorption. From an ecological perspective, oxidative stress may serve as an important constraint to life-history traits, such as lifespan, reproduction and the immune system, and is gaining interest as a potential mechanism underlying life-history trade-offs. Of late, there has been much interest in understanding the role of oxidative stress in the ecology of wild animals, particularly during challenging periods such as reproduction. Here, we used a long-term study population of a fish with sole-male parental care, the smallmouth bass, Micropterus dolomieu, to examine the associations among oxidative stress indicators and life-history variables in nest-guarding males. In addition, we investigated the potential role of oxidative stress as a physiological mediator of the life-history trade-off decision of paternal smallmouth bass to stay with or abandon their brood. We found that oxidative stress was significantly related to the life history of paternal smallmouth bass, such that older, larger fish with greater reproductive experience and larger broods nesting in cooler water temperatures had lower levels of oxidative stress. However, we found no significant correlation between oxidative stress and nesting success, suggesting that oxidative stress may not be involved in the decision of male smallmouth bass to abandon their brood. Wild fish have been relatively understudied in the emerging field of oxidative ecology, and this study makes noteworthy contributions by revealing interesting connections between the life histories of paternal smallmouth bass and their oxidative status.",2017,220,10,1905-1914
Fatty acid oxidation: a neglected factor in understanding the adjustment of mitochondrial function to cold temperatures,"Mast, Heather and Holody, Claudia D. and Lemieux, Helene",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.244934,"For ectothermic species, adaptation to thermal changes is of critical importance. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which leverages multiple electron pathways to produce energy needed for survival, is among the crucial metabolic processes impacted by temperature. Our aim in this study was to identify how changes in temperature affect the less-studied electron transferring flavoprotein pathway, fed by fatty acid substrates. We used the planarian Dugesia tignna, acclimated for 4 weeks at 10 degrees C (cold acclimated) or 20 degrees C (normothermic). Respirometry experiments were conducted at an assay temperature of either 10 or 20 degrees C to study specific states of the OXPHOS process using the fatty acid substrates palmitoylcarnitine (long chain), octanoylcarnitine (medium chain) or acetylcarnitine (short chain). Following cold acclimation, octanoylcarnitine exhibited increases in both the OXPHOS and electron transfer (ET, non-coupled) states, indicating that the pathway involved in medium-chain length fatty acids adjusts to cold temperatures. Acetylcarnitine only showed an increase in the OXPHOS state as a result of cold acclimation, but not in the ET state, indicative of a change in phosphorylation system capacity rather than fatty acid beta-oxidation. Palmitoylcarnitine oxidation was unaffected. Our results show that cold acclimation in D. tignna caused a specific adjustment in the capacity to metabolize medium-chain fatty acids rather than an adjustment in the activity of the enzymes carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase, carnitine acyltransferase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-2. Here, we provide novel evidence of the alterations in fatty acid beta-oxidation during cold acclimation in D. tignna.",2022,225,21,NA
Diet mediates thermal performance traits: implications for marine ectotherms,"Hardison, Emily A. and Kraskura, Krista and Van Wert, Jacey and Nguyen, Tina and Eliason, Erika J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.242846,"Thermal acclimation is a key process enabling ectotherms to cope with temperature change. To undergo a successful acclimation response, ectotherms require energy and nutritional building blocks obtained from their diet. However, diet is often overlooked as a factor that can alter acclimation responses. Using a temperate omnivorous fish, opaleye (Gireila nigricans), as a model system, we tested the hypotheses that (1) diet can impact the magnitude of thermal acclimation responses and (2) traits vary in their sensitivity to both temperature acclimation and diet. We fed opaleye a simple omnivorous diet (ad libitum Aftemia sp. and Ulva sp.) or a carnivorous diet (ad libitum Artemia sp.) at two ecologically relevant temperatures (12 and 20 degrees C) and measured a suite of whole-animal (growth, sprint speed, metabolism), organ (cardiac thermal tolerance) and cellular-level traits (oxidative stress, glycolytic capacity). When opaleye were offered two diet options compared with one, they had reduced cardiovascular thermal performance and higher standard metabolic rate under conditions representative of the maximal seasonal temperature the population experiences (20 degrees C). Further, sprint speed and absolute aerobic scope were insensitive to diet and temperature, while growth was highly sensitive to temperature but not diet, and standard metabolic rate and maximum heart rate were sensitive to both diet and temperature. Our results reveal that diet influences thermal performance in trait-specific ways, which could create diet trade-offs for generalist ectotherms living in thermally variable environments. Ectotherms that alter their diet may be able to regulate their performance at different environmental temperatures.",2021,224,21,NA
Distinct physiological strategies are used to cope with constant hypoxia and intermittent hypoxia in killifish (<i>Fundulus heteroclitus</i>),"Borowiec, Brittney G. and Darcy, Kimberly L. and Gillette, Danielle M. and Scott, Graham R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.114579,"Many fish encounter hypoxia on a daily cycle, but the physiological effects of intermittent hypoxia are poorly understood. We investigated whether acclimation to constant (sustained) hypoxia or to intermittent diel cycles of nocturnal hypoxia (12 h normoxia: 12 h hypoxia) had distinct effects on hypoxia tolerance or on several determinants of O-2 transport and O-2 utilization in estuarine killifish. Adult killifish were acclimated to normoxia, constant hypoxia, or intermittent hypoxia for 7 or 28 days in brackish water (4 ppt). Acclimation to both hypoxia patterns led to comparable reductions in critical O-2 tension and resting O-2 consumption rate, but only constant hypoxia reduced the O-2 tension at loss of equilibrium. Constant (but not intermittent) hypoxia decreased filament length and the proportion of seawater-type mitochondrion-rich cells in the gills (which may reduce ion loss and the associated costs of active ion uptake), increased blood haemoglobin content, and reduced the abundance of oxidative fibres in the swimming muscle. In contrast, only intermittent hypoxia augmented the oxidative and gluconeogenic enzyme activities in the liver and increased the capillarity of glycolytic muscle, each of which should facilitate recovery between hypoxia bouts. Neither exposure pattern affected muscle myoglobin content or the activities of metabolic enzymes in the brain or heart, but intermittent hypoxia increased brain mass. We conclude that the pattern of hypoxia exposure has an important influence on the mechanisms of acclimation, and that the optimal strategies used to cope with intermittent hypoxia may be distinct from those for coping with constant hypoxia.",2015,218,8,1198-1211
"The importance of thermal history: costs and benefits of heat exposure in a tropical, rocky shore oyster","Giomi, Folco and Mandaglio, Concetta and Ganmanee, Monthon and Han, Guo-Dong and Dong, Yun-Wei and Williams, Gray A. and Sara, Gianluca",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.128892,"Although thermal performance is widely recognised to be pivotal in determining species' distributions, assessment of this performance is often based on laboratory-acclimated individuals, neglecting their proximate thermal history. The thermal history of a species sums the evolutionary history and, importantly, the thermal events recently experienced by individuals, including short-term acclimation to environmental variations. Thermal history is perhaps of greatest importance for species inhabiting thermally challenging environments and therefore assumed to be living close to their thermal limits, such as in the tropics. To test the importance of thermal history, the responses of the tropical oyster Isognomon nucleus to short-term differences in thermal environments were investigated. Critical and lethal temperatures and oxygen consumption were improved in oysters that previously experienced elevated air temperatures, and were associated with an enhanced heat shock response, indicating that recent thermal history affects physiological performance as well as inducing short-term acclimation to acute conditions. These responses were, however, associated with trade-offs in feeding activity, with oysters that experienced elevated temperatures showing reduced energy gain. Recent thermal history, therefore, seems to rapidly invoke physiological mechanisms that enhance survival of short-term thermal challenge but also longer term climatic changes and consequently needs to be incorporated into assessments of species' thermal performances.",2016,219,5,686-694
Phenotypic flexibility in metabolic adjustments and digestive function in white-shouldered starlings: responses to short-term temperature acclimation,"Li, Ming and Xu, Mingru and Wang, Jing and Yao, Yaqi and Zhang, Xinhao and Liu, Jinsong",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.246214,"Changing the intrinsic rate of metabolic heat production is the main adaptive strategy for small birds to cope with different ambient temperatures. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the small passerine the white-shouldered starling (Sturnus sinensis) can modulate basal metabolism under temperature acclimation by changing the morphological, physiological and biochemical state of its tissues and organs. We measured the effects of temperature on body mass, basal metabolic rate (BMR), wet mass of various internal organs, state 4 respiration (S4R) and cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) activity in the pectoral muscle and organs, metabolites in the pectoral muscle, energy intake, histological dynamics and the activity of duodenal digestive enzymes. Warm acclimation decreased BMR to a greater extent than cold acclimation. At the organ level, birds in the cold-acclimated group had significantly heavier intestines but significantly lighter pectoral muscles. At the cellular level, birds in the cold-acclimated group showed significantly higher S4R in the liver and heart and CCO activity in the liver and kidney at both the mass -specific and whole-organ levels. A metabolomic analysis of the pectoral tissue revealed significantly higher lipid decomposition, amino acid degradation, ATP hydrolysis, and GTP and biotin synthesis in cold-acclimated birds. Acclimation to cold significantly increased the gross energy intake (GEI), feces energy (FE) and digestive energy intake (DEI) but significantly decreased the digestive efficiency of these birds. Furthermore, cold-acclimated birds had a higher maltase activity and longer villi in the duodenum. Taken together, these data show that white-shouldered starlings exhibit high phenotypic flexibility in metabolic adjustments and digestive function under temperature acclimation, consistent with the notion that small birds cope with the energy challenges presented by a cold environment by modulating tissue function in a way that would affect BMR.",2024,227,1,NA
Tissue-dependent variation of hydrogen sulfide homeostasis in anoxic freshwater turtles,"Jensen, Birgitte and Pardue, Sibile and Kevil, Christopher G. and Fago, Angela",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.203976,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) controls numerous physiological responses. To understand its proposed role in metabolic suppression, we measured free H2S and bound sulfane sulfur (BSS) in tissues of the freshwater turtle Trachemys scripta elegans, a species undergoing strong metabolic suppression when cold and anoxic. In warm normoxic turtles, free H2S was higher in red blood cells (RBCs) and kidney (similar to 9-10 mu mol l(-1)) than in brain, liver and lung (similar to 1-2 mu mol l(-1)). These values overall aligned with the tissue H2S-generating enzymatic activity. BSS levels were similar in all tissues (similar to 0.5 mu mol l(-1)) but similar to 100-fold higher in RBCs, which have a high thiol content, suggesting that RBCs function as a circulating H2S reservoir. Cold acclimation caused significant changes in free and bound H2S in liver, brain and RBCs, but anoxia had no further effect, except in the brain. These results show tissue-dependent sulfide signaling with a potential role in brain metabolic suppression during anoxia in turtles.",2019,222,12,NA
Chronic warm exposure impairs growth performance and reduces thermal safety margins in the common triplefin fish (<i>Forsterygion lapillum</i>),"McArley, Tristan J. and Hickey, Anthony J. R. and Herbert, Neill A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.162099,"Intertidal fish species face gradual chronic changes in temperature and greater extremes of acute thermal exposure through climate-induced warming. As sea temperatures rise, it has been proposed that whole-animal performance will be impaired through oxygen and capacity limited thermal tolerance {[}OCLTT; reduced aerobic metabolic scope (MS)] and, on acute exposure to high temperatures, thermal safety margins may be reduced because of constrained acclimation capacity of upper thermal limits. Using the New Zealand triplefin fish (Forsterygion lapillum), this study addressed how performance in terms of growth and metabolism (MS) and upper thermal tolerance limits would be affected by chronic exposure to elevated temperature. Growth was measured in fish acclimated (12 weeks) to present and predicted future temperatures and metabolic rates were then determined in fish at acclimation temperatures and with acute thermal ramping. In agreement with the OCLTT hypothesis, chronic exposure to elevated temperature significantly reduced growth performance and MS. However, despite the prospect of impaired growth performance under warmer future summertime conditions, an annual growth model revealed that elevated temperatures may only shift the timing of high growth potential and not the overall annual growth rate. While the upper thermal tolerance (i.e. critical thermal maxima) increased with exposure to warmer temperatures and was associated with depressed metabolic rates during acute thermal ramping, upper thermal tolerance did not differ between present and predicted future summertime temperatures. This suggests that warming may progressively decrease thermal safety margins for hardy generalist species and could limit the available habitat range of intertidal populations.",2017,220,19,3527-3535
Tropical flatback turtle (<i>Natator depressus</i>) embryos are resilient to the heat of climate change,"Howard, Robert and Bell, Ian and Pike, David A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.118778,"Climate change is threatening reproduction of many ectotherms by increasing nest temperatures, potentially making it more difficult for females to locate nest sites that provide suitable incubation regimes during embryonic development. Elevated nest temperatures could increase the incidence of embryonic mortality and/or maladaptive phenotypes. We investigated whether elevated nest temperatures reduce hatching success in tropical flatback turtles (Natator depressus) nesting in the Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia. Egg incubation treatments began at 29.5 degrees C and progressively increased in temperature throughout incubation, up to maxima of 31, 32, 33, 34 and 35 degrees C. Elevated nest temperatures did not reduce hatching success or hatchling body size relative to control temperatures (29.5 degrees C), but did speed up embryonic development. A combination of sudden exposure to high temperatures during the first 2 weeks of incubation (>36 degrees C for 48 h) and prolonged warming throughout incubation (from 29.5-35 degrees C) did not reduce hatching success. We also recorded an unusually high pivotal sex-determining temperature in this flatback turtle population relative to other sea turtle populations: an equal ratio of male and female hatchlings is produced at similar to 30.4 degrees C. This adaptation may allow some flatback turtle populations to continue producing large numbers of hatchlings of both sexes under the most extreme climate change scenarios. Some tropical populations of nesting flatbacks may possess important adaptations to high-temperature incubation environments, which are not found in more southerly temperate populations.",2015,218,20,3330-3335
"Mitochondrial responses towards intermittent heat shocks in the eastern oyster, <i>Crassostrea virginica</i>","Hraoui, Georges and Breton, Sophie and Miron, Gilles and Boudreau, Luc H. and Hunter-Manseau, Florence and Pichaud, Nicolas",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.242745,"Frequent heat waves caused by climate change can give rise to physiological stress in many animals, particularly in sessile ectotherms such as bivalves. Most studies characterizing thermal stress in bivalves focus on evaluating the responses to a single stress event. This does not accurately reflect the reality faced by bivalves, which are often subject to intermittent heat waves. Here, we investigated the effect of intermittent heat stress on mitochondrial functions of the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, which play a key role in setting the thermal tolerance of ectotherms. Specifically, we measured changes in mitochondrial oxygen consumption and H2O2 emission rates before, during and after intermittent 7.5 degrees C heat shocks in oysters acclimated to 15 and 22.5 degrees C. Our results showed that oxygen consumption was impaired following the first heat shock at both acclimation temperatures. After the second heat shock, results for oysters acclimated to 15 degrees C indicated a return to normal. However, oysters acclimated to 22.5 degrees C struggled more with the compounding effects of intermittent heat shocks as denoted by an increased contribution of FAD-linked substrates to mitochondrial respiration as well as high levels of H2O2 emission rates. However, both acclimated populations showed signs of potential recovery 10 days after the second heat shock, reflecting a surprising resilience to heat waves by C. virginica. Thus, this study highlights the important role of acclimation in the oyster's capacity to weather intermittent heat shock.",2021,224,17,NA
Plasticity in parental effects confers rapid larval thermal tolerance in the estuarine anemone <i>Nematostella vectensis</i>,"Rivera, Hanny E. and Chen, Cheng-Yi and Gibson, Matthew C. and Tarrant, Ann M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.236745,"Parental effects can prepare offspring for different environments and facilitate survival across generations. We exposed parental populations of the estuarine anemone, Nematostella vectensis, from Massachusetts to elevated temperatures and quantified larval mortality across a temperature gradient. We found that parental exposure to elevated temperatures resulted in a consistent increase in larval thermal tolerance, as measured by the temperature at which 50\% of larvae die (LT50), with a mean increase in LT50 of 0.3 degrees C. Larvae from subsequent spawns returned to baseline thermal thresholds when parents were returned to normal temperatures, indicating plasticity in these parental effects. Histological analyses of gametogenesis in females suggested that these dynamic shifts in larval thermal tolerance may be facilitated by maternal effects in non-overlapping gametic cohorts. We also compared larvae from North Carolina (a genetically distinct population with higher baseline thermal tolerance) and Massachusetts parents, and observed that larvae from heat-exposed Massachusetts parents had thermal thresholds comparable to those of larvae from unexposed North Carolina parents. North Carolina parents also increased larval thermal tolerance under the same high-temperature regime, suggesting that plasticity in parental effects is an inherent trait for N. vectensis. Overall, we find that larval thermal tolerance in N. vectensis shows a strong genetic basis and can be modulated by parental effects. Further understanding of the mechanisms behind these shifts can elucidate the fate of thermally sensitive ectotherms in a rapidly changing thermal environment.",2021,224,5,NA
Both maternal and embryonic exposure to mild hypoxia influence embryonic development of the intertidal gastropod <i>Littorina littorea</i>,"McCoy, James C. S. and Spicer, I, John and Tills, Oliver and Rundle, Simon D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.221895,"There is growing evidence that maternal exposure to environmental stressors can alter offspring phenotype and increase fitness. Here, we investigate the relative and combined effects of maternal and developmental exposure to mild hypoxia (65 and 74\% air saturation, respectively) on the growth and development of embryos of the marine gastropod Littorina littorea. Differences in embryo morphological traits were driven by the developmental environment, whereas the maternal environment and interactive effects of maternal and developmental environment were the main driver of differences in the timing of developmental events. While developmental exposure to mild hypoxia significantly increased the area of an important respiratory organ, the velum, it significantly delayed hatching of veliger larvae and reduced their size at hatching and overall survival. Maternal exposure had a significant effect on these traits, and interacted with developmental exposure to influence the time of appearance of morphological characters, suggesting that both are important in affecting developmental trajectories. A comparison between embryos that successfully hatched and those that died in mild hypoxia revealed that survivors exhibited hypertrophy in the velum and associated preoral cilia, suggesting that these traits are linked with survival in low-oxygen environments. We conclude that both maternal and developmental environments shape offspring phenotype in a species with a complex developmental life history, and that plasticity in embryo morphology arising from exposure to even small reductions in oxygen tensions affects the hatching success of these embryos.",2020,223,20,NA

Clay and Van Leeuwen, Travis E. and Brownscombe, Jacob W. and Cooke, Steven J. and Eliason, Erika J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.209437,"Species invasions threaten global biodiversity, and physiological characteristics may determine their impact. Specific dynamic action (SDA; the increase in metabolic rate associated with feeding and digestion) is one such characteristic, strongly influencing an animal's energy budget and feeding ecology. We investigated the relationship between SDA, scope for activity, metabolic phenotype, temperature and feeding frequency in lionfish (Pterois spp.), which are invasive to western Atlantic marine ecosystems. Intermittent-flow respirometry was used to determine SDA, scope for activity and metabolic phenotype at 26 degrees C and 32 degrees C. Maximum metabolic rate occurred during digestion, as opposed to exhaustive exercise, as in more athletic species. SDA and its duration (SDA(dur)) were 30\% and 45\% lower at 32 degrees C than at 26 degrees C, respectively, and lionfish ate 42\% more at 32 degrees C. Despite a 32\% decline in scope for activity from 26 degrees C to 32 degrees C, aerobic scope may have increased by 24\%, as there was a higher range between standard metabolic rate (SMR) and peak SDA (SDA(peak); the maximum postprandial metabolic rate). Individuals with high SMR and low scope for activity phenotypes had a less costly SDA and shorter SDA(dur) but a higher SDA(peak). Feeding frequently had a lower and more consistent cost than consuming a single meal, but increased SDA(peak). These findings demonstrate that: (1) lionfish are robust physiological performers in terms of SDA and possibly aerobic scope at temperatures approaching their thermal maximum, (2) lionfish may consume more prey as oceans warm with climate change, and (3) metabolic phenotype and feeding frequency may be important mediators of feeding ecology in fish.",2019,222,19,NA
Hypoxia impairs blood glucose homeostasis in naked mole-rat adult subordinates but not queens,"Ojaghi, Mohammad and Pamenter, Matthew E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.247537,"Naked mole -rats (NMRs) are among the most hypoxia-tolerant mammals and metabolize only carbohydrates in hypoxia. Glucose is the primary building block of dietary carbohydrates, but how blood glucose is regulated during hypoxia has not been explored in NMRs. We hypothesized that NMRs mobilize glucose stores to support anaerobic energy metabolism in hypoxia. To test this, we treated newborn, juvenile and adult (subordinate and queen) NMRs in normoxia (21\% O 2 ) or hypoxia (7, 5 or 3\% O 2 ), while measuring metabolic rate, body temperature and blood [}glucose]. We also challenged animals with glucose, insulin or insulin -like growth factor1 (IGF-1) injections and measured the rate of glucose clearance in normoxia and hypoxia. We found that: (1) blood {[}glucose] increases in moderate hypoxia in queens and pups, but only in severe hypoxia in adult subordinates and juveniles; (2) glucose tolerance is similar between developmental stages in normoxia, but glucose clearance times are 2- to 3 -fold longer in juveniles and subordinates than in queens or pups in hypoxia; and (3) reoxygenation accelerates glucose clearance in hypoxic subordinate adults. Mechanistically, (4) insulin and IGF-1 reduce blood {[}glucose] in subordinates in both normoxia but only IGF-1 impacts blood {[}glucose] in hypoxic queens. Our results indicate that insulin signaling is impaired by hypoxia in NMRs, but that queens utilize IGF-1 to overcome this limitation and effectively regulate blood glucose in hypoxia. This suggests that sexual maturation impacts blood glucose handling in hypoxic NMR queens, which may allow queens to spend longer periods of time in hypoxic nest chambers.",2024,227,10,NA
Effects of both cold and heat stress on the liver of the giant spiny frog (<i>Quasipaa spinosa</i>): stress response and histological changes,"Liu, Ze-Peng and Gu, Wen-Bin and Tu, Dan-Dan and Zhu, Qi-Hui and Zhou, Yi-Lian and Wang, Cong and Wang, Lan-Zhi and Shu, Miao-An",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.186379,"Ambient temperature-associated stress can affect normal physiological functions in ectotherms. To assess the effects of cold or heat stress on amphibians, giant spiny frogs (Quasipaa spinosa) were acclimated at 22 degrees C followed by exposure to 5 degrees C or 30 degrees C for 0, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h, respectively. Histological alterations, apoptotic index, generation of mitochondria! reactive oxygen species (ROS), antioxidant activity indices and stress-response gene expression in frog livers were subsequently determined. Results showed that many fat droplets appeared after 12 h of heat stress and the percentage of melanomacrophage centres significantly changed after 48 h at both stress conditions. Furthermore, the mitochondrial ROS levels were elevated in a time-dependent manner up to 6 h and 12 h in the cold and heat stress groups, respectively. The activities of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase were successively increased with increasing periods of cold or heat exposure, and their gene expression levels showed similar changes in both stress conditions. Most tested heat shock protein (HSP) genes were sensitive to temperature exposure, and the expression profiles of most apoptosis-related genes was significantly upregulated at 3 and 48 h under cold and heat stress, respectively. Apoptotic index at 48 h under cold stress was significantly higher than that under heat stress. Notably, lipid droplets, HSP30, HSP70 and HSP110 might be suitable bioindicators of heat stress. The results of these alterations at physiological, biochemical and molecular levels might contribute to a better understanding of the stress response of Q. spinosa, and perhaps amphibians more generally, under thermal stress.",2018,221,21,NA
Seasonal variation in the thermal responses to changing environmental temperature in the world's northernmost land bird,"Nord, Andreas and Folkow, Lars P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.171124,"Arctic homeotherms counter challenges at high latitudes using a combination of seasonal adjustments in pelage/plumage, fat deposition and intricate thermoregulatory adaptations. However, there are still gaps in our understanding of their thermal responses to cold, particularly in Arctic birds. Here, we have studied the potential use of local heterothermy (i.e. tissue cooling that can contribute to significantly lower heat loss rate) in Svalbard ptarmigan (Lagopus muta hyperborea) - the world's northernmost land bird. We exposed birds kept under simulated Svalbard photoperiod to low ambient temperatures (T-a; between 0 and -30 degrees C) during three seasons (early winter, late winter, summer), whilst recording resting metabolic rate (RMR), core temperature (T-c) and several cutaneous temperatures. Leg skin temperature varied the most, but still only by up to similar to 15 degrees C, whereas body trunk skin temperature changed < 1 degrees C when T-a decreased from 0 to -30 degrees C. At the same time, Tc increased by 0.9 degrees C, concomitant with increased RMR. This was probably driven by the triggering of cerebral thermosensors in response to cooling of the poorly insulated head, the skin of which was 5.4 degrees C colder at -30 degrees C than at 0 degrees C. Thermal conductance in winter was higher in yearlings, probably because they were time/resource constrained from acquiring a high-quality plumage and sufficient fat reserves as a result of concomitant body growth. In conclusion, Svalbard ptarmigan do not employ extensive local heterothermy for cold protection but instead rely on efficient thermogenesis combined with excellent body insulation. Hence, cold defence in the world's northernmost land bird is not mechanistically much different from that of its lower latitude relatives.",2018,221,1,NA
Aerobic scope increases throughout an ecologically relevant temperature range in coho salmon,"Raby, Graham D. and Casselman, Matthew T. and Cooke, Steven J. and Hinch, Scott G. and Farrell, Anthony P. and Clark, Timothy D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.137166,"Aerobic scope (AS) has been proposed as a functional measurement that can be used to make predictions about the thermal niche of aquatic ectotherms and hence potential fitness outcomes under future warming scenarios. Some salmonid species and populations, for example, have been reported to exhibit different thermal profiles for their AS curves such that AS peaks around the modal river temperature encountered during the upriver spawning migration, suggesting species-and population-level adaptations to river temperature regimes. Interestingly, some other salmonid species and populations have been reported to exhibit AS curves that maintain an upwards trajectory throughout the ecologically relevant temperature range rather than peaking at a modal temperature. To shed further light on this apparent dichotomy, we used adult coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) to test the prediction that peak AS coincides with population-specific, historically experienced river temperatures. We assessed AS at 10 and 15 degrees C, which represent a typical river migration temperature and the upper limit of the historically experienced temperature range, respectively. We also examined published data on AS in juvenile coho salmon in relation to new temperature data measured from their freshwater rearing environments. In both cases, AS was either maintained or increased modestly throughout the range of ecologically relevant temperatures. In light of existing evidence and the new data presented here, we suggest that when attempting to understand thermal optima for Pacific salmon and other species across life stages, AS is a useful metric of oxygen transport capacity but other thermally sensitive physiological indices of performance and fitness should be considered in concert.",2016,219,12,1922-1931
Thermal dependence of cardiac function in arctic fish: implications of a warming world,"Franklin, Craig.

Here, we examined the thermal sensitivity of cardiorespiratory performance for three closely related species of sculpins that inhabit the Arctic waters, two of which, Gymnocanthus tricuspis and Myoxocephalus scorpioides, have adapted to a restricted range within the Arctic, whereas the third species, Myoxocephalus scorpius, has a wider distribution. We tested the hypothesis that the fish restricted to Arctic cold waters would show reduced cardiorespiratory scope in response to an increase in temperature, as compared with the more eurythermal M. scorpius. As expected from their biogeography, M. scorpioides and G. tricuspis maximised cardiorespiratory performance at temperatures between 1 and 4 degrees C, whereas M. scorpius maximised performance over a wider range of temperatures (1-10 degrees C). Furthermore, factorial scope for cardiac output collapsed at elevated temperature for the two high-latitude species, negatively impacting their ability to support aerobically driven metabolic processes. Consequently, these results concurred with our hypothesis, suggesting that the sculpin species restricted to the Arctic are likely to be negatively impacted by increases in ocean temperatures.",2013,216,22,4251-4255

After tag implantation under anaesthesia, heart rate (f(H)) required 60 h to recover to a stable value in a holding tank. Subsequently, when undisturbed under control conditions (normoxia, 21 degrees C), mean f(H) was always significantly lower in the tank than in the respirometers. In progressive hypoxia (100\% to 15\% oxygen saturation), mean f(H) in the tank was significantly lower than in the respirometers at oxygen levels down to 40\%, with significant bradycardia in both holding conditions below this level. Simultaneous logging of tri-axial body acceleration revealed that spontaneous activity, inferred as the variance of external acceleration (VAR(m)), was low and invariant in hypoxia. Warming (21 to 31 degrees C) caused progressive tachycardia with no differences in f(H) between holding conditions. Mean VAR(m) was, however, significantly higher in the tank during warming, with a positive relationship between VAR(m) and f(H) across all temperatures. Therefore, spontaneous activity contributed to raising f(H) of fish in the tank during warming. Mean f(H) in respirometers had a highly significant linear relationship with mean rates of oxygen uptake, considering data from hypoxia and warming together. The high f(H) of confined seabream indicates that respirometry techniques may bias estimates of metabolic traits in some fishes, and that biologging on free-swimming fish will provide more reliable insight into cardiac and behavioural responses to environmental stressors by fish in their natural environment.",2021,224,14,NA

We studied plastic changes in organ mass and volume involved in aerobic respiration in response to acclimation to high altitude, and how those changes are matched with aerobic performance measured by (V) over dot(O2,max). Adult deer mice born and raised at 340 m were acclimated at either 340 or 3800 m for a period of 9 weeks. Lung volume increased by 9\% in mice acclimated to high altitude. (V) over dot(O2, max) was also significantly higher under hypoxic conditions after high altitude acclimation compared with controls. Body mass-corrected residuals of (V) over dot(O2,max) were significantly correlated with an index of cardiopulmonary size (summed standardized residuals of lung volume and heart mass) under both hypoxic and normoxic conditions. These data show that phenotypic plasticity in lung volume and heart mass plays an important role in maintaining aerobic performance under hypoxic conditions, and accounts for up to 55\% of the variance in aerobic performance.",2014,217,20,3758-3764

To test whether the rate and rhythm of the heart acclimatize to seasonal temperature changes, thermal sensitivity of cardiac excitation in a eurythermal teleost, the roach (Rutilus rutilus), was examined. Excitability of the heart was determined from in vivo electrocardiograms and in vitro microelectrode recordings of action potentials (APs) from winter and summer roach acclimatized to 4 and 18 degrees C, respectively. Under heat ramps (3 degrees C h(-1)), starting from the acclimatization temperatures of the fish, heart rate increased to maximum values of 78 +/- 5 beats min(-1) (at 19.8 +/- 0.5 degrees C) and 150 +/- 7 beats min(-1) (at 28.1 +/- 0.5 degrees C) for winter and summer roach, respectively, and then declined in both groups. Below 20 degrees C, heart rate was significantly higher in winter than in summer roach (P<0.05), indicating positive thermal compensation. Cardiac arrhythmias appeared with rising temperature as missing QRS complexes, increase in variability of heart rate, episodes of atrial tachycardia, ventricular bradycardia and complete cessation of the heartbeat (asystole) in both winter and summer roach. Unlike winter roach, atrial APs of summer roach had a distinct early repolarization phase, which appeared as shorter durations of atrial AP at 10\% and 20\% repolarization levels in comparison to winter roach (P<0.05). In contrast, seasonal acclimatization had only subtle effects on ventricular AP characteristics. Plasticity of cardiac excitation appears to be necessary for seasonal improvements in performance level and thermal resilience of the roach heart.",2016,219,10,1495-1504
Aerobic scope does not predict the performance of a tropical eurythermal fish at elevated temperatures,"Norin, Tommy and Malte, Hans and Clark, Timothy D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.089755,"Climate warming is predicted to negatively impact fish populations through impairment of oxygen transport systems when temperatures exceed those which are optimal for aerobic scope (AS). This concept of oxygen-and capacity-limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT) is rapidly gaining popularity within climate change research and has been applied to several fish species. Here, we evaluated the relevance of aerobic performance of juvenile barramundi (Lates calcarifer) in the context of thermal preference and tolerance by (1) measuring standard and maximum metabolic rates (SMR and MMR, respectively) and AS of fish acclimated to 29 degrees C and acutely exposed to temperatures from 23 to 38 degrees C, (2) allowing the fish to behaviourally select a preferred temperature between 29 and 38 degrees C, and (3) quantifying alterations to AS after 5 weeks of acclimation to 29 and 38 degrees C. SMR and MMR both increased continuously with temperature in acutely exposed fish, but the increase was greater for MMR such that AS was highest at 38 degrees C, a temperature approaching the upper lethal limit (40-41 degrees C). Despite 38 degrees C eliciting maximum AS, when given the opportunity the fish selected a median temperature of 31.7 +/- 0.5 degrees C and spent only 10 +/- 3\% of their time at temperatures > 36 degrees C. Following acclimation to 38 degrees C, AS measured at 38 degrees C was decreased to the same level as 29 degrees C-acclimated fish measured at 29 degrees C, suggesting that AS may be dynamically modulated independent of temperature to accommodate the requirements of daily life. Together, these results reveal limited power of the OCLTT hypothesis in predicting optimal temperatures and effects of climate warming on juvenile barramundi.",2014,217,2,244-251

The OCLTT hypothesis, however, emphasises the importance of sustained animal performance over acute tolerance. The present study tested the effect of chronic hypoxia and hyperoxia during development on moderate to long-term performance indicators at temperatures spanning the optimal temperature for growth in the speckled cockroach, Nauphoeta cinerea. In contrast to the predictions of the OCLTT hypothesis, development under hypoxia did not significantly reduce growth rate or running performance, and development under hyperoxia did not significantly increase growth rate or running performance. The effects of developmental temperature and oxygen on tracheal morphology and metabolic rate were also not consistent with OCLTT predictions, suggesting that oxygen delivery capacity is not the primary driver shaping thermal tolerance in this species. Collectively, these findings suggest that the OCLTT hypothesis does not explain moderate to long-term thermal performance in N. cinerea, which raises further questions about the generality of the hypothesis.",2020,223,11,NA

However, the reduction of oxygen partial pressure with increase in elevation represents an important physiological constraint that may limit colonization of such habitats, even if the thermal niche is appropriate. To test the mechanisms underlying the response to ecologically relevant levels of hypoxia, we performed a translocation experiment with the common wall lizard (Podarcis muralis), a widespread European lizard amenable to establishing populations outside its natural range. We investigated the impacts of hypoxia on the oxygen physiology and reproductive output of gravid common wall lizards and the subsequent development and morphology of their offspring. Lowland females transplanted to high elevations increased their haematocrit and haemoglobin concentration within days and maintained routine metabolism compared with lizards kept at native elevations. However, transplanted lizards suffered from increased reactive oxygen metabolite production near the oviposition date, suggesting a cost of reproduction at high elevation. Transplanted females and females native to different elevations did not differ in reproductive output (clutch size, egg mass, relative clutch mass or embryonic stage at oviposition) or in post-oviposition body condition. Developing embryos reduced heart rates and prolonged incubation times at high elevations within the native range and at extreme high elevations beyond the current range, but this reduced oxygen availability did not affect metabolic rate, hatching success or hatchling size. These results suggest that this opportunistic colonizer is capable of successfully responding to novel environmental constraints in these important life-history stages.",2019,222,14,NA

Using an ex situ population of Cryptobranchus alleganiensis, an aquatic North American salamander, we tested the hypothesis that naturally occurring periods of temperature variation negatively impact amphibian health, either through direct effects on immune function or by increasing physiological stress. We exposed captive salamanders to repeated cycles of temperature fluctuations recorded in the population's natal stream and evaluated behavioral and physiological responses, including plasma complement activity (i.e. bacteria killing) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Aeromonas hydrophila. The best-fit model (Delta AIC(c)=0, w(i)=0.9992) revealed 70\% greater P. aeruginosa killing after exposure to variable temperatures and no evidence of thermal acclimation. The same model predicted 50\% increased E. coli killing, but had weaker support (Delta AIC(c)=1.8, w(i)=0.2882). In contrast, plasma defenses were ineffective against A. hydrophila, and other health indicators (leukocyte ratios, growth rates and behavioral patterns) were maintained at baseline values. Our data suggest that amphibians can tolerate, and even benefit from, natural patterns of rapid warming/cooling. Specifically, temperature variation can elicit increased activity of the innate immune system. This immune response may be adaptive in an unpredictable environment, and is undetectable by conventional health indicators (and hence considered cryptic). Our findings highlight the need to consider naturalistic patterns of temperature variation when predicting species' susceptibility to climate change.",2013,216,22,4204-4211
Anna's hummingbird (<i>Calypte anna</i>) physiological response to novel thermal and hypoxic conditions at high elevations,"Spence, Austin R. and LeWinter, Hannah and Tingley, Morgan W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.243294,"Many species have not tracked their thermal niches upslope as predicted by climate change, potentially because higher elevations are associated with abiotic challenges beyond temperature. To better predict whether organisms can continue to move upslope with rising temperatures, we need to understand their physiological performance when subjected to novel high-elevation conditions. Here, we captured Anna's hummingbirds - a species expanding their elevational distribution in concordance with rising temperatures - from across their current elevational distribution and tested their physiological response to novel abiotic conditions. First, at a central aviary within their current elevational range, we measured hovering metabolic rate to assess their response to oxygen conditions and torpor use to assess their response to thermal conditions. Second, we transported the hummingbirds to a location 1200 m above their current elevational range limit to test for an acute response to novel oxygen and thermal conditions. Hummingbirds exhibited lower hovering metabolic rates above their current elevational range limit, suggesting lower oxygen availability may reduce performance after an acute exposure. Alternatively, hummingbirds showed a facultative response to thermal conditions by using torpor more frequently and for longer. Finally, post-experimental dissection found that hummingbirds originating from higher elevations within their range had larger hearts, a potential plastic response to hypoxic environments. Overall, our results suggest lower oxygen availability and low air pressure may be difficult challenges to overcome for hummingbirds shifting upslope as a consequence of rising temperatures, especially if there is little to no long-term acclimatization. Future studies should investigate how chronic exposure and acclimatization to novel conditions, as opposed to acute experiments, may result in alternative outcomes that help organisms better respond to abiotic challenges associated with climate-induced range shifts.",2022,225,10,NA

We examined this issue in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) from a population native to high altitude. Mice were bred in captivity in one of three treatment groups: normoxia (controls), lifelong hypoxia (similar to 12 kPa O-2 from conception to adulthood) and parental hypoxia (normoxia from conception to adulthood, but parents previously exposed to hypoxia). Metabolic. therrnoregulatory and ventilatory responses to progressive stepwise hypoxia and haematology were then measured at post-natal day (P) 14 and 30 and/or in adulthood. Life-long hypoxia had consistent effects across ages on metabolism, attenuating the declines in O-2 consumption rate (<(V)over dot>(O2)) and body temperature during progressive hypoxia compared with control mice. However, life-long hypoxia had age-specific effects on breathing, blunting the hypoxia-induced increases in air convection requirement (quotient of total ventilation and <(V)over dot>(O2)) at P14 and P30 only, but then shifting breathing pattern towards deeper and/or less frequent breaths at P30 and adulthood. Hypoxia exposure also increased blood-O-2 affinity at P14 and P30, in association with an increase in arterial O-2 saturation in hypoxia at P30. In contrast, parental hypoxia had no effects on metabolism or breathing, but it increased blood-O-2 affinity and decreased red cell haemoglobin content at P14 (but not P30). Therefore. hypoxia exposure has some consistent effects across early life and adulthood, and some other effects that are unique to specific life stages.",2021,224,1,NA

To understand the respiratory physiology of this species under these conditions and the selective pressures that maintain the ability to breathe air, we acclimated fish to 5 degrees C and 15 degrees C and used respirometry to measure: standard oxygen uptake ((M) over dot(O2)) in normoxia (19.8 kPa P-O2) and hypoxia (2.5 kPa), with and without access to air; partitioning of standard (M) over dot(O2) in normoxia and hypoxia; maximum (M) over dot(O2) and partitioning after exercise; and critical oxygen tension (P-crit). Additionally, the effects of temperature acclimation on haematocrit, haemoglobin oxygen affinity and gill morphology were assessed. Standard (M) over dot(O2) was higher, but air breathing was not increased, at 15 degrees C or after exercise at both temperatures. Fish acclimated to 5 degrees C or 1 degrees C increased air breathing to compensate and fully maintain standard (M) over dot(O2) in hypoxia. Fish were able to maintain (M) over dot(O2) through aquatic respiration when air was denied in normoxia, but when air was denied in hypoxia, standard (M) over dot(O2) was reduced by similar to 30-50\%. P-crit was relatively high (5 kPa) and there were no differences in P-crit, gill morphology, haematocrit or haemoglobin oxygen affinity at the two temperatures. Therefore, Alaska blackfish depends on air breathing in hypoxia and additional mechanisms must thus be utilised to survive hypoxic submergence during the winter, such as hypoxia-induced enhancement in the capacities for carrying and binding blood oxygen, behavioural avoidance of hypoxia and suppression of metabolic rate.",2014,217,24,4387-4398
The cost of muscle power production: muscle oxygen consumption per unit work increases at low temperatures in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>,"Seebacher, Frank and Tallis, Jason A. and James, Rob S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.101147,"Metabolic energy (ATP) supply to muscle is essential to support activity and behaviour. It is expected, therefore, that there is strong selection to maximise muscle power output for a given rate of ATP use. However, the viscosity and stiffness of muscle increases with a decrease in temperature, which means that more ATP may be required to achieve a given work output. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ATP use increases at lower temperatures for a given power output in Xenopus laevis. To account for temperature variation at different time scales, we considered the interaction between acclimation for 4 weeks (to 15 or 25 degrees C) and acute exposure to these temperatures. Cold-acclimated frogs had greater sprint speed at 15 degrees C than warm-acclimated animals. However, acclimation temperature did not affect isolated gastrocnemius muscle biomechanics. Isolated muscle produced greater tetanus force, and faster isometric force generation and relaxation, and generated more work loop power at 25 degrees C than at 15 degrees C acute test temperature. Oxygen consumption of isolated muscle at rest did not change with test temperature, but oxygen consumption while muscle was performing work was significantly higher at 15 degrees C than at 25 degrees C, regardless of acclimation conditions. Muscle therefore consumed significantly more oxygen at 15 degrees C for a given work output than at 25 degrees C, and plastic responses did not modify this thermodynamic effect. The metabolic cost of muscle performance and activity therefore increased with a decrease in temperature. To maintain activity across a range of temperature, animals must increase ATP production or face an allocation trade-off at lower temperatures. Our data demonstrate the potential energetic benefits of warming up muscle before activity, which is seen in diverse groups of animals such as bees, which warm flight muscle before take-off, and humans performing warm ups before exercise.",2014,217,11,1940-1945
Is cold acclimation of benefit to hibernating rodents?,"Egginton, Stuart and May, Shaun and Deveci, Durmus and Hauton, David",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.079160,"The thermal challenge associated with cold acclimation (CA) and hibernation requires effective cardio-respiratory function over a large range of temperatures. We examined the impact of acute cooling in a cold-naive hibernator to quantify the presumed improvement in cardio-respiratory dysfunction triggered by CA, and estimate the role of the autonomic nervous system in optimising cardiac and respiratory function. Golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) were held at a 12h: 12h light: dark photoperiod and room temperature (21 degrees C euthermic control) or exposed to simulated onset of winter in an environmental chamber, by progression to 1h:23. h light: dark and 4 degrees C over 4. weeks. In vivo acute cooling (core temperature T-b=25 degrees C) in euthermic controls led to a hypotension and bradycardia, but preserved cardiac output. CA induced a hypertension at normothermia (T-b=37 degrees C) but on cooling led to decreases in diastolic pressure below euthermic controls and a decrease in cardiac output, despite an increase in left ventricular conductance. Power spectral analysis of heart rate variability suggested a decline in vagal tone on cooling euthermic hamsters (T-b=25 degrees C). Following CA, vagal tone was increased at T-b= 37 degrees C, but declined more quickly on cooling (T-b= 25 degrees C) to preserve vagal tone at levels similar to euthermic controls at T-b= 37 degrees C. For the isolated heart, CA led to concentric hypertrophy with decreased end-diastolic volume, but with no change in intrinsic heart rate at either 37 or 25 degrees C. Mechanical impairment was noted at 37 degrees C following CA, with peak developed pressure decreased by 50\% and peak rate-pressure product decreased by 65\%; this difference was preserved at 25 degrees C. For euthermic hearts, coronary flow showed thermal sensitivity, decreasing by 65\% on cooling (T= 25 degrees C). By contrast, CA hearts had low coronary flow compared with euthermic controls, but with a loss of thermal sensitivity. Together, these observations suggest that CA induced a functional impairment in the myocardium that limits performance of the cardiovascular system at euthermia, despite increased autonomic input to preserve cardiac function. On acute cooling this autonomic control was lost and cardiac performance declined further than for cold-nave hamsters, suggesting that CA may compromise elements of cardiovascular function to facilitate preservation of those more critical for subsequent rewarming.",2013,216,11,2140-2149
Elevated temperatures dampen the innate immune capacity of developing lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens),"Bugg, William S. and Yoon, Gwangseok R. and Schoen, Alexandra N. and Weinrauch, Alyssa M. and Jeffries, Ken M. and Anderson, Gary",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.245335,"Chronic exposure to high temperatures may leave freshwater fishes vulnerable to opportunistic pathogens, particularly during early life stages. Lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, populations within the northern expanse of their range in Manitoba, Canada, may be susceptible to high temperature stress and pathogenic infection. We acclimated developing lake sturgeon for 22 days to two ecologically relevant, summer temperatures (16 and 20 \& DEG;C). Individuals from both acclimation treatments were then exposed to 0, 30 and 60 \& mu;g ml-1 bacterial lipopolysaccharides (endotoxins), as an immune stimulus, for 48 h and sampled 4 and 48 h during trial exposures and following a 7 day recovery period. We then measured whole-body transcriptional (mRNA) responses involved in the innate immune, stress and fatty acid responses following acute exposure to the bacterial endotoxins. Data revealed that overall levels of mRNA transcript abundance were higher in 20 \& DEG;C-reared sturgeon under control conditions. However, following exposure to a bacterial stimulus, lake sturgeon acclimated to 16 \& DEG;C produced a more robust and persistent transcriptional response with higher mRNA transcript abundance across innate immune, stress and fatty acid responses than their 20 \& DEG;C-acclimated counterparts. Additional whole-animal performance metrics (critical thermal maximum, metabolic rate, cortisol concentration and whole -body and mucosal lysozyme activity) demonstrated acclimation -specific responses, indicating compromised metabolic, stress and enzymatic capacity following the initiation of immune-related responses. Our study showed that acclimation to 20 \& DEG;C during early development impaired the immune capacity of developing lake sturgeon as well as the activation of molecular pathways involved in the immune, stress and fatty acid responses. The present study highlights the effects of ecologically relevant, chronic thermal stress on seasonal pathogen susceptibility in this endangered species.",2023,226,10,NA
Intergenerational plasticity to cycling high temperature and hypoxia affects offspring stress responsiveness and tolerance in zebrafish,"Lim, Michael Y. -T. and Bernier, Nicholas J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.245583,"Predicted climate change-induced increases in heat waves and hypoxic events will have profound effects on fishes, yet the capacity of parents to alter offspring phenotype via non-genetic inheritance and buffer against these combined stressors is not clear. This study tested how prolonged adult zebrafish exposure to combined diel cycles of thermal stress and hypoxia affect offspring early survival and development, parental investment of cortisol and heat shock proteins (HSPs), larval offspring stress responses, and both parental and offspring heat and hypoxia tolerance. Parental exposure to the combined stressor did not affect fecundity, but increased mortality, produced smaller embryos and delayed hatching. The combined treatment also reduced maternal deposition of cortisol and increased embryo hsf1, hsp70a, HSP70, hsp90aa and HSP90 levels. In larvae, basal cortisol levels did not differ between treatments, but acute exposure to combined heat stress and hypoxia increased cortisol levels in control larvae with no effect on larvae from exposed parents. In contrast, whereas larval basal hsf1, hsp70a and hsp90aa levels differed between parental treatments, the combined acute stressor elicited similar transcriptional responses across treatments. Moreover, the combined acute stressor only induced a marked increase in HSP47 levels in the larvae derived from exposed parents. Finally, combined hypoxia and elevated temperatures increased both thermal and hypoxia tolerance in adults and conferred an increase in offspring thermal but not hypoxia tolerance. These results demonstrate that intergenerational acclimation to combined thermal stress and hypoxia elicit complex carryover effects on stress responsiveness and offspring tolerance with potential consequences for resilience.",2023,226,16,NA
An impressive capacity for cold tolerance plasticity protects against ionoregulatory collapse in the disease vector <i>Aedes aegypti</i>,"Jass, Amanda and Yerushalmi, Gil Y. and Davis, Hannah E. and Donini, Andrew and MacMillan, Heath A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.214056,"The mosquito Aedes aegypti is largely confined to tropical and subtropical regions, but its range has recently been spreading to colder climates. As insect biogeography is tied to environmental temperature, understanding the limits of A. aegypti thermal tolerance and their capacity for phenotypic plasticity is important in predicting the spread of this species. In this study, we report on the chill coma onset (CCO) and recovery time (CCRT), as well as low-temperature survival phenotypes of larvae and adults of A. aegypti that developed or were acclimated to 15 degrees C (cold) or 25 degrees C (warm). Cold acclimation did not affect CCO temperatures of larvae but substantially reduced CCO in adults. Temperature and the duration of exposure both affected CCRT, and cold acclimation strongly mitigated these effects and increased rates of survival following prolonged chilling. Female adults were far less likely to take a blood meal when cold acclimated, and exposing females to blood (without feeding) attenuated some of the beneficial effects of cold acclimation on CCRT. Lastly, larvae suffered from haemolymph hyperkalaemia when chilled, but cold acclimation attenuated the imbalance. Our results demonstrate that A. aegypti larvae and adults have the capacity to acclimate to low temperatures, and do so at least in part by better maintaining ion balance in the cold. This ability for cold acclimation may facilitate the spread of this species to higher latitudes, particularly in an era of climate change.",2019,222,24,NA

We investigated this hypothesis by studying the effects of acute temperature increases (16, 23, 30, 32.5 and 36 degrees C) on the thermal sensitivity of 10 key enzymes governing cardiac oxidative and glycolytic metabolism in two populations of European perch (Perca fluviatilis) field-acclimated to 15.5 and 22.5 degrees C, as well as the effects of acclimation on cardiac lipid composition. In both populations of perch, the activity of glycolytic (pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase) and tricarboxylic acid cycle (pyruvate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase) enzymes increased with acute warming. However, at temperatures exceeding 30 degrees C, a drastic thermally induced decline in citrate synthase activity was observed in the cold-and warm-acclimated populations, respectively, indicating a bottleneck for producing the reducing equivalents required for oxidative phosphorylation. Yet, the increase in aspartate aminotransferase and malate dehydrogenase activities occurring in both populations at temperatures exceeding 30 degrees C suggests that the malate-aspartate shuttle may help to maintain cardiac oxidative capacities at high temperatures. Warm acclimation resulted in a reorganization of the lipid profile, a general depression of enzymatic activity and an increased fatty acid metabolism and oxidative capacity. Although these compensatory mechanisms may help to maintain cardiac energy production at high temperatures, the activity of the electron transport system enzymes, such as complexes I and IV, declined at 36 degrees C in both populations, indicating a thermal limit of oxidative phosphorylation capacity in the heart of European perch.",2017,220,3,386-396
Warm preconditioning protects against acute heat-induced respiratory dysfunction and delays bleaching in a symbiotic sea anemone,"Hawkins, Thomas D. and Warner, Mark E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.150391,"Preconditioning to non-stressful warming can protect some symbiotic cnidarians against the high temperature-induced collapse of their mutualistic endosymbiosis with photosynthetic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium spp.), a process known as bleaching. Here, we sought to determine whether such preconditioning is underpinned by differential regulation of aerobic respiration. We quantified in vivo metabolism and mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activity in the naturally symbiotic sea anemone Exaiptasia pallida preconditioned to 30 degrees C for > 7 weeks as well as anemones kept at 26 degrees C. Preconditioning resulted in increased Symbiodinium photosynthetic activity and holobiont (host+ symbiont) respiration rates. Biomassnormalised activities of host respiratory enzymes {[}citrate synthase and the mitochondrial electron transport chain (mETC) complexes I and IV] were higher in preconditioned animals, suggesting that increased holobiont respiration may have been due to host mitochondrial biogenesis and/or enlargement. Subsequent acute heating of preconditioned and ` thermally naive' animals to 33 degrees C induced dramatic increases in host mETC complex I and Symbiodinium mETC complex II activities only in thermally naive E. pallida. These changes were not reflected in the activities of other respiratory enzymes. Furthermore, bleaching in preconditioned E. pallida (defined as the significant loss of symbionts) was delayed by several days relative to the thermally naive group. These findings suggest that changes to mitochondrial biogenesis and/or function in symbiotic cnidarians during warm preconditioning might play a protective role during periods of exposure to stressful heating.",2017,220,6,969-983

We measured the effects of single heat shocks and of diurnally fluctuating or constant rearing temperatures on the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) for final instar larvae of Manduca sexta. Brief (2 h) heat shocks at temperatures of 35 degrees C and above significantly increased CTmax relative to control temperatures (25 degrees C). Increasing mean temperatures (from 25 to 30 degrees C) or greater diurnal fluctuations (from constant to +/- 10 degrees C) during larval development also significantly increased CTmax. Combining these data showed that repeated or continuous temperature exposure during development improved heat tolerance beyond the effects of a single exposure to the same maximum temperature.

Cycling temperature treatments affect estimates of digestive performance in prairie lizards<i> (Sceloporus</i><i> consobrinus)</i>,"Litmer, Allison R. and Beaupre, Steven J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.247006,"In nature, many organisms experience a daily range of body temperatures. Thermal performance at stable temperatures is often extrapolated to predict function in cyclical environments. However, temperature order and cyclicity may influence physiological processes. The current study compared energy intake, digestive passage time and energy budgets at a stable temperature (33 degrees C) and two temperature cycles in lizards (Sceloporus consobrinus), to determine (1) whether stable treatments adequately project performance in a cycling environment and (2) whether temperature order influences performance. Cycles had a mean temperature of 33 degrees C, and rotated through 30 degrees C, 33 degrees C and 36 degrees C daily, with equal durations of time at each temperature but differing temperature order, with warm days and cool nights in cycle 1 and cool days and warm nights in cycle 2. For analyses, performance in the stable treatment was compared with that during cycles. If temperature is the primary factor regulating performance, then performance from the stable treatment and cycles should compare favorably. However, physiological performance varied based on temperature treatment. Energy intake and budgets were similar between the stable trial and cycle 1 but not cycle 2. However, passage time did not differ. Notably, the two cycling regimes consistently varied in performance, indicating that temperature order plays a primary role in regulating performance. Physiological data collection requires careful consideration of effects of cycling versus stable temperature treatments. Stable temperatures do not consistently represent performance in cycling regimes and consideration should be paid not only to which temperatures animals experience but also to how temperature is experienced in nature.",2024,227,4,NA
Exploring nature's natural knockouts: <i>in vivo</i> cardiorespiratory performance of Antarctic fishes during acute warming,"Joyce, William and Egginton, Stuart and Farrell, Anthony P. and Crockett, Elizabeth L. and O'Brien, Kristin M. and Axelsson, Michael",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.183160,"We tested the hypothesis that blackfin icefish (Chaenocephalus aceratus), one of the six species in the family Channichthyidae (the icefishes) that do not express haemoglobin and myoglobin, lack regulatory cardiovascular flexibility during acute warming and activity. The experimental protocols were designed to optimize the surgical protocol and minimize stress. First, minimally invasive heart rate (f(H)) measurements were made during a thermal ramp until cardiac failure in C. aceratus and compared with those from the closely related red-blooded black rockcod (Notothenia coriiceps). Then, integrative cardiovascular adjustments were more extensively studied using flow probes and intravascular catheters in C. aceratus during acute warming (from 0 to 8 degrees C) at rest and after imposed activity. Chaenocephalus aceratus had a lower routine f H than N. coriiceps (9 beats min(-1) versus 14 beats min(-1)) and a lower peak f(H )during acute warming (38 beats min' versus 55 beats min(-1)) with a similar cardiac breakpoint temperature (13 and 14 degrees C, respectively). Routine cardiac output ((Q) over dot) for C. aceratus at similar to 0 degrees C was much lower (26.6 ml min(-1) kg(-1)) than previously reported, probably because fish in the present study had a low f(H) (12 beats min(-1)) indicative of a high routine vagal tone and low stress. Chaenocephalus aceratus increased oxygen consumption during acute warming and with activity. Correspondingly, (Q) over dot increased considerably (maximally 86.3 ml min(-1) kg(-1)), as did vascular conductance (5-fold). Thus, unlike earlier suggestions, these data provide convincing evidence that icefish can mount a well-developed cardiovascular regulation of heart rate, cardiac output and vascular conductance, and this regulatory capacity provides flexibility during acute warming.",2018,221,15,NA
Relative roles of temperature and photoperiod as drivers of metabolic flexibility in dark-eyed juncos,"Swanson, David and Zhang, Yufeng and Liu, Jin-Song and Merkord, Christopher L. and King, Marisa O.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.096677,"Seasonal phenotypic flexibility in small birds produces a winter phenotype with elevated maximum cold-induced metabolic rates (=summit metabolism, (M) over dot(sum)). Temperature and photoperiod are candidates for drivers of seasonal phenotypes, but their relative impacts on metabolic variation are unknown. We examined photoperiod and temperature effects on (M) over dot(sum), muscle masses and activities of key catabolic enzymes in winter dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis). We randomly assigned birds to four treatment groups varying in temperature (cold=3 degrees C; warm=24 degrees C) and photoperiod {[}short day (SD)=8 h: 16 h light: dark; long day (LD)=16 h: 8 h light: dark] in a two-by-two design. We measured body mass (M-b), flight muscle width and (M) over dot(sum) before and after 3 and 6 weeks of acclimation, and flight muscle and heart masses after 6 weeks. (M) over dot(sum) increased for cold-exposed, but not for warm-exposed, birds. LD birds gained more M-b than SD birds, irrespective of temperature. Flight muscle size and mass did not differ significantly among groups, but heart mass was larger in cold-exposed birds. Citrate synthase, carnitine palmitoyl transferase and beta-hydroxyacyl Co-A dehydrogenase activities in the pectoralis were generally higher for LD and cold groups. The cold-induced changes in (M) over dot(sum) and heart mass parallel winter changes for small birds, but the larger M-b and higher catabolic enzyme activities in LD birds suggest photoperiod-induced changes associated with migratory disposition. Temperature appears to be a primary driver of flexibility in (M) over dot(sum) in juncos, but photoperiod-induced changes in M-b and catabolic enzyme activities, likely associated with migratory disposition, interact with temperature to contribute to seasonal phenotypes.",2014,217,6,866-875
Body temperature maintenance acclimates in a winter-tenacious songbird,"Stager, Maria and Senner, Nathan R. and Tobalske, Bret W. and Cheviron, Zachary A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.221853,"Flexibility in heat generation and dissipation mechanisms provides endotherms the ability to match their thermoregulatory strategy with external demands. However, the degree to which these two mechanisms account for seasonal changes in body temperature regulation is little explored. Here, we present novel data on the regulation of avian body temperature to investigate how birds alter mechanisms of heat production and heat conservation to deal with variation in ambient conditions. We subjected dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) to chronic cold acclimations of varying duration and subsequently quantified their metabolic rates, thermal conductance and ability to maintain normothermia. Cold-acclimated birds adjusted traits related to both heat generation (increased summit metabolic rate) and heat conservation (decreased conductance) to improve their body temperature regulation. Increases in summit metabolic rate occurred rapidly, but plateaued after 1 week of cold exposure. In contrast, changes to conductance occurred only after 9 weeks of cold exposure. Thus, the ability to maintain body temperature continued to improve throughout the experiment, but the mechanisms underlying this improvement changed through time. Our results demonstrate the ability of birds to adjust thermoregulatory strategies in response to thermal cues and reveal that birds may combine multiple responses to meet the specific demands of their environments.",2020,223,12,NA

Addressing this knowledge gap, we investigated chronic and acute effects of two stressors (high temperature and hypoxia) in yolk-sac larval (48168 hpf) zebrafish (Danio rerio) energy budgets measuring, oxygen consumption rate, growth rate (absolute and specific), \% net conversion efficiency, net cost of growth and scaling relationships. Embryos and larvae were raised under four chronic treatments: (1) control (28 degrees C and PO2 21 kPa, T28O21), (2) high temperature (31 degrees C and PO2 21 kPa, T31O21), (3) hypoxia (28 degrees C and PO2 11 kPa, T28TO11) and (4) high temperature and hypoxia (31 degrees C and PO2 11 kPa, T31O11). From each chronic treatment, larvae were acutely exposed to the same combinations of stressors for 1 h in a respirometer. At hatching, larvae from chronic high temperature (T31O21 and T31O11) treatments were larger (higher dry mass and standard length) than controls (T28O21 and T28O11), but by the end of the yolk-sac stage, increased metabolic demands diverted energy away from growth, increasing net cost of growth and lowering \% net conversion efficiency. Control metabolic scaling relationships were significant and differed from 0.75, but metabolic levels were lower in acute hypoxia and high temperature/hypoxia. Thus, high temperature dominated larval energetics, acting synergistically with hypoxia to increase cumulative energetic costs and making allostasis difficult compared with older stages.",2022,225,20,NA
Irreversible impact of early thermal conditions: an integrative study of developmental plasticity linked to mobility in a butterfly species,"Degut, Anais and Fischer, Klaus and Quque, Martin and Criscuolo, Francois and Michalik, Peter and Beaulieu, Michael",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.243724,"Within populations, phenotypic plasticity may allow adaptive phenotypic variation in response to selection generated by environmental heterogeneity. For instance, in multivoltine species, seasonal changes between and within generations may trigger morphological and physiological variation enhancing fitness under different environmental conditions. These seasonal changes may irreversibly affect adult phenotypes when experienced during development. Yet, the irreversible effects of developmental plasticity on adult morphology have rarely been linked to life-history traits even though they may affect different fitness components such as reproduction, mobility and self-maintenance. To address this issue, we raised larvae of Pieris napi butterflies under warm or cool conditions to subsequently compare adult performance in terms of reproduction performance (as assessed through fecundity), displacement capacity (as assessed through flight propensity and endurance) and self-maintenance (as assessed through the measurement of oxidative markers). As expected in ectotherms, individuals developed faster under warm conditions and were smaller than individuals developing under cool conditions. They also had more slender wings and showed a higher wing surface ratio. These morphological differences were associated with changes in the reproductive and flight performance of adults, as individuals developing under warm conditions laid fewer eggs and flew larger distances. Accordingly, the examination of their oxidative status suggested that individuals developing under warm conditions invested more strongly into self-maintenance than individuals developing under cool conditions (possibly at the expense of reproduction). Overall, our results indicate that developmental conditions have long-term consequences on several adult traits in butterflies. This plasticity probably acts on life-history strategies for each generation to keep pace with seasonal variations and may facilitate acclimation processes in the context of climate change.",2022,225,3,NA
Can temperature-dependent changes in myocardial contractility explain why fish only increase heart rate when exposed to acute warming?,"Gamperl, A. Kurt and Thomas, Alexander L. and Syme, Douglas A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.243152,"Fish increase heart rate (f(H)), not stroke volume (V-S), when acutely warmed as a way to increase cardiac output (Q). To assess whether aspects of myocardial function may have some basis in determining temperature-dependent cardiac performance, we measured work and power (shortening, lengthening and net) in isolated segments of steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) ventricular muscle at the fish's acclimation temperature (14 degrees C), and at 22 degrees C, when subjected to increased rates of contraction (30-105 min(-1), emulating increased f(H)) and strain amplitude (8-14\%, mimicking increased V-S). At 22 degrees C, shortening power (indicative of 40) increased in proportion to f(H), and the work required to re-lengthen (stretch) the myocardium (fill the heart) was largely independent of f(H) . In contrast, the increase in shortening power was less than proportional when strain was augmented, and lengthening work approximately doubled when strain was increased. Thus, the derived relationships between f(H) , strain and myocardial shortening power and lengthening work, suggest that increasing f(H) would be preferable as a mechanism to increase Q at high temperatures, or in fact may be an unavoidable response given constraints on muscle mechanics as temperatures rise. Interestingly, at 14 degrees C, lengthening work increased substantially at higher f(H), and the duration of lengthening (i.e. diastole) became severely constrained when f(H) was increased. These data suggest that myocardial contraction/twitch kinetics greatly constrain maximal f(H) at cool temperatures, and may underlie observations that fish elevate V-S to an equal or greater extent than f(H) to meet demands for increased Q at lower temperatures.",2022,225,4,NA
Can physiological engineering/programming increase multi-generational thermal tolerance to extreme temperature events?,"Sorby, Kris L. and Green, Mark P. and Dempster, Tim D. and Jessop, Tim S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.174672,"Organisms increasingly encounter higher frequencies of extreme weather events as a consequence of global climate change. Currently, few strategies are available to mitigate climate change effects on animals arising from acute extreme high-temperature events. We tested the capacity of physiological engineering to influence the intra- and multi-generational upper thermal tolerance capacity of a model organism. Artemia, subjected to extreme high temperatures. Enhancement of specific physiological regulators during development could affect thermal tolerance or life-history attributes affecting subsequent fitness. Using experimental Artemia populations, we exposed F0 individuals to one of four treatments: heat hardening (28 degrees C to 36 degrees C, 1 degrees C per 10 min), heat hardening plus serotonin (0.056 mu g ml(-1)), heat hardening plus methionine (0.79 mg ml(-1)) and a control treatment. Regulator concentrations were based on previous literature. Serotonin may promote thermal tolerance, acting upon metabolism and life history. Methionine acts as a methylation agent across generations. For all groups, measurements were collected for three performance traits of individual thermal tolerance (upper sublethal thermal limit, lethal limit and dysregulation range) over two generations. The results showed that no treatment increased the upper thermal limit during acute thermal stress, although serotonin-treated and methionine-treated individuals outperformed controls across multiple thermal performance traits. Additionally, some effects were evident across generations. Together, these results suggest that phenotypic engineering provides complex outcomes, and if implemented with heat hardening can further influence performance in multiple thermal tolerance traits, within and across generations. Potentially, such techniques could be up-scaled to provide resilience and stability in populations susceptible to extreme temperature events.",2018,221,14,NA
Reversibility of developmental heat and cold plasticity is asymmetric and has long-lasting consequences for adult thermal tolerance,"Slotsbo, Stine and Schou, Mads F. and Kristensen, Torsten N. and Loeschcke, Volker and Sorensen, Jesper G.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.143750,"The ability of insects to cope with stressful temperatures through adaptive plasticity has allowed them to thrive under a wide range of thermal conditions. Developmental plasticity is generally considered to be a non-reversible phenotypic change, e.g. in morphological traits, while adult acclimation responses are often considered to be reversible physiological responses. However, physiologically mediated thermal acclimation might not follow this general prediction. We investigated the magnitude and rate of reversibility of developmental thermal plasticity responses in heat and cold tolerance of adult flies, using a full factorial design with two developmental and two adult temperatures (15 and 25 degrees C). We show that cold tolerance attained during development is readily adjusted to the prevailing conditions during adult acclimation, with a symmetric rate of decrease or increase. In contrast, heat tolerance is only partly reversible during acclimation and is thus constrained by the temperature during development. The effect of adult acclimation on heat tolerance was asymmetrical, with a general loss of heat tolerance with age. Surprisingly, the decline in adult heat tolerance at 25 degrees C was decelerated in flies developed at low temperatures. This result was supported by correlated responses in two senescence-associated traits and in accordance with a lower rate of ageing after low temperature development, suggesting that physiological age is not reset at eclosion. The results have profound ecological consequences for populations, as optimal developmental temperatures will be dependent on the thermal conditions faced in the adult stage and the age at which they occur.",2016,219,17,2726-2732
Interactions between developmental and adult acclimation have distinct consequences for heat tolerance and heat stress recovery,"Willot, Quentin and Loos, Ben and Terblanche, John S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.242479,"Developmental and adult thermal acclimation can have distinct, even opposite, effects on adult heat resistance in ectotherms. Yet, their relative contribution to heat-hardiness of ectotherms remains unclear despite the broad ecological implications thereof. Furthermore, the deterministic relationship between heat knockdown and recovery from heat stress is poorly understood but significant for establishing causal links between climate variability and population dynamics. Here, using Drosophila melanogaster in a full-factorial experimental design, we assessed the heat tolerance of flies in static stress assays, and document how developmental and adult acclimation interact with a distinct pattern to promote survival to heat stress in adults. We show that warmer adult acclimation is the initial factor enhancing survival to constant stressful high temperatures in flies, but also that the interaction between adult and developmental acclimation becomes gradually more important to ensure survival as the stress persists. This provides an important framework revealing the dynamic interplay between these two forms of acclimation that ultimately enhance thermal tolerance as a function of stress duration. Furthermore, by investigating recovery rates post-stress, we also show that the process of heat-hardening and recovery post-heat knockdown are likely to be based on set of (at least partially) divergent mechanisms. This could bear ecological significance as a trade-off may exist between increasing thermal tolerance and maximizing recovery rates post-stress, constraining population responses when exposed to variable and stressful climatic conditions.",2021,224,16,NA
Dynamic changes in cardiac mitochondrial metabolism during warm acclimation in rainbow trout,"Pichaud, Nicolas and Ekstrom, Andreas and Hellgren, Kim and Sandblom, Erik",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.152421,"Although the mitochondrial metabolism responses to warm acclimation have been widely studied in fish, the time course of this process is less understood. Here, we characterized the changes of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) cardiac mitochondrial metabolism during acute warming from 10 to 16 degrees C, and during the subsequent warm acclimation for 39 days. We repeatedly measured mitochondrial oxygen consumption in cardiac permeabilized fibers and the functional integrity of mitochondria (i.e. mitochondrial coupling and cytochrome c effect) at two assay temperatures (10 and 16 degrees C), as well as the activities of citrate synthase (CS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at room temperature. LDH and CS activities significantly increased between day 0 (10 degrees C acclimated fish) and day 1 (acute warming to 16 degrees C) while mitochondrial oxygen consumption measured at respective in vivo temperatures did not change. Enzymatic activities and mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates significantly decreased by day 2, and remained stable during warm acclimation (days 2-39). The decrease in rates of oxygen between day 0 and day 1 coincided with an increased cytochrome c effect and a decreased mitochondrial coupling, suggesting a structural/functional impairment of mitochondria during acute warming. We suggest that after 2 days of warm acclimation, a new homeostasis is reached, which may involve the removal of dysfunctional mitochondria. Interestingly, from day 2 onwards, there was a lack of differences in mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates between the assay temperatures, suggesting that warm acclimation reduces the acute thermal sensitivity of mitochondria. This study provides significant knowledge on the thermal sensitivity of cardiac mitochondria that is essential to delineate the contribution of cellular processes to warm acclimation.",2017,220,9,1674-1683
"Mussel acclimatization to high, variable temperatures is lost slowly upon transfer to benign conditions","Moyen, Nicole E. and Somero, George N. and Denny, Mark W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.222893,"Climate change is increasing the temperature variability animals face, and thermal acclimatization allows animals to adjust adaptively to this variability. Although the rate of heat acclimatization has received some study, little is known about how long these adaptive changes remain without continuing exposure to heat stress. This study explored the rate at which field acclimatization states are lost when temperature variability is minimized during constant submersion. California mussels (Mytilus califomianus) with different acclimatization states were collected from high- and low-zone sites (similar to 12 versus similar to 5 degrees C daily temperature ranges, respectively) and then kept submerged at 15 degrees C for 8 weeks. Each week, the cardiac thermal performance of mussels was measured as a metric of acclimatization state: critical (T-crit) and flatline (T-flat) temperatures were recorded. Over 8 weeks of constant submersion, the mean T(crit )of high-zone mussels decreased by 1.07 degrees C from baseline, but low-zone mussels' mean T-crit  was unchanged. High- and low-zone mussels' mean maximum heart rate (HR) and resting HR decreased similar to 12 and 35\%, respectively. T-flat was unchanged in both groups. These data suggest that T-crit  and HR are more physiologically plastic in response to the narrowing of an animal's daily temperature range than T(flat )is, and that an animal's prior acclimatization state (high versus low) influences the acdimatory capacity of T-crit  . Approximately 2 months were required for the cardiac thermal performance of the high-zone mussels to reach that of the low-zone mussels, suggesting that acclimatization to high and variable temperatures may persist long enough to enable these animals to cope with intermittent bouts of heat stress.",2020,223,13,NA
Reduced ventricular excitability causes atrioventricular block and depression of heart rate in fish at critically high temperatures,"Haverinen, Jaakko and Vornanen, Matti",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.225227,"At critically high temperature, cardiac output in fish collapses as a result of depression of heart rate (bradycardia). However, the cause of bradycardia remains unresolved. To investigate this, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss; acclimated at 12 degrees C) were exposed to acute warming while electrocardiograms were recorded. From 12 degrees C to 25.3 degrees C, electrical excitation between different parts of the heart was coordinated, but above 25.3 degrees C, atrial and ventricular beating rates became partly dissociated because of 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) block. With further warming, atrial rate increased to a peak value of 188 +/- 22 beats min(-1) at 27 degrees C, whereas the ventricle rate peaked at 124 +/- 10 beats min(-1) at 25.3 degrees C and thereafter dropped to 111 +/- 15 beats min(-1) at 27 degrees C. In single ventricular myocytes, warming from 12 degrees C to 25 degrees C attenuated electrical excitability as evidenced by increases in rheobase current and the size of critical depolarization required to trigger action potential. Depression of excitability was caused by temperature-induced decrease in input resistance (sarcolemmal K+ leak via the outward l(K1 )current) of resting myocytes and decrease in inward charge transfer by the Na+ current (l(Na)) of active myocytes. Collectively, these findings show that at critically high temperatures AV block causes ventricular bradycardia owing to the increased excitation threshold of the ventricle, which is due to changes in the passive (resting ion leak) and active (inward charge movement) electrical properties of ventricular myocytes. The sequence of events from the level of ion channels to cardiac function in vivo provides a mechanistic explanation for the depression of cardiac output in fish at critically high temperature.",2020,223,12,NA

However, little is known about physiological mechanisms mediating this interaction. To investigate the underpinnings of heat-hardening responses after acclimatization in warm seasons, we measured thermal tolerance plasticity, and compared transcriptomic and metabolomic changes after heat hardening at 33 or 37 degrees C followed by recovery of 3 or 24 h in an intertidal bivalve Sinonovacula constricta. Clams showed explicit heat-hardening responses after acclimatization in a warm season. The higher inducing temperature (37 degrees C) caused less effective heat-hardening effects than the inducing temperature that was closer to the seasonal maximum temperature (33 degrees C). Metabolomic analysis highlighted the elevated content of glycerophospholipids in all heat-hardened clams, which may help to maintain the structure and function of the membrane. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) tended to be upregulated after heat hardening at 37 degrees C but not at 33 degrees C, indicating that there was no complete dependency of heat-hardening effects on upregulated HSPs. Enhanced energy metabolism and decreased energy reserves were observed after heat hardening at 37 degrees C, suggesting more energy costs during exposure to a higher inducing temperature, which may restrict heat-hardening effects. These results highlight the mediating role of membrane lipid metabolism, heat shock responses and energy costs in the interaction between heat-hardening response and seasonal acclimatization, and contribute to the mechanistic understanding of evolutionary change and thermal plasticity during global climate change.",2021,224,19,NA
Coral species-specific loss and physiological legacy effects are elicited by an extended marine heatwave,"Strand, Emma L. and Wong, Kevin H. and Farrai, Alexa and Gray, Sierra and McMenamin, Ana and Putnam, Hollie M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.246812,"Marine heatwaves are increasing in frequency and intensity, with potentially catastrophic consequences for marine ecosystems such as coral reefs. An extended heatwave and recovery time-series that incorporates multiple stressors and is environmentally realistic can provide enhanced predictive capacity for performance under climate change conditions. We exposed common reef-building corals in Hawai'i, Montipora capitata and Pocillopora acuta , to a 2-month period of high temperature and high P CO 2 conditions or ambient conditions in a factorial design, followed by 2 months of ambient conditions. High temperature, rather than high P CO 2 , drove multivariate physiology shifts through time in both species, including decreases in respiration rates and endosymbiont densities. Pocillopora acuta exhibited more significantly negatively altered physiology, and substantially higher bleaching and mortality than M. capitata . The sensitivity of P. acuta appears to be driven by higher baseline rates of photosynthesis paired with lower host antioxidant capacity, creating an increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. Thermal tolerance of M. capitata may be partly due to harboring a mixture of Cladocopium and Durusdinium spp., whereas P. acuta was dominated by other distinct Cladocopium spp. Only M. capitata survived the experiment, but physiological state in heatwaveexposed M. capitata remained significantly diverged at the end of recovery relative to individuals that experienced ambient conditions. In future climate scenarios, particularly marine heatwaves, our results indicate a species-specific loss of corals that is driven by baseline host and symbiont physiological differences as well as Symbiodiniaceae community compositions, with the surviving species experiencing physiological legacies that are likely to influence future stress responses.",2024,227,11,NA
Breaking free from thermodynamic constraints: thermal acclimation and metabolic compensation in a freshwater zooplankton species,"Coggins, B. L. and Anderson, C. E. and Hasan, R. and Pearson, A.

Y.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.237727,"Respiration rates of ectothermic organisms are affected by environmental temperatures, and sustainable metabolism at high temperatures sometimes limits heat tolerance. Organisms are hypothesized to exhibit acclimatory metabolic compensation effects, decelerating their metabolic processes below Arrhenius expectations based on temperature alone. We tested the hypothesis that either heritable or plastic heat tolerance differences can be explained by metabolic compensation in the eurythermal freshwater zooplankton crustacean Daphnia magna. We measured respiration rates in a ramp-up experiment over a range of assay temperatures (5-37 degrees C) in eight genotypes of D. magna representing a range of previously reported acute heat tolerances and, at a narrower range of temperatures (10-35 degrees C), in D. magna with different acclimation history (either 10 or 25 degrees C). We discovered no difference in temperature-specific respiration rates between heat-tolerant and heat-sensitive genotypes. In contrast, we observed acclimation-specific compensatory differences in respiration rates at both extremes of the temperature range studied. Notably, there was a deceleration of oxygen consumption at higher temperature in 25 degrees C-acclimated D. magna relative to their 10 degrees C-acclimated counterparts, observed in active animals, a pattern corroborated by similar changes in filtering rate and, partly, by changes in mitochondrial membrane potential. A recovery experiment indicated that the reduction of respiration was not caused by irreversible damage during exposure to a sublethal temperature. Response time necessary to acquire the respiratory adjustment to high temperature was lower than for low temperature, indicating that metabolic compensation at lower temperatures requires slower, possibly structural changes.",2021,224,4,NA
"Rapid cold hardening improves recovery of ion homeostasis and chill coma recovery time in the migratory locust, <i>Locusta migratoria</i>","Findsen, Anders and Andersen, Jonas Lembcke and Calderon, Sofia and Overgaard, Johannes",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.081141,"Chill tolerance of insects is defined as the ability to tolerate low temperature under circumstances not involving freezing of intracellular or extracellular fluids. For many insects chill tolerance is crucial for their ability to persist in cold environments and mounting evidence indicates that chill tolerance is associated with the ability to maintain ion and water homeostasis, thereby ensuring muscular function and preventing chill injury at low temperature. The present study describes the relationship between muscle and haemolymph ion homeostasis and time to regain posture following cold shock (CS, 2 h at -4 degrees C) in the chill-susceptible locust Locusta migratoria. This relationship was examined in animals with and without a prior rapid cold-hardening treatment (RCH, 2 h at 0 degrees C) to investigate the physiological underpinnings of RCH. CS elicited a doubling of haemolymph {[}K+] and this disturbance was greater in locusts pre-exposed to RCH. Recovery of ion homeostasis was, however, markedly faster in RCH-treated animals, which correlated well with whole-organism performance as hardened individuals regained posture faster than non-hardened individuals following CS. The present study indicates that loss and recovery of muscular function are associated with the resting membrane potential of excitable membranes as attested by the changes in the equilibrium potential for K+ (E-K) following CS. Both hardened and non-hardened animals regained movement once K+ homeostasis had recovered to a fixed level (E-K approximate to-41 mV). RCH is therefore not associated with altered sensitivity to ion disturbance but instead is correlated to a faster recovery of haemolymph {[}K+].",2013,216,9,1630-1637
A comparison of thermal sensitivities of wing muscle contractile properties from a temperate and tropical bat species,"Rummel, Andrea D. and Swartz, Sharon M. and Marsh, Richard L. and Faure, Paul A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.243987,"Endotherms experience temperature variation among body regions, or regional heterothermy, despite maintaining high core body temperatures. Bat forelimbs are elongated to function as wings, which makes them vulnerable to heat loss and exaggerates regional heterothermy. A tropical bat species, Carollia perspicillata, flies with distal wing muscles that are substantially (>10 degrees C) cooler than proximal wing muscles and significantly less temperature sensitive. We hypothesized that the difference between proximal and distal wing muscles would be even more extreme in a temperate bat species that is capable of flight at variable environmental temperatures. We measured the contractile properties of the proximal pectoralis muscle and distal extensor carpi radialis muscle at a range of temperatures in the big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, and compared their thermal dependence with that of the same muscles in C. perspicillata. We found that, overall, temperature sensitivities between species were remarkably similar. The sole exception was the shortening velocity of the pectoralis muscle in E. fuscus, which was less temperature sensitive than in C. perspicillata. This decreased temperature sensitivity in a proximal muscle runs counter to our prediction. We suggest that the relative lability of body temperature in E. fuscus may make better pectoralis function at low temperatures advantageous.",2022,225,11,NA
Thermal acclimation offsets the negative effects of nitrate on aerobic scope and performance,"Isaza, Daniel F.

Here, juvenile silver perch (Bidyanus bidyanus) were exposed to current-day summer temperatures (28 degrees C) or a future climate-warming scenario (32 degrees C) and simultaneously exposed to one of three ecologically relevant nitrate concentrations (0, 50 or 100 mg l(-1)). We measured indicators of fish performance (growth, swimming), aerobic scope (AS) and upper thermal tolerance (CTmax) to test the hypothesis that nitrate exposure would increase susceptibility to elevated temperatures and limit thermal compensatory responses. After 8 weeks of acclimation, the thermal sensitivity and plasticity of AS and swimming performance were tested at three test temperatures (28, 32, 36 degrees C). The AS of 28 degrees C-acclimated fish declined with increasing temperature, and the effect was more pronounced in nitrate-exposed individuals. In these fish, declines in AS corresponded with poorer swimming performance and a 0.8 degrees C decrease in CTmax compared with unexposed fish. In contrast, acclimation to 32 degrees C masked the effects of nitrate; fish acclimated to 32 degrees C displayed a thermally insensitive phenotype whereby locomotor performance remained unchanged, AS was maintained and CTmax was increased by 1 degrees C irrespective of nitrate treatment compared with fish acclimated to 28 degrees C. However, growth was markedly reduced in 32 degrees C-acclimated compared with 28 degrees C-acclimated fish. Our results indicate that nitrate exposure increases the susceptibility of fish to acute high temperatures, but thermal compensation can override some of these potentially detrimental effects.",2020,223,16,NA
The impact of metabolic plasticity on winter energy use models,"Roberts, Kevin T. and Williams, Caroline M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.243422,"Understanding the energetic consequences of climate change is critical to identifying organismal vulnerabilities, particularly for dormant organisms relying on finite energy budgets. Ecophysiological energy use models predict long-term energy use from metabolic rate, but we do not know the degree to which plasticity in metabolism impacts estimates. We quantified metabolic rate-temperature relationships of dormant willow leaf beetles (Chrysomela aeneicoths) monthly from February to May under constant and variable acclimation treatments. Metabolic rate increased as diapause progressed, and acclimation to variable conditions altered both metabolic intensity and thermal sensitivity. However, incorporating these two types of metabolic plasticity into energy use models did not improve energy use estimates, validated by empirical measurements of energy stores. While metabolic rate-temperature relationships are plastic during winter, the magnitude of inter-individual variability in energy stores overshadows the effects of incorporating plasticity into energy use models, highlighting the importance of within-population variation in energy reserves.",2022,225,4,NA
Different patterns of chronic hypoxia lead to hierarchical adaptive mechanisms in goldfish metabolism,"Thoral, Elisa and Farhat, Elie and Roussel, Damien and Cheng, Hang and Guillard, Ludovic and Pamenter, Matthew E. and Weber, Jean-Michel and Teulier, Loic",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.243194,"Some hypoxia-tolerant species, such as goldfish, experience intermittent and severe hypoxia in their natural habitat, causing them to develop multiple physiological adaptations.

Therefore, we experimentally tested whether chronic exposure to constant (30 days at 10\% air saturation) or intermittent hypoxia (3 h in normoxia and 21 h in hypoxia, 5 days a week) would result in similar metabolic and swimming performance benefits after reoxygenation. Moreover, half of the normoxic and intermittent hypoxic fish were put on a 20-day normoxic training regime. After these treatments, metabolic rate (standard and maximum metabolic rates: SMR and MMR) and swimming performance {[}critical swimming speed (U-crit) and cost of transport (COT)] were assessed. In addition, enzyme activities {[}citrate synthase (CS), cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)] and mitochondrial respiration were examined in red musde fibres. We found that acclimation to constant hypoxia resulted in (1) metabolic suppression (-45\% SMR and -27\% MMR), (2) increased anaerobic capacity (+117\% LDH), (3) improved swimming performance (+80\% U-crit, -71\% COT) and (4) no changes at the mitochondrial level. Conversely, the enhancement of swimming performance was reduced following acclimation to intermittent hypoxia (+45\% U-crit -41\% COT), with a 55\% decrease in aerobic scope, despite a significant increase in oxidative metabolism (+201\% COX, +49\% CS). This study demonstrates that constant hypoxia leads to the greatest benefit in swimming performance and that mitochondrial metabolic adjustments only provide minor help in coping with hypoxia.",2022,225,1,NA

We addressed these questions using experimental heat waves with larvae of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. The experiments used diurnally fluctuating temperature treatments differing in the number (0-3) and developmental timing (early, middle and/or late in larval development) of heat waves, in which a single heat wave involved three consecutive days with a daily maximum temperature of 42 degrees C. Survival to pupation declined with increasing number of heat waves. Multiple (but not single) heat waves significantly reduced development time and pupal mass; the best models for the data indicated that both the number and developmental timing of heat waves affected performance.

Cold-hearted bats: uncoupling of heart rate and metabolism during torpor at sub-zero temperatures,"Currie, Shannon E. and Stawski, Clare and Geiser, Fritz",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.170894,"Many hibernating animals thermoregulate during torpor and defend their body temperature (T-b) near 0 degrees C by an increase in metabolic rate. Above a critical temperature (T-crit), animals usually thermoconform. We investigated the physiological responses above and below Tcrit for a small tree-dwelling bat (Chalinolobus gouldii, similar to 14 g) that is often exposed to sub-zero temperatures during winter. Through simultaneous measurement of heart rate (f(H)) and oxygen consumption <(V)over dot>(O2), we show that the relationship between oxygen transport and cardiac function is substantially altered in thermoregulating torpid bats between 1 and -2 degrees C, compared with thermoconforming torpid bats at mild ambient temperatures (T-a 5-20 degrees C). T-crit for this species was at a T-a of 0.7 +/- 0.4 degrees C, with a corresponding T-b of 1.8 +/- 1.2 degrees C. Below T-crit, animals began to thermoregulate, as indicated by a considerable but disproportionate increase in both f(H) and <(V)over dot>(O2). The maximum increase in fH was only 4-fold greater than the average thermoconforming minimum, compared with a 46-fold increase in <(V)over dot>(O2). The differential response of fH and <(V)over dot>(O2) to low T-a was reflected in a 15-fold increase in oxygen delivery per heart beat (cardiac oxygen pulse). During torpor at low T-a, thermoregulating bats maintained a relatively slow f(H) and compensated for increased metabolic demands by significantly increasing stroke volume and tissue oxygen extraction. Our study provides new information on the relationship between metabolism and f(H) in an unstudied physiological state that may occur frequently in the wild and can be extremely costly for heterothermic animals.",2018,221,1,NA
Effects of heat acclimation on cardiac function in the intertidal mussel <i>Mytilus californianus</i>: can laboratory-based indices predict survival in the field?,"Moyen, Nicole E. and Somero, George N. and Denny, Mark W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.243050,"Thermal performance curves are commonly used to investigate the effects of heat acclimation on thermal tolerance and physiological performance. However, recent work indicates that the metrics of these curves heavily depend on experimental design and may be poor predictors of animal survival during heat events in the field. In intertidal mussels, cardiac thermal performance (CTP) tests have been widely used as indicators of animals' acclimation or acclimatization state, providing two indices of thermal responses: critical temperature (T-crit ; the temperature above which heart rate abruptly declines) and flatline temperature (T-flat; the temperature where heart rate ceases). Despite the wide use of CTP tests, it remains largely unknown how T-crit and T-flat change within a single individual after heat acclimation, and whether changes in these indices can predict altered survival in the field. Here, we addressed these issues by evaluating changes in CTP indices in the same individuals before and after heat acclimation. For control mussels, merely reaching T-crit was not lethal, whereas remaining at T-crit for >= 10 min was lethal. Heat acclimation significantly increased Tcrit only in mussels with an initially low T-crit (<35 degrees C), but improved their survival time above T-crit by 20 min on average. T-flat increased by similar to 1.6 degrees C with heat acclimation, but it is unlikely that increased Tflat improves survival in the field. In summary, T-crit and T-flat per se may fall short of providing quantitative indices of thermal tolerance in mussels; instead, a combination of T-crit and tolerance time at temperatures =T-crit better defines changes in thermal tolerance with heat acclimation.",2022,225,9,NA
Developmental effects of heatwave conditions on the early life stages of a coral reef fish,"Spinks, Rachel K. and Munday, Philip L. and Donelson, Jennifer M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.202713,"Marine heatwaves, which are increasing in frequency, duration and intensity owing to climate change, are an imminent threat to marine ecosystems. On coral reefs, heatwave conditions often coincide with periods of peak recruitment of juvenile fishes and exposure to elevated temperature may affect their development. However, whether differences in the duration of high temperature exposure have effects on individual performance is unknown. We exposed juvenile spiny damselfish, Acanthochromis poiyacanthus, to increasing lengths of time (3, 7, 30 and 108 days post-hatching) of elevated temperature (+2 degrees C). After 108 days, we measured escape performance at present-day control and elevated temperatures, standard length, mass and critical thermal maximum. Using a Bayesian approach, we show that 30 days or more exposure to +2 degrees C leads to improved escape performance, irrespective of performance temperature, possibly owing to developmental effects of high temperature on muscle development and/or anaerobic metabolism. Continued exposure to elevated temperature for 108 days caused a reduction in body size compared with the control, but not in fish exposed to high temperature for 30 days or less. By contrast, exposure to elevated temperatures for any length of time had no effect on critical thermal maximum, which, combined with previous work, suggests a short-term physiological constraint of similar to 37 degrees C in this species. Our study shows that extended exposure to increased temperature can affect the development of juvenile fishes, with potential immediate and future consequences for individual performance.",2019,222,16,NA
Flies developed small bodies and small cells in warm and in thermally fluctuating environments,"Czarnoleski, Marcin and Cooper, Brandon S. and Kierat, Justyna and Angilletta, Jr., Michael J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.083535,"Although plasma membranes benefit cells by regulating the flux of materials to and from the environment, these membranes cost energy to maintain. Because smaller cells provide relatively more membrane area for transport, ectotherms that develop in warm environments should consist of small cells despite the energetic cost. Effects of constant temperatures on cell size qualitatively match this prediction, but effects of thermal fluctuations on cell size are unknown. Thermal fluctuations could favour either small or large cells; small cells facilitate transport during peaks in metabolic demand whereas large cells minimize the resources needed for homeoviscous adaptation. To explore this problem, we examined effects of thermal fluctuations during development on the size of epidermal cells in the wings of Drosophila melanogaster. Flies derived from a temperate population were raised at two mean temperatures (18 and 25 degrees C), with either no variation or a daily variation of +/- 4 degrees C. Flies developed faster at a mean temperature of 25 degrees C. Thermal fluctuations sped development, but only at 18 degrees C. An increase in the mean and variance of temperature caused flies to develop smaller cells and wings. Thermal fluctuations reduced the size of males at 18 degrees C and the size of females at 25 degrees C. The thorax, the wings and the cells decreased with an increase in the mean and in the variance of temperature, but the response of cells was the strongest. Based on this pattern, we hypothesize that development of the greater area of membranes under thermal fluctuations provides a metabolic advantage that outweighs the greater energetic cost of remodelling membranes.",2013,216,15,2896-2901

Among these, age contributes an important source of variation. Heat tolerance is typically high in newly eclosed insects, before declining dramatically. It is not known whether this phenomenon relates to cold tolerance also. In addition, the underlying mechanisms of this variation are unresolved. In this study, we tested whether cold tolerance declines in Drosophila melanogaster females aged from 0 to 5. days. We also assessed whether expression (basal and induced) of eight stress genes (hsp22, hsp23, hsp40, hsp68, hsp70Aa, hsp83, Starvin and Frost) varied post-eclosion in correspondence with changes found in cold tolerance. We report that cold tolerance was very high at eclosion and then it rapidly declined in young flies. hsp23 and hsp68 showed a dramatic age-related variation of basal expression that was associated with cold tolerance proxies. Significant age-related plasticity of cold-induced expression was also found for hsp22, hsp23, hsp68, hsp70Aa, Frost and Starvin. Induced expression of hsp22 and hsp70Aa was high in newly enclosed phenotypes before declining dramatically, whilst opposite age-related patterns were found for hsp23, hsp68, Starvin and Frost. This study shows a marked within-stage variation in cold tolerance. The involvement of the stress genes in setting basal thermal tolerance is discussed.",2013,216,2,253-259

C. and Thomson, Jack S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.244662,"As climate change -induced heatwaves become more common, phenotypic plasticity at multiple levels is a key mitigation strategy by which organisms can optimise selective outcomes. In ectotherms, changes to both metabolism and behaviour can help alleviate thermal stress. Nonetheless, no study in any ectotherm has yet empirically investigated how changing temperatures affect among -individual differences in the associations between these traits. Using the beadlet anemone (Actinia equina), an intertidal species from a thermally heterogeneous environment, we investigated how individual metabolic rates, linked to morphotypic differences in A. equina, and boldness were related across changing temperatures. A crossed -over design and a temporal control were used to test the same individuals at a non -stressful temperature, 13 degrees C, and under a simulated heatwave at 21 degrees C. At each temperature, short-term repeated measurements of routine metabolic rate (RMR) and a single measurement of a repeatable boldness -related behaviour, immersion response time (IRT), were made. Individual differences, but not morphotypic differences, were highly predictive of metabolic plasticity, and the plasticity of RMR was associated with IRT. At 13 degrees C, shy animals had the highest metabolic rates, while at 21 degrees C, this relationship was reversed. Individuals that were bold at 13 degrees C also exhibited the highest metabolic rates at 21 degrees C. Additional metabolic challenges during heatwaves could be detrimental to fitness in bold individuals. Equally, lower metabolic rates at non -stressful temperatures could be necessary for optimal survival as heatwaves become more common. These results provide novel insight into the relationship between metabolic and behavioural plasticity, and its adaptive implications in a changing climate.",2024,227,3,NA
Cardiophysiological responses of the air-breathing Alaska blackfish to cold acclimation and chronic hypoxic submergence at 5°C,"Stecyk, Jonathan A. W. and Couturier, Christine S. and Abramochkin, V, Denis and Hall, Diarmid and Arrant-Howell, Asia and Kubly, Kerry L. and Lockmann, Shyanne and Logue, Kyle and Trueblood, Lenett and Swalling, Connor and Pinard, Jessica and Vogt, Angela",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.225730,"The Alaska blackfish (Dallia pectoralis) remains active at cold temperatures when experiencing aquatic hypoxia without air access. To discern the cardiophysiological adjustments that permit this behaviour, we quantified the effect of acclimation from 15 degrees C to 5 degrees C in normoxia (15N and 5N fish), as well as chronic hypoxic submergence (6-8 weeks; similar to 6.3-8.4 kPa; no air access) at 5 degrees C (5H fish), on in vivo and spontaneous heart rate (f(H)), electrocardiogram, ventricular action potential (AP) shape and duration (APD), the background inward rectifier (I-K1) and rapid delayed rectifier (I-Kr) K+ currents and ventricular gene expression of proteins involved in excitation-contraction coupling. In vivo f(H) was similar to 50\% slower in 5N than in 15N fish, but 5H fish did not display hypoxic bradycardia. Atypically, cold acclimation in normoxia did not induce shortening of APD or alter resting membrane potential. Rather, QT interval and APD were similar to 2.6-fold longer in 5N than in 15N fish because outward I-K1 and I-Kr were not upregulated in 5N fish. By contrast, chronic hypoxic submergence elicited a shortening of QT interval and APD, driven by an upregulation of I-Kr. The altered electrophysiology of 5H fish was accompanied by increased gene expression of kcnh6 (3.5-fold; K(v)11.2 of I-Kr), kcnj12 (7.4-fold; K(ir)2.2 of I-K1) and kcnj14 (2.9-fold; K(ir)2.4 of I-K1). 5H fish also exhibited a unique gene expression pattern that suggests modification of ventricular Ca2+ cycling. Overall, the findings reveal that Alaska blackfish exposed to chronic hypoxic submergence prioritize the continuation of cardiac performance to support an active lifestyle over reducing cardiac ATP demand.",2020,223,22,NA
Circulatory mechanisms underlying adaptive increases in thermogenic capacity in high-altitude deer mice,"Tate, Kevin B. and Ivy, Catherine M. and Velotta, Jonathan P. and Storz, Jay F. and McClelland, Grant B. and Cheviron, Zachary A. and Scott, Graham R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.164491,"We examined the circulatory mechanisms underlying adaptive increases in thermogenic capacity in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) native to the cold hypoxic environment at high altitudes. Deer mice from high-and low-altitude populations were born and raised in captivity to adulthood, and then acclimated to normoxia or hypobaric hypoxia (simulating hypoxia at similar to 4300 m). Thermogenic capacity {[}maximal O-2 consumption (V-O2,V-max), during cold exposure] was measured in hypoxia, along with arterial O-2 saturation (SaO(2)) and heart rate (f(H)). Hypoxia acclimation increased V-O2,V-max by a greater magnitude in highlanders than in lowlanders. Highlanders also had higher SaO(2) and extracted more O-2 from the blood per heartbeat (O-2 pulse=V-O2,V-max/f(H)). Hypoxia acclimation increased fH, O-2 pulse and capillary density in the left ventricle of the heart. Our results suggest that adaptive increases in thermogenic capacity involve integrated functional changes across the O-2 cascade that augment O-2 circulation and extraction from the blood.",2017,220,20,3616-3620
Cold acclimation improves chill tolerance in the migratory locust through preservation of ion balance and membrane potential,"Andersen, Mads Kuhlmann and Folkersen, Rasmus and MacMillan, Heath A. and Overgaard, Johannes",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.150813,"Most insects have the ability to alter their cold tolerance in response to temporal temperature fluctuations, and recent studies have shown that insect cold tolerance is closely tied to the ability to maintain transmembrane ion gradients that are important for the maintenance of cell membrane potential (V-m). Several studies have therefore suggested a link between preservation of V-m and cellular survival after cold stress, but none has measured V-m in this context. We tested this hypothesis by acclimating locusts (Locusta migratoria) to high (31 degrees C) and low temperature (11 degrees C) for 4 days before exposing them to cold stress (0 degrees C) for up to 48 h and subsequently measuring ion balance, cell survival, muscle V-m, and whole animal performance. Cold stress caused gradual muscle cell death, which coincided with a loss of ion balance and depolarization of muscle V-m. The loss of ion balance and cell polarization were, however, dampened markedly in cold-acclimated locusts such that the development of chill injury was reduced. To further examine the association between cellular injury and V-m we exposed in vitro muscle preparations to cold buffers with low, intermediate, or high {[}K+]. These experiments revealed that cellular injury during cold exposure occurs when V-m becomes severely depolarized. Interestingly, we found that cellular sensitivity to hypothermic hyperkalaemia was lower in cold-acclimated locusts that were better able to defend V-m whilst exposed to high extracellular {[}K+]. Together these results demonstrate a mechanism of cold acclimation in locusts that improves survival after cold stress: increased cold tolerance is accomplished by preservation of V-m through maintenance of ion homeostasis and decreased K+ sensitivity.",2017,220,3,487-496
Trans-generational plasticity in physiological thermal tolerance is modulated by maternal pre-reproductive environment in the polychaete <i>Ophryotrocha labronica</i>,"Massamba-N'Siala, Gloria and Prevedelli, Daniela and Simonini, Roberto",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.094474,"Maternal temperature is known to affect many aspects of offspring phenotype, but its effect on offspring physiological thermal tolerance has received less attention, despite the importance of physiological traits in defining organismal ability to cope with temperature changes. To fill this gap, we used the marine polychaete Ophryotrocha labronica to investigate the influence of maternal temperature on offspring upper and lower thermal tolerance limits, and assess whether maternal influence changed according to the stage of offspring pre-zygotic development at which a thermal cue was provided. Measurements were taken on adult offspring acclimated to 18 or 30 degrees C, produced by mothers previously reared at 24 degrees C and then exposed to 18 or 30 degrees C at an early and late stage of oogenesis. When the shift from 24 degrees C was provided early during oogenesis, mothers produced offspring with greater cold and heat tolerance whenever mother-offspring temperatures did not match, with respect to when they matched, suggesting the presence of an anticipatory maternal effect triggered by the thermal variation. Conversely, when the cue was provided later during oogenesis, more tolerant offspring were observed when temperatures persisted across generations. In this case, maternal exposure to 18 or 30 degrees C may have benefited offspring performance, while limitations in the transmission of the thermal cue may account for the lack of correlation between maternal experiences and offspring performance when mother-offspring environments did not match. Our results provided evidence for a trans-generational effect of temperature on physiological performance characterised by a high context dependency, and are discussed in the light of maternal pre-reproductive experiences.",2014,217,11,2004-2012

H. and Blasco, Felipe R. and Rodde, Charles and Vergnet, Alain and Allal, Francois and Vandeputte, Marc and McKenzie, David J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.245210,"Eight juvenile European seabass were exposed to two thermal ramping protocols with different levels of aerobic activity and tolerance endpoint: the critical thermal maximum for swimming (CTSmax) while exercising aerobically until fatigue and the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) under static conditions until loss of equilibrium (LOE). In the CTSmax protocol, warming caused a profound increase in the rate of oxygen uptake (M?O2), culminating in a gait transition from steady aerobic towards unsteady anaerobic swimming, then fatigue at 30.3 \& PLUSMN;0.4 \& DEG;C (mean \& PLUSMN;s.e.m.). Gait transition and fatigue presumably indicate an oxygen limitation, which reflects the inability to meet the combined demands of swimming plus warming. The CTmax protocol also elicited an increase in M?O2, culminating in LOE at 34.0 \& PLUSMN;0.4 \& DEG;C, which is significantly warmer than fatigue at CTSmax. The maximum M?O2 achieved in the CTmax protocol was, however, less than 30\% of that achieved in the CTSmax protocol. Therefore, the static CTmax did not exploit full cardiorespiratory capacity for oxygen supply, indicating that LOE was not caused by systemic oxygen limitation. Consequently, systemic oxygen supply can be significant for tolerance of acute warming in seabass but this depends upon the physiological context and the endpoint used.",2023,226,11,NA
Rapid proteomic responses to a near-lethal heat stress in the salt marsh mussel <i>Geukensia demissa</i>,"Fields, Peter A. and Burmester, Elizabeth M. and Cox, Kelly M. and Karch, Kelly R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.141176,"Acute heat stress perturbs cellular function on a variety of levels, leading to protein dysfunction and aggregation, oxidative stress and loss of metabolic homeostasis. If these challenges are not overcome quickly, the stressed organism can die. To better understand the earliest tissue-level responses to heat stress, we examined the proteomic response of gill from Geukensia demissa, an extremely eurythermal mussel from the temperate intertidal zone of eastern North America. We exposed 15 degrees C-acclimated individuals to an acute near-lethal heat stress (45 degrees C) for 1 h, and collected gill samples from 0 to 24 h of recovery. The changes in protein expression we found reveal a coordinated physiological response to acute heat stress: proteins associated with apoptotic processes were increased in abundance during the stress itself (i.e. at 0 h of recovery), while protein chaperones and foldases increased in abundance soon after (3 h). The greatest number of proteins changed abundance at 6 h; these included oxidative stress proteins and enzymes of energy metabolism. Proteins associated with the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix also changed in abundance starting at 6 h, providing evidence of cell proliferation, migration and tissue remodeling. By 12 h, the response to acute heat stress was diminishing, with fewer stress and structural proteins changing in abundance. Finally, the proteins with altered abundances identified at 24 h suggest a return to the pre-stress anabolic state.",2016,219,17,2673-2686
Reproductive fitness of <i>Drosophila</i> is maximised by optimal developmental temperature,"Klepsatel, Peter and Girish, Thirnahalli Nagaraj and Dircksen, Heinrich and Galikova, Martina",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.202184,"Whether the character of developmental plasticity is adaptive or non-adaptive has often been a matter of controversy. Although thermal developmental plasticity has been studied in Drosophila for several traits, it is not entirely clear how it affects reproductive fitness. We, therefore, investigated how developmental temperature affects reproductive performance (early fecundity and egg-to-adult viability) of wild-caught Drosophila melanogaster. We tested competing hypotheses on the character of developmental thermal plasticity using a full-factorial design with three developmental and adulthood temperatures within the natural thermal range of this species. To account for potential intraspecific differences, we examined flies from tropical (India) and temperate (Slovakia) climate zones. Our results show that flies from both populations raised at an intermediate developmental temperature (25 degrees C) have comparable or higher early fecundity and fertility at all tested adulthood temperatures, while lower (17 degrees C) or higher developmental temperatures (29 degrees C) did not entail any advantage under the tested thermal regimes. Importantly, the superior thermal performance of flies raised at 25 degrees C is apparent even after taking two traits positively associated with reproductive output into account: body size and ovariole number. Thus, in D. melanogaster, development at a given temperature does not necessarily provide any advantage in this thermal environment in terms of reproductive fitness. Our findings strongly support the optimal developmental temperature hypothesis, which states that in different thermal environments, the highest fitness is achieved when an organism is raised at its optimal developmental temperature.",2019,222,10,NA
Naked mole-rats reduce the expression of ATP-dependent but not ATP-independent heat shock proteins in acute hypoxia,"Vu Chau Nguyen and Deck, Courtney A. and Pamenter, Matthew E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.211243,"Naked mole-rats are one of the most hypoxia-tolerant mammals identified, and putatively experience intermittent and severe hypoxia in their underground burrows. Systemic physiological adaptions to hypoxia have begun to be investigated in this species; however, the cellular adaptations that underlie this tolerance remain poorly understood. Hypoxia compromises cellular energy production, and the maintenance of protein integrity when ATP generation is limited poses a major challenge. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are cellular chaperones that are cytoprotective during hypoxia, and we hypothesized that their expression would increase during acute hypoxia in naked mole-rats. To test this hypothesis, we used qPCR and western blot approaches to measure changes in gene and protein expression, respectively, of HSP27, HSP40, HSP70 and HSP90 in the brain, heart, liver and temporalis muscle from naked mole-rats following exposure to normoxia (21\% O-2) or hypoxia (7\% O-2 for 4, 12 or 24 h). Contrary to our expectations, we observed significant global reductions of ATP-dependent HSP70 and HSP90 (83\% and 78\%, respectively) after 24 h of hypoxia. Conversely, the expression of ATP-independent HSP27 and HSP40 proteins remained constant throughout the 24-h hypoxic treatment in brain, heart and muscle. However, with prolonged hypoxia (24 h), the expression of Hsp27 and Hsp40 genes in these tissues was also reduced, suggesting that the protein expression of these chaperones may also eventually decrease in hypoxia. These results suggest that energy conservation is prioritized over cytoprotective protein chaperoning in nakedmole-rat tissues during acute hypoxia. This unique adaptation may help naked mole-rats to minimize energy expenditure while still maintaining proteostasis in hypoxia.",2019,222,22,NA
Species- and tissue-specific differences in ROS metabolism during exposure to hypoxia and hyperoxia plus recovery inmarine sculpins,"Lau, Gigi Y. and Arndt, Sabine and Murphy, Michael P. and Richards, Jeffrey G.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.206896,"Animals that inhabit environments that fluctuate in oxygen must not only contend with disruptions to aerobic metabolism, but also the potential effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The goal of this study was to compare aspects of ROS metabolism in response to O-2 variability (6 h hypoxia or hyperoxia, with subsequent normoxic recovery) in two species of intertidal sculpin fishes (Cottidae, Actinopterygii) that can experience O-2 fluctuations in their natural environment and differ in whole-animal hypoxia tolerance. To assess ROS metabolism, we measured the ratio of glutathione to glutathione disulfide as an indicator of tissue redox environment, MitoP/MitoB ratio to assess in vivo mitochondrial ROS generation, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) for lipid peroxidation, and total oxidative scavenging capacity (TOSC) in the liver, brain and gill. In the brain, the more hypoxia-tolerant Oligocottus maculosus showed large increases in TBARS levels following hypoxia and hyperoxia exposure that were generally not associated with large changes in mitochondrial H2O2. In contrast, the less-tolerant Scorpaenichthys marmoratus showed no significant changes in TBARS or mitochondrial H2O2 in the brain. More moderate increases were observed in the liver and gill of O. maculosus exposed to hypoxia and hyperoxia with normoxic recovery, whereas S. marmoratus had a greater response to O-2 variability in these tissues compared with the brain.

Evolutionary capacity of upper thermal limits: beyond single trait assessments,"Blackburn, Shaun and van Heerwaarden, Belinda and Kellermann, Vanessa and Sgro, Carla M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.099184,"Thermal tolerance is an important factor influencing the distribution of ectotherms, but we still have limited understanding of the ability of species to evolve different thermal limits. Recent studies suggest that species may have limited capacity to evolve higher thermal limits in response to slower, more ecologically relevant rates of warming. However, these conclusions are based on univariate estimates of adaptive capacity. To test these findings within an explicitly multivariate context, we used a paternal half-sibling breeding design to estimate the multivariate evolutionary potential for upper thermal limits in Drosophila melanogaster. We assessed heat tolerance using static (basal and hardened) and ramping assays. Additive genetic variances were significantly different from zero only for the static measures of heat tolerance. Our G matrix analysis revealed that any response to selection for increased heat tolerance will largely be driven by static basal and hardened heat tolerance, with minimal contribution from ramping heat tolerance. These results suggest that the capacity to evolve upper thermal limits in nature may depend on the type of thermal stress experienced.",2014,217,11,1918-1924
Why do insects enter and recover from chill coma? Low temperature and high extracellular potassium compromise muscle function in <i>Locusta migratoria</i>,"Findsen, Anders and Pedersen, Thomas Holm and Petersen, Asbjorn Graver and Nielsen, Ole Baekgaard and Overgaard, Johannes",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.098442,"When exposed to low temperatures, many insect species enter a reversible comatose state (chill coma), which is driven by a failure of neuromuscular function. Chill coma and chill coma recovery have been associated with a loss and recovery of ion homeostasis (particularly extracellular {[}K+], {[}K+](o)) and accordingly onset of chill coma has been hypothesized to result from depolarization of membrane potential caused by loss of ion homeostasis. Here, we examined whether onset of chill coma is associated with a disturbance in ion balance by examining the correlation between disruption of ion homeostasis and onset of chill coma in locusts exposed to cold at varying rates of cooling. Chill coma onset temperature changed maximally 1 degrees C under different cooling rates and marked disturbances of ion homeostasis were not observed at any of the cooling rates. In a second set of experiments, we used isolated tibial muscle to determine how temperature and {[}K+](o), independently and together, affect tetanic force production. Tetanic force decreased by 80\% when temperature was reduced from 23 degrees C to 0.5 degrees C, while an increase in {[}K+](o) from 10 mmol l(-1) to 30 mmol l(-1) at 23 degrees C caused a 40\% reduction in force. Combining these two stressors almost abolished force production. Thus, low temperature alone may be responsible for chill coma entry, rather than a disruption of extracellular K+ homeostasis. As {[}K+] also has a large effect on tetanic force production, it is hypothesized that recovery of {[}K+] o following chill coma could be important for the time to recovery of normal neuromuscular function.",2014,217,8,1297-1306
Daily temperature extremes play an important role in predicting thermal effects,"Ma, Gang and Hoffmann, Ary A. and Ma, Chun-Sen",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.122127,"Organisms in natural environments experience diel temperature fluctuations, including sporadic extreme conditions, rather than constant temperatures. Studies based mainly on model organisms have tended to focus on responses to average temperatures or short-term heat stress, which overlooks the potential impact of daily fluctuations, including stressful daytime periods and milder night-time periods. Here, we focus on daily maximum temperatures, while holding night-time temperatures constant, to specifically investigate the effects of high temperature on demographic parameters and fitness in the English grain aphid Sitobion avenae. We then compared the observed effects of different daily maximum temperatures with predictions from constant temperature-performance expectations. Moderate daily maximum temperatures depressed aphid performance while extreme conditions had dramatic effects, even when mean temperatures were below the critical maximum. Predictions based on daily average temperature underestimated negative effects of temperature on performance by ignoring daily maximum temperature, while predictions based on daytime maximum temperatures overestimated detrimental impacts by ignoring recovery under mild night-time temperatures. Our findings suggest that daily maximum temperature will play an important role in regulating natural population dynamics and should be considered in predictions. These findings have implications for natural population dynamics, particularly when considering the expected increase in extreme temperature events under climate change.",2015,218,14,2289-2296
Effects of prolonged anoxia on electrical activity of the heart in crucian carp (<i>Carassius carassius</i>),"Tikkanen, Elisa and Haverinen, Jaakko and Egginton, Stuart and Hassinen, Minna and Vornanen, Matti",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.145177,"The effects of sustained anoxia on cardiac electrical excitability were examined in the anoxia-tolerant crucian carp (Carassius carassius). The electrocardiogram (ECG) and expression of excitationcontraction coupling genes were studied in fish acclimatised to normoxia in summer (+ 18 degrees C) or winter (+ 2 degrees C), and in winter fish after 1, 3 and 6 weeks of anoxia. Anoxia induced a sustained bradycardia from a heart rate of 10.3 +/- 0.77 beats min(-1) to 4.1 +/- 0.29 beats min(-1) (P<0.05) after 5 weeks, and heart rate slowly recovered to control levels when oxygen was restored. Heart rate variability greatly increased under anoxia, and completely recovered under reoxygenation. The RT interval increased from 2.8 +/- 0.34 s in normoxia to 5.8 +/- 0.44 s under anoxia (P<0.05), which reflects a doubling of the ventricular action potential (AP) duration. Acclimatisation to winter induced extensive changes in gene expression relative to summer-acclimatised fish, including depression in those genes coding for the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump (Serca2a\_q2) and ATP-sensitive K+ channels (Kir6.2) (P<0.05). Genes of delayed rectifier K+ (kcnh6) and Ca2+ channels (cacna1c) were up-regulated in winter fish (P<0.05). In contrast, the additional challenge of anoxia caused only minor changes in gene expression, e. g. depressed expression of Kir2.2b K+ channel gene (kcnj12b), whereas expression of Ca2+ (cacna1a, cacna1c and cacna1g) and Na+ channel genes (scn4a and scn5a) was not affected. These data suggest that low temperature pre-conditions the crucian carp heart for winter anoxia, whereas sustained anoxic bradycardia and prolongation of AP duration are directly induced by oxygen shortage without major changes in gene expression.",2017,220,3,445-454
"Aerobic scope does matter in the temperature-size rule, but only under optimal conditions","Walczynska, Aleksandra and Sobczyk, Mateusz",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.242884,"We united theoretical predictions of the factors responsible for the evolutionary significance of the temperature-size rule (TSR). We assumed that (i) the TSR is a response to temperature-dependent oxic conditions, (ii) body size decrease is a consequence of cell shrinkage in response to hypoxia, (iii) this response enables organisms to maintain a wide scope for aerobic performance, and (iv) it prevents a decrease in fitness. We examined three clones of the rotifer Lecane inermis exposed to three experimental regimes: mild hypoxia, severe hypoxia driven by too high of a temperature, and severe hypoxia driven by an inadequate oxygen concentration. We compared the following traits in normoxia- and hypoxia-exposed rotifers: nuclear size (a proxy for cell size), body size, specific dynamic action (SDA, a proxy of aerobic metabolism) and two fitness measures, the population growth rate and eggs/female ratio. The results showed that (i) under mildly hypoxic conditions, our causative reasoning was correct, except that one of the clones decreased in body size without a decrease in nuclear size, and (ii) in more stressful environments, rotifers exhibited clone- and condition-specific responses, which were equally successful in terms of fitness levels. Our results indicate the importance of the testing conditions. The important conclusions were that (i) a body size decrease at higher temperatures enabled the maintenance of a wide aerobic scope under clone-specific, thermally optimal conditions, and (ii) this response was not the only option to prevent fitness reduction under hypoxia.",2021,224,23,NA
Mitochondrial physiology and reactive oxygen species production are altered by hypoxia acclimation in killifish (<i>Fundulus</i> <i>heteroclitus</i>),"Du, Sherry N.

We investigated the effects of hypoxia acclimation on mitochondrial respiration, O-2 kinetics, emission of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and antioxidant capacity in the estuarine killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus). Killifish were acclimated to normoxia, constant hypoxia (5 kPa O-2) or intermittent diel cycles of nocturnal hypoxia (12 h: 12 h normoxia: hypoxia) for 28-33 days and mitochondria were isolated from liver. Neither pattern of hypoxia acclimation affected the respiratory capacities for oxidative phosphorylation or electron transport, leak respiration, coupling control or phosphorylation efficiency. Hypoxia acclimation also had no effect on mitochondrial O-2 kinetics, but P-50 (the O2 tension at which hypoxia inhibits respiration by 50\%) was lower in the leak state than during maximal respiration, and killifish mitochondria endured anoxia-reoxygenation without any impact on mitochondrial respiration. However, both patterns of hypoxia acclimation reduced the rate of ROS emission from mitochondria when compared at a common O-2 tension. Hypoxia acclimation also increased the levels of protein carbonyls and the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase in liver tissue (the latter only occurred in constant hypoxia). Our results suggest that hypoxia acclimation is associated with changes in mitochondrial physiology that decrease ROS production and may help improve hypoxia tolerance.",2016,219,8,1130-1138
"Temperature and photoperiod as environmental cues affect body mass and thermoregulation in Chinese bulbuls, <i>Pycnonotus sinensis</i>","Hu, Shi-Nan and Zhu, Ying-Yang and Lin, Lin and Zheng, Wei-Hong and Liu, Jin-Song",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.143842,"Seasonal changes in temperature and photoperiod are important environmental cues used by small birds to adjust their body mass (M-b) and thermogenesis. However, the relative importance of these cues with respect to seasonal adjustments in M-b and thermogenesis is difficult to distinguish. In particular, the effects of temperature and photoperiod on energy metabolism and thermoregulation are not well known in many passerines. To address this problem, we measured the effects of temperature and photoperiod on M-b, energy intake, resting metabolic rate (RMR), organ mass and physiological and biochemical markers of metabolic activity in the Chinese bulbul (Pycnonotus sinensis). Groups of Chinese bulbuls were acclimated in a laboratory to the following conditions: (1) warm and long photoperiod, (2) warm and short photoperiod, (3) cold and long photoperiod, and (4) cold and short photoperiod, for 4 weeks. The results indicate that Chinese bulbuls exhibit adaptive physiological regulation when exposed to different temperatures and photoperiods. M-b, RMR, gross energy intake and digestible energy intake were higher in cold-acclimated than in warm-acclimated bulbuls, and in the short photoperiod than in the long photoperiod. The resultant flexibility in energy intake and RMR allows Chinese bulbuls exposed to different temperatures and photoperiods to adjust their energy balance and thermogenesis accordingly. Cold-acclimated birds had heightened state-4 respiration and cytochrome c oxidase activity in their liver and muscle tissue compared with warmacclimated birds indicating the cellular mechanisms underlying their adaptive thermogenesis. Temperature appears to be a primary cue for adjusting energy budget and thermogenic ability in Chinese bulbuls; photoperiod appears to intensify temperature-induced changes in energy metabolism and thermoregulation.",2017,220,5,844-855
Higher environmental temperatures promote acceleration of spermatogenesis <i>in</i> <i>vivo</i> in mice (<i>Mus musculus</i>),"Costa, Guilherme M. J. and Lacerda, Samyra M. S.

It is well known that elevated temperatures cause several effects on testicular components, particularly on germ cells, which might lead to the impairment of spermatogenesis and loss of male fertility. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of different environmental temperatures on several morphofunctional testis parameters, with emphasis on duration of spermatogenesis and spermatogenic efficiency. Thirty sexually mature Swiss mice (Mus musculus) were allocated in three different experimental groups, being kept in vivarium for three weeks at 16 degrees C, 23 degrees C (control group) and 32 degrees C. In order to estimate the duration of spermatogenesis, three animals per each group received intraperitoneal injections of tritiated thymidine and the testes were perfused-fixed and routinely processed for histological, morphometrical and immunoperoxidase analyses. Although the lower temperature (16 degrees C) did not change most of the evaluated testicular parameters, our findings showed that higher environmental temperature (32 degrees C) is able to alter important testis parameters, resulting for instance in acceleration of spermatogenesis, alterations in the stages frequencies, increased number of germ and Leydig cells apoptosis and reduced Sertoli cell and spermatogenic efficiencies. As in many conditions infertile men exhibit higher mean scrotal temperature, we believe that experimental studies with mice involving temperature might represent an interesting approach to better understand the mechanisms related to human testis function and sperm production.",2018,77,NA,14-23
Ambient temperatures differently influence colour morphs of the leaf beetle <i>Chrysomela lapponica</i>: Roles of thermal melanism and developmental plasticity,"Zverev, Vitali and Kozlov, V, Mikhail and Forsman, Anders and Zvereva, Elena L.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.03.019,"We asked whether ambient temperatures can affect morph frequencies within a subarctic population of the polymorphic leaf beetle Chrysomela lapponica through thermal melanism and/or developmental plasticity. Body temperature increased faster in beetles of dark morph than in beetles of light morph under exposure to artificial irradiation. Dark males ran faster than light males in both field and laboratory experiments, and this difference decreased with increasing ambient air temperature, from significant at 10 degrees C to non-significant at 20 degrees C and 26 degrees C. On cold days (6-14 degrees C), significantly more dark males than light males were found on their host plants in copula (40.8\% and 27.3\% respectively); on warm days (15-22 degrees C) this difference disappeared. Light females produced twice as many eggs as dark females; this difference did not depend on the ambient temperature. The proportion of dark morphs in the progenies of pairs with one dark parent was twice as high as that in the progenies of pairs in which both parents were light, and this proportion was greater when larvae developed at low (10 and 15 degrees C) than at high (20 and 25 degrees C) temperatures. We conclude that low temperatures may increase the frequencies of dark morphs in degrees C. lapponica populations due to both the mating advantages of dark males over light males and developmental plasticity. Variation in frequencies of low-fecund dark morphs in the population, caused by among-year differences in temperature together with density-dependent selection, may contribute to the evolutionary dynamics of the colour polymorphism and may influence abundance fluctuations in these leaf beetle populations.",2018,74,NA,100-109

The RR of the HS cows increased immediately after exposure to heat and was higher (76.02 +/- 1.70 bpm, p < 0.001) than in the TN (39.70 +/- 0.71 bpm). An increase in Tre (39.87 +/- 0.07 degrees C in the HS vs. 38.56 +/- 0.03 degrees C in the TN, p < 0.001) and in VT (39.82 +/- 0.10 degrees C in the HS vs. 38.26 +/- 0.03 degrees C in the TN, p < 0.001) followed the increase in RR. A decrease (p < 0.05) in HR occurred in the HS (62.13 +/- 0.99 bpm) compared with the TN (66.23 +/- 0.79 bpm); however, the magnitude of the differences was not the same over time. The DMI was lower in HS cows from the third day (8.27 +/- 0.33 kg d(-1) in the HS vs. 14.03 +/- 0.29 kg d(-1) in the TN, p < 0.001), and the reduction of DMI was strongly affected (r= -0.65) by changes in the temperature humidity index. The effect of environmental variables from the previous day on physiological parameters and DMI was more important than the immediate effect, and ambient temperature represented the most determinant factor for heat exchange. The difference in the responses to acute and chronic exposure to HS suggests an adaptive response. Thus, intense thermal stress strongly influence thermoregulatory mechanisms and the acclimation process depend critically on heat exposure time.",2017,66,NA,68-80
Changes in systolic arterial pressure variability are associated with the decreased aerobic performance of rats subjected to physical exercise in the heat,"Mueller-Ribeiro, Flavia C. and Wanner, Samuel P. and Santos, Weslley H. M. and Malheiros-Lima, Milene R. and Fonseca, Ivana A. T. and Coimbra, Candido C. and Pires, Washington",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.11.006,"Enhanced cardiovascular strain is one of the factors that explains degraded aerobic capacity in hot environments. The cardiovascular system is regulated by the autonomic nervous system, whose activity can be indirectly evaluated by analyzing heart rate variability (HRV) and systolic arterial pressure (SAP) variability. However, no study has addressed whether HRV or SAP variability can predict aerobic performance during a single bout of exercise. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether there is an association between cardiovascular variability and performance in rats subjected to treadmill running at two ambient temperatures. In addition, this study investigated whether the heat-induced changes in cardiovascular variability and reductions in performance are associated with each other. Male Wistar rats were implanted with a catheter into their carotid artery for pulsatile blood pressure recordings. After recovery from surgery, the animals were subjected to incremental-speed exercise until they were fatigued under temperate (25 degrees C) and hot (35 degrees C) conditions. Impaired performance and exaggerated cardiovascular responses were observed in the hot relative to the temperate environment. Significant and negative correlations between most of the SAP variability components (standard deviation, variance, very low frequency {[}VLF], and low frequency [}LF]) at the earlier stages of exercise and total exercise time were observed in both environmental conditions. Furthermore, the heat-induced changes in the sympathetic components of SAP variability (VLF and LF) were associated with heat-induced impairments in performance. Overall, the results indicate that SAP variability at the beginning of exercise predicts the acute performance of rats. Our findings also suggest that heat impairments in aerobic performance are associated with changes in cardiovascular autonomic control.",2017,63,NA,31-40
A protocol for analysing thermal stress in insects using infrared thermography,"Gallego, Belen and Verdu, Jose R. and Carrascal, Luis M. and Lobo, Jorge M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2015.12.006,"The study of insect responses to thermal stress has involved a variety of protocols and methodologies that hamper the ability to compare results between studies. For that reason, the development of a protocol to standardize thermal assays is necessary. In this sense, infrared thermography solves some of the problems allowing us to take continuous temperature measurements without handling the individuals, an important fact in cold-blooded organisms like insects. Here, we present a working protocol based on infrared thermography to estimate both cold and heat thermal stress in insects. We analyse both the change in the body temperature of individuals and their behavioural response. In addition, we used partial least squares regression for the statistical analysis of our data, a technique that solves the problem of having a large number of variables and few individuals, allowing us to work with rare or endemic species. To test our protocol, we chose two species of congeneric, narrowly distributed dung beetles that are endemic to the southeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula. With our protocol we have obtained five variables in the response to cold and twelve in the response to heat. With this methodology we discriminate between the two flightless species of Jekelius through their thermal response. In response to cold, Jekelius hernandezi showed a higher rate of cooling and reached higher temperatures of stupor and haemolymph freezing than Jekelius punctatolineatus. Both species displayed similar thermoregulation ranges before reaching lethal body temperature with heat stress. Overall, we have demonstrated that infrared thermography is a suitable method to assess insect thermal responses with a high degree of sensitivity, allowing for the discrimination between closely related species.

Repeated thermal stressor causes chronic elevation of baseline corticosterone and suppresses the physiological endocrine sensitivity to acute stressor in the cane toad (<i>Rhinella marina</i>),"Narayan, Edward J. and Hero, Jean-Marc",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2014.02.011,"Extreme environmental temperature could impact the physiology and ecology of animals. The stress endocrine axis provides necessary physiological stress response to acute (day-day) stressors. Presently, there are no empirical evidences showing that exposure to extreme thermal stressor could cause chronic stress in amphibians. This could also modulate the physiological endocrine sensitivity to acute stressors and have serious implications for stress coping in amphibians, particularly those living in fragmented and disease prone environments. We addressed this important question using the cane toad (Rhinella marina) model from its introduced range in Queensland, Australia. We quantified their physiological endocrine sensitivity to a standard acute (capture and handling) stressor after exposing the cane toads to thermal shock at 35 degrees C for 30 min daily for 34 days. Corticosterone (CORT) responses to the capture and handling protocol were measured on three sampling intervals (days 14, 24, and 34) to determine whether the physiological endocrine sensitivity was maintained or modulated over-time. Two control groups (Cl for baseline CORT measurement only and C2 acute handled only) and two temperature treatment groups (T1 received daily thermal shock up to day 14 only and a recovery phase of 20 days and T2 received thermal shock daily for 34 days). Results showed that baseline CORT levels remained high on day 14 (combined effect of capture, captivity and thermal stress) for both T1 and T2. Furthermore, baseline CORT levels decreased for T1 once the thermal shock was removed after day 14 and returned to baseline by day 29. On the contrary, baseline CORT levels kept on increasing for T2 over the 34 days of daily thermal shocks. Furthermore, the magnitudes of the acute CORT responses or physiological endocrine sensitivity were consistently high for both Cl and T1. However, acute CORT responses for T2 toads were dramatically reduced between days 24 and 34. These novel findings suggest that repeated exposure to extreme thermal stressor could cause chronic stress and consequently suppress the physiological endocrine sensitivity to acute stressors (e.g. pathogenic diseases) in amphibians.

Physiological and biochemical thermoregulatory responses of Chinese bulbuls <i>Pycnonotus sinensis</i> to warm temperature: Phenotypic flexibility in a small passerine,"Zheng, Wei-Hong and Lin, Lin and Liu, Jin-Song and Pan, Hao and Cao, Meng-Ting and Hu, Yi-Lin",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2013.03.003,"Temperature is an important environmental cue for the regulation of thermogenesis in small birds. We tested the hypothesis that a small passerine, the Chinese bulbul Pycnonotus sinensis can decrease thermogenesis in response to warmer temperatures by decreasing body mass, the organ mass and changing physiological and biochemical processes in the liver and muscle. Captive Chinese bulbuls decreased in body mass and basal metabolic rate (BMR) during 4 weeks of acclimation to 30 +/- 1 degrees C They also showed a decrease in liver, kidney and small intestine mass and reduced mitochondrial state-4 respiration and cytochrome C oxidase (COX) activity in the liver and muscle compared to 10 +/- 1 degrees C. Furthermore, BMR was positively correlated with body mass, organ mass (liver, kidney, small intestine and entire digestive tract), and mitochondrial state-4 respiration and cytochrome C oxidase (COX) activity in the liver and muscle. These results indicate that changes in body mass, organ mass and respiratory enzyme activity are mechanisms by which Chinese bulbuls adapt to warmer temperatures. The data support the hypothesis that such physiological flexibility is ubiquitous in birds. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2013,38,5,240-246
"Differential thermal tolerance and energetic trajectories during ontogeny in porcelain crabs, genus <i>Petrolisthes</i>","Miller, Nathan A. and Paganini, Adam W. and Stillman, Jonathon H.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2012.11.005,"Thermal tolerance limits of marine intertidal zone organisms are elevated compared to subtidal species, but are typically just slightly higher than maximal habitat temperatures. The small thermal safety margins maintained by intertidal zone organisms suggest that high thermal tolerance is associated with a physiological cost. If true, we hypothesize that species that transition between intertidal zone and planktonic habitats during ontogeny, will adjust their thermal tolerance accordingly to capitalize upon potential energy savings while in a thermally benign habitat. We tested this hypothesis in porcelain crabs that transition between the thermally stressful, intertidal zone as embryos, to the thermally benign pelagic zone as larvae, and back at settlement. We found the more thermally tolerant, mid-intertidal zone species, Petrolisthes cinctipes, and the less thermally tolerant, subtidal zone species, Petrolisthes manimacilis, exhibited reduced thermal tolerance (LT50) in the transition from embryos to larvae. This was associated with an increased oxygen consumption rate in both species, though P. cinctipes exhibited a significantly greater increase in oxygen consumption. P. cinctipes also showed an increase in thermal tolerance in settled juveniles compared to pelagic zoea I larvae, resulting in an overall V-shaped thermal tolerance relationship during ontogeny, while in P. manimaculis thermal tolerance was significantly lower in juveniles compared to zoea I. In neither species were these changes (zoea I to juvenile) associated with a significant change in metabolism. While embryos and juveniles of P. cinctipes have thermal tolerance limits near intertidal habitat thermal maxima (similar to 32.5 degrees C), all three life-history stages in P. manimaculis (especially embryos and larvae) exhibit considerable thermal safety margins. The mechanisms underlying this ``excess{''} thermal tolerance in P. manimacilis embryos are unknown, but suggest that patterns of thermal tolerance in early life history stages are species-specific.

High temperature induces apoptosis and oxidative stress in pufferfish (<i>Takifugu obscurus</i>) blood cells,"Cheng, Chang-Hong and Yang, Fang-Fang and Liao, Shao-An and Miao, Yu-Tao and Ye, Chao-Xia and Wang, An-Li and Tan, Jia-Wen and Chen, Xiao-Yan",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2015.08.002,"Water temperature is an important environmental factor in aquaculture farming that affects the survival and growth of organisms. The change in culture water temperature may not only modify various chemical and biological processes but also affect the status of fish populations. In previous studies, high temperature induced apoptosis and oxidative stress. However, the precise mechanism and the pathways that are activated in fish are still unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effects of high temperature (34 degrees C) on the induction of apoptosis and oxidative stress in pufferfish (Takifugu obscurus) blood cells. The data showed that high temperature exposure increased oxygen species (ROS), cytoplasmic free-Ca2+ concentration and cell apoptosis. To test the apoptotic pathway, the expression pattern of some key apoptotic related genes including P53, Bax, caspase 9 and caspase 3 were examined. The results showed that acute high temperature stress induced up-regulation of these genes, suggesting that the p53-Bax pathway and the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway could be involved in apoptosis induced by high temperature stress. Furthermore, the gene expression of antioxidant enzymes (Cu/Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD, CAT, GPx, and GR) and heat shock proteins (HSP90 and HSP70) in the blood cells were induced by high temperature stress. Taken together, our results showed that high temperature-induced oxidative stress may cause pufferfish blood cells apoptosis, and cooperatively activated p53-Bax and caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway.

Correlation between heat shock protein 32 and chronic heat-induced liver injury in developing mice,"Li, Cheng-min and Li, Lian and Bai, Jing-yan and Wu, Jie and Huang, Shuai and Wang, Gen-lin",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2013.08.006,"Heat stress is one of a wide variety of factors causing liver injury, a small heat shock protein (HSP), HSP32, is induced by heat stress in the liver. But the biological function of HSP32 in this injury is unclear. To investigate the underlying role of HSP32, RT-PCR, immunocytochemical staining and ELISA were applied to confirm the expression of HSP32. And the underlying mechanism in the pathogenesis of hepatic dysfunction following hyperthermic challenge and the possible involvement of oxidative stress to induce oxidative deterioration of liver functions in developing mice were investigated in this study. Caspase-3mRNA expression and caspase-3 activity of heated liver were also analysed. The results showed that liver injury caused by chronic heat stress(39 C, 1.5 h/day for 6 weeks) was reversible, caspase-3mRNA expression and caspase-3 activity of heat treated mice were increased after the first three weeks of heat exposure (P <0.05) and high expression levels of HSP32 were observed throughout the duration of experiment (P < 0.01). A strong correlation exists between heat-induced liver injury and the induction of HSP32, which suggested that the reversibility of liver injury is involved in the induction of HSP32 in the hepatic cells under continuing heat stress.

In the present work, the strategies used by shrimps to cope with temperature and dissolved oxygen fluctuations during 24 days were investigated through the evaluation of oxygen consumption and heat shock proteins (HSP) gene expression. During daily fluctuations, no change in oxygen consumption in the short-term, but a significant increase in the long-term during hyperthermia conditions was registered, whereas a significant decrease during hypoxia was observed during all the bioassay. On the other hand, HSP70 and HSP90 gene expression increased in gills under thermal stress but was down-regulated under hypoxia, in both the short- and the long-term. This study highlights that to counteract environmental variations of temperature and dissolved oxygen, the shrimps use molecular compensatory mechanisms (HSP gene expression) that are different to those used under constant hypoxic conditions, suggesting that hypoxia can compromise physiological cytoprotection.",2020,92,NA,NA
Cold stress regulates lipid metabolism via AMPK signalling in <i>Cherax quadricarinatus</i>,"Wu, Donglei and Liu, Zhiquan and Yu, Ping and Huang, Youhui and Cai, Mingqi and Zhang, Meng and Zhao, Yunlong",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102693,"Lipids play an important role in protecting poikilotherms from cold stress, but relatively little is known about the regulation of lipid metabolism under cold stress, especially in crustaceans. In the present study, red-clawed crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus was employed as a model organism. Animals were divided into four temperature groups (25, 20, 15 and 9 degrees C) and treated for 4 weeks, with the 25 degrees C group serving as a control. The total lipid content in the hepatopancreas as well as the triglyceride, cholesterol and free fatty acid levels in the hemolymph were determined. Lipids stored in the hepatopancreas and hemolymph decreased with decreasing temperature, with changes in the 9 degrees C group most pronounced, indicating that lipids are the main energy source for crayfish at low temperatures. Furthermore, enzyme activity of lipase, fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and lipoprotein esterase, and gene expression analysis of fatty acid synthase gene, acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene and carnitine palmitoyltransferase gene showed that the digestion, synthesis and oxidation of lipids in the hepatopancreas were inhibited under low temperature stress, but expression of sphingolipid delta-4 desaturase (DEGS) was increased, indicating an increase in the demand for highly unsaturated fatty acids at low temperatures. Analysis of the expression of genes related to the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signalling pathway revealed that the adiponectin receptor gene was rapidly upregulated at low temperatures, which may in turn activate the expression of the downstream AMPK alpha gene, thereby inhibiting lipid anabolism.",2020,92,NA,NA

Therefore, it is important to understand how temperature variation affects lipid metabolism and energy consumption in fish. We determined respiration frequency, Na+/K+-ATPase activity, and lipid metabolism in common carp (Cypritius carpio) after 18 days of temperature stress (5 degrees C and 30 degrees C, with 17 degrees C as the control). We found that respiratory frequency was positively correlated with water temperature (p < 0.01), whereas red blood cell count and mean corpuscular hemoglobin content and concentration were negatively correlated with temperature. In liver and heart, triglyceride (TG) levels were lower in both stress groups (5 degrees C and 30 degrees C) than in the control (17 degrees C) (p < 0.01), and highest in muscle from the high temperature stress group (p < 0.01). The non-esterified fatty acid concentration was negatively correlated with TG levels. In brain, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity decreased with increasing temperature and hepatic lipase (HL) activity was lower in both stress groups than in the control (p < 0.01). In muscle, the activity of LPL and HL was lowest in the high temperature stress group, resulting in a significant increase in TG levels. Na+/K+-ATPase activity in heart was lower in both stress groups than in the control (p < 0.01). The expression of LPL mRNA in heart increased with increasing temperature (p < 0.01), whereas LPL mRNA expression in brain and liver increased in both stress groups (p < 0.01).

Twelve pigs were randomly divided into two groups and separately exposed to the neutral temperature (NT, 25 degrees C) and high temperature (HT, 40 degrees C) for 8 days. The hepatic damage marker, such as total bilirubin (TBIL), alkaline phosphatase (AKP), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidas (gamma-GT), alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartase transminase (AST), didn't reach statistical significance between NT and HT group. Moreover, abnormal observation of hepatic histology and hepatocyte ultrastructure were not detected in HT group. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and catalase (CAT) as well as glutathione (GSH) content, were dramatically increased after heat exposure.

Effect of tidal regime on the thermal tolerance of the marine gastropod <i>Lunella smaragda</i> (Gmelin 1791),"Mortensen, B. J. D. and Dunphy, B. J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.07.009,"The tidal cycle around New Zealand results in spring low tides consistently occurring during the hottest part of the day (mid-afternoon) in north-eastern New Zealand, and during the cooler dawn/dusk periods in the north-west of the country. We hypothesised that due to mid-afternoon spring low tides, intertidal populations residing at north-eastern sites would show greater thermotolerance than their north-west conspecifics. To test this we used the marine gastropod, Lunella smaragda, which were collected from sites on both the East and West coasts of the Auckland region and exposed to an acute heat shock. Thermotolerance was measured as survivorship (LT50), drop down time (time to heat coma) and thermal stability of the anaerobic energy producing enzyme Tauropine dehydrogenase. Furthermore, temperature loggers were deployed at each site so as to record and compare thermal regimes among sites. A strong temperature spike associated with spring low tide was found at all sites, and maximal temperatures of all East coast sites were higher than West coast sites (in some case by up to 10 degrees C). In terms of thermotolerance, mortality of L. smaragda occurred at 42 degrees C leading to 100\% mortality at 45 degrees C. However, comparison of LT50 showed snails were equally thermotolerant regardless of site of collection. Similar results were found in TDH thermal stability with animals from all sites showing an approximately 80\% decrease in enzyme activity after 10 min exposure to 42 degrees C. Whilst drop down times were different among sites these were correlated with animal size as opposed to site of collection. Thus, East coast populations of L. smaragda appear no more thermotolerant than their West coast counterparts. Such a result is concerning as maximal temperatures at East coast sites already exceed the LT50 values of L. smaragda recorded in the lab suggesting these populations have less of a thermal safety margin.

Effect of salinity on the upper lethal temperature tolerance of early-juvenile red drum,"McDonald, Dusty and Bumguardner, Britt and Cason, Paul",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2015.08.004,"Previous work investigating the temperature tolerance of juvenile red drum ranging 18-50 mm TL found evidence for positive size dependence (smaller fish less tolerant to higher temperatures) suggesting smaller size classes ( < 18 mm TL) potentially may succumb to extreme summer water temperatures.

Herein, physiological regulation of C. quadricarinatus was investigated following exposure to low temperature stress at 9 +/- 2 degrees C for 4 weeks. Hepatopancreas tissue was tested for nonspecific enzyme activity, histological structure, and transcriptome sequencing analyses. The results showed that the activities of nonspecific enzymes were inhibited following low temperature stress. Ultrastructural observation revealed that the hepatopancreas structure was oxidatively damaged at low temperature, with numerous autophagic vesicles visible. Apoptosis in the hepatopancreas was significantly increased in the cold stress group, indicating diminished function. Transcriptome sequencing identified 2615 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) following low temperature stress, of which 1147 and 1468 were up- and down-regulated, respectively. Functional analysis of DEGs indicated involvement in substance metabolism, antioxidant defences, signal transduction, and immune responses. Therefore, chronic cold stress can suppress metabolism and cause oxidative damage and immune deficiency in crayfish. The findings provide fundamental molecular information for further study of the regulatory mechanisms of cold tolerance in red claw crayfish.",2019,85,NA,NA
<i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i> Say larva adapts to temperature shock through changes in protein turn over and amino acid catabolism,"Gayathri, R. V. Ayana and Evans, D. A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.03.016,"Exposure of Culex quinquefasciatus larvae to hypothermia or hyperthermia in relation to ecological temperature has resulted in alteration of enzyme activities related to maintenance of free amino acid pool and protein degradation. Sudden changes in water temperature have led to elevation of protein content particularly in molecular weight between 66 and 97.4 kDa. MALDI TOF analysis revealed the presence of putative uncharacterized protein and Phospholipase A2 activating protein in larvae subjected to 40 degrees C for 1 hour which was not found in control and other temperature treated larvae. These proteins may be playing a role in survival of larvae at higher temperatures. Thermal shock has resulted in channeling of free amino acids for protein synthesis and elevation of amino acid catabolism through increased deamination and altered transamination, which resulted in a sharp decrease in free amino acid pool. Inhibition of Leucine amino peptidase and elevation of Cathepsin D, under the influence of thermal shock may be an adaptive response of larvae to prevent unnecessary degradation of protein and at the same time facilitated rapid internal re-organization which may accelerate pupation. Elevated activity of Phenol oxidase and its co-stimulator Trypsin -like Serine protease, along with increased expression of Phospholipase A2 activating protein is a well co-ordinated defense mechanism leading to increased immune response in stressed state. This study assumes significance because variation in environmental conditions such as global warming and their impact on mosquito physiology can influence efficiency of disease vector.",2018,74,NA,149-159
Thermal equilibrium responses in Guzerat cattle raised under tropical conditions,"Camerro, Leandro Zuccherato and Campos Maia, Alex Sandro and Chiquitelli Neto, Marcos and de Melo Costa, Cintia Carol and Castro, Patric Andre",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.07.007,"The literature is very sparse regarding research on the thermal equilibrium in Guzerat cattle (Bos indicus) under field conditions. Some factors can modify the physiological response of Guzerat cattle, such as the reactivity of these animals to handling. Thus, the development of a methodology to condition and select Guzerat cattle to acclimate them to the routine collection of data without altering their physiological response was the objective of the preliminary experiment. Furthermore, the animals selected were used in the main experiment to determine their thermal equilibrium according to the thermal environment. For this proposal, the metabolic heat production and heat exchange between the animal and the environment were measured simultaneously in the field with an indirect calorimetry system coupled to a facial mask. The results of the preliminary experiment showed that the respiratory rate could demonstrate that conditioning efficiently reduced the reactivity of the animals to experimental handling. Furthermore, the respiratory rate can be used to select animals with less reactivity. The results of the main experiment demonstrate that the skin, hair-coat surface and expired air temperature depend on the air temperature, whereas the rectal temperature depends on the time of day; consequently, the sensible heat flow was substantially reduced from 70 to 20 when the air temperature increased from 24 to 34 degrees C. However, the respiratory latent heat flow increased from 10 to 15 W m(-2) with the same temperature increase. Furthermore, the metabolic heat production remained stable, independent of the variation of the air temperature; however, it was higher in males than in females (by approximately 25\%). This fact can be explained by the variation of the ventilation rate, which had a mean value of 1.6 and 2.2 L s(-1) for females and males, respectively. (V) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Immunolocalization of aquaporins 1, 3, and 5 in the nasal respiratory mucosa of a panting species, the sheep (<i>Ovis aries</i>)","Vesterdorf, Kristine and Blache, Dominique and Maloney, Shane K.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2014.04.003,"The nasal respiratory mucosa is the primary site for evaporative water loss in panting species, necessitating the movement of water across the nasal epithelium. Aquaporins (AQP) are protein channels that facilitate water movement in various fluid transporting tissues of non-panting species. Whether the requirement for enhanced capacity for transepithelial water movement in the nasal respiratory mucosa of panting species has led to differences in AQP localization is unknown. Using immunohistochemistry, we report the localization of AQP1, 3, and 5 in the nasal respiratory mucosa of sheep being exposed to ambient temperatures of similar to 21 degrees C or similar to 38 degrees C for 4.5 h before death (n=3/treatment). Exposure to either treatment resulted in panting. While exposure to similar to 38 degrees C resulted in a higher respiratory frequency (mean difference: 82 breaths min(-1); P < 0.001) than exposure to similar to 21 degrees C, there was no difference in the localization of AQPs. Connective tissue and vascular endothelial cells expressed AQP1. Glandular acini expressed AQP1 and apically localized AQP5, which was also present in glandular duct cells. Ciliated columnar epithelial cells expressed AQP5 apically and AQP3 basolaterally. Basal cells expressed AQP3. The distribution and colocalization of AQPs in the ovine nasal respiratory mucosa is different to that reported in non-panting species and may reflect the physiological demands associated with enhanced respiratory evaporation. We propose that AQP1, 3, and 5 may constitute a transepithelial water pathway via glandular secretions and across the surface epithelium, which provides a possible means for rapid and controllable water movement in the nasal respiratory mucosa of a panting species.

It was shown that 8-oxo-2'deoxyguanosine was not toxic at concentrations of up to 1 mu M. A tendency to accelerate larval development and fly emergence was observed under the influence of this compound in our experiments. Short-term heat shock causes a 50-80\% decrease in the number of larvae that complete development. The addition of exogenous 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine to the food before thermal influence negates this effect and brings the levels of the imago emergence indicators back to the basal level. The obtained results are further evidence of the possible bio-regulatory and adaptogen functions of 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine.",2019,86,NA,NA
Screening of cold tolerance in fifteen springtail species,"Holmstrup, Martin",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.07.017,"Springtails (Collembola) are ubiquitous and help ecosystem processes such as the decomposition of dead plant material. Their ability to survive low winter temperatures is an important trait that partly defines their geographic distribution. The cold tolerances of 15 laboratory-reared species of springtails were investigated. Springtails were cold acclimated in the laboratory over two months in order to simulate a seasonal change in temperature during autumn. Springtails were then exposed to decreasing sub-zero temperatures and at the same time simulating the moisture conditions in frozen soil. The cold tolerance of the species reflected well the climate of region of origin. Differential scanning calorimetry of individual springtails showed that melting points of body fluids did not become lower due to long-term cold acclimation (from 20 degrees to 1.5 degrees C). However, both water content and melting point of two arctic species (Hypogastrura viatica and Protaphorura macfadyeni) decreased drastically during exposure to sub-zero temperatures indicating cryoprotective dehydration (CPD). These arctic species survived exposure to - 9 degrees C for two weeks and - 20 degrees C for at least one week using CPD. Four other subarctic or cool temperate species also used CPD and survived - 9 degrees C for weeks, whereas springtails in culture from less cool temperate regions had poor cold tolerance.",2018,77,NA,1-6
A simulated heat wave shortens the telomere length and lifespan of a desert lizard,"Zhang, Qiong and Han, Xingzhi and Hao, Xin and Ma, Liang and Li, Shuran and Wang, Yang and Du, Weiguo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.01.004,"Understanding how organisms respond to warming contributes important information to the conservation of biodiversity that is threatened by climate warming. Here, we conducted experiments on a desert agama (Phrynocephalus przewalskii) to test the hypothesis that climate warming (an increase in both mean temperature and heat waves) would induce oxidative stress, shortening telomere length, and thereby decreasing survival. Our results demonstrated that one week of exposure to a simulated heat wave significantly shortened telomere length, and decreased the overwinter survival of lizards, but mean temperature increase did not affect the survival of lizards. However, the antioxidant capacity (anti-oxidative enzyme) was not affected by the warming treatments. Therefore, heat waves might have negative impacts on the desert agama, with shortened telomeres likely causing the lifespan of lizards to decrease under climate warming.",2018,72,NA,94-100

Temperature is likely the main factor regulating their physiology by acting on the endocrine system, with consequences on development, growth and size at metamorphosis. All these parameters control survival in the wild and performances in raniculture. This study is. to our knowledge, the first report on the effects of temperature, density and protein level in food on the rearing of the North African green Frog Pelophylax saharicus. Results show that a temperature of 26 degrees C is optimal for maximum weight gain. The maximum metamorphosis rate is obtained between 24 and 26 degrees C. The highest yields occur at low densities from 1 to 10 tadpoles l(-1). The best survival rate and accelerated metamorphosis are obtained at a level of 35\% protein in food whose impact on food intake and weight gain is low. The maximum weight attained by tadpoles at metamorphosis, however, is obtained with a level of 40\% protein. These results justify examination of this species in the light of climate change and suggest new techniques for aquaculture. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2014,45,NA,81-86

However, the relation between metabolic rate and oxidative stress is tissue dependent in animals acclimated to cold temperatures. Here we examined oxidative stress, reflected by changes of antioxidant activity and other related markers, in striped hamsters acclimated to moderate cold (15 degrees C), room (23 degrees C) or warm temperature (30 degrees C) for 6 weeks, by which either higher or lower metabolic rate was induced experimentally. Energy intake and the rate of metabolism and nonshivering thermogenesis were increased at 15 degrees C, but decreased at 30 degrees C compared with that at 23 degrees C. Effects of temperatures on the markers of both oxidative stress and antioxidant activities were rarely significant. The percentages of positive correlation between the 11 tissues (brain, BAT, liver, heart, lung, kidneys, stomach, small and large intestine, caecum and skeletal muscle) were 14.5\% (8/55) for catalase (CAT), 7.3\% (4/55) for the capacity of inhibition of hydroxyl free radical (CIH), 5.5\% (3/55) for activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), 1.8\% (1/55) for total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), 4.3\% (2/46) for H2O2 and 11.1\% (4/36) for the capacity of inhibition of hydroxyl free radical (CIH). This indicated that the tissue-dependent changes of both oxidative stress and antioxidant activity were less consistent among the different tissues. Finally the data from this study were less consistent with the prediction of the mechanism of the rate of living-free radical theory. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2014,44,NA,35-40
"Breaking the temperature-size rule: Thermal effects on growth, development and fecundity of a crustacean from temporary waters","Aguilar-Alberola, Josep A. and Mesquita-Joanes, Francesc",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2014.02.016,"The temperature-size rule (TSR) is a well-established phenomenon to describe the growth response of ectotherms to temperature by which individuals maintained at low temperatures grow more slowly, but attain a larger size upon maturity. Although there are adaptive and non-adaptive theories about the plasticity of body size in response to temperature, these cannot be applied to all ectotherms, and little is known about the changes in growth and development rates through ontogeny. The ostracod species Heterocypris bosniaca, an inhabitant of freshwater temporary ponds, was used to examine the growth and development rates of its nine growth stages and female fecundity at four different temperatures (15 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C). The development rate of this species accelerates with increasing temperature, reaching a maximum value at 25 degrees C. The growth factor has a reverse-TSR in younger instars, and the typical TSR is followed only in the last two moults, resulting in non-monotonic response of adult size to temperature. Fecundity (total offspring per female) was not directly related to adult size and was generally higher at lower temperatures. Our results agree with recent research showing that the TSR may vary during ontogeny, and may not be a general trend in ostracod species from temporary waters. Indeed, adult carapace size seems to follow the pattern of a thermal reaction norm, probably influenced by the reduction of oxygen bioavailability at low temperature and the drastic increase in metabolic demand at the upper extreme of the thermal gradient.

Fitness costs associated with different frequencies and magnitudes of temperature change in the butterfly <i>Bicyclus anynana</i>,"Franke, Kristin and Heitmann, Nadja and Tobner, Anne and Fischer, Klaus",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2014.02.006,"Plastic responses to changes in environmental conditions are ubiquitous and typically highly effective, but are predicted to incur costs. We here investigate the effects of different frequencies and magnitudes of temperature change in the tropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana, considering developmental (Experiment 1) and adult stage plasticity (Experiment 2). We predicted negative effects of more frequent temperature changes on development, immune function and/or reproduction. Results from Experiment 1 showed that repeated temperature changes during development, if involving large amplitudes, negatively affect larval time, larval growth rate and pupal mass, while adult traits remained unaffected. However, results from treatment groups with smaller temperature amplitudes yielded no clear patterns. In Experiment 2 prolonged but not repeated exposure to 39 degrees C increased heat tolerance, potentially reflecting costs of repeatedly activating emergency responses. At the same time fecundity was more strongly reduced in the group with prolonged heat stress, suggesting a trade-off between heat tolerance and reproduction. Clear effects were restricted to conditions involving large temperature amplitudes or high temperatures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2014,41,NA,88-94

Dietary enzymatically-treated <i>Artemisia annua</i> L. supplementation could alleviate oxidative injury and improve reproductive performance of sows reared under high ambient temperature,"Zhang, Wenfei and Heng, Jinghui and Kim, Sung Woo and Chen, Fang and Deng, Zixiao and Zhang, Shihai and Guan, Wutai",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102751,"The medicinal plant Artemisia annua L. is well known for its antimalarial compound artemisinin and the antioxidant capacity of its active ingredients. However, low bioavailability of Artemisia annua L. limits its therapeutic potential, fermentation of Artemisia annua L. can improve its bioavailability. This study was aimed to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation of enzymatically-treated Artemisia annua L. (EA) on reproductive performance, antioxidant status, milk composition of heat-stressed sows and intestinal barrier integrity of their preweaning offspring. 135 multiparous sows of average parity 4.65 (Landrace x large white) at day 85 of pregnancy were randomly distributed into 3 treatments. Sows in the control group were housed at control rooms (temperature: 27.12 +/- 0.18 degrees C, temperature-humidity index (THI): 70.90 +/- 0.80) and fed the basal diet. Sows in the HS, HS + EA groups were fed the basal diet supplemented with 0 or 1.0 g/kg EA respectively, and reared at heat stress rooms (temperature: 30.11 +/- 0.16 degrees C, THI: 72.70 +/- 0.60). Heat stress increased the malondialdehyde (MDA) content, reduced the activities of total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and total superoxide dismutase (T SOD) of sows and piglets, and seriously compromised the antioxidant capacity of the sows and the intestinal integrity of their offspring. However, dietary supplementation of 1.0 g/kg EA reduced the MDA content, increased the activities of T-SOD and T-AOC in serum, colostrum, and milk of heat-stressed sows, and increased colostrum yield and 14-d milk fat content. EA supplementation also increased piglet weaning weight and the activities of T-SOD and T-AOC in serum. In addition, the abundances of intestinal tight junction proteins claudin1 and occludin were up-regulated in piglets in EA-supplemented group. In conclusion, dietary EA supplementation at 1.0 g/kg can alleviate the oxidative stress in heat-stressed sows, improve the antioxidant capacity in both sows and their offspring, and promote the intestinal barrier integrity in their offspring. EA may be a potent dietary supplement that ameliorates oxidative stress in livestock production by improving the antioxidant capacity.",2020,94,NA,NA
Purine levels and purinergic signaling in plasma and spleen of <i>Brycon amazonicus</i> exposed to acute heat thermal stress: An attempt to regulate the immune response,"Souza, Carine de Freitas and Baldissera, Matheus D. and Barroso, Danilo C. and Val, Adalberto Luis and Baldisserotto, Bernardo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102569,"Amazon fish are vulnerable to climate change. Several lines of evidence suggest that the temperature of Amazonian rivers will increase in the coming years. Elevated temperature disturbs homeostasis and subjects fish to physiological stress; however, the effects of temperature on immunity remain poorly understood, particularly those effects involving purinergic signaling. This system fine-tunes the inflammatory and immune responses triggered by stress. Therefore, the aims of this study were to determine whether acute heat stress induces the release of nucleotides into extracellular compartment and to determine whether purinergic enzymes modulate the pminflammatory effects of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in plasma and spleen of matrinxa (Brycon amazonicus) exposed to acute heat stress. We exposed juvenile matrinxa to four temperature regimes (28 degrees C as control, 30, 32 and 34 degrees C) for 72 h and observed the effects on purinergic signaling. Plasma cortisol levels were significantly higher in fish exposed to 34 degrees C than in the control group, while spleen ATP, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) levels were significantly higher in this group than in controls. Activities of spleen nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (NTPDase) and 5'-nucleotidase were significantly higher in fish exposed to 34 degrees C than those of the control group, while spleen interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were higher in this same group than in the control group. No significant differences were observed between the groups regarding plasma parameters. Based on these data, we concluded that acute heat stress at 34 degrees C caused physiological stress in matrinxa, manifesting as elevated plasma cortisol levels. The most important finding is that purinergic enzymes were modulated, though not efficiently, in response to the excessive release of nucleotides into the extracellular space. In summary, the purinergic signaling pathway may be involved in the impairment of immune and inflammatory responses in matrinxa exposed acutely to 34 degrees C.",2020,89,NA,NA

We use a response surface method to optimize the response variables for survival (S) and growth, and the reduction of oxidative stress, over a 50-day experimental duration. T has a significant effect on specific growth rate (SGR), hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities (P < 0.05). DO concentration has a significant effect on SGR, S, hepatic MDA content, and SOD and CAT activities (P < 0.05). T and DO also have significant second order effects on SGR, S, SOD, and CAT activities (P < 0.05). Increased DO at low T stimulates SOD and CAT activities and alleviates oxidative damage.

Ectotherm performance can be maintained in thermally heterogeneous habitats by reducing the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes and concomitant performance. We examined the capacity of juvenile green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris) to respond to daily thermal variation. Juveniles (47 days post-hatch) were exposed to either stable (15 +/- 0.5 degrees C) or variable (narrowly variable: 13-17 degrees C day(-1) or widely variable 11-21 degrees C day(-1)) thermoperiod treatments, with equivalent mean temperatures (15 +/- 0.5 degrees C), for 21 days. Growth (relative growth rate, \% body mass gain), upper thermal tolerance (critical thermal maxima, CTMax) and the thermal sensitivity of swimming performance (critical swimming speed, U-crit) were assessed in fish from all treatments. Accelerated growth was observed in fish maintained under widely variable temperatures compared to narrowly variable and stable temperatures. No significant variation in CTMax was observed among thermoperiod treatments, suggesting all treatment groups acclimated to the mean temperature rather than daily maximums. The widely variable treatment induced a plastic response in swimming performance, where U-crit was insensitive to temperature and performance was maintained across a widened thermal breadth. Maximum U-crit attained was similar among thermoperiod treatments, but performance was maximised at different test temperatures (stable: 4.62 +/- 0.44 BL s(-1) at 15 degrees C; narrowly variable: 4.52 +/- 0.23 BL s(-1) at 21 degrees C; widely variable: 3.90 +/- 0.24 BL s(-1) at 11 degrees C, mean +/- s.e.m.).

In this study, we measured locomotor performance in two different altitude populations of the Qinghai toad-headed lizards (Pluynocephalus vlangalii) at different test temperatures to assess between population differences in thermal sensitivity of sprint speed. Low-elevation lizards ran faster than high-elevation lizards at most test temperatures. Sprint speed varied with test temperature similarly between populations, but the thermal sensitivity (performance breadth) differed significantly. Low-elevation lizards had a lower optimal temperature (T-opt) for sprint speed and narrower performance breadth than high-elevation lizards as inferred from the thermal performance curves constructed for each individual. We also measured the body temperature of active lizards (T-b) in the field and selected temperature (T-sel) in the laboratory. Low-elevation lizards had a lower T-sel and less variable Tb than high-elevation lizards. In both populations, T-opt waslower than T-opt for sprint speed, which was inconsistent with the prediction for a match between thermal preference and Topt. Our results suggest that lower thermal sensitivity and weaker locomotor ability for high-elevation lizards may be an adaptive response to the local environmental conditions (e.g., greater thermal variability, higher food availability, and lower predator pressure).",2018,71,NA,136-141

To further clarify the role of ERS in the effect, in the present study, we detected the impact of increasing the incubation temperature by 1 degrees C during embryonic days 10-27 (E10-27) on the development of duck embryos, and investigated the changes in mRNA and protein expression of ERS marker genes and muscle-related genes under the thermal manipulation (TM). The results of relative weight comparison showed that only the relative weight of breast muscle was steadily decreased by TM from E10 to the first day after hatching (WO). Meanwhile, the real-time PCR and western-blot analysis revealed that raising the incubation temperature stimulated the expression of ERS marker genes in breast muscle at E20. The mRNA expressions of muscle hypertrophy and atrophy-related genes were also detected, and were not changed regularly, however, the protein expressions of hypertrophy-related genes were all decreased at both E20 and WO, and the protein expression of atrophy-related genes were up-regulated at E20. The protein expression of muscle proliferation-related genes were also decreased at E20. Additionally, these results were the same as that in the ERS positive control groups. Taken together, these results indicated that long-term TM during late embryonic period could block the development of duck breast muscle by inhibiting muscle hypertrophy and proliferation, and promoting muscle atrophy at a post-transcriptional level via the activation of ERS.",2017,70,B,37-45

The optimal combination of water temperature and dietary lipid level was 27.5 degrees C and 9.2\%, at which the greatest growth and FCR were 2.13\%.d(-1) and 1.31 respectively, with desirability of 0.904. These results indicated that water temperature may mediate the requirement and utilization of dietary lipid, and intervene in hepatic fat deposition.

Exposure to solar radiation drives organismal vulnerability to climate: Evidence from an intertidal limpet,"Chapperon, Coraline and Volkenborn, Nils and Clavier, Jacques and Seite, Sarah and Seabra, Rui and Lima, Fernando P.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.03.002,"Understanding the physiological abilities of organisms to cope with heat stress is critical for predictions of species' distributions in response to climate change. We investigated physiological responses (respiration and heart beat rate) of the ectotherm limpet Patella vulgata to heat stress events during emersion and the role of seasonal and microclimatic acclimatization for individual thermal tolerance limits. Individuals were collected from 5 microhabitats characterized by different exposure to solar radiation in the high intertidal zone of a semi-exposed rocky shore in winter and summer of 2014. Upper thermal tolerance limits(heat coma temperatures - HCTs, and heart rate Arrhenius break temperatures ABTs) were determined for individuals from each microhabitat in both seasons under laboratory conditions. While we found a clear seasonal acclimatization, i.e., higher Has and ABTs in summer than in winter, we did not find evidence for microhabitat-specific responses that would suggest microclimatic acclimatization. However, operative limpet temperatures derived from in-situ temperature measurements suggest that individuals from sun exposed microhabitats have a much narrower thermal safety margins than those from less exposed surfaces or within crevices. Microhabitat specific thermal safety margins caused by high thermal heterogeneity at small spatial scales and the lack of short term acclimatization will likely shape small scale distribution patterns of intertidal species in response to the predicted increase in the frequency and intensity of heat waves.

Highest constant temperature (30 degrees C) reduced the density of M. macrocopa. The cladocerans under the fluctuating temperature regime too had lower population growth (about 50\% lower than that at constant 25 degrees C). The survivorship of M. macrocopa was higher at 20 degrees C than that at 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C or at variable temperature regime. Gross and net reproductive rates were higher at 25 degrees C. At 20 degrees C, neonates had the highest proportion (67\%) of myristic, palmitic and stearic acids while the adults had the lowest (26\%) proportion. For both adults and neonates, palmitoleic, linoleic and linolenic comprised of 15-35\% of the total fatty acids. Higher percentage (19\%) of linoleic acid was present in adults than neonates (7\%). Adults had linolenic acid level which was 3-times higher than in neonates. Linoleic and linolenic fatty acids decreased with increasing temperature for neonates and adults from 20 degrees C to 30 degrees C.

Increased expression of <i>Hsp70</i> and <i>Hsp90</i> mRNA as biomarkers of thermal stress in loggerhead turtle embryos (<i>Caretta Caretta</i>),"Tedeschi, J. N. and Kennington, W.

J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2014.11.006,"The survival and viability of sea turtle embryos is dependent upon favourable nest temperatures throughout the incubation period. Consequently, future generations of sea turtles may be at risk from increasing nest temperatures due to climate change, but little is known about how embryos respond to heat stress. Heat shock genes are likely to be important in this process because they code for proteins that prevent cellular damage in response to environmental stressors. This study provides the first evidence of an expression response in the heat shock genes of embryos of loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) exposed to realistic and near-lethal temperatures (34 degrees C and 36 degrees C) for I or 3 hours. We investigated changes in Heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60), Hsp70, and Hsp90 mRNA in heart (n=24) and brain tissue (n=29) in response to heat stress. Under the most extreme treatment (36 degrees C, 3 h), Hsp70 increased mRNA expression by a factor of 38.8 in heart tissue and 15.7 in brain tissue, while Hsp90 mRNA expression increased by a factor of 98.3 in heart tissue and 14.7 in brain tissue. Hence, both Hsp70 and Hsp90 are useful biomarkers for assessing heat stress in the late-stage embryos of sea turtles. The method we developed can be used as a platform for future studies on variation in the thermotolerance response from the clutch to population scale, and can help us anticipate the resilience of reptile embryos to extreme heating events.

"Trade-off between thermal sensitivity, hypoxia tolerance and growth in fish","Roze, Thomas and Christen, Felix and Amerand, Aline and Claireaux, Guy",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2012.12.001,"One outcome of contemporary climate trends is that the involvement of hypoxia and heat tolerance in determining individual fitness will increase in many fish populations. Large fish are believed to be more tolerant to hypoxia than small fish (Nilsson and Ostlund-Nilsson, 2008) whereas thermal sensitivity is thought to decrease with body size (Clark et al., 2008). To better understand the bases of inter-individual variation in environmental adaptation performance, the current study examined hypoxia and heat tolerance in a fast growing (FGS; 288.3 +/- 14.4 g, 26.04 +/- 0.49 cm) and a slow growing (SGS; 119.95 +/- 6.41 g; 20.98 +/- 0.41 cm) strain of 1-year old rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). This examination was conducted using two standardized challenge tests aimed at assessing individual incipient lethal oxygen saturation and incipient upper lethal temperature. Results to these tests were then cross-correlated with swim tests during which individual basal and active metabolic rate values were also measured. Measurements of permeabilized ventricular myofibers oxygen consumption were also conducted, as well as various organ-to-body-mass ratios. Experimental data showed that FGS was more hypoxia tolerant than SGS (13.4 to 16.7\% air sat versus 14.7 to 18.9\% air sat respectively). On the other hand, FGS was found less tolerant to heat than SGS (24.7-27.6 degrees C versus 28.5 to 29.7 degrees C respectively). Adding to the body size effect, another source of inter-individual variation in environmental tolerance was found. Residual analysis highlighted that whereas none of the individual morphometric and energetic traits correlated with hypoxia tolerance, permeabilized ventricular myofibers maximal oxygen consumption correlated well with individual tolerance to heat.

Development of <i>Sarcophaga dux</i> (diptera: Sarcophagidae) at constant temperatures and differential gene expression for age estimation of the pupae,"Zhang, Xiangyan and Li, Yi and Shang, Yanjie and Ren, Lipin and Chen, Wei and Wang, Shiwen and Guo, Yadong",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102735,"Sarcophaga dux (Diptera: Sarcophagidae) is a necrophagous flesh fly species with potential forensic value for estimating minimum postmortem interval (PMImin). The basic developmental data and precise age estimates of the pupae are significant for PMImin estimation in forensic investigations. In the present study, we investigated the development data of that species at seven constant temperatures varying from 16 degrees C to 34 degrees C, including body length changes of the larve, developmental duration and accumulated degree hours of the preadults. Several reference genes for relative quantification of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were firstly selected and evaluated in the pupae of different ages under different temperatures. The DEGs of the insects during the pupal period at different constant temperatures (34, 25 and 16 degrees C) were further analyzed for more precise age estimation. The results showed that the developmental durations of the preadults at 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31 and 34 degrees C were 1478.6 +/- 18.3 h, 726.1 +/- 15.8 h, 538.5 +/- 0.9 h, 394.1 +/- 9.5 h, 375.6 +/- 10.8 h, 284.1 +/- 7.3 h, and 252.5 +/- 6.1 h, respectively. The developmental threshold temperature the flies was 12.27 +/- 0.35 degrees C, and the thermal summation constant was 5341.71 +/- 249.29 degrees hours. The most reliable reference genes during the pupal period at different temperatures were found: GST1 and 18S rRNA for the 34 degrees C group, GST1 and RPL49 for 25 degrees C, and 18S rRNA and 28S rRNA for 16 degrees C. The four differential expression genes (Hsp60, A-alpha, ARP, and RPL8) have the potential to be used for more precise age estimation of pupal S. dux.

Differences in heat tolerance plasticity between supratidal and intertidal snails indicate complex responses to microhabitat temperature variation,"Brahim, Amalina and Marshall, David J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102620,"Tropical intertidal gastropods that experience extreme and highly variable daily temperatures have evolved significant and complex heat tolerance plasticity, comprising components that respond to different timescales of temperature variation. An earlier study showed different plasticity attributes in snails from differently-heated coastlines, suggesting lifelong irreversible responses that matched habitat thermal regimes. To determine whether heat tolerance plasticity varied at a finer, within-shore spatial scale, we compared the responses of supratidal (predominantly shade-dwelling) and intertidal (frequently solar-exposed) populations of the tropical thermophilic gastropod, Echinolittorina malaccana. Snails modified lethal temperature (LT50) under warm or cool laboratory acclimation, with the overall variation in LT 50 being greater in the supratidal (56.0-58.0 degrees C) than in the intertidal population (57.1-58.1 degrees C). Similar maximum LT(50)s expressed by the populations after warm acclimation suggest a capacity limitation under these temperature conditons. The different minimum LT(50)s after cool acclimation corresponded with microhabitat temperature and field acclimatization of the snails. Different responses to the same laboratory acclimation treatment imply long-term (and possibly lifelong) thermal acclimatization, which could benefit sedentary organisms that are randomly recruited as larvae from a common thermally-stable aquatic environment to thermally-unpredictable intertidal microhabitats. These findings provide another example of thermal tolerance plasticity operating at microhabitat scales, suggesting the importance of considering microhabitat thermal responses when assessing broad-scale environmental change.",2020,91,NA,NA

They require loose soil and shelter from direct sun, both common in Mediterranean cities, and explaining their high abundance in urban habitats. We studied different aspects of thermal acclimation in wormlions. We compared chill-coma recovery time (CCRT) and heat-shock recovery time (HSRT) of wormlions from urban, semi-urban and natural habitats, expecting those originating from the urban habitat to be more heat tolerant and less cold tolerant. However, no differences were detected among the three habitats. We then examined whether maintenance temperature affects CCRT and HSRT, and expected beneficial acclimation. However, CCRT was unaffected by maintenance temperature, while temperature affected HSRT in an opposite direction to our prediction: wormlions maintained under the higher temperatures took longer to recover. When testing with two successive thermal shocks, wormlions took longer to recover from both cold and heat shock after applying an initial cold shock. We therefore conclude that cold shock inflicts some damage rather than induces acclimation. Finally, both cold- and heat-shocked wormlions constructed smaller pits than wormlions of a control group. Smaller pits probably translate to a lower likelihood of capturing prey and also limit the size of the prey, indicating a concrete cost of thermal shock. In summary, we found no evidence for thermal acclimation related either to the habitat-of-origin or to maintenance temperatures, but, rather, negative effects of unfavorable temperatures.",2018,74,NA,181-186

We have previously determined autophagic dysfunction and apoptotic signaling in oxidative skeletal muscle following prolonged hyperthermia. The aim of this investigation was to extend our knowledge regarding the early chronology of heat stress-mediated apoptotic and autophagic signaling in oxidative skeletal muscle. We hypothesized that 2, 4, and 6 h of hyperthermia would increase apoptosis and autophagy in oxidative skeletal muscle compared to thermoneutral (TN) conditions. Pigs were assigned to four groups (n = 8/group) and exposed to environmental heat stress (37 degrees C) for 0, 2, 4, or 6 h. Immediately following environmental exposure animals were euthanized and the red portion of the semitendinosus was collected. Markers of apoptotic signaling were increased following 2 h of heating but returned to baseline thereafter, while caspase 3 activity remained elevated 2-3 fold (p < .05) throughout the hyperthermic period. Heat stress increased (p < .05) markers of autophagic activation, and nucleation as well as autophagosome formation and degradation linearly throughout the heating intervention. In addition, 6 h of hyperthermia increased (p < .05) markers of mitophagy. These data suggest that apoptotic signaling precedes increased autophagy during acute heat stress in oxidative skeletal muscle.",2018,72,NA,73-80

Extreme temperatures (12 and 32 degrees C) significantly increased mortality of embryos (to 100\%) and nymphs II, whereas larvae and nymphs I suffered reduced survival only at the lowest temperature. Moreover, the lowest temperature reduced the development rate of all stages. The impact of light conditions was less pronounced and more variable: constant light reduced the survival of nymphs I at lower temperatures, but increased that of larvae. Moreover, light increased the time of embryonic development and duration of nymphal stages, particularly at lower temperatures (12-22 degrees C). Thus, the most optimal locations for spiders seem to be dark (though except larval stage) and warm (25 degrees C) sites, where their development is fastest and mortality lowest.",2018,72,NA,26-32

To do so, we reared worker AHB pupae under a fluctuating temperature regime, simulating current tropical heatwaves, with a high temperature peak of 40.0 degrees C for 1 h daily across six days, and compared them to control pupae reared at stable temperatures of 34.0-35.5 degrees C. Heat stress did not markedly affect overall body size, though the forewing of heat-stressed bees was slightly shorter than controls. However, bees reared under heat stress showed significantly greater fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in forewing shape. Heat stress also decreased AOF and reduced longevity.

This species was assumed to possess a wide thermal niche since it is able to adapt to cold climates, which is a factor that boosted its rapid expansion from south to many central-northern European Countries. However, the effect of variations in environmental temperatures on its competitive ability against other species has still not been investigated. In this paper, we analyzed the change in survival ability of Lasius neglectus during encounters with two Mediterranean dominant ants (Crematogaster scutellaris and Tapinoma nigerrimum) at four different temperatures (15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C). Firstly, control tests were performed to provide the baseline survival ability of the three species at different temperatures. Secondly, competition tests were carried out at the same temperatures. Lasius neglectus survival was negatively affected by high temperature (30 degrees C) in control tests, and this impairment was much more pronounced in competition tests. On the contrary, the two opponent species were only marginally affected by temperatures in control tests. Crematogaster scutellaris was a better competitor than L. neglectus, particularly at high temperatures. Tapinoma nigerrimum was a weaker competitor and was always outcompeted by L. neglectus, particularly at low temperatures. This result could suggest that L. neglectus is at a disadvantage during interspecific encounters when temperatures are high and that the predicted future increase in environmental temperatures may potentially enhance this handicap.",2017,65,NA,76-81
Expression levels of <i>HSP70</i> and <i>CPT</i>-<i>1</i> in three local breeds of chickens reared under normal or heat stress conditions after the introduction of the naked neck gene,"Galal, A. and Radwan, Lamiaa M. and Rezik, Habiba H. and Ayoub, H.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.12.018,"The naked neck gene was introduced by crossbreeding into Egyptian breeds to improve body weight. Expression levels of HSP70 and CPT-1 were used to assess the heat tolerance of three Egyptian local breeds (Fayoumi, Dandarawi and Sinai) with and without the naked neck gene and under normal and heat stress conditions. There were two genotypes from each breed that had the same genetic origin (the naked neck and normal plumage genotypes). For each genotype, chicks were divided into two groups, a control group and a treated group. Chicks in the treated group were subjected to heat stress (40 degrees C) for four hours when they were between 3 and 5 days old. This treatment was associated with a highly significant increase in HSP70 and CPT-1 gene expression for the Dandarawi breed compared to the levels in the Fayoumi and Sinai breeds. Moreover, the introduction of the naked neck gene into these local breeds caused marked increases in CPT-1 gene expression, but these increases did not significantly differ among different naked neck genotypes. Therefore, it could be concluded that the Dandarawi breed exhibited the best heat tolerance, followed by the Sinai breed, whereas the Fayoumi breed was inferior in this respect. Furthermore, the naked neck gene improved heat tolerance by increasing HSP70 gene expression rather than only by reducing feather cover. The results obtained recommended using the Sinia naked neck chicken as a male line in commercial parent stock to produce broiler chicks adapted to the hot and warm climates.",2019,80,NA,113-118
The metabolic response in fish to mildly elevated water temperature relates to species-dependent muscular concentrations of imidazole compounds and free amino acids,"Geda, Fikremariam and Declercq, Annelies M. and Remo, Sofie C. and Waagbo, Rune and Lourenco, Marta and Janssens, Geert P. J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.02.004,"Fish species show distinct differences in their muscular concentrations of imidazoles and free amino acids (FAA). This study was conducted to investigate whether metabolic response to mildly elevated water temperature (MEWT) relates to species-dependent muscular concentrations of imidazoles and FAA. Thirteen carp and 17 Nile tilapia, housed one per aquarium, were randomly assigned to either acclimation (25 degrees C) or MEWT (30 degrees C) for 14 days. Main muscular concentrations were histidine (HIS; P < 0.001) in carp versus N-aacetylhistidine (NAH; P < 0.001) and taurine (TAU; P=0.001) in tilapia. Although the sum of imidazole (HIS +NAH) and TAU in muscle remained constant over species and temperatures (12 > 0.05), (NAH+HIS)/TAU ratio was markedly higher in carp versus tilapia, and decreased with MEWT only in carp (P < 0.05). Many of the muscular FAA concentrations were higher in carp than in tilapia (P < 0.05). Plasma acylcarnitine profile suggested a higher use of AA and fatty acids in carp metabolism (P < 0.05). On the contrary, the concentration of 3-hydroxyisovalezylcarnitine, a sink of leucine catabolism, (P=0.009) pointed to avoidance of leucine use in tilapia metabolism. Despite a further increase of plasma longer-chain acylcarnitines in tilapia at MEWT (P=0.009), their corresponding beta-oxidation products (3-hydroxy-longer-chain acylcarnitines) remained constant. Together with higher plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) in carp (P=0.001), the latter shows that carp, being a fatter fish, more readily mobilises fat than tilapia at MEWT, which coincides with more intensive muscular mobilization of imidazoles. This study demonstrates that fish species differ in their metabolic response to MEWT, which is associated with species-dependent changes in muscle imidazole to taurine ratio.",2017,65,NA,57-63

This study explored local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity of metabolic rates and thermal limits in the supratidal rockpool beetle Ochthebius lejolisii. . Using populations from localities at different ends of the species range that experience contrasting thermal variability, we simultaneously tested two of the major paradigms of spatial physiological ecology: metabolic cold adaptation (MCA) and the climatic variability hypothesis (CVH). Reciprocal acclimation was conducted under spring temperature regimes of both localities, incorporating local diurnal variation. Metabolic rates were measured by closed respirometry, and thermal tolerance limits estimated through thermography. In line with MCA, the higher-latitude population (colder climate) showed higher metabolic rates and temperature coefficients (Q10s) 10 s) at lower temperatures than the lower-latitude population. As predicted by the CVH, the lower-latitude population (more variable climate) showed higher upper thermal tolerance but only the higher-latitude population was able to acclimate upper thermal limits. This result suggests trade-offs between physiological thermal limits and thermal plasticity in this species. A limited acclimation capacity could make populations on Mediterranean coasts especially vulnerable in the face of projected increases in extreme temperatures under ongoing climate change.",2024,123,NA,NA

Females and males were acclimated at 20, 25 and 30 \& DEG;C for up to 19 days following adult emergence. The critical thermal minimum (CTmin) and maximum (CTmax) were subsequently recorded as well adult survival following acute exposure to chilling (0 or-3 \& DEG;C for 2 h). Additionally, we determined the survival of pupae subjected for 2 h to temperatures ranging from-12 \& DEG;C to 5 \& DEG;C.We demonstrate that acclimation at 30 \& DEG;C resulted in significantly higher CTmax and CTmin values (higher heat resistance and lower cold resistance, respectively). Additionally, adult recovery following exposure to-3 \& DEG;C was significantly reduced following acclimation at 30 \& DEG;C, and this effect was significantly higher for females. Pupal mortality increased with the decrease in temperature, reaching LT50 and LT95 values following exposure to-0.32 \& DEG;C and-6.88 \& DEG;C, respectively.

The spotted sea bass (14.7 \& PLUSMN; 1.54 g) temporarily cultured at 26 \& DEG;C was directly transferred to the 32 \& DEG;C high temperature group, and the gill morphology, liver antioxidant activity, respiratory metabolism related enzyme activity and the expression of five HSP70 family members genes were measured at 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. The results showed that 32 \& DEG;C had damage effect on gill tissue and antioxidant system, and the damage degree increased with high temperature. Respiratory rate and malondialdehyde increased gradually with the continuous heat stress. Superoxide dismutase and total antioxidant capacity increased briefly and then decreased continuously. Succinate dehydrogenase decreased to the lowest value at 24 h and then continued to increase. Lactate dehydrogenase decreased continuously; the expression of HSP70 increased rapidly and then decreased. These results indicated that the antioxidant system and HSP70 were activated under heat stress condition and provided protection to the body, but with the continuous high temperature, the protective effect was limited, and the fish body was irreversibly damaged. It is necessary to pay close attention to the temperature change in the production practice of spotted sea bass to reduce the influence caused by high temperature.",2023,115,NA,NA
Spermidine alleviates heat shock and promotes the growth of<i> Bombyx</i><i> mori</i>,"Lima, Anugata and Didugu, Brinda Goda Lakshmi and Chunduri, Alekhya Rani and Rajan, Resma and Mamillapalli, Anitha",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103353,"Silkworms have limited ability to regulate their body temperature upon exposure to varying atmospheric tem-peratures. Environmental changes, such as global warming, adversely affect silkworm viability. Spermidine, a polyamine, protects various organisms against heat stress. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of spermidine on the thermotolerance of Bombyx mori larvae. 5th instar Bombyx mori larvae were divided into the control and spermidine groups and reared at 28 +/- 1 degrees C and 80\%-85\% relative humidity. To induce heat stress, the larvae were exposed to various temperatures 32 degrees C, 36 degrees C, and 40 degrees C for 1 h on day 5 and subsequently allowed to recover at 28 +/- 1 degrees C. Growth characteristics were evaluated by examining larval viability and quantifying proteins and carbohydrates. The thermotolerance of the spermidine group was higher than that of the control group at 40 degrees C heat stress conditions. The spermidine feeding increased the protein content and reduced the carbohydrate content significantly under heat stress condition. For the first time, this study demonstrated that spermidine alleviated thermal stress by enhancing the nutritional indices and antioxidant potential of the Bombyx mori larvae. A significant increase in economic properties was observed in spermidine fed groups. Thus, foliar feeding of spermidine to B. mori larvae markedly improved silkworm thermotolerance.",2022,110,NA,NA
Thermal acclimation and acute temperature effects on cardiac barostatic reflexes in rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>),"Sandblom, Erik and Zena, Lucas A. and Pichaud, Nicolas",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103315,"Acute warming raises the metabolism of fish, which is matched by increased heart rate. However, thermal acclimation may reduce heart rate through combinations of lowered intrinsic pacemaker rate and increased inhibitory vagal tone. This could affect the baroreflex, which regulates arterial blood pressure through heart rate changes via altered vagal tone. Using pharmacological tools, we assessed autonomic tones and baroreflex regulation of heart rate in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) at 11 C, and after acute (24 h, 17Cacute) or chronic (> 7 weeks, 17Cchronic) warming to 17 C. We hypothesised that warm acclimation would manifest as reduced heart rate and elevated vagal tone in 17Cchronic trout relative to 11 C and 17Cacute trout, which would increase baroreflex gain and the scope for fH increase through vagal release during hypotension. Compared to 11 C, the 17Cacute group exhibited slightly higher heart rate (Q10 = 1.5) and a strong trend for elevated vagal tone (54\%). Surprisingly, however, routine heart rate was unaltered by warm acclimation (Q10 = 1.6), while intrinsic heart rate and vagal tone (22\%) declined. Consequently, baroreflex sensitivity to reduced blood pressure was elevated in the 17Cacute group but returned towards 11 C conditions in the 17Cchronic group. Atropine abolished nearly all chronotropic changes. Bradycardic responses to hypertension and cardiac adrenergic tone were unaltered across temperature treatments. The lack of a clear acclimation effect on routine heart rate in the present study is likely explained by a seasonal effect as the experiments were performed in early winter. Nonetheless, we conclude that baroreflex sensitivity in trout is thermally plastic; the heightened baroreflex sensitivity to hypotension following acute warming likely serves to safeguard tissue oxygen delivery as meta-bolism is elevated, while the reduced baroreflex sensitivity observed with warm acclimation may be linked to a pronounced metabolic down-regulation.",2022,109,NA,NA
Long-term effects of temperature during early life on growth and fatty acid metabolism in age-0 Lake Sturgeon (<i>Acipenser fulvescens</i>),"Yoon, Gwangseok R. and Bugg, William S. and Fehrmann, Frauke and Yusishen, Michael E. and Suh, Miyoung and Anderson, W.

In the present study, we examined how temperature during early life history might influence growth performance and fatty acid metabolism in age-0 Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) when exposed to cold temperatures at later stages. Fish were initially at 16 degrees C and subsequently held at 16 degrees C or 20 degrees C for 60 days beginning at 34 days post fertilization (dpf). Then, all fish were subsequently raised at the same temperature of 16 degrees C until the onset of cold conditioning at 158 dpf where temperature was gradually decreased to 3.5 degrees C and remained there for two weeks. Samples were collected before (151 dpf) and after cold conditioning (199 dpf) to measure total length, body mass, whole body metabolic rate, fatty acid profile in phospholipids and triglycerides and mRNA expression of genes associated with fatty acid desaturation, elongation and beta-oxidation. Results revealed that before cold conditioning, total length and body mass did not differ between temperature groups, but fish raised at 20 degrees C showed a lower condition factor. During the cold conditioning, only fish raised at 16 degrees C grew significantly longer and heavier. There was no difference in metabolic rates between treatments. Significant increases in total monounsaturated fatty acids with decreases in total saturated fatty acids were identified in phospholipids and triglycerides in both temperature groups after the cold conditioning; however, the 20 degrees C group did not significantly increase levels of gene expression associated with fatty acid desaturation (SCD and FADS1) whereas the 16 degrees C group did. Our results suggest that thermal experience during early life may influence overwintering survival of age-0 Lake Sturgeon.",2022,105,NA,NA

All populations indicated substantial variations (P < 0.05) in CTmax and CTmin values. L. rohita displayed, comparatively the highest CTmax with largest total and intrinsic polygon zones as well as the upper and lower acquired thermal tolerance zones followed by RC and CR hybrids, while C. catla showed significantly the highest CTmin value and the smallest intrinsic and acquired thermal tolerance zones. Both hybrids illustrated low parent hetemsis (<= 11\%). Additionally, the highest expression of Hsp70 and Hsp90 (heat shock proteins) genes, serum lysozyme level, respiratory burst activity and lowest lipid peroxidation level under lower and higher temperature shock further illustrated strong physiological mechanism of L. rohita in contrast to C. cada, to deal with acute temperature, while hybrids, especially F1 RC hybrid appeared as a good option to replace C. catla in relatively higher and lower temperature areas.",2020,89,NA,NA
"Heat stress during development affects immunocompetence in workers, queens and drones of Africanized honey bees (<i>Apis mellifera</i> L.)

M. and Pech-Jimenez, Cristina and Medina-Medina, Luis A. and Quezada-Euan, Jose Javier G.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102541,"Though social insects generally seem to have a reduced individual immunoresponse compared to solitary species, the impact of heat stress on that response has not been studied. In the honey bee, the effect of heat stress on reproductives (queens and males/drones) may also vary compared to workers, but this is currently unknown. Here, we quantified the activity of an enzyme linked to the immune response in insects and known to be affected by heat stress in solitary species: phenoloxidase (PO), in workers, queens and drones of Africanized honey bees (AHBs) experimentally subjected to elevated temperatures during the pupal stage. Additionally, we evaluated this marker in individuals experimentally infected with the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae. Differences in PO activity were found between sexes and castes, with PO activity generally higher in workers and lower in reproductives. Such differences are associated with the likelihood of exposure to infection and the role of different individuals in the colony. Contrary to our expectation, heat stress did not cause an increase in PO activity equally in all classes of individual. Heat stress during the pupal stage significantly decreased the PO activity of AHB queens, but not that of workers or drones, which more frequently engage in extranidal activity. Experimental infection with Metarhizium anisophae reduced PO activity in queens and workers, but increased it in drones. Notably, heat stressed workers lived significantly shorter after infection despite exhibiting greater PO activity than queens or drones. We suggest that this discrepancy may be related to trade-offs among immune response cascades in honey bees such as between heat shock proteins and defensin peptides used in microbial defence. Our results provide evidence for complex relationships among humoral immune responses in AHBs and suggest that heat stress could result in a reduced life expectancy of individuals.",2020,89,NA,NA
Impact of short- and long-term heat stress on reproductive potential of <i>Drosophila suzukii</i> Matsumura (Diptera: Drosophilidae),"Evans, Richard K. and Toews, Michael D. and Sial, Ashfaq A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.09.011,"Drosophila suzukii Matsumura (Diptera: Drosophilidae) is an invasive vinegar fly of Asian origin now distributed throughout North America. Due to the unique morphology of females, this fly has become one of the most serious pests of thin-skinned fruits including blueberry, blackberry, cherry, raspberry, and strawberry. Prophylactic insecticide applications are commonly used to control this fly. A more sustainable approach to managing this invasive pest may not be possible without a clear understanding of the biology of this species under extreme environmental conditions. Specifically, high temperature is known to interfere with development and reproduction of drosophilids; however, the impact of high temperature on D. suzukii needs to be further investigated. The objective of the present study was to investigate the impact of exposure to constant and relatively short-term heat stress on reproductive success of D. suzukii, and potential for recovery. Results show that the development and reproduction of D. suzukii were negatively affected by constant and relatively short-term heat stress. Under constant heat stress, oviposition rate and adult lifespan decreased as temperature increased from 24 degrees C to 33 degrees C and reproduction was completely absent at 33 degrees C. Under relatively short-term heat stress, oviposition, pupation, and adult eclosion were significantly decreased as temperature increased from 28 degrees C to 34 degrees C. The short-term heat stress greatly reduced the fertility of both male and female D. suzukii which was recovered eight days after treatment. This study provides basic information on thermal biology of D. suzukii to help us better understand the trends commonly observed in D. suzukii trap captures in regions with hot summer conditions, and the results can be used in population models to predict its population dynamics in regions where high temperatures prevail during the field season.",2018,78,NA,92-99
Exploring physiological plasticity and local thermal adaptation in an intertidal crab along a latitudinal cline,"Diego Gaitan-Espitia, Juan and Bacigalupe, Leonardo D. and Opitz, Tania and Lagos, Nelson A. and Osores, Sebastian and Lardies, Marco A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.02.011,"Intertidal organisms have evolved physiological mechanisms that enable them to maintain performance and survive during periods of severe environmental stress with temperatures close to their tolerance limits. The level of these adaptive responses in thermal physiology can vary among populations of broadly distributed species depending on their particular environmental context and genetic backgrounds. Here we examined thermal performances and reaction norms for metabolic rate (MR) and heart rate (HR) of seven populations of the porcelanid crab Petrolisthes violaceus from markedly different thermal environments across the latitudinal gradient of similar to 3000 km. Physiological responses of this intertidal crab under common-garden conditions suggest the absence of local thermal adaptation along the geographic gradient (i.e., lack of latitudinal compensation). Moreover, thermal physiological sensitivities and performances in response to increased temperatures evidenced the existence of some level of: i) metabolic rate control or depression during warm temperature exposures; and ii) homeostasis/canalization (i.e., absence or low levels of plasticity) in physiological traits that may reflect some sort of buffering mechanism in most of the populations. Nevertheless, our results indicate that elevated temperatures can reduce cardiac function but not metabolic rate in high latitude crabs. The lack of congruence between HR and MR supports the idea that energy metabolism in marine invertebrates cannot be inferred from HR and different conclusions regarding geographic differentiation in energy metabolism can be obtained from both physiological traits. Integrating thermal physiology and species range extent can contribute to a better understanding of the likely effects of climate change on natural populations of marine ectotherms.",2017,68,A,14-20

The effect of chronic exposure (21d) of pigs to high ambient temperature on expression of amino acid (b(0,+)AT, CAT1) and glucose (SGLT1, GLUT4) transporters, ghrelin, leptin and HSP90 was evaluated. Eighteen pigs (32.6 kg body weight) were distributed into 3 groups: (1) pigs housed under natural high ambient temperature conditions, and fed ad libitum (HS); (2) pigs housed in an air-conditioned room at 24 degrees C (thermo-neutral) fed ad libitum (TNad); (3) pigs housed as in (2), but pair-fed with the HS pigs (TNpf). Body temperature, respiratory frequency, weight gain, feed intake, and feed conversion ratio were measured. At d-21 pigs were euthanized and samples from stomach, duodenum, jejunum, liver, longissimus and semitendinosus muscles, and white adipose tissue were collected for mRNA analysis. In the HS room ambient temperature fluctuated every day (23.6-37.6 degrees C). Respiratory frequency and body temperature were higher in HS pigs (P < 0.001). Weight gain and feed intake of TNad were higher (P < 0.001) than TNpf and HS; gain: feed ratio was not affected by ambient temperature. Expression of HSP90 was higher in duodenum and longissimus (P <= 0.038) of HS compared to TNpf: Expression of ghrelin, leptin and b(0,+)AT were not affected by ambient temperature (P > 0.050). CAT1 expression in liver was higher (P=0.050) but in longissimus was lower (P=0.017) in HS than in TNpf pigs.

Therefore this study investigated the combined effects of increasing levels (30 vs. 60\%) of dietary fish oil replacement by equal mixture of cotton seed oil (CSO) and canola oils (CO) and two different ambient temperature (24 vs. 30 degrees C) on diurnal total ammonia and Urea-N excretion rates in European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). Experimental diets were fed to fish three times (08:30-13:30-18:30 h) at a fixed rate of 3\% BW.d(-1). The daily consumed nitrogen and energy intake of fish were similar during the investigation in different dietary treatments. However, the daily excretion rates of TAN, total nitrogen (TAN+Urea-N) and total nitrogen expressed as a proportion of consumed nitrogen by the European sea bass maintained at 30 degrees C were found to be significantly (P < 0.001) higher (40 to 50\%) than fish maintained at 24 degrees C in all the dietary treatments suggesting higher rates of deamination of ingested amino acids with increased temperature. Daily urea-nitrogen excretion of fish accounted for between 20-30\% of total ammonia-nitrogen excretion rates for each dietary treatment at 24 and 30 degrees C and appeared to be slightly increased by the temperature but neither the temperature nor the amount of plant oil mixture inclusion in diets or the interaction of these two factors had a significant effect on the urea nitrogen excretion rates of fish in different dietary treatments. However, Urea-N excretion rates in fish fed fish oil only (FO) diet were significantly higher (P < 0.05) compared to that of fish fed diets containing increasing amount of plant oil mixture (VOM30 and VOM 60) during the light-on phase of the sampling period at 24 degrees C indicating periodic enhancement of permeability for urea at excretion sites. Further research is needed in order to elucidate the mechanism of nitrogenous excretion in European sea bass fed plant oil containing diets under extreme summer time temperatures employing total dietary fish oil replacement to reveal the possible effects of alteration in cell membrane phospholipid composition on enzymes responsible for nitrogenous excretion and/or detoxification.

However, the tolerance and physiological response to thermal stress is rarely studied in Gymnocypris przewalskii, a rare native fish in the Tibetan plateau. In this study, first, we detected the thermal tolerance of five groups of six-month G. przewalskii which acclimated at 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 \& DEG;C for two weeks, respectively, by critical thermal methodology. Then, through heat challenge, we detected the metabolites, key enzyme activities, and gene expressions involved in metabolism and antioxidant in the hepatopancreas when the temperatures increased from 16 \& DEG;C to 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, and 28 \& DEG;C for 12 h, respectively.

During the heat challenge study, blood glucose significantly increased at heat stress (P < 0.05). At the same time, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and free fatty acid (FFA) significantly decreased when the temperature rose continuously to 20 \& DEG;C.

Two of these, Heterelmis comalensis and Heterelmis cf. glabra are known to occupy habitats immediately adjacent to spring openings and are thought to have stenothermal tolerance pro-files. The other two, Heterelmis vulnerata and Microcylloepus pusillus are surface stream species with more cosmopolitan distributions and are assumed to be less sensitive to variation in environmental conditions. We examined performance and survival of elmids in response to increasing temperatures using dynamic and static assays. Additionally, changes in metabolic rate in response to thermal stress were assessed for all four species. Our results indicated that spring-associated H. comalensis is most sensitive while the more cosmopolitan elmid M. pusillus is least sensitive to thermal stress. However, there were differences in temperature tolerances among the two spring-associated species: H. comalensis had relatively narrow thermal tolerance in comparison to H. cf. glabra. This could be due to differences in the climatic and hydrological conditions in the geographical regions which the respective riffle beetle populations reside. However, despite these differences, H. comalensis and H. cf. glabra showed a dramatic increase in their metabolic rates with increasing temperatures indicating that these species are indeed spring specialists and likely have a stenothermal profile.",2023,112,NA,NA

At normoxia, acute cold exposure did not affect the ventilatory variables, with the exception of HT males, in which cold prevented the reduced VE observed under thermoneutral conditions. Exposure to 20 degrees C caused a decrease in TB in both sexes, and LT and HT females presented a greater hypothermic response. Hypercapnia combined with cold did not alter the ventilatory vari-ables, but LT females and CT males and females showed a blunted CO2-induced hyperventilation due to a higher V O2, compared to the same groups in thermoneutral conditions. Unlike with thermoneutral conditions, the blunted hypercapnic hyperventilation observed in the HT groups was not observed during cold challenge. CO2 exposure promoted a similar decrease in TB in the thermoneutral and acutely cold exposed groups, while LT females under cold condition presented a blunted hypothermic response. During hypoxia, cold challenge attenuated the increase in VE in LT females and HT males, due to changes in VT. Hypoxic metabolic depression was greater in LT females and males and HT males during cold exposure, while no change in VE/ V O2 was observed. The only alteration in monoaminergic concentration under cold challenge was an increase in brain -stem 5-HIAA and 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio in HT females, and an enhanced 5-HT concentration in HT males. In summary, thermal manipulation during embryogenesis induces 14d old chicks to respond differently to cold stress with LT females and HT males being more sensitive.",2022,109,NA,NA

In this study, we cloned the ppar gamma cDNA of turbot (Scophthalmus maximus). It has a 1659 bp coding sequence (CDS) and encodes 552 amino acids. The deduced PPAR gamma protein of turbot contains two highly conserved domains, a C4-type zinc finger, a nuclear hormone receptor DNA-binding region signature, and a HOLI domain (ligand-binding domain of hormone receptors) identical to that of in other species. qPCR results showed that the expression level of ppar gamma and the expression of the fatty acid transporters fatp and cd36 were significantly increased under high-temperature stress. This indicates that high temperatures activate the transcriptional activity of ppar gamma, and lipid metabolism plays an important role in turbot under high-temperature stress. In addition, RNA interference was used to explore the regulation of ppar gamma on lipid metabolism of turbot at high temperatures. The results showed that the mRNA level of ppar gamma was significantly decreased. After the expression level of ppar gamma was inhibited, the expression levels of fatp and cd36 were significantly decreased. At the same time, GW9662 (a ppar gamma antagonist) was used to inhibit ppar gamma activity in turbot kidney cells, and fatp and cd36 gene expressions were detected. The mRNA expression levels of ppar gamma, fatp, and cd36 were significantly decreased. Our results suggest that high temperatures activate ppar gamma in turbot and that ppar gamma regulates lipid transport and maintains lipid metabolism homeostasis through positive regulation of the expression of downstream genes fatp and cd36.

An integrated approach that focuses on mechanisms of body temperature regulation, water balance and morphology may help to unravel the functional traits underpinning thermoregulation strategies and the most relevant trade-offs between temperature and water balance regulation. Here, we focused on four species of tunneler dung beetles as important providers of ecosystem services. In this experimental research, we first quantified two traits related to desiccation resistance and tolerance via experimental tests, and subsequently defined two levels of resistance and tolerance (i.e. low and high) according to significant differences among species. Second, we identified morphological traits correlated with water balance strategies, and we found that desiccation resistance and tolerance increased with small relative size of spiracles and wings. High levels of desiccation tolerance were also correlated with small body mass. Third, by integrating thermal tolerance with functional traits based on desiccation resistance and desiccation tolerance, we found that the species with the highest survival rates under elevated temperatures (Euoniticellus fulvus) was characterized by low desiccation resistance and high desiccation tolerance. Our results suggest shared physiological and morphological responses to temperature and desiccation, with potential conflicts between the need to regulate heat and water balance. They also highlighted the sensitivity of a large species such as Geotrupes stercorarius to warm and arid conditions with potential implications for its geographic distribution and the provisioning of ecosystem services under a climate change scenario.",2021,101,NA,NA

The present study evaluated for the first time the effect of high temperature stress in red cusk-eel juveniles to determine changes in plasmatic markers of stress (cortisol, glucose and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)), the transcriptional effect in skeletal muscle genes related to (i) heat shock protein response (hsp60 and hsp70), (ii) muscle atrophy and growth (foxo1, foxo3, fbxo32, murf-1, myod1 and ddit4), and (iii) oxidative stress (cat, sod1 and gpx1), and evaluate the DNA damage (AP sites) and peroxidative damage (lipid peroxidation (HNE proteins)) in this tissue. Thermal stress generates a significant increase in plasmatic levels of cortisol, glucose and LDH activity and induced heat shock protein transcripts in muscle. We also observed an upregulation of atrophy-related genes (foxo1, foxo3 and fbxo32) and a significant modulation of growth-related genes (myod1 and ddit4). Thermal stress induced oxidative stress in skeletal muscle, as represented by the upregulation of antioxidant genes (cat and sod1) and a significant increase in DNA damage and lipid peroxidation. The present study provides the first physiological and molecular information of the effects of thermal stress on skeletal muscle in a Genypterus species, which should be considered in a climate change scenario.",2020,94,NA,NA
Cyclical and stochastic thermal variability affects survival and growth in brook trout,"Pisano, Olivia M. and Kuparinen, Anna and Hutchings, Jeffrey A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.012,"Directional changes in temperature have well-documented effects on ectotherms, yet few studies have explored how increased thermal variability (a concomitant of climate change) might affect individual fitness. Using a common-garden experimental protocol, we investigated how bidirectional temperature change can affect survival and growth of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and whether the survival and growth responses differ between two populations, using four thermal-variability treatments (mean: 10 degrees C; range: 7-13 degrees C): (i) constancy; (ii) cyclical fluctuations every two days; (iii) low stochasticity (random changes every 2 days); (iv) high stochasticity (random changes daily). Recently hatched individuals were monitored under thermal variability (6 weeks) and a subsequent one-month period of thermal constancy. We found that variability can positively influence survival, relative to thermal constancy, but negatively affect growth. The observations reported here can be interpreted within the context of Jensen's Inequality (performance at average conditions is unequal to average performance across a range of conditions). Projections of future population viability in the context of climate change would be strengthened by increased experimental attention to the fitness consequences of stochastic and non-stochastic thermal variability.",2019,84,NA,221-227
High oxidative stress despite low energy metabolism and vice versa: Insights through temperature acclimation in an ectotherm,"Bury, Stanislaw and Cichon, Mariusz and Bauchinger, Ulf and Sadowska, Edyta T.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.08.003,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are inescapable byproducts of energy metabolism and may cause costly damage to biomolecules. Organisms have evolved different means to counter oxidative stress, such as modulation of ROS production, neutralization of produced ROS through free radical scavenging and the repair or removal of the damaged structures. A positive relationship between metabolic rate and ROS production is commonly expected, but the oxidative burden of aerobic metabolism remains poorly understood. We investigated whether acclimation to ambient temperatures imposing variation in standard metabolic rate (SMR) is mirrored in the oxidative status of an ectotherm. Grass snakes (Natrix natrix) acclimated for six months to warm (32 degrees C) conditions revealed seven times higher SMR compared to cold-acclimated (18 degrees C) individuals. In contrast to SMR, the amount of damage measured as reactive oxygen metabolites test (dROMs) and abundance of micronucleated erythrocytes was significantly lower in warm-acclimated individuals, while non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity of plasma was unaltered by thermal acclimation. Our results support that high SMR may allow snakes to better cope with oxidative stress, possibly through tissue repair or removal of damaged tissues that also requires energy costs. The reversed association between self-maintenance metabolism and oxidative damage to biomolecules provides novel rational for temperature dependent life histories of ectotherms. How oxidative stress may contribute to the known reduced rates of ectotherm growth or reproduction under cold temperatures or if oxidative stress may even drive such life history trait declines are now important challenges to be addressed.",2018,78,NA,36-41
"Warming, but not infection with Borrelia burgdorferi , increases off-host winter activity in the ectoparasite, Ixodes scapularis","Ferguson, Laura V. and El Nabbout, Amal and Adamo, Shelley A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103853,"Warming winters will change patterns of behaviour in temperate and polar arthropods, but we know little about the drivers of winter activity in animals such as ticks. Any changes in behaviour are likely to arise from a combination of both abiotic (e.g. temperature) and biotic (e.g. infection) drivers, and will have important consequences for survival and species interactions. Blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis, have invaded Atlantic Canada and high proportions (30-50\%) are infected with the bacteria causing Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi. Infection is correlated with increased overwintering survival of adult females, and ticks are increasingly active in the winter, but it is unclear if infection is associated with activity. Further, we know little about how temperature drives the frequency of winter activity. Here, we exposed wild-caught, adult, female Ixodes scapularis ticks to three different winter temperature regimes (constant low temperatures, increased warming, and increased warming + variability) to determine the thermal and infection conditions that promote or suppress activity. We used automated behaviour monitors to track daily activity in individual ticks and repeated the study with fresh ticks over three years. Following exposure to winter conditions we determined whether ticks were infected with the bacteria B. burgdorferi and if infection was responsible for any patterns in winter activity. Warming conditions promoted increased activity throughout the overwintering period but infection with B. burgdorferi had no impact on the frequency or overall number of ticks active throughout the winter. Individual ticks varied in their levels of activity throughout the winter, such that some were largely dormant for several weeks, while others were active almost daily; however, we do not yet know the drivers behind this individual variation in behaviour. Overall, warming winters will heighten the risk of tick-host encounters.",2024,121,NA,NA

However, the in vivo functions and mechanisms of action remain largely unknown or unclear for most members of the sHSPs in insects. This study investigated the expression of CfHSP20.2 in the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.) under normal and heat-stress conditions. Under normal conditions, CfHSP20.2 transcript and protein were highly and constantly expressed in the testes of male larvae, pupae and young adults and in the ovaries of female late-stage pupae and adults. After adult eclosion, CfHSP20.2 remained highly and almost constantly expressed in the ovaries, but in contrast, was downregulated in the testes. Upon heat stress, CfHSP20.2 was upregulated in the gonads and non-gonadal tissues in both sexes. These results indicate that CfHSP20.2 expression is gonad-specific and heat-inducible. This provides evidence that the CfHSP20.2 protein plays important roles during reproductive development under normal environmental conditions, while under heat-stress conditions, it may also enhance the thermal tolerance of the gonads and non-gonadal tissues.",2023,112,NA,NA
Fish pre-acclimation temperature only modestly affects cadmium toxicity in Atlantic salmon hepatocytes,"Olsvik, Pal A. and Softeland, Liv and Hevroy, Ernst M. and Rasinger, Josef D. and Waagbo, Rune",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.02.003,"An emerging focus in environmental toxicology is how climate change will alter bioavailability and uptake of contaminants in organisms. Ectothermic animals unable to adjust their temperature by local migration, such as farmed fish kept in net pens, may become more vulnerable to contaminants in warmer seas. The aim of this work was to study cadmium (Cd) toxicity in cells obtained from fish acclimated to sub-optimal growth temperature. Atlantic salmon hepatocytes, harvested from fish pre-acclimated either at 15 degrees C (optimal growth temperature) or 20 degrees C (heat-stressed), were exposed in vitro to two concentrations of Cd (control, 1 and 100 mu m Cd) for 48 h. Cd-induced cytotoxicity, determined with the xCELLigence system, was more pronounced in cells from fish pre-acclimated to a high temperature than in cells from fish grown at optimal temperature. A feed spiked with antioxidants could not ameliorate the Cd-induced cytotoxicity in cells from temperature-stressed fish. At the transcriptional level, Cd exposure affected 11 out of 20 examined genes, of which most are linked to oxidative stress. The transcriptional levels of a majority of the altered genes were changed in cells harvested from fish grown at sub-optimal temperature. Interaction effects between Cd exposure and fish pre-acclimation temperature were seen for four transcripts, hmox1, mapk1, fth1 and mmp13. Overall, this study shows that cells from temperature-stressed fish are modestly more vulnerable to Cd stress, and indicate that mechanisms linked to oxidative stress may be differentially affected in temperature-stressed cells.

Corticosterone tissue-specific response in Sprague Dawley rats under acute heat stress,"Dou, Jinhuan and Montanholi, Yuri R. and Wang, Zezhao and Li, Zhongshu and Yu, Ying and Martell, Janel E. and Wang, Ya Jing and Wang, Yachun",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.02.004,"Our study evaluated the physiological responses to acute heat stress in rats via body temperature and tissue corticosterone levels, and investigated the relative tissue response to heat stress based on corticosterone. Body temperature of rats under 22 degrees C (control) and 42 degrees C for 30 (H30), 60 (H60) and 120 min (H120) was measured. Correspondingly, corticosterone was analyzed in 11 tissues (adrenal, brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, leg muscle, blood, stomach, spleen and small intestine). Analysis of variance and correlations were conducted on body temperature and corticosterone levels. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyzed the thereto-sensitivity via corticosterone. Body temperature of rats in H30, H60 and H120 groups were higher (P < 0.05) than the control. Compared to the control, corticosterone levels of heart, stomach and small intestine at H30, corticosterone levels in adrenal, leg muscle and stomach at H60, and corticosterone levels in adrenal, heart, lung, stomach and small intestine at H120 differed (P < 0.05). The corticosterone in lung tissue was an excellent indicator of acute heat stress, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 1.00 at H60 and H120. In order to improve the prediction of acute heat stress, models combining corticosterone levels of multiple tissues reached an AUC of 1.00 for H30, and the sensitivity increased to 100\% for H60 and H120. In conclusion, changes in the patterns and thermosensitivity of corticosterone levels associated with the duration of heat stress across body tissues were evidenced. The single and multi-organizational corticosterone models serve as indicators for evaluating heat stress across different time periods.",2019,81,NA,12-19
Susceptibility to entomopathogens and modulation of basal immunity in two insect models at different temperatures,"Mastore, Maristella and Quadroni, Silvia and Toscano, Andrea and Mottadelli, Nicole and Brivio, Maurizio F.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.11.006,"In this work, we analysed the efficacy of different commercial bio-insecticides (Steinernema feltiae, Steinernema carpocapsae, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and Bacillus thuringiensis) by valuating the mortality induced on two insect models, Galleries mellonella (Lepidoptera) and Sarcophaga africa (Diptera) after exposure to different temperatures (10, 20 and 30 degrees C). Moreover, we investigated the effects of temperature on the basal humoral immunity of the two target insects; particularly, phenoloxidase (PO) and lysozyme activity. Our results show that G. mellonella is susceptible to all bio-insecticides at all the examined temperatures, except when infected at 10 degrees C with S. carpocapsae and at 30 degrees C with S. feltiae and B. thuringiensis. S. africa is more susceptible at 30 degrees C to all bioinsecticides; whereas, when infected at 10 and 20 degrees C, H. bacteriophora is the most efficient. Temperature modulates PO activity of both G. mellonella and S. africa, otherwise variations in lysozyme activity is observed only in G. mellonella. Except for a possible correlation between the increased lysozyme activity and the delayed Bt efficacy recorded on G. mellonella at 30 degrees C, a different resistance to bio-insecticides at different temperatures does not seem to be associated to variations of the host basal immunity, probably due to immunoevasive and immunodepressive strategies of these entomopathogens.",2019,79,NA,15-23
Body temperature regulation during acclimation to cold and hypoxia in rats,"Cadena, V. and Tattersall, G. J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2014.10.007,"Extreme environmental conditions present challenges for thermoregulation in homoeothermic organisms such as mammals. Such challenges are exacerbated when two stressors are experienced simultaneously and each stimulus evokes opposing physiological responses. This is the case of cold, which induces an increase in thermogenesis, and hypoxia, which suppresses metabolism conserving oxygen and preventing hypoxaemia. As an initial approach to understanding the thermoregulatory responses to cold and hypoxia in a small mammal, we explored the effects of acclimation to these two stressors on the body temperature (T-b) and the daily and ultradian T-b variations of Sprague-Dawley rats. As T-b is influenced by sleep-wake cycles, these T-b variations reflect underlying adjustments in set-point and thermosensitivity. The T-b of rats decreased precipitously during initial hypoxic exposure which was more pronounced in cold (T-b=33.4 +/- 0.13) than in room temperature (T-b=35.74 +/- 0.17) conditions. This decline was followed by an increase in T-b stabilising at a new level similar to 0.5 degrees C and similar to 1.4 degrees C below normoxic values at room and cold temperatures, respectively. Daily T-b variations were blunted during hypoxia with a greater effect in the cold. Ultradian T-b variations exhibited daily rhythmicity that disappeared under hypoxia, independent of ambient temperature. The adjustments in T-b during hypoxia and/or cold are in agreement with the hypothesis that an initial decrease in the T-b set-point is followed by its partial re-establishment with chronic hypoxia. This rebound of the T-b set-point might reflect cellular adjustments that would allow animals to better deal with low oxygen conditions, diminishing the drive for a lower T-b set-point. Cold and hypoxia are characteristic of high altitude environments. Understanding how mammals cope with changes in oxygen and temperature will shed light into their ability to colonize new environments along altitudinal dines and increase our understanding of how T-b is regulated under stimuli that impose contrasting physiological constraints.

Unusual change in activity pattern at cool temperature in a reptile (<i>Sphenodon punctatus</i>),"Vermunt, Aurelie and Hare, Kelly M. and Besson, Anne A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2014.02.021,"Animals that can be active both during day and night offer unique opportunities to identify factors that influence activity pattern. By experimental manipulations of temperatures under constant photoperiod, we aimed to determine if emergence, activity and thermoregulatory behaviour of juvenile tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus) varied at different temperatures (20 degrees C, 12 degrees C and 5 degrees C). To help clarify its activity pattern, we compared tuatara with two lizard species endemic of the South Island of New Zealand for which activity pattern is known and clearly defined: the nocturnal common gecko Woodworthia `' Otago/ Southland `' and the diurnal McCann's skink Oligosoma maccanni. Tuatara showed similar responses to both species of lizards. Similar to the diurnal skinks, tuatara emerged quickly at 20 degrees C and 12 degrees C while nocturnal geckos took more time to emerge. Like nocturnal geckos, tuatara continued to be active at 5 degrees C, but only during the day. Interestingly, tuatara shifted from diurno-nocturnal activity at 20 degrees C and 12 degrees C to being strictly diurnal at 5 degrees C. We suggest that this temperature-dependent strategy maximises their survival during cold periods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2014,42,NA,40-45

The interactive effect between temperature and ammonia concentration on the percent fertilization was not significant (P > 0.05). (2) The linear effect of temperature on the percent hatching was highly significant (P < 0.01), and that of ammonia concentration was nonsignificant (P > 0.05). The quadratic effects of temperature and ammonia concentration on the percent hatching were highly significant (P < 0.01). The interaction on the percent hatching was not significant (P > 0.05).

However, as this Ta is well below the mouse thermoneutral zone (TNZ) of 3032 degrees C, typical vivarium temperatures result in cold stress for mice. Recently, a cage has been developed that provides variable cage floor heating, allowing mice to behaviorally regulate body temperature through thermotaxis. A hand warmer provides supplemental heat, elevating cage floor surface temperature for 13 + hours up to 30 degrees C. This provides a heated surface for the entirety of the light phase. Here, we test the ability of these local heat sources to remove physiological signs of cold stress in mice housed at room temperature by analyzing heart rate (HR), activity, and body temperature in three experimental conditions: 23 degrees C, 23 degrees C + heated surface, or 30 degrees C. The location of C57Bl/6 J mice within the cage was recorded using an infrared camera. In the presence of supplemental heat at a Ta of 23 degrees C, mice resided atop of the area of the heated surface 85 +/- 3\% of the 12-h light phase, as compared to 7 +/- 2\% in the absence of supplemental heat. Further, addition of supplemental heat lowered light phase HR and activity to that seen at a Ta of 30 degrees C. These results indicate that provision of a local heat source is successful in reducing cold-induced tachycardia in mice housed at typical vivarium temperatures without increasing the ambient temperature of the entire laboratory and subjecting researchers to heat stress.",2019,79,NA,149-154

Any change in temperature from the ambient condition can induce various metabolic and physiological changes in the body. The present study evaluates the effects of temperature induced stress on the antioxidant profile of Etroplus suratensis such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and lipid peroxidation. Fishes of same size were kept in a thermostatized bath at three different temperature regimes viz 16 degrees C, 27 degrees C (ambient temperature) and 38 degrees C for 72 h. These temperatures were selected based on the CT Max (Critical Thermal Maximum) and CT Min (Critical Thermal Minimum) exhibited by E. suratensis. Superoxide dismutase and catalase activity was found maximum in brain and muscle respectively during the 48th hour of exposure in fishes kept at 38 degrees C. At 16 degrees C the antioxidant response of glutathione peroxidase was maximum in muscles, whereas the lipid peroxidation rate was found to be high in gills compared to other tissues. The profound increase in the levels of oxidative stress related biomarkers indicate that the thermal stressors severely affected oxidative state of E. suratensis by the second day of experiment. Such down-regulation of redox state accompanied with the induction of oxidative stress cascade may lead to physiological damage in various tissues in fishes, in vivo. However current data indicate that a transition to low and high temperature environment from ambient condition severely affected the levels and profile of the antioxidant markers overtime in E. suratensis.",2017,70,B,20-26

The birds were kept in two separate rooms at 24 degrees C or 36 degrees C from 32 to 42 d of age with four experimental groups in each room. The birds fed on the diets supplemented containing rich sources of long-chain saturated fatty acids (beef tallow), middle-length-chain saturated FA (coconut oil), monounsaturated FA (olive oil), or polyunsaturated FA (soybean oil) for ten days. At 36 degrees C, the highest body weight and lowest feed conversion ratio were recorded in the birds fed on the diets supplemented with coconut oil or beef tallow. Temperature and fat type significantly affected the activities of the mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes (P < 0.01). There was a significant interaction between the temperature and fat type (P < 0.01). Generally, electron transport chain complexes I-V enzymatic activities were decreased at 36 degrees C. The coconut oil-fed birds showed the highest complex I activity at both temperatures. The beef tallow-fed broilers showed the lowest complex II activity at 24 degrees C. In birds exposed to 36 degrees C, complex II activity was higher for birds fed saturated coconut oil or beef tallow than those feeding the unsaturated olive oil or soybean oil-supplemented diets. At 24 degrees C, the highest and lowest complex III activities were recorded for the coconut oil- and beef tallow-supplemented diets, respectively. At 36 degrees C, the activity of complex III was coconut oil > beef tallow > olive oil > soybean oil. At 24 degrees C, complex IV activity was highest in coconut oil- or soybean oil-fed broilers; and at 36 degrees C, complex IV showed the lowest activity in soybean oil-fed birds.

Effect of heat acclimation on anxiety-like behavior of rats in an open field,"Nakagawa, Hikaru and Matsunaga, Daisuke and Ishiwata, Takayuki",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102458,"To mitigate the impacts of heat exposure, animals can take some actions to maintain their core body temperature, such as heat acclimation; however, the effect of heat acclimation on anxiety-like behavior in an open field is still not understood. The purpose of this study was to examine the anxiety-like behavior of heat acclimated rats in a temperate or heated open field. After being raised in a 23 degrees C environment for one week, male Wistar rats were exposed to a heated environment (32 degrees C) for 3 h (3H), 14 days (14D), or 28 days (28D), with free access to food and water, and compared with rats reared in a temperate environment (23 degrees C; Cont). After heat exposure, behavioral changes were monitored using an open field test (OFT) in a heated (32 degrees C) or temperate environment (23 degrees C). Compared with those in the Cont group, the body weights of rats in the 14D and 28D groups were lower. The OFT in the heated environment showed that grooming time was longer in 3H and 14D rats. In the temperate environment, grooming time was longer in all the heated groups. Rats from the 3H and 28D groups spent longer time in the center square when tested in the temperate environment. Rearing activity increased in 28D rats in the temperate environment, while the number of line crossings did not differ significantly between the heated groups and the two open fields. These results suggest that heat acclimation affected not only the physiological index such as core body temperature but also the anxiety-like behavior, mainly in the temperate open field. These changes might be beneficial when rats are faced with an open field.",2020,87,NA,NA

To fully evaluate the effects, thermal treatment was given between embryonic ages 11 and 24 days with a 1 degrees C higher incubation temperature than the control group, and lipid metabolism parameters in the liver and blood serum were analyzed both at embryonic stage day 20 and 2 weeks post-hatching. Our results showed no significant changes in the embryonic stage in total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the blood serum (P > 0.05). Additionally, the mRNA expression levels and enzyme activities of fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), and elongase of very long chain fatty acids (ELOVL) did not show significant changes either in the embryonic stage or at hatching day 20 (P > 0.05). However, there were significant changes in the gene expression and enzyme activities of TC, LDL-C and FAS at post-hatching stages (P <= 0.05). These results may indicate that the thermal treatment has less influence on lipid metabolism in the embryonic stage but has a much stronger effect in the post-hatching stage. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The developmental threshold temperature and the thermal summation constant were estimated as 12.0 +/- 0.5 degrees C and 4989.7 +/- 308.9 degrees hours, respectively. A general model represented by a logistic equation describing how larval body length will change with the time after hatching was fit to data. The present study provides basic developmental data of M. spiracularis, which can be used for achieving better control of this noxious insect as well as for estimation of its PMImin at different temperatures.",2020,93,NA,NA
Cortex senses environmental temperature earlier than the hypothalamus in awake rats,"Vishwakarma, Lal Chandra and Sengupta, Trina and Jaryal, Ashok Kumar and Mallick, Hruda Nanda",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102652,"Simultaneous and direct recording of temperature from the body, hypothalamus, and cortex in animals exposed to acute thermal challenges lack evidence. This study was conducted to assess the usual concept, that brain temperature is rather stable when animals are exposed to different ambient temperatures. In this study, we report the characteristic changes in the body, hypothalamic, and cortical temperature, when the rats were acutely exposed to cold (6 degrees C) and hot (36 degrees C) ambient temperature. The results of our study show that the body temperature is robustly regulated while hypothalamic and cortical temperatures vary on challenges to ambient cold (6 degrees C) and warm (36 degrees C) exposure in awake rats. The onset of response was observed quickest in the cortex, indicating that the cortical thermal sensing may relay intracranial thermal input to the hypothalamus for the regulation of body temperature within narrow limits.

"Heat shock sensitivity of adult male fertility in the parasitoid wasp <i>Anisopteromalus calandrae</i> (Hymenoptera, Pteromalidae)","Chevrier, Claude and Thanh Manh Nguyen and Christophe, Bressac",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102419,"In insects, decreased reproduction is a sublethal consequence of high temperatures, with males being more sensitive to this in many species. In hymenoptera, arrhenotokous parthenogenesis means that female offspring are produced using sperm and are thus diploid, while males are haploid. Consequently, sperm stocks in males and females (after copulation) are a key regulator of the sex ratio. Anisopteromalus calandrae is a parasitoid wasp in which males can suffer from subfertility due to a drastic decrease in sperm count after exposure to high temperatures during a critical early pupal stage. However, in this species spermatogenesis continues during adulthood, therefore the heat sensitivity of adult males remains to be studied. Laboratory studies were conducted on virgin and previously mated young adult males under control (30 degrees C) and heat shock (10 min at 48 degrees C) conditions to exhaust their initial sperm stock. After heat shock, in both virgin and already mated males, the individual sperm potential was half that of controls. Both groups continuously produced sperm, but sperm stock of heat shocked males' never reached that of the controls. Heat shock reduced survival at 10 days only in previously experienced males but had no impact on the mating ability in competition for a female compared to controls. Despite a reduced sperm count, heat shocked males had fully fertile spermatozoa. Such a physiological response to heat shock in a species with continuous sperm production could be of major interest for both wild populations in a context of temperature variations and parasitoid wasps introduced for agronomical purposes.",2019,85,NA,NA
"Chronic heat stress alters hypothalamus integrity, the serum indexes and attenuates expressions of hypothalamic appetite genes in broilers","He, Xiaofang and Lu, Zhuang and Ma, Bingbing and Zhang, Lin and Li, Jiaolong and Jiang, Yun and Zhou, Guanghong and Gao, Feng",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.02.025,"The hypothalamus is crucial to ensure the functionality of the entire organisms, such as body temperature, feed intake and energy regulation. Exposing broilers to high ambient temperature usually induces lower feed intake and energy imbalance. We investigated the molecular mechanisms by which heat stress impairs the appetite via dysfunction in hypothalamus of the broilers. Broilers were allocated to three groups: the normal control (NC) group, and fed ad libitum; heat-stress (HS) group, and fed ad libitum; pair-fed (PF) group, which received the feed intake equal to HS group. Experiment lasted from the age of 28 to 42 d. The results showed that HS increased the head surface temperature of broiler and changed hypothalamic ultrastructure. HS treatment also increased the serum corticosterone in the broilers after 7 days of heat stress, elevated the FT4 and FT3 after 14 days of heat stress. Heat stress of 14 days showed a tendency to increase the leptin. However, the serum corticosterone in the HS group had no significant difference after 14 days of heat stress. In addition, HS treatment decreased the expression of orexigenic gene neuropeptide Y (NPY) after 14 days of heat stress, while HS treatment had no effect on the reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as the gene expression of AMPK alpha 1 and LKB1 in the hypothalamus. In conclusion, HS increased the surface temperature of head in broiler, and then altered the integrity of hypothalamus. Meanwhile, HS increased the serum corticosterone which may ascribe to the activation of HPA axis in the broilers. In addition, chronic heat stress decreased the expression of orexigenic gene NPY, which may cause the broiler to reduce feed intake.",2019,81,NA,110-117
Genetic components in a thermal developmental plasticity of the beetle <i>Tribolium castaneum</i>,"Czarnoleski, Marcin and Kramarz, Paulina and Malek, Dariusz and Drobniak, Szymon M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.01.015,"Low developmental temperatures cause ectotherms to retard growth, postpone maturation, and emerge at either larger or smaller adult size. In this study, we explored how these thermal responses evolved, focusing on their genetic basis. We applied a full diallel breeding design on inbred lines of the flour beetle, Tribolium castatteum. To assess the proportional contributions of genetic and non-genetic effects, each genotype, a unique combination of parental haplotypes, was reared from an egg to imago at five developmental temperatures. Faster development of females vs. males was associated with comparatively larger body masses of females (pupae and imago). In contrast, the rapid development caused by warmer environments resulted in smaller beetles (pupae and imago), but there were significant differences in this trait among genotypes. Independent effects of parental haplotypes played the major role in explaining the variance of body mass, but interactive effects of parental haplotypes explained most of the variance in developmental length. Genotypes responded to the thermal environment in a markedly uniform way. Nevertheless, we found the low statistically significant variance in the slopes of thermal reaction norms for body mass and developmental, which was mainly driven by the interactive effects of parental haplotypes. Overall, the thermal plasticity of T. castaneum follows the most common pattern among ectotherms, the so-called temperature-size rule. Detection of the low genetic variance in the shape of this response supports the idea that thermal developmental plasticity remains under a strong selective pressure in ectotherms.",2017,68,A,55-62
Embryos of non-native anoles are robust to urban thermal environments,"Tiatragul, Sarin and Kurniawan, Audeline and Kolbe, Jason J. and Warner, Daniel A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.02.021,"The transformation of natural habitats into urban landscapes dramatically alters thermal environments, which in turn, can impact local biota. Ectothermic organisms that are oviparous are particularly sensitive to these altered environments because their embryos cannot behaviorally thermoregulate and the surrounding environment determines the temperature experienced during development. We studied the effects of urban and forested thermal environments on embryo development and hatchling phenotypes in two non-native lizards (Anolis sagrei and A. cristatellus) in metropolitan Miami, Florida. To determine if embryos from urban and forested sites are adapted to their respective thermal environments, we incubated eggs from each site using temperatures that simulate likely nest conditions in both urban and forested environments. For both species, urban thermal environments accelerated embryonic development, but had no impact on egg survival or any of the phenotypic traits that were measured (e.g., body size, running performance, and locomotor behavior). Our results provide no evidence that embryos from urban and forested sites are adapted to their respective thermal environments. Instead, the lack of any major effects suggest that embryos of both species are physiologically robust with respect to novel environments, which could have facilitated their success in establishing in nonnative ranges and in human-modified landscapes.",2017,65,NA,119-124
Food restriction attenuates oxidative stress in brown adipose tissue of striped hamsters acclimated to a warm temperature,"Zhang, Ji-Ying and Zhao, Xiao-Ya and Wang, Gui-Ying and Wang, Chun-Ming and Zhao, Zhi-Jun",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.04.003,"It has been suggested that the up-regulation of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) decreases reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, in which case there should be a negative relationship between UCPs expression and ROS levels. In this study, the effects of temperature and food restriction on ROS levels and metabolic rate, UCP1 mRNA expression and antioxidant levels were examined in the brown adipose tissue (BAT) of the striped hamsters (Cricetulus barabensis). The metabolic rate and food intake of hamsters which had been restricted to 80\% of ad libitum food intake, and acclimated to a warm temperature (30 degrees C), decreased significantly compared to a control group. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels were 42.9\% lower in food restricted hamsters than in the control. Malonadialdehyde (MDA) levels of hamsters acclimated to 30 degrees C that were fed ad libitum were significantly higher than those of the control group, but 60.1\% lower than hamsters that had been acclimated to the same temperature but subject to food restriction. There were significantly positive correlations between H2O2 and, MDA levels, catalase activity, and total antioxidant capacity. Cytochrome c oxidase activity and UCP1 mRNA expression significantly decreased in food restricted hamsters compared to the control. These results suggest that warmer temperatures increase oxidative stress in BAT by causing the down-regulation of UCP1 expression and decreased antioxidant activity, but food restriction may attenuate the effects.

Capacity for protein synthesis following heat stimulus of <i>Drosophila</i> associates with heat tolerance but does not underlie the latitudinal tolerance cline,"Cockerell, Fiona E. and Sgro, Carla M. and McKechnie, Stephen W.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2013.09.004,"Across populations of Drosophila melanogaster along the Australian eastern coastline latitudinal dines occur in both heat-knockdown tolerance and hardened heat-knockdown tolerance - low latitude tropical populations being more tolerant. A latitudinal dine also occurs for rates of total protein synthesis following a mild heat stress, with tropical populations having higher rates. Since the control of protein synthesis following heat stress is an important component of the cellular heat-shock response, we hypothesised that the higher rates of synthesis that follow a heat stimulus lead to higher knockdown tolerance and underpins the dine. However, levels of heat-stimulated total protein synthesis have been negatively related to heat-hardening capacity, a somewhat conflicting result. Here we examine the relationship between these physiological and adaptive traits in a set of 40 family lines derived from a hybrid laboratory population established by crossing populations from either end of the latitudinal transect. Among these lines high levels of heat-stimulated total protein synthesis were associated with both low basal and low heat-hardened adult knockdown time, confirming the importance of a negative relationship between protein synthesis and thermal tolerance. This result, when considered along with the directions of the latitudinal dines in protein synthesis and tolerance, suggests that variation in rates of heat-stimulated total protein synthesis is not a factor contributing to the latitudinal dine in heat tolerance. Given the robustness of this negative relationship we discuss possible explanations and future experiments to elucidate how the cellular heat stress response might facilitate increased knockdown tolerance.

Hypoxia and temperature: Does hypoxia affect caiman embryo differentiation rate or rate of growth only?,"Iungman, J. L. and Pina, C. I.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2013.05.003,"In crocodilians, the rate of embryonic development and consequently many posthatch attributes are affected by temperature. Since temperature exhibits strong influences on fitness (embryo survivorship and phenotype) by shaping development, we manipulated oxygen concentration in order to uncouple the effects of developmental rate from the direct effects of temperature. Here we consider whether oxygen constrains either differentiation rate (progression from one stage to the next) or embryonic growth (size). Thus, we incubated Caiman latirostris eggs at various oxygen concentrations, and at two temperatures (31 degrees C, 100\% female-producing temperature, and 33 degrees C, 100\% male-producing temperature). We monitored the developmental stages of these embryos within the thermosensitive period (stages 20-24), and assessed several physiological and morphological hatchling traits. While embryonic size was strongly influenced by oxygen, differentiation rate did not seem to be affected. Very low oxygen concentrations and high temperatures inhibited embryo survival. In addition, oxygen availability affected incubation period and hatchling size, whereas temperature did not cause a significant variation in hatchling size. By investing energy in differentiation hypoxic embryos decreased their size. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2013,38,7,407-418

To elucidate the molecular and biological processes of the temperature modulation of reproduction and immunity, female Nile tilapia (190 +/- 10g) were allocated into five groups following acclimatization (150 females, three replicates, each n = 10). Each group was subjected to various temperatures (28 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 32 degrees C, 34 degrees C, and 37 degrees C), the group at 28 degrees C representing the control. Their serum levels of estradiol, cortisol, and vitellogenin were measured as well as serum triiodothymnine (T3) hormone, thyroxine (T4) hormone, and non-specific immunity (phagocytic and lysozyme activity). In addition, stemidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR), vitellogenin gene receptor, and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) gene expression were evaluated. The serum levels of estradiol, cortisol, and vitellogenin markedly declined (P < 0.05) in fish group at higher temperatures. In addition to T3, T4 was significantly affected (P < 0.05) in the control group. The expressions of the STAR gene (steroidogenesis) and vitellogenin receptors were also considerably down-regulated. The histopathological photomicrograph of fish subjected to high water temperature revealed injuries in ovary tissues, demonstrating its harmful effects. The experimental results verified the possible role of water temperature as a main stressor on Nile tilapia' physiology through modulation of steroidogenesis-related gene expression and immunity.",2020,91,NA,NA

Osmoregulatory capacity parameters (plasma osmolality, sodium, chloride, cortisol, and branchial and renal Na+ ,K+ -ATPase activities) were also assessed. Salinity and temperature affected all of the parameters tested. Our results indicate that environmental temperature modulates capacity in sea bream, independent of environmental salinity, and set points of plasma osmolality and ion concentrations depend on both ambient salinity and temperature. Acclimation to extreme salinity resulted in stress, indicated by elevated basal plasma cortisol levels. Response to salinity was affected by ambient temperature. A comparison between branchial and renal Na+,K (+)-ATPase activities appears instrumental in explaining salinity and temperature responses. Sea bream regulate branchial enzyme copy numbers (V-max) in hyperosmotic media (SW and HSW) to deal with ambient temperature effects on activity; combinations of high temperatures and salinity may exceed the adaptive capacity of sea bream. Salinity compromises the branchial enzyme capacity (compared to basal activity at a set salinity) when temperature is elevated and the scope for temperature adaptation becomes smaller at increasing salinity. Renal Na+,K+ -ATPase capacity appears fixed and activity appears to be determined by temperature.",2020,88,NA,NA
The cooling time of fertile chicken eggs at different stages of incubation,"Mortola, Jacopo P. and Gaonac'h-Lovejoy, Vanda",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2015.10.009,"We asked whether or not the thermal characteristics of fertile avian eggs changed throughout incubation. The cooling and warming times, expressed by the time constants tau of the egg temperature response to a rapid change in ambient temperature, were measured in fertile chicken eggs at early (E7), intermediate (E11) and late (E20) stages of embryonic development. Same measurements were conducted on eggs emptied of their content and refilled with water by various amounts. The results indicated that (1) the tau of a freshly laid egg was similar to 50 min; (2) tau decreased linearly with the drop in egg water volume; (3) the dry eggshell had almost no thermal resistance but its wet inner membrane contributed about one-third to the stability of egg temperature; (4) the egg constituents (yolk, albumen and embryonic tissues) and the chorioallantoic circulation had no measurable effect on tau; (5) the presence of an air pocket equivalent in volume to the air cell of fertile eggs reduced tau by about 3 min (E7), 5 min (E11) and 11 min (E20). Hence, in response to warming the egg tau at E20 was slightly shorter than at E7. In response to cooling, the egg tau at E20 was similar to, or longer than, E7 because embryonic thermogenesis (evaluated by measurements of oxygen consumption during cold) offset the reduction in tau introduced by the air cell. In conclusion, until the onset of thermogenesis the thermal behavior of a fertile egg is closely approximated by that of a water-filled egg with an air volume equivalent to the air cell. It is possible to estimate the cooling tau of avian eggs of different species from their weight and incubation time. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2016,55,NA,7-13

Scott and Schwanz, Lisa E.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2014.04.007,"Incubation temperature is one of the most studied factors driving phenotypic plasticity in oviparous reptiles. We examined how incubation temperature influenced hatchling morphology, thermal preference and temperature-dependent running speed in the small Australian agamid lizard Amphibolurus muricatus. Hatchlings incubated at 32 degrees C grew more slowly than those incubated at 25 and 28 degrees C during their first month after hatching, and tended to be smaller at one month. These differences were no longer significant by three months of age due to selective mortality of the smallest hatchlings. The cooler incubation treatments (25 degrees C and 28 degrees C) produced lizards that had deeper and wider heads. Hatchlings from 28 degrees C had cooler and more stable temperature preferences, and also had lower body temperatures during a 2-h thermoregulatory behaviour trial. Locomotor performance was enhanced at higher body temperatures, but incubation temperature had no measurable effect either independently or in interaction with body temperature. Our study demonstrates that incubation temperature has direct effects on morphology and thermoregulatory behaviour that appears to be independent of any size-dependent effects. We postulate a mechanistic link between these two effects. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2014,43,NA,33-39

It has been suggested that the spitting spider Scytodes globula may be a predator of L laeta and control its population, which is only possible if they share the microhabitat. This study compared the thermal preferences and tolerances of the two species. Later, spiders acclimated to 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C were exposed to decreasing and increasing temperatures to determine the lower and upper critical temperatures. The preferred temperatures were lower during the morning, but there were no differences between the species. The thermal niche breadths were similar for the species, with a large overlap. Both species showed tolerance to extreme temperatures, but L laeta showed greater tolerance to low temperatures. Both species showed acclimation of the lower critical temperatures to changes in acclimation temperatures. The similarity of preferred and tolerated temperatures was partly an expected fact, since the species share the same macrohabitat; these spider species are very common in domestic environments of central Chile. However, the results imply that their microhabitat choices are also very similar, indicating a high probability of meeting and predation, which could have important consequences in loxoscelism epidemiology.

Experimental groups contained two control groups (normal temperature control (NC) and heat stress control (HC) and 3 heat stress curcumin treatment groups (HT100, HT200 and HT300). Hens in HC group with basal diet and heat stress curcumin treatment groups were exposed 6 h/day heat stress (32 +/- 1 degrees C) from 10:00 a.m. to 16:00 p.m. for 9 week. The results of present study showed that heat stressed curcumin treatment group had improved liver weight, WBC values and immunoglobulin level as compared to untreated HC and NC groups. The available results also indicated that laying hens supplemented with curcumin under high temperature conditions had reduced H/L ratio, serum corticosterone levels, inflammatory cytokines response and liver enzymatic activity (ALT) which enhanced the immunity of laying hens under hot climatic conditions. Therefore, it is concluded that curcumin has ability to combat harsh environmental conditions which can be used as anti-inflammatory and immune booster feed additive in the poultry nutrition.",2020,90,NA,NA
Temperature-related heart rate in water and air and a comparison to other temperature-related measures of performance in the fiddler crab <i>Leptuca pugilator</i> (Bosc 1802),"Levinton, Jeffrey S. and Volkenborn, Nils and Gurr, Samuel and Correal, Kelly and Villacres, Sebastian and Seabra, Rui and Lima, Fernando P.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102502,"Performance in poikilotherms is known to be sensitive to temperature, often with a low-sloping increase with temperature to a peak, and a steep decline with increasing temperature past the peak. We complemented past measures of performance by measuring heartbeat rates of the fiddler crab Leptuca pugilator in water and in air as a function of a range of temperatures previously shown to affect other measures of performance. In water over a range of 20-50 degrees C, heartbeat increased steadily to a peak at 40 degrees C and then steeply declined to near zero at 50 degrees C. In air, heartbeat also increased, but to a peak at 35 degrees C and then with a gentler decline than was found in water. Part of this different response may be due to evaporative water loss, which reduced body temperature in air, and therefore thermal stress, relative to body temperature when crabs were immersed in water. Increased availability of oxygen from air, according to the oxygen and capacity-limited thermal tolerance hypothesis, likely increased aerobic scope past the thermal peak, relative to within water, where oxygen delivery at higher temperatures may have been curtailed. We compared the heart rate performance relations to two previous measures of performance - endurance on a treadmill and sprint speed, both done in air. The peak performance temperature increased in the order: treadmill endurance time, sprint speed, heart rate in air, and heart rate in water, which demonstrates that different performance measures give different perspectives on the relation of thermal tolerance and fitness to temperature. Endurance may therefore be the limiting upper thermal stress factor in male fiddler crabs, when on hot sand flats. Temperature preference, found to be for temperatures <30 degrees C in air, could be a bet-hedging evolutionary strategy to avoid aerobic scope affecting endurance.",2020,88,NA,NA

After 3 weeks of heat acclimation, gerbils exhibited a lower body temperature than the controls, and no difference in evaporative losses of water from the lung or saliva spreading compared with the controls. Heat acclimation did not alter the expression of aquaporin-1 and aquaporin-5 in the lungs and the expression of aquaporin-5 in the salivary glands.

Expression of thermal tolerance genes in two <i>Drosophila</i> species with different acclimation capacities,"Sorensen, Jesper Givskov and Puig Giribets, Marta and Tarrio, Rosa and Rodriguez-Trelles, Francisco and Schou, Mads Fristrup and Loeschcke, Volker",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.005,"Heat tolerance increases at higher acclimation temperatures in D. melanogaster, but not in D. subobscura. The two species represent separate lineages of the subgenus Sophophora of Drosophila with contrasting tropical African and temperate Palearctic evolutionary histories. D. melanogaster has five copies of the inducible hsp70 gene distributed in two clusters, named A (with two copies) and B (three copies), while D. subobscura has only two copies arranged similarly to cluster A of D. melanogaster. The hsp70s of the two species also differ in their cis-regulatory regions, with D. melanogaster exhibiting features of a faster and more productive promoter. We predicted that the interspecific variation in acclimation capacity of heat tolerance is explained by evolved variation in expression of the major group of heat shock proteins. To test this prediction, we compared basal levels of gene expression at different developmental temperatures within each of the two species. Furthermore, we explored the heat hardening dynamics by measuring the induction of gene expression during a ramping assay. The prediction of a stronger heat shock protein response in D. melanogaster as compared to D. subobscura was confirmed for both long-term acclimation and short-term hardening. For D. melanogaster the upregulation with temperature ramping ranged from less than two fold (hsp26) to 2500 fold (hsp70A) increase. In all cases induction in D. melanogaster exceeded that of D. subobscura homologs. These differences correlate with structural differences in the regulatory regions of hsp70, and might explain differences in acclimation capacity among species. Finally, in D. melanogaster we found an indication of an inverse relationship between basal and induced levels of hsp70A and hsp83 expression, suggesting a divergent role for thermal adaptation of these genes at benign and stressful temperatures, respectively.",2019,84,NA,200-207

Developing larvae are sensitive to changes of temperature in the nest. Temperatures lower than generally assumed as optimal have been shown to cause a number of negative developmental and behavioural changes in honey bees. We have reared both worker and drone larvae during the capped brood stage in cold (32 degrees C) and in warm temperatures (35 degrees C). Next, we measured their body mass at emergence and the longevity of individuals either caged in incubator (workers) or placed in maintaining colonies (drones). For drones, the reproductive caste, we also compared the mass and ratio of body parts (head, thorax, and abdomen) to body mass. As expected, both castes were heavier when reared in cold, but contrary to our expectations, both castes survived longer after emergence than bees reared in warm. Drones reared in cold were characterized by proportionally larger abdomens, in comparison to drones reared in warm.",2018,78,NA,219-226
Colder is better: The differential effects of thermal acclimation on life history parameters in a parasitoid fly,"Zamorano, Jorge and Bozinovic, Francisco and Veloso, Claudio",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.03.011,"In this article, we assessed the effect of the rearing temperature on life history traits of the poorly known fly Phasmovora phasmophagae (Diptera: Tachinidae), a parasitoid of Agathemera crassa (Phasmatodea: Agathemeridae) in order to: i) test the effect of ambient temperature on life history traits and ii) assess the potential trade-off between reproduction and survival. Parasitoids were obtained from a population of hosts located in the Andes range of central Chile. Upon emergence from the host parasitoids were randomly allocated to three thermal treatments (15 degrees C, 22.5 degrees C and 30 degrees C) and several life history traits were measured. We recorded higher survival at 15 degrees C and 22.5 degrees C and a lower survival at 30 degrees C. We found differences for both body mass and head width among thermal treatments. In females, body mass was higher at 15 degrees C than at 30 degrees C. An effect of breeding temperature and sex was observed only for developmental time. In addition, males reared at different temperatures during the pupal stage and held as adults at 22.5 degrees C, exhibited no differences in longevity between treatments. A significant effect of temperature on the mass of ovaries and lipid was recorded in females. These patterns suggest a trade-off between reproduction and survival. Overall, data seem to support the ``colder is better{''} hypothesis, because Andean parasitoid P. phasmophagae inhabiting and experimentally reared in colder environments have a higher performance in all environments.",2017,68,A,1-4
The effect of different ambient temperatures on river lamprey (<i>Lampetrafluviatilis</i>) egg and sperm production under controlled conditions,"Cejko, Beata Irena and Judycka, Sylwia and Kujawa, Roman",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.09.011,"Reproductive performance (ovulation/spermation rate and relative fecundity of females) of adult river lamprey (Lampetrafluviatilis) was compared among adults held under three different controlled thermal regimes (7, 10 and 14 degrees C). The quantity of semen (volume of semen, sperm concentration, total sperm production and total number of sperm) and the weight of the eggs as well as the semen quality (sperm motility, seminal plasma osmolality and pH, sperm pH and total protein content) were determined. Housing temperature had no apparent effect on quality or quantity of eggs produced, but did influence time of ovulation. On the other hand, temperature had a significant effect on the quantity and quality of sperm produced; 70\% of males held at 10 degrees C and 14 degrees C did not spermiate. The best ambient temperature for river lamprey adults held under controlled conditions was 7 degrees C. All males kept in this temperature yielded mature semen with the highest sperm motility parameters. It was also found that among the six tested solutions, the most suitable artificial medium for river lamprey sperm activation was 20 mM Tris buffer containing 40 mM NaHCO3 at pH 8.5 and 100 mOsm kg(-1).",2016,62,A,70-75
Differential metabolism of brown adipose tissue in newborn rabbits in relation to position in the litter huddle,"Garcia-Torres, Esmeralda and Hudson, Robyn and Castelan, Francisco and Martinez-Gomez, Margarita and Bautista, Amando",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2015.03.003,"Competition for resources can contribute importantly to the early development of individual differences in behavioral and physiological phenotypes. In newborn rabbits, littermates compete for thermally favorable positions within the litter huddle. As brown adipose tissue (BAT) is the principal site of thermogenesis in such altricial young, we investigated differences in rabbit pups' growth and morphological differences in BAT associated with position within the huddle. We formed three treatment groups (7 litters/group): GI-birth (pups killed at birth); GII-chronic thermal challenge (pups killed after exposure to a moderately cold environmental during postnatal days 1-3); GIII acute thermal challenge (as for GII but pups killed after an additional 30 min exposure to a very cold environment on postnatal day 3). Interscapular BAT was removed at death for histological analysis, and triglyceride concentrations measured in serum. Pups occupying central positions in the huddle had higher skin temperatures, obtained more milk, and were more efficient at converting this into body mass, than pups occupying peripheral positions. There was no significant difference in BAT morphology or triglyceride concentrations between pups at birth, nor between central and peripheral pups chronically exposed to moderate cold until postnatal day 3. However, during acute cold exposure at this age, peripheral pups were less able to maintain their body temperature, they depleted BAT fat reserves almost completely, and they had lower serum concentrations of triglycerides than central pups. These findings confirm the contribution of early sibling relations to individual differences in growth and metabolic processes associated with thermoregulation in newborn rabbits.

Metabolic thermogenesis and evaporative water loss in the Hwamei <i>Garrulax canorus</i>,"Xia, Su-Su and Yu, An-Wei and Zhao, Li-Dan and Zhang, Hui-Ying and Zheng, Wei-Hong and Liu, Jin-Song",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2013.10.003,"Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is thought to be a major hub in the network of physiological mechanisms connecting life history traits. Evaporative water loss (EWL) is a physiological indicator that is widely used to measure water relations in inter- or intraspecific studies of birds in different environments. In this study, we examined the physiological responses of summer-acclimatized Hwamei Garrulax canorus to temperature by measuring their body temperature (T-b), metabolic rate (MR) and EWL at ambient temperatures (T-a) between 5 and 40 degrees C. Overall, we found that mean body temperature was 42.4 degrees C and average minimum thermal conductance (C) was 0.15 ml O-2 g(-1) h(-1) degrees C-1 measured between 5 and 20 degrees C. The thermal neutral zone (TNZ) was 31.8-35.3 degrees C and BMR was 181.83 ml O-2 h(-1). Below the lower critical temperature, MR increased linearly with decreasing Ta according to the relationship: MR (ml O-2 h(-1)) = 266.59-2.66 T-a. At T(a)s above the upper critical temperature, MR increased with Ta according to the relationship: MR (ml O-2 h(-1))= 271.26+12.85 T-a. EWL increased with T-a according to the relationship: EWL (mg H2O h(-1))= 19.16+12.64 T-a and exceeded metabolic water production at T-a > 14.0 degrees C. The high T-b and thermal conductance, low BMR, narrow TNZ, and high evaporative water production/metabolic water production (EWP/MWP) ratio in the Hwamei are consistent with the idea that this species is adapted to warm, mesic climates, where metabolic thermogenesis and water conservation are not strong selective pressures.

Effect of drinking earthen pot water on physiological response and behavior of sheep under heat stress,"De, Kalyan and Kumar, Davendra and Sharma, Shivendra and Kumawat, Pankaj and Mohapatra, Arpita and Sahoo, Artabandhu",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102476,"Heat stress is a major limiting factor for animal welfare and sheep production. Traditionally in India, the villagers used to keep their drinking water in the earthen pot to make it cold during summer. The cold drinking water (24-28 degrees C) during summer gives a feeling of relief from the heat. Therefore, the present study was carried out to assess the effect of drinking earthen pot water on physiological response and behavior of sheep under heat stress for one month. For this purpose, eighteen Avishaan rams were selected from the experimental animal flock and they were equally divided into three groups; viz., control (CON), heat stress (HS) and heat stress with earthen pot water (HSC). The animals of HS and HSC were exposed to higher ambient temperatures to induce heat stress inside the psychometric chamber. The animals of CON and HS were provided with ad-libitum water of their ambient temperature whereas; HSC groups were provided with ad-libitum cold water (24-28 degrees C) earthen pot water. All the animals were offered with 400 gm concentrate mixture and ad-libitum Cenchrus hay. The bodyweight of HS rams was significantly reduced (P < 0.05) at the end of the experimental period as compared to their initial body weight. The total roughage and dry matter intake was significantly higher (P < 0.01) in HSC rams as compared to HS rams. The plasma thyroxine concentration was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in HSC as compared with HS group. The rumination time significantly reduced (P < 0.05) in HSC group. However, The blood biochemical did not differ among the groups. Therefore, it may be concluded that Avishaan rams have the ability to adapt to heat stress. Nevertheless, the availability of earthen pot cold drinking water under heat stress reduced their body weight loss, improves their metabolic activity and ultimately improves their welfare.",2020,87,NA,NA
Heat induced differential pattern of DNA fragmentation in male germ cells of rats,"Kaushik, Kuldeep and Kaushal, Naveen and Mittal, Pawan Kumar and Kalla, Natwar Raj",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.021,"Spermatogenesis being a highly dynamic processes is highly vulnerable to various stresses including heat stress. Though, the relationship between physiological temperature and male germ cells is certainly immense, the magnitude of spermatozoal damage after exposure to heat is evidently degree and dose dependent. Further, there are contradictory reports related to germ cells apoptosis in relation to temperatures. Thus, currently the dynamics of temperature and time dependence on germ cell apoptosis were studied by modulating the heat treatment strategies. It was observed that the rate of apoptosis increased initially then decreased with time. The DNA fragmentation in the 10,000 x g supernatant of testis homogenate of rats that received heat treatment for 15-min, 30-min as well as 45-min treatment with 15-min intermittent period was found to be almost equal. In various heat treated animals, the apoptosis was found to be maximum after day-1 of treatments, which then followed a decreased pattern. These results indicate that there may be an initial induction of apoptosis in the germ cells, which later primed or programmed the other germ cells to activate protective mechanisms against heat induced DNA damage and thus protecting germ cell population to undergo apoptosis at later durations.",2019,84,NA,351-356

Thermal tolerance varies with age and sex for the nonnative Italian Wall Lizard (<i>Podarcis siculus</i>) in Southern California,"Liwanag, Heather E. M. and Haro, Daniel and Callejas, Breanna and Labib, Gloria and Pauly, Gregory B.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.10.010,"Temperature has a substantial effect on both the physiology and behavior of ectothermic animals such as lizards. Physiology and behavior can also be influenced by ontogenetic and sex differences, but these effects are largely understudied in lizards. We examined ontogenetic and sex-based differences in thermal tolerances, preferred temperature, and temperature-dependent evaporative water loss rates in Italian Wall Lizards, Podarcis siculus, collected from an introduced population near Los Angeles, California, USA that were acclimated to laboratory conditions. Podarcis siculus has been introduced to multiple localities in the USA and the Mediterranean region and has demonstrated remarkable ability to adapt to novel climatic conditions. In the California population, adults of both sexes had a higher critical thermal maximum (CTmax) than juveniles, and adult females had a lower critical thermal minimum (CTmin) than juveniles and adult males. Thus, adult females had a significantly wider thermal breadth (CTmax - CTmin) compared to adult males and juveniles. Mass-specific evaporative water loss was higher in juveniles compared to adult males at intermediate temperatures. There was no significant difference among groups for preferred temperature. This implies that thermal tolerance, a physiological characteristic, varies with age and sex for this population, whereas thermal preference, a behavioral characteristic, does not. Interestingly, CTmin in for all age and sex classes was above temperatures likely experienced by some nonnative populations in winter, suggesting individuals need to find urban thermal retreats. These results add to the growing literature demonstrating that thermal tolerances and breadths can vary between sexes and across age classes in squamate species.",2018,78,NA,263-269
Impact of water temperature on the growth and fatty acid profiles of juvenile sea cucumber <i>Apostichopus japonicus</i> (Selenka),"Yu, Haibo and Zhang, Cheng and Gao, Qinfeng and Dong, Shuanglin and Ye, Zhi and Tian, Xiangli",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.07.011,"The present study determined the changes in the fatty acid (FA) profiles of juvenile sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus in response to the varied water temperature. Sea cucumbers with similar size (4.02 +/- 0.11 g) were cultured for 8 weeks at 14 degrees C, 18 degrees C, 22 degrees C and 26 degrees C, respectively. At the end of the experiment, the specific growth rate (SGR) and the profiles of FAs in neutral lipids and phospholipids of the juvenile sea cucumbers cultured at different temperatures were determined. The SGRs of the sea cucumbers cultured at 26 degrees C significantly decreased 46.3\% compared to thos cultured at 18 degrees C. Regression analysis showed that the SGR-temperature (T) relationship can be expressed as SGR=-0.0073 T-2+0.255 T - 1.0231 (R-2=0.9936) and the highest SGR was predicted at 17.5 degrees C. For the neutral lipids, the sum of saturated FAs (SFAs), monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs) or polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) of the sea cucumbers that were cultured at the water temperature from 18 degrees C-26 degrees C did not change significantly, indicating the insensitivity of FA profiles for the neutral lipids of sea cucumbers in response to increasing water temperature. For phospholipids, the sum of PUFAs in the sea cucumbers dramatically decreased with the gradually increased water temperature. The sum of SFAs and MUFAs of sea cucumbers, however, increased with the gradually elevated water temperature. In particular, the contents of highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs), including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the phospholipids of the sea cucumbers decreased 37.2\% and 26.1\%, respectively, when the water temperature increased from 14 degrees C to 26 degrees C. In summary, the sea cucumbers A. japonicus can regulate the FA compositions, especially the contents of EPA and DHA, in the phospholipids so as to adapt to varied water temperature.

Effect of photoperiod and temperature on indicators of immunity and wellbeing of endangered golden mahseer (<i>Tor putitora</i>) broodstock,"Akhtar, M. S. and Rajesh, M. and Kamalam, B. S. and Ciji, A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102694,"Recently, we reported the possibility of successfully inducing captive maturation and spawning in golden mahseer through photothermal manipulation. Subsequently, we felt that it was imperative to understand the impact of these environmental manipulations on immunity, stress response, antioxidant potential, and general well-being of adult mahseer to develop a healthy broodstock. For this purpose, two experiments were carried out with changes in photoperiod (experiment I) and temperature (experiment II). In experiment I, random groups of adult female and male Tor putitora were subjected to three photoperiods (8L:16D, 12L:12D and 16L:8D) for 100 days. Decreasing levels of plasma melatonin with increasing photoperiod confirmed the physiological significance of different light-dark conditions in mahseer brooders. In terms of stress, plasma cortisol levels showed a linear increase with decreasing light duration in both males and females. Similarly, the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances was also significantly higher in males kept at 8L:16D. Plasma concentration of total immunoglobulins was found reduced in female brooders at 8L:16D, but this was not evident in males. In females, total antioxidants were found significantly elevated at 12L:12D. On the contrary, superoxide dismutase activity was lower at 12L:12D in females. The photoperiod has substantially influenced the plasma total protein and albumin levels in males. In experiment II, random groups of adult T. putitora were reared at ambient (21.2 +/- 1.4 degrees C) or elevated temperature (23.7 +/- 1.3 degrees C) groups for 121 days. The higher temperature was found to significantly decrease lysozyme, myeloperoxidase, and anti-protease activities in female mahseer brooders. However, total immunoglobulin levels were reduced significantly at elevated temperature both in males and females. No other temperature-related significant changes were observed in antioxidant potential, anti-oxidative enzymes or well-being related indices.",2020,93,NA,NA
The effect of temperature on candidate gene expression in the brain of honey bee <i>Apis mellifera</i> (Hymenoptera: Apidae) workers exposed to neonicotinoid imidacloprid,"Manzi, Catalina and Vergara-Amado, Jonathan and Franco, Lida Marcela and Silva, Andrea X.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102696,"Neonicotinoid insecticides are potent agonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and are a major factor in the decline of pollinators worldwide. Several studies show that low doses of this neurotoxin influence honey bee physiology, however, little is known about how insecticides interact with other environmental variables. We studied the effects of two neonicotinoid Imidacloprid doses (IMD, 0, 2.5, and 10 ppb), and three temperatures (20, 28, and 36 degrees C) on gene expression in the brains of worker honey bees (Apis mellifera). Using qRT-PCR we quantified the expression of eight key genes related to the nervous system, stress response, and motor and olfactory capacities. Gene expression tended to increase with the low IMD dose, which was further intensified in individuals maintained in the cold treatment (20 degrees C). At 20 degrees C the octopamine receptor gene (oa1) was underexpressed in bees that were not exposed to IMD, but overexpressed in individuals exposed to 2.5 ppb IMD. Also, heat shock proteins (hsp70 and hsp90) increased their expression at high temperatures (36 degrees C), but not with IMD doses. These results suggest that despite the low insecticide concentrations used in this study (a field-realistic dose), changes in gene expression associated with honey bee physiological responses could be induced. This study contributes to the understanding of how neonicotinoid residual doses may alter honey bee physiology.",2020,93,NA,NA
Responses of intestinal morphology and function in offspring to heat stress in primiparous sows during late gestation,"Guo, Huiduo and He, Jianwen and Yang, Xiaojing and Zheng, Weijiang and Yao, Wen",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102539,"Late gestation is a key period for intestinal development. Maternal heat exposure may induce intestinal dysfunction of offspring. To investigate the responses of intestinal morphology and function of offspring to the maternal heat stress (HS), twelve first-parity Landrace x Large White sows were assigned to thermoneutral (TN) (18-22 degrees C; n = 6) or HS (28-32 degrees C; n = 6) treatment groups at 85 d of gestation until natural farrowing. Twenty-four newborn piglets (two piglets at medium body weight from each litter) were randomly selected and divided into in utero thermoneutral (IUTN, n = 12) and heat-stressed (IUHS, n = 12) groups according to the sow's treatment. Blood and intestinal samples were harvested to evaluate stress hormone levels, intestinal morphology, integrity and barrier function in the newborn piglets. Our results showed that maternal HS piglets exhibited increased serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) concentration compared with that observed in the IUTN group. IUHS piglets showed lower lactase activities in the jejunum and ileum, whereas no significant differences were found between the two groups in the length of intestine, villus length or crypt depth. Serum diamine oxidase (DAO) activity was increased in IUHS piglets. IUHS piglets also exhibited decreased ZO-1, ZO-2 and MUC2 mRNA expression in the jejunum, while the protein levels were not affected. Additionally, IUHS piglets had a lower apoptotic percentage and FAS mRNA expression in the jejunum than those in the IUTN group. Taken together, these results demonstrate that high ambient temperature during late gestation of primiparous sows causes stress response in neonatal piglets, compromising intestinal permeability and mucosal barrier function, which may be partly mediated by inducing intestinal apoptosis.",2020,89,NA,NA

PocaHSP40 was widely expressed in the gill, digestive gland, kidney, and foot muscle of P. canaliculata. Challenged by different temperatures, the expression of PocaHSP40 was up-regulated under low temperatures but not high temperatures, which was contrary to the expression change of PocaHSP70 under low and high temperatures.

Effect of chronic low body temperature on feeding and gut passage in a plethodontid salamander,"Marvin, Glenn A. and Bryan, Richard and Hardwick, James",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.09.003,"Although feeding in some plethodontid salamander species, such as Dusky Salamanders (Desmognathus, family Plethodontidae), occurs at short-term (acute) low temperature below 5 degrees C, it is unknown whether feeding, digestion, and gut passage continue to occur during periods of long-term (chronic) low temperature. We performed a controlled laboratory experiment to examine the effect of several chronic low environmental temperatures on both feeding and gut passage in semiaquatic Spotted Dusky Salamanders (D. conanti). We quantified salamander feeding and defecation for different experimental groups maintained for many weeks at a constant temperature of 4, 7, 10, or 13 degrees C. Although feeding frequency, number of prey items consumed per feeding, and defecation frequency were significantly less for individuals at 4 degrees C than for individuals at 10 or 13 degrees C, salamanders continued to feed, defecate, and maintain body mass for 12 weeks at 4 degrees C. The ratio of the number of fecal pellets produced to the number of prey items consumed each week by individuals did not significantly decrease at 4 degrees C, which indicates gut passage was sustained at this temperature. Because both time between feeding and time between defecation were similarly affected by prolonged low temperature, the significant decrease in feeding frequency at 4 degrees C may depend, in part, on a decrease in digestive function and an extended time for gut passage at low temperature. We conclude that most individuals of D. conanti can feed, digest, and maintain body mass for several months at constant low temperature down to 4 degrees C. Our results support a growing body of data that indicate some plethodontid salamanders may acquire energy at environmental temperatures only a few degrees above freezing.",2017,69,NA,319-324
"Hypothermal effects on survival, energy homeostasis and expression of energy-related genes of swimming crabs <i>Portunus trituberculatus</i> during air exposure","Lu, Yunliang and Zhang, Dan and Wang, Fang and Dong, Shuanglin",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.06.007,"Previously, dry or semi-dry approach under the hypothermal condition is proved to be an alternative method in transport of live swimming crabs Portunus trituberculatus. However, we wondered whether this method can improve crab survival when temperature is kept as cool as possible. In this study, we hypothesized that there is a thermal threshold below which dry or semi-dry approach (air exposure) could cause crab physiological disruption and therefore aggravate their mortality. To test the above hypothesis, crabs (23 degrees C) were exposed to air at temperatures ranging from 4 to 16 degrees C. Results showed that crabs had a worse survival and vigor at temperatures below 12 degrees C. Then we tested crab energy metabolism to explore the possible reason. It was shown that total adenine nucleotide and adenylate energy charge in gills were remarkably reduced by air exposure of below 12 degrees C. This increased the need for crabs to re-balance energy metabolism, which was indicated by the upregulation of AMPK alpha and HIP-1 alpha. Meanwhile, there was a significant increase of the expression of Na+/K+-ATPase, V-type ATPase and HSP90 at temperatures below 12 degrees C, while all treatments shared a similar level of hemocyanin, urate and lactate in hemolymph and expression of cytochrome c oxidase and NADH-ubiquinone reductase in gills. These results implied that dry or semi-dry approach below 12 degrees C could exert detrimental effects on P. trituberculatus, and perturbation of energy homeostasis, which is more related with changes of energy demanding physiological pathways, is a possible reason of crab death and poor vigor.

Informed conservation management of presumably declining populations requires the identification of the most sensitive life stage. In temperate-zone anurans there is growing evidence that juveniles hibernating for the first time suffer from substantial winter losses. In two syntopic toads (Epidalea calamita, Bufotes viridis) we monitored survival of such juveniles during four consecutive winters in the natural habitat and in four temperature treatments (3 degrees, 5 degrees C, 10/15 degrees C or 20 degrees C, natural light-dark cycle) in temperature-controlled chambers during winter. Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that (1) winter mortality of juvenile toads which hibernate for the first time in their life is an important component of population dynamics, and that (2) mortality rates differed between the two species. Parameters quantified were size-dependent winter mortality and body condition of pre- and post-hibernating juveniles. Field data provided evidence for the important role of winter mortality of first-hibernators in population dynamics. Choice of hibernacula differed in E. calamita between small and medium-sized individuals and also between the two species suggesting distinct mortality risks. The inability of small E. calamita to reach frost-proof hibernacula by burrowing, and the exposure of small B. viridis to predators are the most probable causes of size-assortative winter mortality. In conclusion, E. calamita juveniles may benefit from rising average winter temperatures in the future by decreased risk of freezing to death, whereas predator-caused winter mortality of B. viridis juveniles will also depend on the effects of climate warming on predator phenology.

Effects of temperature and modified atmospheres on diapausing 5th instar codling moth metabolism,"Neven, Lisa G. and Lehrman, Nathan J. and Hansen, Lee D.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2014.02.017,"The oxygen and Capacity limitation of thermal tolerance (OCLTT) has been established in aquatic insect larvae, but OCLTT has not been shown to generally apply to terrestrial insects. Previous research indicates that heat treatments in Combination with high Concentrations of Carbon dioxide and low Concentrations of oxygen may be effective for Controlling diapausing Codling moth, a quarantine pest in walnuts, but treatment requires long times and the killing mechanism is unknown. In this study, the effects of temperature and modified atmospheres on metabolism in diapausing 5th instar Codling moth (Cydia pomonella) was investigated with multi-channel differential scanning Calorimeters, one equipped with an oxygen sensor. O-2 Consumption and metabolic heat rates in air were measured simultaneously at isothermal temperatures from 5 to 50 degrees C at 5 degrees C intervals. Both rates increased with increasing temperatures from 5 to 40 degrees C. The ratio of metabolic heat rate to O-2 Consumption rate at temperatures <= 40 degrees C shows that a portion of the metabolic heat is from normal anabolic reactions of metabolism. At 45 and 50 degrees C in air, O-2 Consumption and metabolic heat rates dropped to near zero. These results indicate that treatment of walnuts in air at >45 degrees C for a short period of time (minutes) is effective in killing diapausing 5th instar Codling moth larvae.degrees Continuous heating scans at 0.4 degrees C/min were used to measure metabolic heat rates from 10 to 50 degrees C with air and modified atmospheres with lowered oxygen and high degrees Carbon dioxide. A rapid increase was observed in heat rates above 40 degrees C in scans with 02 >= 11\%. Taken together with the isothermal results showing no metabolic heat production or oxygen uptake at 45 and 50 degrees C, these results demonstrate that thermal damage to Cell membranes and loss of Control of oxidation reactions is the lethal mechanism at high temperature when O-2 >= 11\%. The data from scans with 02 <= 2\% and high CO2 show the effects of oxygen limitation as postulated by the OCLTT. However,CO2 anesthesia appears to protect larvae from oxygen limitation at high temperature. These results show that treatment of walnuts in air at temperatures >45 degrees C will rapidly kill diapausing 5th instar Codling moths. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",2014,42,NA,9-14
Response of juvenile diamond-backed terrapins (<i>Malaclemys terrapin</i>) to an aquatic thermal gradient,"Tamplin, Jeffrey W. and Moran, Victoria F. and Riesberg, Emily J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2013.06.005,"In many ectotherms, selection of environmental thermal niches may positively affect growth, nutrient assimilation rates, immune system function, and ultimately survival. Temperature preference in some turtle species may be influenced by environmental conditions, including acclimation temperature. We tested for effects of acclimation temperature (22 degrees C, 27 degrees C) on the selected temperature and movement patterns of 14 juvenile Malaclemys terrapin (Reptilia: Emydidae) in an aquatic thermal gradient of 14-34 degrees C and in single-temperature (22 degrees C, 27 degrees C) control tests. Among 8-10 month old terrapins, acclimation temperature influenced activity and movement patterns but did not affect temperature selection. In thermal gradient and single-temperature control tests, turtles acclimated to 27 degrees C used more tank chambers and relocated between chambers significantly more frequently than individuals acclimated to 22 C. However, acclimation temperature did not affect temperature selection: both 22- and 27 degrees C-acclimated turtles selected the warmest temperature (34 degrees C), and avoided the other temperatures available, during thermal gradient tests. These results suggest that young M. terrapin are capable of detecting small temperature increments and prefer warm temperatures that may positively influence growth and metabolism.

S. S. and Nandini, S.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102752,"Diurnal temperature fluctuations affect ectothermic species more than endothermic taxa. We tested the effect of three fixed temperatures (20, 25 and 30 degrees C) and a 24 h variable (20-30 degrees C) on the population growth and fatty acid profiles of the common rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus. Depending on the temperature treatment, the peak population abundances of B. calyciflorus varied from 65 to 80 ind./ml, the lowest being on variable temperature range. The rate of population increase varied from 0.31 to 0.52 per day, highest being at 30 degrees C. There was a curvilinear relationship between the population density and the egg ratio (number of eggs/female) in all the tested temperature regimes. The egg ratio was higher (>0.6) for treatments involving fixed temperatures, but for variable temperature regime, the egg ratios were lower (<0.5). Temperature also induced changes in the fatty acid content of B. calyciflorus. While the total saturated fatty acids increased, both mono-unsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids decreased with increasing temperature regime. These results have been interpreted in relation to the role of temperature (both intensity and mode of exposure) on the population growth characteristics of rotifers.",2020,94,NA,NA
"Effects of activation of skin ion channels TRPM8, TRPV1, and TRPA1 on the immune response. Comparison with effects of cold and heat exposure","Kozyreva, V, T. and Khramova, G. M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102729,"The effects of pharmacological stimulation of skin ion channels TRPA1, TRPM8, TRPV1 on the immune response are presented. These effects are compared with the effects of different types of temperature exposures - skin cooling, deep cooling, and deep heating. This analysis allows us to clear the differences in the influence on the immune response of thermosensitive ion channels localized in the skin; (2) whether the changes in the immune response under temperature exposures are due to these thermosensitive ion channels. Experiments were performed on Wistar rats. For stimulation of TRPM8 ion channel, an application to the skin of 1\% menthol was used, for TRPA1 - 0.04\% allylisotiocianate, and for TRPV1 - capsaicin in a concentration of 0.001.The antigen binding in the spleen was two-times stimulated by activation of the cold-sensitive ion channel TRPM8 and much weaker by activation of warm-sensitive TRPV1 (by 15\%), and another cold-sensitive ion channel TRPA1 (by 40\%). Only the stimulation of TRPA1 significantly (by 140\%) increased antibody formation in the spleen, while TRPM8 had practically no effect on this process, and activation of TRPV1 significantly (by 60\%) inhibited antibody formation. Stimulation of the TRPM8 ion channel significantly (by 60\%) reduced the level of IgG in the blood, which is believed to control of infectious diseases.The obtained results show that pharmacological activation of the skin TRPA1, TRPM8, TRPV1 ion channels can differently affect the immune system. At the epicenter of changes there were the antigen binding and antibody formation in the spleen, as well as the level of IgG in the blood. Exactly stimulation of the TRPM8 ion channel determines the changes in the immune response when only the skin is cooling, while at deep body heating, the changes in the immune response are mostly determined by the activation of the skin TRPV1 ion channel.",2020,93,NA,NA
High temperature acclimation alters the emersion behavior in the crab Neohelice granulata,"Halal, Lamia Marques and Ayres, Bruna Soares and Lima, Tabata Martins and Maciel, Fabio Everton and Maia Nery, Luiz Eduardo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102617,"An increase in environmental temperature can deleteriously affect organisms. This study investigated whether the semiterrestrial estuarine crab Neohelice granulata uses emersion behavior as a resource to avoid thermal stress and survive higher aquatic temperatures. We also examined whether this behavior is modulated by exposure to high temperature; whether, during the period of emersion, the animal loses heat from the carapace to the medium; and whether this behavior is altered by the temperature at which the animal has been acclimated. The lethal temperature for 50\% of the population (LT50) was determined through 96-h mortality curves in animals acclimated at 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C. The behavioral profile of N. granulata during thermal stress was based on monitoring crab movement in aerial, intermediary, and aquatic zones. Acclimation at a higher temperature and the possibility of emersion increased the thermotolerance of the crabs and the synergistic effect of acclimation temperature. The possibility of leaving the hot water further increased the resistance of these animals to thermal stress. We observed that when the crab was subjected to thermal stress conditions, it spent more time in the aerial environment, unlike under control conditions. Under the experimental conditions, it made small incursions into the aquatic environment and stayed in the aerial environment for a longer time in order to cool its body temperature. The animals acclimated at 20 degrees C and placed into water at 35 degrees C remained in the aerial zone. The animals acclimated and maintained at 30 degrees C (control) that were placed in water at 35 degrees C with the possibility of emerging into hot air transited more frequently between the aquatic and aerial zones than did the animals that were put in water at 35 degrees C with the possibility of emerging into a cooler air environment. We conclude that emergence behavior allows N. granulata to survive high temperatures and that this behavior is influenced by acclimation temperature.",2020,91,NA,NA
Dietary supplementation of brown seaweed (<i>Sargassum latifolium</i>) alleviates the environmental heat stress-induced toxicity in male Barki sheep (<i>Ovis aries</i>),"Ellamie, Ashgan M. and Fouda, Wafaa A. and Ibrahim, Wael M. and Ramadan, Gamal",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102561,"Heat stress (HS) is the most potent environmental stressors for livestock in tropical and subtropical regions. HS induced splanchnic tissue hypoxia and intestinal oxidative damage, leading to endotoxemia and systemic inflammation.

The present study showed that the diet containing Sargassum latifolium (especially 4\%) modulated significantly (P < 0.05-0.001) almost all changes shown in the HS-exposed sheep including the increase in the thermo-respiratory responses (skin and rectal temperatures, and respiration rate) and the resulted dyslipidemia, anemia, and systemic inflammation (blood leukocytosis, the elevation in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and the increase in serum proinflammatory cytokines and heat shock protein-70 concentrations). In addition, Sargassum latifolium improved significantly (P < 0.05-0.001) the body-weight gain, kidney functions (especially at the high dose), and blood antioxidant defense system (total antioxidant capacity, and the activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase) in the HS-exposed sheep, as well as protected the animals from oxidative tissue damage and the risk of atherosclerosis. In conclusion, feeding sheep with the diet containing 4\% of Sargassum latifolium was safe and suitable for animal nutrition, as well as efficiently alleviated the harmful effects of the environmental HS in Barki sheep through improving the animal antioxidant defense system, and regulating the thermo-respiratory and inflammatory responses.",2020,89,NA,NA
Analysis of global and gene-specific acetylation of histones in the liver of American bullfrog (<i>Rana catesbeiana</i>) tadpoles acclimated to low temperature,"Ishihara, Akinori and Yamauchi, Kiyoshi",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.08.002,"Severe environmental stressors such as low temperatures can affect gene expression by changing epigenetic states. American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) can overwinter as tadpoles, which can be active even in winter. However, the molecular mechanisms of epigenetic controls by which the tadpoles acclimate to low temperature are still unclear. In this study, we aimed to clarify the molecular mechanisms of global and gene-specific epigenetic regulations of low-temperature acclimation. We found that the global acetylation was decreased in the liver of bullfrog tadpoles acclimated to low temperature. The amounts of transcripts for two historic acetyl-transferases were higher in the liver of tadpoles acclimated to low temperature than in those acclimated to warm temperature, while we observed no significant differences in the amounts of transcripts for histone deacetylases. We also found that the amounts of transcripts and acetylated histones on the specific temperature-responsive genes scd and cyp7a1 whose transcripts were increased and decreased, respectively, in response to low temperature were positively correlated. Cellular acetyl-CoA levels were higher in the liver of tadpoles acclimated to low temperature than in those acclimated to warm temperature. These results contradicted the states of histone acetylation, suggesting that bullfrog tadpoles have different epigenetic mechanisms to modify the histones when compared with those of other organisms such as reptiles and mammals, even though the relationship between the transcript amount and the states of histone acetylation on temperature-responsive genes was similar to that of mammals.",2019,84,NA,488-495
Thermal dependence of feeding performance and resting metabolic expenditure in different altitudinal populations of toad-headed lizards,"Hu, Ying-Chao and Lu, Hong-Liang and Cheng, Kun-Ming and Luo, Lai-Gao and Zeng, Zhi-Gao",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.01.001,"Inter-population variations in growth rate can result from independent or interactive effects of genetic and environmental factors, and be induced by some physiological differences as well. Toad-headed lizards (Phrynocephalus vlangalil) from a higher-elevation population were shown to have a higher growth rate than those from a lower-elevation population. The physiological basis of growth rate variation in this species is not well understood. Here, we investigated the feeding performance and resting metabolic rate (RMR) of lower- and higher-elevation individuals at different test ambient temperatures to evaluate the role of differences in energy intake, assimilation efficiency and metabolic expenditure on growth rate variations. Within the range of 25 - 35 degrees C, lizard RMR increased with increasing test ambient temperature, but food intake, apparent digestive coefficient (ADC, food energy minus faecal energy divided by food energy), and assimilation efficiency (AE, food energy minus faecal and urinary energy divided by food energy) were less thermally sensitive in both populations. Higher-elevation lizards tended to eat more food and have a lower RMR than lower-elevation ones, despite the lack of differences in ADC and AE. Our result showed that more energy intake and reduced maintenance cost may be associated with the higher growth rate of higher-elevation lizards. Accordingly, inter-population differences in energy acquisition and expenditure could act as potential sources for geographic variation in growth rate.",2019,80,NA,16-20
Life-stage related responses to combined effects of acclimation temperature and humidity on the thermal tolerance of <i>Chilo partellus</i> (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae),"Mutamiswa, Reyard and Machekano, Honest and Chidawanyika, Frank and Nyamukondiwa, Casper",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.12.002,"Adaptive thermal plasticity plays a key role in mitigating the effects of seasonal and diurnal thermal fluctuations among ectotherms at various life-stages. While the role of thermal history in conferring such plasticity is widely documented, its interaction with relative humidity (RH), another important driver of ectotherm survival and activity, is relatively underexplored. Yet the potential responses to these combinational stressors across ontogeny remain largely neglected. Against this background, we used a full-factorial design to test the combined acclimation effects of RH (45\%, 65\% and 85\%) and temperature (23, 28 and 33 degrees C) on various indices of thermal sensitivity of laboratory reared spotted stemborer, Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) following acclimation beginning at larval, pupal and adult life-stages. Traits measured included critical thermal limits (CTLs), supercooling points (SCPs), chill coma recovery time (CCRT) and heat knockdown time (HKDT). Larval acclimation at 23 degrees C; 85\% RH recorded the lowest critical thermal minima (CTmin) whereas adult acclimation at 28 degrees C; 45\% RH recorded the highest critical thermal maxima (CTmax. There were no significant differences (P > 0.05) in SCPs across all temperature x RH acclimations. Larval and pupal acclimations at 23 degrees C; 85\% RH and adult acclimation at 23 degrees C; 45\% RH significantly improved CCRT. Similarly, commencing acclimation at larval, pupal and adult stages at 28 degrees C; 85\% RH improved HKDT whereas larval and pupal acclimations at 33 degrees C; 45\% RH impaired it. Our results indicate that combinational interactions of temperature and RH have significant thermal fitness costs and benefits and are dependent on the life-stage acclimation timing. Results also imply that both the vulnerability and adaptive potential of C. partellus populations under rapid climate variability varies with ontogeny. This therefore calls for the consideration of the role of ontogeny and multi-factors in better understanding the impact of environmental stress on ectotherms.",2019,79,NA,85-94
Thermal biology of two sympatric gerbil species: The physiological basis of temporal partitioning,"Ding, Bo-Yang and Chi, Qing-Sheng and Liu, Wei and Shi, Yao-Long and Wang, De-Hua",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.03.025,"Sympatric species can coexist through ecological resource partitioning as for example for habitat, food or time. However, a detailed understanding of the basic thermal physiology, crucial for temporal partitioning, is currently lacking, especially for the desert rodents. Here, we compare the physiological performance with regard to thermal energetics and morphological traits of two sympatric gerbils from the Gobi desert of Inner Mongolia, China. The diurnally active Meriones unguiculatus and the nocturnally active M. meridianus. The diurnal M. unguiculatus had more brown adipose tissue (BAT) mass and capacity for non-shivering thermogenesis (NST), a higher resting metabolic rate (RMR) at low ambient temperatures (T-a) and a higher upper critical temperature of the thermal neutral zone (TNZ) than the nocturnal M. meridianus. The overall thermal conductance and lower critical temperatures of M. unguiculatus were also higher than that of M. meridianus, permitting the former to maintain a stable body temperature (T-b) when exposed to high T-a. Laboratory-bred M. meridianus also showed higher daily water intake. We found no differences in body mass, and total evaporative water loss (TEWL) between the two species captured from the natural environment. These results suggest that the diurnal M. unguiculatus have a higher tolerance of high T(a)s, whereas M. meridianus can save more energy at low T(a)s. Therefore, from the view point of energy conservation, our results suggest that the nocturnal ecophenotype in M. meridianus is constrained by a lower ability for heat resistance, but this is not the case for the diurnal M. unguiculatus.",2018,74,NA,241-248
Proteomic response of mouse pituitary gland under heat stress revealed active regulation of stress responsive proteins,"Memon, Shahar Bano and Lian, Li and Gadahi, Javaid Ali and Wang Genlin",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.08.010,"The mapping of tissue proteomes can identify the molecular regulators and effectors of their physiological activity. However, proteomic response of a mammalian tissue against heat stress (HS) particularly of the pituitary gland has not yet been resolved. The proteomic response of the mouse pituitary gland against HS at 40 degrees C was evaluated by iTRAQ, We found that, HS actively regulates stress-related proteins. Among 375 differentially expressed proteins, 26 up and 46 downregulated proteins were found as stress responsive proteins. Two proteins belonging to the HSP70 and one to HSP90 family were found upregulated. Meanwhile, the expression of HSP90 alpha (Cytosolic), HSP60, and HSP84b were observed to be downregulated. A neuroprotective enzyme Nmnat3 was observed to be significantly upregulated. Three proteins related to the intermediate filament (IF) proteins (lamins, vimentin and keratins) were also found to be upregulated. We reported, an association between the IF proteins and HSPs as a biological marker of HS. The expression of Apo A-IV was upregulated and might be one explanation for low food intake during HS. Our findings indicated that, differentially expressed proteins might be played important roles in combating HS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2016,61,NA,82-90

The expression of the investigated genes was identified in all the examined brain regions (hypothalamus, frontal cortex, hippocampus and midbrain). It was found rather high expression of the genes of warm sensitive ion channels was activated at temperatures above 30 degrees C, in contrast, the gene expression level of cold sensitive TRPM8 and TRPA1 proved to be much lower. The expression of the genes of thermosensitive TRP ion channels was, mostly, greater in the hypothalamus than in the other brain regions. Comparison of the gene expression of all TRP ion channels in every investigated brain structures showed that after long-term adaptation to cold the decrease in Trpv3 gene expression was observed only in the hypothalamus, i.e. adaptive change is hypothalamic specific. Obtained results may evidence that thermosensitive TRP ion channels can be involved in the mechanisms of thermal adaptation at the level of gene expression. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Oxygen-dependence of upper thermal limits in crustaceans from different thermal habitats,"Ern, Rasmus and Chung, Dillon and Frieder, Christina A. and Madsen, Niels and Speers-Roesch, Ben",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102732,"The critical thermal maximum (CTMAX) is the temperature at which animals exhibit loss of motor response because of a temperature-induced collapse of vital physiological systems. A central mechanism hypothesised to underlie the CTMAX of water-breathing ectotherms is insufficient tissue oxygen supply for vital maintenance functions because of a temperature-induced collapse of the cardiorespiratory system. The CTMAX of species conforming to this hypothesis should decrease with declining water oxygen tension (PO2) because they have oxygen-dependent upper thermal limits. However, recent studies have identified a number of fishes and crustaceans with oxygen-independent upper thermal limits, their CTMAX unchanged in progressive aquatic hypoxia. The previous studies, which were performed separately on cold-water, temperate and tropical species, suggest the oxygen-dependence of upper thermal limits and the acute thermal sensitivity of the cardiorespiratory system increases with decreasing habitat temperature. Here we directly test this hypothesis by assessing the oxygen-dependence of CTMAX in the polar Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), as well as the temperate Baltic prawn (Palaemon adspersus) and brown shrimp (Crangon crangon). We found that P. adspersus and C. crangon maintain CTMAX in progressive hypoxia down to 40 mmHg, and that only E. superba have oxygen-dependent upper thermal limits at normoxia. In E. superba, the observed decline in CTMAX with water PO2 is further supported by heart-rate measurements showing a plateauing, and subsequent decline and collapse of heart performance at CTMAX. Our results support the hypothesis that the oxygen-dependence of upper thermal limits in water-breathing ectotherms and the acute thermal sensitivity of their cardiorespiratory system increases with decreasing habitat temperature.",2020,93,NA,NA

To compensate for the effects of variation in temperature, ectotherms exhibit short or long-term physiological plasticity. An extensive body of literature exists towards understanding these effects and the solutions ectotherms have evolved. However, to what extent rearing temperature during early life stages impacts the behaviour expressed in adulthood is less clearly understood. In the present study, we aimed to examine the effects of developmental temperature on life-history traits and mating call features in a tropical field cricket, Acanthogryllus asiaticus. We raised A. asiaticus at two different developmental conditions: 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C. We found developmental time and adult lifespan of individuals reared at 30 degrees C to be shorter than those reared at 25 degrees C. Increased developmental temperature influenced various body size parameters differentially. Males raised at 30 degrees C were found to be larger and heavier than those raised at 25 degrees C, making A. asiaticus an exception to the temperature-size rule. We found a significant effect of change in immediate ambient temperature on different call features of both field-caught and lab-bred individuals. Developmental temperature also affected mating call features wherein individuals raised at higher temperature produced faster calls with a higher peak frequency compared to those raised at lower temperature. In addition, an interactive effect of both developmental and immediate temperature was found on mating call features.

The heat treatments were: initial brooding temperature of 35 degrees C for the first 2 days, and then decreased subsequently, gradually to 22 degrees C at 21 d of age (CT), initial temperature of 35 degrees C, sustained for the first 4 days and then decreased gradually (conventionally) (FD), initial temperature of 35 degrees C for the first 7 days (SD), the birds in CT, but the brooding temperature was raised to 35 degrees C again for another 3 days from day 7 (SD3), initial brooding temperature of 35 degrees C for the first 10 days (TD). Data were collected on daily feed intake and weekly body weights. Blood samples were collected from 8 birds per treatment weekly for the determination of plasma uric acid, triglycerides, triiodothyronine (T-3) and creatinine kinase. Data obtained were laid out in a Completely Randomized Design (CRD). Results showed that the final weights of the birds in FD were higher (P < 0.05) than those of the other treatments at the finisher phase. Feed intake of the birds in FD was higher than those of SD3 and TD. FCR of broiler thickens in CT, SD, SD3 and TD was higher than that of FD.

Wide amplitudes (+/- 10 degrees C and +/- 12 degrees C) inhibited larval development and adult performance, but increased the proportion of eggs laid early, while moderate amplitudes (+/- 4 degrees C, +/- 6 degrees C and +/- 8 degrees C) resulted in only minor effects. Larval development rate under wide amplitudes ( +/- 10 degrees C and +/- 12 degrees C) was faster than predicted by a degree-hour model. Overall, the intrinsic rate of increase of the population was lowered with increasing DTR, despite mean temperatures being the same. These findings highlight marked cross-stage effects of DTR when temperatures fluctuate substantially, likely linked to maximum temperature, and they emphasize the importance of considering DTR when assessing effects of climate warming.",2019,84,NA,8-15
Thermal regime effects on the resting metabolic rate of rattlesnakes depend on temperature range,"Fabricio-Neto, Ailton and Bueno Gavira, Rodrigo Samuel and Andrade, Denis Vieira",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.05.025,"While ectothermic organisms often experience considerable circadian variation in body temperature under natural conditions, the study of the effects of temperature on metabolic rates are traditionally based on subjecting animals to constant temperature regimes. Whether data resulting from constant-temperature experiments accurately predicts temperature effects under more natural fluctuating temperature regimes remains uncertain. To address such possibility, we measured the resting metabolic rates of the South American rattlesnakes (Crotalus durissus) under constant and circadian fluctuating thermal regimes in a range of temperatures. Metabolic rates measured at constant 20 degrees C and 25 degrees C did not differ from the rates measured at fluctuating regimes with corresponding mean temperatures. However, the difference between thermal regimes increased with temperature, with the metabolic rate measured at constant 30 degrees C being greater than that measured at the fluctuating thermal regime with corresponding mean temperature. Therefore, our results indicate that thermal regime effects on rattlesnakes' metabolism is dependent on temperature range. Broadly, our results highlight the importance of considering multi-factorial attributes of temperature variation in the exam of its effects over functional traits.

Environmental factors such as food scarcity and low temperatures have been shown to facilitate the use of this temporal reduction in metabolism and body temperature. We investigated the effect of a daily cycle in ambient temperature on short-day acclimation and torpor expression in juvenile and adult Djungarian hamsters. The animals were exposed to a cold dark phase (6 degrees C) and a warmer light phase (18 degrees C) and were compared with control hamsters kept at a constant ambient temperature of 18 degrees C. Under constant conditions, torpor expression did not differ between adult and juvenile hamsters. Although the daily temperature cycle evoked an increased metabolic rate in adult and juvenile hamsters during the dark phase and strengthened the synchronization between torpor entrance and the beginning of the light phase, it did not induce the expected torpor facilitation. In adult hamsters, torpor expression profiles did not differ from those under constant conditions at all. In contrast, juvenile hamsters showed a delayed onset of torpor season, a decreased torpor frequency, depth and duration, as well as an increased number of early torpor terminations coinciding with the rise in ambient temperature after the beginning of the light phase. While the temperature challenge appeared to be of minor importance for energy balance and torpor expression in adult hamsters, it profoundly influenced the overall energy saving strategy of juvenile hamsters, promoting torpor-alleviating active foragers over torpor-prone energy-savers. In addition, our data suggest a more efficient acclimation in juvenile hamsters under additional energy challenges, which reduces the need for torpor expression. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"Thermal preference, thermal resistance, and metabolic rate of juvenile Chinese pond turtles <i>Mauremys reevesii</i> acclimated to different temperatures","Xu, Wei and Dang, Wei and Geng, Jun and Lu, Hong-Liang",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2015.09.003,"The thermal acclimatory capacity of a particular species may determine its resilience to environmental change. Evaluating the physiological acclimatory responses of economically important species is useful for determining their optimal culture conditions. Here, juvenile Chinese three-keeled pond turtles (Mauremys reevesii) were acclimated to one of three different temperatures (17, 25 or 33 degrees C) for four weeks to assess the effects of thermal acclimation on some physiological traits. Thermal acclimation significantly affected thermal resistance, but not thermal preference, of juvenile M. reevesii. Turtles acclimated to 17 degrees C were less resistant to high temperatures than those acclimated to 25 degrees C and 33 degrees C. However, turtles increased resistance to low temperatures with decreasing acclimation temperature. The acclimation response ratio of the critical thermal minimum (CTMin) was lower than that of the critical thermal maximum (CTMax) for acclimation temperatures between 17 and 25 degrees C, but slightly higher between 25 and 33 degrees C. The thermal resistance range (i.e., the difference between CTMax and CTMin) was widest in turtles acclimated to the intermediate temperature (25 degrees C), and narrowest in those acclimated to low temperature (17 degrees C). The standard metabolic rate increased as body temperature and acclimation temperature increased, and the temperature quotient (Q(10)) between acclimation temperatures 17 and 25 degrees C was higher than the Q(10) between 25 and 33 degrees C. Our results suggest that juvenile M. reevesii may have a greater resistance under mild thermal conditions resembling natural environments, and better physiological performance at relatively warm temperatures.

Temperature and developmental responses of body and cell size in <i>Drosophila</i>; effects of polyploidy and genome configuration,"Jalal, Marwa and Andersen, Tom and Hessen, Dag O.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2015.02.011,"Increased adult body size in Drosophila raised at lower temperatures could be attributed both to an increase in the cell volume and cell number. It is not clear, however, whether increased cell size is related to (or even caused by) increased nuclear volume and genome size (or configuration). Experiments with Drosophila melanogaster stocks (Oregon-R and w1118) raised at 16, 22, 24, and 28 degrees C resulted in larger adult body and wing size with lower temperature, while eye size was less affected. The increase in wing size reflected an increase in cell size in both males and females of both stocks. The nucleus size, genome size, and DNA condensation of adult flies, embryos, and Schneider 2 cells (52 cells, of larval origin) were estimated by flow cytometry. In both adult flies and S2 cells, both nucleus size and DNA condensation varied with temperature, while DNA content appears to be constant. From 12\% to 18\% of the somatic cells were tetraploid (4C) and 2-5\% were octoploid (8C), and for the Oregon strain we observed an increase in the fraction of polyploid cells with decreasing temperature. The observed increase in body size (and wing size) at low temperatures could partly be linked with the cell size and DNA condensation, while corresponding changes in the haploid genome size were not observed.

Mitochondrial active and relaxed state respiration after heat shock mRNA response in the heart,"Vogt, Sebastian and Irqsusi, Marc and Naraghi, Hamid and Sattler, Alexander and Ruppert, Volker and Weber, Petra and Rhiel, Annika and Ramzan, Rabia",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.01.007,"Induction of Heat Shock Proteins results in cytoprotection. Beneficial effect results from transcription and translational cellular components' involvement that defends metabolism and thus induce ischemic protection of the tissue. Mitochondrial respiration is also involved in stress- induced conditions. It is not a uniform process. Cytochrome c Oxidase (CytOx) representing complex IV of the Electron Transfer Chain (ETC) has a regulatory role for mitochondrial respiratory activity, which is tested in our study after hsp induction. Moreover, protein translation for mitochondrial components was probed by the detection of MT-CO1 for Subunit 1 of CytOx neosynthesis. Wistar rats were subjected to whole-body hyperthermia at 42.0-42.5 degrees C for 15 min followed by a normothermic recovery period. Heat shock response was monitored time dependent from LV biopsies of all control and heat treated animals with PCR-analysis for hsp 32, 60, 70.1, 70.2, 90 and MT-CO1 expression at 15, 30, 45, 60, 120 and 360 min recovery (n = 5 in each group), respectively. Enzymatic activity of CytOx were evaluated polarographically. High energy phosphates were detected by chromatographic analysis. The mRNA expression of MT-CO1 peaked at 60 min and was accompanied by hsp 32 (r = 0.457; p = 0.037) and hsp 70.2 (r = 0.615; p = 0.003) upregulation. With lisp induction, mitochondrial respiration was increased initially. Enzymatic activity reconciled from active into relaxed status wherein CytOx activity was completely inhibited by ATP.

Hyperthermic, myocardial hsp- induction goes along with increased CytOx activity representing an increased ``active{''} mitochondrial respiration. In parallel, de -novo holoenzyme assembly of CytOx begins as shown by MT-CO1 upregulation at 60 min recovery time crossing with a final return to the physiological ``relaxed{''} state and ATP -inhibited respiration.",2019,80,NA,106-112

After 15 days acclimation at thermo neutral zone (TNZ) in psychrometric chamber, animals were exposed at 42 degrees C for 6 h up to 23 days followed by 12 days of recovery period. Blood samples were collected during control period at TNZ (day 1, 5 and 12), after heat stress exposure (day 1-10, Short Term Heat Stress Acclimation-STHSA; day 15-23, Long Term Heat Stress Acclimation-LTHSA) and recovery period (day 7 and 12) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated for RNA and protein extraction. Serum cortisol concentration was assessed by RIA. The mRNA and protein expression in PBMCs were determined by qPCR and western blot respectively. Samples at TNZ were taken as control. Serum cortisol concentration was increased (P < 0.05) during STHSA and gradually declined during LTHSA. Toll like receptor 2 (TLR 2) expression was up regulated (P < 0.05) during STHSA and declined to basal level during LTHSA and recovery phase. However, toll like receptor 4 (TLR 4) expression was up regulated (P < 0.05) during STHSA and LTHSA while declined in recovery phase. Interleukin 2 (IL2) and interleukin 6 (IL 6) were up regulated (P < 0.05) during STHSA and reduced to basal level during LTHSA. PBMCs culture study was conducted to study transcriptional abundance of TLR2/4 and IL2/6 at different temperature-time combinations. The present findings indicate that TLR 2/4 and IL 2/6 could possibly play a vital role in thermo tolerance in Tharparkar cattle during short term and long term heat stress exposure.",2017,65,NA,48-56
Genome-wide association study on the body temperature changes of a broiler-type strain Taiwan country chickens under acute heat stress,"Zhuang, Zi-Xuan and Chen, Shuen-Ei and Chen, Chih-Feng and Lin, En-Chung and Huang, San-Yuan",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.03.007,"Body temperature is the simplest parameter for evaluating the physiological conditions of animals under thermal stress. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified candidate genes related to economic traits in domestic animals. The present study conducted a GWAS on body temperature changes in a broiler-type strain Taiwan country chickens (TCCs) under acute heat stress. A total of two hundred 30-week-old roosters of a broiler-type strain TCCs were used. The roosters were subjected to acute heat stress at 38 degrees C for 4 h, and their body temperature was recorded before and during heat stress. The change in body temperature (Delta T) of each rooster was calculated according to the difference between the initial temperature and the highest body temperature during heat stress. The roosters were categorized according to survival and Delta T at the end into dead, susceptible, resistant, and intermediate groups. Collected red blood cells were genotyped using a 600 K chicken single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. A GWAS for Delta T was conducted using the Cochran-Armitage trend test. Significant SNPs were annotated as candidate genes according to the nearest genes. Results indicated that the Delta T of the heat-resistant group was significantly lower than that of the heat-susceptible group. A total of 17 SNPs belonging to 8 candidate genes, 352 SNPs for 78 candidate genes, and 174 significant SNPs for 63 candidate genes were identified in the association analyses in the dead vs. survival, resistant vs. susceptible, and intermediate vs. susceptible groups, respectively. The annotated candidate genes are associated with apoptosis, cellular response to external stimuli, and signal transduction pathways. In conclusion, the significant SNPs located in and proximal to genes in the GWAS analysis were related to apoptosis or responses to external stimuli which serve as potential candidates underlying physiological adaptation to heat stress or thermotolerance in chickens.",2019,82,NA,33-42
Intraspecific geographic variation in thermal limits and acclimatory capacity in a wide distributed endemic frog,"Barria, Aura M. and Bacigalupe, Leonardo D.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.08.010,"Intraspecific variation in physiological traits and the standard metabolic rate (SMR) is common in widely distributed ectotherms since populations at contrasting latitudes experiences different thermal conditions. The climatic variability hypothesis (CVH) states that populations at higher latitudes presents higher acclimation capacity than those at lower latitudes, given the wider range of climatic variability they experience. The endemic four-eyed frog, Pleurodema thaul is widely distributed in Chile. We examined the variation in maximum and minimum critical temperatures (CTmax and CTmin), preferred temperature (T-pref), SMR and their acclimatory capacity in two populations from the northern and center of its distribution. All the traits are higher in the warmer population. The capacity for acclimation varies between traits and, with the exception of CTmax and T-pret, it is similar between populations. This pattern could be explained by the higher daily thermal variability in desert environments, that increases plasticity to the levels found in the high latitude population. However, we found low acclimatory capacity in all physiological traits, of only about 3\% for CTmin) 10\% for CTmax and T-pref and 1\% for SMR. Thus, despite the fact that Pleurodema thaul possess some ability to adjust thermal tolerances in response to changing thermal conditions, this acclimatory capacity seems to be unable to prevent substantial buffering when body temperatures rise. The low acclimatory capacity found for P. thaul suggests that this species use behavioral rather than physiological adjustments to compensate for environmental variation, by exploiting available micro-environments with more stable thermal conditions.",2017,69,NA,254-260
Leptin regulates energy intake but fails to facilitate hibernation in fattening Daurian ground squirrels (<i>Spermophilus</i> <i>dauricus</i>),"Xing, Xin and Tang, Gang-Bin and Sun, Ming-Yue and Yu, Chao and Song, Shi-Yi and Liu, Xin Yu and Yang, Ming and Wang, De-Hua",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.01.013,"Body fat storage before hibernation affects the timing of immergence in Daurian ground squirrels (Spermophilus dauricus). Leptin is an adipose signal and plays vital role in energy homeostasis mainly by action in brain. To test the hypothesis that leptin plays a role in facilitating the process of hibernation, squirrels were administrated with recombinant murine leptin (1 mu g/day) through intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection for 12 days during fattening. From day 7 to 12, animals were moved into a cold room (5 +/- 1 degrees C) with constant darkness which functioned as hibernaculum. Energy intake, body mass and core body temperature (T-b) were continuously monitored throughout the course of experiment. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) was measured under both warm and cold conditions. At the end of leptin administration, we measured the serum concentration of hormones related to energy regulation, mRNA expression of hypothalamic neuropeptides and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) levels in brown adipose tissue (BAT). Our results showed that during leptin administration, the cumulative food intake and increase of body mass were suppressed. while T-b and RMR were unaltered. The proportion of torpid squirrels was not different between two groups. At the end of leptin administration, the expressions of hypothalamic neuropeptide Y and agouti gene-related protein were suppressed. There were no differences in UCP1 mRNA expression or protein content in BAT between groups. Our data suggest that leptin can affect energy intake via hypothalamic neuropeptides, but is not involved in the initiation of hibernation in fattening Daurian ground squirrels.

Chronic oral administration of pine bark extract (flavangenol) attenuates brain and liver mRNA expressions of HSPs in heat-exposed chicks,"Yang, Hui and Chowdhury, Vishwajit S. and Bahry, Mohammad A. and Tran, Phuong V. and Do, Phong H. and Han, Guofeng and Zhang, Rong and Tagashira, Hideki and Tsubata, Masahito and Furuse, Mitsuhiro",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.06.014,"Exposure to a high ambient temperature (HT) can cause heat stress, which has a huge negative impact on physiological functions. Cellular heat-shock response is activated upon exposure to HT for cellular maintenance and adaptation. In addition, antioxidants are used to support physiological functions under HT in a variety of organisms. Flavangenol, an extract of pine bark, is one of the most potent antioxidants with its complex mixture of polyphenols. In the current study, chronic (a single daily oral administration for 14 days) or acute (a single oral administration) oral administration of flavangenol was performed on chicks. Then the chicks were exposed to an acute HT (40 +/- 1 degrees C for 3 h) to examine the effect of flavangenol on the mRNA expression of heat-shock protein (HSP) in the brain and liver. Rectal temperature, plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AAT), a marker of liver damage, and plasma corticosterone as well as metabolites were also determined. HSP-70 and -90 mRNA expression, rectal temperature, plasma AAT and corticosterone were increased by HT. Interestingly, the chronic, but not the acute, administration of flavangenol caused a declining in the diencephalic mRNA expression of HSP-70 and -90 and plasma AAT in HT-exposed chicks. Moreover, the hepatic mRNA expression of HSP-90 was also significantly decreased by chronic oral administration of flavangenol in HT chicks. These results indicate that chronic, but not acute, oral administration of flavangenol attenuates HSP mRNA expression in the central and peripheral tissues due to its possible role in improving cellular protective functions during heat stress. The flavangenol-dependent decline in plasma MT further suggests that liver damage induced by heat stress was minimized by flavangenol. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2016,60,NA,140-148

The underlying mechanism of heat acclimation in insects is still unclear. Here, the heat selection and transcript level response in the larvae of the rice leaf folder Cnaphalocrocis medinalis Guenee, a serious pest of rice in summer, were studied. The survival and fecundity of larvae during multigenerational heat selection at 39 degrees C were examined, and heat tolerance and mRNA expression of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and 90 (Hsp90) were examined under heat stress. The results showed that survival and fecundity of larvae increased notably and then kept constant after two or three generations of heat selection. Heat selection improved thermal tolerance of larvae. The Hsp70 mRNA expression of the 3rd-instar larvae increased in all five generations of heat selection, but Hsp90 increased only in the first two generations. The response of Hsp70 to 39 degrees C heat treatment in the larvae kept at 27 degrees C was different from the larvae exposed to the conditioning heat treatments, but the response of Hsp 90 was similar. Moreover, the Hsp70 and Hsp90 mRNA expression levels were significantly higher in the heat-acclimated larvae than that in the unacclimated larvae at a comparable duration of exposure to 37 and 41 degrees C.

The influence of cooling and TRPM8 ion channel activation on the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines in normotensive and hypertensive rats,"Kozyreva, Tamara V. and Khramova, Galina M. and Voronova, Irina P. and Evtushenko, Anna A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.09.004,"The role of thermosensitive TRP ion channels in physiological processes in the whole organism is far from being clear. In present work we tried to understand the possible participation of the cold-sensitive ion channel TRPM8 in regulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine level in blood, and to see if hypertension (widely spread disease) changes this relationship. Experiments were carried out on normotensive Wistar rats and rats with inherited stress-induced arterial hypertension. The effects of deep rapid and slow cooling with decrease in rectal temperature by 3 degrees C, and activation of the skin TRPM8 ion channel by its agonist menthol (application of 1\% L-menthol) on the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1 beta and TNF alpha) in blood have been studied. The data have shown that the TRPM8 ion channel participates in regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine in the whole organism, as well as exposure to cold. In normotensive animals the activation of the cold-sensitive TRPM8 ion channel in skin by its agonist menthol without any temperature shifts causes an increase (about two fold) of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1 beta in blood without any changes in the level of TNF alpha. The effect of cooling (slow or rapid) on IL-6 and IL-1 beta is comparable with the effect of the TRPM8 activation. The changes in TNF alpha concentration were observed only at slow cooling. In hypertensive rats there were no changes in the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines under the effect of cooling or activation of the TRPM8 ion channel. This evidences for the decrease in TRPM8 activity under arterial hypertension. One of possible mechanisms of profound changes at arterial hypertension may be the alteration in activity of some ion channels, and TRPM8 is one of them. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Effect of thermal manipulation during embryogenesis on the promoter methylation and expression of myogenesis-related genes in duck skeletal muscle,"Wang, Yushi and Yan, Xiping and Liu, Hehe and Hu, Shenqiang and Hu, Jiwei and Li, Liang and Wang, Jiwen",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.12.023,"Avian embryos are an ideal system to investigate the effect of incubation temperature on embryonic development, but the characteristics and mechanisms of temperature effects on poultry embryonic myogenesis are unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of increasing the incubation temperature by 1 degrees C on the expression of nine myogenesis-related genes in ducks and then explored the correlation between the alteration of promoter methylation and the expression of two of the nine genes under thermal manipulation (TM). The qRT-PCR results showed that TM during embryonic days (ED) 1-10 promoted (P < 0.05) the expression of genes in breast muscle (PAX3, PAX7, MYOG, MCK, SIX1, TNNC1) and leg muscle (MYOD, MYOG, MYF5, MCK, AKIRIN2, TNNC1). TM during ED10-20 promoted the expression of PAX3, MYFS and MCK and inhibited AKIRIN2 expression in breast muscle (P < 0.05); however, it inhibited the expression of PAX3, PAX7, MYOD, MYOG, MYF5, SIX1, AKIRIN2 and TNNC1 and promoted MCK expression in leg muscle (P < 0.05). TM during ED20-27 inhibited the expression of genes in breast muscle (PAX7) and leg muscle (MYOD, MYOG, MYF5, TNNC1) and promoted MCK expression in breast and leg muscle (P < 0.05). Furthermore, with the Sequenom MassARRAY platform, it was observed that the average methylation level of AKIRIN2 (ED10) and TNNC1 (ED20) in leg muscle decreased (P < 0.05) after TM. Notably, we found significant (P < 0.05) inverse correlations between the methylation and mRNA levels of AKIRIN2 under TM during ED1-10 (r = - 0.969) and ED10-20 (r = - 0.805). Taken together, TM during ED1-10 was more favorable for improving duck myogenesis-related gene expression than TM during ED10-20 and ED20-27. TM during duck embryogenesis seemed to have a greater effect on the development of leg muscle than breast muscle and might alter AKIRIN2 expression by changing its promoter methylation status. These findings may be helpful to understand temperature effects on the muscle development of avian embryos and to explore the role of epigenetic regulation during this process.",2019,80,NA,75-81

M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2014.06.006,"Laboratory mice housed under standard vivarium conditions with an ambient temperature (T-a) of similar to 22 degrees C are likely to be cold stressed because this T-a is below their thermoneutral zone (TNZ). Mice raised at T(a)s within the TNZ adapt to the warmer temperatures, developing smaller internal organs and longer tails compared to mice raised at 22 degrees C. Since mice prefer T(a)s equal to their TNZ when housed in a thermocline, we hypothesized that mice reared for long periods (e.g., months) in a thermocline would undergo significant changes in organ development and tail length as a result of their thermoregulatory behavior. Groups of three female BALB/c mice at an age of 37 days were housed together in a thermocline consisting of a 90 cm long aluminum runway with a floor temperature ranging from 23 to 39 degrees C. Two side-by-side thermoclines allowed for a total of 6 mice to be tested simultaneously. Control mice were tested in isothermal runways maintained at a T-a of 22 degrees C. All groups were given cotton pads for bedding/nest building. Mass of heart, lung, liver, kidney, brain, and tail length were assessed after 73 days of treatment. Mice in the thermocline and control (isothermal) runways were compared to cage control mice housed 3/cage with bedding under standard vivarium conditions. Mice in the thermocline generally remained in the warm end throughout the daytime with little evidence of nest building, suggesting a state of thermal comfort. Mice in the isothermal runway built elaborate nests and huddled together in the daytime. Mice housed in the thermocline had significantly smaller livers and kidneys and an increase in tail length compared to mice in the isothermal runway as well as when compared to the cage controls. These patterns of organ growth and tail length of mice in the thermocline are akin to warm adaptation. Thus, thermoregulatory behavior altered organ development, a process we term behaviorally mediated, warm adaptation. Moreover, the data suggest that the standard vivarium conditions are likely a cold stress that alters normal organ development relative to mice allowed to select their thermal preferendum.

Two hundred and seventy one-day-old chicks (135 male chicks of each breed; Ross 308 and Cobb 500) were used in this work. On the 21st day of age, birds were allocated randomly into 3 equal groups till the 42 days of age (CON:raised in a thermoneutral condition; HS1 and HS2 groups were subjected to 4 and 6 h of daily thermal stress, respectively). Regardless of genetic type, thermal stress decreased the dressing percentage in broilers when compared with the thermoneutral conditions (p = 0.039). In both broiler strains, thermal stress for 6 h (HS2) increased the heterophil to lymphocyte ratio (p = 0.036) and the serum albumin, cholesterol and triglyceride levels (p = 0.023, 0.012 and 0.005, respectively) compared with the thermoneutral group. Under the thermonuteral and heat stress conditions, the Ross broiler chickens showed a significant lower serum triiodothyronine level compared with the Cobb boilers (p = 0.042). It is interesting to note that the expression of HSP70 in the liver of heat-stressed Ross broilers, either 4 or 6 h, was significantly (p = 0.002) higher than that reported in the heat-stressed Cobb broilers. In both broiler strains, the thermal stress for 6 h up-regulate the expression of SOD gene (p = 0.001), but down-regulate the expression of GH gene (p = 0.021) when compared with the CON group. In conclusion, chronic thermal stress down-regulate the mRNA expression of liver GH, concomitantly with an increase in the expression of HSP70 and SOD genes in both broiler strains. This could be useful in the identification of molecular genetic markers to assist in selecting broilers that are more tolerant to heat stress.",2018,74,NA,337-343
Insight into AMPK regulation mechanism <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>: Responses to low temperatures in the olive flounder <i>Paralichthys olivaceus</i>,"Nie, Miaomiao and Lu, Yunliang and Zou, Congcong and Wang, Lijuan and Zhang, Peijun and You, Feng",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102640,"The olive flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus, is a commercially important maricultured fish in China, Japan, and Korea. Low winter temperatures influence its survival and growth and affect the output of the aquaculture industry. Energy metabolism is essential for fish survival, and the central energy-regulating factor - 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) - plays an important role in responses to cold stress. However, the mechanism of AMPK pathway regulation in fish coping with cold stress remains poorly understood. In the present study, the expression of AMPK and its upstream (LKB1 and CaMKK beta) and downstream genes (SITR1, FOXO1A, and TFAM) in the brain, muscle, and heart was analyzed while the flounder was under cold stress (0.2 +/- 0.2 degrees C). The results showed that low temperatures activated LKB1, CaMKK beta, and AMPK genes in the brain, and the activated AMPK induced expression of SITR1, FOXO1A, and TFAM. In the muscle tissue, the expression patterns of these genes presented a trend of initially decreasing and then increasing, and there was a delay in the response to low temperatures. At the cellular level, comparative analysis of the effects of the activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide1-beta-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR) and inhibitor compound C of the AMPK pathway demonstrated that cold stress was similar to AICAR, which activated the AMPK pathway with hysteresis. Thus, the regulation mechanism of AMPK under cold stress was preliminarily analyzed.

After acclimation, fish were sampled to investigate changes in the levels of blood glucose, tissue glycogen and ascorbic acid, activities of enzymes involved in glycolysis (LDH), citric acid cycle (MDH), gluconeogenesis (FBPase and G6Pase), pentose phosphate pathway (G6PDH), protein metabolism (AST and ALT), phosphate metabolism (ACP and ALP) and energy metabolism (ATPase), and HSP70 levels in various tissues. Acclimation to higher temperatures (33 and 36 degrees C) significantly increased activities of LDH, MDH, ALP, ACP, AST, ALT and ATPase and blood glucose levels, whereas decreased the G6PDH enzyme activity and, tissue glycogen and ascorbic acid. Results indicated an overall increase in the carbohydrate, protein and lipid metabolism implying increased metabolic demands for maintaining homeostasis in fish acclimated to higher temperatures (33 and 36 degrees C). We observed tissue specific response of HSP70 in H. brachysoma, with significant increase in gill and liver at 33 and 36 degrees C, and in brain and muscle at 36 degrees C, enabling cellular protection at higher acclimation temperatures. In conclusion, H. brachysoma adjusted metabolic and cellular responses to withstand increased temperatures, however, these responses suggest that the fish was under stress at 33 degrees C or higher temperature.",2017,65,NA,32-40
Distinct vasopressin content in the hypothalamic supraoptic and paraventricular nucleus of rats exposed to low and high ambient temperature,"Jasnic, N. and Dakic, T. and Bataveljic, D. and Vujovic, P. and Lakic, I. and Jevdjovic, T. and Djurasevic, S. and Djordjevic, J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2015.04.004,"Both high and low ambient temperature represent thermal stressors that, among other physiological responses, induce activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and secretion of argininevasopressin (AVP). The exposure to heat also leads to disturbance of osmotic homeostasis. Since AVP, in addition to its well-known peripheral effects, has long been recognized as a hormone involved in the modulation of HPA axis activity, the aim of the present study was to elucidate the hypothalamic AVP amount in the acutely heat/cold exposed rats. Rats were exposed to high (+38 degrees C) or low (+4 degrees C) ambient temperature for 60 min. Western blot was employed for determining hypothalamic AVP levels, and the difference in its content between supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN) was detected using immunohistochemical analysis. The results showed that exposure to both high and low ambient temperature increased hypothalamic AVP levels, although the increment was higher under heat conditions. On the other hand, patterns of AVP level changes in PVN and SON were stressor-specific, given that exposure to cold increased the AVP level in both nuclei, while heat exposure affected the PVN AVP content alone. In conclusion, our results revealed that cold and heat stress influence hypothalamic AVP amount with different intensity. Moreover, different pattern of AVP amount changes in the PVN and SON indicates a role of this hormone not only in response to heat as an osmotic/physical threat, but to the non-osmotic stressors as well.

Thermal manipulation during the middle incubation stage has a repressive effect on the immune organ development of Peking ducklings,"Liu, Junying and Yan, Xiping and Li, Qingqing and Wang, Guosong and Liu, Hehe and Wang, Jiwen and Li, Liang and Du, Xiaohui and Han, Chunchun and He, Hua",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2013.09.001,"Avian embryos are easily influenced by their environment during incubation. Previous studies have demonstrated that incubation temperature changes could influence muscle development and body weight, which subsequently determine the adult phenotype. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the development of immune organs in ducklings could be influenced by thermal manipulation during the middle stage of incubation. To evaluate this hypothesis, a control group was incubated under a normal temperature from Ell to E24, while the incubation temperature of the experimental group was increased by 1 C. Our results indicated that slight changes in the incubation temperature significantly repressed the bursa of Fabricius index of the duck embryo on E25 (F1, 58=122.51, P <0.0001) and significantly repressed the spleen index of neonatal ducklings (F1, 58=74.38, P <0.0001). At 0 day posthatching (dph) and 14 dph, ducklings hatched from eggs incubated under the higher temperature had a lower percentage of globulin than the control group (F1, 10=19.97, P=0.0111; Fl, 10=9.8, P=0.0352). The IFN-y concentration of ducklings at 14 dph displayed the same trend (Fl, 10=284.49, P < 0.0001). These results suggested that thermal manipulation during the middle stage of incubation had a repressive effect on the development of immune organs and reduced the concentrations of serum globulin and IFN-y. These results demonstrated that the subtle alteration of incubation temperature may weaken ducklings' immunity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2013,38,8,520-523
Differential expression of small heat shock proteins in the brain of broiler embryo; the effects of embryonic thermal manipulation,"Basaki, Mehdi and Sahraiy, Nazila and Keykavusi, Kamran and Akbari, Ghasem and Shahbazfar, Amir Ali and Kianifard, Davoud",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102719,"Broilers are more vulnerable to high temperatures than mammals due to the feather cover, lack of sweat glands, fast growth and intensive breeding in commercial systems. Thermal stresses affect the function of various organs and change the expression profiles of hundreds of genes in the different tissues of broilers. Thermal manipulation (TM) during embryogenesis can increase heat tolerance in growing broilers. Small heat shock proteins (SHSPs) are a group of HSPs which participate in many cellular functions like response to different stressors. However, their role in the thermotolerance has not been fully elucidated. Ninety fertilized eggs were randomly divided into three groups (30 eggs/group; 10 eggs/replicate). Normal control (NC) eggs were incubated at 37.5 degrees C throughout the incubation period whereas heat stress (HS) and cold stress (CS) groups were kept at 41 degrees C and 33 degrees C from 15 to 17th day of incubation for 3 h each day, respectively. On day 20, samples from the cerebrums were harvested for histopathology and mRNA expression analyses of HSPB1, HSPB5, HSPB8, and HSPB9. There were no significant differences in survivability, defected embryos, hatchability, and body weight among treatments. TM had no major deleterious effects on the cerebral tissue except for mild degeneration in the HS group. HSPB1, HSPB5, HSPB8, and HSPB9 were expressed in the presence and absence of TM. All SHSP genes tested were down-regulated in response to TM except for HSPB9 which was upregulated in the HS group. The highest change in gene expression due to TM observed for HSPB1. This study presents a broader understanding of mechanisms underlying response to TM in broilers. The results suggest that HSPB1, HSPB5, HSPB8, and HSPB9 are involved in thermotolerance in broilers and SHSPs could be involved in the gene expression profiling of TM. It may propose the use of nutritional supplements in the poultry industry to modulate SHSPs.",2020,93,NA,NA
The effects of increased constant incubation temperature and cumulative acute heat shock exposures on morphology and survival of Lake Whitefish (<i>Coregonus</i> <i>clupeaformis</i>) embryos,"Lee, Abigail H. and Eme, John and Mueller, Casey A. and Manzon, Richard G. and Somers, Christopher M. and Boreham, Douglas R. and Wilson, Joanna Y.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.01.010,"Increasing incubation temperatures, caused by global climate change or thermal effluent from industrial processes, may influence embryonic development of fish. This study investigates the cumulative effects of increased incubation temperature and repeated heat shocks on developing Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) embryos. We studied the effects of three constant incubation temperatures (2 degrees C, 5 inverted perpendicular C or 8 degrees C water) and weekly, 1-h heat shocks (+3 degrees C) on hatching time, survival and morphology of embryos, as these endpoints may be particularly susceptible to temperature changes. The constant temperatures represent the predicted magnitude of elevated water temperatures from climate change and industrial thermal plumes. Time to the pre-hatch stage decreased as constant incubation temperature increased (148 d at 2 degrees C, 92 d at 5 degrees C, 50 d at 8 degrees C), but weekly heat shocks did not affect time to hatch. Mean survival rates and embryo morphometrics were compared at specific developmental time-points (blastopore, eyed, fin flutter and pre-hatch) across all treatments. Constant incubation temperatures or +3 degrees C heat-shock exposures did not significantly alter cumulative survival percentage (similar to 50\% cumulative survival to pre-hatch stage). Constant warm incubation temperatures did result in differences in morphology in pre-hatch stage embryos. 8 degrees C and 5 degrees C embryos were significantly smaller and had larger yolks than 2 inverted perpendicular C embryos, but heat-shocked embryos did not differ from their respective constant temperature treatment groups. Elevated incubation temperatures may adversely alter Lake Whitefish embryo size at hatch, but weekly 1-h heat shocks did not affect size or survival at hatch. These results suggest that intermittent bouts of warm water effluent (e.g., variable industrial emissions) are less likely to negatively affect Lake Whitefish embryonic development than warmer constant incubation temperatures that may occur due to climate change.

Effect of curcumin supplementation on TLR4 mediated non-specific immune responses in liver of laying hens under high-temperature conditions,"Nawab, Aamir and Li, Guanghui and An, Lilong and Wu, Jiang and Chao, Liuwen and Xiao, Mei and Zhao, Yi and Birmani, Muhammad Waseem and Ghani, Muhammad Waseem",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.003,"The liver performs a significant role in innate and adaptive immunity. Heat stress causes oxidative stress in liver tissues and reduces the immune responses of laying hens which can cause several diseases affecting poultry-production performance. Hepatic inflammation is a common trigger of liver disease, which is reflected by hepatic tissue damage leading to fibrogenesis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Dietary manipulation of curcumin has been proposed to ameliorate the immune status of chickens under heat stress. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effect of curcumin supplementation on TLR4 mediated non-specific immune response in liver of laying hens under high-temperature conditions. Experimental groups contained two controls groups (high temperature and thermo-neutral control (HC and NC) fed basal diet) and three high-temperature curcumin treatments groups (HT100, HT200 and HT300). Laying hens in HC and HT groups exposed 6 h/day heat stress (32 +/- 1 degrees C). The results of present study showed that heat stress curcumin treatment group had reduced inflammatory responses (IL-6, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha) as compared to HC and NC group. Pathological lesions and DNA damage of immune tissues were decreased in heat stress curcumin supplementation as compared to HC and NC group. Furthermore, PCNA, TLR4 and its downstream gene expression as well as protein expression (TLR4, NF-kappa B and PCNA) were significantly down regulated in heat stress curcumin supplemented group as compared to HC and NC group. Therefore, it is concluded that heat stressed hens supplemented with dietary curcumin enhance the immunity of laying hens and combat stressful environmental conditions.",2019,84,NA,384-397
Influence of temperature on swimming performance and respiration rate of the cold-water cyclopoid copepod<i> Cyclops</i><i> vicinus</i>,"Svetlichny, Leonid and Obertegger, Ulrike",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103320,"Little is known on the swimming activity and respiration rate of the cyclopoid copepod Cyclops vicinus. Here, the swimming speed and respiration rate of C. vicinus were measured at different temperatures using a high speed (up to 1200 frames per second) camera and a closed-system respirometry, respectively. For cruise and escape swimming, log-linear relationships were found between temperature (range 1-22 C) and duration, speed, and frequency of locomotor acts, respectively. The respiration rate of immobilized and active individuals showed log -linear relationships with temperature (range of 2-20 C) and a thermal coefficient Q10 \& AP;2 was found. The maximum respiration rate of swimming females was 7.8 and 6.4 times higher than that of immobilized in-dividuals at 2 and 20 C, respectively. To better understand how temperature affects the energy efficiency of copepod swimming, the mechanical energy of movement was estimated from sswimming speed and the meta-bolic energy was estimated from the amount of oxygen consumed during swimming. Linear relationships be-tween swimming speed and mechanical and metabolic energy, respectively, were found at all experimental temperatures. At 20 C, the maximum mechanical and metabolic energy costs for movement was 15.2 x 10-5 and 37.7 x 10-4 J h-1, respectively. In the range of 2-20 C, the mechanical energy attributed to swimming represented only a small portion (4.0-8.2\%) of the total metabolic energy. Cold-water specialization probably limited the increase of the swimming speed of C. vicinus at high temperatures compared to that of warm-water adapted species.",2022,109,NA,NA

Here, we incubated green turtle (Chelonia mydas) eggs from Ganquan Island, South China Sea, at five constant temperatures (26, 28, 30, 32 and 34 degrees C) to determine hatching success, incubation length and hatchling phenotype at each test temperature and temperatures optimal for embryonic development. Temperature affected hatching success, incubation length and all seven examined hatchlings traits, and clutch origin affected three (head length, fore-flipper length and hind flipper length) of the seven. Hatching success was lowest at 34 degrees C and none of hatchlings hatched at this temperature was normal and survived over one week. The rate of embryonic development and the rate of post-hatch growth both were lowest at 26 degrees C. Given that low survival and growth rates can translate into reduced individual fitness, we conclude that both 26 degrees C and 34 degrees C are unsuitable for incubation of C. mydas eggs. Post-hatch growth was fastest in hatchlings incubated at 30 degrees C, and eggs of C. mydas incubated at temperatures around 30 degrees C are more likely to produce mixed sexes. Accordingly, we conclude that temperatures within the range from 28 degrees C to 32 degrees C are generally optimal for embryonic development of C. mydas.",2022,104,NA,NA

Fishes shift their thermal tolerance range with a maximum and minimum temperature correlated to their recent thermal acclimation history, and species can show a reduced temperature quotient (Q(10)) following chronic thermal acclimation. Neon tetra (Paracheirodon innesi) and Black Neon tetra (Hyphessobrycon herbertaxelrodi) are popular hobbyist aquarium fishes, and both species are examples of freshwater teleosts native to South American river systems that are potentially affected by changing thermal conditions. We acclimated these species to three different constant temperatures (26 degrees C, 29 degrees C, and 31 degrees C) for 15.4 +/- 2.1 days, then measured acute critical thermal maxima (CTMax) and acute oxygen consumption rate (Mo-2) at each acclimation temperature. We also estimated chronic lethal thermal maximum (CLT) for both species following a 2-week acclimation to 30.4 degrees C. Mean CTMax of both species were found to increase with acclimation temperature from 38.5 to 39.6 degrees C for Neon tetra and from 39.5 to 41.0 degrees C for Black Neon tetra, gaining 0.24 (Neon tetra) or 0.29 degrees C (Black Neon tetra) of tolerance per 1 degrees C of acclimation. However, Black Neon tetra demonstrated consistently higher CTMax (1.0-1.4 degrees C). CLT was lower for Neon tetra (33.5 degrees C), compared to Black Neon tetra (35.9 degrees C). Mean Mo-2 were statistically similar across acclimation temperatures within species; Q(10) between 26-31 degrees C were 1.92 and 1.22 for Neon and Black Neon tetra, respectively. Neon and Black Neon tetras physiologically acclimated to changing thermal demands, and although they demonstrate robust CTMax responses, CLT responses indicated both species are unable to survive temperatures 4-5 degrees C above current average natural values. The demonstrated metabolic plasticity and CTMax values provide a moderate cushion for both species to combat changing temperatures due to climate change, but CLT values suggest vulnerability to projected climate trends.",2019,86,NA,NA
Physiological responses of <i>Corythucha ciliata</i> adults to high temperatures under laboratory and field conditions,"Ju, Rui-Ting and Gao, Lei and Zhou, Xu-Hui and Li, Bo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2014.07.002,"Under high temperature conditions, insects can tolerate to survive through various physiological mechanisms, which have been well documented in laboratory studies. However, it is still unclear as to whether these laboratory data can scale up to those in the field. Here we studied dynamics of heat-induced metabolites in Corythucha ciliata adults under both laboratory and field conditions to examine their significance in thermal tolerance of the species. We compared the effects of controlled thermal treatments (2 h at 33-43 degrees C at 2 degrees C intervals in the laboratory) and naturally increasing thermal conditions (10:00-14:00 at 2-h intervals (33.5-37.2 degrees C) on a hot summer day in a field in Shanghai, China) on water content and levels of water-soluble protein, triglycerides, mannitol, and sorbitol in the adult bodies. The results showed that water content significantly decreased and all other metabolic parameters significantly increased in response to temperature stresses with similar patterns in both the laboratory and field, although the respective threshold temperatures were different under the two conditions. The close linkage observed in the two conditions suggests that a short period of heat stress induces water loss and accumulation of thermal metabolites in C. ciliata adults. This heat-resistance provides a defense mechanism counteracting thermal damage in C. ciliata. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2014,45,NA,15-21
Thermal acclimation of broiler birds by intermittent heat exposure,"Abdelqader, Anas and Al-Fataftah, Abdur-Rahman",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2013.11.001,"Heat stress impairs the performance of broilers which increases the economic losses. Effect of duration of heat exposure on performance and acclimatory responses in broiler birds was investigated. At 21 d of age 160 Hubbard birds (80 males + 80 females) were equally distributed into 5 treatments (T). The T1, T2, T3 and T4 were acclimated by daily exposure to heat (38 +/- 1 degrees C, 62 +/- 2\% RH) for 1, 2, 3 and 4 h/d, respectively, for 14 d. TO was the non-acclimated control (kept at 22 +/- 2 degrees C, 65 +/- 2\% RH). At 36 d of age the thermotolerance of all birds was evaluated under simulated heat wave conditions by exposing them to an acute heat stress (43 +/- 1 degrees C, 55 +/- 3\% RH) for 4 h. Body weight (BW), average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) were not affected in T2 and T3, while T3 and T4 showed significant reductions in BW, ADG and ADFI compared to the control. Daily changes in ADFI/kg of metabolic BW (ADFI/BW0.75), rectal temperature (Tr), rate of increase in rectal temperature (RITr) and evaporative water loss (EWL) showed biphasic patterns of acclimatory responses. The 2 phases were distinctly differentiated by plateau days. Phase 1 characterized by a sharp decline in ADFI/BW0.75 followed by a gradual increase until the plateau, while Tr, RITr and EWL increased sharply followed by gradual decreases until the plateau. Beyond the plateau (phase 2), homeostatic responses in ADFI/BW0.75, Tr, RITr and EWL were observed toward the end of the study. Acclimated birds were able to withstand the simulated heat wave with 0\% mortality, lower Tr, and longer survival time compared to the control. In conclusion, acclimation could protect birds from acute heat waves and associated heat stress mortality until marketing age. However, applicability of these results towards the industry needs further investigations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2014,39,NA,1-5
Does temperature modify slow and fast development in two aphidophagous ladybirds?,"Singh, Neha and Mishra, Geetanjali and Omkar",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2013.11.003,"Development within a population is known to vary with abiotic and biotic factors. However, instances of slow and fast development, i.e. different development rates within the same egg batch or cohort, have not yet been rigorously investigated in many organisms. The present study was undertaken to assess the influence of an exogenous cue, temperature (15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C), on slow and fast development and its effect on reproductive attributes in two ladybird species, Menochilus sexmaculatus (Fabricius) and Propylea dissecta (Mulsant) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). A clear bimodal pattern of distribution with two peaks was found at each temperature where the first peak represented the fast developers and the second peak slow developers. Variation in ratio and development of slow and fast developers within a cohort at different temperatures was observed to ascertain whether the phenomenon has a purely genetic basis or is environmentally influenced. The ratio of slow and fast developers in a cohort differed with temperature but not with species. Slow developers showed a female biased sex ratio and low body mass. Fast developing females laid higher numbers of eggs with higher egg viability than slow developing ones. More slow developers were found at low temperature (15 and 20 degrees C), equal numbers at medium temperature (25 degrees C) and less at higher temperature (30 and 35 degrees C). Results of the study are indicative of stability of the slow and fast development in the egg batch and the likelihood that the variation observed at emergence was owing to exogenous cues influenced differential rates of mortality.

Thermal compensation reduces DNA damage from UV radiation,"Hird, Coen and Cramp, Rebecca L. and Franklin, Craig E.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103711,"Increases in ultraviolet radiation (UVR) correlate spatially and temporally with global amphibian population declines and interact with other stressors such as disease and temperature. Declines have largely occurred in high-altitude areas associated with greater UVR and cooler temperatures. UVR is a powerful mutagenic harming organisms largely by damaging DNA. When acutely exposed to UVR at cool temperatures, amphibian larvae have increased levels of DNA damage. Amphibians may compensate for the depressive effects of temperature on DNA damage through acclimatisation, but it is unknown whether they have this capacity. We reared striped marsh frog larvae (Limnodynastes peronii) in warm (25 degrees C) and cool (15 degrees C) temperatures under a low or moderate daily dose of UVR (10 and 40 mu W cm-2 UV-B for 1 h at midday, respectively) for 18-20 days and then measured DNA damage resulting from an acute high UVR dose (80 mu W cm-2 UV-B for 1.5 h) at a range of temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 degrees C). Larvae acclimated to 15 degrees C and exposed to UVR at 15 degrees C completely compensated UVRinduced DNA damage compared with 25 degrees C acclimated larvae exposed to UVR at 25 degrees C. Additionally, warmacclimated larvae had higher DNA damage than cold-acclimated larvae across test temperatures, which indicated a cost of living in warmer temperatures. Larvae reared under elevated UVR levels showed no evidence of UVR acclimation resulting in lower DNA damage following high UVR exposure. Our finding that thermal acclimation in L. peronii larvae compensated UVR-induced DNA damage at low temperatures suggested that aquatic ectotherms living in cool temperatures may be more resilient to high UVR than previously realised. We suggested individuals or species with less capacity for thermal acclimation of DNA repair mechanisms may be more at risk if exposed to changing thermal and UVR exposure regimes.",2023,117,NA,NA

In intensive shrimp culture, it is of great importance to know the thermal tolerance of cultured species and their oxygen consumption since this affects the physiological condition. In this study, the thermal tolerance of Litopenaeus vannamei was determined by dynamic and static thermal methodologies at different acclimation temperatures (15, 20, 25, and 30 degrees C) and salinities (10, 20, and 30 ppt). The oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was also measured to determine the standard metabolic rate (SMR) of shrimp. Accli-mation temperature significantly affected the thermal tolerance and SMR of Litopenaeus vannamei (P < 0.01). Salinity had a large effect on SMR (P < 0.01) but did not influence the thermal acclimation of the shrimp (P > 0.01). Litopenaeus vannamei is a species that has high thermal tolerance and can survive at extreme temperatures (CTmin-CTmax: 7.2-41.9 degrees C) with its large dynamic (988, 992, and 1004 degrees C2) and static thermal polygon areas (748, 778 and 777 degrees C2) developed at the above temperature and salinity combinations and resistance zone (1001, 81 and 82 degrees C2). The optimal temperature range of Litopenaeus vannamei is the 25-30 degrees C range, where a decrease in standard metabolism is determined with increasing temperature. Given the SMR and optimal temperature range, the results of this study indicate that Litopenaeus vannamei should be cultured at 25-30 degrees C for effective production.",2023,112,NA,NA
Plasticity of thermal performance curves in a narrow range endemic water beetle,"Pallares, Susana and Verberk, Wilco C. E. P. and Bilton, David T.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103113,"Thermal history can plastically alter the response of ectotherms to temperature, and thermal performance curves (TPCs) are powerful tools for exploring how organismal-level performance varies with temperature. Plasticity in TPCs may be favoured in thermally variable habitats, where it can result in fitness benefits. However, thermal physiology remains insufficiently studied for freshwater insects despite freshwater biodiversity being at great risk under global change. Here, we assess how acclimation at either summer or winter average temperatures changes TPCs for locomotion activity and metabolism in Enochrus jesusarribasi (Hydrophilidae), a water beetle endemic to shallow saline streams in SE Spain. This beetle is a bimodal gas exchanger and so we also assessed how aerial and aquatic gas exchange varied across temperatures for both acclimation treatments. Responses of locomotory TPCs to thermal acclimation were relatively weak, but high temperature acclimated beetles tended to exhibit higher maximum locomotor activity and reduced TPC breadth than those acclimated at lower temperature. High temperature acclimation increased the thermal sensitivity of metabolic rates, contrary to the response generally found in aquatic organisms. Higher metabolic rates upon high temperature acclimation were achieved by increasing aerial, rather than aquatic oxygen uptake. Such plastic respiratory behaviour likely contributed to enhanced locomotor performance at temperatures around the optimum and thermal plasticity could thus be an important component in the response of aquatic insects to climate change. However, high temperature acclimation appeared to be detrimental for locomotion in subsequent exposure at upper sublethal temperatures, suggesting that this narrow range endemic may be vulnerable to future climate warming. This study demonstrates that TPCs are context-specific, differing with performance metric as well as thermal history. Such context dependency must be considered when using TPCs to predict organismal responses to climate change.",2021,102,NA,NA

However, the recovery periods from these shocks and their subsequent impacts remain unknown. Herein, our study investigated the effect of short temperature stress on survival, dormancy recovery time, nutritional indices, life traits and development rate for T. castaneum (larvae and adults) and S. oryzae adults. The results showed significant effects on survival rates of T. castaneum (larvae and adults) and S. oryzae adults. When both insects had been exposed to high-temperature shock, survival rates decreased with higher temperatures and longer periods of exposure. Furthermore, recovery times varied between and within the insect species, as prolonged exposure to thermal shocks increased recovery periods. Moreover, dormancy time resulting from the hightemperature shocks significantly affected food deterrence and food intake, regardless of the stage of development, species, exposure periods and temperature-exposure conditions. Subsequently, differences in body growth rates and food consumption rates are an appropriate indicator of differences in food conversion rates under hightemperature shocks, regardless of the species and developmental stages. On the other hand, our results indicated that as high-temperature shocks increased, the total development period increased of T. castaneum. Likewise, the pupal stage increased with increasing high-temperature shocks, and the larval stage decreased with increasing thermal shocks and increasing the periods of exposure. In summary, our study showed the importance of dormancy recovery time and its subsequent effects for improving disinfestation effectiveness of heat treatment, and understanding insect response to high temperatures.",2021,100,NA,NA

Plasma and muscle reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels were significantly higher in fish exposed to heat stress compared to fish not exposed to heat stress, while plasma superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity was significantly lower. The total content of saturated fatty acids (SFA) in fillets was significantly higher in fish exposed to heat stress compared to fish not exposed to heat stress, while he total content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) was significantly lower. Nerolidol prevented the increase of muscle LPO and plasma ROS and LPO levels in fish exposed to heat stress, and partially prevented the increase in muscle ROS levels. Diets containing nerolidol prevented the inhibition of muscle GPx activity in fish exposed to heat stress, and partially prevented the decrease of plasma GPx activity. The nerolidol-supplemented diet prevented the increase of fillet SFA in fish exposed to heat stress, while partially preventing the decrease of PUFA. We conclude that acute heat stress at 34 degrees C for 72 h causes plasma and muscular oxidative damage, and that homeoviscous adaptation to maintain membrane fluidity can represent a negative impact for fish consumers. A nerolidol diet can be considered a strategy to prevent heat stress-induced oxidative damage and impairment of muscle fatty acid profiles.",2021,99,NA,NA

Our study aims to provide information on the pest biology as influenced by temperature, determine thermal thresholds, and provide life table parameters for M. leuconotus reared in the laboratory. The life cycle of M. leuconotus was studied at seven constant temperatures in the range 15-35 degrees C, with 80 +/- 5\% RH and a photoperiod of L:D 12:12. Linear and nonlinear models were fitted to laboratory data to describe the impact of temperature on M. leuconotus development, mortality, fecundity and senescence. The complete life cycle was obtained between 18 and 30 degrees C, with the egg incubation period ranging 10.8-29.2 days. The development time was longest for the larva, with 194.2 days at 30 degrees C and 543.1 days at 18 degrees C. The minimum temperature threshold (T-min) was estimated at 10.7, 10.0 and 11.5 degrees C, for egg, larva and pupa, respectively. The maximum temperature threshold (T-max) was estimated at 37.4, 40.6 and 40.0 degrees C for egg, larva and pupa, respectively. The optimum temperature for immature stage survival was estimated between 23.0 and 23.9 degrees C. The highest fecundity was 97.8 eggs per female at 23 degrees C. Simulated life table parameters showed the highest net reproductive rate (R-0) of 11.8 daughters per female at 26 degrees C and maximal intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) between 26 and 28 degrees C, with a value of 0.008. Our results will help understanding M. leuconotus biology as influenced by temperature and may be used to predict the distribution and infestation risk under climate warming for this critical coffee pest.",2020,89,NA,NA
The use of internal heart rate loggers in determining cardiac breakpoints of fish,"Skeeles, Michael R. and Winkler, Alexander C. and Duncan, I, Murray and James, Nicola C. and van der Walt, Kerry-Ann and Potts, Warren M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102524,"As marine environments are influenced by global warming there is a need to thoroughly understand the relationship between physiological limits and temperature in fish. One quick screening method of a physiological thermal tipping point is the temperature at which maximum heart rate (f(Hmax)) can no longer scale predictably with warming and is referred to as the Arrhenius break temperature (T-AB). The use of this method has been successful for freshwater fish by using external electrodes to detect an electrocardiogram (ECG), however, the properties of this equipment pose challenges in salt water when evaluating marine fish. To overcome these challenges, this study aimed to explore the potential use of implantable heart rate loggers to quantify the T-AB of Chrysoblephus laticeps, a marine Sparid, following the ECG method protocols where f(Hmax) is monitored over an acute warming event and the T-AB is subsequently identified using a piece-wise linear regression model. Of the nine experimental fish, only five (56\%) returned accurate f(Hmax) data. The T-AB of successful trials was identified each time and ranged from 18.09 to 20.10 degrees C. This study therefore provides evidence that implantable heart rate loggers can estimate TAB of fish which can be applied to many marine species.",2020,89,NA,NA
The effects of fasting on swimming performance in juvenile qingbo (<i>Spinibarbus sinensis</i>) at two temperatures,"Pang, Xu and Yuan, Xing-Zhong and Cao, Zhen-Dong and Fu, Shi-Jian",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2014.02.014,"We measured the following variables to investigate the effects of fasting and temperature on swimming performance in juvenile qingbo (Spinibarbus sinensis): the critical swimming speed (U-ciit), resting metabolic rate (MO2rest) and active metabolic rate(MO2,(active),) of fish fasting for 0 (control), 1, 2 and 4 weeks at low and high acclimation temperatures (15 and 25 degrees C). Both fasting treatment and temperature acclimation had significant effects on all parameters measured (P < 0.05). Fasting at the higher temperature had a negative effect on all measured parameters after 1 week (P < 0.05). However,. when acclimated to the lower temperature, fasting had a negative effect on {[}Ark until week 2 and on (MO2rest), (MO2active) and metabolic scope (MS, (MO2active) (MO2rest)) until week 4 (P < 0.05). The values of all parameters at the lower temperature were significantly lower than those at the higher temperature in the identical fasting period groups except for (MO2rest) of the fish that fasted for 2 weeks. The relationship between fasting time (T) and U-crit was described as U-crit(15)= 0.302T(2) 0.800T+35.877 (r=0.781, n=32, P< 0.001) and Ucrit (25)=0.471T(2) 3.781T+ 50.097 (r=0.766, n=32, P < 0.001) at 15 and 25 degrees C, respectively. The swimming performance showed less decrease in the early stage of fasting but more decrease in the later stage at the low temperature compared to the high temperature, which might be related to thermal acclimation time, resting metabolism, respiratory capacity, energy stores, enzyme activity in muscle tissue and energy substrate utilization changes with fasting between low and high temperatures. The divergent response of the swimming performance to fasting in qingbo at different temperatures might be an adaptive strategy to seasonal temperature and food resource variation in their habitat.

Differential effects of parental and developmental temperatures on larval thermal adaptation in oviparous and viviparous model fish species,"Xia, Jigang and Deng, Chuke and Zheng, Xueli and Huang, Yan and Elvidge, Chris K. and Fu, Shijian",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103695,"Phenotypic plasticity has been identified as a major mechanism of response to changing temperatures. Parental effects are potentially important drivers of ecological and evolutionary dynamics, while developmental plasticity also plays a key role in generating phenotypic variation. However, little is known of the interaction between parental effects and developmental plasticity on the thermal phenotypes of fishes with different reproductive modes (i.e. oviparous vs. viviparous). To understand the contributions of inter-and intra-generational plasticity of thermal phenotypes (preferred temperature, avoidance temperatures, critical thermal thresholds) in fishes with different reproductive modes, we carried out a factorial experiment in which both breeding parents and offspring were exposed to lower (22 degrees C) or higher (28 degrees C) temperatures, using zebrafish (Danio rerio) and guppies (Poecilia reticulata) as representative oviparous and viviparous species. We found that offspring thermal preference and avoidance of both species were significantly influenced by parental effects and developmental plasticity, with higher thermal preference and avoidance consistent with higher background (parental) temperature treatments. However, parental effects were only found to impose significant effect on the thermal tolerances of guppies. The findings suggest that phenotypic plasticity, both within and across generations, may be an important mechanism to adapt to rapid climate changes, and that future temperature fluctuations may impose more profound effects on viviparous fish species in general.",2023,117,NA,NA
Potential for urban warming to postpone overwintering dormancy of temperate mosquitoes,"Fyie, Lydia R. and Tronetti, Hannah R. and Gardiner, Mary M. and Meuti, Megan E.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103594,"Cities are generally hotter than surrounding rural areas due to the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. These increases in temperature advance plant and animal phenology, development, and reproduction in the spring. However, research determining how increased temperatures affect the seasonal physiology of animals in the fall has been limited. The Northern house mosquito, Culex pipiens, is abundant in cities and transmits several pathogens including West Nile virus. Females of this species enter a state of developmental arrest, or reproductive diapause, in response to short days and low temperatures during autumn. Diapausing females halt reproduction and blood-feeding, and instead accumulate fat and seek sheltered overwintering sites. We found that exposure to increased temperatures in the lab that mimic the UHI effect induced ovarian development and blood-feeding, and that females exposed to these temperatures were as fecund as non-diapausing mosquitoes. We also found that females exposed to higher temperatures had lower survival rates in winter-like conditions, despite having accumulated equivalent lipid reserves relative to their diapausing congeners. These data suggest that urban warming may inhibit diapause initiation in the autumn, thereby extending the active biting season of temperate mosquitoes.",2023,115,NA,NA

The objective of this investigation was to evaluate thermo-adaptability between Tharparkar calves (TC), an indige-nous milch breed of India and crossbred calves (CC) during induced heat stress in controlled environment. For this purpose, 12 apparently healthy male calves (six in each group) aged 5-6 months, were selected. The experiment was conducted at physiologically comfortable temperature (25 degrees C), moderate HS (31 degrees C) and severe HS (37 degrees C) for 21 days each in a psychrometric chamber. In each experimental day, the calves were exposed to 6 h of heat. There were 7 days of acclimatization period before experiment and 10 days of recovery period at ambient temperature between each 21 day exposure period. During experimental period, the blood was collected at 1st, 6th, 11th, 16th, 21st day and among ten-day recovery period the blood was collected at 5th day. Physio-logical responses, serum electrolytes, metabolic enzymes profiles, antioxidant capacity, oxidative stress status and general endocrine milieu were studied. Relative mRNA expression study of Heat Shock Protein (HSP) 70, HSP90, induced Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS) were carried out by qPCR. There was significant (p < 0.05) change in the displacement in rectal temperature, respiration rate, serum alanine aminotransferase level between two breeds at moderate and severe HS. Similar change was observed in total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase, and endocrinological parameters. The comparatively lower mRNA expression of HSP70 and higher expression of HSP90 in TC than CC point the better thermo-adaptability of the same. The results of the experiment indicated that TC are more thermo-adaptable than CC at different modality of stress in controlled temperature conditions.",2022,110,NA,NA
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in genes related to oxidative stress and ion channels in chickens are associated with semen quality and hormonal responses to thermal stress,"Zhuang, Zi-Xuan and Chen, Shuen-Ei and Chen, Chih-Feng and Lin, En-Chung and Huang, San-Yuan",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103220,"Heat stress causes economic loss of livestock industry in tropical areas. Exploring genetic markers for selection of thermotolerance will benefit chicken production. Oxidative stress and fluid-salt balance are tightly associated with thermotolerance and productivity in domestic animals. The study aimed to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to oxidative stress and ion-channel regulation and their associations with semen quality and hormonal responses. In total, 28 SNPs within 11 candidate genes were identified to associate with hormonal changes and semen quality in both broiler-and layer-type Taiwan country chickens (TCCs) after exposure to acute heat stress at 38 C for 4 h. Acute heat stress significantly affected plasma levels of triiodothyronine and corticosterone and reduced sperm motility, viability, and concentrations in both strains at Day 1 after exposure. In the B-strain TCCs, five SNPs within NDUFA8 and DAB2IP had significant effects on plasma adrenaline and corticosterone levels, and six SNPs within TRPC1, SLC9A9, and TRPC7 markedly affected plasma corticosterone and triiodothyronine levels. In the L2 strain, 15 SNPs within PSMA2, TPK1, MTF1, and CUL1 exerted effects on plasma corticosterone and triiodothyronine levels. Five SNPs within CUL3, TRPC1, and SLC9A9 in the B strain and two SNPs within MTF1 in the L2 strain were associated with sperm concentrations at Day 1 after exposure to heat stress. In conclusion, acute heat stress impaired semen quality and altered plasma corticosterone and triiodothyronine levels in TCCs. Some SNPs involved in oxidative stress and ion-channel regulation were identified to associate with the hormonal and semen alterations. These SNPs in conjunction with differential hormonal responses and semen quality serve as genetic markers for thermotolerance selection in sire lines of chickens.",2022,105,NA,NA

A total of 162 yellow feather broilers that were 42 d of age were selected and randomly divided into three groups: the control group (CONT, CP 16\%), heat stress group (HS, CP 16\%), and heat stress with low protein and high amino acid group (HS\_LP, CP 14.5\%). Following 14 d heating stress period, the HS\_LP group showed no significant effect on production performance compared with the HS group. After a 28 d feeding trial, compared with the HS group, the HS\_LP group significantly reduced feed: gain at 15-28 d (P < 0.05), had a tendency to reduce feed: gain at 1-28 d (P = 0.056). Compared with the HS group, the serum catalase enzyme activity tended to be higher (P = 0.067), and liver glutathione peroxidase enzyme activity was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in the HS\_LP group. Other antioxidant capacity indexes were not significantly different between the two groups (P > 0.05). Duodenum (P < 0.05) and ileum (P < 0.05) villus height were significantly increased, duodenum villus height: crypt depth ratio (P < 0.05) and jejunum crypt depth (P < 0.05) were significantly decreased, and jejunum villus height was significantly reduced (P < 0.05) in broilers fed the HS\_LP diet.

In this study we determined the relationship between temperature and development, survival and reproductive parameters of B. dorsalis on an artificial diet under laboratory conditions under 7 constant temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 33 and 35 degrees C) with 70 +/- 10\% relative humidity and a photoperiod of L12:D12. We validated the laboratory results with a full life table analysis under semi-natural conditions in a screenhouse. We used the Insect Life Cycle Modeling (ILCYM) software for all mathematical models and simulations applied to all life history parameters. Bactrocera dorsalis completed its development at temperatures ranging between 15 and 33 degrees C with the mean developmental time of egg, larva, and pupa ranging between 1.46 and 4.31 days, 7.14-25.67 days, and 7.18-31.50 respectively. The models predicted temperatures ranging between 20 and 30 degrees C as favorable for development and survival, and 20 to 25 degrees C for optimal fecundity of B. dorsalis. Life table parameters showed the highest gross reproductive rate (GRR), net reproductive rate (R-o), intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)), and finite rate of increase (lambda) between 25 and 31 degrees C while generation time (T) and doubling time (D-t) were low at this interval.

Transcriptomic and biochemical effects of pycnogenol in ameliorating heat stress-related oxidative alterations in rats,"Atta, Mustafa S. and Farrag, Foad A. and Almadaly, Essam A. and Ghoneim, Hanan A. and Hafez, Ahmed S. and Al Jaouni, Soad K. and Mousa, Shaker A. and El-Far, Ali H.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102683,"Background: Heat stress is a condition that is due to extreme heat exposure. It occurs when the body cannot keep its temperature healthy in response to a hot climate and associated with oxidative stress. Testicular hyperthermia can induce apoptosis of sperm cells, affect sperm production and decrease sperm concentration, leading to sperm disorder, for this reason, we examined the protective impact of pycnogenol that it has a wide range of biological benefits, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities against the oxidative alterations that happen in testicular and brain tissues due to heat stress in rats. Study design: Forty-eight Wistar male rats, approximately around 6 weeks age were allocated randomly into four groups (12 in each) of control, HS (subjected to heat stress and supplemented orally with 50 mg of pycnogenol/kg b. w./day dissolved in saline for 21 days), and pycnogenol (rats supplemented orally with 50 mg of pycnogenol/kg b. w./day dissolved in saline for 21 days). Results: Data revealed a promising role of pycnogenol as an antioxidant, natural product to successfully reverse the heat-induced oxidative alterations in testicular and brain tissues of rats through significant upregulation of superoxide dismutase-2, catalase, reduced glutathione, and anti-apoptotic gene, while downregulating proapoptotic, and heat shock protein70.

To occur in different regions where ambient temperature varies, animals must adopt appropriate thermoregulatory mechanisms. Failure to adjust to environmental challenges may result in species distributional range shifts or decreased viability. African mole-rats (Bathyergidae) occupy various habitats in sub-Saharan Africa from deserts to montane regions to mesic coastal areas. We examined thermoregulatory characteristics of three African molerat species originating from disparate (montane, savannah, and arid/semi-arid) habitats. Animals were exposed to various ambient temperatures, whilst core body temperature and the surface temperature of different body parts were measured. Oxygen consumption was determined as a measure of heat production. Core body temperatures of Natal (montane) mole-rats (Cryptomys hottentotus natalensis) increased significantly at ambient temperatures >24.5 degrees C, while those of the highveld (Cryptomys hottentotus pretoriae) (savannah) and Damaraland (Fukomys damarensis) (arid/semi-arid) mole-rats remained within narrower ranges. In terms of surface temperature variation, while pedal surfaces were important in regulating heat loss in Natal and Damaraland mole-rats at high ambient temperatures, the ventral surface was important for heat dissipation in Damaraland and highveld mole-rats. This study provides evidence of the variation and limitations of thermo-physiological mechanisms for three mole-rat species relative to their habitats.

Laboratory based studies investigating the mechanisms of thermoregulation in marine ectotherms, however, rarely consider key temporal elements of thermal exposure, such as the rate at which temperature changes. We tested the hypothesis that juvenile seahorses, Hippocampus erectus, from a tropical coastal lagoon in Yucatan, Mexico, would exhibit variations in physiological and behavioural descriptors of thermoregulation when submitted to contrasting regimes during 30 days: temperature constant at 25 degrees C (C 25); gradually increasing 1 degrees C every 5 days from 25 to 30 degrees C (GI 25-30); and constant at 30 degrees C (C 30). Immediately after exposure, critical maximum temperature, thermal preference, oxygen consumption, partial energy balance, growth rate and survival of seahorses were measured. Seahorses exposed to GI 25-30 showed a significantly higher critical thermal maxima (37.8 +/- 0.9 degrees C), preference (28.7 +/- 0.4 degrees C), growth (1.10 +/- 0.49\%) and survival (97.6\%) than those exposed to C 30 (36.5 +/- 1, 29.4 +/- 0.3 degrees C, 0.48 +/- 0.32\%, 73.8\%, respectively). Both high temperature regimes induced metabolic depression, but ramping resulted in a greater amount of energy assimilated (278.9 +/- 175.4 J g(-1) day(-1)) and higher energy efficiency for growth (89.8\%) than constant exposure to 30 degrees C (115.4 +/- 63.4 J g (-1) day(-1), 65.3\%, respectively). Gradually increasing temperature allowed physiological mechanisms of thermal adjustment to take place, reflecting the capacity of juvenile H. erectus to respond to environmental change. Despite its advantage, this capacity is limited in time, since the cumulative effect of thermal exposure affected metabolic performance, eventually compromising survival. The study of seahorse response to thermal variations in the context of ocean warming needs to consider the temporal elements of thermal exposure to foresee its vulnerability under future scenarios.",2019,85,NA,NA
"Plasticity in reproductive output and development in response to thermal variation in ladybird beetle, <i>Menochilus sexmaculatus</i>","Singh, Shashwat and Mishra, Geetanjali and Omkar",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.11.010,"All organisms are exposed to daily as well as seasonal variation in temperature in nature. However, ectotherms are strongly affected by temperature and its variations. Most laboratory studies on effect of temperature on life history traits employ constant instead of fluctuating temperature regimes, though the latter is more reflective of nature. We conducted investigations on the effect of constant, fluctuating and alternate temperature regimes on reproductive and developmental attributes of a biocontrol agent ladybird, Menochilus sexmaculatus (Fabricius) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). We used three constant, viz. cold, optimum and hot (15 degrees C, 27 degrees C and 35 degrees C); two fluctuating with variation in mean temperature of the day (15 degrees C/27 degrees C, 35 degrees C /27 degrees C; 10/14 h) and three alternating (15 degrees C/27 degrees C, 35 degrees C/27 C, 15 degrees C/35 degrees C; 24/24 h) temperatures to evaluate their effects on these life attributes. Oviposition and percent egg viability along with offspring development (immature life stages developmental time and developmental rate) and elytral colouration pattern of adults were observed. The best response in terms of oviposition and percent egg viability was recorded at the constant temperature of 27 degrees C followed by the fluctuating regime with a mean temperature of 30.3 degrees C. The fastest development was found at a constant temperature of 35 degrees C, followed by a fluctuating temperature of 35 degrees C/27 degrees C for 10/14 h. Among the different temperature cycles, the most uncustomary trend of oviposition and percent egg viability was recorded on an alternate temperature of 15 degrees C/35 degrees C for 24/24 h. The constant (27 degrees C) and fluctuating (35 degrees C/27 C for 10/14 h) temperatures caused an incremental effect on reproductive output and developmental rate. This study demonstrates that M. sexmaculatus is able to adjust its physiology according to surrounding environmental conditions and acclimatizes well with the fluctuating/alternate temperatures suggesting its wide range of tolerance. The findings of present work would be helpful in augmenting population dynamics of this biocontrol agent to suppress insect pest.",2018,71,NA,180-188
A stringent test of the thermal coadaptation hypothesis in flour beetles,"Halliday, William D. and Blouin-Demers, Gabriel",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2015.06.002,"Whole-organism performance depends on body temperature and ectotherms have variable body temperatures. The thermal coadaptation hypothesis posits that thermal reaction norms have coevolved with thermal preference such that organisms attain optimal performance under a narrow range of body temperatures commonly experienced in the wild. Since thermal reaction norms are often similar, researchers interested in the effects of temperature on fitness often use one easily measured thermal reaction norm, such as locomotor performance, and assume it is a good proxy for fitness when testing the thermal coadaptation hypothesis. The extent to which this assumption holds, however, is often untested. In this study, we provide a stringent test of the thermal coadaptation hypothesis in red and in confused flour beetles by comparing the thermal reaction norm for reproductive output to the preferred body temperature range. We also test the assumption that locomotor performance can serve as a proxy for the thermal reaction norm for reproductive output, a more ultimate index of fitness. In both species, we measured the number of eggs laid, righting time, and sprint speed at eight temperatures, as well as the thermal preference in a thermal gradient. The number of eggs laid increased with female sprint speed and with male righting time, and all three performances had similar thermal reaction norms, with 80\% of the maximum achieved between 23 and 37 degrees C. Red flour beetles had preferred body temperatures that matched the optimal temperature for performance; confused flour beetles had lower preferred body temperature than the optimal temperature for performance. We found support for the assumption that locomotor performance can serve as a proxy for reproductive output in flour beetles, but we only found evidence for thermal coadaptation in one of the two species.

"Heat hardening improves thermal tolerance in abalone, without the trade-offs associated with chronic heat exposure","Abbas, Ahmed S. A. and Collins, Michael and Ellis, Robert and Spicer, John I. and Truebano, Manuela",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103963,"Marine animals are challenged by chronically raised temperatures alongside an increased frequency of discrete, severe warming events. Exposure to repeated heat shocks could result in heat hardening, where sub-lethal exposure to thermal stress temporarily enhances thermotolerance, and may be an important mechanism by which marine species will cope with future thermal challenges. However, we have relatively little understanding of the effects of heat hardening in comparison to chronic exposure to elevated temperatures. Therefore, we compared the effects of heat hardening from repeated exposure to acute heat shocks and chronic exposure to elevated temperatures on thermal tolerance in the European abalone, Haliotis tuberculata. Adult abalones were exposed to either control temperature (15 degrees C), chronic warming (20 degrees C) or a regime of two events of repeated acute heat shock cycles (23-25 degrees C) during six months, and their thermal tolerance and performance, based upon cardiac activity, compared using a dynamic ramping assay. The cost associated with each treatment was also estimated via measurements of condition index (CI). Abalone exposed to both temperature treatments had higher upper thermal limits than the control, but heat-hardened individuals had significantly higher CI values, indicating an enhancement in condition status. Differences in the shape of the thermal performance curve suggest different mechanisms may be at play under different temperature exposure treatments. We conclude that heat hardening can boost thermal tolerance in this species, without performance trade-offs associated with chronic warming.",2024,124,NA,NA
Effects of warming at embryonic and larval stages on tadpole fitness in high-altitude<i> Rana kukunoris</i>,"Niu, Zhiyi and Pu, Peng and Zhang, Tao and Jia, Lun and Li, Xinying and Wang, Huihui and Ma, Miaojun and Tang, Xiaolong and Chen, Qiang",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103895,"Global warming may affect the early developmental stages of high-altitude amphibians, thereby influencing their later fitness. Yet, this has been largely unexplored. To investigate whether and how the temperatures experienced by embryonic and larval stages affect their fitness at later developmental stages, we designed two experiments in which the embryos and larvae were treated with three temperatures (24, 18 and 12 degrees C), respectively. Then, the life history traits of the tadpoles during the metamorphotic climax in all treatments were evaluated, including growth rate, survival rate, morphology, thermal physiology, swimming performance, standard metabolic rate (SMR), oxidative and antioxidative system, and metabolic enzyme activities. The results revealed that elevated temperature accelerated metamorphosis but decreased body size at metamorphosis. Additionally, warming during the embryonic and larval stages decreased the thermal tolerance range and induced increased oxidative stress. Furthermore, high embryonic temperature significantly decreased the hatching success, but had no significant effect on swimming performance and SMR. Warming during larval periods was harmful to the survival and swimming performance of tadpoles. The effect size analysis revealed that the negative impacts of embryonic temperature on certain physiological traits, such as growth and development, survival and swimming performance, were more pronounced than those of larval temperature. Our results highlight the necessity for particular attention to be paid to the early stages of amphibians, notably the embryonic stages when evaluating the impact of global warming on their survival.",2024,123,NA,NA
Life history responses of the small brown planthopper Laodelphax striatellus to temperature change,"Xiao, Lan and Huang, Li-Li and He, Hai-Min and Xue, Fang-Sen and Tang, Jian-Jun",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103626,"Temperature is a key environmental factor in ectotherms and influences many life history traits. In the present study, the nymphal development time, sex ratio and wing dimorphism of the small brown planthopper Laodelphax striatellus were examined under the conditions of constant temperatures, naturally varying temperatures (or different generations), and different temperatures combined with different photoperiod. The results showed that from 18 to 28 degrees C, the developmental time of nymphs was gradually shortened with the increase of temperature, whereas the high temperatures of 30 and 32 degrees C in the third to fifth instar nymphal stages and high summer temperature of 28.8 and 29.7 degrees C significantly delayed developmental time and resulted in higher mortality of nymphs. In all treatments, the developmental time was longer in females than males. The nymphs took significantly longer time to develop in the short daylength of 12 h than in longer daylengths of 13, 14, 15 and 16. Differences in developmental time were also found between wing morph, with long-winged individuals being significantly longer than the short-winged individuals at lower temperatures and significantly shorter than the short-winged individuals at higher temperatures. In all treatments, the sex ratio was stable, approaching 1:1, without being affected by temperature, generations and photoperiod. Photoperiod and temperature had significantly influence on the wing dimorphism. Long daylength combined with different temperatures resulted in significantly higher proportions of long-winged morph, whereas the low temperatures combined with the short daylengths in autumn and winter resulted in significantly high proportion of short-winged morph. This study broadens our understanding of the life-history traits of this planthopper and provides basic data for analyzing the effects of climate change on the planthopper reproduction.",2023,115,NA,NA
Capacity for thermal adaptation in Nile tilapia (<i>Oreochromis niloticus</i>)<i>:</i> Effects on oxygen uptake and ventilation,"Leonard, Jonas Ndau and Skov, Peter Vilhelm",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103206,"Standard metabolic rate (SMR) and maximum metabolic rate (MMR) were determined for Nile tilapia acclimated to six different experimental temperatures from 18 degrees C to 38 degrees C. SMR increased exponentially with temperature, from 79.8 mg O-2 kg(-1) h(-1) at 18 degrees C, to 255.1 mg O-2 kg(-1) h(-1) at 38 degrees C (Q(10) = 1.79). The main increase in Q(10) occurred within the highest temperature range, whereas in the lower temperature from 18 degrees C to 22 degrees C, temperature did not significantly affect SMR. MMR showed a hyperbolic correlation with increasing temperature, rising from 240.5 mg O-2 kg(-1) h(-1) at 18 degrees C to a peak of 373.8 mg O-2 kg(-1) h(-1) at 30 degrees C, before decreasing again at higher temperatures. Absolute aerobic scope (AAS) peaked at 26.0 degrees C, which we conclude to be the optimal temperature for Nile tilapia. The optimal temperature range, defined as the thermal range where 80\% or more of the metabolic scope (MS) can be maintained, occurred between 19.5 and 32.1 degrees C. The lower (TCMIN) and upper (TCMAX) critical temperatures occurred at 13.1 degrees C and 38.8 degrees C. Nile tilapia showed a 4-fold scope for increasing ventilation frequency from 24 opercular beats min(-1) (OB min(-1)) during SMR at 18 degrees C, to a maximum of 100 OB min(-1) which occurred during MMR at 34 degrees C. f(V) during MMR increased with temperature, but above 30 degrees C became uncoupled with MO2, as fish were unable to sustain their rates of oxygen consumption despite a high f(V). There was a strong correlation between f(V) and SMR (r(2) = 0.83) across all temperatures indicating that fV is a good predictor of SMR. However, the correlation between MMR and f(V) was weak (r(2) = 0.06), due to a strong interacting effect of temperature. When selecting data from the thermal optimum range, a good correlation between f(V) and MO2 was obtained (r(2) = 0.74).",2022,105,NA,NA
Concurrent changes in thermal tolerance thresholds and cellular heat stress response reveals novel molecular signatures and markers of high temperature acclimation in rainbow trout,"Pandey, Anupam and Rajesh, Manchi and Baral, Pratibha and Sarma, Debajit and Tripathi, Priyanka H. and Akhtar, Md Shahbaz and Ciji, Alexander and Dubey, Maneesh Kumar and Pande, Veena and Sharma, Prakash and Kamalam, Biju Sam",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103124,"The objective of this study was to better understand the molecular mechanisms which regulate acclimatory responses and thermal safety margins of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) at temperatures above physio-logical optimum. For this, we investigated the time course of changes in critical thermal tolerance thresholds and associated hepatic and renal transcript abundance of molecular markers related to cellular stress response, during high temperature acclimation. The experimental fish were initially acclimated to 17 degrees C and later exposed to a gradually raised elevated temperature regime (22 degrees C) for a period of 30 days. CTmax, CTmin and mRNA expression of candidate markers were examined before the thermal challenge (T0) and over the time-course (days) of high temperature exposure (T1, T3, T7, T15 and T30). With respect to organismal response, CTmax was significantly elevated at T3, but the degree of gain in heat tolerance was not persistent. Contrarily, we observed a gradual loss in cold tolerance with highest CTmin estimate at T30. Based on the time-course of mRNA expression, the studied markers could be categorized into those which were persistently elevated (hsp70a, hsp70b, hspa5, hsp90a, hsp90b, stip1 and serpinh1 in kidney and hsp90b in liver); those which concurred with changes in CTmin (hspbp1, hsp90b, stip1, gr1, hif1a, hyou1, tnfa and tlr5 in kidney); and those which concurred with changes in CTmax (hsp90a, serpinh1, tlr5 and lmo2 in liver). Apparently, transcriptional changes in kidney and liver reflected CTmin and CTmax trend, respectively. Expression profile of stip1 and tlr5 suggest that they are potential novel markers which could reflect thermal limits in rainbow trout. Hepatic metabolic markers were either initially elevated (alt, glud, g6pase1) or down-regulated at different time-points (ast2, gls1, fas, cpt1b, mtor), linked to gluconeogenesis and metabolic depression, respectively. Whereas, growth-axis markers showed no significant differences.

Modeling warming predicts a physiological threshold for the extinction of the living fossil frog <i>Calyptocephalella gayi</i>,"Vidal, Marcela A. and Novoa-Munoz, Francisco and Werner, Enrique and Torres, Cristian and Nova, Ricardo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.07.001,"Global climate change will have a greater impact on ectotherms in tropical and subtropical communities than at higher latitudes, because ambient temperatures are closer to the upper thermal limits of species. Amphibian species are highly dependent on external weather conditions, and the effect of global warming on these has been evaluated recently. The Great Chilean frog (Calyptocephalella gayi) is an endemic, monotypic species and genus whose conservation status is considered Vulnerable because of high extraction pressure for human consumption, lack of regulatory measures and comprehension by its consumers. Their populations have also declined due to the loss and destruction of their habitats. C. gayi has not been considered as an object of physiological study, so this large species is not known as one that can adapt to current environmental changes. In this study we analyze the thermoregulatory capacity and{''} thermal efficiency of C. gayi to determine its potential for climatic adaptation. The results indicate that this species is strictly a thermal-conformer; its thermal efficiency and its ability to withstand high temperatures allow it to sustain itself under a climate change scenario, however, it has thermal constraints that do not allow it to withstand temperatures greater than 30 degrees C. By modeling its ontogenetic conditions mathematically, we project that the larvae are not in danger, although there is a group of around 4\% which is very close to 30 degrees C, which is the highest temperature recorded for the species. However, about 40\% of subadults and approximately 47\% of adult frogs will not survive the change of 7 degrees C projected for the following 85 years, which will affect future generations.",2017,69,NA,110-117
The role of nest surface temperatures and the brain in influencing ant metabolic rates,"Andrew, Nigel R. and Ghaedi, Behnaz and Groenewald, Berlize",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.07.010,"Thermal limits of insects can be influenced by recent thermal history: here we used thermolimit respirometry to determine metabolic rate responses and thermal limits of the dominant meat ant, Ir-idomyrmex purpureus. Firstly, we tested the hypothesis that nest surface temperatures have a pervasive influence on thermal limits. Metabolic rates and activity of freshly field collected individuals were measured continuously while ramping temperatures from 44 degrees C to 62 degrees C at 0.25 degrees C/minute. At all the stages of thermolimit respirometry, metabolic rates were independent of nest surface temperatures, and CTmax did not differ between ants collected from nest with different surface temperatures. Secondly, we tested the effect of brain control on upper thermal limits of meat ants via ant decapitation experiments ('headedness'). Decapitated ants exhibited similar upper critical temperature (CTmax) results to living ants (Decapitated 503 +/- 1.2 degrees C: Living 50.1 +/- 1.8 degrees C). Throughout the temperature ramping process, `headedness' had a significant effect on metabolic rate in total (Decapitated (V) over dot CO2 140 +/- 30 mu l CO2 mg(-1) min(-1): Living (V) over dot CO2 250 +/- 50 CO2 mg(-1) min(-1)), as well as at temperatures below and above CTmax. At high temperatures (>44 degrees C) pre-CTmax the relationships between I. purpureus CTmax values and mass specific metabolic rates for living ants exhibited a negative slope whilst decapitated ants exhibited a positive slope. The decapitated ants also had a significantly higher Q(10):25-35 degrees C when compared to living ants (1.91 +/- 0.43 vs. 1.29 +/- 0.35). Our findings suggest that physiological responses of ants may be able to cope with increasing surface temperatures, as shown by metabolic rates across the thermolimit continuum, making them physiologically resilient to a rapidly changing climate. We also demonstrate that the brain plays a role in respiration, but critical thermal limits are independent of respiration levels. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2016,60,NA,132-139

All three organisms investigated follow the TSR, but only over a specific range between minimal and optimal temperatures, while maintenance at temperatures beyond this range showed the opposite pattern in these taxa. We consider minimal and optimal temperatures to be species-specific, and moreover delineate a physiological range outside of which an ectotherm is constrained against displaying size plasticity in response to temperature. This thermal range concept has important implications for general size-temperature studies. Furthermore, the concept of `operating thermal conditions' may provide a new approach to (i) defining criteria required for investigating and interpreting temperature effects, and (ii) providing a novel interpretation for many cases in which species do not conform to the TSR.

"Within the optimal thermal range, temperature fluctuations with similar means have little effect on offspring phenotypes: A comparison of two approaches that simulate natural nest conditions","Hall, Joshua M. and Tiatragul, Sarin and Turner, Mallory K. and Warner, Daniel A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103949,"Temperature influences nearly every aspect of organismal function. Because aspects of global change such as urbanization and climate change influence temperature, researchers must consider how altering thermal regimes will impact biodiversity across the planet. To do so, they often measure temperature in natural and/or human modified habitats, replicate those temperatures in laboratory experiments to understand organismal responses, and make predictions under models of future change. Consequently, accurately representing temperature in the laboratory is an important concern, yet few studies have assessed the consequences of simulating thermal conditions in different ways. We used nest temperatures for two urban-dwelling, invasive lizards (Anolis sagrei and A. cristatellus) to create two egg incubation treatments in the laboratory. Like most studies of thermal developmental plasticity, we created daily repeating thermal fluctuations; however, we used different methods to create temperature treatments that differed in the magnitude and breadth of thermal cycles, and then evaluated the effects of these different approaches on embryo development and hatchling phenotypes. Additionally, we measured embryo heart rate, a proxy for metabolism, across temperature to understand the immediate effects of treatments. We found that treatments had minimal effect on phenotypes likely because temperatures were within the optimal thermal range for each species and were similar in mean temperature. We conclude that slight differences in thermal treatments may be unimportant so long as temperatures are within a range appropriate for development, and we make several recommendations for future studies of developmental plasticity.",2024,125,NA,NA

G. cornutus males possess weapon traits for male-male combat and exhibit sexual size dimorphism in other morphological traits.

We conducted two experiments to assess heat stress in adult flies, one varying the intensity of the heat stress (daily heating from 4 degrees C to 8 degrees C, 20 degrees C, or 24 degrees C) and one varying the frequency of heat stress exposure (heating from 4 degrees C to 12 degrees C every one, two, or three days) and examined consequences for reproductive success and metabolic responses. We found that more heat stress reduced reproductive output, but not timing of reproduction. Surprisingly, individuals sampled at different times during heat stress exposure were undifferentiable when all metabolite concentrations were analysed with redundancy analysis, however some individual metabolites did exhibit significant differences. Overall, our findings suggest that warmer temperatures in the sub-Antarctic may put this species at greater risk, especially when combined with other concurrent threats from biological invasions.",2024,123,NA,NA

This study evaluated changes of circulating hemocytes in Apis mellifera hemolymph at different temperatures and development stages. Total hemocytes of bees were determined at -8, 16, 24, and 32 degrees C - and at different development stages-in vivo larvae, in vitro larvae, newly emerged, and forager bees. A. mellifera larvae had a greater number of circulating hemocytes compared to the other development stages (newly emerged and foragers). Additionally, temperature was an important factor explaining variation of circulating hemocytes in the hemolymph, according to principal component analyses (PCA), as the number of circulating hemocytes was greater at higher temperatures.

While the physiological and ecological consequences of predator exposure to high temperatures during summer low tides are increasingly well-studied, the effects of cold exposure during winter low tides remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we measured the supercooling points, survival, and feeding rates of three intertidal predator species in British Columbia, Canada - the sea stars Pisaster ochraceus and Evasterias troschelii and the dogwhelk Nucella lamellosa - in response to exposure to sub-zero air temperatures. Overall, we found that all three predators exhibited evidence of internal freezing at relatively mild sub-zero temperatures, with sea stars exhibiting an average supercooling point of -2.50 degrees C, and the dogwhelk averaging approximately -3.99 degrees C. None of the tested species are strongly freeze tolerant, as evidenced by moderate-to-low survival rates after exposure to -8 degrees C air. All three predators exhibited significantly reduced feeding rates over a two-week period following a single 3-h sublethal (-0.5 degrees C) exposure event. We also quantified variation in predator body temperature among thermal microhabitats during winter low tides. Predators that were found at the base of large boulders, on the sediment, and within crevices had higher body temperatures during winter low tides, as compared to those situated in other microhabitats. However, we did not find evidence of behavioural thermoregulation via selective microhabitat use during cold weather. Since these intertidal predators are less freeze tolerant than their preferred prey, winter low temperature exposures can have important implications for organism survival and predator-prey dynamics across thermal gradients at both local (habitat-driven) and geographic (climate-driven) scales.",2023,114,NA,NA
Negative effects of fluctuating temperatures around the optimal temperature on reproduction and survival of the red flour beetle,"Scharf, Inon and Segal, Daniella and Bar, Adi and Gottlieb, Daphna",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103165,"Whereas the vast majority of animals in nature experience daily or seasonal thermal fluctuations, most laboratory experiments use constant temperatures. We examined the effect of fluctuating temperatures on reproduction and survival under starvation, two important components of fitness. We used the red flour beetle as a model organism, which is a significant pest in grain mills around the world. Fluctuations around the optimal temperature were always negative for the adult survival under starvation. The effect of thermal fluctuations on the number of offspring reaching adulthood was negative as well but increased with the extent of exposure. It was the strongest when the adult parents were kept and the offspring were raised under fluctuating temperatures. However, the later the offspring were exposed to fluctuations during their development, the weaker the effect of fluctuating temperatures was. Moreover, raising the parents under fluctuating temperatures but keeping them after pupation at constant temperatures fully alleviated the negative effects of fluctuations on the offspring. Finally, we demonstrate that keeping the parents a few days under fluctuating temperatures is required to induce negative effects on the number of offspring reaching adulthood. Our study disentangles between the effects of thermal fluctuations experienced during the parental and offspring stage thus contributing to the ongoing research of insects under fluctuating temperatures.",2022,103,NA,NA

The relationship between temperature and insect development has long been recognized as an important environmental parameter in modeling insect population dynamics. Although few studies have investigated the existence of developmental rate polymorphism within a cohort, the role of abiotic and biotic factors on such developmental variation has so far been meagerly investigated. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of thermal extremes on the developmental rate polymorphism and its influence on reproductive potential of Parthenium beetle, Zygogramma bicolorata Pallister (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). The study will also be helpful in solving hitherto whether the existence of slow and fast developers within a cohort has a purely genetic basis or this developmental polymorphism is presided by environmental factors. Our result reveals a clear bimodal pattern of distribution with two peaks at each temperature (20, 25, 27, 30 and 35 degrees C) where the first peak represents the fast developers and second peak represents the slow developers. Both developmental variants took the longest duration for development at 20 degrees C followed by 25, 27, 30 degrees C and minimum at 35 degrees C. More fast developers were found at higher temperatures. Slow developing individuals were heavier than the fast developing individuals regardless of rearing temperature. Slow developers have higher reproductive success in terms of fecundity and egg viability than the fast developers. The results of this study denote the constancy of the developmental rate polymorphism within a cohort and the possibility that this polymorphism was owing to the exogenous cues inclined differential rates of mortality.",2021,100,NA,NA

Better growth performance was observed under variable treatment compared to stable treatments. However, fish under the 27 degrees C treatment exhibited much weaker growth performance than those in the 17 degrees C treatment. Fish under variation temperature treatment fed like those under 22 degrees C treatment; the fish exhibited similar SGR but a higher gh and hsp70 level under variation temperature treatment.

Ten primiparous sows were randomly assigned to thermoneutral (TN) (18?22 ?C; n = 5) or heat stress (HS) (28?32 ?C; n = 5) treatments. Posture transitioning, including the frequency of posture change, duration of dynamic posture (DP), and lateral lying with udder to the piglet creep box (PCB) during three periods (72 h prepartum, sub-partum, and 24 h postpartum, respectively), were recorded. Posture change frequency was significantly increased, starting from 24 h prepartum to the onset of farrowing in both the TN (P < 0.05) and HS (P < 0.01) groups. Moreover, the peak value of posture change frequency in the TN group was concentrated during the 12 h prepartum period, positively correlated with the quantities of head-first birth piglets and subpartum duration, respectively. DP duration increased during the period of 24 h prepartum and then decreased sharply (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05 for TN and HS groups, respectively). The duration of facing the udder to the PCB increased during sub-partum and postpartum TN (P < 0.001). The duration of sub-partum (P < 0.05) and delivery time of single piglets (P < 0.01) in the HS group was prolonged, and piglets from the HS group had a lower weight gain than the TN group both at d10 (P < 0.001) and weaning time (P < 0.001).

"How do outside-hosts-overwintering parasitoids, at the adult stage, cope with cold?","D'Ottavio, Marie and Labrie, Genevieve and Lucas, Eric",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103940,"Introduction: When overwintering, most endoparasitoids are protected from the cold inside their hosts. However, some endoparasitoids, along with ectoparasitoids, fall into the category called outside-hosts-overwintering parasitoids (OHOP) at immature or adult stages. We compared the cold-hardiness capacity and strategy between adult OHOP and their hosts (HOST) by examining their supercooling points (SCP), with acclimation periods and acclimation temperatures, and their lower lethal temperatures at 50\% mortality (LLT50). We hypothesized that OHOP are more cold-hardy than their HOST, with lower SCP and LLT50. Materials and methods: Throughout the summers of 2020, 2021, and 2022, adult cabbage seedpod weevils (HOST) were sampled with a sweep net at the canola pod stage, and thousands of pods were collected and placed in emergence boxes to retrieve the adult OHOP Trichomalus perfectus. Regarding SCP measures, OHOP and HOST were separated according to various treatments. Each treatment considered a target exposure temperature (5, 10, or 20 degrees C) or a target exposure period (5, 15 or 25 days) at 5 degrees C. Regarding LLT measures, OHOP and HOST were categorized into five treatments, each corresponding to a specific exposure temperature (-5, -10, -15, -20 or -25 degrees C). Results and conclusion: Acclimations to a lower temperature (5 degrees C) and a longer period (25 days) led to a significantly lower SCP of OHOP than HOST. Regarding OHOP, the average SCP was -19.71 degrees C when the acclimation temperature was 20 degrees C and significantly decreased to -23.20 degrees C when it was 5 degrees C. The average SCP was -18.82 degrees C when the acclimation period was five days and significantly decreased to -23.20 degrees C when it was 25 days. Conversely, the average SCP for HOST was never below -20 degrees C. At 20 degrees C acclimation temperature, HOST exhibited a significantly higher SCP of -14.64 degrees C compared to acclimations at 5 degrees C (-19.19 degrees C) and 10 degrees C (-20.00 degrees C), but there were no significant differences between 5 and 10 degrees C nor between acclimation periods. Therefore, the adult OHOP is more cold-hardy than its HOST. OHOP also exhibited a lower LLT50 than HOST, with -19.20 degrees C versus -17.59 degrees C. Finally, OHOP and HOST employ the same freeze-avoidance strategy, as evidenced by their SCP values (-19.57 degrees C versus -16.80 degrees C) which closely align with their respective LLT50. Adult OHOP better survive winter than their HOST in cold environments.",2024,124,NA,NA
Phenotypic plasticity and thermal efficiency of temperature responses in two conspecific springtail populations from contrasting climates,"Sengupta, Sagnik and Leinaas, Hans Petter",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103914,"Temperature drives adaptation in life-history traits through direct effects on physiological processes. However, multiple life-history traits co-evolve as a life-history strategy. Therefore, physiological limitations constraining the evolution of trait means and phenotypic plasticity can be larger for some traits than the others. Comparisons of thermal responses across life-history traits can improve our understanding of the mechanisms determining the life-history strategies. In the present study, we focused on a soil microarthropod species abundant across the Northern Hemisphere, Folsomia quadrioculata (Collembola), with previously known effects of macroclimate. We selected an arctic and a temperate population from areas with highly contrasting climates - the arctic tundra and a coniferous forest floor, respectively - and compared them for thermal plasticity and thermal efficiency in growth, development, fecundity, and survival across four temperatures for a major part of their life cycle. We intended to understand the mechanisms by which temperature drives the evolution of life-history strategies. We found that the temperate population maximized performance at 10-15 degrees C, whereas the arctic population maintained its thermal efficiency across a wider temperature range (10-20 degrees C). Thermal plasticity varied in a trait-specific manner, and when considered together with differences in thermal efficiency, indicated that stochasticity in temperature conditions may be important in shaping the life-history strategies. Our study suggests that adopting a whole-organism approach and including physiological time considerations while analysing thermal adaptation will markedly improve our understanding of plausible links between thermal adaptation and responses to global climate change.",2024,123,NA,NA
Feeling the heat: Bumblebee workers show no acclimation capacity of upper thermal tolerance to simulated heatwaves,"Sepulveda, Yanet and Goulson, Dave",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103672,"Climate change is our most significant challenge in the 21st century and among the main drivers of biodiversity loss. Recent distributional shifts and declines in crucial pollinators, such as bumblebees, seem to be associated to this phenomenon. However, despite future climate projections on climate warming, few studies have assessed the ability of temperate bumblebees to acclimate to extreme weather events, such as heatwaves. This study estimates the upper critical thermal limits (Critical Thermal Maximum (CTmax) and Heat Coma Temperature (HCT)), of the bumblebee subspecies Bombus terrestris audax, and assesses whether CTmax increases following exposure to a simulated heatwave. The critical thermal maximum occurred between 48.9 and 52.7 degrees C, while the heat coma temperature varied between 50.7 and 53.4 degrees C. After measurement of HCT, around 23\% of bees survived 24 h or longer, but coordination was never recovered. There was no significant association between upper critical thermal limits and body mass, which highlights the need to investigate other factors to comprehend the mechanisms behind thermal tolerance limits. Furthermore, the heatwave treatments had no significant effect on the CTmax of bumblebee workers, indicating no acclimation capacity of upper thermal tolerance to simulated heatwaves. Our study provides insights into the upper thermal tolerance limits of Bombus terrestris audax and reveals that exposure to heatwave-like events does not change the upper thermal tolerance of bees, highlighting the need to develop effective strategies that might enable them to cope with extreme weather events.",2023,116,NA,NA
Dietary supplementation with chia polyphenols alleviates oxidative stress and improves egg nutritional quality in Japanese quails under heat stress,"Mas, Agustin Lucini and Bonansea, Rocio Ines and Fernandez, Maria Emilia and Kembro, Jackelyn Melissa and Labaque, Maria Carla and Wunderlin, Daniel Alberto and Baroni, Maria Veronica",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103421,"Heat stress in poultry is a major concern, especially in regions with hot summers and scarce cooling infrastructure. Dietary supplementation with antioxidants, such as polyphenols, has risen as a strategy to mitigate the physiological consequences of heat stress. A by-product of the extraction of oil from chia seeds, which is discarded if not used, could be a possible source of polyphenols. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of dietary supplementation with polyphenols from defatted chia seed cake on the general performance, and oxidative status of Japanese quail exposed to heat stress. Furthermore, productive performance, egg quality and yolk fatty acid composition were also assessed. A total of 36 females (96 days of age) were randomly assigned to different diets: BASAL (control), LDCP (low dose of chia polyphenols), or HDCP (high dose of chia polyphenols). Half the animals in each diet group were exposed to 34 degrees C for 9 h a day (Heat Stress; HS), while the other half remained at the standard 24 degrees C (No Heat Stress; NHS). After 23 days of experimental conditions, animals under HS showed higher body temperatures and time spent panting, but lower egg laying rate. Moreover, HS modulated the activity of catalase and glutathione peroxidase enzymes, increasing lipid peroxidation in serum and liver; and increased saturated fatty acids in egg yolk. Supplementation with chia polyphenols helped to mitigate the HS effects, especially on glutathione peroxidase activity, decreasing lipid peroxidation. In addition, supplementation with HDCP showed the highest proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids in liver and egg yolk. In conclusion, the use of defatted chia seed cake could represent a sustainable strategy to mitigate heat stress effects on Japanese quail, due to its capacity to decrease oxidative stress and improve the nutritional quality of egg, while decreasing the amount of waste generated by the food industry.",2023,111,NA,NA
Age matters: Differential effects of the exposure to elevated environmental temperatures on representative variables of the immune system in juvenile and adult female Japanese quail,"Videla, Emiliano A. and Tortone, Stefano M. and Marin, Raul H. and Nazar, F. Nicolas",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103257,"Several days under the influence of high environmental temperature negatively impact on some immune-related variables of poultry species. However, it is little known whether this exposure affects differentially the immune response on different life stages. This study was aimed at characterizing the immune responses of juvenile and adult female Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix) when exposed to a cyclic chronic heat stressor. Independent sets of juvenile (24) and adult (21) female Japanese quail were bred under thermoneutral conditions or exposed to an increasing temperature from 24 degrees C to 34 degrees C, for 8 h along nine consecutive days (chronic heat stressor). The inflammatory response against a mitogen, the antibody production against a non-pathogenic antigen and the heterophil to lymphocyte (H/L) ratio were measured after the ninth day of chronic heat exposure. Adult females had a more robust inflammatory response compared to their juvenile counterpart. The inflammatory response, the production of antibodies, and the H/L ratio were suppressed by the chronic heat stressor in the juvenile females; while in their adult counterpart, the production of antibodies was not affected by the chronic heat stress. Under the exposure of high environmental temperatures, juvenile females would be more susceptible to potentially harmful pathogens that require a robust immune response, while their adult counterparts would be able to mount an optimal acquired immune response against pathogens requiring this type of response. Our findings suggest that while heat stress during breeding should be avoided in both juvenile and adult females, more precautions should be taken during early life stages.",2022,107,NA,NA
Rise in temperature causes decreased fitness and higher extinction risks in endemic frogs at high altitude forested wetlands in northern Pakistan,"Saeed, Muhammad and Rais, Muhammad and Gray, Russell J. and Ahmed, Waseem and Akram, Ayesha and Gill, Sumbul and Fareed, Ghulam",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102809,"The larvae of some amphibian species grow and develop more slowly at lower temperature and attain larger body size at the end of metamorphosis, but this is not true for all amphibians. We have for the first time provided empirical data by using a combination of field and lab-based studies with a robust sample size (360 adults, 1000 tadpoles) for Hazara Torrent Frog (Allopaa hazarensis) and Murree Hills Frog (Nanorana vicina). In this study, we examined how tadpoles responded to different temperatures through metamorphosis, body size, developmental complications or deformities, fitness and survival. We found that the tadpoles of A. hazarensis and N. vicina showed the same response to elevated temperatures under laboratory conditions including faster metamorphosis, reduction in the body size, more frequent developmental complications or deformities such as edema and tail kinks, lower fitness and higher mortality at elevated temperatures (>26 degrees C). The comparison of thermal sensitivity between the two species showed that N. vicina was more sensitive to higher temperatures. Pakistan has been experiencing changes in climatic patterns, and the ecosystems in northern Pakistan are losing biodiversity due to increasing temperature, frequency of drought and intensity of floods. It is feared that these frogs may experience local extinction in future.

Deep body and surface temperature responses to hot and cold environments in the zebra finch,"Szafranska, Paulina Anna and Andreasson, Fredrik and Nord, Andreas and Nilsson, Jan-Ake",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102776,"Global warming increasingly challenges thermoregulation in endothermic animals, particularly in hot and dry environments where low water availability and high temperature increase the risk of hyperthermia. In birds, unfeathered body parts such as the head and bill work as `thermal windows', because heat flux is higher compared to more insulated body regions. We studied how such structures were used in different thermal environments, and if heat flux properties change with time in a given temperature. We acclimated zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) to two different ambient temperatures, `cold' (5 degrees C) and `hot' (35 degrees C), and measured the response in core body temperature using a thermometer, and head surface temperature using thermal imaging. Birds in the hot treatment had 10.3 degrees C higher head temperature than those in the cold treatment. Thermal acclimation also resulted in heat storage in the hot group: core body temperature was 1.1 degrees C higher in the 35 degrees C group compared to the 5 degrees C group. Hence, the thermal gradient from core to shell was 9.03 degrees C smaller in the hot treatment. Dry heat transfer rate from the head was significantly lower in the hot compared to the cold treatment after four weeks of thermal acclimation. This reflects constraints on changes to peripheral circulation and maximum body temperature. Heat dissipation capacity from the head region increased with acclimation time in the hot treatment, perhaps because angiogenesis was required to reach peak heat transfer rate. We have shown that zebra finches meet high environmental temperature by heat storage, which saves water and energy, and by peripheral vasodilation in the head, which facilitates dry heat loss. These responses will not exclude the need for evaporative cooling, but will lessen the amount of energy expend on body temperature reduction in hot environments.",2020,94,NA,NA
Effects of heat stress on ovarian development and the expression of <i>HSP</i> genes in mice,"Bei, Mingyan and Wang, Qian and Yu, Wensai and Han, Lu and Yu, Jing",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102532,"Heat stress reduces oocyte competence, thereby causing lower fertility in animals.

In this study, we subjected female mice to chronic and acute heat stresses; we then calculated the ovary index, examined ovary microstructure, and measured the expression of multiple HSP family genes. Chronic heat stress reduced whole-body and ovarian growth but had little effect on the ovarian index; acute heat stress did not alter whole-body or ovarian weight. Both chronic and acute heat stresses impaired ovary function by causing the dysfunction of granular cells. Small HSP genes increased rapidly after heat treatment, and members of the HSP40, HSP70, and HSP90 families were co-expressed to function in the regulation of the heat stress response.

Few studies have integrated variables, so our understanding about sources of UTL variation remains fragmentary. Thereby, we investigated synergic effects of experimental protocols (heating rates, Delta Ts) and biological factors (ontogeny and body mass) on the UTL on the larvae of two anuran species (Physalaemus nattereri and Boana pardalis), specifically their Critical Thermal Maximum (CTmax). The species displayed slightly different responses to Delta Ts: In B. pardalis tadpoles both average and variance of CTmax increased at a fastest Delta T, the same response happened in P. nattereri tadpoles at slow and moderate Delta Ts. Also, the CTmax of P. nattereri declined at the end of metamorphosis independently of Delta T, but tadpoles at all developmental stages still displayed higher heat tolerance at the slow Delta T. Finally, we detected small, synergic effects of body mass and Delta Ts on the CTmax of both species. In small B. pardalis tadpoles and premetamorphic P. nattereri tadpoles, body mass had a positive effect on CTmax but only at slow and moderate Delta Ts, probably indicating physiological responses. A similar trend was observed in large B. pardalis tadpoles at the fast Delta T, but this result is likely to be influenced by thermal inertia. Our findings contribute to integrate the understanding of factors influencing UTL in small ectothermic animals. This understanding is critical to discuss the physiological component of vulnerability to climate change that is related to acute temperatures.",2019,82,NA,43-51
"It's about time: Linkages between heat tolerance, thermal acclimation and metabolic rate at different temporal scales in the freshwater amphipod <i>Gammarus fossarum</i> Koch, 1836","Semsar-kazerouni, Maryam and Verberk, Wilco C. E. P.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.04.016,"Temperature has a profound impact on ectotherms. Warming increases the metabolic oxygen demand of ectotherms, which could result in a mismatch between their oxygen demand and their ability to extract and deliver sufficient oxygen to meet demand. This hypothesis has been mainly tested using short-term exposure to intense thermal stress. However, the thermal responses of organisms can be different on longer timescales, where physiological acclimation becomes increasingly important. Such thermal acclimation effects may reduce the vulnerability of ectotherms to warming on the long term. Thus, responses to intense, short-term thermal stress may be different from responses to moderate, prolonged thermal stress. Here, we examine the effect of thermal acclimation on heat tolerance and metabolism in the aquatic ectotherm Gammarus fossarum (Koch, 1836). Amphipods were acclimated to either 11.1 +/- 0.1 degrees C or 19.8 +/- 0.1 degrees C and after thermal acclimation we measured both their metabolism and their survival time at different temperatures. Our results show that metabolism strongly increased with increasing temperatures in the cold-acclimated group, but less so in the warm-acclimated group. Cold-acclimated amphipods were also more sensitive to thermal stress, especially during prolonged exposure. Thus, the differences between both thermal acclimation groups support the idea of oxygen-limited heat tolerance: cold-acclimated amphipods showed increased oxygen consumption and decreased thermal tolerance. However, across individuals, those that sharply increased oxygen consumption with increasing temperature did not differ in heat tolerance from individuals whose metabolism was much less sensitive to temperature. Thus, acclimation to different temperatures appeared to be beneficial, but a role for oxygen limitation could not be demonstrated unambiguously. Beneficial effect of acclimation were much larger during prolonged exposure, with the acclimation response ratio (ARR) ranging from 0.03 to over 0.5 depending on the time scale (minutes to months). Thus, the acclimatory capacity may have been underestimated by short-term experimental studies.",2018,75,NA,31-37
Temperature-dependent physiological and biochemical responses of the marine medaka <i>Oryzias melastigma</i> with consideration of both low and high thermal extremes,"Li, Adela J. and Leung, Priscilla T.

Y.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2014.09.011,"This study aimed to investigate temperature effect on physiological and biochemical responses of the marine medaka Oryzias melastigma larvae. The fish were subjected to a stepwise temperature change at a rate of 1 degrees C/h increasing or decreasing from 25 degrees C (the control) to six target temperatures (12, 13, 15, 20, 28 and 32 degrees C) respectively, followed by a 7-day thermal acclimation at each target temperature. The fish were fed ad libitum during the experiment. The results showed that cumulative mortalities were significantly increased at low temperatures (12 and 13 degrees C) and at the highest temperature (32 degrees C). For the survivors, their growth profile closely followed the left-skewed `thermal performance curve'. Routine oxygen consumption rates of fish larvae were significantly elevated at 32 degrees C but suppressed at 13 and 15 degrees C (due to a high mortality, larvae from 12 degrees C were not examined). Levels of heat shock proteins and activities of malate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase were also measured in fish larvae exposed at 15, 25 and 32 degrees C. The activities of both enzymes were significantly increased at both 15 and 32 degrees C, where the fish larvae probably suffered from thermal discomfort and increased anaerobic components so as to compensate the mismatch of energy demand and supply at these thermal extremes. Coincidently, heat shock proteins were also up-regulated at both 15 and 32 degrees C, enabling cellular protection. Moreover, the critical thermal maxima and minima of fish larvae increased significantly with increasing acclimation temperature, implying that the fish could develop some degrees of thermal tolerance through temperature acclimation.

The preimaginal development in this species takes place during a short time period, from May to June, because larvae are unable to consume mature leaves of the host plant. Therefore, the diet quality imposes a time constraint, and it was expected that the temperature dependence of development in C vigintipunctata should be adaptively adjusted to the shortness and cool conditions of the favorable season. It was experimentally determined that this leaf beetle was stenothermal at the larval stage, required 275.5 degree-days above the threshold of 9.0 degrees C for total development from oviposition to adult emergence, and attained greater body mass at lower temperatures. However, in all of these aspects, the thermal ecology of C vigintipunctata was similar to that of two related multivoltine species, C. populi and C. scripta. The interspecific similarity of thermal reaction norms for development rate and body size suggests that these reaction norms in C. vigintipunctata were unlikely to have been shaped by selection favoring faster development or growth early in the season.

Thermal dependence of<i> Daphnia</i> life history reveals asymmetries between key vital rates,"Richard, Romain and Zhang, Yi-Kuan and Hung, Kuan-Wei",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103653,"Temperature variation affects virtually every aspect of ectotherms' ecological performance, such as their foraging rate, reproduction, and survival. Although these changes influence what happens at higher levels of organizations, such as populations and communities, qualitative changes in dynamics usually require some degree of asymmetry between key vital rates, i.e. that different vital rates, such as growth, development, fecundity and mortality rates, respond differently to temperature. In order to identify possible asymmetries among vital rates and/or life stages, we characterized the thermal response of individuals a clone of Daphnia sinensis, drawn from a high-mountain environment in Taiwan, and examined the temperature dependence of growth, maturation, reproduction, and mortality rates, as well as fitness measures (r and R0) at eight temper-atures. Daphnia sinensis was able to maintain reproductive success over a broad range of temperatures, much wider than the one experienced in its environment. However, negative effects of temperature were perceptible at temperatures much lower than the highest one at which they can achieve reproductive success. Adult mortality greatly increased for temperatures above 23 degrees C, and other vital rates started to decelerate, resulting in a large drop in lifetime reproductive success. This finding implies that D. sinensis may be able to persist over a wide range of temperatures, but also that it may become more sensitive to the detrimental effect of species interactions at increased temperatures. Different vital rates responded relatively similarly at low temperatures, but the degree of asymmetry among these rates was much more pronounced at higher temperatures. In particular, rates associated with adult performance decelerated more strongly than juveniles' rates. These findings indicate that elevated temperatures affect the balance between juvenile and adult performance, which is known to have a crucial role in Daphnia population dynamics. We discuss the implications of these results for the dynamics of structured populations.",2023,115,NA,NA
The incubation environment does not explain significant variation in heart rate plasticity among avian embryos,"Cones, Alexandra G. and Schneider, Eve R. and Westneat, David F.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.247120,"The conditions an organism experiences during development can modify how they plastically respond to short-term changes in their environment later in life. This can be adaptive because the optimal average trait value and the optimal plastic change in trait value in response to the environment may differ across different environments. For example, early developmental temperatures can adaptively modify how reptiles, fish and invertebrates metabolically respond to temperature. However, whether individuals within populations respond differently (a prerequisite to adaptive evolution), and whether this occurs in birds, which are only ectothermic for part of their life cycle, is not known. We experimentally tested these possibilities by artificially incubating the embryos of Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) at constant or variable temperatures. We measured their consequent heart rate reaction norms to short-term changes in egg temperature and tracked their growth. Contrary to expectations, the early thermal environment did not modify heart rate reaction norms, but regardless, these reaction norms differed among individuals. Embryos with higher average heart rates were smaller upon hatching, but heart rate reaction norms did not predict subsequent growth. Our data also suggests that the thermal environment may affect both the variance in heart rate reaction norms and their covariance with growth. Thus, individual avian embryos can vary in their plasticity to temperature, and in contrast to fully ectothermic taxa, the early thermal environment does not explain this variance. Because among -individual variation is one precondition to adaptive evolution, the factors that do contribute to such variability may be",2024,227,5,NA

Such knowledge also provides information necessary to predict responses of such traits to environmental changes. Studies on latitudinal trends in insect immunity have so far yielded contradictory results, suggesting that multispecies approaches with highly standardised experimental conditions are needed. Here, we studied among-population differences of two parameters reflecting constitutive immunity-phenoloxidase (PO) and lytic activity, using common-garden design on three distantly related moth species represented by populations ranging from northern Finland to Georgia (Caucasus). The larvae were reared at different temperatures and on different host plants under a crossed factors experimental design. Haemolymph samples for measurement of immune status were taken from the larvae strictly synchronously. Clear among-population differences could be shown only for PO activity in one species (elevated activity in the northern populations). There was some indication that the cases of total absence of lytic activity were more common in southern populations. The effects of temperature, host and sex on the immunological traits studied remained highly species specific. Some evidence was found that lytic activity may be involved in mediating trade-offs between immunity and larval growth performance. In contrast, PO activity rarely covaried with fitness-related traits, and neither were the values of PO and lytic activity correlated with each other. The relatively inconsistent nature of the detected patterns suggests that studies on geographic differences in immunological traits should involve multiple species, and rely on several immunological indices if general trends are a point of interest.",2017,220,14,2606-2615

One component of the developmental environment, which is likely central to early life oxidative stress among ectothermic and oviparous species, is that of temperature. We investigated how incubation temperature manipulations affect oxidative damage and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans) hatchlings. First, to determine whether temperature fluctuations elicit oxidative stress, eggs from clutches were randomly assigned to either a constant (29.5 degrees C) or daily fluctuating temperature incubation (28.7 +/- 3 degrees C) treatment. Second, to assess the effect of temperature fluctuation frequency on oxidative stress, eggs were incubated in one of three fluctuating incubation regimes: 28.7 +/- 3 degrees C fluctuations every 12 h (hyper), 24 h (normal) or 48 h (hypo). Third, we tested the influence of average incubation temperature by incubating eggs in a daily fluctuating incubation temperature regime with a mean temperature of 26.5 degrees C (low), 27.1 degrees C (medium) or 27.7 degrees C (high). Although the accumulation of oxidative damage in hatchlings was unaffected by any thermal manipulation, TAC was affected by both temperature fluctuation frequency and average incubation temperature. Individuals incubated with a low frequency of temperature fluctuations had reduced TAC, while incubation at a lower average temperature was associated with enhanced TAC. These results indicate that although sufficient to prevent oxidative damage, TAC is influenced by developmental thermal environments, potentially because of temperature-mediated changes in metabolic rate. The observed differences in TAC may have important future consequences for hatchling fitness and overwinter survival.",2016,219,4,561-570

We examined the molecular markers of autophagy, apoptosis and inflammation during short-term (1 day) and long-term (6 days) hypoxia and post-hypoxic recovery (1 h) in mussels and oysters by measuring the lysosomal membrane stability, activity of a key autophagic enzyme (cathepsin D) and mRNA expression of the genes involved in the cellular survival and inflammation, including caspase 2, 3 and 8, Bcl-2, BAX, TGF-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), nuclear factor kappa B1 (NF-kappa B) and NF-kappa B activating kinases IKK alpha and TBK1. Crassostrea gigas exhibited higher hypoxia tolerance, as well as blunted or delayed inflammatory and apoptotic response to hypoxia and reoxygenation as shown by the later onset and/or the lack of transcriptional activation of caspases, BAX and the inflammatory effector NF-kappa B, compared with M. edulis. Long-term hypoxia resulted in upregulation of Bcl-2 in the oysters and mussels, implying activation of anti-apoptotic mechanisms.

The results suggest that maternally derived yolk antioxidants successfully buffer developing embryonic tissues against an increased exogenous oxidative threat. Furthermore, vitamin E plays a more important role in protecting the embryo than carotenoids. However, the depletion of antioxidants and increased peroxidation of lipids in the yolk could have negative consequences for embryonic development, in particular for the brain and heart that require highly un saturated fatty acids, and protection against the oxidative burst following hatching.",2018,221,13,NA
Temperature fluctuations and estrone sulfate affect gene expression via different mechanisms to promote female development in a species with temperature-dependent sex determination,"Marroquin-Flores, Rosario A. and Paitz, Ryan T. and Bowden, Rachel M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.244211,"Variation in developmental conditions can affect a variety of embryonic processes and shape a number of phenotypic characteristics that can affect offspring throughout their lives. This is particularly true of oviparous species where development typically occurs outside of the female, and studies have shown that traits such as survival and behavior can be altered by both temperature and exposure to steroid hormones during development. In species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), the fate of gonadal development can be affected by temperature and by maternal estrogens present in the egg at oviposition, and there is evidence that these factors can affect gene expression patterns. Here, we explored how thermal fluctuations and exposure to an estrogen metabolite, estrone sulfate, affect the expression of several genes known to be involved in sexual differentiation: Kdm6b, Dmrt1, Sox9, FoxL2 and Cyp19A1. We found that most of the genes responded to both temperature and estrone sulfate exposure, but that the responses to these factors were not identical, in that estrone sulfate effects occur downstream of temperature effects. Our findings demonstrate that conjugated hormones such as estrone sulfate are capable of influencing temperature-dependent pathways to potentially alter how embryos respond to temperature, and highlight the importance of studying the interaction of maternal hormone and temperature effects.",2022,225,16,NA
MicroRNA-mediated inhibition of AMPK coordinates tissue-specific downregulation of skeletal muscle metabolism in hypoxic naked mole-rats,"Hadj-Moussa, Hanane and Chiasson, Sarah and Cheng, Hang and Eaton, Liam and Storey, Kenneth B. and Pamenter, Matthew E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.249668,"Naked mole-rats reduce their metabolic requirements to tolerate severe hypoxia. However, the regulatory mechanisms that underpin this metabolic suppression have yet to be elucidated. 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is the cellular `master' energy effector and we hypothesized that alterations in the AMPK pathway contribute to metabolic reorganization in hypoxic naked mole-rat skeletal muscle. To test this hypothesis, we exposed naked mole-rats to 4 h of normoxia (21\% O-2) or severe hypoxia (3\% O-2), while indirectly measuring whole-animal metabolic rate and fuel preference. We then isolated skeletal muscle and assessed protein expression and post-translational modification of AMPK, and downstream changes in key glucose and fatty acid metabolic proteins mediated by AMPK, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC1), glycogen synthase (GS) and glucose transporters (GLUTs) 1 and 4. We found that in hypoxic naked mole-rats (1) metabolic rate decreased similar to 80\% and fuel use switched to carbohydrates, and that (2) levels of activated phosphorylated AMPK and GS, and GLUT4 expression were downregulated in skeletal muscle, while ACC1 was unchanged. To explore the regulatory mechanism underlying this hypometabolic state, we used RT-qPCR to examine 55 AMPK-associated microRNAs (miRNAs), which are short non-coding RNA post-transcriptional silencers. We identified changes in 10 miRNAs (three upregulated and seven downregulated) implicated in AMPK downregulation. Our results suggest that miRNAs and post-translational mechanisms coordinately reduce AMPK activity and downregulate metabolism in naked mole-rat skeletal muscle during severe hypoxia. This novel mechanism may support tissue-specific prioritization of energy for more essential organs in hypoxia.",2021,224,15,NA
Experimental support towards a metabolic proxy in fish using otolith carbon isotopes,"Martino, Jasmin C. and Doubleday, Zoe A. and Chung, Ming-Tsung and Gillanders, Bronwyn M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.217091,"Metabolic rate underpins our understanding of how species survive, reproduce and interact with their environment, but can be difficult to measure in wild fish. Stable carbon isotopes (delta C-13) in ear stones (otoliths) of fish may reflect lifetime metabolic signatures but experimental validation is required to advance our understanding of the relationship. To this end, we reared juvenile Australasian snapper (Chrysophrys auratus), an iconic fishery species, at different temperatures and used intermittent-flow respirometry to calculate standard metabolic rate (SMR), maximum metabolic rate (MMR) and absolute aerobic scope (AAS). Subsequently, we analysed delta C-13 and oxygen isotopes (delta O-18) in otoliths using isotope-ratio mass spectrometry. We found that under increasing temperatures, delta C-13 and delta O-18 significantly decreased, while SMR and MMR significantly increased. Negative logarithmic relationships were found between delta C-13 in otoliths and both SMR and MMR, while exponential decay curves were observed between proportions of metabolically sourced carbon in otoliths (Moto) and both measured and theoretical SMR. We show that basal energy for subsistence living and activity metabolism, both core components of field metabolic rates, contribute towards incorporation of delta C-13 into otoliths and support the use of delta C-13 as a metabolic proxy in field settings. The functional shapes of the logarithmic and exponential decay curves indicated that physiological thresholds regulate relationships between delta C-13 and metabolic rates due to upper thresholds of Moto. Here, we present quantitative experimental evidence to support the development of an otolithbased metabolic proxy, which could be a powerful tool in reconstructing lifetime biological trends in wild fish.",2020,223,6,NA
Divergent respiratory and cardiovascular responses to hypoxia in bar-headed geese and Andean birds,"Lague, Sabine L. and Chua, Beverly and Alza, Luis and Scott, Graham R. and Frappell, Peter B. and Zhong, Yang and Farrell, Anthony P. and McCracken, Kevin G. and Wang, Yuxiang and Milsom, William K.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.168799,"Many high-altitude vertebrates have evolved increased capacities in their oxygen transport cascade (ventilation, pulmonary diffusion, circulation and tissue diffusion), enhancing oxygen transfer from the atmosphere to mitochondria. However, the extent of interspecies variation in the control processes that dictate hypoxia responses remains largely unknown. We compared the metabolic, cardiovascular and respiratory responses to progressive decreases in inspired oxygen levels of bar-headed geese (Anser indicus), birds that biannually migrate across the Himalayan mountains, with those of Andean geese (Chloephaga melanoptera) and crested ducks (Lophonetta specularioides), lifelong residents of the high Andes. We show that Andean geese and crested ducks have evolved fundamentally different mechanisms for maintaining oxygen supply during low oxygen (hypoxia) from those of bar-headed geese. Bar-headed geese respond to hypoxia with robust increases in ventilation and heart rate, whereas Andean species increase lung oxygen extraction and cardiac stroke volume. We propose that transient high-altitude performance has favoured the evolution of robust convective oxygen transport recruitment in hypoxia, whereas life-long high-altitude residency has favoured the evolution of structural enhancements to the lungs and heart that increase lung diffusion and stroke volume.",2017,220,22,4186-4194
Hypoxia-induced changes in hemoglobins of Lake Victoria cichlids,"van den Thillart, Guido and Wilms, Inger and Nieveen, Maaike and Weber, Roy E. and Witte, Frans",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.177832,"In a previous study, broods of the Lake Victoria cichlid Haplochromis ishmaeli raised under hypoxic or normoxic conditions showed striking differences in isohemoglobin (isoHb) pattern that were not observed in two other cichlids that do not belong to the Lake Victoria species flock. We therefore hypothesized that the adaptive mechanism seen in H. ishmaeli in response to hypoxia constitutes a trait that the Lake Victoria species flock inherited from ancestors that lived in hypoxic environments. We tested this hypothesis by designing split-brood experiments with three other representative species from the same species flock: the insectivorous Haplochromis thereuterion, the mollusk-shelling Platytaeniodus degeni and the zooplanktivorous Haplochromis piceatus, while keeping H. ishmaeli as a reference. Split broods were raised, under either normoxia or hypoxia. All hypoxia-raised (HR) individuals of each of the four species exhibited a distinctly different isoHb pattern compared with their normoxiaraised (NR) siblings. The hemoglobin of HR H. thereuterion showed higher O-2 affinity compared with NR siblings particularly in the presence of ATP and GTP, indicating that blood of HR juveniles has significantly improved O-2-binding affinity under hypoxic conditions. We also tested the capacity to acclimate at greater age in two species by reversing the O-2 condition after 7 (H. thereuterion) and 4 (H. ishmaeli) months. After reacclimation for 1 and 2 months, respectively, we found incomplete reversal with intermediate isoHb patterns. As three of the four species do not encounter hypoxic conditions in their environment, this unique trait seems to be a relic inherited from predecessors that lived in hypoxic environments.",2018,221,17,NA
Energetics of migratory bats during stopover: a test of the torpor-assisted migration hypothesis,"Baloun, Dylan E. and Guglielmo, Christopher G.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.196691,"The torpor-assisted migration hypothesis posits that migration is facilitated in bats by the use of torpor during stopover roosting periods, and predicts that at stopover, bats regulate time in torpor facultatively so that daily energy expenditure is independent of ambient roosting temperature. Energy savings can thus be directed to migratory movement. However, direct measurements of total roosting energy expenditure in relation to ambient and body temperature are lacking. We captured migratory silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans; similar to 11 g) at Long Point, ON, Canada, in spring and autumn 2016. We used quantitative magnetic resonance analysis to measure body composition change and energy expenditure over a 12 h roosting period in a ventilated incubator at 10, 17 and 25 degrees C. We assessed the effects of season, body mass, sex and age on energy expenditure. We found that daily energy expenditure was independent of roosting temperature, and that this was achieved by flexible use of torpor. Variation in body mass at capture was driven mainly by differences in fat, and the amount of body fat was negatively related to torpor use, particularly in spring. Season, sex and age also affected torpor use and energy expenditure, notably with pregnant females being generally fatter and using less torpor than males in spring. We estimate that stopover contributes only 15-20\% to the total energy costs of migration in bats compared with 70\% or more in typical birds. This study provides support for the torpor-assisted migration hypothesis. and furthers our understanding of the energy budgets of migratory bats.",2019,222,6,NA
A diminutive snake species can maintain regional heterothermy in both and thermal environments,"Cox, Christian L. and Chung, Albert K. and Davoll, Myles E. and DeHart, Steph A. and Gerardi, Samuel T. and Ly, Tony K. and Moxley, Kyle and Nipper, Preston T. and Novak, Delaney R. and Reeves, Phillip F. and Williams, Becky J. and Logan, Michael L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.245380,"Regional heterothermy is a pattern whereby different body regions are maintained at different temperatures, often to prioritize the function of certain body parts over others, or to maximize the function of organs and tissues that vary in thermal sensitivity. Regional heterothermy is relatively well understood in endotherms, where physiological mechanisms maintain heterogeneity. However, less is known about regional heterothermy in ectotherms, where behavioral mechanisms are more important for generating thermal variation. In particular, whether small and elongate ectotherms with high surface area to volume ratios such as diminutive snakes can maintain regional heterothermy, despite rapid thermal equilibration, is not yet known. We measured regional variation in body temperature and tested whether environmental heterogeneity is used to generate regional heterothermy in the ring-necked snake (Diadophis punctatus) using both field and laboratory studies. We found that ring-necked snakes have robust regional heterothermy in a variety of contexts, despite their small body size and elongate body shape. Temperature variation along the length of their bodies was not detectable when measured externally. However, snakes had higher mouth than cloacal temperatures both in the field and in laboratory thermal gradients. Further, this regional heterothermy was maintained even in ambient laboratory conditions, where the thermal environment was relatively homogeneous. Our results indicate that regional heterothermy in ring-necked snakes is not solely driven by environmental variation but is instead linked to physiological or morphological mechanisms that maintain regional variation in body temperature irrespective of environmental context.",2023,226,11,NA
Thermo-TRPs and gut microbiota are involved in thermogenesis and energy metabolism during low temperature exposure of obese mice,"Wen, Jing and Bo, Tingbei and Zhang, Xueying and Wang, Zuoxin and Wang, Dehua",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.218974,"Ambient temperature and food composition can affect energy metabolism of the host. Thermal transient receptor potential ion channels (thermo-TRPs) can detect temperature signals and are involved in the regulation of thermogenesis and energy homeostasis. Further, the gut microbiota have also been implicated in thermogenesis and obesity. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that thermo-TRPs and gut microbiota are involved in reducing diet-induced obesity (DIO) during low temperature exposure. C57BL/6J mice in obese (body mass gain >45\%), lean (body mass gain <15\%) and control (body mass gain <1\%) groups were exposed to high (23 +/- 1 degrees C) or low (4 +/- 1 degrees C) ambient temperature for 28 days. Our data showed that low temperature exposure attenuated DIO, but enhanced brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis. Low temperature exposure also resulted in increased noradrenaline (NA) concentrations in the hypothalamus, decreased TRP melastatin 8 (TRPM8) expression in the small intestine, and altered composition and diversity of gut microbiota. In DIO mice, there was a decrease in overall energy intake along with a reduction in TRP ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) expression and an increase in NA concentration in the small intestine. DIO mice also showed increases in Oscillospira, [}Ruminococcus], Lactococcus and Christensenella and decreases in Prevotella, Odoribacter and Lactobacillus at the genus level in fecal samples. Together, our data suggest that thermos-TRPs and gut microbiota are involved in thermogenesis and energy metabolism during low temperature exposure in DIO mice.",2020,223,11,NA

However, for animals in light-restricted habitats (e.g. burrows or cavities), thermoperiod may be a more important cue. Our study tested this hypothesis in the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata, which nests in cavities and undergoes development within a brood cell. We assessed the role of environmental cues (thermoperiod and photoperiod) on the process of adult emergence by examining: (1) whether those cues direct circadian rhythms, (2) which cue is more dominant and (3) how sensitive developing bees and emergence-ready adults are to cues. Although we found that 20\% of light penetrates the brood cell, and bees respond to photoperiod by synchronizing emergence, thermoperiod is the dominant cue. When presented with a conflicting zeitgeber, bees entrained to the thermophase instead of the photophase. When temperature cues were removed, we observed free-running of emergence, indicating that underlying circadian mechanisms can be synchronized by daily fluctuations in temperature. We also found that emerging bees were highly sensitive to even small increases in temperature, entraining to a ramp speed of 0.33 degrees C h(-1). The response and sensitivity to temperature cues suggest that M. rotundata evolved a temperature-mediated clock to time emergence from light-restricted cavities.",2018,221,10,NA
Daily temperature cycles prolong lifespan and have sex-specific effects on peripheral clock gene expression in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>,"Goh, Grace H. and Blache, Dominique and Mark, Peter J. and Kennington, W. Jason and Maloney, Shane K.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.233213,"Circadian rhythms optimize health by coordinating the timing of physiological processes to match predictable daily environmental challenges. The circadian rhythm of body temperature is thought to be an important modulator of molecular clocks in peripheral tissues, but how daily temperature cycles affect physiological function is unclear. Here, we examined the effect of constant temperature (T-con, 25 degrees C) and cycling temperature (T-cyc, 28 degrees C:22 degrees C during light:dark) paradigms on lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster, and the expression of clock genes, heat shock protein 83 (Hsp83), Frost (Fst) and senescence marker protein-30 (smp-30). Male and female D. melanogaster housed at T-cyc had longer median lifespans than those housed at T-con. T-cyc induced robust Hsp83 rhythms and rescued the age-related decrease in smp-30 expression that was observed in flies at T-con, potentially indicating an increased capacity to cope with age-related cellular stress. Ageing under T-con led to a decrease in the amplitude of expression of all clock genes in the bodies of male flies, except for cyc, which was non-rhythmic, and for per and cry in female flies. Strikingly, housing under T-cyc conditions rescued the age-related decrease in amplitude of all clock genes, and generated rhythmicity in cyc expression, in the male flies, but not the female flies. The results suggest that ambient temperature rhythms modulate D. melanogaster lifespan, and that the amplitude of clock gene expression in peripheral body clocks may be a potential link between temperature rhythms and longevity in male D. melanogaster. Longevity due to T-cyc appeared predominantly independent of clock gene amplitude in female D. melanogaster.",2021,224,10,NA
Physiological correlates of symbiont migration during bleaching of two octocoral species,"Netherton, Sarah E. and Scheer, Daniele M. and Morrison, Patrick R. and Parrin, Austin P. and Blackstone, Neil W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.095414,"Perturbed colonies of Phenganax parrini and Sarcothelia sp. exhibit migration of symbionts of Symbiodinium spp. into the stolons. Densitometry and visual inspection indicated that polyps bleached while stolons did not. When migration was triggered by temperature, light and confinement, colonies of Sarcothelia sp. decreased rates of oxygen formation in the light (due to the effects of perturbation on photosynthesis and respiration) and increased rates of oxygen uptake in the dark (due to the effects of perturbation on respiration alone). Colonies of P. parrini, by contrast, showed no significant changes in either aspect of oxygen metabolism. When migration was triggered by light and confinement, colonies of Sarcothelia sp. showed decreased rates of oxygen formation in the light and increased rates of oxygen uptake in the dark, while colonies of P. parrini maintained the former and increased the latter. During symbiont migration into their stolons, colonies of both species showed dramatic increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS), as visualized with a fluorescent probe, with stolons of Sarcothelia sp. exhibiting a nearly immediate increase of ROS. Differences in symbiont type may explain the greater sensitivity of colonies of Sarcothelia sp. Using fluorescent probes, direct measurements of migrating symbionts in the stolons of Sarcothelia sp. showed higher levels of reactive nitrogen species and lower levels of ROS than the surrounding host tissue. As measured by native fluorescence, levels of NAD(P) H in the stolons were unaffected by perturbation. Symbiont migration thus correlates with dramatic physiological changes and may serve as a marker for coral condition.",2014,217,9,1469-1477
Chilling induces unidirectional solute leak through the locust gut epithelia,"Brzezinski, Kaylen and MacMillan, Heath A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.215475,"Chill-susceptible insects, like the migratory locust, often die when exposed to low temperatures from an accumulation of tissue damage that is unrelated to freezing (chilling injury). Chilling injury is often associated with a loss of ion balance across the gut epithelia. It has recently been suggested that this imbalance is at least partly caused by a cold-induced disruption of epithelial barrier function. Here, we aimed to test this hypothesis in the migratory locust (Locusta migratoria). First, chill tolerance was quantified by exposing locusts to -2 degrees C and recording chill coma recovery time and survival 24 h post-cold exposure. Longer exposure times significantly increased recovery time and caused injury and death. Ion-selective microelectrodes were also used to test for a loss of ion balance in the cold. We found a significant increase of haemolymph K+ and decrease of haemolymph Na+ concentration over time. Next, barrier failure along the gut was tested by monitoring the movement of an epithelial barrier marker (FITC-dextran) across the gut epithelia during exposure to -2 degrees C. We found a significant increase in haemolymph FITC-dextran concentration over time in the cold when assayed in the mucosal to serosal direction. However, when tested in the serosal to mucosal direction, we saw minimal marker movement across the gut epithelia. This suggests that while cold-induced barrier disruption is present, it is apparently unidirectional. It is important to note that these data reveal only the phenomenon itself. The location of this leak as well as the underlying mechanisms remain unclear and require further investigation.",2020,223,13,NA
Inhibition of the oxidative stress response by heat stress in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>,"Crombie, Timothy A. and Tang, Lanlan and Choe, Keith P. and Julian, David",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.135327,"It has long been recognized that simultaneous exposure to heat stress and oxidative stress shows a synergistic interaction that reduces organismal fitness, but relatively little is known about the mechanisms underlying this interaction. We investigated the role of molecular stress responses in driving this synergistic interaction using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. To induce oxidative stress, we used the pro-oxidant compounds acrylamide, paraquat and juglone. As expected, we found that heat stress and oxidative stress interact synergistically to reduce survival. Compared with exposure to each stressor alone, during simultaneous sublethal exposure to heat stress and oxidative stress the normal induction of key oxidative-stress response (OxSR) genes was generally inhibited, whereas the induction of key heat-shock response (HSR) genes was not. Genetically activating the SKN-1-dependent OxSR increased a marker for protein aggregation and decreased whole-worm survival during heat stress alone, with the latter being independent of HSF-1. In contrast, compared with wild-type worms, inactivating the HSR by HSF-1 knockdown, which would be expected to decrease basal heat shock protein expression, increased survival during oxidative stress alone. Taken together, these data suggest that, in C. elegans, the HSR and OxSR cannot be simultaneously activated to the same extent that each can be activated during a single stressor exposure. We conclude that the observed synergistic reduction in survival during combined exposure to heat stress and oxidative stress is due, at least in part, to inhibition of the OxSR during activation of the HSR.",2016,219,14,2201-2211
Physiological responses of ectotherms to daily temperature variation,"Kern, Pippa and Cramp, Rebecca L. and Franklin, Craig E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.123166,"Daily thermal fluctuations (DTFs) impact the capacity of ectotherms to maintain performance and energetic demands because of thermodynamic effects on physiological processes. Mechanisms that reduce the thermal sensitivity of physiological traits may buffer ectotherms from the consequences of DTFs. Species that experience varying degrees of DTFs in their environments may differ in their responses to thermally variable conditions, if thermal performance curves reflect environmental conditions. We tested the hypothesis that in response to DTFs, tadpoles from habitats characterised by small DTFs would show greater plasticity in the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes than tadpoles from environments characterised by large DTFs. We tested the thermal sensitivity of physiological traits in tadpoles of three species that differ naturally in their exposure to DTFs, raised in control (24 degrees C) and DTF treatments (20-30 degrees C and 18-38 degrees C). DTFs reduced growth in all species. Development of tadpoles experiencing DTFs was increased for tadpoles from highly thermally variable habitats (similar to 15\%), and slower in tadpoles from less thermally variable habitats (similar to 30\%). In general, tadpoles were unable to alter the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes, although DTFs induced plasticity in metabolic enzyme activity in all species, although to a greater extent in species from less thermally variable environments. DTFs increased upper thermal limits in all species (between 0.89 and 1.6 degrees C). Our results suggest that the impact of increased thermal variability may favour some species while others are negatively impacted. Species that cannot compensate for increased variability by buffering growth and development will probably be most affected.",2015,218,19,3068-3076
Environmental temperature alters the overall digestive energetics and differentially affects dietary protein and lipid use in a lizard,"Plasman, Melissa and McCue, Marshall D. and Hugo Reynoso, Victor and Terblanche, John S. and Clusella-Trullas, Susana",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.194480,"Processing food (e.g. ingestion. digestion, assimilation) requires energy referred to as specific dynamic action (SDA) and is at least partially fuelled by oxidation of the nutrients (e.g. proteins and lipids) within the recently ingested meal. In ectotherms, environmental temperature can affect the magnitude and/or duration of the SDA, but is likely to also alter the mixture of nutrients that are oxidized to cover these costs. Here, we examined metabolic rate, gut passage time, assimilation efficiency and fuel use in the lizard Agama atra digesting cricket meals at three ecologically relevant temperatures (20, 25 and 32 degrees C). Crickets were isotopically enriched with C-13-leucine or C-13-palmitic-acid tracers to distinguish between protein and lipid oxidation, respectively. Our results show that higher temperatures increased the magnitude of the SDA peak (by 318\% between 32 and 20 degrees C) and gut passage rate (63\%), and decreased the duration of the SDA response (by 20\% for males and 48\% for females). Peak rate of dietary protein oxidation occurred sooner than peak lipid oxidation at all temperatures (70, 60 and 31 h earlier for 20, 25 and 32 degrees C, respectively). Assimilation efficiency of proteins, but not lipids, was positively related to temperature. Interestingly, the SDA response exhibited a notable circadian rhythm. These results show that temperature has a pronounced effect on digestive energetics in A. atra, and that this effect differs between nutrient classes. Variation in environmental temperatures may thus alter the energy budget and nutrient reserves of these animals.",2019,222,6,NA
Asymmetric energetic costs in reciprocal-cross hybrids between carnivorous mice (<i>Onychomys</i>),"Shipley, J. Ryan and Campbell, Polly and Searle, Jeremy B. and Pasch, Bret",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.148890,"Aerobic respiration is a fundamental physiological trait dependent on coordinated interactions between gene products of the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Mitonuclear mismatch in interspecific hybrids may contribute to reproductive isolation by inducing reduced viability (or even complete inviability) due to increased metabolic costs. However, few studies have tested for effects of mitonuclear mismatch on respiration at the whole-organism level. We explored how hybridization affects metabolic rate in closely related species of grasshopper mice (genus Onychomys) to better understand the role of metabolic costs in reproductive isolation. We measured metabolic rate across a range of temperatures to calculate basal metabolic rate (BMR) and cold-induced metabolic rate (MRc) in O. leucogaster, O. torridus and O. arenicola, and in reciprocal F-1 hybrids between the latter two species. Within the genus, we found a negative correlation between mass-specific BMR and body mass. Although O. arenicola was smaller than O. torridus, hybrids from both directions of the cross resembled O. arenicola in body mass. In contrast, hybrid BMR was strongly influenced by the direction of the cross: reciprocal F-1 hybrids were different from each other but indistinguishable from the maternal species. In addition, MRc was not significantly different between hybrids and either parental species. These patterns indicate that metabolic costs are not increased in Onychomys F-1 hybrids and, while exposure of incompatibilities in F-2 hybrids cannot be ruled out, suggest that mitonuclear mismatch does not act as a primary barrier to gene flow. Maternal matching of BMR is suggestive of a strong effect of mitochondrial genotype on metabolism in hybrids. Together, our findings provide insight into the metabolic consequences of hybridization, a topic that is understudied in mammals.",2016,219,23,3803-3809
Genetic and environmental effects on the scaling of metabolic rate with body size,"Fossen, Erlend I.

The variational properties of b have been debated, but very few studies have tested for genetic variance in b, and none have tested for a genotype-by-environment (GxE) interaction in b. Consequently, the short-term evolutionary potentials of both b and its phenotypic plasticity remain unknown. Using 10 clones of a population of Daphnia magna, we estimated the genetic variance in b and assessed whether a GxE interaction affected b. We measured MR on juveniles of different sizes reared andmeasured at three temperatures (17, 22 and 28 degrees C). Overall, b decreased with increasing temperature. We found no evidence of genetic variance in b at any temperature, and thus no GxE interaction in b. However, we found a significant GxE interaction in size-specific MR. Using simulations, we show how this GxE interaction can generate genetic variation in the ontogenetic allometric slope of animals experiencing directional changes in temperature during growth. This suggests that b can evolve despite having limited genetic variation at constant temperatures.",2019,222,7,NA
Electrical aspects of the osmorespiratory compromise: TEP responses to hypoxia in the euryhaline killifish (<i>Fundulus heteroclitus</i>) in freshwater and seawater,"Wood, Chris M. and Grosell, Martin",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.122176,"The osmorespiratory compromise, the trade-off between the requirements for respiratory and ionoregulatory homeostasis at the gills, becomes more intense during environmental hypoxia. One aspect that has been previously overlooked is possible change in transepithelial potential (TEP) caused by hypoxia, which will influence branchial ionic fluxes. Using the euryhaline killifish, we show that acute hypoxia reduces the TEP across the gills by approximately 10 mV in animals acclimated to both freshwater (FW) and seawater (SW), with a higher PO2 threshold in the former. TEP becomes negative in FW, and less positive in SW. The effects are immediate, stable for at least 3 h, and reverse immediately upon return to normoxia. Hypoxia also blocks the normal increase in TEP that occurs upon transfer from FW to SW, but does not reduce the fall in TEP that occurs with transfer in the opposite direction. These effects may be beneficial in FW but not in SW.",2015,218,14,2152-2155
To boldly gulp: standard metabolic rate and boldness have context-dependent influences on risk-taking to breathe air in a catfish,"McKenzie, David J. and Belao, Thiago C. and Killen, Shaun S. and Rantin, F. Tadeu",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.122903,"The African sharptooth catfish Clarias gariepinus has bimodal respiration, it has a suprabranchial air-breathing organ alongside substantial gills. We used automated bimodal respirometry to reveal that undisturbed juvenile catfish (N=29) breathed air continuously in normoxia, with a marked diurnal cycle. Air breathing and routine metabolic rate (RMR) increased in darkness when, in the wild, this nocturnal predator forages. Aquatic hypoxia (20\% air saturation) greatly increased overall reliance on air breathing. We investigated whether two measures of risk taking to breathe air, namely absolute rates of aerial O-2 uptake ((M) over dotO(2), air) and the percentage of RMR obtained from air (\% (M) over dotO(2), air), were influenced by individual standard metabolic rate (SMR) and boldness. In particular, whether any influence varied with resource availability (normoxia versus hypoxia) or relative fear of predation (day versus night). Individual SMR, derived from respirometry, had an overall positive influence on (M) over dotO(2), air across all contexts but a positive influence on \% (M) over dotO(2), air only in hypoxia. Thus, a pervasive effect of SMR on air breathing became most acute in hypoxia, when individuals with higher O-2 demand took proportionally more risks. Boldness was estimated as time required to resume air breathing after a fearful stimulus in daylight normoxia (T-res). Although T-res had no overall influence on (M) over dotO(2), air or \% (M) over dotO(2), air, there was a negative relationship between Tres and \% (M) over dotO(2), air in daylight, in normoxia and hypoxia. There were two Tres response groups, `bold' phenotypes with Tres below 75 min (N= 13) which, in daylight, breathed proportionally more air than `shy' phenotypes with Tres above 115 min (N= 16). Therefore, individual boldness influenced air breathing when fear of predation was high. Thus, individual energy demand and personality did not have parallel influences on the emergent tendency to take risks to obtain a resource; their influences varied in strength with context.",2015,218,23,3762-3770
"Transient and permanent effects of suboptimal incubation temperatures on growth, metabolic rate, immune function and adrenocortical responses in zebra finches","Wada, Haruka and Kriengwatana, Buddhamas and Allen, Natalie and Schmidt, Kimberly L. and Soma, Kiran K. and MacDougall-Shackleton, Scott A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.114108,"In birds, incubation temperature can vary by several degrees Celsius among nests of a given species. Parents may alter incubation temperature to cope with environmental conditions and/or to manipulate embryonic development, and such changes in incubation behavior could have long-lasting effects on offspring phenotype. To investigate short-and long-term effects of suboptimal incubation temperatures on survival and physiological functions in zebra finches, eggs were incubated at 36.2, 37.4 or 38.4 degrees C for the entire incubation period. The post-hatch environment was identical among the treatment groups. We found that hatching success was lowest in the 38.4 degrees C group, while post-hatch survival was lowest in the 36.2 degrees C group. Incubation temperature had sex-specific effects on offspring phenotype: incubation temperatures affected body mass (M-b) but not physiological parameters of males and conversely, the physiological parameters but not M-b of females. Specifically, males from the 38.4 degrees C group weighed significantly less than males from the 36.2 degrees C group from the nestling period to adulthood, whereas females from different incubation temperature groups did not differ in M-b. In contrast, females incubated at 36.2 degrees C had transient but significantly elevated basal metabolic rate and adrenocortical responses during the nestling and fledgling periods, whereas no treatment effect was observed in males. Innate immunity was not affected by incubation temperature in either sex. These results suggest that a 1 degrees C deviation from what is considered an optimal incubation temperature can lower offspring performance and offspring survival.",2015,218,18,2847-2855
Early-life hypoxia alters adult physiology and reduces stress resistance and lifespan in <i>Drosophila</i>,"Polan, Danielle M. and Alansari, Mohammad and Lee, Byoungchun and Grewal, Savraj S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.226027,"In many animals, short-term fluctuations in environmental conditions in early life often exert long-term effects on adult physiology. In Drosophila, one ecologically relevant environmental variable is hypoxia. Drosophila larvae live on rotting, fermenting food rich in microorganisms, an environment characterized by low ambient oxygen. They have therefore evolved to tolerate hypoxia. Although the acute effects of hypoxia in larvae have been well studied, whether early-life hypoxia affects adult physiology and fitness is less clear. Here, we show that Drosophila exposed to hypoxia during their larval period subsequently show reduced starvation stress resistance and shorter lifespan as adults, with these effects being stronger in males. We find that these effects are associated with reduced whole-body insulin signaling but elevated TOR kinase activity, a manipulation known to reduce lifespan. We also identify a sexually dimorphic effect of larval hypoxia on adult nutrient storage and mobilization. Thus, we find that males, but not females, show elevated levels of lipids and glycogen. Moreover, we see that both males and females exposed to hypoxia as larvae show defective lipid mobilization upon starvation stress as adults. These data demonstrate how early-life hypoxia can exert persistent, sexually dimorphic, long-term effects on Drosophila adult physiology and lifespan.",2020,223,22,NA
Limits to sustained energy intake. XXXIII. Thyroid hormones play important roles in milk production but do not define the heat dissipation limit in Swiss mice,"Yang, Rui and Cao, Jing and Speakman, John R. and Zhao, Zhijun",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.245393,"The limits to sustained energy intake set physiological upper boundaries that affect many aspects of human and animal performance. The mechanisms underlying these limits, however, remain unclear. We exposed Swiss mice to either supplementary thyroid hormones (THs) or the inhibitor methimazole during lactation at 21 or 32.5 degrees C, and measured food intake, resting metabolic rate (RMR), milk energy output (MEO), serum THs and mammary gland gene expression of females, and litter size and mass of their offspring. Lactating females developed hyperthyroidism following exposure to supplementary THs at 21 degrees C, but they did not significantly change body temperature, asymptotic food intake, RMR or MEO, and litter and mass were unaffected. Hypothyroidism, induced by either methimazole or 32.5 degrees C exposure, significantly decreased asymptotic food intake, RMR and MEO, resulting in significantly decreased litter size and litter mass. Furthermore, gene expression of key genes in the mammary gland was significantly decreased by either methimazole or heat exposure, including gene expression of THs and prolactin receptors, and Stat5a and Stat5b. This suggests that endogenous THs are necessary to maintain sustained energy intake and MEO. Suppression of the thyroid axis seems to be an essential aspect of the mechanism by which mice at 32.5 degrees C reduce their lactation performance to avoid overheating. However, THs do not define the upper limit to sustained energy intake and MEO at peak lactation at 21 degrees C. Another, as yet unknown, factor prevents supplementary thyroxine exerting any stimulatory metabolic impacts on lactating mice at 21 degrees C.",2023,226,20,NA
Temperature effects on metabolic scaling of a keystone freshwater crustacean depend on fish-predation regime,"Glazier, Douglas S. and Gring, Jeffrey P. and Holsopple, Jacob R. and Gjoni, Vojsava",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.232322,"According to the metabolic theory of ecology, metabolic rate, an important indicator of the pace of life, varies with body mass and temperature as a result of internal physical constrains. However, various ecological factors may also affect metabolic rate and its scaling with body mass. Although reports of such effects on metabolic scaling usually focus on single factors, the possiblity of significant interactive effects between multiple factors requries further study. In this study, we show that the effect of temperature on the ontogenetic scaling of resting metabolic rate of the freshwater amphipod Gammams minus depends critically on habitat differences in predation regime. Increasing temperature tends to cause decreases in the metabolic scaling exponent (slope) in population samples from springs with fish predators, but increases in population samples from springs without fish. Accordingly, the temperature sensitivity of metabolic rate is not only size-specific, but also its relationship to body size shifts dramatically in response to fish predators. We hypothesize that the dampened effect of temperature on the metabolic rate of large adults in springs with fish, and of small juveniles in springs without fish are adaptive evolutionary responses to differences in the relative mortality risk of adults and juveniles in springs with versus without fish predators. Our results demonstrate a complex interaction among metabolic rate, body mass, temperature and predation regime. The intraspecific scaling of metabolic rate with body mass and temperature is not merely the result of physical constraints related to internal body design and biochemical kinetics, but rather is ecologically sensitive and evolutionarily malleable.",2020,223,21,NA
Effects of temperature on the timing of breeding and molt transitions in house finches,"Watts, Heather E. and Jimenez, Daniela and Pacheco, Veronica and Vilgalys, Tauras P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.185058,"Temperature-correlated shifts in reproductive timing are now well documented in numerous bird species. However, whether temperature directly influences reproductive timing or whether its effects are mediated by an intermediate environmental cue, such as plant phenology, remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the direct effects of temperature on reproductive timing in house finches (Haemorhous mexicanus), which have a range and breeding diet not well represented in previous studies of temperature and reproductive timing. We conducted experiments with captive male house finches in which temperature was elevated within realistic ranges and the effects on the timing of preparations for reproduction, as well as on the termination of reproduction and the onset of prebasic feather molt, were examined. We found no adjustments in the timing of reproductive preparations of males in direct response to temperature. However, elevated temperature did advance the breeding-molt transition. Our results suggest that elevated temperatures in the range tested here do not directly impact physiological preparations for reproduction in male house finches, but may constrain the timing of the breeding-molt transition in this species.",2018,221,18,NA

Sex ratio manipulation in birds is not widely documented, and revealing the mechanisms for altered sex ratios in vertebrates remains a compelling area of research. Incubation temperature is a key component of the developmental environment for birds, but despite its well-documented effects on offspring phenotype it has rarely been considered as a factor in avian sex ratios. Using ecologically relevant manipulations of incubation temperature within the range 35.0-37.0 degrees C, we found greater mortality of female embryos during incubation than males regardless of incubation temperature, and evidence that more female than male embryos die at the lowest incubation temperature (35.0 degrees C). Our findings in conjunction with previous work in brush turkeys suggest incubation temperature is an important determinant of avian secondary sex ratios that requires additional study, and should be considered when estimating the impact of climate change on avian populations.",2016,219,13,1961-1964
The freeze-avoiding mountain pine beetle (<i>Dendroctonus ponderosae</i>) survives prolonged exposure to stressful cold by mitigating ionoregulatory collapse,"Andersen, Mads Kuhlmann and Roe, Amanda Diane and Liu, Yuehong and Musso, Antonia E. and Fudlosid, Serita and Haider, Fouzia and Evenden, Maya L. and MacMillan, Heath A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.247498,"Insect performance is linked to environmental temperature, and surviving through winter represents a key challenge for temperate, alpine and polar species. To overwinter, insects have adapted a range of strategies to become truly cold hardy. However, although the mechanisms underlying the ability to avoid or tolerate freezing have been well studied, little attention has been given to the challenge of maintaining ion homeostasis at frigid temperatures in these species, despite this limiting cold tolerance for insects susceptible to mild chilling. Here, we investigated how prolonged exposure to temperatures just above the supercooling point affects ion balance in freeze-avoidant mountain pine beetle ( Dendroctonus ponderosae ) larvae in autumn, mid-winter and spring, and related it to organismal recovery times and survival. Hemolymph ion balance was gradually disrupted during the first day of exposure, characterized by hyperkalemia and hyponatremia, after which a plateau was reached and maintained for the rest of the 7-day experiment. The degree of ionoregulatory collapse correlated strongly with recovery times, which followed a similar asymptotical progression. Mortality increased slightly during extensive cold exposures, where hemolymph K + concentration was highest, and a sigmoidal relationship was found between survival and hyperkalemia. Thus, the cold tolerance of the freezeavoiding larvae of D. ponderosae appears limited by the ability to prevent ionoregulatory collapse in a manner similar to that of chill-susceptible insects, albeit at much lower temperatures. Based on these results, we propose that a prerequisite for the evolution of insect freeze avoidance may be a convergent or ancestral ability to maintain ion homeostasis during extreme cold stress.",2024,227,9,NA

Animals incubated at higher temperatures (33.5 degrees C) had, on average, one more stripe than those at lower temperatures (29.5 degrees C), and also had significantly lighter heads. These patterns were not affected by estradiol-induced sex reversal, suggesting independence from hatchling sex.

Here, we examined the cardiovascular responses to progressive hypoxia in four high-altitude Andean duck species compared with four related low-altitude populations in North America, tested at their native altitude. Ducks were exposed to stepwise decreases in inspired partial pressure of O-2 while we monitored heart rate, O-2 consumption rate, blood O-2 saturation, haematocrit (Hct) and blood haemoglobin (Hb) concentration. We calculated O-2 pulse (the product of stroke volume and the arterial-venous O-2 content difference), blood O-2 concentration and heart rate variability. Regardless of altitude, all eight populations maintained O-2 consumption rate with minimal change in heart rate or O-2 pulse, indicating that O-2 consumption was maintained by either a constant arterial-venous O-2 content difference (an increase in the relative O-2 extracted from arterial blood) or by a combination of changes in stroke volume and the arterial-venous O-2 content difference. Three high-altitude taxa (yellow-billed pintails, cinnamon teal and speckled teal) had higher Hct and Hb concentration, increasing the O-2 content of arterial blood, and potentially providing a greater reserve for enhancing O-2 delivery during hypoxia. Hct and Hb concentration between low- and high-altitude populations of ruddy duck were similar, representing a potential adaptation to diving life. Heart rate variability was generally lower in high-altitude ducks, concurrent with similar or lower heart rates than low-altitude ducks, suggesting a reduction in vagal and sympathetic tone. These unique features of the Andean ducks differ from previous observations in both Andean geese and bar-headed geese, neither of which exhibit significant elevations in Hct or Hb concentration compared with their low-altitude relatives, revealing yet another avian strategy for coping with high altitude.",2020,223,5,NA
Maternal provisioning and fluctuating thermal regimes enhance immune response in a reptile with temperature-dependent sex determination,"Leivesley, Jessica Alice and Rollinson, Njal",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.237016,"The Charnov-Bull model of differential fitness is often used to explain the evolution and maintenance of temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). Most tests of the model focus on morphological proxies of fitness, such as size traits, whereas early life physiological traits that are closely related to lifetime fitness might provide a framework for generalizing the Charnov-Bull model across taxa. One such trait is the strength of the early-life immune response, which is strongly linked to early-life survival and fitness. Here, we manipulated temperature, variance in temperature, and sex to test the Charnov-Bull model using a physiological trait, immune system strength, in the snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina). We found no evidence of sex-specific differences in bactericidal capacity of hatchling blood, and no evidence that mean temperature influences bactericidal capacity. However, we did find that fluctuating incubation temperature (i.e. a more naturalized incubation regime) is associated with a greater bactericidal capacity compared with constant temperature incubation. We also found that egg mass, a proxy for maternal provisioning, is positively associated with bactericidal capacity. Our findings suggest that the evolution of temperature-dependent sex determination in reptiles is unrelated to our measure of early-life innate immunity. Our study also underlines how immune response is condition dependent in early life, and questions the biological relevance of constant temperature incubation in experimental studies on ectotherm development.",2021,224,5,NA

As embryonic mortality at early stages mainly results from defects in cardiovascular development, we focused on heart formation and angiogenesis. We found that high-salt exposure enhanced the risk of abnormal heart tube looping and blood congestion in the heart chamber. In the presence of high salt, both ventricular cell proliferation and apoptosis increased. The high osmolarity induced by high salt in the ventricular cardiomyocytes resulted in incomplete differentiation, which might be due to reduced expression of Nkx2.5 and GATA4. Blood vessel density and diameter were suppressed by exposure to high salt in both the yolk sac membrane (YSM) and chorioallantoic membrane models. In addition, high-salt-induced suppression of angiogenesis occurred even at the vasculogenesis stage, as blood island formation was also inhibited by high-salt exposure. At the same time, cell proliferation was repressed and cell apoptosis was enhanced by high-salt exposure in YSM tissue. Moreover, the reduction in expression of HIF2 and FGF2 genes might cause high-salt-suppressed angiogenesis. Interestingly, we show that high-salt exposure causes excess generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the heart and YSM tissues, which could be partially rescued through the addition of antioxidants. In total, our study suggests that excess generation of ROS might play an important role in high-saltinduced defects in heart and angiogenesis.",2015,218,21,3468-3477
Effect of repeated freeze-thaw cycles on geographically different populations of the freeze-tolerant worm <i>Enchytraeus albidus</i> (Oligochaeta),"Fisker, Karina Vincents and Holmstrup, Martin and Malte, Hans and Overgaard, Johannes",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.105650,"Freeze-tolerant organisms survive internal ice formation; however, the adaptations to repeated freeze-thaw cycles are often not well investigated. Here we report how three geographically different populations of Enchytraeus albidus (Germany, Iceland and Svalbard) respond to three temperature treatments - constant thawed (0 degrees C), constant freezing (-5 degrees C) and fluctuating temperature (0 to -5 degrees C) over a period of 42 days. Survival varied between treatments and populations such that enchytraeids from arctic locations had a higher survival following prolonged freeze periods compared with temperate populations. However, enchytraeids from temperate locations had the same survival rate as arctic populations when exposed to repeated freeze-thaw events. Across all populations, metabolic rate decreased markedly in frozen animals (-5 degrees C) compared with thawed controls (0 degrees C). This decrease is likely due to the lower temperature of frozen animals, but also to the transition to the frozen state per se. Animals exposed to repeated freeze-thaw events had an intermediate metabolic rate and freeze-thaw events were not associated with pronounced excess energetic costs. Overwintering under either condition was not associated with a decrease in lipid content; however, during exposure to constant freezing and repeated freeze-thaw events there was a noticeable decrease in carbohydrate stores over time. Thus, animals exposed to constant freezing showed a decrease in glycogen stores, while both glucose and glycogen content decreased over time when the organisms were exposed to repeated freezing. The results therefore suggest that carbohydrate resources are important as a fuel for E. albidus during freezing whereas lipid resources are of marginal importance.",2014,217,21,3843-3852

In this experimental study, we exposed eels to different combinations of temperature (12-20 degrees C) and pressure (100-800 kPa) during long-term sustained swimming (32-47 days). Both temperature and pressure affected oxygen consumption rate, such that there was a significant increase of metabolic rate with temperature, whereas pressure reduced oxygen consumption, albeit only at higher temperatures. Average oxygen consumption rates ranged between 15 mg kg(-1) h(-1) (12 degrees C, 100 kPa) and 30.2 mg kg(-1) h(-1) (20 degrees C, 100 kPa), highlighting the remarkably high swimming efficiency of this species and, more importantly, indicating that past evaluations of the cost of transport are potentially overestimates as they are often based on experiments conducted at atmospheric pressure at higher temperatures.",2023,226,17,NA

Brevinin-1SY was predicted to be an amphipathic, hydrophobic, alpha helical peptide that inserts into a lipid bilayer. Brevinin-1SY transcripts were detected in tadpoles and were significantly increased during the later stages of development. Effects of environmental stress (24 h anoxia, 40\% dehydration or 24 h frozen) on the mRNA levels of brevinin-1SY in the dorsal and ventral skin were examined. The brevinin-1SY mRNA levels were increased in dorsal and ventral skin of dehydrated frogs, and in ventral skin of anoxic frogs, compared with controls (non-stressed). Brevinin-1SY protein levels in peptide extracts of dorsal skin showed a similar, but not significant, trend to that of brevinin-1SY mRNA levels. Antimicrobial activity of skin extracts from control and stressed animals were assessed for Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Botrytis cinerea, Rhizopus stolonifer and Pythium sulcatum using disk diffusion assays. Peptide extracts of dorsal skin from anoxic, frozen and dehydrated animals showed significantly higher inhibition of E. coli and P. sulcatum than from control animals.

"Effects of reproduction on immuno-suppression and oxidative damage, and hence support or otherwise for their roles as mechanisms underpinning life history trade-offs, are tissue and assay dependent","Yang, Deng-Bao and Xu, Yan-Chao and Wang, De-Hua and Speakman, John R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.092049,"Life history parameters appear to be traded off against each other, but the physiological mechanisms involved remain unclear. One hypothesis is that potentially energetically costly processes such as immune function and protection from oxidative stress may be compromised during reproductive attempts because of selective resource allocation. Lower temperatures also impose energy costs, and hence allocation decisions might be more pronounced when animals are forced to reproduce in the cold. Here, we experimentally tested whether reproduction at different ambient temperatures was associated with elevated oxidative stress and suppressed immune function in Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus). Using a variety of different markers for both immune function and oxidative stress, we found that some measures of immune function (serum bactericidal capacity and size of the thymus) were significantly suppressed, while some measures of oxidative protection {[}serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity] were also reduced, and a marker of oxidative damage (protein carbonyls in serum) was increased in lactating compared with non-reproductive gerbils. These changes were in line with the selective resource allocation predictions. However, the phytohaemagglutinin response and serum total immunoglobulin (IgG) were not suppressed, and other markers of oxidative damage {[}malondialdehyde (MDA) (TBARS) and protein carbonyls in the liver] were actually lower in lactating compared with non-reproductive gerbils, consistent with increased levels of SOD activity and total antioxidant capacity in the liver. These latter changes were opposite of the expectations based on resource allocation. Furthermore, other measures of protection (GPx levels in the liver and protein thiols in both serum and liver) and damage {[}MDA (TBARS) in serum] were unrelated to reproductive status. Ambient temperature differences did not impact on these patterns. Collectively, our results indicated that the inferred effects of reproduction on immunosuppression and oxidative damage, and hence support or otherwise for particular physiological mechanisms that underpin life history trade-offs, are critically dependent on the exact markers and tissues used. This may be because during reproduction individuals selectively allocate protection to some key tissues, but sacrifice protection of others.",2013,216,22,4242-4250
Timing of increased temperature sensitivity coincides with nervous system development in winter moth embryos,"van Dis, Natalie E. and van der Zee, Maurijn and Hut, Roelof A. and Wertheim, Bregje and Visser, Marcel E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.242554,"Climate change is rapidly altering the environment and many species will need to genetically adapt their seasonal timing to keep up with these changes. Insect development rate is largely influenced by temperature, but we know little about the mechanisms underlying the temperature sensitivity of development. Here, we investigate seasonal timing of egg hatching in the winter moth, one of the few species which has been found to genetically adapt to climate change, likely through selection on temperature sensitivity of egg development rate. To study when during development winter moth embryos are most sensitive to changes in ambient temperature, we gave eggs an increase or decrease in temperature at different moments during their development. We measured their developmental progression and time of egg hatching, and used fluorescence microscopy to construct a timeline of embryonic development for the winter moth. We found that egg development rate responded more strongly to temperature once embryos were in the fully extended germband stage. This is the phylotypic stage at which all insect embryos have developed a rudimentary nervous system. Furthermore, at this stage, timing of ecdysone signaling determines developmental progression, which could act as an environment dependent gateway. Intriguingly, this may suggest that, from the phylotypic stage onward, insect embryos can start to integrate internal and environmental stimuli to actively regulate important developmental processes. As we found evidence that there is genetic variation for temperature sensitivity of egg development rate in our study population, such regulation could be a target of selection imposed by climate change.",2021,224,17,NA

Fish were exposed to a stepwise decrease in air saturation (100\%, 20\%, 10\% and 5\%) for 2 h at each level, and sampled throughout the experiment. A flooding dose technique using a stable isotope allowed us to observe an overall decrease in protein synthesis during hypoxia in liver, muscle, gill and heart. We estimate that this decrease in rates of protein synthesis accounts for a 20 to 36\% decrease in metabolic rate, which would enable oscars to maintain stable levels of ATP and prolong survival. It was also determined for the first time in fish that a decrease in protein synthesis during hypoxia is likely controlled by signaling molecules (4EBP1 and eIF2-alpha), and not simply due to a lack of ATP.

Compared with controls (22 +/- 1 degrees C), there was an initial increase in the protein level of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase alpha (day 1), followed by an increase in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs): PPAR alpha and PPAR gamma from day 1 and PPAR delta from day 7 of cold acclimation. Activation of the PGC-1 alpha/PPAR transcription program was accompanied by increased protein expression of the key metabolic enzymes in beta-oxidation, the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, with the exceptions in complex I (no changes) and ATP synthase (decreased at day 1). Cold did not affect hexokinase and GAPDH protein levels, but increased lactate dehydrogenase activity compared with controls (1-45 days). L-arginine sustained, accelerated and/or intensified cold-induced molecular remodeling throughout cold acclimation. L-NAME exerted phase-dependent effects: similar to L-arginine in early cold acclimation and opposite after prolonged cold exposure (from day 21). It seems that upregulation of the PGC-1 alpha/PPAR transcription program early during cold acclimation triggers the molecular recruitment of skeletal muscle underlying the shift to more oxidative metabolism during prolonged cold acclimation. Our results suggest that nitric oxide has a role in maintaining the skeletal muscle oxidative phenotype in late cold acclimation but question its role early in cold acclimation.",2013,216,22,4233-4241

Using EPTs, we assess the relative thermal sensitivities of embryos of three species of freshwater snail with marked differences in their developmental event timings. Embryos of Lymnaea stagnalis, Radix balthica and Physella acuta were videoed hourly for the duration of their embryonic development at two temperatures: 20 \& DEG;C and 25 \& DEG;C. The video was used to calculate EPTs for the duration of their embryonic development, and during discrete physiological windows in development. Changes in energy spectra during development identified marked differences in thermal sensitivities between species, and suggest a relatively heightened sensitivity of gross rates of embryonic physiology and behaviour in embryos of R. balthica, developmental-window-specific thermal responses that reflect ontogenetic differences in observable physiologies, and temperature-induced changes in physiological event timing.

Activation of oxygen-responsive pathways is associated with altered protein metabolism in Arctic char exposed to hypoxia,"Cassidy, Alicia A. and Lamarre, Simon G.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.203901,"Fish exposed to fluctuating oxygen concentrations often alter their metabolism and/or behaviour to survive. Hypoxia tolerance is typically associated with the ability to reduce energy demand by supressing metabolic processes such as protein synthesis. Arctic char is amongst the most sensitive salmonid to hypoxia, and typically engage in avoidance behaviour when faced with lack of oxygen. We hypothesized that a sensitive species will still have the ability (albeit reduced) to regulate molecular mechanisms during hypoxia. We investigated the tissue-specific response of protein metabolism during hypoxia. Little is known about protein degradation pathways during hypoxia in fish and we predict that protein degradation pathways are differentially regulated and play a role in the hypoxia response. We also studied the regulation of oxygen-responsive cellular signalling pathways {[}hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), unfolded protein response (UPR) and mTOR pathways] since most of what we know comes from studies on cancerous mammalian cell lines. Arctic char were exposed to cumulative graded hypoxia trials for 3 h at four air saturation levels (100\%, 50\%, 30\% and 15\%). The rate of protein synthesis was measured using a flooding dose technique, whereas protein degradation and signalling pathways were assessed by measuring transcripts and phosphorylation of target proteins. Protein synthesis decreased in all tissues measured (liver, muscle, gill, digestive system) except for the heart. Salmonid hearts have preferential access to oxygen through a well-developed coronary artery, therefore the heart is likely to be the last tissue to become hypoxic. Autophagy markers were upregulated in the liver, whereas protein degradation markers were downregulated in the heart during hypoxia. Further work is needed to determine the effects of a decrease in protein degradation on a hypoxic salmonid heart. Our study showed that protein metabolism in Arctic char is altered in a tissue-specific fashion during graded hypoxia, which is in accordance with the responses of the three major hypoxia-sensitive pathways (HIF, UPR and mTOR). The activation pattern of these pathways and the cellular processes that are under their control varies greatly among tissues, sometimes even going in the opposite direction. This study provides new insights on the effects of hypoxia on protein metabolism. Adjustment of these cellular processes is likely to contribute to shifting the fish phenotype into a more hypoxia-tolerant one, if more than one hypoxia event were to occur. Our results warrant studying these adjustments in fish exposed to long-term and diel cycling hypoxia.",2019,222,22,NA
Complex response in size-related traits of bulb mites (<i>Rhizoglyphus robini</i>) under elevated thermal conditions - an experimental evolution approach,"Plesnar-Bielak, Agata and Jawor, Anna and Kramarz, Paulina E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.090951,"Temperature is a key environmental factor affecting almost all aspects of life history in ectotherms. Theory predicts that they grow faster, reach smaller sizes and produce smaller offspring when temperature increases. In addition, temperature changes, through their effects on metabolism, may also influence the expression of alternative reproductive phenotypes (ARPs) in ectotherms. Although many studies have investigated the phenotypic plasticity of life history traits in relation to temperature change, little is known about how those traits and phenotypic plasticity may evolve together. In our study we subjected bulb mites (non-model, soil organisms that normally experience rather stable thermal conditions) to experimental evolution in two temperature treatments: control (24 degrees C) and elevated (28 degrees C). After 18 generations, we measured adult body size, egg size and development time of both treatments at control as well as at elevated temperatures (test temperatures). Thus, we were able to detect genetic changes (the effects of selection temperature) and environmental effects (the effects of test temperature). We also observed the ARP expression throughout the experimental evolution. Our results revealed quite complex patterns of life history in traits response to temperature. Mites developed faster and reached smaller sizes at increased temperature, but evolutionary responses to increased temperature were not always parallel to the observed phenotypic plasticity. Additionally, despite smaller body sizes, females laid larger eggs at higher temperature. This effect was more pronounced in animals evolving at elevated temperature. Evolution at increased temperature also affected ARP expression, with the proportion of armored fighters decreasing from generation to generation. We propose that this could be the consequence of temperature sensitivity of the cost-to-benefits ratio of expressing ARPs.",2013,216,24,4542-4548
Exposure to fluctuating temperatures leads to reduced immunity and to stress response in rattlesnakes,"Fabricio-Neto, Ailton and Madelaire, Carla B. and Gomes, Fernando R. and Andrade, V, Denis",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.208645,"Ectothermic organisms often experience considerable variation in their body temperature throughout the circadian cycle. However, studies focusing on the measurement of physiological traits are usually performed under constant temperature regimes. This mismatch between thermal exposure in the field and experimental conditions could act as a stressor agent, as physiological functions are strongly influenced by temperature. Herein, we asked the question whether constant thermal regimes would cause a stress response and impact the immunity of the South American rattlesnake (Crotalus durissus) when compared with a fluctuating thermal regime. We addressed this question by determining heterophil:lymphocyte (H:L) ratio, plasma bacteria-killing ability (BKA) and corticosterone (CORT) levels in snakes kept under a constant temperature regime at 30 degrees C, and under a fluctuating regime that oscillated between 25 degrees C at night and 35 degrees C during the day. The experiments had a mirrored design, in which half of the snakes were subjected to a fluctuating-to-constant treatment, while the other half was exposed to a constant-to-fluctuating treatment. The shift from constant to fluctuating thermal regime was accompanied by an increase in plasma CORT levels, indicating the activation of a stress response. Exposure to a fluctuating thermal regime at the onset of the experiments induced a decrease in the BKA of rattlesnakes. H:L ratio was not affected by treatments and, therefore, the shift between thermal regimes seems to have acted as a low-intensity stressor. Our results suggest that removal from temperatures close to the snake's preferred body temperature triggers a stress response in rattlesnakes.",2019,222,22,NA
Early exposure to chronic hypoxia induces short- and long-term regulation of hemoglobin gene expression in European sea bass (<i>Dicentrarchus labrax</i>),"Cadiz, Laura and Servili, Arianna and Quazuguel, Patrick and Madec, Lauriane and Zambonino-Infante, Jose-Luis and Mazurais, David",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.160713,"European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) inhabits coastal waters and may be exposed to hypoxia at different life stages, requiring physiological and behavioral adaptation. In the present study, we attempted to determine whether regulation of hemoglobin (Hb) gene expression plays a role in the physiological response to chronic moderate hypoxia in whole larvae and hematopoietic tissues (head kidney and spleen) of juveniles. We also tested the hypothesis that hypoxia exposure at the larval stage could induce a long-term effect on the regulation of Hb gene expression. For this purpose, D. labrax were exposed to a non-lethal hypoxic condition (40\% air saturation) at the larval stage from 28 to 50 days post-hatching (dph) and/or at the juvenile stage from 196 to 296 dph. Data obtained from larvae indicate that hypoxia induced a subtype-specific regulation of Hb gene expression, with a significant decrease of MN-Hba3, MN-Hb beta 4 and MN-Hb beta 5 and increase of MN-Hb alpha 2, LA-Hb alpha 1 and LA-Hb beta 1 transcript levels. Hypoxia did not induce regulation of Hb gene expression in juveniles, except in the head kidney for those that experienced hypoxia at the larval stage. The latter exhibited a significant hypoxia-induced stimulation of MN-Hba2, LA-Hba1 and LA-Hb beta 1 gene expression, associated with stimulation of the PHD-3 gene involved in the hypoxia-inducible factor oxygen-sensing pathway. We conclude that subtype-and stage-specific regulation of Hb gene expression plays a role in the physiological response of D. labrax to cope with hypoxia and that early exposure to low oxygen concentration has a long-term effect on this response.",2017,220,17,3119-3126
Physiological responses and adjustments of corals to strong seasonal temperature variations (20-28°C),"Sawall, Yvonne and Nicosia, Anna M. and McLaughlin, Kathryn and Ito, Maysa",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.244196,"Temperature is a key driver of metabolic rates. So far, we know little about potential physiological adjustments of subtropical corals to seasonal temperature changes (>8 degrees C) that substantially exceed temperature fluctuation experienced by their counterparts in the tropics. This study investigated the effect of temperature reductions on Montastraea cavemosa and Ponies astreoides in Bermuda (32 degrees N; sea surface temperature similar to 19-29 degrees C) over 5 weeks, applying the following treatments: (i) constant control temperature at 28 degrees C, and (ii) temperature reduction (0.5 degrees C day(-1)) followed by constant temperature (20 days; acclimatization period) at 24 degrees C and (iii) at 20 degrees C. Both species decreased photosynthesis and respiration during temperature reduction as expected, which continued to decrease during the acclimatization period, indicating adjustment to a low energy turnover rather than thermal compensation. Trajectories of physiological adjustments and level of thermal compensation, however, differed between species. Montastraea cavemosa zooxanthellae metrics showed a strong initial response to temperature reduction, followed by a return to close to control values during the acclimatization period, reflecting a high physiological flexibility and low thermal compensation. Ponies astreoides zooxanthellae, in contrast, showed no initial response, but an increase in pigment concentration per zooxanthellae and similar photosynthesis rates at 24 degrees C and 20 degrees C at the end of the experiment, indicating low acute thermal sensitivity and the ability for thermal compensation at the lowest temperature. Respiration decreased more strongly than photosynthesis, leading to significant build-up of biomass in both species (energy reserves). Results are important in the light of potential poleward migration of corals and of potential latitudinal and species-specific differences in coral thermal tolerance.",2022,225,13,NA
"Diet and ambient temperature interact to shape plasma fatty acid composition, basal metabolic rate and oxidative stress in great tits","Andersson, Martin N. and Nilsson, Johan and Nilsson, Jan-Ake and Isaksson, Caroline",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.186759,"Diet and ambient temperature affect animal physiology, survival and reproductive success. However, knowledge of how these environmental factors interact to shape physiological processes and life-history traits of birds and other animals is largely lacking. By exposing adult great tits (Paws major) to two contrasting diets (saturated or unsaturated fatty acids; SFAs and UFAs, respectively) and ambient temperatures (3 degrees C versus 20 degrees C) that the birds encounter in nature, we investigated the effects of these two factors on several physiological parameters. Our results show that diet and ambient temperature interact to affect the composition of plasma fatty acids, basal metabolic rate (BMR) and oxidative stress, which are thought to affect the life-history and survival of individuals. Specifically, birds provided the SFA-rich diet had higher mass-specific BMR and oxidative stress (levels of lipid peroxidation) after exposure to low compared with high ambient temperature, whereas the opposite pattern was evident for birds with a UFA-rich diet. Surprisingly, birds on the SFA diet had higher relative levels of monounsaturated fatty acids compared with the UFA-fed birds at low ambient temperature, whereas the opposite, and expected, pattern was found at the high temperature. Although the present study focuses on the physiological implications of the dietxtemperature interaction, our results might also be important for the leading theories of ageing, which currently do not take interactions between environmental factors into account. In addition, the present results are important for wildlife management, especially with regards to anthropogenic feeding of wild animals across variable and changing climatic conditions.",2018,221,24,NA
Mild hypoxia exposure impacts peripheral serotonin uptake and degradation in Gulf toadfish (<i>Opsanus beta</i>),"Sebastiani, John and Sabatelli, Allyson and McDonald, M. Danielle",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.244064,"Plasma serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) homeostasis is maintained through the combined processes of uptake (via the 5-HT transporter SERT, and others), degradation (via monoamine oxidase, MAO) and excretion. Previous studies have shown that inhibiting SERT, which would inhibit 5-HT uptake and degradation, attenuates parts of the cardiovascular hypoxia reflex in gulf toadfish (Opsanus beta), suggesting that these 5-HT clearance processes may be important during hypoxia exposure. Therefore, the goal of this experiment was to determine the effects of mild hypoxia on 5-HT uptake and degradation in the peripheral tissues of toadfish. We hypothesized that 5-HT uptake and degradation would be upregulated during hypoxia, resulting in lower plasma 5-HT, with uptake occurring in the gill, heart, liver and kidney. Fish were exposed to normoxia (97.6\% O-2 saturation, 155.6 Torr) or 2 min, 40 min or 24 h mild hypoxia (50\% O-2 saturation, similar to 80 Torr), then injected with radiolabeled {[}H-3]5-HT before blood, urine, bile and tissues were sampled. Plasma 5-HT levels were reduced by 40\% after 40 min of hypoxia exposure and persisted through 24 h. 5-HT uptake by the gill was upregulated following 2 min of hypoxia exposure, and degradation in the gill was upregulated at 40 min and 24 h. Interestingly, there was no change in 5-HT uptake by the heart and degradation in the heart decreased by 58\% within 2 min of hypoxia exposure and by 85\% at 24 h. These results suggest that 5-HT clearance is upregulated during hypoxia and is likely driven, in part, by mechanisms within the gill and not the heart.",2022,225,13,NA
The relevance of vascular adjustments to hemodynamic control in the face of temperature change in Crotalus durissus,"Castro, Samanta A. and Prado, V, Joao and Wang, Tobias and Leite, Cleo A. C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.247724,"The presence of cardiac shunts in ectothermic tetrapods is thought to be consistent with active vascular modulations for proper hemodynamic support. Local control of blood flow modulates tissue perfusion and thus systemic conductance (Gsys) G sys ) is assumed to increase with body temperature (Tb) T b ) to accommodate higher aerobic demand. However, the general increase of G sys presses for a higher right-to-left (R-L) shunt, which reduces arterial oxygen concentration. In contrast, T b reduction leads to a G sys decrease and a left-to-right shunt, which purportedly increases pulmonary perfusion and plasma filtration in the respiratory area. This investigation addressed the role of compensatory vascular adjustments in the face of the metabolic alterations caused by T b change in the South American rattlesnake ( Crotalus durissus). ). Cardiovascular recordings were performed in decerebrated rattlesnake preparations at 10, 20 and 30 degrees C. The rise in T b increased metabolic demand, and correlated with an augmentation in heart rate. Although cardiac output increased, systemic stroke volume reduced while pulmonary stroke volume remained stable. Although that resulted in a proportionally higher increase in pulmonary blood flow, the R-L shunt was maintained. While the systemic compliance of large arteries was the most relevant factor in regulating arterial systemic blood pressure, peripheral conductance of pulmonary circulation was the major factor influencing the final cardiac shunt. Such dynamic adjustment of systemic compliance and pulmonary resistance for shunt modulation has not been demonstrated before and contrasts with previous knowledge on shunt control.",2024,227,15,NA
Metabolomic and transcriptomic responses of ticks during recovery from cold shock reveal mechanisms of survival,"Rosendale, Andrew J. and Leonard, Ryan K. and Patterson, Isaac W. and Arya, Thomas and Uhran, Melissa R. and Benoit, Joshua B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.236497,"Ticks are blood-feeding ectoparasites but spend most of their life off-host where they may have to tolerate low winter temperatures. Rapid cold hardening (RCH) is a process commonly used by arthropods, including ticks, to improve survival of acute low temperature exposure. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms in ticks associated with RCH, cold shock and recovery from these stresses. In the present study, we investigated the extent to which RCH influences gene expression and metabolism during recovery from cold stress in Dermacentor variabilis, the American dog tick, using a combined transcriptomics and metabolomics approach. Following recovery from RCH, 1860 genes were differentially expressed in ticks, whereas only 99 genes responded during recovery to direct cold shock. Recovery from RCH resulted in an upregulation of various pathways associated with ion binding, transport, metabolism and cellular structures seen in the response of other arthropods to cold. The accumulation of various metabolites, including several amino acids and betaine, corresponded to transcriptional shifts in the pathways associated with these molecules, suggesting congruent metabolome and transcriptome changes. Ticks, D. variabilis and Amblyomma maculatum, receiving exogenous betaine and valine demonstrated enhanced cold tolerance, suggesting cryoprotective effects of these metabolites. Overall, many of the responses during recovery from cold shock in ticks were similar to those observed in other arthropods, but several adjustments may be distinct from the responses in other currently examined taxa.",2022,225,8,NA
Different amplitudes of temperature fluctuation induce distinct transcriptomic and metabolomic responses in the dung beetle <i>Phanaeus vindex</i>,"Sheldon, Kimberly S. and Padash, Mojgan and Carter, Amanda W. and Marshall, Katie E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.233239,"Most studies exploring molecular and physiological responses to temperature have focused on constant temperature treatments. To gain a better understanding of the impact of fluctuating temperatures, we investigated the effects of increased temperature variation on Phanaeus vindex dung beetles across levels of biological organization. Specifically, we hypothesized that increased temperature variation is energetically demanding. We predicted that thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate and energetic reserves would be reduced with increasing fluctuation. To test this, we examined the responses of dung beetles to constant (20 degrees C), low fluctuation (20 +/- 5 degrees C), or high fluctuation (20 +/- 12 degrees C) temperature treatments using respirometry, assessment of energetic reserves and HPLC-MS-based metabolomics. We found no significant differences in metabolic rate or energetic reserves, suggesting increased fluctuations were not energetically demanding. To understand why there was no effect of increased amplitude of temperature fluctuation on energetics, we assembled and annotated a de novo transcriptome, finding non-overlapping transcriptomic and metabolomic responses of beetles exposed to different fluctuations. We found that 58 metabolites increased in abundance in both fluctuation treatments, but 15 only did so in response to high-amplitude fluctuations. We found that 120 transcripts were significantly upregulated following acclimation to any fluctuation, but 174 were upregulated only in beetles from the high-amplitude fluctuation treatment. Several differentially expressed transcripts were associated with post-translational modifications to histones that support a more open chromatin structure. Our results demonstrate that acclimation to different temperature fluctuations is distinct and may be supported by increasing transcriptional plasticity. Our results indicate for the first time that histone modifications may underlie rapid acclimation to temperature variation.",2020,223,23,NA
Insect herbivores can choose microclimates to achieve nutritional homeostasis,"Clissold, Fiona J. and Coggan, Nicole and Simpson, Stephen J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.078782,"The interaction between temperature and diet quality can affect the life history of ectotherms. The rate and ratio at which protein and carbohydrate are obtained from food are important aspects of diet quality, and insects have a well-developed capacity to adjust their feeding behaviour and post-ingestive physiology to regulate intake and allocation of these nutrients. If the supply of protein and carbohydrate varies with temperature (e.g. via effects on intake, digestion or metabolism), then herbivorous insects can use thermoregulatory behaviour to help achieve nutritional homeostasis. When fed the host grass Triticum aestivum, Locusta migratoria nymphs absorbed and allocated protein and carbohydrate to growth with the same efficiency at 38 degrees C as at 32 degrees C; however, at the higher temperature, they ingested more food. In contrast, when feeding on Themeda triandra, the nymphs absorbed carbohydrate with higher efficiency at 32 degrees C, and protein at 38 degrees C. Using synthetic diets, we induced either a protein or a carbohydrate deficiency in experimental insects and showed that locusts placed in a thermal gradient following a meal of T. triandra selected 32 degrees C when deprived of carbohydrate, and 38 degrees C when deprived of protein. This capacity to use thermoregulatory behaviour to redress an imposed nutritional imbalance improved with experience of feeding on T. triandra. As predicted, locusts fed T. aestivum always chose higher temperatures, irrespective of nutritional state. Our results have consequences for understanding host-plant choice by herbivores and interpreting the effects of changed environmental temperatures and microclimate on animal-plant interactions.",2013,216,11,2089-2096
Embryonic hypoxia programmes postprandial cardiovascular function in adult common snapping turtles (<i>Chelydra serpentina</i>),"Wearing, Oliver H. and Conner, Justin and Nelson, Derek and Crossley, Janna and Crossley, II, Dane A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.160549,"Reduced oxygen availability (hypoxia) is a potent stressor during embryonic development, altering the trajectory of trait maturation and organismal phenotype. We previously documented that chronic embryonic hypoxia has a lasting impact on the metabolic response to feeding in juvenile snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina). Turtles exposed to hypoxia as embryos {[}10\% O-2 (H10)] exhibited an earlier and increased peak postprandial oxygen consumption rate, compared with control turtles [}21\% O-2 (N21)]. In the current study, we measured central blood flow patterns to determine whether the elevated postprandial metabolic response in H10 turtles is linked to lasting impacts on convective transport. Five years after hatching, turtles were instrumented to quantify systemic (Q(sys)) and pulmonary (Q(pul)) blood flows and heart rate (f(H)) before and after a similar to 5\% body mass meal. In adult N21 and H10 turtles, f(H) was increased significantly by feeding. Although total stroke volume (V-S, (tot)) remained at fasted values, this tachycardia contributed to an elevation in total cardiac output (Q(tot)). However, there was a postprandial reduction in a net left-right (L-R) shunt in N21 snapping turtles only. Relative to N21 turtles, H10 animals exhibited higher Q(sys) due to increased blood flow through the right systemic outflow vessels of the heart. This effect of hypoxic embryonic development, reducing a net L-R cardiac shunt, may support the increased postprandial metabolic rate we previously reported in H10 turtles, and is further demonstration of adult reptile cardiovascular physiology being programmed by embryonic hypoxia.",2017,220,14,2589-2597
Shiver me titin! Elucidating titin's role in shivering thermogenesis,"Taylor-Burt, Kari R. and Monroy, Jenna and Pace, Cinnamon and Lindstedt, Stan and Nishikawa, Kiisa C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.111849,"Shivering frequency scales predictably with body mass and is 10 times higher in a mouse than a moose. The link between shivering frequency and body mass may lie in the tuning of muscle elastic properties. Titin functions as a muscle `spring', so shivering frequency may be linked to titin's structure. The muscular dystrophy with myositis (mdm) mouse is characterized by a deletion in titin's N2A region. Mice that are homozygous for the mdm mutation have a lower body mass, stiffer gait and reduced lifespan compared with their wild-type and heterozygous siblings. We characterized thermoregulation in these mice by measuring metabolic rate and tremor frequency during shivering. Mutants were heterothermic at ambient temperatures of 20-37 degrees C while wild-type and heterozygous mice were homeothermic. Metabolic rate increased at smaller temperature differentials (i.e. the difference between body and ambient temperatures) in mutants than in non-mutants. The difference between observed tremor frequencies and shivering frequencies predicted by body mass was significantly larger for mutant mice than for wild-type or heterozygous mice, even after accounting for differences in body temperature. Together, the heterothermy in mutants, the increase in metabolic rate at low temperature differentials and the decreased tremor frequency demonstrate the thermoregulatory challenges faced by mice with the mdm mutation. Oscillatory frequency is proportional to the square root of stiffness, and we observed that mutants had lower active muscle stiffness in vitro. The lower tremor frequencies in mutants are consistent with reduced active muscle stiffness and suggest that titin affects the tuning of shivering frequency.",2015,218,5,694+

Neither RDH nor RCH improved survival in response to lethal cold stress, but male activity and mating success following sublethal cold exposure were enhanced. Egg viability decreased following direct exposure of the mating males to sublethal cold but improved following RCH and RDH. Sublethal cold exposure reduced the expression of four accessory gland proteins, while expression remained high in males exposed to RCH.

"Low temperature tolerance, cold hardening and acclimation in tadpoles of the neotropical tungara frog (<i>Engystomops pustulosus</i>)","Vo, Pacific and Gridi-Papp, Marcos",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.03.012,"Many frogs from temperate climates can tolerate low temperatures and increase their thermal tolerance through hardening and acclimation. Most tropical frogs, on the other hand, fail to acclimate to low temperatures. This lack of acclimation ability is potentially due to lack of selection pressure for acclimation because cold weather is less common in the tropics. We tested the generality of this pattern by characterizing the critical temperature minimum (CTMin), hardening, and acclimation responses of tungara frogs (Engystomops pustulosus). These frogs belong to a family with unknown thermal ecology. They are found in a tropical habitat with a highly constant temperature regime. The CTMin of the tadpoles was on average 12.5 degrees C. Pre-metamorphic tadpoles hardened by 1.18 degrees C, while metamorphic tadpoles hardened by 0.36 degrees C. When raised at 21 degrees C, tadpoles acclimated expanding their cold tolerance by 1.3 degrees C in relation to larvae raised at 28 degrees C. These results indicate that the tungara frog has a greatly reduced cold tolerance when compared to species from temperate climates, but it responds to cold temperatures with hardening and acclimation comparable to those of temperate-zone species. Cold tolerance increased with body length but cold hardening was more extensive in pre-metamorphic tadpoles than in metamorphic ones. This study shows that lack of acclimation ability is not general to the physiology of tropical anurans.",2017,66,NA,49-55

In total, 127 differentially expressed proteins were identified; most of the upregulated proteins were involved in protein metabolic processes and responses to stimuli, whereas most of the downregulated proteins were related to oxidation reduction. Pathway analysis indicated that 3 upregulated heat stress proteins (HSP90a, HSP90 beta, and endoplasmin) were enriched in the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, whereas several downregulated NADH dehydrogenase proteins were involved in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. The protein protein interaction network indicated that several upregulated HSP5 (HSP90a, HSP90 beta, and GRP78) were involved in more interactions than other proteins and were thus considered as central hub nodes.

Exposure time of heat was 7 h per day for 60 days. Results reveal that the relative weights of testes, epididymis, vas deferens and seminal vesicles were hardly affected by the temperature levels considered (P > 0.05). The mass and individual sperm motility was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in cavies exposed to the temperature of 35 and 45 degrees C as compared with those which received GLEO and controls. The percentages of abnormal sperm and altered sperm DNA were higher in animals expbsed to temperature of 35 and 45 degrees C as compared with the controls. The activity of superoxide dismutase significantly increased (P < 0.05) in animals exposed to temperature of 45 degrees C and in those of 45 degrees C and orally treated with GLEO, compared with cavies exposed to temperature of 45 degrees C without receiving GLEO. The level of malondialdehyde was significantly increased (P < 0.05) in animals exposed to temperature of 35 and 45 degrees C, whereas the level of nitric oxide was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in exposed animals as compared with controls.

Aerial hypercarbia decreased branchial (V) over dot O-2 whereas branchial (V) over dotCO(2) was significantly increased. Progressive increases in aquatic hypercarbia did not affect f(G). This response is in contrast to increases in pulmonary ventilation that may offset any increase in arterial partial pressure of CO2 owing to CO2 loading through the animals' branchial surface. Thus, despite their reduced contribution to total gas exchange, cutaneous and branchial gas exchange in L. paradoxa can be significantly affected by temperature and aerial hypercarbia.",2017,63,NA,112-118
Effect of cyclical cold stress during embryonic development on aspects of physiological responses and HSP70 gene expression of chicks,"Aminoroaya, Keyvan and Sadeghi, Ali Asghar and Ansari-pirsaraei, Zarbakht and Kashan, Nasser",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.08.008,"The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of cyclical lower incubation temperature at different embryonic ages on the hatchability, body and organs weights, thyroid hormones, and liver HSP70 gene expression of newly hatched chicks. In a completely randomized design, fertile eggs of a broiler breeder (34 weeks of age) were assigned to three treatment groups with six replicates and 145 eggs per each. The treatment groups were as: control group (C) that eggs were incubated at 37.6 degrees C during the whole incubation period; incubation temperature was decreased to 36 degrees C for 3 h per day at embryonic age from 12 to 14 (T1); and incubation temperature was decreased to 36 degrees C for 3 h per day at embryonic age from 15 to 17 (12). No significant difference was found among treatments for hatchability (P > 0.05). There were no differences (P > 0.05) among treatments for body weight and liver weight, while heart weight of chicks in T1 and T2 groups were significantly higher than the control group (P < 0.05). There were no differences (P > 0.05) among treatments for the levels of thyroid hormones, however, the levels of both hormones tended to increase in chicks exposed to cold stress (T1 and 12). Chicks in T2 group had higher liver HSP70 gene expression compared with those in Tl and the control group (P < 0.05). Cold stress in both incubation periods had no significant effect on the plasma levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. Treatments had no effect on the plasma levels of glucose, cholesterol and triglyceride. The results of this study suggest that cyclical lower incubation temperatures (36 degrees C) at the embryonic age from day 15-17 could induce the liver HSP70 gene expression, without negative effects on the hatchability and body weight of hatched chicks.

"Altitudinal variation in lifespan of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> populations from the Firtina Valley, northeastern Turkey","Ayhan, Nazli and Gueler, Pinar and Onder, Banu Sebnem",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.09.002,"Studies of attitudinal changes in phenotype and genotype can complement studies of latitudinal patterns and provide evidence of natural selection in response to climatic factors. In Drosophila melanogaster, latitudinal variation in phenotype and genotype has been well studied, but attitudinal patterns have rarely been investigated. We studied populations from six different altitudes varying between 35 m and 2173 m in the Firtina Valley in northeastern part of Turkey to evaluate clinal trends in lifespan under experimental conditions. Lifespan in the D. melanogaster populations was examined in relation to altitude, sex, temperature (25 degrees C and 29 degrees C), and dietary yeast concentration (5 g/L and 25 g/L). As expected high temperature decrease lifespan in all populations. However, it was shown that lifespan was slightly affected by dietary stress. We found that lifespan decreases significantly under thermal stress conditions with increasing altitude. Moreover, there was a slightly negative relationship between altitude and lifespan, which was closely associated with climatic factors such as temperature and precipitation, may suggest local adaptation to climate.

"Effect of prenatal temperature conditioning of laying hen embryos: Hatching, live performance and response to heat and cold stress during laying period","Kamanli, S. and Durmus, I. and Yalcin, S. and Yildirim, U. and Meral, O.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2015.04.001,"This study was designed to determine the effect of prenatal temperature conditioning on hatching and live performance of laying chickens, and response to heat and cold stress during laying period. A total of 3600 eggs obtained from ATAK-S brown parent stock were incubated at control (37.5 degrees C, CONT-Inc), cyclic low (36.5 degrees C/6 h/d from 10 to 18 d of incubation, LOW-Inc) or high (38.5 degrees C/6 h/d from 10-18 d of incubation, HIGH-Inc) incubation temperatures. Hatched chicks per incubation temperature were reared under standard rearing conditions up to 26 wk. From 27 to 30 wk, hens from each incubation temperature were divided into 3 environmentally controlled rooms and reared at control (20 +/- 2 degrees C, CONT-Room), low (12 +/- 2 degrees C, COLDS) or high (32 +/- 2 degrees C, HEATS) temperatures. Hatching performance, body weight, egg production, and plasma triiodothyronine (T-3) and thyroxine (T-4) levels and oxidant and antioxidant activities were evaluated. The highest hatchability was for LOW-Inc chicks while HIGH-Inc chick had similar hatchability to CONT-Inc. There was no effect of incubation temperatures on plasma MDA, GSH-Px, activities and T-4 concentrations on day of hatch. LOW- Inc chicks had higher SOD activities and T-3 concentrations compared to the other groups. Although chick weight was similar among incubation temperature groups, CONT-Inc chicks were heavier than those cyclic incubation temperature groups until 12 wk of age. Incubation temperature had no effect on sexual maturity age and weight and egg production of laying hens. From 27 to 30 wk, regardless of incubation temperature, HEATS hens lost weight from day 0 to 10, had the highest cloacal temperatures and lowest feed consumption and egg production while COLDS hens had the lowest cloacal temperatures. At day 5, 14 level was higher in LOW-Inc hens at COLDS but it was higher in HIGH-Inc hens at HEATS compared to CONT-Inc. These data may suggest a modification in thyroid activity of hens that were conditioned during the incubation period. Moreover under COLDS condition, SOD production of LOW-Inc hens was higher than those of CONT- and HIGH-Inc hens indicating an induction in antioxidant enzyme activity. Nonetheless, prenatal temperature conditioning of laying hen embryos had no advantage on laying performance of hens under temperature stress conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Role of BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels in vascular smooth muscle during the development of environmental cold-induced hypertension,"Wang, Yunxia and Zhang, Shuhua and Ge, Yuzhi and Liu, Yanfeng and Yang, Dongmei and Luo, Jun and Wu, Zhiting",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2013.01.001,"Background: Cold is an important factor contributing to the high incidence of hypertension. Large conductance calcium-activated potassium (BKCa) channels modulate vascular smooth muscle tone. The objective of this study is to determine whether BKCa channels in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) play a role in the development of hypertension during chronic exposure to cold. Methods: Forty-eight rats were divided into cold-treated group and control group randomly, and then, rats of cold-treated group were exposed to 4 +/- 1 degrees C (4 h/day) and rats of another group were kept at 25 +/- 1 degrees C. Results: Compared to control group, systolic blood pressure of the rats exposed to cold for 2, 4, 6, 8 weeks were increased by 7.14\%, 20.42\%, 40.54\%, 28.74\%, respectively. The BKCa current and BKCa peak current density in aortic VSMC increased significantly as the time of exposure to cold went until the 6th week exposure to cold. At the 6th weeks, the BKCa peak current density in the cold exposed group compared to the control group were increased 345.21\% (n=6, P < 0.01). Furthermore, the expression of BKCa channel alpha-subunit mRNA in the cold-treated rats was higher than control (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Our data showed that BKCa channels have apparent change with the development of hypertension during repeated cold exposure, suggesting that BKCa channel could be thought as a new target for prevention and treating cold-induced hypertension.

Effect of salinity and temperature on the expression of genes involved in branchial ion transport processes in European sea bass,"Masroor, Waliullah and Farcy, Emilie and Blondeau-Bidet, Eva and Venn, Alexander and Tambutte, Eric and Lorin-Nebel, Catherine",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102422,"The responses of European sea bass to temperature increase and salinity decrease were investigated measuring mRNA expression levels of main genes involved in ion transport. Juvenile fish were pre-acclimated to seawater (SW) at 18 degrees C (temperate) or 24 degrees C (warm) for two weeks and then transferred for two weeks to either fresh water (FW) or SW at the respective temperature. Unlike temperate conditions, there is no change in Na+/K+-ATPase ala (nka ala) and Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (nhe3) mRNA expression following FW transfer in warm conditions. This is linked to the high expression of these genes in warm SW compared to temperate SW. Na+/Cl--cotransporter (ncc2a) expression however is increased following FW transfer in temperate and warm conditions. Main transporters involved in ion excretion (Na+/K+/2Cl-1( )cotransporter, nkcc1 and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, cftr) as well as nitrogen excretion (Rh-glycoproteins, rhcg1 and rhbg) and acid-base regulation (V-H+-ATPase, vha-a and b) are highly expressed in SW warm conditions vs FW warm. Overall, our results suggest a higher activation of ion transport processes in warm conditions and more strikingly in SW. This is linked to a strong interplay between diverse ion transporters in order to coordinate physiological responses at the gill level.",2019,85,NA,NA
Effect of temperature on survival and cuticular composition of three different ant species,"Duarte, Bianca F. and Michelutti, Kamylla B. and Antonialli-Junior, William F. and Cardoso, Claudia A. L.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.02.005,"Climatic factors, such as temperature variation, interfere with the survival of insects. To respond to these variations, insects have some specific characteristics. These include water content of the body, thickness of the lipid layer, as well as the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of cuticular chemical components. This study hypothesizes that different ant species respond to temperature changes in different ways and that such differences may be associated with cuticle hydrocarbons (CHCs) and fatty acids. As model ant species, Atta sexdens, Odontomachus bauri and Ectatomma brunneum were used for experimental analyses. Ants were submitted to a water bath for 5 h at different temperatures, and their CHCs and fatty acids were identified and quantified, followed by correlating these chemical compounds with temperature variations and the survival. Temperatures below 30 degrees C did not affect the survival of the three species. E. brunneum had a higher percentage of survival at temperatures above 30 degrees C. O. bauri was .the most sensitive species with 100\% mortality at 40 degrees C. Survival was found to be unrelated to any of the identified fatty acids. However, CHCs underwent significant quantitative and qualitative variation, as shown by an increased percentage of CHCs with longer chain length of linear alkanes at temperatures above 30 degrees C. These increase enables these ants to maintain the integrity of their cuticle and survive at temperatures above 30 degrees C. It can be concluded that the forager ants studied respond differently to temperature variation and that changes in the conformation of CHCs are in line with the ecological characteristics of the different studied species because, they vary in terms of diumal/noctumal foraging and types of environments foraged. Among the three species, E. brunneum foragers were found to be more active under adverse conditions and more tolerant to temperature variation with the correspondingly appropriate changes in CHCs composition.",2019,80,NA,178-189

Seven hundred and twenty fishes were randomly distributed in three different thermal groups each with three replicates. The thermal groups were ambient temperature (26 degrees C), 34 and 38 degrees C. Then each thermal groups were fed with four different formulated diets containing 0. 0.36\%, 0.72\% and 1.44\% TRP. The effect of dietary TRP supplementation was studied on stress responses, such as cortisol, blood glucose, histopathological changes in liver and kidney and immuno-hematological changes such as red blood cell count (RBC), haemoglobin (Hb), white blood cell count (WBC), lysozyme, nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT), total serum protein, albumin, globulin and albumin globulin ratio. Subsequently the treated fish were subjected to challenge test with Aeromonas hydrophila. In the present study, primary stress markers were noticeably (p < 0.01) elevated with temperature stress and levels were reduced with nutritional supplementation of TRP. Similarly, immuno-hematological parameters were altered with the exposure of temeparture stress and got improved with dietary TRP supplementation. Results of the present study suggest that dietary supplementation of 1.44\% tryptophan has definitive role in the mitigation of temperature stress and gives protection against bacterial infection to L. rohita.",2018,74,NA,55-62

The ratio of slow and fast developers within an egg batch differed with thermal extremes irrespective of Fl and F15 generations. Adult body mass got depressed after selection for control slow developers at 15 degrees C while it got enhanced for selected fast developers at 35 degrees C. More selected slow developers were found at low temperature and more selected fast developers at high temperature. Selection probably favours the enhancement of immature survival and emergence ratio which was found to be highest for selected fast developers at 35 degrees C and selected slow developers at 15 degrees C. Population level disparity on thermal confliction was observed in ladybird post selection over several generations. Therefore, we put forward that exposure thermal extremes over a long duration, causes an adaptive differentiation in thermal responses of slow and fast developers.",2017,69,NA,275-280

Objectives were to determine the effects of rapid cooling on thermal response and future reproductive success in pigs. Thirty-six replacement gifts (137.8 +/- 0.9 kg BW) were estrus synchronized and then 14.1 +/- 0.4 d after estrus confirmation, pigs were exposed to thermoneutral conditions (TN; n=12; 19.7 +/- 0.9 degrees C) for 6 h, or HS (36.3 +/- 0.5 degrees C) for 3 h, followed by 3 h of rapid cooling (HSRC; n=12; immediate TN exposure and water dousing) or gradual cooling (HSGC; n=12; gradual decrease to TN conditions) repeated over 2 d. Vaginal (T-V) and gastrointestinal tract temperatures (T-GI) were obtained every 15 min, and blood was collected on d 1 and d 2 during the HS and recovery periods at 180 and 60 min, respectively. Pigs were bred 8.3 +/- 0.8 d after thermal treatments over 2 d. Reproductive tracts were collected and total fetus number and viability were recorded 28.0 +/- 0.8 d after insemination. HS increased T-V and T-GI (P=0.01; 0.98 degrees C) in HSRC and HSGC compared to TN pigs. During recovery, T-V was reduced from 15 to 105 min (P=0.01; 033 degrees C) in HSRC compared to HSGC pigs, but no overall differences in T-GI were detected (P<0.05; 39.67 degrees C).

The multiple stressor experiment was conducted in twenty-four ewes (12 Santa Ines and 12 Morada Nova ewes). Both heat stress and pregnancy stress was common to all four groups. However, the animals were divided into further two groups within each breed on the basis of nutrition regimen. According the groupings were: Group 1 (Six Santa Ines ewes; heat stress; nutrition at 0.5\% of BW; single pregnancy); Group 2 (Six Santa Ines ewes; heat stress; nutrition at 1.5\% BW; twin pregnancy); groups Group 3 (Six Morada Nova ewes; heat stress; nutrition at 0.5\% of BW; single pregnancy); Group 4 (Six Morada Nova ewes; heat stress; nutrition at 1.5\% BW; twin pregnancy). All the animals in the experiment were pregnant. Heat stress was induced by exposing all animals to summer heat stress in outside environment while the nutritional regimen followed was at 0.5\% and 1.5\% level of body weight (BW) respectively in each breed. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design with two breeds, two nutritional treatments and two pregnancy types, 10 repetitions for physiological parameters and six for blood parameters, with repeated measures over time. Physiological parameters (respiratory rate, pulse rate and rectal temperature) were measured with the animals at rest in the morning and afternoon, 0600-0700 and 1300-1400 h, respectively, every seven days. Blood samples were collected every 14 d for determination of serum glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, urea and creatinine. We found interaction effect between breed and pregnancy type on respiratory rate and rectal temperature with greater values in Santa Ines ewes than Morada Nova ewes. However, there was no significant fixed effect of pregnancy type and supplementation level on physiological responses of breeds. Environmental factor (period of the day) had influenced the physiological responses of ewes during all gestational period. Santa Ines ewes had greater serum glucose concentration at 105 d and 120 d of gestation compared to the Morada Nova ewes. Morada Nova ewes had greater concentrations of triglycerides, urea at 120 d, 150 d and also greater cholesterol at 105 d, 135 d and 150 d of gestation compared with Santa Ines ewes.

The results demonstrated that cold stress remarkably disrupted the energy homeostasis of O. macrolepis, then the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) could strategically mobilize carbohydrates and lipids. In particular, when the O. macrolepis were faced with cold stress, the lipolysis was stimulated along with the enhanced fatty acid beta-oxidation for energy, while the fatty acid synthesis was supressed in the early stage. Additionally, the fatty acid composition analysis suggested that saturated fatty acid (SFA) might accumulate while monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) in storage lipids (mainly containing non-polar lipid, NPL) could be utilized to supply energy during cold acclimation. Altogether, this study may provide some meritorious for understanding the cold-tolerant mechanism of fish in the viewpoint of energy balance combined with fatty acid metabolism, and thus to contribute to this species rearing in fish farms in the future.",2020,94,NA,NA

However, little is known about the effect of heat stress on the antioxidant responses of Araneae species. Hylyphantes graminicola is a dominant predator in many cropping systems in China. In the present study, the effect of short-term heat stress (36, 38, 40 or 42 degrees C) on the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, the activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase {[}SOD], catalase {[}CAT], peroxidases {[}POD] and glutathione-S-transferases GST]), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations and survival of H. graminicola spiderlings and adults were investigated. The results showed that H. graminicola adults had a significantly higher survival rate compared to spiderlings at 40 degrees C. The heat stress increased ROS contents in H. graminicola. The SOD, CAT, POD and GST activities increased in spiderlings and adults under heat stress. These data suggest a defensive function for these enzymes in alleviating oxidative damage. Specifically, SOD plays a key role in reducing the high level of superoxide radicals in spiderlings and adults. Moreover, the POD and CAT capabilities for scavenging H2O2 in spiderlings were similar, and CAT may play a more important role than POD in scavenging H2O2 in adults at 42 degrees C. The spiderling TAC increased significantly at 40 and 42 degrees C, and the adult TAC was stable at 36-40 degrees C but decreased at 42 degrees C.

We then used larvae of the brown tree frog Polypedates megacephalus as a model amphibian to further investigate growth, oxygen consumption rate and heat shock protein expression with changes in thermal regime. We found that G. affinis was the most tolerant of low temperatures but also the least tolerant of high temperatures. Despite the higher thermal tolerance of the amphibian larvae, further investigation on P. megacephalus demonstrated that optimal temperatures for physiological performance fall within a range of 18.0-21.6 degrees C, which is far lower than its upper thermal limit, implying that thermal stress occurs during part of the larval stage under natural environmental conditions. This could mean a reduction in their capacity to deal with other stressors such as pollution and predators, and that G. affinis may have an advantage over native amphibians.",2019,81,NA,154-161

The mRNA transcripts of both genes were quantified after copepods at a salinity of 20 underwent an acclimation process involving an initial acclimation temperature of 29 degrees C, followed by gradual thermal ramping to the target exposure temperature range of 24-36 degrees C. The respective cellular HSR and organismal metabolism, measured by respiratory activity at exposure temperatures, were compared. The fold change in mRNA expression for both hsp70 and hsp90 (8-9 fold) peaks at 32 degrees C, which is very close to 32.4 degrees C, the upper thermal optimum for respiration in the species. Unexpectedly, the modelled HSR curves peak at only 3 degrees C (hsp90) and 3.5 degrees C (hsp70) above the mean water temperature (29.32 degrees C) of the copepod in the field. We propose that copepods in tropical waters adopt a preparative HSR strategy, early at the upper limit of its thermal optimum, due to the narrow thermal range of its habitat thus precluding substantial energy demand at higher temperatures. However, the model suggests that the species could survive to at least 36 degrees C with short acclimation time. Nevertheless, the significant overlap between its thermal range of lisp synthesis and the narrow temperature range of its habitat also suggests that any unprecedented rise in sea temperature would have a detrimental effect on the species.",2018,74,NA,14-22

We found that: (1) for eggs at a given embryonic stage at ovipositon, the mean rather than the variance of incubation temperatures determined the length of incubation; (2) most (egg mass, embryonic stage at oviposition, incubation length and all examined hatchling traits except tail length and locomotor performance) of the examined variables were affected by clutch; and (3) body mass was the only hatchling trait that differed among the five treatments, but the differences were tiny. These findings suggest that incubation temperature fluctuation has no direct role in influencing incubation length and hatchling phenotype in P. chinensis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Behavioural thermoregulation hastens spring mating activity in <i>Pyrrhocoris apterus</i> (Heteroptera: Pyrrhocoridae),"Honek, Alois and Martinkova, Zdenka",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.013,"Post-diapause, overwintered adults of the true bug Pyrrhocoris apterus L. (Heteroptera, Pyrrhocoridae) form conspicuous aggregations at warm spots in early spring. Using a combination of laboratory experiments and field observations, we assessed the influence of this behaviour on the seasonal timing of reproduction. In the laboratory, post-diapause pairs mated after an accumulation of 80 degrees days (dd), and females started to lay eggs after an additional 80 dd (considering 10.3 degrees C as a lower temperature threshold for post-diapause development). In the field, however, females mated as early as late March (based on data from four seasons), which corresponded to the accumulation of < 15 dd (based on summing the temperatures recorded at a meteorology station). Such a `discrepancy' between laboratory and field data is explained by thermoregulation. Aggregated adults bask in sunny spots, thereby increasing their body temperatures to similar to 25 degrees C, which is 7-16 degrees C above the temperature of the surrounding ground. This thermal excess speeds up their post-diapause development and enables early mating and oviposition. As a result, behavioural thermoregulation hastens the seasonal start of reproduction in P. apterus by > 1 month.",2019,84,NA,185-189
Discovering divergence in the thermal physiology of intertidal crabs along latitudinal gradients using an integrated approach with machine learning,"Osores, Sebastian J. A. and Ruz, Gonzalo A. and Opitz, Tania and Lardies, Marco A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.09.016,"In intertidal marine crustaceans, phenotypic variation in physiological and life-history traits is pervasive along latitudinal dines. However, organisms have complex phenotypes, and their traits do not vary independently but rather interact differentially between them, effect that is caused by genetic and/or environmental forces. We evaluated the geographic variation in phenotypic integration of three marine crab species that inhabit different vertical thermal microhabitats of the intertidal zone. We studied seven populations of each species along a latitudinal gradient that spans more than 3000 km of the Chilean coast. Specifically we measured nine physiological traits that are highly related to thermal physiology. Of the nine traits, we selected four that contributed significantly to the observed geographical variation among populations; this variation was then evaluated using mixed linear models and an integrative approach employing machine learning. The results indicate that patterns of physiological variation depend on species vertical microhabitat, which may be subject to chronic or acute environmental variation. The species that inhabit the high- intertidal sites (i.e., exposed to chronic variation) better tolerated thermal stress compared with populations that inhabit the lower intertidal. While those in the low-intertidal only face conditions of acute thermal variation, using to a greater extent the plasticity to face these events. Our main results reflect that (1) species that inhabit the high-intertidal maintain a greater integration between their physiological traits and present lower plasticity than those that inhabit the low-intertidal. (2) Inverse relationship that exists between phenotypic plasticity and phenotypic integration of the physiological traits identified, which could help optimize energy resources. In general, the study of multiple physiological traits provides a more accurate picture of how the thermal traits of organisms vary along temperature gradients especially when exposed to conditions close to tolerance limits.",2018,78,NA,140-150

Larvae and juveniles were reared at temperatures of 23, 26, 29 and 32 degrees C for 15 and 35 days, respectively. The larvae were fed Anemia nauplii, while the juveniles received a formulated diet. In both stages, high temperatures resulted in increased fiber diameter of white muscle. Moreover, a pronounced effect of hypertrophy was observed in later stages of development. No alterations to minimum fiber diameter, and similar mosaic standards of muscle growth dynamics, were observed in larvae kept at 23-32 degrees C, suggesting that hyperplasia was not effected during early stages of development. Gills were analyzed by Degree of Tissue Change (DTC), which is based on the severity of lesions. Significant morphological changes were observed in gills when juveniles were kept at 32 degrees C, which was considered moderate tissue damage. Temperature modulates cellularity in L. alexandri larvae and juveniles, with pronounced alterations of hypertrophy of white muscle fibers in later stages of development when exposed to elevated temperatures. Higher temperatures may also induce muscle growth dynamics with increased recruitment of new white fiber, increased fiber diameter in the early stages and induced gill lesions.",2018,76,NA,80-88
Geographic variation in responses of European yellow dung flies to thermal stress,"Bauerfeind, Stephanie S. and Sorensen, Jesper G. and Loeschcke, Volker and Berger, David and Broder, E. Dale and Geiger, Madeleine and Ferrari, Manuela and Blanckenhorn, Wolf U.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.01.002,"Climatic conditions can be very heterogeneous even over small geographic scales, and are believed to be major determinants of the abundance and distribution of species and populations. Organisms are expected to evolve in response to the frequency and magnitude of local thermal extremes, resulting in local adaptation. Using replicate yellow dung fly (Scathophaga stercoraria; Diptera: Scathophagidae) populations from cold (northern Europe) and warm climates (southern Europe), we compared 1) responses to short-term heat and cold shocks in both sexes, 2) heat shock protein (Hsp70) expression in adults and eggs, and 3) female reproductive traits when facing short-term heat stress during egg maturation. Contrary to expectations, thermal traits showed minor geographic differentiation, with weak evidence for greater heat resistance of southern flies but no differentiation in cold resistance. Hsp70 protein expression was little affected by heat stress, indicating systemic rather than induced regulation of the heat stress response, possibly related to this fly group's preference for cold climes. In contrast, sex differences were pronounced: males (which are larger) endured hot temperatures longer, while females featured higher Hsp70 expression. Heat stress negatively affected various female reproductive traits, reducing first clutch size, overall reproductive investment, egg lipid content, and subsequent larval hatching. These responses varied little across latitude but somewhat among populations in terms of egg size, protein content, and larval hatching success. Several reproductive parameters, but not Hsp70 expression, exhibited heritable variation among full-sib families. Rather than large-scale clinal geographic variation, our study suggests some local geographic population differentiation in the ability of yellow dung flies to buffer the impact of heat stress on reproductive performance.",2018,73,NA,41-49
The Temperature-Size Rule in <i>Lecane inermis</i> (Rotifera) is adaptive and driven by nuclei size adjustment to temperature and oxygen combinations,"Walczynska, Aleksandra and Labecka, Anna Maria and Sobczyk, Mateusz and Czarnoleski, Marcin and Kozlowski, Jan",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2014.11.002,"The evolutionary implications of the Temperature-Size Rule (TSR) in ectotherms is debatable; it is uncertain whether size decrease with temperature increase is an adaptation or a non-adaptive by-product of some temperature-dependent processes. We tested whether (i) the size of the rotifer Lecane inermis affects fecundity in a way that depends on the combination of low or high temperature and oxygen content and (ii) the proximate mechanism underlying TSR in this species is associated with nuclei size adjustment (a proxy of cell size). Small-type and large-type rotifers were obtained by culturing at different temperatures prior to the experiment and then exposed to combinations of two temperature and two oxygen conditions. Fecundity was estimated and used as a measure of fitness. Nuclei and body sizes were measured to examine the response to both environmental factors tested. The results show the following for L. inermis. (i) Body size affects fecundity in response to both temperature and oxygen, supporting a hypothesis regarding the contribution of oxygen in TSR. (ii) Large individuals are generally more fecund than small ones; however, under a combination of high temperature and poor oxygen conditions, small individuals are more fecund than large ones, in accordance with a hypothesis of the adaptive significance of TSR. (iii) The body size response to temperature is realised by nuclei size adjustment. (iv) Nuclei size changes in response to temperature and oxygen conditions, in agreement with hypotheses on the cellular mechanism underlying TSR and on a contribution of oxygen availability in TSR. These results serve as empirical evidence for the adaptive significance of TSR and validation of the cellular mechanism for the observed response. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The thermal tolerance of crayfish could be estimated from respiratory electron transport system activity,"Simcic, Tatjana and Pajk, Franja and Jaklic, Martina and Brancelj, Anton and Vrezec, Al",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2013.06.003,"Whether electron transport system (ETS) activity could be used as an estimator of crayfish thermal tolerance has been investigated experimentally. Food consumption rate, respiration rates in the air and water, the difference between energy consumption and respiration costs at a given temperature ('potential growth scope', PGS), and ETS activity of Orconectes limosus and Pacifastacus leniusculus were determined over a temperature range of 5-30 degrees C. All concerned parameters were found to be temperature dependent. The significant correlation between ETS activity and PGS indicates that they respond similarly to temperature change. The regression analysis of ETS activity as an estimator of thermal tolerance at the mitochondrial level and PGS as an indicator of thermal tolerance at the organismic level showed the shift of optimum temperature ranges of ETS activity to the right for 2 degrees in O. limosus and for 3 in P. leniusculus. Thus, lower estimated temperature optima and temperatures of optimum ranges of PGS compared to ETS activity could indicate higher thermal sensitivity at the organismic level than at a lower level of complexity (i.e. at the mitochondrial level). The response of ETS activity to temperature change, especially at lower and higher temperatures, indicates differences in the characteristics of the ETSs in O. limosus and P. leniusculus. O. limosus is less sensitive to high temperature. The significant correlation between PGS and ETS activity supports our assumption that ETS activity could be used for the rapid estimation of thermal tolerance in crayfish species.

Microscopic evaluation of vesicles shed by rat erythrocytes at elevated temperatures,"Moore, T. and Sorokulova, I. and Pustovyy, O. and Globa, L. and Vodyanoy, V.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2013.08.001,"It is hypothesized that the elevation of the temperature of the blood during heat stress may cause an increase of the shedding of erythrocyte membrane vesicles. Therefore, the increase of vesicle numbers following heat stress may be indicative of and proportional to the level heat stress. In order to test this hypothesis, erythrocytes and the vesicles shed by erythrocytes were collected from rat blood and analyzed after the elevation of body temperature by exposure to external heat. The images of erythrocytes and vesicles were analyzed by a custom light microscopy system with spatial resolution of better than 90 nm. The samples were observed in an aqueous environment and required no freezing, dehydration, staining, shadowing, marking or any other manipulation. The elevation of temperature from 36.7 +/- 0.3 to 40.3 +/- 0.4 degrees C resulted in significant increase of the concentration of vesicles in blood. At a temperature of 37 degrees C, mean vesicle concentrations and diameters found in rat blood were (1.4 +/- 0.2) x 10(6) vesicles/mu L and 0.436 +/- 0.03 mu m, respectively. The concentration of free vesicles increased after exposure to heat to (3.8 +/- 0.3) x 10(6) vesicles/mu L. It was estimated that 80\% of all vesicles found in rat blood are smaller than 0.45 mu m. The increase in the number of vesicle associated with elevated temperatures may be indicative of the heat stress level and serve as diagnostic test of erythrocyte stability and heat resistance.

Is it advantageous for Atlantic salmon to be triploid at lower temperatures?,"Riseth, Erling Nilsen and Fraser, Thomas W. K. and Sambraus, Florian and Stien, Lars Helge and Hvas, Malthe",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102548,"Marine organisms living at low temperatures tend to have larger genomes and larger cells which suggest that these traits can be beneficial in colder environments. In fish, triploidy (three complete sets of chromosomes) can be induced experimentally following fertilization, which provides a model system to investigate the hypothesis that larger cells and genomes offers a physiological advantage at low temperatures. We tested this hypothesis by measuring metabolic rates and swimming performance of diploid and triploid Atlantic salmon (Salmo solar) post smolts acclimated to 3 or 10.5 degrees C. At 10.5 degrees C, triploids had significantly lower maximum metabolic rates which resulted in a lower aerobic scope compared to diploids. In addition, triploids initiated ram ventilation at lower swimming speeds, providing further evidence of a reduced capacity to meet oxygen demands during strenuous activity at 10.5 degrees C. However, at 3 degrees C, metabolic rates and critical swimming speeds were similar between both ploidies, and as expected substantially lower than at 10.5 degrees C. Therefore, triploidy in colder environments did not provide any advantage over diploidy in terms of metabolic rate traits or swimming performance in Atlantic salmon. We therefore conclude that traits, other than aerobic scope and swimming performance, contribute to the trend for increased cell and genome size in marine ectotherms living in cold environments.",2020,89,NA,NA

In our study, the physiological responses to occasional and regular HWI have been explored. The rats were divided into a control group, occasional group (1D), and regular group (7D). The 1D and 7D groups received 42 degrees C during 15 mins HWI for 1 and 7 days, respectively. The blood samples were collected for proinflammatory cytokines examinations, the heart, liver and kidney were excised for subsequent IHC analysis to measure the level of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). The results revealed that the body temperature increased significantly during HWI on Day 3 and significantly declined on Days 6 and 7. For the 7D group, body weight, heart rate, hematocrit, platelet, osmolarity, and lactate level were lower than those in the 1D group. Furthermore, the levels of granulocyte counts, tumor necrosis factor-a, and interleukin-6 were lower in the 7D group than in the 1D group. The induction of HSP70 in the 1D group was higher than in the other groups. Physiological responses to occasional HWI are disadvantageous because of heat stress. However, adaptation to heat from regular HWI resulted in decreased proinflammatory responses and physical heat stress.",2017,69,NA,95-103
"Rapid changes in cell physiology as a result of acute thermal stress House sparrows, <i>Passer domesticus</i>","Jimenez, Ana G. and Williams, Joseph B.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2014.10.001,"Given that our climate is rapidly changing, Physiological Ecologists have the critical task of identifying characteristics of species that make them either resilient or susceptible to changes in their natural air temperature regime. Because climate change models suggest that heat events will become more common, and in some places more extreme, it is important to consider how extreme heat events might affect the physiology of a species. The implications of more frequent heat wave events for birds have only recently begun to be addressed, however, the impact of these events on the cellular physiology of a species is difficult to assess. We have developed a novel approach using dermal fibroblasts to explore how short-term thermal stress at the whole animal level might affect cellular rates of metabolism. House sparrows, Passer domesticus were separated into a ``control group{''} and a ``heat shocked{''} group, the latter acclimated to 43 degrees C for 24 h. We determined the plasticity of cellular thermal responses by assigning a ``recovery group{''} that was heat shocked as above, but then returned to room temperature for 24 h. Primary dermal fibroblasts were grown from skin of all treatment groups and the pectoralis muscle was collected. We found that glycolysis (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rates (OCR), measured using a Seahorse XF 96 analyzer, were significantly higher in the fibroblasts from the heat shocked group of House sparrows compared with their control counterparts. Additionally, muscle fiber diameters decreased and, in turn, Na+ -K+-ATPase maximal activity in the muscle significantly increased in heat shocked sparrows compared with birds in the control group. All of these physiological alterations due to short-term heat exposure were reversible within 24 h of recovery at room temperature. These results show that acute exposure to heat stress significantly alters the cellular physiology of sparrows, but that this species is plastic enough to recover from such a thermal insult within 24 h.

Effect of temperature in multiple biomarkers of oxidative stress in coastal shrimp,"Vinagre, Catarina and Madeira, Diana and Mendonca, Vanessa and Dias, Marta and Roma, Joma and Diniz, Mario S.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2014.02.005,"Various studies in captivity and in the wild have pointed to the effect of season, and temperature in particular, in the levels of the oxidative stress biomarkers currently used for environmental quality assessment. However, knowledge on how temperature affects the oxidative stress response is unavailable for most species. This study investigated the effect of increasing temperature on lipid peroxidation, catalase activity, superoxide dismutase and glutathione-S-transferase in the shrimps, Palaemon elegans and Palaemon serratus. It was concluded that increasing temperatures significantly affect all the biomarkers tested in both species, with the exception of superoxide dismutase in P. serratus which was not affected by temperature. The oxidative stress response was more intense in P. elegans, than in P. serratus, producing higher peaks of all biomarkers at temperatures between 22 C-circle and 26 C-circle, followed by low levels at higher temperatures. It was concluded that monitoring of ecosystems using oxidative stress biomarkers should take into account the species and thermal history of the organisms. Sampling should be avoided during heat waves and immediately after heat waves. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2014,41,NA,38-42
Effects of heat stress on the feeding preference of yellow-feathered broilers and its possible mechanism,"Feng, Xiajie and Ye, Ziyuan and Xie, Kailai and Zhu, Shuqing and Wu, Xin and Sun, Zhonghua and Feng, Xiaohua and Mo, Yingfen and Liang, Jingwen and Shu, Gang and Wang, Songbo and Zhu, Canjun and Jiang, Qingyan and Wang, Lina",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103959,"Heat stress is the most critical factor affecting animal feeding in summer. This experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of heat stress on the feeding preference of yellow-feathered broilers and its possible mechanism. As a result, the preference of yellow-feathered broilers for Tenebrio molitor was significantly decreased, and the fear response and serum corticosterone of broilers were significantly increased when the ambient temperatures are 35 degrees C (P < 0.05). In the central nervous system, consistent with the change in feeding preference, decreased dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and increased mRNA levels of MAO-B in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and NAc were found in yellow-feathered broilers (P < 0.05). In addition, we found significantly increased mRNA levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1, corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 2 and glucocorticoid receptor in the VTA and NAc of female broilers (P < 0.05). However, no similar change was found in male broilers. On the other hand, the serum levels of insulin and glucagon-like peptide-1 were increased only in male broilers (P < 0.05). Accordingly, the mRNA levels of insulin receptor and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor in the VTA and the phosphorylation of mTOR and PI3K were increased only in male broilers (P < 0.05). In summary, the preference of yellow-feathered broilers for Tenebrio molitor feed decreased under heat stress conditions, and hedonic feeding behavior was significantly inhibited. However, the mechanism by which heat stress affects hedonic feeding behavior may contain gender differences. The insulin signaling pathway may participate in the regulation of heat stress on the male broiler reward system, while stress hormone-related receptors in the midbrain may play an important role in the effect of heat stress on the reward system of female broilers.",2024,124,NA,NA

One aspect of the insect life cycle that would be particularly sensitive to elevated temperatures is the developmental transition from larva to adult. Temperature-induced modifications to the development of body parts and sensory organs likely have functional consequences for adult behaviour. To date, we have little knowledge about the effect of sub-optimal temperature on the development and functional morphology of different body parts, particularly sensory organs, in ectothermic solitary pollinators such as butterflies. To address this knowledge gap, we exposed the pupae of the butterfly Pieris napi to either 23 degrees C or 32 degrees C and measured the subsequent effects on eclosion, body size and the development of the wings, proboscis, eyes and antennae. In comparison to individuals that developed at 23 degrees C, we found that exposure to 32 degrees C during the pupal stage increased mortality and decreased time to eclose. Furthermore, both female and male butterflies that developed at 32 degrees C were smaller and had shorter proboscides, while males had shorter antennae. In contrast, we found no significant effect of rearing temperature on wing and eye size or wing deformity. Our findings suggest that increasing global temperatures and its corresponding co-stressors, such as humidity, will impact the survival of butterflies by impairing eclosion and the proper development of body and sensory organs.",2023,118,NA,NA
Combined stress of acute cold exposure and waterless duration at low temperature induces mortality of shrimp <i>Litopenaeus vannamei</i> through injuring antioxidative and immunological response in hepatopancreas tissue,"Xu, Defeng and Wu, Jiaxin and Sun, Lijun and Qin, Xiaoming and Fan, Xiuping and Zheng, Xiaoxian",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103080,"High mortality is a frequent occurrence during live transport of shrimp species and the biochemical mechanism remains unknown.

Moreover, the typical combined stress points at AC + WD3h, AC + WD6h and AC + WD9h were assigned for exploring the immunological and antioxidative responses. For immunity response, the total hemocyte counts (THC) decreased with the prolongation of duration time and the activities of non-specific immunity enzymes such as phenol oxidase (PO), acid phosphatase (ACP), alkaline phosphatase (AKP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) were significantly elevated in AC + WD9h groups (P < 0.05).

The objective of this study was to determine whether the two strains Of the herbivore Eccritotarsus catarinensis, a biological control agent against water hyacinth in South Africa, differ in their responses to temperature according to their geographical origin. We experimentally quantified the responses of the two strains, at three constant temperatures: 20 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C, using laboratory cultures that originated from Brazil and Peru, where climates differ. Reproductive output, egg hatching rate, sex ratio and longevity were recorded at each temperature. Fitness traits for both strains were significantly reduced at 30 degrees C compared with 25 degrees C and 20 degrees C in two successive generations. Nonetheless, Peruvian individuals continued their development at 30 degrees C, whereas Brazilian individuals that succeeded in emerging did not continue their development. In contrast, sex ratio was unaffected by temperature. The Peruvian strain of E. catarinensis presented different phenotypes depending on temperature and was more adapted to extreme high temperature than the Brazilian strain. The tropical origin of the population induces the insect to tolerate the extreme high temperature. We suggest that the Peruvian strain could be better suited for release to control water hyacinth in nature, particularly in regions where temperature is high. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In the face of current global warming, environmental variations in farm ponds represent additional challenges that may drive new adaptive regional genetic variations among broodstocks of tambaqui. In an experimental context based on the high-emission scenario of the 5th Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, we used two farmed tambaqui populations to test this hypothesis. RNA-seq transcriptome analysis was performed in the liver of juvenile tambaqui from northern (Balbina Experimental Station, Balbina, AM) and southeastern (Brumado Fish Farming, Mogi Mirim, SP) Brazilian regions kept for 30 days in artificial environmental rooms mimicking the current and extreme climate scenarios. Three Illumina MiSeq runs produced close to 120 million 500 bp paired-end reads; 191,139 contigs were assembled with N50 = 1595. 355 genes were differentially expressed for both populations in response to the extreme scenario. After enrichment analysis, each population presented a core set of genes to cope with climate change. Northern fish induced genes related to the cellular response to stress, activation of MAPK activity, response to unfolded protein, protein metabolism and cellular response to DNA damage stimuli. Genes biologically involved in regulating cell proliferation, protein stabilisation and protein ubiquitination for degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system were downregulated. Genes associated with biological processes, including the cellular response to stress, MAPK cascade activation, homeostatic processes and positive regulation of immune responses were upregulated in southeastern fish. The downregulated genes were related to cytoskeleton organisation, energy metabolism, and the regulation of transcription and biological rhythms.

In this study, four heat shock protein genes were cloned from F. occidentalis and named Fohsp90, Fohsc701, Fohsc702 and Fohsp60. These four Hsps exhibited typical characteristics of heat shock proteins. Subcellular localization signals and phylogenetic analysis indicated that FoHsp90 and FoHsc701 localize to the cytosol, whereas FoHsc702 and FoHsp60 were located in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, respectively. Analysis of genomic sequences revealed the presence of introns in the four genes (three, four, seven, and five introns for Fohsp90, Fohsc701, Fohsc702 and Fohsp60, respectively). Both the number and position of introns in these four genes were quite different from analogous genes in other species. qRT-PCR indicated that the four Fohsps were detected in second-stage larvae, one-day-old pupae, and one-day-old adults, and mRNA expression levels were lowest in larvae and highest in pupae. Fohsc701 and Fohsc702 possessed similar expression patterns and were not induced by cold or heat stress. Expression of Fohsp60 was significantly elevated by heat, and Fohsp90 was rapidly up-regulated after exposure to both cold and heat stress. Exposure to -8 degrees C had no effect on expression of the four Fohsps; however, expression of Fohsp90 and Fohsp60 was highest after a 2-h, incubation at 39 degrees C. Furthermore, cold and heat hardening led to significant up-regulation of the four Fohsps compared to their respective controls.

"Effects of acute heat exposure on oxidative stress and antioxidant defenses in overwintering frogs,<i> Nanorana</i><i> parkeri</i>","Zhang, Haiying and Zhang, Xuejing and Xu, Tisen and Li, Xiangyong and Storey, Kenneth B. and Chen, Qiang and Niu, Yonggang",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103355,"Climate warming is intensifying on the Tibetan Plateau and poses a serious threat to amphibians that live there. Although hibernation physiology and ecology of Nanorana parkeri, a frog species native to the Tibetan plateau, has been well studied, little information is available about the physiological and biochemical responses to acute rising temperature. Here, we conducted an acute warming experiment comparing hibernating N. parkeri (acclimated at 4 degrees C) and frogs acutely warmed to 10 degrees C for 12 h, comparing indicators of oxidative stress and antioxidant defense between the two groups. Acute warming led to a significant increase in the content of oxidized glutathione and the ratio of oxidized:reduced glutathione in liver and muscle, indicating that rapid warming causing oxidative stress could be a negative factor for frogs inhabiting the Tibetan plateau. Malon-dialdehyde content increased by 57\% only in muscle but decreased significantly in three tissues. Protein carbonyl groups rose by 15\% in brain, 28\% in liver, and 21\% in muscle after heat exposure but vitamin C content in heart decreased by 44\%. Acute heat exposure also induced tissue-specific upregulation of antioxidant enzyme activ-ities. Catalase activity increased by 27\% in heat-exposed frogs, as compared to controls, and glutathione peroxidase activity rose by 12\% in brain, 30\% in liver, and 12\% in muscle. Glutathione-S-transferase activity was also enhanced in heart and muscle of heat-exposed frogs. Acute warming also resulted in a rise in total anti-oxidant capacity in all tissues examined except kidney, relative to controls. In summary, our findings show that acute heat exposure to hibernating N. parkeri causes a tissue-specific increase in oxidative damage and antiox-idant defenses, with skeletal muscle being the most affected tissue. These results reveal the physiological re-sponses to acute temperature change in overwintering N. parkeri.",2022,110,NA,NA
The relationship between small heat shock proteins and redox homeostasis during acute heat stress in chickens,"Mackei, Mate and Matis, Gabor and Molnar, Andor and Sebok, Csilla and Voroshazi, Julia and Pal, Laszlo and Dublecz, Karoly and Husveth, Ferenc and Neogrady, Zsuzsanna",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103040,"As heat stress is a major emerging issue in poultry farming, investigations on the molecular mechanisms of the heat-triggered cellular response in chickens are of special importance. In the present study, 32-day-old Ross 308 broiler chickens were subjected to 37 degrees C environmental temperature combined with 50\% relative humidity for 4 or 8 h respectively. Following sampling, redox parameters such as malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), protein carbonyl levels as well as glutathione pemxidase activity were assessed in liver, spleen, and kidney homogenates. The concentrations of small heat shock proteins (sHSP-s) HSP27, alpha A- and alpha B-crystallins were also investigated. Among these organs, the liver was found the most susceptible to heat-provoked oxidative stress, indicated by enhanced lipid peroxidation and rapid activation of protective pathways, including the definite increase of glutathione peroxidase activity and the excessive utilization of (alpha A- and alpha B-crystallin proteins. Heat-associated decline of protein carbonylation and GSH content was observed in the liver in correlation with the increased involvement of (alpha A- and alpha B-crystallins in cellular defense, resulting supposedly in an over-compensation mechanism. These data highlight the hepatic sensitivity to acute heat shock, potential adaptation mechanisms, and the specific role of sHSP-s in the restoration of physiologic cell function.",2021,100,NA,NA
Higher acclimation temperature affects growth of rohu (Labeo rohita) through suppression of GH and IGFs genes expression actuating stress response,"Shahjahan, Md and Zahangir, Md.

Our earlier study reported that higher temperature affects cellular and hemato-biochemical responses in rohu, Labeo rohita. In this backdrop, the present study assessed the effect of higher acclimation temperature on the regulatory mechanisms of growth and stress responses of juvenile L. rohita acclimatized in three temperature conditions (30 degrees C, 33 degrees C, and 36 degrees C) for a period of 30 days. The relative expression of genes for growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factors (IGF-1 and IGF-2) and heat shock proteins (hsp70 and hsp90) were measured by real-time quantitative PCR. The results revealed that the highest acclimation temperature (36 degrees C) significantly decreased the weight gain (WG) and specific growth rate (SGR), and increased the feed conversion ratio (FCR) compared to 30 degrees C (control), while increased WG, SGR and lowered FCR were observed in fish reared at the intermediate temperature (33 degrees C) compared to 30 degrees C. Similarly, the GH gene expression in the pituitary was significantly decreased and increased at 36 degrees C and 33 degrees C, respectively as compared to 30 degrees C. A significantly lower expression of IGF-1 and IGF-2, and higher expression of hsp70 and hsp90 were observed in the liver of fish at 36 degrees C. The results of the present study indicate that although slightly elevated temperature promotes the growth of juvenile L. rohita, the higher acclimation temperature may induce stress response and impair growth performance by suppressing GH/IGF system.",2021,100,NA,NA

In this study, the effects of temperature, DO, and their interaction on the growth, antioxidant status, digestive enzyme activity, serum biochemical parameters, and liver IGF-1 expression in rainbow trout were evaluated. Fish (initial weight, 109.98 +/- 3.28 g) were reared in a recirculating system for 4 weeks and subjected to 6 treatments at three temperatures (13 degrees C, 17 degrees C, and 21 degrees C) and two DO contents (4.2 mg L-1 and 9.6 mg L-1). Physiological parameters were determined at the end of the trial. Specific growth rate and feed consumption were the highest at 17 degrees C and the lowest at 21 degrees C. Additionally, lysozyme, trypsin, lipase, and amylase activities, serum glucose and serum triglyceride contents, and IGF-1 expression decreased significantly at 21 degrees C and total serum protein and albumin contents were significantly higher at 21 degrees C than at 13 degrees C and 17 degrees C, indicating that high temperature impaired the immunity, digestion, and growth of rainbow trout. However, the adverse effects of high temperature can be alleviated by a high DO content, as evidenced by the smaller increments and decrements of these parameters under hyperoxic conditions than under hypoxic conditions. In response to high temperature stress, an increase in antioxidant enzyme activity led to the removal of oxygen free radicals under hyperoxic conditions; however, this increase was inhibited under hypoxia. Our results indicated that high temperatures have adverse effects on rainbow trout, and these harmful effects can be reduced by a high DO content.",2021,98,NA,NA
"The thermal acclimation potential of maximum heart rate and cardiac heat tolerance in Arctic char (<i>Salvelinus alpinus</i>), a northern cold-water specialist","Gilbert, Matthew J. H. and Farrell, Anthony P.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102816,"Increasing heart rate (f(H)) is a central, if not primary mechanism used by fishes to support their elevated tissue oxygen consumption during acute warming. Thermal acclimation can adjust this acute response to improve cardiac performance and heat tolerance under the prevailing temperatures. We predict that such acclimation will be particularly important in regions undergoing rapid environmental change such as the Arctic. Therefore, we acclimated Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), a high latitude, cold-adapted salmonid, to ecologically relevant temperatures (2, 6, 10, 14 and 18 degrees C) and examined how thermal acclimation influenced their cardiac heat tolerance by measuring the maximum heart rate (f(Hmax)) response to acute warming. As expected, acute warming increased f(Hmax) in all Arctic char before f(Hmax) reached a peak and then became arrhythmic. The peak f(Hmax), and the temperature at which peak fax (T-peak) and that at which arrhythmia first occurred (T(ar)r) all increased progressively (+33\%, 49\% and 35\%, respectively) with acclimation temperature from 2 to 14 degrees C. When compared at the same test temperature fax also decreased by as much as 29\% with increasing acclimation temperature, indicating significant thermal compensation. The upper temperature at which fish first lost their equilibrium (critical thermal maximum: CTmax) also increased with acclimation temperature, albeit to a lesser extent (+11\%). Importantly, Arctic char experienced mortality after several weeks of acclimation at 18 degrees C and survivors did not have elevated cardiac thermal tolerance. Collectively, these findings suggest that if wild Arctic char have access to suitable temperatures (<18 degrees C) for a sufficient duration, warm acclimation can potentially mitigate some of the cardiorespiratory impairments previously documented during acute heat exposure.",2021,95,NA,NA

Here, we analyze the thermal plastic response of laboratory populations of Drosophila subobscura, derived from two contrasting latitudes of the European dine. We measured reproductive performance through fecundity characters, after the experimental populations were exposed to five thermal treatments, with different combinations of developmental and adult temperatures (14 degrees C, 18 degrees C, or 26 degrees C). Our questions were whether (1) adult performance changes with exposure to higher (or lower) temperatures during development; (2) flies raised at lower temperatures outperform those developed at higher ones, supporting the ``colder is better{''} hypothesis; (3) there is a cumulative effect on adult performance of exposing both juveniles and adults to higher (or lower) temperatures; (4) there is evidence for biogeographical effects on adult performance. Our main findings were that (1) higher developmental temperatures led to low reproductive performance regardless of adult temperature, while at lower temperatures reduced performance only occurred when colder conditions were persistent across juvenile and adult stages; (2) flies raised at lower temperatures did not always outperform those developed at other temperatures; (3) there were no harmful cumulative effects after exposing both juveniles and adults to higher temperatures; (4) both latitudinal populations showed similar thermal plasticity patterns. The negative effect of high developmental temperature on reproductive performance, regardless of adult temperature, highlights the developmental stage as very critical and most vulnerable to climate change and associated heat waves.",2021,95,NA,NA

Critical thermal maxima of early life stages of three tropical fishes: Effects of rearing temperature and experimental heating rate,"Illing, B. and Downie, A. T. and Beghin, M. and Rummer, J. L.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102582,"Marine ectotherms are often sensitive to thermal stress, and certain life stages can be particularly vulnerable (e. g., larvae or spawners). In this study, we investigated the critical thermal maxima (CTmax) of larval and early juvenile life stages of three tropical marine fishes (Acanthochromis polyacanthus, Amphiprion melanopus, and Lates calcarifer). We tested for potential effects of developmental acclimation, life stage, and experimental heating rates, and we measured metabolic enzyme activities from aerobic (citrate synthase, CS) and anaerobic pathways (lactate dehydrogenase, LDH). A slightly elevated rearing temperature neither influenced CTmax nor CS activity, which otherwise could have indicated thermal acclimation. However, we found CTmax to either remain stable (Acanthrochromis polyacanthus) or increase with body mass during early ontogeny (Amphiprion melanopus and Lates calcarifer). In all three species, faster heating rates lead to higher CTmax. Acute temperature stress did not change CS or LDH activities, suggesting that overall aerobic and anaerobic metabolism remained stable. Lates calcarifer, a catadromous species that migrates from oceanic to riverine habitats upon metamorphosis, had higher CTmax than the two coral reef fish species. We highlight that, for obtaining conservative estimates of a fish species' upper thermal limits, several developmental stages and body mass ranges should be examined. Moreover, upper thermal limits should be assessed using standardized heating rates. This will not only benefit comparative approaches but also aid in assessing geographic (re-) distributions and climate change sensitivity of marine fishes.",2020,90,NA,NA
Growth and physiological responses in largemouth bass populations to environmental warming: Effects of inhabiting chronically heated environments,"White, Dalon P. and Wahl, David H.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102467,"Ectotherms are susceptible to increasing environmental temperatures associated with anthropogenic warming. Supra-optimum temperatures lead to declining aerobic capacity and can increase exposure to lethal temperatures, resulting in reduced performance. Although the capacity of phenotypic plasticity to minimize the effects of temperature on physiological processes is well studied, evidence of generational changes (e.g. transgenerational plasticity and rapid adaptation) in response to environmental warming is limited in natural populations. We investigated metabolism, growth, and thermal tolerance of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) populations inhabiting thermally altered lakes (i.e. power plant cooling lakes) which have year-round elevated temperature regimes and exhibit supra-optimum temperatures on a yearly basis, and compared these traits with those in largemouth bass populations from ambient lakes. Largemouth bass from ambient and heated groups (n = 3 populations per group) were spawned in an ambient, common garden pond environment, then acclimated to either a normal summertime temperature (24 degrees C) or a supra-optimum temperature (30 degrees C). Fish from heated populations had significant reductions in the resting metabolic rate at both temperatures and markedly increased growth rates at 30 degrees C. By comparing pond-raised fish to fish removed directly from heated lakes, we showed that developmental plasticity played little role in establishing the metabolic rate. A lower resting metabolic rate contributed to an increase in the conversion efficiency of food to biomass of largemouth bass from heated lakes, regardless of temperature. Despite inhabiting heated lakes for many decades, neither critical thermal maximum nor minimum were altered in heated populations when raised in a common garden environment. These results suggest that largemouth bass can lessen sub-lethal effects of warming by altering physiological processes to reduce the impact of warming on aerobic scope and that these changes are generationally transient, but changes in maximum thermal tolerance in response to warming is limited to phenotypic plasticity.",2020,88,NA,NA
Chronic heat stress increases insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1) but does not affect IGF-binding proteins in growing pigs,"Xin, Hairui and Zhang, Xiaojun and Sun, Dengsheng and Zhang, Chuang and Hao, Yue and Gu, Xianhong",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.08.008,"The insulin-like activity of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is heavily blunted by IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs, including IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-3).

Twenty-seven growing large white barrows with similar body weight were collected from nine litters and were assigned into three treatments. The litter effect is balanced in all treatments. Treatments were: 1) thermal-neutral (TN) group (23 degrees C), 2) chronic HS group (33 degrees C), and 3) pair-fed in TN condition (PFTN). The experiment lasted for 21 days. Compared with TN controls, decreased FI, lower average body weight gain, higher rectal temperature and increased respiration rates were observed in HS pigs. On D7, increased plasma insulin concentration and insulin:glucose ratio were observed in HS pigs compared to TN controls. A overall elevation of plasma IGF-1:IGFBP-3 ratio was detected in HS pigs compared with PFTN and TN counterparts. Besides, hepatic IGF-1 gene expression of HS pigs was 50\% higher than TN counterparts. PFTN pigs, however, had no differences in plasma IGF-1:IGFBP-3 ratio and hepatic IGF-1 gene expression, compared with TN pigs. PFTN pigs increased plasma IGFBPs concentration and hepatic IGFBPs gene expression, compared with TN controls. However, no differences in plasma IGFBPs concentration and hepatic IGFBPs gene expression were observed between TN and HS group. Liver IRS-1 gene and protein expressions of HS pigs tended to be increased compared with TN controls, while PFTN pigs still kept liver IRS-1 gene and protein expressions in normal level.

Extended winters entail long-term costs for insect offspring reared in an overwinter burrow,"Koerner, Maximilian and Foitzik, Susanne and Meunier, Joel",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.03.021,"Winter imposes an ecological challenge to animals living in colder climates, especially if these adverse conditions coincide with reproduction and offspring rearing. To overcome this challenge, some insects burrow in the soil to protect adults, larvae, or eggs from negative effects of winter. However, whether this protection is effective against any long-term consequences of changes in winter duration is unclear. Here, we investigated the long-term effects of winter length variation on eggs of the European earwig Forficula auricularia. In this insect, females construct and maintain a burrow between late autumn and spring, in which they provide extensive forms of care to their eggs and then juveniles. We experimentally maintained earwig females under two winter durations of either four or six weeks and examined the resulting effects in terms of 1) hatching date, 2) developmental time of juveniles until adulthood, 3) adult mass at emergence, and 4) investment of adult offspring females in three key immune parameters: hemocyte concentration, phenoloxidase, and prophenoloxidase activities. Because earwigs' resistance against pathogens relies on their social environment, effects of winter length on immunity were tested on females exposed to different social environments: with familiar conspecifics, unfamiliar conspecifics, or in isolation. Our results reveal that after the winter treatments, eggs reared in short winters hatched earlier and the emerging juveniles reached adulthood faster than juveniles from eggs exposed to long winters. We also showed that prophenoloxidase was 30\% higher in females from the long compared to short winter treatment, regardless of social environment. Finally, we found that hemocyte counts where twice as high in short compared to long winter females, but only with unfamiliar conspecifics. Overall, our study reveals that maintaining and caring for eggs in a burrow does not prevent the costs associated with increased winter duration.",2018,74,NA,116-122

Experimental warming caused females to oviposit earlier and more frequently; however, it did not affect other reproductive traits, including clutch size, egg mass and clutch mass. Accelerated embryonic development and energy accumulation rate might have occurred in warmed females. Maternal warming appeared to increase early embryonic mortality, but did not shift hatchling size and locomotor performance. Embryos of oviparous lizards might be more vulnerable to climate change at early stages than at later stages. The impacts of climate change in oviparous lizards might be adverse in the longer term because of the shift in pre-ovipositional embryo viability, which possibly led to a decreased number of hatchlings.",2018,74,NA,303-310
Is there an effect of environmental temperature on the response to an antigen and the metabolic rate in pups of the rodent <i>Octodon degus</i>?,"Ramirez-Otarola, Natalia and Espinoza, Janyra and Kalergis, Alexis M. and Sabat, Pablo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.10.005,"Environmental temperature is a variable that influences all aspects of organisms, from physiological, e.g. immune function, and morphological traits to behavior. Recent studies have reported that environmental temperature modulates organisms' thermoregulatory capacity and immune response, suggesting that trade-offs must be made between thermoregulation and immune function. Despite this, studies that evaluate this trade-off in developing endotherms are scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of environmental temperature experienced during development on the response to an antigen and its energetic costs in the precocial rodent Octodon degus. To accomplish this, we acclimated pups from birth to weaning at temperatures of 15 degrees C and 30 degrees C. At weaning, animals were inoculated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cytokine interleukin-1 beta levels, sickness behavior, changes in body temperature and basal metabolic rate, and body mass were measured. Our results showed that environmental temperature influences cytokine levels, body temperature, and some aspects of sickness behavior. Specifically, acclimatization at 30 degrees C has a suppressive effect on the response to LPS, possibly due to a control to avoid overproduction of interleukin-1 beta. Body mass and basal metabolic rate were not affected by environmental temperature experienced during development, but inoculation with LPS affected both variables. Our results suggest that ambient temperature may be a key factor that affects the response to an antigen in pups of O. degus; however, no evidence of a trade-off between thermoregulation and immune function was found here.",2018,71,NA,17-23

Elevations in average sea surface temperatures are occurring and increasing frequency of marine heatwaves resulting in mortalities of organisms are being reported. In recent years, marine farmers have reported summer mass mortality events of the New Zealand Greenshell mussel, Perna canaliculus, during the summer months; however, the etiological agents have yet to be determined. To elucidate the role of thermal stress, adult P. canaliculus were exposed to three chronic temperature treatments: a benign control of 17 degrees C and stressful elevations of 21 degrees C and 24 degrees C. Eight mussels per treatment were collected each month throughout a 14-month challenge period to identify and investigate histopathological differences among P. canaliculus populations exposed to the three temperatures. Histopathology revealed several significant deleterious alterations to tissues associated with temperature and exposure time. Increasing temperature and progression of time resulted in 1) an increase in the number of focal lipofuscin-ceroid aggregations, 2) an increase in focal hemocytosis, 3) an increase in the thickness of the sub-epithelial layer of the intestinal tract and 4) a decreased energy reserve cell (glycogen) coverage in the mantle. Prolonged exposure, irrespective of temperature, impacted gametogenesis, which was effectively arrested. Furthermore, increased levels of the heat shock protein 70 kDa (HSP 70) were seen in gill and gonad from thermally challenged mussels. The occurrence of the parasite Perkinsus olseni at month 5 in the 24 degrees C treatment, and month 7 at 21 degrees C was unexpected and may have exacerbated the fore-mentioned tissue conditions. Prolonged exposure to stable thermal conditions therefore appears to impact P. canaliculus, tissues with implications for broodstock captivity. Mussels experiencing elevated, temperatures of 21 and 24 degrees C demonstrated more rapid pathological signs. This research provides further insight into the complex hostpathogen-environment interactions for P. canaliculus in response to prolonged elevated temperature.",2023,117,NA,NA
Enzymatic responses reveal different physiological strategies employed by eurytolerant fish during extreme hot and cold cycling acclimation temperatures,"Jimenez, Ana Gabriela and Nash-Braun, Evan",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103578,"Heat waves and cold snaps are projected to rise in magnitude, duration, interval, and harshness in the coming years. The current literature examining thermal impacts on the physiology of organisms rarely uses chronic, variable thermal acclimations despite the fact that climate change predictions project a more variable environment. If we are to determine species' susceptibility to climate change, chronic and variable lab acclimations should be prioritized. Here, we acclimated the eurytolerant sheepshead minnow (Cyprinodon variegatus) to two extreme cycling thermal regimes: one warm {[}resting 27 degrees C with a spike to 33 degrees C for 8 h daily], one cold {[}resting 6.5 degrees C with a spike to 12 degrees C for 8 h daily], and three chronically stable conditions (10, 22, and 30 degrees C) for comparison. We measured enzymatic an-tioxidants (catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)), total antioxidant capacity, lipid peroxidation (LPO) damage, and citrate synthase (CS) activity in white epaxial muscle. Of particular note, we found significant increases in log CAT activity and SOD concentration in the warm cycling temperatures, and significant increases in GPx activity in the cold cycling temperatures. We found no significant accumulation of LPO damage in any of our thermal acclimation treatments. Thus, sheepshead minnows demonstrate two particularly different mechanisms towards dealing with thermal variation in low and high temperatures. The enzymatic differences between low and high cycling temperatures may define pathways of eurytolerant organisms and how they may survive predicted variability in thermal regimes.",2023,114,NA,NA
Acute thermal stress and endotoxin exposure modulate metabolism and immunity in marine mussels (<i>Perna canaliculus</i>),"Muznebin, Farhana and Alfaro, Andrea C. and Venter, Leonie and Young, Tim",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103327,"Mass mortalities of New Zealand Green-lipped mussels (Perna canaliculus) are thought to be associated with increased water temperatures and immune challenges from opportunistic pathogens. However, the combined effects of acute thermal stress and immune stimulation on mussels are poorly understood. To investigate these responses, adult mussels were exposed to different temperatures (26 C {[}thermal stress] vs 15 C [}ambient]) and a bacterial-derived endotoxin injection (with vs without) to mimic a pathogen infection. Various immunological and metabolic parameters were measured over two days via enzyme staining reactions, flow cytometry, and metabolomic profiling. None of the treatments impacted total and differential haemocyte counts, haemocyte viability or production of reactive oxygen species. Acid phosphatase and phenoloxidase activities were detected only within granulocytes (not in hyalinocytes), although their relative expressions also were not affected. Conversely, metabolite profiling exposed impacts of thermal stress and endotoxin exposure at a metabolic level, indicative of physiological changes in energy expenditure and partitioning. At the higher water temperature, free fatty acid and amino acid constituents increased and decreased, respectively, which supports an elevated energy demand and higher metabolic rate due to thermal stress. Ultimately, energy production is being sustained via multiple routes including the glycolysis pathway, TCA cycle, and beta-oxidation. Additionally, branched-chain amino acids, the urea cycle and the glutathione pathway were affected by the higher temperature. The metabolic response of mussels exposed to endotoxin exposure resulted in increased metabolite response largely linked to protein and lipid degradation. After 5 days of exposure, survival data confirmed a severe physiological impact of the higher temperature through incidences of mortality. However, the thermal challenge in combination with the specific endotoxin treatment applied did not lead to a synergistic effect on mortality. These findings provide new insights into the relationship between thermal stress and immunity to better understand the immune defence system in mussels.",2022,110,NA,NA

Heat shock response (HSR) indicators (Hsp70 and Hsp90), activation of MAPK family members, uniquitination, antioxidant enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR), and apoptotic indicators such as caspases levels and the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 were determined in liver and muscle samples that were collected on days 0, 14, 41 and 60. Long term feed deprivation and temperature variations resulted in granulomatosis, HSR induction, MAPK activation, ubiquitination, and triggering of the antioxidant defense and apoptotic machinery of the meagre. Although these responses were differentially expressed at each different imposed temperatures, the most significant variations were mainly observed below 20 degrees C and above 23 degrees C. Correlation analysis showed a significant relation between the examined indicators.

To understand how high summer temperatures may affect the population dynamics of A. lepigone, we exposed different developmental stages (1, 2 and 4-day old eggs; 1, 6, 12 and 18-day old larvae; 1, 3 and 6-day old pupae; and 1 and 2-day old female and male adults) to 41 degrees C for periods of various length (0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 h): The rearing temperature (constant 26 degrees C) was used as control. After heat treatment, all individuals were transferred to a 26 degrees C climate chamber for further development. The effects on immediate survival, maturation success to adulthood, and female fecundity were studied. Eggs, young larvae, late pupae and newly emerged adults had relatively higher immediate survival rates than the other experimental groups. Heat treatment at the egg and larval stages had no impact on development to adulthood and on female fecundity, while it significantly reduced the survival rate of larvae but not of eggs. Brief exposure to high temperature during the early pupal stage and as adults depressed female fecundity whereas exposure during the late pupal stage had no effect.",2021,100,NA,NA
Thermal tolerance and preferred temperature range of juvenile meagre acclimated to four temperatures,"Kir, Mehmet and Sunar, Murat Can and Altindag, Baris Can",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.02.018,"The present study reports the temperature tolerance, estimated using dynamic and static methodologies, and preferred temperature range, based on oxygen consumption rate (OCR), of juvenile meagre (Argyrosomus regius) (Asso, 1801) (3.4 +/- 0.9 g) after 30 days of acclimation at 18, 22, 26 and 30 degrees C. Meagre has dynamic and static thermal tolerance zones of 551 degrees C-2 and 460 degrees C-2, respectively and is a low resistance fish species, with a resistance zone area of 87 degrees C-2. The OCR of juvenile meagre at the above acclimation temperatures was 370, 410, 618 and 642 mg h(-1) kg(-1), respectively, and is significantly different (P < 0.0001, n=20). The fact that OCR increases by rising temperatures and gradually decreases after 26 degrees C indicates that the preferred temperature range of juvenile meagre is between 26 and 30 degrees C. Our study suggests that meagre is unable to respond to low and high temperature variation in aquaculture facilities or its natural habitats.",2017,65,NA,125-129
Temperature-dependent melanism and phenoloxidase activity in the dimorphic sepsid fly<i> Sepsis</i><i> thoracica</i>,"Gourgoulianni, Natalia and Schafer, Martin A. and Kapun, Martin and Busso, Juan Pablo and Blanckenhorn, Wolf U.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103473,"Climate is changing towards both higher average temperatures and more frequent and severe heat waves. Whereas numerous studies have investigated temperature effects on animal life histories, assessments of their immune function are limited. In the size-and colour-dimorphic black scavenger (or dung) fly Sepsis thoracica (Diptera: Sepsidae), we experimentally studied how developmental temperature and larval density influence phenoloxidase (PO) activity, a key enzyme in insect pigmentation, thermoregulation, and immunity. Flies from five latitudinal European populations were raised at three developmental temperatures (18, 24, 30 degrees C). PO ac-tivity increased with developmental temperature differently in the sexes and the two male morphs (black and orange), altering the sigmoid relationship between melanism, i.e. colouration and fly size. PO activity further positively correlated with larval rearing density, potentially because of higher risks of pathogen infection or greater developmental stress following stronger resource competition. Populations varied somewhat in PO ac-tivity, body size and colouration, however with no clear latitudinal pattern. Overall our results indicate that morph-and sex-specific PO activity, and thus likely immune function, in S. thoracica depends on temperature and larval density, modifying the underlying putative trade-off between immunity and body size. The strong dampening of the immune system of all morphs at cool temperatures suggests low-temperature stress in this warm-adapted species common in southern Europe. Our results also support the population density dependent prophylaxis hypothesis, which predicts higher investment in immunity when facing limited resource availability and increased pathogen infection probability.",2023,112,NA,NA

Its culture is seriously affected by increasing summer temperatures in recent years. Aim to investigate the effects of heat stress on apoptosis, oxidative stress, and the immune response in pikeperch. the fish were heat stressed at 30 degrees C, 32 degrees C and 34 degrees C for 2h respectively, followed by a 48h recovery period. The results showed that as temperature increased, the contents of malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the liver increased significantly. Meanwhile, acute heat stress results in progressive deleterious alterations in liver tissue, especially vascular rupture, blood infiltration, and severe vacuolation at 34 degrees C. TUNEL staining revealed that the apoptosis level increased significantly with the rising temperature. Acute heat stress significantly induced the mRNA expression of apoptosis-related genes, including tumor suppressor (p53), B-cell lymphoma-2 (bcl-2), bcl-2associated X (bax), apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (apaf-1), cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase (caspase-3 and caspase-9), and the expression of p53 was also positively correlated with bax expression and the bax/ bcl-2 ratio. Additionally, caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity increased significantly at 34 degrees C compared with the control group (23 degrees C). Innate immune genes, including tumor necrosis factor (tnf-alpha), interleukins (il-7, il-8, il-10 and il-1 beta), complement 3 (c3) were activated under acute heat stress, and H2O2 content was positively correlated with the expressions of tnf-alpha and il-1 beta. After the temperature reached again 23 degrees C, most measured indexes in heat-stressed groups didn't return to stress-free levels, and liver tissue also didn't return to its normal state in the histopathology. It was found that p53-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis pathway was triggered in pikeperch under acute heat stress, and there may be a vicious cycle between oxidative stress and inflammation. In summary, the present study is helpful to elucidate how acute heat stress mediates liver injury of pikeperch through mitochondrial pathway, inflammation and oxidative stress.",2022,106,NA,NA
Sex-specific thermal tolerance limits in the ditch shrimp <i>Palaemon varians</i>: Eco-evolutionary implications under a warming ocean,"Missionario, Madalena and Fernandes, Joana Filipa and Travesso, Margarida and Freitas, Eduardo and Calado, Ricardo and Madeira, Diana",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103151,"As global temperatures continue to rise due to global change, marine heatwaves are also becoming more frequent and intense, impacting marine biodiversity patterns worldwide. Organisms inhabiting shallow water environments, such as the commercially relevant ditch shrimp Palaemon varians, are expected to be the most affected by rising temperatures. Thus, addressing species' thermal ecology and climate extinction-risk is crucial to foster climate-smart conservation strategies for shallow water ecosystems. Here, we estimated sex-specific upper thermal tolerance limits for P. varians via the Critical Thermal Maximum method (CTmax), using loss of equilibrium as endpoint. We further calculated thermal safety margins for males and females and tested for correlations between upper thermal limits and shrimps' body size. To determine sex-biased variation in P. varians' traits (CTmax, weight and length), we compared trait variation between females and males through the coefficient of variation ratio (InCVR). Females displayed an average CTmax value 1.8\% lower than males (CTmax(females) = 37.0 degrees C vs CTmax(males) = 37.7 degrees C). This finding may be related to the larger body size exhibited by females (156\% heavier and 39\% larger than males), as both length and weight had a significant effect on CTmax. The high energetic investment of females in offspring may also contribute to the differences recorded in thermal tolerance. Overall, organisms with a smaller body-size displayed a greater tolerance to elevated temperature, thus suggesting that smaller individuals may be positively selected in warmer environments. This selection may result in a reduction of size-at-maturity and shifts in sex ratio, given the sexual dimorphism in body size of shrimps. The thermal safety margin of P. varians was narrow (similar to 2.2 degrees C for males and similar to 1.5 degrees C for females), revealing the vulnerability of this species to ocean warming and heatwaves.",2022,103,NA,NA
Effects of warming rates on physiological and molecular components of response to CTMax heat stress in the Antarctic fish <i>Harpagifer antarcticus</i>,"Saravia, Julia and Paschke, Kurt and Oyarzun-Salazar, Ricardo and Cheng, C-H Christina and Navarro, Jorge M. and Vargas-Chacoff, Luis",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103021,"Maximum and minimum Critical thermal limits (CTMax and CTMin) have been studied extensively to assess thermal tolerance in ectotherms by means of ramping assays. Notothenioid fish have been proposed as particularly sensitive to temperature increases related to global climate change. However, there are large gaps in our understanding of the thermal responses of these extreme cold-adapted fish in assays with heating rates. We evaluated the effects of two commonly used heating rates (0.3 and 1 degrees C/min) on the cellular stress responses in the intertidal Antarctic fish Harpagifer antarcticus immediately after CTMax was reached, and at 2 and 4 h of recovery time in ambient water. We compared CTMax values, the relative transcript expression of genes relvant to heat shock response (Hsc70, Hsp70, Grp78), hypoxia (Hif1-alpha, LDHa, GR), ubiquitination (Ube2), and apoptosis (SMAC/DIABLO), and five plasma parameters - glucose, lactate, total protein, osmolality and cortisol. CTMax values between the two heating rates are not significantly different, and both rates elicited a similar stress response at molecular and physiological levels. We found a lack of up-regulated response of heat shock proteins, consistent with other Antarctic notothenioids. The general transcriptional pattern trended to downregulation, which was more evident in the slower 0.3 degrees C/min rate, and instances of upregulation were mainly related to ubiquitination. The faster 1 degrees C/min rate, rarely used for Antarctic fish, can be suitable for studying cold-adapted stenothermic fish without overestimating thermal tolerance or inducing damage from longer heat exposure.",2021,99,NA,NA

As T. catalanensis is subjected to variable thermal conditions along its distribution and may be jeopardized by the climate change, we measured its thermal preferences after exposure to milder (17 degrees C-27 degrees C) and warmer (22 degrees C-32 degrees C) thermal conditions to evaluate acclimatory responses and tolerances and vulnerabilities to warming. Field body temperatures tended to be similar to minimum preferred body temperatures, and microhabitat and body temperatures in the field were cooler in the remaining comparisons with thermal preferences {[}preferred (T-pref), set-point range (T-set), minimum preferred (T-pref\_min) and maximum preferred (T-pref\_max) body temperatures], suggesting there was a constraint to warming up in nature. The minimum preferred body temperatures may be a threshold separating proper functioning from markedly noxious impacts due to progressive impairment by the cooling. Difficulties to warm and keep suitable body temperatures may jeopardize overall ecophysiological and behavioral processes with implications for maintenance, fitness, and survival. The constraints to warm may impact T. catalanensis differently depending on its body size and its properties of heat conservation (thermal inertia). Smaller and larger T. catalanensis may respectively cool down easier and have difficulties to warm up, being jeopardized by the constraints due to the cold. The warmer preferred body temperatures coupled with the cooler microhabitats and bodies in nature complicate to anticipate how individuals will respond to climate change, but the acclimation to the warmer temperatures led six of them to death, suggesting they had limited tolerance to heat and would be vulnerable to global warming.",2021,98,NA,NA

However, until now, no study has tested the effect of the fungicide mancozeb (MZ) on thermal tolerance and its relationship with the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs). MZ is the best-selling broad-spectrum fungicide in the world, which negatively affects non-target organisms. Here, we tested for the first time the effects of MZ on critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and its relationship to the expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in tadpoles of Physalameus henselii, a colder-adapted species in southernmost of the Neotropical region. A sublethal concentration of 2 mg/L was used. We found that the CTmax of the MZ-treated group was lower than that of the control group. In addition, there was an increase in HSP70 expression in tadpoles exposed to MZ and in tadpoles that underwent heat treatment. However, tadpoles subjected to MZ and heat treatment showed no induced HSP70 protein expression. Our results demonstrated that sublethal doses of the fungicide MZ negatively affected the thermal physiology and heat shock protein expression in tadpoles of P. henselii by inducing an increase in HSP70 concentration and by reducing the critical CTmax supported by tadpoles. It is important to understand the relationship between environmental contamination and physiological thermal limits in our current scenario of high rates of habitat conversion associated with unrestricted use of agrochemicals, as well as the challenging environmental changes induced by global warming.",2021,98,NA,NA

However, the reestablishment of scrotal thermoregulation and the dynamics of sperm defects emergence after stress are not completely known in buffaloes. Thus, the study aimed to evaluate the effect of short-term heat stress over scrotal thermoregulation and sperm attributes, relating them to spermatogenesis stages. Five buffalo bulls went through scrotal insulation during 48 h (from day 0 to day 2). Semen samples were collected every 7 days (from day 7 to day 49) and analyzed about the progressive motility, viability, and sperm morphology. Heat stress significantly destabilized scrotal thermoregulation (P < 0.001). Scrotal temperature was from 4.2 to 6.3 degrees C lower than the core body temperature, except on insulation days (P < 0.001), and returned to the basal condition five days after the removal of the stressing stimulus. More significant deleterious effects were observed in sperm morphology than in cell concentration, motility, and viability. The chronology of morphologic defects expression demonstrated tail defects (days 7-14), cytoplasmic droplets (days 14-28), and head defects (day 28), returning to pre-insulation condition 35 days after the thermal challenge. Thus, hyperthermia harmed more intensely spermatozoa in epididymal transit, elongated spermatids, and secondary spermatocytes. It is concluded that water buffalo bulls present a peculiar manifestation of sperm morphology after short-term stress, indicating an important difference related to the bovine species. Therefore, during the andrological evaluation of buffalo bulls, it is necessary to avoid the allometric extrapolation between these species.",2021,96,NA,NA

In aquaculture this frequently manifests in an animal welfare crisis, with fish increasingly farmed under high production, high stress conditions. These intense environments can result in fish stocks having a high susceptibility to infection, with parasites and associated disease one of the main factors limiting industry growth. Prediction of infection dynamics is key to preventative treatment and mitigation. Considering the climatic and technology driven changes facing aquaculture, an understanding of how parasites react across a spectrum of conditions is required. Here we assessed the impact of temperature, infection density and host species on the life history traits of Argulus foliaceus, a common palearctic fish louse, representative of a parasite group problematic in freshwater aquaculture and fisheries worldwide. Temperature significantly affected development, growth and survival; parasites hatched and developed faster at higher temperatures, but also experienced shorter lifespans when maintained off the host. At high temperatures, these parasites will likely experience a short generation time as their life history traits are completed more rapidly. A. foliaceus additionally grew faster on natural hosts and at lower infection densities. Ultimately such results contribute to prediction of population dynamics, aiding development of effective control to improve animal welfare and reduce industry loss.",2020,92,NA,NA

Reptiles inhabiting tropical highlands face extreme fluctuating daily temperatures, and extreme values and intervals of fluctuations vary with altitude. Anolis heterodermus occurs between 1800 m to 3750 m elevation in the tropical Andes, and is the Anolis species found at the highest altitude known. We evaluated which strategies populations from elevations of 2200 m, 2650 m and 3400 m use to cope with environmental temperatures. We measured body, preferred, critical maximum and minimum temperatures, and sprint speed at different body temperatures of individuals, as well as operative temperatures. Anolis heterodermus exhibits behavioral adjustments in response to changes in environmental temperatures across altitudes. Likewise, physiological traits exhibit intrapopulation variations, but they are similar among populations, tended to the ``static{''} side of the evolution of thermal traits spectrum. The thermoregulatory behavioral strategy in this species is extremely plastic, and lizards adjust even to fluctuating environmental conditions from day to day. Unlike other Anolis species, at low thermal quality of the habitat, lizards are thermoconformers, particularly at the highest altitudes, where cloudy days can intensify this strategy even more. Our study reveals that the pattern of strategies for dealing with thermal ambient variations and their relation to extinction risks in the tropics that are caused by global warming is perhaps more complex for lizards than previously thought.",2020,89,NA,NA
Brown adipose tissue plays thermoregulatory role within the thermoneutral zone in Mongolian gerbils (<i>Meriones unguiculatus</i>),"Guo, Yang-Yang and Chi, Qing-Sheng and Zhang, Xue-Ying and Liu, Wei and Hao, Shao-Yan and Wang, De-Hua",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.02.015,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays an important role in thermoregulation and many metabolic processes in small mammals, especially in cold adaptation.

We hypothesized that BAT atrophied near the lower critical temperature and further atrophied near the upper critical temperature. Male gerbils were acclimated to 23 degrees C, 27 degrees C or 37 degrees C, respectively, for 3 weeks. Results showed that regulatory non-shivering thermogenesis did not change in gerbils acclimated to 27 degrees C compared with 23 degrees C group, whereas it was reduced by 43.5\% in gerbils acclimated to 37 degrees C. Bigger lipid droplet in BAT was observed in gerbils acclimated to 27 degrees C and 37 degrees C compared with 23 degrees C group, while the expression of uncoupling protein 1 and tyrosine hydroxylase was only reduced in gerbils acclimated to 37 degrees C. Further, thermoneutral acclimation did not change BAT thermogenesis by down-regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha, PR domain containing 16, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha or peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma gene expression in BAT. In addition, body temperature was reduced in gerbils acclimated to 37 degrees C compared with 23 degrees C group, which was associated with a decreased resting metabolic rate and regulatory non-shivering thermogenesis. In conclusion, BAT does not atrophy near the lower critical temperature, whereas it atrophies near the upper critical temperature, suggesting that BAT may play thermoregulatory role within the TNZ in Mongolian gerbils.",2019,81,NA,137-145

The purpose of this investigation was to determine the extent to which prolonged environment-induced hyperthermia altered autophagy in oxidative skeletal muscle in a large animal model, serving the dual purpose of accurately modeling human physiology as well as agricultural production. We hypothesized that prolonged hyperthermia would induce autophagy in skeletal muscle, independent of the accompanying caloric restriction. To test this hypothesis pigs were treated as follows: thermoneutral (20 degrees C), heat stress (35 degrees C), or were held under thermoneutral conditions but pair-fed to the heat stress group for seven days. Upon euthanasia the red portion of the semitendinosus was collected. We found that prolonged hyperthermic exposure increased oxidative stress without a corresponding change in antioxidant enzyme activities. Hyperthermia prevented initiation of autophagy despite increased markers of nucleation, elongation and autophagosome formation. However, p62 relative protein abundance, which is inversely correlated with autophagic degradation, was strongly increased suggesting suppressed degradation of autophagosomes. Markers of mitophagy and mitochondrial abundance were largely similar between groups.

The value of CTmax decreased significantly under hypoxia (39.10 +/- 0.96 degrees C) compared to normoxia (43.70 +/- 0.91 degrees C).

Survival was higher when immatures were exposed to medium temperatures (20-30 degrees C) compared with those lived in a more extreme temperature regime ( <20 and > 30 degrees C). Wasps failed to complete their development at 15 and 37.5 degrees C. Thermal parameters (upper, lower and optimum developmental threshold, thermal constant) were estimated by fitting the linear and a non-linear (Logan I) model to our data. Upper and lower developmental thresholds ranged between 35.1-37.0 degrees C and 13.2-13.8 degrees C, respectively. The optimum temperature for development was estimated between 33.6 degrees C and 34.6 degrees C. Tests for developmental rate isomorphy (DRI) showed that change in the average proportion of time spent in each developmental stage was marginally significant, proving that development of C. tarsalis is probably incompatible with DRI.

As a result, yaks increased body temperatures and respiratory rates in response to HS. Eight differential proteins mainly related to vasodilatation were decreased by HS, but another four proteins associated with blood oxygen delivery were presented at higher levels. Complement and coagulation cascades pathway was activated by HS, and more proteins were upregulated to protect against inflammation and oxidative stress by higher levels of antioxidant proteins. It is likely that yaks react to HS with enhancement of immunomodulation, anti-oxidation, and blood oxygen delivery, which is conducive to taking appropriate environment and nutrition management strategies to get healthy and high-performing yaks in low-altitude regions during summer.",2024,123,NA,NA

Our treatments were designed to mimic temperature fluctuations in the vicinity of industrial thermal effluents. Embryos were either maintained at control temperatures (3 degrees C) or exposed to a repeated thermal stress (TS) of 3 or 6 degrees C above control temperature every 3 or 6 days throughout embryonic development. At 82 days post-fertilisation, repeated TS treatments were stopped and embryos received either a high level TS of 12, 15, or 18 degrees C above ambient temperature for 1 or 4 h, or no additional TS. These treatments were carried out after a 6 h recovery from the last repeated TS. Embryos in the no repeated TS group responded, as expected, with increases in hsp70 mRNA in response to 12, 15 and 18 degrees C high-level TS. However, exposure to repeated TS of 3 or 6 C every 6 days also resulted in a significant upregulation of hsp70 mRNA relative to the controls. Importantly, these repeated TS events and the associated elevations in hsp70 attenuated the upregulation of hsp70 in response to a 1 h, high-level TS of 12 degrees C above ambient, but not to either longer (4 h) or higher (15 or 18 degrees C) TS events. Conversely, hsp90 alpha mRNA levels were not consistently elevated in the no repeated TS groups exposed to high-level TS. In some instances, hsp90 alpha levels appeared to decrease in embryos exposed to repeated TS followed by a high-level TS. The observed attenuation of the HSR in lake whitefish embryos demonstrates that embryos of this species have plasticity in their HSR and repeated TS may protect against high-level TS, but the response differs based on repeated TS treatment, high-level TS temperature and duration, and the gene of interest.",2021,100,NA,NA
Hypoxia-inducible factor-1? is involved in the response to heat stress in lactating dairy cows,"Zhang, Xu and Wang, Diming and Liu, Jianxin",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103460,"Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) is important in maintaining cellular oxygen homeostasis and cellular heat tolerance. To explore the role of HIF-1 alpha in the response to heat stress (HS) in dairy cows, 16 Chinese Holstein cows (milk yield: 32 \& PLUSMN; 4 kg/d, days in milk: 272 \& PLUSMN; 7 d, parity: 2-3) were used to collect coccygeal vein blood and milk samples when cows were under mild (temperature-humidity index = 77) and moderate HS (temperature-humidity index = 84), respectively. Compared to cows under mild HS, the respiratory rate (P < 0.01), rectal temperature (P < 0.01), and blood concentrations of heat shock protein (HSP)70 (P < 0.01) and HSP27 (P < 0.01) were higher, but oxygen saturation (P = 0.02) and hemoglobin (P < 0.01) were lower in cows under moderate HS. Blood HIF-1 alpha concentration was greater (P < 0.01) during moderate HS, indicating that HIF-1 alpha is involved in lactating cows' response to HS. To confirm these findings, we collected coccygeal vein blood and milk samples from 59 dairy cows under moderate HS. The HIF-1 alpha levels were correlated with the levels of heat shock transcription factor (HSF) (r = 0.7857, P < 0.01), HSP70 (r = 0.4543, P < 0.01) and HSP27 (r = 0.8782, P < 0.01). A comparison of 15 cows with higher HIF-1 alpha (> 482 ng/L) and 15 cows with lower HIF-1 alpha levels (< 439 ng/L) showed that reactive oxidative species were higher (P = 0.02), but superoxide dismutase (P < 0.01), total antioxidation capacity (P = 0.02) and glutathione peroxidase (P < 0.01) were lower in higher HIF-1 alpha cows. These results suggested that HIF-1 alpha may be indicative of the risk of oxidative stress in heat-stressed cows and may participate in the response of cows to HS by synergistically activating the expression of the HSP family with HSF.",2023,112,NA,NA

This study addresses this dearth in knowledge by exploring the dual effect of both micro- and macro-climate on the thermoregulatory responses of two subterranean rodent species belonging to the family Bathyergidae, namely the more arid dwelling Mahali mole-rat (Cryptomys hottentotus mahali) and less arid dwelling Highveld mole-rat (C. h. pretoriae). Open flow through respirometry was used to quantify resting metabolic rates (RMR), evaporative water loss (EWL), core body temperature (Tb), the ratio between the evaporative heat loss and metabolic heat production (EHL/MHP: evaporative cooling capacity) and conductance (C-dry) over a range of increasing ambient temperatures (T-a; 20-42 degrees C). Furthermore, RMR, EWL, T-b, EHL/MHP and C-dry were measured at the mole-rat's thermal maxima (43 degrees C). At cooler temperatures, the arid-dwelling C. h. mahali possesses a broader thermoneutral zone (similar to 5 degrees C; 27.2-32.1 degrees C), while C. h. pretoriae possess a single thermoneutral point (33.6 degrees C). This is in response to the greater selection pressure to conserve energy in the more arid regions inhabited by C. h. mahali. Contrastingly, at hotter temperatures, there were no significant thermoregulatory differences in EWL, EHL/MHP or C-dry responses between the two sub-species, as expected due to the limitations bestowed by the buffered microclimates (burrow systems). Thus, neither macro-climate, nor micro-climate singularly moulds the thermoregulatory adaptations, but rather, it appears to be a combined effect from both climates. Other small endotherms may share this dual response, and therefore, it is crucial to incorporate the effect of both macro- and microclimates into future climate models when determining the ecological capabilities and persistence of a species.",2021,99,NA,NA

For the hatching study, eggs were incubated in four temperatures (17, 20, 23, and 26 degrees C). The total hatching and free-swimming larvae percentage were higher at 23 degrees C (p < 0.05). Experiment I (for validation of the CTmax method) was carried out by incubating eggs at 17 degrees C and 23 degrees C. The CTmax was estimated in response to different warming rates (1-18 degrees C h(-1)), acclimation temperatures (17 and 23 degrees C), and the age of fishes (8, 15, 35 dph). The results suggested that a warming rate of 18 degrees C h(-1) could be used for the thermal tolerance study of yolk-sac larvae (8 dph) and 35 dph larvae, but for free-swimming larvae (15 dph) up to 3 degrees C h(-1) is suitable. Experiment II (for growth, SMR and thermal tolerance) was carried by acclimatizing 15 dph larvae in five temperatures (15, 19, 23, 27, and 31 degrees C) for 60 days. The mean growth rate increased with the increase in temperature from 15 degrees C to 27 degrees C (1.30-3.58\% day(-1)) and decreased at 31 degrees C. The mean SMR of the chocolate mahseer in the above acclimation temperatures was ranged from 1.14 +/- 0.36 to 2.81 +/- 0.15 mu gO(2)h(-1)mg(-1) and were significantly different (p < 0.01). The Q(10) with the SMR of the fish suggested the preferred temperature ranged between 23 and 27 degrees C, and the optimum temperature for growth (ToptG) was estimated to be 25 degrees C. Chocolate mahseer is an eurythermal species which is advantageous for aquaculture practices due to its wide thermal tolerance zone (411.68 degrees C-2 in 15 to 31 degrees C acclimation temperature range) and high ARR values (0.49 - 0.54).",2021,98,NA,NA
Unravelling the effects of elevated temperature on the physiological energetics of <i>Bellamya bengalensis</i>,"Baag, Sritama and Mahapatra, Sayantan and Mandal, Sumit",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102494,"Temperature is one of the key environmental factors affecting the eco-physiological responses of living organisms and is considered one of the utmost crucial factors in shaping the fundamental niche of a species. The purpose of the present study is to delineate the physiological response and changes in energy allocation strategy of Bellamya bengalensis, a freshwater gastropod in the anticipated summer elevated temperature in the future by measuring the growth, body conditions (change in total weight, change in organ to flesh weight ratio), physiological energetics (ingestion rate, absorption rate, respiration rate, excretion rate and Scope for Growth) and thermal performance, Arrhenius breakpoint temperature (ABT), thermal critical maxima (CTmax), warming tolerance (WT) as well as thermal safety margin (TSM) through a mesocosm experiment. We exposed the animals to three different temperatures, 25 degrees C (average habitat temperature for this animal) and elevated temperatures 30 degrees C, 35 degrees C for 30 days and changes in energy budget were measured twice (on 15th and 30th day). Significant changes were observed in body conditions as well as physiological energetics. The total body weight as well as the organ/flesh weight ratio, ingestion followed by absorption rate decreased whereas, respiration and excretion rate increased with elevated temperature treatments resulting in a negative Scope for Growth in adverse conditions. Though no profound impact was found on ABT/CTmax, the peak of thermal curve was considerably declined for animals that were reared in higher temperature treatments. Our data reflects that thermal stress greatly impact the physiological functioning and growth patterns of B. bengalensis which might jeopardize the freshwater ecosystem functioning in future climate change scenario.",2020,88,NA,NA
"Influence of water temperature and waterborne cadmium toxicity on growth performance and metallothionein-cadmium distribution in different organs of Nile tilapia, <i>Oreochromis niloticus</i> (L.)","Abdel-Tawwab, Mohsen and Wafeek, Mohammed",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2014.09.002,"Cadmium (Cd) is believed to be one of the most abundant and ubiquitously distributed toxins in the aquatic system. This metal is released to the aquatic environment from both anthropogenic sources, such as industrial, agricultural and urban effluents as well as natural sources, such as rocks and soils. Otherwise, the temperature increase of water bodies, which has been observed due to global climatic changes, has been shown to increase Cd toxicity for several aquatic animal species including fish. In the present study. Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloricus (L), (26.0 +/- 0.38 g) were reared at 20, 24, 28, or 32 degrees C and exposed to 0.0 or 0.5 mg Cd/L for 8 weeks to investigate effects of water temperature, Cd toxicity and their interaction on fish performance as well as metallothionein (MT) and Cd distribution in different fish organs. It was found that fish reared in Cd-free group at 28 degrees C showed the optimum growth and feed intake, while Cd-exposed fish showed low growth and feed intake irrespective to water temperature. A synergetic relationship between water temperature and Cd toxicity was observed where Cd toxicity increased as water temperature increased and the worse growth was obtained in Cd-exposed fish reared at 32 degrees C. Additionally, the highest Cd residues in different fish organs were detected in Cd-exposed fish reared at 32 degrees C. Similarly, MT concentrations in different fish organs increased as water temperature increased especially in Cd-exposed fish groups. A high positive correlation between MT and Cd concentrations in fish organs was detected. The distribution of MT and Cd levels was in the order of liver > kidney > gills > muscles. The present study revealed that the optimum water temperature suitable for Nile tilapia growth is 28 degrees C. Additionally, Cd exposure had a deteriorate effect on the growth and health of Nile tilapia. This hazardous effect increased as water temperature increased. Further, liver and kidney were the prime sites of Cd accumulation, while Cd load in the muscles was the lowest as compared to the other investigated organs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study we evaluated and described the effects of temperature during early development of E. chloroticus, identifying the optimum temperature range and upper thermal limit for successful development. The temperature range evaluated was between 15-24 degrees C which included the normal seawater temperatures during the spawning season in northern New Zealand, as well as the highest temperature projected by the IPCC for this region due to global warming (1-3 degrees C by the year 2100). Gametes from several females and males were used in the experiment. Fertilization was carried out at different temperatures and development was monitored at different time points after fertilization in each temperature. The development rate of E. chloroticus increased with an increase in seawater temperature. However, at temperatures higher than 21.5 degrees C the amount of abnormal development reached similar to 30\%. The optimum temperature for early development was between 15-21 degrees C, whereas the upper thermal limit was similar to 24 degrees C. Therefore, early development of E. chloroticus is negatively affected by an increase in seawater temperature of similar to 3-4 degrees C above current seawater temperature levels in northern New Zealand. The thermal sensitivity of early life stages of E. chloroticus could affect survival rates during early development of this species in a global warming scenario, which could impair recruitment in populations which are exposed to higher temperatures, leading to possible distributional shifts of this species.

Such data are particularly important for understanding invasion risks of tropical species introduced to temperate climates and identifying whether they can survive outside tropical regions. A breeding population of the tropical clawed frog ( Xenopus tropicalis ) was recently discovered in west-central Florida, U.S.A. This fully aquatic species is native to the rainforest belt of west Africa and has not been documented outside its native range. Because of the lack of invasion history, data are sparse on the thermal limits for this species. We used chronic lethal and critical thermal methodologies to investigate thermal tolerance on adult stages and critical thermal methods on tadpoles. Because of our use of both chronic and critical methodologies, we also examined the literature to reveal common methods used to investigate thermal minimum and maximum temperature in amphibians, which were found to be dominated by the critical maximum. Chronic lethal temperatures for adult X. tropicalis were 9.73 degrees C and 36.68 degrees C. Critical temperatures were affected by acclimation temperature and life stage; adults were more tolerant of extreme temperatures. Based on these critical thermal data and the fact that breeding tends to occur when temperatures are suitable for survival, tadpole stages are unlikely to be affected by extreme temperatures. Instead, range expansion in Florida will likely be limited by the adult stages. Our findings indicate that the tropical clawed frog could occupy much of southern Peninsular Florida and other tropical and subtropical regions worldwide.",2024,123,NA,NA
How plastic are upper thermal limits? A comparative study in tsetse (family: Glossinidae) and wider Diptera,"Weaving, Hester and Terblanche, John S. and English, Sinead",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103745,"Critical thermal maximum (CTmax) describes the upper thermal tolerance of an animal where biological functions start to fail. A period of acclimation can enhance CTmax through plasticity, potentially buffering animals from extreme temperatures caused by climate change. Basal and acclimated CTmax vary within and between species and may be explained by traits related to thermal physiology, such as body size and sex. Differences in CTmax have not been established among species of tsetse fly (Glossina spp.), vectors of animal and human African trypanosomiasis. Here, we investigated basal CTmax and its plasticity for five tsetse species following adult acclimation at constant 25 or 30 degrees C for five days. We then set our findings in context using a meta-analysis on 33 species of Diptera. We find that, of the five tsetse species considered, only Glossina palpalis gambiensis and Glossina brevipalpis exhibited plasticity of CTmax, with an increase of 0.12 degrees C and 0.10 degrees C per 1 degrees C acclimation respectively. Within some species, higher basal CTmax values were associated with larger body size and being female, while variation in plasticity (i.e., response to the acclimation temperature) could not be explained by sex or size. Our broader meta-analysis across Diptera revealed overall CTmax plasticity of 0.06 degrees C per 1 degrees C acclimation, versus a similar 0.05 degrees C mean increase in tsetse. In contrast, there was greater CTmax plasticity in males compared to females in Diptera. Our study highlights that CTmax and its plasticity varies even among closely related species. Broader patterns across groups are not always reflected at a finer resolution; we thus emphasise the need for detailed experimental studies across a wide range of insect species to capture their capacity to cope with rapidly warming temperatures.",2023,118,NA,NA
Dynamics of heat shock proteins and heat shock factor expression during heat stress in daughter workers in pre-heat-treated (rapid heat hardening) Apis mellifera mother queens,"Al-Ghzawi, Abd Al-Majeed A. and Al-Zghoul, Mohammad Borhan and Zaitoun, Shahera and Al-Omary, Ilham Mustafa and Alahmad, Nour Alhoda",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103194,"Honeybees have a limited capacity to control their body temperature when exposed to thermal changes in the atmosphere. Environmental changes, such as thermal climate change, have an adverse effect on honeybee survival. Insects can be pre-heat-treated (rapid heat hardening) with a mild heat stressor to induce Hsp gene expression and protect them from future stresses. Sixty accepted mother queen (MQ) larvae at the age of 7 days were selected and divided into two incubation treatment groups (n = 30). The control group (non-heat-treated mother queens, nH-T MQ) was maintained at 34.5 degrees C for 15 min and 70\% relative humidity (RH), and the preheat-treated (pre-heat-treated mother queens, pH-T MQ) group was subjected to 41 degrees C for 15 min and 70\% RH. To evaluate the effect of larval pre-heat-treatment on thermotolerance acquisition of daughter workers, about 500 workers were collected from brood combs of each treatment group. The worker bees in their cages were incubated in digital-controlled thermo-incubators for 1 h under each of the following temperatures: 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, and 60 degrees C.

In general, the pH-T MQ workers exhibited a higher ability to tolerate temperature than nH-T MQ workers under extreme conditions. Furthermore, we reported for the first time that pre-heat treatment of the mother queen's larvae alters the basal and dynamic expression of heat shock proteins (Hsp40, Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90) and heat shock factor (HSF) during thermoneutral conditions and during heat stress of daughter workers, probably indicating a substantial improvement of honeybees' thermotolerance acquisition in arid and semi-arid regions, and improvement of honeybee longevity and management strategies.",2022,104,NA,NA
Temperature effects on aerobic scope and cardiac performance of European perch (<i>Perca fluviatilis</i>),"Jensen, Denise Lyager and Overgaard, Johannes and Wang, Tobias and Gesser, Hans and Malte, Hans",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.04.006,"Several recent studies have highlighted how impaired cardiac performance at high temperatures and in hypoxia may compromise the capacity for oxygen transport. Thus, at high temperatures impaired cardiac capacity is proposed to reduce oxygen transport to a degree that lowers aerobic scope and compromises thermal tolerance (the oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT) hypothesis). To investigate this hypothesis, we measured aerobic and cardiac performance of a eurythermal freshwater teleost, the European perch (Perca fluviatilis). Rates of oxygen consumption were measured during rest and activity at temperatures between 5 degrees C and 27 degrees C, and we evaluated cardiac function by in vivo measurements of heart rate and in vitro studies to determine contractility of myocardial strips. Aerobic scope increased progressively from 5 degrees C to 21 degrees C, after which it levelled off. Heart rate showed a similar response. We found little difference between resting and active heart rate at high temperature suggesting that increased cardiac scope during activity is primarily related to changes in stroke volume. To examine the effects of temperature on cardiac capacity, we measured isometric force development in electrically paced myocardial preparations during different combinations of temperature, pacing frequency, oxygenation and adrenergic stimulation. The force-frequency product increased markedly upon adrenergic stimulation at 21 and 27 degrees C (with higher effects at 21 degrees C) and the cardiac preparations were highly sensitive to hypoxia. These findings suggest that at (critically) high temperatures, cardiac output may diminish due to a decreased effect of adrenergic stimulation and that this effect may be further exacerbated if the heart becomes hypoxic. Hence cardiac limitations may contribute to the inability to increase aerobic scope at high temperatures in the European perch (Perca fluviatilis).",2017,68,"B, SI",162-169
Thermal acclimation alters both basal heat shock protein gene expression and the heat shock response in juvenile lake whitefish (<i>Coregonus clupeaformis</i>),"Manzon, Lori A. and Zak, Megan A. and Agee, Matthew and Boreham, Douglas R. and Wilson, Joanna Y. and Somers, Christopher M. and Manzon, Richard G.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103185,"Long-term temperature shifts associated with seasonal variability are common in temperate regions. However, these natural shifts could place significant strain on thermal stress responses of fishes when combined with mean increases in water temperatures predicted by climate change models. We examined the relationship between thermal acclimation, basal expression of heat shock protein (hsp) genes and the activation of the heat shock response (HSR) in lake whitefish (LWF; Coregonus clupeaformis), a cold water species of cultural and commercial significance. Juveniles were acclimated to either 6, 12, or 18 degrees C water for several months prior to the quantification of hsp mRNA levels in the presence or absence of acute heat shock (HS). Acclimation to 18 degrees C increased basal mRNA levels of hsp70 and hsp47, but not hsc70 or hsp90 beta in gill, liver and white muscle, while 6 degrees C acclimation had no effect on basal hsp transcription. Fish in all acclimation groups were capable of eliciting a robust HSR following acute HS, as indicated by the upregulation of hsp70 and hsp47. An increase of only 2 degrees C above the 18 degrees C acclimation temperature was required to trigger these transcriptional changes, suggesting that the HSR may be frequently initiated in LWF populations living at mildly elevated temperatures. Collectively, these expression profiles show that environmental temperature influences both basal hsp levels and the HSR in LWF, and indicate that these fish may have a greater physiological and ecological susceptibility to elevated temperatures than to cooler temperatures.",2022,104,NA,NA

The objective of this study was to focus on the combined effects of temperature (14, 18 and 22 degree celsius) and food quality on the performance of larvae produced by 5 young (0+) and 5 old (I+) Palaemon serratus females. We prepared 3 diets based on Artemia, in decreasing order of total fatty acid content: freshly hatched nauplii (N), unenriched metanauplii (M) and metanauplii enriched with a mixture of microalgae (ME). At hatching, the larvae produced by I+ females had a higher biomass but a similar fatty acid concentration to those produced by 0+ females. Larvae survived better and developed relatively faster as temperature increased, and the longer they waited to metamorphose, the greater their weight at metamorphosis. These performances were diet-dependent, with more survival and more growth in less time with diet N than with the other two. Larvae from I+ females performed better than those from 0+ females, especially under the most stressful conditions. The greater biomass of the larvae of I+ females seems to have enabled them to follow a shorter, and therefore faster, development path than those of 0+ females. The larvae's diet also had an impact on post-metamorphic composition: larvae eating a diet richer in fatty acids produced richer juveniles and those eating a poorer diet produced juveniles with slightly more essential fatty acids. This study supports the high plasticity of caridean shrimp larval development and the importance of maternal effects on the fitness of offspring.",2024,119,NA,NA
Thermal biology in the Upper Galili Mountain blind mole rat (Nannospalax galili) and an overview of spalacine energetics,"Sumbera, Radim and Lovy, Matej and Nevo, Eviatar and Okrouhlik, Jan",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103618,"Several hundred mammalian species thrive in complex burrow systems, which protect them from climatic ex-tremes and predation. At the same time, it is also a stressful environment due to low food supply, high humidity, and, in some cases, a hypoxic and hypercapnic atmosphere. To face such conditions, subterranean rodents have convergently evolved low basal metabolic rate, high minimal thermal conductance and low body temperature. Although these parameters have been intensively studied in the last decades, such information is far from being well-known in one of the most studied groups of subterranean rodents, the blind mole rats of the genus Nan-nospalax. The lack of information is particularly noticeable for parameters such as the upper critical temperature and the width of the thermoneutral zone. In our study, we analysed the energetics of the Upper Galilee Mountain blind mole rat Nannospalax galili and found its basal metabolic rate of 0.84 \& PLUSMN; 0.10 mL O2xg-1 x h-1, thermoneutral zone between 28 and 35 degrees C, mean Tb within the zone of 36.3 \& PLUSMN; 0.6 degrees C, and minimal thermal conductance equal to 0.082 mL O2xg-1 x h-1 x C-1. Nannospalax galili is a truly homeothermic rodent well adapted to face lower ambient temperatures, because its Tb was stable down to the lowest temperature measured (10 degrees C). At the same time, a relatively high basal metabolic rate and relatively low minimal thermal conductance for a subterranean rodent of such body mass, and the difficulty of surviving ambient temperatures slightly above upper critical temperature, indicates problems with sufficient heat dissipation at higher temperatures. This can easily lead to overheating, that is relevant mainly during the hot-dry season. These findings suggest that N. galili can be threatened by ongoing global climate change.",2023,115,NA,NA

Thus, we investigated the effects of a 96-h exposure to constant temperatures (CT: 27, 30.5, 34, 39, 41, or 43 degrees C) and fluctuating temperatures (FT: 27/34 degrees C, 12/12 h) on the survival, metabolic rate, and oviposition of the female cricket Gryllus (Gryllus) assimilis (Orthoptera: Gryllidae). Mortality, body mass and water content of females and males were quantified and compared. It was found that CT27, CT34 and FT27/34 do not cause mortality in females of G. (G.) assimilis. CT30.5 (average temperature between 27 and 34), despite causing mortality of 5.0 +/- 3.5\%, do not differ from CT27, CT34 or FT27/34. CT39 causes a mortality of 8.3 +/- 5.5\%. Estimated lethal temperature for 50\% of the population of females (LT50Temp) is 40 degrees C, and 43 degrees C promotes 100\% mortality in 96 h. Comparing mortality between sexes, females present higher LT50Temp and thermotolerance than males. In addition, FT27/34 and CT34 do not differ in the metabolic rate, but both have higher values than CT27. CT34 strongly reduces oviposition in females, however FT27/34 does not. We suggest that CT34 reduces oviposition in females in two ways: by affecting the endocrine system related to egg production, or by causing behavioral egg retention, as a strategy to survive thermal stress. Moreover, females had a higher wet body mass and present a lower average weight loss than males. In conclusion, despite females present a higher mortality at temperatures above 39 degrees C, they are more thermotolerant than males. Furthermore, CT34 is detrimental to the oviposition of G.

Transcriptomic data were validated using qRT-PCR, which confirmed that they were consistent. In this paper, the temperature tolerance of C. chinensis adults was evaluated and the results showed that female adults were more sensitive to heat and cold stress than males, and the upregulation of heat shock protein and epidermal protein was the largest in DEGs after heat and cold stress, respectively. These findings provide a reference for further understanding the biological characteristics of C. chinensis adults and the molecular mechanisms underlying the response to low and high temperatures.",2023,112,NA,NA
"Effects of semi-constant temperature on embryonic and hatchling phenotypes of six-tubercled Amazon River turtles, Podocnemis sextuberculata","Camillo, Cassia S. and Valenzuela, Nicole and Johnson, Steve A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103292,"Purpose: We evaluated how constant incubation temperatures affect life-history traits pre-hatching and post -hatching of the six-tubercled Amazon River turtle, Podocnemis sextuberculata. Methods: We incubated eggs from natural nests at ten semi-constant temperatures between 22.26 +/- 1.01 degrees C and 37.37 +/- 0.38 degrees C (2013) and at six temperatures between 25.75 +/- 0.22 degrees C and 36.17 +/- 0.15 degrees C (2016). In 2013, we raised hatchling for 90 days to evaluate effects of temperature on early hatchling growth. We evaluated maternal effects in 2016.Results: P. sextuberculata displays temperature-dependent sex determination and produces males at colder and females at warmer temperatures (TSD Ia). The estimated pivotal temperature was 33.73 +/- 0.15 degrees C and the transitional range of temperatures (TRT) 1.16 +/- 0.59 degrees C. Semi-constant temperatures below 26 degrees C and above 38 degrees C were lethal. Intermediate temperatures (32.25 degrees C and 31.5 degrees C, respectively) were optimal for hatching success and produced larger hatchlings that grew slower early in life compared to colder or warmer conditions, which produced smaller hatchlings. Warmer incubation temperatures within the optimal range (28 degrees C-37 degrees C) accelerated embryonic development. In contrast, comparisons of 30, 60 and 90 days-old suggests that warmer incubation temperatures reduced growth and mass gain rates post-hatching, such that incubation temperature effects on body size at emergence disappeared by 3 months of age.Conclusions: Six-tubercled Amazon River turtles showed the highest pivotal temperature reported for any turtle. The relatively narrow TRT may limit the evolutionary potential of this vulnerable turtle in the face of global warming. Future incubation experiments at a finer scale (33 degrees C-36 degrees C) are warranted to refine the sex-ratio re-action norm. Field studies that monitor natural nests are imperative to evaluate conservation measures and the effect of female-biased illegal hunting and climate change. By providing data about the thermal biology of an understudied lineage of non-model species, our study helps fill gaps in our understanding of the evolution of vertebrate sex determination and its potential adaptive value.",2022,108,NA,NA
"Effects of recent thermal history on thermal behaviour, thermal tolerance and oxygen uptake of Yellowtail Kingfish (<i>Seriola lalandi</i>) juveniles","Larios-Soriano, Ernesto and Re-Araujo, Ana Denisse and Diaz, Fernando and Lopez-Galindo, Laura L. and Rosas, Carlos and Ibarra-Castro, Leonardo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103023,"This study determined the physiological and metabolic responses of cultivated Yellowtail Kingfish (Seriola lalandi) juveniles in accordance with their recent thermal history. The fish were acclimated at 20, 23, 26, 29 and 32 degrees C for 21 days to determine the final preferred temperature, thermal tolerance and the effect of acclimation temperatures on their oxygen uptake and aerobic scope. The final preferred temperature of juveniles was established at 26 degrees C. The critical thermal maximum (CTmax) ranged from 34.2 to 36.9 degrees C, while the critical thermal minimum (CTmin) ranged from 10.9 to 17.3 degrees C, depending on acclimation temperature. With the CTmax and CTmin values, the thermal window was determined to have an area of 258 degrees C-2, which is characteristic of subtropical organisms. Although, the metabolic rate was relatively constant (ranging 390.6-449.8 mg O-2 kg(-0.8)h(-1)) between 20 and 26 degrees C (Q(10) = 1.6, 1.0), an increase to 544.8 mg O-2 kg(-0.8)h(-1) at 29 degrees C (Q(10) = 1.9) and decrease of 478.4 mg O-2 kg(-0.8)h(-1) at 32 degrees C (Q10 = 0.6) were observed. The maximum value obtained for aerobic scope was 310.9 mg O-2 kg(-0.8)h(-1) degrees C. These results suggest that the acclimation temperature of 26 degrees C is an optimum thermal condition for a physiological and metabolic performance of yellowtail kingfish juveniles. On the contrary, the response observed during the evaluation of critical temperatures, oxygen uptake and aerobic scope indicated that yellowtail kingfish in the juvenile state could be vulnerable when it experiences for long periods (e.g., >21 days) temperatures above 29 degrees C. According to our results, the thermoregulatory behaviour of yellowtail kingfish in the juvenile stages could be one of the most important mechanisms to maintain its optimal physiological performance by actively selecting a stable thermal environment close to 26 degrees C. In addition, it was determined the limits of the pejus state of juvenile yellowtail kingfish at 29 degrees C, where an increase of oxygen uptake to maintain the aerobic energy metabolism was observed, this could certainly affect the growth of juveniles in culture systems if they do not return in a thermal range of 23-26 degrees C. These results can contribute to infer the different effects of acclimation temperature on the growth, thermal tolerance and respiratory capacity of S. lalandi juveniles on aquaculture systems.",2021,99,NA,NA

Forest patterns are likely to interact with this process, but very few studies have examined their contribution in determining distribution limits. 2: We examined the role played by thermal physiology and forest cover in determining the elevational ranges of a lizard, Eutropis longicaudata. We integrated this species' thermal traits in simulating its maximum activity time under different conditions of forest cover and elevation using a NicheMapR model. In addition, we evaluated the influence of winter temperatures on the range limit by examining the simulated soil temperatures at the occurrence sites. 3: Laboratory experiments showed that E. longicaudata has a high preferred body temperature and low cold tolerance. The model predicts that maximum activity time decreases with elevation and forest cover. Although unforested areas may provide longer active time in all simulated elevations, mountain areas in Taiwan are heavily forested and are predicted to allow only a very short period of activity above 1000 m elevation. 4: All sightings were indeed located in areas below 1000 m elevation, in which the predicted average soil temperature is above 10 degrees C in January in cold years. 5: Our results show that reptile physiological response does respond strongly to the change of microclimate induced by forest cover and elevation. Overall, this suggests that forest cover is a major determinant of some reptiles' elevational range.",2020,93,NA,NA
Physical mechanism or evolutionary trade-off? Factors dictating the relationship between metabolic rate and ambient temperature in carabid beetles,"Gudowska, Agnieszka and Schramm, Bartosz W. and Czarnoleski, Marcin and Kozlowski, Jan and Bauchinger, Ulf",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.11.009,"The tight association between ambient temperature (T) and metabolic rate (MR) is a common occurrence in ectotherms, but the determinants of this association are not fully understood. This study examined whether the relationship between MR and T is the same among individuals, as predicted by the Universal Temperature Dependence hypothesis, or whether this relationship differs between them. We used flow-through respirometry to measure standard MR and to determine gas exchange patterns for 111 individuals of three Carabidae species which differ in size (Abax ovalis, Carabus linnei and C. coriaceus), exposed to four different temperatures (ten individuals of each species measured at 6, 11, 16 and 21 degrees C). We found a significant interaction between In body mass and the inverse of temperature, indicating that in a given species, the effect of temperature on MR was weaker in larger individuals than in smaller individuals. Overall, this finding shows that the thermal dependence of MR is not body mass invariant. We observed three types of gas exchange patterns among beetles: discontinuous, cyclic and continuous. Additionally, the appearance of these patterns was associated with MR and T. Evolution in diverse terrestrial environments could affect diverse ventilation patterns, which accommodate changes in metabolism in response to temperature variation. In conclusion, explaining the variance in metabolism only through fundamental physical laws of thermodynamics, as predicted by the Universal Temperature Dependence hypothesis, appears to oversimplify the complexity of nature, ignoring evolutionary trade-offs that should be taken into account in the temperature metabolism relationship.",2017,68,A,89-95
"Heat stress is associated with disruption of ion balance in the migratory locust, <i>Locusta migratoria</i>","O'Sullivan, James D. B. and MacMillan, Heath A. and Overgaard, Johannes",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.04.001,"Thermal tolerance is important in determining the spatial and temporal distributions of insects but the mechanisms which determine upper thermal limits remain poorly understood. In terrestrial insects heat tolerance is unlikely to be limited by oxygen supply but in some arthropods, heat stress has been shown to cause haemolymph hyperkalaemia which is known to have detrimental effects on neuromuscular excitability. It is however unresolved if heat-induced hyperkalemia is the cause or the result of cellular heat injury. To address the putative role of heat-induced hyperkalemia we quantified changes in ion and water balance in haemolymph and muscle tissue of the migratory locust during exposure to two static temperatures clustered around the CTmax (48 degrees C and 50 degrees C). We show that heat stress caused a loss of ion balance and severe haemolymph hyperkalaemia which coincided with the onset of heat stupor. Locusts were able to maintain their haemolymph volume throughout exposure, suggesting it is unlikely that osmoregulatory failure is responsible for haemolymph hyperkalaemia. When locusts were allowed to recover from heat stupor, they recovered ion balance quickly but were still unable to function optimally after 24 h. The results therefore indicate that both the haemolymph hyperkalaemia and associated depression of muscular function (heat stupor) are secondary results of cellular heat injury and that the cause of heat stupor most be sought elsewhere.",2017,68,"B, SI",177-185

The animals tend to maintain homeostasis through physiological adjustments in a hot environment (maximum temperature reaches up to 47.5 degrees C). Therefore, the present study was carried out to assess the effect of thermal exposure on physiological adaptability and seminal attributes of rams under semi-arid environment. The experiment was conducted for eight weeks involving sixteen Malpura crossbred rams (GMM: Garole X Malpura X Malpura). The rams were divided equally into two groups, designated as GI and G2, respectively. The rams in GI (Control) group were kept in a sheep shed under naturally prevailing environment without artificial manipulation of ambient temperature (Temperature 30.48 +/- 0.38 degrees C; Relative Humidity 28.59 +/- 1.15\%). The rams of G2 group were exposed to different temperature at different hours of the day (38 degrees C at 1000-1100 h; 40 degrees C at 1100-1200 h; 42 degrees C at 12:00-1300 h; 43 degrees C at 1300-1400 h; 44 degrees C at 1400-1500 h and 42 degrees C at 1500-1600 h) in a climatic chamber for thermal exposure. Physiological responses, blood biochemical profile, blood endocrine profile, sexual behavior and seminal attributes were measured for both the groups. Thermal exposure significantly (P <0.05) increased the water intake; respiration rate, rectal temperature and skin temperature at afternoon in rams. Exposure of rams to thermal stress (G2) significantly (P < 0.05) increased cortisol level and decreased tri-ido-thyronine level. The latency period after the first ejaculation, decreased significantly (P < 0.05) in G2. The percentage of rapid motile sperm, linearity and average path velocity of sperm were also altered significantly (P < 0.05) in thermal exposed rams as compared to control.

"The peak of thermoregulation effectiveness: Thermal biology of the Pyrenean rock lizard, <i>Iberolacerta bonnali</i> (Squamata, Lacertidae)","Ortega, Zaida and Mencia, Abraham and Perez-Mellado, Valentin",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.01.005,"We studied, at 2200 m altitude, the thermal biology of the Pyrenean rock lizard, lberolacerta bonnali, in the glacial cirque of Cotatuero (National Park of Ordesa, Huesca, Spain). The preferred thermal range (PTR) of I. bonnali indicates that it is a cold-adapted ectotherm with a narrow PTR (29.20-32.77 degrees C). However, its PTR (3.57 degrees C) is twice as wide as other lberolacerta lizards, which may be explained by its broader historical distribution. The studied area is formed by a mosaic of microhabitats which offer different operative temperatures, so that lizards have, throughout their entire daily period of activity, the opportunity to choose the most thermally suitable substrates. I bonnali achieves an effectiveness of thermoregulation of 0.95, which makes it the highest value found to date among the Lacertidae, and one of the highest among lizards. Their relatively wide distribution, their wider PTR, and their excellent ability of thermoregulation, would make I. bonnali lizards less vulnerable to climate change than other species of lberolacerta. Thanks to its difficult access, the studied area is not visited by a large number of tourists, as are other areas of the National Park. Thus, it is a key area for the conservation of the Pyrenean rock lizard. By shuttling between suitable microhabitats, lizards achieve suitable body temperatures during all day. However, such thermally suitable microhabitats should vary in other traits than thermal quality, such as prey availability or predation risk. Hence, it seems that these not-thermal traits are not constraining habitat selection and thermoregulation in this population. Therefore, future research in this population may study the causes that would lead lizards to prioritize thermoregulation to such extent in this population. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Effect of warming rate on the critical thermal maxima of crabs, shrimp and fish","Vinagre, Catarina and Leal, Ines and Mendonca, Vanessa and Flores, Augusto A. V.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2014.10.012,"The threat of global warming has prompted numerous recent studies on the thermal tolerance of marine species. A widely used method to determine the upper thermal limit has been the Critical Thermal Maximum (CTMax), a dynamic method, meaning that temperature is increased gradually until a critical point is reached. This method presents several advantages over static methods, however, there is one main issue that hinders interpretation and comparison of CTMax results: the rate at which the temperature is increased. This rate varies widely among published protocols. The aim of the present work was to determine the effect of warming rate on CTMax values, using different animal groups. The influence of the thermal niche occupied by each species (intertidal vs subtidal) and habitat (intertidal vs subtidal) was also investigated. CTMax were estimated at three different rates: 1 degrees C min(-1),1 degrees C 30 min(-1) and 1 degrees C h(-1), in two species of crab, Eurypanopeus abbreviatus and Menippe nodifrons, shrimp Palaemon northropi and Hippolyte obliquimanus and fish Bathygobius soporator and Parablennius marmoreus. While there were significant differences in the effect of warming rates for some species, for other species warming rate produced no significant differences (H. obliquimanus and B. soporator). While in some species slower warming rates lead to lower CTMax values (P. northropi and P. marmoreus) in other species the opposite occurred (E. abbreviatus and M. nodifrons). Biological group has a significant effect with crabs' CTMax increasing at slower warming rates, which did not happen for shrimp and fish. Subtidal species presented lower CTMax, at all warming rates tested. This study highlights the importance of estimating CTMax values at realistic rates that species encounter in their environment and thus have an ecological value. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

"Effects of autonomic blockade on acute thermal tolerance and cardioventilatory performance in rainbow trout, <i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>","Ekstrom, Andreas and Jutfelt, Fredrik and Sandblom, Erik",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2014.06.002,"Predicted future increases in global temperature may impose challenges for ectothermic animals like fish, but the physiological mechanisms determining the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) are not well understood. One hypothesis suggests that impaired cardiac performance, limited by oxygen supply, is an important underlying mechanism. Since vagal bradycardia is suggested to improve cardiac oxygenation and adrenergic stimulation may improve cardiac contractility and protect cardiac function at high temperatures, we predicted that pharmacological blockade of cardiac autonomic control would lower CTmax. Rainbow trout was instrumented with a flow probe and a ventilation catheter for cardioventilatory recordings and exposed to an acute thermal challenge until CTmax following selective pharmacological blockade of muscarinic or beta-adrenergic receptors. Contrary to our prediction, CTmax (similar to 26 degrees C) was unchanged between treatments. While beta-adrenergic blockade reduced heart rate it did not impair cardiac stroke volume across temperatures suggesting that compensatory increases in cardiac filling pressure may serve to maintain cardiac output. While warming resulted in significant tachycardia and increased cardiac output, a high cholinergic tone on the heart was observed at temperatures approaching CTmax. This may represent a mechanism to maintain scope for heart rate and possibly to improve myocardial contractility and oxygen supply at high temperatures. This is the first study evaluating the importance of autonomic cardiac control on thermal tolerance in fish. While no effects on CTmax were observed, this study raises important questions about the underlying mechanisms determining thermal tolerance limits in ectothermic animals. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Global climate change increases temperature variation and the frequency of extreme temperatures, which may pose challenges to ectotherms. Here, we examine phenotypic plasticity to temperature and genotypic effects on thermal tolerance in the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia). We found no significant difference in heat or cold tolerance in populations originating from a continental climate in China and from Finland with moderate temperature variation. Acclimation to large-amplitude temperature variation increased heat tolerance in both populations, but decreased cold tolerance and increased hsp70-2 expression in the Chinese population only. The latter result indicates a genotypic effect in the response to temperature variation. In the Finnish population, a non-synonymous SNP in the phosphoglucose isomerase (Pgi) gene was associated with heat knock-down time. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2014,42,NA,33-39

Thermal and oxygen conditions during development cause common rough woodlice (<i>Porcellio scaber</i>) to alter the size of their gas-exchange organs,"Antol, Andrzej and Labecka, Anna Maria and Horvathova, Terezia and Zielinski, Bartosz and Szabla, Natalia and Vasko, Yaroslav and Pecio, Anna and Kozlowski, Jan and Czarnoleski, Marcin",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102600,"Terrestrial isopods have evolved pleopodal lungs that provide access to the rich aerial supply of oxygen. However, isopods occupy conditions with wide and unpredictable thermal and oxygen gradients, suggesting that they might have evolved adaptive developmental plasticity in their respiratory organs to help meet metabolic demand over a wide range of oxygen conditions. To explore this plasticity, we conducted an experiment in which we reared common rough woodlice (Porcellio scaber) from eggs to maturation at different temperatures (15 and 22 degrees C) combined with different oxygen levels (10\% and 22\% O-2). We sampled animals during development (only females) and then examined mature adults (both sexes). We compared woodlice between treatments with respect to the area of their pleopod exopodites (our proxy of lung size) and the shape of Bertalanffy's equations (our proxy of individual growth curves). Generally, males exhibited larger lungs than females relative to body size. Woodlice also grew relatively fast but achieved a decreased asymptotic body mass in response to warm conditions; the oxygen did not affect growth. Under hypoxia, growing females developed larger lungs compared to under normoxia, but only in the late stage of development. Among mature animals, this effect was present only in males. Woodlice reared under warm conditions had relatively small lungs, in both developing females (the effect was increased in relatively large females) and among mature males and females. Our results demonstrated that woodlice exhibit phenotypic plasticity in their lung size. We suggest that this plasticity helps woodlice equilibrate their gas exchange capacity to differences in the oxygen supply and metabolic demand along environmental temperature and oxygen gradients. The complex pattern of plasticity might indicate the effects of a balance between water conservation and oxygen uptake, which would be especially pronounced in mature females that need to generate an aqueous environment inside their brood pouch.",2020,90,NA,NA

Remarkable insensitivity of acorn ant morphology to temperature decouples the evolution of physiological tolerance from body size under urban heat islands,"Yilmaz, Aaron R. and Chick, Lacy D. and Perez, Abe and Strickler, Stephanie A. and Vaughn, Selby and Martin, Ryan A. and Diamond, Sarah E.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102426,"Environmental temperature can alter body size and thermal tolerance, yet the effects of temperature rise on the size-tolerance relationship remain unclear. Terrestrial ectotherms with larger body sizes typically exhibit greater tolerance of high (and low) temperatures. However, while warming tends to increase tolerance of high temperatures through phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary change, warming tends to decrease body size through these mechanisms and thus might indirectly contribute to worse tolerance of high temperatures. These contrasting effects of warming on body size, thermal tolerance, and their relationship are increasingly important in light of global climate change. Here, we used replicated urban heat islands to explore the size-tolerance relationship in response to warming. We performed a common garden experiment with a small acorn-dwelling ant species collected from urban and rural populations across three different cities and reared under five laboratory rearing temperatures from 21 to 29 degrees C. We found that acorn ant body size was remarkably insensitive to laboratory rearing temperature (ant workers exhibited no phenotypic plasticity in body size across rearing temperature) and among populations experiencing cooler rural versus warmer urban environmental temperatures (no evolved differences in body size between urban and rural populations). Further, this insensitivity of body size to temperature was highly consistent across each of the three cities we examined. Because body size was robust to temperature variation, previously described plastic and evolved shifts in heat (and cold) tolerance in acorn ant responses to urbanization were shown to be independent of shifts in body size. Indeed, genetic (colony-level) correlations between heat and cold tolerance traits and body size revealed no significant association between size and tolerance. Our results show how typical trait correlations, such as between size and thermal tolerance, might be decoupled as populations respond to contemporary environmental change.",2019,85,NA,NA

Social thermoregulation and socio-physiological effect in the subterranean Mashona mole-rat (<i>Fukomys darlingi</i>),"Wiedenova, Pavlina and Sumbera, Radim and Okrouhlik, Jan",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.10.020,"A strict underground style of life is one of the greatest challenges for mammals partly due to the high energetic cost of obtaining food by digging through a mechanically resistant substrate. Any energy saving adaptation, for example the effect of social thermoregulation, is thus very important for subterranean mammals. It has also been suggested that social mammals may suffer from ``isolation stress{''} if measured alone, because the presence of other family member(s) may decrease the stress levels and thus their metabolic rates. This phenomenon known as a socio-physiological effect should be conspicuous when the metabolism of huddling individuals is measured within a species' thermoneutral zone (TNZ), where no energetic costs for body warming or cooling exist. In our study, we measured the resting metabolic rates of a social species of African mole-rat, the Mashona mole-rat (Fukomys darlingi), in individuals, pairs and groups of three to eight individuals. Measurements were carried out at ambient temperature below the species' TNZ (20 degrees C) to test the effect of social thermoregulation and at a temperature within the species' TNZ (30 degrees C) to test the socio-physiological effect. In pairs, the Mashona mole-rat saved 25\% of its individual energetic expenses at the temperature below the TNZ. With increasing group size, energetic savings rose up to four animals, but no savings were found in larger groups. At the temperature within the TNZ, mole-rats saved 10\% of individual energetic expenses in pairs, but the difference was not significant. Also, no energetic savings were found in larger groups within the TNZ.

Latitudinal patterns in temperature-dependent growth rates of a forest pathogen,"Pimentel, Carla S. and Ayres, Matthew P.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.11.018,"Direct effects of temperature on plant pathogens can be crucial to determine the onset and epidemiology of disease. The pinewood nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, the causal agent of the pine wilt disease (PWD), has a wide geographical distribution in Eurasia and East Asia, and local temperatures are considered determinant for the onset of the PWD. However, direct effects of temperature on this pathogen are never considered when forecasting its distribution and impact. In the present study we assessed: 1) at which temperatures is the development of wild populations of the pinewood nematode optimized; 2) if there is niche divergence on different populations from its wide distribution area. For this we studied two populations originated from different latitudes in eastern North America (NA), and used multi-model inference to evaluate the contributions of temperature, diet, and nematode population toward the growth rates of B. xylophilus. Although population origin had some effect on the predictive models, there seems to be niche conservatism, with temperatures of 28-29 degrees C maximizing the growth rates of the pathogen. Thus, the use of the number of days in the summer with temperatures between 25 and 31 degrees C would probably help to improve models forecasting B. xylophilus dispersion and PWD. The present work highlight the importance of considering adaptations to temperatures in forest pathogens with large geographical distributions, when building models forecasting the impact of climate on these organisms.",2018,72,NA,39-43
Paralysis and heart failure precede ion balance disruption in heat-stressed European green crabs,"Jorgensen, Lisa B. and Overgaard, Johannes and MacMillan, Heath A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.08.001,"Acute exposure of ectotherms to critically high temperatures causes injury and death, and this mortality has been associated with a number of physiological perturbations including impaired oxygen transport, loss of ion and water homeostasis, and neuronal failure. It is difficult to discern which of these factors, if any, is the proximate cause of heat injury because, for example, loss of ion homeostasis can impair neuromuscular function (including cardiac function), and conversely impaired oxygen transport reduces ATP supply and can thus reduce ion transport capacity. In this study we investigated if heat stress causes a loss of ion homeostasis in marine crabs and examined if such loss is related to heart failure. We held crabs (Carcinus maenas) at temperatures just below their critical thermal maximum and measured extracellular (hemolymph) and intracellular (muscle) ion concentrations over time. Analysis of Arrhenius plots for heart rates during heating ramps revealed a breakpoint temperature below which heart rate increased with temperature, and above which heart rate declined until complete cardiac failure. As hypothesised, heat stress reduced the Nernst equilibrium potentials of both and Nat, likely causing a depolarization of the membrane potential. To examine whether this loss of ion balance was likely to cause disruption of neuromuscular function, we exposed crabs to the same temperatures, but this time measured ion concentrations at the individual-specific times of complete paralysis (from which the crabs never recovered), and at the time of cardiac failure. Loss of ion balance was observed only after both paralysis and complete heart failure had occurred; indicating that the loss of neuromuscular function is not caused by a loss of ion homeostasis. Instead we suggest that the observed loss of ion balance may be linked to tissue damage related to heat death.",2017,68,"B, SI",186-194
"Influence of temperature on female, embryonic and hatchling traits in syntopic newts, <i>Ichthyosaura alpestris</i> and <i>Lissotriton vulgaris</i>","Mettouris, Onoufrios and Dalmyras, Dimitrios and Giokas, Sinos",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.10.008,"Amphibian populations have been declining globally for the last several decades, and climate change is often regarded as one of the most important factors driving these declines. Amphibians are particularly sensitive to climatic changes due to their physiological, ecological and behavioral characteristics. Here we performed a laboratory experiment to investigate how temperature affects ovipositing females, eggs and hatchlings in two syntopic populations of alpine newts, Ichthyosaura alpestris, and smooth newts, Lissotriton vulgaris. Female newts were assigned to two different oviposition temperatures (11 degrees C and 14 degrees C) for the duration of their oviposition period. Deposited eggs were equally divided and assigned to three different incubation temperatures (11 degrees C, 14 degrees C and 17 degrees C). We hypothesized that oviposition will be affected by temperature, that the combination of different oviposition and incubation temperatures may have an effect on embryonic and hatchling traits (embryonic mortality, days to hatch and hatchling length), and that these effects might differ between the two newt species. Temperature affected the number of deposited eggs in smooth newts, but not in alpine newts. Larval hatching success was not affected by oviposition or incubation temperature. Temperature effects on hatching time and hatchling length differed between the two species. These results suggest that temperature changes may have disparate effects on amphibian reproduction, even in syntopic taxa.",2017,63,NA,24-30
Changes of brain monoamine levels and physiological indexes during heat acclimation in rats,"Nakagawa, Hikaru and Matsumura, Takeru and Suzuki, Kota and Ninomiya, Chisa and Ishiwata, Takayuki",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.03.010,"Brain monoamines, such as noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA), and serotonin (5-HT), regulate many important physiological functions including thermoregulation. The purpose of this study was to clarify changes in NA, DA, and 5-HT levels in several brain regions in response to heat acclimation while also recording body temperature (Tb), heart rate (HR), and locomotor activity (Act). Rats were exposed to a heated environment (32 degrees C) for 3 h (3H), 1 day (1D), 7 days, 14 days (14D), 21 days, or 28 days (28D). After heat exposure, each of the following brain regions were immediately extracted and homogenized: the caudate putamen (CPu), preoptic area (PO), dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), frontal cortex (FC), and hippocampus (Hip). NA, DA, and 5-HT levels in the extract were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Although Tb increased immediately after heat exposure, it decreased about 14D later. HR was maintained at a low level throughout heat exposure, and Act tended to increase near the end of heat exposure. After 3H, we observed a marked increase in NA level in the CPu. Although this response vanished after 1D, the level increased again after 28D. DA level in the CPu decreased significantly from 1D to 28D. 5-HT level in the PO and DMH decreased from 1D to 14D. It returned to control levels after 28D with increment of DA level. 5-HT level in the FC decreased at the start of heat exposure, but recovered after 28D; a time point at which DA level also increased. Monoamine levels in the Hip were unchanged after early heat exposure, but both 5-HT and DA levels increased after 28D. These results provide definitive evidence of changes in monoamines in individual brain regions involved in thermoregulation and behavioral, cognitive, and memory function during both acute and chronic heat exposure.

Thermal acclimation in the perch (<i>Perca fluviatilis</i> L.) immunity,"Marnila, Pertti and Lilius, Esa-Matti",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2015.01.002,"Fish immune systems must be able to cope with pathogens over a wide temperature range. Earlier research suggest that fish are more dependent on innate immune responses based on pattern recognition than acquired functions with specific recognition. If this applies to phagocytes, then opsonins (serum factors that augment phagocytosis e.g. immunoglobulins and complement proteins) attached on zymosan (Z) particles should be recognized better at higher temperatures than Z only. Z is recognized by glucan receptor representing pattern recognition. In this study perch were acclimated to 5 degrees C or 16 degrees C for 3-5 weeks. The recognition and activation of respiratory burst reaction of peripheral blood phagocytes was examined at seven different measurement temperatures (5, 10, 16, 20, 24 27, and 30 degrees C) when the cells were stimulated with Z and serum opsonized zymosan (OZ). Respiratory burst was measured as luminol chemiluminescence (CL) from diluted whole blood. OZ-induced CL per volume of blood was on average approximately 4.6 times higher in 16 degrees C acclimated fish than 5 degrees C acclimated perch (P < 0.0001). Z-induced CL was approximately 3 times higher at lower temperatures in 16 degrees C acclimated perch than 5 degrees C acclimated fish and 6-9 times higher at 27 degrees C and 30 degrees C (P < 0.001), respectively. CL reaction kinetics were faster in perch acclimated to 5 degrees C than 16 degrees C -acclimated fish, especially at low temperatures (P < 0.001). Thermal acclimation caused a 3-4 degrees C shift in temperature response curves of CL towards the acclimation temperature (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.053 in Z and OZ-induced CL, respectively). Serum opsonins activated perch phagocytes substantially better at higher temperatures in both acclimation groups, which is consistent with an earlier study in rainbow trout (O. mykiss). However, opsonin recognition was significantly better in 16 degrees C acclimated perch than 5 degrees C acclimated fish, which was seen as higher CLs for OZ compared to Z, especially at higher temperatures. This is opposite to previously reported results in rainbow trout. Differences between rainbow trout and perch in opsonin recognition by blood phagocytes suggest that the living habits of perch, which prefers approximately a 10 degrees C higher temperature than rainbow trout, may be reflected in immune cell functions. Results of the present examination suggest that also in fish phagocytes pattern recognition is the prevailing system at low temperatures, and specific recognition is more effective at high temperatures.

Effect of thermal manipulation during embryogenesis on liver heat shock protein expression in chronic heat stressed colored broiler chickens,"Vinoth, A. and Thirunalasundari, T. and Tharian, Jenny Anne and Shanmugam, M. and Rajkumar, U.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2015.10.010,"Thermal manipulation during embryogenesis has been shown to improve thermo tolerance in broilers. Heat shock proteins are a family of proteins produced in response to variety of stress and protect cells from damage. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of thermal manipulation (TM) during embryogenesis on HSP gene and protein expression in the embryos and in chronic heat stressed 42nd day old chicks. On 15th day of incubation, fertile eggs from two breeds-Naked neck (NN) and Punjab Broiler-2 (PB-2) were randomly divided in to two groups, namely Control (C) eggs were incubated under standard incubation conditions and Thermal Conditioning (TC) eggs were exposed to higher incubation temperature (40.5 degrees C) for 3 h on 15th, 16th and 17th day of incubation. The chicks so obtained from each group were further subdivided and reared from 15th-42nd day as normal (N; 25 +/- 1 degrees C, 70\% RH) and heat exposed (HE; 35 +/- 1 degrees C, 50\% RH) resulting in four treatment groups (CN, CHE, TCN and TCHE). Embryos of two groups (C and TC) on 17th day and birds from four treatment groups on 42nd day were sacrificed. Liver was collected for analysis of gene expression by real-time PCR and protein expression by Western blot of Heat Shock Proteins (HSP 90 alpha, HSP 90 beta, HSP 70, HSP 60, HSP 27 and ubiquitin). The plasma collected on 42nd day was analyzed for biochemical parameters. Thermal challenging of embryos of both the breeds caused significant (P <= 0.05) increase in all the HSPs gene and protein expression. The TCHE chicks had significantly (P <= 0.05) lower HSPs gene and protein expressions and oxidative stress compared to CHE groups in both NN and PB-2. Based on these findings it can be concluded that TM during incubation provides adaptation to broiler chicks during chronic heat stress. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2015,53,NA,162-171
Impact of fluctuating temperatures on development of the koinobiont endoparasitoid <i>Venturia canescens</i>,"Spanoudis, Christos G. and Pappas, Christos S. and Delpisi, Argyroula G. and Andreadis, Stefanos S. and Savopoulou-Soultani, Matilda",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2015.03.009,"The effect of temperature on the biology of Venturia canescens (Gravenhorst) (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) is well understood under constant temperature conditions, but less so under more natural, fluctuating conditions. Herein we studied the influence of fluctuating temperatures on biological parameters of V. canescens. Parasitized fifth-instar larvae of Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) were reared individually in incubators at six fluctuating temperature regimes (15-19.5 degrees C with a mean of 17.6 degrees C, 17.5-22.5 degrees C with a mean of 19.8 degrees C, 20-30 degrees C with a mean of 22.7 degrees C, 22.5-27.5 degrees C with a mean of 25 degrees C, 25.5-32.5 degrees C with a mean of 28.3 degrees C and 28.5-33 degrees C with a mean of 30 degrees C) until emergence and death of V. canescens adults. Developmental time from parasitism to adult eclosion, adult longevity and survival were recorded at each fluctuating temperature regime. In principle, developmental time decreased with an increase of the mean temperature of the fluctuating temperature regime. Upper and lower threshold temperatures for total development were estimated at 34.9 and 6.7 degrees C, respectively. Optimum temperature for development and thermal constant were 28.6 degrees C and 526.3 degree days, respectively. Adult longevity was also affected by fluctuating temperature, as it was significantly reduced at the highest mean temperature (7.0 days at 30 degrees C) compared to the lowest one (29.4 days at 17.6 degrees C). Survival was low at all tested fluctuating temperatures, apart from mean fluctuating temperature of 25 degrees C (37\%). Understanding the thermal biology of V. canescens under more natural conditions is of critical importance in applied contexts. Thus, predictions of biological responses to fluctuating temperatures may be used in population forecasting models which potentially influence decision-making in IPM programs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To understand the physiological and ecological adaptations of Eothenomys olitor, we measured their metabolic rate, thermal conductance, body temperature (T-b) and evaporative water loss at a temperature range of 5-30 degrees C in summer. The thermal neutral zone (TNZ) of E. olitor was 20-27.5 degrees C. and the mean body temperature was 35.81 +/- 0.15 degrees C. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) was 2.81 +/- 0.11 ml O-2/g h and mean minimum thermal conductance (C-m) was 0.18 +/- 0.01 ml O-2/g h degrees C. Evaporative water loss (EWL) in E. olitor increased when the ambient temperature increased. The maximal evaporative water loss was 6.74 +/- 0.19 mg H2O/g h at 30 degrees C. These results indicated that E. olitor have relatively high BMR, low body temperature, low lower critical temperature, and normal thermal conductance. EWL plays an inportant role in temperature regulation. These characteristics are closely related to the living habitat of the species, and represent its adaptive strategy to the climate of the Yunnan-Kweichow Plateau, a low-latitude, high-altitude region where annual temperature fluctuations are small, but daily temperature fluctuations are greater.

In this study, we determined high temperature tolerance (CTmax) of a common aquacultured Indian major carp, rohu, Labeo rohita fingerlings (15.96 +/- 0.72 g BW, 11.56 +/- 0.42 cm TL) followed by acclimatization at three temperatures (30, 33, 36 degrees C). To determine the CTmax, we analyzed the major hemato-biochemical indices - hemoglobin (Hb), red blood cell (RBC), white blood cell (WBC), blood glucose levels, and erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENAs) and erythrocytic cellular abnormalities (ECAs) of peripheral erythrocytes in the fish sampled at the start and end point at each acclimated temperature. Significantly decreased CTmax of the fish was found at 36 degrees C compared to 30 degrees C and 33 degrees C. The fish in the highest (36 degrees C) temperature were found with significantly lower Hb and RBC content and significantly higher WBC and blood glucose levels than that of the fishes in the lowest (30 degrees C) temperature both at the start and end points. The highest frequencies of ENAs and ECAs were found in the highest (36 degrees C) temperature group compared to the lowest (30 degrees C) temperature group at both the points. We also evaluated growth performance of the rohu fingerlings reared in the three temperatures for 60 days. The growth parameters - final weight gain, percent weight gain and specific growth rate were the highest at 33 degrees C and the lowest at 36 degrees C. The present study revealed that the highest temperature (36 degrees C) tested here may be hazardous to rohu and the temperature should be kept below 36 degrees C in the aquaculture setting to avoid physiological damage and growth and production loss to the fish.",2020,93,NA,NA
Effects of air temperatures on antioxidant defense and immunity in Mongolian gerbils,"Xu, De-Li and Xu, Meng-Meng and Wang, De-Hua",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.06.008,"Temperature influences many physiological processes including antioxidant defense and immunity. The hypothesis that air temperatures has no effects on antioxidant defense and innate immunity in Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) was tested. Thirty-three male gerbils were randomly divided into the 4 degrees C (n = 11), 23 degrees C (n = 11) and 32 degrees C groups (n = 11), in which the treatment course lasted for 27 days. We found that air temperatures had no effects on body mass. At lower temperature, gross energy intake and the masses of most organs were higher, whereas fat free dry carcass and body fat were lower. H2O2 titres increased in liver but decreased in small intestine, and remained unchanged in heart, kidney and testis upon cold exposure. At lower temperature, malonaldehyde (MDA) content was higher in the liver, lower in kidneys and testis, and did not differ in the heart and small intestine. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in liver were higher in 4 degrees C group than 23 degrees C group, while liver catalase (CAT) activity was lower in the 4 degrees C group than in the 23 degrees C group. No significant difference was observed in the activities of SOD, CAT and T-AOC in the heart, kidney, testis and small intestine among the 4 degrees C, 23 degrees C and 32 degrees C groups. As expected, bacteria killing capacity indicating innate immunity, white blood cells and thymus mass were all not affected by air temperatures. Similarly, air temperatures had no effect on the levels of testosterone and corticosterone, both of which were not correlated with innate immunity, H2O2 and MDA levels, the activity of SOD, CAT, and T-AOC in all the detected tissues. In conclusion, air temperature affected antioxidant capacity, but not immune responses or serum concentrations of corticosterone and testosterone. Overall, up-regulation or maintenance of antioxidant defenses and immunity might be an important mechanism for gerbils to survive highly variable temperature.",2019,84,NA,111-120
Effects of developmental acclimation on fitness costs differ between two aphid species,"Cao, Jun-Yu and Xing, Kun and Liu, Hui-Ping and Zhao, Fei",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.09.004,"Most ectotherms are able to increase their tolerance to heat stress via the acclimation response. However, there is ongoing debate about whether the acclimation response is associated with fitness costs, and what factors can affect the consequences of acclimation are still unclear. To elucidate this, we sought to determine whether fitness costs varied with acclimation conditions in two cereal aphids, Sitobion avenae and Rhopalosiphum padi. Thus, the basal and inducible thermal tolerances (maximum critical temperature {[}CTmax]) and fitness traits (proportion of adult emergence, adult longevity, fecundity, and population parameters) of adult aphids were measured under three conditions of developmental acclimation: 1) 22 degrees C constant temperature (no acclimation), 2) 22 degrees C + 34 degrees C for 2 h per day (low daytime temperature), and 3) 22 degrees C + 38 degrees C for 2 h per day (high daytime temperature). We found that the thermal tolerances of both species were significantly higher following developmental acclimation, where higher basal and inducible thermal tolerances were observed in R. padi than in S. avenae. Low daytime temperature acclimation conditions (34 degrees C) resulted in negligible reproductive costs and improved the intrinsic rates of population increase in both species. In contrast, substantial fitness costs were detected in both species in response to high daytime temperature acclimation (38 degrees C), especially for S. avenae. Our results indicate that the effects of acclimation conditions on fitness costs differ between the two aphid species. These findings will not only enhance our understanding of species dynamics in the context of climate change but could also potentially improve pest control efforts.",2018,78,NA,58-64

A. davidianus was exposed to a high ambient temperature of 30 degrees C for various periods of time (0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h). We investigated the effects of heat stress on alterations of the hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, the activities of lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), the histology of the liver, and the mRNA expression patterns of 11 genes involved in the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant pathway in A. davidianus. The results showed that both the hepatic LDH activity and MDA content significantly increased after heat exposure, indicating that heat stress could induce cell injury and oxidative damage. Histological analysis of the liver showed that heat stress caused hepatocyte abnormalities, fat accumulation and ultrastructural alterations of the hepatocytes, endoplasmic reticulum and nuclei. The expression patterns of genes involved in the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant pathway in the liver were distinct when A. davidianus was exposed to heat stress. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first on the characterization of Nrf2 in A. davidianus and even in amphibians. The results indicated that heat stress could induce oxidative damage, and the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway might play a critical role in the resistance against heat stress in A. davidianus.

Lestagella penicillata (Ephemeroptera: Teloganodidae), Aphanicercella scutata (Plecoptera: Notonemouridae) and Chimarra ambulans (Trichoptera: Philopotamidae) from the winter rainfall Western Cape Province, South Africa. 2. Eggs of each species were incubated after fertilisation at six temperature treatments across the range of 5-30 degrees C. Total development time required for 50\% hatch, total hatch success, duration of the hatching period, upper and lower thermal limits for development, as well as thermal reaction norms were calculated for each species. 3. Successful egg development and hatching occurred between 10 and 20 degrees C for L. penicillata, with highest percentage hatch (90\%) at 10, 15 and 20 degrees C treatments. For A. scutata successful hatching also occurred between 10 and 20 degrees C but hatching success was reduced (30\%) at 20 degrees C compared to 80\% hatching success at 10 and 15 degrees C treatments. For degrees C. ambulans, successful development and hatching occurred over a wider range of temperatures (10-25 degrees C) but with lower (5-20\%) and more variable hatching success at all temperatures. 4. Thermal reaction norms in conjunction with egg hatch parameters showed that L. penicillata and particularly C. ambulans were warm adapted, while the A. scutata was cold adapted. These observed differences in egg development characteristics similarly relate to the different life-histories and their relation to developmental season. 5.

Thermal tolerance and preference of exploited turbinid snails near their range limit in a global warming hotspot,"Ab Lah, Roslizawati and Benkendorff, Kirsten and Bucher, Daniel",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.01.008,"Predicted global climate change has prompted numerous studies of thermal tolerances of marine species. The upper thermal tolerance is unknown for most marine species, but will determine their vulnerability to ocean warming. Gastropods in the family Turbinidae are widely harvested for human consumption. To investigate the responses of turbinid snails to future conditions we determined critical thermal maxima (CTMax) and preferred temperatures of Turbo militaris and Lunella undulata from the tropical-temperate overlap region of northern New South Wales, on the Australian east coast. CTMax were determined at two warming rates: 1 degrees C/30 min and 1 degrees C/12 h. The number of snails that lost attachment to the tank wall was recorded at ``each temperature increment. At the faster rate, T militaris had a significantly higher CTMax (34.0 degrees C) than L. undulata (32.2 degrees C). At the slower rate the mean of both species was lower and there was no significant difference between them (29.4 degrees C for T. militaris and 29.6 degrees C for L. undulata). This is consistent with differences in thermal inertia possibly allowing animals to tolerate short periods at higher temperatures than is possible during longer exposure times, but other mechanisms are not discounted. The thermoregulatory behaviour of the turban snails was determined in a horizontal thermal gradient. Both species actively sought out particular temperatures along the gradient, suggesting that behavioural responses may be important in ameliorating short-term temperature changes. The preferred temperatures of both species were higher at night (24.0 degrees C and 26.0 degrees C) than during the day (22.0 degrees C and 23.9 degrees C). As the snails approached their preferred temperature, net hourly displacement decreased. Preferred temperatures were within the average seasonal seawater temperature range in this region. However, with future predicted water temperature trends, the species could experience increased periods of thermal stress, possibly exceeding CTMax and potentially leading to range contractions.",2017,64,NA,100-108

Considering the broad range of habitats where they live, it is important to understand the thermal physiological mechanisms, thermal tolerances and physiological adaptations for surviving in rigorous environments. We investigated the thermal parameters (field body temperature, selected body temperature, locomotor performance in field and laboratory conditions, and thermal extremes) during diurnal activity for a population of juvenile, post-meta-morphosed toads (Rhinella spinulosa) from the Monte Desert of San Juan, Argentina. Post-metamorphic toads are active from approximately 1100-1900 (in contrast to nocturnal adult toads). Our findings show that these toads have a wide thermal tolerance range, ranging from a critical thermal maximum of 36.9 degrees C to crystallization temperatures below 0 degrees C. During their active period, toads always showed suboptimal thermal conditions for locomotion. Despite the suboptimal condition for the locomotion, diurnal activity is likely to confer thermal advantages, allowing them to search for food and increase digestion and growth rates. We also found that the toads are capable of super-cooling, which prevents mortality from freezing when the environmental temperatures drop below 0 degrees C. The environmental temperatures are below zero at night, when toads are inactive and take refuge under rocks. In summary, this toad population demonstrates high thermal plasticity, as shown by a relatively high level of activity sustained over a wide range of ambient temperature (similar to 35 degrees C). These thermal adaptations allow this species of juvenile toads to inhabit a wide range of altitudes and latitudes. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",2015,52,NA,52-57
"Molecular characterization of eight ATP-dependent heat shock protein transcripts and their expression profiles in response to stresses in the spruce budworm, <i>Choristoneura fumiferana</i> (L.)","Quan, Guoxing and Duan, Jun and Fick, William and Candau, Jean-Noel",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102493,"Heat shock proteins (HSPs) greatly contribute to insect stress tolerance and enhance survival and adaptation in severe environmental conditions. To investigate the potential roles of HSPs in the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana (L.), an important native pest of forests in North America, we found eight ATP-dependent HSP transcripts (CfHSPs). Based on molecular characteristics, the identified HSP genes were classified into HSP70 and HSP90 families, and phylogenetic results showed that they had orthologues in other insects. The transcript levels of these HSPs were measured using RT-qPCR under normal and stressful conditions in the laboratory. Under normal conditions, three HSP genes were consistently expressed in all life stages, whereas expression of the other five genes was dependent on the developmental stage. In the larvae, most CfHSP transcripts displayed similar expression levels among different tissues. Under heat shock conditions, one HSP70 gene and one HSP90 gene were upregulated in all life stages. One HSP70 gene was upregulated after cold injury in the larval stage. With starvation, HSP gene expression exhibited complex expression patterns; most of them were downregulated. These results suggest that the ATP-dependent HSPs have multiple roles during normal development as well as under stressful conditions including heat, cold injury and starvation.",2020,88,NA,NA

(1758)","Samaras, Athanasios and Papandroulakis, Nikos and Lika, Konstadia and Pavlidis, Michail",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.09.006,"The effects of water temperature (15, 20 and 25 degrees C) on the stress response of European sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax, were studied. Blood and water samples were collected prior and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 h post-stress for hormonal and biochemical analysis. Water temperature affected the resting concentrations of all stress indicators examined, as well as their response after stress, apart from lactate which response was unaffected by temperature. Cortisol showed the response with the highest outcome at 15 degrees C, and the fastest at 25 degrees C. Cortisol release rate in the water was also faster and of higher magnitude at higher temperatures. Glucose had both the fastest and higher in magnitude response at 25 degrees C, while lactate responded similarly in all temperatures tested. Finally, osmolality changed only at the highest temperature. These results suggest that temperature should be taken into consideration when evaluating the resting levels of stress indicators of European sea bass in laboratory, rearing and field conditions. Additionally, the present results show that temperature affects the stress response, suggesting that fish can differ in their susceptibility to stress depending on the acclimatization temperature. Moreover, it was shown that cortisol release rate in the water, a non-invasive stress indicator, can depict the effects of temperature on cortisol stress response.",2018,78,NA,84-91
Use of acetylsalicylic acid as an allostatic modulator in the diets of growing Japanese quails exposed to heat stress,"El-Kholy, Mohamed S. and El-Hindawy, Mohamed M. and Alagawany, Mahmoud and Abd El-Hack, Mohamed E. and El-Sayed, Sabry A. A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.02.011,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of dietary acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) supplementation on performance, carcasses and some blood metabolites of growing quails exposed to heat stress. Three hundred sixty mix sexed Japanese quail chicks at 2 wk of age with average initial body weight of 77.4 g were randomly allotted to six dietary groups in a 3 x 2 factorial design with three dietary ASA doses (0, 0.5 and 1 g ASA/kg diet) and two ambient temperatures (one normal at 23 +/- 2 degrees C and other high at 33 +/- 2 degrees C). Body weight, daily body weight gain and feed consumption reduced in quails exposed to heat stress (33 degrees C) during 2-4 wk of age, but not during 4-6 wk of age and during total period (2-6 wk of age). Growth rate and feed utilization were not influenced by ASA supplementation or interaction between ASA supplementation and house temperature at all ages (P > 0.05). All carcass parameters were not affected (P > 0.05) by temperature or dietary ASA or their interactions except dressing percent was decreased (P = 0.025) by ASA. Plasma cholesterol and total lipid were affected by the interaction effect, which were elevated in birds exposed to high ambient temperature (P = 0.004 or 0.022) and ASA supplementation (P = 0.041 or P = 0.003). Glucose concentrations were also influenced by interaction effect, which increased due to ASA supplementation at normal temperature, but were not affected at high temperature. The effect of high ambient temperature or its interaction with ASA did not affect hepatic enzymes and thyroid hormones of growing quails. Diets supplemented with ASA (1000 mg/kg) decreased plasma contents of aspartate transaminase, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxin (T4) compared with the control. It is concluded that applications of ASA in quail diets are not suitable in mitigating the disturbances induced by heat stress in the most studied parameters.",2018,74,NA,6-13
Heat shock response and shape regulation during newt tail regeneration,"Radugina, Elena and Grigoryan, Eleonora",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.11.009,"Regenerating newt tail has recently been found to react to hypergravity in a stable and reproducible way by curving downwards. Such morphogenetic effect of non-specific physical factor applied to a complex structure of an adult animal is a rare phenomenon with unknown molecular basis. For the first steps of unraveling this basis we've chosen heat shock proteins (HSPs) as promising candidates. Morphometrical analysis of tail regeneration was performed in aquarium (control), on substrate (relative hypergravity) and in aquarium under weekly application of heat shock. HSPs were inhibited pharmacologically during regeneration in aquarium and on substrate. Hsp70, 90 gene expression and protein localization were analyzed in the studied conditions. Weekly application of heat shock to newts regenerating tails in otherwise normal conditions led to development of curved tails (both upwards and downwards), suggesting that similar mechanisms are at play in both hyper gravity-altered and heat shock-altered morphogenesis. Heat shock protein inhibitor KNK437 didn't affect tail shape during normal regeneration, but prevented the formation of tail curve in appropriate conditions. It was shown that HSP70 and HSP90 proteins are present in muscle and connective tissue of intact tails as well as regenerates, but only appear in epidermis in hypergravity-altered regenerates and heated tails. Based on our data, we hypothesize, that different external factors (e.g. hypergravity and heat shock) are received, analyzed and transmitted further to affect morphogenesis by similar mechanisms that utilize a set of HSP in epidermal cells.",2018,71,NA,171-179

At each temperature, three tanks were modified to generate exercise activity in the specimens and force the fish to swim under a current speed of 27.5 cm s(-1). At the end of the experiment, the following metrics were evaluated: fish performance, morphometry (length, width, height and perimeter in different body positions), and the diameter and density of muscle and subcutaneous ventral adipose tissues. At 28 degrees C, pacus were both heavier and had greater weight gain after 240 days of cultivation. Additionally, exercise improved the feed conversion. An increase of 4 degrees C (30 degrees C) did not provide any improvement in the performance of the fish.

Supplemental ascorbic acid does not affect inferred heat loss in broiler chickens exposed to elevated temperature,"McKee, Jeffrey S. and Harrison, Paul C.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2013.01.004,"The provision of supplemental ascorbic acid has been reported to lower the body temperature of chickens maintained at elevated environmental temperatures. Since body temperature is the net effect of heat production and heat loss, it is not known if the reductions in body temperature were due to a lower heat production or an increase in heat loss. The purpose of this work was to determine if supplemental ascorbic acid facilitates heat loss in chickens exposed to an elevated temperature. On day 12 post-hatch broiler chickens were implanted intra-abdominally with a thermo-sensitive radio transmitter. The following day, birds were placed inside an indirect calorimeter maintained at 34 C for 24 h and provided water containing 0 or 400 ppm ascorbic acid. Oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, heat production, respiratory exchange ratio, and body core temperature were measured for 3 h; beginning 21 h after the birds were placed inside the calorimeter. No differences were observed in heat production or body core temperature between birds provided or not and 400 ppm ascorbic acid. This suggests that ascorbic acid has no effect on heat loss. Birds provided ascorbic acid did exhibit a significantly lower respiratory exchange ratio suggesting a greater utilization of lipid for energy production. Although lipid has a lower heat increment compared with protein and carbohydrate, the significance of this finding to birds exposed to elevated temperature is not known. In conclusion, under the conditions of this study the provision of supplemental ascorbic acid to broiler chickens maintained at an elevated temperature did not affect heat loss as inferred from measured heat production and body core temperature.

Shifts in thermal preference of introduced Asian house geckos (<i>Hemidactylus frenatus</i>) in temperate regions of southeastern Australia,"Lapwong, Yingyod and Dejtaradol, Ariya and Webb, Jonathan K.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102625,"Despite its tropical origin, the Asian house gecko (Hemidactylus frenatus) is currently invading higher latitudes around the world. In this study, we investigated whether the introduced geckos in the subtropical/temperate region of southeastern Australia have shifted their thermal biology to cope with colder temperatures. In the lab, we measured the body temperatures of geckos from Thailand and Australia in a cost-free thermal gradient. Native H. frenatus from Thailand displayed a diel pattern of thermoregulation. Geckos maintained higher body temperatures during mid-afternoon and at dusk but selected cooler temperatures during the night. Introduced geckos showed a similar pattern of thermoregulation, but selected lower body temperatures in summer (mean = 28.9 degrees C) and winter (mean = 25.5 degrees C) than native geckos (mean = 31.5 degrees C). While the Asian house geckos from Thailand did not alter their body temperatures after feeding, their conspecifics from southeastern Australia selected body temperatures that were 1.6-3.1 degrees C higher after feeding. In conclusion, our study shows that invasive house geckos in Australia have shifted their preferred body temperatures downwards relative to their native conspecifics in Thailand, presumably as a result of plasticity or natural selection. Our findings suggest that these tropical geckos have adapted to colder regions, and thus, they may spread much further than expected for a tropical ectotherm.",2020,91,NA,NA
Effects of increasing temperature on antioxidant defense system and oxidative stress parameters in the Antarctic fish Notothenia coriiceps and Notothenia rossii,"Klein, Roberta Daniele and Borges, Vinicius Dias and Rosa, Carlos Eduardo and Colares, Elton Pinto and Robaldo, Ricardo Berteaux and Martinez, Pablo Elias and Bianchini, Adalto",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.02.016,"Antioxidant defense system (ADS) and oxidative stress parameters were evaluated in the Antarctic fish Notothenia rossii and N. coriiceps exposed to increasing temperature. Acclimated fish were kept at 0 degrees C or exposed to 4 degrees C for 1 day (N. rossii) or to 2 and 4 degrees C for 1 and 6 days (N. coriiceps). Measurements were assessed in brain, gills, liver, white muscle and erythrocytes. Parameters analyzed included antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP); reduced glutathione (GSH) and metallothionein-like proteins (MTLP) concentration; superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-Stransferase (GST) and glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL) activity; lipid peroxidation (LPO) level and protein carbonyl (PC) concentration. Increased liver GST activity was observed in N. rossii exposed to 4 degrees C for 1 day. Increased muscle GPx activity was observed in N. coriiceps after exposure to 2 degrees C for 1 day. Reduced gill GPx activity and increased liver SOD activity were observed after exposure to 4 degrees C for 1 day. In N. coriiceps, increased gill GCL activity and reduced gill GPx activity, as Well as reduced liver MTLP were observed after exposure to 2 degrees C for 6 days. Reduced brain SOD activity and increased brain LPO; reduced gill ACAP, GSH concentration and GPx activity, as well as increased gill GCL activity; reduced liver ACAP, MTLP, SOD activity, GST activity and increased liver and erythrocytes LPO were observed after exposure to 4 degrees C for 6 days. These findings indicate that ADS is more responsive to short-term increasing temperature in the sluggish N. coriiceps than in the active N. rossii. However, responses of N. coriiceps to long-term increasing temperature were transient and did not prevent tissue oxidative damage. Considering the predicted increase in temperature in the Southern Ocean over the next decades, our findings suggest that Antarctic fishes are sensitive to ocean warming, displaying tissue oxidative damage associated with the thermal stress.",2017,68,A,110-118

In this study, we assessed the, mate choice, reproductive success, and offspring colouration of typical (T) and melanic (M) morphs of the ladybird Menochilus sexmaculatus paired at three temperatures 15 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 35 degrees C. Mating success of the two morphs and the consequences for offspring fitness and offspring phenotype under these temperature regimes were evaluated. Melanic adults of both sexes achieved significantly higher mating success at 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C, but at 35 degrees C no influence of adult morph on mate selection was observed. Melanic females were more fecund than typical females at all temperatures. Offspring of melanic parents developed faster than those of typicals at 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C, but not at 35 degrees C. Evidence was also found of phenotypic plasticity in colour form at 15 degrees C and 35 degrees C. At 25 degrees C the parents of pure (T) and (M) morphs produced offspring of the same morph. However, low temperature induced partial melanisation among the offspring of typical parents (T). Whereas at 35 degrees C the offspring of (T) parents became paler in colour with very fine zigzag lines on elytra, i.e. they decrease the degree of melanisation. Pure melanics (M) compensated for elevated temperature stress by producing offspring that were either pure melanic but small or large with reduced melanisation. Our results on offspring phenotype variation indicate that the degree of melanism in morphs is a result of environmentally regulated expression of the parental genotype. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Stage- and sex-specific heat tolerance in the yellow dung fly <i>Scathophaga stercoraria</i>,"Blanckenhorn, Wolf U. and Gautier, Roland and Nick, Marcel and Puniamoorthy, Nalini and Schaefer, Martin A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2014.09.007,"Thermal tolerance varies at all hierarchical levels of biological organization: among species, populations, individuals, and even within individuals. Age- or developmental stage-and sex-specific thermal effects have received relatively little attention in the literature, despite being crucial for understanding thermal adaptation in nature and responses to global warming. We document stage- and sex-specific heat tolerance in the yellow dung fly Scathophaga stercoraria (Diptera: Scathophagidae), a species common throughout the northern hemisphere that generally favours cool climates. Exposure of eggs to temperatures up to 32 degrees C did not affect larval hatching rate, but subsequent egg-to-adult survival at a benign temperature was reduced. Permanent transfer from benign (18 degrees C) to hot temperatures (up to 31 degrees C) at different larval and pupal stages strongly decreased egg-to-adult survival, though survival continuously improved the later the transfer occurred. Temporary transfer for only two days increased mortality more weakly, survival being lowest when temperature stress was imposed early during the larval or pupal stages. Adult flies provided with sugar and water tolerated 31 degrees C longer than previously thought (5 days in males to 9 days in females). Eggs were thus less susceptible to thermal stress than larvae, pupae or adults, in agreement with the hypothesis that more mobile stages require less physiological protection against heat because they can behaviourally thermoregulate. The probability of mating, of laying a clutch, and hatching success were generally independently reduced by exposure of females or males to warm temperatures (24 degrees C) during the juvenile or adult stages, with some interactions evident. High temperature stress thus affects survival differentially depending on when it occurs during the juvenile or the pre-reproductive adult life stage, and affects reproductive success via the mating behaviour of both sexes, female physiology in terms of oviposition, and fertility via sperm and/or egg quality. Our results illustrate that temperature stress, even when moderate and temporary, during early development can have profound lethal and non-lethal fitness-consequences later in life.

Male normotensive Wistar rats (NWRs) and SHRs were used at 16 weeks of age. Their arterial pressure was measured by tail plethysmography prior to the experiments to confirm the hypertensive status of the SHRs. Then, the rats underwent implantation of an abdominal temperature sensor to measure T-abd and a guide cannula in the frontal cortex to enable the insertion of a thermistor to measure T-brain. After a familiarization period, each animal was subjected to incremental speed exercises until fatigue in either a temperate (25 degrees C) or warm (32 degrees C) environment, followed by a 60-min post-exercise period at the same temperature at which they exercised. T-brain, T-abd and tail-skin temperature (T-skin) were measured every min throughout the experiments. SHRs exhibited higher T-abd values than NWRs, and these higher values were transiently and persistently observed at 25 degrees C and 32 degrees C, respectively. For example, at 32 degrees C, T-abd was 0.84 degrees C higher in SHRs at the 25th min (large effect size). In contrast, regardless of the ambient temperature, SHRs exhibited similar T-brain, values as NWRs, indicating preserved T-brain regulation following exercise in hypertensive rats. SHRs presented higher T-skin during the last half of the post-exercise period at 25 degrees C, whereas no inter-group differences were observed at 32 degrees C. In conclusion, the present results highlight that SHRs, an animal model that mimics uncontrolled essential hypertension in humans, exhibited greater impairments in regulating T-abd than T-brain during the post-exercise period.",2019,83,NA,30-36

In particular, we evaluated the effect of thermal acclimation on basal metabolic rate (BMR), thermal conductance (C) and torpor patterns, as well as the presence of non-shivering thermogenesis (NST) as a rewarming mechanism in this marsupial. Non-significant effects of thermal acclimation were observed in BMR. C and body mass, but cold-acclimated individuals exhibited significantly longer torpor bouts. Also, minimum body temperature during torpor, inter-bout body temperature and arousal reviarming rate were lower in cold-acclimated animals. Furthermore, we found that D. gliroides did not display NSF in response to Norepinephrine. Hence, despite the high regulation of torpor of other species. D. gliroides shows low flexibility in the ability to adjust energy expenditure and insulation properties, and (as in other marsupials) NST do not seems to be important as thermoregulatory mechanism.

The aim of the study was to investigate the natural and artificial spawning effectiveness of bream during a 4-year study regarding the reproductive effectiveness of the wild bream population in relation to thermal fluctuation (optimal and semi-lethal) of their ecosystem during the natural spawning season. During four following seasons, the bream spawners, as well as the eggs, were collected from the spawning grounds and incubated at optimal (21 degrees C) and semi-lethal (23 degrees C) temperatures. The spawning of mature bream was artificially induced and the obtained eggs were also incubated at the same temperatures. The period of observed spawners on the spawning grounds was different in different years: the longest time of bream spawning was in the second year of the study and the shortest was during the third year of the study. In the last year, a decrease in water temperature caused a break in the spawning. Thermal changes in water temperature during the spawning season may have caused a high mortality level of bream embryos and decreased the recruitment of the next species generation.

Natural arousal from torpor occurs spontaneously with highly predictable timing. However, animals can also be induced to arouse prematurely in response to various disturbances. While many investigations have used natural and induced arousals synonymously, direct comparisons of these two types of arousal have been limited. We address the question of whether natural and prematurely induced arousals generate the same patterns of warming at the level of the whole organism. We compare the effects of ambient temperature on the dynamics of natural versus induced arousals. Arousal duration, maximum rewarming rate, and the variance associated with increases in body temperature differed between natural and induced arousals. Prematurely inducing arousal also alters the duration of the interbout aroused (IBA) period.

The shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei manages to survive these harsh environmental conditions by enhancing their antioxidant defenses, among other strategies. In this study, we report the mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase (mMnSOD) nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences and its gene expression in L. vannamei tissues. The deduced protein has 220 amino acids with a signal peptide of 20 amino acids. Expression of mMnSOD was analyzed in hepatopancreas, gills and muscle, where gills had highest expression in normoxic conditions. In addition, shrimp were subjected to high temperature, hypoxia and reoxygenation to analyze the effect on the expression of mMnSOD and SOD activity in mitochondria. High temperature and hypoxia showed a synergistic effect in the up-regulation on expression of mMnSOD in gills and hepatopancreas. Moreover, induction in SOD activity was found in the mitochondrial fraction from gills of normoxia at high temperature, probably due to an overproduction of reactive oxygen species caused by an elevated metabolic rate due to the stress temperature. These results suggest that the combined stress conditions of hypoxia and high temperature trigger molecularly the antioxidant response in L. vannamei in a higher degree than only one stressor.",2020,88,NA,NA
Short communication: Domesticated and wild fathead minnows differ in growth and thermal tolerance,"Hirakawa, Kento A. and Salinas, Santiago",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102784,"Many populations have evolved in response to laboratory environments (lack of predators, continual food availability, etc.). Another potential agent of selection in the lab is exposure to constant thermal environments. Here, we examined changes in growth, critical thermal maximum (CTmax), and food consumption under constant (25 degrees C) and fluctuating (22-28 degrees C and 19-31 degrees C) conditions in two populations of fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas: one that has been kept in a laboratory setting for over 120 generations (similar to 40 years) and a corresponding wild one. We found that under thermal fluctuations, domesticated fathead minnows grew faster than their wild counterparts, but also exhibited lower thermal tolerance. Food consumption was significantly higher in the lab population under the constant and large fluctuation thermal treatments. Our results suggest that the lab population has adjusted to the stable conditions in the laboratory and that we should carefully apply lessons learned in the lab to wild populations.",2020,94,NA,NA
Physiological response and miRNA-mRNA interaction analysis in the head kidney of rainbow trout exposed to acute heat stress,"Zhou, Chang-Qing and Zhou, Peng and Ren, Yan-Li and Cao, Li-Hui and Wang, Jian-Lin",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.05.014,"The rainbow trout is a cold-water fish cultured in China. Heat stress has a serious impact on the summer survival and the yield of rainbow trout. A better understanding of the regulatory response of rainbow trout to heat stress will help in determining the relationship between heat stress signaling pathways and adaption mechanisms and help contribute to breeding new high-temperature tolerant strains of rainbow trout. In this study, the 48-h median lethal temperature (48h-LT50) of rainbow trout was determined as 22.5 degrees C. We developed control (16 degrees C) and heat-treated (22.5 degrees C) groups and extracted RNA from the head kidney tissues for high-throughput sequencing to study the microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles. Twelve up-regulated and five down-regulated miRNAs were identified between the control and heat-treated groups. A total of 22 target genes were predicted for 6 of the differentially expressed miRNAs, including 31 negative miRNA-mRNA interactions. Important regulatory pathways under heat stress are related to the metabolism and immune responses of the rainbow trout. Our findings provide preliminary data for investigating the high-temperature molecular mechanism of the rainbow trout and can help producers to reduce the economic losses caused by high temperature weather.",2019,83,NA,134-141
Preventive effects of supplemental dietary zinc on heat-induced damage in the epididymis of boars,"Li, Zhaojian and Li, Yansen and Zhou, Xin and Cao, Yun and Li, Chunmei",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.01.002,"Hyperthermia in boars reduces growth performance and sperm production. Zinc is an essential trace element in animal nutrition. Here we investigate the effects of dietary zinc on epididymal structure and function in Bama miniature pigs treated with heat exposure and investigate approaches to improve the reproductive performance in summer. Male Bama miniature pigs (n=18; aged 6 months; bodyweight=10.79 +/- 0.06 kg) were randomly allocated to 3 groups: control group (Control), heat treatment group (HT), and the diet-supplemented and heat treatment group (H+Zn). The Control and HT groups were fed with basal diet and the H+Zn group were fed with basal diet plus 1500 mg/kg zinc daily. After being fed with these 2 different diets for 30 days, pigs in the HT and H+Zn groups were exposed to 5 h of 40 C heat treatment for 8 days. Rectal temperature and jugular venous blood were collected 3 h after onset of heat exposure on days 1, 4 and 8. Pigs were sacrificed after the termination of heat exposure. Heat treatment increased serum testosterone concentration on day 1 and 4 (P < 0.01). In addition, the HT group displayed an increase in the clear cell count and a decrease in epithelium thickness in the caput epithelium (P < 0.01, P < 0.05), and dietary zinc protected the boars from these impairments (P < 0.01, P=0.29). Evaluation of oxidative states showed that heat exposure increased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) in the epididymis (P < 0.01, P < 0.05), while dietary zinc reduced this elevation (P < 0.01, P < 0.01). Heat exposure enhanced the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression in the nuclei of principal and basal cells (P < 0.01, P < 0.01) while dietary zinc attenuated the GR immunoreactivity intensity (P < 0.01, P < 0.01). These results demonstrate that dietary zinc protects the epididymis from high temperature -induced impairment, alleviates oxidative stress, restores the integrity of the caput epithelium and decreases the stress response.",2017,64,NA,58-66
Evaporative heat loss in <i>Bos taurus</i>: Do different cattle breeds cope with heat stress in the same way?,"Franco Pereira, Alfredo Manuel and Titto, Evaldo L. and Infante, Paulo and Titto, Cristiane G. and Geraldo, Ana M. and Alves, Alexandre and Leme, Thays M. and Baccari, Jr., Flavio and Almeida, Jose A.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2014.08.004,"The aim of this study was to compare two Portuguese (Alentejana and Mertolenga) and two exotic (Frisian and Limousine) cattle breeds in terms of the relationship between the increase in ambient temperature and the responses of the evaporative heat loss pathways and the effects on homeothermy. In the experiment, six heifers of the Alentejana, Frisian, and Mertolenga breeds and four heifers of the Limousine breed were used. The animals were placed in four temperature levels, the first one under thermoneutral conditions and the other ones with increase levels of thermal stress. When submitted to severe heat stress, the Frisian developed high thermal tachypnea (125 mov/min) and moderate sweating rates (117 g m(-2) h(-1)), which did not prevent an increase in the rectal temperature (from 38.4 degrees C to 40.0 degrees C). Moderate increases in rectal temperature were observed in the Alentejana (from 38.8 degrees C to 39.4 degrees C) and Limousine (from 38.6 degrees C to 39.4 degrees C), especially in the period of highest heat stress. The Limousine showed moderate levels of tachypnea (101 mov/min) while showing the lowest sweating rates. The Alentejana showed significant increases in sweating rate (156 g m(2) h(-1)) that played a major role in homeothermy. The Mertolenga showed a superior stability of body temperature, even in the period of highest heat stress (from 38.5 degrees C to 39.1 degrees C). Uncommonly, the maintenance of homeothermy during moderate heat stress was achieved primarily by intense tachypnea (122 mov/min). The sweating rate remained abnormally low under conditions of moderate heat stress, rising significantly (110 g m(-2) h(-1)) without evidence of stabilization, only when tendency for heat storage occurred. This unusual response of the evaporative heat loss pathways infers a different thermoregulatory strategy, suggesting a different adaptation to semi-arid environment and strong association with water metabolism.

The emergence emergency: A mudskipper's response to temperatures,"Nay, Tiffany J. and Gervais, Connor R. and Hoey, Andrew S. and Johansen, Jacob L. and Steffensen, John F. and Rummer, Jodie L.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.09.005,"Temperature has a profound effect on all life and a particularly influential effect on ectotherms, such as fishes. Amphibious fishes have a variety of strategies, both physiological and/or behavioural, to cope with a broad range of thermal conditions. This study examined the relationship between prolonged (5 weeks) exposure to a range of temperatures (22, 25, 28, or 32 degrees C) on oxygen uptake rate and movement behaviours (i.e., thermoregulation and emergence) in a common amphibious fish, the barred mudskipper (Periophthalmus argentilneatuis). At the highest temperature examined (32 degrees C, approximately 5 degrees C above their summer average temperatures), barred mudskippers exhibited 33.7-97.7\% greater oxygen uptake rates at rest ((M) over dotO(2Rest)), emerged at a higher temperature (CTe; i.e., a modified critical thermal maxima (CTMax) methodology) of 41.3 +/- 0.3 degrees C relative to those maintained at 28, 25, or 22 degrees C. The 32 degrees C-maintained fish also ceased movement activity at the highest holding temperature suggesting that prolonged submergence at elevated temperatures is physiologically and energetically stressful to the individual. Using exhaustive exercise protocols with and without air exposure to simulate a predatory chase, the time to recovery was examined for all individuals. When submerged, mudskippers required 2.5x longer recovery time to return to resting oxygen uptake from exhaustive exercise than those fully emerged in air. Oxygen uptake data revealed that air exposure did not accrue oxygen debt, thereby allowing faster return to resting oxygen consumption rates. If the option to emerge was not available, mudskippers preferentially sought more benign water temperatures (26.7 +/- 2.1 degrees C), resembling those experienced by these fish during the Austral autumn, regardless of prolonged exposure higher or lower temperatures. These results add to our understanding of the strategies that amphibious fishes may use to mitigate extra costs associated with living in warm waters, and could be the key to understanding how such species will cope with increasing temperatures in the future.",2018,78,NA,65-72
Comparative thermoregulation between different species of dung beetles (Coleoptera: Geotrupinae),"Gallego, Belen and Verdu, Jose R. and Lobo, Jorge M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.03.009,"Insects can use thermoregulation to keep their body temperatures within a certain range in response to thermal stress situations. The mechanisms to regulate internal temperature depend on whether species are endothermic or ectothermic species, i.e., if the heat source is internal and/or external. In this study, the thermal stress response due to excess heat was examined in individuals belonging to different species of the Geotrupinae subfamily by using a standardized protocol based on infrared thermography. All the measured heat stress variables allow discrimination among the considered species to a greater or lesser extent. The body heating rate in the heat stress range, the critical thermal maximum and the stress start temperature were the most important variables in discriminating between apterous and winged individuals (R-2 = 52.5\%, 51.1\% and 50.0\%, respectively). Examining the degree of association between the physiological similarity of individuals and some species traits suggest that flying capability and daily activity are related with different thermal responses. Based on the obtained results, the Geotrupinae subfamily can be divided into three ecophysiological groups: good, medium and non-thermoregulators. Within these groups, apterism appears mainly in those species with the ability to actively decrease their body temperature. Our results indicate that this ability may be partially due to the management of water loss related with evaporative cooling.",2018,74,NA,84-91
The effect of acclimation on heat tolerance of <i>Lasioderma serricorne</i> (Fabricius) (Coleoptera: Anobiidae),"Li, Meng and Li, Xiao-Juan and Lu, Jian-Hua and Huo, Ming-Fei",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.11.007,"Lasioderma serricorne (Fabricius) (Coleoptera: Anobiidae) is an important economic insect of various stored products worldwide. With the restricted use of methyl bromide and the increasing negative effects of repeated use of phosphine fumigation, heat treatment becomes the main approach to control stored-product insects. We investigated effect of the acclimation to sublethal high temperature of 36 degrees C and 42 degrees C for different times on heat tolerance of L. serricorne adults, pupae, larvae, and eggs to lethal high temperature of 50 degrees C in laboratory. The acclimation of L. serricorne pupae, larvae, and eggs, but not adults, to 36 degrees C improved their survival when exposed to lethal high temperature of 50 degrees C. The acclimation of all life stages of L. serricorne to 42 degrees C significantly improved their survival when exposed to 50 degrees C. For eggs, larvae, and adults, the protective effectiveness of acclimation to 42 degrees C was much more profound than that of to 36 degrees C. LT50 and LT90 of all life stages increased with increasing acclimation time to 42 degrees C in general. The LT50 of L serricorne adults, pupae, larvae, and eggs acclimation to 42 degrees C for 20 h were 2.2, 2.2, 3.4, and 4.8 times higher than that of insects without acclimation, respectively. The results suggest that acclimation to sublethal high temperatures can significantly improve the heat tolerance of L. serricorne by the means of increasing their survival when confronting lethal high temperatures. In the face of global warming, the protective effects induced by acclimation to sublethal high temperatures should be fully considered when design or apply heat treatment to control L. serricorne.",2018,71,NA,153-157

A total of 144 male Arbor Acres broilers aged 21 days were randomly divided into 3 groups with 6 replicates per group and 8 broilers in each replicate. The 3 treatment groups were as follows: the control group, in which broiler chickens were raised at 22 +/- 1 degrees C and fed basal diets, the heat stress (HS) and HS-EA groups, in which broiler chickens were raised at 34 +/- 1 degrees C for 8 h (0900-1700 h) and 22 +/- 1 degrees C for 16 h, and fed basal diets supplemented with 0 or 1 g/kg EA, respectively. From 22 to 41 days, the heat treatment lasted for 20 consecutive days. Compared with the control group, HS increased the activity of plasma diamine oxidase (P < 0.05) and the concentration of intestinal interleuldn-1 beta, and up-regulated (P < 0.05) the mRNA expression of intestinal interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, interferon-gamma, toll-like receptor 4 and heat shock protein 70, down-regulated (P < 0.05) jejunal zonula occludens-1 and ileal occluding mRNA abundances and intestinal interleukin-10 at both protein and transcriptional levels. However, EA treatment significantly decreased (P < 0.05) plasma diamine oxidase activity, the mRNA expression of heat shock protein 70, toll-like receptor 4, interleukin-6, interleukin-1 beta and interferon-gamma in intestine of heat-stressed broilers, whereas upregulated (P < 0.05) the mRNA expression of ileal occluding, jejunal zonula occludens-1 and occluding. In addition, both protein and transcriptional levels of interleukin-10 in jejunum and ileum were increased (P < 0.05) by EA treatment in the HS group.

Development of the embryonic heat shock response and the impact of repeated thermal stress in early stage lake whitefish (<i>Coregonus</i> <i>clupeaformis</i>) embryos,"Whitehouse, Lindy M. and McDougall, Chance S. and Stefanovic, Daniel I. and Boreham, Douglas R. and Somers, Christopher M. and Wilson, Joanna Y. and Manzon, Richard G.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.08.013,"Lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) embryos were exposed to thermal stress (TS) at different developmental stages to determine when the heat shock response (HSR) can be initiated and if it is altered by exposure to repeated TS. First, embryos were subject to one of three different TS temperatures (6, 9, or 12 degrees C above control) at 4 points in development (21, 38, 60 and 70 days post-fertilisation (dpf)) for 2 h followed by a 2 h recovery to understand the ontogeny of the HSR. A second experiment explored the effects of repeated TS on the HSR in embryos from 15 to 75 dpf. Embryos were subjected to one of two TS regimes; +6 degrees C TS for 1 h every 6 days or +9 degrees C TS for 1 h every 6 days. Following a 2 h recovery, a subset of embryos was sampled. Our results show that embryos could initiate a HSR via upregulation of heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) mRNA at all developmental ages studied, but that this response varied with age and was only observed with a TS of +9 or + 12 degrees C. In comparison, when embryos received multiple TS treatments, hsp70 was not induced in response to the 1 h TS and 2 h recovery, and a downregulation was observed at 39 dpf. Downregulation of hsp47 and hsp90a mRNA was also observed in early age embryos. Collectively, these data suggest that embryos are capable of initiating a HSR at early age and throughout embryogenesis, but that repeated TS can alter the HSR, and may result in either reduced responsiveness or a downregulation of inducible hsps. Our findings warrant further investigation into both the short- and long-term effects of repeated TS on lake whitefish development.",2017,69,NA,294-301
"The effect of temperature on growth performance and aerobic metabolic scope in Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus (L.)","Beuvard, Christian and Imsland, Albert K. D. and Thorarensen, Helgi",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103117,"In recent years, Arctic char populations in Iceland have declined and the objective of this experiment was to throw further light on these changes by examining the effect of temperature (5, 9, 13, 17, and 21 degrees C) on the survival, growth rate, metabolism, and physiological indices of juvenile Arctic charr (initial mean body mass 4.02 +/- 0.8 g). Mortality was 60\% at 21 degrees C while at lower temperatures it was below 5\%. However, Arctic charr populations in Iceland are declining in locations where the ambient temperature is lower, suggesting that other factors may be more important in determining the abundance of the species. The optimum temperature for growth was near 14 degrees C. The growth rate was progressively reduced at supra-optimum temperatures with almost no growth at 21 degrees C. Indicators of energy reserves: condition factor, relative intestinal mass, and hepatosomatic index are all consistent with reduced feed intake at supra-optimum temperatures. The standard and maximum metabolic rate (SMR; MMR), as well as the aerobic scope for activity (AS), were maximum at 13 degrees C. The routine metabolic rate (RMR) increased exponentially with temperature and, at T21, it was equal to the MMR suggesting, that the RMR was limited by the MMR. Moreover, increased heart- and gill mass at 21 degrees C are consistent with increased stress on the cardiovascular system. These findings are in keeping with the OCLTT hypothesis that the thermal tolerance of fish is limited by the capacity of the cardiovascular system to deliver oxygen and support metabolism. Taken together, the results of this experiment suggest, that growth rate is reduced at supra-optimum temperatures because of reduced energy intake, increased metabolic demand, and limitations in the capacity of the cardiovascular system to support metabolic rate at high temperatures. At lower temperatures, growth does not appear to be limited by the AS.",2022,104,NA,NA

Data were collected from sixteen beef calves (BW: 136.9 +/- 6.23 kg; age: 169.6 +/- 4.60 d) kept at four stress levels of designated temperature humidity index (THI): threshold (22-24 degrees C, 60\%; THI = 70 to 73), mild (26-28 degrees C, 60\%; THI = 74 to 76), moderate (29-31 degrees C, 80\%; THI = 81 to 83), and severe (32-34 degrees C, 80\%; THI = 89 to 91) stress levels in climatic controlled chambers. Feed and water intake were recorded daily, and body weight was measured once a week. Blood was sampled every three days to analyse metabolite parameters. Dry matter intake (DMI) (p = 0.069, tendency) and blood glucose levels (p = 0.028) were decreased after sudden exposure to HS conditions (severe THI levels). Also, blood cortisol (p = 0.002), glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) (p = 0.009), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (p = 0.004) and standing time (p = 0.009) were increased in moderate and severe THI levels compared with threshold after exposure to HS conditions.

In conclusion, DMI, blood cortisol, GOT, glucose, BUN, and standing time were closely associated with long-term HS condition in beef calves. In addition, calves exposed to HS modulated their physiological responses that resulted in the regulation of the pertinent blood metabolites in the blood to maintain homeostasis during the long-term HS.",2021,100,NA,NA
Variation of thermal plasticity in growth and reproduction patterns: Importance of ancestral and developmental temperatures,"Loisel, Ayala and Isla, Alejandro and Daufresne, Martin",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.029,"Temperature is an important ecological driver modulating life history traits of organisms, such as growth and reproduction. With the ongoing global warming, understanding the mechanisms underlying the effect of temperature on size and resource allocation trade-off is crucial. The temperature-size rule (TSR) describes plastic growth patterns in populations of ectothermic species under different thermal environments, whereby warming results in faster initial growth but lower size at maturity. However, the evolution of the TSR remains poorly understood. Here we conducted an experiment with populations of the medaka fish Oryzias latipes maintained at two temperatures for successive generations to investigate changes in the growth pattern of the TSR. After rearing six generations at cold (20 degrees C) and warm (30 degrees C) temperature, we conducted common garden experiments on the seventh generation where we compare growth trajectories and reproduction patterns in four different groups of fish: (i) fish reared at cold temperature over all seven generations (cold past and present), (ii) fish reared at warm temperature over six generations and at cold temperature at the seventh generation (warm past and cold present), (iii) fish reared at warm temperature over all seven generations (warm past and present) and (iv) fish reared at cold temperature over six generations and at warm temperature at the seventh generation (cold past and warm present). For each treatment, we monitored growth curves and reproduction, and investigated changes in model parameters and reproduction up to 350 days after hatching. Our study showed changes in TSR patterns according to ancestral and developmental temperatures. Developmental temperature mainly impacted age at maturity and asymptotic size, whereas size at maturity was driven more by the dissimilarity between developmental and ancestral temperatures. Our results also highlight a loss of plasticity in temperature-size and reproductive patterns for the fish that were reared under warm condition over six generations.",2019,84,NA,460-468
The effect of heat stress on intestinal integrity and <i>Salmonella</i> invasion in broiler birds,"Alhenaky, Alhanof and Abdelqader, Anas and Abuajamieh, Mohannad and Al-Fataftah, Abdur-Rahman",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.10.015,"The intestinal mucosa works as a barrier to protect the internal environment of the animal from bacteria and bacterial toxins found in the gut lumen. Heat stress may harm this function. Therefore, we designed the current experiment to investigate the effect of heat stress on intestinal integrity, physiological and immunological responses and Salmonella invasion in broiler chickens. At 26 days of age, 72 birds were randomly distributed into 3 treatments, with 8 replicates per treatment and 3 birds per replicate. The three treatments were control treatment; kept at thermoneutral environmental conditions (20 +/- 2 degrees C), chronic heat stress treatment (exposed to 30 +/- 2 degrees C; 24 h/day) and acute heat stress treatment (exposed to 35 +/- 2 degrees C from 09:00 to 13:00 and kept at 20 +/- 1 degrees C from 13:00 to 09:00). The heat stress exposure was conducted for 10 successive days. Compared with the control treatment, birds subject to chronic and acute heat stress had reduced (P < 0.05) body weight and body gain and increased (P < 0.05) feed conversion ratio. However, feed intake and mortality rate were only increased (P < 0.05) in the acute heat stress treatment. Rectal temperature and Delta rectal temperature (degrees C/h) increased (P < 0.05) sharply during the first 2 days of exposure followed by gradual decreases until a plateau was achieved. Heat-stressed birds had increased (P < 0.05) serum concentrations of corticosterone, endotoxin lipopolysaccharide and the systemic inflammatory cytokine: TNF-alpha and IL-2, as well as a higher (P < 0.05) prevalence of Salmonella spp. in meat and livers, as compared with control treatment. It can be concluded that heat stress impaired intestinal integrity which resulted in increased intestinal permeability to endotoxin, translocation of intestinal pathogens (Salmonella spp.) and serum inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, avoiding thermal dysfunction of intestinal barrier is a significant factor in maintaining welfare, immune status and meat safety of broiler birds.",2017,70,B,9-14

Thermal tolerance, performance, and preference in juvenile mangrove whiprays, Urogymnus granulatus","Higgins, Emily and Bouyoucos, Ian A. and Downie, Adam T. and Illing, Bjorn and Martins, Ana P.

Such environments can be thermally dynamic and extreme; yet, the physiological and behavioural mechanisms sharks and rays use to exploit such habitats are understudied. This study aimed to define the thermal niche of juvenile mangrove whiprays, Urogymnus granulatus. First, temperature tolerance limits were determined via the critical thermal maximum (CTMax) and minimum (CTMin) of mangrove whiprays at summer acclimation temperatures (28 degrees C), which were 17.5 degrees C and 39.9 degrees C, respectively. Then, maximum and routine oxygen uptake rates ((M)over dotO(2max) and (M)over dotO(2routine), respectively), post-exercise oxygen debt, and recovery were estimated at current (28 degrees C) and heatwave (32 degrees C) temperatures, revealing moderate temperature sensitivities (i.e., Q10) of 2.4 ((M)over dotO(2max)) and 1.6 ((M)over dotO(2routine)), but opposing effects on post-exercise oxygen uptake. Finally, body temperatures (Tb) of mangrove whiprays were recorded using external temperature loggers, and environmental temperatures (Te) were recorded using stationary temperature loggers moored in three habitat zones (mangrove, reef flat, and reef crest). As expected, environmental temperatures varied between sites depending on depth. Individual mangrove whiprays presented significantly lower Tb relative to Te during the hottest times of the day. Electivity analysis showed tagged individuals selected temperatures from 24.0 to 37.0 degrees C in habitats that ranged from 21.1 to 43.5 degrees C. These data demonstrate that mangrove whiprays employ thermotaxic behaviours and a thermally insensitive aerobic metabolism to thrive in thermally dynamic and extreme habitats. Tropical nursery areas may, therefore, offer important thermal refugia for young rays. However, these tropical nursery areas could become threatened by mangrove and coral habitat loss, and climate change.",2024,124,NA,NA
The lack of plasticity and interspecific variability in thermal limits produce a highly heat-tolerant tropical host-parasitoid system,"Bussy, Mathieu and Destierdt, Wendy and Masnou, Pauline and Lazzari, Claudio and Goubault, Marlene and Pincebourde, Sylvain",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103930,"Thermal limits are often used as proxies to assess the vulnerability of ectotherms to environmental change. While meta-analyses point out a relatively low plasticity of heat limits and a large interspecific variability, only few studies have compared the heat tolerance of interacting species. The present study focuses on the thermal limits, and their plasticity (heat hardening), of three species co-occurring in Western Africa: two ectoparasitoid species, Dinarmus basalis (Rondani) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) and Eupelmus vuilleti (Crawford) (Hymenoptera: Eupelmidae), and their common host, Callosobruchus maculatus (F.) (Coleoptera: Bruchidae). The investigation delves into the Critical Thermal Maximum (CTmax), representing the upper tolerance limit, to understand how these species may cope with extreme thermal events. The CTmax of all three species appeared similarly high, hovering around 46.5 degrees C, exceeding the global mean CTmax observed in insects by 3.5 degrees C. Short-term exposure to moderate heat stress showed no impact on CTmax, suggesting a potential lack of heat hardening in these species. Therefore, we emphasized the similarity of heat tolerance in these interacting species, potentially stemming from both evolutionary adaptations to high temperatures during development and the stable and similar microclimate experienced by the three species over the years. While the high thermal tolerance should allow these species to endure extreme temperature events, the apparent lack of plasticity raises concerns about their ability to adapt to future climate change scenarios. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into the thermal physiology of these interacting species, providing a basis for understanding their responses to climate change and potential implications for the host-parasitoid system.",2024,123,NA,NA
Fitness under high temperatures is overestimated when daily thermal fluctuation is ignored,"Bagni, Thibaut and Siaussat, David and Maria, Annick and Fuentes, Annabelle and Couzi, Philippe and Massot, Manuel",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103806,"Experimental studies on the thermal biology of organisms have become crucial to investigate the impact of climate warming. However, most laboratory studies are carried out under constant temperatures and assume a negligible effect from daily fluctuating temperatures. We tested this assumption on multiple fitness traits of the moth Spodoptera littoralis, and a literature review on insects complements this study. Tests on S. littoralis focused on its optimal and maximal critical temperatures by comparing constant and daily fluctuating temperatures (+/- 5 degrees C) at mean temperatures of 25, 29 and 33 degrees C. The nine fitness parameters investigated were influenced by mean temperature. The overall effect was a maximal multiplication rate at 29 degrees C and a marked decrease under the fluctuating regime at 33 degrees C. Effects of fluctuating temperatures differed between mean temperatures. Developmental and larval survival rates at 33 degrees C were lower under the fluctuating thermal regime than under a constant temperature. Our literature review also illustrates that ignoring daily fluctuations based on constant temperatures commonly leads to overestimate fitness traits at high temperatures. Overlooking the experimental bias associated with constant temperatures minimizes the expected impact of climate warming on fitness traits.",2024,119,NA,NA

Prepubertal gilts (n = 6-7) were assigned to: thermoneutral (TN) vehicle control (TC; n = 6); TN ZEN (40 mu g/kg; TZ; n = 6); pair-fed (PF; n = 6) vehicle control (PC; n = 6); PF ZEN (40 mu g/kg; PZ; n = 6); HS vehicle control (HC; n = 7); and HS ZEN (40 mu g/kg; HZ; n = 7) and experienced either constant 21.0 +/- 0.10 degrees C (TN and PF) or 35.0 +/- 0.2 degrees C (12 h) and 32.2 +/- 0.1 degrees C (12 h) to induce HS for 7 d. Elevated rectal temperature (P < 0.01) and respiration rate (P < 0.01) confirmed induction of HS. Rectal tem-perature was decreased (P = 0.03) by ZEN. Heat stress decreased (P < 0.01) feed intake, body weight, and average daily gain, with absence of a ZEN effect (P > 0.22). White blood cells, hematocrit, and lymphocytes decreased (P < 0.04) with HS. Prolactin increased (P < 0.01) in PC and PZ and increased in HZ females (P < 0.01). 17 beta-estradiol reduced (P < 0.01) in HC and increased in TZ females (P = 0.03). Serum metabolites were altered by both HS and ZEN. Neither HS nor ZEN impacted ovary weight, uterus weight, teat size or vulva area in TN and PF treatments, although ZEN increased vulva area (P = 0.02) in HS females.

C.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102958,"Modelling of anthropogenic induced climate suggests more frequent and severe heatwaves in the future, which are likely to result in the mass die-off of several species of organisms. Oxidative stress induced by severe heat stress has previously been associated with a reduction in animal cognitive performance, depressed reproduction and lower life expectancy. Little is known about the non-lethal consequences of species should they survive extreme heat exposure. We investigated the oxidative stress experienced by the Namaqua rock mouse, a nocturnal rodent, using two experimental heat stress protocols, a 6 hour acute heat stress protocol without access to water and a 3-day heatwave simulation with ad libitum water. Oxidative stress was determined in the liver, kidney and brain using malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PC) as markers of oxidative damage, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) as markers of antioxidant defence. Incubator heat stress (heat and dehydration stress) was brought about by increasing the body temperatures of animals to 39-40.8 degrees C for 6 hours. Following incubator heat stress, significantly higher levels of MDA were observed in the liver. Dehydration did not explain the variation in oxidative markers and is likely a combined effect of thermal and dehydration stress. Individual body mass was significantly negatively correlated to kidney SOD and lipid peroxidation. A heatwave was simulated using a temperature cycle that would naturally occur during a heatwave in the species' local habitat, with a maximal ambient temperature of 38 degrees C. Following the simulated heatwave, SOD activity of the kidney demonstrated significantly lowered activity suggesting oxidative stress. Current heat waves in this species have the potential of causing oxidative stress. Heat and dehydration stress following exacerbated temperatures are likely to incur significant oxidative stress in multiple tissues demonstrating the importance of water availability to allow for rehydration to prevent oxidative stress.",2021,98,NA,NA
Heat-hardening effects on mating success at high temperature in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>,"Stazione, L. and Norry, F. M. and Sambucetti, P.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.02.001,"Reproduction is strongly influenced by environmental temperature in insects. At high temperature, mating success could be influenced not only by basal (non-inducible) thermotolerance but also by inducible plastic responses. Here, mating success at high temperature was tested in flies carrying contrasting genotypes of heat resistance in Drosophila melanogaster. The possible heat-hardening effect was tested. Mating success did not differ between heat-resistant and heat-sensitive genotypes when tested both at high (33 degrees C) and benign (25 degrees C) temperature, independently of the heat-hardening status. Importantly, heat-hardening pre-treatment increased in a 70\% the number of matings at 33 degrees C in a mass-mating experiment. Further, mating latency at 33 degrees C was shorter with heat hardening than without it in single-pair assays Heat-hardening had previously been showed to improve short-term thermotolerance in many organisms including Drosophila, and the present results show that heat hardening also improve mating success at elevated temperature. Previous exposures to a mild heat stress improve short-term mating success as a plastic response of ecological relevance. Such heat-hardening effects on mating success should be relevant for predicting potential evolutionary responses to any possible current scenery of global warming, as well as in sterile insect release programs for pest control in elevated temperature environments.",2019,80,NA,172-177
"Long-term hypoxia exposure alters the cardiorespiratory physiology of steelhead trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>), but does not affect their upper thermal tolerance","Motyka, Roman and Norin, Tommy and Petersen, Lene H. and Huggett, Duane B. and Gamperl, A. Kurt",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.03.007,"It has been suggested that exposure to high temperature or hypoxia may confer tolerance to the other oxygen limited stressor (i.e., `cross-tolerance'). Thus, we investigated if chronic hypoxia-acclimation (> 3 months at 40\% air saturation) improved the steelhead trout's critical thermal maximum (CTMax), or affected key physiological variables that could impact upper thermal tolerance. Neither CTMax (24.7 vs. 25.3 degrees C) itself, nor oxygen consumption ((M) over dot(O2)), haematocrit, blood haemoglobin concentration, or heart rate differed between hypoxia- and normoxia-acclimated trout when acutely warmed. However, the cardiac output (Q) over dot of hypoxia-acclimated fish plateaued earlier compared to normoxia-acclimated fish due to an inability to maintain stroke volume (S-v), and this resulted in a similar to 50\% lower maximum (Q) over dot. Despite this reduced maximum cardiac function, hypoxia-acclimated trout were able to consume more O-2 per volume of blood pumped as evidenced by the equivalent (M) over dot(O2). These results provide additional evidence that long-term hypoxia improves tissue oxygen utilization, and that this compensates for diminished cardiac pumping capacity. The limited S-v in hypoxia-acclimated trout in vivo was not associated with changes in cardiac morphology or in vitro maximum S-v, but the affinity and density of myocardial beta-adrenoreceptors were lower and higher, respectively, than in normoxia-acclimated fish. These data suggest that alterations in ventricular filling dynamics or myocardial contractility constrain cardiac function in hypoxia-acclimated fish at high temperatures. Our results do not support (1) `cross-tolerance' between high temperature and hypoxia when hypoxia is chronic, or (2) that cardiac function is always the determinant of temperature-induced changes in fish (M) over dot(O2), and thus thermal tolerance, as suggested by the oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT) theory.",2017,68,"B, SI",149-161
Experimental evidence of a Neotropical pest insect moderately tolerant to complete freezing,"Leon-Quinto, Trinidad and Anton-Ruiz, Noelia and Madrigal, Roque and Serna, Arturo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103939,"Due to climate change, many regions are experiencing progressively milder winters. Consequently, pest insects from warm regions, particularly those with some tolerance to low temperatures, could expand their geographic range into these traditionally colder regions. The palm borer moth (Paysandisia archon) is a Neotropical insect that in recent decades has reached Europe and Asia as one of the worst pests of palm trees. Little is known about its ability to tolerate moderately cold winters and, therefore, to colonize new areas. In this work, we characterized the cold tolerance of Paysandisia archon by measuring its thermal limits: median lethal-temperature, LT50, chill-coma onset temperature, CTmin, supercooling point, SCP, freezing time and freezing survival. We found that this species was able to survive short periods of complete freezing, with survival rates of 87\% after a 30-min freezing exposure, and 33\% for a 1 h-exposure. It is then a moderately freeze-tolerant species, in contrast to all other lepidopterans native to warm areas, which are freeze-intolerant. Additionally, we investigated whether this insect improved its cold tolerance after either short or long pre-exposure to sub-lethal low temperatures. To that end, we studied potential changes in the main thermo-tolerance parameters and, using X-ray Computed Tomography, also in the morphological components of pretreated animals. We found that short pre-exposures did not imply significant changes in the SCP and CTmin values. In contrast, larvae with long pretreatments improved their survival to both freezing and low temperatures, and required longer times for complete freezing than the other groups. These long-term pre-exposed larvae also presented several morphological changes, including a reduction in water content that probably explained, at least in part, their longer freezing time and higher freezing survival. Our results represent the first cold tolerance characterization of this pest insect, which could be relevant to better design strategies to combat it.",2024,123,NA,NA
The time course of acclimation of critical thermal maxima is modulated by the magnitude of temperature change and thermal daily fluctuations,"Turriago, Jorge L. and Tejedo, Miguel and Hoyos, Julio M. and Camacho, Agustin and Bernal, Manuel H.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103545,"Plasticity in the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) helps ectotherms survive in variable thermal conditions. Yet, little is known about the environmental mechanisms modulating its time course. We used the larvae of three neotropical anurans (Boana platanera, Engystomops pustulosus and Rhinella horribilis) to test whether the magni-tude of temperature changes and the existence of fluctuations in the thermal environment affected both the amount of change in CTmax and its acclimation rate (i.e., its time course). For that, we transferred tadpoles from a pre-treatment temperature (23 degrees C, constant) to two different water temperatures: mean (28 degrees C) and hot (33 degrees C), crossed with constant and daily fluctuating thermal regimes, and recorded CTmaxvalues, daily during six days. We modeled changes in CTmax as an asymptotic function of time, temperature, and the daily thermal fluctuation. The fitted function provided the asymptotic CTmax value (CTmax \& INFIN;) and CTmax acclimation rate (k). Tadpoles achieved their CTmax \& INFIN; between one and three days. Transferring tadpoles to the hot treatment generated higher CTmax \& INFIN; at earlier times, inducing faster acclimation rates in tadpoles. In contrast, thermal fluctuations equally led to higher CTmax \& INFIN; values but tadpoles required longer times to achieve CTmax \& INFIN; (i.e., slower acclimation rates). These thermal treatments interacted differently with the studied species. In general, the thermal generalist Rhinella horribilis showed the most plastic acclimation rates whereas the ephemeral-pond breeder Engystomops pustulosus, more exposed to heat peaks during larval development, showed less plastic (i.e., canalized) accli-mation rates. Further comparative studies of the time course of CTmax acclimation should help to disentangle the complex interplay between the thermal environment and species ecology, to understand how tadpoles acclimate to heat stress.",2023,114,NA,NA
Thermal stress induces a positive phenotypic and molecular feedback loop in zebrafish embryos,"Feugere, Lauric and Scott, Victoria F. and Rodriguez-Barucg, Quentin and Beltran-Alvarez, Pedro and Valero, Katharina C. Wollenberg",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103114,"Aquatic organisms must cope with both rising and rapidly changing temperatures. These thermal changes can affect numerous traits, from molecular to ecological scales. Biotic stressors are already known to induce the release of chemical cues which trigger behavioural responses in other individuals. In this study, we infer whether fluctuating temperature, as an abiotic stressor, may similarly induce stress-like responses in individuals not directly exposed to the stressor. To test this hypothesis, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed for 24 h to fluctuating thermal stress, to medium in which another embryo was thermally stressed before ({''}stress medium{''}), and to a combination of these. Growth, behaviour, expression of molecular markers, and of whole-embryo cortisol were used to characterise the thermal stress response and its propagation between embryos. Both fluctuating high temperature and stress medium significantly accelerated development, by shifting stressed embryos from segmentation to pharyngula stages, and altered embryonic activity. Importantly, we found that the expression of sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQOR), the antioxidant gene SOD1, and of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) were significantly altered by stress medium. This study illustrates the existence of positive thermal stress feedback loops in zebrafish embryos where heat stress can induce stress-like responses in conspecifics, but which might operate via different molecular pathways. If similar effects also occur under less severe heat stress regimes, this mechanism may be relevant in natural settings as well.",2021,102,NA,NA

Efficient mass rearing of the edible grasshopper is critical to ensure their sustainable supply for food and nutritional security. Hence, we investigated the effect of temperature on development, survival and reproduction of R. differens under six constant (15, 20, 25, 30, 32 and 35 degrees C) and fluctuating temperatures. Using Insect Life Cycle Modeling software we fitted, linear and non-linear models to R. differens development, mortality, longevity, and fecundity. The best-fitted functions were compiled for each life stage to yield a phenology model, which was stochastically simulated to estimate the life table parameters. We used the process-based climatic phenology models, and applied establishment risk index (ERI) and generation index (GI) in a geographic information system to map the potential distribution of R. differens under current and future climates. At optimum temperatures of 30-32 degrees C, egg incubation period was 14-15 days and the developmental time was shortest at 52.5-58 days. Lowest nymphal mortality (3.4-13\%) and the highest female fecundity was obtained at 25-30 degrees C. The optimum temperature for the reproduction ranged between 27 and 30 degrees C. Most simulated lifetable parameters were at their maximum at 28 degrees C. Predictive models showed that countries in the East, Central, West, Southern and the Horn of Africa were suitable for establishment of R. differens under current climate scenarios (2000). However, by 2050, climatically suitable areas for the establishment of R. differens were predicted to shrink in the West, Southern and the Horn of Africa than its current distribution. We predict up to three generations per year for R. differens in sub-Saharan Africa under current scenarios which can increase to 4 under future scenarios.

However, these mechanisms may be insufficient for population persistence under contemporary climate change, resulting in a greater need to understand how local populations respond to geographic variation in climate. In this study, we explored the potential for local adaptation and acclimation in thermal traits and behaviours using wild and captive populations of a small agamid lizard (the jacky lizard, Amphibolurus muricatus). We predicted that wild lizards from a high elevation site would have cooler thermal preferences compared to those at low elevation sites to match the more restricted thermal resources at higher, cooler elevations. We additionally explored whether variation in thermal traits was due to recent acclimation or fixed population differences, such as due to developmental plasticity or local adaptation. In contrast to our predictions, we found high-elevation lizards began panting at higher temperatures and had higher thermal preferences relative to lower elevation lizards. When allowed to bask freely, there was no difference in the intensity of basking or daily duration of time spent basking between lizards from different elevations. Although the high-elevation lizards appeared to show stronger acclimation to recent air temperatures compared to low-elevation lizards, this difference was not significant. Similarly, captive lizards acclimated under long and short basking regimes showed no major differences in thermal traits or basking behaviour. Our results are consistent with the presence of counter-gradient variation in thermal phenotypes of lizards, and suggest that these are driven by local adaptive responses or developmental effects rather than recent acclimation.",2019,83,NA,178-186

We monitored the different larval stages and calculated the number of larval instars reached during the development of winter and summer larvae of Palaemon serratus incubated at 12, 16 or 20 degrees C. We observed a great variability in the larval development (6-13 larval instars and 6 to 11 larval stages). A higher temperature decreases the development time and the number of larval instars. At a given temperature, the development time of winter and summer larvae was not different. Two larval stages were considered supernu-merary (zoea 4 and 6), as they were more frequent at low temperatures. At higher temperatures, some larvae started to develop pleopods as early as the third instar, larval stage which had never been described (named here zoea 3 `). This phenomenon was more common in winter larvae than in summer larvae. These results provide new insights into the expression of developmental plasticity in decapod larvae.",2022,110,NA,NA
Temperature and oxygen related ecophysiological traits of snow trout (<i>Schizothorax richardsonii</i>) are sensitive to seasonal changes in a Himalayan stream environment,"Kamalam, Biju Sam and Mahija, Jettiboina and Baral, Pratibha and Pandey, Anupam and Akhtar, Md Shahbaz and Ciji, Alexander and Rajesh, Manchi",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.04.014,"In this study, we investigated the seasonal changes in key eco-physiological traits of a wild population of snow trout, Schizothorax richardsonii from river Gola in the Indian Himalayan region over one year. Live specimens (5.8-3L4 g) were electro-fished from their natural habitat during representative months of four seasons with notable differences in water temperature, oxygen concentration and saturation. After 24-72 h of captive-acclimation, the fishes were examined for upper and lower critical thermal limits (CTmax, and CTmin), incipient lethal oxygen thresholds (ILOC and ILOS), apparent routine and maximum oxygen consumption rates (M-O2rout and M-O2max), and blood haemoglobin-haematocrit. Across the seasons, mean CTmin and CTmax values ranged from similar to 0 to 34.6 degrees C, suggesting a relatively wide acute thermal tolerance range for this predominantly cold-water fish. Changes in the habitat's thermal condition during winter to summer was reflected in the CTmin (similar to 0-2.4 degrees C) and CTmax (31.7-34.4 degrees C) estimates, while the highest thermal scope (CTmax-CTmin; 33.2 degrees C) was recorded in autumn. Concurrently, the incipient lethal hypoxia threshold observed in autumn (ILOS-2.6\% and ILOC-0.19 mgO(2)/L) was significantly lower than the other three seasons, possibly linked to warm-acclimation. The reduction in blood haemoglobin-haematocrit levels during winter could limit the oxygen carrying capacity, with possible reciprocations in thermal tolerance and aerobic metabolism. Concerning body mass corrected oxygen consumption, the apparent M-O2rout was found to increase in a temperature-dependent manner from 150.3 mgO(2)/kg/h at 12 degrees C to 315.2 mgO(2)/kg/h at 26 degrees C, with Q(10) ranging from 1.6 to 2.2.

Our results indicate a relationship between supercooling points, carbohydrate contents, enzyme activities and survival rates of the larvae under different thermal regimes. Glycogen content was greatest for control and RCH regimes whereas the greatest trehalose level was recorded for the CA regime. The supercooling points of control larvae of P. interpunctella and E. ceratoniae were - 14 and - 10 degrees C, respectively, and decreased to - 16 and - 18 degrees C under the CA regime. Thermal regimes had no significant effect on the survival of the larvae after 24 h exposure at 0 degrees C, but when larvae exposed to - 5 degrees C for 24 h, the highest and lowest survival rates were recorded in the CA and RCH regimes, respectively. Protein phosphatases 1 and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) were found to have the highest enzyme activity. The activity of AMPK varied between different thermal regimes and was greatest under the CA regime. CA considerably increased lower lethal times of the larvae compared with the control regime. RCH showed the highest impact on lower lethal temperature limits of the larvae. Our results indicated a characteristic enhancement of the survival rates of the larvae of P. interpuntella and E. ceratoniae under the CA regime.

The European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) is a temperate species that is generally farmed at 18 degrees C in seawater (SW). In the wild, its incursions in shallow habitats such as lagoons may result in hyperthermal damage despite its high thermal tolerance. Meanwhile, the milkfish (Chanos chanos), a tropical species, is generally reared at 28 degrees C, and in winter, high mortality usually occurs under hypothermal stress such as cold snaps. This study compared changes in hepatic antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, SOD; and catalase, CAT) in these two important marine euryhaline aquaculture species in Europe and Southeast Asia, respectively, under temperature challenge combined with hypo-osmotic (fresh water, FW) stress. After a four-week hyper- or hypo-thermal treatment, hepatic SOD activity was upregulated in both species reared in SW and FW, indicating enhanced oxidative stress in European sea bass and milkfish. The expression profiles of sod isoforms suggested that in milkfish, the increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) was mainly at the cytosol level, leading to increased sod1 expression. In European sea bass, however, no obvious difference was found between the expression of sod isoforms at different temperatures. A lower expression of sod2 was observed in FW compared to SW in the latter species. Moreover, no significant change was observed in the mRNA expression and activity of CAT in the livers of these two species under the different temperature treatments, with the exception of the lower CAT activity in milkfish challenged with SW at 18 degrees C.

In the present study, the effects of water temperature on the reproductive performance and offspring quality of rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus) were evaluated by cultured parent fish at different temperature (18 30 degrees C) in a 2-month trial. The results revealed that rare minnows could spawn continuously within the range from 18 degrees C to 30 degrees C, and these at 24 degrees C and 27 degrees C spawned every 3-4 days. Batch size of rare minnow increased with increasing water temperature, while egg production increased with increasing water temperature and then decreased at 30 degrees C. High water temperature (30 degrees C) had significantly adverse effects on fertilization rate and hatching rate (P < 0.05). It was found that the oocyte growth at 18 degrees C, 21 degrees C, and 30 degrees C were slower than those at 24 degrees C and 27 degrees C. Histologic analysis further showed that low temperature (18 degrees C and 21 degrees C) slowed down vitellogenesis and oocyte maturation, while high temperature (30 degrees C) had suppressive effects on oocyte maturation and ovulation. Based on present results, it was concluded that 24-27 degrees C was optimal breeding temperature for rare minnows and water temperature higher than 30 degrees C resulting from climate change would pose a threat to its wild populations.",2017,67,NA,59-66

In this study the status of pro-oxidants and antioxidants was studied in the testes of male pupae of tasar silkworm A. mylitta under thermal stress condition. Further, to find out the impact of temperature on physiological activity, oxygen consumption rate was measured. The result indicated higher level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS, as an index of lipid peroxidation) and total hydroperoxides in the male pupae exposed to high temperature (40 +/- 1 degrees C). Similarly, it was found that increased levels of antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), ascorbic acid (ASA) and low molecular thiols (L-SH) in testes are more prominent in high temperature rather than in moderate temperature (35 +/- 1 degrees C) suggesting the activation of physiological mechanism to scavenge the ROS produced during stress. Further more, the order of higher level of oxygen consumption rate was observed as high temperature (40 +/- 1 degrees C) > moderate temperature (35 +/- 1 degrees C) > control groups (28 +/- 1 degrees C). Oxygen consumption rate was positively correlated with oxidative stress and antioxidant defence indices.

For males we here tested which developmental stage is particularly sensitive to heat stress in the model species Drosophila melanogaster. As developmental stages characterize the different steps of sperm development, we could narrow down which particular processes are heat sensitive. We studied early male reproductive ability and, by following recovery dynamics after a move to benign temperatures, we investigated general mechanisms behind a subsequent gain of fertility. We found strong support to suggest that the last steps of spermatogenesis are particularly sensitive to heat stress, as processes occurring during the pupal stage were mostly interrupted, delaying both sperm production and sperm maturation. Moreover, further measurements in the testes and for proxies of sperm availability indicating the onset of adult reproductive capacity matched the expected heatinduced delay in completing spermatogenesis.

An understanding of how stressors in habitats and commercial operations affect ectotherm heat tolerance is urgently required so that management actions can be informed by thermal physiology. We hypothesised that brief exposure to mild stress would heighten tolerance to subsequent heat stress, indicative of a cross-tolerance interaction, whereas exposure to severe stress would reduce heat tolerance, reflecting a cross-susceptibility interaction. To test this hypothesis, we assessed how three acute stressors (salinity shock {[}10 or 33 ppt for 2 h]), air exposure (1 or 5 min) and crowding {[}95.6 kg m(-3) for 2 h]), commonly experienced by fish, affected the heat tolerance (measured as critical thermal maximum, CTMAX) in juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Fish were exposed to one of the three stressors and left for 24 h of recovery prior to measuring CTMAX. Heat tolerance was improved by similar to 0.6 degrees C in fish exposed to salinity shock (10 ppt) and air exposure (5 min) compared to unstressed controls, demonstrating cross-tolerance. However, the development of cross-tolerance was non-linear with stressor severity, and crowding stress had no effect on CTMAX. Together these results show that some forms of stress can heighten acute heat tolerance in ectotherms, but the development of cross-tolerance is highly specific to both stressor type and stressor severity.",2022,106,NA,NA
Thermal tolerance and standard metabolic rate of juvenile gilthead seabream (<i>Sparus aurata</i>) acclimated to four temperatures,"Kir, Mehmet",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102739,"Temperature variation affects the growth, maturation and distribution of fish species due to increasing constraints on physiological functions therefore, the aim of the present study is to evaluate effect of temperature on thermal tolerance and standard metabolic rate (SMR) of gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata). For this purpose, tolerable temperature ranges of juvenile gilthead seabream acclimated at 15, 20, 25, and 30 degrees C for 30 days were estimated using dynamic and static thermal methodologies. The SMRs of the fish were also determined based on oxygen consumption rate (OCR). The dynamic and static thermal tolerance zones of gilthead seabream were calculated as 737 degrees C-2 and 500 degrees C-2, respectively, with a resistance zone area of 155.5 degrees C-2. The SMR of the fish at the above acclimation temperatures (AT) was determined as 138, 257, 510, and 797 mg O-2 h(-1) kg(-1), respectively and were significantly different (P < 0.01, n = 10). The temperature quotient (Q(10)) in relation to the SMR of the fish was calculated as 3.45, 3.91, and 2.44 for acclimation temperature ranges of 15-20, 20-25, and 25-30 degrees C, respectively. The fact that the SMR increased with rising temperatures and then decreased gradually after 25 degrees C indicates that the temperature preference of juvenile gilthead seabream lies between 25 and 30 degrees C. This study shows that gilthead seabream tolerates a relatively narrow temperature range, and consequently, a low capacity for acclimatisation to survive in aquatic systems characterised by temperature variations.",2020,93,NA,NA
Effect of thermal stress on the immune responses of <i>Chilo</i> <i>suppressalis</i> walker (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) to <i>Beauveria bassiana</i>,"Shamakhi, Leila and Zibae, Arash and Karimi-Malati, Azadeh and Hoda, Hassan",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.006,"Temperature is one of the important environmental elements affecting ecological fitness of insects through alterations in physiological systems. In the current study, a comparison was made on the cellular and humoral immune responses of the Chilo suppressalis larvae exposed to thermal stress (34 degrees C) and optimal rearing temperature (24 degrees C). Although total hemocyte count increased in the injected larvae by Beauveria bassiana, elevation of hemocyte numbers was significantly different in the larvae exposed to 34 degrees C for a short-time period compared to long-term exposure and control. A similar trend was observed in plasmatocyte and granulocyte counts as well as phenoloxidase activity. Gene expression of some antimicrobial peptides, including attacin1, attacin2, cecropin1, cecropin2, defensin, gallerimycin, lysozyme and prophenoloxidase-activating proteinase-3, was compared in the larvae exposed to thermal regimes and injection challenges. In all cases, expression of the target genes was relatively higher in the larvae injected by B. bassiana and short-term exposure at 34 degrees C. The present results confirmed that C. suppressalis could modulate the immune system in response to different thermal stress conditions mainly over a short period.",2019,84,NA,136-145
Evaporative cooling and vasodilation mediate thermoregulation in naked mole-rats during normoxia but not hypoxia,"Vandewint, Amanda L. and Zhu-Pawlowsky, Amanda J. and Kirby, Alexia and Tattersall, Glenn J. and Pamenter, Matthew E.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.011,"Naked mole-rats are among the most hypoxia-tolerant mammals but have a poor thermoregulatory capacity due to their lack of insulating fur and fat, and small body size. In acute hypoxia, naked mole-rat body temperature (T-b) decreases to ambient temperature (T-a) but the mechanisms that underlie this thermoregulatory response are unknown. We hypothesized 1) that naked mole-rat blood vessels vasodilate during hypoxia to shunt heat toward the body surface and/or 2) that they augment heat loss through evaporative cooling. Using open-flow respirometry (indirect calorimetry) we explored metabolic and thermoregulatory strategies of naked mole-rats exposed to hypoxia (7\% O-2 for 1 h) at two relative humidities (RH; 50 or 100\% water saturation), and in two T-a's (25 and 30 degrees C), alone, and following treatment with the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II (ANGII). We found that T-b and metabolic rate decreased in hypoxia across all treatment groups but that neither RH nor ANGII effected either variable in hypoxia. Conversely, both T-b and metabolic rate were reduced in 100\% RH or by ANGII treatment in normoxia at 25 degrees C, and therefore the absolute change in both variables with the onset of hypoxia was reduced when vasodilation or evaporative cooling were prevented. We conclude that naked mole-rats employ evaporative cooling and vasodilation to thermoregulate in normoxia and in 25 degrees C but that neither mechanism is involved in thermoregulatory changes during acute hypoxia. These findings suggest that NMRs may employ passive strategies such as reducing thermogenesis to reduce T-b in hypoxia, which would support metabolic rate suppression.",2019,84,NA,228-235

Thawing restores perfusion but rapid reoxygenation can increase vulnerability to reactive oxygen species and induce oxidative damage. This study provides a first assessment of antioxidant capacity, DNA damage, and DNA repair responses comparing freeze/thaw and anoxia/reoxygenation in liver and skeletal muscle of wood frogs. Oxidation of guanine resides in DNA did not change under either stress but total anti-oxidant capacity rose in both tissues under anoxia. Relative expression of eight proteins involved in double-stranded break repair (Mre11, Rad50, phospho-p95, XLF, DNA ligase IV, XRCC4, Ku70, Rad51) were assessed in both tissues. Freezing suppressed Ku70 and Rad51 in liver and Rad51 in muscle but levels rose again after thawing. Anoxia exposure suppressed XLF, Ku70 and Rad51 proteins in muscle. However, in liver, anoxia exposure led to elevated Mre11, Ku70 and DNA ligase IV, the former two belonging to the MRN complex that binds DNA and marks sites of double stranded breaks (DSBs). Large increases in Mre11 and Ku70 expression suggested DSB damage in liver under anoxia but not during freezing, whereas muscle was resistant to DSB damage under both stresses. These data indicate that DNA damage is minimal during whole body freezing due to tissue and stress specific regulation of antioxidant capacity and DNA damage repair to preserve genomic integrity.",2022,107,NA,NA
Divergent physiological acclimation responses to warming between two co-occurring salamander species and implications for terrestrial survival,"Messerman, Arianne F. and Turrell, Micah and Leal, Manuel",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103228,"Small differences in physiological responses are known to influence demographic rates such as survival. We tested for differences in the physiological acclimation responses of two closely-related salamander species that often co-occur, Ambystoma maculatum and A. opacum. Specifically, we measured changes in critical thermal maxima (CTmax), standard metabolic rates (SMRs), and respiratory surface area water loss (RSAWL) following exposure to three temperature treatments under laboratory conditions. While the magnitude of RSAWL and CTmax acclimation responses to warming did not differ between the study species, SMR was maintained across acclimation temperatures among A. maculatum, but declined among A. opacum acclimated to warmer temperatures. Metabolic compensation may facilitate maintained A. maculatum activity levels during warm periods following the relatively cool spring breeding season. In contrast, metabolic suppression may allow A. opacum to conserve energy when exposed to surface conditions during fall breeding and nest guarding. We simulated how these different SMR responses would likely alter post-metamorphic survival in our study species using previously collected data representing six weeks under relatively warm seminatural conditions. Our simulation indicated that, following warming and under identical study conditions, metabolic compensation may allow juvenile A. maculatum to maintain survival likelihoods, whereas metabolic depression may cause juvenile A. opacum to experience increased survivorship. These findings underscore that comparable physiological responses among ecologically similar, sympatric species cannot be assumed. Further, results of this study suggest that metabolic responses may play an important role in amphibian species persistence as temperatures increase due to habitat modification and climate change.",2022,106,NA,NA
Energy metabolism response of <i>Litopenaeus vannamei</i> to combined stress of acute cold exposure and waterless duration: Implications for physiological regulation and waterless live transport,"Xu, Defeng and Wu, Jiaxin and Sun, Lijun and Qin, Xiaoming and Fan, Xiuping and Zheng, Xiaoxian",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103149,"Maintaining the homeostasis of energy metabolism is crucial for organism's stress tolerance and survival. Acute cold exposure (AC) and waterless duration (WD) represent the two predominate abiotic stressors during waterless live transport of Litopenaeus vannamei. Although previous reports have explored the physiological response of L. vannamei to combined stress AC + WD, the roles of energy metabolism response in regulation of stress tolerance remains unknown. The present study comparatively examined the variations of energy metabolismrelated indicators in hemolymph (cortisol, hemocyanin, glucose and lactate), hepatopancreas and muscle tissues (levels of lactate and glycogen, activities of hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), and ATP levels). Combined stress significantly disturbed the homeostasis of energy metabolism with the increase in levels of hemocyanin, glucose and lactate, and decrease in glycogen and ATP content (P < 0.05). In addition, the activities of HK, PFK, PK, and SDH initially elevated and then decreased with the prolongation of combined stress from 3h to 9h duration, while the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) remained gradual elevation and ATPase activity decreased in a duration time dependent manner throughout the experiment. These alterations revealed that exposure to combined stress could accelerate anaerobic metabolism at initial stage and inhibit aerobic metabolism in a duration time-dependent manner, following with the reduction of energy biosynthesis and the disturbance of energy metabolism equilibrium. On the other hand, the progressive impairment on hepatopancreas tissue was observed under combined stress. In summary, the deficiency of ATP supply and histopathological injures on hepatopancreas tissue might the underlying mechanisms inducing mortality of L. vannamei during live transport.",2022,104,NA,NA

Little is known of how this could affect the welfare of broiler chickens. Sixty-four broiler chickens were subjected to either high heat stress (HHS; 32 degrees C, 70\% RH for 3 h), moderate heat stress (MHS; 30 degrees C, 70\% RH for 6 h), or normal conditions (NC: 20 degrees C, 50\% RH for 6 h) for two consecutive days. On both days, the temperature-ID chips on all chipped birds were scanned during pre-heat stress (PrHS), end of 3 h (3HS) and 6 h (6HS) of heat stress using a pocket reader. Half of the chip birds' CBT was measured at the end of each hour of heat stress (HS: 1st -3rd hour). Surface body temperatures (SBTs) from under the wing (WT), feet (FT), cloaca (CLT) and comb (CT) were measured. Blood samples, feed intake, daily weight gain and mortality was also monitored. Data was analysed using General Linear Model and simple linear regression. At 3HS, CBT/Delta CBT and all SBTs showed this trend: HHS>MHS>NC (P<0.001). The regression equations to predict Delta CBT in HHS and MHS are Delta CBT = 0.917 + 0.663 h, P<0.05 and Delta CBT = 0.371 + 0.338 h, P<0.05 respectively. Blood pH, pCO2, iCa, HCO3 - and TCO2 showed same trend: HHS, MHS > NC (P<0.05).

However, the effect of cold acclimation on oxidative stress and antioxidant defenses is still not well understood. Here, we investigated the effects of long-term cold exposure (30 days at 4 degrees C in darkness versus 30 days at 20 degrees C in natural light) on the redox state and antioxidant defenses of the high-altitude frog, Nanorana pleskei, indigenous to the Tibetan plateau. We found that cold acclimation, under conditions mimicking winter, led to a significant increase in the ratio of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to its reduced form (GSH) in liver and skeletal muscle tissues, suggesting that cold exposure induced oxidative stress in this species. Furthermore, malondialdehyde (MDA) contents were significantly augmented in heart, liver and muscle, indicating cold-related oxidative damage in these tissues. In the brain, GST activity, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and vitamin C content showed a significant reduction after cold acclimation. In liver, an apparent decrease was also observed in the activities of SOD and GST, as well as T-AOC, whereas CAT and GPX activities showed a prominent increase in cold-acclimated groups. In kidney, there was a significant decrease in most antioxidant enzyme activities except for SOD and GST activity. In skeletal muscle, the activity of SOD, CAT, GR as well as T-AOC significantly decreased but GPX activity showed a significant increase in cold-acclimated frogs. These findings indicate that, in general, cold acclimation induces a suppression of the antioxidant defense system. Overall, our present study systematically describes the responses of antioxidant defenses to long-term cold acclimation and these findings contribute to extending the current understanding of the mechanisms of cold tolerance in high-altitude frogs.",2021,99,NA,NA

However, our knowledge on how amphibian's thermal biology responds to seasonal changes in the environment is restricted to a few species, mostly from temperate regions, in a marked contrast with the high species diversity found in the Neotropics. We investigated whether or not the seasonal variation in climatic parameters from a high-montane ombrophilous forest in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest could lead to concurrent adjustments in the thermal biology of the terrestrial toad Rhinella icterica. We measured active body temperature (T-b) in the field, and preferred body temperature (T-pref) and thermal tolerance (critical thermal minimum, CTmin, and maximum, CTmax) in the laboratory, for toads collected at two distinct seasons: warm/wet and cold/dry. We also measured operative environmental temperatures (T-e) using agar toad models coupled with dataloggers distributed in different microhabitats in the field to estimate accuracy (d(b)) and effectiveness (E) of thermoregulation of the toads for both seasons. Toads had higher T-pref in the warm/wet season compared to the cold/dry season, even though no seasonal change occurred in field T-b's. In the warm/wet season, toads decreased the accuracy of thermoregulation and avoided thermally favorable microhabitats, while in the cold/dry season they increased the accuracy of thermoregulation and exhibited high degree of thermo-conformity. This result may encompass thermoregulatory adjustments to seasonal changes in T-c's, but may also reflect seasonal differences in compromises between T-b regulation and other ecologically relevant activities (reproduction, foraging). Toads did not exhibit changes in CTmin or CTmax, which indicates a low risk of exposure to extreme temperatures in this particular habitat, at both seasons, possibly combined with a low flexibility of this trait. Overall, our study shows seasonal acclimatization in some aspects of the thermal biology of the toad, R. icterica.",2018,74,NA,77-83
The thermal environment of the nest affects body and cell size in the solitary red mason bee (<i>Osmia bicornis</i> L.),"Kierat, Justyna and Szentgyorgyi, Hajnalka and Czarnoleski, Marcin and Woyciechowski, Michal",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.11.008,"Many ectotherms grow larger at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures. This pattern, known as the temperature-size rule, is often accompanied by plastic changes in cell size, which can mechanistically explain the thermal dependence of body size. However, the theory predicts that thermal plasticity in cell size has adaptive value for ectotherms because there are different optimal cell-membrane-to-cell-volume ratios at different temperatures. At high temperatures, the demand for oxygen is high; therefore, a large membrane surface of small cells is beneficial because it allows high rates of oxygen transport into the cell. The metabolic costs of maintaining membranes become more important at low temperatures than at high temperatures, which favours large cells. In a field experiment, we manipulated the thermal conditions inside nests of the red mason bee, a solitary bee that does not regulate the temperature in its nests and whose larvae develop under ambient conditions. We assessed the effect of temperature on body mass and ommatidia size (our proxy of cell size). The body and cell sizes decreased in response to a higher mean temperature and greater temperature fluctuations. This finding is in accordance with predictions of the temperature-size rule and optimal cell size theory and suggests that both the mean temperature and the magnitude of temperature fluctuations are important for determining body and cell sizes. Additionally, we observed that males of the red mason bee tend to have larger ommatidia in relation to their body mass than females, which might play an important role during mating flight.",2017,68,A,39-44
The effect of water temperature and velocity on barnacle growth: Quantifying the impact of multiple environmental stressors,"Nishizaki, Michael T. and Carrington, Emily",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2015.02.002,"Organisms employ a wide array of physiological and behavioral responses in an effort to endure stressful environmental conditions. For many marine invertebrates, physiological and/or behavioral performance is dependent on physical conditions in the fluid environment. Although factors such as water temperature and velocity can elicit changes in respiration and feeding, the manner in which these processes integrate to shape growth remains unclear. In a growth experiment, juvenile barnacles (Balanus glandula) were raised in dockside, once-through flow chambers at water velocities of 2 versus 19 cm s(-1) and temperatures of 11.5 versus 14 degrees C. Over 37 days, growth rates (i.e., shell basal area) increased with faster water velocities and higher temperatures. Barnacles at high flows had shorter feeding appendages (i.e., cirri), suggesting that growth patterns are unlikely related to plastic responses in cirral length. A separate experiment in the field confirmed patterns of temperature- and flow-dependent growth over 41 days. Outplanted juvenile barnacles exposed to the faster water velocities (32 +/- 1 and 34 +/- 1 cm s(-1); mean +/- SE) and warm temperatures (16.81 +/- 0.05 degrees C) experienced higher growth compared to individuals at low velocities (1 +/- 1 cm s(-1)) and temperatures (13.67 +/- 0.02 degrees C). Growth data were consistent with estimates from a simple energy budget model based on previously measured feeding and respiration response curves that predicted peak growth at moderate temperatures (15 degrees C) and velocities (20-30 cm s(-1)). Low growth is expected at both low and high velocities due to lower encounter rates with suspended food particles and lower capture efficiencies respectively. At high temperatures, growth is likely limited by high metabolic costs, whereas slow growth at low temperatures may be a consequence of low oxygen availability and/or slow cirral beating and low feeding rates. Moreover, these results advocate for approaches that consider the combined effects of multiple stressors and suggest that both increases and decreases in temperature or flow impact barnacle growth, but through different physiological and behavioral mechanisms.

Effects of overwintering temperature on the survival of the black garden ant (<i>Lasius niger</i>),"Haatanen, Marja-Katariina and van Ooik, Tapio and Sorvari, Jouni",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2015.02.012,"The overwintering temperatures of ants might well be elevated due to climate change. We studied whether the overwintering temperature affects the survival of the queens and whole colonies of the black garden ant, Lasius niger (Linnaeus, 1758). In two consecutive years (2009, 2010) we collected mated, colony founding queens (n=280) from the urban area of Turku, Finland. Half of the queens overwintered in +7 to +8 degrees C and the other half in +2 degrees C. After the overwintering period, we determined their survival rate and measured the body fat content, body size and immune defence (encapsulation rate) of overwintering queens. Using the same setup, we studied the survival of 1-year-old L niger colonies (queen \& workers). Overwintering at a lower temperature (+2 degrees C) decreased the survival of workers. The survival of colony founding queens differed between years, but unlike with workers, the overwintering temperature did not affect their survival: neither in the colony experiment nor in the single queen experiment. All of the surviving queens managed to produce their worker offspring at the same rate. The relative amount of body fat of queens was higher for those who overwintered at a lower temperature, which is likely a result of lower energy consumption. We did not detect differences in the encapsulation rate between the temperature treatment groups. The ability of colony founding queens to tolerate wide overwintering temperature variations present in urban environments may explain the success of the colony in urban areas. As the colony grows, the overwintering chambers may extend more deeply into the ground. Thus, workers may not have to cope with such cold conditions as colony founding queens. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Thermal tolerance plasticity and dynamics of thermal tolerance in Eublepharis macularius: Implications for future climate-driven heat stress,"White, Emma and Kim, Solyip and Wegh, Garrett and Chiari, Ylenia",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103912,"The intensity and duration of heat waves, as well as average global temperatures, are expected to increase due to climate change. Heat waves can cause physiological stress and reduce fitness in animals. Species can reduce overheating risk through phenotypic plasticity, which allows them to raise their thermal tolerance limits over time. This mechanism could be important for ectotherms whose body temperatures are directly influenced by available environmental temperatures. Geckos are a large, diverse group of ectotherms that vary in their thermal habitats and times of daily activity, which could affect how they physiologically adjust to heat waves. Data on thermal physiology are scarce for reptiles, with only one study in geckos. Understanding thermal tolerance and plasticity, and their relationship, is essential for understanding how some species are able to adjust or adapt to changing temperatures. In this study, we estimated thermal tolerance and plasticity, and their interaction, in the crepuscular gecko, Eublepharis macularius, a species that is emerging as a model for reptile biology. After estimating basal thermal tolerance for 28 geckos, thermal tolerance was measured for each individual a second time at several timepoints (3, 6, or 24 h) to determine thermal tolerance plasticity. We found that thermal tolerance plasticity (1) does not depend on the basal thermal tolerance of the organism, (2) was highest after 6 h from initial heat shock, and (3) was negatively influenced by individual body mass. Our findings contribute to the increasing body of work focused on understanding the influence of biological and environmental factors on thermal tolerance plasticity in organisms and provide phenotypic data to further investigate the molecular basis of thermal tolerance plasticity in organisms.",2024,123,NA,NA
Heat stress disrupts spermatogenesis via modulation of sperm-specific calcium channels in rats,"Abd El-Emam, Mahran Mohamed and Ray, Manobendro Nath and Ozono, Mizune and Kogure, Kentaro",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103465,"Heat is a detrimental environmental stressor that disrupts spermatogenesis and results in male infertility. Pre-vious investigations have shown that heat stress reduces the motility, number, and fertilization ability of living spermatozoa. Sperm hyperactivation, capacitation, acrosomal reaction, and chemotaxis towards the ova are regulated by the cation channel of sperm (CatSper). This sperm-specific ion channel triggers the influx of calcium ions into sperm cells. The aim of this study in rats was to investigate whether heat treatment affected the expression levels of CatSper-1 and-2, together with the sperm parameters, testicular histology and weight. The rats were exposed to heat stress for 6 days and the cauda epididymis and testis were collected 1, 14, and 35 days after heat treatment to measure sperm parameters, gene and protein expression, testicular weight, and histology. Interestingly, we found that heat treatment caused a notable downregulation of CatSper-1 and-2 expression at all three time points. In addition, there were significant reductions in sperm motility and number and an increase in the percentage of abnormal sperm at 1 and 14 days, with cessation of sperm production at 35 days. Furthermore, expression of the steroidogenesis regulator, 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD) was upregulated in the 1-, 14-and 35-day samples. Heat treatment also upregulated the expression of the apoptosis regulator, BCL2-associated X protein (BAX), decreased testicular weight, and altered testicular histology. Therefore, our data showed for the first time that heat stress downregulated CatSper-1 and-2 in the rat testis, and that this may be a mechanism involved in heat stress-induced impairment of spermatogenesis.",2023,112,NA,NA

The analysis includes the thermal effects on the growth performance, metabolism and physiology of meagre, including a range of molecular, haematological, metabolic, enzymatic and hormonal indicators, as well as the effects on the proximate composition and ingestion speed. Meagre performs best between 24 and 29 degrees C while the temperature of 34 degrees C is very close to the upper end of its temperature tolerance range. At 34 degrees C meagre exhibits a poor growth performance and physiological status, increased blood clotting, high mortality rates and a diminished capacity for aerobic metabolism, as indicated by its low aerobic scope (129 mg kg(-1) h(-1)). Meagre may tolerate short exposures to high temperatures after sufficient acclimation (Critical thermal maximum of 37.5 degrees C after accli-mation to 29 degrees C) but its overall performance declines under prolonged exposure, suggesting that this emerging aquaculture species may be vulnerable to global warming. Our work corroborates previous findings on the thermal preferences of the species, identifies critical biological thresholds, and provides insights into the effects of prolonged exposure to high temperature regimes.",2021,100,NA,NA

Taylor's Gaussian curve characterized embryonic development, which was most rapid at 26.9 degrees C. However, half-grown embryos aestivated at high temperatures, resulting in a significant shift in the optimum temperature to complete embryonic development to 24.1 degrees C and a reduction in the breadth of the performance curve (thermal breadth). Fully grown embryos hatched fastest at relatively low temperatures (21.8 degrees C), whereas nymphal development was maximized at relatively high temperatures (35.7 degrees C). Thermal breadths for nymphal hatching and development were also significantly broader than that for embryonic development.

Furthermore, the mRNA expression of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene was analyzed under the stress. We found that the levels of the plasma cortisol, TSH, T3, glucose, and TC increased under the low temperature stress, suggesting that elevated hormones may be conducive to promoting the mobilization of the glucose and lipid in L. crocea exposed to low temperature. During the rewarming period, the plasma cortisol level decreased, whereas the T3 level was still significantly higher than that in the control group. Notably, the plasma T4 level was unaffected by the temperature changes. Furthermore, the sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that the GR protein of L. crocea had high homology and a similar protein structure with those from other teleosts. Under the low temperature stress, the GR mRNA expression increased in the brain and head kidney, whereas it basically returned to the control level following rewarming. These findings revealed the changes of the hormones and the potential function of the GR gene in L. crocea following exposure to low temperature, providing some insights into breeding low temperatureresistant varieties of L. crocea.",2021,99,NA,NA
Impact of heat stress on broilers with varying body weights: Elucidating their interactive role through physiological signatures,"Gogoi, Swapnali and Kolluri, Gautham and Tyagi, Jagbir Singh and Marappan, Gopi and Manickam, Kesavan and Narayan, Raj",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102840,"Physiological determinants of different body weight (BW) broiler chickens under heat stressed conditions were investigated to compare the performance at market age considering medium body weight group as standard. At 5 weeks, broilers were categorized randomly into 3 treatments (N = 24 per group) as high (HBW) ( 1050 g), medium (MBW) (900?1050 g) and low (LBW) (<900 g) followed by simultaneous exposure to normal and heat stress (HS) conditions at 40 ? 1 ?C and 45 ? 5\% RH for 4 h/day for a period of 7 days (D) and sample collection was employed at D0, D3 and D7. Physiological and stress responses, haematological and biochemical profile, intestinal gross and histological aspects were estimated using standard protocols. Heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure were significantly (P = 0.000) higher in HBW broilers followed by low and medium ones. Heat stress exposure indicated significant (P = 0.000) increase in heart rate, arterial blood pressure, respiration rate and comb temperature while cloacal temperature remained unaffected. Lymphocytes, eosinophils, total red blood cell count, haemoglobin, and haematocrit were reduced (P = 0.000) whereas mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin, heterophil count and heterophil to lymphocyte ratio were increased (P = 0.000) in response to HS. Circulating corticosterone and tri-iodothyronine concentrations showed inverse relationship with respect to BW variation and HS duration respectively with significant interaction (P = 0.000). Higher protein in LBW was observed on D3. Serum triglycerides remained unaffected till D3 exposure but significantly (P = 0.017) reduced on D7 with lowest content in HBW group. Serum alkaline phosphatase increased in LBW group with significant heat stress interaction (P = 0.000) on D3. HS reduced villi length and crypt depth; but their corresponding ratio increased. In conclusion, HBW broilers are more affected than MBW or LBW groups. This study established interactive roles of BW and HS on physiological responses in broilers.",2021,97,NA,NA
Short communication: Context matters: Adult size is contingent on embryonic temperature in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>,"Hoover, Megan M. and Marks, Christopher",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102820,"Temperature is a critical factor in shaping ectothermic development. Developmental temperature may constrain, alter, or redirect phenotypes expressed later in life. Recent studies have begun to analyze the consequences of mismatches between developmental and adult environments. Few studies analyze the consequences environmental mismatches during development yield on adult phenotypes. The aim of this study was to determine how mismatched temperatures during development affect adult size in Drosophila melanogaster. We employed a full factorial design in which eggs were incubated for 24 h in one of two temperature treatments (18 degrees C or 28 degrees C) with half of the flies subsequently being switched to the opposite temperature treatment for the remainder of development. We measured body size shortly after eclosure. We found that variation in size after eclosure was contingent upon the temperature during the embryo stage. Flies reared initially in 18 degrees C eclosed larger regardless of the subsequent temperature until eclsoure. Flies reared initially in 28 degrees C, however, eclosed smaller only if they remained in 28 degrees C until eclosure. The degree of plasticity in size was therefore contingent upon temperature during the embryo stage. We discuss the implications of employing full factorial approaches to consider the full context of phenotypic outcomes in light of changing developmental environments.",2021,95,NA,NA
Temperature-dependent exercise recovery is not associated with behavioral thermoregulation in a salmonid fish,"Rowsey, Lauren E. and Kieffer, James D. and Speers-Roesch, Ben",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103888,"The relationship between behavioral thermoregulation and physiological recovery following exhaustive exercise is not well understood. Behavioral thermoregulation could be beneficial for exercise recovery; for example, selection of cooler temperatures could reduce maintenance metabolic cost to preserve aerobic scope for recovery cost, or selection of warmer temperatures could accelerate recovery of exercise metabolites. While post-exercise behavioral thermoregulation has been observed in lizards and frogs, little is known about its importance in fish. We examined the influence of post-exercise recovery temperature on metabolic rate, thermal preference, and metabolite concentrations in juvenile brook char (Salvelinus fontinalis). Fish were acclimated to and exercised at 15 degrees C, then recovered at either 15 degrees C or 10 degrees C while their metabolic rate was measured via respirometry. Metabolite concentrations were measured in fish after exercise at 15 degrees C and recovery under one of three thermal treatments (to simulate various behavioral thermoregulation scenarios): (i) 6 h recovery at 15 degrees C, (ii) 6 h recovery at 10 degrees C, or (iii) 3 h recovery at 10 degrees C followed by 3 h recovery at 15 degrees C. Thermal preference was quantified using a static temperature preference system (15 degrees C vs. 10 degrees C). Metabolic rates returned to resting faster at 10 degrees C compared with 15 degrees C, although at 10 degrees C there was a tradeoff of delayed metabolite recovery. Specifically, post-exercise plasma osmolality, plasma lactate, and muscle lactate remained elevated for the entire period in fish recovering at 10 degrees C, whereas these parameters returned to resting levels by 6 h in fish from the other two recovery groups. Regardless, fish did not exhibit clear behavioral thermoregulation (i.e., fish overall did not consistently prefer one temperature) to prioritize either physiological recovery process. The advantage of metabolic rate recovery at cooler temperatures may balance against the advantage of metabolite recovery at warmer temperatures, lessening the usefulness of behavioral thermoregulation as a post-exercise recovery strategy in fish.",2024,123,NA,NA
Physiological and behavioral responses of laying hens exposed to long-term high temperature,"Kim, Da-Hye and Lee, Yoo-Kyung and Lee, Sung-Dae and Kim, Sang-Ho and Lee, Kyung-Woo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103017,"The present study was conducted to investigate the impact of a 42 d period of heat stress on laying hens with respect to rectal temperature, body-surface temperature, heart rate, heterophil to lymphocyte ratio (H/L ratio), corticosterone (CORT) in plasma and yolk samples, and video-assessed behaviors. A total of one hundred twenty 56-week-old ISA-brown laying hens were continuously exposed to one of three temperature regimes: optimal (LT; 22 degrees C), moderate (MT; 27 degrees C), and high (HT; 32 degrees C). The relative humidity was maintained at 50\% in all treatments. HT vs. MT and LT increased rectal temperature, heart rate, and body-surface temperature on all days (P < 0.05). HT vs. LT raised (P < 0.05) the H/L ratio in blood at day 42 following heat exposure. On the other hand, both HT- and MT-exposed laying hens had higher (P < 0.05) plasma CORT compared with those on LT group only at 28 and 42 d following heat treatment. Yolk CORT was elevated (P < 0.05) in the HT vs. MT and LT groups at 3 and 14 d following heat treatment. Panting and wing elevation were the most relevant behaviors in laying hens exposed to HT vs. MT and LT.

As such, climate change may trigger multiple, interacting phenotypic responses, which underscores the nuances of characterizing a species capacity to adapt and respond to climate change. In this study, we use a model frog species, Bufo gargarizans, to examine how three phenotypes, thermal tolerance limits (critical thermal minimum, CTmin and critical thermal maximum, CTmax), ontogeny, and behavioral preferences in temperature (Tpref) respond to different levels of thermal exposure (i.e., acclimation ranging from 10 degrees C to 30 degrees C). Acclimation temperature had little effect on Tpref of tadpoles, yet behaviorally they showed strong signs of thermal selection towards an optimum. Both CTmin and CTmax increased with acclimation temperature with an approximate 10\% increase in tolerance limits per 1 degrees C increase in exposure. Development and body size both responded to acclimation temperature, both of which also influenced lower but not upper thermal limits. Our study highlights the idiosyncrasies of estimating climate vulnerability, where multiple phenotypes can respond to shifts in temperature-a complexity that is especially apparent in species with complex life-cycles.",2021,97,NA,NA
Biochemical composition and adenylate energy charge shifts in longfin yellowtail <i>(Seriola rivoliana)</i> embryos during development under different temperatures,"Pacheco-Carlon, Nairoby and Salgado-Garcia, Rosa L. and Guerrero-Tortolero, Danitzia A. and Kraffe, Edouard and Campos-Ramos, Rafael and Racotta, Ilie S.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103470,"The longfin yellowtail Seriola rivoliana is an emerging species for aquaculture diversification worldwide and production relies on fertilized eggs from captive broodstock. Temperature is the main factor that influences the developmental process and success during fish ontogeny. However, the effects of temperature on the utilization of the main biochemical reserves and bioenergetics are scarcely investigated in fish, whereas protein, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism have critical roles in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis. In this context, we aimed to evaluate metabolic fuels (protein, lipids, triacylglicerides, carbohydrates), adenylic nucleotides and derivates (ATP, ADP, AMP, IMP), and the adenylate energy charge (AEC) during embryogenesis and in hatched larvae in S. rivoliana at different temperatures. For this purpose, fertilized eggs were incubated at six constant (20, 22, 24, 26, 28 and 30 degrees C) and two oscillating (21 reversible arrow 29 degrees C) temperatures. Biochemical analyses were made at blastula, optic vesicles, neurula, prehatch and hatch periods. Results indicated that the developmental period had a major influence on the biochemical composition at any temperature regime tested during the incubation. Protein content decreased only at hatching mainly due to the loss of the chorion, total lipids tended to increase at the neurula period and variations in carbohydrates depended on the particular spawn analyzed. Triacylglicerides were a critical egg fuel during hatching. The high AEC during embryogenesis and even in hatched larvae sug-gested an optimal energy balance regulation. The lack of critical biochemical changes from different temperature regimes during embryo development confirmed that this species exhibits a high adaptive capacity in response to constant and fluctuating temperatures. However, the timing of hatching was the most critical period of devel-opment, where biochemical components and energy utilization significantly changed. The oscillating tempera-tures tested may have physiological advantages without detrimental energetic effects that will require further research on larval quality after hatching.",2023,112,NA,NA
Acute exposure to high temperature affects expression of heat shock proteins in altricial avian embryos,"Galletta, Lorenzo and Craven, Meagan J. and Meillere, Alizee and Crowley, Tamsyn M. and Buchanan, Katherine L. and Mariette, Mylene M.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103347,"As the world warms, understanding the fundamental mechanisms available to organisms to protect themselves from thermal stress is becoming ever more important. Heat shock proteins are highly conserved molecular chaperones which serve to maintain cellular processes during stress, including thermal extremes. Developing animals may be particularly vulnerable to elevated temperatures, but the relevance of heat shock proteins for developing altricial birds exposed to a thermal stressor has never been investigated. Here, we sought to test whether three stress-induced genes - HSPD1, HSPA2, HSP90AA1 - and two constitutively expressed genes - HSPA8, HSP90B1 - are upregulated in response to acute thermal shock in zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) embryos half-way through incubation. Tested on a gradient from 37.5 degrees C (control) to 45 degrees C, we found that all genes, except HSPD1, were upregulated. However, not all genes initiated upregulation at the same temperature. For all genes, the best fitting model included a correlate of developmental stage that, although it was never significant after multiple-test correction, hints that heat shock protein upregulation might increase through embryonic development. Together, these results show that altricial avian embryos are capable of upregulating a known protective mechanism against thermal stress, and suggest that these highly conserved cellular mecha-nisms may be a vital component of early developmental protection under climate change.",2022,110,NA,NA
Upper thermal tolerance plasticity in tropical amphibian species from contrasting habitats: Implications for warming impact prediction,"Simon, Monique Nouailhetas and Ribeiro, Pedro Leite and Navas, Carlos Arturo",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2014.12.008,"Tropical ectothermic species are currently depicted as more vulnerable to increasing temperatures because of the proximity between their upper thermal limits and environmental temperatures. Yet, the acclimatory capacity of thermal limits has rarely been measured in tropical species, even though they are generally predicted to be smaller than in temperate species. We compared critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and warming tolerance (WT: the difference between CTmax and maximum temperature, T-max), as well as CTmax acclimatory capacity of toad species from the Atlantic forest (AF) and the Brazilian Caatinga (CAA), a semi-arid habitat with high temperatures. Acclimation temperatures represented the mean temperatures of AF and CAA habitats, making estimates of CTmax and WT more ecologically realistic. CAA species mean CTmax was higher compared to AF species in both acclimation treatments. Clutches within species, as well as between AF and CAA species, differed in CTmax plasticity and we discuss the potential biological meaning of these findings. We did not find a trade-off between absolute CTmax and CTmax plasticity, indicating that species can have both high CTmax and high CTmax a plasticity. Although CTmax was highly correlated to T-max, CTmax plasticity was not related to T-max or T-max coefficients of variation. CAA species mean WT was lower than for AF species, but still very high for all species, diverging from other studies with tropical species. This might be partially related to over-estimation of vulnerability due to under-appreciation of realistic acclimation treatments in CTmax estimation. Thus, some tropical species might not be as vulnerable to warming as previously predicted if CTmax is considered as a shifting population parameter. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Fumigation is often used to eliminate infestations, but it is costly, has negative environmental effects and does not prevent reinfestation. Heat treatment has been suggested as an alternative. Many insect pest mitigation strategies recommend 30 min exposure at 56 degrees C, but this may be difficult to achieve in structural applications. The potential for heating at lower temperatures was explored to determine the effect on termite survival and gut fauna. Exposure to 40 degrees C up to an hour did not kill the termites; however, 1-h exposure at 45 degrees C was lethal. Exposure for little as 3 min at 50 degrees C or 2 min at 55 degrees C was lethal. Protozoa levels were lower in termites that survived shorter exposures, but there appeared to be some recovery over time. The results suggest that short term exposures to 50 or 55 degrees C could be used to eliminate infestations, creating an opportunity for localized spot heating as a mitigation measure.",2022,104,NA,NA

We investigated whether (i) chill coma recovery time (CCRt) changes during the ontogenetic development of this species, (ii) CCRt varies in response to repeated cold shocks, and (iii) CCRt could be a good predictor of winter survival ability in adults. CCRt decreased during larval development, the lowest CCRt values were observed in teneral adults (one and four days old), and significantly higher values were observed for older adults (16 and 32 days old). Repeated cold shocks (two hours at -3 degrees C), interrupted by short (30 min) warm periods (22 degrees C) resulted in decreased CCRt after the second cold shock, probably depicting an acclimation response, but then CCRt increased with additional cold shocks, likely revealing the accumulation of chill injuries. The CCRt of pre-overwintering individuals was not correlated with their winter survival. This indicates that CCRt is not a reliable measure of cold tolerance in H. axyridis. However, this result could be partially affected by the experimental setup the use of laboratory-reared individuals who experienced standardized conditions and thus the variability in CCRt of tested animals could be much lower than the variability present in nature. The substantial variation observed over the ontogenetic development of H. axyridis poses important methodological implications for future studies, as animals of the same stage/age should be compared with each other. The observed U-shaped response to repeated cold shocks indicates that the expectation of linearity between cold exposure and insect response is an oversimplification of real situations.",2018,74,NA,275-280

We tested the thermal coadaptation hypothesis and Huey's energetics model with growth rates of juvenile Yarrow's spiny lizards (Sceloporus jarrovii). We compared the preferred (selected) T-b range (T-sel) of lizards in high and low energy states to their optimal temperature (T-o) for growth over nine weeks, and determined whether the T-o for growth depended on food availability. We also measured the same lizards' resting metabolic rate at five T(b)s to test the energetics model assumptions that metabolic cost increases exponentially with T-b and does not differ between energy states. The T-sel of lizards on both diets overlapped with the T-o for growth. The assumptions of the energetics model were verified, but the T-o for net energy gain did not depend on food availability. Therefore, we found support for the thermal coadaptation hypothesis. We did not find support for the energetics model, but this may have been due to low statistical power.",2017,70,B,86-96
Larval feeding activity and use of embryonic resources determine juvenile performance of the common prawn Palaemon serratus,"Baudet, Jean-Baptiste and Jeanne, Jason and Xuereb, Benoit and Dedourge-Geffard, Odile and Duflot, Aurelie and Poret, Agnes and Tremolet, Gauthier and Le Foll, Frank and Coulaud, Romain",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103892,"Phenotypic links are the potential for ``carryover{''} of effects of experience during one life history stage into performance and selection at subsequent stages.

We are studying these effects by following individuals of the shrimp Palaemon serratus from the embryonic (eggs carried by females) through the larval phase (pelagic) to the juvenile phase (benthic). In experiment 1, we investigated the effects of larval prey concentration (10, 4 and 2 Artemia/mL) and larval incubation temperature (16 and 22 degrees C) on larval performance (metamorphosis rate, developmental duration and growth) and then on juvenile performance (survival and Specific Growth Rate, SGR, at 18 and 24 degrees C in 14 days). In experiment 2, we investigated the effects of embryonic incubation temperature (larval biomass and lipid content of newly hatched larvae from embryos incubated at 12 and 18 degrees C) and larval prey concentration on larval performance and then on juvenile performance. In both experiments, the larvae plastically increased their development time in response to the reduction in temperature and prey concentration, whereas their survival decreased with temperature and prey concentration. The quantity of lipids available at hatching decreased with decreasing embryonic incubation temperature, which reduced the larval performance, particularly with a low concentration of prey. Survival at 14 days post-metamorphosis was significantly reduced when the embryos were incubated at 12 degrees C compared with those incubated at 18 degrees C, regardless of the subsequent larval incubation conditions, revealing phenotypic links between overconsumption of embryonic yolk reserves and post-metamorphic fitness.

Effects of the temperature during embryonic development on adult reproduction and the phenotype of the second generation in zebra finches,"Hope, Sydney F. and Angelier, Frederic",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103787,"Across taxa, the temperature experienced by individuals early in life can have large effects on their development. However, comparatively little is known about whether the effects of this thermal developmental environment can be long-lasting or transgenerational. In birds, one important aspect of the developmental environment is incubation and, in general, eggs incubated at low temperatures produce offspring with smaller morphology, suboptimal physiology, and even lower long-term survival. Yet, little is known about whether incubation temperature may affect avian reproduction in adulthood, and nothing is known about whether the effects of avian incubation temperature may be transgenerational. To investigate this, we incubated zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) eggs at two different temperatures: 37.5 degrees C ('control') and 36.3 degrees C ('low'), raised nestlings until adulthood, and allowed same-temperature treatment pairs to reproduce. We found that F-1 individuals incubated at the low temperature had shorter beaks at the start of reproduction than those incubated at the control temperature. Further, compared to those from control parents, F-2 offspring from parents incubated at the low temperature had lighter body masses at 5 days-old and had shorter beaks at 30 days-old. However, we found little evidence that incubation temperature affected other aspects of reproduction, with no effect on latency to lay, clutch size, egg mass, incubation period, hatching success/asynchrony, fledging, or the number of offspring that ultimately survived until independence. Overall, we found some evidence that a difference in the early thermal developmental environment can have lasting morphological effects into the next generation. However, future work is needed to determine whether the incubation temperature that birds experience as embryos may influence parental care behaviors or lifetime reproductive success.",2024,119,NA,NA

In the context of a fixed energy budget, organisms tend to allocate resources in order to maximize one at the expense of the other, in what has been called the lifespan-reproduction trade-off. Reproductive arrest and extended lifespan are common responses to low temperatures in many insects including fruit flies. In this study, we aim to understand the overwintering strategy of two closely-related Drosophila species with contrasting distribution ranges. We compared survival, lifespan, ovarian maturation, and reproductive output (fecundity and fertility) of virgin and mated adults of both Drosophila buzzatii and Drosophila koepferae after long-term cold exposure at dormancy-inducing conditions (10 degrees C, 10:14 L:D) and controls (25 degrees C, 12:12 L:D). Virgin flies of D. buzzatii showed the longest lifespan (averaging 102 days) under dormancy-inducing conditions. Cold-induced reproductive arrest preserves reproductive capacity mainly in virgin females that mated after reproductive dormancy, indicating that males were much more susceptible to fertility loss than females, in both species. Notably, females of D. buzzatii were capable of protecting stored sperm from cold damage and produced viable progeny. Even if, in D. buzzatii, fertility of flies mated after the cold-exposure was extremely low, cold temperature likely sterilized D. koepferae males, indicating that cold carry-over effects are stronger for the species with the shorter lifespan. Such species-specific effects of low temperature over fitness likely contributed to the divergence of these closely-related species and to the spread of D. buzzatii into cooler environments.",2023,113,NA,NA
Rearing temperature conditions (constant <i>vs.</i> thermocycle) affect daily rhythms of thermal tolerance and sensing in zebrafish,"de Alba, Gonzalo and Fernando Lopez-Olmeda, Jose and Javier Sanchez-Vazquez, Francisco",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102880,"In the wild, the environment does not remain constant, but periodically oscillates so that temperature rises in the daytime and drops at night, which generates a daily thermocycle. The effects of thermocycles on thermal tolerance have been previously described in fish. However, the impact of thermocycles on daytime-dependent thermal responses and daily rhythms of temperature tolerance and sensing expression mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study investigates the effects of two rearing conditions: constant (26 degrees C, C) versus a daily thermocycle (28 degrees C in the daytime; 24 degrees C at night, T) on the thermal tolerance response in zebrafish. Thermal tolerance (mortality) was assessed in 4dpf (days post fertilization) zebrafish larvae after acute heat shock (39 degrees C for 1 h) at two time points: middle of the light phase (ML) or middle of the dark phase (MD). Thermal stress responses were evaluated in adult zebrafish after a 37 degrees C challenge for 1 h at ML or MD to examine the expression of the heat-shock protein (HSP) (hsp70, hsp90ab1, grp94, hsp90aa1, hspb1, hsp47, cirbp) and transient receptor potential (TRP) channels (trpv4, trpm4a, trpm2, trpa1b) in the brain. Finally, the daily rhythms of gene expression of HSPs and TRPs were measured every 4 h for 24 h. The results revealed the larval mortality rates and the expression induction of most HSPs in adult zebrafish brain reached the highest values in fish reared under constant temperature and subjected to thermal shock at MD. The expression of most HSPs and TRPs was mainly synchronized to the light/dark (LD) cycle, regardless of the temperature regime. Most HSPs involved in hyperthermic challenges displayed diurnal rhythms with their acrophases in phase with warm-sensing thermoTRPs acrophases. The cold-sensing trpa1b peaked in the second half of the light period and slightly shifted toward the dark phase anticipating the acrophase of cirpb, which is involved in hypothermic challenges. These findings indicated that: a) thermal shocks are best tolerated in the daytime; b) the implementation of daily thermocycles during larval development reduces mortality and stress-cellular expression of HSPs to an acute thermal stress at MD; c) daily rhythms need to be considered when discussing physiological responses of thermal sensing and thermotolerance in zebrafish.",2021,97,NA,NA

The kidney level of malondialdehyde was significantly increased in T2 and T3 animals by 74.29\%, whereas protein, catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione pemxidase activity were significantly lower (p < 0.05) compared with control. It was concluded that long-term exposure of female rabbits to elevated ambient temperatures induces heat stress and accompanying oxidative stress that consequently impairs physiological function.",2021,95,NA,NA

Re-establishment of C. seguenzae populations in the depleted habitats requires knowledge of its biology and breeding in captivity. Temperature has been recorded to affect the development in marine gastropods. The present study aims to describe the encapsulated development and study the effect of three temperature regimes, that the embryos are exposed to in the wild (17, 20, 23 degrees C), on it. At the stage of morula (7th Day After Deposition - DAD) 180 egg capsules were separated in three groups of 60 capsules. One group remained at 23 degrees C and the other two were acclimated at 20 and 17 degrees C. Two capsules were sampled randomly from each temperature setup (every day during the first 5 days, D1-D5, every other day from D7 to D17 and every other two days from D20 to eclosion), opened and the eggs, embryos or larvae were photographed under stereoscope. Stages of development and shape were assessed and dimensions were measured from microphotographs. All developmental stages were described in relation to temperature and time. At 23 degrees C eclosion of free swimming veligers occurred 49 DAD, 17 days faster than the embryonic development at 20 degrees C. Eclosion at 17 degrees C was not observed up until the 74th DAD when the last sampling was conducted. An increased amount of larval deformities was observed at 17 degrees C reaching 94\% during the last sampling (D74), while at eclosion only 4 and 3\% of the hatching larvae were deformed at 20 and 23 degrees C respectively. In this study temperature appears as a key factor during the development of the marine gastropod Charonia seguenzae, affecting the survival and developmental rate. Although temperature affected the size of intermediate stages, the size of free swimming veligers at 20 and 23 degrees C did not differ.",2021,100,NA,NA
Thermoneutral temperature reduces liver volume but increases fat content in a mammalian hibernator,"Wang, Xingyi and Watt, Christine F. and Sinclair, Kevin J. and McKenzie, Charles A. and Staples, James F. and MacCannell, Amanda D. V.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.05.015,"Hibernators survive challenging winters by entering torpor, which lowers body temperature (T-b) to similar to 5 degrees C for 12-14 days, followed by spontaneous arousals where T-b increases to similar to 37 degrees C for 10-12 h before entering another torpor bout. This T-b cycle is accompanied by significant fluctuations in metabolic rate. Little is known about the role of the liver in lipid metabolism during hibernation. In this study we measured the effect of ambient temperature on liver volume and lipid content in 13-lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus). We housed animals at thermoneutral (25 degrees C) or cold (5 degrees C) ambient temperatures, with the same photoperiod (12 h light:12 h dark) for an entire year. We determined volume and water-fat ratio of the liver using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ambient temperature significantly affected both liver volume and fat content. From October to August squirrels housed at 25 degrees C had 25\% smaller livers compared to the squirrels housed at 5 degrees C, but their average lipid content (13.3\%) was 37\% higher. Because the squirrels housed at 25 degrees C appeared to continue feeding throughout the winter but did not enter extended torpor, more carbohydrates may have been diverted to lipid stores. By contrast, animals housed at 5 degrees C did not appear to feed, and carbohydrates would likely be preferentially stored in the liver as glycogen to supply glucose for brain metabolism. These results suggest that the fat burden caused by hibernators preparing for winter can lead to symptoms of metabolic syndrome, but that these symptoms are reversible in the spring.",2019,83,NA,172-177

P.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.11.017,"Temperature affects the physiology and life-history of ectothermic animals, often increasing metabolic rate and decreasing body size. Oxygen limitation has been put forward as a mechanism to explain thermal responses of body size and the ability to survive stress. However the time-scales involved in growth performance and heat tolerance differ radically. In order to increase our understanding of oxygen and temperature effects on body size and heat tolerance and the time scale involved, we reared Lymnaea stagnalis under six combinations of temperature and oxygen tension from hatching up to an age of 300 days and recorded shell length during this whole period. At the end of this period, we determined scope for growth by measuring food intake rate, assimilation efficiency, respiration rate and ammonium excretion rate at two different temperatures. We also measured the snails' ability to survive heat stress (CTmax), both at normoxia and hypoxia. We found that scope for growth and long term growth performance were much more affected by interactions of chronic oxygen and temperature conditions during rearing than by acute conditions during testing. Furthermore, our study shows that individual variation in growth performance can be traced back to individual differences in rates of food and oxygen consumption. Developmental acclimation also gave rise to differences in CTmax, but these were relatively small and were only expressed when CTmax was tested under hypoxia. The large effects of rearing oxygen conditions on growth and other physiological rates compared to modest effects of test oxygen conditions on CTmax suggest that small effects of hypoxia on the short term (e.g. heat tolerance) may nevertheless have large repercussions on the long term (e.g. growth and reproduction), even in a pulmonate snail that can compensate for hypoxia to some extent by aerial respiration.",2017,68,A,27-38
Is the temperature-size rule mediated by oxygen in aquatic ectotherms?,"Hoefnagel, K. Natan and Verberk, Wilco C. E. P.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2014.12.003,"Temperature is an important environmental factor that influences key traits like body size, growth rate and maturity. Ectotherms reared under high temperatures usually show faster growth, but reach a smaller final size, a phenomenon known as the temperature-size rule (TSR). Oxygen may become a limiting resource at high temperatures, when demand for oxygen is high, especially in water as oxygen uptake is far more challenging under water than in air. Therefore, in aquatic ectotherms, the TSR might very well be mediated by temperature effects on oxygen availability and oxygen demand. To distinguish between the direct effects of temperature and oxygen mediated effects, growth rate and final size were measured in the aquatic ectotherm Asellus aquaticus (Linnaeus, 1758) reared under different temperature and oxygen conditions in a factorial design. Growth could be best described by a modified Von Bertalanffy growth function. Both temperature and oxygen affected age at maturity and growth. Growth responses to temperature were dependent on oxygen conditions (interactive effect of temperature and oxygen). Only under hypoxic conditions, when oxygen was mast limiting, did we find a classic TSR. Moreover, when comparing treatments differing in temperature, but where the balance between oxygen demand and supply was similar, high temperature increased both growth rate and final size. Thus effects of oxygen may resolve the life-history puzzle of the TSR in aquatic ectotherms. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2015,54,SI,56-65

The linear and quadratic effects of temperature and salinity on SGR, plasma osmolality, and gill Na+, K+-ATPase activity were statistically significant (P < 0.05). The interactive effects of temperature and salinity on plasma osmolality were significant (P < 0.05). In contrast, the interaction term was not significant for SGR, FE, and gill Na+, K+-ATPase activity (()p > 0.05). The regression equations for SGR, FE, plasma osmolality, and gill Na+, K+-ATPase activity against the two factors of interest had coefficients of determination of 0.944, 0.984, 0.966, and 0.960, respectively (P < 0.01). The optimal temperature/salinity combination was 28.9 degrees C/7.8 parts per thousand at which SGR (2.26\% d(1)) and FE (0.82) were highest. These values correspond to the optimal temperature/salinity combination (29.1 degrees C/7.5 parts per thousand) and the lowest plasma osmolality (348.38 mOsmol kg(-1)) and gill Na+, K+-ATPase activity (1.31 mu mol Pi. h(-1) g(-1) protein), and resulted in an energy-saving effect on osmoregulation, which promoted growth.

Invasive frogs show persistent physiological differences to elevation and acclimate to colder temperatures,"Marchetti, Jack R. and Beard, Karen H. and Virgin, Emily E. and Lewis, Erin L. and Hess, Steven C. and Ki, Kwanho C. and Sermersheim, Layne O. and Furtado, Adriana P. and French, Susannah S.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103590,"The coqui frog (Eleutherodactylus coqui) was introduced to the island of Hawai'i in the 1980s and has spread across much of the island. Concern remains that this frog will continue to expand its range and invade higher elevation habitats where much of the island's endemic species are found. We determined whether coqui thermal tolerance and physiology change along Hawai'i's elevational gradients. We measured physiological responses using a short-term experiment to determine baseline tolerance and physiology by elevation, and a long-term experiment to determine the coqui's ability to acclimate to different temperatures. We collected frogs from low, medium, and high elevations. After both the short and long-term experiments, we measured critical thermal minimum (CTmin), blood glucose, oxidative stress, and corticosterone levels. CTmin was lower in high elevation frogs than low elevation frogs after the short acclimation experiment, signifying that they acclimate to local conditions. After the extended acclimation, CTmin was lower in frogs acclimated to cold temperatures compared to warm-acclimated frogs and no longer varied by elevation. Blood glucose levels were positively correlated with elevation even after the extended acclimation, suggesting glucose may also be related to lower temperatures. Oxidative stress was higher in females than males, and corticosterone was not significantly related to any pre-dictor variables. The extended acclimation experiment showed that coquis can adjust their thermal tolerance to different temperatures over a 3-week period, suggesting the expansion of coqui into higher elevation habitats may still be possible, and they may not be as restricted by cold temperatures as previously thought.",2023,114,NA,NA

Feeling the heat: Extreme temperatures compromise constitutive innate humoral immunity and skin color in a desert dwelling lizard,"Plasman, Melissa and Torres, Roxana",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.05.012,"Environmental temperature, particularly in habitats with extreme temperature fluctuations, may shape selection pressures on life history traits. Especially in ectotherms, temperature affects performance, physiology, and in some species, skin color. Skin color can be a sexual ornament signaling the bearer's ability to resist infections, when only high-quality individuals are able to invest both in high immune defense and elaborate ornament expression. However, how the information content of these sexual traits may vary with environmental conditions has been less studied. Dickerson's collared lizard (Crotaphytus dickersonae) males are blue and have a black and white collar. This conspicuous coloration signals performance and immune response, and is related to body temperature. Here, by maintaining males at higher, lower, and mean environmental temperatures we evaluated whether temperature variation influences color and constitutive innate humoral immunity (agglutination and lysis titers, estimated through hemolysis-hemagglutination assays), and whether extreme temperatures impose trade-offs between color and humoral immunity. We found that at low and high temperature treatments males had lower agglutination and lysis titers, and at low temperature, blue chroma from the dorsum declined and males became greener. Interestingly, at low and control temperature treatments, agglutination titer and blue coloration were positively correlated, whereas high temperatures revealed a trade-off between increasing agglutination titers and displaying bluer skin color. Our results suggest that in the Dickerson collared lizard even short-term variation of environmental temperature affects performance of constitutive innate humoral immunity and the brilliant blue skin color. Particularly, high temperatures may compromise some components of male's immunity and sexual signaling.",2019,83,NA,142-149

We hypothesized that alligators would acclimate to cold temperature by increasing the metabolic capacity of skeletal muscles and the heart. Additionally, we hypothesized that lipid membranes in the thigh muscle and liver would respond to low temperature, either to maintain fluidity (via increased unsaturation) or to maintain enzyme reaction rates (via increased docosahexaenoic acid). Alligators were assigned to one of 3 temperature regimes beginning at 9 mo of age: constant warm (30 degrees C), constant cold (20 degrees C), and daily cycling for 12 hat each temperature. Growth rate over the following 7 mo was highest in the cycling group, which we suggest occurred via high digestive function or feeding activity during warm periods and energy-saving during cold periods. The warm group also grew faster than the cold group. Heart and liver masses were proportional to body mass, while kidney was proportionately larger in the cold group compared to the warm animals. Whole animal metabolic rate was higher in the warm and cycling groups compared to the cold group even when controlling for body - mass when assayed at 30 degrees C, but not at 20 degrees C. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation capacity in permeabilized fibers of thigh muscle and heart did not differ among treatments. Membrane fatty acid composition of the brain was largely unaffected by temperature treatment, but adjustments were made in the phospholipid headgroup composition that are consistent with homeoviscous adaptation. Thigh muscle cell membranes had elevated polyunsaturated fatty acids in the cold group relative to the cycling group, but this was not the case for thigh muscle mitochondrial membranes. Liver mitochondria from cold alligators had elevated docosahexaenoic acid, which might be important for maintenance of reaction rates of membrane-bound enzymes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Then juvenile fish being acclimated at three temperatures of 14, 18 and 22 degrees C were chosen to determine their critical thermal maximum (CTMax) and lethal thermal maximum (LTMax) by using the dynamic method. Growth rate of S. kozlovi larvae and juveniles was significantly influenced by temperature and fish size, exhibiting an increase with increased rearing temperature, but a decline with increased fish size. A significant ontogenetic variation in the optimal temperatures for maximum growth were estimated to be 24.7 degrees C and 20.6 degrees C for larvae and juveniles of S. kozlovi, respectively. The results also demonstrated that acclimation temperature had marked effects on their CTMax and LTMax, which ranged from 32.86 degrees C to 34.54 degrees C and from 33.79 degrees C to 34.80 degrees C, respectively. It is suggested that rearing temperature must never rise above 32 degrees C for its successful aquaculture. Significant temperature effects on the growth rate and thermal tolerance both exhibit a plasticity pattern.

These two processes often act together to generate latitudinal or elevational clines in acute temperature tolerance. Phenotypic plasticity is also subject to local adaptation, with the expectation that populations inhabiting more variable environments should exhibit greater phenotypic plasticity of thermal tolerance. Here we examine the potential for local adaptation and developmental plasticity of thermal tolerance in the widespread invasive tunicate Botryllus schlosseri. By comparing five populations across a thermal gradient spanning 4.4. of latitude in the northwest Atlantic, we demonstrate that warmer populations south of the Gulf of Maine exhibit significantly increased (similar to 0.2.C) post-larval temperature tolerance relative to the colder populations within it. We also show that B. schlosseri post-larvae possess a high degree of developmental plasticity for this trait, shifting their median temperature of survival (LT50) upwards by as much as 0.18. C per 1. C increase in environmental temperature. Lastly, we found that populations vary in their degrees of developmental plasticity, with populations that experience more pronounced short-term temperature variability exhibiting greater developmental plasticity, suggesting the local adaptation of developmental plasticity. By comparing the thermal tolerance of populations across space and through time, we demonstrate how geography and developmental plasticity have shaped thermal tolerance in B. schlosseri.

Reestablishment of C. seguenzae populations in the depleted habitats requires knowledge of its biology and breeding in captivity. Deformities have a huge impact on offspring survival and quality. Temperature has been recorded to affect the development of deformities in marine gastropods. The present study aims to identify the stage of development at which deformities occur, under four temperature regimes (17, 23, 26 and 29 degrees C). At the stages of trochophore, veliger and free veliger larvae, three capsules that were acclimated at the examined temperatures at the stage of morula were collected, opened and 50 larvae per capsule sampled. Deformities were observed at every examined developmental stage under all tested temperatures. The lower rate of deformities at every stage occurred at 23 degrees C. The higher tested temperature (29 degrees C) was lethal and at the lower tested temperature (17 degrees C) almost every specimen was deformed (96.66\%) at eclosion. The effect of acclimation at four developmental stages (morula, trochophore, shell formation and veliger) on the development of deformities at the free veligers of Charonia seguenzae, was studied under three temperature conditions (17, 26 and 29 degrees C). At eclosion, three capsules were collected, opened and 50 larvae per capsule were sampled. The acclimation at morula and trochophore larva stages led to the higher rates of deformities at eclosion. The size of the free veliger larvae was also affected by temperature with maximum size at eclosion observed at 23 degrees C. Charonia seguenzae's embryos tolerate elevated temperatures within environmental limits (26 degrees C) but near future global warming will probably pose a threat to their survival. The free veliger larvae survival at the environmental minimum is related to the time window of the acclimation, since Triton's embryos are more vulnerable to temperature alterations during the early developmental stages.",2021,100,NA,NA

To contribute to effective stocking (release of hatchery-reared juveniles in the field), we conducted four laboratory experiments using juvenile marbled flounder (Pseudopleuronectes yokohamae, around 30 mm standard length and 0.3 g body wet weight) acclimated at 12 ?C and 24 ?C for approximately 2 weeks to investigate the effects of acclimation temperature on high-temperature tolerance, food consumption, and growth performance. The acclimation to 24 ?C increased tolerance to high temperatures, as shown in a 24-h exposure experiment and in a temperature elevation experiment. The 50\% lethal temperature (upper incipient lethal temperature) was estimated to be 25.9 ?C and 29.0 ?C for the 12 ?C and 24 ?C acclimation groups, respectively. In subsequent experiments, we tested the effects of high and low temperature acclimation on the food consumption and growth performance of two size groups of juveniles (28.7 ? 2.0 and 34.5 ? 2.9 mm, mean ? SD), that were reared at temperatures ranging from 14 ?C to 23 ?C. The optimal temperature for growth was 20 ?C and did not differ between the acclimation temperatures or between the size groups. However, food consumption and growth performance were suppressed by acute temperature changes. Specifically, feeding and growth were lower in the 24 ?C-acclimated group than in the 12 ?C-acclimated group when exposed to 14 ?C, which is close to the natural water temperature at release in the field. These results suggest that experienced thermal history does not affect the optimal temperature but can affect the growth performance of juveniles. To maximize the post-release growth of hatchery-reared juveniles, the influence of thermal history should be taken into consideration and acute thermal changes before release should be avoided.",2021,97,NA,NA

Mahfujul and Ceylan, Hamid and Wong, Li Lian",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102830,"Although indigenous climbing perch (Anabas testudineusis) is a highly valuable species, slow growth pattern during the culture period impeding its commercial success in aquaculture. In many fish species, it has been demonstrated that incubation temperature of eggs influenced the muscle development and growth rates, which persisted throughout the subsequent larval and juvenile phases. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether different incubation temperature of eggs prior to hatching can stimulate the muscle development, growth, and growth-related gene expression of the slow-growing indigenous species of climbing perch. The fertilized eggs of A. testudineus from an artificial breeding program were incubated under control temperature of 24 ?C (IT24), 26 ?C (IT26), 28 ?C (IT28), and 30 ?C (IT30) in 10L glass aquaria with four replicated units for each temperature treatment. After hatching, the larvae from each incubated temperature were separately reared at ambient temperature for 10 days in aquarium, 20 days in hapas, and the next 42 days in cages, totaling 72 days post-hatching (dph). The hatching rates were found significantly (P < 0.05) higher in IT28 compared to the other incubation temperature treatments. After 72 dph, the growth performances (\%length gained, \%weight gained and SGR) were found to be significantly highest (P < 0.05) in the IT28, followed by the treatments IT30, IT26, and IT24, respectively. Survival rate (73 ? 1.257\%) was also found to be highest in the same treatment. The rate of new muscle fiber formation was identified to be significantly highest (P < 0.05) in IT28 followed by the IT26, IT30 and IT24, respectively. The relative mRNA expression level of GHRH, IGF1, IGF2 and PRL was also significantly highest in the IT28 (P < 0.05) compared to other treatments. Results from the present study clearly suggested that 28 ?C is the optimum eggs incubation temperature of the native strain of A. testudineus for its highest growth performances in captive breeding condition.",2021,96,NA,NA
Resetting thermal limits: 10-year-old white sturgeon display pronounced but reversible thermal plasticity,"Weber, Theresa A. and Dichiera, Angelina M. and Brauner, Colin J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103807,"While many ectotherms improve thermal tolerance in response to prolonged thermal stress, little is known about the lasting effects of warm acclimation after returning to cooler temperatures. Furthermore, thermal stress may disproportionately impact threatened and endangered species. To address this, we repeatedly measured critical thermal maxima ((CTmaxC)-C-degrees) and associated stress responses (hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, plasma cortisol) of endangered subadult white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) in response to control temperature (pre-acclimation; 14(degrees)C), after 1 month at either control or warm temperature (acclimation; 14C or 20(degrees)C), and after one smonth following return to control temperature (post-acclimation; 14(degrees)C). While control fish demonstrated fairly repeatable thermal tolerance (interclass correlation coefficient = 0.479), warm-acclimated fish experienced a -3.1(degrees)C increase in thermal tolerance and when re-acclimated to control temperature, decreased thermal tolerance -1.9(degrees)C. Hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, and final splenic somatic index (spleen mass relative to whole body mass, collected after post-acclimation CTmax) were not significantly different between control and treatment fish, suggesting no effects of warm acclimation on aerobic capacity. Plasma cortisol was significantly higher in control fish after pre-acclimation and post-acclimation CTmax trials, but importantly, acclimation temperature did not affect this response. Strikingly, final hepatosomatic index (relative liver size) was 45\% lower in treatment fish, indicating warm acclimation may have lasting effects on energy usage and metabolism, even after reacclimating to control temperature. To our knowledge, these 10-year-old subadult sturgeon are the oldest sturgeon experimentally tested with regards to thermal plasticity and demonstrate incredible capacity for thermal acclimation relative to other fishes. However, more research is needed to determine whether the ability to acclimate to warm temperature may come with a persistent cost.",2024,119,NA,NA
Urea and glucose modulation during freezing exposure in three temperate frogs reveals specific targets in relation to climate,"de Amaral, Marjoriane and Carvajalino-Fernandez, Juan Manuel and Nicieza, Alfredo G. and Tejedo, Miguel",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103854,"Amphibian diversity is most prominent in the warm and humid tropical and subtropical regions across the globe. Nonetheless, amphibians also inhabit high -altitude tropical mountains and regions at medium and high latitudes, exposing them to subzero temperatures and requiring behavioural or physiological adaptations to endure freezing events. While freeze tolerance has been predominantly reported in high -latitude zones where species endure prolonged freezing (several weeks or months), less is known about mid -latitudes amphibians exposed to occasional subzero temperatures. In this study, we employed a controlled ecological protocol, subjecting three frog species from the Iberian Peninsula ( Rana parvipalmata , Epidalea calamita , and Pelobates cultripes ) to a 2-h exposure to temperatures of -2 degrees C to investigate the accumulation of urea and glucose as physiological mechanisms associated with survival at freezing temperatures. Our results revealed a moderate response in the production of cryoprotectant metabolites under experimental freezing conditions, particularly urea, with notable findings in R. parvipalmata and E. calamita and no response in P. cultripes . However, no significant alterations in glucose concentrations were observed in any of the studied frog species. This relatively weak freezing tolerance response differs from the strong response exhibited by amphibians inhabiting high latitudes and enduring prolonged freezing conditions, suggesting potential reliance on behavioural adaptations to cope with occasional freezing episodes.",2024,121,NA,NA
Thermal stressors during embryo incubation have limited ontogenic carryover effects in brook trout,"Lechner, Emily R. and Stewart, Erin M. C. and Frasca, Vince R. and Jeffries, Ken M. and Wilson, Chris C. and Raby, Graham D.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103880,"Winter climate is changing rapidly in northern latitudes, and these temperature events have effects on salmonid thermal biology. Stressors during winter egg incubation could reduce hatching success and physiological performance of fall -spawning fishes. Here we quantified the potential for ontogenic carryover effects from embryonic thermal stress in multiple wild and hatchery -origin populations of brook trout ( Salvelinus fontinalis ), a temperate ectotherm native to northeastern North America. Fertilized eggs from four populations were incubated over the winter in the laboratory in four differing thermal regimes: ambient stream -fed water, chronic warming (\& thorn;2 degrees C), ambient with a mid -winter cold -shock, and short-term warming late during embryogenesis (to stimulate an early spring). We examined body size and upper thermal tolerance at the embryonic, fry (10 weeks post -hatch and 27-30 weeks post -hatch) and gravid adult (age 2+) life stages (overall N = 1482). In a separate experiment, we exposed developing embryos to acute seven-day heat stress events immediately following fertilization and at the eyed -egg stage, and then assessed upper thermal tolerance (CT max ) 37 weeks post -hatch. In all cases, fish were raised in common garden conditions after hatch (i.e., same temperatures). Our thermal treatments during incubation had effects that varied by life stage, with incubation temperature and life stage both affecting body size and thermal tolerance. Embryos incubated in warmer treatment groups had higher thermal tolerance; there was no effect of the mid -winter melt event on embryo CT max . Ten weeks after hatch, fry from the ambient and cold -shock treatment groups had higher and less variable thermal tolerance than did the warmer treatment groups. At 27-30 post -hatch and beyond, differences in thermal tolerance among treatment groups were negligible. Collectively, our study suggests that brook trout only exhibit short-term carryover effects from thermal stressors during embryo incubation, with no lasting effects on phenotype beyond the first few months after hatch.",2024,122,NA,NA
Physiologically-informed predictions of climate warming effects on native and non-native populations of blue catfish,"Nepal, Vaskar and Dillon, Maggie and Fabrizio, Mary C. and Tuckey, Troy D.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103951,"Blue catfish Ictalurus furcatus has been widely introduced throughout the United States to enhance recreational fisheries. Its success in both its native and non-native range, especially in the context of climate change, will be influenced by its thermal performance. We conducted a laboratory experiment to investigate the responses of wild-captured, subadult blue catfish to temperatures ranging from 7 degrees C to 38 degrees C. Blue catfish had relatively low standard metabolic rates, indicating low energetic demands, and hence an ability to survive well even during low-food conditions. Metabolic scope and food consumption rate increased with temperature, with metabolic scope peaking at 29.1 degrees C, and consumption rate peaking at 32 degrees C. Body condition remained high up to 32 degrees C, but decreased drastically thereafter, suggesting limitations in maintaining metabolism through food consumption at temperatures >32 degrees C; blue catfish cannot survive in such habitats indefinitely. Yet, many fish were able to survive temperatures as high as 38 degrees C for 5 days, suggesting that acute and occasionally chronic heat waves will not limit this species. Using these results, we also predicted the performance of blue catfish under prevailing conditions and under climate warming at seven locations throughout their current range in the U.S. We found that some blue catfish populations in southern and southeastern areas will likely experience temperatures above the optimal temperature for extended periods due to climate change, thus limiting potential habitat availability for this species. But, many non-native populations, especially those in northern areas such as Idaho, North Dakota, and northern California, may benefit from the expected warmer temperatures during spring and fall.",2024,124,NA,NA
Effects of a broad range of experimental temperatures on the population growth and body-size of five species of free-living nematodes,"Majdi, Nabil and Traunspurger, Walter and Fueser, Hendrik and Gansfort, Birgit and Laffaille, Pascal and Maire, Anthony",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.12.010,"The temperature-size rule postulates that the growth rates of ectotherms increase under rising temperatures, while the sizes of these organisms at maturity decrease. However, the upper temperature-tolerance range is also typically represented by a metabolic tipping point after which growth suddenly ceases. Free-living nematodes are important members of ecosystems, but little is known about their thermal tolerance. In the present study we measured the population growth rates and body-size distributions of five species of free-living bacterivorous nematodes exposed in the laboratory to a broad range of temperatures. This allowed a determination of their different thermal tolerance ranges, even of closely related species, including Plectus acuminatus (thermal optimum of 20-25 degrees C) and P. cf. velox (10-15 degrees C). With the exception of Acrobeloides now, which had the broadest thermal tolerance range, the population growth of the other species declined between 25 and 30 degrees C. Our results were consistent with the temperature-size rule, as the body-size of the tested species at maturity decreased with increasing temperature. This reduction was accompanied by a smaller number of eggs carried by mature females. Although our study was purely experimental, it suggests that heat waves or other alterations in the thermal regime affect the population dynamics and body-size structure of nematode communities in the field.",2019,80,NA,21-36
Short- and long-term dynamics of the physiological and behavioral response to heat stress and thymol supplementation in Japanese quail,"Emilia Fernandez, Maria and Carla Labaque, Maria and Orso, Gabriel and Hector Marin, Raul and Melissa Kembro, Jackelyn",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102876,"Organisms have evolved endogenous timing systems that enable them to predict temporal changes and to coordinate complex internal processes. However, temporal dynamics of biological responses are most often ignored in fields such as dietary supplementation of farm animals exposed to artificial environmental challenges. Herein, we hypothesized that the potential for thymol (2-isopropyl-5-methylphenol) to alleviate physiological and behavioral consequences of heat stress is time-dependent on both long-term (i.e. weeks) and short-term (i.e. within day) time scales. First, during 3-weeks adult female Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) were exposed daily to 9h of increased environmental temperature (34.2 +/- 0.1 degrees C). Controls remained at standard temperatures (23.6 +/- 0.1 degrees C). Simultaneously, half received thymol dietary supplementation and the other half a control basal diet. On day 4, both thymol and heat stress decreased body weight and feed intake respect to controls (basal, standard temperature). After three weeks, feed intake recovered for thymol groups. Therefore, we performed a second experiment focused on the critical first week of treatment, sampling variables three times a day. The beneficial effects of thymol supplementation were mainly observed during the morning, including prevention of high respiratory rates and reduction in the weight of droppings induced by heat stress, and increased walking under both temperatures. In summary, thymol's potential for alleviating heat stress consequences is timedependent, and can be conceived as an emergent property resulting from the complex interplay between the dynamics of the biological response to thymol and heat stress. Findings highlight the importance of considering time-related factors when developing supplementation protocols to mitigate environmental challenges.",2021,97,NA,NA
Integrated metabolome and transcriptome analyses revealing the effects of thermal stress on lipid metabolism in juvenile turbot <i>Scophthalmus maximus</i>,"Zhao, Tingting and Ma, Aijun and Yang, Shuangshuang and Huang, Zhihui",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.102937,"To gain insights into the influence of heat stress on lipid metabolism in juvenile turbot (Scophthalmus maximus), we analyzed the correlations between data obtained by transcriptome sequencing and metabolome sequencing of the kidney under different high temperature stimuli (20 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 28 degrees C) and control conditions (14 degrees C). We identified the differentially expressed genes and metabolites, which were found to be enriched in seven pathways (steroid hormone biosynthesis, primary bile acid biosynthesis, glycerophospholipid metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, glycerolipid metabolism and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids) associated with lipid metabolism, according to KEGG pathway analysis. After correlation analysis of these differentially expressed genes, the most representative genes (lpcat2, Etnk1, TAZ, SCP2, ch25hl and gpd1l) and metabolites (citicoline, UPD-6-sulfoquinovose, dihydroxyacetone, taurine and o-phosphocholine) were selected according to their correlation coefficients. These genes and metabolites were found to be the key points to regulate lipid deposition and maintain lipid homeostasis through varying degrees of up-regulation or downregulation under heat stress, so as to relieve the disorder of lipid metabolism caused by heat stress, which is of great significance for breeding new heat-resistant varieties of turbot and provides a reliable theoretical basis for optimizing actual production. These results provide new clues for understanding the roles of lipid metabolism in fish under heat stress.",2021,99,NA,NA
Temporal patterns of cardiac performance and genes encoding heat shock proteins and metabolic sensors of an intertidal limpet <i>Cellana toreuma</i> during sublethal heat stress,"Zhang, Shu and Han, Guo-dong and Dong, Yun-wei",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2014.02.003,"Intertidal invertebrates develop effective physiological adaptations to cope with the rapidly changing thermal environment in the intertidal zone. In the present study, the temporal patterns of heart rate, protein carbonyl groups, and genes encoding heat shock proteins (hsp70 and hsp90) and metabolic sensors (ampka, ampk beta and sirt1) were measured to study the effect of sublethal heat stress on the cardiac function, oxidative stress, heat shock response and cellular metabolism of an intertidal limpet Cellana toreuma. All the physiological parameters are sensitive to temperature and duration of heat stress. Spearman correlation analysis revealed that the correlations between heart rate and levels of heat shock proteins mRNA and metabolic sensors mRNA were statistically significant. These results further suggest that cardiac function plays crucial roles in cellular energy metabolism and heat shock responses. The significant increase of protein carbonyl groups at 34 degrees C after 4 h exposure indicated that the failure of cardiac function and the increase of anaerobic metabolism partly leads to the increase of protein carbonyl groups. Generally, the physiological responses to heat stress are sensitive to temperature and are energy-consumptive, as indicated by the upregulation of metabolic sensors mRNA. However, the upregulation of heat shock proteins and metabolic sensors at the post-transcriptional level and related functions need to be confirmed in further experiments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated the developmental, survival and reproductive traits of H. axyridis when its eggs were exposed to 25 (control), 37, 39 and 41 degrees C for 1 h, and then transferred to ambient condition (25 degrees C). The effects of heat stress on the hatching success greatly differed among temperature treatments. No H. axyridis larvae hatched out at 41 degrees C. The development, survival, weight, reproduction and longevity of H. axyridis exhibited significant differences with temperature treatment and gender. The survival rate of immatures declined, while the adult fresh weight of both sexes markedly increased with the increase of temperature. Heat exposure of the eggs caused a subsequent reduction in longevity, oviposition period and reproduction, while the pre-oviposition period became longer as the temperature increased. These may imply that the reproductive investment increased in higher level stressful environments, and the response of adult individuals could be linked to the experiences from early stages of the life history. Our findings provide useful information for predicting population dynamics and understanding the potential for H. axyridis as a biological control agent under variable environments.

Broilers in the control group were raised at 22 degrees C and fed a basal diet, and broilers in the other two groups were raised under cyclic HS (34 degrees C from 9:00 to 17:00 and at 22 degrees C for the rest of the time) and fed the basal diet with or without 1000 mg/kg GE. Supplementation of GE improved (P < 0.05) final body weight, average daily gain and feed conversion ratio of broilers under HS, and tended (P < 0.1) to increase breast muscle yield. The alterations of serum total protein, albumin, total cholesterol levels and aspartate aminotransferase activity under HS were reversed (P < 0.05) by GE, which also decreased (P < 0.05) serum triglyceride level and alanine aminotransferase activity. The decreased redness (a{*} value) and increased drip loss of breast muscle induced by HS were restored (P < 0.05) by GE. Moreover, GE supplementation increased (P < 0.05) total antioxidant capacity and decreased (P < 0.05) malondialdehyde content in liver and breast muscle, and increased (P < 0.05) glutathione peroxidase activity in serum and breast muscle.

Male Mediterranean fruit flies prefer warmer temperatures that improve sexual performance,"Weldon, Christopher W. and Terblanche, John S. and Bosua, Henrika and Malod, Kevin and Chown, Steven L.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103298,"Females and males have divergent strategies of energy investment, so the thermal preference of each sex in insects may differ because energetic conversion of metabolic reserves is dependent on temperature. We determined the thermal preference of virgin, sexually mature Mediterranean fruit flies, Ceratitis capitata, and found that males preferred a significantly higher temperature (23.8 +/- 0.3 degrees C) than that of females (22.1 +/- 0.3 degrees C). We then tested predictions for the difference in thermal preference related to the energetic demands of reproduction over a range of temperatures. The frequency and duration of calling bouts by male C. capitata were optimal at 26 degrees C. Mating propensity and latency, and copula duration, were optimal over the range of 22-28 degrees C. When mating occurred, temperature had little effect on the incidence of sperm storage by females, but there was a notable decline in the number stored at 28 degrees C. Female lifespan was highest at 18 degrees C, but lifetime egg production was optimal at 24 degrees C. These results illustrate temperature-related differences in the reproductive fitness of the sexes in C. capitata, although the optima for male traits align best with their thermal preference. They also support the theoretical prediction that insect thermal preference should be lower than the optimum for fitness.",2022,108,NA,NA

When L. maculatus was exposed to acute cold stress for 24 h, the gill showed curling, lamellar disorganization, lamellar epithelium hyperplasia, and formed aneurysms inside of the secondary lamellae. Long term stress over four days resulted in severe lamellar epithelium hyperplasia and curling. Continued extreme cold exposure (4 degrees C) in L. maculatus caused liver HK, PK levels and LDH activities to achieve a peak value at 0 h, and decreased over time. These indicated that glucose metabolism might play critical roles in the initial time of stress. Results of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism showed that lipids appear to play roles in prolonged cold stress. The constitutive transcriptional levels of six genes related to glucose (G6Pase) and lipid metabolism (PPAR-alpha, PPAR-gamma) and mTOR signal pathway (eif4ebp1, eif4ebp2, mlst8) genes increased significantly in most groups during cold stress.",2022,104,NA,NA
Metabolic readjustment in juvenile South African abalone (<i>Haliotis midae</i>) acclimated to combinations of temperature and dissolved oxygen levels,"Vosloo, Dalene and Vosloo, Andre and Morillion, Elisabeth J. and Samuels, Jessika N. and Sommer, Paula",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2013.07.001,"When ectotherms are exposed to high temperatures, cellular oxygen demand increases.

In the current study, we aimed to assess if oxidative or thermal restrictions exist when winter-acclimated Haliotis midae juveniles are re-acclimated to temperatures within their thermal tolerance range, but with one temperature outside the average daily temperatures they would experience in winter. At each acclimation temperature (14, 16 and 19 degrees C), we also manipulated dissolved oxygen levels to obtain oxygen saturation levels of 82\%, 98\% and 126\%. Our results indicate growth restrictions and hypometabolism at all oxygen treatments at 19 degrees C. Efficiency of mitochondrial respiration, as indicated by an increase in cytochrome c oxidase subunits 1 and 2 (cox1 and cox2) transcript level, was improved at 19 degrees C, 98\% oxygen. A change in substrate utilisation, from a glycogen/lipid-driven metabolism to almost exclusively protein-driven metabolism provided the fuel for more effective cellular respiration. A further decrease in metabolic rate at 19 degrees C, 126\% oxygen, this time without an increase in cox1 and cox2 transcripts, may indicate some improvement in gas exchange, but without improvement in growth. We propose that 19 degrees C is nearing a long-term limiting temperature for winter-acclimated SA abalone, and that animals survive this condition by re-allocating available energy to survival mechanisms instead of growth. This species, already threatened by over-harvesting, may be further threatened by increases in surface seawater temperatures. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2013,38,7,458-466
Thermal preferences of subtropical <i>Aedes aegypti</i> and temperate <i>Ae</i>. <i>japonicus</i> mosquitoes,"Verhulst, Niels O. and Brendle, Alexsandra and Blanckenhorn, Wolf U. and Mathis, Alexander",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102637,"Temperature is an important determinant affecting the capacity of disease vectors like mosquitoes (Culicidae) to transmit disease agents. Although the impact of temperature on vector-borne disease dynamics has been studied intensively, the actual temperature encountered by the vector in a heterogeneous landscape is rarely taken into account. If disease vectors have temperature preferences and therefore select specific microhabitats, this would substantially influence key life history traits that determine transmission intensity. The thermal preferences of subtropical Aedes aegypti and temperate Ae. japonicus mosquitoes were investigated in a temperature gradient setup consisting of a Plexiglas box on top of an aluminium plate on two thermal regulators. Blood-fed (one day after feeding) and unfed (non-blood-fed) mosquitoes were released in small (15-20 degrees C, 20-25 degrees C, 25-30 degrees C) and large (15-30 degrees C, 30-45 degrees C) temperature gradients to assess their thermal preferences after 15 min. Additionally, the effect of humidity was investigated in a two-choice chamber setup. Both mosquito species avoided higher temperatures, pronouncedly dangerously high temperatures in the 30-45 degrees C gradient. At lower temperatures, blood-fed mosquitoes preferred the cooler sides of the 20-25 degrees C and 25-30 degrees C gradient, which were all below their rearing temperature. In the lowest gradient of 15-20 degrees C, no preferences were found. The thermal preference of unfed mosquitoes was similar to that of the blood-fed mosquitoes. No humidity preference or effect of humidity on temperature preferences was observed within the tested range (40-90\%). The set-up allows for assessing the thermal preference of mosquitoes under controlled conditions. The observed preference of mosquitoes for cooler temperatures would increase their longevity and slow down pathogen development. If similar micmhabitat selection is observed in the field, vector borne disease models should be adjusted accordingly.",2020,91,NA,NA

Thermal stress alters mussel physiology highlighting the adaptive capacity that allows survival in the face of heatwaves. Within this study, adult mussels were subjected to three different seawater temperature regimes: 1) low (sustained 18 degrees C), 2) medium MHW (18-24 degrees C, using a +1 degrees C per week ramp) and 3) high MHW (18-24 degrees C, using a +2 degrees C per week ramp). Sampling was performed over 11 weeks to establish the effects of temperature on P. canaliculus survival, condition, specific immune response parameters, and the haemolymph metabolome. A transient 25.5-26.5 degrees C exposure resulted in 61 \% mortality, with surviving animals showing a metabolic adjustment within aerobic energy production, enabling the activation of molecular defence mechanisms. Utilisation of immune functions were seen within the cytology results where temperature stress affected the percentage of superoxide-positive haemocytes and haemocyte counts. From the metabolomics results an increase in antioxidant metabolites were seen in the high MHW survivors, possibly to counteract molecular damage. In the high MHW exposure group, mussels utilised anaerobic metabolism in conjunction with aerobic metabolism to produce energy, to uphold biological functions and survival. The effect of exposure time was mainly seen on very long-, and long chain fatty acids, with increases observed at weeks seven and eight. These changes were likely due to the membrane storage functions of fatty acids, with decreases at week eleven attributed to energy metabolism functions. This study supports the use of integrated analytical tools to investigate the response of marine organisms to heatwaves. Indeed, specific metabolic pathways and cellular markers are now highlighted for future investigations aimed at targeted measures.

Results showed that HS increased the core body temperature (CBT) and rectal temperature of broilers compared to the TNZ condition. The CBT and mean CBT decreased by similar to 0.5? in TNZ + L-Cit broilers compared to the TNZ + Control group (P < 0.05). L-Cit supplementation at TNZ significantly (P < 0.05) lowered the plasma malondialdehyde content but this was increased during HS. Exposure to HS significantly (P < 0.05) elevated plasma malondialdehyde compared to TNZ condition. Plasma immunoglobulin A, G, and M were increased (P < 0.05) by TNZ + L-Cit compared to the TNZ + Control group. Plasma nitric oxide and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity was increased during HS, whereas the total and inducible NOS enzymes were decreased. In addition, L-Cit supplementation increased both the inducible and endothelial NOS isoforms (P < 0.05). The mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha, avian uncoupling protein, cytochrome C oxidase subunit 3, and ATP synthase F1 subunit beta (ATP5 beta) in the breast muscle were downregulated (P < 0.05) during HS. However, L-Cit supplementation upregulated the mitochondrial transcription factor A and during HS, L-Cit increased ATP5 beta expression similar to TNZ housed broilers. Therefore, this study demonstrates that dietary L-Cit can lower the body temperature, decrease lipid peroxidation and promote the immune status of broilers under thermoneutrality. Also, L-Cit would act to promote muscle ATP generation during heat stress in broilers.",2022,105,NA,NA
Thermal plasticity in the invasive south American tomato pinworm <i>Tuta absoluta</i> (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae),"Tarusikirwa, Vimbai L. and Mutamiswa, Reyard and English, Sinead and Chidawanyika, Frank and Nyamukondiwa, Casper",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102598,"South American tomato pinworm, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) is a devastating invasive global insect pest of tomato, Solanum lycopersicum (Solanaceae). In nature, pests face multiple overlapping environmental stressors, which may significantly influence survival. To cope with rapidly changing environments, insects often employ a suite of mechanisms at both acute and chronic time-scales, thereby improving fitness at sub-optimal thermal environments. For T. absoluta, physiological responses to transient thermal variability remain under explored. Moreso, environmental effects and physiological responses may differ across insect life stages and this can have implications for population dynamics. Against this background, we investigated short and long term plastic responses to temperature of T. absoluta larvae (4th instar) and adults (24-48 h old) from field populations. We measured traits of temperature tolerance vis critical thermal limits {[}critical thermal minima (CTmin) and maxima (CTmax)], heat knockdown time (HKDT), chill coma recovery time (CCRT) and supercooling points (SCP). Our results showed that at the larval stage, Rapid Cold Hardening (RCH) significantly improved CTmin and HKDT but impaired SCP and CCRT. Heat hardening in larvae impaired CTmin, CCRT, SCP, CTmax but not HKDT. In adults, both heat and cold hardening generally impaired CTmin and CTmax, but had no effects on HKDT, SCP and CCRT. Low temperature acclimation significantly improved CTmin and HKDT while marginally compromising CCRT and CTmax, whereas high temperature acclimation had no significant effects on any traits except for HKDT in larvae. Similarly, low and high temperature acclimation had no effects on CTmin, SCPs and CTmax, while high temperature acclimation significantly compromised adult CCRT. Our results show that larvae are more thermally plastic than adults and can shift their thermal tolerance in short and long timescales. The larval plasticity reported here could be advantageous in new envirnments, suggesting an asymmetrical ecological role of larva relative to adults in facilitating T. absoluta invasion.",2020,90,NA,NA
A simulated heat wave-but not herbicide exposure-alters resource investment strategy in an insect,"Stahlschmidt, Z. R. and Choi, J. and Choy, B. and Perez, P. L. and Whitlock, J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103670,"Animals are increasingly exposed to potential stressors related to environmental change, and multiple stressors may alter the dynamics by which animals acquire resources and invest those resources into important life-history traits. Stress may lead to the prioritization of current reproduction to maximize lifetime reproduction (i.e., terminal investment {[}TI]) or, in contrast, prioritize somatic investment over current reproduction to facilitate future reproductive opportunities (i.e., reproductive restraint {[}RR]). Tests of the TI and RR hypotheses typically use immune challenges as stressors, and have not been explicitly tested in the context of environmental change even though warming influences resource allocation patterns across taxa. Further, the multiple-stressor framework has been a useful construct to clarify the costs of complex environmental shifts to animals, but it has not been leveraged to understand such effects on investment strategy. Thus, we tested the TI and RR hypotheses by manipulating widespread features of environmental change-glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH; Roundup \& REG;) exposure and a simulated heat wave-in the variable field cricket (Gryllus lineaticeps). A simulated heat wave affected the life-history tradeoff between investment into reproduction and soma. Specifically, heat wave prioritized investment into ovary mass over non-reproductive tissue, even after accounting for food consumption, in support of the TI hypothesis. In contrast, GBH exposure did not affect any measured trait, and crickets did not discriminate between tap water and GBH solution during drinking. Therefore, some-but not all-aspects of environmental change may alter resource investment strategies in animals. We encourage continued integration of the multiple-stressor framework and life-history theory to better understand how animals respond to their rapidly changing environments.",2023,116,NA,NA
Demographic responses of <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) to different temperatures in soft wheat flour,"Skourti, Anna and Kavallieratos, Nickolas G. and Papanikolaou, Nikos E.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103162,"The red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) is one of the most dangerous insects of a wide spectrum of stored products around the globe. The population growth of this species is affected by temperature. However, there are no data on comparative demographic parameters (i.e., net reproductive rate, intrinsic rate of increase, finite rate of increase, mean generation time and doubling time) in different temperatures, parameters that allow the in-depth exploration of its survival, mortality and reproduction patterns. This study evaluated egg-to-adult development, adult mortality and female fecundity on white soft wheat flour at 20, 25, 30 and 32.5 degrees C. The net reproductive rate increased from 0.08 females/female at 20 degrees C to 11.77 females/female at 25 degrees C and 102.07 females/female at 30 degrees C, followed by a decrease to 10.73 females/female at 32.5 degrees C. The lowest values of the intrinsic rate of increase and the finite rate of increase were observed at 20 degrees C (- 0.0105 females/female/day and 0.9895, respectively) and the highest at 30 degrees C (0.0348 females/female/day and 1.0354, respectively). While the mean generation time did not differ significantly between 20 and 25 degrees C (249.9 and 225.5 days, respectively), this decreased to 132.8 and 115.1 days at 30 and 32.5 degrees C, respectively. The value of the doubling time was negative at 20 degrees C (- 67.5 days), increased to 19.9, 34.0 and 63.9 days at 30, 32.5 and 25 degrees C, respectively. Using the non-linear Briere model, the lower threshold for T. castaneum population increase was estimated to be 22.2 degrees C, the upper threshold at 33.2 degrees C, and the temperature for maximum growth rate was 30.1 degrees C. Survival analysis indicated that temperature also affected the mortality risk of T. castaneum. The mean survival time increased from 112.1 days at 20 degrees C to 462.4 days at 25 degrees C, followed by a decrease to 206.5 and 64.5 days at 30 and 32.5 degrees C, respectively.

Beneficial developmental acclimation in reproductive performance under cold but not heat stress,"Simoes, Pedro and Santos, Marta A. and Carromeu-Santos, Ana and Quina, Ana S. and Santos, Mauro and Matos, Margarida",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102580,"Thermal plasticity can help organisms coping with climate change. In this study, we analyse how laboratory populations of the ectotherm species Drosophila subobscura, originally from two distinct latitudes and evolving for several generations in a stable thermal environment (18 degrees C), respond plastically to new thermal challenges. We measured adult performance (fecundity traits as a fitness proxy) of the experimental populations when exposed to five thermal regimes, three with the same temperature during development and adulthood (15-15 degrees C, 18-18 degrees C, 25-25 degrees C), and two where flies developed at 18 degrees C and were exposed, during adulthood, to either 15 degrees C or 25 degrees C. Here, we test whether (1) flies undergo stress at the two more extreme temperatures; (2) development at a given temperature enhances adult performance at such temperature (i.e. acclimation), and (3) populations with different biogeographical history show plasticity differences. Our findings show (1) an optimal performance at 18 degrees C only if flies were subjected to the same temperature as juveniles and adults; (2) the occurrence of developmental acclimation at lower temperatures; (3) detrimental effects of higher developmental temperature on adult performance; and (4) a minor impact of historical background on thermal response. Our study indicates that thermal plasticity during development may have a limited role in helping adults cope with warmer - though not colder - temperatures, with a potential negative impact on population persistence under climate change. It also emphasizes the importance of analysing the impact of temperature on all stages of the life cycle to better characterize the thermal limits.",2020,90,NA,NA
Altered thyroid hormone levels affect the capacity for temperature-induced developmental plasticity in larvae of <i>Rana temporaria</i> and <i>Xenopus laevis</i>,"Ruthsatz, Katharina and Dausmann, Kathrin H. and Drees, Claudia and Becker, I, Laura and Hartmann, Lisa and Reese, Janica and Reinhardt, Steffen and Robinson, Tom and Sabatino, Nikita M. and Peck, Myron A. and Glos, Julian",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102599,"Anuran larvae show phenotypic plasticity in age and size at metamorphosis as a response to temperature variation. The capacity for temperature-induced developmental plasticity is determined by the thermal adaptation of a population. Multiple factors such as physiological responses to changing environmental conditions, however, might influence this capacity as well. In anuran larvae, thyroid hormone (TH) levels control growth and developmental rate and changes in TH status are a well-known stress response to sub-optimal environmental conditions. We investigated how chemically altered TH levels affect the capacity to exhibit temperature-induced developmental plasticity in larvae of the African clawed frog (Xenopus ktevis) and the common frog (Rana ternporaria). In both species, TH level influenced growth and developmental rate and modified the capacity for temperature-induced developmental plasticity. High TH levels reduced thermal sensitivity of metamorphic traits up to 57\% (R. temporaria) and 36\% (X. laevis). Rates of growth and development were more plastic in response to temperature in X. laevis (+30\%) than in R. temporaria (+6\%). Plasticity in rates of growth and development is beneficial to larvae in heterogeneous habitats as it allows a more rapid transition into the juvenile stage where rates of mortality are lower. Therefore, environmental stressors that increase endogenous TH levels and reduce temperature-dependent plasticity may increase risks and the vulnerability of anuran larvae. As TH status also influences metabolism, future studies should investigate whether reductions in physiological plasticity also increases the vulnerability of tadpoles to global change.",2020,90,NA,NA

However, thermal tolerance is not a static trait and may be influenced by a number of environmental and organismal factors. We report the results of three experiments investigating the effects of environmental temperature, exposure duration, age, sex, and nutrient availability on the upper thermal tolerance of the adult secondary screwworm, Cochliomyia macellaria. The probability of knockdown and survival was determined using a static method for different environmental temperatures (22, 40, 42, 44, or 45 degrees C), exposure durations (1, 2, 4, or 6 h), and nutrient availabilities (no food or water, water only, or both food and water) for both sexes and two age classes (young = 7-9 days post pupal emergence, old = 10-12 days post pupal emergence). In general, environmental temperature and exposure duration had the greatest effects on both the probability of knockdown and survival. As temperature or duration increased, the probability of knockdown increased while the probability of survival decreased. The availability of nutrients (water only or food and water) increased thermal tolerance at moderate temperatures (42 and 44 degrees C), but had no effect at 45 degrees C. Female flies were more thermally tolerant than males, regardless of nutrient availability. And age exhibited negligible effects on the probabilities of knockdown or survival, regardless of nutrient availability. These data show multiple environmental factors affected the thermal tolerance of C. macellaria. Thus, such aspects of basic thermal biology should feature more prominently in applied fields using blow flies, including but not limited to forensic entomology, disease ecology, and pollination ecology.",2019,85,NA,NA
Effects of constant and fluctuating incubation temperatures on hatching success and hatchling traits in the diamondback terrapin (<i>Malaclemys terrapin</i>) in the context of the warming climate,"Rowe, Christopher L. and Liang, Dong and Woodland, Ryan J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102528,"As global temperatures continue to rise, so too will the nest temperatures of many species of turtles. Yet for most turtle species, including the estuarine diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin), there is limited information on embryonic sensitivity to elevated temperature. We incubated eggs of M. terrapin at three, mean temperatures (31, 34, 37 degrees C) under two thermal exposure regimes (constant or semi-naturally fluctuating temperature) and measured hatching success, developmental rate, and hatchling size. Hatching success was 100\% at 31 degrees C and 67\% at 34 degrees C, respectively; at 37 degrees C, all eggs failed early in the incubation period. These values were unaffected by exposure regime. The modeled LT50 (temperature that was lethal to 50\% of the test population) was 34.0 degrees C in the constant and 34.2 degrees C in the fluctuating thermal regime, reflecting a steep decline in survival between 33 and 35 degrees C. Hatchlings having been incubated at a constant 34 degrees C hatched sooner than those incubated at 31 degrees C under either constant or fluctuating temperature. Hatchlings were smaller in straight carapace length (CL) and width after having been incubated at 34 degrees C compared to 31 degrees C. Larger (CL) hatchlings resulted from fluctuating temperature conditions relative to constant temperature conditions, regardless of mean temperature. Based upon recent temperatures in natural nests, the M. terrapin population studied here appears to possess resiliency to several degrees of elevated mean nest temperatures, beyond which, embryonic mortality will likely sharply increase. When considered within the mosaic of challenges that Maryland's M. terrapin face as the climate warms, including ongoing habitat losses due to sea level rise and impending thermal impacts on bioenergetics and offspring sex ratios, a future increase in embryonic mortality could be a critical factor for a population already experiencing ecological and physiological challenges due to climate change.",2020,88,NA,NA

Despite an abundance of research devoted to studying rootworm biology in the central Corn Belt of the United States, key aspects on their thermal ecology are still lacking. Here we address this knowledge gap by measuring critical thermal limits, knock-down resistance, and chill coma recovery. In doing so, we also address methodological questions sur-rounding measurements of thermal tolerance using a variety of dynamic and static assays. The average critical thermal maxima across all trials was 43.0 degrees C, while the average critical thermal minima was 2.5 degrees C. Critical thermal limits were relatively invariant across all treatments except at faster ramping rates. Knock-down resis-tance decreased with increasing temperature as survival dropped from 100\% at 39 degrees C to 0\% within 10 min at 44 degrees C. Recovery from chill coma increased by 1.62 min for each hour of exposure at 0 degrees C, while survival decreased by 50\% after only 24 h.

The capacity of ectotherms, such as lizards, to maintain their body temperature within their preferred range influences physiological traits such as speed, various reproductive patterns, and critical fitness components, such as growth rates or survival. Here, we evaluate the influence of temperature on locomotor performance, sperm morphology and viability in a high elevation lizard species (Sceloporus aeneus). Whereas maximal values for sprint speed coincides with field active and preferred body temperature, short-term exposure at the same range of temperatures produces abnormalities in sperm morphology, lower sperm concentration and diminishes sperm motility and viability. In conclusion, we confirmed that although locomotor performance is maximized at preferred temperatures, there is a trade-off with male reproductive attributes, which may cause infertility. As a consequence, prolonged exposure to preferred temperatures could threaten the persistence of the species through reduced fertility. Persistence of the species is favored in environments with access to cooler, thermal micro -habitats that enhance reproductive parameters.",2023,113,NA,NA

We used a central composite experimental design and response surface methodology. The experimental ranges were 18-36 degrees C for T and 0-24 h for Pp. The results show that the quadratic effects of T and Pp were highly significant for serum E-2 and P contents, GSI, and the ratio of stage III to stage II oocytes (P < 0.01), and that the linear effects of T and Pp were also significant for these indicators (P < 0.05). The T x Pp interaction significantly affected serum E-2 content (P < 0.05). Serum E-2 and P content, GSI, and the ratio of stage III to stage II oocytes increased and then decreased with increasing T or Pp. The best combination of T and Pp for egg development was 28.6 degrees C/14.29 h. We observed the part of ovarian tissue containing stage V oocytes that are about to be discharged. Shortening the photoperiod or lowering the water temperature delayed the development of ovarian tissue so that most oocytes remained at stage II, and there were many atretic follicles.

Differential effects of water loss and temperature increase on the physiology of fiddler crabs from distinct habitats.,"Principe, Silas C. and Augusto, Alessandra and Costa, Tania Marcia",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.02.004,"Temperature is one of the main environmental constraints to organism distribution, affecting physiology and survival. Organisms that inhabit the intertidal zone are exposed to temperature variation and, with climate change, they should face different conditions which include higher temperatures, leading to higher rates of water loss through evaporation and then fitness reduction or mortality. Here we tested the effects of desiccation and increased temperature in two fiddler crabs species that occupy distinct habitats in regard to vegetation cover and position on the intertidal zone and thus may respond differently to these stressors. Leptuca thayeri, which is restricted to the mid-tide zone and vegetated areas, had higher desiccation and mortality rates than Minuca rapax, a generalist species, when exposed to desiccation for 120 min. Also, compared to M. rapax, L. thayeri had a more permeable carapace. Temperature elevation of 10 degrees C and 20 degrees C for 72 h caused no mortality in either species. However, there were changes in hemolymph osmolality and muscle hydration in both species. Leptuca thayeri osmolality was low in the intermediate temperature, suggesting that at this temperature this species has a better salt secretion capability. Minuca rapax, however, had an increase in hemolymph osmolality at the highest temperatures with no LDH increase, which indicates that osmotic control in this species is more sensitive to temperature increase. Our results show that L. thayeri suffers more from desiccation, due to a more permeable carapace. However, because of this higher permeability L. thayeri is capable of lowering its temperature more than M. rapax. As temperature elevation produces great physiological changes in M. rapax, a reduced ability to keep a low temperature can be an issue for this species if temperature increases. However, higher water loss to keep body temperature low may decrease L. thayeri survivability in the same scenario.",2018,73,NA,14-23

From a physiological standpoint, higher temperatures often enhance biological processes that can induce the production of reactive oxygen species and result in a state of cellular oxidative stress. Temperature alters interspecific interactions, including species hybridization. Hybridization under different thermal conditions could amplify parental (genetic) incompatibilities, thus affecting a hybrid's development and distribution. Understanding the impact of global warming on the physiology of hybrids and particularly their oxidative status could help in predicting future scenarios in ecosystems and in hybrids. In the present study, we investigated the effect of water temperature on the development, growth and oxidative stress of two crested newt species and their reciprocal hybrids. Larvae of Triturus macedonicus and T. ivanbureschi, and their T. macedonicus-mothered and T. ivanbureschi-mothered hybrids were exposed for 30 days to temperatures of 19 degrees C and 24 degrees C. Under the higher temperature, the hybrids experienced increases in both growth and developmental rates, while parental species exhibited accelerated growth (T. macedonicus) or development (T. ivanbureschi). Warm conditions also had different effects on the oxidative status of hybrid and parental species. Parental species had enhanced antioxidant responses (catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione Stransferase and SH groups), which allowed them to alleviate temperature-induced stress (revealed by the absence of oxidative damage). However, warming induced an antioxidant response in the hybrids, including oxidative damage in the form of lipid peroxidation. These findings point to a greater disruption of redox regulation and metabolic machinery in hybrid newts, which can be interpreted as the cost of hybridization that is likely linked to parental incompatibilities expressed under a higher temperature.

Repeated thermal conditioning during the neonatal period affects behavioral and physiological responses to acute heat stress in chicks,"Ouchi, Yoshimitsu and Tanizawa, Hiroshi and Shiraishi, Jun-ichi and Cockrem, John F. and Chowdhury, Vishwajit S. and Bungo, Takashi",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102759,"Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of repeated thermal conditioning (RTC) at an early age on physiological and behavioral responses in chicks. Methods: Birds were assigned to one of the four treatments in which the RTC was exposure to 40 degrees C for 15 min daily. The treatments were 1) no thermal conditioning (control); 2) early exposure group (EE; RTC from 2 to 4 days of age); 3) later exposure group (LE; RTC from 5 to 7 days of age); or 4) both early and later exposure (BE; RTC from 2 to 7 days of age). All groups of chicks were challenged with high ambient temperature (40 degrees C for 15 min) at two weeks of age. Results: During heat challenge, initiation times of dissipation behaviors (panting and wing-drooping) were measured. Rectal temperature and respiration rate were measured after and before heat challenge. Hypothalamic samples and blood were collected at the end of heat challenges. Initiation times of dissipation behaviors and rectal temperature were not affected by the treatments. Increases in respiration rate in response to heat challenge were suppressed by early RTC treatment. There was no clear pattern of glucose levels in relation to thermal conditioning, whereas plasma corticosterone levels were decreased by early treatment (EE and BE groups). Hypothalamic thyrotropin releasing hormone gene expression was suppressed by early and later thermal conditioning and suppressed further by both early and later exposure. Neuropeptide Y gene expression in the BE group was lower than in the other groups, with a similar trend for corticotropin releasing hormone expression. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the effect of repeated thermal conditioning on the central thermoregulatory system depends on the number of times that chicks experienced conditioning. In addition, repeated thermal conditioning has greater effects on the acquisition of thermotolerance when conditioning occurs in chicks of two to four days of age in comparison with chicks of five to seven days of age.",2020,94,NA,NA

The results showed that freezing led to a significant rise in the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and carbonyl groups (CG) in brain, liver and kidney tissues. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) increased significantly in brain and liver tissues with an augmentation of total antioxidant capacity (TAOC). Apparent increments in muscle SOD activity and liver GST activity were also observed during freezing exposure. Vitamin C content significantly decreased in liver and kidney but a significant increase occurred in brain. Activities of non-specific immune enzymes, acid phosphatase (ACP) and alkaline phosphatase (AKP), were also assessed. ACP activity was significantly reduced in all five tissues tested whereas AKP activity decreased significantly in four tissues but rose in brain. In summary, freezing is accompanied by oxidative stress in the highaltitude frog, N. parkeri, as documented by increases in the content of MDA and CG in tissues. Freezing exposure also induced tissue-specific changes in the antioxidant defenses showing that activation of antioxidant systems is a part of the survival strategy of this in a high-altitude frog during freezing.

With the temperature being a reliable indicator of the seasonal changes, an attempt to explore the variations in the life history strategies of the pest snail Allopeas gracile (Hutton, 1834) (Gastropoda: Subulinidae) was carried out under four constant temperature grades - 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 30 degrees C and 35 degrees C (+/- 1 degrees C) temperatures throughout with laboratory temperature as controlled environment. The snail A. gracile was unable to complete their life cycle at 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C, without reaching reproductive maturity. In contrast, A. gracile maintained at laboratory temperatures (range 25-29 degrees C) exhibited long life span, longer reproductive period and longer generation time. However, the reproductive rate was highest at temperature 30 degrees C. Perhaps, the warmer environment facilitated rapid growth, fast onset of reproduction with larger body size at early age. At a constant higher temperature of 35 degrees C a state of inactivation was imposed when growth and reproduction became static. Apparently, the expression of the life history traits of A. gracile was supportive of an invasive nature, at a temperature ranging between 25 degrees C and 35 degrees C.",2022,108,NA,NA
Transcriptomic response of the intertidal limpet<i> Patella</i><i> vulgata</i> to temperature extremes,"Moreira, Catarina and Stillman, Jonathon H. and Lima, Fernando P. and Xavier, Raquel and Seabra, Rui and Gomes, Filipa and Verissimo, Ana and Silva, Sofia Marques",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103096,"Global warming is challenging wild species in land and water. In the intertidal zone, species are already living at their thermal limits, being vulnerable even to small increases in maximum habitat temperatures. Knowledge of the mechanisms by which many intertidal zone species cope with elevated temperatures is limited. We analysed the molecular thermal stress response of the limpet Patella vulgata under slight and frequent (one-day), and extreme and rare (three-day) warming events. Using RNA-seq to assess differential gene expression among treatments, differing molecular responses were obtained in the two treatments, with more changes in gene expression after the three-day event; with one-third of the differentially expressed transcripts being down regulated. However, across treatments we observed shifts in gene expression for common aspects of the heat stress response including intra-cellular communication, protein chaperoning, proteolysis and cell cycle arrest. Of the 71,675 transcripts obtained, only 259 were differentially expressed after both heating events. From these, 218 defined the core group (i.e. genes induced by thermal stress with similar expression patterns irrespective of the magnitude of the warming event). The core group was composed of already well-studied genes in heat stress responses in intertidal organisms (e.g. heat shock proteins), but also genes from less explored metabolic pathways, e.g. the ubiquitin system, which were also fundamental regardless of the magnitude of the imposed warming. Moreover, we have also identified 41 signaling genes (i.e. a set of genes responding to both events and with expression patterns specific to the intensity of thermal stress), principally including genes involved in the maintenance of extracellular structure that have previously not been identified as part of the response to thermal stress in intertidal zone organisms. These signaling genes will be useful heat stress molecular biomarkers for monitoring heat stress in natural populations.",2021,101,NA,NA
"Cooling rate and starvation affect supercooling point and cold tolerance of the Khapra beetle, <i>Trogoderma granarium</i> Everts fourth instar larvae (Coleoptera: Dermestidae)","Mohammadzadeh, M. and Izadi, H.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.10.007,"Trogoderma granarium Everts (Coleoptera: Dermestidae) is an important insect pest of stored products. In this study, the survival strategies of T. granarium fourth instar larvae were investigated at different sub-zero temperatures following different cooling rates, acclimation to different relative humidity (RH) and different starvation times. Our results show that larvae of T. granarium are freeze-intolerant. There was a strong link between cooling rates and supercooling point, which means the slower the decrease in temperature, the lower the supercooling point. Trehalose content was greater in insects cooled at a rate of 0.5 degrees C/min. According to results, the RH did not affect supercooling point. However, acclimation to an RH of 25\% increased mortality following exposure to - 10 degrees C/24 h. The time necessary to reach 95\% mortality was 1737 h and 428 h at - 5 degrees C and - 10 degrees C. The lowest lipid and trehalose content was detected in insects acclimated to 25\% RH, although, the different RH treatments did not significantly affect glycogen content of T. granarium larvae. The supercooling point of larvae was gradually increased following starvation. By contrast, fed larvae had the greatest lipid, glycogen, and trehalose content, and insects starved for eight days had the lowest energy contents. There was a sharp decline in the survival of larvae between 11 and - 18 degrees C after 1 h exposure. Our results indicate the effects of cooling rate and starvation on energy reserves and survival of T. granarium. We conclude that T. granarium may not survive under similar stress conditions of the stored products.",2018,71,NA,24-31

In this trial, we used six ruminal-cannulated Nellore females. The experimental design was a 6 x 6 Latin square, with six treatments and six periods. The research used a 2 x 2 + 2 factorial scheme. The arrangement comprised: two thermal conditions {[}thermoneutrality (TN; 21.6 degrees C) or heat stress (HS, 34 degrees C)]; two dietary energy levels (low or high-energy); and two additional treatments, with heifers exposed to the TN, but pair-fed with females exposed to HS (PFTN). For our purposes, body temperature, heart and respiratory rates were measured and the relative mRNA expression was quantified using the PCR-RT technique. Compared to TN or PFTN, the HS increased the body temperature measurements in the morning and evening (p < 0.04). Heart rate was 22\% greater for heifers under HS than for TN (p < 0.01) and 13\% higher for those under HS than PFTN (p = 0.03) in the morning. Respiratory rates increased with HS exposure compared to TN or PFTN (p < 0.01).

Its upper critical thermal limit is not well defined, especially when combined with extreme salinities. The cumulative mortalities of the progenies of wild C. virginica from four nGoM estuaries differing in mean annual salinity, acclimated to low (4.0), moderate (20.0), and high (36.0) salinities at 28.9 degrees C (84 degrees F) and exposed to increasing target temperatures of 33.3 degrees C (92 degrees F), 35.6 degrees C (96 degrees F) or 37.8 degrees C (100 degrees F), were measured over a three-week period. Oysters of all stocks were the most sensitive to increasing temperatures at low salinity, dying quicker (i.e., lower median lethal time, LT50) than at the moderate and high salinities and resulting in high cumulative mortalities at all target temperatures. Oysters of all stocks at moderate salinity died the slowest with high cumulative mortalities only at the two highest temperatures. The F1 oysters from the more southern and hyper saline Upper Laguna Madre estuary were generally more tolerant to prolonged higher temperatures (higher LT50) than stocks originating from lower salinity estuaries, most notably at the highest salinity. Using the measured temperatures oysters were exposed to, 3-day median lethal Celsius degrees (LD50) were estimated for each stock at each salinity. The lowest 3-day LD50 (35.1-36.0 degrees C) for all stocks was calculated at a salinity of 4.0, while the highest 3-day LD50 (40.1-44.0 degrees C) was calculated at a salinity of 20.0.",2021,100,NA,NA
HSP70 plays a role in the defense of acute and chronic heat stress in Mongolian gerbils (<i>Meriones unguiculatus</i>),"Lou, Shu-Lei and Zhang, Xue-Ying and Wang, De-Hua",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102452,"Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) show a wide thermal neutral zone (TNZ, 26.5-38.9 degrees C). Whether heat shock proteins (HSPs) are involved in thermal tolerance for gerbils has still been unknown. We investigated the effects of acute and chronic high temperature within and above TNZ on the expressions of HSP70 and HSP90 and oxidative status in Mongolian gerbils, to test the hypothesis that the gerbils need increase the expression in HSPs to defense the acute and chronic heat stress. In experiment I, 50 Mongolian gerbils were exposed to 23 degrees C, 27 degrees C, 37 degrees C, 40 degrees C and 43.5 degrees C for 80 min respectively, and then sacrificed 12 h after treatment. HSP70 expression in the liver increased at 40 degrees C compared to that at 23 degrees C, but did not change after 27 degrees C, 37 degrees C or 43.5 degrees C exposure. There were no differences in HSP90 expression, oxidative stress parameters such as malonaldehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), or antioxidant parameters such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in the liver. HSP70 and HSP90 expression both in the heart and brain showed no differences among groups. In experiment H, another set of 30 gerbils were acclimated to 23 degrees C, 27 degrees C and 37 degrees C for 21 days, respectively. During chronic acclimation, HSP70 expression increased and H2O2 level decreased in the liver in 37 degrees C group compared to other two groups. Both H2O2 and SOD in the brain decreased in 37 degrees C group, but there were no differences in HSP70, MDA or T-AOC in the brain. These data indicate that Mongolian gerbils can maintain basal levels of HSPs after acute exposure to temperatures within the wide TNZ, but rely on increased HSP70 in the liver to protect from heat damage at temperatures above TNZ and during chronic heat acclimation. The increased HSP70 expression in the liver may contribute to keeping from heat damage in desert rodents.",2019,86,NA,NA

However, their relationship in testes under oxidative stress is unclear. In this study, we conducted testes injection for autophagy alteration and heat exposure to reveal the interaction between autophagy and the Nrf2-antioxidant system. Male mice were injected once with normal saline as control (Cont group), autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA group) or autophagy inducer rapaihycin (Rapa group). Then, each group was divided into two parts: one received a 2-h 42 degrees C heat treatment for eight days (HT groups), and the other was kept thermal neutral (NT groups). Heat-exposed mice showed significantly increased rectal, scrotal surface and body surface temperatures. Histology of the testes revealed many vacuoles inserted in the seminiferous tubules in the HT Cont group and two 3-MA groups. Ultrastructural changes in germ cells revealed autophagosomes in two 3-MA groups. Immunohistochemical detection of Nrf2 and p62/SQSTM1 proteins showed prominent expression in Leydig cells. Heat exposure increased Nrf2 protein and mRNA levels. 3-MA and Rapa testes injection also resulted in Nrf2 cytoplasm accumulation. Massive conversion of LC3 (microtubule-associated protein light chain 3)1 to LC3II was detected in two 3-MA groups, accompanied by decreased ATG5 (autophagy related gene 5) mRNA levels in the HT 3-MA group. These results indicated autophagy alteration triggered the Nrf2 signaling pathway with consequences such that the autophagy inducer protected the testes and the autophagy inhibitor enhanced the detrimental effects caused by heat exposure.",2018,71,NA,142-152

Test fish with an initial body weight range of 17.60-18.78 g were reared in 5 independent recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) with three tanks (50 fish/tank) for 8 weeks. The water temperature of the RAS was set at 14 \& DEG;C, 18 \& DEG;C, 22 \& DEG;C, 26 \& DEG;C, and 30 \& DEG;C, respectively. At conclusion of the feeding trial, the effects of water temperature on C. guichenoti were analyzed based on survival, growth performance, digestive enzymes activities, and antioxidant capacity. The results showed that the fish survived in all temperature groups. The fish in the groups (26 \& DEG;C and 30 \& DEG;C) had higher values of body length, body weight, specific growth rate, weight gain rate, and daily gain than those in the group (22 \& DEG;C). The lowest values of growth performance were observed in the groups (14 \& DEG;C and 18 \& DEG;C) among the 5 groups. The lowest values of feed conversion ratio (FCR) were observed in the group (26 \& DEG;C). Regression analysis identified the minimum FCR at 26.55 \& DEG;C. The feeding rates (FR) were increased gradually with the increase of temperature. Regression analysis identified the maximum FR at 28.33 \& DEG;C. The activities of protease and lipase in the gut were higher than those in the liver, while amylase activity was lower in the gut than that in the liver. There were no significant differences in ac-tivities of protease and lipase among different parts of the intestinal tract at the temperatures range from 18 to 26 \& DEG;C. When the temperature was out the optimal range, C. guichenoti would be under chronic stress, resulting in decreased lysozyme activity and cortisol concentration. Inconclusion, the optimal temperature for juvenile C. guichenoti is 26.55-28.33 \& DEG;C based on the maximal growth performance and feed utilization.",2023,115,NA,NA

We investigated the geographical and physiological temperature limits of the Arctic fairy shrimp (Branchinecta paludosa), which is common in cold water arctic ponds, but at present retracts its range in alpine areas along its southern outreach of Norway. Seasonal logging of water temperatures along an altitudinal transect revealed an upper temperature limit of 12.7 degrees C for its presence, which closely matched a calculated upper temperature limit of 12.9 degrees C throughout its entire Norwegian range. Field data hence point to cold stenotherm features, which would be consistent with its Arctic, circumpolar distribution. Lab experiments, on the other hand, revealed a linear increase in respiration over 10-20 degrees C. When fed ad libitum somatic growth increased with temperature, as well, without negative physiological impacts of higher temperatures. The absence of Branchinecta paludosa in ponds warmer than 13 degrees C could still be due to a mismatch between temperature dependent metabolism and limited energy supply in these ultraoligotrophic water bodies. We discuss the concept of cold stenothermy in this context, and the impacts of regional warming on the future distribution of the Arctic fairy shrimp. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

So the thermal requirements, lower developmental threshold (t), thermal constant (K), upper developmental threshold (T-m) and optimum developmental temperature (T-o) for the egg-mummy, mummy-adult and egg-adult periods of A. maculatus were established under the laboratory conditions. The studies were conducted at five constant temperatures (13, 18, 23, 28, and 33 degrees C) and with a 16 L: 8D photo period. Lower developmental threshold (t) and thermal constant (K) were estimated by fitting linear model.

We determined the overall timing of the Drosophila pachea life-cycle at different temperatures. The duration of pupal development was similar at 25 degrees C, 29 degrees C and 32 degrees C, although the relative progress differed at particular stages.

Thermal tolerance of two Diptera that pollinate thermogenic plants,"Leclerc, Mathieu A.

Typically, such scenario occurs when flowers are exposed to solar radiation. The case of thermogenic flowers is particular because they warm up even when they are not exposed to solar energy. The flowers of Arum attract their pollinators with a deceptive method and trap them for a whole day, thereby imposing elevated temperature to visiting insects. Therefore, we predict a relatively high basal thermal tolerance in those insects. The aim of this study was to assess the thermal tolerance and warming tolerance of females of two fly species (genus Psychoda) pollinating Arum sp. (thermogenic plant). We measured their critical temper-ature (CTmax) and its response to rate of temperature increase as well as acclimation period to moderate temperature of 25 degrees C. We found relatively low CTmax (33.7 degrees C on average) for both species, and a weak response to acclimation period and ramping rate. In general, the thermal tolerance increased with a rapid ramping in temperature. To evaluate the warming tolerance, we compared thermal tolerance limits to flower temperatures measured in the field. We highlighted that the temperature of the thermogenic floral organ could reach values close to the thermal tolerance threshold of pollinators. This discovery raises questions about the sustainability of the interaction between these thermogenic plants and their pollinators.",2022,109,NA,NA

In addition, skin darkening was observed in fish acclimated with increasing temperatures. Fat content of whole-body, liver, and dorsal muscle of fish was decreased by increasing temperatures (P < 0.05). Higher temperature levels significantly increased in all blood parameters (P < 0.05), except for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, which was quadratically decreased (P = 0.004). Fish acclimated with increasing temperature also altered gill and liver histology such as gill shortening, hyperplasia and edema in the connective tissue, severe hyperplasia of epithelial cells, and desquamation, hepatocyte vacuolization, nuclei displacement, and pyknotic hepatic cells.

Data from the last 7 days were analyzed using a mixed procedure in SAS. In the study, the HTHH group displayed marked physiological and biochemical changes on 14 days of heat stress exposure compared to the LTLH group. Firstly, the HTHH group's dry matter intake decreased by approximately 12\% while their water intake increased by about 23\%. Secondly, both milk yield and milk protein production in the HTHH group decreased by 10\% and 20\%, respectively. Thirdly, there was a reduction in white blood cells, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and platelets in the HTHH group, with concurrent increases in glucose, non-esterified fatty acids, and albumin concentrations. Additionally, the HTHH group exhibited elevated plasma concentrations of cortisol and haptoglobin. Moreover, the gene expression of heat shock protein 70 and heat shock protein 90 was significantly upregulated in the HTHH group's peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Lastly, key physiological indicators such as rectal temperature, heart rate, and skin temperature showed substantial elevations in the HTHH group. Considering the enormous negative effects observed in the analyzed blood metabolites, milk yield and compositions, and heat shock protein gene expression, early lactating Holstein cows were found to be more vulnerable to HTHH than LTLH over a 7 days exposure to heat stress.",2024,123,NA,NA

Yet, developmental thermal acclimation can play an important role in shaping physiological, morphological, and behavioral traits at the adult stage. We explored how three rearing temperatures (10, 20, and 28 degrees C) affected host-foraging behaviors and associated traits under warm conditions in the parasitoid Aphidius colemani, a key model in behavioral ecology and an important natural enemy of aphids. Developmental time was longer at lower temperatures, resulting in bigger emerging parasitoids, with higher egg-loads. Parasitism rates, emergence rates, and parasitoid survival (once placed at high temperature) were the highest for parasitoids developed at 20 degrees C. When exposed to 28 degrees C, the expression of all behavioral items (time spent walking searching for hosts, number of antennal and ovipositor contacts with hosts) was higher for parasitoids reared at 20 degrees C, followed by those reared at 10 degrees C, then those reared at 28 degrees C. Finally, we showed that parasitoid residence time on aphid patches was determined by both developmental temperatures and the number of host encounter without oviposition, representative of the resource quality. We revealed that developing at 28 degrees C did not lead to increased adult performance at this temperature, probably because of complex interactions and trade-offs between developmental costs at high temperature and optimal foraging behaviors (e.g., parasitoid size and host-handling capacities). Our results strengthen the idea that thermal developmental plasticity may play an important role in insect behavioral responses to varying temperatures, and is important to consider in the context of climate change.",2022,103,NA,NA

First we use the equation proposed by lkemoto and Takai (2000) to determine the linear phase of development and then a generalised linear model having a different variance at low and high temperatures, specific for each condition, to estimate the parameters of the linear relationship. Using this method, we show that providing the difference in food quality is sufficiently great, an aphidophagous ladybird develops significantly faster and starts developing at a significantly lower temperature on a good than on a poor quality diet. Adaptive significance of the thermal constants not remaining constant is discussed in terms of a trade-off between growth and rate of development, when temperature and food quality varies.

"Hypoxia reduced upper thermal limits causing cellular and nuclear abnormalities of erythrocytes in Nile tilapia, <i>Oreochromis niloticus</i>","Islam, S. M.

Increased water temperature up-regulates oxygen consumption and metabolic rates, and alters the physiological processes. In this study, we identified the critical thermal maxima (CTmax) and physiological responses under normoxia and hypoxia in Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus. CTmax was 41.25 degrees C under hypoxia and 44.50 degrees C under normoxia. Compared to normoxia, lower values of hemoglobin (Hb) and red blood cells (RBCs) were observed at the CTmax under hypoxia. In contrast, higher values of white blood cells (WBCs) and blood glucose (Glu) levels were observed at the CTmax under hypoxia. Consequently, higher frequencies of micronucleus, cellular and nuclear abnormalities of erythrocytes were observed at the CTmax under hypoxia. These results suggest that high temperature tolerance and subsequent physiology are significantly affected by the oxygen supply in Nile tilapia. As climate vulnerability is intensifying day by day, this data will be helpful in successful management practice for the aquatic environment having low oxygen content.",2020,90,NA,NA

For this purpose, five hundred and forty apparently healthy O. niloticus were allocated into nine groups fed three DRLM-supplemented diets (0,1, and 3\%) and reared at three water temperature (18, 24, and 32 degrees C) in a 3 x 3 total randomized factorial design. The results revealed that exposure of fish to low (18 degrees C) or high (32 degrees C) temperatures for 30 days evoked significant growth retardation, depleted antioxidant enzymes activities (Catalase; CAT and super oxide dismutase; SOD), lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde; MDA), immunosuppression, altered cortisol level compared to those reared at 24 degrees C. Moreover, a marked down-regulation of oxidative stress related genes with up-regulation of interleukin 1 beta gene were apparent. In contrast, DRLM incorporation, particularly at 3\%, in heat or cold stressed fish diets significantly enhanced growth, restored IgM and lysozymes levels, and SOD and CAT activities. Also, both the MDA and cortisol levels were significantly depressed. Furthermore, both antioxidant and immune-related genes expression were significantly corrected. Conclusively, 3\% DRLM dietary supplementation in tilapia diet could be a promising strategy to alleviate the temperature stress-induced negative impacts on fish health and performance.",2019,84,NA,26-35

Mitochondrial metabolism and respiration adjustments following temperature acclimation in<i> Daphnia</i><i> magna</i>,"Hoffschroer, Nadine and Laspoumaderes, Cecilia and Zeis, Bettina and Tremblay, Nelly",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103761,"Seasonal temperature changes and local variations in the water column challenge lentic zooplankton in their habitat. At the cellular level, exposure to varying temperatures affects the mitochondrial functional properties of poikilothermic organisms. Metabolic enzymes that supply reduced substrates to the electron transport chain and elements of the oxidative phosphorylation system must therefore adjust their activity and flux rates to the altered temperature conditions. In the present study, Daphnia magna respiration was analyzed in response to acute and chronic changes in ambient temperature. Oxygen consumption as well as substrate and electron flux rates were measured at the animals' acclimation temperature and at two additional acute temperatures. High activity of citrate synthase (CS) in cold-acclimated animals (10 degrees C) may have resulted from mitochondrial quantitative adjustments. However, thermal sensitivity of the functional properties of mitochondrial enzymes was greater in warm-acclimated animals (30 degrees C). In whole animals, temperature-induced changes were partly compensated by acclimation, but these changes were promoted by acclimation in the case of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Thus, respiration realised in whole animals was limited by the provision of reduced substrates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle rather than by restrictions of the respiratory chain complexes. This may minimize production of reactive oxygen species and resulting damage and reduce waste of substrates from the animals' energy reserves. Still, the integrated biomarker response indicated increased defense against oxidative stress at elevated temperatures.",2024,119,NA,NA

Q.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2015.08.010,"We evaluated the effect of cold shock on the fatty acid composition, antioxidant enzymes, and physiological responses of genetically improved farmed tilapia (GIFT). Experimental GIFT tilapia, a warm-water teleost, were initially acclimated at 28 degrees C and then transferred directly to 13 degrees C. Stress responses were monitored for 120 h. There was a significant change in all parameters in response to the cold stressor (P < 0.05). Serum cortisol levels increased from 336.93 ng/ml to a peak of 1165.31 ng/ml 24 h after the initial cold shock, and declined rapidly thereafter. Serum glucose and cholesterol levels were significantly lower in the low temperature group than the control group at 120 h (P < 0.05). Acute low temperature stress enhanced superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and glutathione levels in the liver of GIFT tilapia. The GIFT tilapia were able to selectively metabolize fatty acids for energy needs during the early period of exposure to low-temperature stress. During this time, they primarily used saturated fatty acids for energy. However as the duration of the stressor and loss of muscle fat increased, the fish began to metabolize long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Increased malondialdehyde was produced by oxidation of these fatty acids leading to oxidative damage. Our results provide insight into the changes in fatty acid metabolism physiology that allow GIFT tilapia juveniles to adapt to short-term cold stress. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the impact of HS on metabolomic profiles of sows during late gestation is not fully understood. We present here, a study investigating the productive performance and metabolic responses in sows when exposed to HS during late gestation. Twelve first-parity Landrace x Large White Fl sows were randomly assigned into two environmental treatments including the thennoneutral (TN) (18-22 degrees C; n = 6) and HS (28-32 degrees C; n = 6) conditions from 85 d of gestation until farrowing. Rectal temperature (RT), respiration rates (RR), and surface temperature (ST) were measured every 4 h from 0800 h to 2000 h during the 2nd week. Farrowing and litter Data, as well as duration of eating, were monitored to assess sows' productive performance. Blood biochemical parameters and urinary metabolomic profiles were measured on d107 of gestation to analyze the host metabolic responses. Our results show that HS increased RT, RR, and ST (P < 0.0001). Duration of parturition was prolonged during the delivery in HS group (P < 0.05). Piglet body weight (SW) at d 10 and weaning were reduced by 18\% and 17\% respectively due to maternal HS (P < 0.001). Duration of eating increased as a result of HS (P < 0.001), consistent with the significant changes observed in serum ghrelin (P < 0.05). Moreover, serum ACTH, cortisol, insulin, creatinine, and BUN saw increase as well (P < 0.05). Plasma NEFA were elevated by HS (P < 0.001). Additionally, HS elevated (VIP > 1, log(2) fold change > 0.585, and P < 0.05) the relative concentrations of 5-aminovaleric acid, beta-alanine, cysteine, isoleucine, glyceric acid, erythronic acid, mannitol, erythritol, 2-methyl-1,3-butanediol, and pantothenic acid in urine. These ten metabolites mainly affected the pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, beta-alanine metabolism, and glycerolipid metabolism in pregnant sows.

This study was designed to delineate the effects of prenatal thermal stress on serum levels of acute-phase proteins (APPs), namely ceruloplasmin (CPN) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), the regulation of brain mRNA levels of heat shock protein (Hsp) 70, and serum levels of corticosterone (CORT) in embryos and neonatal chicks. Hatching eggs were subjected to three thermal treatments; (i) standard optimum temperature throughout (SS: 37.8 degrees C and 56 \% RH), (ii) heat stress for 12 h daily (HS: 40.0 degrees C and 56 \% RH), and (iii) cold stress for 12 h daily 18 (CS: 30.2 degrees C and 56 \% RH). The heat and cold stress treatments were imposed from the 10th to the 18th day of incubation (ED). Results showed that thermal stress had a negligible effect on hatchability rate and body temperatures of neonatal chicks. The CS treatment was detrimental to embryonic growth. The HS treatment elevated AGP (ED 16, ED 18, and post-hatch day 1), CPN (on post-hatch day 1), and CORT (ED 14). On the contrary, the CS embryos had reduced AGP (ED14, ED16, ED18, and post-hatch day 1), CPN (ED 16), and CORT (ED 14, ED 16, ED 18). The brain mRNA levels of Hsp70 were upregulated throughout the experimental period in both the HS and CS embryos and chicks. Based on these modifications, AGP, together with Hsp70 mRNA expression, could be considered effective biomarkers useful to evaluate the magnitude and the time response of embryos and neonatal chicks to prenatal thermal stress. It is concluded that developing chicken embryos have the ability to evoke APPs, Hsp70 and CORT reactions which are important to cope with thermal stress.",2022,109,NA,NA
A test of the thermal coadaptation hypothesis with ultimate measures of fitness in flour beetles,"Halliday, William D. and Blouin-Demers, Gabriel",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.07.017,"Whole-organism performance of ectotherms depends on body temperature, which is tightly linked to environmental temperatures. Individuals attempting to optimize fitness must thus select appropriate temperatures. The thermal coadaptation hypothesis posits that To for traits closely linked to fitness should match temperatures selected by a species (T-set) and should coevolve with T-set. To may mismatch T-set, if the thermal reaction norm for fitness is asymmetric. In this study, we examined six traits related to fitness in red and in confused flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum and T. confusum, respectively), including longevity, lifetime reproductive success, reproductive rate, and development time at four temperatures between 23 and 32 degrees C. For reproductive traits, To matched Tset whereas for longevity To was lower than T-set Triboliwn species have a strongly r-selected life history strategy, therefore reproductive traits are likely more tightly linked to fitness than longevity due to high predation rates at early life stages. We therefore provide support for the thermal coadaptation hypothesis for reproductive traits that are tightly linked to fitness. Our results highlight the importance of knowing the relationships of traits to fitness when studying thermal physiology.",2017,69,NA,206-212

However, CTmax also changed over time, ranging from 39.0 to 39.6 degrees C and increasing by 0.6 degrees C across the first four trials before leveling off. This is most likely the effect of heat hardening, indicating that thermal tolerance can increase after repeated exposure to extreme heat events.",2020,90,NA,NA

Speed of exposure to rapid cold hardening and genotype drive the level of acclimation response in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>,"Gerken, Alison R. and Eller-Smith, Olivia C. and Morgan, Theodore J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.06.011,"Comparing methodologies that attempt to mimic natural conditions is important when evaluating thermal tolerances of ectotherms, as exposing animals to different artificial thermal regimes may provide conflicting information of an insect's thermal profile. Rapid cold hardening (RCH) occurs in ectotherms and typically increases survivorship to extreme cold exposure through a short, pre-treatment to a non-lethal cold temperature. Here we assess survivorship in a set of genotypes from the Drosophila melanogaster Reference Panel for direct and ramping RCH pre-treatments at cooling rates occurring under more natural conditions (0.1 degrees C/min and 0.5 degrees C/min) in combination with a direct and ramped rewarming treatment post cold exposure. We find that all three pretreatment exposures alone significantly increase survivorship. We find significant correlations in survivorship among treatments across genotypes, suggesting that regardless of the pre-treatment, individuals of a given genotype have an innate level of acclimation. When rewarming is introduced, survivorship significantly decreased relative to pre-treatment alone and correlations of survival between phenotypes were not significant. Our results suggest that rewarming and slow RCH are costly to survival while a quicker RCH may impart physiological benefits more consistently across genotypes.",2018,76,NA,21-28

Physiology of temperate and subtropical populations of blue crabs are well studied; however, a lack of information exists on tropical populations. Given the low locomotion capabilities of C. sapidus adult blue crabs, natural selection should favor traits that shape a particular thermal niche reflected through tolerance modulation to dissolved oxygen (DO). This study was designed to evaluate the thermal window and hypoxia sensitivity of the blue crab population in the southern Gulf of Mexico. The effect of acclimation temperatures from 20 degrees C to 34 degrees C on thermal preference (TP), critical thermal limits (CT), and thermal metabolic scope (TMS) was assessed in normoxia. Metabolic rate regulation over oxygen partial pressure (pO(2)) gradient was evaluated through oxygen consumption measurements at different degrees of acute hypoxia. Callinectes sapidus was observed tending to specialize towards higher temperatures, showing a mean TP from 26 degrees C to 33 degrees C. The lowest performance of aerobic pathways was observed at the coldest regimes and the highest at the warmest ones with mean TMS value being 35 \% greater at 34 degrees C than 20 degrees C. Patterns for metabolic regulation were dependent on the interaction between environmental temperature and DO, in which the interval from 29 degrees C to 34 degrees C provoked a 50 \% reduction in oxygen consumption when exposed to similar to 20\% air saturation levels. The results obtained showed that blue crabs distributed in the southern Gulf of Mexico could be close to their oxygen-temperature tolerance limits, which has important implications when climate change effects on species re-distribution is considered.",2021,102,NA,NA

These adaptations are crucial in all organisms, although they are more relevant in those that have reached a great adaptive diversity such as scorpions. Within scorpions, the genus Urophonius presents species with winter activity, being this a peculiarity within the Order and an opportunity to study the strategies deployed by these organisms when facing different temperatures. Here, we explore three basic issues of lipid remodeling under high and low temperatures, using adults and juveniles of Urophonius achalensis and U. brachycentrus. First, as an indicator of metabolic state, we analyzed the lipidic changes in different tissues observing that low temperatures generate higher quantities of triacylglycerols and fewer amount of structural lipids and sphyngomielin. Furthermore, we studied the participation of fatty acids in adaptive homeoviscosity, showing that there are changes in the quantity of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids at low temperature (mainly 16:0, 18:0, 18:1 and 18:2). Finally, we observe that there are quantitative and qualitative variations in the cuticular hydrocarbons (with possible water barrier and chemical recognition function). These fluctuations are in some cases species-specific, metabolic-specific, tissue-specific and in others depend on the ontogenetic state.",2021,96,NA,NA

Intracerebroventricular injection of taurine caused dose-dependent hypothermia and reduced food intake under CT. The mRNA expression of the GABAA receptors, GABAAR-alpha 1 and GABAAR-gamma, but not that of GABABR, significantly decreased in the diencephalon after central injection of taurine. Subsequently, we found that picrotoxin, a GABAAR antagonist, attenuated taurine-induced hypothermia. Central taurine significantly decreased the brain concentrations of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, a major metabolite of norepinephrine; however, the concentrations of serotonin, dopamine, and the epinephrine metabolites, 3,4-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and homovanillic acid, were unchanged. Although hypothermia was not observed under HT after central injection of taurine, plasma glucose and uric acid levels were higher, and plasma sodium and calcium levels were lower, than those in chicks under CT. In conclusion, brain taurine may play a role in regulating body temperature and food intake in chicks through GABAAR. The changes in plasma metabolites under heat stress suggest that brain taurine may play an important role in maintaining homeostasis in chicks.",2021,98,NA,NA

Metabolic rate is one metric we can examine to improve our understanding of how well fish perform in different habitats, including across temperature gradients, as metabolism can be directly influenced by environmental temperatures in ectotherms. We estimated the standard metabolic rate, maximum metabolic rate, and aerobic scope of lab-reared juvenile Brook Trout (similar to 1 year) using intermittent-flow respirometry across a range of temperatures (5-23 degrees C) likely experienced in the wild. We included a diurnal temperature cycle of +/- 1.5 degrees C for each treatment temperature to simulate temporal variation observed in natural waterbodies. Standard metabolic rate and maximum metabolic rate both increased with acclimation temperature before appearing to plateau around 20 degrees C, while mass specific aerobic scope was found to increase from a mean of 287.25 +/- 13.03 mg O2.kg(-1).h (-1) at 5 degrees C to 384.85 +/- 13.31 mg O2.kg(-1).h (-1) at 15 degrees C before dropping at higher temperatures. Although a slight peak was found at 15 degrees C, the generally flat thermal performance curve for aerobic scope suggests Brook Trout are capable of adjusting to a relatively wide range of thermal regimes, appearing to be eurythermal, or a thermal generalist, at least for salmonids. The ability of this population to maintain similar physiological performance across a wide range of temperatures may help explain why Brook Trout succeed in a variety of different thermal habitats.",2021,99,NA,NA

As expected, naive mussels were less thermotolerant than heat-hardened i.e. Summer LT50, N = 31.9, HH = 33.5 degrees C; Winter LT50, N = 31.4, HH = 33.8 degrees C. Moreover, at 33 degrees C no heat-hardened mussels died compared to 100\% mortality in naive specimens. At 35 degrees C all mussels died regardless of treatment. For the `Summer' mussels, metabolite abundances in gill tissues of both naive and heat-hardened mussels were quantified. For mussels at 33 degrees C, succinic acid was significantly higher in naive mussels than heat-hardened mussels, indicating perturbations to mitochondrial pathways in these thermally stressed mussels. Additionally, analysis of biochemical pathway activity suggested a loss of neural control i.e. significantly reduced GABAergic synapse activity, in naive vs. heat-hardened mussels at 33 degrees C. Taken together these findings suggest that heat hardening improves mussel survival at higher temperatures by delaying the onset of cellular anaerobic metabolism, and by maintaining inhibition of neural pathways. Such results offer new perspectives on the complex suite of sub-cellular stress responses operating within thermally stressed organisms.",2018,74,NA,37-46

We assessed the expression of the hsp23, 40, 70 and 90 genes at the mRNA level when submitted to heat shocks of 40 and 44 degrees C/1 h (control at 25 degrees C). For this, we evaluated a set of available and suitable reference genes in order to perform data normalization using the real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) technique, and then confirmed the production of HSP70 protein based on Western blot. Results were compared with the hardening capacity of B. tabaci, measured by fitness components as a response to heat shocks, using 40 degrees C as the induction temperature. Three of the four genes (hsp23, 70 and 90) were upregulated by heat stress at mRNA, showing differential expression patterns. Hsp70 expression was confirmed at the protein level. Hardening significantly increased fitness following heat stress, suggesting that HSPs may contribute to hardening capacity in B. tabaci. Potential role of each gene in the heat-shock response for whiteflies is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2015,52,NA,199-207
Altered temperature affect body condition and endochondral ossification in Bufo gargarizans tadpoles,"Ren, Chaolu and Teng, Yiran and Shen, Yujia and Yao, Qiong and Wang, Hongyuan",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103020,"Bufo gargarizans is one kind of economic animals with higher medicinal value in China. In this study, B. gargarizans (Bufo gargarizans) tadpoles were reared at three different water temperature (15, 22 and 29 degrees C) from Gosner stages 28-46. We investigated the effects of temperature on growth, development, survival, metamorphic duration, size and skeletal ossification at Gosner stage 40, 42, and 46, as well as thyroid tissue reached metamorphic climax (Gs42). Besides, we examined the transcription levels of endochondral ossificationrelated genes in hind limb at metamorphic climax (Gs42). Our results showed that the growth and development of tadpoles conform to the temperature-size rule (TSR). While warm temperature resulted in the decrease in body size and hind limb length, and shorten larval period, cold temperature led to increase in body size and hind limb length but prolonged larval period. Histological examinations revealed that warm and cold temperatures caused damage to thyroid tissue. Also, warm and cold temperatures inhibited the degree of ossification with the double staining methodology. Additionally, the real-time PCR results suggested that warm and cold temperatures significantly up-regulated Runx2, VEGF and VEGFR mRNA levels, and down-regulated TR beta, MMP9, MMP13 and Runx3 mRNA levels. The up-regulation of Dio2 level and down-regulation of Dio3 level were observed in warm temperature. TR alpha mRNA level was significantly increased in warm temperature, but decreased in cold temperature. Collectively, these observations demonstrated that warm and cold temperatures affected endochondral ossification in B. gargarizans tadpoles, which might influence their capacity to terrestrial locomotion.",2021,99,NA,NA
Acclimation capability inferred by metabolic performance in two sea cucumber species from different latitudes,"Kuehnhold, Holger and Novais, Sara C. and Alves, Luis M. F. and Kamyab, Elham and Lemos, Marco F. L. and Slater, Matthew J. and Kunzmann, Andreas",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.019,"The notion that thermal specialists from tropical regions live closer to their temperature limits than temperate eurytherms, seems too generalized. Species specific differences in physiological and biochemical stress reactions are linked to key components of organism fitness, like metabolic capacity, which indicates that acclimation potential across latitudes might be highly diverse rather than simplistic. In this study the exposure of a tropical (Holothuria scabra) and a temperate (Holothuria forskali) sea cucumber species to identical cold- and warm-acclimation stress was compared using the key metabolic parameters, respiration rate, enzyme activity (ETS, LDH, IDH), and energy reserve fractions (lipid, carbohydrate and protein). Results show much broader respiratory adjustments, as response to temperature change, in H. scabra (2-30 mu gO(2){*}gww(-1){*}h(-1)) compared to H. forskali (1.5-6.6 mu gO(2){*}gww(-1){*}h(-1)). Moreover, the tropical species showed clearly pronounced up and down regulation of metabolic enzymes and shifts in energy reserves, due to thermal acclimation, while the same metabolic indicators remained consistent in the temperate species. In summary, these findings indicate enhanced metabolic plasticity in H. scabra at the cost of elevated energy expenditures, which seems to favor the tropical stenotherm in terms of thermal acclimation capacity. The comparison of such holistic metabolic analyses between conspecifics and congeners, may help to predict the heterogeneous effects of global temperature changes across latitudinal gradients.",2019,84,NA,407-413

Thus, the aim was to evaluate interactions between RFI and thermal environment on performance, nitrogen balance, ingestive behavior and carcass yield of Dorper lambs receiving diets containing different concentrate levels. Dorper lambs (male, n = 64, 17.83 +/- 2.43 kg and 110 +/- 10 days of age) were confined individually for 40 days for RFI classification. Lambs were separated into positive RFI (n = 30) and negative RFI (n = 30) and remained confined for another 60 days. The animals were distributed in a randomized block design, with a 2 x 2 x 3 factorial scheme, with 2 confinement environments (full sun or shade), 2 groups of feed efficiency (RFI positive or RFI negative) and three diets containing different concentrate levels (30, 45 and 60\%), with 5 replications in each treatment. Isolated effects of concentrate level were observed for dry matter intake and digestibility, feeding, rumination, idle and chewing times, feeding efficiency, ingested, excreted and absorbed nitrogen, and on cooling losses, hot and cold carcass yield (P < 0.05). There was an effect of environment x concentrate interaction on performance, retained nitrogen and nitrogen balance (P < 0.05). There was an effect of RFI x environment interaction on the dry matter rumination efficiency, hot and cold carcass weight (P < 0.05). Under experimental conditions, RFI did not influence the productive performance of Dorper lambs. Interactions between environment and diet indicate better performance for Dorper lamb confined in the shade and receiving a higher proportion of concentrate. Animals with negative RFI show better performance and carcass weight when confined in shade, while animals with positive RFI showed better responses to these variables when confined in full sun.",2024,119,NA,NA
Metabolic changes in the subtropical frog <i>Boana pulchella </i>during experimental cooling and recovery conditions,"de Amaral, Marjoriane and Von Dentz, Maiza Cristina and Simoes, Leonardo Airton Ressel and Vogt, Everton and Heiermann, Dener and Fischer, Pedro and Colombo, Patrick and Kucharski, Luiz Carlos",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103705,"Frogs have developed biochemical and physiological adaptations to occupy diverse ecological niches on Earth successfully. Survival in frozen states is a fascinating strategy made possible by evolving adaptations to produce cryoprotectant solutes. The hylid frog Boana pulchella thrives in South American regions with cold climates, remaining active while enduring sporadic subzero temperatures during winter. The species' metabolic changes during subzero exposure remain unclear. Therefore, we exposed B. pulchella to cooling and recovery, assessing plasma and tissue metabolite changes. Cooling significantly reduced urea concentrations in plasma (P = 0.033), muscle (P = 0.001), heart (P = 0.009), and brain (P = 0.041) compared to acclimation. Liver glucose oxidation and glycogen synthesis were lower in cooling and recovery than in acclimation (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0117, respectively). Muscle glycogen synthesis was lower in recovery than acclimation (P = 0.0249). These results demonstrate B. pulchella's physiological strategies during subzero exposure, likely reflecting species-specific evolutionary adaptations for brief subzero exposures that enable winter survival in its natural habitat.",2023,117,NA,NA
Combined effects of rearing temperature regime (thermocycle <i>vs.</i> constant temperature) during early development and thermal treatment on Nile tilapia <i>(Oreochromis niloticus)</i> sex differentiation,"de Alba, Gonzalo and Camara-Ruiz, Maria and Esteban, Maria Angeles and Sanchez-Vazquez, Francisco Javier and Lopez-Olmeda, Jose Ferrando",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103596,"In nature, water temperature experiences daily variations known as thermocycles. Temperature is the main environmental factor that influences sex determination in most teleost fish. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of rearing temperature (thermocycle (TC) vs. constant (CTE)) on development and a posterior thermal shock throughout the period of sex differentiation of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Embryos and larvae were kept under two temperature regimes: TC of 31 degrees C:25 degrees C day:night vs. CTE of 28 degrees C from 0 to 11 dpf. After this period, the larvae from each group were subjected to either heat treatment (HT, 36 degrees C for 12 days) or kept under the same rearing temperatures until 23 dpf (Control, C). Then all the groups remained at constant temperature until 270 dpf, when blood and gonads were collected. Larval samples were used to examine the expression of genes related to male (amh, ara, sox9a, dmrt1a) and female (cyp19a1a, foxl2, era) sexual differentiation. In juveniles, sex was characterized by histology, the gonadal expression of the genes involved in the sex steroid synthesis was analyzed by qPCR, and plasma testosterone (T) and estradiol (E2) levels were analyzed by ELISA. In larvae, daily TCs increased the survival rate against HT and up-regulated the expression of ovarian differentiation genes. In juveniles, TC + C induced a higher proportion of females and higher cyp19a1a expression compared to CTE + C. HT induced changes in the CTE group by up-regulating testicular differentiation genes and down-regulating female promoting genes, which did not occur in the TC group. Juveniles from TC + C group presented a higher proportion of females with higher E2 and cyp19a1a than CTE + HT. Fish from the CTE + HT group showed a higher percentage of males with highest T and amh. These findings indicate that daily TCs during larval development promote ovarian differentiation and diminish the masculinizing effects of HT.",2023,115,NA,NA
The carryover effects of embryonic incubation temperature on subsequent growth and thermal tolerance in white sturgeon,"Cheung, Katherine and Nelson-Flower, Martha J. and Mcadam, Steve and Brauner, Colin J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2024.103860,"Environmental variation experienced during early periods of development can lead to persistent phenotypic alteration, known as carryover effects. Such effects increase concern for threatened or endangered species such as the white sturgeon ( Acipenser transmontanus ), particularly considering expected thermal changes due to climate change. We evaluated how temperature during embryonic development affects physiological parameters such as larval and early juvenile growth and thermal tolerance. Nechako River white sturgeon embryos were incubated at different environmental temperatures (T e ) of 12 degrees C (the natural spawning temperature of this population), 15 degrees C (the hatchery incubation temperature), and 18 degrees C (representing potential increases in river temperatures given global climate change). After hatch, fish were reared at a common 15 degrees C for 80 days post -hatch (dph). Individuals from each temperature treatment were tested for thermal tolerance using the critical thermal maximum method (CT max ), euthanized, and measured. Fish were examined at regular intervals from 13 to 80 dph, which bridged the time from the start of exogenous feeding through the transition into early juveniles. We found carryover effects of high embryonic T e in the short term for both thermal tolerance and growth. Fish that developed at 18 degrees C had the lowest thermal tolerance during the start of exogenous feeding. However, differences in thermal tolerance were small for early juveniles and were unlikely to be ecologically relevant in the longer term. Fish that developed at 18 degrees C were smallest over the observation period, indicating a possible cost for survival from increasing environmental temperatures during embryonic development. This research represents a window into a critical period of development during which fish are particularly vulnerable to climatic variation, and shows that cooler temperatures (12 degrees C) during incubation are optimal for this population. The results can inform environmental managers on the best strategies to help conserve current white sturgeon populations across their range.",2024,121,NA,NA

Changes in temperature have an important effect on the growth and development and energy metabolism of amphibians. The aim of this study is to unravel the effects of temperature on the leptin signaling pathway of Bufo gargarizans and its molecular mechanisms. Our results showed that high temperature accelerated the development rate of tadpoles, but reduced body size and mass, while low temperature deferred the development of tadpoles, but increased size and mass. Both high temperature and low temperature exposure caused pathological damage of the liver in B. gargarizans. The results of RT-qPCR revealed that the high temperature treatment significantly upregulated the transcript levels of genes related to thyroid hormone (DIO2 (D2), Thyroid Hormone Receptor-? (TR?)) and the leptin signaling pathway (Leptin Receptor (LepR), Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), Tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), Signal Transducer And Activator Of Transcription 3 (STAT3), Signal Transducer And Activator Of Transcription 3.1 (STAT3.1), and Signal Transducer And Activator Of Transcription 6 (STAT6)), while there was a decrease of mRNA expression of these genes (TR?, Thyroid Hormone Receptor-Beta (TR?), LepR, JAK1, and TYK2) in the liver of tadpoles exposed to high temperature compared with the intermediate temperature treatment. Therefore, our results suggested that temperature extremes might interfere with the thyroid and leptin signaling pathways and affect the growth and development of B. gargarizans. Furthermore, tissue injury of the liver could occur due to exposure to temperature extremes. This work promotes public awareness of environmental protection and species conservation needs, also provides valuable experimental data and a theoretical basis for the protection of amphibians.",2021,96,NA,NA

Broilers in the control and HS groups were fed a basal diet, and in the MOS group were given the basal diet supplemented with 1 g/kg MOS for 42 days, respectively. The temperature was maintained 32-33 degrees C for the first 3 days for all broilers, and it was gradually reduced by 3 degrees C per week to a final temperature of 20 degrees C in the control group, whereas it remained unchanged for 8 h and reduced to the same level to the control group for the remaining 16 h daily in the both HS and MOS groups. Compared with the control group, cyclic HS resulted in retarded growth performance and increased serum corticosterone level (P < 0.05). The supplementation of MOS promoted growth performance and reduced serum corticosterone concentration in broilers subjected to cyclic HS (P < 0.05). Cyclic HS increased drip loss(48 h), cooking loss, malondialdehyde accumulation, and moisture content, whereas decreased pH(24 h) value, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity, and crude protein content in the breast muscle (P < 0.05). In contrast, dietary MOS supplementation reduced drip loss(48 h), and malondialdehyde concentration, and increased GSH-Px activity in breast muscle compared with the HS group (P < 0.05).

Forecasts indicate a worldwide temperature rise of 1.4-6 degrees C by 2100, and an increase in heatwave frequency is expected. This study investigated the effects of constant temperatures (CT; 27, 34, 39, 40 and 41 degrees C) and fluctuating temperature (FT; 27/34 degrees C: 12/12 h) on the survival, metabolic rate, locomotor activity, gas exchange pattern, heat loss and water content of the male Jamaican field cricket, Gryllus assimilis (Fabricius, 1775) (Orthoptera: Gryllidae). It was found that 39 degrees C was the estimated lethal temperature for 50\% of the population and that 41 degrees C was considered the thermal limit, causing 100\% mortality in 96 h. Furthermore, FT caused slightly higher mortality (8.9 +/- 3.8\%) than CT27 (0\%) and CT34 (1.43 +/- 1.43\%). FT caused a greater increase in the metabolic rate and locomotor activity than CT27. It was found that G. assimilis males had a continuous gas exchange as a standard at CT27; however, CT34 changed the gas exchange pattern from continuous to cyclic in 27\% of crickets. FT decreased heat loss in crickets more than CT34; however, no significant differences were found in locomotor activity and metabolic rate. In addition, no significant differences between CT27, CT34 and FT were observed in terms of water content, thus suggesting no difference in water loss. Thus, it is suggested that FT, despite involving a modest warming, increased the climate sensitivity of G. assimilis males and led to a change in their optimum temperature, pushing it beyond its usual thermal limits. However, higher mortality in FT compared to CT27 (control) and CT34 must be interpreted with caution. In addition, the risk of higher mortality of G. assimilis males is predicted, especially in South America, where this cricket is widely distributed.",2022,105,NA,NA

The design of two of the experiments was fully randomized in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement with two forms of feed (mash and pellet) and two nutritional levels (13.19 MJ/kg and 194.8 g/kg CP - normal level and 13.61 MJ/kg and 210.3 g/kg CP - high level). The experiments took place in a climate-controlled room: Experiment 1 at thermoneutrality (21-23 degrees C and 58-60\% relative humidity) for 24 h/day; Experiment 2 under thermal stress cycle (31-32 degrees C and 63-65\% relative humidity), for 6h/day and thermoneutrality (21-23 degrees C, 58-60\% relative humidity) for 18h/day. The nutrient digestibility and performance was analyzed. The design of the third experiment was fully randomized with two ambient condition treatments (thermoneutral and thermal stress) on heat production, caloric increment and net energy. Pellet feed obtained higher digestibility of dry matter, digestibility of crude protein, AME and AMEn (P < 0.05) than mash feed for broilers reared in the thermoneutral environment. At the high nutritional level there was no effect of treatments on the coefficient of dry matter and crude protein (DCCP) (P > 0.05), while the highest digestibility of AME and AMEn were obtained by the high nutritional level diet (P < 0.05). Pellet feed had higher DCCP (P < 0.05) than mash feed for broilers reared under cyclic heat stress. Broiler chickens under cyclic stress experienced increased caloric increment, rectal temperature and respiratory rate. The appropriate strategy to minimize these effects in both ambient conditions is to pellet feed.",2022,103,NA,NA
Comprehensive thermal performance curves for yellow dung fly life history traits and the temperature-size-rule,"Blanckenhorn, Wolf U. and Berger, David and Rohner, Patrick T. and Schafer, Martin A. and Akashi, Hiroshi and Walters, Richard J.",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103069,"Ambient temperature strongly determines the behaviour, physiology, and life history of all organisms. The technical assessment of organismal thermal niches in form of now so-called thermal performance curves (TPC) thus has a long tradition in biological research. Nevertheless, several traits do not display the idealized, intuitive dome-shaped TPC, and in practice assessments often do not cover the entire realistic or natural temperature range of an organism. We here illustrate this by presenting comprehensive sex-specific TPCs for the major (ju-venile) life history traits of yellow dung flies (Scathophaga stercoraria; Diptera: Scathophagidae). This concerns estimation of prominent biogeographic rules, such as the temperature-size-rule (TSR), the common phenomenon in ectothermic organisms that body size decreases as temperature increases. S. stercoraria shows an untypical asymptotic TPC of continuous body size increase with decreasing temperature without a peak (optimum), thus following the TSR throughout their entire thermal range (unlike several other insects presented here). Egg-to -adult mortality (our best fitness estimator) also shows no intermediate maximum. Both may relate to this fly entering pupal winter diapause below 12 degrees C. While development time presents a negative exponential rela-tionship with temperature, development rate and growth rate typify the classic TPC form for this fly. The hitherto largely unexplored close relative S. suilla with an even more arctic distribution showed very similar responses, demonstrating large overlap among two ecologically similar, coexisting dung fly species, thus implying limited utility of even complete TPCs for predicting species distribution and coexistence.",2021,100,NA,NA

Heat stress may occur as repeated small-scale events or as a single prolonged event, which may cause different outcomes to the organism. Here, we subjected Helicoverpa punctigera (Wallengren) pupae to two temperatures (44.2 degrees C and 43 degrees C) and two exposure treatments - a single 3-h prolonged exposure prolonged and three repeated 1-h exposure period with 24 h recovery time between bouts - to assess the biological traits of individuals. The maximum temperatures were used as they were just below the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) 47.3 degrees C +/- 0.3 degrees C of pupae for which they could survive exposure. Adults in the prolonged and repeated heat-stressed treatments had 1.70 and 3.34 more days to emergence and 1.57 and 3.30 days extended life span compared to those kept under a constant 25 degrees C temperature (control treatment). Both pre-oviposition and oviposition periods were extended in the heat-stressed groups. Fecundity in the prolonged and repeated heat-stressed females was reduced by 34.7\% and 65.5\% eggs in the 43 degrees C treatment group and by 94.3\% and 93.6\% eggs in the 44.2 degrees C treatment group compared to the control group. No eggs from females in either the prolonged and repeated heat-stress groups hatched. We establish that heat stress on pupae can influence the population dynamics of H. punctigera by reducing fecundity as well as extending the pre oviposition period, and affecting adult development. Also, as heat exposure on the parent generation resulted in no offspring production, it is critical to assess cross-generational responses to extreme heat stress.",2021,101,NA,NA
Repeatability of thermal reaction norms for spontaneous locomotor activity in juvenile newts,"Baskiera, Senka and Gvozdik, Lumir",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.01.010,"Locomotor activity is a major attribute of animals. Although this trait determines important ecological processes, such as dispersal and species interactions, the sources of its variation are not fully understood. We examined the influence of body temperature (13, 18, 23, and 28 degrees C) and individual identity on spontaneous locomotor activity in juvenile alpine newts, Ichthyosaura alpestris, over three consecutive weeks. Locomotor activity was characterized by four parameters: distance covered, mean velocity, frequency of movements, and total activity rate (all directional and non-directional movements). Apart from total activity rate, thermal reaction norms for locomotor parameters had convex or concave curvilinear shapes. During the first trial series, i.e. across the four body temperatures that were tested, individual identity explained less variation in thermal reaction norms than during the second series. Individual means, i.e. the vertical positions of individual thermal reaction norms, were repeatable between trial series in all locomotor activity parameters but the frequency of movements. We conclude that spontaneous locomotor activity is a complex trait, which can be characterized by several parameters with varying individual repeatability and thermal dependency. This information should be considered for planning further locomotor activity experiments, conservation strategies, and modeling ectotherm responses to climate change.",2019,80,NA,126-132

It feeds on coffee plant vegetative parts and berries leading to a direct reduction in coffee yield and quality. This study aimed to determine A. thunbergii thermal requirements, and to obtain new information on the pest demography as influenced by temperature. Temperature-dependent models were developed using the Insect Life Cycle Modelling software (ILCYM) through a complete life table study at seven constant temperatures in the range 18-32 degrees C. Non-linear functions were fitted to A. thunbergii development, mortality, fecundity and senescence. Model parameters and demographic variables obtained from the models were given for each temperature and development stage. Life table parameters were estimated for nine constant temperatures, from 18 degrees C to 26 degrees C, using stochastic simulations. The minimum temperature threshold (T-min) and the thermal constant (k) for the development from egg to adult were estimated from a linear function at 12.1 degrees C and 666.67 days, respectively. The maximum temperature threshold (T-max) was estimated at 33.9 degrees C from a Logan model. The optimum temperature for immature stages' survival was estimated to be between 22.4 and 24.7 degrees C. The maximum fecundity was 147.7 eggs female(-1) at 21.2 degrees C. Simulated A. thunbergii life table parameters were affected by temperature, and the maximum value of intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) was 0.029 at 22 degrees C and 23 degrees C. In general, the life cycle data, models and demographic parameters we obtained were in line with previous reports for antestia bugs or other stink bug species.

In the present experiment, we exposed the Indian major carp, rohu Labeo rohita to three different temperature regimes (30 degrees C as control and 33 degrees C and 36 degrees C) for 60 days and observed the effects of these temperature on: major hemato-biochemical indices (Hemoglobin; Hb, Red blood cell; RBC, White blood cell; WBC and blood glucose levels), erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA), and erythrocytic cellular abnormalities (ECA) of peripheral erythrocytes along with the formation of differential leucocytes in the blood. Fish were sacrificed at day 7, 15, 30 and 60 after the start of exposure to the temperature regimes. Hb decreased significantly on days 7 and 15 at 36 degrees C. Throughout the study period, the decrease of RBC and increase of WBC were significant at 36 degrees C. Blood glucose level increased significantly initially at day 7 but decreased significantly at day 60 at 36 degrees C. Frequencies of ENA (binucleated, nuclear bud, nuclear bridge, karyopyknosis and notched nuclei) and ECA (twin, fusion, echinocytic, spindle, tear drop and elongated shaped) were significantly increased at the highest temperature (36 degrees C) at almost all of the sampling days. In the case of differential leucocyte count, high temperature caused a significant increase in the number of neutrophils and a significant decrease in the number of lymphocytes. Overall, these results indicate that chronic exposure to high temperature (36 degrees C) induces a number of stress responses in rohu and that temperature should be kept below 36 degrees C in the aquaculture setting to avoid damage to the fish.",2019,86,NA,NA

Selective pressure for acclimation should be especially strong for animals that complete many generations per year, because seasonal warming or cooling causes offspring to experience different temperatures than their parents did. Here, we studied variation in acclimation capacity among three populations of Drosophila melanogaster. We used a reverse acclimation design to see whether developmental acclimation persisted throughout adulthood. Flies developed from fertilization to adulthood at either 16 degrees or 26 degrees C. Then, flies either remained at the same temperature or moved to the other temperature for 7 days. We measured fecundity at seven temperatures ranging from 14 degrees to 36 degrees C. Genotypes from North Carolina and Vermont laid more eggs at 16 degrees C after spending the larval and adult stages at 16 degrees C, instead of 26 degrees C. In both populations, the benefit of acclimation to 16 degrees C during development was erased by acclimation to 26 degrees C during adulthood. In contrast to our prediction, genotypes from Indiana laid fewer eggs at 16 C or 26 degrees C after developing at this temperature. Overall, these data provide only weak support for the models of optimal acclimation in seasonal environments.",2019,81,NA,25-32
"Effect of water temperature and food availability on growth performance, sex ratio and gonadal development in juvenile convict cichlid (<i>Amatitlania</i> <i>nigrofasciata</i>)","Abdollahpour, Hamed and Falahatkar, Bahram and Van der Kraak, Glen",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103255,"Temperature and food availability are key drivers of growth and reproductive development in fishes, but information on how they interact is poorly understood. This study investigates the effects of water temperature and food availability on growth, sex ratio and gonadal development of the convict cichlid (Amatitlania nigrofasciata) which is an ornamental fish that may be a useful lab model. For this experiment, 180 juvenile convict cichlid (0.3 +/- 0.02 g) were held at three different temperatures (26, 29 and 32 degrees C as T1, T2 and T3) and fed to satiation (S) or a restricted diet (R: half satiation) during a 56-day experimental period. Specific growth rate was significantly higher in T2S treatment than the other groups. The highest and lowest mean oocyte sizes were recorded in T1S and T3R groups, respectively. The sex ratio of fish held at 29 degrees C was male biased (female, 21.0\%; male, 78.9\%), but this was not seen at 26 degrees C (female, 47.6\%; male, 52.4\%) or 32 degrees C (female, 57.1\%; male, 42.9\%). In T1S and T1R treatments, oocytes developed more than the other treatments and in T2S group testicular development was more advanced than other groups. These results demonstrate the complex interplay of temperature and food availability on growth and reproductive development in the convict cichlid. Appropriate food availability significantly improves growth and reproductive processes, while restricted feeding decreases growth, survival rate and reproductive performance.",2022,107,NA,NA
Probiotic bacteria maintain normal growth mechanisms of heat stressed broiler chickens,"Abdelqader, Anas and Abuajamieh, Mohannad and Hayajneh, Firas and Al-Fataftah, Abdur-Rahman",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102654,"Probiotics have growth promoting effects even under periods of heat stress challenge. More information is needed to understand the mechanisms by which probiotics maintain the growth performance. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a probiotic based on Bacillus subtilis bacteria on growth related mechanisms of broilers under heat stress conditions. Specifically, growth performance, skeletal bone characteristics, skeletal muscles size, intestinal villus-crypt structure, intestinal bacteria, growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), cholesterol, and glucose. A total of 1200 one day old Ross 308 male broilers were randomly distributed into 4 treatments, with 12 replicates per treatment and 25 birds per replicate. A 2 x 2 factorial arrangement was used; the main factors were environmental temperature (thermoneutral or heat stress) and diet (control or control + B. subtilis; 3 x 10(7) cfu/kg of feed). From d 22 to 35 of age, birds were either exposed to thermoneutral conditions (21 degrees C) or chronic heat stress (30 degrees C). During the same period, each group was divided into 2 subgroups and fed either the control diet or the B. subtilis supplemented diet. The results demonstrated that B. subtilis had positive effects (P < 0.05) on the body weight gain, feed conversion ratio, villus height, crypt depth, villus surface area, absorptive epithelial cell area and viable counts of intestinal beneficial bacteria. B. subtilis increased (P < 0.05) serum GH, IGF-1 and maintain normal levels of cholesterol and glucose under heat stress conditions. In addition, broilers fed B. subtilis under heat stress conditions exhibited higher (P < 0.05) skeletal muscles size and improved (P < 0.05) tibia traits and lower (P < 0.05) abdominal fat pads deposition compared with the controls. B. subtilis had no effect on rectal temperature under thermoneutral or heat stress conditions.

Suppression of inflammatory responses in heat-stressed broiler chickens by bovine casein,"Abdelqader, Anas and Abuajamieh, Mohannad and Abedal-Majed, Mohamed and Al-Qaisi, Mohmmad and Al-Fataftah, Abdur-Rahman",JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103536,"This study was conducted to investigate the potential of bovine casein to mitigate the inflammatory responses in heat-stressed broiler chickens. One-day-old Ross 308 male broiler chickens (n = 1200) were reared using standard management practices. On d 22 of age, birds were divided into 2 main groups and kept either under thermoneutral temperature (21 +/- 1 degrees C) or chronic heat stress (30 +/- 1 degrees C). Each group was further divided into 2 sub-groups and fed either the control diet (Con) or the casein (3 g/kg) supplemented diet (CAS). The study consisted of four treatments; each treatment was replicated 12 times with 25 birds per replicate. The treatments were as follow; CCon: control temperature + control diet, CCAS: control temperature + casein diet, HCon: heat stress + control diet, and HCAS: heat stress + casein diet. The casein and heat stress protocols were applied from d 22 to d 35 of age. Casein increased the growth performance of the HCAS (P < 0.05) when compared to the HCon. Additionally, the maximum feed conversion efficiency was exhibited (P < 0.05) by the HCAS. Compared with CCon, heat stress increased (P < 0.05) the levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Casein lowered (P < 0.05) the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and increased (P < 0.05) the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines in response to heat exposure. Heat stress decreased (P < 0.05) villus height, crypt depth, villus surface area, and absorptive epithelial cell area. Casein increased (P < 0.05) villus height, crypt depth, villus surface area, and absorptive epithelial cell area in CCAS and HCAS. Furthermore, casein improved intestinal microflora balance by enhancing (P < 0.05) the growth of intestinal beneficial bacteria and decreasing (P < 0.05) the intestinal colonization with the pathogenic bacteria. In conclusion, dietary inclusion of bovine casein would suppress the inflammatory responses in heat-stressed broiler chickens. Such potential could be utilized as an effective man-agement approach to promote gut health and homeostasis during heat stress conditions.",2023,113,NA,NA

Ross-308 one-day chicks (n = 450) were fed one of 9 experimental diets with five replicate cages in 2 phases for 35 d. The experimental diets were a control basal diet without supplementation or with 0.1 mg SeNPs, 0.2 mg SeNPs, 5 g Spirulina, 10 g Spirulina, 0.1 mg SeNPs + 5 g Spirulina, 0.1 mg SeNPs + 10 g Spirulina, 0.2 mg SeNPs + 5 g Spirulina and 0.2 mg SeNPs + 10 g Spirulina per kg diet. Dietary supplementation with Spirulina and SeNPs significantly (P < 0.05) increased body weight gain and European production efficiency factor. Serum GPx and SOD were significantly (P < 0.05) increased with dietary Spirulina and SeNPs supplementation, while, TBARS was decreased (P < 0.05). Circulating immunoglobulin IgM, IgA and IgG were increased in treated birds compared to the control ones, while the antibody titers to IBD, AIV, and NDV were not significantly altered. The results showed that SeNPs and Spirulina exhibited dose-dependent antimicrobial activities against ileal counts of total bacterial, total molds and yeast, coliform, E. coli, Salmonella spp. and Enterococcus spp. However, ileal populations of Lactic acid bacteria were increased with dietary Spirulina and SeNPs in a dose-dependent manner. The microbial load in broilers' diets was reduced by dietary incorporation of S. platensis and SeNPs. These results indicate that Spirulina and SeNPs can be potentially used as growth promoters and antioxidant, immunostimulant, and antimicrobial agents in heat-stressed broilers.",2022,104,NA,NA
"Developmental carryover effects of ocean warming and acidification in corals from a potential climate refugium, the Gulf of Aqaba","Bellworthy, Jessica and Menoud, Malika and Krueger, Thomas and Meibom, Anders and Fine, Maoz",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.186940,"Coral reefs are degrading from the effects of anthropogenic activities, including climate change. Under these stressors, their ability to survive depends upon existing phenotypic plasticity, but also transgenerational adaptation. Parental effects are ubiquitous in nature, yet empirical studies of these effects in corals are scarce, particularly in the context of climate change. This study exposed mature colonies of the common reef-building coral Stylophora pistillata from the Gulf of Aqaba to seawater conditions likely to occur just beyond the end of this century during the peak planulae brooding season (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5: pH -0.4 and +5 degrees C beyond present day). Parent and planulae physiology were assessed at multiple time points during the experimental incubation. After 5 weeks of incubation, the physiology of the parent colonies exhibited limited treatment-induced changes. All significant time-dependent changes in physiology occurred in both ambient and treatment conditions. Planulae were also resistant to future ocean conditions, with protein content, symbiont density, photochemistry, survival and settlement success not significantly different compared with under ambient conditions. High variability in offspring physiology was independent of parental or offspring treatments and indicate the use of a bet-hedging strategy in this population. This study thus demonstrates weak climate-change-associated carryover effects. Furthermore, planulae display temperature and pH resistance similar to those of adult colonies and therefore do not represent a larger future population size bottleneck. The findings add support to the emerging hypothesis that the Gulf of Aqaba may serve as a coral climate change refugium aided by these corals' inherent broad physiological resistance.",2019,222,1,NA
Size-dependent physiological responses of the branching coral <i>Pocillopora verrucosa</i> to elevated temperature and <i>P</i><sub>CO2</sub>,"Edmunds, Peter J. and Burgess, Scott C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.146381,"Body size has large effects on organism physiology, but these effects remain poorly understood in modular animals with complex morphologies. Using two trials of a similar to 24 day experiment conducted in 2014 and 2015, we tested the hypothesis that colony size of the coral Pocillopora verrucosa affects the response of calcification, aerobic respiration and gross photosynthesis to temperature (similar to 26.5 and similar to 29.7 degrees C) and PCO2 (similar to 40 and similar to 1000 atm). Large corals calcified more than small corals, but at a slower size-specific rate; areanormalized calcification declined with size. Whole-colony and areanormalized calcification were unaffected by temperature, P-CO2, or the interaction between the two. Whole-colony respiration increased with colony size, but the slopes of these relationships differed between treatments. Area-normalized gross photosynthesis declined with colony size, but whole-colony photosynthesis was unaffected by P-CO2, and showed a weak response to temperature. When scaled up to predict the response of large corals, area-normalized metrics of physiological performance measured using small corals provide inaccurate estimates of the physiological performance of large colonies. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of colony size in modulating the response of branching corals to elevated temperature and high P-CO2",2016,219,24,3896-3906
Early developmental stages of native populations of <i>Ciona intestinalis</i> under increased temperature are affected by local habitat history,"Clutton, Elizabeth A. and Alurralde, Gaston and Repolho, Tiago",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.233403,"Temperature modulates marine ectotherm physiology, influencing survival, abundance and species distribution. While native species could be susceptible to ocean warming, thermal tolerance might favour the spread of non-native species. Determining the success of invasive species in response to climate change is confounded by the cumulative, synergistic or antagonistic effects of environmental drivers, which vary at a geographical and temporal scale. Thus, an organism's acclimation or adaptive potential could play an important evolutionary role by enabling or conditioning species tolerance to stressful environmental conditions. We investigated developmental performance of early life stages of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis (derived from populations of anthropogenically impacted and control sites) to an extreme weather event (i.e. marine heatwave). Fertilization rate, embryo and larval development, settlement, metamorphosis success and juvenile heart rate were assessed as experimental endpoints. With the exception of fertilization and heart rates, temperature influenced all analysed endpoints. C. intestinalis derived from control sites were the most negatively affected by increased temperature conditions. By contrast, C. intestinalis from anthropogenically impacted sites showed a positive response to thermal stress, with a higher proportion of larvae development, settlement and metamorphosis success being observed under increased temperature conditions. No differences were observed for heart rates between sampled populations and experimental temperature conditions. Moreover, interaction between temperature and populations was statistically significant for embryo and larvae development, and metamorphosis. We hypothesize that selection resulting from anthropogenic forcing could shape stress resilience of species in their native range and subsequently confer advantageous traits underlying their invasive potential.",2021,224,5,NA
How hornbills handle heat: sex-specific thermoregulation in the southern yellow-billed hornbill,"van Jaarsveld, Barry and Bennett, Nigel C. and Czenze, Zenon J. and Kemp, Ryno and van de Ven, Tanja M. F. N. and Cunningham, Susan J. and McKechnie, Andrew E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.232777,"At a global scale, thermal physiology is correlated with climatic variables such as temperature and aridity. There is also evidence that thermoregulatory traits vary with fine-scale microclimate, but this has received less attention in endotherms. Here, we test the hypothesis that avian thermoregulation varies with microclimate and behavioural constraints in a non-passerine bird. Male and female southern yellow-billed hombills (Tockus leucomelas) experience markedly different microclimates while breeding, with the female sealing herself into a tree cavity and moulting all her flight feathers during the breeding attempt, becoming entirely reliant on the male for provisioning. We examined interactions between resting metabolic rate (RMR), evaporative water loss (EWL) and core body temperature (T-b) at air temperatures (T-a) between 30 degrees C and 52 degrees C in male and female hornbills, and quantified evaporative cooling efficiencies and heat tolerance limits. At thermoneutral T-a, neither RMR, EWL nor T-b differed between sexes. At T-a >40 degrees C, however, RMR and EWL of females were significantly lower than those of males, by similar to 13\% and similar to 17\%, respectively, despite similar relationships between T-b and T-a, maximum ratio of evaporative heat loss to metabolic heat production and heat tolerance limits (similar to 50 degrees C). These sex-specific differences in hornbill thermoregulation support the hypothesis that avian thermal physiology can vary within species in response to fine-scale microclimatic factors. In addition, Q(10) for RMR varied substantially, with Q(10) <= 2 in some individuals, supporting recent arguments that active metabolic suppression may be an underappreciated aspect of endotherm thermoregulation in the heat.",2021,224,4,NA
"Plasticity, repeatability and phenotypic correlations of aerobic metabolic traits in a small estuarine fish","Reemeyer, Jessica E. and Rees, Bernard B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.228098,"Standard metabolic rate (SMR), maximum metabolic rate (MMR), absolute aerobic scope (AAS) and critical oxygen tension (P-crit) were determined for the Gulf killifish, Fundulus grandis, an ecologically dominant estuarine fish, acclimated to lowered salinity, elevated temperature and lowered oxygen concentration. Acclimation to low salinity resulted in a small, but significant, elevation of P-crit (suggesting lower tolerance of hypoxia); acclimation to elevated temperature increased SMR, MMR, MS and P-crit; acclimation to low oxygen led to a small increase in SMR, but substantial decreases in MMR, AAS and P-crit. Variation in these metabolic traits among individuals was consistent and repeatable when measured during multiple control exposures over 7 months. Trait repeatability was unaffected by acclimation condition, suggesting that repeatability of these traits is not context dependent. There were significant phenotypic correlations between specific metabolic traits: SMR was positively correlated with MMR and P-crit; MMR was positively correlated with MS; and MS was negatively correlated with P-crit. In general, within-individual variation contributed more than among-individual variation to these phenotypic correlations. The effects of acclimation on these traits demonstrate that aerobic metabolism is plastic and influenced by the conditions experienced by these fish in the dynamic habitats in which they occur; however, the repeatability of these traits and the correlations among them suggest that these traits change in ways that maintain the rank order of performance among individuals across a range of environmental variation.",2020,223,14,NA
Does control of insensible evaporative water loss by two species of mesic parrot have a thermoregulatory role?,"Cooper, Christine Elizabeth and Withers, Philip Carew and Kortner, Gerhard and Geiser, Fritz",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.229930,"Insensible evaporative water loss (EWL) at or below thermoneutrality is generally assumed to be a passive physical process. However, some arid zone mammals and a single arid zone bird can control their insensible water loss, so we tested the hypothesis that the same is the case for two parrot species from a mesic habitat. We investigated red-rumped parrots (Psephotus haematonotus) and eastern rosellas (Platycercus eximius), measuring their EWL, and other physiological variables, at a range of relative humidities at ambient temperatures of 20 and 30 degrees C (below and at thermoneutrality). We found that, despite a decrease in EWL with increasing relative humidity, rates of EWL were not fully accounted for by the water vapour deficit between the animal and its environment, indicating that the insensible EWL of both parrots was controlled. It is unlikely that this deviation from physical expectations was regulation with a primary role for water conservation because our mesic-habitat parrots had equivalent regulatory ability as the arid habitat budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus). This, together with our observations of body temperature and metabolic rate, instead support the hypothesis that acute physiological control of insensible water loss serves a thermoregulatory purpose for endotherms. Modification of both cutaneous and respiratory avenues of evaporation may be involved, possibly via modification of expired air temperature and humidity, and surface resistance.",2020,223,19,NA
Decapod egg membranes: powerful barriers or regulatory structures?,"Bas, Claudia C. and Ituarte, Romina B. and Kittlein, Marcelo J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.244165,"Osmoregulatory abilities and mechanisms of adults and larvae of decapod crustaceans have been extensively investigated. However, how embryos carried by their mothers can deal with changing or extreme salinities is less understood. The egg membranes are believed to isolate embryos from a challenging environment, although osmoregulatory ability has been demonstrated in early developing embryos (naupliar stage) of two crabs. To establish whether embryos are isolated by their membranes and/or are able to osmoregulate, we measured the survival and volume change over 48 h of oocytes and embryos in different stages of three carideans (Betaeus iiiianae, Palaemon macrodactylus and P. argentinus) and the brachyuran Neohelice granulata, subjected to different salinities. In addition, we recorded osmolality changes in homogenates of the same stages in P. argentinus and N. granulata after 2 h of exposure and mapped the presence of putative sites of ions exchange in the membrane of all species. High mortality, when it occurred, was associated with low salinity and mortality variation with the stage of development depended on the species. All species precipitated silver salts in or under the egg envelope, with a different pattern between carideans and the brachyuran. Changes in osmolality and egg volume after hypo- or hyper-osmotic salinity challenges indicate that eggs are not fully isolated by their membranes, and that some osmoregulatory mechanisms are in play to maintain developmental homeostasis. We suggest that egg membranes can participate in osmoregulation by selectively transporting ions to an intramembrane space, with differences between carideans and brachyurans.",2022,225,14,NA
Are acute and acclimated thermal effects on metabolic rate modulated by cell size? A comparison between diploid and triploid zebrafish larvae,"Hermaniuk, Adam and van de Pol, Iris L. E. and Verberk, Wilco C. E. P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.227124,"Being composed of small cells may carry energetic costs related to maintaining ionic gradients across cell membranes as well as benefits related to diffusive oxygen uptake. Here, we test the hypothesis that these costs and benefits of cell size in ectotherms are temperature dependent. To study the consequences of cell size for whole-organism metabolic rate, we compared diploid and triploid zebrafish larvae differing in cell size. A fully factorial design was applied combining three different rearing and test temperatures that allowed us to distinguish acute from acclimated thermal effects. Individual oxygen consumption rates of diploid and triploid larvae across declining levels of oxygen availability were measured. We found that both acute and acclimated thermal effects affected the metabolic response. In comparison with triploids, diploids responded more strongly to acute temperatures, especially when reared at the highest temperature. These observations support the hypothesis that animals composed of smaller cells (i.e. diploids) are less vulnerable to oxygen limitation in warm aquatic habitats. Furthermore, we found slightly improved hypoxia tolerance in diploids. By contrast, warm-reared triploids had higher metabolic rates when they were tested at acute cold temperature, suggesting that being composed of larger cells may provide metabolic advantages in the cold. We offer two mechanisms as a potential explanation of this result, related to homeoviscous adaptation of membrane function and the mitigation of developmental noise. Our results suggest that being composed of larger cells provides metabolic advantages in cold water, while being composed of smaller cells provides metabolic advantages in warm water.",2021,224,1,NA
Plasticity of salmonfly (Pteronarcys californica) respiratory phenotypes in response to changes in temperature and oxygen,"Malison, Rachel L. and Frakes, James I. and Andreas, Amanda L. and Keller, Priya R. and Hamant, Emily and Shah, Alisha A. and Woods, H. Arthur",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.244253,"Like all taxa, populations of aquatic insects may respond to climate change by evolving new physiologies or behaviors, shifting their range, exhibiting physiological and behavioral plasticity, or going extinct. We evaluated the importance of plasticity by measuring changes in growth, survival and respiratory phenotypes of salmonfly nymphs (the stonefly Pteronarcys californica) in response to experimental combinations of dissolved oxygen and temperature. Overall, smaller individuals grew more rapidly during the 6-week experimental period, and oxygen and temperature interacted to affect growth in complex ways. Survival was lower for the warm treatment, although only four mortalities occurred (91.6\% versus 100\%). Nymphs acclimated to warmer temperatures did not have higher critical thermal maxima (CTmax), but those acclimated to hypoxia had CTmax values (in normoxia) that were higher by approximately 1 degrees C. These results suggest possible adaptive plasticity of systems for taking up or delivering oxygen. We examined these possibilities by measuring the oxygen sensitivity of metabolic rates and the morphologies of tracheal gill tufts located ventrally on thoracic segments. Mass-specific metabolic rates of individuals acclimated to warmer temperatures were higher in acute hypoxia but lower in normoxia, regardless of their recent history of oxygen exposure during acclimation. The morphology of gill filaments, however, changed in ways that appeared to depress rates of oxygen delivery in functional hypoxia. Our combined results from multiple performance metrics indicate that rising temperatures and hypoxia may interact to magnify the risks to aquatic insects, but that physiological plasticity in respiratory phenotypes may offset some of these risks.",2022,225,18,NA
Each to their own: skeletal muscles of different function use different biochemical strategies during aestivation at high temperature,"Young, Karen M. and Cramp, Rebecca L. and Franklin, Craig E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.072827,"Preservation of muscle morphology depends on a continuing regulatory balance between molecules that protect and molecules that damage muscle structural integrity. Excessive disruption of the biochemical balance that favours reactive oxygen species (ROS) in disused muscles may lead to oxidative stress, which in turn is associated with increased atrophic or apoptotic signalling and/or oxidative damage to the muscle and thus muscle disuse atrophy. Increases in the rate of oxygen consumption likely increase the overall generation of ROS in vivo. Temperature-induced increases in oxygen consumption rate occur in some muscles of ectotherms undergoing prolonged muscular disuse during aestivation. In the green-striped burrowing frog, Cyclorana alboguttata, both large jumping and small non-jumping muscles undergo atrophy seemingly commensurate with their rate of oxygen consumption during aestivation. However, because the extent of atrophy in these muscles is not enhanced at higher temperatures, despite a temperature-sensitive rate of oxygen consumption in the jumping muscle, we proposed that muscles are protected by biochemical means that, when mobilised at higher temperatures, inhibit atrophy. We proposed that the biochemical response to temperature would be muscle-specific. We examined the effect of temperature on the antioxidant and heat shock protein systems and determined the extent of oxidative damage to lipids and proteins in two functionally different skeletal muscles, the gastrocnemius (jumping muscle) and the iliofibularis (non-jumping muscle), by aestivating frogs at 24 and 30 degrees C for 6. months. We assayed small molecule antioxidant capacity, mitochondrial and cytosolic superoxide dismutase activities and Hsp70 concentrations to show that protective mechanisms in disused muscles are differentially regulated with respect to both temperature and aestivation. High aestivation temperature results in an antioxidant response in the metabolically temperature-sensitive jumping muscle. We assayed lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation to show that oxidative damage is apparent during aestivation and its pattern is muscle-specific, but unaffected by temperature. Consideration is given to how the complex responses of muscle biochemistry inform the different strategies muscles may use in regulating their oxidative environment during extended disuse and disuse at high temperature.",2013,216,6,1012-1024

Field-collected caterpillars had a temperature of crystallization of -7.7 +/- 0.5 degrees C that decreased significantly to -9.5 +/- 0.6 degrees C after 12 weeks of acclimation at 5 degrees C. Hemolymph levels of free proline, total amino acids and proteins reached a peak during the first 4 weeks of acclimation; concomitantly, hemolymph osmolality increased markedly during this interval (from 364 to 1282 mosmol kg(-1)). In contrast, hemolymph pH decreased during the first 4 weeks of acclimation before this trend reversed and pH values gradually returned to initial values. However, pH reached its peak value following 1 week at -20 degrees C, but decreased after longer periods of freezing. During cold acclimation, cholesterol levels decreased in the hemolymph and the membrane fraction of fat body but not in other tissues. Lethal freezing at -80 degrees C reduced cell survival in foregut tissue and caused leakage of free proline, total amino acids and proteins from tissues into the hemolymph. The addition of glycerol to the bathing medium reduced freezing injury in fat body cells, as evidenced by reduced leakage of amino acids and proteins.",2016,219,1,17-25

The results revealed that both the proportion of feeding individuals and ingestion rate were highest at 16 degrees C. Regardless of water temperature, sea cucumbers appeared to be nocturnal and their peak feeding activity occurred at 00:00 h to 04:00 h. Tentacle insertion rate was not significantly correlated with water temperature (<24 degrees C). In all temperature treatments except 24 degrees C, the proportion of moving sea cucumbers was also observed to be higher at night than during the day. The water temperature above thermal threshold (24 degrees C) for aestivation may alter the diel locomotion rhythm. The highest lipase and amylase activities were both observed at 20 degrees C. The highest activities of lipase and amylase at all temperature treatments were observed at 22:00 h to 02:00 h, which was slightly earlier than the feeding peak. In conclusion, even in total darkness, A. japonicus showed more active feeding and moving activities, and higher digestive enzyme activities, at night than during the day. These results demonstrated that diel feeding and locomotion behaviours, at least in the short term, were not controlled by light or low water temperature (<24 degrees C) but by an endogenous rhythm, and A. japonicus had the ability to optimize the digestive function for the coming feeding peak.

We predicted a cumulative effect of pregnancy and dehydration on oxidative stress levels. Our results support the occurrence of an oxidative cost of reproduction as we found higher oxidative damage levels in pregnant females than in non-reproductive individuals, despite an upregulation of antioxidant defences. Surprisingly, water deprivation was associated with an up-regulation of antioxidant defences, and did not increase oxidative damage, either alone or in combination with reproduction.",2017,220,10,1792-1796
Mitochondrial uncoupling prevents cold-induced oxidative stress: a case study using UCP1 knockout mice,"Stier, Antoine and Bize, Pierre and Habold, Caroline and Bouillaud, Frederic and Massemin, Sylvie and Criscuolo, Franois",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.092700,"The relationship between metabolism and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by the mitochondria has often been (wrongly) viewed as straightforward, with increased metabolism leading to higher generation of pro-oxidants. Insights into mitochondrial functioning show that oxygen consumption is principally coupled with either energy conversion as ATP or as heat, depending on whether the ATP-synthase or the mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) is driving respiration. However, these two processes might greatly differ in terms of oxidative costs. We used a cold challenge to investigate the oxidative stress consequences of an increased metabolism achieved either by the activation of an uncoupled mechanism (i.e. UCP1 activity) in the brown adipose tissue (BAT) of wild-type mice or by ATP-dependent muscular shivering thermogenesis in mice deficient for UCP1. Although both mouse strains increased their metabolism by more than twofold when acclimatised for 4 weeks to moderate cold (12 C), only mice deficient for UCP1 suffered from elevated levels of oxidative stress. When exposed to cold, mice deficient for UCP1 showed an increase of 20.2\% in plasmatic reactive oxygen metabolites, 81.8\% in muscular oxidized glutathione and 47.1\% in muscular protein carbonyls. In contrast, there was no evidence of elevated levels of oxidative stress in the plasma, muscles or BAT of wild-type mice exposed to cold despite a drastic increase in BAT activity. Our study demonstrates differing oxidative costs linked to the functioning of two highly metabolically active organs during thermogenesis, and advises careful consideration of mitochondrial functioning when investigating the links between metabolism and oxidative stress.",2014,217,4,624-630
Regulatory mechanisms of metabolic flexibility in the dark-eyed junco (<i>Junco</i> <i>hyemalis</i>),"Stager, Maria and Swanson, David L. and Cheviron, Zachary A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.113472,"Small temperate birds reversibly modify their aerobic performance to maintain thermoregulatory homeostasis under seasonally changing environmental conditions and these physiological adjustments may be attributable to changes in the expression of genes in the underlying regulatory networks. Here, we report the results of an experimental procedure designed to gain insight into the fundamental mechanisms of metabolic flexibility in the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis). We combined genomic transcriptional profiles with measures of metabolic enzyme activities and whole-animal thermogenic performance from juncos exposed to four 6-week acclimation treatments that varied in temperature (cold, 3 degrees C; warm, 24 degrees C) and photoperiod (short day, 8 h light: 16 h dark; long day, 16 h light: 8 h dark). Cold-acclimated birds increased thermogenic capacity compared with warm-acclimated birds, and this enhanced performance was associated with upregulation of genes involved in muscle hypertrophy, angiogenesis, and lipid transport and oxidation, as well as with catabolic enzyme activities. These physiological changes occurred over ecologically relevant timescales, suggesting that birds make regulatory adjustments to interacting, hierarchical pathways in order to seasonally enhance thermogenic capacity.",2015,218,5,767+
Coping with the climate: cuticular hydrocarbon acclimation of ants under constant and fluctuating conditions,"Sprenger, Philipp P. and Burkert, Lars H. and Abou, Beprimerengere and Federle, Walter and Menzel, Florian",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.171488,"Terrestrial arthropods achieve waterproofing by a layer of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs). At the same time, CHCs also serve as communication signals. To maintain waterproofing under different climate conditions, insects adjust the chemical composition of their CHC layer, but this may affect the communication via CHCs. The detailed acclimatory changes of CHCs and how these influence their physical properties are still unknown. Here, we studied acclimation in two closely related ant species with distinct CHC profiles, Myrmica rubra and Myrmica ruginodis, in response to constant or fluctuating temperature and humidity regimes. We measured how acclimation affected CHC composition and viscosity, and the ants' drought survival. In both species, CHC composition showed strong, predictable responses to temperature regimes. Warm-acclimated individuals had higher proportions of linear alkanes, and less methyl-branched or unsaturated CHCs. These changes coincided with higher solid content and viscosity of CHCs in warm-acclimated ants. Temperature fluctuation caused effects similar to those observed under constant-cool conditions in M. rubra, but led to entirely different profiles in M. ruginodis, suggesting that fluctuating and constant conditions pose very different challenges. Acclimation to dry conditions led to higher absolute amounts of CHCs, which increased the ants' drought survival, whereas temperature acclimation did not. Hence, the temperature-induced CHC changes cannot be explained by the need for waterproofing alone. Although these changes could be non-adaptive, we propose that they serve to maintain a constant CHC viscosity, which may be essential for communication and other functions.",2018,221,9,NA
Flight metabolic rate of <i>Locusta migratoria</i> in relation to oxygen partial pressure in atmospheres of varying diffusivity and density,"Snelling, Edward P. and Duncker, Rebecca and Jones, Karl K. and Fagan-Jeffries, Erinn P. and Seymour, Roger S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.168187,"Flying insects have the highest mass-specific metabolic rate of all animals. Oxygen is supplied to the flight muscles by a combination of diffusion and convection along the internal air-filled tubes of the tracheal system. This study measured maximum flight metabolic rate (FMR) during tethered flight in the migratory locust Locusta migratoria under varying oxygen partial pressure (P-O2) in background gas mixtures of nitrogen (N-2), sulfur hexafluoride (F-6) and helium (He), to vary O-2 diffusivity and gas mixture density independently. With N-2 as the sole background gas (normodiffusive-normodense), mass-independent FMR averaged 132 +/- 19 mW g-0.75 at normoxia (PO2 = 21 kPa), and was not limited by tracheal system conductance, because FMR did not increase in hyperoxia. However, FMR declined immediately with hypoxia, oxy-conforming nearly completely. Thus, the locust respiratory system is matched to maximum functional requirements, with little reserve capacity. With SF6 as the sole background gas (hypodiffusive-hyperdense), the shape of the relationship between FMR and PO2 was similar to that in N-2, except that FMR was generally lower (e.g. 24\% lower at normoxia). This appeared to be due to increased density of the gas mixture rather than decreased O-2 diffusivity, because hyperoxia did not reverse it. Normoxic FMR was not significantly different in He-SF6 (hyperdiffusive-normodense) compared with the N-2 background gas, and likewise there was no significant difference between FMR in SF6-He (normodiffusive-hyperdense) compared with the SF6 background gas. The results indicate that convection, not diffusion, is the main mechanism of O-2 delivery to the flight muscle of the locust when demand is high.",2017,220,23,4432-4439
Preconditioning in the reef-building coral <i>Pocillopora damicornis</i> and the potential for trans-generational acclimatization in coral larvae under future climate change conditions,"Putnam, Hollie M. and Gates, Ruth D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.123018,"Coral reefs are globally threatened by climate change-related ocean warming and ocean acidification (OA). To date, slow-response mechanisms such as genetic adaptation have been considered the major determinant of coral reef persistence, with little consideration of rapid-response acclimatization-mechanisms. These rapid mechanisms such as parental effects that can contribute to trans-generational acclimatization (e.g. epigenetics) have, however, been identified as important contributors to offspring response in other systems. We present the first evidence of parental effects in a cross-generational exposure to temperature and OA in reef-building corals. Here, we exposed adults to high (28.9 degrees C, 805 mu atm P-CO2) or ambient (26.5 degrees C, 417 mu atm P-CO2) temperature and OA treatments during the larval brooding period. Exposure to high treatment negatively affected adult performance, but their larvae exhibited size differences and metabolic acclimation when subsequently re-exposed, unlike larvae from parents exposed to ambient conditions. Understanding the innate capacity corals possess to respond to current and future climatic conditions is essential to reef protection and maintenance. Our results identify that parental effects may have an important role through (1) ameliorating the effects of stress through preconditioning and adaptive plasticity, and/or (2) amplifying the negative parental response through latent effects on future life stages. Whether the consequences of parental effects and the potential for trans-generational acclimatization are beneficial or maladaptive, our work identifies a critical need to expand currently proposed climate change outcomes for corals to further assess rapid response mechanisms that include non-genetic inheritance through parental contributions and classical epigenetic mechanisms.",2015,218,15,2365-2372
Specialist-generalist model of body temperature regulation can be applied at the intraspecific level,"Przybylska, Anna S. and Boratynski, Jan S. and Wojciechowski, Michal S. and Jefimow, Malgorzata",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.160150,"According to theoretical predictions, endothermic homeotherms can be classified as either thermal specialists or thermal generalists. In high cost environments, thermal specialists are supposed to be more prone to using facultative heterothermy than generalists. We tested this hypothesis at the intraspecific level using male laboratory mice (C57BL/cmdb) fasted under different thermal conditions (20 and 10 degrees C) and for different time periods (12-48 h). We predicted that variability of body temperature (T-b) and time spent with T-b below normothermy would increase with the increase of environmental demands (duration of fasting and cold). To verify the above prediction, we measured T-b and energy expenditure of fasted mice. We did not record torpor bouts but we found that variations in T-b and time spent in hypothermia increased with environmental demands. In response to fasting, mice also decreased their energy expenditure. Moreover, animals that showed more precise thermoregulation when fed had more variable T-b when fasted. We postulate that the prediction of the thermoregulatory generalist-specialist trade-off can be applied at the intraspecific level, offering a valid tool for identifying mechanistic explanations of the differences in animal responses to variations in energy supply.",2017,220,13,2380-2386
Thermal constraints on exercise and metabolic performance do not explain the use of dormancy as an overwintering strategy in the cunner (Tautogolabrus adspersus),"Rowsey, Lauren E. and Reeve, Connor and Savoy, Tyler and Speers-Roesch, Ben",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.246741,"Winter cold slows ectotherm physiology, potentially constraining activities and ecological opportunities at poleward latitudes. Yet, many fishes are winter -active, facilitated by thermal compensation that improves cold performance. Conversely, winter -dormant fishes (e.g. cunner, Tautogolabrus adspersus) become inactive and nonfeeding overwinter. Why are certain fishes winter -dormant? We hypothesized that winter dormancy is an adaptive behavioural response arising in poleward species that tolerate severe, uncompensated constraints of cold on their physiological performance. We predicted that below their dormancy threshold of 7-8 degrees C, exercise and metabolic performance of cunner are greatly decreased, even after acclimation (i.e. shows above -normal, uncompensated thermal sensitivity, Q(10)>1-3). We measured multiple key performance metrics (e.g. C -start maximum velocity, chase swimming speed, aerobic scope) in cunner after acute exposure to 26-2 degrees C (3 degrees C intervals using 14 degrees C -acclimated fish) or acclimation (5-8 weeks) to 14-2 degrees C (3 degrees C intervals bracketing the dormancy threshold). Performance declined with cooling, and the acute Q10 of all six performance rate metrics was significantly greater below the dormancy threshold temperature (Q(10),acute8-2 degrees C=1.5-4.9, mean=3.3) than above (Q(10),acute14-8 degrees C=1.1-1.9, mean=1.5), inferring a cold constraint. However, 2 degrees C acclimation (temporally more relevant to seasonal cooling) improved performance, abolishing the acute constraint (Q(10),acclimated8-2 degrees C=1.4-3.0, mean=2.0; also cf. Q(10),acclimated14-8 degrees C=1.2-2.9, mean=1.7). Thus, dormant cunner show partial cold -compensation of exercise and metabolic performance, similar to winter -active species. However, responsiveness to C -start stimuli was greatly cold -constrained even following acclimation, suggesting dormancy involves sensory limitation. Thermal constraints on metabolic and exercise physiology are not significant drivers of winter dormancy in cunner. In fact, compensatory plasticity at frigid temperatures is retained even in a dormant fish.",2024,227,1,NA
How modularity and heterotrophy complicate the understanding of the causes of thermal performance curves: the case of feeding rate in a filter-feeding animal,"Powell, Jackson A. and Burgess, Scott C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.247776,"Warming global temperatures have consequences for biological rates. Feeding rates reflect the intake of energy that fuels survival, growth and reproduction. However, temperature can also affect food abundance and quality, as well as feeding behavior, which all affect feeding rate, making it challenging to understand the pathways by which temperature affects the intake of energy. Therefore, we experimentally assessed how clearance rate varied across a thermal gradient in a filter -feeding colonial marine invertebrate (the bryozoan Bugula neritina ). We also assessed how temperature affects phytoplankton as a food source, and zooid states within a colony that affect energy budgets and feeding behavior. Clearance rate increased linearly from 18 degrees C to 32 degrees C, a temperature range that the population experiences most of the year. However, temperature increased algal cell size, and decreased the proportion of feeding zooids, suggesting indirect effects of temperature on clearance rates. Temperature increased polypide regression, possibly as a stress response because satiation occurred quicker, or because phytoplankton quality declined. Temperature had a greater effect on clearance rate per feeding zooid than it did per total zooids. Together, these results suggest that the effect of temperature on clearance rate at the colony level is not just the outcome of individual zooids feeding more in direct response to temperature but also emerges from temperature increasing polypide regression and the remaining zooids increasing their feeding rates in response. Our study highlights some of the challenges for understanding why temperature affects feeding rates, especially for understudied, yet ecologically important, marine colonial organisms.",2024,227,12,NA
Smaller body size under warming is not due to gill-oxygen limitation in a cold-water salmonid,"Lonthair, Joshua K. and Wegner, Nicholas C. and Cheng, Brian S. and Fangue, Nann A. and O'Donnell, Matthew J. and Regish, Amy M. and Swenson, John D. and Argueta, Estefany and Mccormick, Stephen D. and Letcher, Benjamin H. and Komoroske, Lisa M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.246477,"Declining body size in fishes and other aquatic ectotherms associated with anthropogenic climate warming has significant implications for future fisheries yields, stock assessments and aquatic ecosystem stability. One proposed mechanism seeking to explain such body -size reductions, known as the gill oxygen limitation (GOL) hypothesis, has recently been used to model future impacts of climate warming on fisheries but has not been robustly empirically tested. We used brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), a fast-growing, cold -water salmonid species of broad economic, conservation and ecological value, to examine the GOL hypothesis in a long-term experiment quantifying effects of temperature on growth, resting metabolic rate (RMR), maximum metabolic rate (MMR) and gill surface area (GSA). Despite significantly reduced growth and body size at an elevated temperature, allometric slopes of GSA were not significantly different than 1.0 and were above those for RMR and MMR at both temperature treatments (15 degrees C and 20 degrees C), contrary to GOL expectations. We also found that the effect of temperature on RMR was time -dependent, contradicting the prediction that heightened temperatures increase metabolic rates and reinforcing the importance of longer -term exposures (e.g. >6 months) to fully understand the influence of acclimation on temperature-metabolic rate relationships. Our results indicate that although oxygen limitation may be important in some aspects of temperature-body size relationships and constraints on metabolic supply may contribute to reduced growth in some cases, it is unlikely that GOL is a universal mechanism explaining temperature-body size relationships in aquatic ectotherms. We suggest future research focus on alternative mechanisms underlying temperature-body size relationships, and that projections of climate change impacts on fisheries yields using models based on GOL assumptions be interpreted with caution.",2024,227,4,NA

Although it is clear that sudden and extreme temperatures can damage reproductive processes, there is limited understanding of the effects of heatwaves on male mating behaviour and reproductive success. We tested for the effects of heat stress induced by ecologically relevant heatwaves (33 degrees C and 39 degrees C for five consecutive days) on the mating behaviour, reproductive success, body mass and survival of male field crickets Gryllus bimaculatus, paired with untreated females. We predicted life -history and reproductive costs would increase with increasing heatwave intensity. Consistent with our expectations, males exposed to the highest heatwave temperature produced the fewest offspring, while having to increase courtship effort to successfully mate. Males also gained relatively more weight following heatwave exposure. Given that we found no difference in lifetime survival, our results suggest a potential trade-off in resource allocation between somatic maintenance and reproductive investment. Taken together, our findings indicate that sublethal effects of heatwaves could reduce the growth and persistence of animal populations by negatively impacting reproductive rates. These findings highlight the need for considering thermal ecologies, life history and behaviour to better understand the consequences of extreme climatic events on individuals and populations.",2024,227,6,NA
Oxidative stress effects are not correlated with differences in heat tolerance among congeners of <i>Mytilus</i>,"Dowd, W. Wesley and Somero, George N.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.246033,"The physiological mechanisms that limit thermal tolerance are broadly relevant to comparative biology and global change. Species differences in macromolecular stability play important roles in evolved patterns of heat tolerance, but other mechanisms such as oxidative stress have also been hypothesized to contribute. For example, mussels in the genus Mytilus exhibit evolved physiological differences at several levels of organization that have been linked with interspecific differences in whole-organism heat tolerance. Both omics and behavioral studies suggested that variation in resistance to oxidative stress plays a role in these differences. Functional data are needed to test this hypothesis. Here, we compared three Mytilus congeners to examine whether susceptibility to oxidative stress contributes to acute heat tolerance. We assayed the activity of two antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase), as well as levels of oxidative damage to lipids, DNA and individual proteins (using gel-based proteomics methods). In addition, we assessed these oxidative stress responses after repeated episodes of heat stress experienced in air or while immersed in seawater, given that survival and competitive outcomes between Mytilus congeners differ in these two contexts. The results are generally inconsistent with patterns that would be expected if oxidative stress contributes to thermal sensitivity. Rather, the more heat-tolerant congeners suffer comparable or even elevated levels of oxidative damage. As predicted, different treatment contexts led to distinct changes in proteome-wide abundance patterns and, to a lesser extent, protein carbonylation profiles. Overall, the results question the relevance of oxidative damage as a mediator of heat tolerance in this genus.",2023,226,15,NA
Physiological responses to acute warming at the agitation temperature in a temperate shark,"Bouyoucos, Ian A. and Weinrauch, Alyssa M. and Jeffries, Ken M. and Anderson, W. Gary",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.246304,"Thermal tolerance and associated mechanisms are often tested via the critical thermal maximum (CTmax). The agitation temperature is a recently described thermal limit in fishes that has received little mechanistic evaluation. The present study used a temperate elasmobranch fish to test the hypothesis that this thermal tolerance trait is partially set by the onset of declining cardiorespiratory performance and the cellular stress response. Pacific spiny dogfish (Squalus suckleyi) were screened for cardiorespiratory and whole-organism thermal limits to test for associations between thermal performance and tolerance. Then, biochemical markers of secondary stress, aerobic and anaerobic enzyme activities, and molecular markers of cellular stress were determined for various tissues at the agitation temperature and secondary stress markers were determined at CTmax. In dogfish, the agitation temperature was characterised by increased turning activity within experimental chambers and was equal to the temperature at which dogfish exhibited maximum heart rate. Citrate synthase activity increased at the agitation temperature in white muscle relative to unmanipulated dogfish. Furthermore, lactate dehydrogenase activity and accumulated lactate in the plasma and muscle were not affected by acute warming. Cellular stress was apparent in hypothalamus, gill filament and ventricle, denoted by elevated transcript abundance of the stress response gene hsp70 but not the oxygen homeostasis gene hif1 alpha. Conversely, CTmax was characterised by metabolic acidosis driven by anaerobic lactate production, signifying an increased reliance on anaerobic metabolism between the agitation temperature and CTmax. Together, these data provide partial support for our hypothesis, in that cellular stress, but not declining thermal performance, occurred at the agitation temperature.",2023,226,19,NA

Righting response, locomotion and disc tenacity decreased in response to hyposalinity. Severe reductions in coordinated tube foot activities occurred at higher salinities than those that affected adhesion. The results of this study suggest moderate hyposalinities (24-28\%o) have little effect on S. droebachiensis dislodgement risk and survival post-dislodgment, while severe hyposalinity (below 24\%o) likely reduces movement and prevents recovery from dislodgment.",2023,226,13,NA
Prey consumption does not restore hydration state but mitigates the energetic costs of water deprivation in an insectivorous lizard,"Chabaud, Chloe and Brusch, George A. and Pellerin, Anouk and Lourdais, Olivier and Le Galliard, Jean-Francois",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.246129,"To cope with limited availability of drinking water in their environment, terrestrial animals have developed numerous behavioral and physiological strategies including maintaining an optimal hydration state through dietary water intake. Recent studies performed in snakes, which are generalist carnivorous reptiles, suggest that the benefits of dietary water intake are negated by hydric costs of digestion. Most lizards are generalist insectivores that can shift their prey types, but firm experimental demonstration of dietary water intake is currently missing in these organisms. Here, we performed an experimental study in the common lizard Zootoca vivipara, a keystone mesopredator from temperate climates exhibiting a great diversity of prey in its mesic habitats, in order to investigate the effects of food consumption and prey type on physiological responses to water deprivation. Our results indicate that common lizards cannot improve their hydration state through prey consumption, irrespective of prey type, suggesting that they are primarily dependent upon drinking water. Yet, high-quality prey consumption reduced the energetic costs of water deprivation, potentially helping lizards to conserve a better body condition during periods of limited water availability. These findings have important implications for understanding the physiological responses of ectotherms to water stress, and highlight the complex interactions between hydration status, energy metabolism and feeding behavior in insectivorous lizards.",2023,226,17,NA
Does the New Zealand rockwren (<i>Xenicus gilviventris</i>) hibernate?,"McNab, Brian K. and Weston, Kerry A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.212126,"In this study, we examined the thermal physiology of the endangered New Zealand rockwren (Xenicus gilviventris), a member of the Acanthisittidae, a family unique to New Zealand. This family, derived from Gondwana, is thought to be the sister taxon to all other passerines. Rockwrens permanently reside above the climatic timberline at altitudes from 1000 to 2900 m in the mountains of South Island. They feed on invertebrates and in winter face ambient temperatures far below freezing and deep deposits of snow. Their body temperature and rate of metabolism are highly variable. The rockwrens in our study regulated their body temperature at ca. 36.4 degrees C, which in one individual decreased to 33.1 degrees C at an ambient temperature of 9.4 degrees C; its rate of metabolism decreased by 30\% and its body temperature then spontaneously returned to 36 degrees C. The rate of metabolism in a second individual twice decreased by 35\%, nearly to the basal rate expected from its mass without a decrease in body temperature. The New Zealand rockwren's food habits, entrance into torpor and continuous residence in a thermally demanding environment suggest that it may hibernate. However, for that conclusion to be accepted, evidence of its use of torpor for extended periods is required. Acanthisittids are distinguished from other passerines by the combination of their permanent temperate distribution, thermal flexibility and a propensity to evolve a flightless condition. These characteristics may principally reflect their geographical isolation in a temperate environment isolated from Gondwana for 82 million years in the absence of mammalian predators.",2020,223,9,NA

We generated a model of cardiac taurine deficiency (TD) by feeding brook char (Salvelinus fontinalis) a diet enriched in beta-alanine, which inhibits cardiomyocyte taurine uptake. Cardiac taurine levels were reduced by 21\% and stress-induced changes in normal taurine handling were observed in TD brook char. Responses to exhaustive exercise and acute thermal and hypoxia tolerance were then assessed using a combination of in vivo, in vitro and biochemical approaches. Critical thermal maximum was higher in TD brook char despite significant reductions in maximum heart rate. In vivo, TD brook char exhibited a lower resting heart rate, blunted hypoxic bradycardia and a severe reduction in time to loss of equilibrium under hypoxia. In vitro function was similar between control and TD hearts under oxygenated conditions, but stroke volume and cardiac output were severely compromised in TD hearts under severe hypoxia. Aspects of mitochondrial structure and function were also impacted in TD permeabilized cardiomyocytes, but overall effects were modest. High levels of intracellular taurine are required to achieve maximum cardiac function in brook char and cardiac taurine efflux may be necessary to support heart function under stress.

Thermal analysis of ice and glass transitions in insects that do and do not survive freezing,"Rozsypal, Jan and Moos, Martin and Simek, Petrs and Kostal, Vladimir",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.170464,"Some insects rely on the strategy of freeze tolerance for winter survival. During freezing, extracellular body water transitions from the liquid to the solid phase and cells undergo freeze-induced dehydration. Here, we present results of a thermal analysis (from differential scanning calorimetry) of ice fraction dynamics during gradual cooling after inoculative freezing in variously acclimated larvae of two drosophilid flies, Drosophila melanogaster and Chymomyza costata. Although the species and variants ranged broadly between 0 and close to 100\% survival of freezing, there were relatively small differences in ice fraction dynamics. For instance, the maximum ice fraction (IFmax) ranged between 67.9\% and 77.7\% total body water (TBW). Chymomyza costata larvae showed statistically significant phenotypic shifts in parameters of ice fraction dynamics (melting point and IFmax) upon entry into diapause, cold acclimation and feeding on a proline augmented diet. These differences were mostly driven by colligative effects of accumulated proline (ranging between 6 and 487 mmol kg(-1) TBW) and other metabolites. Our data suggest that these colligative effects per se do not represent a sufficient mechanistic explanation for high freeze tolerance observed in diapausing, cold-acclimated C. costata larvae. Instead, we hypothesize that accumulated proline exerts its protective role via a combination of mechanisms. Specifically, we found a tight association between proline-induced stimulation of glass transition in partially frozen body liquids (vitrification) and survival of cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen.",2018,221,7,NA
Oxygen dependence of upper thermal limits in fishes,"Ern, Rasmus and Norin, Tommy and Gamperl, A. Kurt and Esbaugh, Andrew J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.143495,"Temperature-induced limitations on the capacity of the cardiorespiratory system to transport oxygen from the environment to the tissues, manifested as a reduced aerobic scope (maximum minus standard metabolic rate), have been proposed as the principal determinant of the upper thermal limits of fishes and other water-breathing ectotherms. Consequently, the upper thermal niche boundaries of these animals are expected to be highly sensitive to aquatic hypoxia and other environmental stressors that constrain their cardiorespiratory performance. However, the generality of this dogma has recently been questioned, as some species have been shown to maintain aerobic scope at thermal extremes. Here, we experimentally tested whether reduced oxygen availability due to aquatic hypoxia would decrease the upper thermal limits (i.e. the critical thermal maximum, CTmax) of the estuarine red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) and the marine lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus). In both species, CTmax was independent of oxygen availability over a wide range of oxygen levels despite substantial (>72\%) reductions in aerobic scope. These data show that the upper thermal limits of water-breathing ectotherms are not always linked to the capacity for oxygen transport. Consequently, we propose a novel metric for classifying the oxygen dependence of thermal tolerance; the oxygen limit for thermal tolerance (P-CTmax), which is the water oxygen tension (Pw(O2)) where an organism's CTmax starts to decline. We suggest that this metric can be used for assessing the oxygen sensitivity of upper thermal limits in water-breathing ectotherms, and the susceptibility of their upper thermal niche boundaries to environmental hypoxia.",2016,219,21,3376-3383
Phenotypic flexibility of metabolic rate and evaporative water loss does not vary across a climatic gradient in an Afrotropical passerine bird,"Noakes, Matthew J. and McKechnie, Andrew E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.220137,"Small birds inhabiting northern temperate and boreal latitudes typically increase metabolic rates during cold winters or acclimation to low air temperatures (T-accl). Recent studies suggest considerable variation in patterns of seasonal metabolic acclimatization in birds from subtropical and tropical regions with milder winters, but there remains a dearth of acclimation studies investigating metabolic flexibility among lower-latitude birds. We used short-term thermal acclimation experiments to investigate phenotypic flexibility in basal metabolic rate (BMR), thermoneutral evaporative water loss (EWL) and summit metabolism (M-sum) in three populations of white-browed sparrow-weavers (Plocepasser mahali) along a climatic and aridity gradient. We allocated individuals to one of three Taccl treatments (5, 20 and 35 degrees C; n=11 per population per T-accl) for 28 days, and measured post-acclimation BMR, EWL and Msum using flow-through respirometry. Our data reveal the expected pattern of lower BMR and EWL (similar to 12\% and 25\% lower, respectively) in birds at T-accl=35 degrees C compared with cooler T-accl treatments, as observed in previous acclimation studies on subtropical birds. We found no variation in the reaction norms of BMR and EWL among populations in response to acclimation, suggesting previously documented differences in seasonal BMR acclimatization are the result of phenotypic flexibility. In contrast to higher-latitude species, M-sum did not significantly vary in response to thermal acclimation. These findings support the idea that factors other than enhancing cold tolerance may be driving patterns of metabolic variation in subtropical birds.",2020,223,7,NA
"Temperature and dehydration effects on metabolism, water uptake and the partitioning between respiratory and cutaneous evaporative water loss in a terrestrial toad","Senzano, Luis Miguel and Andrade, Denis Vieira",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.188482,"Terrestrial anurans often experience fluctuations in body temperature and hydration state, which are known to influence evaporative water loss through the skin (EWLSkin) and lungs (EWLResp). These effects arises from associated changes in skin permeability, metabolism and lung ventilation. Herein, we determined the rates of EWLSkin and EWLResp in the terrestrial toad, Rhinella diptycha at different temperatures and hydration states. We measured oxygen uptake rates to verify whether alterations in the partitioning between EWLSkin and EWLResp were associated to metabolic induced changes in pulmonary gas exchange. We also measured the influence of hydration and temperature on water uptake (WU) through the skin. Finally, since estimates of skin resistance to evaporation (R-s) are usually inferred from total evaporative water loss (EWLTotal), under the assumption of negligible EWLResp, we calculate the potential error in accepting this assumption, under different temperature and hydration states. EWLSkin and EWLResp increased with temperature, but this response was greater for EWLResp, which was attributed to the temperature-induced elevation in metabolism and lung ventilation. Dehydration caused a decrease in the relative contribution of EWLSkin to EWLTotal, mirrored by the concurrent increase in the contribution of EWLResp, at all temperatures. Thus, R-s increased with dehydration. WU rates were dictated by dehydration with little influence of temperature. The partitioning between EWLSkin and EWLResp was affected by both temperature and hydration state and, under some set of conditions, considering EWLResp as negligible led to significant errors in the assessment of skin resistance to evaporation.",2018,221,24,NA
Effect of body mass and melanism on heat balance in <i>Liolaemus</i> lizards of the <i>goetschi</i> clade,"Moreno Azocar, Debora Lina and Fabian Bonino, Marcelo and Gabriela Perotti, Maria and Schulte, II, James A. and Simon Abdala, Cristian and Benjamin Cruz, Felix",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.129007,"The body temperature of ectotherms depends on the environmental temperatures and behavioral adjustments, but morphology may also have an effect. For example, in colder environments, animals tend to be larger and to show higher thermal inertia, as proposed by Bergmann's rule and the heat balance hypothesis (HBH). Additionally, dark coloration increases solar radiation absorption and should accelerate heat gain (thermal melanism hypothesis, TMH). We tested Bergmann's rule, the HBH and the TMH within the Liolaemus goetschi lizard clade, which shows variability in body size and melanic coloration. We measured heating and cooling rates of live and euthanized animals, and tested how morphology and color affect these rates. Live organisms show less variable and faster heating rates compared with cooling rates, suggesting behavioral and/or physiological adjustments. Our results support Bergmann's rule and the HBH, as larger species show slower heating and cooling rates. However, we did not find a clear pattern to support the TMH. The influence of dorsal melanism on heating by radiation was masked by the body size effect in live animals, and results from euthanized individuals also showed no clear effects of melanism on heating rates. Comparison among three groups of live individuals with different degrees of melanism did not clarify the influence of melanism on heating rates. However, when euthanized animals from the same three groups were compared, we observed that darker euthanized animals actually heat faster than lighter ones, favoring the TMH. Although unresolved aspects remain, body size and coloration influenced heat exchange, suggesting complex thermoregulatory strategies in these lizards, probably regulated through physiology and behavior, which may allow these small lizards to inhabit harsh weather environments.",2016,219,8,1162-1171
Early life experience drives short-term acclimation of metabolic and osmoregulatory traits in the leaf-eared mouse,"Cavieres, Grisel and Nunez-Villegas, Monica and Bozinovic, Francisco and Sabat, Pablo",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.149997,"We studied the putative effect of early life experience on the physiological flexibility of metabolic and osmoregulatory traits in the leaf-eared mouse, Phyllotis darwini, an altricial rodent inhabiting seasonal Mediterranean environments. Adult individuals were collected in central Chile and maintained in breeding pairs. Pups were isolated after weaning and acclimated to different temperatures (cold or warm) and water availability (unrestricted and restricted) until adulthood. Subsequently, individuals were re-acclimated to the opposite treatment. Rodents reared in the warm and subjected to water restriction had lower basal metabolic rate (BMR), total evaporative water loss (TEWL) and body mass (M-b) compared with those developing in the cold treatment; nevertheless, individuals subjected to warm temperatures had greater relative medullary thickness (RMT) and urine concentrating ability (UCA). Cold-reared rodents re-acclimated to warm conditions exhibited physiological flexibility of metabolic traits; however, their osmoregulatory attributes did not vary. Conversely, warm-reared rodents re-acclimated to cold had reduced RMT and UCA, but the metabolic traits of these individuals did not change. These results suggest a trade-off between metabolic performance and renal capabilities that might hinder physiological acclimation. Our results support the hypothesis of ontogenetic dependence of short-term acclimation in osmoregulatory and metabolic traits in P. darwini.",2017,220,14,2626-2634
Physiological mechanisms constraining ectotherm fright-dive performance at elevated temperatures,"Rodgers, Essie M. and Franklin, Craig E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.155440,"Survival of air-breathing, diving ectotherms is dependent on their capacity to optimise the time available for obligate underwater activities, such as predator avoidance. Submergence times are thermally sensitive, with dive durations significantly reduced by increases in water temperature, deeming these animals particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The physiological mechanisms underlying this compromised performance are unclear but are hypothesised to be linked to increased oxygen demand and a reduced capacity for metabolic depression at elevated temperatures. Here, we investigated how water temperature (both acute and chronic exposures) affected the physiology of juvenile estuarine crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) performing predator avoidance dives (i.e. fright-dives). Diving oxygen consumption, `fright' bradycardia, haematocrit and haemoglobin (indicators of blood oxygen carrying capacity) were assessed at two test temperatures, reflective of different climate change scenarios (i.e. current summer water temperatures, 28 degrees C, and `high' climate warming, 34 degrees C). Diving oxygen consumption rate increased threefold between 28 and 34 degrees C (Q(10)=7.4). The capacity to depress oxygen demand was reduced at elevated temperatures, with animals lowering oxygen demand from surface levels by 52.9 +/- 27.8\% and 27.8 +/- 16.5\% (means +/- s.e.m.) at 28 degrees C and 34 degrees C, respectively. Resting and post-fright-dive haematocrit and haemoglobin were thermally insensitive. Together these findings suggest decrements in fright-dive performance at elevated temperatures stem from increased oxygen demand coupled with a reduced capacity for metabolic depression.",2017,220,19,3556-3564
Bearded dragons (<i>Pogona</i> <i>vitticeps</i>) with reduced scalation lose water faster but do not have substantially different thermal preferences,"Sakich, Nicholas B. and Tattersall, Glenn J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.234427,"Whether scales reduce cutaneous evaporative water loss in lepidosaur reptiles (Superorder Lepidosauria) such as lizards and snakes has been a contentious issue for nearly half a century. Furthermore, while many studies have looked at whether dehydration affects thermal preference in lepidosaurs, far fewer have examined whether normally hydrated lepidosaurs can assess their instantaneous rate of evaporative water loss and adjust their thermal preference to compensate in an adaptive manner. We tested both of these hypotheses using three captive-bred phenotypes of bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps) sourced from the pet trade: `wild-types' with normal scalation, `leatherbacks' exhibiting scales of reduced prominence, and scaleless bearded dragons referred to as `silkbacks'. Silkbacks on average lost water evaporatively at about twice the rate that wild-types did. Leatherbacks on average were closer in their rates of evaporative water loss to silkbacks than they were to wild-types. Additionally, very small (at most similar to 1 degrees C) differences in thermal preference existed between the three phenotypes thatwere not statistically significant. This suggests a lack of plasticity in thermal preference in response to an increase in the rate of evaporative water loss, and may be reflective of a thermal `strategy' as employed by thermoregulating bearded dragons that prioritises immediate thermal benefits over the threat of future dehydration. The results of this study bolster an often-discounted hypothesis regarding the present adaptive function of scales and have implications for the applied fields of animal welfare and conservation.",2021,224,12,NA
Effects of elevated <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> and feeding on net calcification and energy budget of the Mediterranean cold-water coral <i>Madrepora oculata</i>,"Maier, Cornelia and Popp, Pauline and Sollfrank, Nicole and Weinbauer, Markus G. and Wild, Christian and Gattuso, Jean-Pierre",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.127159,"Ocean acidification is a major threat to calcifying marine organisms such as deep-sea cold-water corals (CWCs), but related knowledge is scarce. The aragonite saturation threshold (Omega(a)) for calcification, respiration and organic matter fluxes were investigated experimentally in the Mediterranean Madrepora oculata. Over 10 weeks, colonies were maintained under two feeding regimes (uptake of 36.75 and 7.46 mu mol C polyp(-1) week(-1)) and exposed in 2 week intervals to a consecutively changing air-CO2 mix (pCO(2)) of 400, 1600, 800, 2000 and 400 ppm. There was a significant effect of feeding on calcification at initial ambient pCO(2), while with consecutive pCO(2) treatments, feeding had no effect on calcification. Respiration was not significantly affected by feeding or pCO(2) levels. Coral skeletons started to dissolve at an average Omega(a) threshold of 0.92, but recovered and started to calcify again at Omega(a)>= 1. The surplus energy required to counteract dissolution at elevated pCO2 (>= 1600 mu atm) was twice that at ambient pCO(2). Yet, feeding had no mitigating effect at increasing pCO(2) levels. This could be due to the fact that the energy required for calcification is a small fraction (1-3\%) of the total metabolic energy demand and corals even under low food conditions might therefore still be able to allocate this small portion of energy to calcification. The response and resistance to ocean acidification are consequently not controlled by feeding in this species, but more likely by chemical reactions at the site of calcification and exchange processes between the calicoblastic layer and ambient seawater.",2016,219,20,3208-3217
Effects of chronic exposure to 12parts per thousand saltwater on the endocrine physiology of juvenile American alligator (<i>Alligator mississippiensis</i>),"Faulkner, P. C. and Burleson, M.

H.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.181172,"American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) habitats are prone to saltwater intrusion following major storms, hurricanes or droughts. Anthropogenic impacts affecting hydrology of freshwater systems may exacerbate saltwater intrusion into freshwater habitats. The endocrine system of alligators is susceptible to changes in the environment but it is currently not known how the crocodilian physiological system responds to environmental stressors such as salinity. Juvenile alligators were exposed to 12\%o saltwater for 5 weeks to determine the effects of chronic exposure to saline environments. Following 5 weeks, plasma levels of hormones {[}e.g. progesterone, testosterone, estradiol, corticosterone, aldosterone (ALDO), angiotensin II (ANG II)] were quantified using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Compared with freshwater-kept subjects, saltwater-exposed alligators had significantly elevated plasma levels of corticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol, 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, testosterone, 17 beta-estradiol, estrone and estriol whereas pregnenolone and ANG II were significantly depressed and ALDO levels were unchanged (slightly depressed). On the one hand, saltwater exposure did not affect gene expression of renal mineralocorticoid and glucorticoid and angiotensin type 1 (AT-1) receptors or morphology of lingual glands. On the other hand, saltwater exposure significantly reduced plasma glucose concentrations whereas parameters diagnostic of perturbed liver function (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) and kidney function (creatinine and creatine kinase) were significantly elevated. Except for plasma potassium levels (K+), plasma ions Na+ and Cl(- )were significantly elevated in saltwater alligators. Overall, this study demonstrated significant endocrine and physiological effects in juvenile alligators chronically exposed to a saline environment.

Differing thermal sensitivities of physiological processes alter ATP allocation,"Pan, Francis T. C. and Applebaum, Scott L. and Manahan, Donal T.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.233379,"Changes in environmental temperature affect rate processes at all levels of biological organization. Yet the thermal sensitivity of specific physiological processes that affect allocation of the ATP pool within a species is less well understood. In this study of developmental stages of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, thermal sensitivities were measured for growth, survivorship, protein synthesis, respiration and transport of amino acids and ions. At warmer temperatures, larvae grew faster but suffered increased mortality. An analysis of temperature sensitivity (Q(10) values) revealed that protein synthesis, the major ATP-consuming process in larvae of C. gigas, is more sensitive to temperature change (Q(10) value of 2.9 +/- 0.18) than metabolic rate (Q(10 )of 2.0 +/- 0.15). Ion transport by Na+/K+-ATPase measured in vivo has a Q(10) value of 2.1 +/- 0.09. The corresponding value for glycine transport is 2.4 +/- 0.23. Differing thermal responses for protein synthesis and respiration result in a disproportional increase in the allocation of available ATP to protein synthesis with rising temperature. A bioenergetic model is presented illustrating how changes in growth and temperature affect allocation of the ATP pool. Over an environmentally relevant temperature range for this species, the proportion of the ATP pool allocated to protein synthesis increases from 35 to 65\%. The greater energy demand to support protein synthesis with increasing temperature will compromise energy availability to support other essential physiological processes. Defining the trade-offs of ATP demand will provide insights into understanding the adaptive capacity of organisms to respond to various scenarios of environmental change.",2021,224,2,NA

Fish in respirometers and those free-swimming were also exposed to a stepwise decrease in water oxygen level (100\% to 30\% air saturation) to determine the oxygen level at which bradycardia occurred. Resting f(H) was much lower in free-swimming fish than in those in respirometers (similar to 49 versus 69 beats min(-1)) and this was reflected in their scope for f(H) (similar to 104 versus 71 beats min(-1)) and CTmax (27.7 versus 25.9 degrees C). Further, the Arrhenius breakpoint temperature and temperature at peak f(H) for free-swimming fish were considerably greater than for those tested in the respirometers and given a rapid screening protocol (18.4, 18.1 and 14.6 degrees C; and 26.5, 23.2 and 20.2 degrees C, respectively). Finally, the oxygen level at which bradycardia occurred was significantly higher in free-swimming salmon than in those in respirometers (similar to 62\% versus 53\% air saturation). These results: highlight the limitations of some lab-based methods of determining f(H) parameters and thermal tolerance in fishes; and suggest that scope for f(H) may be a more reliable and predictive measure of a fish's upper thermal tolerance than their peak f(H).",2023,226,18,NA
Temperature has a causal and plastic effect on timing of breeding in a small songbird,"Verhagen, Irene and Tomotani, Barbara M. and Gienapp, Phillip and Visser, Marcel E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.218784,"Phenotypic plasticity is an important mechanism by which an individual can adapt its seasonal timing to predictable, short-term environmental changes by using predictive cues. Identification of these cues is crucial to forecast the response of species to long-term environmental change and to study their potential to adapt. Individual great tits (Parus major) start reproduction early under warmer conditions in the wild, but whether this effect is causal is not well known. We housed 36 pairs of great tits in climate-controlled aviaries and 40 pairs in outdoor aviaries, where they bred under artificial contrasting temperature treatments or in semi-natural conditions, respectively, for two consecutive years, using birds from lines selected for early and late egg laying. We thus obtained laying dates in two different thermal environments for each female. Females bred earlier under warmer conditions in climate-controlled aviaries, but not in outdoor aviaries. The latter was inconsistent with laying dates from our wild population. Further, early selection line females initiated egg laying consistently similar to 9 days earlier than late selection line females in outdoor aviaries, but we found no difference in the degree of plasticity (i.e. the sensitivity to temperature) in laying date between selection lines. Because we found that temperature causally affects laying date, climate change will lead to earlier laying. This advancement is, however, unlikely to be sufficient, thereby leading to selection for earlier laying. Our results suggest that natural selection may lead to a change in mean phenotype, but not to a change in the sensitivity of laying dates to temperature.",2020,223,8,NA

Using flow-through respirometry, we measured daytime resting metabolism, evaporativewater loss and body temperature at air temperatures (Tair) between 30 and 52 degrees C. We found marked increases in resting metabolism above the upper critical temperature (Tuc), which for six of the seven species fellwithin a relatively narrow range (36.2-39.7 degrees C), but which was considerably higher in the largest species, the curvebilled thrasher (42.6 degrees C). Resting metabolism and evaporative water loss were minimal below the Tuc and increased with Tair and body mass to maximum values among species of 0.38-1.62 Wand 0.87-4.02 g H2O h(-1), respectively. Body temperature reached maximum values ranging from 43.5 to 45.3 degrees C. Evaporative cooling capacity, the ratio of evaporative heat loss to metabolic heat production, reached maximum values ranging from 1.39 to 2.06, consistent with known values for passeriforms and much lower than values in taxa such as columbiforms and caprimulgiforms. These maximum values occurred at heat tolerance limits that did not scale with body mass among species, but were similar to 50 degrees C for all species except the pyrrhuloxia and Abert's towhee (48 degrees C). High metabolic costs associated with respiratory evaporation appeared to drive the limited heat tolerance in these desert passeriforms, compared with larger desert columbiforms and galliforms that use metabolically more efficient mechanisms of evaporative heat loss.",2017,220,18,3290-3300

We predicted that evaporative cooling in Burchell's sandgrouse (Pterocles burchelli) is highly efficient and provides the basis for tolerance of very high air temperature (T-a). We measured body temperature (T-b), resting metabolic rate (RMR) and evaporative water loss (EWL) at T-a between 25 degrees C and similar to 58 degrees C in birds exposed to successive increments in T-a. Normothermic T-b averaged 39.0 degrees C, lower than typical avian values. At T-a > 34.5 degrees C, T-b increased linearly to a maximum of 43.6 degrees C at T-a = 56 degrees C. The upper critical limit of thermoneutrality (T-uc) was T-a = 43.8 degrees C, closely coinciding with the onset of panting and gular flutter. Above the T-uc, RMR increased 2.5-fold to 2.89 W at T-a = 56 degrees C, a fractional increase far exceeding that of many other species under comparable conditions. Rates of EWL increased rapidly at T-a > 42.9 degrees C to 7.84 +/- 0.90 g h(-1) at T-a = 56 degrees C, an 11-fold increase above minimal levels. Maximum evaporative cooling efficiency (ratio of evaporative heat loss to metabolic heat production) was 2.03, but could be as high as 2.70 if our assumption that the birds were metabolising lipids is incorrect.

Despite recently documented population declines and range shifts of bumblebees (genus Bombus), the few measurements of thermal tolerance available for the group have relied on disparate measurement approaches. We describe a novel stereotypical behavior expressed by bumblebee individuals during entry into chill coma. This behavioral indicator of minimum critical temperature (CTmin) occurred at ambient temperatures of 3-5 degrees C (approximately 7-9 degrees C core temperatures) and was accompanied by a pronounced CO2 pulse, indicative of loss of spiracle function. Maximum critical temperature (CTmax) was indicated by the onset of muscular spasms prior to entering an unresponsive state and occurred at ambient temperatures of approximately 52-55 degrees C (42-44 degrees C core temperatures). Measurements of CTmin and CTmax were largely unaffected by acclimation, age or feeding status, but faster ramping rates significantly increased CTmax and decreased CTmin. This high-throughput approach allows rapid measurement of critical thermal limits for large numbers of individuals, facilitating large-scale comparisons among bumblebee populations and species - a key step in determining current and future effects of climate on these critical pollinators.",2018,221,8,NA
Why do ants differ in acclimatory ability? Biophysical mechanisms behind cuticular hydrocarbon acclimation across species,"Baumgart, Lucas and Wittke, Marti and Morsbach, Svenja and Abou, Berengere and Menzel, Florian",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.243847,"Maintaining water balance is vital for terrestrial organisms. Insects protect themselves against desiccation via cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs). CHC layers are complex mixtures of solid and liquid hydrocarbons, with a surprisingly diverse composition across species. This variation may translate into differential phase behaviour, and hence varying waterproofing capacity. This is especially relevant when temperatures change, which requires acclimatory CHC changes to maintain waterproofing. Nevertheless, the physical consequences of CHC variation are still little understood. We studied acclimatory responses and their consequences for CHC composition, phase behaviour and drought survival in three congeneric ant species. Colony sub-groups were kept under cool, warm and fluctuating temperature regimes. Lasius niger and Lasius platythorax, both of which are rich in methyl-branched alkanes, showed largely predictable acclimatory changes of the CHC profile. In both species, warm acclimation increased drought resistance. Warm acclimation increased the proportion of solid compounds in L. niger but not in L. platythorax. In both species, the CHC layer formed a liquid matrix of constantly low viscosity, which contained highly viscous and solid parts. This phase heterogeneity may be adaptive, increasing robustness to temperature fluctuations. In Lasius brunneus, which is rich in unsaturated hydrocarbons, acclimatory CHC changes were less predictable, and warm acclimation did not enhance drought survival. The CHC layer was more homogeneous, but matrix viscosity changed with acclimation. We showed that ant species use different physical mechanisms to enhance waterproofing during acclimation. Hence, the ability to acclimate, and thus climatic niche breadth, may strongly depend on species-specific CHC profile.",2022,225,16,NA
Experimental manipulations of tissue oxygen supply do not affect warming tolerance of European perch,"Brijs, Jeroen and Jutfelt, Fredrik and Clark, Timothy D. and Grans, Albin and Ekstrom, Andreas and Sandblom, Erik",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.121889,"A progressive inability of the cardiorespiratory system to maintain systemic oxygen supply at elevated temperatures has been suggested to reduce aerobic scope and the upper thermal limit of aquatic ectotherms. However, few studies have directly investigated the dependence of thermal limits on oxygen transport capacity. By manipulating oxygen availability (via environmental hyperoxia) and blood oxygen carrying capacity (via experimentally induced anaemia) in European perch (Perca fluviatilis Linneaus), we investigated the effects of oxygen transport capacity on aerobic scope and the critical thermal maximum (CTmax). Hyperoxia resulted in a twofold increase in aerobic scope at the control temperature of 23 degrees C, but this did not translate to an elevated CTmax in comparison with control fish (34.6 +/- 0.1 versus 34.0 +/- 0.5 degrees C, respectively). Anaemia (similar to 43\% reduction in haemoglobin concentration) did not cause a reduction in aerobic scope or CTmax (33.8 +/- 0.3 degrees C) compared with control fish. Additionally, oxygen consumption rates of anaemic perch during thermal ramping increased in a similar exponential manner to that in control fish, highlighting that perch have an impressive capacity to compensate for a substantial reduction in blood oxygen carrying capacity.

Skeletal muscle metabolism in sea-acclimatized king penguins. I. Thermogenic mechanisms,"Roussel, Damien and Le Coadic, Marion and Rouanet, Jean-Louis and Duchamp, Claude",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.233668,"At fledging, king penguin juveniles undergo a major energetic challenge to overcome the intense and prolonged energy demands for thermoregulation and locomotion imposed by life in cold seas. Among other responses, sea acclimatization triggers fuel selection in skeletal muscle metabolism towards lipid oxidation in vitro, which is reflected by a drastic increase in lipid-induced thermogenesis in vivo. However, the exact nature of skeletal muscle thermogenic mechanisms (shivering and/or non-shivering thermogenesis) remains undefined. The aim of the present study was to determine in vivo whether the capacity for non-shivering thermogenesis was enhanced by sea acclimatization. We measured body temperature, metabolic rate, heart rate and shivering activity in fully immersed king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) exposed to water temperatures ranging from 12 to 29 degrees C. Results from terrestrial pre-fledging juveniles were compared with those from sea-acclimatized immature penguins (hereafter `immatures'). The capacity for thermogenesis in water was as effective in juveniles as in immatures, while the capacity for nonshivering thermogenesis was not reinforced by sea acclimatization. This result suggests that king penguins mainly rely on skeletal muscle contraction (shivering or locomotor activity) to maintain endothermy at sea. Sea-acclimatized immature penguins also exhibited higher shivering efficiency and oxygen pulse (amount of oxygen consumed or energy expended per heartbeat) than pre-fledging juvenile birds. Such increase in shivering and cardiovascular efficiency may favor a more efficient activity-thermoregulatory heat substitution providing penguins with the aptitude to survive the tremendous energetic challenge imposed by marine life in cold circumpolar oceans.",2020,223,21,NA
Arginine and proline applied as food additives stimulate high freeze tolerance in larvae of <i>Drosophila</i> <i>melanogaster</i>,"Kostal, Vladimir and Korbelova, Jaroslava and Poupardin, Rodolphe and Moos, Martin and Simek, Petrs",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.142158,"The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is an insect of tropical origin. Its larval stage is evolutionarily adapted for rapid growth and development under warm conditions and shows high sensitivity to cold. In this study, we further developed an optimal acclimation and freezing protocol that significantly improves larval freeze tolerance (an ability to survive at -5 degrees C when most of the freezable fraction of water is converted to ice). Using the optimal protocol, freeze survival to adult stage increased from 0.7\% to 12.6\% in the larvae fed standard diet (agar, sugar, yeast, cornmeal). Next, we fed the larvae diets augmented with 31 different amino compounds, administered in different concentrations, and observed their effects on larval metabolomic composition, viability, rate of development and freeze tolerance. While some diet additives were toxic, others showed positive effects on freeze tolerance. Statistical correlation revealed tight association between high freeze tolerance and high levels of amino compounds involved in arginine and proline metabolism. Proline-and arginine-augmented diets showed the highest potential, improving freeze survival to 42.1\% and 50.6\%, respectively. Two plausible mechanisms by which high concentrations of proline and arginine might stimulate high freeze tolerance are discussed: (i) proline, probably in combination with trehalose, could reduce partial unfolding of proteins and prevent membrane fusions in the larvae exposed to thermal stress (prior to freezing) or during freeze dehydration; (ii) both arginine and proline are exceptional among amino compounds in their ability to form supramolecular aggregates which probably bind partially unfolded proteins and inhibit their aggregation under increasing freeze dehydration.",2016,219,15,2358-2367
Distinct metabolic adjustments arise from acclimation to constant hypoxia and intermittent hypoxia in estuarine killifish (<i>Fundulus heteroclitus</i>),"Borowiec, Brittney G. and McClelland, Grant B. and Rees, Bernard B. and Scott, Graham R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.190900,"Many fish experience daily cycles of hypoxia in the wild, but the physiological strategies for coping with intermittent hypoxia are poorly understood. We examined how killifish adjust O-2 supply and demand during acute hypoxia, and how these responses are altered after prolonged acclimation to constant or intermittent patterns of hypoxia exposure. We acclimated killifish to normoxia (similar to 20 kPa O-2), constant hypoxia (2 kPa) or intermittent cycles of nocturnal hypoxia (12 h:12 h normoxia:hypoxia) for 28 days, and then compared whole-animal O-2 consumption rates (<(M)over dot>(O2)) and tissue metabolites during exposure to 12 h of hypoxia followed by reoxygenation in normoxia. Normoxia-acclimated fish experienced a pronounced 27\% drop in <(M)over dot>(O2) during acute hypoxia, and modestly increased <(M)over dot>(O2) upon reoxygenation. They strongly recruited anaerobic metabolism during acute hypoxia, indicated by lactate accumulation in plasma, muscle, liver, brain, heart and digestive tract, as well as a transient drop in intracellular pH, and they increased hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha protein abundance in muscle. Glycogen, glucose and glucose-6-phosphate levels suggested that glycogen supported brain metabolism in hypoxia, while the muscle used circulating glucose. Acclimation to constant hypoxia caused a stable similar to 50\% decrease in <(M)over dot>(O2) that persisted after reoxygenation, with minimal recruitment of anaerobic metabolism, suggestive of metabolic depression. By contrast, fish acclimated to intermittent hypoxia maintained sufficient O-2 transport to support normoxic <(M)over dot>(O2), modestly recruited lactate metabolism and increased <(M)over dot>(O2) dramatically upon reoxygenation. Both groups of hypoxia-acclimated fish had similar glycogen, ATP, intracellular pH and HIF-1 alpha levels as normoxic controls. We conclude that different patterns of hypoxia exposure favour distinct strategies for matching O-2 supply and O-2 demand.",2018,221,23,NA
Acclimation potential of Arctic cod (<i>Boreogadus saida</i>) from the rapidly warming Arctic Ocean,"Drost, H. E. and Lo, M. and Carmack, E. C. and Farrell, A. P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.140194,"As a consequence of the growing concern about warming of the Arctic Ocean, this study quantified the thermal acclimation responses of Boreogadus saida, a key Arctic food web fish. Physiological rates for cardio-respiratory functions as well as critical maximum temperature (T-c,T-max) for loss of equilibrium (LOE) were measured. The transition temperatures for these events (LOE, the rate of oxygen uptake and maximum heart rate) during acute warming were used to gauge phenotypic plasticity after thermal acclimation from 0.5 degrees C up to 6.5 degrees C for 1 month (respiratory and T-c,T-max measurements) and 6 months (cardiac measurements). T-c,T-max increased significantly by 2.3 degrees C from 14.9 degrees C to 17.1 degrees C with thermal acclimation, while the optimum temperature for absolute aerobic scope increased by 4.5 degrees C over the same range of thermal acclimation. Warm acclimation reset the maximum heart rate to a statistically lower rate, but the first Arrhenius breakpoint temperature during acute warming was unchanged. The hierarchy of transition temperatures was quantified at three acclimation temperatures and was fitted inside a Fry temperature tolerance polygon to better define ecologically relevant thermal limits to performance of B. saida. We conclude that B. saida can acclimate to 6.5 degrees C water temperatures in the laboratory. However, at this acclimation temperature 50\% of the fish were unable to recover from maximum swimming at the 8.5 degrees C test temperature and their cardio-respiratory performance started to decline at water temperatures greater than 5.4 degrees C. Such costs in performance may limit the ecological significance of B. saida acclimation potential.",2016,219,19,3114-3125
The functional significance of panting as a mechanism of thermoregulation and its relationship to the critical thermal maxima in lizards,"Loughran, Caleb L. and Wolf, Blair O.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.224139,"Because most desert-dwelling lizards rely primarily on behavioral thermoregulation for the maintenance of active body temperature, the effectiveness of panting as a thermoregulatory mechanism for evaporative cooling has not been widely explored. We measured changes in body temperature (T-b) with increasing air temperature (T-a) for 17 species of lizards that range across New Mexico and Arizona and quantified the temperatures associated with the onset of panting, and the capacity of individuals to depress T-b below T-a while panting, and estimated the critical thermal maxima (CTmax) for each individual. We examined these variables as a function of phylogeny, body mass and local acclimatization temperature. We found that many species can depress T-b 2-3 degrees C below T-a while panting, and the capacity to do so appears to be a function of each species' ecology and thermal environment, rather than phylogeny. Panting thresholds and CTmax values are phylogenetically conserved within groups. Understanding the functional significance of panting and its potential importance as a thermoregulatory mechanism will improve our understanding of the potential for species' persistence in an increasingly warmer world.",2020,223,17,NA
Hormetic benefits of prior anoxia exposure in buffering anoxia stress in a soil-pupating insect,"Visser, Bertanne and Williams, Caroline M. and Hahn, Daniel A. and Short, Clancy A. and Lopez-Martinez, Giancarlo",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.167825,"Oxygen is essential for most animals, and exposure to a complete lack of oxygen, i.e. anoxia, can result in irreparable damage to cells that can extend up to the organismal level to negatively affect performance. Although it is known that brief anoxia exposure may confer cross-tolerance to other stressors, few data exist on the biochemical and organismal consequences of repeated intermittent bouts of anoxia exposure. In nature, the Caribbean fruit fly, Anastrepha suspensa (Diptera: Tephritidae), is frequently exposed to heavy tropical rainfall while pupating in the soil, equating to multiple exposures to hypoxia or anoxia during development. Here, we tested whether prior anoxia exposures during pupal development can induce a beneficial acclimation response, and we explored the consequences of prior exposure for both whole-organism performance and correlated biochemical metrics. Pharate adults (the last developmental stage in the pupal case) were most sensitive to anoxia exposure, showing decreased survival and fertility compared with controls. These negative impacts were ameliorated by exposure to anoxia in earlier pupal developmental stages, indicating a hormetic effect of prior anoxia exposure. Anoxia exposure early in pupal development reduced the oxygen debt repaid after anoxia exposure relative to pharate adults experiencing anoxia for the first time. Lipid levels were highest in all pupal stages when exposed to prior anoxia. Prior anoxia thus benefits organismal performance and relocates resources towards lipid storage throughout pupal-adult development.",2018,221,6,NA
"Repeated freezing induces a trade-off between cryoprotection and egg production in the goldenrod gall fly, <i>Eurosta solidaginis</i>","Marshall, Katie E. and Sinclair, Brent J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.177956,"Internal ice formation leads to wholesale changes in ionic, osmotic and pH homeostasis, energy metabolism, and mechanical damage, across a small range of temperatures, and is thus an abiotic stressor that acts at a distinct, physiologically relevant, threshold. Insects that experience repeated freeze-thaw cycles over winter will cross this stressor threshold many times over their lifespan. Here, we examined the effect of repeatedly crossing the freezing threshold on short-term physiological parameters (metabolic reserves and cryoprotectant concentration) as well as long-term fitness-related performance (survival and egg production) in the freeze-tolerant goldenrod gall fly, Eurosta solidaginis. We exposed overwintering prepupae to a series of low temperatures (-10, -15 or -20 degrees C) with increasing numbers of freezing events (3, 6 or 10) with differing recovery periods between events (1, 5 or 10 days). Repeated freezing increased sorbitol concentration by about 50\% relative to a single freezing episode, and prompted prepupae to modify long-chain triacylglycerols to acetylated triacylglycerols. Long-term, repeated freezing did not significantly reduce survival but did reduce egg production by 9.8\% relative to a single freezing event. Exposure temperature did not affect any of these measures, suggesting that threshold crossing events may be more important to fitness than the intensity of stress in overwintering E. solidaginis.",2018,221,15,NA
Cherchez la femme - impact of ocean acidification on the egg jelly coat and attractants for sperm,"Foo, Shawna A. and Deaker, Dione and Byrne, Maria",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.177188,"The impact of ocean acidification on marine invertebrate eggs and its consequences for sperm chemotaxis are unknown. In the sea urchins Heliocidaris tuberculata and Heliocidaris erythrogramma, with small (93 mu m) and large (393 mu m) eggs, respectively, we documented the effect of decreased pH on the egg jelly coat, an extracellular matrix that increases target size for sperm and contains sperm-attracting molecules. In near-future conditions (pH 7.8, 7.6), the jelly coat of H. tuberculata decreased by 11\% and 21\%, reducing egg target size by 9\% and 17\%, respectively. In contrast, the egg jelly coat of H erythrogramma was not affected. The reduction in the jelly coat has implications for sperm chemotaxis in H. tuberculata. In the presence of decreased pH and egg chemicals, the sperm of this species increased their velocity, motility and linearity, behaviour that was opposite to that seen for sperm exposed to egg chemicals in ambient conditions. Egg chemistry appears to cause a reduction in sperm velocity where attractants guide the sperm in the direction of the egg. Investigation of the effects of decreased pH on sperm isolated from the influence of egg chemistry does not provide an integrative assessment of the effects of ocean acidification on sperm function. Differences in the sensitivity of the jelly coat of the two species is likely associated with egg evolution in H. erythrogramma. We highlight important unappreciated impacts of ocean acidification on marine gamete functionality, and insights into potential winners and losers in a changing ocean, pointing to the advantage conveyed by the evolution of large eggs.",2018,221,13,NA
Desiccation tolerance in <i>Anopheles coluzzii</i>: the effects of spiracle size and cuticular hydrocarbons,"Arcaz, Arthur C. and Huestis, Diana L. and Dao, Adama and Yaro, Alpha S. and Diallo, Moussa and Andersen, John and Blomquist, Gary J. and Lehmann, Tovi",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.135665,"The African malaria mosquitoes Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles coluzzii range over forests and arid areas, where they withstand dry spells and months-long dry seasons, suggesting variation in their desiccation tolerance. We subjected a laboratory colony (G3) and wild Sahelian mosquitoes during the rainy and dry seasons to desiccation assays. The thoracic spiracles and amount and composition of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) of individual mosquitoes were measured to determine the effects of these traits on desiccation tolerance. The relative humidity of the assay, body water available, rate of water loss and water content at death accounted for 88\% of the variation in desiccation tolerance. Spiracle size did not affect the rate of water loss or desiccation tolerance of the colony mosquitoes, as was the case for the total CHCs. However, six CHCs accounted for 71\% of the variation in desiccation tolerance and three accounted for 72\% of the variation in the rate of water loss. Wild A. coluzzii exhibited elevated desiccation tolerance during the dry season. During that time, relative thorax and spiracle sizes were smaller than during the rainy season. A smaller spiracle size appeared to increase A. coluzzii's desiccation tolerance, but was not statistically significant. Seasonal changes in CHC composition were detected in Sahelian A. coluzzii. Stepwise regression models suggested the effect of particular CHCs on desiccation tolerance. In conclusion, the combination of particular CHCs along with the total amount of CHCs is a primary mechanism conferring desiccation tolerance in A. coluzzii, while variation in spiracle size might be a secondary mechanism.",2016,219,11,1675-1688

J. and Lau, Gigi Y. and Richards, Jeffrey G.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.087155,"The freshwater turtle Trachemys scripta can survive in the complete absence of O-2 (anoxia) for periods lasting several months. In mammals, anoxia leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, which culminates in cellular necrosis and apoptosis. Despite the obvious clinical benefits of understanding anoxia tolerance, little is known about the effects of chronic oxygen deprivation on the function of turtle mitochondria. In this study, we compared mitochondrial function in hearts of T. scripta exposed to either normoxia or 2. weeks of complete anoxia at 5 degrees C and during simulated acute anoxia/reoxygenation. Mitochondrial respiration, electron transport chain activities, enzyme activities, proton conductance and membrane potential were measured in permeabilised cardiac fibres and isolated mitochondria. Two weeks of anoxia exposure at 5 degrees C resulted in an increase in lactate, and decreases in ATP, glycogen, pH and phosphocreatine in the heart. Mitochondrial proton conductance and membrane potential were similar between experimental groups, while aerobic capacity was dramatically reduced. The reduced aerobic capacity was the result of a severe downregulation of the F1FO-ATPase (Complex V), which we assessed as a decrease in enzyme activity. Furthermore, in stark contrast to mammalian paradigms, isolated turtle heart mitochondria endured 20 min of anoxia followed by reoxygenation without any impact on subsequent ADP-stimulated O-2 consumption (State III respiration) or State IV respiration. Results from this study demonstrate that turtle mitochondria remodel in response to chronic anoxia exposure and a reduction in Complex V activity is a fundamental component of mitochondrial and cellular anoxia survival.",2013,216,17,3283-3293
Rh versus pH: the role of Rhesus glycoproteins in renal ammonia excretion during metabolic acidosis in a freshwater teleost fish,"Wright, Patricia A. and Wood, Chris M. and Wilson, Jonathan M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.098640,"Increased renal ammonia excretion in response to metabolic acidosis is thought to be a conserved response in vertebrates. We tested the hypothesis that Rhesus (Rh) glycoproteins in the kidney of the freshwater common carp, Cyprinus carpio, play a crucial role in regulating renal ammonia excretion during chronic metabolic acidosis. Exposure to water pH 4.0 (72 h) resulted in a classic metabolic acidosis with reduced plasma arterial pH and {[}HCO3-], no change in PCO2 and large changes in renal function. Urine {[}NH4+] as well as {[}titratable acidity-HCO3-] rose significantly over the acid exposure, but the profound reduction (fivefold) in urine flow rates eliminated the expected elevations in renal ammonia excretion. Low urine flow rates may be a primary strategy to conserve ions, as urinary excretion rates of Na+, Cl- and Ca2+ were significantly lower during the acid exposure relative to the control period. Interestingly, renal Rhcg1 mRNA and protein levels were elevated in acid-exposed relative to control groups, along with mRNA levels of several ion transporters, including the Na+/H+ exchanger, H+-ATPase and Na+/K+-ATPase. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed a strong apical Rhcg1 signal in distal tubules. Taken together, these data show that renal Rh glycoproteins and associated ion transporters are responsive to metabolic acidosis, but conservation of ions through reduced urine flow rates takes primacy over renal acid-base regulation in the freshwater C. carpio. We propose that an `acid/base-ion balance' compromise explains the variable renal responses to metabolic acidosis in freshwater teleosts.",2014,217,16,2855-2865
Warm acclimation and oxygen depletion induce species-specific responses in salmonids,"Anttila, Katja and Lewis, Mario and Prokkola, Jenni M. and Kanerva, Mirella and Seppanen, Eila and Kolari, Irma and Nikinmaa, Mikko",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.119115,"Anthropogenic activities are greatly altering the habitats of animals, whereby fish are already encountering several stressors simultaneously. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the capacity of fish to respond to two different environmental stressors (high temperature and overnight hypoxia) separately and together. We found that acclimation to increased temperature (from 7.7 +/- 0.02 degrees C to 14.9 +/- 0.05 degrees C) and overnight hypoxia (daily changes from normoxia to 63-67\% oxygen saturation), simulating climate change and eutrophication, had both antagonistic and synergistic effects on the capacity of fish to tolerate these stressors. The thermal tolerance of Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) and landlocked salmon (Salmo salar m. sebago) increased with warm acclimation by 1.3 and 2.2 degrees C, respectively, but decreased when warm temperature was combined with overnight hypoxia (by 0.2 and 0.4 degrees C, respectively). In contrast, the combination of the stressors more than doubled hypoxia tolerance in salmon and also increased hypoxia tolerance in char by 22\%. Salmon had 1.2 degrees C higher thermal tolerance than char, but char tolerated much lower oxygen levels than salmon at a given temperature. The changes in hypoxia tolerance were connected to the responses of the oxygen supply and delivery system. The relative ventricle mass was higher in cold-than in warm-acclimated salmon but the thickness of the compact layer of the ventricle increased with the combination of warm and hypoxia acclimation in both species. Char had also significantly larger hearts and thicker compact layers than salmon. The results illustrate that while fish can have protective responses when encountering a single environmental stressor, the combination of stressors can have unexpected species-specific effects that will influence their survival capacity.",2015,218,10,1471-1477
Cardiac reflexes in awarming world: thermal plasticity of barostatic control and autonomic tones in a temperate fish,"Sandblom, Erik and Ekstrom, Andreas and Brijs, Jeroen and Sundstrom, L.

Yet, the chronic thermal effects on cardiovascular homeostatic reflexes in fish are little understood although this may have important implications for physiological performance and overall resilience to climate warming. We compared cardiac autonomic control and baroreflex regulation of heart rate in perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) from a reference area in the Baltic Sea at 18-19 degrees C with conspecifics from the Biotest enclosure, a chronically heated ecosystem receiving warmed effluent water (24-25 degrees C) from a nuclear power plant. Resting heart rate of Biotest fish displayed clear thermal compensation and was 58.3+/-2.3 beats min(-1) compared with 52.4+/-2.6 beats min(-1) in reference fish at their respective environmental temperatures (Q(10) = 1.2). The thermally compensated heart rate of Biotest fish was a combined effect of elevated inhibitory cholinergic tone (105\% in Biotest fish versus 70\% in reference fish) and reduced intrinsic cardiac pacemaker rate. A barostatic response was evident in both groups, as pharmacologically induced increases and decreases in blood pressure resulted in atropine-sensitive bradycardia and tachycardia, respectively. Yet, the tachycardia in Biotest fish was significantly greater, presumably due to the larger scope for vagal release. Acclimation of Biotest fish to 18 degrees C for 3 weeks abolished differences in intrinsic heart rate and autonomic tone, suggesting considerable short-term thermal plasticity of cardiovascular control in this species. The heightened hypotensive tachycardia in Biotest perch may represent an important mechanism of ectothermic vertebrates that safeguards tissue perfusion pressure when tissue oxygen demand is elevated by environmental warming.",2016,219,18,2880-2887
Heat transfer in fish: are short excursions between habitats a thermoregulatory behaviour to exploit resources in an unfavourable thermal environment?,"Pepino, Marc and Goyer, Katerine and Magnan, Pierre",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.126466,"Temperature is the primary environmental factor affecting physiological processes in ectotherms. Heat-transfermodels describe how the fish's internal temperature responds to a fluctuating thermal environment. Specifically, the rate coefficient (k), defined as the instantaneous rate of change in body temperature in relation to the difference between ambient and body temperature, summarizes the combined effects of direct thermal conduction through body mass, passive convection (intracellular and intercellular fluids) and forced convective heat transfer (cardiovascular system). The k-coefficient is widely used in fish ecology to understand howbody temperature responds to changes in water temperature. The main objective of this study was to estimate the k-coefficient of brook charr equipped with internal temperature-sensitive transmitters in controlled laboratory experiments. Fish were first transferred from acclimation tanks (10 degrees C) to tanks at 14, 19 or 23 degrees C (warming experiments) and were then returned to the acclimation tanks (10 degrees C; cooling experiments), thus producing six step changes in ambient temperature. We used non-linear mixed models to estimate the k-coefficient. Model comparisons indicated that the model incorporating the k-coefficient as a function of absolute temperature difference (dT: 4, 9 and 13 degrees C) best described body temperature change. By simulating body temperature in a heterogeneous thermal environment, we provide theoretical predictions of maximum excursion duration between feeding and resting areas. Our simulations suggest that short (i.e. <60 min) excursions could be a common thermoregulatory behaviour adopted by cold freshwater fish species to sustain body temperature below a critical temperature threshold, enabling them to exploit resources in an unfavourable thermal environment.",2015,218,21,3461-3467
Ocean warming combined with lower omega-3 nutritional availability impairs the cardio-respiratory function of a marine fish,"Vagner, Marie and Pante, Eric and Viricel, Amelia and Lacoue-Labarthe, Thomas and Zambonino-Infante, Jose-Luis and Quazuguel, Patrick and Dubillot, Emmanuel and Huet, Valerie and Le Delliou, Herve and Lefrancois, Christel and Imbert-Auvray, Nathalie",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.187179,"Highly unsaturated fatty acids of the omega-3 series (HUFA) are major constituents of cell membranes. yet are poorly synthesised de novo by consumers. Their production, mainly supported by aquatic microalgae, has been decreasing with global change. The consequences of such reductions may be profound for ectotherm consumers, as temperature tightly regulates the HUFA content in cell membranes, maintaining their functionality. Integrating individual, tissue and molecular approaches, we examined the consequences of the combined effects of temperature and HUFA depletion on the key cardio-respiratory functions of the golden grey mullet, an ectotherm grazer of high ecological importance. For 4 months, fish were exposed to two contrasting HUFA diets {[}4.8\% eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)+docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on dry matter (DM) versus 0.2\% EPA+DHA on DM] at 12 and 20 degrees C. Ventricular force development coupled with gene expression profiles measured on cardiac muscle suggest that combining HUFA depletion with warmer temperatures leads to: (1) a proliferation of sarcolemmal and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ channels and (2) a higher force-generating ability by increasing extracellular Ca2+ influx via sarcolemmal channels when the heart has to sustain excessive effort due to stress and/or exercise. At the individual scale, these responses were associated with a greater aerobic scope, maximum metabolic rate and net cost of locomotion, suggesting the higher energy cost of this strategy. This impaired cardiac performance could have wider consequences for other physiological performance such as growth, reproduction or migration, all of which greatly depend on heart function.",2019,222,8,NA

We investigated developmental plasticity of aspects of the cardio-respiratory physiology of encapsulated embryos of a marine gastropod, Littorina obtusata, surviving exposure to moderate hypoxia (P-O2 = 8 kPa) and compared the development of these survivors with that of individuals that died before hatching. Individuals surviving hypoxia exhibited a slower rate of development and altered ontogeny of cardio-respiratory structure and function compared with normoxic controls (P-O2 > 20 kPa). The onset and development of the larval and adult hearts were delayed in chronological time in hypoxia, but both organs appeared earlier in developmental time and cardiac activity rates were greater. The velum, a transient, `larval' organ thought to play a role in gas exchange, was larger in hypoxia but developed more slowly (in chronological time), and velar cilia-driven, rotational activity was lower. Despite these effects of hypoxia, 38\% of individuals survived to hatching. Compared with those embryos that died during development, these surviving embryos had advanced expression of adult structures, i.e. a significantly earlier occurrence and greater activity of their adult heart and larger shells. In contrast, embryos that died retained larval cardio-respiratory features (the velum and larval heart) for longer in chronological time. Surviving embryos came from eggs with significantly higher albumen provisioning than those that died, suggesting an energetic component for advanced development of adult traits.",2016,219,7,1076-1085

Despite this unusual physiology, inherent difficulties have precluded an understanding of the cardiovascular responses to T-a in free-swimming bluefin tunas. We measured the heart rate (fH) responses of two captive Pacific bluefin tunas (Thunnus orientalis; 9.7 and 13.3. kg) over a cumulative period of 40. days. Routine fH during fasting in the holding tank at a T-a of 20 degrees C was 45.1 +/- 8.0 and 40.7 +/- 6.5. beats. min(-1) for Tuna 1 and Tuna 2, respectively. f(H) decreased in each fish with a Q(10) temperature coefficient of 2.6 (Tuna 1) and 3.1 (Tuna 2) as Ta in the tank was slowly decreased to 15 degrees C (similar to 0.4 degrees Ch(-1)), despite a gradual increase in swimming speed. The same thermal challenge during digestion revealed similar thermal dependence of fH and indicated that the rate of visceral cooling is not buffered by the heat increment of feeding. Acutely decreasing Ta from 20 to 10 degrees C while Tuna 1 swam in a tunnel respirometer caused a progressive increase in tail-beat frequency and oxygen consumption rate ((M) over dot(O2)). fH of this fish decreased with a Q(10) of 2.7 as T-a decreased between 20 and 15 degrees C, while further cooling to 10 degrees C saw a general plateau in f(H) around 35. beats. min(-1) with a Q(10) of 1.3.

Energetic costs of bill heat exchange demonstrate contributions to thermoregulation at high temperatures in toco toucans (Ramphastos toco),"Chaves, Jussara N. and Tattersall, Glenn J. and Andrade, V, Denis",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.245268,"Body temperature regulation under changes in ambient temperature involves adjustments in heat production and heat exchange rates between the animal and the environment. One mechanism involves the modulation of the surface temperature of specific areas of the body through vasomotor adjustment. In homeotherms, this thermoregulatory adjustment is essential for the maintenance of body temperature over a moderate temperature range, known as the thermal neutral zone (TNZ). The bill of the toco toucan (Ramphastos toco) has been described as a highly efficient thermal window and hypothesized to assist in the thermal homeostasis of this bird. Herein, we directly evaluated the contribution of heat exchange through the bill of the toco toucan and role of the bill in the delimitation of the TNZ. To do this, we measured metabolic rate (MR), via oxygen consumption, over a range of ambient temperatures from 0 to 35 degrees C. MR measurements were made in birds with the bill intact and with the bill insulated. The limits of the TNZ did not differ between treatments, ranging from 10.8 to 25.0 degrees C. The MR differed among treatments only at elevated temperatures (30 and 35 degrees C), reaching 0.92 +/- 0.11 ml O2 g-1 h-1 (mean +/- s.d.) for the intact group and 1.13 +/- 0.13 ml O2 g-1 h-1 for the insulated group. These results indicate that although heat dissipation through the bill does not contribute significantly to widening of the TNZ, it may well be critically important in assisting body temperature regulation at higher temperatures extending above the upper limit of the TNZ.",2023,226,5,NA
Sex-specific divergence for adaptations to dehydration stress in <i>Drosophila kikkawai</i>,"Parkash, Ravi and Ranga, Poonam",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.087650,"Several studies on diverse Drosophila species have reported higher desiccation resistance of females, but the physiological basis of such sex-specific differences has received less attention. We tested whether sex-specific differences in cuticular traits ( melanic females and non-melanic males) of Drosophila kikkawai correspond with divergence in their water balance mechanisms. Our results are interesting in several respects. First, positive clinal variation in desiccation resistance was correlated with cuticular melanisation in females but with changes in cuticular lipid mass in males, despite a lack of differences between the sexes for the rate of water loss. Second, a comparative analysis of water budget showed that females of the northern population stored more body water as well as hemolymph content and exhibited greater dehydration tolerance than flies from the southern tropics. In contrast, we found no geographical variation in the males for water content and dehydration tolerance. Third, an similar to 10-fold increase in the rate of water loss after organic solvent treatment of male D. kikkawai suggested a role of cuticular lipids in cuticular transpiration, but had no effect in the females. Fourth, geographical differences in the storage of carbohydrate content ( metabolic fuel) were observed in females but not in males. Interestingly, in females, the rate of utilization of carbohydrates did not vary geographically, but males from drier localities showed a 50\% reduction compared with wetter localities. Thus, body melanisation, increased body water, hemolymph, carbohydrate content and greater dehydration tolerance confer greater desiccation resistance in females, but a reduced rate of water loss is the only possible mechanism to cope with drought stress in males. Finally, acclimated females showed a significant increase in drought resistance associated with higher trehalose content as well as dehydration tolerance, while males showed no acclimation response. Thus, sex-specific differences in desiccation resistance of D. kikkawai are associated with divergence in some water balance strategies, despite a lack of differences in the rate of water loss between the two sexes.",2013,216,17,3301-3313
Reduced lactate dehydrogenase activity in the heart and suppressed sex hormone levels are associated with female-biased mortality during thermal stress in Pacific salmon,"Little, A.

Here, we used coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) to test whether females exposed to elevated water temperatures (18 degrees C) (i) suppress circulating sex hormones (testosterone, 11-ketotestosterone and estradiol), owing to elevated cortisol levels, (ii) have higher activities of enzymes supporting anaerobic metabolism (e.g. lactate dehydrogenase, LDH), (iii) have lower activities of enzymes driving oxidative metabolism (e.g. citrate synthase, CS) in skeletal and cardiac muscle, and (iv) have more oxidative stress damage and reduced capacity for antioxidant defense [}lower catalase (CAT) activity]. We found no evidence that a higher susceptibility to oxidative stress contributes to female-biased mortality at warm temperatures. We did, however, find that females had significantly lower cardiac LDH and that 18 degrees C significantly reduced plasma levels of testosterone and estradiol, especially in females. We also found that relative gonad size was significantly lower in the 18 degrees C treatment regardless of sex, whereas relative liver size was significantly lower in females held at 18 degrees C. Further, relative spleen size was significantly elevated in the 18 degrees C treatments across both sexes, with larger warm-induced increases in females. Our results suggest that males may better tolerate bouts of cardiac hypoxia at high temperature, and that thermal stress may also disrupt testosterone- and estradiol-mediated protein catabolism, and the immune response (larger spleens), in migratory female salmon.",2020,223,14,NA
Coming up for air: thermal dependence of dive behaviours and metabolism in sea snakes,"Udyawer, Vinay and Simpfendorfer, Colin A. and Heupel, Michelle R. and Clark, Timothy D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.146571,"Cutaneous gas exchange allows some air-breathing diving ectotherms to supplement their pulmonary oxygen uptake, which may allow prolongation of dives and an increased capacity to withstand anthropogenic and natural threatening processes that increase submergence times. However, little is known of the interplay between metabolism, bimodal oxygen uptake and activity levels across thermal environments in diving ectotherms. Here, we show in two species of sea snake (spine-bellied sea snake, Hydrophis curtus; and elegant sea snake, Hydrophis elegans) that increasing temperature elevates surfacing rate, increases total oxygen consumption and decreases dive duration. The majority of dives observed in both species remained within estimated maximal aerobic limits. While cutaneous gas exchange accounted for a substantial proportion of total oxygen consumption (up to 23\%), unexpectedly it was independent of water temperature and activity levels, suggesting a diffusion-limited mechanism. Our findings demonstrate that rising water temperature and a limited capability to up-regulate cutaneous oxygen uptake may compromise the proficiency with which sea snakes perform prolonged dives. This may hinder their capacity to withstand ongoing anthropogenic activities like trawl fishing, and increase their susceptibility to surface predation as their natural environments continue to warm.",2016,219,21,3447-3454
Antioxidant defence and stress protein induction following heat stress in the Mediterranean snail <i>Xeropicta derbentina</i>,"Troschinski, Sandra and Dieterich, Andreas and Krais, Stefanie and Triebskorn, Rita and Koehler, Heinz-R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.113167,"The Mediterranean snail Xeropicta derbentina (Pulmonata, Hygromiidae), being highly abundant in Southern France, has the need for efficient physiological adaptations to desiccation and overheating posed by dry and hot environmental conditions. As a consequence of heat, oxidative stress manifests in these organisms, which, in turn, leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, we focused on adaptations at the biochemical level by investigation of antioxidant defences and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) induction, both essential mechanisms of the heat stress response. We exposed snails to elevated temperature (25, 38, 40, 43 and 45 degrees C) in the laboratory and measured the activity of the antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), determined the Hsp70 level and quantified lipid peroxidation. In general, we found a high constitutive level of CAT activity in all treatments, which may be interpreted as a permanent protection against ROS, i. e. hydrogen peroxide. CAT and GPx showed temperature-dependent activity: CAT activity was significantly increased in response to high temperatures (43 and 45 degrees C), whereas GPx exhibited a significantly increased activity at 40 degrees C, probably in response to high levels of lipid peroxides that occurred in the 38 degrees C treatment. Hsp70 showed a maximum induction at 40 degrees C, followed by a decrease at higher temperatures. Our results reveal that X. derbentina possesses a set of efficient mechanisms to cope with the damaging effects of heat. Furthermore, we demonstrated that, besides the well-documented Hsp70 stress response, antioxidant defence plays a crucial role in the snails' competence to survive extreme temperatures.",2014,217,24,4399-4405
Intraspecific investigation of dehydration-enhanced innate immune performance and endocrine stress response to sublethal dehydration in a semi-aquatic species of pit viper,"Sandfoss, Mark R. and Brischoux, Francois and Lillywhite, Harvey B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.243894,"Sublethal dehydration can cause negative physiological effects, but recent studies investigating the sub-lethal effects of dehydration on innate immune performance in reptiles have found a positive correlation between innate immune response and plasma osmolality. To investigate whether this is an adaptive trait that evolved in response to dehydration in populations inhabiting water-scarce environments, we sampled free-ranging cottonmouth snakes (n=26 adult cottonmouths) from two populations inhabiting contrasting environments in terms of water availability: Snake Key (n=12), an island with no permanent sources of fresh water, and Paynes Prairie (n=14), a flooded freshwater prairie. In addition to field surveys, we manipulated the hydration state of 17 cottonmouths (Paynes Prairie n=9, Snake Key n=8) in a laboratory setting and measured the response of corticosterone and innate immune performance to dehydration with the aim of identifying any correlation or trade-offs between them. We measured corticosterone of cottonmouths at a baseline level and then again following a 60 min stress test when at three hydration states: hydrated, dehydrated and rehydrated. We found that innate immune performance improved with dehydration and then returned to baseline levels within 48 h of rehydration, which agrees with previous research in reptiles. Despite the frequent exposure of cottonmouths on Snake Key to dehydrating conditions, we did not find cottonmouths inhabiting the island to show a greater magnitude or more prolonged immune response compared with cottonmouths from Paynes Prairie. We also found a positive association between dehydration and corticosterone values.",2022,225,17,NA
Heat- and humidity-induced plastic changes in body lipids and starvation resistance in the tropical fly <i>Zaprionus indianus</i> during wet and dry seasons,"Girish, T. N. and Pradeep, B. E. and Parkash, Ravi",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.174482,"Insects in tropical wet or dry seasons are likely to cope with starvation stress through plastic changes (developmental as well as adult acclimation) in energy metabolites. Control and experimental groups of Zaprionus indianus flies were reared under wet or dry conditions, but adults were acclimated at different thermal or humidity conditions. Adult flies of the control group were acclimated at 27 degrees C and low (50\%) or high (60\%) relative humidity (RH). For experimental groups, adult flies were acclimated at 32 degrees C for 1 to 6 days and under low (40\%) or high (70\%) RH. For humidity acclimation, adult flies were acclimated at 27 degrees C but under low (40\%) or high (70\%) RH for 1 to 6 days. Plastic changes in experimental groups as compared with the control group (developmental as well as adult acclimation) revealed significant accumulation of body lipids owing to thermal or humidity acclimation of wet season flies, but low humidity acclimation did not change the level of body lipids in dry season flies. Starvation resistance and body lipids were higher in the males of dry season flies but in the females of wet season flies. Adults acclimated under different thermal or humidity conditions exhibited changes in the rate of utilization of body lipids, carbohydrates and proteins. Adult acclimation of wet or dry season flies revealed plastic changes in mean daily fecundity; and a reduction in fecundity under starvation. Thus, thermal or humidity acclimation of adults revealed plastic changes in energy metabolites to support starvation resistance of wet or dry season flies.",2018,221,9,NA
Elevated temperature and acclimation time affect metabolic performance in the heavily exploited Nile perch of Lake Victoria,"Nyboer, Elizabeth A. and Chapman, Lauren J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.163022,"Increasing water temperatures owing to anthropogenic climate change are predicted to negatively impact the aerobic metabolic performance of aquatic ectotherms. Specifically, it has been hypothesized that thermal increases result in reductions in aerobic scope (AS), which lead to decreases in energy available for essential fitness and performance functions. Consequences of warming are anticipated to be especially severe for warm-adapted tropical species as they are thought to have narrow thermal windows and limited plasticity for coping with elevated temperatures. In this study we test how predicted warming may affect the aerobic performance of Nile perch (Lates niloticus), a commercially harvested fish species in the Lake Victoria basin of East Africa. We measured critical thermal maxima (CTmax) and key metabolic variables such as AS and excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) across a range of temperatures, and compared responses between acute (3-day) exposures and 3-week acclimations. CTmax increased with acclimation temperature; however, 3-week-acclimated fish had higher overall CTmax than acutely exposed individuals. Nile perch also showed the capacity to increase or maintain high AS even at temperatures well beyond their current range; however, acclimated Nile perch had lower AS compared with acutely exposed fish. These changes were accompanied by lower EPOC, suggesting that drops in AS may reflect improved energy utilization after acclimation, a finding that is supported by improvements in growth at high temperatures over the acclimation period. Overall, the results challenge predictions that tropical species have limited thermal plasticity, and that high temperatures will be detrimental because of limitations in AS.",2017,220,20,3782-3793

Thus, we acclimated wild, migratory Arctic char to 13 degrees C (similar to 7 degrees C above a summer average) for an ecologically relevant period (3 days) and measured maximum heart rate (integral H,max) during acute warming to determine their ability to rapidly improve cardiac function at high temperatures. Arctic char exhibited rapid compensatory cardiac plasticity similar to past observations following prolonged warm acclimation: they reduced integral H,max over intermediate temperatures (-8\%), improved their ability to increase integral H,max during warming (+10\%), and increased (+1.3 degrees C) the temperature at the onset of an arrhythmic heartbeat, a sign of cardiac failure. This rapid cardiac plasticity may help migrating fishes such as Arctic char mitigate short-term thermal challenges.

P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.246331,"Photosynthetic animals produce oxygen, providing an ideal lens for studying how oxygen dynamics influence thermal sensitivity. The algivorous sea slug Elysia viridis can steal and retain chloroplasts from the marine alga Bryopsis sp. for months when starved, but chloroplast retention is mere weeks when they are fed another green alga, Chaetomorpha sp. To examine plasticity in thermal tolerance and changes in net oxygen exchange when fed and starving, slugs fed each alga were acclimated to 17 degrees C (the current maximum temperature to which they are exposed in nature) and 22 degrees C (the increase predicted for 2100) and measured at different points during starvation. We also examined increased illumination to evaluate a potential tradeoff between increased oxygen production but faster chloroplast degradation. Following acclimation, we subjected slugs to acute thermal stress to determine their thermal tolerance. We also measured net oxygen exchange before and after acute thermal stress. Thermal tolerance improved in slugs acclimated to 22 degrees C, indicating they can acclimate to temperatures higher than they naturally experience. All slugs exhibited net oxygen uptake, and rates were highest in recently fed slugs before exposure to acute thermal stress. Oxygen uptake was suppressed following acute thermal stress. Under brighter light, slugs exhibited improved thermal tolerance, possibly because photosynthetic oxygen production alleviated oxygen limitation. Accordingly, this advantage disappeared later in starvation when photosynthesis ceased. Thus, E. viridis can cope with heatwaves by suppressing metabolism and plastically adjusting heat tolerance; however, starvation influences a slug's thermal tolerance and oxygen uptake such that continuous access to algal food for its potential nutritive and oxygenic benefits is critical when facing thermal stress.",2024,227,10,NA
Water deprivation increases maternal corticosterone levels and enhances offspring growth in the snake <i>Vipera aspis</i>,"Dupoue, Andreaz and Angelier, Frederic and Brischoux, Francois and DeNardo, Dale F. and Trouve, Colette and Parenteau, Charline and Lourdais, Olivier",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.132639,"Circulating glucocorticoid (GC) levels may increase as a result of reproductive effort or in response to unpredictable events. However, GC secretion can vary with the availability of vital trophic resources such as energy. While water represents another critical resource, the impact of water deprivation on GC secretion during reproduction has not yet been thoroughly investigated. Here, we examined the effects of water deprivation on plasma corticosterone (CORT) concentrations of female aspic vipers (Vipera aspis), and determined the impacts of water deprivation on offspring traits. We exposed both pregnant and non-reproductive females to a 20-day water deprivation and compared their pre- and post-deprivation CORT levels with those of control females. At the end of the treatment, only water-deprived pregnant females showed a significant increase in CORT levels. In pregnant females, changes in baseline CORT level were correlated with changes in female hydration state. Changes in baseline CORT levels were also negatively influenced by maternal reproductive effort in pregnant control females, while such a relationship was not apparent in pregnant water-deprived females. Finally, we found that offspring from water-deprived females had higher growth rates than offspring from control females. Offspring growth was also positively correlated with changes in both maternal osmolality and baseline CORT levels. Together, our results suggest that dehydration increases maternal CORT levels, which may subsequently influence offspring development. Further long-term field studies are therefore required to assess whether there is an adaptive significance of this response.",2016,219,5,658-667
Temperature-dependent plasticity mediates heart morphology and thermal performance of cardiac function in juvenile Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo</i> <i>salar</i>),"Muir, Carlie A. and Garner, Shawn R. and Damjanovski, Sashko and Neff, Bryan D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.244305,"In many fishes, upper thermal tolerance is thought to be limited in part by the heart's ability to meet increased oxygen demands during periods of high temperature. Temperature-dependent plasticity within the cardiovascular system may help fish cope with the thermal stress imposed by increasing water temperatures. In this study, we examined plasticity in heart morphology and function in juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) reared under control (+0 degrees C) or elevated (+4 degrees C) temperatures. Using non-invasive Doppler echocardiography, we measured the effect of acute warming on maximum heart rate, stroke distance and derived cardiac output. A 4 degrees C increase in average developmental temperature resulted in a >5 degrees C increase in the Arrhenius breakpoint temperature for maximum heart rate and enabled the hearts of these fish to continue beating rhythmically to temperatures approximately 2 degrees C higher than for control fish. However, these differences in thermal performance were not associated with plasticity in maximum cardiovascular capacity, as peak measures of heart rate, stroke distance and derived cardiac output did not differ between temperature treatments. Histological analysis of the heart revealed that while ventricular roundness and relative ventricle size did not differ between treatments, the proportion of compact myocardium in the ventricular wall was significantly greater in fish raised at elevated temperatures. Our findings contribute to the growing understanding of how the thermal environment can affect phenotypes later in life and identify a morphological strategy that may help fishes cope with acute thermal stress.",2022,225,16,NA

Understanding the impact of temperature on performance traits is important as it may affect the ecology and fitness of ectothermic animals such as reptiles. Here, we examined the temperature dependence of performance in two species of South African dwarf chameleon (Bradypodion): one adapted to a semi-arid environment and one to a mesic environment. Ecologically relevant performance traits were tested at different temperatures to evaluate their thermal dependence, and temperature-performance breadths for 80\% and 90\% of each performance trait were calculated. Our results show distinct differences in the thermal dependence of speed-versus force-related performance traits. Moreover, our results show that the semi-arid species is better adapted to higher temperatures and as such has a better chance of coping with the predicted increases in environmental temperature. The mesic area-adapted species seems to be more sensitive to an increase in temperature and could therefore potentially be threatened by the predicted future climate change. However, further studies investigating the potential for acclimation in chameleons are needed to better understand how animals may respond to future climate change.",2013,216,20,3828-3836
Consequences of being phenotypically mismatched with the environment: no evidence of oxidative stress in cold- and warm-acclimated birds facing a cold spell,"Jimenez, Ana Gabriela and Ruhs, Emily Cornelius and Tobin, Kailey J. and Anderson, Katie N. and Le Pogam, Audrey and Regimbald, Lyette and Vezina, Francois",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.218826,"Seasonal changes in maximal thermogenic capacity (M-sum) in wild black-capped chickadees suggests that adjustments in metabolic performance are slow and begin to take place before winter peaks. However, when mean minimal ambient temperature (T-a) reaches -10 degrees C, the chickadee phenotype appears to provide enough spare capacity to endure days with colder T-a, down to -20 degrees C or below. This suggests that birds could also maintain a higher antioxidant capacity as part of their cold-acclimated phenotype to deal with sudden decreases in temperature. Here, we tested how environmental mismatch affected oxidative stress by comparing cold-acclimated (- 5 degrees C) and transition (20 degrees C) phenotypes in chickadees exposed to an acute 15 degrees C drop in temperature with that of control individuals. We measured superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities, as well as lipid peroxidation damage and antioxidant scavenging capacity in pectoralis muscle, brain, intestine and liver. We generally found differences between seasonal phenotypes and across tissues, but no differences with respect to an acute cold drop treatment. Our data suggest oxidative stress is closely matched to whole-animal physiology in cold-acclimated birds compared with transition birds, implying that changes to the oxidative stress system happen slowly.",2020,223,8,NA
Inactivity and the passive slowing effect of cold on resting metabolism as the primary drivers of energy savings in overwintering fishes,"Reeve, Connor and Rowsey, Lauren E. and Speers-Roesch, Ben",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.243407,"Winter dormancy is a seasonal survival strategy common among temperate ectotherms, characterized by inactivity, fasting and low metabolic rates. Previous reports of metabolic rate depression (MRD) in winter-dormant ectotherms, including many fishes, may have resulted from confounding influences of temperature-dependent variation in activity on metabolic rate measurements. We hypothesize that, as demonstrated recently in the winter-dormant cunner (Tautogolabrus adspersus), inactivity and the passive physicochemical (Arrhenius) effect of cold on standard metabolic rate (SMR) are the common primary mechanisms underlying the low metabolic rates among winter-dormant fishes. Using automated video tracking, we investigated threshold temperatures for winter dormancy onset (major reductions in activity, increased sheltering and fasting) in four phylogenetically diverse teleost species reported to be winter dormant: cunner, pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus), American eel (Anguilla rostrata) and mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus). All species showed large activity and feeding reductions, but the magnitude of change and dormancy threshold temperature was species-specific. We propose that a continuum of overwintering responses exists among fishes from dormant to lethargic to active. The relationship between activity and metabolic rate was then measured using video-recorded automated respirometry during acute cooling and following cold acclimation in pumpkinseed, mummichog and eel. In all species, activity and metabolic rate were strongly correlated at all temperatures, and cooling caused reduced activity and metabolic rate. When variation in activity was controlled for across temperatures spanning the dormancy thresholds, the thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate including SMR indicated the predominance of passive physicochemical influences (mean Q(10) <3.5), rather than active MRD. Activity reductions and physicochemical slowing of metabolism owing to cold appear to be the primary energy-saving mechanisms in overwintering fishes.",2022,225,8,NA

In nature, however, the thermal environment is more complex. Aerial exposure and the unpredictable nature of thermal stress during low tides may be critical factors in defining the thermal physiology of intertidal organisms. In the fingered limpet, Lottia digitalis, we investigated whether upper temperature tolerance and thermal sensitivity were influenced by the pattern of fluctuation with which thermal stress was applied. Specifically, we examined whether there was a differential response (measured as cardiac performance) to repeated heat stress of a constant and predictable magnitude compared with heat stress applied in a stochastic and unpredictable nature. We also investigated differences in cellular metabolism and damage following immersion for insights into biochemical mechanisms of tolerance. Upper temperature tolerance increased with aerial exposure, but no significant differences were found between predictable treatments of varying magnitudes (13 degrees C versus 24 degrees C versus 32 degrees C). Significant differences in thermal tolerance were found between unpredictable trials with different heating patterns. There were no significant differences among treatments in basal citrate synthase activity, glycogen content, oxidative stress or antioxidants. Our results suggest that aerial exposure and recent thermal history, paired with relief from high low-tide temperatures, are important factors modulating the capacity of limpets to deal with thermal stress.",2017,220,17,3072-3083
Upper thermal limits of growth in brook trout and their relationship to stress physiology,"Chadwick, Joseph G. and McCormick, Stephen D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.161224,"Despite the threat of climate change, the physiological mechanisms responsible for reduced performance at high temperatures remain unclear for most species. Elevated but sublethal temperatures may act via endocrine and cellular stress responses to limit performance in important life-history traits such as growth. Here, brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) subjected to chronically elevated or daily oscillating temperatures were monitored for growth and physiological stress responses. Growth rate decreased at temperatures above 16 degrees C and was negative at 24 degrees C, with an estimated upper limit for positive growth of 23.4 degrees C. Plasma cortisol increased with temperature and was 12- and 18-fold higher at 22 and 24 degrees C, respectively, than at 16 degrees C, whereas plasma glucose was unaffected by temperature. Abundance of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in the gill increased with temperature and was 11- and 56-fold higher at 22 degrees C and 24 degrees C, respectively, than at 16 degrees C. There was no relationship between temperature and plasma Cl-, but there was a 53\% and 80\% decrease in gill Na+/K+-ATPase activity and abundance at 24 degrees C in comparison with 16 degrees C. Daily temperature oscillations of 4 degrees C or 8 degrees C (19-23 degrees C or 17-25 degrees C) were compared with 21 degrees C controls. Growth rate decreased with temperature and was 43\% and 35\% lower by length and mass, respectively, in the 8 degrees C daily oscillation treatment than in the controls. There was no effect of temperature oscillation on plasma cortisol or glucose levels. In contrast, gill HSP70 abundance increased with increasing daily oscillation and was 40- and 700-fold greater at 4 degrees C and 8 degrees C daily oscillation, respectively, than in the constant temperature controls. In individuals exposed to 17-25 degrees C diel oscillations for 4 days and then allowed to recover at 21 degrees C, gill HSP70 abundance was still elevated after 4 days recovery, but not after 10 days. Our results demonstrate that elevated temperatures induce cellular and endocrine stress responses and provide a possible mechanism by which growth is limited at elevated temperatures.

Thermal preference does not align with optimal temperature for aerobic scope in zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>),"Ripley, Daniel M. and Quinn, Florence A. and Dickson, Jessica and Arthur, Jack and Shiels, Holly A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.243774,"Warming is predicted to have negative consequences for fishes by causing a mismatch between oxygen demand and supply, and a consequent reduction in aerobic scope (AS) and performance.

We tested this hypothesis using intermittent flow respirometry to measure AS at, above (+2.5 degrees C) and below (-2.5 degrees C) the self-selected, preferred temperature (T-pref) of individual zebrafish (Danio rerio). AS was greatest 2.5 degrees C above T-pref, which was driven by an increase in maximal metabolic rate.

Additionally, temperature-induced hormone-mediated stress response pathways and energetic tradeoffs are important drivers of life-history variation. This study employs an integrative approach to quantify acute physiological responses to high temperatures in divergent life-history ecotypes of the western terrestrial garter snake (Thamnophis elegans). Using wild-caught animals, we measured oxygen consumption rate and physiological markers of hormonal stress response, energy availability and anaerobic respiration in blood plasma across five ecologically relevant temperatures (24, 28, 32, 35 and 38 degrees C; 3 h exposure). Corticosterone, insulin and glucose concentrations all increased with temperature, but with different thermal response curves, suggesting that high temperatures differently affect energy-regulation pathways. Additionally, oxygen consumption rate increased without plateau and lactate concentration did not increase with temperature, challenging the recent hypothesis that oxygen limitation sets upper thermal tolerance limits. Finally, animals had similar physiological thermal responses to high-temperature exposure regardless of genetic background, suggesting that local adaptation has not resulted in fixed differences between ecotypes. Together, these results identify some of the mechanisms by which higher temperatures alter hormonal-mediated energy balance in reptiles and potential limits to the flexibility of this response.",2016,219,18,2944-2954
Thermal acclimation leads to variable muscle responses in two temperate labrid fishes,"Moran, Clinton J. and Jebb, Kamryn E. and Travitz, Leksi and Coughlin, David J. and Gerry, Shannon P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.235226,"Temperature can be a key abiotic factor in fish distribution, as it affects most physiological processes. Specifically, temperature can affect locomotor capabilities, especially as species are exposed to temperatures nearing their thermal limits. In this study, we aimed to understand the effects of temperature on muscle in two labrids that occupy the Northwest Atlantic Ocean. When exposed to cold temperatures in autumn, cunner (Tautogolabrus adspersus) and tautog (Tautoga onitis) go into a state of winter dormancy. Transitions into dormancy vary slightly, where tautog will make short migrations to overwintering habitats while cunner overwinter in year-round habitats. To understand how muscle function changes with temperature, we held fish for 4 weeks at either 5 or 20 degrees C and then ran muscle kinetic and workloop experiments at 5,10 and 20 degrees C. Following experiments, we used immunohistochemistry staining to identify acclimation effects on myosin isoform expression. Muscle taken from warm-acclimated cunner performed the best, whereas there were relatively few differences among the other three groups. Gunner acclimated at both temperatures downregulated the myosin heavy chain, suggesting a transition in fiber type from slow-oxidative to fast-glycolytic. This change did not amount to a detectable difference in muscle power production and kinetics. However, overall poor performance at cold temperatures could force these fishes into torpor to overwinter. Tautog, alternatively, retained myosin heavy chains, which likely increases locomotor capabilities when making short migrations to overwintering habitats.",2020,223,24,NA
Elucidating mechanisms for insect body size: partial support for the oxygen-dependent induction of moulting hypothesis,"Kivela, Sami M. and Viinamaki, Sonja and Keret, Netta and Gotthard, Karl and Hohtola, Esa and Valimaki, Panu",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.166157,"Body size is a key life history trait, and knowledge of its mechanistic basis is crucial in life history biology. Such knowledge is accumulating for holometabolous insects, whose growth is characterised and body size affected by moulting. According to the oxygen-dependent induction of moulting (ODIM) hypothesis, moult is induced at a critical mass at which oxygen demand of growing tissues overrides the supply from the tracheal respiratory system, which principally grows only at moults. Support for the ODIM hypothesis is controversial, partly because of a lack of proper data to explicitly test the hypothesis. The ODIM hypothesis predicts that the critical mass is positively correlated with oxygen partial pressure (P-O2) and negatively with temperature. To resolve the controversy that surrounds the ODIM hypothesis, we rigorously test these predictions by exposing penultimate-instar Orthosia gothica (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) larvae to temperature and moderate P-O2 manipulations in a factorial experiment. The relative mass increment in the focal instar increased along with increasing P-O2, as predicted, but there was only weak suggestive evidence of the temperature effect. Probably owing to a high measurement error in the trait, the effect of P-O2 on the critical mass was sex specific; high P-O2 had a positive effect only in females, whereas low P-O2 had a negative effect only in males. Critical mass was independent of temperature. Support for the ODIM hypothesis is partial because of only suggestive evidence of a temperature effect on moulting, but the role of oxygen in moult induction seems unambiguous. The ODIM mechanism thus seems worth considering in body size analyses.",2018,221,2,NA
Low-O<sub>2</sub> acclimation shifts the hypoxia avoidance behaviour of snapper (<i>Pagrus auratus</i>) with only subtle changes in aerobic and anaerobic function,"Cook, Denham G. and Iftikar, Fathima I. and Baker, Daniel W. and Hickey, Anthony J. R. and Herbert, Neill A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.073023,"It was hypothesised that chronic hypoxia acclimation (preconditioning) would alter the behavioural low-O-2 avoidance strategy of fish as a result of both aerobic and anaerobic physiological adaptations. Avoidance and physiological responses of juvenile snapper (Pagrus auratus) were therefore investigated following a 6 week period of moderate hypoxia exposure (10.2-12.1 kPa P-O2, 21 +/- 1 degrees C) and compared with those of normoxic controls (P-O2=20-21 kPa, 21 +/- 1 degrees C). The critical oxygen pressure (P-crit) limit of both groups was unchanged at similar to 7 kPa, as were standard, routine and maximum metabolic rates. However, hypoxia-acclimated fish showed increased tolerances to hypoxia in behavioural choice chambers by avoiding lower P-O2 levels (3.3 +/- 0.7 vs 5.3 +/- 1.1 kPa) without displaying greater perturbations of lactate or glucose. This behavioural change was associated with unexpected physiological adjustments. For example, a decrease in blood O-2 carrying capacity was observed after hypoxia acclimation. Also unexpected was an increase in whole-blood P-50 following acclimation to low O-2, perhaps facilitating Hb-O-2 off-loading to tissues. In addition, cardiac mitochondria measured in situ using permeabilised fibres showed improved O-2 uptake efficiencies. The proportion of the anaerobic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase, at least relative to the aerobic marker enzyme citrate synthase, also increased in heart and skeletal red muscle, indicating enhanced anaerobic potential, or in situ lactate metabolism, in these tissues. Overall, these data suggest that a prioritization of O-2 delivery and O-2 utilisation over O-2 uptake during long-term hypoxia may convey a significant survival benefit to snapper in terms of behavioural low-O-2 tolerance.",2013,216,3,369-378

Here, we examined effects of high temperature on the intertidal limpet Cellana toreuma to determine how the temperatures at which (1) organ failure (cardiac function), (2) irreversible protein damage (carbonylation) and (3) expression of genes encoding proteins involved in molecular chaperoning (hsp70 and hsp90) and metabolic regulation (ampk and sirt1) occur compare with field temperatures, which commonly exceed 30 degrees C and can reach 46 degrees C. Heart failure, indexed by the Arrhenius break temperature, occurred at 34.3 degrees C. Protein carbonylation rose significantly at 38 degrees C. Genes for heat shock proteins HSP70 (hsp70) and HSP90 (hsp90), for two subunits of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (ampk alpha and ampk beta) and for histone/protein deacetylase SIRT1 (sirt1) all showed increased expression at 30 degrees C. Temperatures of maximal expression differed among genes, as did temperatures at which upregulation ceased. Expression patterns for ampk and sirt1 indicate that heat stress influenced cellular energy homeostasis; above similar to 30 degrees C, upregulation of ATP-generating pathways is suggested by elevated expression of genes for ampk; an altered balance between reliance on carbohydrate and lipid fuels is indicated by changes in expression of sirt1. These results show that C. toreuma commonly experiences temperatures that induce expression of genes associated with the stress response (hsp70 and hsp90) and regulation of energy metabolism (ampk and sirt1). At high temperatures, there is likely to be a shift away from anabolic processes such as growth to catabolic processes, to provide energy for coping with stress-induced damage, notably to proteins.",2013,216,17,3273-3282
Acute heat tolerance of cardiac excitation in the brown trout (<i>Salmo trutta fario</i>),"Vornanen, Matti and Haverinen, Jaakko and Egginton, Stuart",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.091272,"The upper thermal tolerance and mechanisms of heat-induced cardiac failure in the brown trout (Salmo trutta fario) was examined. The point above which ion channel function and sinoatrial contractility in vitro, and electrocardiogram (ECG) in vivo, started to fail (break point temperature, BPT) was determined by acute temperature increases. In general, electrical excitation of the heart was most sensitive to heat in the intact animal (electrocardiogram, ECG) and least sensitive in isolated cardiac myocytes (ion currents). BPTs of Ca2+ and K+ currents of cardiac myocytes were much higher (>28 degrees C) than BPT of in vivo heart rate (23.5 +/- 0.6 degrees C) (P<0.05). A striking exception among sarcolemmal ion conductances was the Na+ current (I-Na), which was the most heat-sensitive molecular function, with a BPT of 20.9 +/- 0.5 degrees C. The low heat tolerance of I-Na was reflected as a low BPT for the rate of action potential upstroke in vitro (21.7 +/- 1.2 degrees C) and the velocity of impulse transmission in vivo (21.9 +/- 2.2 degrees C). These findings from different levels of biological organization strongly suggest that heat-dependent deterioration of Na+ channel function disturbs normal spread of electrical excitation over the heart, leading to progressive variability of cardiac rhythmicity (missed beats, bursts of fast beating), reduction of heart rate and finally cessation of the normal heartbeat. Among the cardiac ion currents I-Na is `the weakest link' and possibly a limiting factor for upper thermal tolerance of electrical excitation in the brown trout heart. Heat sensitivity of I-Na may result from functional requirements for very high flux rates and fast gating kinetics of the Na+ channels, i.e. a trade-off between high catalytic activity and thermal stability.",2014,217,2,299-309
Ecologically relevant thermal fluctuations enhance offspring fitness: biological and methodological implications for studies of thermal developmental plasticity,"Hall, Joshua M. and Warner, Daniel A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.231902,"Natural thermal environments are notably complex and challenging to mimic in controlled studies. Consequently, our understanding of the ecological relevance and underlying mechanisms of organismal responses to thermal environments is often limited. For example, studies of thermal developmental plasticity have provided key insights into the ecological consequences of temperature variation, but most laboratory studies use treatments that do not reflect natural thermal regimes. While controlling other important factors, we compared the effects of naturally fluctuating temperatures with those of commonly used laboratory regimes on development of lizard embryos and offspring phenotypes and survival. We incubated eggs in four treatments: three that followed procedures commonly used in the literature, and one that precisely mimicked naturally fluctuating nest temperatures. To explore context-dependent effects, we replicated these treatments across two seasonal regimes: relatively cool temperatures from nests constructed early in the season and warm temperatures from late-season nests. We show that natural thermal fluctuations have a relatively small effect on developmental variables but enhance hatchling performance and survival at cooler temperatures. Thus, natural thermal fluctuations are important for successful development and simpler approximations (e.g. repeated sine waves, constant temperatures) may poorly reflect natural systems under some conditions. Thus, the benefits of precisely replicating real-world temperatures in controlled studies may outweigh logistical costs. Although patterns might vary according to study system and research goals, our methodological approach demonstrates the importance of incorporating natural variation into controlled studies and provides biologists interested in thermal ecology with a framework for validating the effectiveness of commonly used methods.",2020,223,19,NA
Contributions of phenotypic plasticity to differences in thermogenic performance between highland and lowland deer mice,"Cheviron, Zachary A. and Bachman, Gwendolyn C. and Storz, Jay F.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.075598,"Small mammals face especially severe thermoregulatory challenges at high altitude because the reduced O-2 availability constrains the capacity for aerobic thermogenesis. Adaptive enhancement of thermogenic performance under hypoxic conditions may be achieved via physiological adjustments that occur within the lifetime of individuals (phenotypic plasticity) and/or genetically based changes that occur across generations, but their relative contributions to performance differences between highland and lowland natives are unclear. Here, we examined potentially evolved differences in thermogenic performance between populations of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) that are native to different altitudes. The purpose of the study was to assess the contribution of phenotypic plasticity to population differences in thermogenic performance under hypoxia. We used a common-garden deacclimation experiment to demonstrate that highland deer mice have enhanced thermogenic capacities under hypoxia, and that performance differences between highland and lowland mice persist when individuals are born and reared under common-garden conditions, suggesting that differences in thermogenic capacity have a genetic basis. Conversely, population differences in thermogenic endurance appear to be entirely attributable to physiological plasticity during adulthood. These combined results reveal distinct sources of phenotypic plasticity for different aspects of thermogenic performance, and suggest that thermogenic capacity and endurance may have different mechanistic underpinnings.",2013,216,7,1160-1166
Enhanced fertility and chill tolerance after cold-induced reproductive arrest in females of temperate species of the <i>Drosophila buzzatii</i> complex,"Mensch, Julian and Hurtado, Juan and Zermoglio, Paula F. and de la Vega, Gerardo and Rolandi, Carmen and Schilman, Pablo E. and Markow, Therese A. and Hasson, Esteban",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.150540,"Long-term exposure to low temperatures during adult maturation might decrease fertility after cold recovery as a consequence of carry-over effects on reproductive tissues. This pattern should be more pronounced in tropical than in temperate species as protective mechanisms against chilling injuries are expected to be more effective in the latter. We initially determined the lower thermal thresholds to induce ovarian maturation in four closely related Drosophila species, two inhabiting temperate regions and the other two tropical areas of South America. As expected, only temperate species regularly experience cold-inducing conditions for reproductive arrest during winter in their natural environment. Subsequently, we exposed reproductively arrested and mature females to cold-inducing conditions for reproductive arrest over a long period. Following cold exposure, tropical species exhibited a dramatic fertility decline, irrespective of reproductive status. In contrast, not only were temperate females fecund and fertile but also fertility was superior in females that underwent cold-induced reproductive arrest, suggesting that it might act as a protecting mechanism ensuring fertility after cold recovery. Based on these findings, we decided to evaluate the extent to which reproductive status affects cold tolerance and energy metabolism at low temperature. We found a lower metabolic rate and a higher cold tolerance in reproductively arrested females, although only temperate species attained high levels of chill tolerance. These findings highlight the role of cold-induced reproductive arrest as part of an integrated mechanism of cold adaptation that could potentially contribute to the spread of temperate species into higher latitudes or altitudes.",2017,220,4,713-721
Effects of body size on the oxygen sensitivity of dragonfly flight,"Henry, Joanna Randyl and Harrison, Jon Fewell",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.095828,"One hypothesis for the small size of insects relative to vertebrates, and the existence of giant fossil insects, is that atmospheric oxygen levels constrain insect body sizes because oxygen delivery is more challenging in larger insects. This study tested this hypothesis in dragonflies by measuring the oxygen sensitivity of flight metabolic rates and behavior during hovering for 11 species of dragonflies that ranged in mass by an order of magnitude. We measured flight times and flight metabolic rates in seven oxygen concentrations ranging from 30\% to 2.5\% to assess the sensitivity of their flight to atmospheric oxygen. We also assessed the oxygen sensitivity of flight in low-density air (nitrogen replaced with helium) in order to increase the metabolic demands of hovering flight. Lowered atmospheric densities did induce higher flight metabolic rates. Flight behavior was more sensitive to decreasing oxygen levels than flight metabolic rate. The oxygen sensitivity of flight metabolic rates and behaviors were not correlated with body size, indicating that larger insects are able to maintain an oxygen supply-to-demand balance even during flight.",2014,217,19,3447-3456
Individual variation in heat substitution: is activity in the cold energetically cheaper for some individuals than others?,"Maloney, Caroline and Careau, Vincent",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.244186,"In many endotherms, a potentially important yet often overlooked mechanism to save energy is the use of the heat generated by active skeletal muscles to replace heat that would have been generated by thermogenesis (i.e. `activity-thermoregulatory heat substitution'). While substitution has been documented numerous times, the extent of individual variation in substitution has never been quantified. Here, we used a home-cage respirometry system to repeatedly measure substitution through the concomitant monitoring of metabolic rate (MR) and locomotor activity in 46 female white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus). A total of 117 measures of substitution were taken by quantifying the difference in the slope of the relationship between MR and locomotor activity speed at two different ambient temperatures. Consistency repeatability (+/- s.e.) of substitution was 0.313 (+/- 0.131); hence, about a third of the variation in substitution occurs at the among-individual level. Body length and heart mass were positively correlated with substitution whereas surface area was negatively correlated with substitution. These three sub-organismal traits accounted for the majority of the among-individual variation (i.e. individual differences in substitution were not significant after accounting for these traits). Overall, our results imply that the energetic cost of activity below the thermoneutral zone is consistently cheaper from some individuals than others, and that the energy saved from substitution might be available to invest in fitness-enhancing activities.",2022,225,18,NA
High-frequency temperature variability mirrors fixed differences in thermal limits of the massive coral <i>Porites lobata</i>,"Barshis, Daniel J. and Birkeland, Charles and Toonen, Robert J. and Gates, Ruth D. and Stillman, Jonathon H.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.188581,"Spatial heterogeneity in environmental characteristics can drive adaptive differentiation when contrasting environments exert divergent selection pressures. This environmental and genetic heterogeneity can substantially influence population and community resilience to disturbance events. Here, we investigated corals from the highly variable back-reef habitats of Ofu Island in American Samoa that thrive in thermal conditions known to elicit widespread bleaching and mortality elsewhere. To investigate the relative importance of acclimation versus site of origin in shaping previously observed differences in coral tolerance limits at Ofu Island, specimens of the common Indo-Pacific coral Porites lobata from locations with differing levels of thermal variability were acclimated to low and high thermal variation in controlled common garden aquaria. Overall, there were minimal effects of the acclimation exposure. Corals native to the site with the highest level of daily variability grew fastest, regardless of acclimation treatment. When exposed to lethal thermal stress, corals native to both variable sites contained elevated levels of heat shock proteins and maintained photosynthetic performance for 1-2 days longer than corals from the stable environment. Despite being separated by <5 km, there was significant genetic differentiation among coral colonies (F-ST=0.206, P<0.0001; nuclear ribosomal DNA), whereas Symbiodiniaceae were all Cladocopium sp. (ITS type C15). Our study demonstrates consistent signatures of adaptation in growth and stress resistance in corals from naturally thermally variable habitats, suggesting that differences in the amount of thermal variability may be an important contributor to adaptive differentiation in reef-building corals.",2018,221,24,NA
Evidence for a role of heme oxygenase-1 in the control of cardiac function in zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) larvae exposed to hypoxia,"Tzaneva, Velislava and Perry, Steve F.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.136853,"Carbon monoxide (CO) is a gaseous neurotransmitter produced from the breakdown of heme via heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1; hypoxia-inducible isoform) and heme oxygenase-2 (HO-2; constitutively expressed isoform). In mammals, CO is involved in modulating cardiac function. The role of the HO-1/CO system in the control of heart function in fish, however, is unknown and investigating its physiological function in lower vertebrates will provide a better understanding of the evolution of this regulatory mechanism. We explored the role of the HO-1/CO system in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) in vivo by investigating the impact of translational gene knockdown of HO-1 on cardiac function. Immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of HO-1 in the pacemaker cells of the heart at 4 days post-fertilization and thus the potential for CO production at these sites. Sham-treated zebrafish larvae (experiencing normal levels of HO-1) significantly increased heart rate (f(H)) when exposed to hypoxia (Pw(O2) = 30 mmHg). Zebrafish larvae lacking HO-1 expression after morpholino knockdown (morphants) exhibited significantly higher f(H) under normoxic (but not hypoxic) conditions when compared with sham-treaded fish. The increased f(H) in HO-1 morphants was rescued (f(H) was restored to control levels) after treatment of larvae with a CO-releasing molecule (40 mu mol l(-1) CORM). The HO-1-deficient larvae developed significantly larger ventricles and when exposed to hypoxia they displayed higher cardiac output ((Q)) over dot and stroke volume (SV). These results suggest that under hypoxic conditions, HO-1 regulates (Q) over dot and SV presumably via the production of CO. Overall, this study provides a better understanding of the role of the HO-1/CO system in controlling heart function in lower vertebrates. We demonstrate for the first time the ability for CO to be produced in presumptive pacemaker cells of the heart where it plays an inhibitory role in setting the resting cardiac frequency.",2016,219,10,1563-1571
Proteomic data reveal a physiological basis for costs and benefits associated with thermal acclimation,"Kristensen, Torsten N. and Kjeldal, Henrik and Schou, Mads F. and Nielsen, Jeppe Lund",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.132696,"Physiological adaptation through acclimation is one way to cope with temperature changes. Biochemical studies on acclimation responses in ectotherms have so far mainly investigated consequences of short-term acclimation at the adult stage and focussed on adaptive responses. Here, we assessed the consequences of rearing Drosophila melanogaster at low (12 degrees C), benign (25 degrees C) and high (31 degrees C) temperatures. We assessed cold and heat tolerance and obtained detailed proteomic profiles of flies from the three temperatures. The proteomic profiles provided a holistic understanding of the underlying biology associated with both adaptive and non-adaptive temperature responses. Results show strong benefits and costs across tolerances: rearing at low temperature increased adult cold tolerance and decreased adult heat tolerance and vice versa with development at high temperatures. In the proteomic analysis, we were able to identify and quantify a large number of proteins compared with previous studies on ectotherms (1440 proteins across all replicates and rearing regimes), enabling us to extend the proteomic approach using enrichment analyses. This gave us detailed information on individual proteins, as well as pathways affected by rearing temperature, pinpointing potential mechanisms responsible for the strong costs and benefits of rearing temperature on functional phenotypes. Several well-known heat shock proteins, as well as proteins not previously associated with thermal stress, were among the differentially expressed proteins. Upregulation of proteasome proteins was found to be an important adaptive process at high-stress rearing temperatures, and occurs at the expense of downregulation of basal metabolic functions.",2016,219,7,969-976
"Chill coma temperatures appear similar along a latitudinal gradient, in contrast to divergent chill coma recovery times, in two widespread ant species","Maysov, Andrey",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.096958,"Populations of widely distributed ectotherms demonstrate different cold resistance corresponding to the local climate. However, efficiently thermoregulating ectotherms could avoid divergence in cold resistance. Two species of ants, previously shown to even out latitudinal differences of mean summer temperatures in their nests, were used to test this hypothesis by comparing the temperature dependence of cold resistance in three distant populations (from 50 degrees, 60 degrees and 67 degrees N). The species differ in habitat preferences, one (Myrmica rubra) being less stenotopic than the other (M. ruginodis). Therefore, three different predictions were made about their cold resistance: along the latitudinal gradient, it might be similar within the two species (because of thermoregulation within nests/habitats) or similar only in M. rubra (as a result of thermoregulation among habitats), or divergent at least in M. rubra (no effect of thermoregulation). Among populations of both species, neither differences nor latitudinal trends in chill coma temperature were statistically significant after 11 months of standard conditions, with or without cold hardening. In contrast, recovery time significantly differed among populations in both species, although its latitudinal trends were strongly curvilinear: in M. rubra, the intermediate population tended towards the slowest recovery, and in M. ruginodis, it tended towards the fastest. After 22 months, the patterns remained the same, except that M. ruginodis showed a significant linear latitudinal trend in chill coma temperature (with no significant populational differences). Hence, thermoregulation, both within and among habitats, apparently does keep chill coma temperatures similar. Recovery rate demonstrates divergence, but its curvilinear trends suggest a connection with climates experienced by ancestral populations.",2014,217,15,2650-2658
Ventilation rates and activity levels of juvenile jumbo squid under metabolic suppression in the oxygen minimum zone,"Truebenbach, Katja and Pegado, Maria R. and Seibel, Brad A. and Rosa, Rui",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.072587,"The Humboldt (jumbo) squid, Dosidicus gigas, is a part-time resident of the permanent oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) in the Eastern Tropical Pacific and, thereby, it encounters oxygen levels below its critical oxygen partial pressure. To better understand the ventilatory mechanisms that accompany the process of metabolic suppression in these top oceanic predators, we exposed juvenile D. gigas to the oxygen levels found in the OMZ (1\% O-2, 1 kPa, 10 degrees C) and measured metabolic rate, activity cycling patterns, swimming mode, escape jet (burst) frequency, mantle contraction frequency and strength, stroke volume and oxygen extraction efficiency. In normoxia, metabolic rate varied between 14 and 29 mu mol O(2)g(-1) wet mass h(-1), depending on the level of activity. The mantle contraction frequency and strength were linearly correlated and increased significantly with activity level. Additionally, an increase in stroke volume and ventilatory volume per minute was observed, followed by a mantle hyperinflation process during high activity periods. Squid metabolic rate dropped more than 75\% during exposure to hypoxia. Maximum metabolic rate was not achieved under such conditions and the metabolic scope was significantly decreased. Hypoxia changed the relationship between mantle contraction strength and frequency from linear to polynomial with increasing activity, indicating that, under hypoxic conditions, the jumbo squid primarily increases the strength of mantle contraction and does not regulate its frequency. Under hypoxia, jumbo squid also showed a larger inflation period (reduced contraction frequency) and decreased relaxed mantle diameter (shortened diffusion pathway), which optimize oxygen extraction efficiency (up to 82\%/34\%, without/with consideration of 60\% potential skin respiration). Additionally, they breathe `deeply', with more powerful contractions and enhanced stroke volume. This deep-breathing behavior allows them to display a stable ventilatory volume per minute, and explains the maintenance of the squid's cycling activity under such O-2 conditions. During hypoxia, the respiratory cycles were shorter in length but increased in frequency. This was accompanied by an increase in the number of escape jets during active periods and a faster switch between swimming modes. In late hypoxia (onset similar to 170 +/- 10 min), all the ventilatory processes were significantly reduced and followed by a lethargic state, a behavior that seems closely associated with the process of metabolic suppression and enables the squid to extend its residence time in the OMZ.",2013,216,3,359-368
Critical thermal limits affected differently by developmental and adult thermal fluctuations,"Salachan, Paul Vinu and Sorensen, Jesper Givskov",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.165308,"Means and variances of the environmental thermal regime play an important role in determining the fitness of terrestrial ectotherms. Adaptive phenotypic responses induced by heterogeneous temperatures have been shown to be mediated by molecular pathways independent of the classic heat shock responses; however, an in-depth understanding of plasticity induced by fluctuating temperatures is still lacking. We investigated high and low temperature acclimation induced by fluctuating thermal regimes at two different mean temperatures, at two different amplitudes of fluctuation and across the developmental and adult life stages of Drosophila melanogaster. For developmental acclimation, we found mildly detrimental effects of high-amplitude fluctuations for critical thermal minima, while the critical thermal maxima showed a beneficial response to higher amplitude fluctuations. For adult acclimation involving shifts between fluctuating and constant regimes, cold tolerance was shown to be dictated by developmental temperature conditions irrespective of the adult treatments, while the acquired heat tolerance was readily lost when flies developed at fluctuating temperature were shifted to a constant regime as adults. Interestingly, we also found that the effect of fluctuations at any life stage was gradually lost with prolonged adult maintenance, suggesting a more prominent effect of fluctuations during developmental compared with adult acclimation in D. melanogaster.",2017,220,23,4471-4478

Knowledge of how invasive species respond physiologically and behaviorally to novel and changing environments can improve our understanding of which traits enable the ecological success of these species, and potentially facilitate mitigation efforts. We examined the effects of acclimation to temperatures ranging from 5 to 28 degrees C on aerobic metabolic rates, upper temperature tolerance (critical thermal maximum, CTmax), as well as temperature preference T-pref) and avoidance (T-avoid) of the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), one of the most impactful invasive species in the world. We show that round goby maintained a high aerobic scope from 15 to 28 degrees C; that is, the capacity to increase its aerobic metabolic rate above that of its maintenance metabolism remained high across a broad thermal range. Although CTmax increased relatively little with acclimation temperature compared with other species, T-pref and T-avoid were not affected by acclimation temperature at all, meaning that round goby maintained a large thermal safety margin (CTmax, T-avoid) across acclimation temperatures, indicating a high level of thermal resilience in this species. The unperturbed physiological performance and high thermal resilience were probably facilitated by high levels of phenotypic buffering, which can make species readily adaptable and ecologically competitive in novel and changing environments. We suggest that these physiological and behavioral traits could be common for invasive species, which would only increase their success under continued climate change.",2021,224,1,NA
Early exposure to UV radiation causes telomere shortening and poorer condition later in life,"Lundsgaard, Niclas U. and Cramp, Rebecca L. and Franklin, Craig E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.243924,"Determining the contribution of elevated ultraviolet-B radiation (UVBR; 280-315 nm) to amphibian population declines is being hindered by a lack of knowledge about how different acute UVBR exposure regimes during early life-history stages might affect post-metamorphic stages via long-term carryover effects. We acutely exposed tadpoles of the Australian green tree frog (Litoria caerulea) to a combination of different UVBR irradiances and doses in a multifactorial laboratory experiment, and then reared them to metamorphosis in the absence of UVBR to assess carryover effects in subsequent juvenile frogs. Dose and irradiance of acute UVBR exposure influenced carryover effects into metamorphosis in somewhat opposing manners. Higher doses of UVBR exposure in larvae yielded improved rates of metamorphosis. However, exposure at a high irradiance resulted in frogs metamorphosing smaller in size and in poorer condition than frogs exposed to low and medium irradiance UVBR as larvae. We also demonstrate some of the first empirical evidence of UVBR-induced telomere shortening in vivo, which is one possible mechanism for life-history trade-offs impacting condition post-metamorphosis. These findings contribute to our understanding of how acute UVBR exposure regimes in early life affect later life-history stages, which has implications for how this stressor may shape population dynamics.",2022,225,17,NA
Adenosine and γ-aminobutyric acid partially regulate metabolic and ventilatory responses of Damaraland mole-rats to acute hypoxia,"Devereaux, Maiah E. M. and Pamenter, Matthew E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.246186,"Fossorial Damaraland mole-rats (Fukomys damarensis) mount a robust hypoxic metabolic response (HMR) but a blunted hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) to acute hypoxia. Although these reflex physiological responses have been described previously, the underlying signalling pathways are entirely unknown. Of particular interest are contributions from gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the nervous system of most adult mammals, and adenosine, the accumulation of which increases during hypoxia as a breakdown product of ATP. Therefore, we hypothesized that GABAergic and/or adenosinergic signalling contributes to the blunted HVR and robust HMR in Damaraland mole-rats. To test this hypothesis, we injected adult animals with saline alone (controls), or 100 mg kg-1 aminophylline or 1 mg kg-1 bicuculline, to block adenosine or GABAA receptors, respectively. We then used respirometry, plethysmography and thermal RFID probes to non-invasively measure metabolic, ventilator and thermoregulatory responses, respectively, to acute hypoxia (1 h in 5 or 7\% O2) in awake and freely behaving animals. We found that bicuculline had relatively minor effects on metabolism and thermoregulation but sensitized ventilation such that the HVR became manifest at 7\% instead of 5\% O2 and was greater in magnitude. Aminophylline increased metabolic rate, ventilation and body temperature in normoxia, and augmented the HMR and HVR. Taken together, these findings indicate that adenosinergic and GABAergic signalling play important roles in mediating the robust HMR and blunted HVR in Damaraland mole-rats.",2023,226,19,NA

In addition, we explored the effects of short-term acclimation on swim performance, maximum metabolic rate ((M) over dot(O2,max)) and gill remodelling to detect habitat-associated patterns of plastic response to hypoxia. Indices of hypoxia tolerance included oxygen threshold for loss of equilibrium (LOE50) and aquatic surface respiration (ASR(50)), and critical oxygen tension for routine metabolic rate (P-crit). Critical swimming speed (U-crit) and (M) over dot(O2,max), max were measured under normoxic and hypoxic conditions after 48 h acclimation to normoxia and hypoxia, and gill remodelling was estimated after 48 h of hypoxia exposure. Both traditional ANCOVA and phylogenetically independent contrast (PDANOVA) analyses showed that fish species from rapid-flow habitats exhibited lower LOE50 compared with fish from intermediate-and slow-flow habitats. Habitat-specific differences in P-crit and U-crit were detected using PDANOVA but not traditional ANCOVA analyses, with fish species from rapid-flow habitats exhibiting lower P-crit but higher U-crit values compared with fish from intermediate-and slow-flow habitats. Fish species from rapid-flow habitats were also characterized by less plasticity in swim performance and gill morphology in response to hypoxia acclimation compared with species from slow-flow habitats, but a greater drop in swim performance in response to acute hypoxia exposure. The study detected a habitat-specific difference in hypoxia tolerance, swimming performance and its plasticity among fish from habitats with different flow conditions, possibly because of the long-term adaptation to the habitat caused by selection stress. The PDANOVA analyses were more powerful than traditional statistical analyses according to the habitat effects in both hypoxia tolerance and swimming performance in this study.",2014,217,4,590-597
The role of reduced oxygen in the developmental physiology of growth and metamorphosis initiation in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>,"Callier, Viviane and Shingleton, Alexander W. and Brent, Colin S. and Ghosh, Shampa M. and Kim, Jinkyu and Harrison, Jon F.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.093120,"Rearing oxygen level is known to affect final body size in a variety of insects, but the physiological mechanisms by which oxygen affects size are incompletely understood. In Manduca sexta and Drosophila melanogaster, the larval size at which metamorphosis is initiated largely determines adult size, and metamorphosis is initiated when larvae attain a critical mass. We hypothesized that oxygen effects on final size might be mediated by oxygen effects on the critical weight and the ecdysone titers, which regulate growth rate and the timing of developmental transitions. Our results showed that oxygen affected critical weight, the basal ecdysone titers and the timing of the ecdysone peak, providing clear evidence that oxygen affected growth rate and developmental rate. Hypoxic third instar larvae (10\% oxygen) exhibited a reduced critical weight, slower growth rate, delayed pupariation, elevated baseline ecdysone levels and a delayed ecdysone peak that occurred at a lower larval mass. Hyperoxic larvae exhibited increased basal ecdysone levels, but no change in critical weight compared with normoxic larvae and no significant change in timing of pupariation. Previous studies have shown that nutrition is crucial for regulating growth rate and the timing of developmental transitions. Here we show that oxygen level is one of multiple cues that together regulate adult size and the timing and dynamics of growth, developmental rate and ecdysone signaling.",2013,216,23,4334-4340

We made repeated measurements of basal and summit metabolic rates via flow-through respirometry and of body composition using quantitative magnetic resonance of live birds. At the end of the acclimation period, we measured thermal conductance of the combined feathers and skins. Cold-acclimated birds had a higher summit metabolic rate, reflecting a greater capacity for endogenous heat generation, and an increased lean mass. However, birds did not alter their thermal conductance. These results suggest that chickadees respond to cold stress by increasing their capacity for heat production rather than increasing heat retention, an energetically expensive strategy.",2023,226,19,NA
"Hypoxia-seeking behavior, metabolic depression and skeletal muscle function in an amphibious fish out of water","Rossi, Giulia S. and Wright, Patricia A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.213355,"Several animals enter a state of dormancy to survive harsh environmental conditions. During dormancy, metabolic depression can be critical for economizing on limited endogenous energy reserves. We used two isogenic strains (strain 1 and strain 2) of a self-fertilizing amphibious fish (Kryptolebias marmoratus) to test the hypothesis that animals seek hypoxic microhabitats that, in turn, accentuate metabolic depression during dormancy. Using custombuilt tunnels that maintained a longitudinal O-2 gradient (hypoxic to normoxic), we assessed the O-2 preference of K. marmoratus during prolonged air exposure. In support of our hypothesis, we found that one isogenic strain (strain 2) spent more time in hypoxia compared with normoxia after 21 days in air. Prolonged air exposure in both strains resulted in lower O-2 consumption rates compared with active fish (35\% depression), which was accentuated (51\% depression) when fish were exposed to aerial hypoxia acutely. We then tested the hypothesis that chronic aerial hypoxia acclimation would protect endogenous energy reserves and skeletal muscle integrity, thereby maintaining locomotor performance, possibly owing to hypoxic hypometabolism. We found that air-acclimated fish from both strains were in poorer body condition relative to fish acclimated to aerial hypoxia. Furthermore, aerial hypoxia acclimation minimized glycogen usage (strain 1), lipid catabolism (strain 2) and white muscle atrophy (strain 2), as well as preserved terrestrial locomotor performance compared with fish in air (strain 2). Overall, our findings suggest that some K. marmoratus strains seek microhabitats that accentuate metabolic depression during dormancy, and that microhabitat O-2 availability may have significant implications for energy metabolism, and the structure and function of skeletal muscle. Furthermore, the differential responses between isogenic strains suggests that genetic factors also contribute to phenotypic differences in the emersion behavior and physiology of this species.",2020,223,2,NA
Intermittent hypoxia leads to functional reorganization of mitochondria and affects cellular bioenergetics in marine molluscs,"Ivanina, Anna V. and Nesmelova, Irina and Leamy, Larry and Sokolov, Eugene P. and Sokolova, Inna M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.134700,"Fluctuations in oxygen (O-2) concentrations represent a major challenge to aerobic organisms and can be extremely damaging to their mitochondria. Marine intertidal molluscs are well-adapted to frequent O-2 fluctuations, yet it remains unknown how their mitochondrial functions are regulated to sustain energy metabolism and prevent cellular damage during hypoxia and reoxygenation (H/R). We used metabolic control analysis to investigate the mechanisms of mitochondrial responses to H/R stress (18 h at <0.1\% O-2 followed by 1 h of reoxygenation) using hypoxia-tolerant intertidal clams Mercenaria mercenaria and hypoxia-sensitive subtidal scallops Argopecten irradians as models. We also assessed H/R-induced changes in cellular energy balance, oxidative damage and unfolded protein response to determine the potential links between mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular injury. Mitochondrial responses to H/R in scallops strongly resembled those in other hypoxia-sensitive organisms. Exposure to hypoxia followed by reoxygenation led to a strong decrease in the substrate oxidation (SOX) and phosphorylation (PHOS) capacities as well as partial depolarization of mitochondria of scallops. Elevated mRNA expression of a reactive oxygen species-sensitive enzyme aconitase and Lon protease (responsible for degradation of oxidized mitochondrial proteins) during H/R stress was consistent with elevated levels of oxidative stress in mitochondria of scallops. In hypoxia-tolerant clams, mitochondrial SOX capacity was enhanced during hypoxia and continued rising during the first hour of reoxygenation. In both species, the mitochondrial PHOS capacity was suppressed during hypoxia, likely to prevent ATP wastage by the reverse action of F-O,F-1-ATPase. The PHOS capacity recovered after 1 h of reoxygenation in clams but not in scallops. Compared with scallops, clams showed a greater suppression of energy-consuming processes (such as protein turnover and ion transport) during hypoxia, indicated by inactivation of the translation initiation factor EIF-2 alpha, suppression of 26S proteasome activity and a dramatic decrease in the activity of Na+/K+-ATPase. The steady-state levels of adenylates were preserved during H/R exposure and AMP-dependent protein kinase was not activated in either species, indicating that the H/R exposure did not lead to severe energy deficiency. Taken together, our findings suggest that mitochondrial reorganizations sustaining high oxidative phosphorylation flux during recovery, combined with the ability to suppress ATP-demanding cellular functions during hypoxia, may contribute to high resilience of clams to H/R stress and help maintain energy homeostasis during frequent H/R cycles in the intertidal zone.",2016,219,11,1659-1674
Effects of intermittent hypoxia on oxidative stress and protein degradation in molluscan mitochondria,"Ivanina, Anna V. and Sokolova, Inna M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.146209,"Oxygen fluctuations represent a common stressor in estuarine and intertidal environments and can compromise the mitochondrial integrity and function in marine organisms. We assessed the role of mitochondrial protection mechanisms (ATP-dependent and -independent mitochondrial proteases, and antioxidants) in tolerance to intermittent hypoxia or anoxia in three species of marine bivalves: hypoxia-tolerant hard clams (Mercenaria mercenaria) and oysters (Crassostrea virginica), and a hypoxia-sensitive subtidal scallop (Argopecten irradians). In clams and oysters, mitochondrial tolerance to hypoxia (18 h at 5\% O-2), anoxia (18 h at 0.1\% O-2) and subsequent reoxygenation was associated with the ability to maintain the steadystate activity of ATP-dependent and-independent mitochondrial proteases and an anticipatory upregulation of the total antioxidant capacity under the low oxygen conditions. No accumulation of endproducts of lipid or protein peroxidation was found during intermittent hypoxia oranoxiain clams and oysters (except foran increase in protein carbonyl concentration after hypoxia-reoxygenation in oysters). In contrast, hypoxia/anoxia and reoxygenation strongly suppressed activity of the ATP-dependent mitochondrial proteases in hypoxiasensitive scallops. This suppressionwas associated with accumulation of oxidatively damaged mitochondrial proteins (including carbonylated proteins and proteins conjugated with a lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde) despite high total antioxidant capacity levels in scallop mitochondria. These findings highlight a key role of mitochondrial proteases in protection against hypoxia-reoxygenation stress and adaptations to frequent oxygen fluctuations in intertidal mollusks.",2016,219,23,3794-3802
Effect of diet quality and ambient temperature on the use of torpor by two species of neotropical nectar-feeding bats,"Ayala-Berdon, Jorge and Vazquez-Fuerte, Rommy and Beamonte-Barrientos, Rene and Schondube, Jorge E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.142422,"Neotropical bats use torpor as a strategy to save energy when they experience a low energy intake and/or low ambient temperature (T-a). Digestive physiology limits the energy intake of several glossophaginid bats, and could play an important role in the onset of torpor in these tropical animals. We measured the effect that diet quality and T-a had on the use of torpor by the nectar-feeding bats Glossophaga soricina and Leptonycteris yerbabuenae. Captive bats were fed with 5\% (low) or 35\% ( high) sucrose solutions while exposed to two different T-a (17.7 and 23.2 degrees C; low T-a and high T-a) in four different treatments: (1) high sucrose: high T-a, (2) high sucrose: low T-a, (3) low sucrose: high T-a and (4) low sucrose: low T-a. We measured their energy intake, changes in body mass (Delta M-b) and skin temperature (T-skin) as response variables. Energy intake (in 10 h) was limited when both species fed on 5\% sucrose, but body mass gain was only affected in G. soricina. Energy intake and T-a had a negative effect on the minimum T-skin of both species, and Delta M-b affected the time that G. soricina used torpor. Both species remained normothermic on the high sucrose: high T-a treatment, but used torpor on the other three treatments. Bats used torpor during their resting and activity periods. Leptonycteris yerbabuenae spent more time in torpor in the low sucrose: high T-a treatment, while G. soricina used this strategy for longer periods of time in the high sucrose: low T-a treatment. We found that diet quality and T-a played an important role in the use of torpor by nectar-feeding bats.",2017,220,5,920-929
Lowering metabolic rate mitigates muscle atrophy in western fence lizards,"Balaban, Jordan and Azizi, Emanuel",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.154294,"Extended periods of skeletal muscle disuse can cause a significant loss of contractile proteins, which compromises the ability to generate force, mechanical work or power, thus compromising locomotor performance. Several hibernating organisms can resist muscle atrophy despite months of inactivity. This resistance has been attributed to a reduction in body temperature and metabolic rate and activation of physiological pathways that counteract pathways of protein degradation. However, in these systems, such strategies are not mutually exclusive and the effects of these mechanisms can be difficult to separate. In this study, we used the western fence lizard, Sceloporus occidentalis, as an ectothermic model to determine whether a reduction in metabolic rate is sufficient to resist muscle atrophy. We induced atrophy through sciatic denervation of the gastrocnemius muscle and housed lizards at either 15 or 30 degrees C for 6-7 weeks. Following treatment, we used muscle ergometry to measure maximum isometric force, the force-velocity relationship and contractile dynamics in the gastrocnemius. This approach allowed us to relate changes in the size and morphology to functional metrics of contractile performance. A subset of samples was used to histologically determine muscle fiber types. At 30 degrees C, denervated muscles had a larger reduction in muscle mass, physiological cross-sectional area and maximum isometric force than at 15 degrees C. Maximum shortening velocity of the muscle decreased slightly in animals housed at 30 degrees C but did not change in those housed at 15 degrees C. Our results suggest that metabolic rate alone can influence the rate of muscle atrophy and that ectothermic vertebrates may have an intrinsic mechanism to resist muscle atrophy during seasonal periods of inactivity.",2017,220,15,2748-2756
Hungry or angry? Experimental evidence for the effects of food availability on two measures of stress in developing wild raptor nestlings,"Catitti, Benedetta and Grueebler, Martin U. and Kormann, Urs G. and Scherler, Patrick and Witczak, Stephanie and van Bergen, Valentijn S. and Jenni-Eiermann, Susanne",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.244102,"Food shortage challenges the development of nestlings; yet, to cope with this stressor, nestlings can induce stress responses to adjust metabolism or behaviour. Food shortage also enhances the antagonism between siblings, but it remains unclear whether the stress response induced by food shortage operates via the individual nutritional state or via the social environment experienced. In addition, the understanding of these processes is hindered by the fact that effects of food availability often co-vary with other environmental factors. We used a food supplementation experiment to test the effect of food availability on two complementary stress measures, feather corticosterone (CORTf) and heterophil/lymphocyte ratio (H/L) in developing red kite (Mi/vus milvus) nestlings, a species with competitive brood hierarchy. By statistically controlling for the effect of food supplementation on the nestlings' body condition, we disentangled the effects of food and ambient temperature on nestlings during development. Experimental food supplementation increased body condition, and both CORTf and H/L were reduced in nestlings of high body condition. Additionally, CORTf decreased with age in non-supplemented nestlings. H/L decreased with age in all nestlings and was lower in supplemented last-hatched nestlings compared with non-supplemented ones. Ambient temperature showed a negative effect on H/L. Our results indicate that food shortage increases the nestlings' stress levels through a reduced food intake affecting both their nutritional state and their social environment. Thus, food availability in conjunction with ambient temperature shapes between- and within-nest differences in stress load, which may have carry-over effects on behaviour and performance in further life-history stages.",2022,225,15,NA
Influence of reproductive mode on metabolic costs of reproduction: insight from the bimodal lizard <i>Zootoca vivipara</i>,"Foucart, Thomas and Lourdais, Olivier and DeNardo, Dale F. and Heulin, Benoit",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.104315,"Examination of the selective forces behind the transition from oviparity to viviparity in vertebrates must include an understanding of the relative energy costs of the two reproductive modes. However, interspecific comparisons of reproductive mode are confounded by numerous other inherent differences among the species. Therefore, we compared oxygen consumption, as a reflection of energy costs, during reproduction in oviparous and viviparous females of the reproductively bimodal lizard Zootoca vivipara (Jaquin 1787). Female oxygen consumption progressively increased over the course of reproduction, peaking just prior to parition when it was 46\% (oviparous form) and 82\% (viviparous form) higher than it was at the pre-reproductive stage. Total increase in oxygen consumption (TIOC) during the pre-ovulation period was not different between the reproductive modes. Conversely, post-ovulation TIOC was more than three times higher in viviparous females, reflecting a dramatic increase in embryonic metabolism as well as maternal metabolic costs of pregnancy (MCP). MCP accounted for 22\% of total metabolism in viviparous females, whereas it was negligible in oviparous females. Our results demonstrate that egg retention through the first third of development, as is typical of most oviparous squamates, entails minimal maternal energy demand, while extending retention imposes much greater metabolic constraints. Selection for transition from oviparity to viviparity must therefore provide benefits that outweigh not only the added burden associated with prolonged embryonic retention, but also the substantial additional energy costs that are incurred.",2014,217,22,4049-4056
Modulating offspring responses: concerted effects of stress and immunogenic challenge in the parental generation,"Giayetto, Octavio and Videla, Emiliano A. and Chacana, Pablo and Jaime, Cristian and Marin, Raul H. and Nazar, F. Nicolas",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.219386,"The perception. processing and response to environmental challenges involves the activation of the immuno-neuroendocrine (INE) interplay. Concerted environmental challenges might induce trade-off when resource allocation to one trait occurs at the expense of another, also producing potential transgenerational effects in the offspring. We evaluated whether concerted challenges, in the form of an immune inoculum against inactivated Salmonella enteritidis (immune challenge, ICH) and a chronic heat stress (CHS) exposure on adult Japanese quail, modulate the INE responses of the parental generation and their offspring. Adults were inoculated and later exposed to a CHS along nine consecutive days. For the last 5 days of the CHS, eggs were collected for incubation. Chicks were identified according to their parental treatments and remained undisturbed. Induced inflammatory response, heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio and specific humoral response against sheep red blood cells (SRBC) were evaluated in both generations. Regardless of the ICH, stressed adults showed a reduced inflammatory response and an elevated H/L ratio compared with controls. In offspring, the inflammatory response was elevated and the specific SRBC antibody titres were diminished in those chicks prenatally exposed to CHS, regardless of the ICH. No differences were found in the H/L ratio of the offspring. Together, our results suggest that CHS exposure influences the INE interplay of adult quail, establishing trade-offs within their immune system. Moreover, CHS not only affected parental INE responses but also modulated their offspring INE responses, probably affecting their potential to respond to future challenges. The adaptability of the developmental programming of offspring would depend on the environment encountered.",2020,223,17,NA
Ontogeny of risk assessment and escape-hatching performance by red-eyed treefrog embryos in two threat contexts,"Guell, Brandon A. and Jung, Julie and Almanzar, Adeline and Cuccaro-Diaz, Juliana and Warkentin, Karen M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.244533,"Arboreal embryos of red-eyed treefrogs, Agalychnis callidryas, hatch prematurely in response to hypoxia when flooded and to mechanosensory cues in snake attacks, but hatching later improves tadpole survival. We studied ontogenetic changes in risk assessment and hatching performance of embryos in response to flooding and physical disturbance. We hypothesized that risk assessment decreases as hatchling survival improves and hatching performance increases as embryos develop. Because snakes eat faster than embryos asphyxiate, we hypothesized that embryos decide to hatch sooner and hatch faster in response to mechanosensory cues. We video-recorded individual embryos hatching in response to each cue type, then compared the incidence and timing of a series of events and behaviors from cue onset to complete hatching across ages and stimuli. Latency from cue to hatching decreased developmentally in both contexts and was shorter with mechanosensory cues, but the elements contributing to those changes differed. Hypoxia assessment involved position changes, which decreased developmentally along with assessment time. Mechanosensory cue assessment occurred more rapidly, without movement, and decreased with age. The first stages of hatching, membrane rupture and head emergence, were surprisingly age independent but faster with mechanosensory cues, congruent with greater effort under more immediate risk. In contrast, body emergence and compression showed ontogenetic improvement consistent with morphological constraints but no cue effect. Both appropriate timing and effective performance of hatching are necessary for continued development. Different stages of the process vary with development and environmental context, suggesting combinations of adaptive context- and stage-dependent behavior, cue-related constraints on information acquisition, and ontogenetic constraints on elements of performance.",2022,225,20,NA
Wood frog adaptations to overwintering in Alaska: new limits to freezing tolerance,"Larson, Don J. and Middle, Luke and Vu, Henry and Zhang, Wenhui and Serianni, Anthony S. and Duman, John and Barnes, Brian M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.101931,"We investigated the ecological physiology and behavior of free-living wood frogs {[}Lithobates (Rana) sylvaticus] overwintering in Interior Alaska by tracking animals into natural hibernacula, recording microclimate, and determining frog survival in spring. We measured cryoprotectant (glucose) concentrations and identified the presence of antifreeze glycolipids in tissues from subsamples of naturally freezing frogs. We also recorded the behavior of wood frogs preparing to freeze in artificial hibernacula, and tissue glucose concentrations in captive wood frogs frozen in the laboratory to -2.5 degrees C. Wood frogs in natural hibernacula remained frozen for 193 +/- 11 consecutive days and experienced average (October-May) temperatures of -6.3 degrees C and average minimum temperatures of -14.6 +/- 2.8 degrees C (range -8.9 to -18.1 degrees C) with 100\% survival (N=18). Mean glucose concentrations were 13-fold higher in muscle, 10-fold higher in heart and 3.3-fold higher in liver in naturally freezing compared with laboratory frozen frogs. Antifreeze glycolipid was present in extracts from muscle and internal organs, but not skin, of frozen frogs. Wood frogs in Interior Alaska survive freezing to extreme limits and durations compared with those described in animals collected in southern Canada or the Midwestern United States. We hypothesize that this enhancement of freeze tolerance in Alaskan wood frogs is due to higher cryoprotectant levels that are produced by repeated freezing and thawing cycles experienced under natural conditions during early autumn.",2014,217,12,2193-2200

However, measuring the energy expenditure of animals in the field has proved difficult, especially for aquatic taxa. Accelerometry presents a means of translating metabolic rates measured in the laboratory to individuals studied in the field, pending appropriate laboratory calibrations. Such calibrations have only been performed on a few fish species to date, and only one where the effects of temperature were accounted for. Here, we present calibrations between activity, measured as overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA), and metabolic rate, measured through respirometry, for nurse sharks (Ginglymostoma cirratum), lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris) and blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus). Calibrations were made at a range of volitional swimming speeds and experimental temperatures. Linear mixed models were used to determine a predictive equation for metabolic rate based on measured ODBA values, with the optimal model using ODBA in combination with activity state and temperature to predict metabolic rate in lemon and nurse sharks, and ODBA and temperature to predict metabolic rate in blacktip sharks. This study lays the groundwork for calculating the metabolic rate of these species in the wild using acceleration data.",2017,220,3,397-407
Long-term programming effect of embryonic hypoxia exposure and high-carbohydrate diet at first feeding on glucose metabolism in juvenile rainbow trout,"Liu, Jingwei and Dias, Karine and Plagnes-Juan, Elisabeth and Veron, Vincent and Panserat, Stephane and Marandel, Lucie",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.161406,"Environmental conditions experienced during early life play an important role in the long-term metabolic status of individuals. The present study investigated whether hypoxia exposure {[}for 24 h: 2.5 mg O-2 l(-1) (20\% dissolved O-2)] during the embryonic stage alone (hypoxic history) or combined with a 5-day high-carbohydrate (60\%) diet stimulus at first feeding (HC dietary history) can affect glucose metabolism later in life, i.e. in juvenile fish. After 19 weeks of growth, we observed a decrease in final body mass in fish with an HC dietary history. Feed efficiency was significantly affected by both hypoxic and HC dietary histories. After a short challenge test (5 days) performed with a 30\% carbohydrate diet in juvenile trout, our results also showed that, in trout that experienced hypoxic history, mRNA levels of gluconeogenic genes in liver and glucose transport genes in both liver and muscle were significantly increased at the juvenile stage. Besides, mRNA levels of glycolytic genes were decreased in fish with an HC dietary history. Both hypoxic and dietary histories barely affected plasma metabolites or global epigenetic modifications in juvenile fish after the challenge test. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that an acute hypoxic stimulus during early development alone or combined with a hyperglucidic stimulus at first feeding can modify growth performance and glucose metabolism at the molecular level in juvenile trout.",2017,220,20,3686-3694
Stress inhibition of melatonin synthesis in the pineal organ of rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) is mediated by cortisol,"Lopez-Patino, Marcos A. and Gesto, Manuel and Conde-Sieira, Marta and Soengas, Jose L. and Miguez, Jesus M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.087916,"Cortisol has been suggested to mediate the effect of stress on pineal melatonin synthesis in fish. Therefore, we aimed to determine how pineal melatonin synthesis is affected by exposing rainbow trout to different stressors, such as hypoxia, chasing and high stocking density. In addition, to test the hypothesis that cortisol is a mediator of such stress-induced effects, a set of animals were intraperitoneally implanted with coconut oil alone or containing cortisol (50 mg kg(-1) body mass) and sampled 5 or 48 h post-injection at midday and midnight. The specificity of such effect was also assessed in cultured pineal organs exposed to cortisol alone or with the general glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, mifepristone (RU486). Stress (in particular chasing and high stocking density) affected the patterns of plasma and pineal organ melatonin content during both day and night, with the greatest reduction occurring at night. The decrease in nocturnal melatonin levels in the pineal organ of stressed fish was accompanied by increased serotonin content and decreased AANAT2 enzymatic activity and mRNA abundance. Similar effects on pineal melatonin synthesis to those elicited by stress were observed in trout implanted with cortisol for either 5 or 48 h. These data indicate that stress negatively influences the synthesis of melatonin in the pineal organ, thus attenuating the day-night variations of circulating melatonin. The effect might be mediated by increased cortisol, which binds to trout pineal organ-specific glucocorticoid receptors to modulate melatonin rhythms. Our results in cultured pineal organs support this. Considering the role of melatonin in the synchronization of daily and annual rhythms, the results suggest that stress-induced alterations in melatonin synthesis could affect the availability of fish to integrate rhythmic environmental information.",2014,217,8,1407-1416

If an animal fails to acclimate to these stressors, stress becomes chronic, and a condition of allostatic overload arises with negative results for animal welfare. In the current study, we describe effects of exposing Atlantic salmon parr to an unpredictable chronic stressor (UCS) paradigm for 3 weeks. The paradigm involves exposure of fish to seven unpredictable stressors three times a day. At the end of the trial, experimental and control fish were challenged with yet another novel stressor and sampled before and 1 h after that challenge. Plasma cortisol decreased steadily over time in stressed fish, indicative of exhaustion of the endocrine stress axis. This was confirmed by a lower cortisol response to the novel stressor at the end of the stress period in chronically stressed fish compared with the control group. In the preoptic area (POA) and pituitary gland, chronic stress resulted in decreased gene expression of 11 beta hsd2, gr1 and gr2 in the POA and increased expression of those genes in the pituitary gland. POA crf expression and pituitary expression of pomcs and mr increased, whereas interrenal gene expression was unaffected. Exposure to the novel stressor had no effect on POA and interrenal gene expression. In the pituitary, crfr1, pomcs, 11 beta hsd2, grs and mr were downregulated.

Telomere elongation during early development is independent of environmental temperatures in Atlantic salmon,"McLennan, Darryl and Armstrong, John D. and Stewart, David C. and Mckelvey, Simon and Boner, Winnie and Monaghan, Pat and Metcalfe, Neil B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.178616,"There is increasing evidence from endothermic vertebrates that telomeres, which cap the ends of chromosomes and play an important role in chromosome protection, decline in length during postnatal life and are a useful indicator of physiological state and expected lifespan. However, much less is currently known about telomere dynamics in ectothermic vertebrates, which are likely to differ from that of endotherms, at least in part due to the sensitivity of ectothermphysiology to environmental temperature. We report here on an experiment in which Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were reared through the embryonic and larval stages of development, and under differing temperatures, in order to examine the effects of environmental temperature during early life on telomere dynamics, oxidative DNA damage and cellular proliferation. Telomere length significantly increased between the embryonic and larval stages of development. Contrary to our expectations, variation in telomere length at the end of the larval stage was unrelated to either cell proliferation rate or the relative level of oxidative DNA damage, and did not vary between the temperature treatments. This study suggests that salmon are able to restore the length of their telomeres during early development, which may possibly help to buffer potentially harmful environmental effects experienced in early life.",2018,221,11,NA
CRISPR-induced null alleles show that <i>Frost</i> protects <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> reproduction after cold exposure,"Newman, Claire E. and Toxopeus, Jantina and Udaka, Hiroko and Ahn, Soohyun and Martynowicz, David M. and Graether, Steffen P. and Sinclair, Brent J. and Percival-Smith, Anthony",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.160176,"The ability to survive and reproduce after cold exposure is important in all kingdoms of life. However, even in a sophisticated genetic model system like Drosophila melanogaster, few genes have been identified as functioning in cold tolerance. The accumulation of the Frost (Fst) gene transcript increases after cold exposure, making it a good candidate for a gene that has a role in cold tolerance. Despite extensive RNAi knockdown analysis, no role in cold tolerance has been assigned to Fst. CRISPR is an effective technique for completely knocking down genes, and is less likely to produce offtarget effects than GAL4-UAS RNAi systems. We have used CRISPR-mediated homologous recombination to generate Fst-null alleles, and these Fst alleles uncovered a requirement for FST protein in maintaining female fecundity following cold exposure. However, FST does not have a direct role in survival following cold exposure. FST mRNA accumulates in the Malpighian tubules, and the FST protein is a highly disordered protein with a putative signal peptide for export from the cell. Future work is needed to determine whether FST is exported from the Malpighian tubules and directly interacts with female reproductive tissues post-cold exposure, or whether it is required for other repair/recovery functions that indirectly alter energy allocation to reproduction.",2017,220,18,3344-3354
Prepubertal gonad investment modulates thymus function: evidence in a teleost fish,"Paiola, Matthieu and Moreira, Catarina and Hetru, Julie and Duflot, Aurelie and Pinto, Patricia I. S. and Scapigliati, Giuseppe and Knigge, Thomas and Monsinjon, Tiphaine",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.238576,"Thymus plasticity following gonadectomy or sex hormone replacement has long since exemplified sex hormone effects on the immune system in mammals and, to a lesser extent, in `lower vertebrates', including amphibians and fish. Nevertheless, the underlying physiological significances as well as the ontogenetic establishment of this crosstalk remain largely unknown. Here, we used a teleost fish, the European sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax, to investigate: (1) whether the regulation of thymus plasticity relies on resource trade-off with somatic growth and reproductive investment and (2) if the gonad-thymus interaction takes place during gonadal differentiation and development. Because gonadal development and, supposedly, thymus function in sea bass depend on environmental changes associated with the winter season, we evaluated thymus changes (foxnl expression, and thymocyte and T cell content) in juvenile D. labrax raised for 1 year under either constant or fluctuating photoperiod and temperature. Importantly, in both conditions, intensive gonadal development following sex differentiation coincided with a halt of thymus growth, while somatic growth continued. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing that gonadal development during prepuberty regulates thymus plasticity. This finding may provide an explanation for the initiation of the thymus involution related to ageing in mammals. Comparing fixed and variable environmental conditions, our work also demonstrates that the extent of the effects on the thymus, which are related to reproduction, depend on ecophysiological conditions, rather than being directly related to sexual maturity and sex hormone levels.",2021,224,7,NA

We evaluated the prevalence of vateritic otoliths from two captive rearing studies which suggested that fast growth, due to environmental rather than genetic control, led to vaterite development. We then tested this by varying light and temperature to create phenotypes with different growth rates, which resulted in fast growers (5 times larger) having 3 times more vaterite than slow growers. A decrease in either the ratio of otolith matrix proteins (otolin-1/OMM-64) or {[}Ca2+]/{[}CO32-] may explain why fast growth causes vaterite deposition.

Genetic and phenotypically flexible components of seasonal variation in immune function,"Versteegh, M. A. and Helm, B. and Kleynhans, E. J. and Gwinner, E. and Tieleman, B. I.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.097105,"Animals cope with seasonal variation in environmental factors by adjustments of physiology and life history. When seasonal variation is partly predictable, such adjustments can be based on a genetic component or be phenotypically flexible. Animals have to allocate limited resources over different demands, including immune function. Accordingly, immune traits could change seasonally, and such changes could have a genetic component that differs between environments. We tested this hypothesis in genotypically distinct groups of a widespread songbird, the stonechat (Saxicola torquata). We compared variation in immunity during 1 year in long-distance migrants, short-distance migrants, tropical residents and hybrids in a common garden environment. Additionally, we investigated phenotypically flexible responses to temperature by applying different temperature regimes to one group. We assessed constitutive immunity by measuring hemagglutination, hemolysis, haptoglobin and bactericidal ability against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Genotypic groups differed in patterns of variation of all measured immune indices except haptoglobin. Hybrids differed from, but were rarely intermediate to, parental subspecies. Temperature treatment only influenced patterns of hemolysis and bactericidal ability against E. coli. We conclude that seasonal variation in constitutive immunity has a genetic component, that heredity does not follow simple Mendelian rules, and that some immune measures are relatively rigid while others are more flexible. Furthermore, our results support the idea that seasonal variability in constitutive immunity is associated with variability in environment and annualcycle demands. This study stresses the importance of considering seasonal variation in immune function in relation to the ecology and life history of the organism of interest.",2014,217,9,1510-1518

We assessed whether individual differences in the timing of breeding in females are reflected in differences in candidate gene expression and, if so, whether these differences occur in the upstream (hypothalamus) or downstream (ovary and liver) parts of the neuroendocrine system. We used 72 female great tits from two generations of lines artificially selected for early and late egg laying, which were housed in climate-controlled aviaries and went through two breeding cycles within 1 year. In the first breeding season we obtained individual egg-laying dates, while in the second breeding season, using the same individuals, we sampled several tissues at three time points based on the timing of the first breeding attempt. For each tissue, mRNA expression levels were measured using qPCR for a set of candidate genes associated with the timing of reproduction and subsequently analysed for differences between generations, time points and individual timing of breeding. We found differences in gene expression between generations in all tissues, with the most pronounced differences in the hypothalamus. Differences between time points, and early- and late-laying females, were found exclusively in the ovary and liver. Altogether, we show that fine-tuning of the seasonal timing of breeding, and thereby the opportunity for adaptation in the neuroendocrine system, is regulated mostly downstream in the neuro-endocrine system.",2019,222,17,NA
Embryonic growth rate affects telomere attrition: an experiment in a wild bird,"Vedder, Oscar and Verhulst, Simon and Zuidersma, Erica and Bouwhuis, Sandra",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.181586,"High growth rate is associated with a short lifespan, but the physiological basis for this trade-off is not well known. Telomere length predicts individual lifespan and in this study we investigated whether embryonic growth rate, manipulated using incubation temperature, affects erythrocyte telomere length in a wild bird species, the common tern (Sterna hirundo). A 1 degrees C lower incubation temperature decreased growth rate by 5\%, without affecting size at hatching. The slower growth was associated with an average telomere length that was 147 base pairs longer at hatching. If carried through to adulthood, this effect would correspond with an approximately 3 year longer lifespan. Our results thus suggest that an effect of growth rate on lifespan may be mediated by telomere dynamics or a physiological process reflected by telomere length.",2018,221,15,NA
Food and temperature change photoperiodic responses in two vole species,"van Rosmalen, Laura and Hut, Roelof A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.243030,"Seasonal timing of reproduction in voles is driven by photoperiod. We hypothesized that a negative energy balance can modify spring-programmed photoperiodic responses in the hypothalamus, controlling reproductive organ development. We manipulated energy balance by the `work-for-food' protocol, in which voles were exposed to increasing levels of food scarcity at different ambient temperatures under long photoperiod. We found that in common voles (Microtus arvalis) and tundra voles (Microtus oeconomus), photoperiod-induced pars tuberalis thyroid-stimulating hormone beta-subunit (Tsh beta) expression is reduced to potentially inhibit gonadal development when food is scarce. Reduction in gonadal size is more pronounced in tundra voles, in which anterior hypothalamic Kiss1 is additionally downregulated, especially in males. Low temperature additionally leads to decreased hypothalamic Rfrp expression, which potentially may facilitate further suppression of gonadal growth. Shutting off the photoperiodic axis when food is scarce in spring may be an adaptive response to save energy, leading to delayed reproductive organ development until food resources are sufficient for reproduction, lactation and offspring survival. Defining the mechanisms through which metabolic cues modify photoperiodic responses will be important for a better understanding of how environmental cues impact reproduction.",2021,224,23,NA
Shift in worker physiology and gene expression pattern from reproductive to diapause-like with colony age in the bumble bee <i>Bombus impatiens</i>,"Treanore, Erin D. and Kiner, Jacklyn M. and Kerner, Mackenzie E. and Amsalem, Etya",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.218768,"Insects maximize their fitness by exhibiting predictable and adaptive seasonal patterns in response to changing environmental conditions. These seasonal patterns are often expressed even when insects are kept in captivity, suggesting they are functionally and evolutionarily important. In this study, we examined whether workers of the eusocial bumble bee Bombus impatiens maintained a seasonal signature when kept in captivity. We used an integrative approach and compared worker egg laying, ovarian activation, body size and mass, lipid content in the fat body, cold tolerance and expression of genes related to cold tolerance, metabolism and stress throughout colony development. We found that bumble bee worker physiology and gene expression patterns shift from reproductive-like to diapause-like as the colony ages. Workers eclosing early in the colony cycle had increased egg laying and ovarian activation, and reduced cold tolerance, body size, mass and lipid content in the fat body, in line with a reproductive-like profile, while late-eclosing workers exhibited the opposite characteristics. Furthermore, expression patterns of genes associated with reproduction and diapause differed between early- and late-eclosing workers, partially following the physiological patterns. We suggest that a seasonal signature, innate to individual workers, the queen or the colony, is used by workers as a social cue determining the phenology of the colony and discuss possible implications for understanding reproductive division of labor in bumble bee colonies and the evolutionary divergence of female castes in the genus Bombus.",2020,223,9,NA
Heart rate dynamics in a marsupial hibernator,"Swoap, Steven J. and Kortner, Gerhard and Geiser, Fritz",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.155879,"The eastern pygmy possum (Cercartetus nanus) is a small marsupial that can express spontaneous short bouts of torpor, as well as multi-day bouts of deep hibernation. To examine heart rate (f(H)) control at various stages of torpor in a marsupial hibernator, and to see whether fH variability differs from that of deep placental hibernators, we used radiotelemetry to measure ECG and body temperature (T-b) while measuring the rate of O-2 consumption and ventilation. f(H) and O-2 consumption rate during euthermia were at a minimum (321 +/- 34 beats min(-1), 0.705 +/- 0.048 ml O-2 g(-1) h(-1)) at an ambient temperature (T-a) of 31 degrees C. f(H) had an inverse linear relationship with T-a to a maximum of 630 +/- 19 beats min(-1) at a T-a of 20 degrees C. During entry into torpor at a Ta of 20 degrees C, f(H) slowed primarily as a result of episodic periods of cardiac activity where electrical activity of the heart occurred in groups of 3 or 4 heart beats. When T-b was stable at 24 degrees C in these torpor bouts, the episodic nature of f(H) had disappeared (i.e. no asystoles) with a rate of 34 +/- 3 beats min(-1). For multi-day bouts of deep torpor, T-a was lowered to 6.6 +/- 0.8 degrees C. During these deep bouts of torpor, T-b reached a minimum of 8.0 +/- 1.0 degrees C, with a minimum fH of 8 beats min(-1) and a minimum O-2 consumption rate of 0.029 +/- 0.07 ml O-2 g(-1) h(-1). Shivering bouts occurred in deep torpor about every 8 min, during which ventilation occurred, and f(H) was elevated to 40 beats min(-1). The duration of the QRS complex increased from 12 ms during euthermia to 69 ms at a Tb of 8 degrees C. These findings demonstrate the dynamic functioning range of f(H) to be about 600 beats min(-1) (similar to 80-fold), one of the largest known ranges in mammals. Our study shows that despite a separation of similar to 160 million years, the control and function of the cardiac system seems indistinguishable in marsupial and placental hibernating mammals.",2017,220,16,2939-2946

Despite a long history of research, the mechanistic causes of metabolic scaling with body size remain under debate. Some hypotheses suggest that intrinsic factors such as allometry of cellular and mitochondrial metabolism may contribute to the organismal-level metabolic scaling. The aim of our present study was to determine the metabolic allometry at the mitochondrial level using a continually growing marine ectotherm, the mussel Mytilus edulis, as a model. Mussels from a single cohort that considerably differed in body size were selected, implying faster growth in the larger specimens. We determined the body mass-dependent scaling of the mitochondrial proton leak respiration, respiration in the presence of ADP indicative of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and maximum activity of the mitochondrial electron transport system (ETS) and cytochrome c oxidase (COX). Respiration was measured at normal (15 degrees C), and elevated (27 degrees C) temperatures. The results demonstrated a pronounced allometric increase in both proton leak respiration and OXPHOS activity of mussel mitochondria. Mussels with faster growth (larger body size) showed an increase in OXPHOS rate, proton leak respiration rate, and ETS and COX activity (indicating an overall improved mitochondrial performance) and higher respiratory control ratio (indicating better mitochondrial coupling and potentially lower costs of mitochondrial maintenance at the same OXPHOS capacity) compared with slower growing (smaller) individuals. Our data show that the metabolic allometry at the organismal level cannot be directly explained by mitochondrial functioning.",2020,223,13,NA

We studied the selective use of fatty acids as an oxidative fuel in noctule bats (Nyctalus noctula). Prehibernating noctule bats that were fed C-13-enriched linoleic acid (LA) showed 12 times higher tracer oxidation rates compared with conspecifics fed C-13-enriched palmitic acid (PA). After this experiment, we supplemented the diet of bats with the same fatty acids on five subsequent days to enrich their fat depots with the respective tracer. We then compared the excess C-13-enrichment (excess atom percentage, APE) in breath of bats for torpor and arousal events during early and late hibernation. We observed higher APE values in breath of bats fed C-13-enriched LA than in bats fed C-13-enriched PA for both states (torpor and arousal), and also for both periods. Thus, hibernating bats selectively oxidized endogenous LA instead of PA, probably because of faster transportation rates of polyunsaturated fatty acids compared with saturated fatty acids. We did not observe changes in APE values in the breath of torpid animals between early and late hibernation. Skin temperature of torpid animals increased by 0.7 degrees C between early and late hibernation in bats fed PA, whereas it decreased by -0.8 degrees C in bats fed LA, highlighting that endogenous LA may fulfil two functions when available in excess: serving as an oxidative fuel and supporting cell membrane functionality.",2018,221,4,NA

Here, we tested this prediction in three species of damselfishes on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Maximum thermal limits were quantified using critical thermal maxima (CTmax) tests following acclimation to either presentday or end-of-century levels of CO2 for coral reef environments (similar to 500 or similar to 1000 mu atm, respectively). While species differed significantly in their thermal limits, whereby Dischistodus perspicillatus exhibited greater CTmax (37.88 +/- 0.03 degrees C; N=47) than Dascyllus aruanus (37.68 +/- 0.02 degrees C; N=85) and Acanthochromis polyacanthus (36.58 +/- 0.02 degrees C; N=63), end-of-century CO2 had no effect (D. aruanus) or a slightly positive effect (increase in CTmax of 0.16 degrees C in D. perspicillatus and 0.21 degrees C in A. polyacanthus) on CTmax. Contrary to expectations, early-stage juveniles were equally as resilient to CO2 as larger conspecifics, and CTmax was higher at smaller body sizes in two species. These findings suggest that ocean acidification will not impair the maximum thermal limits of reef fishes, and they highlight the critical role of experimental biology in testing predictions of theoretical models forecasting the consequences of environmental change.",2017,220,19,3519-3526

Embryos from four populations throughout the geographical range (New Jersey, South Carolina, Colorado, and Arizona) were warmed at a rate observed in natural nests. Embryos from all populations exhibited a similar pattern of thermal sensitivity, as follows: heart rate rose between 34 and 41 degrees C, remained stable between 41 and 44 degrees C, and dropped sharply between 44 and 47 degrees C.

However, the increase does not translate into improved growth, demonstrating that oxygen uptake is not the limiting factor for growth performance at high temperatures.

Swimming energetics of Atlantic salmon in relation to extended fasting at different temperatures,"Hvas, Malthe",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coac037,"Predicted future warming of aquatic environments could make fish vulnerable to naturally occurring fasting periods during migration between feeding and spawning sites, as these endeavours become energetically more expensive. In this study, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) acclimated to midrange (9 degrees C) or elevated suboptimal (18 degrees C) temperatures were subjected to critical (U-crit) and sustained (4 hours at 80\% U-crit) swimming trials before and after 4 weeks of fasting. Fasting caused weight losses of 7.3\% and 8.3\% at 9 degrees C and 18 degrees C, respectively. The Ucrit was unaffected by fasting, but higher at 18. C. Fatigue was associated with higher plasma cortisol, osmolality, Na+ and Cl- at 18 degrees C, and ionic disturbances were higher in fasted fish. All fish completed the sustained swim trials while maintaining constant oxygen uptake rates (M. O-2), indicating strictly aerobic swimming efforts. At low swimming speeds M. O-2 was downregulated in fasted fish by 23.8\% and 15.6\% at 9 degrees C and 18. C, respectively, likely as an adaptation to preserve resources. However, at higher speedsM. O-2 became similar to fed fish showing thatmaximummetabolic ratesweremaintained. The changes inM. O-2 loweredcostsof transport andoptimal swimmingspeeds in fasted fish at both temperatures, but these energetic alterations were smaller at 18 degrees C while routine M. O-2 was 57\% higher than at 9 degrees C. As such, this study shows that Atlantic salmon maintain both glycolytic and aerobic swimming capacities after extended fasting, even at elevated suboptimal temperatures, and adaptive metabolic downregulation provides increased swimming efficiency in fasted fish. Although, improved swimming energetics were smaller when fasting at the higher temperature while metabolism becomes elevated. This could affect migration success in warming climates, especially when considering interactions with other costly activities such as coping with parasites obtained when passing aquaculture sites during seaward travel or gonad development while being voluntarily anorexic during upriver travel to spawning grounds.",2022,10,1,NA
Adaptation of a mouse Doppler echocardiograph system for assessing cardiac function and thermal performance in a juvenile salmonid,"Muir, Carlie A. and Neff, Bryan D. and Damjanovski, Sashko",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coab070,"Measures of cardiac performance are pertinent to the study of thermal physiology and exercise in teleosts, particularly as they pertain to migration success. Increased heart rate, stroke volume and cardiac output have previously been linked to improved swimming performance and increased upper thermal tolerance in anadromous salmonids. To assess thermal performance in fishes, it has become commonplace to measure the response of maximum heart rate to warming using electrocardiograms. However, electrocardiograms do not provide insight into the hemodynamic characteristics of heart function that can impact whole-animal performance. Doppler echocardiography is a popular tool used to examine live animal processes, including real-time cardiac function. This method allows for nonsurgical measurements of blood flow velocity through the heart and has been used to detect abnormalities in cardiovascular function, particularly in mammals. Here, we show how a mouse Doppler echocardiograph system can be adapted for use in a juvenile salmonid over a range of temperatures and timeframes. Using this compact, noninvasive system, we measured maximum heart rate, atrioventricular (AV) blood flowvelocity, the early flow-atrial flow ratio and stroke distance in juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) during acute warming. Using histologically determined measures of AV valve area, we show how stroke distance measurements obtained with this system can be used to calculate ventricular inflow volume and approximate cardiac output. Further, we show how this Doppler system can be used to determine cardiorespiratory thresholds for thermal performance, which are increasingly being used to predict the consequences that warming water temperatures will have on migratory fishes.",2021,9,NA,NA

Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor collected in Lake Kayanja, Uganda, a population living near the upper thermal range of the species, were acclimated to 23, 26, 29 and 32 degrees C for 3 days directly after capture, and RMR and P-crit were then quantified. In a second group of P. multicolor from the same population, CTMax and the thermal onset of agitation were determined for fish acclimated to 26, 29 and 32 degrees C for 7 days. Both RMR and P-crit were significantly higher in fish acclimated to 32 degrees C, indicating decreased tolerance to hypoxia and increased metabolic requirements at temperatures only slightly (similar to 1 degrees C) above their natural thermal range. The CTMax increased with acclimation temperature, indicating some degree of thermal compensation induced by short-term exposure to higher temperatures. However, agitation temperature (likely to represent an avoidance response to increased temperature during CTMax trials) showed no increase with acclimation temperature. Overall, the results of this study demonstrate that P. multicolor is able to maintain its RMR and P-crit across the range of temperatures characteristic of its natural habitat, but incurs a higher cost of resting metabolism and reduced hypoxia tolerance at temperatures slightly above its present range.",2015,3,NA,NA
Hypoxia during incubation does not affect aerobic performance or haematology of Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>) when re-exposed in later life,"Wood, Andrew T. and Andrewartha, Sarah J. and Elliott, Nicholas G. and Frappell, Peter B. and Clark, Timothy D.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coz088,"Hypoxia in aquatic ecosystems is becoming increasingly prevalent, potentially reducing fish performance and survival by limiting the oxygen available for aerobic activities. Hypoxia is a challenge for conserving and managing fish populations and demands a better understanding of the short- and long-term impacts of hypoxic environments on fish performance. Fish acclimate to hypoxia via a variety of short- and long-term physiological modifications in an attempt to maintain aerobic performance. In particular, hypoxia exposure during early development may result in enduring cardio-respiratory modifications that affect future hypoxia acclimation capacity, yet this possibility remains poorly investigated. We incubated Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in normoxia (similar to 100\% dissolved oxygen {[}DO, as percent air saturation]), moderate hypoxia (similar to 63\% DO) or cyclical hypoxia (100-25\% DO daily) from fertilization until 113 days post-fertilization prior to rearing all groups in normoxia for a further 8 months. At similar to 11 months of age, subsets of each group were acclimated to hypoxia (50\% DO) for up to 44 days prior to haematology, aerobic metabolic rate and hypoxia tolerance measurements. Hypoxia exposure during incubation (fertilization to 113 days post-fertilization) did not affect the haematology, aerobic performance or hypoxia tolerance of juvenile salmon in later life. Juveniles acclimated to hypoxia increased maximum aerobic metabolic rate and aerobic scope by similar to 23 and similar to 52\%, respectively, when measured at 50\% DO but not at 100\% DO. Hypoxia-incubated juveniles also increased haematocrit and haemoglobin concentration but did not affect acute hypoxia tolerance (critical oxygen level and DO at LOE).

Ocean acidification does not limit squid metabolism via blood oxygen supply,"Birk, Matthew A. and McLean, Erin L. and Seibel, Brad A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.187443,"Ocean acidification is hypothesized to limit the performance of squid owing to their exceptional oxygen demand and pH sensitivity of blood-oxygen binding, which may reduce oxygen supply in acidified waters. The critical oxygen partial pressure (P-crit), the P-O2 below which oxygen supply cannot match basal demand, is a commonly reported index of hypoxia tolerance. Any CO2-induced reduction in oxygen supply should be apparent as an increase in P-crit. In this study, we assessed the effects of CO2 (46-143 Pa; 455-1410 mu atm) on the metabolic rate and P-crit of two squid species - Dosidicus gigas and Doryteuthis pealeii - through manipulative experiments. We also developed a model, with inputs for hemocyanin pH sensitivity, blood P-CO2 and buffering capacity, that simulates blood oxygen supply under varying seawater CO2 partial pressures. We compare model outputs with measured P-crit in squid. Using blood-O-2 parameters from the literature for model inputs, we estimated that, in the absence of blood acid-base regulation, an increase in seawater P-CO2 to 100 Pa (approximate to 1000 mu atm) would result in a maximum drop in arterial hemocyanin-O-2 saturation by 1.6\% at normoxia and a P-crit increase of approximate to 0.5 kPa.

Heat exposure limits pentose phosphate pathway activity in bumblebees,"Rossi, Giulia S. and Elbassiouny, Alaa and Jamison, Jerrica and Welch Jr, Kenneth C.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coae031,"Bumblebee declines threaten pollination services worldwide. We explored the physiological mechanisms that may explain why bumblebees are susceptible to heat stress. We discovered that elevated temperatures limit the activity of the pentose phosphate pathway-a parallel pathway to glycolysis that generates antioxidant potential crucial for mitigating oxidative stress. Bumblebee populations across the globe are experiencing substantial declines due to climate change, with major consequences for pollination services in both natural and agricultural settings. Using an economically important species, Bombus impatiens, we explored the physiological mechanisms that may cause susceptibility to extreme heat events. We tested the hypothesis that heat exposure limits the activity of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)-a parallel pathway to glycolysis that can use nectar sugar to generate antioxidant potential and combat oxidative stress. Using isotopically labelled glucose, we tracked PPP activity in B. impatiens at rest, during exercise and during a post-exercise recovery period under two different temperature regimes (22 degrees C and 32 degrees C). We found that the PPP is routinely used by B. impatiens at moderate temperatures, but that its activity is markedly reduced when ATP demands are high, such as during periods of exercise and heat exposure. We also exposed B. impatiens to either 22 degrees C or 32 degrees C for 5 hours and assessed levels of oxidative damage (lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyls) and antioxidant potential [}reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione concentrations]. Interestingly, bees exhibited little oxidative damage after the thermal exposure, but we found a lower GSH:GSSG ratio in 32 degrees C-exposed bees, reflecting lower antioxidant potential. Overall, our study demonstrates that acute heat stress severely limits PPP activity and may constrain antioxidant potential in B. impatiens. The repeated attenuation of this pathway in a warming climate may have more severe physiological consequences for this species, with potential implications for pollination services across North America.",2024,12,1,NA
Local cold adaption increases the thermal window of temperate mussels in the Arctic,"Thyrring, J. and Tremblay, R. and Sejr, M. K.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coz098,"Species expand towards higher latitudes in response to climate warming, but the pace of this expansion is related to the physiological capacity to resist cold stress. However, few studies exist that have quantified the level of inter-population local adaptation in marine species freeze tolerance, especially in the Arctic. We investigated the importance of cold adaptation and thermal window width towards high latitudes from the temperate to the Arctic region. We measured upper and lower lethal air temperatures (i.e. LT and LT50) in temperate and Arctic populations of blue mussels (Mytilus edulis), and analysed weather data and membrane fatty acid compositions, following emersion simulations. Both populations had similar upper LT (similar to 38 degrees C), but Arctic mussels survived 4 degrees C colder air temperatures than temperate mussels (-13 vs. -9 degrees C, respectively), corresponding to an 8\% increase in their thermal window. There were strong latitudinal relationships between thermal window width and local air temperatures, indicating Arctic mussels are highly adapted to the Arctic environment where the seasonal temperature span exceeds 60 degrees C. Local adaptation and local habitat heterogeneity thus allow leading-edge M. edulis to inhabit high Arctic intertidal zones. This intraspecific pattern provides insight into the importance of accounting for cold adaptation in climate change, conservation and biogeographic studies.",2019,7,NA,NA
Physiological plasticity in a successful invader: rapid acclimation to cold occurs only in cool-climate populations of cane toads (<i>Rhinella marina</i>),"McCann, Samantha M. and Kosmala, Georgia K. and Greenlees, Matthew J. and Shine, Richard",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/cox072,"Physiological plasticity may facilitate invasion of novel habitats; but is such plasticity present in all populations of the invader or is it elicited only by specific climatic challenges? In cold-climate areas of Australia, invasive cane toads (Rhinella marina) can rapidly acclimate to cool conditions. To investigate whether this physiological plasticity is found in all invasive cane toads or is only seen in cool climates, we measured the acclimation ability of toads from across Australia and the island of Hawai'i. We collected toads from the field and placed them at either 12 or 24 degrees C for 12 h before measuring their righting response as a proxy for critical thermal minimum (CTmin). Toads from the coolest Australian region (New South Wales) demonstrated plasticity (as previously reported), with exposure to 12 degrees C (vs. 24 degrees C) decreasing CTmin by 2 degrees C. In toads from other Australian populations, CTmins were unaffected by our thermal treatments. Hawai'ian toads from a cool, wet site also rapidly acclimated to cool conditions, whereas those from warmer and drier Hawai'ian sites did not. Thermal plasticity has diverged among populations of invasive cane toads, with rapid acclimation manifested only in two cool-climate populations from widely separated sites.

Predicted impacts of climate warming on aerobic performance and upper thermal tolerance of six tropical freshwater fishes spanning three continents,"Lapointe, Dominique and Cooperman, Michael S. and Chapman, Lauren J. and Clark, Timothy D. and Val, Adalberto L. and Ferreira, Marcio S. and Balirwa, John S. and Mbabazi, Dismas and Mwanja, Matthew and Chhom, Limhong and Hannah, Lee and Kaufman, Les and Farrell, Anthony P. and Cooke, Steven J.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coy056,"Equatorial fishes, and the critically important fisheries based on them, are thought to be at-risk from climate warming because the fishes have evolved in a relatively aseasonal environment and possess narrow thermal tolerance windows that are close to upper thermal limits. We assessed survival, growth, aerobic performance and critical thermal maxima (CTmax) following acute and 21 d exposures to temperatures up to 4 degrees C higher than current maxima for six species of freshwater fishes indigenous to tropical countries and of importance for human consumption. All six species showed 1.3-1.7 degrees C increases in CTmax with a 4 degrees C rise in acclimation temperature, values which match up well with fishes from other climatic regions, and five species had survival >87\% at all temperatures over the treatment period. Specific growth rates varied among and within each species in response to temperature treatments. For all species, the response of resting metabolic rate (RMR) was consistently more dynamic than for maximum metabolic rate, but in general both acute temperature exposure and thermal acclimation had only modest effects on aerobic scope (AS). However, RMR increased after warm acclimation in 5 of 6 species, suggesting incomplete metabolic compensation. Taken in total, our results show that each species had some ability to perform at temperatures up to 4 degrees C above current maxima, yet also displayed certain areas of concern for their long-term welfare. We therefore suggest caution against the overly broad generalization that all tropical freshwater fish species will face severe challenges from warming temperatures in the coming decades and that future vulnerability assessments should integrate multiple performance metrics as opposed to relying on a single response metric.

Recent research has revealed interpopulation variation among several species of Pacific salmonids; however, the environmental drivers of population differences remain elusive. We tested for local adaptation and countergradient variation by assessing interpopulation variation among six populations of fall-run Chinook Salmon from the western United States. Juvenile fish were reared at three temperatures (11, 16 and 20 \& DEG;C), and five physiological metrics were measured (routine and maximum metabolic rate, aerobic scope, growth rate and critical thermal maximum). We then tested associations between these physiological metrics and 15 environmental characteristics (e.g. rearing temperature, latitude, migration distance, etc.). Statistical associations between the five physiological metrics and 15 environmental characteristics supported our hypotheses of local adaptation. Notably, latitude was a poor predictor of population physiology. Instead, our results demonstrate that populations from warmer habitats exhibit higher thermal tolerance (i.e. critical thermal maxima), faster growth when warm acclimated and greater aerobic capacity at high temperatures. Additionally, populations with longer migrations exhibit higher metabolic capacity. However, overall metabolic capacity declined with warm acclimation, indicating that future climate change may reduce metabolic capacity, negatively affecting long-migrating populations. Linking physiological traits to environmental characteristics enables flexible, population-specific management of disparate populations in response to local conditions. Chinook Salmon exist as multiple distinct populations across the landscape and exhibit population-specific physiological traits (upper thermal tolerance, metabolic capacity and growth rate) consistent with a hypothesis of local adaptation to environmental conditions. Differences in thermal performance among Chinook Salmon have important implications for conservation and management.",2023,11,1,NA
Temperature effects on performance and physiology of two prairie stream minnows,"Frenette, Bryan D. and Bruckerhoff, Lindsey A. and Tobler, Michael and Gido, Keith B.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coz063,"Earth's atmosphere has warmed by similar to 1 degrees C over the past century and continues to warm at an increasing rate. Effects of atmospheric warming are already visible in most major ecosystems and are evident across all levels of biological organization. Linking functional responses of individuals to temperature is critical for predicting responses of populations and communities to global climate change. The southern redbelly dace Chrosomus erythrogaster and the central stoneroller Campostoma anomalum are two minnows (Cyprinidae) that commonly occur in the Flint Hills region of the USA but show different patterns of occurrence, with dace largely occupying headwater reaches and stonerollers persisting in both headwater and intermediate-sized streams. We tested for differences between species in critical thermal maximum, energy metabolism, sustained swimming and activity over an ecologically relevant temperature gradient of acclimation temperatures. Typically, metrics increased with acclimation temperature for both species, although stoneroller activity decreased with temperature. We observed a significant interaction between species and temperature for critical thermal maxima, where stonerollers only had higher critical thermal maxima at the coldest temperature and at warm temperatures compared to the dace. We did not find evidence suggesting differences in the energy metabolism of dace and stonerollers. We detected interspecific differences in sustained swimming performance, with dace having higher swimming speed than stonerollers regardless of acclimation temperature. Finally, there was a significant interaction between temperature and species for activity; dace activity was higher at intermediate and warm temperatures compared to stonerollers. We observed subtle interspecific differences in how performance metrics responded to temperature that did not always align with observed patterns of distribution for these species. Thus, other ecological factors likely are important drivers of distributional patterns in these species.",2019,7,NA,NA
Rapid adaptation to cold in the invasive cane toad Rhinella marina,"Mittan, Cinnamon S. and Zamudio, Kelly R.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coy075,"Invasive cane toads (Rhinella marina) in northern Florida experience the coldest temperatures anywhere in their native or invasive range. We test the thermal limits of toads from northern and southern Florida and find that northern toads are more tolerant of cold and have rapidly adapted to this novel environment. Abstract Understanding rapid adaptation to novel environments is essential as we face increasing climatic change. Invasive species are an ideal system for studying adaptation as they are typically introduced to novel environments where they must adapt if they are to persist. We used the invasive cane toad, Rhinella marina, to investigate the contribution of plasticity and evolution to rapid adaptation in a novel environment. Rhinella marina is a neotropical toad that has invaded areas with climates outside of its native environmental niche. The goal of this research was to understand how cane toads persist in northern Florida, the coldest region of their combined natural and invasive range, and originally thought to be beyond their thermal breadth. We measured Critical thermal minima in cane toads from the original, warm introduction location (Miami), and their northern range edge (Tampa) to determine whether northern toads were more cold-tolerant, and to examine the contribution of adaptive plasticity and evolution to any changes in tolerance. Our results show that following acclimation to cold temperatures, southern toads are less tolerant of cold than northern toads. This persistent population difference implies selection for cold-tolerance in northern populations. Differences in individual responses indicate that plasticity is also involved in this response. Our findings have implications for conservation because predatory cane toad invasions threaten local faunas, especially native amphibians. Characterizing specific adaptive mechanisms that allow R. marina to expand its range will identify evolutionary processes that shape a highly successful invasive species.",2019,7,NA,NA

We evaluated aspects of aerobic metabolism and cardiorespiratory physiology of juvenile emerald rockcod, Trematomus bernacchii, an abundant fish in the Ross Sea, Antarctica, to elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide (P-CO2) {[}420 (ambient), 650 (moderate) and 1050 (high) mu atm P-CO2] over a 1 month period. We examined cardiorespiratory physiology, including heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output and ventilation rate, whole organism metabolism via oxygen consumption rate and sub-organismal aerobic capacity by citrate synthase enzyme activity. Juvenile fish showed an increase in ventilation rate under high P-CO2 compared with ambient P-CO2, whereas cardiac performance, oxygen consumption and citrate synthase activity were not significantly affected by elevated P-CO2. Acclimation time had a significant effect on ventilation rate, stroke volume, cardiac output and citrate synthase activity, such that all metrics increased over the 4 week exposure period. These results suggest that juvenile emerald rockcod are robust to near-future increases in OA and may have the capacity to adjust for future increases in P-CO2 by increasing acid-base compensation through increased ventilation.",2016,219,8,1203-1213
A hierarchy of factors influence discontinuous gas exchange in the grasshopper <i>Paracinema tricolor</i> (Orthoptera: Acrididae),"Groenewald, Berlize and Chown, Steven L. and Terblanche, John S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.102814,"The evolutionary origin and maintenance of discontinuous gas exchange (DGE) in tracheate arthropods are poorly understood and highly controversial. We investigated prioritization of abiotic factors in the gas exchange control cascade by examining oxygen, water and haemolymph pH regulation in the grasshopper Paracinema tricolor. Using a full-factorial design, grasshoppers were acclimated to hypoxic or hyperoxic (5\% O-2, 40\% O-2) gas conditions, or dehydrated or hydrated, whereafter their CO2 release was measured under a range of O-2 and relative humidity (RH) conditions (5\%, 21\%, 40\% O-2 and 5\%, 60\%, 90\% RH). DGE was significantly less common in grasshoppers acclimated to dehydrating conditions compared with the other acclimations (hypoxia, 98\%; hyperoxia, 100\%; hydrated, 100\%; dehydrated, 67\%). Acclimation to dehydrating conditions resulted in a significant decrease in haemolymph pH from 7.0 +/- 0.3 to 6.6 +/- 0.1 (mean +/- s.d., P = 0.018) and also significantly increased the open (O)-phase duration under 5\% O-2 treatment conditions (5\% O-2, 44.1 +/- 29.3 min; 40\% O-2, 15.8 +/- 8.0 min; 5\% RH, 17.8 +/- 1.3 min; 60\% RH, 24.0 +/- 9.7 min; 90\% RH, 20.6 +/- 8.9 min). The observed acidosis could potentially explain the extension of the O-phase under low RH conditions, when it would perhaps seem more useful to reduce the O-phase to lower respiratory water loss. The results confirm that DGE occurrence and modulation are affected by multiple abiotic factors. A hierarchical framework for abiotic factors influencing DGE is proposed in which the following stressors are prioritized in decreasing order of importance: oxygen supply, CO2 excretion and pH modulation, oxidative damage protection and water savings.",2014,217,19,3407-3415
"Handling heatwaves: balancing thermoregulation, foraging and bumblebee colony success","Bretzlaff, Tiffany and Kerr, Jeremy T. and Darveau, Charles-A",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coae006,"Climate changes pose risks for bumblebee populations, which have declined relative to the growing frequency and severity of warmer temperature extremes. Bumblebees might mitigate the effects of such extreme weather through colonial behaviours. In particular, fanning behaviour to dissipate heat is an important mechanism that could reduce exposure of thermally sensitive offspring to detrimental nest temperatures (Tn). The allocation of workers towards fanning over prolonged periods could impact foraging activity that is essential for colony-sustaining resource gathering. Colony maintenance and growth could suffer as a result of nutritional and high ambient temperature (Ta) thermal stress. It remains uncertain whether a compromise occurs between thermoregulation and foraging under chronic, sublethal heat events and how colony success is impacted as a result. This study held colonies of Bombus impatiens at constant high Ta (25 degrees C, 30 degrees C or 35 degrees C) for 2 weeks while quantifying the percentage of foragers, fanning incidence, nest temperature (Tn) and other metrics of colony success such as the percentage of adult emergence and offspring production. We found that foraging and adult emergence were not significantly affected by Ta, but that thermoregulation was unsuccessful at maintaining Tn despite increased fanning at 35 degrees C. Furthermore, 35 degrees C resulted in workers abandoning the colony and fewer offspring being produced. Our findings imply that heatwave events that exceed 30 degrees C can negatively impact colony success through failed thermoregulation and reduced workforce production.",2024,12,1,NA

Embryonic elasmobranchs respond to potential predators by displaying a freezing behaviour, characterized by the cessation of pharyngeal respiration followed immediately by coiling of the tail around the body. We hypothesized that the duration of this freeze response is limited by the embryo's requirement for oxygen. Here, Scyliorhinus canicula embryos were incubated at either 15 degrees C or 20 degrees C during embryogenesis and tested for the duration of, and metabolic consequence of, the freeze response at their respective incubation temperature. Freeze response duration was negatively impacted by routine metabolic rate; embryos at 20 degrees C had 7-fold shorter freeze duration than those at 15 degrees C, potentially increasing their susceptibility to predation. These data demonstrate the capacity for climate change stressors to affect animal behaviour and suggest that this may occur by eliciting changes in the organism's metabolism. We suggest altered predator avoidance behaviour is a new factor to consider when assessing the impact of climate change on the conservation and management of oviparous elasmobranch species.",2021,9,NA,1-7

It is thought that changes in Cl- and HCO3- gradients across neural membranes interfere with the function of GABA-gated anion channels (GABA(A) receptors). So far, such alterations have been revealed experimentally by exposing species living in low-CO2 environments, like many oceanic habitats, to high levels of CO2 (hypercapnia). To examine the generality of this phenomenon, we set out to study the opposite situation, hypothesizing that fishes living in typically hypercapnic environments also display behavioural alterations if exposed to low CO2 levels. This would indicate that ion regulation in the fish brain is fine-tuned to the prevailing CO2 conditions. We quantified pH regulatory variables and behavioural responses of Pangasianodon hypophthalmus, a fish native to the hypercapnic Mekong River, acclimated to high-CO2 (3.1 kPa) or low-CO2 (0.04 kPa) water. We found that brain and blood pH was actively regulated and that the low-CO2 fish displayed significantly higher activity levels, which were reduced after treatment with gabazine, a GABAA receptor blocker. This indicates an involvement of the GABAA receptor and altered Cl-and HCO3- ion gradients. Indeed, Goldman calculations suggest that low levels of environmental CO2 may cause significant changes in neural ion gradients in P. hypophthalmus. Taken together, the results suggest that brain ion regulation in fishes is fine-tuned to the prevailing ambient CO2 conditions and is prone to disruption if these conditions change.",2016,219,1,109-118
Effect of short-term regulated temperature variations on the swimming economy of Atlantic salmon smolts,"Alexandre, C. M. and Palstra, A. P.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/cox025,"Migratory species travelling long distances between habitats to spawn or feed are well adapted to optimize their swimming economy. However, human activities, such as river regulation, represent potential threats to fish migration by changing environmental parameters that will have impact on their metabolism. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the changes in the swimming energetics of a salmonid species, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.), caused by short-term temperature variations that usually result from the operation of hydroelectrical dams. Intermittent flow respirometry in swim tunnels allows to obtain high resolution data on oxygen consumption of swimming fish which can reflect aerobic and anaerobic metabolism. This method was used to compare the metabolic rates of oxygen consumption before, during and after sudden thermal change. Control (no temperature variation) and experimental (temperature variation of approximately 4 degrees C in 1 h) swimming trials were conducted to achieve the following objectives: (i) quantify the variations in oxygen consumption associated with abrupt temperature decrease, and (ii) assess if the tested fish return quickly to initial oxygen consumption rates. Main results revealed that Atlantic salmon smolts show a strong response to sudden temperature variation, significantly reducing the oxygen consumption rate up to a seven-fold change. Fish quickly returned to initial swimming costs shortly after reestablishment of temperature values. Results from this study can be used to evaluate the species-specific effects of the applied operation modes by hydroelectrical dams and to increase the success of conservation and management actions directed to fish species inhabiting regulated rivers.",2017,5,NA,NA
Cardiorespiratory collapse at high temperature in swimming adult sockeye salmon,"Eliason, Erika J. and Clark, Timothy D. and Hinch, Scott G. and Farrell, Anthony P.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/cot008,"Elevated summer river temperatures are associated with high in-river mortality in adult sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) during their once-in-a-lifetime spawning migration up the Fraser River (British Columbia, Canada). However, the mechanisms underlying the decrease in whole-animal performance and cardiorespiratory collapse above optimal temperatures for aerobic scope (T-opt) remain elusive for aquatic ectotherms. This is in part because all the relevant cardiorespiratory variables have rarely been measured directly and simultaneously during exercise at supra-optimal temperatures. Using the oxygen-and capacity-limited thermal tolerance hypothesis as a framework, this study simultaneously and directly measured oxygen consumption rate (MO2), cardiac output (V-b), heart rate (f(H)), and cardiac stroke volume (V-s), as well as arterial and venous blood oxygen status in adult sockeye salmon swimming at temperatures that bracketed T-opt to elucidate possible limitations in oxygen uptake into the blood or internal delivery through the oxygen cascade. Above T-opt, the decline in MO2max and aerobic scope was best explained by a cardiac limitation, triggered by reduced scope for f(H). The highest test temperatures were characterized by a negative scope for f(H), dramatic decreases in maximal V-b and maximal V-s, and cardiac dysrhythmias. In contrast, arterial blood oxygen content and partial pressure were almost insensitive to supra-optimal temperature, suggesting that oxygen delivery to and uptake by the gill were not a limiting factor. We propose that the high-temperature-induced en route mortality in migrating sockeye salmon may be at least partly attributed to physiological limitations in aerobic performance due to cardiac collapse via insufficient scope for f(H). Furthermore, this improved mechanistic understanding of cardiorespiratory collapse at high temperature is likely to have broader application to other salmonids and perhaps other aquatic ectotherms.",2013,1,1,NA
The old and the large may suffer disproportionately during episodes of high temperature: evidence from a keystone zooplankton species,"Burton, Tim and Einum, Sigurd",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coaa038,"Widespread declines in the body size of aquatic ectotherms have been attributed to the poorer ability of older, larger individuals to tolerate high temperature.

Across the gradient of exposure temperatures, younger, smaller individuals were more tolerant than older, larger individuals. This suggests that the young and the small may be better equipped to withstand temperature challenges that are both intense/brief and more moderate/prolonged. Our study generalizes results obtained from more acute tolerance assays, providing physiological evidence consistent with the observed reductions in ectotherm body size as a response to warming in aquatic systems.",2020,8,NA,NA

While the elasmobranch stress response has been well studied, the role of the unique corticosteroid-1 alpha-hydroxycorticosterone (1 alpha-OHB)-in energy balance is not understood. Therefore, 1 alpha-OHB's utility as a stress biomarker in elasmobranch conservation physiology is equivocal. Here, we analyse the roles of corticosteroids, 1 alpha-OHB and corticosterone, and metabolites, glucose and 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB), in response to stress in a protected tropical shark species, the blacktip reef shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus). Wild-caught neonates were exposed to ambient (27 degrees C) or heatwave conditions (29 degrees C) and subsequently a simulated fishing stressor (1 min air exposure). Blood samples were taken prior to temperature exposure, prior to air exposure, and 30 min, 1 h, 24 h, and 48 h post-air exposure at treatment temperatures. Plasma 1 alpha-OHB was elevated for 48 h in 27 degrees C-exposed sharks but declined over time in 29 degrees C-exposed sharks. Plasma 1 alpha-OHB was not correlated with either metabolite. Plasma glucose was higher and plasma 3-HB was lower in 29 degrees C-exposed sharks. In a separate experiment, blood samples were collected from both neonate and adult sharks immediately following capture and again 5 min later, and analysed for corticosteroids and metabolites. Plasma 1 alpha-OHB increased in neonates within 5 min, but neonates displayed lower plasma 1 alpha-OHB and higher glucose concentrations than adults. We conclude that 1 alpha-OHB does not serve as a classic glucocorticoid role in C. melanopterus under these stressors. Furthermore, we show for the first time, ontogenetic differences in plasma 1 alpha-OHB. Ultimately, our findings provide insights into hormonal control of energy mobilization during stress in C. melanopterus, particularly during simulated heatwave conditions, which seem to alter both endocrine and energy mobilization. Further work is needed to determine the utility of 1 alpha-OHB as a biomarker for the mobilization of energy during a stress event in elasmobranchs.",2021,9,NA,NA

These responses indicate that these two species have the potential to acclimate to temperature changes associated with climate change. The thermally dynamic nearshore Beaufort Sea, Alaska, is experiencing climate change-driven temperature increases. Measuring thermal tolerance of broad whitefish (Coregonus nasus) and saffron cod (Eleginus gracilis), both important species in the Arctic ecosystem, will enhance understanding of species-specific thermal tolerances. The objectives of this study were to determine the extent that acclimating broad whitefish and saffron cod to 5 degrees C and 15 degrees C changed their critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and HSP70 protein and mRNA expression in brain, muscle and liver tissues. After acclimation to 5 degrees C and 15 degrees C, the species were exposed to a thermal ramping rate of 3.4 degrees C center dot h-1 before quantifying the CTmax and HSP70 protein and transcript concentrations. Broad whitefish and saffron cod acclimated to 15 degrees C had a significantly higher mean CTmax (27.3 degrees C and 25.9 degrees C, respectively) than 5 degrees C-acclimated fish (23.7 degrees C and 23.2 degrees C, respectively), which is consistent with trends in CTmax between higher and lower acclimation temperatures. There were species-specific differences in thermal tolerance with 15 degrees C-acclimated broad whitefish having higher CTmax and HSP70 protein concentrations in liver and muscle tissues than saffron cod at both acclimation temperatures. Tissue-specific differences were quantified, with brain and muscle tissues having the highest and lowest HSP70 protein concentrations, respectively, for both species and acclimation temperatures. The differences in broad whitefish CTmax between the two acclimation temperatures could be explained with brain and liver tissues from 15 degrees C acclimation having higher HSP70a-201 and HSP70b-201 transcript concentrations than control fish that remained in lab-acclimation conditions of 8 degrees C. The shift in CTmax and HSP70 protein and paralogous transcripts demonstrate the physiological plasticity that both species possess in responding to two different acclimation temperatures. This response is imperative to understand as aquatic temperatures continue to elevate.",2024,12,1,NA

For effective conservation management, we need to fully understand the consequences of hypoxia on marine key species such as elasmobranchs. Because of their benthic life style, we hypothesized that S. suckleyi are hypoxia tolerant and able to efficiently regulate oxygen consumption, and that anaerobic metabolism is supported by a broad range of metabolites including ketones, fatty acids and amino acids. Therefore, we studied oxygen consumption rates, ventilation frequency and amplitude, blood gasses, acid-base regulation, and changes in plasma and tissue metabolites during progressive hypoxia. Our results show that critical oxygen levels (P-crit) where oxyregulation is lost were indeed low (18.1\% air saturation or 28.5 Torr at 13 degrees C). However, many dogfish behaved as oxyconformers rather than oxyregulators. Arterial blood PO2 levels mostly decreased linearly with decreasing environmental PO2. Blood gases and acid-base status were dependent on open versus closed respirometry but in both set-ups ventilation frequency increased. Hypoxia below P-crit resulted in an up-regulation of anaerobic glycolysis, as evidenced by increased lactate levels in all tissues except brain. Elasmobranchs typically rely on ketone bodies as oxidative substrates, and decreased concentrations of acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate were observed in white muscle of hypoxic and/or recovering fish. Furthermore, reductions in isoleucine, glutamate, glutamine and other amino acids were observed. After 6 hours of normoxic recovery, changes persisted and only lactate returned to normal in most tissues. This emphasizes the importance of using suitable bioindicators adjusted to preferred metabolic pathways of the target species in conservation physiology. We conclude that Pacific spiny dogfish can tolerate severe transient hypoxic events, but recovery is slow and negative impacts can be expected when hypoxia persists.",2024,12,1,NA

Marine bivalves such as the hard-shell clam, Mercenaria mercenaria, serve as ecosystem engineers in estuaries and coastal zones of the western Atlantic and, as for many marine calcifiers, are sensitive to the impacts of ocean acidification. In estuaries, the effects of ocean acidification can be exacerbated by low buffering capacity of brackish waters, acidic inputs from freshwaters and land, and/or the negative effects of salinity on the physiology of organisms. We determined the interactive effects of 21 weeks of exposure to different levels of CO2 (similar to 395, 800 and 1500 mu atm corresponding to pH of 8.2, 8.1 and 7.7, respectively) and salinity (32 versus 16) on biomineralization, shell properties and energy metabolism of juvenile hard-shell clams. Low salinity had profound effects on survival, energy metabolism and biomineralization of hard-shell clams and modulated their responses to elevated P-CO2. Negative effects of low salinity in juvenile clams were mostly due to the strongly elevated basal energy demand, indicating energy deficiency, that led to reduced growth, elevated mortality and impaired shell maintenance (evidenced by the extensive damage to the periostracum). The effects of elevated P-CO2 on physiology and biomineralization of hard-shell clams were more complex. Elevated P-CO2 (similar to 800-1500 mu atm) had no significant effects on standard metabolic rates (indicative of the basal energy demand), but affected growth and shell mechanical properties in juvenile clams. Moderate hypercapnia (similar to 800 mu atm P-CO2) increased shell and tissue growth and reduced mortality of juvenile clams in high salinity exposures; however, these effects were abolished under the low salinity conditions or at high P-CO2 (similar to 1500 mu atm). Mechanical properties of the shell (measured as microhardness and fracture toughness of the shells) were negatively affected by elevated CO2 alone or in combination with low salinity, which may have important implications for protection against predators or environmental stressors. Our data indicate that environmental salinity can strongly modulate responses to ocean acidification in hard-shell clams and thus should be taken into account when predicting the effects of ocean acidification on estuarine bivalves.",2013,216,14,2607-2618

Dark respiration was enhanced by increased flow and increased oxygen saturation in an interactive way, which relates to improved oxygen influx into the coral tissue. Oxygen saturation did not influence net photosynthesis: neither hypoxia nor hyperoxia affected net photosynthesis, irrespective of flow and pH, which suggests that hyperoxia does not induce high rates of photorespiration in this coral. Flow and pH had a synergistic effect on net photosynthesis: at high flow, a decrease in pH stimulated net photosynthesis by 14\%. These results indicate that for this individual of G. fascicularis, increased uptake of carbon dioxide rather than increased efflux of oxygen explains the beneficial effect of water flow on photosynthesis.

Temperature alters the physiological response of spiny lobsters under predation risk,"Briceno, Felipe A. and Fitzgibbon, Quinn P. and Polymeropoulos, Elias T. and Hinojosa, Ivan A. and Pecl, Gretta T.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coaa065,"Predation risk can strongly shape prey ecological traits, with specific anti-predator responses displayed to reduce encounters with predators. Key environmental drivers, such as temperature, can profoundly modulate prey energetic costs in ectotherms, although we currently lack knowledge of how both temperature and predation risk can challenge prey physiology and ecology. Such uncertainties in predator-prey interactions are particularly relevant for marine regions experiencing rapid environmental changes due to climate change. Using the octopus (Octopus maorum)-spiny lobster (Jasus edwardsii) interaction as a predator-prey model, we examined different metabolic traits of sub adult spiny lobsters under predation risk in combination with two thermal scenarios: `current' (20 degrees C) and `warming' (23 degrees C), based on projections of sea-surface temperature under climate change. We examined lobster standard metabolic rates to define the energetic requirements at specific temperatures. Routine metabolic rates (RMRs) within a respirometer were used as a proxy of lobster activity during night and day time, and active metabolic rates, aerobic scope and excess post-exercise oxygen consumption were used to assess the energetic costs associated with escape responses (i.e. tail-flipping) in both thermal scenarios. Lobster standard metabolic rate increased at 23 degrees C, suggesting an elevated energetic requirement (39\%) compared to 20 degrees C. Unthreatened lobsters displayed a strong circadian pattern in RMR with higher rates during the night compared with the day, which were strongly magnified at 23 degrees C. Once exposed to predation risk, lobsters at 20 degrees C quickly reduced their RMR by similar to 29\%, suggesting an immobility or `freezing' response to avoid predators. Conversely, lobsters acclimated to 23 degrees C did not display such an anti-predator response. These findings suggest that warmer temperatures may induce a change to the typical immobility predation risk response of lobsters. It is hypothesized that heightened energetic maintenance requirements at higher temperatures may act to override the normal predator-risk responses under climate-change scenarios.",2020,8,NA,NA

Additionally, the oxygen-limited thermal tolerance hypothesis predicts that reduced aerobic scope sets thermal limits for ectotherm performance. Metabolic plasticity, locomotor performance and aerobic scope are therefore predicted targets of natural selection as cane toads invade colder regions. We measured these traits at temperatures of 10, 15, 22.5 and 30 degrees C in low- and high-latitude toads acclimated to 15 and 30 degrees C, to test the hypothesis that cane toads have adapted to cooler temperatures. High-latitude toads show increased metabolic plasticity and higher resting metabolic rates at lower temperatures. Burst locomotor performance was worse for high-latitude toads. Other traits showed no regional differences. We conclude that increased metabolic plasticity may facilitate invasion into higher latitudes by maintaining critical physiological functions at lower temperatures.",2015,3,NA,NA

Survival of members of the dominant suborder of Antarctic fishes, the Notothenioidei, will likely require thermal plasticity and adaptive capacity in key traits delimiting thermal tolerance. Herein, we have assessed the thermal plasticity of several cellular and biochemical pathways, many of which are known to be associated with thermal tolerance in notothenioids, including mitochondrial function, activities of aerobic and anaerobic enzymes, antioxidant defences, protein ubiquitination and degradation in cardiac, oxidative skeletal muscles and gill of Notothenia coriiceps warm acclimated to 4 degrees C for 22 days or 5 degrees C for 42 days. Levels of triacylglycerol (TAG) were measured in liver and oxidative and glycolytic skeletal muscles, and glycogen in liver and glycolytic muscle to assess changes in energy stores. Metabolic pathways displayed minimal thermal plasticity, yet antioxidant defences were lower in heart and oxidative skeletal muscles of warm-acclimated animals compared with animals held at ambient temperature. Despite higher metabolic rates at elevated temperature, energy storage depots of TAG and glycogen increase in liver and remain unchanged in muscle with warm acclimation. Overall, our studies reveal that N. coriiceps displays thermal plasticity in some key traits that may contribute to their survival as the Southern Ocean continues to warm.",2022,10,1,NA
Diminished warming tolerance and plasticity in low-latitude populations of a marine gastropod,"Villeneuve, Andrew R. and Komoroske, Lisa M. and Cheng, Brian S.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coab039,"Models of species response to climate change often assume that physiological traits are invariant across populations. Neglecting potential intraspecific variation may overlook the possibility that some populations are more resilient or susceptible than others, creating inaccurate predictions of climate impacts. In addition, phenotypic plasticity can contribute to trait variation and may mediate sensitivity to climate. Quantifying such forms of intraspecific variation can improve our understanding of how climate can affect ecologically important species, such as invasive predators. Here, we quantified thermal performance (tolerance, acclimation capacity, developmental traits) across seven populations of the predatory marine snail (Urosalpinx cinerea) from native Atlantic and non-native Pacific coast populations in the USA. Using common garden experiments, we assessed the effects of source population and developmental acclimation on thermal tolerance and developmental traits of F1 snails. We then estimated climate sensitivity by calculating warming tolerance (thermal tolerance- habitat temperature), using field environmental data. We report that low-latitude populations had greater thermal tolerance than their high latitude counterparts. However, these same low-latitude populations exhibited decreased thermal tolerance when exposed to environmentally realistic higher acclimation temperatures. Low-latitude native populations had the greatest climate sensitivity (habitat temperatures near thermal limits). In contrast, invasive Pacific snails had the lowest climate sensitivity, suggesting that these populations are likely to persist and drive negative impacts on native biodiversity. Developmental rate significantly increased in embryos sourced from populations with greater habitat temperature but had variable effects on clutch size and hatching success. Thus, warming can produce widely divergent responses within the same species, resulting in enhanced impacts in the non-native range and extirpation in the native range. Broadly, our results highlight how intraspecific variation can alter management decisions, as this may clarify whether management efforts should be focused on many or only a few populations.",2021,9,NA,NA
The effects of cold shock on freshwater fish larvae and early-stage juveniles: implications for river management,"Michie, Laura E. and Thiem, Jason D. and Boys, Craig A. and Mitrovic, Simon M.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coaa092,"Temperature is essential to the maintenance of optimal physiological functioning in aquatic organisms. Fish can manage natural fluctuations in temperature; however, in freshwater ecosystems acute and rapid temperature changes can originate from sources such as large dams and industrial effluents. These rapid temperature changes may induce several physiological and behavioural responses that can result in lethal and sub-lethal consequences. The present study assessed immediate sublethal and short-term (10 days) lethal responses of three species of Australian freshwater fish larvae and early-stage juveniles to a range of different `field-relevant' cold shocks (-4, -6, -8 and -10 degrees C). Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii), silver perch (Bidyanus bidyanus) andgolden perch (Macquariaambigua) were tested at two age groups to elucidate the interaction between ontogeny and sensitivity to cold shock. Cold shock caused mortality and reductions in swimming ability (time to exhaustion and lines crossed) in all species of fish at both age groups. Sensitivity was correlated to the magnitude of cold shock; a 10 degrees C drop in temperature caused the highest mortalities. Ontogeny interacted with the severity of cold shock; the younger fish experienced higher mortalities and greater impairment to swimming ability. This study demonstrates the potential lethal and sub-lethal impacts of cold shock on freshwater fish at a critical life-history stage. Understanding the impacts of cold shock will aid management of freshwater ecosystems for the benefit of fish populations, with the current study identifying critical life stages to be considered in remediation and guiding thresholds necessary to reduce the impact of cold shock on native fish populations.",2020,8,NA,NA

To test how water pH affects capacities and strategies for pH compensation, we exposed the CO2-tolerant fish Pangasianodon hypophthalmus to 3 kPa P-CO2 for 20 h at an ecologically relevant water pH of 4.5 or 5.8. Brain, heart and liver pH(i) was preferentially regulated in both treatments. However, blood pH(e) compensation was severely reduced at water pH 4.5 but not 5.8. This suggests that low water pH limits acute pH(e) but not pH(i) compensation in fishes preferentially regulating pH(i) Hypercarbia-induced reductions in water pH might therefore underlie the unexplained reductions to pH(e) compensation in fishes preferentially regulating pH(i), and may increase selection for preferential pH(i) regulation.",2018,221,23,NA

Colonial organisms might be particularly resilient to environmental stressors, as organizational modularity and successive asexual generations can allow for distinctively flexible responses in the aggregate form. We performed laboratory experiments to examine the effects of increasing dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) (i.e. ocean acidification) on the colonial bryozoan Celleporella cornuta sampled from two source populations within a coastal upwelling region of the northern California coast. Bryozoan colonies were remarkably plastic under these CO2 treatments. Colonies raised under high CO2 grew more quickly, investing less in reproduction and producing lighter skeletons when compared with genetically identical clones raised under current surface atmosphere CO2 values. Bryozoans held under high CO2 conditions also changed the Mg/Ca ratio of skeletal calcite and increased the expression of organic coverings in new growth, which may serve as protection against acidified water. We also observed strong differences between source populations in reproductive investment and organic covering reaction norms, consistent with adaptive responses to persistent spatial variation in local oceanographic conditions. Our results demonstrate that phenotypic plasticity and energetic tradeoffs can mediate biological responses to global environmental change, and highlight the broad range of strategies available to colonial organisms.",2017,220,23,4399-4409
Does hydrostatic pressure influence lumpfish (<i>Cyclopterus lumpus</i>) heart rate and its response to environmental challenges?,"Zrini, Zoe A. and Sandrelli, Rebeccah M. and Gamperl, A. Kurt",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coab058,"Studies on the effects of environmental changes with increasing depth (e.g. temperature and oxygen level) on fish physiology rarely consider how hydrostatic pressure might influence the observed responses. In this study, lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus, 200-400 g), which can exhibit vertical migrations of over 100 m daily and can be found at depths of 500 m or more, were implanted with Star-Oddi micro-HRT loggers. Then, their heart rate (f(H)) was measured in a pressure chamber when exposed to the following: (i) increasing pressure (up to 80 bar; 800min depth) at 10 degrees C or (ii) increasing temperature (12-20 degrees C), decreasing temperature (12 to 4 degrees C) or decreasing oxygen levels (101-55\% air saturation at 12 degrees C) in the absence or presence of 80 bar of pressure. Additionally, we determined their f(H) response to chasing and to increasing temperature (to 22 degrees C) at atmospheric pressure. Pressure-induced increases in f(H) (e.g. from48 to 61 bpm at 12 degrees C) were associated with hyperactivity. The magnitude of the rise in f(H) with temperature was greater in pressure-exposed vs. control fish (i.e. by similar to 30 bpm vs. 45 bpm between 5 degrees C and 20 degrees C). However, the relative increase (i.e. slope of the relationship) was not different between groups. In contrast, 80 bar of pressure eliminated the small (5 bpm) increase in f(H) when control fish were exposed to hypoxia. Exhaustive exercise and increasing temperature to 22 degrees C resulted in a maximum f(H) of 77 and 81 bpm, respectively. Our research shows that pressure influences the fH response to environmental challenges and provides the first evidence that lumpfish have a limited capacity to increase f(H).",2021,9,NA,NA

Previously, four hypercarbiatolerant fishes had been shown to completely and rapidly regulate heart, brain, liver and white muscle pH(i) during acute exposure to >4 kPa P-CO2 (preferential pH(i) regulation) before pH(e) compensation was observed. Here, we test the hypothesis that preferential pH(i) regulation is a widespread strategy of acid-base regulation among fish by measuring pH(i) regulation in 10 different fish species that are broadly phylogenetically separated, spanning six orders, eight families and 10 genera. Contrary to previous views, we show that preferential pH(i) regulation is the most common strategy for acid-base regulation within these fishes during exposure to severe acute hypercarbia and that this strategy is associated with increased hypercarbia tolerance. This suggests that preferential pH(i) regulation may confer tolerance to the respiratory acidosis associated with hypercarbia, and we propose that it is an exaptation that facilitated key evolutionary transitions in vertebrate evolution, such as the evolution of air breathing.",2020,223,7,NA
Regional thermal variation in a coral reef fish,"Schmidt, Elliott and Donelson, Jennifer M.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coae058,"This study investigated the thermal performance of several traits from damselfish populations in two different regions on the Great Barrier Reef (low- and high-latitude). Oxygen consumption rates and aerobic enzyme activity at elevated temperatures were found to differ between the regions, while immunocompetence, haematocrit, and anaerobic enzyme activity were similar. How species respond to climate change will depend on the collective response of populations. Intraspecific variation in traits, evolved through genetic adaptation and phenotypic plasticity, can cause thermal performance curves to vary over species' distributions. Intraspecific variation within marine species has received relatively little attention due to the belief that marine systems lack dispersal barriers strong enough to promote locally adapted traits. Here we show that intraspecific variation is present between low- and high-latitude populations of a coral reef damselfish (Acanthochromis polyacanthus). Co-gradient variation was observed when examining aerobic physiology across a thermal gradient that reflected mean summer temperatures of high- and low-latitude regions, as well as projected future ocean temperatures (i.e. 27, 28.5, 30, 31.5 degrees C). Whilst thermally sensitive, no significant differences were observed between high- and low-latitude regions when measuring immunocompetence, haematocrit and anaerobic enzyme activity. The presence of co-gradient variation suggests that dispersal limitations in marine systems can promote local adaptive responses; however, intraspecific variation may not be ubiquitous amongst traits. Identifying locally adapted traits amongst populations remains necessary to accurately project species responses to climate change and identify differences in adaptive potential.",2024,12,1,NA
Effect of food availability on the growth and thermal physiology of juvenile Dungeness crabs (<i>Metacarcinus</i> <i>magister</i>),"McLean, Katherine M. and Todgham, Anne E.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/cov013,"Juvenile Dungeness crabs spend similar to 1 year in the San Francisco Estuary, where they undergo considerable growth before returning to the coastal ocean. Previous studies suggest that competition, food scarcity and avoidance of conspecifics may cause some juvenile Dungeness crabs in the San Francisco Estuary to become food limited. Food limitation may force these crabs to forage in higher temperature intertidal environments in the estuary, exposing them to stressful conditions in order to sustain growth and, potentially, necessitating physiological trade-offs in energy allocation between growth and stress tolerance. To investigate the effects of food limitation on aerobic metabolism and physiological performance of crabs, we assessed growth, moulting frequency, metabolic rate, citrate synthase and malate dehydrogenase enzyme activity and cardiac performance, as an index of temperature sensitivity and upper temperature tolerance. Summer- and winter-caught crabs were acclimated to either a high- or a low-food ration for 5 weeks. Overall, our results demonstrated that while food limitation had a negative effect on growth of juvenile Dungeness crabs in both the summer and the winter feeding trials, crabs in the low-food group maintained both metabolic rate at ambient San Francisco Estuary temperatures (15 degrees C; summer trial only) and upper temperature tolerance as determined by failure of cardiac function when compared with crabs in the high- food group (summer and winter trials). Therefore, the ability to maintain stress tolerance when food is limited appears to come as a physiological trade-off to growth. Food-limited crabs were unable to increase their metabolic rate to the same level as that achieved by well-fed crabs; therefore, if exposure to elevated temperatures persists and requires more energy than can be met by crabs in their food-limited state, physiological performance may be compromised.",2015,3,NA,NA
Bisphenols alter thermal responses and performance in zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>),"Wu, Nicholas C. and Seebacher, Frank",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coaa138,"Plastic pollutants are novel environmental stressors that are now persistent components of natural ecosystems. Endocrine disrupting chemicals such as bisphenols that leach out of plastics can modify physiological responses of animals by interfering with hormone signalling. Here, we tested whether three commonly produced bisphenols, bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol F (BPF) and bisphenol S (BPS), impair thermal acclimation of swimming performance and metabolic enzyme [}citrate synthase (CS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)] activities in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). We found that exposure to 30-mu gl(-1) BPF and BPS, but not BPA, reduced swimming performance, and no interactions between bisphenol exposure and acclimation (3 weeks to 18 degrees C and 28 degrees C) or acute test (18 degrees C and 28 degrees C) temperatures were found. BPA interacted with acclimation and acute test temperatures to determine CS activity, an indicator of mitochondria! density and aerobic metabolic capacity. BPS reduced CS activity and an interaction (at a one-tailed significance) between acclimation temperature and BPF exposure determined CS activity. LDH activity reflects anaerobic ATP production capacity, and BPA and BPF altered the effects of thermal acclimation and acute test temperatures on LDH activity. Our data show that all bisphenols we tested at ecologically relevant concentrations can disrupt the thermal responses of fish. BPS and BPF are used as environmentally safer alternatives to BPA, but our data show that these bisphenols are also of concern, particularly in thermally variable environments.",2021,9,NA,NA
Effects of incubation temperature on the upper thermal tolerance of the imperiled longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys),"Yanagitsuru, Yuzo R. and Mauduit, Florian and Lundquist, Alexis J. and Lewis, Levi S. and Hobbs, James A. and Hung, Tien-Chieh and Connon, Richard E. and Fangue, Nann A.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coae004,"Using a common cardiac thermal performance assay, we identified temperature ranges that define the thermal optima and upper thermal limits of the larval life stage of the imperiled longfin smelt larvae. We demonstrated the utility of a cardiac assay for defining appropriate thermal conditions for a species of conservation concern. Upper thermal limits in many fish species are limited, in part, by the heart's ability to meet increased oxygen demand during high temperatures. Cardiac plasticity induced by developmental temperatures can therefore influence thermal tolerance. Here, we determined how incubation temperatures during the embryonic stage influence cardiac performance across temperatures during the sensitive larval stage of the imperiled longfin smelt. We transposed a cardiac assay for larger fish to newly hatched larvae that were incubated at 9 degrees C, 12 degrees C or 15 degrees C. We measured heart rate over increases in temperature to identify the Arrhenius breakpoint temperature (TAB), a proxy for thermal optimum and two upper thermal limit metrics: temperature when heart rate is maximized (Tpeak) and when cardiac arrhythmia occurs (TArr). Higher incubation temperatures increased TAB, Tpeak and TArr, but high individual variation in all three metrics resulted in great overlap of individuals at TAB, Tpeak and TArr across temperatures. We found that the temperatures at which 10\% of individuals reached Tpeak or TArr and temperatures at which number of individuals at TAB relative to Tpeak (Delta N(TAB,Tpeak)) was maximal, correlated more closely with upper thermal limits and thermal optima inferred from previous studies, compared to the mean values of the three cardiac metrics of the present study. Higher incubation temperatures increased the 10\% Tpeak and TArr thresholds but maximum Delta N(TAB,Tpeak) largely remained the same, suggesting that incubation temperatures modulate upper thermal limits but not Topt for a group of larvae. Overall, by measuring cardiac performance across temperatures, we defined upper thermal limits (10\% thresholds; Tpeak, 14.4-17.5 degrees C; TArr, 16.9-20.2 degrees C) and optima (Delta N(TAB,Tpeak), 12.4-14.4 degrees C) that can guide conservation strategies for longfin smelt and demonstrated the potential of this cardiac assay for informing conservation plans for the early life stages of fish.",2024,12,1,NA
"Resilience and phenotypic plasticity of Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) facing cyclic hypoxia: insights into growth, energy stores and hepatic metabolism","Ducros, Loick and Touaibia, Mohamed and Pichaud, Nicolas and Lamarre, Simon G.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coad099,"Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) is facing the decline of its southernmost populations due to several factors including rising temperatures and eutrophication. These conditions are also conducive to episodes of cyclic hypoxia, another possible threat to this species. In fact, lack of oxygen and reoxygenation can both have serious consequences on fish as a result of altered ATP balance and an elevated risk of oxidative burst. Thus, fish must adjust their phenotype to survive and equilibrate their energetic budget. However, their energy allocation strategy could imply a reduction in growth which could be deleterious for their fitness. Although the impact of cyclic hypoxia is a major issue for ecosystems and fisheries worldwide, our knowledge on how salmonid deal with high oxygen fluctuations remains limited. Our objective was to characterize the effects of cyclic hypoxia on growth and metabolism in Arctic char. We monitored growth parameters (specific growth rate, condition factor), hepatosomatic and visceral indexes, relative heart mass and hematocrit of Arctic char exposed to 30 days of cyclic hypoxia. We also measured the hepatic protein synthesis rate, hepatic triglycerides as well as muscle glucose, glycogen and lactate and quantified hepatic metabolites during this treatment. The first days of cyclic hypoxia slightly reduce growth performance with a downward trend in specific growth rate in mass and condition factor variation compared to the control group. This acute exposure also induced a profound metabolome reorganization in the liver with an alteration of amino acid, carbohydrate and lipid metabolisms. However, fish rebalanced their metabolic activities and successfully maintained their growth and energetic reserves after 1 month of cyclic hypoxia. These results demonstrate the impressive ability of Arctic char to cope with its changing environment but also highlight a certain vulnerability of this species during the first days of a cyclic hypoxia event.",2023,11,1,NA

Prolonged exposure to low oxygen improves hypoxia tolerance in a freshwater fish,"Gilmore, Kayla L. and Doubleday, Zoe A. and Gillanders, Bronwyn M.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coz058,"Persistent hypoxic or low-oxygen conditions in aquatic systems are becoming more frequent worldwide, causing large-scale mortalities to aquatic fauna. It is poorly understood, however, whether species can acclimate to long-term hypoxic conditions. In two experiments, we exposed juvenile freshwater fish (Murray cod, Maccullochella peelii) to low-oxygen conditions and investigated acclimation effects. Experiment 1 determined how responses could be modified by exposure to different temperatures (20, 24 and 28 degrees C) and oxygen conditions (control 6-8 mgO(2) L-1 and low-oxygen 3-4 mgO(2) L-1) over 30 days. Experiment 2 determined the acclimation ability of fish exposed to two temperatures (20 and 28 degrees C) and low-oxygen conditions (3-4 mgO(2) L-1) for three different acclimation periods (7, 14 and 30 days). Responses were measured by determining critical oxygen tension (P-crit), loss of equilibrium and aerobic capacity using resting respirometry. In experiment 1, resting oxygen requirements were negatively affected by long-term low-oxygen exposure except at the highest temperature (28 degrees C). However, long-term acclimation in low-oxygen improved tolerance as measured by loss of equilibrium but not Pcrit. In experiment 2, fish could tolerate lower oxygen levels before reaching loss of equilibrium after 7 days acclimation, but this declined overtime. Murray cod were most tolerant to low-oxygen at the lowest temperature (20 degrees C) and shortest exposure time (7 days). Extended low-oxygen exposure resulted in reduced aerobic capacity of fish particularly at the lowest temperature. While prior exposure to low-oxygen may allow fish to cope with hypoxic conditions better in the long-term, acclimation time was inversely related to tolerance, suggesting that resistance to hypoxia might decrease as a function of exposure time. Our study fills a much-needed gap in our understanding of how freshwater species acclimate to hypoxia, and in particular, how exposure to prolonged periods of low-oxygen and elevated temperatures affect organisms physiologically.",2019,7,NA,NA

At 13 degrees C, H. gammarus juveniles were able to fully compensate for acid-base disturbances caused by the exposure to elevated seawater P-CO2 at levels associated with ocean acidification and carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) leakage scenarios, via haemolymph {[}HCO3-] regulation. However, metabolic rate remained constant and food consumption decreased under elevated P-CO2, indicating reduced energy availability. Juveniles at 17 degrees C showed no ability to actively compensate haemolymph pH, resulting in decreased haemolymph pH particularly under CCS conditions. Early benthic juvenile lobsters at 17 degrees C were not able to increase energy intake to offset increased energy demand and therefore appear to be unable to respond to acid-base disturbances due to increased P-CO2 at elevated temperature. Analysis of haemolymph metabolites suggests that, even under control conditions, juveniles were energetically limited. They exhibited high haemolymph {[}L-lactate], indicating recourse to anaerobic metabolism.

To date, few studies have assessed the physiological impacts of OA on early life-history stages of intertidal organisms, which transition from habitats with fluctuating pH (intertidal zone) to relatively stable (pelagic zone) pH environments. We used the intertidal crab Petrolisthes cinctipes to determine whether metabolic responses to year 2300 predictions for OA vary among early developmental stages and to examine whether the effects were more pronounced in larval stages developing in the open ocean. Oxygen consumption rate, total protein, dry mass, total lipids and C/N were determined in late-stage embryos, zoea I larvae and newly settled juveniles reared in ambient pH (7.93 +/- 0.06) or low pH (7.58 +/- 0.06). After short-term exposure to low pH, embryos displayed 11\% and 6\% lower metabolism and dry mass, respectively, which may have an associated bioenergetic cost of delayed development to hatching. However, metabolic responses appeared to vary among broods, suggesting significant parental effects among the offspring of six females, possibly a consequence of maternal state during egg deposition and genetic differences among broods. Larval and juvenile metabolism were not affected by acute exposure to elevated CO2. Larvae contained 7\% less nitrogen and C/N was 6\% higher in individuals reared at pH. 7.58 for 6 days, representing a possible switch from lipid to protein metabolism under low pH; the metabolic switch appears to fully cover the energetic cost of responding to elevated CO2. Juvenile dry mass was unaffected after 33 days exposure to low pH seawater. Increased tolerance to low pH in zoea I larvae and juvenile stages may be a consequence of enhanced acid-base regulatory mechanisms, allowing greater compensation of extracellular pH changes and thus preventing decreases in metabolism after exposure to elevated P-CO2. The observed variation in responses of P. cinctipes to decreased pH in the present study suggests the potential for this species to adapt to future declines in near-shore pH.",2013,216,8,1412-1422

Multistressor experiments are critically needed to better understand the sensitivity of marine organisms to these concurrent changes. Growth and survival responses to acidification have been documented for many marine species, but studies that explore underlying physiological mechanisms of carbon dioxide (CO2) sensitivity are less common. We investigated oxygen consumption rates as proxies for metabolic responses in embryos and newly hatched larvae of an estuarine forage fish (Atlantic silverside, Menidia menidia) to factorial combinations of CO(2)xtemperature or CO(2)xoxygen. Metabolic rates of embryos and larvae significantly increased with temperature, but partial pressure of CO2 (P-CO2) alone did not affect metabolic rates in any experiment. However, there was a significant interaction between Poo, and partial pressure of oxygen (P-O2) in embryos, because metabolic rates were unaffected by P-O2 level at ambient P-CO2, but decreased with declining P-O2 under elevated P-CO2. For larvae, however, P-CO2 and P-O2 had no significant effect on metabolic rates. Our findings suggest high individual variability in metabolic responses to high P-CO2, perhaps owing to parental effects and time of spawning. We conclude that early life metabolism is largely resilient to elevated P-CO2, in this species, but that acidification likely influences energetic responses and thus vulnerability to hypoxia.",2020,223,22,NA

To assess the potential impact of reduced body temperatures on assimilation rates of C. collaris in encroached glades, we conducted feeding trials across four temperature treatments (28, 31, 34 and 37 degrees C). We tested for temperature effects on voluntary feeding rates, passage times, apparent assimilated energy (AE) and metabolizable energy (ME). Passage times decreased and voluntary feeding rates increased significantly with increasing temperature. Consumption explained the majority of variance in AE and ME, followed by the effect of temperature treatments. Using data on voluntary feeding rates, passage times and ME as a function of temperature, we estimated over a 10-fold increase in predicted daily assimilated energy across temperature treatments (28 degrees C = 0.58 kJ/day, 31 degrees C = 1.20 kJ/day, 34 degrees C = 4.30 kJ/day, 37 degrees C = 7.95 kJ/day). Thus, lower heat loads in encroached glades may cause reduced body temperature and result in restricted energy assimilation rates. Our study provides a novel approach to the integration of bioenergetics and conservation and shows the efficacy of using information on digestive performance to investigate underlying mechanisms in a conservation context.",2020,8,NA,NA
Interactive effects of seawater acidification and elevated temperature on biomineralization and amino acid metabolism in the mussel <i>Mytilus edulis</i>,"Li, Shiguo and Liu, Chuang and Huang, Jingliang and Liu, Yangjia and Zheng, Guilan and Xie, Liping and Zhang, Rongqing",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.126748,"Seawater acidification and warming resulting from anthropogenic production of carbon dioxide are increasing threats to marine ecosystems. Previous studies have documented the effects of either seawater acidification or warming on marine calcifiers; however, the combined effects of these stressors are poorly understood. In our study, we examined the interactive effects of elevated carbon dioxide partial pressure (P-CO2) and temperature on biomineralization and amino acid content in an ecologically and economically important mussel, Mytilus edulis. Adult M. edulis were reared at different combinations of P-CO2 (pH 8.1 and 7.8) and temperature (19, 22 and 25 degrees C) for 2 months. The results indicated that elevated P-CO2 significantly decreased the net calcification rate, the calcium content and the Ca/Mg ratio of the shells, induced the differential expression of biomineralization-related genes, modified shell ultrastructure and altered amino acid content, implying significant effects of seawater acidification on biomineralization and amino acid metabolism. Notably, elevated temperature enhanced the effects of seawater acidification on these parameters. The shell breaking force significantly decreased under elevated P-CO2, but the effect was not exacerbated by elevated temperature. The results suggest that the interactive effects of seawater acidification and elevated temperature on mussels are likely to have ecological and functional implications. This study is therefore helpful for better understanding the underlying effects of changing marine environments on mussels and other marine calcifiers.",2015,218,22,3623-3631
Acid base regulation in the air-breathing swamp eel (<i>Monopterus</i> <i>albus</i>) at different temperatures,"Phan Vinh Thinh and Nguyen Thanh Phuong and Brauner, Colin J. and Do Thi Thanh Huong and Wood, Andrew T. and Kwan, Garfield T. and Conner, Justin L. and Bayley, Mark and Wang, Tobias",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.172551,"Vertebrates reduce arterial blood pH (pHa) when body temperature increases. In water breathers, this response occurs primarily by reducing plasma HCO3- levels with small changes in the partial pressure of CO2 (P-CO2). In contrast, air breathers mediate the decrease in pHa by increasing arterial P-CO2 (Pa-CO2) at constant plasma HCO3- by reducing lung ventilation relative to metabolic CO2 production. Much less is known about bimodal breathers, which utilize both water and air. Here, we characterized the influence of temperature on arterial acid-base balance and intracellular pH (pH(i)) in the bimodal-breathing swamp eel, Monopterus albus. This teleost uses the buccopharyngeal cavity for gas exchange and has very reduced gills. When exposed to ecologically relevant temperatures (20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C) for 24 and 48 h, pHa decreased by -0.025 pH units (U) degrees C-1 in association with an increase in Pa-CO2 but without changes in plasma [}HCO3-]. pH(i) was also reduced with increased temperature. The slope of pH, of liver and muscle was -0.014 and -0.019 U degrees C-1, while the heart muscle showed a smaller reduction (-0.008 U degrees C-1). When exposed to hypercapnia (7 or 14 mmHg) at either 25 or 35 degrees C, M. albus elevated plasma {[}HCO3-] and therefore seemed to defend the new pHa set-point, demonstrating an adjusted control of acid-base balance with temperature. Overall, the effects of temperature on acid-base balance in M. albus resemble those in air-breathing amniotes, and we discuss the possibility that this pattern of acid-base balance results from a progressive transition in CO2 excretion from water to air as temperature rises.",2018,221,10,NA

Contrary to previous studies, we show that this air-breathing fish has a pronounced ability to regulate extracellular pH (pH(e)) during hypercapnia, with completemetabolic compensation of pH(e) within 72 h of exposure to hypoxic hypercapnia with CO2 levels above 34 mmHg.

"Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) age at maturity is strongly affected by temperature, population and age-at-maturity genotype","asheim, Eirik R. and Debes, V, Paul and House, Andrew and Liljestrom, Petra and Niemela, Petri T. and Siren, Jukka P. and Erkinaro, Jaakko and Primmer, Craig R.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coac086,"Age at maturity can vary dramatically within some species. We show that, when raised in controlled conditions, Atlantic salmon age at maturity is affected greatly by temperature as well as a recently discovered age-at-maturity gene. The influence of temperature on age at maturity differed between two populations, but the effect of the age-at-maturity gene was similar in both temperatures and populations. Age at maturity is a key life history trait involving a trade-off between survival risk and reproductive investment, and is an important factor for population structures. In ectotherms, a warming environment may have a dramatic influence on development and life history, but this influence may differ between populations. While an increasing number of studies have examined population-dependent reactions with temperature, few have investigated this in the context of maturation timing. Atlantic salmon, a species of high conservation relevance, is a good study species for this topic as it displays considerable variation in age at maturity, of which a large proportion has been associated with a genomic region including the strong candidate gene vgll3. Until now, the effect of this gene in the context of different environments and populations has not been studied. Using a large-scale common-garden experiment, we find strong effects of temperature, population-of-origin, and vgll3 genotype on maturation in 2-year-old male Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). With a temperature difference of 1.8 degrees C, maturation probability was 4.8 times higher in the warm treatment than the cold treatment. This temperature effect was population-specific and was higher in the southern (60.48 degrees N) compared to the northern (65.01 degrees N) population. The early maturation vgll3{*}E allele was associated with a significantly higher maturation probability, but there was no vgll3 interaction with temperature or population. Both body condition and body mass associated with maturation. The body mass association was only present in the warm treatment. Our findings demonstrate that (i) populations can vary in their response to temperature change in terms of age at maturity, (ii) high intrinsic growth could be associated with higher thermal sensitivity for life history variation and (iii) vgll3 effects on age at maturity might be similar between populations and different thermal environments.",2023,11,1,NA
Larval growth of the polychaete <i>Arenicola marina</i> under different temperature and food conditions: consequences on bioenergetic models,"Broquard, Coralie and Lancelot, Theo and Lefebvre, Sebastien and Courcot, Lucie and Gaudron, Sylvie M.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coac033,"Arenicola marina, a marine benthic polychaete, is widespread on sandy beaches in Europe and considered as an ecosystem engineer despite commonly used as bait by fishermen. Data regarding the bioenergetics of the lugworm larval stages are still incomplete. Trochophore is initially lecithotroph and then becomes planktotroph while growing as metatrochophore on subtidal area, a quite stable daily temperature environment compared with the foreshore, where juveniles and adult live, with daily temperature fluctuating up to 15 degrees C. These discrepancies in temperature ranges may influence the temperature corrections (TCs) that control metabolic rates during the life cycle of A. marina. We carried out laboratory experiments in microcosms by inducing artificial spawning of lugworms, and then undertaken in vitro fertilization to obtain embryos and, finally, to follow, the larval development up to 10 segments with chaetae for 50 days under three temperature conditions (13 degrees C, 15 degrees C and 17 degrees C) and two food conditions ('fed'and `non-fed'). The first feeding ('birth') of A. marina larvae was deciphered anatomically for a size between 450 and 500 itm and described at 17 days post-fertilization for larvae reared at 15 degrees C and 17 degrees C. Using a biphasic model with a von Bertalanffy growth before `birth' and an exponential growth after `birth, among the three temperature treatments, the 15 degrees C condition exhibited the best larval performance. TC based on embryonic and larval metabolic rates gave an Arrhenius temperature of similar to 6661 K and a higher boundary temperature tolerance range of similar to 294.5 K. Both temperature values differ from those calculated from TC based mostly on juvenile and adult metabolic rates. We claim to use two sets of Arrhenius temperatures according to the life history stages of A. marina while using Dynamic Energy Budget model. This model was developed initially in order to manage the conservation of the lugworm species.",2022,10,1,NA
Beyond survival experiments: using biomarkers of oxidative stress and neurotoxicity to assess vulnerability of subterranean fauna to climate change,"Pallares, Susana and Sanchez-Hernandez, Juan C. and Colado, Raquel and Balart-Garcia, Pau and Comas, Jordi and Sanchez-Fernandez, David",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coaa067,"Accurate assessments of species vulnerability to climate change need to consider the physiological capacity of organisms to deal with temperature changes and identify early signs of thermally induced stress. Oxidative stress biomarkers and acetylcholinesterase activity are useful proxies of stress at the cellular and nervous system level. Such responses are especially relevant for poor dispersal organisms with limited capacity for behavioural thermoregulation, like deep subterranean species. We combined experimental measurements of upper lethal thermal limits, acclimation capacity and biomarkers of oxidative stress and neurotoxicity to assess the impact of heat stress (20 degrees C) at different exposure times (2 and 7 days) on the Iberian endemic subterranean beetle Parvospeonomus canyellesi. Survival response (7 days of exposure) was similar to that reported for other subterranean specialist beetles (high survival up to 20 degrees C but no above 23 degrees C). However, a low physiological plasticity (i.e. incapacity to increase heat tolerance via acclimation) and signs of impairment at the cellular and nervous system level were observed after 7 days of exposure at 20 degrees C. Such sublethal effects were identified by significant differences in total antioxidant capacity, glutathione S-transferase activity, the ratio of reduced to oxidized forms of glutathione and acetylcholinesterase activity between the control (cave temperature) and 20 degrees C treatment. At 2 days of exposure, most biomarker values indicated some degree of oxidative stress in both the control and high-temperature treatment, likely reflecting an initial altered physiological status associated to factors other than temperature. Considering these integrated responses and the predicted increase in temperature in its unique locality, P. canyellesi would have a narrower thermal safety margin to face climate change than that obtained considering only survival experiments. Our results highlight the importance of exploring thermally sensitive processes at different levels of biological organization to obtain more accurate estimates of the species capacity to face climate change.",2020,8,NA,NA
Elevational clines in the temperature dependence of insect performance and implications for ecological responses to climate change,"Buckley, Lauren B. and Nufio, Cesar R.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/cou035,"To what extent is insect hopping and feeding performance, which constrains the ability to obtain and assimilate resources, thermally adapted along an elevation gradient? Does temperature dependence vary between populations and species and can differences account for individualistic responses to past climate change? We investigate these questions for three species of grasshoppers along a Rocky Mountain elevation gradient. All species and populations exhibit warm adaptation for consumption and digestion, with only modest inter-and intra-specific differences. Species differ substantially in the temperature of peak hopping performance. Low-elevation populations of the warm-adapted species exhibit the highest performance at high temperatures and the lowest performance at low temperatures. Developmental plasticity influences the temperature dependence of performance; grasshoppers reared at higher temperatures perform better at higher temperatures and possess broader thermal tolerance. We fitted thermal performance curves to examine whether performance shifts can account for changes in abundance between initial surveys in 1958-1960 and recent surveys since 2006. All species and populations are able to achieve greater feeding rates now. Estimated shifts in hopping performance vary between species and along the elevation gradient. The cool-adapted species has experienced declines in hopping performance, particularly at the lower elevation sites, while the warm-adapted species has experienced increases in performance concentrated at higher elevations. These estimated performance shifts broadly concur with observed abundance shifts. Performance metrics may have a greater potential to elucidate differential responses to climate change between populations and species than coarser and oft-used proxies, such as thermal tolerance. Assessing performance directly when temperature dependence varies between processes such as the acquisition and assimilation of energy may be essential to understanding population-and species-level impacts.",2014,2,1,NA

The objective of this study was to determine if temperatures experienced at embryonic life stages of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) affected mass and routine metabolic rate (RMR) of a subsequent life stage (free-swimming fry). As part of this, we assessed the contributions and importance of hierarchical levels of biological organization {[}ancestral type (native vs. hatchery-introgressed), population, and family] to variability in mass and RMR of fry. As embryos and alevin, individuals were reared at either natural environmental (5 degrees C) or elevated (9 degrees C) temperatures and then acclimated to either matched or mismatched temperature treatments once yolk sacs were resorbed. Mass differences among fry were strongly influenced by population of origin as well as initial rearing and final acclimation temperatures. Variation in mass-adjusted RMR of fry was also strongly accounted for by source population, acclimation temperature, and individual mass. A significant interaction between population RMR and final acclimation temperature indicated that not all brook trout populations responded the same way to temperature changes. In contrast to expectations, the highest ancestry category (native vs. introgressed) did not significantly influence mass or mass-adjusted RMR.",2018,6,NA,NA

Growth, thermal tolerance and swimming performance were all impacted by river of origin, thermal acclimation temperature and life stage, highlighting the potential need for more river specific conservation guidelines. Temperature in many natural aquatic environments follows a diel cycle, but to date, we know little on how diel thermal cycles affect fish biology. The current study investigates the growth, development and physiological performance of wild Atlantic salmon collected from the Miramichi and Restigouche rivers (NB, Canada). Fish were collected as parr and acclimated to either 16-21 or 19-24 degrees C diel thermal cycles throughout the parr and smolt life stages. Both Miramichi and Restigouche Atlantic salmon parr grew at similar rates during 16-21 or 19-24 degrees C acclimations. However, as smolts, the growth rates of the Miramichi (-8\% body mass day-1) and Restigouche (-38\% body mass day-1) fish were significantly slower at 19-24 degrees C, and were in fact negative, indicating loss of mass in this group. Acclimation to 19-24 degrees C also increased Atlantic salmon CTmax. Our findings suggest that both life stage and river origin impact Atlantic salmon growth and performance in the thermal range used herein. These findings provide evidence for local adaptation of Atlantic salmon, increased vulnerability to warming temperatures, and highlight the differential impacts of these ecologically relevant diel thermal cycles on the juvenile life stages in this species.",2024,12,1,NA
Non-invasive methods to measure inter-renal function in aquatic salamanders-correlating fecal corticosterone to the environmental and physiologic conditions of captive <i>Necturus</i>,"Nagel, Andrew H. and Beshel, Mark and DeChant, Christopher J. and Huskisson, Sarah M. and Campbell, Mark K. and Stoops, Monica A.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coz074,"We measured faecal corticosterone metabolites (fCMs) in aquatic salamander Necturus to understand how inter-renal function changes throughout seasonal environmental changes and associated reproductive activity. fCMs elevated with lower water temperatures and breeding activity. To overcome some challenges associated with faecal hormone collection/analysis, waterborne corticosterone (wCM) was validated through ACTH challenge. This study sought to develop non-invasive techniques to monitor glucocorticoids in captive Necturus as a means to correlate inter-renal gland function in relation to environmental and physiological changes. Six individually housed breeding pairs of captive Necturus beyeri were subjected to seasonal changes in water temperature (30 degrees F temperature differential) to stimulate natural breeding, specifically spermatophore deposition and oviposition. An enzyme immunoassay was validated for the measurement of N. beyeri faecal corticosterone metabolites (fCMs) by exhibiting parallelism and accuracy to the standard curve. Longitudinal (December 2016-October 2017) assessment of fCM concentrations and pattern of excretion from samples collected fromthe six breeding pairs revealed a seasonal inter-renal effect with higher concentrations (P < 0.05) excreted during months (December-March) of the year associated with breeding activity and when water temperatures were lowest. Males from each pair produced spermatophores starting on 08 December 8 2016 and ending on 05 April 2017. Females from four of the six pairs went on to successfully oviposit eggs in mid-late April 2017. One clutch was fertile, and three were non-fertile. No differences (P > 0.05) were detected in fCM concentrations between pairs in which oviposition did or did not occur. In addition, a novel waterborne corticosterone metabolite (wCM) assay was validated to overcome challenges associated with faecal collection in a group-housed amphibian. An adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge performed in an adult male Necturus maculosus resulted in a 50-fold increase in wCM at 4 h post-injection and marked the first demonstration of a waterborne inter-renal response to ACTH in Necturus.

The role of salinity in recovery of white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) from stimulated angling stress,"Shartau, Ryan B. and Shu, Jacelyn and Baker, Daniel W.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coad009,"White sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) in the Lower Fraser River are the focus of a catch-and-release angling fishery in British Columbia, Canada. However, the lower region of the catch area includes areas where tidal waters invade, and the consequence of salinity levels on recovery from an angling challenge are not characterized in sturgeon, despite theoretical implications of its import. We acclimated white sturgeon to various salinities (0, 10 and 20 parts per thousand (parts per thousand)) to investigate the effects of acclimation on recovery from stimulated angling stress that was induced through manual chasing. This challenge elicited the traditional physiological responses such as ion homeostasis disturbance, increases in secondary stress indicators and metabolic acidosis; however, environmental salinity altered the timing of recovery in some of the parameters measured. In addition, the severity of the intracellular pH disturbance in both heart and red blood cell seemed to be mediated in fresh water, yet the recovery pattern of plasma chloride and bicarbonate ions seemed to be facilitated by higher salinity. In general, responses were similar but not identical, leading us to conclude that the role of salinity on recovery from exercise is complex but not insignificant. Salinity may be important to behaviours exhibited by white sturgeon (such as migrations) in their respective saline environments, but less so around the impact of an angling stressor. Further exploration of this response may provide insight on whether the current tidal boundaries for angling white sturgeon are appropriate. White sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) may be acclimated to different salinities in the Fraser River, which may impact their ability to recover from severe exercise induced by angling.

An unusually high upper thermal acclimation potential for rainbow trout,"Adams, Olivia A. and Zhang, Yangfan and Gilbert, Matthew H. and Lawrence, Craig S. and Snow, Michael and Farrell, Anthony P.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coab101,"Thermal acclimation, a compensatory physiological response, is central to species survival especially during the current era of global warming. By providing the most comprehensive assessment to date for the cardiorespiratory phenotype of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) at six acclimation temperatures from 15 degrees C to 25 degrees C, we tested the hypothesis that, compared with other strains of rainbow trout, an Australian H-strain of rainbow trout has been selectively inbred to have an unusually high and broad thermal acclimation potential. Using a field setting at the breeding hatchery in Western Australia, thermal performance curves were generated for a warm-adapted H-strain by measuring growth, feed conversion efficiency, specific dynamic action, whole-animal oxygen uptake (\& x1e40;O-2) during normoxia and hypoxia, the critical maximum temperature and the electrocardiographic response to acute warming. Appreciable growth and aerobic capacity were possible up to 23 degrees C. However, growth fell off drastically at 25 degrees C in concert with increases in the time required to digest a meal, its total oxygen cost and its peak \& x1e40;O-2. The upper thermal tipping points for appetite and food conversion efficiency corresponded with a decrease in the ability to increase heart rate during warming and an increase in the cost to digest a meal. Also, comparison of upper thermal tipping points provides compelling evidence that limitations to increasing heart rate during acute warming occurred well below the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and that the faltering ability of the heart to deliver oxygen at different acclimation temperatures is not reliably predicted by CTmax for the H-strain of rainbow trout. We, therefore, reasoned the remarkably high thermal acclimation potential revealed here for the Australian H-strain of rainbow trout reflected the existing genetic variation within the founder Californian population, which was then subjected to selective inbreeding in association with severe heat challenges. This is an encouraging discovery for those with conservation concerns for rainbow trout and other fish species. Indeed, those trying to predict the impact of global warming should more fully consider the possibility that the standing intra-specific genetic variation within a fish species could provide a high thermal acclimation potential, similar to that shown here for rainbow trout. We address a crucial question relevant to global climate change and of general interest to ecological and conservation physiologists: does a fish species normally regarded as a cold-loving species have sufficient standing intra-specific variation to form a warm-tolerant population that could perhaps thrive in a warmer world?",2022,10,1,NA
Warmer temperatures interact with salinity to weaken physiological facilitation to stress in freshwater fishes,"Walker, Richard H. and Smith, Geoffrey D. and Hudson, Spencer B. and French, Susannah S. and Walters, Annika W.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coaa107,"Management of stressors requires an understanding of how multiple stressors interact, how different species respond to those interactions and the underlying mechanisms driving observed patterns in species' responses. Salinization and rising temperatures are two pertinent stressors predicted to intensify in freshwater ecosystems, posing concern for how susceptible organisms achieve and maintain homeostasis (i.e. allostasis). Here, glucocorticoid hormones (e.g. cortisol), responsible for mobilizing energy (e.g. glucose) to relevant physiological processes for the duration of stressors, are liable to vary in response to the duration and severity of salinization and temperature rises. With field and laboratory studies, we evaluated how both salinity and temperature influence basal and stress-reactive cortisol and glucose levels in age 1+ mottled sculpin (Cottus bairdii), mountain sucker (Catostomus platyrhynchus) and Colorado River cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki pleuriticus). We found that temperature generally had the greatest effect on cortisol and glucose concentrations and the effect of salinity was often temperature dependent. We also found that when individuals were chronically exposed to higher salinities, baseline concentrations of cortisol and glucose usually declined as salinity increased. Reductions in baseline concentrations facilitated stronger stress reactivity for cortisol and glucose when exposed to additional stressors, which weakened as temperatures increased. Controlled temperatures near the species'thermal maxima became the overriding factor regulating fish physiology, resulting in inhibitory responses. With projected increases in freshwater salinization and temperatures, efforts to reduce the negative effects of increasing temperatures (i.e. increased refuge habitats and riparian cover) could moderate the inhibitory effects of temperature-dependent effects of salinization for freshwater fishes.",2020,8,NA,NA

Riverine habitats contain many economically and ecologically important fishes. One such group is the migratory salmonids, which are sensitive to warm T-water and low O-2 (hypoxia). While several studies have investigated the independent effects of T-water and hypoxia on fish physiology, the combined effects of these stressors is less well known. Furthermore, no study has investigated the effects of T-water and O-2 saturation levels within the range currently experienced by a salmonid species. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the simultaneous effects of T-water and O-2 saturation level on the energetics and kinematics of steady-state swimming in brown trout, Salmo trutta. No effect of O-2 saturation level (70 and 100\% air saturation) on tail-beat kinematics was detected. Conversely, Twater (10, 14, 18 and 22 degrees C) did affect tail-beat kinematics, but a trade-off between frequency (f(tail)) and amplitude (A, maximum tail excursion) maintained the Strouhal number (St= f(tail)center dot A/U, where U is swimming speed) within the theoretically most mechanically efficient range. Swimming oxygen consumption rate ((M)over dot O-2) and cost of transport increased with both U and Twater. The only effect of O-2 saturation level was observed at the highest T-water (22 degrees C) and fastest swimming speed (two speeds were used-0.6 and 0.8 m s(-1)). As the extremes of this study are consistent with current summer conditions in parts of UK waterways, our findings may indicate that S. trutta will be negatively impacted by the increased T-water and reduced O-2 levels likely presented by anthropogenic climate change.",2020,8,NA,NA
Effect of elevated carbon dioxide on shoal familiarity and metabolism in a coral reef fish,"Nadler, Lauren E. and Killen, Shaun S. and McCormick, Mark I. and Watson, Sue-Ann and Munday, Philip L.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/cow052,"Atmospheric CO2 is expected to more than double by the end of the century. The resulting changes in ocean chemistry will affect the behaviour, sensory systems and physiology of a range of fish species. Although a number of past studies have examined effects of CO2 in gregarious fishes, most have assessed individuals in social isolation, which can alter individual behaviour and metabolism in social species. Within social groups, a learned familiarity can develop following a prolonged period of interaction between individuals, with fishes preferentially associating with familiar conspecifics because of benefits such as improved social learning and greater foraging opportunities. However, social recognition occurs through detection of shoal-mate cues; hence, it may be disrupted by near-future CO2 conditions. In the present study, we examined the influence of elevated CO2 on shoal familiarity and the metabolic benefits of group living in the gregarious damselfish species the blue-green puller (Chromis viridis). Shoals were acclimated to one of three nominal CO2 treatments: control (450 mu atm), mid-CO2 (750 mu atm) or high-CO2 (1000 mu atm). After a 4-7 day acclimation period, familiarity was examined using a choice test, in which individuals were given the choice to associate with familiar shoal-mates or unfamiliar conspecifics. In control conditions, individuals preferentially associated with familiar shoal-mates. However, this association was lost in both elevated-CO2 treatments. Elevated CO2 did not impact the calming effect of shoaling on metabolism, as measured using an intermittent-flow respirometry methodology for social species following a 17-20 day acclimation period to CO2 treatment. In all CO2 treatments, individuals exhibited a significantly lower metabolic rate when measured in a shoal vs. alone, highlighting the complexity of shoal dynamics and the processes that influence the benefits of shoaling.",2016,4,NA,NA

Unintentional releases of hypersaline water into freshwater environments act as an osmoregulatory stressor to many aquatic organisms including native salmonids like the Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus). Compared to more euryhaline salmonids, Arctic grayling have a reduced salinity tolerance and develop an elevated interlamellar cell mass (ILCM) in response to salinity exposure (17 ppt). In this study, we described the gill morphology and cell types characterizing the ICLM. Further, we investigated whether Arctic grayling could recover in freshwater following a short-term (<48 h) salinity exposure. Arctic grayling were exposed to 17 ppt saline water for 12, 24 and 48 h. Following the 24 and 48 h salinity exposure, Arctic grayling were returned to freshwater for 24 h to assess their ability to recover from, and reverse, the osmotic disturbances. Physiological serum {[}Na+], {[}Cl-] and total osmolality were significantly elevated and progressively increased at 12, 24 and 48 h salinity exposures. The 24 h post-exposure recovery period resulted in Arctic grayling serum ion concentrations and total osmolality returning to near normal levels. Similar recovery patterns were observed in the salinity-induced ILCM, which developed as early as 12 h of exposure to 17 ppt, and then reverted to control levels following 24 h in freshwater. Gill histology indicates an increased number of apically located mucous cells in the interlamellar space following salinity exposure of Arctic grayling.

We explored independent and interactive effects of sedimentary turbidity and temperature on the swimming activity and both thermal and hypoxia tolerance of the Pugnose Shiner (Miniellus anogenus, formerly Notropis anogenus), a small leuciscid fish listed as Threatened under Canada's Species at Risk Act (SARA). Fish underwent a 15-week acclimation to two temperatures (16 degrees C or 25 degrees C) crossed with two turbidities (similar to 0 NTU or 8.5 NTU). Swimming activity was measured during the first 8 weeks of acclimation. Fish in warm water were more active compared to those in cold water, but turbidity had no effect on activity. Behavioural response to hypoxia was measured after 12 weeks of acclimation, as the oxygen level at which fish used aquatic surface respiration (ASR). Fish in warm water engaged in ASR behaviour at higher oxygen thresholds, indicating less tolerance to hypoxia. Turbidity had no effect on ASR thresholds. Finally, thermal tolerance was measured as the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) after 13-15 weeks of acclimation. Acclimation to warm water increased fish CTmax and T-ag (agitation temperature) but reduced the agitation window (degrees C difference between T-ag and CTmax) and thermal safety margin (degrees C difference between the acclimation temperature and CTmax). Furthermore, fish in warm, turbid water had a lower CTmax and smaller thermal safety margin than fish in warm, clear water, indicating an interaction between turbidity and temperature. This reduced thermal tolerance observed in Pugnose Shiner in warm, turbid water highlights the importance of quantifying independent and interactive effects of multiple stressors when evaluating habitat suitability and conservation strategies for imperilled species.",2024,12,1,NA
Seawater acclimation affects cardiac output and adrenergic control of blood pressure in rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>)-implications for salinity variations now and in the future,"Sundell, Erika and Morgenroth, Daniel and Brijs, Jeroen and Ekstrom, Andreas and Grans, Albin and Sandblom, Erik",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coy061,"Greater salinity variations resulting from ongoing climate change requires consideration in conservation management as this may impact on the performance of aquatic organisms. Euryhaline fish exhibit osmoregulatory flexibility and can exploit a wide range of salinities. In seawater (SW), they drink and absorb water in the intestine, which is associated with increased gastrointestinal blood flow. Yet, detailed information on other cardiovascular changes and their control across salinities is scant. Such knowledge is fundamental to understand how fish are affected during migrations between environments with different salinities, as well as by increased future salinity variability. We used rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) as a euryhaline model species and determined dorsal aortic blood pressure, cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance in vivo after chronic freshwater-or SW-acclimation. We also assessed a-adrenergic control of blood pressure using pharmacological tools. Dorsal aortic blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance were reduced, whereas cardiac output increased in SW. alpha-Adrenergic stimulation with phenylephrine caused similar dose-dependent increases in resistance and pressure across salinities, indicating unaltered alpha-adrenoceptor sensitivity. alpha-Adrenergic blockade with prazosin decreased resistance and pressure across salinities, but the absolute reduction in resistance was smaller in SW. Yet, both pressure and resistance after prazosin remained consistently lower in SW. This shows that SW-acclimation lowers systemic resistance through reduced vascular a-adrenergic tone, along with other unknown vasodilating factors. The marked changes in adrenergic regulation of the vasculature across salinities discovered here may have implications for cardiovascular and aerobic performance of fishes, with possible impacts on fitness-related traits like digestion and exercise capacity. Moreover, the evolution of more complex circulatory control systems in teleost fishes compared with elasmobranchs and cyclostomes may have been an important factor in the evolution of euryhalinity, and may provide euryhaline teleosts with competitive advantages in more variable salinity environments of the future.",2018,6,NA,NA
Reduced salinity tolerance in the Arctic grayling (<i>Thymallus arcticus</i>) is associated with rapid development of a gill interlamellar cell mass: implications of high-saline spills on native freshwater salmonids,"Blair, Salvatore D. and Matheson, Derrick and He, Yuhe and Goss, Greg G.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/cow010,"Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) are salmonids that have a strict freshwater existence in post-glacial North America. Oil and gas development is associated with production of high volumes of hypersaline water. With planned industrial expansion into northern areas of Canada and the USA that directly overlap grayling habitat, the threat of accidental saline water release poses a significant risk. Despite this, we understand little about the responses of grayling to hypersaline waters. We compared the physiological responses and survivability of Arctic grayling and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to tolerate an acute transfer to higher saline waters. Arctic grayling and rainbow trout were placed directly into 17 ppt salinity and sampled at 24 and 96 h along with control animals in freshwater at 24 h. Serum sodium, chloride and osmolality levels increased significantly in grayling at both 24 and 96 h time points, whereas trout were able to compensate for the osmoregulatory disturbance by 96 h. Sodium-potassium ATPase mRNA expression responses to salinity were also compared, demonstrating the inability of the grayling to up-regulate the seawater isoform nka alpha 1b. Our results demonstrated a substantially lower salinity tolerance in grayling. We also found a significant salinity-induced morphological gill remodelling by Arctic grayling, as demonstrated by the rapid growth of an interlamellar cell mass by 24 h that persisted at 96 h. We visualized and quantified the appearance of the interlamellar cell mass as a response to high salinity, although the functional significance remains to be understood fully. Compared with rainbow trout, which are used as an environmental regulatory species, Arctic grayling are unable to compensate for the osmotic stressors that would result from a highly saline produced water spill. Given these new data, collaboration between fisheries and the oil and gas industry will be vital in the long-term conservation strategies with regard to the Arctic grayling in their native habitat.",2016,4,NA,NA
A product of its environment: the epaulette shark (<i>Hemiscyllium ocellatum</i>) exhibits physiological tolerance to elevated environmental CO<sub>2</sub>,"Heinrich, Dennis D.

Recent studies have shown substantial reductions in aerobic performance in some teleost fish species, but no change or even enhanced performance in others. Notably lacking, however, are studies on the effects of near-future CO2 conditions on larger meso and apex predators, such as elasmobranchs. The epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) lives on shallow coral reef flats and in lagoons, where it may frequently encounter short-term periods of environmental hypoxia and elevated CO2, especially during nocturnal low tides. Indeed, H. ocellatum is remarkably tolerant to short periods (hours) of hypoxia, and possibly hypercapnia, but nothing is known about its response to prolonged exposure. We exposed H. ocellatum individuals to control (390 mu atm) or one of two near-future CO2 treatments (600 or 880 mu atm) for a minimum of 60 days and then measured key aspects of their respiratory physiology, namely the resting oxygen consumption rate, which is used to estimate resting metabolic rate, and critical oxygen tension, a proxy for hypoxia sensitivity. Neither of these respiratory attributes was affected by the long-term exposure to elevated CO2. Furthermore, there was no change in citrate synthase activity, a cellular indicator of aerobic energy production. Plasma bicarbonate concentrations were significantly elevated in sharks exposed to 600 and 880 mu atm CO2 treatments, indicating that acidosis was probably prevented by regulatory changes in acid-base relevant ions. Epaulette sharks may therefore possess adaptations that confer tolerance to CO2 levels projected to occur in the ocean by the end of this century. It remains uncertain whether other elasmobranchs, especially pelagic species that do not experience such diurnal fluctuations in their environment, will be equally tolerant.",2014,2,1,NA
Physiological consequences of rising water salinity for a declining freshwater turtle,"Agha, Mickey and Yanagitsuru, Yuzo R. and Fangue, Nann A. and Nowakowski, A.

Increased water salinities can in turn alter the geographic distribution and ecology of freshwater species including turtles. The physiological consequences of salinization for freshwater turtles, however, are poorly known. Here, we compared the osmoregulatory response of two geographically separate populations of the freshwater Western Pond Turtle (Actinemys marmorata)-a species declining across its range in western North America-to three constant salinities: 0.4 ppt, 10 ppt and 15 ppt over 2 weeks. We found that turtles from a coastal estuarine marsh population regulated their plasma osmolality at lower levels than their conspecifics from an inland freshwater creek population 45 km away. Plasma osmolalities were consistently lower in estuarine marsh turtles than the freshwater creek turtles over the entire 2-week exposure to 10 ppt and 15 ppt water. Furthermore, estuarine marsh turtles maintained plasma osmolalities within 1 SD of their mean field osmolalities over the 2-week exposure, whereas freshwater creek turtles exceeded their field values within the first few days after exposure to elevated salinities. However, individuals from both populations exhibited body mass loss in 15 ppt water, with significantly greater loss in estuarine turtles. We speculate that the greater ability to osmoregulate by the estuarine marsh turtles may be explained by their reduced feeding and drinking in elevated salinities that was not exhibited by the freshwater creek population. However, due to mass loss in both populations, physiological and behavioural responses exhibited by estuarine marsh turtles may only be effective adaptations for short-term exposures to elevated salinities, such as those from tides and when traversing saline habitats, and are unlikely to be effective for long-term exposure to elevated salinity as is expected under sea-level rise.",2019,7,NA,NA
Validation of the i-STAT system for the analysis of blood parameters in fish,"Harter, T. S. and Shartau, R. B. and Brauner, C. J. and Farrell, A. P.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/cou037,"Portable clinical analysers, such as the i-STAT system, are increasingly being used for blood analysis in animal ecology and physiology because of their portability and easy operation. Although originally conceived for clinical application and to replace robust but lengthy techniques, researchers have extended the use of the i-STAT system outside of humans and even to poikilothermic fish, with only limited validation. The present study analysed a range of blood parameters {[}pH, haematocrit (Hct), haemoglobin (Hb), HCO3-, partial pressure of CO2 (PCO2), partial pressure of O-2 (PO2), Hb saturation (sO(2)) and Na+ concentration] in a model teleost fish (rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss) using the i-STAT system (CG8+ cartridges) and established laboratory techniques. This methodological comparison was performed at two temperatures (10 and 20 degrees C), two haematocrits (low and high) and three PCO2 levels (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5\%). Our results indicate that pH was measured accurately with the i-STAT system over a physiological pH range and using the i-STAT temperature correction. Haematocrit was consistently underestimated by the i-STAT, while the measurements of Na+, PCO2, HCO3- and PO2 were variably inaccurate over the range of values typically found in fish. The algorithm that the i-STAT uses to calculate sO(2) did not yield meaningful results on rainbow trout blood. Application of conversion factors to correct i-STAT measurements is not recommended, due to significant effects of temperature, Hct and PCO2 on the measurement errors and complex interactions may exist. In conclusion, the i-STAT system can easily generate fast results from rainbow trout whole blood, but many are inaccurate values.",2014,2,1,NA
"Impact of ocean acidification on the hypoxia tolerance of the woolly sculpin, <i>Clinocottus analis</i>","Hancock, Joshua R. and Place, Sean P.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/cow040,"As we move into the Anthropocene, organisms inhabiting marine environments will continue to face growing challenges associated with changes in ocean pH (ocean acidification), dissolved oxygen (dead zones) and temperature. These factors, in combination with naturally variable environments such as the rocky intertidal zone, may create extreme physiological challenges for organisms that are already performing near their biological limits. Although numerous studies have examined the impacts of climate-related stressors on intertidal animals, little is known about the underlying physiological mechanisms driving adaptation to ocean acidification and how this may alter organism interactions, particularly in marine vertebrates. Therefore, we have investigated the effects of decreased ocean pH on the hypoxia response of an intertidal sculpin, Clinocottus analis. We used both whole-animal and biochemistry-based analyses to examine how the energetic demands associated with acclimation to low-pH environments may impact the fish's reliance on facultative air breathing in low-oxygen environments. Our study demonstrated that acclimation to ocean acidification resulted in elevated routine metabolic rates and acid-base regulatory capacity (Na+,K+-ATPase activity). These, in turn, had downstream effects that resulted in decreased hypoxia tolerance (i.e. elevated critical oxygen tension). Furthermore, we present evidence that these fish may be living near their physiological capacity when challenged by ocean acidification. This serves as a reminder that the susceptibility of teleost fish to changes in ocean pH may be underestimated, particularly when considering the multiple stressors that many experience in their natural environments.",2016,4,NA,NA

Freshwater turtles are of particular concern as they appear to have limited ability to cope with environmental conditions that are hyperosmotic to their body fluids. Here, we determined the physiological responses of two Australian freshwater chelid turtles, Emydura macquarii and Chelodina expansa, exposed to freshwater (0\%(0)) and brackish water (15\%, representing a hyperosmotic environment). Brackish water is common in the Murray-Darling River Basin within the natural range of these species in Australia during periods of drought, yet it is unknown how well these species tolerate saline conditions. We hypothesized that these turtles would be unable to maintain homeostasis in the 15\% water treatment and would suffer osmotic loss of water, increased ionic concentrations and a decrease in body mass. Results revealed that these turtles had elevated plasma concentrations of sodium, chloride, urea and uric acid in the plasma. Plasma ionic concentrations increased proportionally more in E. macquarii than in C. expansa. Individuals of both species reduced feeding in 15\% water, indicating that behaviour may provide an additional means for freshwater turtles to limit ion/solute influx when in hyperosmotic environments. This osmoregulatory behaviour may allow for persistence of turtles in regions affected by salinization; however, growth rates and body condition may be affected in the long term. Although we demonstrate that these turtles have mechanisms to survive temporarily in saline waters, it is likely that sustained salinization of waterways will exceed their short-to medium-term capacity to survive increased salt levels, making salinization a potentially key threatening process for these freshwater reptiles.",2016,4,NA,NA
Thermal tolerance and survival are modulated by a natural gradient of infection in differentially acclimated hosts,"De Bonville, Jeremy and Cote, Ariane and Binning, Sandra A.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coae015,"This study shows that different parasites may influence the thermal tolerance and the survival of their hosts, pumpkinseed sunfish, suggesting that such stressors are important to increase the ecological relevance of thermal tolerance studies of wild animals. Wild ectotherms are exposed to multiple stressors, including parasites, that can affect their responses to environmental change. Simultaneously, unprecedented warm temperatures are being recorded worldwide, increasing both the average and maximum temperatures experienced in nature. Understanding how ectotherms, such as fishes, will react to the combined stress of parasites and higher average temperatures can help predict the impact of extreme events such as heat waves on populations. The critical thermal method (CTM), which assesses upper (CTmax) and lower (CTmin) thermal tolerance, is often used in acclimated ectotherms to help predict their tolerance to various temperature scenarios. Despite the widespread use of the CTM across taxa, few studies have characterized the response of naturally infected fish to extreme temperature events or how acute thermal stress affects subsequent survival. We acclimated naturally infected pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus) to four ecologically relevant temperatures (10, 15, 20 and 25 degrees C) and one future warming scenario (30 degrees C) for 3 weeks before measuring CTmax and CTmin. We also assessed individual survival the week following CTmax. Parasites were counted and identified following trials to relate infection intensity to thermal tolerance and survival. Interestingly, trematode parasites causing black spot disease were negatively related to CTmax, suggesting that heavily infected fish are less tolerant to acute warming. Moreover, fish infected with yellow grub parasites showed decreased survival in the days following CTmax implying that the infection load has negative survival consequences on sunfish during extreme warming events. Our findings indicate that, when combined, parasite infection and high prolonged average temperatures can affect fish thermal tolerance and survival, emphasizing the need to better understand the concomitant effects of stressors on health outcomes in wild populations. This is especially true given that some parasite species are expected to thrive in warming waters making host fish species especially at risk.",2024,12,1,NA
Interactions between rates of temperature change and acclimation affect latitudinal patterns of warming tolerance,"Allen, Jessica L. and Chown, Steven L. and Janion-Scheepers, Charlene and Clusella-Trullas, Susana",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/cow053,"Critical thermal limits form an increasing component of the estimation of impacts of global change on ectotherms. Whether any consistent patterns exist in the interactive effects of rates of temperature change (or experimental ramping rates) and acclimation on critical thermal limits and warming tolerance (one way of assessing sensitivity to climate change) is, however, far from clear. Here, we examine the interacting effects of ramping rate and acclimation on the critical thermal maxima (CTmax) and minima (CTmin) and warming tolerance of six species of springtails from sub-tropical, temperate and polar regions. We also provide microhabitat temperatures from 26 sites spanning 5 years in order to benchmark environmentally relevant rates of temperature change. Ramping rate has larger effects than acclimation on CTmax, but the converse is true for CTmin. Responses to rate and acclimation effects are more consistent among species for CTmax than for CTmin. In the latter case, interactions among ramping rate and acclimation are typical of polar species, less marked for temperate ones, and reduced in species from the sub-tropics. Ramping rate and acclimation have substantial effects on estimates of warming tolerance, with the former being more marked. At the fastest ramping rates (>1.0 degrees C/min), tropical species have estimated warming tolerances similar to their temperate counterparts, whereas at slow ramping rates (<0.4 degrees C/min) the warming tolerance is much reduced in tropical species. Rates of temperate change in microhabitats relevant to the springtails are typically <0.05 degrees C/min, with rare maxima of 0.3-0.5 degrees C/min depending on the site.

The present study examines the relationship between individual response to a thermal challenge test (CTmax), susceptibility to peroxidation of membrane lipids, heart fatty acid profiles and cardiac antioxidant enzyme activities in two salmonid species from different thermal habitats (Salvelinus alpinus, Salvelinus fontinalis) and their hybrids. The susceptibility to peroxidation of membranes in the heartwas negatively correlated with individual thermal tolerance. The same relationshipwas found for arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acid. Total H2O2 buffering activity of the heart musclewas higher for the group with high thermal resistance. These findings underline a potential general causative relationship between sensitivity to oxidative stress, specific fatty acids, antioxidant activity in the cardiac muscle and thermal tolerance in fish and likely other ectotherms. Heart fatty acid profile could be indicative of species resilience to global change, and more importantly the plasticity of this trait could predict the adaptability of fish species or populations to changes in environmental temperature.",2020,8,NA,NA
"Ocean warming favours a northern Argyrosomus species over its southern congener, whereas preliminary metabolic evidence suggests that hybridization may promote their adaptation","Pringle, Brett A. and Duncan, I, Murray and Winkler, Alexander C. and Mafwila, Samuel and Jagger, Charmaine and McKeown, Niall J. and Shaw, Paul W. and Henriques, Romina and Potts, Warren M.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coad026,"Anthropogenic-induced climate change is having profound impacts on aquatic ecosystems, and the resilience of fish populations will be determined by their response to these impacts. The northern Namibian coast is an ocean warming hotspot, with temperatures rising faster than the global average. The rapid warming in Namibia has had considerable impacts on marine fauna, such as the southern extension of the distribution of Argyrosomus coronus from southern Angola into northern Namibian waters, where it now overlaps and hybridizes with the closely related Namibian species, A. inodorus. Understanding how these species (and their hybrids) perform at current and future temperatures is vital to optimize adaptive management for Argyrosomus species. Intermittent flow-through respirometry was used to quantify standard and maximum metabolic rates for Argyrosomus individuals across a range of temperatures. The modelled aerobic scope (AS) of A. inodorus was notably higher at cooler temperatures (12, 15, 18 and 21 degrees C) compared with that of A. coronus, whereas the AS was similar at 24 degrees C. Although only five hybrids were detected and three modelled, their AS was in the upper bounds of the models at 15, 18 and 24 degrees C. These findings suggest that the warming conditions in northern Namibia may increasingly favour A. coronus and promote the poleward movement of the leading edge of their southern distribution. In contrast, the poor aerobic performance of both species at cold temperatures (12 degrees C) suggests that the cold water associated with the permanent Luderitz Upwelling Cell in the south may constrain both species to central Namibia. This is most concerning for A. inodorus because it may be subjected to a considerable coastal squeeze. This study used metabolic experiments to show that ocean warming in southern Angola and northern Namibia will likely favour Argyrosomus coronus over its cooler water relative, A. inodorus.

The role of temperature in vitality and survival assessments of beam-trawled and discarded European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa),"Uhlmann, Sven Sebastian and Paoletti, Silvia and Ampe, Bart and Theodoridis, Konstantinos and Kochzius, Marc and Koeck, Barbara",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coae036,"In the present study, we assessed reflex impairment and its relation to survival of European plaice after capture with commercial beam-trawl fishing gear and subsequent release.

Thermal stress can influence the recovery of fish released after capture. Vitality assessments using reflex and behavioural responses require that responses can be observed reliably, independent of temperature. Here, we tested whether reflex and behavioural impairment and survival of beam-trawled and discarded European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) are independent from seasonal air and water temperature deviations. In total, 324 beam-trawled plaice (n = 196 in summer and n = 128 in winter) were exposed to two air temperature treatments and two water treatments (i.e. modified and ambient temperatures for both). The modified treatments (i.e. cooled in summer, warmed in winter) represent the thermal shock a fish may experience when being returned to the water. All reflexes and tested behaviours were affected by ambient temperature, with high impairment noted in summer. None of the reflexes were affected by temperature shocks alone, only body flex was. Body flex was highly impaired under every exposure combination. Fish size and duration of air exposure further influenced impairment of reflexes such as head complex and tail grab. More generally, post-release survival was assessed as 21\% {[}95\% CI: 16-28\%] in summer and 99\% {[}97-100\%] in winter. Beam trawling in summer is likely to induce high reflex impairment and mortality in discarded plaice, and therefore spatial-temporal mitigation approaches should be prioritized over control of on-board temperatures.",2024,12,1,NA
"Different drivers, common mechanism; the distribution of a reef fish is restricted by local-scale oxygen and temperature constraints on aerobic metabolism","Duncan, I, Murray and James, Nicola C. and Potts, Warren M. and Bates, Amanda E. and Cooke, Steven",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coaa090,"The distributions of ectothermic marine organisms are limited to temperature ranges and oxygen conditions that support aerobic respiration, quantified within the metabolic index (f) as the ratio of oxygen supply to metabolic oxygen demand. However, the utility of f at local scales and across heterogenous environments is unknown; yet, these scales are often where actionable management decisions are made. Here, we test if f can delimit the entire distribution of marine organisms when calibrated across an appropriate temperature range and at local scales (similar to 10 km) using the endemic reef fish, Chrysoblephus laticeps, which is found in the highly heterogenous temperature and oxygen environment along the South African coastal zone, as a model species. In laboratory experiments, we find a bidirectional (at 12 degrees C) hypoxia tolerance response across the temperature range tested (8 to 24 degrees C), permitting a piecewise calibration of phi. We then project this calibrated f model through temperature and oxygen data from a high spatial resolution (11 to 13 km) ocean model for the periods 2005 to 2009 and 2095 to 2099 to quantify various magnitudes of phi across space and time paired with complementary C. laticeps occurrence points. Using random forest species distribution models, we quantify a critical phi value of 2.78 below which C. laticeps cannot persist and predict current and future distributions of C. laticeps in line with already observed distribution shifts of other South African marine species. Overall, we find that C. laticeps' distribution is limited by increasing temperatures towards its warm edge but by low oxygen availability towards its cool edge, which is captured within phi at fine scales and across heterogenous oxygen and temperature combinations. Our results support the application of phi for generating local- and regional-scale predictions of climate change effects on organisms that can inform local conservation management decisions.",2020,8,NA,NA
Physiological mechanisms linking cold acclimation and the poleward distribution limit of a range-extending marine fish,"Wolfe, Barrett W. and Fitzgibbon, Quinn P. and Semmens, Jayson M. and Tracey, Sean R. and Pecl, Gretta T.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coaa045,"Extensions of species'geographical distributions, or range extensions, are among the primary ecological responses to climate change in the oceans. Considerable variation across the rates at which species' ranges change with temperature hinders our ability to forecast range extensions based on climate data alone. To better manage the consequences of ongoing and future range extensions for global marine biodiversity, more information is needed on the biological mechanisms that link temperatures to range limits. This is especially important at understudied, low relative temperatures relevant to poleward range extensions, which appear to outpace warm range edge contractions four times over. Here, we capitalized on the ongoing range extension of a teleost predator, the Australasian snapper Chrysophrys auratus, to examine multiple measures of ecologically relevant physiological performance at the population's poleward range extension front. Swim tunnel respirometry was used to determine how mid-range and poleward range edge winter acclimation temperatures affect metabolic rate, aerobic scope, swimming performance and efficiency and recovery from exercise. Relative to `optimal' mid-range temperature acclimation, subsequent range edge minimum temperature acclimation resulted in absolute aerobic scope decreasing while factorial aerobic scope increased; efficiency of swimming increased while maximum sustainable swimming speed decreased; and recovery from exercise required a longer duration despite lower oxygen payback. Cold-acclimated swimming faster than 0.9 body lengths sec(-1) required a greater proportion of aerobic scope despite decreased cost of transport. Reduced aerobic scope did not account for declines in recovery and lower maximum sustainable swimming speed. These results suggest that while performances decline at range edge minimum temperatures, cold-acclimated snapper are optimized for energy savings and range edge limitation may arise from suboptimal temperature exposure throughout the year rather than acute minimum temperature exposure. We propose incorporating performance data with in situ behaviour and environmental data in bioenergetic models to better understand how thermal tolerance determines range limits.",2020,8,NA,NA
Intraspecific variability in thermal tolerance: a case study with coastal cutthroat trout,"Anlauf-Dunn, Kara and Kraskura, Krista and Eliason, Erika J.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coac029,"Coastal cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki clarki) are wide-ranging species, distributed throughout the river network. In this study, we evaluated how thermal performance varied in coastal cutthroat trout across four hydrologically distinct watersheds. Coastal cutthroat trout displayed considerable variability in physiological performance to varying temperature treatments. Understanding species physiological responses to current thermal regimes allows for a more nuanced approach to the management and conservation of native fish species into the future. Fish physiological performance is directly regulated by their thermal environment. Intraspecific comparisons are essential to ascertain the vulnerability of fish populations to climate change and to identify which populations may be more susceptible to extirpation and which may be more resilient to continued warming. In this study, we sought to evaluate how thermal performance varies in coastal cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki clarki) across four distinct watersheds in OR, USA. Specifically, we measured oxygen consumption rates in trout from the four watersheds with variable hydrologic and thermal regimes, comparing three ecologically relevant temperature treatments (ambient, annual maximum and novel warm). Coastal cutthroat trout displayed considerable intraspecific variability in physiological performance and thermal tolerance across the four watersheds. Thermal tolerance matched the historical experience: the coastal watersheds experiencing warmer ambient temperatures had higher critical thermal tolerance compared with the interior, cooler Willamette watersheds. Physiological performance varied across all four watersheds and there was evidence of a trade-off between high aerobic performance and broad thermal tolerance. Given the evidence of climate regime shifts across the globe, the uncertainty in both the rate and extent of warming and species responses in the near and long term, a more nuanced approach to the management and conservation of native fish species must be considered.",2022,10,1,NA
The effects of elevated temperature and ocean acidification on the metabolic pathways of notothenioid fish,"Enzor, Laura A. and Hunter, Evan M. and Place, Sean P.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/cox019,"The adaptations used by notothenioid fish to combat extreme cold may have left these fish poorly poised to deal with a changing environment.

Despite recent lines of evidence demonstrating that notothenioid fish retain the ability to acclimate to elevated temperatures, the underlying mechanisms responsible for temperature acclimation in these fish remain largely unknown. Furthermore, little information exists on the capacity of Antarctic fish to respond to changes in multiple environmental variables. We have examined the effects of increased temperature and pCO(2) on the rate of oxygen consumption in three notothenioid species, Trematomus bernacchii, Pagothenia borchgrevinki, and Trematomus newnesi. We combined these measurements with analysis of changes in aerobic and anaerobic capacity, lipid reserves, fish condition, and growth rates to gain insight into the metabolic cost associated with acclimation to this dual stress. Our findings indicated that temperature is the major driver of the metabolic responses observed in these fish and that increased pCO(2) plays a small, contributing role to the energetic costs of the acclimation response. All three species displayed varying levels of energetic compensation in response to the combination of elevated temperature and pCO(2). While P. borchgrevinki showed nearly complete compensation of whole animal oxygen consumption rates and aerobic capacity, T. newnesi and T. bernacchii displayed only partial compensation in these metrics, suggesting that at least some notothenioids may require physiological trade-offs to fully offset the energetic costs of long-term acclimation to climate change related stressors.",2017,5,NA,NA
Inter-population differences in salinity tolerance of adult wild Sacramento splittail: osmoregulatory and metabolic responses to salinity,"Verhille, Christine E. and Dabruzzi, Theresa F. and Cocherell, Dennis E. and Mahardja, Brian and Feyrer, Fred and Foin, Theodore C. and Baerwald, Melinda R. and Fangue, Nann A.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coaa098,"The Sacramento splittail (Pogonichthys macrolepidotus) is composed of two genetically distinct populations endemic to the San Francisco Estuary (SFE). The allopatric upstream spawning habitat of the Central Valley (CV) population connects with the sympatric rearing grounds via relatively low salinity waters, whereas the San Pablo (SP) population must pass through the relatively high-salinity Upper SFE to reach its allopatric downstream spawning habitat. We hypothesize that if migration through SFE salinities to SP spawning grounds is more challenging for adult CV than SP splittail, then salinity tolerance, osmoregulatory capacity, and metabolic responses to salinity will differ between populations. Osmoregulatory disturbances, assessed by measuring plasma osmolality and ions, muscle moisture and Na+-K+-ATPase activity after 168 to 336 h at 11 parts per thousand salinity, showed evidence for a more robust osmoregulatory capacity in adult SP relative to CV splittail. While both resting and maximum metabolic rates were elevated in SP splittail in response to increased salinity, CV splittail metabolic rates were unaffected by salinity. Further, the calculated difference between resting and maximum metabolic values, aerobic scope, did not differ significantly between populations. Therefore, improved osmoregulation came at a metabolic cost for SP splittail but was not associated with negative impacts on scope for aerobic metabolism. These results suggest that SP splittail may be physiologically adjusted to allow for migration through higher-salinity waters. The trends in interpopulation variation in osmoregulatory and metabolic responses to salinity exposures support our hypothesis of greater salinity-related challenges to adult CV than SP splittail migration and are consistent with our previous findings for juvenile splittail populations, further supporting our recommendation of population-specific management.",2020,8,NA,NA
Respiratory acidosis and O<sub>2</sub> supply capacity do not affect the acute temperature tolerance of rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>),"Montgomery, Daniel W. and Finlay, Jennifer and Simpson, Stephen D. and Engelhard, Georg H. and Birchenough, Silvana N.

Here, we explored whether two acute exposures (similar to 0.5 hours or similar to 72 hours) to increased CO2 impact acute temperature tolerance limits in a freshwater fish, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). We separated the potential effects of acute high CO2 exposure on critical thermal maximum (CTmax), caused via either respiratory acidosis (reduced internal pH) or O-2 supply capacity (aerobic scope), by exposing rainbow trout to similar to 1 kPa CO2 (similar to 1\% or 10 000 mu atm) in combination with normoxia or hyperoxia (similar to 21 or 42 kPa O-2, respectively). In normoxia, acute exposure to high CO2 caused a large acidosis in trout (blood pH decreased by 0.43 units), while a combination of hyperoxia and similar to 1 kPa CO2 increased the aerobic scope of trout by 28\%. Despite large changes in blood pH and aerobic scope between treatments, we observed no impacts on the CTmax of trout.

Physiological responses of three species of unionid mussels to intermittent exposure to elevated carbon dioxide,"Hannan, Kelly D. and Jeffrey, Jennifer D. and Hasler, Caleb T. and Suski, Cory D.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/cow066,"Freshwater systems are at risk owing to increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, and one of the possible reasons for these elevations is the deployment of non-physical fish barriers to prevent invasive fish movements. Carbon dioxide barriers have the potential to create short, chronic and intermittent exposures of CO2 for surrounding freshwater biota. Although intermittent exposures to a stressor may be more ecologically relevant, the majority of laboratory tests use chronic or short-term time periods to determine how organisms will respond to an environmental stressor. Measurements of the physiological responses of three species of unionid mussel, giant floaters (Pyganodon grandis), threeridge (Amblema plicata) and plain pocketbook (Lampsilis cardium), exposed to control pCO(2) (similar to 1000 mu atm) or intermittent conditions of pCO(2) (ranging from similar to 1000 to similar to 55 000 mu atm) 12 times per day over a 28 day period were gathered. There was no indication of recovery in the physiological responses of mussels between applications of CO2, suggesting that the recovery time between CO2 pulses (1.5 h) was not sufficient for recovery from the CO2 exposure period (0.5 h). Observations of acid-base and stress responses were consistent with what has been observed in chronic studies of freshwater mussels exposed to elevated pCO(2) (i.e. elevations in HCO3-, Ca2+, Na+ and glucose, and decreases in Mg2+ and Cl-). However, species differences were observed across almost all variables measured, which emphasizes the need for multispecies studies.",2016,4,NA,NA

If the abilities of squid to effectively take up oxygen are negatively affected by projected future carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in ways similar to those demonstrated in some fish and invertebrates, it could affect the success of squid in future oceans. While there is evidence that acute exposure to elevated CO2 has adverse effects on cephalopod respiratory performance, no studies have investigated this in an adult cephalopod after relatively prolonged exposure to elevated CO2 or determined any effects on aerobic scope. Here, we tested the effects of prolonged exposure (>= 20\% of lifespan) to elevated CO2 levels (similar to 1000 mu atm) on the routine and maximal oxygen uptake rates, aerobic scope and recovery time of two tropical cephalopod species, the two-toned pygmy squid, Idiosepius pygmaeus and the bigfin reef squid, Sepioteuthis lessoniana. Neither species exhibited evidence of altered aerobic performance after exposure to elevated CO2 when compared to individuals held at control conditions. The recovery time of I. pygmaeus under both control and elevated CO2 conditions was less than 1 hour, whereas S. lessoniana required approximately 8 hours to recover fully following maximal aerobic performance. This difference in recovery time may be due to the more sedentary behaviours of I. pygmaeus. The ability of these two cephalopod species to cope with prolonged exposure to elevated CO2 without detriment to their aerobic performance suggests some resilience to an increasingly high CO2 world.",2019,7,NA,NA

Sampling repeatedly over a 14-day period in laboratory experiments and using microplate respirometry techniques, we found that the metabolic rate of juvenile pteropods increased in response to low-pH exposure (pH 7.7) at -0.8 degrees C, a near-ambient temperature. Similarly, metabolic rate increased when pteropods were exposed simultaneously to multiple stressors: lowered pH conditions ( pH 7.7) and a high temperature (4 degrees C). Overall, the results showed that pCO(2) and temperature interact additively to affect metabolic rates in pteropods. Furthermore, we found that L. h. antarctica can tolerate acute exposure to temperatures far beyond its maximal habitat temperature.

Microclimate drives intraspecific thermal specialization: conservation perspectives in freshwater habitats,"Bartolini, Fabrizio and Giomi, Folco",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coab006,"Endemic and relict species are often confined to ecological refugia or over fragmented distributions, representing priority conservation subjects. Within these sites, the individual population may realize distinct niches to a varying degree of specialization. An emblematic example is provided by freshwater species segregated in thermal-mineral springs, where individuals may face highly diverse microclimates in limited geographic areas. Downscaling the characterization of physiological traits to microclimatic niches becomes pivotal to adopt effective conservation measures in these heterogeneous habitats. Melanopsis etrusca (Brot, 1862) is an endangered relict snail endemic to a small number of thermal-mineral streams in central Italy. Here we describe the thermal tolerance of two populations of M. etrusca inhabiting streams with distinctly different thermal regimes, investigating the extent of physiological and behavioural specialization to such diverse microclimatic niches. The comparison of oxygen consumption rates of a population dwelling in temperate streams, characterized by seasonal temperature fluctuations (12-27 degrees C), with a population experiencing constantly hot water (35-38 degrees C) revealed the absence of any seasonal or geographic effect on metabolic compensation. Conversely, mobility performances were maximized in the population inhabiting the hot stream. Interestingly, here, the snails exhibited emersion behaviour outside the water, triggered by temperatures above 37 degrees C. In the field, individuals of this population are observed inactive on stream banks, conceivably to minimize the metabolic cost that otherwise would be induced by remaining in the hot water. Only a few individuals from the temperate stream exhibited the same behaviour when exposed to elevated temperatures, suggesting the exaptation of a preexisting trait during the evolutionary process of adaptation to hot waters. The present results provide elements for the best practice in future programmes aimed at reintroducing stocks of threatened species across heterogeneous habitats. Our study further underlines the relevance of downscaling data collection for endangered species conservation in order to recognize microclimatic specializations.",2021,9,NA,NA

F. and Grosell, Martin and Steffensen, John F.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coz004,"Although considered a stenohaline freshwater species, European perch (Perca fluviatilis) inhabit brackish waters. The present study determined the maximum salinity tolerance and osmoregulatory capability on individuals originating from brackish water and from freshwater populations. The fish were acclimated for 3 weeks to salinities of 0, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5 and 20 after an initial stepwise increase to the target salinity. The maximum salinity tolerance was determined as the test salinity below which the fish could not acclimate and lost equilibrium. Blood plasma osmolality was measured if the fish had not lost equilibrium after the acclimation period. The maximum salinity tolerance was 17.5 for brackish water European perch and 10 for fresh water European perch. The high salinity tolerance of the brackish water European perch was caused by their ability to both hyper- and hypo-osmoregulate, whereas the freshwater originating fish could only hyper-osmoregulate. The results showed that maximum salinity tolerances and osmoregulatory capabilities depends on the origin habitat salinity. Due to genetic differentiation between European perch populations in brackish and fresh water, the possibility of brackish water European perch being a subspecies of European perch is discussed, yet vital knowledge concerning heritability of salinity tolerance traits is still missing. Regardless of species status, within-species plasticity in the ability to cope with varying salinities have substantial ecological and conservation implications and underlines the need for managing brackish water and freshwater European perch stocks separately.",2019,7,NA,NA

In the current study, the effects of salinity and DO on metabolic rate, critical oxygen partial pressure (P-crit), heart rate and osmoregulation in two intertidal crab species commonly found on New Zealand coastlines, Hemigrapsus crenulatus and Hemigrapsus sexdentatus, were measured. Based on its habitation of burrows in the lower intertidal zone, H. crenulatus was predicted to be more resilient to these environmental stressors than H. sexdentatus, which is distributed in the mid to high tidal zone. However, relative to the full-strength seawater control, there were no consistent salinity-dependent changes in respiratory or cardiovascular endpoints in either species following acute 6-h exposures mimicking a tidal cycle. Analysis of haemolymph osmolality and ions determined that both crab species were strong osmotic and ionic regulators over the 6-h exposure period. However, the threshold salinities at which significant changes in osmotic and ionic regulation occurred did differ and generally indicated that H. crenulatus was the better regulator. Respiratory and cardiovascular responses to DO were prominent, with a strong bradycardia observed in both species. Changes in osmolality and sodium ion regulation were also seen as DO declined. The effect on sodium ion levels had its onset at a higher oxygen partial pressure in H. sexdentatus than in H. crenulatus, indicative of a relatively poorer hypoxia tolerance in the former species. The relative resilience of respiratory, cardiovascular and osmoregulatory processes to salinity and DO variations likely contribute to distinct habitat distributions of the two crab species on New Zealand shorelines, although behaviour and inter-specific interactions may also play important roles. Environmental change, in the form of coastal erosion and anthropogenic contamination of estuaries, has the potential to disturb the delicate niche separation that exists between these species.",2019,7,NA,NA

Surprisingly, resting O-2 consumption rates were significantly lower and maximal O-2 consumption rates significantly higher in high-CO2-exposed fish compared with control fish (451 mu atm CO2). Consequently, high-CO2-exposed fish exhibited an unexpected increase in absolute (38\%) and factorial aerobic scopes (47\%). Haematological and muscle water changes associated with exercise were not affected by CO2 treatment. Thus, contrary to predictions, our results suggest that elevated CO2 may enhance aerobic scope of some fish species. Long-term experiments are now required to assess the response to elevated CO2 further, because developmental and transgenerational effects can be dramatic in fish. Ultimately, understanding the variability among species regarding the effects of CO2 on aerobic scope will be critical in predicting the impacts of ocean acidification on marine communities and ecosystems.",2013,1,1,NA

The rising temperature affects ecology through physiology, by exerting a direct limiting effect on the individual. The mechanism controlling individual thermal tolerance is still elusive, but some evidence shows that the heart plays a central role, and that insufficient transport of oxygen to the respiring tissues may determine the thermal tolerance of animals. In this study, the influence of the heart in thermal limitation was investigated by measurements of aerobic scope in the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) together with measurements of cardiac output during rest and activity. Aerobic capacity was not limited by an acutely increased temperature in the European eel. Oxygen demand was met by an increase in heart rate and arteriovenous extraction. These findings suggest that thermal tolerance during exposure to acute temperature changes is not defined by oxygen transport capacity in the eel, and other mechanisms may play a central role in limiting thermal tolerance in these fish.",2016,4,NA,NA

Therefore, we compared cardiac performance of two icefish species, Chionodraco rastrospinosus (Hb(-)Mb(+)) and Chaenocephalus aceratus (Hb(-)Mb(-)), with a related notothenioid, Notothenia coriiceps (Hb(+)Mb(+)) using an in situ perfused heart preparation. The maximum (Q)over dot, heart rate (f(H)), maximum cardiac work (WC) and relative ventricular mass of N. coriiceps at 1 degrees C were comparable to temperate-water teleosts, and acute warming to 4 degrees C increased fH and WC, as expected. In contrast, icefish hearts accommodated a higher maximum stroke volume (VS) and maximum. Q at 1 degrees C, but their unusually large hearts had a lower fH and maximum afterload tolerance than N. coriiceps at 1 degrees C. Furthermore, maximum VS, maximum.

The ability of lampreys to return to the ocean or estuary and search out alternative spawning river systems would be limited by their osmoregulatory ability in seawater. A reduction in tolerance to salinity has been documented in migrants, although the underlying mechanisms have not been characterized. We examined the capacity for marine osmoregulation in upstream spawning migrants by characterizing the physiological effects of salinity challenge from a molecular perspective. Estuarine-captured migrants held in freshwater (FW) for similar to 1 week (short-term acclimation) or 2 months (long-term acclimation) underwent an incremental salinity challenge until loss of equilibrium occurred and upper thresholds of 25 and 17.5, respectively, occurred.

A >90\% drop in haematocrit indicated haemolysis, and higher plasma concentrations of the cytosolic enzymes alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase indicated damage to other tissues, including liver. However, >80\% of short-term FW-acclimated fish were able to osmoregulate efficiently, with less haemolysis and tissue damage. This osmoregulatory ability was correlated with significant upregulation of the secretory form of Na+:K+:2Cl(-) cotransporter (NKCC1/slc12a2) transcript levels and the re-emergence of seawater-type ionocytes detected through immunohistochemical NKA immunoreactivity in the gill, the central ionoregulatory organ.

The passive dissolution of anthropogenically produced CO2 into the ocean system is reducing ocean pH and changing a suite of chemical equilibria, with negative consequences for some marine organisms, in particular those that bear calcium carbonate shells. Although our monitoring of these chemical changes has improved, we have not developed effective tools to translate observations, which are typically of the pH and carbonate saturation state, into ecologically relevant predictions of biological risks. One potential solution is to develop bioindicators: biological variables with a clear relationship to environmental risk factors that can be used for assessment and management. Thecosomatous pteropods are a group of pelagic shelled marine gastropods, whose biological responses to CO2 have been suggested as potential bioindicators of ocean acidification owing to their sensitivity to acidification in both the laboratory and the natural environment. Using five CO2 exposure experiments, occurring across four seasons and running for up to 15 days, we describe a consistent relationship between saturation state, shell transparency and duration of exposure, as well as identify a suite of genes that could be used for biological monitoring with further study. We clarify variations in thecosome responses due to seasonality, resolving prior uncertainties and demonstrating the range of their phenotypic plasticity. These biomarkers of acidification stress can be implemented into ecosystem models and monitoring programmes in regions where pteropods are found, whilst the approach will serve as an example for other regions on how to bridge the gap between point-based chemical monitoring and biologically relevant assessments of ecosystem health.",2024,12,1,NA
Energetic costs increase with faster heating in an aquatic ectotherm,"Harding, Lucy and Jackson, Andrew L. and Payne, Nicholas",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coad042,"We show that rate of temperature change has a systematic effect on the oxygen consumption of ectotherms and that as temperature increases more rapidly, the rate of oxygen consumption increases. These findings have implications for how we predict ectotherm responses to climate change, for example heat waves. The thermal sensitivity of metabolism is widely studied due to its perceived importance for organismal fitness and resilience to future climate change. Almost all such studies estimate metabolism at a variety of constant temperatures, with very little work exploring how metabolism varies during temperature change. However, temperature in nature is rarely static, so our existing understanding from experiments may not reflect how temperature influences metabolism in natural systems. Using closed-chamber respirometry, we estimated the aerobic metabolic rate of an aquatic ectotherm, the Atlantic ditch shrimp Palaemonetes varians, under varying thermal conditions. We continuously measured oxygen consumption of shrimp during heating, cooling and constant temperatures, starting trials at a range of acclimation temperatures and exposing shrimp to a variety of rates of temperature change. In a broad sense, cumulative oxygen consumption estimated from static temperature exposures corresponded to estimates derived from ramping experiments. However, further analyses showed that oxygen consumption increases for both faster heating and faster cooling, with rapid heating driving higher metabolic rates than if shrimp were warmed slowly. These results suggest a systematic influence of heating rate on the thermal sensitivity of metabolism. With influential concepts such as the metabolic theory of ecology founded in data from constant temperature experiments, our results encourage further exploration of how variable temperature impacts organism energetics, and to test the generality of our findings across species. This is especially important given climate forecasts of heat waves that are characterised by both increased temperatures and faster rates of change.",2023,11,1,NA

Here, we examine whether physiological trait differences observed at the interspecific level are also applicable to assemblages. We focus on the Collembola, an important component of the soil fauna characterized by invasions globally, and five traits related to fitness: critical thermal maximum, minimum and range, desiccation resistance and egg development rate. We test the predictions that the alien component of a local assemblage has greater basal physiological tolerances or higher rates, and more pronounced phenotypic plasticity than the indigenous component. Basal critical thermal maximum, thermal tolerance range, desiccation resistance, optimum temperature for egg development, the rate of development at that optimum and the upper temperature limiting egg hatching success are all significantly higher, on average, for the alien than the indigenous components of the assemblage. Outcomes for critical thermal minimum are variable. No significant differences in phenotypic plasticity exist between the alien and indigenous components of the assemblage. These results are consistent with previous interspecific studies investigating basal thermal tolerance limits and development rates and their phenotypic plasticity, in arthropods, but are inconsistent with results from previous work on desiccation resistance.

We investigated the relationships of the key germination traits of maximum germination (G(max)) and time to 50\% germination (t(50)) in response to temperature (5-35 degrees C) and water stress (-1.5-0 MPa) in four co-occurring Western Australian native Eucalyptus species with widely varying biogeography. Eucalyptus caesia subsp. caesia and E. ornata exhibit a highly localized distribution and a narrow geographical range, being restricted either to granite outcrops or the upper slopes and tops of lateritic rises, respectively. These two species were compared with the two widespread and dominant congenerics E. salmonophloia and E. salubris. There was a distinctive hump-shaped response of t(50) to temperature and an exponential response to water stress, characteristic of rate- and threshold-limited processes, but no consistent pattern in the response of G(max). The four species were significantly different in their thermal performance of t(50), with E. caesia and E. ornata displaying narrower thermal tolerance ranges than the two widespread species. In terms of mean final germination percentage, the two range-restricted endemic taxa exhibited higher lability in their response to thermal stress and drought stress compared to the two broadly distributed congenerics. These findings indicate a link between distributional extent, temperature and water stress tolerance and may have implications for identifying ecological filters of rarity and endemism.",2020,8,NA,NA
Thermal ecological physiology of native and invasive frog species: do invaders perform better?,"Cortes, Pablo A. and Puschel, Hans and Acuna, Paz and Bartheld, Jose L. and Bozinovic, Francisco",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/cow056,"Biological invasions are recognized as an important biotic component of global change that threatens the composition, structure and functioning of ecosystems, resulting in loss of biodiversity and displacement of native species. Although ecological characteristics facilitating the establishment and spread of non-native species are widely recognized, little is known about organismal attributes underlying invasion success. In this study, we tested the effect of thermal acclimation on thermal tolerance and locomotor performance in the invasive Xenopus laevis and the Chilean native Calyptocephalella gayi. In particular, the maximal righting performance (mu(MAX)), optimal temperature (T-O), lower (CTmin) and upper critical thermal limits (CTmax), thermal breadth (T-br) and the area under the performance curve (AUC) were studied after 6 weeks acclimation to 10 and 20 degrees C. We observed higher values of mu(max) and AUC in X. laevis in comparison to C. gayi. On the contrary, the invasive species showed lower values of CTmin in comparison to the native one. In contrast, CTmax, T-O and T-br showed no interspecific differences. Moreover, we found that both species have the ability to acclimate their locomotor performance and lower thermal tolerance limit at low temperatures. Our results demonstrate that X. laevis is a better performer than C. gayi. Although there were differences in CTmin, the invasive and native frogs did not differ in their thermal tolerance. Interestingly, in both species the lower and upper critical thermal limits are beyond the minimal and maximal temperatures encountered in nature during the coldest and hottest month, respectively. Overall, our findings suggest that both X. laevis and C. gayi would be resilient to climate warming expectations in Chile.",2016,4,NA,NA
Population variability in thermal performance of pre-spawning adult Chinook salmon,"Van Wert, Jacey C. and Hendriks, Brian and Ekstrom, Andreas and Patterson, David A. and Cooke, Steven J. and Hinch, Scott G. and Eliason, Erika J.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coad022,"Climate change is causing large declines in many Pacific salmon populations. In particular, warm rivers are associated with high levels of premature mortality in migrating adults. The Fraser River watershed in British Columbia, Canada, supports some of the largest Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) runs in the world. However, the Fraser River is warming at a rate that threatens these populations at critical freshwater life stages. A growing body of literature suggests salmonids are locally adapted to their thermal migratory experience, and thus, population-specific thermal performance information can aid in management decisions. We compared the thermal performance of pre-spawning adult Chinook salmon from two populations, a coastal fall-run from the Chilliwack River (125 km cooler migration) and an interior summer-run from the Shuswap River (565 km warmer migration). We acutely exposed fish to temperatures reflecting current (12 degrees C, 18 degrees C) and future projected temperatures (21 degrees C, 24 degrees C) in the Fraser River and assessed survival, aerobic capacity (resting and maximum metabolic rates, absolute aerobic scope (AAS), muscle and ventricle citrate synthase), anaerobic capacity (muscle and ventricle lactate dehydrogenase) and recovery capacity (post-exercise metabolism, blood physiology, tissue lactate). Chilliwack Chinook salmon performed worse at high temperatures, indicated by elevated mortality, reduced breadth in AAS, enhanced plasma lactate and potassium levels and elevated tissue lactate concentrations compared with Shuswap Chinook salmon. At water temperatures exceeding the upper pejus temperatures (T-pejus, defined here as 80\% of maximum AAS) of Chilliwack (18.7 degrees C) and Shuswap (20.2 degrees C) Chinook salmon populations, physiological performance will decline and affect migration and survival to spawn. Our results reveal population differences in pre-spawning Chinook salmon performance across scales of biological organization at ecologically relevant temperatures. Given the rapid warming of rivers, we show that it is critical to consider the intra-specific variation in thermal physiology to assist in the conservation and management of Pacific salmon. Warming water temperatures threaten aquatic species and impact economies and cultures. Yet, vulnerability can vary within a species. We assessed the thermal performance of two populations of pre-spawning adult Chinook salmon and found that an interior summer-run population of Chinook salmon performed better at warmer temperatures than a coastal fall-run population. Current river temperatures already exceed the functional warming tolerances of both populations and highlight the value of physiological studies in supporting management decisions.",2023,11,1,NA
The heat is on: sensitivity of goldsinny wrasse to global climate change,"Perry, Diana and Tamarit, Elena and Morgenroth, Daniel and Grans, Albin and Sturve, Joachim and Gullstrom, Martin and Thor, Peter and Wennhage, Hakan",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coae068,"Unsustainable harvesting practices have drastically reduced fish populations globally and developments in aquaculture have increased. Unexpectedly, Atlantic salmon farming caused the opening of a new fishery in northern European countries, where previously unharvested mesopredatory species, like the goldsinny wrasse (Ctenolabrus rupestris), are captured for use as cleaner fish in pens along the coast and fjords. The goldsinny wrasse is widespread in coastal areas where it plays an ecologically important role as a predator of small invertebrates. Since climate change effects are particularly pronounced in coastal waters, it becomes urgent to understand how fish like the goldsinny will respond to global climate change, including the increasing frequency and intensity of marine heatwaves (MHWs), ocean freshening (OF) and ocean acidification (OA). To address this, we conducted a multi-stressor experiment exposing adult goldsinny to each stressor individually, as well as to all three combined. The results indicated that the goldsinny is highly affected by MHWs and extremely sensitive to a multi-stressor environment, with 34\% and 53\% mortality, respectively. Additionally, exposure to a MHW event, OF and multi-stressor conditions affected fish metabolism, with the highest standard metabolic- and maximum metabolic-oxygen consumption rates observed for the MHW treatment. Increases in oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and percent oxidized glutathione (\% GSSG) in the livers, indicative of oxidative stress, were also seen in the MHW, OF and multi-stressor treatments. As a single stressor, OA showed no significant impacts on the measured parameters. This information is important for conservation of coastal marine environments, given the species' important role in shallow-water habitats and for management of goldsinny or other mesopredatory fish harvested in coastal ecosystems. The sensitivity of the goldsinny wrasse to future stressors is of concern, and any potential reductions in abundance as a result of climate change may lead to cascade effects with ecosystem-wide consequences. Our findings show clear evidence of physiological stress on fish caused from exposure to global climate change, with marine heatwaves and the cumulative effects of multiple stressors leading to substantial mortality (potentially over 50\%) for the ecologically important goldsinny wrasse.",2024,12,1,NA

Despite the immediate survival benefits, catch-and-release results in capture stress, particularly at high water temperatures, and this can result in delayed post-release mortality minutes to days later. The objective of this study was to evaluate how different water temperatures influenced heart rate disturbance and recovery of wild sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) following fisheries interactions (i.e. exhaustive exercise). Heart rate loggers were implanted into Fraser River sockeye salmon prior to simulated catch-and-release events conducted at three water temperatures (16 degrees C, 19 degrees C and 21 degrees C). The fisheries simulation involved chasing logger-implanted fish in tanks for 3 min, followed by a 1 min air exposure. Neither resting nor routine heart rate differed among temperature treatments. In response to the fisheries simulation, peak heart rate increased with temperature (16 degrees C = 91.3 +/- 1.3 beats min(-1); 19 degrees C = 104.9 +/- 2.0 beats min(-1) and 21 degrees C = 117 +/- 1.3 beats min(-1)). Factorial heart rate and scope for heart rate were highest at 21 degrees C and lowest at 16 degrees C, but did not differ between 19 degrees C and 21 degrees C. Temperature affected the initial rate of cardiac recovery but not the overall duration (similar to 10 h) such that the rate of energy expenditure during recovery increased with temperature. These findings support the notion that in the face of climate change, efforts to reduce stress at warmer temperatures will be necessary if catch-and-release practices are to be an effective conservation strategy.",2017,5,NA,NA
Increased wave action promotes muscle performance but increasing temperatures cause a tenacity-endurance trade-off in intertidal snails (<i>Nerita atramentosa</i>),"Clayman, Samuel and Seebacher, Frank",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coz039,"Concurrent increases in wave action and sea surface temperatures increase the physical impact on intertidal organisms and affect their physiological capacity to respond to that impact. Our aim was to determine whether wave exposure altered muscle function in intertidal snails (Nerita atramentosa) and whether responses to wave action and temperature are plastic, leading to compensation for altered environmental conditions. We show that field snails from exposed shores had greater endurance and vertical tenacity than snails from matched protected shores (n=5 pairs of shores). There were no differences in muscle metabolic capacities (strombine/lactate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase and cytochrome c oxidase activities) between shore types. Maximum stress (force/foot area) produced by isolated foot muscle did not differ between shore types, but foot muscle from snails on exposed shores had greater endurance. A laboratory experiment showed that vertical tenacity was greater in animals acclimated for 3 weeks to cool winter temperatures (15 C) compared to summer temperatures (25 C), but endurance was greater in snails acclimated to 25 degrees C. Acclimation to water flow that mimicked wave action in the field increased vertical tenacity but decreased endurance. Our data show that increased wave action elicits a training effect on muscle, but that increasing sea surface temperature can cause a trade-off between tenacity and endurance. Ocean warming would negate the beneficial increase in tenacity that could render snails more resistant to acute impacts of wave action, while promoting longer term resistance to dislodgment by waves.",2019,7,NA,NA
Endocrine and metabolic impacts of warming aquatic habitats: differential responses between recently isolated populations of a eurythermal desert pupfish,"Lema, Sean C. and Chow, Michelle I. and Resner, Emily J. and Westman, Alex A. and May, Darran and Dittman, Andrew H. and Hardy, Kristin M.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/cow047,"Temperatures of inland aquatic habitats are increasing with climate change, and understanding how fishes respond physiologically to thermal stress will be crucial for identifying species most susceptible to these changes. Desert fishes may be particularly vulnerable to rising temperatures because many species occupy only a fraction of their historical range and occur in habitats with already high temperatures. Here, we examined endocrine and metabolic responses to elevated temperature in Amargosa pupfish, Cyprinodon nevadensis amargosae. We studied C. n. amargosae from two habitats with distinct thermal conditions: the Amargosa River, which experiences diurnally and seasonally variable temperatures (0.2-40 degrees C); and Tecopa Bore, a spring and marsh fed by hot groundwater (47.5 degrees C) from an artesian borehole. These allopatric populations differ in morphology, and prior evidence suggests that temperature might contribute to these differences via altered thyroid hormone (TH) regulation of morphological development. Here, we document variation in hepatic iodothyronine deiodinase type 2 (dio2) and type 3 (dio3) and TH receptor beta (tr beta) gene transcript abundance between the Amargosa River and Tecopa Bore wild populations. Fish from these populations acclimated to 24 or 34 degrees C retained differences in hepatic dio2, dio3 and tr beta mRNAs and also varied in transcripts encoding the TH membrane transporters monocarboxylate transporter 8 (mct8) and organic anion-transporting protein 1c1 (oatp1c1). Tecopa Bore pupfish also exhibited higher dio2 and tr beta mRNA levels in skeletal muscle relative to Amargosa River fish. Muscle citrate synthase activity was lower at 34 degrees C for both populations, whereas lactate dehydrogenase activity and lactate dehydrogenase A-chain (ldhA) transcripts were both higher and 3,5,3'-triiodothryonine responsive in Tecopa Bore pupfish only. These findings reveal that local population variation and thermal experience interact to shape how pupfish respond to elevated temperatures, and point to the need to consider such interactions in management actions for desert fishes under a changing climate.",2016,4,NA,NA

Water temperature and sex were the factors that best predicted 24 and 48 h survival, with females in the warmest temperature group experiencing the greatest mortality. Capture-release treatment including air exposure was associated with equilibrium loss and depressed ventilation rates at release; the probability of fish surviving for 24 h after simulated capture-release was >50\% if the duration of equilibrium loss was <2 min or ventilation frequency was >1 breath s(-1). Higher haematocrit and plasma lactate as well as lower mean cell haemoglobin concentration and plasma sodium and chloride 30 min after simulated capture-release were also significant predictors of 24 h survival. Together, the results demonstrate that simple observations that are consistent with physiological disturbance can be used as predictors for post-release short-term survival for sockeye salmon. The markedly higher post-stressor mortality observed in females demonstrates that managers should consider sex-specific variation in response to different fisheries interactions, particularly in the face of climate change.",2014,2,1,NA
Seasonal and environmental effects on upper thermal limits of eastern sand darter (<i>Ammocrypta pellucida</i>),"Firth, Britney L. and Drake, D. Andrew R. and Power, Michael",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coab057,"Anthropogenic stressors are predicted to increase water temperature, which can influence physiological, individual, and population processes in fishes. We assessed the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) of eastern sand darter (Ammocrypta pellucida), a small benthic fish listed as threatened under the Species at Risk Act in Canada. Field trials were conducted stream side June-November 2019 in the Grand River, Ontario, to encompass a range of ambient water temperatures (7-25.C) for which agitation temperature (T-ag) and CTmax were determined. Additional measures were taken in the comparatively more turbid Thames River to test the effect of turbidity on both measures. In the Grand, T-ag and CTmax ranged from 23 degrees C to 33 degrees C and 27 degrees C to 37 degrees C, respectively, and both significantly increased with ambient water temperature, with a high acclimation response ratio (0.49). The thermal safety margin (difference between ambient temperatures and CTmax) was smallest in July and August (similar to 11 degrees C) indicating that eastern sand darter lives closer to its physiological limit in summer. The between-river comparison indicated that turbidity had no significant influence on T-ag and CTmax. Comparison of CTmax with in-river temperatures suggested that mean stream temperature 24 hours before the trial was most important for determining CTmax. Fish mass, temperature variance and maximum temperature in the 24-hour period prior to the CTmax trialwere also shown to have some effect on determining CTmax. Overall, study results better define the sensitivity of eastern sand darter to temperature changes across the growing season and provide information to assess the availability of suitable thermal habitat for conservation purposes.",2021,9,NA,NA

In a 90 day laboratory experiment, we exposed post-spawning adult blue mussels (M. edulis) from Atlantic Canada to three pCO(2) levels (pCO(2) similar to 625, 1295 and 2440 mu atm) at two different temperatures (16 degrees C and 22 degrees C) and assessed energetic reserves on Day 90, byssal attachment strength on Days 30 and 60, and condition index and mortality on Days 30, 60 and 90. Results indicated that glycogen content was negatively affected under elevated temperature, but protein, lipid, and overall energy content were unaffected. Reduced glycogen content under elevated temperature was associated with reduced condition index, reduced byssal thread attachment strength, and increased mortality; elevated pCO(2) had no effects. Overall, these results suggest that the glycogen reserves of post-spawning adult M. edulis are sensitive to elevated temperature, and can result in reduced health and byssal attachment strength, leading to increased mortality. These results are similar to those reported for pre-spawning mussels and suggest that post-spawning blue mussels are tolerant to elevated pCO(2) and sensitive to elevated temperature. In contrast to previous studies, however, elevated pCO(2) did not affect byssus strength, suggesting that negative effects of elevated pCO(2) on byssus strength are not universal.",2018,6,NA,NA

Due to non-random targeting of individuals and high rates of mortality, commercial fishing can produce particularly strong selective pressures. Although numerous studies have documented the evolutionary impacts of fishing, little is known about the combined effects of environmental change and fishing-associated selection on physiological and behavioural traits. Here, using zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model organism in a scaled-down trawl fishery, we show that capture rate increases by similar to 7-fold under hypoxic conditions (35\% air saturation) as compared to fishing innormoxia. Additionally, the repeatability of both capture vulnerability and swimming performance decreases considerably, suggesting that oxygen availability can affect selection on particular traits. The increase in capture vulnerability is accompanied by a decrease in swimming performance (as indicated by critical swimming speed) during exposure to hypoxia, suggesting a functional link between these two integrative phenotypic traits. We observed no strong relationship between capture vulnerability and metabolic variables (standard metabolic rate and maximum metabolic rate). Our findings highlight that prevailing environmental conditions can influence harvest-associated selectivity by influencing trait repeatability and altering among individual trait variation.

Physiological effects of heat stress on Hawaiian picture-wing <i>Drosophila</i>: genome-wide expression patterns and stress-related traits,"Uy, Karen L. and LeDuc, R. and Ganote, C. and Price, Donald K.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/cou062,"Climate change is compounding the threats to the future of biodiversity, already impacted by habitat loss, invasive species and diseases. In the Hawaiian Islands, many of the endemic species have narrow habitat ranges that make them especially vulnerable to climate change. The Hawaiian Drosophila, a remarkably diverse group of species with 11 listed as federally endangered, are thought to be sensitive to temperature changes. To examine the species differences in sensitivity of Hawaiian picture-wing Drosophila to temperature changes, wild populations of Drosophila sproati, a relatively common species, and Drosophila silvestris, a rare species, were collected from two locations on Hawaii Island and bred in common laboratory conditions. Adult flies were exposed to hot and cold temperatures and compared with adult flies at control temperatures. Drosophila silvestris adults were less tolerant to heat stress than D. sproati for both survival and sperm mobility. In contrast, D. silvestris adults were more tolerant to cold stress than D. sproati for adult survival. The expression of 4950 Gene Ontology annotated gene transcripts was also analysed in high-temperature-treated and control males to identify candidate genes related to heat tolerance. There were more than twice as many transcripts differentially expressed after high temperature treatment for D. silvestris (246 transcripts) as for D. sproati (106 transcripts), with 13 Gene Ontology terms enriched between temperatures for D. silvestris and merely three in D. sproati. The combined results are consistent with D. sproati occurring more widely today as well as occurring at lower elevations than D. silvestris and with a genetically based temperature response, which is more severe in D. silvestris at high temperatures than that in D. sproati. These experiments demonstrate the potential for different capacities of species to adapt to future climate change conditions as well as providing an explanation for historical changes in the distribution of species.",2015,3,NA,NA

Identifying refugia with thermally resistant corals and understanding their thermal adaptation strategy is therefore urgent to guide conservation actions. The Gulf of Aqaba (GoA, northern Red Sea) is considered a climate refuge, hosting corals that may originate from populations selected for thermal resistance in the warmer waters of the Gulf of Tadjoura (GoT, entrance to the Red Sea and 2000 km south of the GoA). To better understand the thermal adaptation strategy of GoA corals, we compared the temperature optima (T-opt) of six common reef-building coral species from the GoA and the GoT by measuring oxygen production and consumption rates as well as photophysiological performance (i.e. chlorophyll fluorescence) in response to a short heat stress. Most species displayed similar T-opt between the two locations, highlighting an exceptional continuity in their respective physiological performances across such a large latitudinal range, supporting the GoA refuge theory. Stylophora pistillata showed a significantly lower T-opt in the GoA, which may suggest an ongoing population-level selection (i.e. adaptation) to the cooler waters of the GoA and subsequent loss of thermal resistance. Interestingly, all T-opt were significantly above the local maximum monthly mean seawater temperatures in the GoA (27.1 degrees C) and close or below in the GoT (30.9 degrees C), indicating that GoA corals, unlike those in the GoT, may survive ocean warming in the next few decades. Finally, Acropora muricata and Porites lobata displayed higher photophysiological performance than most species, which may translate to dominance in local reef communities under future thermal scenarios. Overall, this study is the first to compare the T-opt of common reef-building coral species over such a latitudinal range and provides insights into their thermal adaptation in the Red Sea.",2022,10,1,NA
The effects of thermal acclimation on cardio-respiratory performance in an Antarctic fish (<i>Notothenia coriiceps</i>),"Joyce, William and Axelsson, Michael and Egginton, Stuart and Farrell, Anthony P. and Crockett, Elizabeth L. and O'Brien, Kristin M.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coy069,"The Southern Ocean has experienced stable, cold temperatures for over 10 million years, yet particular regions are currently undergoing rapid warming. To investigate the impacts of warming on cardiovascular oxygen transport, we compared the cardio-respiratory performance in an Antarctic notothenioid (Notothenia coriiceps) that was maintained at 0 or 5 degrees C for 6.0-9.5 weeks. When compared at the fish's respective acclimation temperature, the oxygen consumption rate and cardiac output were significantly higher in 5 degrees C-acclimated than 0 degrees C-acclimated fish. The 2.7-fold elevation in cardiac output in 5 degrees C-acclimated fish (17.4 vs. 6.5 ml min(-1) kg(-1)) was predominantly due to a doubling of stroke volume, likely in response to increased cardiac preload, as measured by higher central venous pressure (0.15 vs. 0.08 kPa); tachycardia was minor (295 vs. 25.2 beats min(-1)). When fish were acutely warmed, oxygen consumption rate increased by similar amounts in 0 degrees C- and 5 degrees C-acclimated fish at equivalent test temperatures. In both acclimation groups, the increases in oxygen consumption rate during acute heating were supported by increased cardiac output achieved by elevating heart rate, while stroke volume changed relatively little. Cardiac output was similar between both acclimation groups until 12 degrees C when cardiac output became significantly higher in 5 degrees C-acclimated fish, driven largely by their higher stroke volume. Although cardiac arrhythmias developed at a similar temperature (similar to 14.5 degrees C) in both acclimation groups, the hearts of 5 degrees C-acclimated fish continued to pump until significantly higher temperatures (CTmax for cardiac function 17.7 vs. 15.0 degrees C for 0 degrees C-acclimated fish). These results demonstrate that N. coriiceps is capable of increasing routine cardiac output during both acute and chronic warming, although the mechanisms are different (heart rate-dependent versus primarily stroke volume-dependent regulation, respectively). Cardiac performance was enhanced at higher temperatures following 5 degrees C acclimation, suggesting cardiovascular function may not constrain the capacity of N. coriiceps to withstand a warming climate.",2018,6,NA,NA

Semi-arid southern California and the relatively mesic environments of California's Channel Islands provide a model system for examining drought responses of plants in potential climate change refugia. Most methods for detecting refugia are focused on `exposure' of organisms to certain abiotic conditions, which fail to assess how local adaptation or acclimation of plant traits (i.e. `sensitivity') contribute to or offset the benefits of reduced exposure. Here, we use a comparative plant hydraulics approach to characterize the vulnerability of plants to drought, providing a framework for identifying the locations and trait patterns that underlie functioning climate change refugia. Seasonal water relations, xylem hydraulic traits and remotely sensed vegetation indices of matched island and mainland field sites were used to compare the response of native plants from contrasting island and mainland sites to hotter droughts in the early 21st century. Island plants experienced more favorable water relations and resilience to recent drought. However, island plants displayed lowplasticity/adaptation of hydraulic traits to local conditions, which indicates that relatively conserved traits of island plants underlie greater hydraulic safety and localized buffering from regional drought conditions.

However, little is known about the basic biology/physiology of this skate, or how it may respond to future environmental challenges predicted from climate change and/or increases in human activities such as aquaculture. These skate live at a preferred depth of 5-15 m where the dissolved oxygen (DO) levels are moderate (similar to 55\% air saturation), but can be found in areas of the Harbour whereDOcan range from100\% saturation to anoxia. Given that the water at their preferred depth is already hypoxic, we sought to investigate their response to further decreases in DO that may arise from potential increases in anthropogenic stress. We measured oxygen consumption, haematological parameters, tissue and enzyme capacity and heat shock protein (HSP) levels in skate exposed to 55\% dissolved O-2 saturation (control) and 20\% dissolved O-2 saturation (hypoxic) for 48 h. We conclude that the Maugean skate appears to be an oxyconformer, with a decrease in the rate of O-2 consumption with increasing hypoxia. Increases in blood glucose and lactate at 20\% O-2 suggest that skate are relying more on anaerobic metabolism to tolerate periods of very low oxygen. Despite these metabolic shifts, there was no difference in HSP70 levels between groups, suggesting this short-term exposure did not elicit a cellular stress response. The metabolic state of the skate suggests that low oxygen stress for longer periods of time (i.e.>48 h) may not be tolerable and could potentially result in loss of habitat or shifts in their preferred habitat. Given its endemic distribution and limited life-history information, it will be critical to understand its tolerance to environmental challenges to create robust conservation strategies.",2020,8,NA,NA
Effects of post-capture ventilation assistance and elevated water temperature on sockeye salmon in a simulated capture-and-release experiment,"Robinson, Kendra A. and Hinch, Scott G. and Gale, Marika K. and Clark, Timothy D. and Wilson, Samantha M. and Donaldson, Michael R. and Farrell, Anthony P. and Cooke, Steven J. and Patterson, David A.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/cot015,"The live release of wild adult Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) following capture is a management tactic often used in commercial, aboriginal, and recreational fisheries. Fisheries capture and handling can be both exhausting and stressful to fish, which can limit their ability to swim and survive after release. As a result, researchers have assessed methods intended to improve post-release survival by assisting the flow of water over the gills of fish prior to release. Such approaches use recovery bags or boxes that direct water over the gills of restrained fish. This study evaluated a method of assisting ventilation that mimics one often employed by recreational anglers (i.e. holding fish facing into a current). Under laboratory conditions, wild Fraser River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) either received manual ventilation assistance for 1 min using a jet of water focused at the mouth or were left to recover unassisted following a capture-and-release simulation. A control group consisted of fish that were not exposed to the simulation or ventilation assistance. The experiment was conducted at 16 and 21 degrees C, average and peak summer water temperatures for the Fraser River, and fish survival was monitored for 33 days. At 21 degrees C, all fish perished within 3 days after treatment in all experimental groups, highlighting the consequences of handling adult sockeye salmon during elevated migration temperatures. Survival was higher at 16 degrees C, with fish surviving on average 15-20 days after treatment. At 16 degrees C, the capture-and-release simulation and ventilation assistance did not affect the survival of males; however, female survival was poor after the ventilation assistance compared with the unassisted and control groups. Our results suggest that the method of ventilation assistance tested in this study may not enhance the post-release survival of adult Fraser River sockeye salmon migrating in fresh water.",2013,1,1,NA

J.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coab016,"Adult female Pacific salmon can have higher migration mortality rates than males, particularly at warm temperatures. However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain a mystery. Given the importance of swimming energetics on fitness, we measured critical swim speed, swimming metabolism, cost of transport, aerobic scope (absolute and factorial) and exercise recovery in adult female and male coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) held for 2 days at 3 environmentally relevant temperatures (9 degrees C, 14 degrees C, 18 degrees C) in fresh water. Critical swimming performance (U-crit) was equivalent between sexes and maximal at 14 degrees C. Absolute aerobic scope was sex- and temperature-independent, whereas factorial aerobic scope decreased with increasing temperature in both sexes. The full cost of recovery from exhaustive exercise (excess post-exercise oxygen consumption) was higher in males compared to females. Immediately following exhaustive exercise (i.e. 1 h), recovery was impaired at 18 degrees C for both sexes. At an intermediate time scale (i.e. 5 h), recovery in males was compromised at 14 degrees C and 18 degrees C compared to females. Overall, swimming, aerobic metabolism, and recovery energetics do not appear to explain the phenomenon of increased mortality rates in female coho salmon. However, our results suggest that warming temperatures compromise recovery following exhaustive exercise in both male and female salmon, which may delay migration progression and could contribute to en route mortality.",2021,9,NA,NA
Reproductive gene expression in a coral reef fish exposed to increasing temperature across generations,"Veilleux, Heather D. and Donelson, Jennifer M. and Munday, Philip L.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/cox077,"Reproduction in marine fish is generally tightly linked with water temperature. Consequently, when adults are exposed to projected future ocean temperatures, reproductive output of many species declines precipitously. Recent research has shown that in the common reef fish, Acanthochromis polyacanthus, step-wise exposure to higher temperatures over two generations (parents: +1.5 degrees C, offspring: +3.0 degrees C) can improve reproductive output in the F2 generation compared to F2 fish that have experienced the same high temperatures over two generations (F1 parents: +3.0 degrees C, F2 offspring: +3.0 degrees C). To investigate how a step-wise increase in temperature between generations improved reproductive capacity, we tested the expression of well-known teleost reproductive genes in the brain and gonads of F2 fish using quantitative reverse transcription PCR and compared it among control (+0.0 degrees C for two generations), developmental (+3.0 degrees C in second generation only), step (+1.5 degrees C in first generation and +3.0 degrees C in second generation), and transgenerational (+3.0 degrees C for two generations) treatments. We found that levels of gonadotropin receptor gene expression (Fshr and Lhcgr) in the testes were reduced in developmental and transgenerational temperature treatments, but were similar to control levels in the step treatment. This suggests Fshr and Lhcgr may be involved in regulating male reproductive capacity in A. polyacanthus. In addition, lower Fshb expression in the brain of females in all temperature treatments compared to control, suggests that Fshb expression, which is involved in vitellogenesis, is sensitive to high temperatures. Our results help elucidate key genes that facilitate successful reproduction in reef fishes when they experience a gradual increase in temperature across generations consistent with the trajectory of climate change.",2018,6,NA,NA
The effects of marine heatwaves on a coral reef snapper: insights into aerobic and anaerobic physiology and recovery,"McMahon, Shannon J. and Munday, Philip L. and Donelson, Jennifer M.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coae060,"Marine heatwaves (MHW) are intensifying, posing a grave threat to coral reefs. We exposed a coral reef mesopredator, Lutjanus carponotatus, to MWH conditions (+1 degrees C and +2 degrees C) for 4 weeks and found increased oxygen consumption, recovery time, haemoglobin, and lactate. Interestingly, several effects persisted for at least 2 weeks post-MWH. Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are increasing in frequency and intensity. Coral reefs are particularly susceptible to MHWs, which cause mass coral bleaching and mortality. However, little is known about how MHWs affect coral reef fishes. Here, we investigated how MHWs affect the physiology of a coral reef mesopredator, Lutjanus carponotatus. Specifically, we exposed mature adults to two different MHW intensities, +1 degrees C (29.5 degrees C) and + 2 degrees C (30.5 degrees C) and measured physiological performance at 2 and 4 weeks of exposure and at 2 weeks post-exposure. At these time points, we measured oxygen consumption at rest and after a simulated fishing capture event, recovery time, excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) and associated biochemical markers in the blood (baseline lactate, post-capture lactate, glucose, haemoglobin levels and haematocrit proportion). We found that 2 weeks of exposure to MHW conditions increased resting oxygen consumption (+1 degrees C = 23\%, +2 degrees C = 37\%), recovery time (+1 degrees C = 62\%, +2 degrees C = 77\%), EPOC (+1 degrees C = 50\%, +2 degrees C = 68\%), baseline lactate (+1 degrees C = 27\%, +2 degrees C = 28\%), post-capture lactate (+1 degrees C = 62\%, +2 degrees C = 109\%) and haemoglobin levels (+1 degrees C = 13\%, +2 degrees C = 28\%). This pattern was maintained at 4 weeks of exposure except for post-capture lactate which was reduced (+1 degrees C = -37\%, +2 degrees C = 27\%). In combination, these results suggest a greater reliance on anaerobic glycolysis to maintain homeostasis in MHW conditions. At 2 weeks post-exposure, when compared to control fish, we found that capture oxygen consumption was increased (+1 degrees C = 25\%, +2 degrees C = 26\%), recovery rate was increased (+2 degrees C = 38\%) and haemoglobin was still higher (+1 degrees C = 15\%, +2 degrees C = 21\%). These results show that MHW conditions have direct physiological demands on adult coral reef snapper and ecologically relevant residual effects can last for at least 2 weeks post-MHW; however, individuals appear to recover from the negative effects experienced during the MHW. This provides new insight into the effects of MHWs on the physiological performance of coral reef fishes.",2024,12,1,NA
Conservation of thermal physiology in tropical intertidal snails following an evolutionary transition to a cooler ecosystem: climate change implications,"Marshall, David J. and Mustapha, Nurshahida and Monaco, Cristian J.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coad056,"Predictions for animal responses to climate warming usually assume that thermal physiology is adapted to present-day environments, and seldom consider the influence of evolutionary background. Little is known about the conservation of warm-adapted physiology following an evolutionary transition to a cooler environment. We used cardiac thermal performance curves (cTPCs) of six neritid gastropod species to study physiological thermal trait variation associated with a lineage transition from warmer rocky shores to cooler mangroves. We distinguished between functional thermal performance traits, related to energy homeostasis (slope gradient, slope curvature, HRmax, maximum cardiac activity and T-opt, the temperature that maximizes cardiac activity) and a trait that limits performance (ULT, the upper lethal temperature). Considering the theory of optimal thermal performance, we predicted that the functional traits should be under greater selective pressure to change directionally and in magnitude than the thermal limit, which is redundant in the cooler environment. We found little variation in all traits across species, habitats and ecosystems, despite a similar to 20 degrees C reduction in maximum habitat temperature in the mangrove species over 50 million years. While slope gradient was significantly lowered in the mangrove species, the effect difference was negated by greater thermal plasticity in the rocky shore species. ULT showed the least variation and suggested thermal specialization in the warmest habitat studied. The observed muted variation of the functional traits among the species may be explained by their limited role in energy acquisition and rather their association with heat tolerance adaptation, which is redundant in the mangrove species. These findings have implications for the conservation of habitat of intertidal gastropods that transition to cooler environments. Furthermore, they highlight the significance of evolutionary history and physiological conservation when predicting species responses to climate change.",2023,11,1,NA
Intraspecific individual variation of temperature tolerance associated with oxygen demand in the European sea bass (<i>Dicentrarchus labrax</i>),"Ozolina, Karlina and Shiels, Holly A. and Ollivier, Helene and Claireaux, Guy",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/cov060,"The European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) is an economically important fish native to the Mediterranean and Northern Atlantic. Its complex life cycle involves many migrations through temperature gradients that affect the energetic demands of swimming. Previous studies have shown large intraspecific variation in swimming performance and temperature tolerance, which could include deleterious and advantageous traits under the evolutionary pressure of climate change. However, little is known of the underlying determinants of this individual variation. We investigated individual variation in temperature tolerance in 30 sea bass by exposing them to a warm temperature challenge test. The eight most temperature-tolerant and eight most temperature-sensitive fish were then studied further to determine maximal swimming speed (U-CAT), aerobic scope and post-exercise oxygen consumption. Finally, ventricular contractility in each group was determined using isometric muscle preparations. The temperature-tolerant fish showed lower resting oxygen consumption rates, possessed larger hearts and initially recovered from exhaustive exercise faster than the temperature-sensitive fish. Thus, whole-animal temperature tolerance was associated with important performance traits. However, the temperature-tolerant fish also demonstrated poorer maximal swimming capacity (i.e. lower UCAT) than their temperature-sensitive counterparts, which may indicate a trade-off between temperature tolerance and swimming performance. Interestingly, the larger relative ventricular mass of the temperature-tolerant fish did not equate to greater ventricular contractility, suggesting that larger stroke volumes, rather than greater contractile strength, may be associated with thermal tolerance in this species.",2016,4,NA,NA
Neotropical stingless bees display a strong response in cold tolerance with changes in elevation,"Gonzalez, Victor H. and Oyen, Kennan and Vitale, Nydia and Ospina, Rodulfo",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coac073,"Tropical pollinators are expected to experience substantial effects due to climate change, but aspects of their thermal biology remain largely unknown. We investigated the thermal tolerance of stingless honey-making bees, the most ecologically, economically and culturally important group of tropical pollinators. We assessed changes in the lower (CTMin) and upper (CTMax) critical thermal limits of 17 species (12 genera) at two elevations (200 and 1500 m) in the Colombian Andes. In addition, we examined the influence of body size (intertegular distance, ITD), hairiness (thoracic hair length) and coloration (lightness value) on bees' thermal tolerance. Because stingless beekeepers often relocate their colonies across the altitudinal gradient, as an initial attempt to explore potential social responses to climatic variability, we also tracked for several weeks brood temperature and humidity in nests of three species at both elevations. We found that CTMin decreased with elevation while CTMax was similar between elevations. CTMin and CTMax increased (low cold tolerance and high heat tolerance) with increasing ITD, hair length and lightness value, but these relationships were weak and explained at most 10\% of the variance. Neither CTMin nor CTMax displayed significant phylogenetic signal. Brood nest temperature tracked ambient diel variations more closely in the low-elevation site, but it was constant and higher at the high-elevation site. In contrast, brood nest humidity was uniform throughout the day regardless of elevation. The stronger response in CTMin, and a similar CTMax between elevations, follows a pattern of variation documented across a wide range of taxa that is commonly known as the Brett's heat-invariant hypothesis. Our results indicate differential thermal sensitivities and potential thermal adaptations to local climate, which support ongoing conservation policies to restrict the long-distance relocations of colonies. They also shed light on how malleable nest thermoregulation can be across elevations.",2022,10,1,NA
Will ocean acidification affect the early ontogeny of a tropical oviparous elasmobranch (<i>Hemiscyllium ocellatum</i>)?,"Johnson, Martijn S. and Kraver, Daniel W. and Renshaw, Gillian M. C. and Rummer, Jodie L.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/cow003,"Atmospheric CO2 is increasing due to anthropogenic causes. Approximately 30\% of this CO2 is being absorbed by the oceans and is causing ocean acidification (OA). The effects of OA on calcifying organisms are starting to be understood, but less is known about the effects on non-calcifying organisms, notably elasmobranchs. One of the few elasmobranch species that has been studied with respect to OA is the epaulette shark, Hemiscyllium ocellatum. Mature epaulette sharks can physiologically and behaviourally tolerate prolonged exposure to elevated CO2, and this is thought to be because they are routinely exposed to diurnal decreases in O-2 and probably concomitant increases in CO2 in their coral reef habitats. It follows that H. ocellatum embryos, while developing in ovo on the reefs, would have to be equally if not more tolerant than adults because they would not be able to escape such conditions. Epaulette shark eggs were exposed to either present-day control conditions (420 mu atm) or elevated CO2 (945 mu atm) and observed every 3 days from 10 days post-fertilization until 30 days post-hatching. Growth (in square centimetres per day), yolk usage (as a percentage), tail oscillations (per minute), gill movements (per minute) and survival were not significantly different in embryos reared in control conditions when compared with those reared in elevated CO2 conditions. Overall, these findings emphasize the importance of investigating early life-history stages, as the consequences are expected to transfer not only to the success of an individual but also to populations and their distribution patterns.",2016,4,NA,NA
Low desiccation and thermal tolerance constrains a terrestrial amphibian to a rare and disappearing microclimate niche,"Hoffmann, Emily P. and Cavanough, Karen L. and Mitchell, Nicola J.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coab027,"Drier and hotter conditions caused by climate change threaten species that exist close to their physiological limits, as well as those with limited ability tomove. Habitat specialists may also be particularly vulnerable if they have specific abiotic requirements. Here we assess whether thermal and hydric constraints can explain the highly restricted and declining distributions of the critically endangered terrestrial-breeding frog, Geocrinia alba. We also evaluate the species' vulnerability to climate change based on the similarity of current microclimatic conditions to their physiological limits. We found that G. alba had low thresholds of thermal and desiccation tolerance relative to other anuran species. The estimated thermal optimum (T-opt) and critical thermal maxima (CTmax) were 23.3 degrees C and 29.6 degrees C, respectively, and adult frogs had an absorption threshold (AT, the lowest water potential at which water can be absorbed from a substrate) of -50 kPa, the lowest recorded for an amphibian. Comparing environmental conditions and water loss in the field using agar models showed that riparian habitats where frogs occur provide a unique microclimate in the landscape, offering significantly lower desiccation risk during extreme summer conditions compared to immediately adjacent riparian and terrestrial habitats. Monitoring of microclimate conditions within occupied frog habitats over 2 years showed that in extreme dry and hot years the AT was exceeded at six of eight sites, and T-opt was exceeded at two of eight sites. Given their specific physiological limits, the apparent rarity of suitable microclimates and a regional drying-warming trend, we suggest that G. alba occupies a potentially disappearing niche and may be indicative of other habitat specialists that rely on ephemeral drainages. More broadly, this study highlights that desiccation thresholdsmay tightly constrain amphibian distributions and need to be considered along with thermal tolerance thresholds when predicting the impacts of climate change.",2021,9,NA,NA
Impact of Ocean Acidification and Warming on the bioenergetics of developing eggs of Atlantic herring <i>Clupea harengus</i>,"Leo, Elettra and Dahlke, Flemming T. and Storch, Daniela and Poertner, Hans-O and Mark, Felix C.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coy050,"Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) is a benthic spawner, therefore its eggs are prone to encounter different water conditions during embryonic development, with bottom waters often depleted of oxygen and enriched in CO2. Some Atlantic herring spawning grounds are predicted to be highly affected by ongoing Ocean Acidification and Warming with water temperature increasing by up to +3 degrees C and CO2 levels reaching ca. 1000 mu atm (RCP 8.5). Although many studies investigated the effects of high levels of CO2 on the embryonic development of Atlantic herring, little is known about the combination of temperature and ecologically relevant levels of CO2. In this study, we investigated the effects of Ocean Acidification and Warming on embryonic metabolic and developmental performance such as mitochondrial function, respiration, hatching success (HS) and growth in Atlantic herring from the Oslo Fjord, one of the spawning grounds predicted to be greatly affected by climate change. Fertilized eggs were incubated under combinations of two PCO2 conditions (400 mu atm and 1100 mu atm) and three temperatures (6, 10 and 14 degrees C), which correspond to current and end-of-the-century conditions. We analysed HS, oxygen consumption (MO2) and mitochondrial function of embryos as well as larval length at hatch. The capacity of the electron transport system (ETS) increased with temperature, reaching a plateau at 14 degrees C, where the contribution of Complex I to the ETS declined in favour of Complex II. This relative shift was coupled with a dramatic increase in MO2 at 14 degrees C. HS was high under ambient spawning conditions (6-10 degrees C), but decreased at 14 degrees C and hatched larvae at this temperature were smaller. Elevated PCO(2 )increased larval malformations, indicating sub-lethal effects. These results indicate that energetic limitations due to thermally affected mitochondria and higher energy demand for maintenance occur at the expense of embryonic development and growth.",2018,6,NA,NA
Behavioural and physiological responses to salinization and air exposure during the ontogeny of a freshwater South American snail,"Barrios-Figueroa, R. and Urbina, M. A.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coac089,"Salinization is of global concern, threatening freshwater biodiversity. Salinity tolerance is highly variable and therefore needs to be evaluated on a species-specific basis. An estuarine population of Chilina dombeiana, a freshwater gastropod endemic to Chile and classified as vulnerable, has been recently found in the Biobio River's mouth, suggesting some degree of tolerance to brackish waters. This study evaluated the survival, behaviour (medium preference) and physiology of C. dombeiana when exposed to salinities higher than freshwater, thus elucidating the potential mechanisms used to survive salinization. Chilina dombeiana belongs to the Pulmonate group;, so we evaluated oxygen uptake in air and water, aiming to evaluate emersion as a potential avoidance response to a progressive salinity increase. Complete embryo development was observed for salinities <= 16 PSU (practical salinity units) but hatching rates above 50\% were only achieved in freshwater (0 PSU). It was also found that salinity had stage-specific effects during embryonic development. In adults, acute exposure to brackish water (12 PSU) caused a decrease in oxygen consumption (compared to freshwater), in the ammonium excretion rates and in the percentage of muscular water content. Although C. dombeiana was able to take up oxygen in both mediums, survival in air decreased over time (days), which correlates with the behavioural preference to remain submerged, even at elevated salinities. Considering the survival of adults and embryos decreased as salinity increased and the lack of an avoidance behaviour or a physiological ability to maintain homeostasis at salinities higher than freshwater, our results suggest this snail could be adversely affected by salinization in the long term. Furthermore, given the ability of C. dombeiana to uptake oxygen in both mediums, it should be considered as a facultative air breather snail, rather than a strictly aquatic species.",2023,11,1,NA
Ocean acidification exerts negative effects during warming conditions in a developing Antarctic fish,"Flynn, Erin E. and Bjelde, Brittany E. and Miller, Nathan A. and Todgham, Anne E.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/cov033,"Anthropogenic CO2 is rapidly causing oceans to become warmer and more acidic, challenging marine ectotherms to respond to simultaneous changes in their environment. While recent work has highlighted that marine fishes, particularly during early development, can be vulnerable to ocean acidification, we lack an understanding of how life-history strategies, ecosystems and concurrent ocean warming interplay with interspecific susceptibility. To address the effects of multiple ocean changes on cold-adapted, slowly developing fishes, we investigated the interactive effects of elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) and temperature on the embryonic physiology of an Antarctic dragonfish (Gymnodraco acuticeps), with protracted embryogenesis (similar to 10 months). Using an integrative, experimental approach, our research examined the impacts of near-future warming {[}-1 (ambient) and 2 degrees C (+3 degrees C)] and ocean acidification {[}420 (ambient), 650 (moderate) and 1000 mu atm pCO(2) (high)] on survival, development and metabolic processes over the course of 3 weeks in early development. In the presence of increased pCO(2) alone, embryonic mortality did not increase, with greatest overall survival at the highest pCO(2). Furthermore, embryos were significantly more likely to be at a later developmental stage at high pCO(2) by 3 weeks relative to ambient pCO(2). However, in combined warming and ocean acidification scenarios, dragonfish embryos experienced a dose-dependent, synergistic decrease in survival and developed more slowly. We also found significant interactions between temperature, pCO(2) and time in aerobic enzyme activity (citrate synthase). Increased temperature alone increased whole-organism metabolic rate (O-2 consumption) and developmental rate and slightly decreased osmolality at the cost of increased mortality. Our findings suggest that developing dragonfish are more sensitive to ocean warming and may experience negative physiological effects of ocean acidification only in the presence of an increased temperature. In addition to reduced hatching success, alterations in development and metabolism due to ocean warming and acidification could have negative ecological consequences owing to changes in phenology (i.e. early hatching) in the highly seasonal Antarctic ecosystem.",2015,3,NA,NA

Despite 50+ years of population monitoring, the efficacy of 10+ years of conservation efforts for longfin smelt remain uncertain due to a limited understanding of how the species responds to environmental variation, such as salinity. For example, high mortality during larval stages has prevented culture efforts from closing the life cycle in captivity. Here, we investigated the effects of salinity on longfin smelt yolk-sac larvae. Newly hatched larvae from four single-pair crosses were acutely transferred to and reared at salinities of 0.4, 5, 10, 20 or 32 ppt. We compared whole-body water and sodium ion (Na+) content, notochord length and yolk-sac volume at 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours post-transfer for each salinity treatment. We found that larvae maintained osmotic and ionic balance at 0.4-10 ppt, whereas salinities >10 ppt resulted in decreased water and increased whole-body Na content. We also found that larvae grew largest and survived the longest when reared at 5 and 10 ppt, respectively, and that yolk resorption stalled at 0.4 ppt. Finally, there were significant but small interclutch variations in responses to different salinities, with clutch accounting for <8\% of the variance in our statistical models. Overall, our results indicate that longfin smelt yolk-sac larvae likely perform best at moderately brackish conditions, thus yielding a mechanism that explains their distribution in field surveys and providing key information for future conservation efforts.",2022,10,1,NA
High sensitivity of a keystone forage fish to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and temperature,"Murray, Christopher S. and Wiley, David and Baumann, Hannes",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coz084,"Sand lances of the genus Ammodytes are keystone forage fish in coastal ecosystems across the northern hemisphere. Because they directly support populations of higher trophic organisms such as whales, seabirds or tuna, the current lack of empirical data and, therefore, understanding about the climate sensitivity of sand lances represent a serious knowledge gap. Sand lances could be particularly susceptible to ocean warming and acidification because, in contrast to other tested fish species, they reproduce during boreal winter months, and their offspring develop slowly under relatively low and stable pCO(2) conditions. Over the course of 2 years, we conducted factorial pCO(2) x temperature exposure experiments on offspring of the northern sand lance Ammodytes dubius, a key forage species on the northwest Atlantic shelf. Wild, spawning-ripe adults were collected fromStellwagen BankNational Marine Sanctuary (CapeCod, USA), and fertilizedembryoswere reared at three pCO(2) conditions (400, 1000 and 2100 mu atm) crossed with three temperatures (5, 7 and 10 degrees C). Exposure to future pCO(2) conditions consistently resulted in severely reduced embryo survival. Sensitivity to elevated pCO(2) was highest at 10 degrees C, resulting in up to an 89\% reduction in hatching success between control and predicted end-of-century pCO(2) conditions. Moreover, elevated pCO(2) conditions delayed hatching, reduced remaining endogenous energy reserves at hatch and reduced embryonic growth. Our results suggest that the northern sand lance is exceptionally CO2-sensitive compared to other fish species. Whether other sand lance species with similar life history characteristics are equally CO2-sensitive is currently unknown. But the possibility is a conservation concern, because many boreal shelf ecosystems rely on sand lances and might therefore be more vulnerable to climate change than currently recognized. Our findings indicate that life history, spawning habitat, phenology and developmental rates mediate the divergent early life CO2 sensitivities among fish species.",2019,7,NA,NA
Progressive hypoxia decouples activity and aerobic performance of skate embryos,"Di Santo, Valentina and Tran, Anna H. and Svendsen, Jon C.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/cov067,"Although fish population size is strongly affected by survival during embryonic stages, our understanding of physiological responses to environmental stressors is based primarily on studies of post-hatch fishes. Embryonic responses to acute exposure to changes in abiotic conditions, including increase in hypoxia, could be particularly important in species exhibiting long developmental time, as embryos are unable to select a different environment behaviourally. Given that oxygen is key to metabolic processes in fishes and aquatic hypoxia is becoming more severe and frequent worldwide, organisms are expected to reduce their aerobic performance. Here, we examined the metabolic and behavioural responses of embryos of a benthic elasmobranch fish, the little skate (Leucoraja erinacea), to acute progressive hypoxia, by measuring oxygen consumption and movement (tail-beat) rates inside the egg case. Oxygen consumption rates were not significantly affected by ambient oxygen levels until reaching 45\% air saturation (critical oxygen saturation, S-crit). Below S-crit, oxygen consumption rates declined rapidly, revealing an oxygen conformity response. Surprisingly, we observed a decoupling of aerobic performance and activity, as tail-beat rates increased, rather than matching the declining metabolic rates, at air saturation levels of 55\% and below. These results suggest a significantly divergent response at the physiological and behavioural levels. While skate embryos depressed their metabolic rates in response to progressive hypoxia, they increased water circulation inside the egg case, presumably to restore normoxic conditions, until activity ceased abruptly around 9.8\% air saturation.",2016,4,NA,NA
Combined effects of warming and hypoxia on early life stage Chinook salmon physiology and development,"Del Rio, Annelise M. and Davis, Brittany E. and Fangue, Nann A. and Todgham, Anne E.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coy078,"Early life stages of salmonids are particularly vulnerable to warming and hypoxia, which are common stressors in hyporheic, gravel bed, rearing habitat (i.e. a redd'). With the progression of global climate change, high temperatures and hypoxia may co-occur more frequently within redds, particularly for salmonid species at their southern range limit. Warming and hypoxia have competing effects on energy supply and demand, which can be detrimental to energy-limited early life stages. We examined how elevated temperature and hypoxia as individual and combined stressors affected the survival, physiological performance, growth, and development of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). We reared late fall-run Chinook salmon from fertilization to the fry stage in a fully factorial design of two temperatures {[}10 degrees C (ambient) and 14 degrees C (warm)] and two oxygen levels {[}normoxia (100\% air saturation, 10 mg O-2/l) and hypoxia (50\% saturation, 5.5 mg O-2/l)]. Rearing in hypoxia significantly reduced hatching success, especially in combination with warming. Both warming and hypoxia improved acute thermal tolerance. While rearing in hypoxia improved tolerance to acute hypoxia stress, warming reduced hypoxia tolerance. Hypoxia-reared fish were smaller at hatch, but were able to reach similar sizes to the normoxia-reared fish by the fry stage. High temperature and normoxia resulted in the fastest rate of development while low temperature and hypoxia resulted in the slowest rate of development. Despite improved physiological tolerance to acute heat and hypoxia stress, hypoxia-reared embryos had reduced survival and growth, which could have larger population-level effects. These results suggest that both warming and hypoxia are important factors to address in conservation strategies for Chinook salmon.",2019,7,NA,NA
Identification of upper thermal thresholds during development in the endangered Nechako white sturgeon with management implications for a regulated river,"Earhart, Madison L. and Blanchard, Tessa S. and Morrison, Phillip R. and Strowbridge, Nicholas and Penman, Rachael J. and Brauner, Colin J. and Schulte, Patricia M. and Baker, Daniel W.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coad032,"Climate change-induced warming effects are already evident in river ecosystems, and projected increases in temperature will continue to amplify stress on fish communities. In addition, many rivers globally are impacted by dams, which have many negative effects on fishes by altering flow, blocking fish passage, and changing sediment composition. However, in some systems, dams present an opportunity to manage river temperature through regulated releases of cooler water. For example, there is a government mandate for Kenney dam operators in the Nechako river, British Columbia, Canada, to maintain river temperature <20 degrees C in July and August to protect migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). However, there is another endangered fish species inhabiting the same river, Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and it is unclear if these current temperature regulations, or timing of the regulations, are suitable for spawning and developing sturgeon. In this study, we aimed to identify upper thermal thresholds in white sturgeon embryos and larvae to investigate if exposure to current river temperatures are playing a role in recruitment failure. We incubated embryos and yolk-sac larvae in three environmentally relevant temperatures (14, 18 and 21 degrees C) throughout development to identify thermal thresholds across different levels of biological organization. Our results demonstrate upper thermal thresholds at 21 degrees C across physiological measurements in embryo and yolk-sac larvae white sturgeon. Before hatch, both embryo survival and metabolic rate were reduced at 21 degrees C. After hatch, sublethal consequences continued at 21 degrees C because larval sturgeon had decreased thermal plasticity and a dampened transcriptional response during development. In recent years, the Nechako river has reached 21 degrees C by the end of June, and at this temperature, a decrease in sturgeon performance is evident in most of the traits measured. As such, the thermal thresholds identified here suggest current temperature regulations may not be suitable for developing white sturgeon and future recruitment.",2023,11,1,NA

As expected, family and temperature variables were most important for predicting RMR and body mass, although population-level differences also existed when family was excluded for more detailed analysis. Additionally, body mass strongly influenced RMR at all life stages except for eyed embryos. When family identity was removed from the analysis, population became the most significant variable. Variation in RMR and mass within and among populations may indicate existing adaptive potential within and among brook trout populations to respond to predicted warming under climate change scenarios.",2018,6,NA,NA

Differential sensitivity to warming and hypoxia during development and long-term effects of developmental exposure in early life stage Chinook salmon,"Del Rio, Annelise M. and Mukai, Gabriella N. and Martin, Benjamin T. and Johnson, Rachel C. and Fangue, Nann A. and Israel, Joshua A. and Todgham, Anne E.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coab054,"Warming and hypoxia are two stressors commonly found within natural salmon redds that are likely to co-occur. Warming and hypoxia can interact physiologically, but their combined effects during fish development remain poorly studied, particularly stage-specific effects and potential carry-over effects. To test the impacts ofwarmwater temperature and hypoxia as individual and combined developmental stressors, late fall-run Chinook salmon embryos were reared in 10 treatments from fertilization through hatching with two temperatures [}10 degrees C (ambient) and 14 degrees C (warm)], two dissolved oxygen saturation levels {[}normoxia (100\% air saturation, 10.4-11.4 mg O-2/l) and hypoxia (50\% saturation, 5.5 mg O-2/l)] and three exposure times (early {[}eyed stage], late {[}silver-eyed stage] and chronic [}fertilization through hatching]). After hatching, all treatments were transferred to control conditions (10 degrees C and 100\% air saturation) through the fry stage. To study stage-specific effects of stressor exposure we measured routine metabolic rate (RMR) at two embryonic stages, hatching success and growth. To evaluate carry-over effects, where conditions during one life stage influence performance in a later stage, RMR of all treatments was measured in control conditions at two post-hatch stages and acute stress tolerance was measured at the fry stage. We found evidence of stage-specific effects of both stressors during exposure and carry- over effects on physiological performance. Both individual stressors affected RMR, growth and developmental rate while multiple stressors late in development reduced hatching success. RMR post-hatch showed persistent effects of embryonic stressor exposure that may underlie differences observed in developmental timing and acute stress tolerance. The responses to stressors that varied by stage during development suggest that stage-specific management efforts could support salmon embryo survival. The persistent carry-over effects also indicate that considering sub-lethal effects of developmental stressor exposure may be important to understanding how climate change influences the performance of salmon across life stages.",2021,9,NA,NA
Effects of ocean acidification on embryonic respiration and development of a temperate wrasse living along a natural CO<sub>2</sub> gradient,"Cattano, Carlo and Giomi, Folco and Milazzo, Marco",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/cov073,"Volcanic CO2 seeps provide opportunities to investigate the effects of ocean acidification on organisms in the wild. To understand the influence of increasing CO2 concentrations on the metabolic rate (oxygen consumption) and the development of ocellated wrasse early life stages, we ran two field experiments, collecting embryos from nesting sites with different partial pressures of CO2 {[}pCO(2); ambient (similar to 400 mu atm) and high (800-1000 mu atm)] and reciprocally transplanting embryos from ambient- to high-CO2 sites for 30 h. Ocellated wrasse offspring brooded in different CO2 conditions had similar responses, but after transplanting portions of nests to the high-CO2 site, embryos from parents that spawned in ambient conditions had higher metabolic rates. Although metabolic phenotypic plasticity may show a positive response to high CO2, it often comes at a cost, in this case as a smaller size at hatching. This can have adverse effects because smaller larvae often exhibit a lower survival in the wild. However, the adverse effects of increased CO2 on metabolism and development did not occur when embryos from the high-CO2 nesting site were exposed to ambient conditions, suggesting that offspring from the high-CO2 nesting site could be resilient to a wider range of pCO(2) values than those belonging to the site with present-day pCO(2) levels. Our study identifies a crucial need to increase the number of studies dealing with these processes under global change trajectories and to expand these to naturally high-CO2 environments, in order to assess further the adaptive plasticity mechanism that encompasses non-genetic inheritance (epigenetics) through parental exposure and other downstream consequences, such as survival of larvae.",2016,4,NA,NA

In this study, we evaluate the effects of future environmental warming (+ 2 degrees C) during the early ontogeny of the European sardine, Sardina pilchardus. Warming reduced the survival of 30-day-old larvae by half. Length at hatching increased with temperature as expected, but no significant effect was observed on the length and growth at 30 days post-hatching. Warming did not significantly affect the thermal tolerance of sardine larvae, even though the mean lethal temperature increased by 1 degrees C. In the warm conditions, sardine larvae showed signs of thermal stress, indicated by a pronounced increase in larval metabolism (Q(10) = 7.9) and a 45\% increase in the heat shock response. Lipid peroxidation was not significantly affected by the higher temperature, even though the mean value doubled. Warming did not affect the time larvae spent swimming, but decreased by 36\% the frequency of prey attacks.

Life cycle complexity and body mass drive erratic changes in climate vulnerability across ontogeny in a seasonally migrating butterfly,"Medina-Baez, Osmary A. and Lenard, Angie and Muzychuk, Rut A. and da Silva, Carmen R. B. and Diamond, Sarah E. E.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coad058,"Physiological traits are often used for vulnerability assessments of organismal responses to climate change. Trait values can change dramatically over the life cycle of organisms but are typically assessed at a single developmental stage. Reconciling ontogenetic changes in physiological traits with vulnerability assessments often reveals early life-stage vulnerabilities. The degree to which ontogenetic changes in physiological traits are due to changes in body mass over development versus stage-specific responses determines the degree to which mass can be used as a proxy for vulnerability. Here, we use the painted lady butterfly, Vanessa cardui, to test ontogenetic changes in two physiological traits, the acute thermal sensitivity of routine metabolic rate (RMR Q(10)) and the critical thermal maximum (CTmax). RMR Q(10) generally followed ontogenetic changes in body mass, with stages characterized by smaller body mass exhibiting lower acute thermal sensitivity. However, CTmax was largely decoupled from ontogenetic changes in body mass. In contrast with trends from other studies showing increasing vulnerability among progressively earlier developmental stages, our study revealed highly erratic patterns of vulnerability across ontogeny. Specifically, we found the lowest joint-trait vulnerability (both RMR Q(10) and CTmax) in the earliest developmental stage we tested (3rd instar larvae), the highest vulnerabilities in the next two developmental stages (4th and 5th instar larvae), and reduced vulnerability into the pupal and adult stages. Our study supports growing evidence of mechanistic decoupling of physiology across developmental stages and suggests that body mass is not a universal proxy for all physiological trait indicators of climate vulnerability.",2023,11,1,NA

Abnormally high seawater temperatures can lead to mass bleaching events and subsequent mortality, while ocean acidification may impact biomineralization processes. Despite its strong ecological and socio-economic importance, its responses to these threats still need to be explored. We investigated physiological responses of 4-year-old Tridacna maxima to realistic levels of temperature (+1.5 degrees C) and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) (+800 mu atm of CO2) predicted for 2100 in French Polynesian lagoons during the warmer season. During a 65-day crossed-factorial experiment, individuals were exposed to two temperatures (29.2 degrees C, 30.7 degrees C) and two pCO(2) (430 mu atm, 1212 mu atm) conditions. The impact of each environmental parameter and their potential synergetic effect were evaluated based on respiration, biomineralization and photophysiology. Kinetics of thermal and/or acidification stress were evaluated by performing measurements at different times of exposure (29, 41, 53, 65 days). At 30.7 degrees C, the holobiont O-2 production, symbiont photosynthetic yield and density were negatively impacted. High pCO(2) had a significant negative effect on shell growth rate, symbiont photosynthetic yield and density. No significant differences of the shell microstructure were observed between control and experimental conditions in the first 29 days; however, modifications (i.e. less-cohesive lamellae) appeared from 41 days in all temperature and pCO(2) conditions. No significant synergetic effect was found. Present thermal conditions (29.2 degrees C) appeared to be sufficiently stressful to induce a host acclimatization response. All these observations indicate that temperature and pCO(2) are both forcing variables affecting T. maxima's physiology and jeopardize its survival under environmental conditions predicted for the end of this century.",2021,9,NA,1-17
"Sensitivities of an endemic, endangered California smelt and two non-native fishes to serial increases in temperature and salinity: implications for shifting community structure with climate change","Davis, Brittany E. and Cocherell, Dennis E. and Sommer, Ted and Baxter, Randall D. and Hung, Tien-Chieh and Todgham, Anne E. and Fangue, Nann A.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coy076,"This study showed that in three quite different fish species from the San Francisco Estuary, stress from elevated temperature or salinity did not reduce their ability to cope with subsequent stressors. Abstract In many aquatic systems, native fishes are in decline and the factors responsible are often elusive. In the San Francisco Estuary (SFE) in California, interactions among native and non-native species are key factors contributing to the decline in abundance of endemic, endangered Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus). Climate change and drought-related stressors are further exacerbating declines. To assess how multiple environmental changes affect the physiology of native Delta Smelt and non-native Mississippi Silverside (Menidia beryllina) and Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides), fishes were exposed to serial exposures of a single stressor (elevated temperature or salinity) followed by two stressors (elevated temperature and salinity) to determine how a single stressor affects the capacity to cope with the addition of a second stressor. Critical thermal maximum (CTMax; a measure of upper temperature tolerance) was determined after 0, 2, 4 and 7 days following single and multiple stressors of elevated temperature (16 degrees C vs. 20 degrees C) and salinity (2.4 vs. 8-12 ppt, depending on species). Under control conditions, non-native fishes had significantly higher CTMax than the native Delta Smelt. An initial temperature or salinity stressor did not negatively affect the ability of any species to tolerate a subsequent multiple stressor. While elevated salinity had little effect on CTMax, a 4 degrees C increase in temperature increased CTMax. Bass experienced an additive effect of increased temperature and salinity on CTMax, such that CTMax further increased under multiple stressors. In addition, Bass demonstrated physiological sensitivity to multiple stressors demonstrated by changes in hematocrit and plasma osmolality, whereas the physiology of Silversides remained unaffected. Non-native Bass and Mississippi Silversides showed consistently higher thermal tolerance limits than the native Delta Smelt, supporting their abundance in warmer SFE habitats. Continued increases in SFE water temperatures predicted with climate change may further impact endangered Delta Smelt populations directly if habitat temperatures exceed thermal limits.",2019,7,NA,NA
"Combined stress of ocean acidification and warming influence survival and drives differential gene expression patterns in the Antarctic pteropod, <i>Limacina helicina antarctica</i>","Johnson, Kevin M. and Hofmann, Gretchen E.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coaa013,"The ecologically important thecosome pteropods in the Limacina spp. complex have recently been the focus of studies examining the impacts global change factors - e.g., ocean acidification (OA) and ocean warming (OW) - on their performance and physiology. This focus is driven by conservation concerns where the health of pteropod populations is threatened by the high susceptibility of their shells to dissolution in lowaragonite saturation states associated with OA and how coupling of these stressors may push pteropods past the limits of physiological plasticity. In this manipulation experiment, we describe changes in the transcriptome of the Antarctic pteropod, Limacina helicina antarctica, to these combined stressors. The conditions used in the laboratory treatments met or exceeded those projected for the Southern Ocean by the year 2100. We made two general observations regarding the outcome of the data: (1) Temperature was more influential than pH in terms of changing patterns of gene expression, and (2) these Antarctic pteropods appeared to have a significant degree of transcriptomic plasticity to respond to acute abiotic stress in the laboratory. In general, differential gene expression was observed amongst the treatments; here, for example, transcripts associated with maintaining protein structure and cell proliferation were up-regulated. To disentangle the effects of OA and OW, we used a weighted gene co-expression network analysis to explore patterns of change in the transcriptome. This approach identified gene networks associated with OW that were enriched for transcripts proposed to be involved in increasing membrane fluidity at warmer temperatures. Together these data provide evidence that L.h.antarctica has a limited capacity to acclimate to the combined conditions of OA and OW used in this study. This reduced scope of acclimation argues for continued study of how adaptation to polar aquatic environments may limit the plasticity of present-day populations in responding to future environmental change.",2020,8,NA,NA
Inter-population differences in salinity tolerance and osmoregulation of juvenile wild and hatchery-born Sacramento splittail,"Verhille, Christine E. and Dabruzzi, Theresa F. and Cocherell, Dennis E. and Mahardja, Brian and Feyrer, Frederick and Foin, TheodoreC. and Baerwald, Melinda R. and Fangue, Nann A.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/cov063,"The Sacramento splittail (Pogonichthys macrolepidotus) is a minnow endemic to the highly modified San Francisco Estuary of California, USA and its associated rivers and tributaries. This species is composed of two genetically distinct populations, which, according to field observations and otolith strontium signatures, show largely allopatric distribution patterns as recently hatched juveniles. Juvenile Central Valley splittail are found primarily in the nearly fresh waters of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers and their tributaries, whereas San Pablo juveniles are found in the typically higher-salinity waters (i.e. up to 10\%) of the Napa and Petaluma Rivers. As the large salinity differences between young-of-year habitats may indicate population-specific differences in salinity tolerance, we hypothesized that juvenile San Pablo and Central Valley splittail populations differ in their response to salinity. In hatchery-born and wild-caught juvenile San Pablo splittail, we found upper salinity tolerances, where mortalities occurred within 336 h of exposure to 16\% or higher, which was higher than the upper salinity tolerance of 14\% for wild-caught juvenile Central Valley splittail. This, in conjunction with slower recovery of plasma osmolality, but not ion levels, muscle moisture or gill Na+, K+-ATPase activity, in Central Valley relative to San Pablo splittail during osmoregulatory disturbance provides some support for our hypothesis of inter-population variation in salinity tolerance and osmoregulation. The modestly improved salinity tolerance of San Pablo splittail is consistent with its use of higher-salinity habitats. Although confirmation of the putative adaptive difference through further studies is recommended, this may highlight the need for population-specific management considerations.",2016,4,NA,NA
Variation in spawning time promotes genetic variability in population responses to environmental change in a marine fish,"Oomen, Rebekah A. and Hutchings, Jeffrey A.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/cov027,"The level of phenotypic plasticity displayed within a population (i.e. the slope of the reaction norm) reflects the short-term response of a population to environmental change, while variation in reaction norm slopes among populations reflects spatial variation in these responses. Thus far, studies of thermal reaction norm variation have focused on geographically driven adaptation among different latitudes, altitudes or habitats. Yet, thermal variability is a function of both space and time. For organisms that reproduce at different times of year, such variation has the potential to promote adaptive variability in thermal responses for critical early life stages. Using common-garden experiments, we examined the spatial scale of genetic variation in thermal plasticity for early life-history traits among five populations of endangered Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) that spawn at different times of year. Patterns of plasticity for larval growth and survival suggest that population responses to climate change will differ substantially, with increasing water temperatures posing a considerably greater threat to autumn-spawning cod than to those that spawn in winter or spring. Adaptation to seasonal cooling or warming experienced during the larval stage is suggested as a possible cause. Furthermore, populations that experience relatively cold temperatures during early life might be more sensitive to changes in temperature. Substantial divergence in adaptive traits was evident at a smaller spatial scale than has previously been shown for a marine fish with no apparent physical barriers to gene flow (similar to 200 km). Our findings highlight the need to consider the impact of intraspecific variation in reproductive timing on thermal adaptation when forecasting the effects of climate change on animal populations.",2015,3,NA,NA
"Physiological response and resilience of early life-stage Eastern oysters (<i>Crassostrea virginica</i>) to past, present and future ocean acidification","Gobler, Christopher J. and Talmage, Stephanie C.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/cou004,"The Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin, 1791), is the second most valuable bivalve fishery in the USA and is sensitive to high levels of partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)). Here we present experiments that comprehensively examined how the ocean's past, present and projected (21st and 22nd centuries) CO2 concentrations impact the growth and physiology of larval stages of C. virginica. Crassostrea virginica larvae grown in present-day pCO(2) concentrations (380 MU atm) displayed higher growth and survival than individuals grown at both lower (250 mu atm) and higher pCO(2) levels (750 and 1500 mu atm). Crassostrea virginica larvae manifested calcification rates, sizes, shell thicknesses, metamorphosis, RNA: DNA ratios and lipid contents that paralleled trends in survival, with maximal values for larvae grown at 380 mu atm pCO(2) and reduced performance in higher and lower pCO(2) levels. While some physiological differences among oysters could be attributed to CO2-induced changes in size or calcification rates, the RNA: DNA ratios at ambient pCO(2) levels were elevated, independent of these factors. Likewise, the lipid contents of individuals exposed to high pCO(2) levels were depressed even when differences in calcification rates were considered. These findings reveal the cascading, interdependent impact that high CO2 can have on oyster physiology. Crassostrea virginica larvae are significantly more resistant to elevated pCO(2) than other North Atlantic bivalves, such as Mercenaria mercenaria and Argopecten irradians, a finding that may be related to the biogeography and/or evolutionary history of these species and may have important implications for future bivalve restoration and aquaculture efforts.",2014,2,1,NA
Thermal tolerance of giant salmonfly nymphs (Pteronarcys californica) varies across populations in a regulated river,"Verhille, Christine E. and Macdonald, Michael and Noble, Ben and Demorest, Gavin and Roche, Alzada and Frazier, Kayleigh and Albertson, Lindsey K.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coae043,"Contrary to our prediction, salmonfly (Pteronarcys californica) nymphs originating from the warm extreme of a thermal gradient had a cooler metabolism-based optimal temperature range than nymphs originating from a cooler habitat. We posit that these local adjustments reflected the combination of thermal extremes and thermal variation experienced within the habitats. Warming of aquatic ecosystems is transforming the distribution, phenology and growth of the organisms dependent upon these ecosystems. Aquatic insects such as stoneflies are especially vulnerable to warming because the aquatic nymph stage of their life cycle depends on cool, well-oxygenated, flowing water habitat. We tracked thermal effects on available aerobic capacity of the aquatic nymph stage of an iconic and vulnerable stonefly species, the giant salmonfly (Pteronarcys californica), to compare habitat thermal regime measurements for two salmonfly populations from habitats separated by a gradient in summer weekly maximum temperatures. Contrary to expectations, the thermal optima range of the warmer habitat population was cooler than for the cooler habitat population. We posit that this unexpected interpopulation variation in thermal response is more strongly driven by diel and seasonal thermal variability than by the highest summer temperatures experienced within respective habitats. Additionally, we show that summer daily maximum temperatures could result in periodic limits in available aerobic capacity to support work of the warmer habitat nymphs and may be the mechanism underlying reduced abundance relative to the upstream cooler habitat population. Our findings provide insight into potential thermal and metabolic mechanisms that could regulate the success of ecological and culturally important aquatic insect species experiencing global change. We conclude that thermal regimes and thermal variation, not just mean and maximum temperatures, are critical drivers of aquatic insect responses to water temperatures.",2024,12,1,NA
Physiological resilience of pink salmon to naturally occurring ocean acidification,"Frommel, Andrea Y. and Carless, Justin and Hunt, V, Brian P. and Brauner, Colin J.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coaa059,"Pacific salmon stocks are in decline with climate change named as a contributing factor. The North Pacific coast of British Columbia is characterized by strong temporal and spatial heterogeneity in ocean conditions with upwelling events elevating CO2 levels up to 10-fold those of pre-industrial global averages. Early life stages of pink salmon have been shown to be affected by these CO2 levels, and juveniles naturally migrate through regions of high CO2 during the energetically costly phase of smoltification. To investigate the physiological response of out-migrating wild juvenile pink salmon to these naturally occurring elevated CO2 levels, we captured fish in Georgia Strait, British Columbia and transported them to a marine lab (Hakai Institute, Quadra Island) where fish were exposed to one of three CO2 levels (850, 1500 and 2000 mu atm CO2) for 2 weeks. At 1/2, 1 and 2 weeks of exposure, we measured their weight and length to calculate condition factor (Fulton's K), as well as haematocrit and plasma {[}Cl-]. At each of these times, two additional stressors were imposed (hypoxia and temperature) to provide further insight into their physiological condition. Juvenile pink salmon were largely robust to elevated CO2 concentrations up to 2000 mu atm CO2, with no mortality or change in condition factor over the 2-week exposure duration. After 1 week of exposure, temperature and hypoxia tolerance were significantly reduced in high CO2, an effect that did not persist to 2 weeks of exposure. Haematocrit was increased by 20\% after 2 weeks in the CO2 treatments relative to the initial measurements, while plasma {[}Cl-] was not significantly different. Taken together, these data indicate that juvenile pink salmon are quite resilient to naturally occurring high CO2 levels during their ocean outmigration.",2020,8,NA,NA
Early exposure to ultraviolet-B radiation decreases immune function later in life,"Ceccato, Emma and Cramp, Rebecca L. and Seebacher, Frank and Franklin, Craig E.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/cow037,"Amphibians have declined dramatically worldwide. Many of these declines are occurring in areas where no obvious anthropogenic stressors are present. It is proposed that in these areas, environmental factors such as elevated solar ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation could be responsible. Ultraviolet-B levels have increased in many parts of the world as a consequence of the anthropogenic destruction of the ozone layer. Amphibian tadpoles are particularly sensitive to the damaging effects of UV-B radiation, with exposure disrupting growth and fitness in many species. Given that UV-B can disrupt immune function in other animals, we tested the hypothesis that early UV-B exposure suppresses the immune responses of amphibian tadpoles and subsequent juvenile frogs. We exposed Limnodynastes peronii tadpoles to sublethal levels of UV-B radiation for 6 weeks after hatching, then examined indices of immune function in both the tadpoles and the subsequent metamorphs. There was no significant effect of UV-B on tadpole leucocyte counts or on their response to an acute antigen (phytohaemagglutinin) challenge. However, early UV-B exposure resulted in a significant reduction in both metamorph leucocyte abundance and their response to an acute phytohaemagglutinin challenge. These data demonstrate that early UV-B exposure can have carry-over effects on later life-history traits even if the applied stressor has no immediately discernible effect. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the effects of UV-B exposure on amphibian health and susceptibility to diseases such as chytridiomycosis.",2016,4,NA,NA
Compromised thermal tolerance of cardiovascular capacity in upstream migrating Arctic char and brown trout-are hot summers threatening migrating salmonids?,"Mottola, Giovanna and Kristensen, Torstein and Anttila, Katja",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coaa101,"Heat waves are threatening fish around the world, leading sometimes to mass mortality events. One crucial function of fish failing in high temperatures is oxygen delivery capacity, i.e. cardiovascular function. For anadromous salmonids, increased temperature could be especially detrimental during upstream migration since they need efficiently working oxygen delivery system in order to cross the river rapids to reach upstream areas. The migration also occurs during summer and early autumn exposing salmonids to peak water temperatures, and in shallow rivers there is little availability for thermal refuges as compared to thermally stratified coastal and lake habitats. In order to shed light on the mechanisms underpinning the capacity of migrating fish to face high environmental temperatures, we applied a physiological and molecular approach measuring cardiovascular capacities of migrating and resident Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) in Northern Norway. The maximum cardiovascular capacity of migrating fish was significantly lower compared to the resident conspecifics. The onset of cardiac impairment started only 2 degrees C higher than river temperature, meaning that even a small increase in water temperature may already compromise cardiac function. The migrating fish were also under significant cellular stress, expressing increased level of cardiac heat shock proteins. We consider these findings highly valuable when addressing climate change effect on migrating fish and encourage taking action in riverine habitat conservation policies. The significant differences in upper thermal tolerance of resident and migrating fish could also lead changes in population dynamics, which should be taken into account in future conservation plans.",2020,8,NA,NA
"Identification of supraoptimal temperatures in juvenile blueback herring (<i>Alosa aestivalis</i>) using survival, growth rate and scaled energy reserves","Guo, Lian W. and Jordaan, Adrian and Schultz, Eric T. and McCormick, Stephen D.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coac022,"We measured anadromous juvenile blueback herring survival, growth rate and energy reserves across temperatures 21-33 degrees C when fed a constant ration. Growth was more sensitive to warm temperatures than energy reserves. Survival remained high, yet smaller size at high temperatures may detrimentally delay emigration, increase predation and lower physiological resilience. For young fishes, growth of somatic tissues and energy reserves are critical steps for survival and progressing to subsequent life stages. When thermal regimes become supraoptimal, routine metabolic rates increase and leave less energy for young fish to maintain fitness-based activities and, in the case of anadromous fishes, less energy to prepare for emigration to coastal habitats. Thus, understanding how energy allocation strategies are affected by thermal regimes in young anadromous fish will help to inform climate-ready management of vulnerable species and their habitat. Blueback herring (Alosa aestivalis) are an anadromous fish species that remain at historically low population levels and are undergoing southern edge-range contraction, possibly due to climate change. We examined the effects of temperature (21 degrees C, 24 degrees C, 27 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 33 degrees C) on survival, growth rate and energy reserves of juveniles collected from the mid-geographic range of the species. We identified a strong negative relationship between temperature and growth rate, resulting in smaller juveniles at high temperatures. We observed reduced survival at both 21 degrees C and 33 degrees C, increased fat and lean mass-at-length at high temperatures, but no difference in energy density. Juveniles were both smaller and contained greater scaled energy reserves at higher temperatures, indicating growth in length is more sensitive to temperature than growth of energy reserves. Currently, mid-geographic range juvenile blueback herring populations may be well suited for local thermal regimes, but continued warming could decrease survival and growth rates. Blueback herring populations may benefit from mitigation actions that maximize juvenile energy resources by increasing the availability of cold refugia and food-rich habitats, as well as reducing other stressors such as hypoxic zones.",2022,10,1,NA
Temporal variability modulates pH impact on larval sea urchin development,"Chan, Kit Yu Karen and Tong, Chun Sang Daniel",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coaa008,"Coastal organisms reside in highly dynamic habitats. Global climate change is expected to alter not only the mean of the physical conditions experienced but also the frequencies and/or the magnitude of fluctuations of environmental factors. Understanding responses in an ecologically relevant context is essential for formulating management strategies. In particular, there are increasing suggestions that exposure to fluctuations could alleviate the impact of climate change-related stressors by selecting for plasticity that may help acclimatization to future conditions. However, it remains unclear whether the presence of fluctuations alone is sufficient to confer such effects or whether the pattern of the fluctuations matters. Therefore, we investigated the role of frequency and initial conditions of the fluctuations on performance by exposing larval sea urchin Heliocidaris crassispina to either constant or fluctuating pH. Reduced pH alone (pH 7.3 vs 8.0) did not affect larval mortality but reduced the growth of larval arms in the static pH treatments. Changes in morphology could affect the swimming mechanics for these small organisms, and geometric morphometric analysis further suggested an overall shape change such that acidified larvae had more U-shaped bodies and shorter arms, which would help maintain stability in moving water. The relative negative impact of lower pH, computed as log response ratio, on larval arm development was smaller when larvae were exposed to pH fluctuations, especially when the change was less frequent (48- vs 24-h cycle). Furthermore, larvae experiencing an initial pH drop, i.e. those where the cycle started at pH 8.0, were more negatively impacted compared with those kept at an initial pH of 7.3 before the cycling started. Our observations suggest that larval responses to climate change stress could not be easily predicted from mean conditions. Instead, to better predict organismal performance in the future ocean, monitoring and investigation of the role of real-time environmental fluctuations along the dispersive pathway is key.",2020,8,NA,NA

A mechanistic model based on Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory was developed to predict the combined effects of ocean warming, acidification and decreased food availability on growth and reproduction of three commercially important marine fish species: white seabream (Diplodus sargus), zebra seabream (Diplodus cervinus) and Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis). Model simulations used a parameter set for each species, estimated by the Add-my-Pet method using data from laboratory experiments complemented with bibliographic sources. An acidification stress factor was added as a modifier of the somatic maintenance costs and estimated for each species to quantify the effect of a decrease in pH from 8.0 to 7.4 (white seabream) or 7.7 (zebra seabream and Senegalese sole). The model was used to project total length of individuals along their usual lifespan and number of eggs produced by an adult individual within one year, under different climate change scenarios for the end of the 21st century. For the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change SSP5-8.5, ocean warming led to higher growth rates during the first years of development, as well as an increase of 32-34\% in egg production, for the three species. Ocean acidification contributed to reduced growth for white seabream and Senegalese sole and a small increase for zebra seabream, as well as a decrease in egg production of 48-52\% and 14-33\% for white seabream and Senegalese sole, respectively, and an increase of 4-5\% for zebra seabream. The combined effect of ocean warming and acidification is strongly dependent on the decrease of food availability, which leads to significant reduction in growth and egg production. This is the first study to assess the combined effects of ocean warming and acidification using DEB models on fish, therefore, further research is needed for a better understanding of these climate change-related effects among different taxonomic groups and species.",2022,10,1,NA
Dead tired: evaluating the physiological status and survival of neonatal reef sharks under stress,"Bouyoucos, Ian A. and Weideli, Ornella C. and Planes, Serge and Simpfendorfer, Colin A. and Rummer, Jodie L.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coy053,"Marine protected areas (MPAs) can protect shark populations from targeted fisheries, but resident shark populations may remain exposed to stressors like capture as bycatch and environmental change. Populations of young sharks that rely on shallow coastal habitats, e.g. as nursery areas, may be at risk of experiencing these stressors. The purpose of this study was to characterize various components of the physiological stress response of neonatal reef sharks following exposure to an exhaustive challenge under relevant environmental conditions. To accomplish this, we monitored markers of the secondary stress response and measured oxygen uptake rates (MO2) to compare to laboratory-derived baseline values in neonatal blacktip reef (Carcharhinus melanopterus) and sicklefin lemon sharks (Negaprion acutidens). Measurements occurred over three hours following exposure to an exhaustive challenge (gill-net capture with air exposure). Blood lactate concentrations and pH deviated from baseline values at the 3-h sample, indicating that both species were still stressed 3 h after capture. Evidence of a temperature effect on physiological status of either species was equivocal over 28-31 degrees C. However, aspects of the physiological response were species-specific; N. acutidens exhibited a larger difference in blood pH relative to baseline values than C. melanopterus, possibly owing to higher minimum MO2 . Neither species experienced immediate mortality during the exhaustive challenge; although, single instances of delayed mortality were documented for each species. Energetic costs and recovery times could be extrapolated for C. melanopterus via respirometry; sharks were estimated to expend 9.9 kJ kg(-1) (15\% of energy expended on daily swimming) for a single challenge and could require 8.4 h to recover. These data suggest that neonatal C. melanopterus and N. acutidens are resilient to brief gill-net capture durations, but this was under a narrow temperature range. Defining species' vulnerability to stressors is important for understanding the efficacy of shark conservation tools, including MPAs.",2018,6,NA,NA
Can the impacts of cold-water pollution on fish be mitigated by thermal plasticity?,"Parisi, M. A. and Cramp, R. L. and Gordos, M. A. and Franklin, C. E.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coaa005,"Increasingly, cold-water pollution (CWP) is being recognised as a significant threat to aquatic communities downstream of large, bottom-release dams. Cold water releases typically occur during summer when storage dams release unseasonably cold and anoxic hypolimnetic waters, which can decrease the temperature of downstream waters by up to 16 degrees C. Depending on the release duration, these hypothermic conditions can persist for many months. The capacity of ectothermic species to tolerate or rapidly adjust to acute temperature changes may determine the nature and magnitude of the impact of CWP on affected species. This study assessed the impacts of an acute reduction in water temperature on the physiological function and locomotor performance of juvenile silver perch (Bidyanus bidyanus) and examined their capacity to thermally compensate for the depressive effects of low temperatures via phenotypic plasticity. Locomotor performance (Ucrit and Usprint) and energetic costs (routine and maximum metabolic rate) were measured at multiple points over a 10-week period following an abrupt 10 degrees C drop in water temperature. We also measured the thermal sensitivity of metabolic enzymes from muscle samples taken from fish following the exposure period. Cold exposure had significant depressive effects on physiological traits, resulting in decreases in performance between 10\% and 55\%. Although there was partial acclimation of Ucrit (similar to 35\% increase in performance) and complete compensation of metabolic rate, this occurred late in the exposure period, meaning silver perch were unable to rapidly compensate for the depressive effects of thermal pollution. The results of this study have substantial implications for the management of cold water releases from large-scale dams and the conservation of native freshwater fish species, as this form of thermal pollution can act as a barrier to fish movement, cause reduced recruitment, ecological community shifts and disruptions to timing and success of reproduction.",2020,8,NA,NA
Thyroid hormone levels and temperature during development alter thermal tolerance and energetics of <i>Xenopus laevis</i> larvae,"Ruthsatz, Katharina and Dausmann, Kathrin H. and Peck, Myron A. and Drees, Claudia and Sabatino, Nikita M. and Becker, Laura I. and Reese, Janica and Hartmann, Lisa and Glos, Julian",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coy059,"Environmental variation induced by natural and anthropogenic processes including climate change may threaten species by causing environmental stress. Anuran larvae experiencing environmental stress may display altered thyroid hormone (TH) status with potential implications for physiological traits. Therefore, any capacity to adapt to environmental changes through plastic responses provides a key to determining species vulnerability to environmental variation. We investigated whether developmental temperature (T-dev ), altered TH levels and whether the interactive effect of both affect standard metabolic rate (SMR), body condition (BC), survival and thermal tolerance in larvae of the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) reared at five temperatures with experimentally altered TH levels. At metamorphosis, SMR, BC and survival were significantly affected by T-d(ev) , TH status and their interaction with the latter often intensified impacts. Larvae developing at warmer temperatures exhibited significantly higher SMRs and BC was reduced at warm T-d(ev) and high TH levels suggesting decreased ability to acclimate to variation in temperature. Accordingly, tadpoles that developed at warm temperatures had higher maximum thermal limits but more narrow thermal tolerance windows. High and low TH levels decreased and increased upper thermal limits, respectively. Thus, when experiencing both warmer temperatures and environmental stress, larvae may be less able to compensate for changes in T-d(ev) . Our results demonstrate that physiological traits in larvae of X. laevis are strongly affected by increased TH levels and warmer temperatures. Altered TH levels and increasing T-dev due to global change may result in a reduced capacity for physiological plasticity. This has far reaching consequences since the energetic requirement at the onset of metamorphosis is known to determine metamorphic success and thus, is indirectly linked to individual fitness in later life stages.",2018,6,NA,NA

To test the hypothesis that physiological status is altered by stress conditioning, we subjected juvenile Pacific geoduck, Panopea generosa, to repeated exposures of elevated pCO(2) in a commercial hatchery setting followed by a period in ambient common garden. Respiration rate and shell lengthwere measured for juvenile geoduck periodically throughout short-term repeated reciprocal exposure periods in ambient (similar to 550 mu atm) or elevated (similar to 2400 mu atm) pCO(2) treatments and in common, ambient conditions, 5 months after exposure. Short-term exposure periods comprised an initial 10-day exposure followed by 14 days in ambient before a secondary 6-day reciprocal exposure. The initial exposure to elevated pCO(2) significantly reduced respiration rate by 25\% relative to ambient conditions, but no effect on shell growth was detected. Following 14 days in common garden, ambient conditions, reciprocal exposure to elevated or ambient pCO(2) did not alter juvenile respiration rates, indicating ability for metabolic recovery under subsequent conditions. Shell growth was negatively affected during the reciprocal treatment in both exposure histories; however, clams exposed to the initial elevated pCO(2) showed compensatory growth with 5.8\% greater shell length (on average between the two secondary exposures) after 5 months in ambient conditions. Additionally, clams exposed to the secondary elevated pCO(2) showed 52.4\% increase in respiration rate after 5 months in ambient conditions. Early exposure to low pH appears to trigger carryover effects suggesting bioenergetic re-allocation facilitates growth compensation. Life stage-specific exposures to stress can determine when it may be especially detrimental, or advantageous, to apply stress conditioning for commercial production of this long-lived burrowing clam.",2020,8,NA,NA
Simultaneous exposure to nitrate and low pH reduces the blood oxygen-carrying capacity and functional performance of a freshwater fish,"Isaza, Daniel F. Gomez and Cramp, Rebecca L. and Franklin, Craig E.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coz092,"Human activities present aquatic species with numerous of environmental challenges, including excessive nutrient pollution (nitrate) and altered pH regimes (freshwater acidification). In isolation, elevated nitrate and acidic pH can lower the blood oxygen-carrying capacity of aquatic species and cause corresponding declines in key functional performance traits such as growth and locomotor capacity. These factors may pose considerable physiological challenges to organisms but little is known about their combined effects. To characterise the energetic and physiological consequences of simultaneous exposure to nitrate and lowpH, we exposed spangled perch (Leiopotherapon unicolor) to a combination of nitrate (0, 50 or 100 mg L-1) and pH (pH 7.0 or 4.0) treatments in a factorial experimental design. Blood oxygen-carrying capacity (haemoglobin concentration, methaemoglobin concentrations and oxygen equilibrium curves), aerobic scope and functional performance traits (growth, swimming performance and post-exercise recovery) were assessed after 28 days of exposure. The oxygen-carrying capacity of fish exposed to elevated nitrate (50 and 100 mg L-1) was compromised due to reductions in haematocrit, functional haemoglobin levels and a 3-fold increase in methaemoglobin concentrations. Oxygen uptake was also impeded due to a right shift in oxygen-haemoglobin binding curves of fish exposed to nitrate and pH 4.0 simultaneously. A reduced blood oxygen-carrying capacity translated to a lowered aerobic scope, and the functional performance of fish (growth and swimming performance and increased post-exercise recovery times) was compromised by the combined effects of nitrate and low pH. These results highlight the impacts on aquatic organisms living in environments threatened by excessive nitrate and acidic pH conditions.",2020,8,NA,NA
UV exposure causes energy trade- offs leading to increased chytrid fungus susceptibility in green tree frog larvae,"Cramp, Rebecca L. and Ohmer, Michel E. B. and Franklin, Craig E.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coac038,"Levels of ultraviolet (UV) radiation have increased in many parts of the world due to the anthropogenic destruction of the ozone layer. UV radiation is a potent immunosuppressant and can increase the susceptibility of animal hosts to pathogens. UV radiation can directly alter immune function via immunosuppression and photoimmunotolerance; however, UV may also influence pathogen defences by affecting the distribution of energy resources among competing physiological processes. Both defence against UV damage and repair of incurred damage, as well as the maintenance of immune defences and responding to an immune challenge, are energetically expensive. These competing demands for finite energy resources could trade off against one another, resulting in sub-optimal performance in one or both processes. We examined the potential for a disease-related energy trade-off in green tree frog (Litoria caerulea) larvae. Larvae were reared under high- or low-UV conditions for 12 weeks during which time we measured growth rates, metabolic rate and susceptibility to the amphibian fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). We found that larvae exposed to high levels of UV radiation had higher rates of energy expenditure than those exposed to low UV levels; however, UV exposure did not affect growth rates or developmental timings. Larvae exposed to high UV radiation also experienced greater Bd infection rates and carried a higher infection burden than those not exposed to elevated UV radiation. We propose that the increased energetic costs of responding to UV radiation were traded off against immune defences to protect larval growth rates. These findings have important implications for the aetiology of some Bd-associated amphibian declines, particularly in montane environments where Bd infections are most severe and where UV levels are highest.",2022,10,1,NA
Fine-scale conditions across mangrove microhabitats and larval ontogeny contributes to the thermal physiology of early stage brachyurans (Crustacea: Decapoda),"Vorsatz, L.

Recruitment of larvae into benthic habitats largely depends on biological interactions and favourable environmental conditions such as the inescapable diurnal thermal and tidal exposures. Hence, assessing how different taxa metabolically respond to variations in temperature is imperative to understand the community and ecosystem dynamics at both local and global scales. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of acute temperature variation on the physiology of stage-specific brachyuran larvae collected from different microhabitats at two mangrove forests in South Africa. Results indicate that the conditions within microhabitats, which larvae experience, likely influence their physiology, based on respirometry, to short-term acute temperature exposures. Furthermore, the larval thermal optimum shifted ontogenetically to become increasingly eurythermic as individuals developed from stage I zoea through to megalopa. Mangrove crab larvae in their early stages are hence increasingly vulnerable to acute temperature exposures, which could be particularly harmful to the persistence of populations if thermally stressful events increase in magnitude and frequency.",2021,9,NA,NA

Limited water resources necessitate human management of dam releases, allowing temperature modifications. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of temperature on specific dynamic action (SDA), or the metabolic cost associated with feeding and digestion, which is thought to represent a substantial portion of fish energy budgets. Measuring SDA with respect to absolute aerobic scope (AAS), estimated by the difference between maximum metabolic rate (MMR) and standard metabolic rate (SMR), provides a snapshot of its respective energy allocation. Fish were acclimated to 16 degrees C, raised or lowered to each acute temperature (13 degrees C, 16 degrees C, 19 degrees C, 22 degrees C or 24 degrees C), then fed a meal of commercial pellets weighing 2\% of their wet mass. We detected a significant positive effect of temperature on SMR and MMR, but not on AAS. As expected, there was no significant effect of temperature on the total O-2 cost of digestion, but unlike other studies, we did not see a significant difference in duration, peak metabolic rate standardized to SMR, time to peak, percent of meal energy utilized, nor the ratio of peak O-2 consumption to SMR. Peak O-2 consumption represented 10.4-14.5\% of AAS leaving a large amount of aerobic capacity available for other activities, and meal energy utilized for digestion ranged from 5.7\% to 7.2\%, leaving substantial remaining energy to potentially assimilate for growth. Our juvenile fall-run Chinook salmon exhibited thermal stability in their SDA response, which may play a role in maintaining homeostasis of digestive capability in a highly heterogeneous thermal environment where rapid growth is important for successful competition with conspecifics and for avoiding predation.",2022,10,1,NA

The Miramichi River, located in eastern Canada, is a prominent Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) river where water temperatures can exceed the proposed upper thermal limit for the species (similar to 27 degrees C). Current legislation closes the river to recreational angling when water temperatures exceed 20 degrees C for two consecutive nights. We aimed to examine how natural thermal variation, representative of extreme high thermal events, affected the thermal tolerance and physiology of wild, juvenile Atlantic salmon. We acclimated fish to four thermal cycles, characteristic of real-world thermal conditions while varying daily thermal minima (16 degrees C, 18 degrees C, 20 degrees C or 22 degrees C) and diel thermal fluctuation (e.g. Delta 5 degrees C-Delta 9 degrees C). In each cycling condition, we assessed the role that thermal minima played on the acute thermal tolerance (critical thermal maximum, (CTMax)), physiological (e.g. heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), ubiquitin) and energetic (e.g. hepatic glycogen, blood glucose and lactate) status of juvenile Atlantic salmon throughout repeated thermal cycles. Exposure to 16-21 degrees C significantly increased CTMax (+0.9 degrees C) compared to a stable acclimation temperature (16 degrees C), as did exposure to diel thermal fluctuations of 18-27 degrees C, 20-27 degrees C and 22-27 degrees C, yet repeated exposure provided no further increases in acute thermal tolerance. In comparison to the reference condition (16-21 degrees C), consecutive days of high temperature cycling with different thermal minima resulted in significant increases in HSP70 and ubiquitin, a significant decrease in liver glycogen, and no significant cumulative effect on either blood glucose or lactate. However, comparison between thermally taxed treatments suggested the diel thermal minima had little influence on the physiological or energetic response of juvenile salmon, despite the variable thermal cycling condition. Our results suggest that relatively cooler night temperatures in the summer months may play a limited role in mitigating physiological stress throughout warm diel cycle events.",2017,5,NA,NA

Juvenile sandbar shark overall performance declined substantially at 32 degrees C or when dissolved oxygen concentration was reduced below 3.5 mg l(-1) (51\% oxygen saturation between 24-32 degrees C).

There is increasing interest in using physiological mediators of the stress response as indicators of individual and population-level response to environmental stressors. Here, we use laboratory experiments to show that the temperature thresholds in brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) for increased gill heat shock protein-70 (20.7 degrees C) and plasma glucose (21.2 degrees C) are similar to their proposed thermal ecological limit of 21.0 degrees C. Field assays demonstrated increased plasma glucose, cortisol and heat shock protein-70 concentrations at field sites where mean daily temperature exceeded 21.0 degrees C. Furthermore, population densities of brook trout were lowest at field sites where temperatures were warm enough to induce a stress response, and a co-occurring species with a higher thermal tolerance showed no evidence of physiological stress at a warm site. The congruence of stress responses and proposed thermal limits supports the use of these thresholds in models of changes in trout distribution under climate change scenarios and suggests that the induction of the stress response by elevated temperature may play a key role in driving the distribution of species.",2015,3,NA,NA

In this study, we used five genetically distinct sub-populations of Australian barramundi (Lates calcarifer) to examine the extent of intraspecific variability in hypoxia tolerance. Fish were maintained at two temperatures (26 or 36 degrees C), representing the seasonal thermal range for this species across its tropical distribution in Australia.

Effects of acclimation temperature and feed restriction on the metabolic performance of green sturgeon,"Zillig, Kenneth W. and Hannan, Kelly D. and Baird, Sarah E. and Cocherell, Dennis E. and Poletto, Jamilynn B. and Fangue, Nann A.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coae021,"Lay Summary: We reared green sturgeon at two temperatures and provided two rations. We then assessed the metabolic performance of fish from these four treatments across a range of temperatures (11 to 31\#x00B0;C). The impacts of temperature and ration create a conservation conflict between green sturgeon and the endangered winter-run Chinook salmon. Green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris) are an anadromous threatened species of sturgeon found along the Pacific coast of North America. The southern distinct population segment only spawns in the Sacramento River and is exposed to water temperatures kept artificially cold for the conservation and management of winter-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Past research has demonstrated costs of cold-water rearing including reduced growth rates, condition and survivorship of juvenile green sturgeon. Our research investigates how the stressors of water temperature and food limitation influence the metabolic performance of green sturgeon. We reared green sturgeon at two acclimation temperatures (13 and 19 degrees C) and two ration amounts (100\% and 40\% of optimal feed). We then measured the routine and maximum metabolic rates (RMR and MMR, respectively) of sturgeon acclimated to these rearing conditions across a range of acute temperature exposures (11 to 31 degrees C). Among both temperature acclimation treatments (13 or 19 degrees C), we found that feed restriction reduced RMR across a range of acute temperatures. The influence of feed restriction on RMR and MMR interacted with acclimation temperature. Fish reared at 13 degrees C preserved their MMR and aerobic scope (AS) despite feed restriction, while fish fed reduced rations and acclimated to 19 degrees C showed reduced MMR and AS capacity primarily at temperatures below 16 degrees C. The sympatry of threatened green sturgeon with endangered salmonids produces a conservation conflict, such that cold-water releases for the conservation of at-risk salmonids may constrain the metabolic performance of juvenile green sturgeon. Understanding the impacts of environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, dissolved oxygen) on ecological interactions of green sturgeon will be necessary to determine the influence of salmonid-focused management.",2024,12,1,NA

Climate warming often traps populations in smaller habitat fragments, not only changing biotic parameters, but potentially decreasing adaptive potential by decreasing genetic variability. We examined the ability of six genetically distinct and different-sized populations of a cold-water fish (brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis) to tolerate acute thermal warming and whether this tolerance could be altered by hybridizing populations. Critical thermal maximum (CTmax) assays were conducted on juveniles from each population to assess thermal tolerance, and the agitation temperature was recorded for assessing behavioural changes to elevated temperatures. An additional metric, which we have called the `CTmax-agitation window' (CTmax minus agitation temperature), was also assessed. The CTmax differed between five out of 15 population pairs, although the maximal CTmax difference was only 0.68 degrees C (29.11-29.79 degrees C). Hybridization between one large population and two small populations yielded no obvious heterosis in mean CTmax, and no differences in agitation temperature or CTmax-agitation window were detected among pure populations or hybrids. Summer variation in temperature within each stream was negatively correlated with mean CTmax and mean CTmax-agitation window, although the maximal difference was small. Despite being one of the most phenotypically divergent and plastic north temperate freshwater fishes, our results suggest that limited variability exists in CTmax among populations of brook trout, regardless of their population size, standing genetic variation and differing natural thermal regimes (temperature variation, minimum and maximum).

Hyposmotic events are particularly challenging for marine sharks that osmoconform, and species-specific tolerances are not well known. Therefore, we sought to determine the effects of an acute (48 h) ecologically relevant hyposmotic event (25.8 ppt) on the physiology of two juvenile shark species, namely the school shark (Galeorhinus galeus), listed by the Australian Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act as `conservation dependent', and the gummy shark (Mustelus antarcticus), from the Pittwater Estuary (Australia). In both species, we observed a decrease in plasma osmolality brought about by selective losses of NaCl, urea and trimethylamine N-oxide, as well as decreases in haemoglobin, haematocrit and routine oxygen consumption. Heat-shock protein levels varied between species during the exposure, but we found no evidence of protein damage in any of the tissues tested. Although both species seemed to be able to cope with this level of osmotic challenge, overall the school sharks exhibited higher gill Na+/K+-ATPase activity and ubiquitin concentrations in routine and experimental conditions, a larger heat-shock protein response and a smaller decrease in routine oxygen consumption during the hyposmotic exposure, suggesting that there are species-specific responses that could potentially affect their ability to withstand longer or more severe changes in salinity. Emerging evidence from acoustic monitoring of sharks has indicated variability in the species found in the Pittwater Estuary during hyposmotic events, and together, our data may help to predict species abundance and distribution in the face of future global climate change.",2016,4,NA,NA

In general, regardless of origin (Atlantic or Mediterranean), the mussels were rather resilient to acidification for most of the parameters considered and they were able to grow in strongly acidified seawater through an increased feeding activity. However, shell strength decreased (40\%) consistently in both mussel populations held in moderately and highly acidified seawater. The observed reduction in shell strength was not explained by slight alterations in organic matter, shell thickness or aragonite:calcite ratio. The combined effects of high acidification and warming on the key response of byssus strength caused a strong decline in mussel performance, although only in Galician mussels, in which the valve opening time decreased sharply as well as condition index (soft tissue state) and shell growth. By contrast, the observed negative effect of highly acidified scenario on the strength of Tunisian mussel shells was (partly but not totally) counterbalanced by the higher seawater temperature. Eco-physiological and behavioural interactions in mussels in relation to climate change are complex, and future scenarios for the ecology of the species and also the feasibility of cultivating them in Atlantic and Mediterranean zones are discussed.",2021,9,NA,NA
Acute measures of upper thermal and hypoxia tolerance are not reliable predictors of mortality following environmental challenges in rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>),"Strowbridge, Nicholas and Northrup, Sara L. and Earhart, Madison L. and Blanchard, Tessa S. and Schulte, Patricia M.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coab095,"Anthropogenic climate change threatens freshwater biodiversity and poses a challenge for fisheries management, as fish will increasingly be exposed to episodes of high temperature and low oxygen (hypoxia). Here, we examine the extent of variation in tolerance of acute exposure to these stressors within and among five strains of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) currently being used or under consideration for use in stocking programmes in British Columbia, Canada. We used incipient lethal oxygen saturation (ILOS) as an index of acute hypoxia tolerance, critical thermal maximum (CTmax) as an index of acute upper thermal tolerance and mortality following these two acute exposure trials to assess the relative resilience of individuals and strains to climate change-relevant stressors. We measured tolerance across two brood years and two life stages (fry and yearling), using a highly replicated design with hundreds of individuals per strain and life stage. There was substantial within-strain variation in CTmax and ILOS, but differences among strains, although statistically significant, were small. In contrast, there were large differences in post-trial mortality among strains, ranging from less than 2\% mortality in the most resilient strain to 55\% mortality in the least resilient. There was a statistically significant, but weak, correlation between CTmax and ILOS at both life stages for some strains, with thermally tolerant individuals tending to be hypoxia tolerant. These data indicate that alternative metrics of tolerance may result in different conclusions regarding resilience to climate change stressors, which has important implications for stocking and management decisions for fish conservation in a changing climate.",2021,9,NA,NA
Ice age fish in a warming world: minimal variation in thermal acclimation capacity among lake trout (<i>Salvelinus namaycush</i>) populations,"Kelly, Nicholas I. and Burness, Gary and McDermid, Jenni L. and Wilson, Chris C.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/cou025,"In the face of climate change, the persistence of cold-adapted species will depend on their adaptive capacity for physiological traits within and among populations. The lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) is a cold-adapted salmonid and a relict from the last ice age that is well suited as a model species for studying the predicted effects of climate change on coldwater fishes. We investigated the thermal acclimation capacity of upper temperature resistance and metabolism of lake trout from four populations across four acclimation temperatures. Individuals were reared from egg fertilization onward in a common environment and, at 2 years of age, were acclimated to 8, 11, 15 or 19 degrees C. Although one population had a slightly higher maximal metabolic rate (MMR), higher metabolic scope for activity and faster metabolic recovery across all temperatures, there was no interpopulation variation for critical thermal maximum (CTM) or routine metabolic rate (RMR) or for the thermal acclimation capacity of CTM, RMR, MMR or metabolic scope. Across the four acclimation temperatures, there was a 3 degrees C maximal increase in CTM and 3-fold increase in RMR for all populations. Above 15 degrees C, a decline in MMR and increase in RMR resulted in sharply reduced metabolic scope for all populations acclimated at 19 degrees C. Together, these data suggest there is limited variation among lake trout populations in thermal physiology or capacity for thermal acclimatization, and that climate change may impact lake trout populations in a similar manner across a wide geographical range. Understanding the effect of elevated temperatures on the thermal physiology of this economically and ecologically important cold-adapted species will help inform management and conservation strategies for the long-term sustainability of lake trout populations.",2014,2,1,NA
Effects of acclimation temperature on the thermal physiology in two geographically distinct populations of lake sturgeon (<i>Acipenser fulvescens</i>),"Bugg, William S. and Yoon, Gwangseok R. and Schoen, Alexandra N. and Laluk, Andrew and Brandt, Catherine and Anderson, W. Gary and Jeffries, Ken M.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coaa087,"Temperature is one of the most important abiotic factors regulating development and biological processes in ectotherms. By 2050, climate change may result in temperature increases of 2.1-3.4 degrees C in Manitoba, Canada. Lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, from both northern and southern populations in Manitoba were acclimated to 16, 20 and 24 degrees C for 30 days, after which critical thermal maximum (CTmax) trials were conducted to investigate their thermal plasticity. We also examined the effects of temperature on morphological and physiological indices. Acclimation temperature significantly influenced the CTmax, body mass, hepatosomatic index, metabolic rate and the mRNA expression of transcripts involved in the cellular response to heat shock and hypoxia (HSP70, HSP90a, HSP90b, HIF-1 alpha) in the gill of lake sturgeon. Population significantly affected the above phenotypes, as well as the mRNA expression of Na+/K+ ATPase-alpha 1 and the hepatic glutathione peroxidase enzyme activity. The southern population had an average CTmax that was 0.71 and 0.45 degrees C higher than the northern population at 20 and 24 degrees C, respectively. Immediately following CTmax trials, mRNA expression of HSP90a and HIF-1 alpha was positively correlated with individual CTmax of lake sturgeon across acclimation treatments and populations (r=0.7, r=0.62, respectively; P<0.0001). Lake sturgeon acclimated to 20 and 24 degrees C had decreased hepatosomatic indices (93 and 244\% reduction, respectively; P<0.0001) and metabolic suppression (27.7 and 42.1\% reduction, respectively; P<0.05) when compared to sturgeon acclimated to 16 degrees C, regardless of population. Glutathione peroxidase activity and mRNA expression Na+/K+ ATPase-alpha 1 were elevated in the northern relative to the southern population. Acclimation to 24 degrees C also induced mortality in both populations when compared to sturgeon acclimated to 16 and 20 degrees C.

To help define suitable thermal habitat for juvenile Chinook salmon, the thermal performance of juvenile Chinook salmon acclimated to either 15 or 19 degrees C was tested across a range of environmentally relevant acute temperature changes (from 12 to 26 degrees C). Swim tunnel respirometers were used to measure routine oxygen uptake as a measure of routine metabolic rate (RMR) and oxygen uptake when swimming maximally as a measure of maximal metabolic rate (MMR) at each test temperature. We estimated absolute aerobic scope (AAS = MMR - RMR), the capacity to supply oxygen beyond routine needs, as well as factorial aerobic scope (FAS = MMR/RMR). All fish swam at a test temperature of 23 degrees C regardless of acclimation temperature, but some mortality occurred at 25 degrees C during MMR measurements. Overall, RMR and MMR increased with acute warming, but aerobic capacity was unaffected by test temperatures up to 23 degrees C in both acclimation groups. The mean AAS for fish acclimated and tested at 15 degrees C (7.06 +/- 1.76 mg O-2 kg(-1) h(-1)) was similar to that measured for fish acclimated and tested at 19 degrees C (8.80 +/- 1.42 mg O-2 kg(- 1) h(- 1)). Over the entire acute test temperature range, while MMR and AAS were similar for the two acclimation groups, RMR was significantly lower and FAS consequently higher at the lower test temperatures for the fish acclimated at 19 degrees C. Thus, this stock of juvenile Chinook salmon shows an impressive aerobic capacity when acutely warmed to temperatures close to their upper thermal tolerance limit, regardless of the acclimation temperature. These results are compared with those for other salmonids, and the implications of our findings for informing management actions are discussed.",2017,5,NA,NA
Climate change and the performance of larval coral reef fishes: the interaction between temperature and food availability,"McLeod, Ian M. and Rummer, Jodie L. and Clark, Timothy D. and Jones, Geoffrey P. and McCormick, Mark I. and Wenger, Amelia S. and Munday, Philip L.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/cot024,"Climate-change models predict that tropical ocean temperatures will increase by 2-3 degrees C this century and affect plankton communities that are food for marine fish larvae. Both temperature and food supply can influence development time, growth, and metabolism of marine fishes, particularly during larval stages. However, little is known of the relative importance and potential interacting effects of ocean warming and changes to food supply on the performance of larval fishes. We tested this for larvae of the coral reef anemonefish, Amphiprion percula, in an orthogonal experiment comprising three temperatures and three feeding schedules. Temperatures were chosen to represent present-day summer averages (29.2 degrees C) and end-of-century climate change projections of +1.5 degrees C (30.7 degrees C) and +3 degrees C (32.2 degrees C). Feeding schedules were chosen to represent a reduction in access to food (fed daily, every 2 days, or every 3 days). Overall, larvae took longer to settle at higher temperatures and with less frequent feeding, and there was a significant interaction between these factors. Time to metamorphosis was fastest in the 30.7 degrees C and high food availability treatment (10.5 +/- 0.2 days) and slowest in the 32.2 degrees C and low food availability treatment (15.6 +/- 0.5 days; i.e. 50\% faster). Fish from the lower feeding regimens had a lower body condition and decreased survivorship to metamorphosis. Routine oxygen consumption rates were highest for fish raised at 32.2 degrees C and fed every third day (1620 +/- 107 mg O-2 kg(-1) h(-1)) and lowest for fish raised at 29.2 degrees C and fed daily (1220 +/- 101 mg O-2 kg(-1) h(-1); i.e. 35\% lower). The elevated routine oxygen consumption rate, and therefore greater energy use at higher temperatures, may leave less energy available for growth and development, resulting in the longer time to metamorphosis. Overall, these results suggest that larval fishes will be severely impacted by climate-change scenarios that predict both elevated temperatures and reduced food supply.",2013,1,1,NA

Nevertheless, food shortage, interacting with high temperature, led to an increase in latency response and a significant reduction inRMRs. Recent literature suggests that anthropogenic stressors can disrupt ecologically relevant behaviours in fish, such as the ability to escape from predators. Disruption of these behaviours at critical life history transitions, such as the transition from the pelagic environment to the juvenile/adult habitat, may have even greater repercussions. The literature suggests that an increase in temperature can affect fish escape response, as well as metabolism; however, few studies have focused on the acute sensitivity responses and the potential for acclimation through developmental plasticity. Here, we aimed at evaluating the acute and long-term effects of exposure to warming conditions on the escape response and routine metabolic rate (RMR) of early life stages of the white seabream, Diplodus sargus. Additionally, as food availability may modulate the response to warming, we further tested the effects of long-term exposure to high temperature and food shortage, as individual and interacting drivers, on escape response and RMR. Temperature treatments were adjusted to ambient temperature (19 degrees C) and a high temperature (22 degrees C). Feeding treatments were established as high ration and low ration (50\% of high ration). Escape response and RMR were measured after the high temperature was reached (acute exposure) and after 4 weeks (prolonged exposure). Acute warming had a significant effect on escape response and generated an upward trend in RMR. In the long term, however, there seems to be an acclimation of the escape response and RMR. Food shortage, interacting with high temperature, led to an increase in latency response and a significant reduction in RMR. The current study provides relevant experimental data on fishes' behavioural and physiological responses to the combined effects of multiple stressors. This knowledge can be incorporated in recruitment models, thereby contributing to fine-tuning of models required for fisheries management and species conservation.",2022,10,1,NA

The delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), a small semi-anadromous fish endemic to the SFE and considered an indicator species, is close to extinction in the wild. The goal of this study was to investigate how environmental alterations to the SFE, such as reductions in turbidities, higher temperatures and increased prevalence of invasive predators affect the physiology and stress response of juvenile delta smelt. Juvenile delta smelt were exposed to two temperatures (17 and 21 \& DEG;C) and two turbidities (1-2 and 10-11 NTU) for 2 weeks. After the first week of exposure, delta smelt were exposed to a largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) predator cue at the same time every day for 7 days. Fish were measured and sampled on the first (acute) and final (chronic) day of exposures to predator cues and later analyzed for whole-body cortisol, glucose, lactate, and protein. Length and mass measurements were used to calculate condition factor of fish in each treatment. Turbidity had the greatest effect on juvenile delta smelt and resulted in reduced cortisol, increased glucose and lactate, and greater condition factor. Elevated temperatures reduced available energy in delta smelt, indicated by lower glucose and total protein, whereas predator cue exposure had negligible effects on their stress response. This is the first study to show reduced cortisol in juvenile delta smelt held in turbid conditions and adds to the growing data that suggest this species performs best in moderate temperatures and turbidities. Multistressor experiments are necessary to understand the capacity of delta smelt to respond to the multivariate and dynamic changes in their natural environment, and results from this study should be considered for management-based conservation efforts.",2023,11,1,NA
Warmer temperature and provision of natural substrate enable earlier metamorphosis in the critically endangered Baw Baw frog,"Gilbert, Deon J. and Magrath, Michael J.

This study investigates the independent and interactive effects of water temperature and food availability on larval growth and development of the critically endangered Baw Baw frog, Philoria frosti. Larvae were reared at low (12 degrees C) or high (17 degrees C) water temperature in the absence or presence of substrate that controlled food availability, and body size and time to metamorphosis were quantified. Growth and development of larvae was influenced by the individual effects of temperature and food availability; time to metamorphosis was shorter in warm water treatment groups and in the presence of substrate and increased food. Unexpectedly, however, water temperature and food availability did not have an interactive effect on either time to metamorphose or body size at metamorphosis. Under all treatment groups, metamorphic onset occurred once a developmental size threshold was reached, indicating that growth rate and body size are key factors controlling the metamorphic process in Baw Baw frogs (consistent with the Wilbur-Collins model for ectotherm development). From an applied perspective, our findings have implications for amphibian conservation because they indicate that simple manipulations of temperature and food availability can be used to increase the rate of frog production in conservation breeding programs.",2020,8,NA,NA

In the present study, we chronically exposed larvae of the striped-marsh frog (Limnodynastes peronii) to a factorial combination of high and low UVBR and high and low temperature to assess interactive effects on growth, survival and indices of immune function. The high UVBR treatment reduced growth and survival of larvae compared to the low UVBR treatment at both temperatures, but the effects were significantly enhanced at low temperature. High UVBR exposure also induced a chronic inflammatory response as evidenced by an increase in the leucocyte proportion of total cells and altered the ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes in the blood, highlighting a potential mechanistic basis for increased disease susceptibility in amphibians living at high altitudes. Our findings stress the importance of investigating environmental factors in combination when assessing their effects and highlight the mechanistic basis for how key environmental drivers in montane regions affect amphibian health.

Here, we report the first assessments of the aerobic capacity of a Californian population of wild Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum in relationship to water temperature. Our field measurements revealed that wild O. mykiss from the lower Tuolumne River, California maintained 95\% of their peak aerobic scope across an impressive temperature range (17.8-24.6 degrees C). The thermal range for peak performance corresponds to local high river temperatures, but represents an unusually high temperature tolerance compared with conspecifics and congeneric species from northern latitudes. This high thermal tolerance suggests that O. mykiss at the southern limit of their indigenous distribution may be locally adjusted relative to more northern populations. From fisheries management and conservation perspectives, these findings challenge the use of a single thermal criterion to regulate the habitat of the O. mykiss species along the entirety of its distribution range.",2016,4,NA,NA

Larval L. peronii were reared in conditions of either constant or stochastic food availability and in water at three different temperatures (18, 22 and 26 degrees C), and effects on survival, growth and development were quantified.

However, changes in food availability mediated the effects of temperature, with slower larval growth and higher survivorship in stochastic food availability treatments. Tadpoles in the stochastic food availability treatments did not reach metamorphosis during the experimental period, suggesting that developmental stasis may have been induced by food restriction.

Effects of ambient oxygen and size-selective mortality on growth and maturation in guppies,"Diaz Pauli, Beatriz and Kolding, Jeppe and Jeyakanth, Geetha and Heino, Mikko",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/cox010,"Growth, onset of maturity and investment in reproduction are key traits for understanding variation in life-history strategies. Many environmental factors affect variation in these traits, but for fish, hypoxia and size-dependent mortality have become increasingly important because of human activities, such as increased nutrient enrichment (eutrophication), climate warming and selective fishing. Here, we study experimentally the effect of oxygen availability on maturation and growth in guppies (Poecilia reticulata) from two different selected lines, one subjected to positive and the other negative size-dependent fishing. This is the first study to assess the effects of both reduced ambient oxygen and size-dependent mortality in fish. We show that reduced ambient oxygen led to stunting, early maturation and high reproductive investment. Likewise, lineages that had been exposed to high mortality of larger-sized individuals displayed earlier maturation at smaller size, greater investment in reproduction and faster growth. These life-history changes were particularly evident for males. The widely reported trends towards earlier maturation in wild fish populations are often interpreted as resulting from size-selective fishing. Our results highlight that reduced ambient oxygen, which has received little experimental investigation to date, can lead to similar phenotypic changes. Thus, changes in ambient oxygen levels can be a confounding factor that occurs in parallel with fishing, complicating the causal interpretation of changes in life-history traits. We believe that better disentangling of the effects of these two extrinsic factors, which increasingly affect many freshwater and marine ecosystems, is important for making more informed management decisions.",2017,5,NA,NA
Post-exercise respirometry underestimates maximum metabolic rate in juvenile salmon,"Raby, Graham D. and Doherty, Claire L.

Methods used for estimating MMR vary considerably, with the two most common methods being (i) the `chase method; where fish are manually chased to exhaustion and immediately sealed into a respirometer for post-exercise measurement of oxygen consumption rate ((M) over dot(O2)), and (ii) the `swim tunnel method'; whereby (M) over dot(O2 )is measured while the fish swims at high speed in a swim tunnel respirometer. In this study, we compared estimates for MMR made using a 3-min exhaustive chase (followed by measurement of (M) over dot(O2) in a static respirometer) versus those made via maximal swimming in a swim tunnel respirometer. We made a total of 134 estimates of MMR using the two methods with juveniles of two salmonids (Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) across a 6 degrees C temperature range. We found that the chase method underestimated `true' MMR (based on the swim tunnel method) by ca. 20\% in these species. The gap in MMR estimates between the two methods was not significantly affected by temperature (range of ca. 15-21 degrees C) nor was it affected by body mass (overall range of 53.5236 g). Our data support some previous studies that have suggested the use of a swim tunnel respirometer generates markedly higher estimates of MMR than does the chase method, at least for species in which a swim tunnel respirometer is viable (e.g. `athletic' ram ventilating fishes). We recommend that the chase method could be used as a `proxy' (i.e. with a correction factor) for MMR in future studies if supported by a species-specific calibration with a relevant range of temperatures, body sizes or other covariates of interest.",2020,8,NA,NA

As expected, metabolic rates increased with body mass. Although resting metabolic rate increased with temperature, maximal metabolic rate showed no change. Likewise, AS did not vary across treatments. The CTmax increased with acclimation temperature. There was no effect of habitat on maximal metabolic rate, AS or CTmax; however, there was a trend towards a lower resting metabolic rate for Nile perch captured in the low-dissolved oxygen habitat than in well-oxygenated waters.

Increasing average temperature and variability induced by climate change can lead to mismatches between seasonal cues. We used mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) to test the hypotheses that mismatches between seasonal temperature and light regimes (short days and warm temperature and vice versa) decrease swimming performance, metabolic rates and mitochondrial efficiency and that the responses to light and temperature are mediated by thyroid hormone. We show that day length influenced thermal acclimation of swimming performance through thyroid-dependent mechanisms. Oxygen consumption rates were influenced by acclimation temperature and thyroid hormone. Mitochondrial substrate oxidation rates (state three rates) were modified by the interaction between temperature and day length, and mitochondrial efficiency (P/O ratios) increased with warm acclimation. Using P/O ratios to calibrate metabolic (oxygen consumption) scope showed that oxygen consumption did not predict adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. Unlike oxygen consumption, ATP production was influenced by day length in a thyroid-dependent manner. Our data indicate that oxygen consumption alone should not be used as a predictor of ATP production. Overall, the effects of thyroid hormone on locomotion and energetics were reversed by mismatches such as warm temperatures on short days. We predict that mid to high latitudes in North America and Asia will be particularly affected by mismatches as a result of high seasonality and predicted warming over the next 50 years.",2020,8,NA,NA

Juvenile Westslope Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi), a species listed as threatened in Alberta and of special concern in British Columbia, were tested in an automated shuttlebox experimental design (Loligo (R) Systems) to determine average and ranges of temperature preference (T-pref) and occupied temperatures. Previous lab studies suggested that Westslope Cutthroat Trout (WCT) prefer temperatures around 15 degrees C, however, we found that average daytime Tpref for lab-reared juvenile WCT was substantially higher at 18.6 degrees C, with occupied temperatures ranging between 11.9 degrees C and 26.0 degrees C throughout the duration of trials. This seems to indicate that despite constant lab-rearing conditions of 12 degrees C, juvenile WCT may tolerate and even prefer warmer water temperatures. The duration of the acclimation period (1h, 12 h and 24 h) did not have an effect on T-pref, however, T-pref differed significantly for variable trial durations (12 h, 24 h and 36 h). A closer look at thermal trends throughout trials revealed that photoperiod significantly influenced T-pref, as nighttime temperature preference reached consistently 26 degrees C.

This study investigated the physiological consequences of long-term, naturalistic temperature variation on juvenile hellbenders under simulated current and warmer (+1.6 C) climates vs. controlled steady temperatures. Mean temperature and temperature variability were both important predictors of growth as indicated by monthly body mass change (\%), stress as indicated by neutrophil:lymphocyte (N:L) ratio and bacteria-killing ability of blood. Cold exposure in hellbenders was associated with weight loss, increased N:L ratios and reduced Escherichia coli killing ability of blood, and these effects were less pronounced under a warmer climate scenario. These observations suggest that cold periods may be more stressful for hellbenders than previously understood. Growth rates peaked in late spring and late fall around 14-17 degrees C. Hellbenders experiencing warmer simulated climates retained body condition better in winter, but this was counter-balanced by a prolonged lack of growth in the 3-month summer period leading up to the fall breeding season where warmer simulated conditions resulted in an average loss of -0.6\% body mass/month, compared to a gain +1.5\% body mass/month under current climate scenario. Hellbenders can physiologically tolerate projected warmer temperatures and temperature fluctuations, but warmer summers may cause animals to enter the fall breeding season with a caloric deficit that may have population-level consequences.",2021,9,NA,NA
Evaluating corticosterone as a biomarker for amphibians exposed to increased salinity and ambient corticosterone,"Tornabene, Brian J. and Hossack, Blake R. and Crespi, Erica J. and Breuner, Creagh W.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coab049,"Physiological biomarkers are commonly used to assess the health of taxa exposed to natural and anthropogenic stressors. Glucocorticoid (GC) hormones are often used as indicators of physiological stress in wildlife because they affect growth, reproduction and survival. Increased salinity fromhuman activities negatively influences amphibians and their corticosterone (CORT; the main amphibian GC) physiology; therefore, CORT could be a useful biomarker. We evaluated whether waterborne CORT could serve as a biomarker of salt stress for three free-living amphibian species that vary in their sensitivity to salinity: boreal chorus frogs (Pseudacris maculata), northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens) and barred tiger salamanders (Ambystoma mavortium). Across a gradient of contamination from energy-related saline wastewaters, we tested the effects of salinity on baseline and stress-induced waterborne CORT of larvae. Stress-induced, but not baseline, CORT of leopard frogs increased with increasing salinity. Salinitywas not associated with baseline or stress-induced CORT of chorus frogs or tiger salamanders. Associations between CORT and salinitywere also not related to species-specific sensitivities to salinity. However, we detected background environmental CORT (ambient CORT) in all wetlands and spatial variation was high within and among wetlands. Higher ambient CORT was associated with lower waterborne CORT of larvae in wetlands. Therefore, ambient CORT likely confounded associations between waterborne CORT and salinity in our analysis and possibly influenced physiology of larvae. We hypothesize that larvae may passively take up CORT from their environment and downregulate endogenous CORT. Although effects ofsomehormones (e.g. oestrogen) and endocrine disruptors on aquatic organisms arewell described, studies investigating the occurrence and effects of ambient CORT are limited. We provide suggestions to improve collection methods, reduce variability and avoid confounding effects of ambient CORT. By making changes to methodology, waterborne CORT could still be a promising, non-invasive conservation tool to evaluate effects of salinity on amphibians.",2021,9,NA,1-15
"Thermal tolerance depends on season, age and body condition in imperilled redside dace <i>Clinostomus elongatus</i>","Turko, Andy J. and Nolan, Colby B. and Balshine, Sigal and Scott, Graham R. and Pitcher, Trevor E.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coaa062,"Urbanization tends to increase water temperatures in streams and rivers and is hypothesized to be contributing to declines of many freshwater fishes. However, factors that influence individual variation in thermal tolerance, and how these may change seasonally, are not well understood. To address this knowledge gap, we studied redside dace Clinostomus elongatus, an imperilled stream fish native to rapidly urbanizing areas of eastern North America. In wild redside dace from rural Ohio, USA, acute upper thermal tolerance (i.e. critical thermal maximum, CTmax) ranged between similar to 34 degrees C in summer (stream temperature similar to 22 degrees C) and 27 degrees C in winter (stream temperature similar to 2 degrees C). Juveniles had higher CTmax than adults in spring and summer, but in winter, CTmax was higher in adults. Thermal safety margins (CTmax - ambient water temperature; similar to 11 degrees C) were less than the increases in peak water temperature predicted for many redside dace streams due to the combined effects of climate change and urbanization. Furthermore, behavioural agitation occurred 5-6 degrees C below CTmax. Safety margins were larger (>20 degrees C) in autumn and winter. In addition, redside dace were more sensitive (2.5 degrees C lower CTmax) than southern redbelly dace Chrosomus erythrogaster, a non-imperilled sympatric cyprinid. Body condition (Fulton's K) of adult redside dace was positively correlated with CTmax, but in juveniles, this relationship was significant only in one of two summers of experiments. Next, we measured CTmax of captive redside dace fed experimentally manipulated diets. In adults, but not juveniles, CTmax was higher in fish fed a high- vs. low-ration diet, indicating a causal link between nutrition and thermal tolerance. We conclude that redside dace will be challenged by predicted future summer temperatures, especially in urbanized habitats. Thus, habitat restoration that mitigates temperature increases is likely to benefit redside dace. We also suggest habitat restoration that improves food availability may increase thermal tolerance, and thus population resilience.",2020,8,NA,NA
Limited transgenerational effects of environmental temperatures on thermal performance of a cold-adapted salmonid,"Penney, Chantelle M. and Burness, Gary and Tabh, Joshua K. R. and Wilson, Chris C.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coab021,"The capacity of ectotherms to cope with rising temperatures associated with climate change is a significant conservation concern as the rate of warming is likely too rapid to allow for adaptative responses in many populations. Transgenerational plasticity (TGP), if present, could potentially buffer some of the negative impacts of warming on future generations. We examined TGP in lake trout to assess their inter-generational potential to cope with anticipated warming. We acclimated adult lake trout to cold (10 degrees C) or warm (17 degrees C) temperatures for several months, then bred them to produce offspring from parents within a temperature treatment (cold-acclimated and warm-acclimated parents) and between temperature treatments (i.e. reciprocal crosses). At the fry stage, offspring were also acclimated to cold (11 degrees C) or warm (15 degrees C) temperatures. Thermal performance was assessed by measuring their critical thermal maximum (CTM) and the change in metabolic rate during an acute temperature challenge. From this dataset, we also determined their resting and peak (highest achieved, thermally induced) metabolic rates. There was little variation in offspring CTM or peak metabolic rate, although cold-acclimated offspring from warm-acclimated parents exhibited elevated resting metabolic rates without a corresponding increase in mass or condition factor, suggesting that transgenerational effects can be detrimental when parent and offspring environments mismatch. These results suggest that the limited TGP in thermal performance of lake trout is unlikely to significantly influence population responses to projected increases in environmental temperatures.",2021,9,NA,NA
Ontogeny of osmoregulation of the Asian shore crab <i>Hemigrapsus sanguineus</i> at an invaded site of Europe,"Torres, Gabriela and Charmantier, Guy and Gimenez, Luis",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coab094,"We studied the ontogeny of osmoregulation of the Asian shore crab Hemigrapsus sanguineus at an invaded area in the North Sea. H. sanguineus is native to Japan and China but has successfully invaded the Atlantic coast of North America and Europe. In the invaded areas, H. sanguineus is becoming a keystone species as driver of community structure and the adults compete with the shore crab Carcinus maenas. Strong osmoregulatory abilities may confer the potential to use and invade coastal areas already earlier in the life cycle. We reared larvae and first juveniles at 24 degrees C in seawater from hatching to intermoult of each developmental stage (zoea I-V, megalopa, crab I). We exposed each stage to a range of salinities (0-39 ppt) for 24 h, and then we quantified haemolymph osmolality, using nano-osmometry. In addition, we quantified osmolality in field-collected adults after acclimation to the test salinities for 6 days. Larvae of H. sanguineus were able to hyper-osmoregulate at low salinities (15 and 20 ppt) over the complete larval development, although the capacity was reduced at the zoeal stage V; at higher salinities (25-39 ppt), all larval stages were osmoconformers. The capacity to slightly hypo-regulate at high salinity appeared in the first juvenile. Adults were able to hyper-osmoregulate at low salinities and hypo-regulate at concentrated seawater (39 ppt). H. sanguineus showed a strong capacity to osmoregulate as compared to its native competitor C. maenas, which only hyper-regulates at the first and last larval stages and does not hypo-regulate at the juvenile-adult stages. The capacity of H. sanguineus to osmoregulate over most of the life cycle should underpin the potential to invade empty niches in the coastal zone (characterized by low salinity and high temperatures). Osmoregulation abilities over the whole life cycle also constitute a strong competitive advantage over C. maenas.",2021,9,1,NA
"Responses to saltwater exposure vary across species, populations and life stages in anuran amphibians","Albecker, Molly A. and McCoy, Michael W.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coad062,"To predict the impacts of environmental change on species, we must first understand the factors that limit the present-day ranges of species. Most anuran amphibians cannot survive at elevated salinities, which may drive their distribution in coastal locations. Previous research showed that coastal Hyla cinerea are locally adapted to brackish habitats in North Carolina, USA. Although Hyla squirella and Hyla chrysoscelis both inhabit coastal wetlands nearby, they have not been observed in saline habitats. We take advantage of naturally occurring microgeographic variation in coastal wetland occupancy exhibited by these congeneric tree frog species to explore how salt exposure affects oviposition site choice, hatching success, early tadpole survival, plasma osmolality and tadpole body condition across coastal and inland locations. We observed higher survival among coastal H. cinerea tadpoles than inland H. cinerea, which corroborates previous findings. But contrary to expectations, coastal H. cinerea had lower survival than H. squirella and H. chrysoscelis, indicating that all three species may be able to persist in saline wetlands. We also observed differences in tadpole plasma osmolality across species, locations and salinities, but these differences were not associated with survival rates in salt water. Instead, coastal occupancy may be affected by stage-specific processes like higher probability of total clutch loss as shown by inland H. chrysoscelis or maladaptive egg deposition patterns as shown by inland H. squirella. Although we expected salt water to be the primary filter driving species distributions along a coastal salinity gradient, it is likely that the factors dictating anuran ranges along the coast involve stage-, species- and location-specific processes that are mediated by ecological processes and life history traits.",2023,11,1,NA
Smaller herring larval size-at-stage in response to environmental changes is associated with ontogenic processes and stress response,"Joly, Lea J. and Boersma, Maarten and Giraldo, Carolina and Mazurais, David and Madec, Lauriane and Collet, Sophie and Zambonino-Infante, Jose-Luis and Meunier, Cedric L.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coad072,"The development and physiology of herring larvae were monitored for individuals reared in control and combined warming-acidification crossed with different food quality treatments. The experiment revealed that warming and acidification triggers a stress response at the molecular level and decrease herring larvae size-at-stage. Global change puts coastal systems under pressure, affecting the ecology and physiology of marine organisms. In particular, fish larvae are sensitive to environmental conditions, and their fitness is an important determinant of fish stock recruitment and fluctuations. To assess the combined effects of warming, acidification and change in food quality, herring larvae were reared in a control scenario (11 \& DEG;C{*}pH 8.0) and a scenario predicted for 2100 (14 \& DEG;C{*}pH 7.6) crossed with two feeding treatments (enriched in phosphorus and docosahexaenoic acid or not). The experiment lasted from hatching to the beginning of the post-flexion stage (i.e. all fins present) corresponding to 47 days post-hatch (dph) at 14 \& DEG;C and 60 dph at 11 \& DEG;C. Length and stage development were monitored throughout the experiment and the expression of genes involved in growth, metabolic pathways and stress responses were analysed for stage 3 larvae (flexion of the notochord). Although the growth rate was unaffected by acidification and temperature changes, the development was accelerated in the 2100 scenario, where larvae reached the last developmental stage at a smaller size (-8\%). We observed no mortality related to treatments and no effect of food quality on the development of herring larvae. However, gene expression analyses revealed that heat shock transcripts expression was higher in the warmer and more acidic treatment. Our findings suggest that the predicted warming and acidification environment are stressful for herring larvae, inducing a decrease in size-at-stage at a precise period of ontogeny. This could either negatively affect survival and recruitment via the extension of the predation window or positively increase the survival by reducing the larval stage duration.",2023,11,1,NA
Seasonal blood chemistry response of sub-tropical nearshore fishes to climate change,"Shultz, Aaron D. and Zuckerman, Zachary C. and Stewart, Heather A. and Suski, Cory D.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/cou028,"Climate change due to anthropogenic activity will continue to alter the chemistry of the oceans. Future climate scenarios indicate that sub-tropical oceans will become more acidic, and the temperature and salinity will increase relative to current conditions. A large portion of previous work has focused on how future climate scenarios may impact shell-forming organisms and coral reef fish, with little attention given to fish that inhabit nearshore habitats; few studies have examined multiple challenges concurrently. The purpose of this study was to quantify the blood-based physiological response of nearshore fishes to a suite of seawater conditions associated with future climate change. Fish were exposed to an acute (30 min) increase in salinity (50 ppt), acidity (decrease in pH by 0.5 units) or temperature (7-10 degrees C), or temperature and acidity combined, and held in these conditions for 6 h. Their physiological responses were compared across seasons (i.e. summer vs. winter). Bonefish (Albula vulpes) exposed to environmental challenges in the summer experienced a suite of blood-based osmotic and ionic disturbances relative to fish held in ambient conditions, with thermal challenges (particularly in the summer) being the most challenging. Conversely, no significant treatment effects were observed for yellowfin mojarra (Gerres cinereus) or checkered puffer (Sphoeroides testudineus) in either season. Together, results from this study demonstrate that acute climate-induced changes to thermal habitat will be the most challenging for sub-tropical fishes (particularly in the summer) relative to salinity and pH stressors, but significant variation across species exists.",2014,2,1,NA

The results will inform and parametrize models used in the recovery planning of westslope cutthroat trout. Global warming is changing the thermal habitat of cold-water freshwater fishes, which can lead to decreased fitness and survival and cause shifts in species distributions. The Alberta population of westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi) is listed as `Threatened' under the Canadian Species at Risk Act. The major threats to the species are the alteration in habitat and water flow, competition and hybridization with non-native trout species and climate change. Here, we conducted (i) intermittent-flow respirometry experiments with adult native westslope cutthroat trout and non-native rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and (ii) critical thermal maximum experiments (CTmax) with adult westslope cutthroat trout to obtain valuable input data for species distribution models. For both species, standard metabolic rate (SMR) was lower at 10 degrees C compared to 15 degrees C and westslope cutthroat trout had higher SMR than rainbow trout. Although there were inter-specific differences in SMR, forced aerobic scope (using a standardized chase protocol) was different at 10 degrees C, but no significant differences were observed at 15 degrees C because of relative smaller differences in maximum metabolic rate between the species. CTmax of westslope cutthroat trout acclimated to 10 degrees C was 27.0 +/- 0.8 degrees C and agitation temperature was 25.2 +/- 1.0 degrees C.

Ontogeny influences sensitivity to climate change stressors in an endangered fish,"Komoroske, L. M. and Connon, R. E. and Lindberg, J. and Cheng, B.

A.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/cou008,"Coastal ecosystems are among the most human-impacted habitats globally, and their management is often critically linked to recovery of declining native species. In the San Francisco Estuary, the Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) is an endemic, endangered fish strongly tied to Californian conservation planning. The complex life history of Delta Smelt combined with dynamic seasonal and spatial abiotic conditions result in dissimilar environments experienced among ontogenetic stages, which may yield stage-specific susceptibility to abiotic stressors. Climate change is forecasted to increase San Francisco Estuary water temperature and salinity; therefore, understanding the influences of ontogeny and phenotypic plasticity on tolerance to these critical environmental parameters is particularly important for Delta Smelt and other San Francisco Estuary fishes. We assessed thermal and salinity limits in several ontogenetic stages and acclimation states of Delta Smelt, and paired these data with environmental data to evaluate sensitivity to climate-change stressors. Thermal tolerance decreased among successive stages, with larval fish exhibiting the highest tolerance and post-spawning adults having the lowest. Delta Smelt had limited capacity to increase tolerance through thermal acclimation, and comparisons with field temperature data revealed that juvenile tolerance limits are the closest to current environmental conditions, which may make this stage especially susceptible to future climate warming. Maximal water temperatures observed in situ exceeded tolerance limits of juveniles and adults. Although these temperature events are currently rare, if they increase in frequency as predicted, it could result in habitat loss at these locations despite other favourable conditions for Delta Smelt. In contrast, Delta Smelt tolerated salinities -spanning the range of expected environmental conditions for each ontogenetic stage, but salinity did impact survival in juvenile and adult stages in exposures over acute time scales. Our results underscore the importance of considering ontogeny and phenotypic plasticity in assessing the impacts of climate change, particularly for species adapted to spatially and -temporally heterogeneous environments.",2014,2,1,NA
Body size dictates physiological and behavioural responses to hypoxia and elevated water temperatures in Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii),"McPhee, Darren and Watson, Jabin R. and Harding, Doug J. and Prior, Andrea and Fawcett, James H. and Franklin, Craig E. and Cramp, Rebecca L.",CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/conphys/coac087,"Increasing drought frequency and duration pose a significant threat to fish species in dryland river systems. As ectotherms, fish thermal and hypoxia tolerances directly determine the capacity of species to persist in these environments during low flow periods when water temperatures are high and waterbodies become highly stratified. Chronic thermal stress can compound the impacts of acute hypoxic events on fish resulting in significant fish mortality; however, it is not known if all size classes are equally susceptible, or if the allometric scaling of physiological processes means some size classes are disproportionately affected. We investigated the physiological responses of Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii) over a four-fold body size range (0.2-3000 g) to acute changes in water temperature and oxygen concentration following 4 weeks of acclimation to representative spring (20 degrees C) and summer (28 degrees C) water temperatures. We recorded maximum thermal tolerance (CTmax), oxygen limited thermal tolerance (PCTmax), lowest tolerable oxygen level (as the oxygen level at which lose equilibrium; O-2,O-LOE), gill ventilation rates and aerial surface respiration threshold, blood oxygen transport capacity and lactate accumulation. Acclimation to elevated water temperatures improved thermal and hypoxia tolerance metrics across all size classes. However, body size significantly affected thermal and hypoxia responses. Small M. peelii were significantly less hypoxia tolerant than larger individuals, while larger fish were significantly less thermal tolerant than smaller fish. Hypoxia constrained thermal tolerance in M. peelii, with both small and large fish disproportionally compromised relative to mid-sized fish. Our findings indicate that both very small/young (larvae, fry, fingerlings) and very large/older M. peelii in dryland rivers are at significant risk from the combined impacts of a warming and drying climate and water extraction.

This species occurs only in several saline water systems in the southwestern USA and northern Mexico, where salinity is largely controlled by water-management practices. Consequently, understanding the osmoregulatory capacity of this species is important for their conservation. The lower acclimation limit of C. macularius in freshwater was found to be 2 mM Na+. Fish acclimated to 2 or 7 mM Na+ displayed similar Na+ uptake kinetics, with Km values of 4321 and 3672 mu M and V-max values of 4771 and 3602 nmol g(-1) h(-1), respectively. A series of experiments using pharmacological inhibitors indicated that Na+ uptake in C. macularius was not sensitive to bumetanide, metolazone, or phenamil. These results indicate the Na+-K+-2Cl(-) cotransporter, Na+-Cl- cotransporter, and the Na+ channel-H+-ATPase system are likely not to be involved in Na+ uptake at the apical membrane of fish gill ionocytes in fish acclimated to 2 or 7 mM Na+. However, Na+ uptake was sensitive to 1 x 10(-3) M amiloride (not 1 x 10(-4) or 1 x 10(-5) M), 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride (EIPA), and ethoxzolamide.

We assessed seasonal variation in critical thermal maximum and thermal safety margin of an imperilled fish, demonstrating that its physiological ability to manage warming temperatures depends on its recent thermal history. Organisms living in environments with oscillating temperatures may rely on plastic traits to sustain thermal tolerance during high temperature periods. Phenotypic plasticity in critical thermal maximum (CTmax) is a powerful thermoregulative strategy that enables organisms to adjust CTmax when ambient temperatures do not match thermal preference. Given that global temperatures are increasing at an unprecedented rate, identifying factors that affect the plastic response in CTmax can help predict how organisms are likely to respond to changes in their thermal landscape. Using an experimental thermal chamber in the field, we investigated the effect of short-term acclimation on the CTmax and thermal safety margin (TSM) of wild-caught redside dace, Clinostomus elongatus, (n = 197) in a northern population in Two Tree River, Ontario. Streamside CTmax trials were used to identify the maximum temperature at which redside dace maintain equilibrium, providing a powerful tool for understanding how thermal stress affects individual performance. CTmax and TSM of redside dace were sensitive to changes in temperature, regardless of season, suggesting that temperature pulses caused by climate change or urban activities can impose negative fitness consequences year round. Interestingly, an individual's recent thermal history was more influential to its thermal tolerance than the current ambient water temperature. While the CTmax of redside dace increased with body size, the effect of body size on TSM remains unclear based on our models. The results provide insight into the thermal performance of redside dace that, to date, has been difficult to assess due to the species' rarity and lack of suitable streamside protocols.",2020,8,1,NA

A rapid cold hardening (RCH) and supercooling capacity usually play crucial roles in survival during the overwintering period. This study identified a cryoprotectant as a RCH factor of S. exigua. Pre-exposure of S. exigua larvae to 4 degrees C significantly increased survival at -10 degrees C in all developmental stages from egg to adult. RCH was dependent on the duration of the pre-exposure period. RCH also significantly enhanced the supercooling capacity. Cryoprotectant analysis using HPLC showed that the pre-exposure treatment allowed the larvae to accumulate glycerol in the hemolymph. Two genes, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) and glycerol kinase (GK), were identified as being associated with glycerol biosynthesis, and were cloned from S. exigua larvae. Both GPDH and GK were expressed in all developmental stages of S. exigua. RNA interference (RNAi) of either GPDH or GK significantly inhibited glycerol accumulation in the hemolymph of S. exigua. Larvae treated with RNAi for GPDH or GK exhibited a significant decrease in RCH capacity. The glycerol accumulation in response to 4 degrees C appeared to be under the control of a humoral signal, because a ligation experiment prevented glycerol accumulation in the other half of the body. This study indicates that glycerol is a RCH factor of S. exigua and its synthesis is in response to low temperature via humoral mediation.",2013,216,22,4196-4203
Small heat shock protein Hsp67Bc plays a significant role in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> cold stress tolerance,"Malkeyeva, Dina and Kiseleva, Elena and Fedorova, Svetlana",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.219592,"Hsp67Bc in Drosophila melanogaster is a member of the small heat shock protein family, the main function of which is to prevent the aggregation of misfolded or damaged proteins. Hsp67Bc interacts with Starvin and Hsp23, which are known to be a part of the cold stress response in the fly during the recovery phase. In this study, we investigated the role of the Hsp67Bc gene in the cold stress response. We showed that in adult Drosophila, Hsp67Bc expression increases after cold stress and decreases after 1.5 h of recovery, indicating the involvement of Hsp67Bc in short-term stress recovery. We also implemented a deletion in the D. melanogaster Hsp67Bc gene using imprecise excision of a P-element, and analysed the cold tolerance of Hsp67Bc-null mutants at different developmental stages. We found that Hsp67Bc-null homozygous flies are viable and fertile but display varying cold stress tolerance throughout the stages of ontogenesis: the survival after cold stress is slightly impaired in late third instar larvae, unaffected in pupae, and notably affected in adult females. Moreover, the recovery from chill coma is delayed in Hsp67Bc-null adults of both sexes. In addition, the deletion in the Hsp67Bc gene caused more prominent up-regulation of Hsp70 following cold stress, suggesting the involvement of Hsp70 in compensation of the lack of the Hsp67Bc protein. Taken together, our results suggest that Hsp67Bc is involved in the recovery of flies from a comatose state and contributes to the protection of the fruit fly from cold stress.",2020,223,21,NA

As their exoskeleton is heavily reinforced with calcium, freshwater crustaceans have a high specific calcium requirement relative to other aquatic organisms. Daphnia, in particular, is an ideal crustacean for investigating the consequences of calcium decline because it is an abundant and important member of freshwater zooplankton communities. Although it has been established that adult and juvenile Daphnia have different tolerances to low ambient calcium as a result of their different life stage-specific calcium requirements, the consequences of declining calcium on embryonic development have never been investigated. Here, we describe the distribution of calcium in embryonic stages of D. magna and introduce a novel and easy to use staging scheme. We tested whether calcium can be traced from mothers to their offspring. Finally, we assessed the fitness consequences of maternal provisioning in limiting calcium environments. We found that while embryos require calcium for their development and moulting, they do not equilibrate with environmental calcium levels. Instead, we were able to trace calcium from mothers to their offspring. Furthermore, our data strongly suggest that females are faced with an allocation trade-off between providing calcium to their offspring and using it for growth and moulting. Together, these data provide novel insights into the consequences of calcium decline for freshwater zooplankton.",2015,218,13,2005-2014
Ontogeny can provide insight into the roles of natural and sexual selection in cricket cuticular hydrocarbon evolution,"Simmons, Leigh W. and Lovegrove, Maxine and Du, Xin Bob and Ren, Yonglin and Thomas, Melissa L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.244375,"The often complex cocktails of hydrocarbon compounds found on the cuticles of insects can serve both naturally and sexually selected functions, contributing to an individual's ability to withstand water loss and attract mating partners. However, whether natural and sexual selection act synergistically or antagonistically on a species' cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profile remains unclear. Here, we examined the ontogeny of the CHC profile in a species of cricket, Teleogryllus oceanicus, while manipulating humidity during development. We predicted that juvenile crickets should produce only those compounds that contribute to desiccation resistance, while those compounds contributing specifically to male attractiveness should be produced only at sexual maturity. Further, if attractive CHCs come at a cost to desiccation resistance as predicted by some models of sexual selection, then males reared under low humidity should be constrained to invest less in attractive CHCs. Crickets reared under low humidity produced more long-chain methyl-branched alkanes, alkenes and alkadienes than did crickets reared under high humidity. The abundance of n-alkanes was unaffected by humidity treatment. Sexual dimorphism in the CHC profile was not apparent until adult emergence and became exaggerated 10 days after emergence, when crickets were sexually mature. Males produced more of the same compounds that were increased in both sexes under low humidity, but the humidity treatment did not interact with sex in determining CHC abundance. The data suggest that CHC profiles which protect crickets from desiccation might have synergistic effects on male attractiveness, as there was no evidence to suggest males trade-off a CHC profile produced in response to low humidity for one associated with sexual signalling.",2022,225,15,NA

Using northern and southern subspecies of Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) that are locally adapted to different environmental temperatures, we assessed whether thermal acclimation altered liver mitochondrial respiratory capacity or the composition and amount of IMM. We measured changes in phospholipid headgroups and headgroup-specific fatty acid (FA) remodeling, and used respirometry to assess mitochondrial respiratory capacity. Acclimation to 5 degrees C and 33 degrees C altered mitochondrial respiratory capacity in both subspecies. Northern F. heteroclitus exhibited greater mitochondrial respiratory capacity across acclimation temperatures, consistent with previously observed subspecies differences in whole-organism aerobic metabolism. Mitochondrial phospholipids were altered following thermal acclimation, and the direction of these changes was largely consistent between subspecies. These effects were primarily driven by remodeling of specific phospholipid classes and were associated with shifts in metabolic phenotypes. There were also differences in membrane composition between subspecies that were driven largely by differences in phospholipid classes. Changes in respiratory capacity between subspecies and with acclimation were largely but not completely accounted for by alterations in the amount of IMM. Taken together, these results support a role for changes in liver mitochondrial function in the ectothermic response to thermal stress during both acclimation and adaptation, and implicate lipid remodeling as a mechanism contributing to these changes.",2018,221,7,NA
A thermal performance curve perspective explains decades of disagreements over how air temperature affects the flight metabolism of honey bees,"Glass, Jordan R. and Harrison, Jon F.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.246926,"While multiple studies have shown that honey bees and some other flying insects lower their flight metabolic rates when flying at high air temperatures, critics have suggested such patterns result from poor experimental methods as, theoretically, air temperature should not appreciably affect aerodynamic force requirements. Here, we show that apparently contradictory studies can be reconciled by considering the thermal performance curve of flight muscle. We show that prior studies that found no effects of air temperature on flight metabolism of honey bees achieved flight muscle temperatures that were near or on equal, opposite sides of the thermal performance curve. Honey bees vary their wing kinematics and metabolic heat production to thermoregulate, and how air temperature affects the flight metabolic rate of honey bees is predictable using a non-linear thermal performance perspective of honey bee flight muscle.",2024,227,7,NA
Defects in mating behavior and tail morphology are the primary cause of sterility in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> males at high temperature,"Nett, Emily M. and Sepulveda, Nicholas B. and Petrella, Lisa N.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.208041,"Reproduction is a fundamental imperative of all forms of life. For all the advantages sexual reproduction confers, it has a deeply conserved flaw: it is temperature sensitive. As temperatures rise, fertility decreases. Across species, male fertility is particularly sensitive to elevated temperature. Previously, we have shown in the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that all males are fertile at 20 degrees C, but almost all males have lost fertility at 27 degrees C. Male fertility is dependent on the production of functional sperm, successful mating and transfer of sperm, and successful fertilization post-mating. To determine how male fertility is impacted by elevated temperature, we analyzed these aspects of male reproduction at 27 degrees C in three wild-type strains of C. elegans: JU1171, LKC34 and N2. We found no effect of elevated temperature on the number of immature non-motile spermatids formed. There was only a weak effect of elevated temperature on sperm activation. In stark contrast, there was a strong effect of elevated temperature on male mating behavior, male tail morphology and sperm transfer such that males very rarely completed mating successfully when exposed to 27 degrees C. Therefore, we propose a model where elevated temperature reduces male fertility as a result of the negative impacts of temperature on the somatic tissues necessary for mating. Loss of successful mating at elevated temperature overrides any effects that temperature may have on the germline or sperm cells.",2019,222,24,NA

Local and hormonal neuromodulation and sensory inputs into these central pattern generator circuits play a significant role in an animal's response to perturbations, but are usually lost or removed during in vitro studies. To examine simultaneously the in vivo motor output of the crustacean heart and pyloric rhythms, we used photoplethysmography. In the population measured (n=49), the heart rhythm frequency ranged from 0.3 to 2.3 Hz. The pyloric rhythm varied from 0.2 to 1.6 Hz. We observed a weak correlation between the frequencies of the heart and pyloric rhythms. During multiple hour-long recordings, many animals held at a controlled temperature showed strong inhibitory bouts in which the heart decreased in frequency or become quiescent and the pyloric rhythm decreased in frequency. We measured the simultaneous responses of the rhythms to temperature ramps by heating or cooling the saline bath while recording both the heart and pyloric muscle movements. Q(10), critical temperature (temperature at which muscle function is compromised) and changes in frequency were calculated for each of the rhythms tested.

The role of carbonic anhydrase-mediated tissue oxygen extraction in a marine teleost acclimated to hypoxia,"Dichiera, Angelina M. and Negrete Jr, Benjamin and Ackerly, Kerri Lynn and Esbaugh, Andrew J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.244474,"With the growing prevalence of hypoxia (O-2 levels <= 2 mg l(-1)) in aquatic and marine ecosystems, there is increasing interest in the adaptive mechanisms fish may employ to better their performance in stressful environments. Here, we investigated the contribution of a proposed strategy for enhancing tissue O-2 extraction - plasma -accessible carbonic anhydrase (CA-IV) - under hypoxia in a species of estuarine fish (red drum, Sciaenops ocellatus) that thrives in fluctuating habitats. We predicted that hypoxia-acclimated fish would increase the prevalence of CA-IV in aerobically demanding tissues to confer more efficient tissue O-2 extraction. Furthermore, we predicted the phenotypic changes to tissue O-2 extraction that occur with hypoxia acclimation may improve respiratory and swim performance under 100\% O-2 conditions (i.e. normoxia) when compared with performance in fish that have not been acclimated to hypoxia. Interestingly, there were no significant differences in relative CA-IV mRNA expression, protein abundance or enzyme activity between the two treatments, suggesting CA-IV function is maintained under hypoxia. Likewise, respiratory performance of hypoxia-acclimated fish was similar to that of control fish when tested in normoxia. Critical swim speed (Licrit) was significantly higher in hypoxia-acclimated fish but translated to marginal ecological benefits with an increase of similar to 0.3 body lengths per second. Instead, hypoxia-acclimated fish may have relied more heavily on anaerobic metabolism during their swim trials, utilizing burst swimming 1.5 times longer than control fish. While the maintenance of CA-IV may still be an important contributor for hypoxia tolerance, our evidence suggests hypoxia-acclimated red drum are using other mechanisms to cope in an O-2-depleted environment.",2022,225,21,NA
"Normoxic limitation of maximal oxygen consumption rate, aerobic scope and cardiac performance in exhaustively exercised rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>)","McArley, Tristan J. and Morgenroth, Daniel and Zena, Lucas A. and Ekstrom, Andreas T. and Sandblom, Erik",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.242614,"In fish, maximum O-2 consumption rate ((M) over dot(O2,max)) and aerobic scope can be expanded following exhaustive exercise in hyperoxia; however, the mechanisms explaining this are yet to be identified. Here, in exhaustively exercised rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), we assessed the influence of hyperoxia on (M) over dot(O2,max), aerobic scope, cardiac function and blood parameters to address this knowledge gap. Relative to normoxia, (M) over dot(O2,max) was 33\% higher under hyperoxia, and this drove a similar increase in aerobic scope. Cardiac output was significantly elevated under hyperoxia at (M) over dot(O2,max) because of increased stroke volume, indicating that hyperoxia released a constraint on cardiac contractility apparent with normoxia. Thus, hyperoxia improved maximal cardiac performance, thereby enhancing tissue O-2 delivery and allowing a higher (M) over dot(O2,max) Venous blood O-2 partial pressure (PvO(2)) was elevated in hyperoxia at (M) over dot(O2,max), suggesting a contribution of improved luminal O-2 supply in enhanced cardiac contractility. Additionally, despite reduced haemoglobin and higher PvO(2), hyperoxia treated fish retained a higher arterio-venous O-2 content difference at (M) over dot(O2,max). This may have been possible because of hyperoxia offsetting declines in arterial oxygenation that are known to occur following exhaustive exercise in normoxia. If this occurs, increased contractility at (M) over dot(O2,max) with hyperoxia may also relate to an improved O-2 supply to the compact myocardium via the coronary artery. Our findings show (M) over dot(O2,max) and aerobic scope may be limited in normoxia following exhaustive exercise as a result of constrained maximal cardiac performance and highlight the need to further examine whether or not exhaustive exercise protocols are suitable for eliciting (M) over dot(O2,max) and estimating aerobic scope in rainbow trout.",2021,224,15,NA
Cardiac performance and heat shock response variation related to shell colour morphs in the mudflat snail <i>Batillaria</i> <i>attramentaria</i>,"Han, Guodong and Du, Yinghui and Du, Lina and Qu, Furui and Zhao, Zhenjun",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.244796,"Gastropods exhibit remarkable variation in shell colour within and among populations, but the function of shell colour is often not clear. In the present study, body temperature in the field and physiological and transcriptomic responses to thermal stress were investigated in different shell colour morphs of the mudflat snail Batillaria attramentaria. Using biomimetic models, we found that the body temperature of snails with a dark unbanded shell (D-type morph) was slightly higher than that of snails with a white line on the upper side of each whorl (UL-type morph) when exposed to sunlight. Despite no differences in upper lethal temperature among shell colour morphs, their Arrhenius breakpoint temperature (ABT) for cardiac thermal performance differed significantly, and the ABT of snails with the D-type morph was higher than that of snails with the UL-type morph. Transcriptomic analysis showed that D-type snails exhibit higher levels of four heat shock proteins (HSPs) than UL-type snails at control temperature. The unfolded protein response was activated in UL-type snails but not in D-type snails under moderate thermal stress. And 11 HSPs showed an increase in UL-type snails in contrast to 1 HSP in D-type snails, suggesting a `preparative defence' strategy of the heat shock response in D-type snails under moderate thermal stress. When exposed to sublethal temperature, eight molecular chaperones were uniquely upregulated in D-type snails, suggesting these genes may allow D-type snails to improve their cardiac thermal tolerance. Our results suggest that the preparative defence strategies and higher ABT for cardiac thermal performance may allow the dark shell snails to adapt to rapid and stronger thermal stress in the field.",2022,225,21,NA

We compared resting O-2 consumption rate ((M)over dot(O2)), and various indices of hypoxia tolerance {[}critical O-2 tension (P-crit), regulation index (RI), O-2 tension (PO2) at loss of equilibrium (P-LOE) and time to LOE (t(LOE)) at 0.6 kPa O-2] in Fundulus confluentus, Fundulus diaphanus, Fundulus heteroclitus, Fundulus rathbuni, Lucania goodei and Lucania parva. We examined the effects of chronic (28 days) exposure to constant hypoxia (2 kPa) or nocturnal intermittent hypoxia (12 h normoxia:12 h hypoxia) in a subset of species. Some species exhibited a two-breakpoint model in (M)over dot(O2) caused by early, modest declines in (M)over dot(O2) in moderate hypoxia. We found that hypoxia tolerance varied appreciably across species: F. confluentus was the most tolerant (lowest P-LOE and P-crit, longest t(LOE)), whereas F. rathbuni and F. diaphanus were the least tolerant. However, there was not a consistent pattern of interspecific variation for different indices of hypoxia tolerance, with or without taking phylogenetic relatedness into account, probably because these different indices are underlain by partially distinct mechanisms. Hypoxia acclimation generally improved hypoxia tolerance, but the magnitude of plasticity and responsiveness to different hypoxia patterns varied interspecifically. Our results therefore suggest that hypoxia tolerance is a complex trait that is best appreciated by considering multiple indices of tolerance.",2020,223,4,NA

However, how the brains of these subterranean mammals handle acute in vivo hypoxia is poorly understood. This study is the first to examine the molecular response to low oxygen in six different species of hypoxia-tolerant mole-rats from sub-Saharan Africa. Protein carbonylation, a known marker of DNA damage (hydroxy2'-deoxyguanosine), and antioxidant capacity did not change following hypoxia but HIF-1 protein levels increased significantly in the brains of two species. Nearly 30 miRNAs known to play roles in hypoxia tolerance were differentially regulated in a species-specific manner. The miRNAs exhibiting the strongest response to low oxygen stress inhibit apoptosis and regulate neuroinflammation, likely providing neuroprotection. A principal component analysis (PCA) using a subset of the molecular targets assessed herein revealed differences between control and hypoxic groups for two solitary species (Georychus capensis and Bathyergus suillus), which are ecologically adapted to a normoxic environment, suggesting a heightened sensitivity to hypoxia relative to species that may experience hypoxia more regularly in nature. By contrast, all molecular data were included in the PCA to detect a difference between control and hypoxic populations of eusocial Heterocephalus glaber, indicating they may require many lower-fold changes in signaling pathways to adapt to low oxygen settings. Finally, none of the Cryptomys hottentotus subspecies showed a statistical difference between control and hypoxic groups, presumably due to hypoxia tolerance derived from environmental pressures associated with a subterranean and social lifestyle.",2020,223,9,NA

For these experiments, we used fish derived from a refuge population of Devils Hole pupfish (Cyprinodon diabolis). Measurement of routine oxygen consumption ((V)over dotO(2), routine) revealed some 33 degrees C-acclimated fish (10\% of 295 assayed fish) periodically exhibited periods of no measurable oxygen consumption despite available ambient oxygen tensions that were above the critical PO2. We call this phenomenon paradoxical anaerobism. The longest observed continuous bout with no oxygen consumption was 149 min, although typical bouts were much shorter. Fish maintained normal posture and ventilation rate (>230 ventilations per minute) during paradoxical anaerobism. Fish rarely demonstrated a compensatory increase in oxygen use following a period of paradoxical anaerobism. In contrast, only one out of 262 sampled fish acclimated at 28 degrees C spontaneously demonstrated paradoxical anaerobism. Muscle lactate concentration was not elevated during periods of paradoxical anaerobism. However, the amount of ethanol released by the 33 degrees C-acclimated fish was 7.3 times greater than that released by the 28 degrees C acclimation group, suggesting ethanol may be used as an alternative end product of anaerobic metabolism. Exposure to exogenous ethanol, in concentrations as low as 0.1\%, produced periods of paradoxical anaerobism even in 28 degrees C acclimated fish.",2015,218,23,3739-3745
Regulation of succinate-fuelled mitochondrial respiration in liver and skeletal muscle of hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels,"Brown, Jason C. L. and Chung, Dillon J. and Cooper, Alex N. and Staples, James F.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.078519,"Hibernating ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) alternate between two distinct metabolic states throughout winter: torpor, during which metabolic rate (MR) and body temperature (T-b) are considerably suppressed, and interbout euthermia (IBE), during which MR and T-b briefly return to euthermic levels. Previous studies showed suppression of succinate-fuelled respiration during torpor in liver and skeletal muscle mitochondria; however, these studies used only a single, saturating succinate concentration. Therefore, they could not address whether mitochondrial metabolic suppression occurs under physiological substrate concentrations or whether differences in the kinetics of mitochondrial responses to changing substrate concentration might also contribute to mitochondrial metabolic regulation during torpor. The present study confirmed that succinate oxidation is reduced during torpor in liver and skeletal muscle at 37 and 10 degrees C over a 100-fold range of succinate concentrations. At 37 degrees C, this suppression resulted from inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which had a greater affinity for oxaloacetate (an SDH inhibitor) during torpor. At 10 degrees C, SDH was not inhibited, suggesting that SDH inhibition initiates but does not maintain mitochondrial suppression during torpor. Moreover, in both liver and skeletal muscle, mitochondria from torpid animals maintained relatively higher respiration rates at low succinate concentrations, which reduces the extent of energy savings that can be achieved during torpor, but may also maintain mitochondrial oxidative capacity above some lower critical threshold, thereby preventing cellular and/or mitochondrial injury during torpor and facilitating rapid recruitment of oxidative capacity during arousal.",2013,216,9,1736-1743

The sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) encounters considerable variations in environmental oxygen availability, and is an interesting model for studying the effects of hypoxia on fish cardiorespiratory function. We investigated how in vivo hypoxia acclimation (6 months at 40\% then 3 weeks at 20\% air saturation) and in vitro anoxia-reoxygenation affected sablefish cardiac mitochondrial respiration and reactive oxygen species (ROS) release rates using high-resolution fluorespirometry. Further, we investigated how hypoxia acclimation affected the sensitivity of mitochondrial respiration to nitric oxide (NO), and compared mitochondrial lipid and fatty acid (FA) composition between groups. Hypoxia acclimation did not alter mitochondrial coupled or uncoupled respiration, or respiratory control ratio, ROS release rates, P-50 or superoxide dismutase activity. However, it increased citrate synthase activity (by similar to 20\%), increased the sensitivity of mitochondrial respiration to NO inhibition (i.e., the NO IC50 was 25\% lower), and enhanced the recovery of respiration (by 21\%) and reduced ROS release rates (by 25-30\%) post-anoxia. In addition, hypoxia acclimation altered mitochondrial FA composition {[}increasing arachidonic acid (20:4 omega 6) and eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5 omega 3) proportions by 11 and 14\%, respectively], and SIMPER analysis revealed that the phospholipid:sterol ratio was the largest contributor (24\%) to the dissimilarity between treatments. Overall, these results suggest that hypoxia acclimation may protect sablefish cardiac bioenergetic function during or after periods of O-2 limitation, and that this may be related to alterations in mitochondrial sensitivity to NO and to adaptive changes in membrane composition (fluidity).",2019,222,22,NA

Southern leopard frogs, Rana sphenocephala, are known to become infected with this pathogen, yet they are considered `of least concern' for declines due to chytridiomycosis. Previous studies have shown that R. sphenocephala secretes four antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) onto their skin which may play an important role in limiting susceptibility to chytridiomycosis. Here, we examined (1) the effects of temperature and AMP depletion on infections with Bd and (2) the effects of temperature and Bd infection on the capacity to secrete AMPs in juvenile leopard frogs. Pathogen burden and mortality were greater in frogs exposed to Bd at low temperature but did not increase following monthly AMP depletion. Both low temperature and Bd exposure reduced the capacity of juvenile frogs to restore peptides after monthly depletions. Frogs held at 14 degrees C were poorly able to restore peptides in comparison with those at 26 degrees C. Frogs held at 26 degrees C were better able to restore their peptides, but when exposed to Bd, this capacity was significantly reduced. These results strongly support the hypothesis that both colder temperatures and Bd infection impair the capacity of juvenile frogs to produce and secrete AMPs, an important component of their innate defense against chytrid fungi and other pathogens. Thus, in the face of unpredictable climate changes and enzootic pathogens, assessments of disease risk should consider the potential for effects of environmental variation and pathogen exposure on the quality of host defenses.",2019,222,18,NA

Whether turtles avoid oxidative tissue damage because of an absence of mitochondrial superoxide production upon reoxygenation, or because the turtle heart is particularly protected against this damage, is unclear. Here, we investigated whether there was an increase in mitochondrial O2 \& BULL;- production upon the reoxygenation of anoxic red-eared slider turtle hearts in vivo and in vitro. This was done by measuring the production of H2O2, the dismutation product of O2 \& BULL;-, using the mitochondria targeted mass-spectrometric probe in vivo MitoB, while in parallel assessing changes in the metabolites driving mitochondrial O2 \& BULL;- production, succinate, ATP and ADP levels during anoxia, and H2O2 consumption and production rates of isolated heart mitochondria. We found that there was no excess production of in vivo H2O2 during 1 h of reoxygenation in turtles after 3 h anoxia at room temperature, suggesting that turtle hearts most likely do not suffer oxidative injury after anoxia because their mitochondria produce no excess O2 \& BULL;- upon reoxygenation. Instead, our data support the conclusion that both the low levels of succinate accumulation and the maintenance of ADP levels in the anoxic turtle heart are key factors in preventing the surge of O2 \& BULL;- production upon reoxygenation.",2023,226,9,NA
Metabolic rate increases with acclimation temperature and is associated with mitochondrial function in some tissues of threespine stickleback,"Cominassi, Louise and Ressel, Kirsten N. and Brooking, Allison A. and Marbacher, Patrick and Ransdell-Green, Eleanor C. and O'Brien, Kristin M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.244659,"The metabolic rate (M?O2) of eurythermal fishes changes in response to temperature, yet it is unclear how changes in mitochondrial function contribute to changes in M?O2.

Threespine stickleback were acclimated to 5, 12 and 20 degrees C for 7 to 21 weeks.

SMR, MMR and AAS increased with acclimation temperature, along with rates of mitochondrial phosphorylating respiration in all tissues. Low SMR and MMR at 5 degrees C were associated with low or undetectable rates of mitochondrial complex II activity and a greater reliance on complex I activity in liver, oxidative skeletal muscle and heart. SMR was positively correlated with cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) activity in liver and oxidative muscle, but not mitochondrial proton leak, whereas MMR was positively correlated with CCO activity in liver.

We therefore tested for a relationship between plasma corticosterone (CORT; ln transformed) andmetabolic rate (MR; measured using indirect calorimetry) in a between- and within-individual design in captive zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) of both sexes. In each individual, CORT and MR were measured at two different temperature levels: `warm' (22 degrees C) and `cold' (12 degrees C). CORT and MR were both increased in colder compared with warmer conditions within individuals, but also across individuals. At the between- individual level, we found a positive relationship between CORT and MR, with an accelerating slope towards higher MR and CORT values. In contrast, the within-individual changes in CORT and MR in response to colder conditions were linearly correlated between individuals. The CORT-MR relationship did not differ between the sexes. Our results illustrate the importance of including variation at different levels to better understand physiological modulation. Furthermore, our findings support the interpretation of CORT variation as an indicator of metabolic needs.",2017,220,23,4426-4431

Because both summit (M-sum, maximum thermoregulatory metabolic rate) and maximum (MMR, maximum exercise metabolic rate) metabolic rates are functions of skeletal muscle activity, correlations between these measurements and their mechanistic underpinnings might occur. To examine whether such correlations occur, we measured the effects of experimental cold and exercise training protocols for 3 weeks on body (M-b) and muscle (M-pec) masses, basalmetabolic rate(BMR), M-sum, MMR, pectoralism RNA and protein expression for myostatin, and mRNA expression of TLL-1 and TLL-2 (metalloproteinase activators of myostatin) in house sparrows (Passer domesticus). Both training protocols increased M-sum, MMR, M-b and M-pec, but BMR increased with cold training and decreased with exercise training. No significant differences occurred for pectoralis myostatin mRNA expression, but cold and exercise increased the expression of TLL-1 and TLL-2. Pectoralis myostatin protein levels were generally reduced for both training groups. These data clearly demonstrate cross-training effects of cold and exercise in birds, and are consistent with a role for myostatin in increasing pectoralis muscle mass and driving organismal increases in metabolic capacities.",2015,218,14,2190-2200

The long-lived ocean quahog, Arctica islandica, is known for its hypoxia tolerance associated with metabolic rate depression, yet the mechanisms that sustain mitochondrial function during oxygen fluctuations are not well understood. We used top-down metabolic control analysis (MCA) to determine aerobic capacity and control over oxygen flux in the mitochondria of quahogs exposed to short-term hypoxia (24 h <0.01\% O-2) and subsequent reoxygenation (1.5 h 21\% O-2) compared with normoxic control animals (21\% O-2). We demonstrated that flux capacity of the substrate oxidation and proton leak subsystems were not affected by hypoxia, while the capacity of the phosphorylation subsystem was enhanced during hypoxia associated with a depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane. Reoxygenation decreased the oxygen flux capacity of all three mitochondrial subsystems. Control over oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) respiration was mostly exerted by substrate oxidation regardless of H-R stress, whereas control by the proton leak subsystem of LEAK respiration increased during hypoxia and returned to normoxic levels during reoxygenation. During hypoxia, reactive oxygen species (ROS) efflux was elevated in the LEAK state, whereas it was suppressed in the OXPHOS state. Mitochondrial ROS efflux returned to normoxic control levels during reoxygenation. Thus, mitochondria of A. islandica appear robust to hypoxia by maintaining stable substrate oxidation and upregulating phosphorylation capacity, but remain sensitive to reoxygenation. This mitochondrial phenotype might reflect adaptation of A. islandica to environments with unpredictable oxygen fluctuations and its behavioural preference for low oxygen levels.",2021,224,21,NA

In the heart, moult stage had no effect on mTOR signalling gene mRNA levels; only Mm-Rheb, Mm-S6K and Mm-mTOR mRNA levels were higher in intermoult animals at 10 degrees C. These data suggest that temperature compensation of neuropeptide and mTOR signalling gene expression in the eyestalk ganglia and Y-organ contributes to regulate moulting in the 10 to 20 degrees C range. The limited warm compensation in the heart may contribute to mortality at temperatures above 20 degrees C.",2018,221,21,NA
Diel cycling hypoxia enhances hypoxia tolerance in rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>): evidence of physiological and metabolic plasticity,"Williams, Kenneth J. and Cassidy, Alicia A. and Verhille, Christine E. and Lamarre, Simon G. and MacCormack, Tyson J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.206045,"Many fish naturally encounter a daily cycle of hypoxia, but it is unclear whether this exposure hardens hypoxia-intolerant fish to future hypoxia or leads to accumulated stress and death. The rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is a putatively hypoxia-sensitive species found in rivers and estuaries that may routinely experience hypoxic events. Trout were exposed to one of four 135 h treatments in a swim-tunnel respirometer: (1) air-saturated control (20.7 kPa P-O2); (2) diel cycling O-2 (20.7-4.2 kPa P-O2 over 24 h); (3) acute hypoxia (130 h at 20.7 kPa P-O2 followed by 5 h at 4.2 kPa P-O2); and (4) the mean oxygen tension (12.4 kPa P-O2) experienced by the diel cycled fish. Some responses were similar in diel O-2 cycled and mean P(O2 )treated fish, but overall, exposure to ecologically representative diel hypoxia cycles improved hypoxia tolerance. Diel hypoxia-induced protective responses included increased inducible HSP70 concentration and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, as well as reduced plasma cortisol. Acclimation to diel hypoxia allowed metabolic rates to decline during hypoxia, reduced oxygen debt following subsequent exposures, and allowed fish to return to an anabolic phenotype. The data demonstrate that acute diel cycling hypoxia improves hypoxia tolerance in previously intolerant fish through the activation of cellular protective mechanisms and a reduction in metabolic O-2 requirements.",2019,222,14,NA
Tide-related biological rhythm in the oxygen consumption rate of ghost shrimp (<i>Neotrypaea uncinata</i>),"Leiva, Felix P. and Niklitschek, Edwin J. and Paschke, Kurt and Gebauer, Paulina and Urbina, Mauricio A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.133785,"The effects of tidal height (high and low), acclimation to laboratory conditions (days in captivity) and oxygen level (hypoxia and normoxia) were evaluated in the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of the ghost shrimp Neotrypaea uncinata. We evaluated the hypothesis that N. uncinata reduces its OCR during low tide and increases it during high tide, regardless of oxygen level or acclimation. Additionally, the existence of an endogenous rhythm in OCR was explored, and we examined whether it synchronized with tidal, diurnal or semidiurnal cycles. Unexpectedly, high OCRs were observed at low tide, during normoxia, in non-acclimated animals. Results from a second, longerexperiment under normoxic conditions suggested the presence of a tide-related metabolic rhythm, a response pattern not yet demonstrated for a burrowing decapod. Although rhythms persisted for only 2 days after capture, their period of 12.8 h closely matched the semidiurnal tidal cycle that ghost shrimp confront inside their burrows.",2016,219,13,1957-1960
How does mitochondrial function relate to thermogenic capacity and basal metabolic rate in small birds?,"Milbergue, Myriam S. and Vezina, Francois and Desrosiers, Veronique and Blier, Pierre U.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.242612,"We investigated the role of mitochondrial function in the avian thermoregulatory response to a cold environment. Using black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) acclimated to cold (-10 degrees C) and thermoneutral (27 degrees C) temperatures, we expected to observe an upregulation of pectoralis muscle and liver respiratory capacity that would be visible in mitochondrial adjustments in cold-acclimated birds. We also predicted that these adjustments would correlate with thermogenic capacity (M-sum) and basal metabolic rate (BMR). Using tissue high-resolution respirometry, mitochondrial performance was measured as respiration rate triggered by proton leak and the activity of complex I (OXPHOSCI) and complex I+II (OXPHOSCI+CII) in the liver and pectoralis muscle. The activity of citrate synthase (CS) and cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) was also used as a marker of mitochondrial density. We found 20\% higher total CS activity in the whole pectoralis muscle and 39\% higher total CCO activity in the whole liver of cold-acclimated chickadees relative to that of birds kept at thermoneutrality. This indicates that cold acclimation increased overall aerobic capacity of these tissues. Msum correlated positively with mitochondrial proton leak in the muscle of cold-acclimated birds while BMR correlated with OXPHOSCI in the liver with a pattern that differed between treatments. Consequently, this study revealed a divergence in mitochondrial metabolism between thermal acclimation states in birds. Some functions of the mitochondria covary with thermogenic capacity and basal maintenance costs in patterns that are dependent on temperature and body mass.",2022,225,12,NA
Severe thermoregulatory deficiencies in mice with a deletion in the titin gene <i>TTN</i>,"Miyano, Carissa A. and Orezzoli, Santiago F. and Buck, C. Loren and Nishikawa, Kiisa C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.198564,"Muscular dystrophy with myositis (mdm) mice carry a deletion in the N2A region of the gene for the muscle protein titin (TTN), shiver at low frequency, fail to maintain body temperatures (T-b) at ambient temperatures (T-a) <34 degrees C, and have reduced body mass and active muscle stiffness in vivo compared with wild-type (WT) siblings. Impaired shivering thermogenesis (ST) could be due to the mutated titin protein causing more compliant muscles. We hypothesized that non-shivering thermogenesis (NST) is impaired. To characterize the response to cold exposure, we measured T-b and metabolic rate (MR) of WT and mdm mice at four nominal temperatures: 20, 24, 29 and 34 degrees C. Subsequently, we stimulated NST with noradrenaline. Manipulation of T-a revealed an interaction between genotype and MR: mdm mice had higher MRs at 29 degrees C and lower MRs at 24 degrees C compared with WT mice. NST capacity was lower in mdm mice than in WT mice. Using MR data from a previous study, we compared MR of mdm mice with MR of Perognathus longimembris, a mouse species of similar body mass. Our results indicated low MR and reduced NST of mdm mice. These were more pronounced than differences between mdm and WT mice owing to body mass effects on MR and capacity for NST. Correcting MR using Q(10 )showed that mdm mice had lower MRs than size-matched P. longimembris, indicating that mutated N2A titin causes severe thermoregulatory defects at all levels. Direct effects of the titin mutation lead to lower shivering frequency. Indirect effects likely lead to a lower capacity for NST and increased thermal conductance through decreased body size.",2019,222,9,NA
The roles of tissue nitrate reductase activity and myoglobin in securing nitric oxide availability in deeply hypoxic crucian carp,"Hansen, Marie N. and Lundberg, Jon O. and Filice, Mariacristina and Fago, Angela and Christensen, Nanna M.

Interestingly, anoxia-tolerant lower vertebrates possess an intrinsic ability to increase intracellular nitrite concentration during anoxia in tissues with high myoglobin and mitochondria content, such as the heart. Here, we tested the hypothesis that red and white skeletal muscles develop different nitrite levels in crucian carp exposed to deep hypoxia and assessed whether this correlates with myoglobin concentration. We also tested whether liver, muscle and heart tissue possess nitrate reductase activity that supplies nitrite to the tissues during severe hypoxia. Crucian carp exposed to deep hypoxia (1< P-O2 < 3 mmHg) for 1 day increased nitrite in red musculature to more than double the value in normoxic fish, while nitrite was unchanged in white musculature. There was a highly significant positive correlation between tissue concentrations of nitrite and nitros(yl) ated compounds. Myoglobin levels were 7 times higher in red than in white musculature, but there was no clear correlation between nitrite and myoglobin levels. Finally, we found a low but significant nitrate reductase activity in liver and white muscle, but not in cardiomyocytes. Nitrate reduction was inhibited by allopurinol, showing that it was partly catalyzed by xanthine oxidoreductase.",2016,219,24,3875-3883
Intraspecific variation in sensitivity to food availability and temperature-induced phenotypic plasticity in the rotifer <i>Keratella cochlearis</i>,"Ramos-Rodriguez, Eloisa and Moreno, Emilio and Maria Conde-Porcuna, Jose",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.209676,"Organisms with wide environmentally induced morphological plasticity and cosmopolitan distribution, e.g. the common freshwater rotifer Keratella cochlearis, are ideal models to study the evolution of plastic polymorphisms and the capacity of zooplankton to adapt to local selection conditions. We investigated population-level differences (population-by-environment interaction) in sensitivity to food availability and temperature-induced phenotypic plasticity between two clones of K. cochlearis isolated from neighboring populations in Ruidera Natural Park (Spain) with different trophic statuses: Tinaja lake (mesotrophic) and Cueva Morenilla lake (eutrophic). Using common-garden experiments, each clone proved to have a different sensitivity to food availability, with substantial phenotypic differences between them. When rotifers grew at moderate temperature (15.6 degrees C), low food levels were more efficiently used by the Tinaja versus Cueva Morenilla clone, whereas high food levels were more efficiently used by the Cueva Morenilla versus Tinaja clone. The posterior spine was much longer and the lorica wider in the Tinaja versus Cueva Morenilla clone, with no difference in lorica length. Phylogenetic analysis based on cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene sequences showed that the two populations have the same haplotype. This is the first study to show possible local adaptation by a rotifer species to habitats that consistently differ in food availability. We also detected an intriguing deviation from the expected negative relationship between posterior spine length and temperature. Our experimental results indicate that intermediate temperatures may activate the gene responsible for spine elongation in K. cochlearis. This suggests that rotifers in nature could use water temperature as proxy signal of a change in predation risk before defense is needed.",2020,223,7,NA
Nitric oxide metabolites during anoxia and reoxygenation in the anoxia-tolerant vertebrate <i>Trachemys scripta</i>,"Jensen, Frank B. and Hansen, Marie N. and Montesanti, Gabriella and Wang, Tobias",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.093179,"Moderate elevations of nitrite and nitric oxide (NO) protect mammalian tissues against ischemia (anoxia)-reperfusion damage by inhibiting mitochondrial electron transport complexes and reducing the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon reoxygenation. Crucian carp appear to exploit this mechanism by upregulating nitrite and other nitrite/NO metabolites (S-nitroso and iron-nitrosyl compounds) in several tissues when exposed to anoxia. We investigated whether this is a common strategy amongst anoxiatolerant vertebrates by evaluating NO metabolites in red-eared slider turtles during long-term (9 days) anoxia and subsequent reoxygenation at low temperature, a situation naturally encountered by turtles in ice-covered ponds. We also measured glutathione in selected tissues and assessed the impact of anoxia on electrolyte status. Anoxia induced major increases in {[}nitrite] in the heart, pectoral muscle and red blood cells, while {[}nitrite] was maintained unaltered in brain and liver. Concomitantly, the concentrations of Snitroso and iron-nitrosyl compounds increased, showing that nitrite was used to produce NO and to S-nitrosate cellular molecules during anoxia. The changes were gradually reversed during reoxygenation (1 h and 24 h), testifying that the processes were reversible. The increased NO bioavailability occurred in the absence of NO synthase activity (due to global anoxia) and may involve mobilization of internal/external nitrite reservoirs. Our data support the theory that anoxic upregulation of nitrite and other NO metabolites could be a general cytoprotective strategy amongst anoxia-tolerant vertebrates. The possible mechanisms of nitrite-derived NO and S-nitrosation in protecting cells from destructive Ca2+ influx during anoxia and in limiting ROS formation during reoxygenation are discussed.",2014,217,3,423-431
Evaluating the role of NRF-1 in the regulation of the goldfish <i>COX4-1</i> gene in response to temperature,"Gao, Ge and Moyes, Christopher D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.141184,"Cold acclimation in fish typically increases muscle mitochondrial enzymes. In mammals, stressors that increase mitochondrial content are mediated though transcriptional regulators, including nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1). Focusing on the goldfish gene for cytochrome c oxidase (COX) subunit 4-1, we analysed the regulatory regions in various contexts to identify a mechanistic link between NRF-1 and cold-induced mitochondrial proliferation. Promoter analysis implicated two putative NRF-1 sites: one in the proximal promoter and a second in exon 1, which encodes the 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR). Transfection into mouse myoblasts showed that deletion of a region that included the proximal NRF-1 site reduced promoter activity by 30\%; however, mutagenesis of the specific sequence had no effect. Thermal sensitivity analyses performed in rainbow trout gonadal fibroblasts (RTG-2) showed no effect of temperature (4 vs 19 degrees C) on reporter gene expression. Likewise, reporters injected into muscle of thermally acclimated goldfish (4 vs 26 degrees C) showed no elevation in expression. There was no difference in thermal responses of COX4-1 promoter reporters constructed from homologous regions of eurythermal goldfish and stenothermal zebrafish genes. NRF-1 chromatin immunoprecipitation of thermally acclimated goldfish muscle showed no temperature effect on NRF-1 binding to either the proximal promoter or 5'-UTR. It remains possible that the cold-induced upregulation of COX4-1 expression is a result of NRF-1 binding to distal regulatory regions or through indirect effects on other transcription factors. However, the proximal promoter does not appear to play a role in mediating the thermal response of the COX4-1 gene in fish.",2016,219,19,3019-3027

However, can being too plastic actually be detrimental? Malagasy common tenrecs, Tenrec ecaudatus, have many plesiomorphic traits and may represent a basal placental mammal. We established a laboratory population of T. ecaudatus and found extreme plasticity in thermoregulation and metabolism, a novel hibernation form, variable annual timing, and remarkable growth and reproductive biology. For instance, tenrec body temperature (T-b) may approximate ambient temperature to as low as 12 degrees C even when tenrecs are fully active. Conversely, tenrecs can hibernate with Tb of 28 degrees C. During the active season, oxygen consumption may vary 25-fold with little or no change in T-b. During the austral winter, tenrecs are consistently torpid but the depth of torpor may vary. A righting assay revealed that T-b contributes to but does not dictate activity status. Homeostatic processes are not always linked, e.g. a hibernating tenrec experienced a similar to 34\% decrease in heart rate while maintaining constant body temperature and oxygen consumption rates. Tenrec growth rates vary but young may grow similar to 40-fold in the 5 weeks until weaning and may possess indeterminate growth as adults. Despite all of this profound plasticity, tenrecs are surprisingly intolerant of extremes in ambient temperature (<8 or >34 degrees C). We contend that while plasticity may confer numerous energetic advantages in consistently moderate environments, environmental extremes may have limited the success and distribution of plastic basal mammals.",2018,221,20,NA

(V)over dot(O2) of fasting snakes increased exponentially with temperature whereas (V)over dot(O2) of digesting snakes at high temperatures plateaued at a level 3- to 4-fold above fasting. The high and sustained aerobic metabolism over the entire temperature range was supported by pronounced tachycardia at all temperatures, and both fasting and digesting snakes maintained a normal acid-base balance without any indication of anaerobic metabolism. All snakes also maintained high arterial P-O2, even at temperatures close to the upper lethal temperature. Thus, there is no evidence of a reduced capacity for oxygen transport at high temperatures in either fasting or digesting snakes, suggesting that the upper thermal tolerance of this species is limited by other factors.",2014,217,22,3958-3961

In the original experiment, performed in winter, 4 degrees C-acclimated fish transferred to 12 degrees C reset intrinsic heart rate after just 1 h (from 56.8 +/- 1.2 to 50.8 +/- 1.5 beats min(-1)); 12 degrees C-acclimated fish transferred to 4 degrees C reset intrinsic heart rate after 8 h (from 33.4 +/- 0.7 to 37.7 +/- 1.2 beats min(-1)). However, in a replicate experiment, performed in the summer using a different brood year, intrinsic heart rate was not reset, even after 10 weeks at a new temperature. Using this serendipitous opportunity, we compared mRNA expression changes of a suite of proteins in sinoatrial node (SAN), atrial and ventricular tissues after both 1 h and longer than 3 weeks for both experimental acclimation groups to identify those changes only associated with pacemaker rate resetting. Of the changes in mRNA expression occurring after more than 3 weeks of warm acclimation and associated with pacemaker rate resetting, we observed downregulation of NKA alpha 1c in the atrium and ventricle, and upregulation of HCN1 in the ventricle. However, in the SAN there were no mRNA expression changes unique to the fish with pacemaker rate resetting after either 1 h or 3 weeks of warm acclimation. Thus, despite identifying changes in mRNA expression of contractile cardiac tissues, there was an absence of changes in mRNA expression directly involved with the initial, rapid pacemaker rate resetting with warm acclimation. Importantly, pacemaker rate resetting with thermal acclimation does not always occur in rainbow trout.",2020,223,12,NA

Resting heart rate was 39 beats min(-1) at 9 degrees C, and increased significantly when fish were acutely warmed to 16 degrees C (Q(10)=1.9), but then declined during acclimation (Q(10)=1.2 at day 39), mainly due to increased cholinergic inhibition while the intrinsic heart rate and adrenergic tone were little affected. Maximum heart rate also increased with warming, although a partial modest decrease occurred during the acclimation period. Consequently, heart rate scope exhibited a complex pattern with an initial increase with acute warming, followed by a steep decline and then a subsequent increase, which was primarily explained by cholinergic inhibition of resting heart rate.",2016,219,8,1106-1109

In the present study we assess how high temperature influences the host response to the pathogen by comparing transcriptomes (RNA sequencing) during the course of experimental infection at 21 degrees C (reference) and 29 degrees C. We show that high temperature induced host physiological processes that are unfavorable to the viral infection. Temperature influenced the expression of transcripts related to the immune process and increased the transcription of genes related to the apoptotic process, synaptic signaling and protein processes at 29 degrees C. Concomitantly, the expression of genes associated with catabolism, metabolite transport, macromolecule synthesis and cell growth remained low from the first stage of infection at 29 degrees C. Moreover, viral entry into the host might have been limited at 29 degrees C by changes in extracellular matrix composition and protein abundance.

We used five Drosophila species that vary in cold tolerance (chill coma temperature spanning similar to 11 degrees C) and repeatedly measured muscle V-m during a downward temperature ramp (20 to -3 degrees C). Cold-tolerant species were able to defend their V-m down to lower temperatures, which is not explained by species-specific differences in initial V-m at 20 degrees C, but by cold-tolerant drosophilids defending V-m across a broad range of temperatures. We found support for a previously suggested `critical threshold' of V-m, related to chill coma, in three of the five species. Interestingly, the cold-tolerant Drosophila species may enter coma as a result of processes unrelated to muscle depolarization as their V-m was not significantly depolarized at their chill coma temperatures.",2015,218,16,2492-2495
Oxygen and energy availability interact to determine flight performance in the Glanville fritillary butterfly,"Fountain, Toby and Melvin, Richard G. and Ikonen, Suvi and Ruokolainen, Annukka and Woestmann, Luisa and Hietakangas, Ville and Hanski, Ilkka",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.138180,"Flying insects have the highest known mass-specific demand for oxygen, which makes it likely that reduced availability of oxygen might limit sustained flight, either instead of or in addition to the limitation due to metabolite resources. The Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) occurs as a large metapopulation in which adult butterflies frequently disperse between small local populations. Here, we examine how the interaction between oxygen availability and fuel use affects flight performance in the Glanville fritillary. Individuals were flown under either normoxic (21 kPa O-2) or hypoxic (10 kPa O-2) conditions and their flight metabolism was measured. To determine resource use, levels of circulating glucose, trehalose and whole-body triglyceride were recorded after flight. Flight performance was significantly reduced in hypoxic conditions. When flown under normoxic conditions, we observed a positive correlation among individuals between post-flight circulating trehalose levels and flight metabolic rate, suggesting that low levels of circulating trehalose constrains flight metabolism. To test this hypothesis experimentally, we measured the flight metabolic rate of individuals injected with a trehalase inhibitor. In support of the hypothesis, experimental butterflies showed significantly reduced flight metabolic rate, but not resting metabolic rate, in comparison to control individuals. By contrast, under hypoxia there was no relationship between trehalose and flight metabolic rate. Additionally, in this case, flight metabolic rate was reduced in spite of circulating trehalose levels that were high enough to support high flight metabolic rate under normoxic conditions.

In hypoxia, neuronal ATP production is impaired, ATP-dependent ion pumping is reduced, transmembrane ion gradients are dysregulated, and intracellular Ca2+ concentration ({[}Ca2+](i)) increases enough to trigger excitotoxic cell death. Central neurons of the common goldfish (Carassius auratus) are hypoxia tolerant, but little is known about how goldfish retinas withstand hypoxia. To study the cellular mechanisms of hypoxia tolerance, we isolated retinal intemeurons (horizontal cells; HCs), and measured {[}Ca2+](i) with Fura-2. Goldfish HCs maintained {[}Ca2+](i) throughout 1 h of hypoxia, whereas {[}Ca2+](i) increased irreversibly in HCs of the hypoxia-sensitive rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) with just 20 min of hypoxia. Our results suggest mitochondria! ATP-dependent K+ channels (mK(ATP)) are necessary to stabilize {[}Ca2+](i) throughout hypoxia. In goldfish HCs, {[}Ca2+](i) increased when mK(ATP) channels were blocked with glibenclamide or 5-hydroxydecanoic acid, whereas the mK(ATP) channel agonist diazoxide prevented {[}Ca2+](i) from increasing in hypoxia in trout HCs. We found that hypoxia protects against increases in {[}Ca2+](i) in goldfish HCs via mK(ATP) channels. Glycolytic inhibition with 2-deoxyglucose increased {[}Ca2+](i), which was rescued by hypoxia in a mK(ATP) channel-dependent manner. We found no evidence of plasmalemmal KATP channels in patch-clamp experiments. Instead, we confirmed the involvement of K-ATP in mitochondria with TMRE imaging, as hypoxia rapidly (<5 min) depolarized mitochondria in a mK(ATP) channel-sensitive manner. We conclude that mK(ATP) channels initiate a neuroprotective pathway in goldfish HCs to maintain [}Ca2+](i) and avoid excitotoxicity in hypoxia.

Thermogenesis is supported by high rates of circulatory fatty acid and triglyceride delivery in highland deer mice,"Lyons, Sulayman A. and McClelland, Grant B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.244080,"Highland native deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) have greater rates of lipid oxidation during maximal cold challenge in hypoxia (hypoxic cold-induced <(V) over dot>(O2,max)) compared with their lowland conspecifics. Lipid oxidation is also increased in deer mice acclimated to simulated high altitude (cold hypoxia), regardless of altitude ancestry. The underlying lipid metabolic pathway traits responsible for sustaining maximal thermogenic demand in deer mice is currently unknown. The objective of this study was to characterize key steps in the lipid oxidation pathway in highland and lowland deer mice acclimated to control (23 degrees C, 21 kPa O-2) or cold hypoxic (5 degrees C, 12 kPa O-2) conditions. We hypothesized that capacities for lipid delivery and tissue uptake will be greater in highlanders and further increase with cold hypoxia acclimation. With the transition from rest to hypoxic cold-induced <(V) over dot>(O2,max), both highland and lowland deer mice showed increased plasma glycerol concentrations and fatty acid availability. Interestingly, acclimation to cold hypoxia led to increased plasma triglyceride concentrations at cold-induced <(V) over dot>(O2,max), but only in highlanders. Highlanders also had significantly greater delivery rates of circulatory free fatty acids and triglycerides due to higher plasma flow rates at cold-induced <(V) over dot>(O2,max). We found no population or acclimation differences in fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36) abundance in the gastrocnemius or brown adipose tissue, suggesting that fatty acid uptake across membranes is not limiting during thermogenesis.

Thus, organisms may have the capacity to alter mitochondria! processes through acclimation or adaptation to mitigate these effects. One possible mechanism is through the action of uncoupling proteins (UCPs), which can decrease the proton-motive force independent of the production of ATP. To test this hypothesis, we examined the mRNA expression patterns of UCP isoforms and characterized the effects of thermal acclimation and putative local thermal adaptation on mitochondria! capacity, proton leak and P/O ratios in two subspecies of Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus). Ucp1 was the dominant isoform in liver and was more highly expressed in northern killifish. We found that cold acclimation increased mitochondrial capacity (state Ill and maximum substrate oxidation capacity), state II membrane potential, proton leak and P/O ratios in northern, but not southern, killifish liver mitochondria. Palmitate induced mitochondrial uncoupling was detected in northern, but not southern, killifish liver mitochondria, consistent with the differences in Ucp mRNA expression between the subspecies. Taken together, our data suggest that mitochondrial function is more plastic in response to thermal acclimation in northern killifish than in southern killifish and that UCP1 may play a role in regulating the proton-motive force in northern, but not southern, killifish in response to thermal acclimation.

We hypothesized that embryonic 10\% O-2 preconditions cardiac function, decreasing the reduction in cardiac contractility associated with acute 5\% O-2 exposure in juvenile alligators. Our findings indicate that dobutamine injections caused a 90\% increase in systolic pressure in juveniles that were incubated in 21\% and 10\% O-2, with the 10\% O-2 group responding with a greater rate of ventricular relaxation and greater left ventricle output compared with the 21\% O-2 group. Further, our findings indicate that juvenile alligators that experienced embryonic hypoxia have a faster rate of ventricular relaxation, greater left ventricle stroke volume and greater cardiac power following beta-adrenergic stimulation, compared with juvenile alligators that did not experience embryonic hypoxia. When juveniles were exposed to 5\% O-2 for 20 min, normoxic-incubated juveniles had a 50\% decline in left ventricle maximal rate of pressure development and maximal pressure; however, these parameters were unaffected and decreased less in the hypoxic-incubated juveniles. These data indicate that embryonic hypoxia in crocodilians alters the cardiovascular phenotype, changing the juvenile response to acute hypoxia and beta-adrenergic stimulation.",2019,222,21,NA
Environmental temperature alters the digestive performance and gut microbiota of a terrestrial amphibian,"Fontaine, Samantha S. and Novarro, Alexander J. and Kohl, Kevin D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.187559,"Environmental temperature and gut microbial communities can both have profound impacts on the digestive performance of ectothemiic vertebrates. Additionally, the diversity, composition and function of gut microbial communities themselves are influenced by temperature. It is typically assumed that the temperature-dependent nature of ectotherm digestive performance is due to factors such as host physiological changes and adaptation to local climatic conditions. However, it is also possible that temperature-induced alterations to gut microbiota may influence the relationship between temperature and digestion. To explore the connections between these three factors, we compared digestive performance and gut microbial community diversity and composition in red-backed salamanders housed at three experimental temperatures: 10, 15 and 20 degrees C. We also investigated associations between specific bacterial taxa and temperature or salamander digestive performance. We found that salamander digestive performance was greatest at 15 degrees C, while gut microbial diversity was reduced at 20 degrees C. Further, gut microbial community composition differed among the three temperature treatments. The relative abundance of 25 bacterial genera was dependent on temperature, with high temperatures being associated with reductions in the relative abundance of disease-resistant bacteria and increases in pathogenic taxa. The relative abundance of four bacterial genera was correlated with salamander energy assimilation, two of which are known to digest chitin, a main component of the red-backed salamander diet. These findings suggest that gut microbiota may mediate the relationship between temperature and digestion in ectotherms. We discuss how global climate change may impact ectotherms by altering host-microbe interactions.",2018,221,20,NA
Disproportionate role of nuclear-encoded proteins in organismal and mitochondrial thermal performance in a copepod,"Kayhani, Kamron and Barreto, Felipe S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.246085,"Determining the mechanisms by which organisms evolve thermal tolerance is crucial to predicting how populations may respond to changes in local temperature regimes. Although evidence of relationships between mitochondrial background and thermal adaptation have been found, the presence of both nuclear-encoded and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded proteins warrants experiments aimed at parsing out the relative role of each genome in thermal adaptation. We investigated the relative role of mtDNAencoded products in thermal tolerance between two divergent populations of Tignopus californicus using first-generation (F1) hybrids that vary in maternally inherited mtDNA but are heterozygous for population-specific alleles across nuclear loci. We tested two measures of thermal tolerance, (1) survivorship to acute thermal stress and (2) thermal stability of mitochondrial performance in Complex I-fueled ATP synthesis, both across a range of increasing temperatures. We found that the southern population (San Diego, CA, USA) outperformed the northern population (Strawberry Hill, OR, USA) in survivorship, and that both reciprocal F-1 hybrid crosses had intermediate survival. Mitochondria from the San Diego population displayed greater stability in ATP synthesis with increasing temperatures compared with those from Strawberry Hill. Interestingly, hybrids from both cross directions had synthesis profiles that were very similar to that of Strawberry Hill. Taken together, these results suggest that the relative role of the mtDNA in these phenotypes is negligible compared with that of elements encoded by nuclear DNA in this system.",2023,226,23,NA
Effect of temperature and food restriction on immune function in striped hamsters (<i>Cricetulus barabensis</i>),"Xu, De-Li and Hu, Xiao-Kai and Tian, Yu-Fen",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.153601,"Small mammals in temperate areas face seasonal fluctuations of temperature and food availability, both of which may influence their immune responses, which are critical to survival. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that low temperature and food restriction suppress immune function in striped hamsters (Cricetulus barabensis). Thirty-seven adult male hamsters were randomly assigned to warm (23 +/- 1 degrees C) and cold (5 +/- 1 degrees C) treatment groups, which were further divided into fed and food-restricted groups. Body mass was not affected by cold stress, food restriction or the interaction cold stressxfood restriction. Cold stress decreased total body fat mass, haematological parameters including white blood cells, lymphocytes and neutrophilic granulocytes, and immunoglobin (Ig) M titres 5 days after injecting keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH). However, cold temperature increased bacterial killing capacity, indicative of innate immunity, and did not affect the mass of the thymus and spleen, intermediate granulocytes, the phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) response and the levels of blood glucose and serum leptin. Corticosterone concentration was affected significantly by the interaction cold stressxfood restriction but not by cold stress or food restriction alone. Food restriction reduced thymus mass, but other immunological parameters including body fat mass, spleen mass, haematological parameters. innate immunity, PHA response, the titres of IgM and IgG, and the levels of blood glucose and serum leptin were all not affected by food restriction or the interaction cold stressxfood restriction. Innate immunity was positively correlated with leptin levels, whereas no significant correlations were observed in the levels of blood glucose, serum leptin, corticosterone and all the detected immune parameters. Our results show that cold stress suppressed humoral immunity but enhanced innate immunity and did not affect cellular immunity in striped hamsters. Most immunological indices were not influenced by food restriction. Blood glucose, leptin and corticosterone could not explain the changes of innate, cellular and humoral immunity upon cold stress or food restriction in striped hamsters.",2017,220,12,2187-2195
Cold acclimation increases cardiac myofilament function and ventricular pressure generation in trout,"Klaiman, Jordan M. and Pyle, W. Glen and Gillis, Todd E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.109041,"Reducing temperature below the optimum of most vertebrate hearts impairs contractility and reduces organ function. However, a number of fish species, including the rainbow trout, can seasonally acclimate to low temperature. Such ability requires modification of physiological systems to compensate for the thermodynamic effects of temperature on biological processes. The current study tested the hypothesis that rainbow trout compensate for the direct effect of cold temperature by increasing cardiac contractility during cold acclimation. We examined cardiac contractility, following thermal acclimation (4, 11 and 17 degrees C), by measuring the Ca2+ sensitivity of force generation by chemically skinned cardiac trabeculae as well as ventricular pressure generation using a modified Langendorff preparation. We demonstrate, for the first time, that the Ca2+ sensitivity of force generation was significantly higher in cardiac trabeculae from 4 degrees C-acclimated trout compared with those acclimated to 11 or 17 degrees C, and that this functional change occurred in parallel with a decrease in the level of cardiac troponin T phosphorylation. In addition, we show that the magnitude and rate of ventricular pressure generation was greater in hearts from trout acclimated to 4 degrees C compared with those from animals acclimated to 11 or 17 degrees C. Taken together, these results suggest that enhanced myofilament function, caused by modification of existing contractile proteins, is at least partially responsible for the observed increase in pressure generation after acclimation to 4 degrees C. In addition, by examining the phenotypic plasticity of a comparative model we have identified a strategy, used in vivo, by which the force-generating capacity of cardiac muscle can be increased.",2014,217,23,4132-4140
Hypoxia acclimation alters reactive oxygen species homeostasis and oxidative status in estuarine killifish (<i>Fundulus heteroclitus</i>),"Borowiec, Brittney G. and Scott, Graham R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.222877,"Hypoxia is common in aquatic environments, and exposure to hypoxia followed by re-oxygenation is often believed to induce oxidative stress. However, there have been relatively few studies of reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis and oxidative status in fish that experience natural hypoxia-re-oxygenation cycles. We examined how exposure to acute hypoxia (2 kPa O-2) and subsequent re-oxygenation (to 20 kPa O-2) affects redox status, oxidative damage and anti-oxidant defenses in estuarine killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus), and whether these effects were ameliorated or potentiated by prolonged (28 days) acclimation to either constant hypoxia or intermittent cycles of nocturnal hypoxia (12 h:12 h normoxia:hypoxia). Acute hypoxia and re-oxygenation led to some modest and transient changes in redox status, increases in oxidized glutathione, depletion of scavenging capacity and oxidative damage to lipids in skeletal muscle. The liver had greater scavenging capacity, total glutathione concentrations and activities of anti-oxidant enzymes (catalase, glutathione peroxidase) than muscle, and generally experienced less variation in glutathiones and lipid peroxidation. Unexpectedly, acclimation to constant hypoxia or intermittent hypoxia led to a more oxidizing redox status (muscle and liver) and it increased oxidized glutathione (muscle). However, hypoxia-acclimated fish exhibited little to no oxidative damage (as reflected by lipid peroxidation and aconitase activity), in association with improvements in scavenging capacity and catalase activity in muscle. We conclude that hypoxia acclimation leads to adjustments in ROS homeostasis and oxidative status that do not reflect oxidative stress, but may instead be part of the suite of responses that killifish use to cope with chronic hypoxia.",2020,223,13,NA
HIF1α and physiological responses to hypoxia are correlated in mice but not in rats,"Jochmans-Lemoine, Alexandra and Shahare, Manju and Soliz, Jorge and Joseph, Vincent",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.142869,"We previously reported that rats and mice that have been raised for more than 30 generations in La Paz, Bolivia (3600 m), display divergent physiological responses to high altitude, including improved respiratory and metabolic control in mice. In the present study, we asked whether these traits would also be present in response to hypoxia at sea level. To answer this question, we exposed rats (Sprague Dawley) and mice (FVB) to normoxia (21\% O-2) or hypoxia (15 and 12\% O-2) for 6 h and measured ventilation and metabolic rate (whole-body plethysmography), and expression of the transcription factor HIF-1 alpha (ELISA and mass spectrometry) and other proteins whose expression are regulated by hypoxia (glucose transporter 1, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 and angiopoietin 2; mass spectrometry) in the brainstem. In response to hypoxia, compared with rats, mice had higher minute ventilation, lower metabolic rate and higher expression of HIF-1 alpha in the brainstem. In mice, the expression level of HIF-1 alpha was positively correlated with ventilation and negatively correlated with metabolic rate. In rats, the concentration of brainstem cytosolic protein decreased by 38\% at 12\% O-2, while expression of the glucose transporter 1 increased. We conclude that mice and rats raised at sea level have divergent physiological and molecular responses to hypoxia, supporting the hypothesis that mice have innate traits that favor adaptation to altitude.",2016,219,24,3952-3961
Cold acclimation alters the connective tissue content of the zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) heart,"Johnson, Amy C. and Turko, Andy J. and Klaiman, Jordan M. and Johnston, Elizabeth F. and Gillis, Todd E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.101196,"Thermal acclimation can alter cardiac function and morphology in a number of fish species, but little is known about the regulation of these changes. The purpose of the present study was to determine how cold acclimation affects zebrafish (Danio rerio) cardiac morphology, collagen composition and connective tissue regulation. Heart volume, the thickness of the compact myocardium, collagen content and collagen fiber composition were compared between control (27 degrees C) and cold-acclimated (20 degrees C) zebrafish using serially sectioned hearts stained with Picrosirius Red. Collagen content and fiber composition of the pericardial membrane were also examined. Cold acclimation did not affect the volume of the contracted heart; however, there was a significant decrease in the thickness of the compact myocardium. There was also a decrease in the collagen content of the compact myocardium and in the amount of thick collagen fibers throughout the heart. Cold-acclimated zebrafish also increased expression of the gene transcript for matrix metalloproteinase 2, matrix metalloproteinase 9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 and collagen Type I alpha 1. We propose that the reduction in the thickness of the compact myocardium as well as the change in collagen content may help to maintain the compliance of the ventricle as temperatures decrease. Together, these results clearly demonstrate that the zebrafish heart undergoes significant remodeling in response to cold acclimation.",2014,217,11,1868-1875
The glutamatergic drive to breathe is reduced in severe but not moderate hypoxia in Damaraland mole-rats,"Devereaux, Maiah E. M. and Chiasson, Sarah and Brennan, Kate F. and Pamenter, Matthew E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.246185,"Damaraland mole-rats (Fukomys damarensis) are a hypoxia-tolerant fossorial species that exhibit a robust hypoxic metabolic response HVR of most adult mammals is mediated by increased excitatory glutamatergic signalling, naked mole-rats, which are closely related to Damaraland mole-rats, do not utilize this pathway. Given their phylogenetic relationship and similar lifestyles, we hypothesized that the signalling mechanisms underlying physiological responses to acute hypoxia in Damaraland mole-rats are like those of naked mole-rats. To test this, we used pharmacological antagonists of glutamatergic alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), combined with plethysmography, respirometry and thermal RFID chips, to non-invasively evaluate the role of excitatory AMPAR and NMDAR signalling in mediating ventilatory, metabolic and thermoregulatory responses, respectively, to 1 h of 5 or 7\% O2. We found that AMPAR or NMDAR antagonism have minimal impacts on the HMR or hypoxia-mediated changes in thermoregulation. Conversely, the `blunted' HVR of Damaraland mole-rats is reduced by either AMPAR or NMDAR antagonism such that the onset of the HVR occurs in less severe hypoxia. In more severe hypoxia, antagonists have no impact, suggesting that these receptors are already inhibited. Together, these findings indicate that the glutamatergic drive to breathe decreases in Damaraland mole-rats exposed to severe hypoxia. These findings differ from other adult mammals, in which the glutamatergic drive to breathe increases with hypoxia.",2023,226,19,NA
Morph- and sex-specific effects of challenging conditions on maintenance parameters in the Gouldian finch,"Fragueira, Rita and Verhulst, Simon and Beaulieu, Michaeel",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.196030,"Intraspecific discrete polymorphism is associated with the use of alternative life-history strategies, reflected by distinct reproductive or copying strategies in individuals of differentmorphs. Yet, morph-specific costs and benefits related to different life-history strategies remain unclear. Here, we examined in the polymorphic Gouldian finch (Erythrura gouldiae) whether markers of somatic maintenance (body mass, oxidative status and telomere length) differed between red- and black-headed birds under energetically demanding conditions (during heatwaves of different intensity, and during moult or breeding following heatwaves). During heatwaves, red-headed birds showed a homogeneous response, as males and females initially tended to gain mass and had reduced plasma hydroperoxide levels (a marker of oxidative damage) irrespective of heatwave intensity. In contrast, black-headed birds showed a stronger andmore heterogeneous response, as black-headed males gained mass at the beginning of the thermoneutral heatwave and showed stable oxidative status, whereas black-headed females lost mass and tended to show higher hydroperoxide levels at the end of the thermocritical heatwave. Following heatwaves, we found morph-specific oxidative costs owing to moult or reproduction, with oxidative markers varying only in black-headed birds. Again, oxidative markers varied differently in black-headed males and females, as plasma antioxidant capacity decreased inmoulting or breeding females, whereasmales showed higher hydroperoxide levels with larger broods. For the first time, our study highlights that within polymorphic species, some individuals appearmore vulnerable than others when coping with energetically demanding conditions. In the context of climate change, such differential effects may ultimately alter the currently observed balance between morphs and sexes within natural populations.",2019,222,7,NA
Thermal acclimation and subspecies-specific effects on heart and brain mitochondrial performance in a eurythermal teleost (<i>Fundulus heteroclitus</i>),"Chung, Dillon James and Bryant, Heather J. and Schulte, Patricia M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.151217,"Mitochondrial performance may play a role in setting whole-animal thermal tolerance limits and their plasticity, but the relative roles of adjustments in mitochondrial performance across different highly aerobic tissues remain poorly understood. We compared heart and brain mitochondrial responses to acute thermal challenges and to thermal acclimation using high-resolution respirometry in two locally adapted subspecies of Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus). We predicted that 5 degrees C acclimation would result in compensatory increases in mitochondrial performance, while 33 degrees C acclimation would cause suppression of mitochondrial function to minimize the effects of high temperature on mitochondrial metabolism. In contrast, acclimation to both 33 and 5 degrees C decreased mitochondrial performance compared with fish acclimated to 15 degrees C. These adjustments could represent an energetic cost-saving mechanism at temperature extremes. Acclimation responses were similar in both heart and brain; however, this effect was smaller in the heart, which might indicate its importance in maintaining whole-animal thermal performance. Alternatively, larger acclimation effects in the brain might indicate greater thermal sensitivity compared with the heart. We detected only modest differences between subspecies that were dependent on the tissue assayed. These data demonstrate extensive plasticity in mitochondrial performance following thermal acclimation in killifish, and indicate that the extent of these responses differs between tissues, highlighting the importance and complexity of mitochondrial regulation in thermal acclimation in eurytherms.",2017,220,8,1459-1471
Mitochondrial metabolism and oxidative stress in the tropical cockroach under fluctuating thermal regimes,"Lubawy, Jan and Chowanski, Szymon P. and Colinet, Herve and Slocinska, Malgorzata",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.246287,"The cockroach Gromphadorhina coquereliana can survive at low temperatures under extensive periods of cold stress. To assess energy management and insect adaptation in response to cold, we measured mitochondrial activity and oxidative stress in muscle and fat body tissues from G. coquereliana under a fluctuating thermal regime (FTR; stressed at 4 degrees C for 3 h on 3 consecutive days, with or without 24 h recovery). Compared with our earlier work showing that a single exposure to cold significantly affects mitochondrial parameters, here, repeated exposure to cold triggered an acclimatory response, resulting in unchanged mitochondrial bioenergetics. Immediately after cold exposure, we observed an increase in the overall pool of ATP and a decrease in typical antioxidant enzyme activity. We also observed decreased activity of uncoupling protein 4 in muscle mitochondria. After 24 h of recovery, we observed an increase in expression of antioxidant enzymes in muscles and the fat body and a significant increase in the expression of UCP4 and HSP70 in the latter. This indicates that processes related to energy conversion and disturbance under cold stress may trigger different protective mechanisms in these tissues, and that these mechanisms must be activated to restore insect homeostasis. The mitochondrial parameters and enzymatic assays suggest that mitochondria are not affected during FTR but oxidative stress markers are decreased, and a 24 h recovery period allows for the restoration of redox and energy homeostasis, especially in the fat body. This confirms the crucial role of the fat body in intermediary metabolism and energy management in insects and in the response to repeated thermal stress.",2023,226,17,NA
Effect of ambient temperature on sleep breathing phenotype in mice: the role of orexins,"Berteotti, Chiara and Lo Martire, Viviana and Alvente, Sara and Bastianini, Stefano and Matteoli, Gabriele and Silvani, Alessandro and Zoccoli, Giovanna",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.219485,"The loss of orexinergic neurons, which release orexins, results in narcolepsy. Orexins participate in the regulation of many physiological functions, and their role as wake-promoting molecules has been widely described. Less is known about the involvement of orexins in body temperature and respiratory regulation. The aim of this study was to investigate if orexin peptides modulate respiratory regulation as a function of ambient temperature (T-a) during different sleep stages. Respiratory phenotype of male orexin knockout (KO-ORX, N=9) and wild-type (WT, N=8) mice was studied at thermoneutrality (T-a=30 degrees C) or during mild cold exposure (T-a=20 degrees C) inside a whole-body plethysmography chamber. The states of wakefulness (W), non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) and rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) were scored non-invasively, using a previously validated technique. In both WT and KO-ORX mice, T-a strongly and significantly affected ventilatory period and minute ventilation values during NREMS and REMS; moreover, the occurrence rate of sleep apneas in NREMS was significantly reduced at T-a=20 degrees C compared with T-a=30 degrees C. Overall, there were no differences in respiratory regulation during sleep between WT and KO-ORX mice, except for sigh occurrence rate, which was significantly increased at T-a=20 degrees C compared with T-a=30 degrees C in WT mice, but not in KO-ORX mice. These results do not support a main role for orexin peptides in the temperature-dependent modulation of respiratory regulation during sleep. However, we showed that the occurrence rate of sleep apneas critically depends on T-a, without any significant effect of orexin peptides.",2020,223,13,NA
Parental thermal environment alters offspring sex ratio and fitness in an oviparous lizard,"Schwanz, Lisa E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.139972,"The environment experienced by parents can impact the phenotype of their offspring (parental effects), a critical component of organismal ecology and evolution in variable or changing environments. Although temperature is acentral feature of the environment forectotherms, its role in parental effects has been little explored until recently. Here, parental basking opportunity was manipulated in an oviparous lizard with temperature-dependent sex determination, the jacky dragon (Amphibolurus muricatus). Eggs were incubated at a temperature that typically produces a 50: 50 sex ratio, and hatchlings were reared in a standard thermal environment. Offspring of parents in short bask conditions appeared to have better fitness outcomes in captive conditions than those of parents in long bask conditions -they had greater growth and survival as a function of their mass. In addition, the sex of offspring (male or female) depended on the interaction between parental treatment and egg mass, and treatment impacted whether sons or daughters grew larger in their first season. The interactive effects of treatment on offspring sex and growth are consistent with adaptive explanations for the existence of temperature-dependent sex determination in this species. Moreover, the greater performance recorded in short bask offspring may represent an anticipatory parental effect to aid offspring in predicted conditions of restricted thermal opportunity. Together, these responses constitute a crucial component of the population response to spatial or temporal variation in temperature.",2016,219,15,2349-2357
GABA metabolism is crucial for long-term survival of anoxia in annual killifish embryos,"Zajic, Daniel E. and Podrabsky, Jason E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.229715,"In most vertebrates, a lack of oxygen quickly leads to irreparable damages to vital organs, such as the brain and heart. However, there are some vertebrates that have evolved mechanisms to survive periods of no oxygen (anoxia). The annual killifish (Austrofundulus limnaeus) survives in ephemeral ponds in the coastal deserts of Venezuela and their embryos have the remarkable ability to tolerate anoxia for months. When exposed to anoxia, embryos of A. limnaeus respond by producing significant amounts of y-aminobutyric acid (GABA). This study aims to understand the role of GABA in supporting the metabolic response to anoxia. To explore this, we investigated four developmentally distinct stages of A. limnaeus embryos that vary in their anoxia tolerance. We measured GABA and lactate concentrations across development in response to anoxia and aerobic recovery. We then inhibited enzymes responsible for the production and degradation of GABA and observed GABA and lactate concentrations, as well as embryo mortality. Here, we show for the first time that GABA metabolism affects anoxia tolerance in A. limnaeus embryos. Inhibition of enzymes responsible for GABA production (glutamate decarboxylase) and degradation (GABA-transaminase and succinic acid semialdehyde dehydrogenase) led to increased mortality, supporting a role for GABA as an intermediate product and not a metabolic end-product. We propose multiple roles for GABA during anoxia and aerobic recovery in A. limnaeus embryos, serving as a neurotransmitter, an energy source, and an anti-oxidant.",2020,223,20,NA
Development of endothermy and concomitant increases in cardiac and skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration in the precocial Pekin duck (<i>Anas platyrhynchos domestica</i>),"Sirsat, Sarah K.

Simultaneous measurements at the organism, organ and cellular levels during the transition to endothermy reveal means by which this change in phenotype occurs. We examined development of endothermy in precocial Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domestica) by measuring whole-animal O-2 consumption ((V) over dot)O-2) as animals cooled from 35 to 15 degrees C. We measured heart ventricle mass, an indicator of O-2 delivery capacity, and mitochondrial respiration in permeabilized skeletal and cardiac muscle to elucidate associated changes in mitochondrial capacities at the cellular level. We examined animals on day 24 of incubation through 7 days post-hatching. (V) over dot O-2 of embryos decreased when cooling from 35 to 15 degrees C; (V) over dot O-2 of hatchlings, beginning on day 0 post-hatching, increased during cooling with a lower critical temperature of 32 degrees C. Yolk-free body mass did not change between internal pipping and hatching, but the heart and thigh skeletal muscle grew at faster rates than the rest of the body as the animals transitioned from an externally pipped paranate to a hatchling. Large changes in oxidative phosphorylation capacity occurred during ontogeny in both thigh muscles, the primary site of shivering, and cardiac ventricles. Thus, increased metabolic capacity necessary to attain endothermy was associated with augmented metabolic capacity of the tissue and augmented increasing O-2 delivery capacity, both of which were attained rapidly at hatching.",2016,219,8,1214-1223
Antioxidant response to acute cold exposure and during recovery in juvenile Chinese soft-shelled turtles (<i>Pelodiscus sinensis</i>),"Chen, Bo-Jian and Zhang, Wen-Yi and Niu, Cui-Juan and Li, Wen-Jie and Jia, Hui and Storey, Kenneth B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.197863,"The antioxidant defense protects turtles from oxidative stress caused by adverse environment conditions, such as acute thermal fluctuations. However, it remains unclear how these defenses work. The present study examined changes in key enzymes of the enzymatic antioxidant system and the glutathione (GSH) system at both the mRNA and enzyme activity levels during acute cold exposure and recovery in juvenile Chinese soft shelled turtles, Pelodiscus sinensis. Transcript levels of the upstream regulator NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) were also measured. Turtles were acdimated at 28 degrees C (3 weeks), then given acute cold exposure (8 degrees C, 12 h) and finally placed in recovery (28 degrees C, 24 h). The mRNA levels of cerebral and hepatic Nrf2 and of genes encoding downstream antioxidant enzymes did not change, whereas levels of nephric Nrf2, manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) mRNA decreased upon cold exposure. During recovery, Nrf2 mRNA remained stable in all three tissues, hepatic Cu/ZnSOD, MnSOD and catalase (CAT) mRNA levels increased, and nephric MnSOD and GPx4 mRNAs did not change from the values during cold exposure. In the GSH system, mRNA levels of most enzymes remained constant during cold exposure and recovery. Unmatched with changes in mRNA level, high and stable constitutive antioxidant enzyme activities were maintained throughout, whereas GPx activity significantly reduced in the kidney during cold exposure, and in liver and kidney during recovery. Our results suggest that the antioxidant defense regulation in response to acute cold exposure in P. sinensis may not be achieved at the transcriptional level, but may rely mainly on high constitutive antioxidant enzyme activities.",2019,222,4,NA
Energy and lipid metabolism during direct and diapause development in a pierid butterfly,"Lehmann, Philipp and Pruisscher, Peter and Posledovich, Diana and Carlsson, Mikael and Kakela, Reijo and Tang, Patrik and Nylin, Soren and Wheat, Christopher W. and Wiklund, Christer and Gotthard, Karl",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.142687,"Diapause is a fundamental component of the life cycle in the majority of insects living in environments characterized by strong seasonality. The present study addresses poorly understood associations and trade-offs between endogenous diapause duration, thermal sensitivity of development, energetic cost of development and cold tolerance. Diapause intensity, metabolic rate trajectories and lipid profiles of directly developing and diapausing animals were studied using pupae and adults of Pieris napi butterflies from a population in which endogenous diapause has been well studied. Endogenous diapause was terminated after 3 months and termination required chilling. Metabolic and post-diapause development rates increased with diapause duration, while the metabolic cost of post-diapause development decreased, indicating that once diapause is terminated, development proceeds at a low rate even at low temperature. Diapausing pupae had larger lipid stores than the directly developing pupae, and lipids constituted the primary energy source during diapause. However, during diapause, lipid stores did not decrease. Thus, despite lipid catabolism meeting the low energy costs of the diapausing pupae, primary lipid store utilization did not occur until the onset of growth and metamorphosis in spring. In line with this finding, diapausing pupae contained low amounts of mitochondria-derived cardiolipins, which suggests a low capacity for fatty acid beta-oxidation. While ontogenic development had a large effect on lipid and fatty acid profiles, only small changes in these were seen during diapause. The data therefore indicate that the diapause lipidomic phenotype is developed early, when pupae are still at high temperature, and retained until post-diapause development.",2016,219,19,3049-3060
Mortality caused by extracellular freezing is associated with fragmentation of nuclear DNA in Iarval haemocytes of two drosophilid flies,"Stetina, Tomas and Kostal, Vladimir",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.246456,"The great complexity of extracellular freezing stress, involving mechanical, osmotic, dehydration and chemical perturbations of the cellular milieu, hampers progress in understanding the nature of freezing injury and the mechanisms to cope with it in naturally freeze-tolerant insects. Here, we show that nuclear DNA fragmentation begins to occur in larval haemocytes of two fly species, Chymomyza costata and Drosophila melanogaster, before or at the same time as the sub-zero temperature is reached that causes irreparable freezing injury and mortality in freeze-sensitive larval phenotypes. However, when larvae of the freeze-tolerant phenotype (diapausing-cold acclimated-hyperprolinemic) of C. costata were subjected to severe freezing stress in liquid nitrogen, no DNA damage was observed. Artificially increasing the proline concentration in freeze-sensitive larvae of both species by feeding them a proline-enriched diet resulted in a decrease in the proportion of nuclei with fragmented DNA during freezing stress. Our results suggest that proline accumulated in diapausing C. costata larvae during cold acclimation may contribute to the protection of nuclear DNA against fragmentation associated with freezing stress.",2023,226,21,NA
Fluctuating temperatures and ectotherm growth: distinguishing non-linear and time-dependent effects,"Kingsolver, Joel G. and Higgins, Jessica K. and Augustine, Kate E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.120733,"Most terrestrial ectotherms experience diurnal and seasonal variation in temperature. Because thermal performance curves are non-linear, mean performance can differ in fluctuating and constant thermal environments. However, time-dependent effects - effects of the order and duration of exposure to temperature - can also influence mean performance. We quantified the non-linear and time-dependent effects of diurnally fluctuating temperatures for larval growth rates in the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta L., with four main results. First, the shape of the thermal performance curve for growth rate depended on the duration of exposure: for example, optimal temperature and thermal breadth were greater for growth rates measured over short (24 h during the last instar) compared with long (the entire period of larval growth) time periods. Second, larvae reared in diurnally fluctuating temperatures had significantly higher optimal temperatures and maximal growth rates than larvae reared in constant temperatures. Third, for larvae maintained at three mean temperatures (20, 25 and 30 degrees C) and three diurnal temperature ranges (+/- 0, +/- 5 and +/- 10 degrees C), diurnal fluctuations had opposite effects on mean growth rates at low versus high mean temperature.

Thermal history of alfalfa leafcutting bees affects nesting and diapause incidence,"Earls, Kayla N. and Porter, Monique S. and Rinehart, Joseph P. and Greenlee, Kendra J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.243242,"Variable spring temperatures may expose developing insects to sublethal conditions, resulting in long-term consequences. The alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata, overwinters as a prepupa inside a brood cell, resuming development in spring. During these immobile stages of development, bees must tolerate unfavorable temperatures. In this study, we tested howexposure to low temperature stress during development affects subsequent reproduction and characteristics of the F1 generation. Developing male and female M. rotundata were exposed to either constant (6 degrees C) or fluctuating (1 h day(-1) at 20 degrees C) low temperature stress for 1 week, during the pupal stage, to mimic a spring cold snap. Treated adults were marked and released into field cages, and reproductive output was compared with that of untreated control bees. Exposure to low temperatures during the pupal stage had mixed effects on reproduction and offspring characteristics. Females treated with fluctuating low temperatures were more likely to nest compared with control bees or those exposed to constant low temperature stress. Sublethal effects may have contributed to low nesting rates of bees exposed to constant low temperatures. Females from that group that were able to nest had fewer, larger offspring with high viability, suggesting a trade-off. Interestingly, offspring of bees exposed to fluctuating low temperatures were more likely to enter diapause, indicating that thermal history of parents, even during development, is an important factor in diapause determination.",2021,224,22,NA
Cold adaptation overrides developmental regulation of sarcolipin expression in mice skeletal muscle: SOS for muscle-based thermogenesis?,"Pant, Meghna and Bal, Naresh C. and Periasamy, Muthu",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.119164,"Neonatal mice have a greater thermogenic need than adult mice and may require additional means of heat production, other than the established mechanism of brown adipose tissue (BAT). We and others recently discovered a novel mediator of skeletal muscle-based thermogenesis called sarcolipin (SLN) that acts by uncoupling sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA). In addition, we have shown that SLN expression is downregulated during neonatal development in rats. In this study we probed two questions: (1) is SLN expression developmentally regulated in neonatal mice?; and (2) if so, will cold adaptation override this? Our data show that SLN expression is higher during early neonatal stages and is gradually downregulated in fast twitch skeletal muscles. Interestingly, we demonstrate that cold acclimation of neonatal mice can prevent downregulation of SLN expression. This observation suggests that SLN-mediated thermogenesis can be recruited to a greater extent during extreme physiological need, in addition to BAT.",2015,218,15,2321-2325
Complementary roles of photoperiod and temperature in environmental sex determination in <i>Daphnia</i> spp.,"Camp, Allison A. and Haeba, Maher H. and LeBlanc, Gerald A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.195289,"Daphnia spp., a keystone genus in freshwater lentic habitats, are subject to environmental sex determination wherein environmental conditions dictate offspring sex and whether they reproduce asexually or sexually. The introduction of males into a population denotes the first step in the switch from asexual parthenogenetic reproduction to sexual reproduction. We tested the hypothesis that photoperiod and temperature co-regulate male sex determination and that these environmental stimuli would activate elements of the male sex determination signaling cascade. The results revealed that photoperiod was a critical cue in creating permissive conditions for male production. Further, under photoperiod-induced permissive conditions, male sex determination was temperature dependent. The two daphnid species evaluated, Daphnia pulex and Daphnia magna, exhibited different temperature dependencies. Daphnia pulex produced fewer males with increasing temperatures between 16 and 22 degrees C, and D. magna exhibited the opposite trend. We found consistent expression patterns of key genes along the male sex-determining signaling pathway in D. pulex independent of environmental stimuli. mRNA levels for the enzyme responsible for synthesis of the male sex-determining hormone, methyl famesoate, were elevated early in the reproductive cycle, followed by increased mRNA levels of the methyl farnesoate receptor subunits Met and SRC. Environmental conditions that stimulated male offspring production significantly increased Met mRNA levels. The results indicate that male sex determination in daphnids is under the permissive control of photoperiod and the regulatory control of temperature. Further, these environmental cues may stimulate male sex determination by increasing levels of the Met subunit of the methyl famesoate receptor.",2019,222,4,NA
Thermoregulatory strategy may shape immune investment in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>,"Kutch, Ian C. and Sevgili, Hasan and Wittman, Tyler and Fedorka, Kenneth M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.106294,"As temperatures change, insects alter the amount of melanin in their cuticle to improve thermoregulation. However, melanin is also central to insect immunity, suggesting that thermoregulatory strategy may indirectly impact immune defense by altering the abundance of melanin pathway components (a hypothesis we refer to as thermoregulatory-dependent immune investment). This may be the case in the cricket Allonemobius socius, where warm environments (both seasonal and geographical) produced crickets with lighter cuticles and increased pathogen susceptibility. Unfortunately, the potential for thermoregulatory strategy to influence insect immunity has not been widely explored. Here we address the relationships between temperature, thermoregulatory strategy and immunity in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. To this end, flies from two separate Canadian populations were reared in either a summer-or autumn-like environment. Shortly after adult eclosion, flies were moved to a common environment where their cuticle color and susceptibility to a bacterial pathogen (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were measured. As with A. socius, individuals from summer-like environments exhibited lighter cuticles and increased pathogen susceptibility, suggesting that the thermoregulatory-immunity relationship is evolutionarily conserved across the hemimetabolous and holometabolous clades. If global temperatures continue to rise as expected, then thermoregulation might play an important role in host infection and mortality rates in systems that provide critical ecosystem services (e.g. pollination), or influence the prevalence of insect-vectored disease (e.g. malaria).",2014,217,20,3664-3669
"Thermal performance curves reveal shifts in optima, limits and breadth in early life","Rebolledo, Adriana P. and Sgro, Carla M. and Monro, Keyne",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.233254,"Understanding thermal performance at life stages that limit persistence is necessary to predict responses to climate change, especially for ectotherms whose fitness (survival and reproduction) depends on environmental temperature. Ectotherms often undergo stage-specific changes in size, complexity and duration that are predicted to modify thermal performance. Yet performance is mostly explored for adults, while performance at earlier stages that typically limit persistence remains poorly understood. Here, we experimentally isolate thermal performance curves at fertilization, embryo development and larval development stages in an aquatic ectotherm whose early planktonic stages (gametes, embryos and larvae) govern adult abundances and dynamics. Unlike previous studies based on short-term exposures. responses with unclear links to fitness or proxies in lieu of explicit curve descriptors (thermal optima, limits and breadth), we measured performance as successful completion of each stage after exposure throughout, and at temperatures that explicitly capture curve descriptors at all stages. Formal comparisons of descriptors using a combination of generalized linear mixed modelling and parametric bootstrapping reveal important differences among life stages. Thermal performance differs significantly from fertilization to embryo development (with thermal optimum declining by similar to 2 degrees C, thermal limits shifting inwards by similar to 8-10 degrees C and thermal breadth narrowing by similar to 10 degrees C), while performance declines independently of temperature thereafter. Our comparisons show that thermal performance at one life stage can misrepresent performance at others, and point to gains in complexity during embryogenesis, rather than subsequent gains in size or duration of exposure, as a key driver of thermal sensitivity in early life.",2020,223,22,NA
Comparing thermal performance curves across traits: how consistent are they?,"Kellermann, Vanessa and Chown, Steven L. and Schou, Mads Fristrup and Aitkenhead, Ian and Janion-Scheepers, Charlene and Clemson, Allannah and Scott, Marina Telonis and Sgro, Carla M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.193433,"Thermal performance curves (TPCs) are intended to approximate the relationship between temperature and fitness, and are commonly integrated into species distributional models for understanding climate change responses. However, TPCs may vary across traits because selection and environmental sensitivity (plasticity) differ across traits or because the timing and duration of the temperature exposure, here termed time scale, may alter trait variation. Yet, the extent to which TPCs vary temporally and across traits is rarely considered in assessments of climate change responses. Using a common garden approach, we estimated TPCs for standard metabolic rate (SMR), and activity in Drosophila melanogaster at three test temperatures (16.25 and 30 degrees C), using flies from each of six developmental temperatures (16, 18, 20, 25, 28 and 30 degrees C). We examined the effects of time scale of temperature exposure (minutes/ hours versus days/weeks) in altering TPC shape and position, and commonly used descriptors of the TPC: thermal optimum (T-opt), thermal limits (T-min and T-max) and thermal breadth (T-br). In addition, we collated previously published estimates of TPCs for fecundity and egg-to-adult viability in D. melanogaster. We found that the descriptors of the TPCs varied across traits (egg-to-adult viability, SMR, activity and fecundity), but variation in TPCs within these traits was small across studies when measured at the same time scales. The time scale at which traits were measured contributed to greater variation in TPCs than the observed variance across traits, although the relative importance of time scale differed depending on the trait (activity versus fecundity). Variation in the TPC across traits and time scales suggests that TPCs using single traits may not be an accurate predictor of fitness and thermal adaptation across environments.",2019,222,11,NA
Seasonality influences cuticle melanization and immune defense in a cricket: support for a temperature-dependent immune investment hypothesis in insects,"Fedorka, Kenneth M. and Copeland, Emily K. and Winterhalter, Wade E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.091538,"To improve thermoregulation in colder environments, insects are expected to darken their cuticles with melanin via the phenoloxidase cascade, a phenomenon predicted by the thermal melanin hypothesis. However, the phenoloxidase cascade also plays a significant role in insect immunity, leading to the additional hypothesis that the thermal environment indirectly shapes immune function via direct selection on cuticle color. Support for the latter hypothesis comes from the cricket Allonemobius socius, where cuticle darkness and immune-related phenoloxidase activity increase with latitude. However, thermal environments vary seasonally as well as geographically, suggesting that seasonal plasticity in immunity may also exist. Although seasonal fluctuations in vertebrate immune function are common (because of flux in breeding or resource abundance), seasonality in invertebrate immunity has not been widely explored. We addressed this possibility by rearing crickets in simulated summer and fall environments and assayed their cuticle color and immune function. Prior to estimating immunity, crickets were placed in a common environment to minimize metabolic rate differences. Individuals reared under fall-like conditions exhibited darker cuticles, greater phenoloxidase activity and greater resistance to the bacteria Serratia marcescens. These data support the hypothesis that changes in the thermal environment modify cuticle color, which indirectly shapes immune investment through pleiotropy. This hypothesis may represent a widespread mechanism governing immunity in numerous systems, considering that most insects operate in seasonally and geographically variable thermal environments.",2013,216,21,4005-4010
Elevated developmental temperatures impact the size and allometry of morphological traits of the bumblebee <i>Bombus terrestris</i>,"Gerard, Maxence and Guiraud, Marie and Cariou, Berenice and Henrion, Maxime and Baird, Emily",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.245728,"The impact of global warming on wild bee decline threatens the pollination services they provide. Exposure to temperatures above optimal during development is known to reduce adult body size but how it affects the development and scaling of body parts remains unclear. In bees, a reduction in body size and/or a reduction in body parts, such as the antennae, tongue and wings, and how they scale with body size (i.e. their allometry) could severely affect their fitness. To date, it remains unclear how temperature affects body size and the scaling of morphological traits in bees. To address this knowledge gap, we exposed both males and workers of Bombus terrestris to elevated temperature during development and assessed the effects on (i) the size of morphological traits and (ii) the allometry between these traits. Colonies were exposed to optimal (25 degrees C) or stressful (33 degrees C) temperatures. We then measured the body size, wing size, antenna and tongue length, as well as the allometry between these traits. We found that workers were smaller and the antennae of both castes were reduced at the higher temperature. However, tongue length and wing size were not affected by developmental temperature. The allometric scaling of the tongue was also affected by developmental temperature. Smaller body size and antennae could impair both individual and colony fitness, by affecting foraging efficiency and, consequently, colony development. Our results encourage further exploration of how the temperature-induced changes in morphology affect functional traits and pollination efficiency.",2023,226,8,NA
Salt-water acclimation of the estuarine crocodile <i>Crocodylus porosus</i> involves enhanced ion transport properties of the urodaeum and rectum,"Grosell, Martin and Heuer, Rachael M. and Wu, N.

Despite being known to undertake extensive movements throughout and between hypoosmotic and hyperosmotic environments, little is known about the role of the cloaca in coping with changes in salinity. We report here that, in addition to the well-documented functional plasticity of the lingual salt glands, the middle of the three cloacal segments (i.e. the urodaeum) responds to increased ambient salinity to enhance solute-coupled water absorption. This post-renal modification of urine serves to conserve water when exposed to hyperosmotic environments and, in conjunction with lingual salt gland secretions, enables C. porosus to maintain salt and water balance and thereby thrive in hyperosmotic environments. Isolated epithelia from the urodaeum of 70\% seawater-acclimated C. porosus had a strongly enhanced short-circuit current (an indicator of active ion transport) compared with freshwater-acclimated crocodiles. This enhanced active ion absorption was driven by increased Na+/K+-ATPase activity, and possibly enhanced proton pump activity, and was facilitated by the apical epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) and/or the apical Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE2), both of which are expressed in the urodaeum. NHE3 was expressed at very low levels in the urodaeum and probably does not contribute to solute-coupled water absorption in this cloacal segment. As C. porosus does not appear to drink water of salinities above 18 ppt, observations of elevated short-circuit current in the rectum as well as a trend for increased NHE2 expression in the oesophagus, the anterior intestine and the rectum suggest that dietary salt intake may stimulate salt and possibly water absorption by the gastrointestinal tract of C. porosus living in hyperosmotic environments.",2020,223,4,NA

The intertidal zone porcelain crab, Petrolisthes cinctipes, was used to study physiological responses to low pH in embryonic, larval and newly recruited juvenile life-history stages. In these crabs, embryonic development occurs in the pH-variable intertidal zone (pH 6.9-9.5), larvae mature in the more stable pelagic environment (pH 7.9-8.2), and juvenile crabs settle back into the pH-variable intertidal zone. We examined survival, cardiac performance, energetics and morphology in embryonic, larval and juvenile crabs exposed to two pH conditions (pH 7.9 and 7.6). Embryos and larvae were split by brood between the pH treatments for 9 days to examine brood-specific responses to low pH. Hatching success did not differ between pH conditions, but ranged from 30\% to 95\% among broods. Larval survival was not affected by acidification, but juvenile survival was reduced by similar to 30\% after longer (40 days) exposure to low pH. Embryonic and larval heart rates were 37\% and 20\% lower at low pH, and there was a brood-specific response in embryos. Embryos did not increase in volume under acidified conditions, compared with a 15\% increase in ambient conditions. We conclude that sustained exposure to low pH could be detrimental to P. cinctipes embryos and larvae despite the fact that embryos are regularly exposed to naturally fluctuating hypercapnic water in the intertidal zone. Importantly, our results indicate that early life-history stage responses to OA may be brood specific through as yet undetermined mechanisms.",2013,216,8,1405-1411
Developmental thermal plasticity of prey modifies the impact of predation,"Seebacher, Frank and Grigaltchik, Veronica S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.116558,"Environmental conditions during embryonic development can influence the mean expression of phenotypes as well as phenotypic responses to environmental change later in life. The resulting phenotypes may be better matched to their environment and more resilient to environmental change, including human-induced climate change. However, whether plasticity does improve success in an ecological context is unresolved. In a microcosm experiment, we show that developmental plasticity in embryos of the frog Limnodynastes peronii is beneficial by increasing survivorship of tadpoles in the presence of predators when egg incubation (15 or 25 degrees C) and tadpole acclimation temperature inmicrocosms(15 or 25 degrees C) coincided at 15 degrees C. Tadpoles that survived predation were smaller, and had faster burst swimming speeds than those kept in no-predator control conditions, but only at high (25 degrees C) egg incubation or subsequent microcosm temperatures. Metabolic rates were determined by a three-way interaction between incubation and microcosm temperatures and predation; maximal glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolic capacities (enzyme activities) were lower in survivors from predation compared with controls, particularly when eggs were incubated at 25 degrees C. We show that thermal conditions experienced during early development are ecologically relevant by modulating survivorship from predation. Importantly, developmental thermal plasticity also impacts population phenotypes indirectly by modifying species interactions and the selection pressure imposed by predation.",2015,218,9,1402-1409
Transgenerational plasticity responses of oysters to ocean acidification differ with habitat,"Parker, Laura M. and Scanes, Elliot and O'Connor, Wayne A. and Ross, Pauline M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.239269,"Transgenerational plasticity (TGP) has been identified as a critical mechanism of acclimation that may buffer marine organisms against climate change, yet whether the TGP response of marine organisms is altered depending on their habitat is unknown. Manymarine organisms are found in intertidal zones where they experience episodes of emersion (air exposure) daily as the tide rises and recedes. During episodes of emersion, the accumulation of metabolic carbon dioxide (CO2) leads to hypercapnia for many species. How this metabolic hypercapnia impacts the TGP response of marine organisms to climate change is unknown as all previous transgenerational studies have been done under subtidal conditions, where parents are constantly immersed. Here, we assess the capacity of the ecologically and economically important oyster, Saccostrea glomerata, to acclimate to elevated CO2 dependent on habitat, across its vertical distribution, from the subtidal to intertidal zone. Tidal habitat altered both the existing tolerance and transgenerational response of S. glomerata to elevated CO2. Overall, larvae fromparents conditioned in an intertidal habitat had a greater existing tolerance to elevated CO2 than larvae from parents conditioned in a subtidal habitat, but had a lower capacity for beneficial TGP following parental exposure to elevated CO2. Our results suggest that the TGP responses of marine species will not be uniform across their distribution and highlights the need to consider the habitat of a species when assessing TGP responses to climate change stressors.",2021,224,12,NA

Exposure to future conditions caused a decline in hatching success and larval survival. Growth, metabolic rates and thermal tolerance increased with temperature but decreased under acidified conditions. Hypercapnia and warming amplified the incidence of deformities by 31.5\% (including severe deformities such as lordosis, scoliosis and kyphosis), while promoting the occurrence of oversized otoliths (109.3\% increase).

Embryonic common snapping turtles (<i>Chelydra serpentina</i>) preferentially regulate intracellular tissue pH during acid-base challenges,"Shartau, Ryan B. and Crossley, II, Dane A. and Kohl, Zachary F. and Brauner, Colin J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.136119,"The nests of embryonic turtles naturally experience elevated CO2 (hypercarbia), which leads to increased blood P-CO2 and a respiratory acidosis, resulting in reduced blood pH {[}extracellular pH (pH(e))]. Some fishes preferentially regulate tissue pH {[}intracellular pH (pH(i))] against changes in pHe; this has been proposed to be associated with exceptional CO2 tolerance and has never been identified in amniotes. As embryonic turtles may be CO2 tolerant based on nesting strategy, we hypothesized that they preferentially regulate pH(i), conferring tolerance to severe acute acid-base challenges. This hypothesis was tested by investigating pH regulation in common snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina) reared in normoxia then exposed to hypercarbia (13 kPa PCO2) for 1 h at three developmental ages: 70\% and 90\% of incubation, and yearlings. Hypercarbia reduced pH(e) but not pH(i), at all developmental ages. At 70\% of incubation, pH(e) was depressed by 0.324 pH units while pH(i) of brain, white muscle and lung increased; heart, liver and kidney pHi remained unchanged. At 90\% of incubation, pH(e) was depressed by 0.352 pH units but heart pH(i) increased with no change in pH(i) of other tissues. Yearlings exhibited a pHe reduction of 0.235 pH units but had no changes in pH(i) of any tissues. The results indicate common snapping turtles preferentially regulate pH(i) during development, but the degree of response is reduced throughout development.

Will the Antarctic tardigrade <i>Acutuncus</i> <i>antarcticus</i> be able to withstand environmental stresses related to global climate change?,"Giovannini, Ilaria and Altiero, Tiziana and Guidetti, Roberto and Rebecchi, Lorena",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.160622,"Because conditions in continental Antarctica are highly selective and extremely hostile to life, its biota is depauperate, but well adapted to live in this region. Global climate change has the potential to impact continental Antarctic organisms because of increasing temperatures and ultraviolet radiation. This research evaluates how ongoing climate changes will affect Antarctic species, and whether Antarctic organisms will be able to adapt to the new environmental conditions. Tardigrades represent one of the main terrestrial components of Antarctic meiofauna; therefore, the pan-Antarctic tardigrade Acutuncus antarcticus was used as model to predict the fate of Antarctic meiofauna threatened by climate change. Acutuncus antarcticus individuals tolerate events of desiccation, increased temperature and UV radiation. Both hydrated and desiccated animals tolerate increases in UV radiation, even though the desiccated animals are more resistant. Nevertheless, the survivorship of hydrated and desiccated animals is negatively affected by the combination of temperature and UV radiation, with the hydrated animals being more tolerant than desiccated animals. Finally, UV radiation has a negative impact on the life history traits of successive generations of A. antarcticus, causing an increase in egg reabsorption and teratological events. In the long run, A. antarcticus could be at risk of population reductions or even extinction. Nevertheless, because the changes in global climate will proceed gradually and an overlapping of temperature and UV increase could be limited in time, A. antarcticus, as well as many other Antarctic organisms, could have the potential to overcome global warming stresses, and/or the time and capability to adapt to the new environmental conditions.",2018,221,4,NA

We therefore investigated the effect of elevated P-CO2 and temperature on locomotion and behaviour during prey searching in the marine gastropod Concholepas concholepas, a predator characteristic of the southeastern Pacific coast. Movement duration, decision time, route finding and lateralization were measured using a T-maze tank with a prey positioned behind a barrier. Four treatments, representing present day and near-future scenarios of ocean acidification and warming were used in rearing the individuals for 6 months. Regardless of the treatment, no significant differences were found in relative and absolute lateralization before and after exposure for 6 months. However, relative lateralization was not repeatable for animals tested after 6 months at elevated P-CO2 at both experimental temperatures, whereas it was repeatable in individuals kept at the present day level of P-CO2. We suggest that these effects may be related to a behavioural malfunction caused by elevated P-CO2. Movement duration, decision time and route finding were not repeatable. However, movement duration and decision time increased and route finding decreased in elevated P-CO2 (at 15 degrees C), suggesting that elevated P-CO2 has negative effects on the locomotor and sensory performance of C. concholepas in the presence of a prey odour, thereby decreasing their ability to forage efficiently.",2017,220,4,667-676

Here, we exposed the emerging model marine polychaete Ophryotrocha labronica to conditions simulating ocean warming and acidification, in isolation and in combination over five generations to identify: (i) how multiple versus single global change drivers alter both juvenile and adult life-history traits; (ii) the mechanistic link between adult physiological and fitness-related life-history traits; and (iii) whether the phenotypic changes observed over multiple generations are of plastic and/or adaptive origin. Two juvenile (developmental rate; survival to sexual maturity) and two adult (average reproductive body size; fecundity) life-history traits were measured in each generation, in addition to three physiological (cellular reactive oxygen species content, mitochondrial density, mitochondrial capacity) traits. We found that multi-generational exposure to warming alone caused an increase in juvenile developmental rate, reactive oxygen species production and mitochondrial density, decreases in average reproductive body size and fecundity, and fluctuations in mitochondrial capacity, relative to control conditions. Exposure to ocean acidification alone had only minor effects on juvenile developmental rate. Remarkably, when both drivers of global change were present, only mitochondrial capacity was significantly affected, suggesting that ocean warming and acidification act as opposing vectors of stress across multiple generations.",2017,220,4,551-563
Variation in developmental temperature alters adulthood plasticity of thermal tolerance in <i>Tigriopus californicus</i>,"Healy, Timothy M. and Bock, Antonia K. and Burton, Ronald S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.213405,"In response to environmental change, organisms rely on both genetic adaptation and phenotypic plasticity to adjust key traits that are necessary for survival and reproduction. Given the accelerating rate of climate change, plasticity may be particularly important. For organisms in warming aquatic habitats, upper thermal tolerance is likely to be a key trait, and many organisms express plasticity in this trait in response to developmental or adulthood temperatures. Although plasticity at one life stage may influence plasticity at another life stage, relatively little is known about this possibility for thermal tolerance. Here, we used locally adapted populations of the copepod Tigriopus californicus to investigate these potential effects in an intertidal ectotherm. We found that low latitude populations had greater critical thermal maxima (CTmax) than high latitude populations, and variation in developmental temperature altered CTmax plasticity in adults. After development at 25 degrees C, CTmax was plastic in adults, whereas no adulthood plasticity in this trait was observed after development at 20 degrees C. This pattern was identical across four populations, suggesting that local thermal adaptation has not shaped this effect among these populations. Differences in the capacities to maintain ATP synthesis rates and to induce heat shock proteins at high temperatures, two likely mechanisms of local adaptation in this species, were consistent with changes in CTmax owing to phenotypic plasticity, which suggests that there is likely mechanistic overlap between the effects of plasticity and adaptation. Together, these results indicate that developmental effects may have substantial impacts on upper thermal tolerance plasticity in adult ectotherms.",2019,222,22,NA
Respirometry reveals major lineage-based differences in the energetics of osmoregulation in aquatic invertebrates,"Cochran, Jamie K. and Banks, Catelyn and Buchwalter, David B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.246376,"All freshwater organisms are challenged to control their internal balance of water and ions in strongly hypotonic environments.

Consistent with available literature, we found a clear decrease in M O2 with increasing salinity in the snail Elimia sp. and crustaceans Hyalella azteca and Gammarus pulex (r5=-0.90, P=0.03). However, we show here for the first time that metabolic rate was unchanged by salinity in the aquatic insects, whereas ion transport rates were positively correlated with higher salinities. In contrast, when we examined the ionic influx rates in the freshwater snail and crustaceans, we found that Ca uptake rates were highest under the most dilute conditions, while Na uptake rates increased with salinity. In G. pulex exposed to a serially diluted ion matrix, Ca uptake rates were positively associated with M O2 (r5=-0.93, P=0.02). This positive association between Ca uptake rate and M O2 was also observed when conductivity was held constant but Ca concentration was manipulated (1.7-17.3 mg Ca l-1) (r5=0.94, P=0.05). This finding potentially implicates the cost of calcium uptake as a driver of increased metabolic rate under dilute conditions in organisms with calcified exoskeletons and suggests major phyletic differences in osmoregulatory physiology. Freshwater insects may be energetically challenged by higher salinities, while lower salinities may be more challenging for other freshwater taxa.",2023,226,20,NA

As a model organism, we used the amphipod Gammarus insensibilis, collected across latitudes along the western coast of the Adriatic Sea down to the southernmost limit of the species' distributional range, with individuals varying in body mass (0.4-13.57 mg).

Within the annual temperature range, the mass-specific SMR of small/young individuals increased with temperature at a greater rate (activation energy: E=0.48 eV) than large/old individuals (E=0.29 eV), with a higher metabolic level for high-latitude than low-latitude populations. However, under the forecasted climate conditions, the mass-specific SMR of large individuals responded differently across latitudes. Unlike the higher-latitude population, whose mass-specific SMR increased in response to the forecasted climate change across all size classes, in the lower-latitude populations, this increase was not seen in large individuals. The larger/older conspecifics at lower latitudes could therefore be the first to experience the negative impacts of warming on metabolism-related processes. Although the ecological collapse of such a basic trophic level (aquatic amphipods) owing to climate change would have profound consequences for population ecology, the risk is significantly mitigated by phenotypic and genotypic adaptation.",2022,225,22,NA
"Cross-generation plasticity in cold hardiness is associated with diapause, but not the non-diapause developmental pathway, in the blow fly <i>Calliphora vicina</i>","Coleman, Paul C. and Bale, Jeffrey S. and Hayward, Scott A. L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.098053,"Predicting insect responses to global climate change involves understanding cross-generation effects of temperature. The majority of temperate insects overwinter in a state of diapause, a pre-emptive response to winter conditions associated with increased cold hardiness. Diapause is often induced following maternal adult detection of an environmental cue signifying the onset of winter, whilst diapause is initiated in a subsequent life stage and/or generation. Continued global warming will expose adults to higher late-autumn temperatures, whilst diapause life stages will still experience prolonged winter cold. The cross-generation effect of temperature was investigated by acclimating adult Calliphora vicina to present-day (15 degrees C) and future (20 degrees C) late-autumn conditions and assessing cold-hardiness in diapause (D15 and D20) and non-diapause (ND15 and ND20) progeny. A cross-generation plasticity in cold hardiness was associated with D but not ND larvae. D15 larvae exhibited an enhanced ability to suppress internal freezing (supercooling point=- 18.9 +/- 0.9 degrees C) compared with D20 (- 15.3 +/- 0.8 degrees C), and displayed a greater tolerance of prolonged exposure to - 4 degrees C (LT50= 26.0 +/- 1.0 and 11.4 +/- 1.1 days, respectively) and - 8 degrees C (5.1 +/- 1.1 and 3.0 +/- 1.1 days, respectively). These changes were associated with a reduced glucose content in D15 (2.4 +/- 0.3 g mg(-1)) compared with D20 (3.0 +/- 0.3 g mg(-1)) larvae. In conclusion, C. vicina adults exposed to warmer autumn conditions during diapause induction will produce larvae with a reduced cold hardiness capacity, which could negatively impact winter survival. Given that maternal regulation of diapause is common among temperate insects, this could be a widespread phenomenon.",2014,217,9,1454-1461
Exposure to hot temperatures during lactation in Swiss mice stunts offspring growth and decreases future reproductive performance of female offspring,"Bao, Meng-Huan and Chen, Li-Bing and Hambly, Catherine and Speakman, John R. and Zhao, Zhi-Jun",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.223560,"Exposure to high temperatures (heatwaves) is rapidly emerging as an important issue of climate change, in particular for female mammals during lactation. High temperatures adversely affect the ability to dissipate heat, which has negative effects on reproductive output. The cumulative effects on growth of F1 offspring after weaning, and future reproductive performance of offspring, remain uncertain. In this study, F1 mice weaned from mothers lactating at 21 and 32.5 degrees C were housed at 21 degrees C from day 19 until day 56 of age, during which food intake and body mass were measured. The F1 adult females that were weaned at the two temperatures were bred and then exposed to 32.5 degrees C during lactation. Energy intake and milk output, and litter size and mass, were determined. The F1 adults weaned at 32.5 degrees C consumed less food and had lower body mass than their counterparts weaned at 21 degrees C. Several visceral organs or reproductive tissues were significantly lower in mass in F1 weaned at 32.5 degrees C than at 21 degrees C. The exposure to 32.5 degrees C significantly decreased energy intake, milk output and litter mass in F1 adult females during lactation. The F1 adult females weaned at 32.5 degrees C produced less milk and raised lighter pups than those previously weaned at 21 degrees C. The data suggest that transient exposure to hot temperatures during lactation has long-lasting impacts on offspring, including stunted growth and decreases in future reproductive performance when adult. This indicates that the offspring of females previously experiencing hot temperatures have a significant fitness disadvantage.",2020,223,9,NA
Ocean acidification affects calcareous tube growth in adults and reared offspring of serpulid polychaetes,"Diaz-Castaneda, Victoria and Cox, T.

The first goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of ocean acidification on calcified tube growth for two Serpulidae polychaete worms. Spirorbis sp. and Spirobranchus triqueter were collected at 11 m depth from the northwest Mediterranean Sea and maintained for 30 and 90 days at three mean pH(T) levels (total scale): 8.1 (ambient), 7.7 and 7.4. Moderately decreased tube elongation rates were observed in both species at pH(T) 7.7 while severe reductions occurred at pH(T) 7.4. There was visual evidence of dissolution and tubes were more fragile at lower pH but fragility was not attributed to changes in fracture toughness. Instead, it appeared to be due to the presence of larger alveoli covered in a thinner calcareous layer. The second objective of this study was to test for effects on S. triqueter offspring development. Spawning was induced, and offspring were reared in the same pH conditions that the parents experienced. Trochophore size was reduced at the lowest pH level but settlement success was similar across pH conditions. Post-settlement tube growth was most affected. At 38 days post-settlement, juvenile tubes at pH(T) 7.7 and 7.4 were half the size of those at pH(T) 8.1. The results suggest future carbonate chemistry will negatively affect the initiation and persistence of both biofouling and epiphytic polychaete tube worms.",2019,222,13,NA
Temperature during embryonic development has persistent effects on metabolic enzymes in the muscle of zebrafish,"Schnurr, Meghan E. and Yin, Yi and Scott, Graham R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.094037,"Global warming is intensifying interest in the physiological consequences of temperature change in ectotherms, but we still have a relatively poor understanding of the effects of temperature on early life stages. This study determined how embryonic temperature (T-E) affects development and the activity of metabolic enzymes in the swimming muscle of zebrafish. Embryos developed successfully to hatching (survival >= 88\%) from 22 to 32 degrees C, but suffered sharp increases in mortality outside of this range. Embryos that were incubated until hatching at a control TE (27 C) or near the extremes for successful development (22 or 32 C) were next raised to adulthood under control conditions at 27 C. Growth trajectories after hatching were altered in the 22 C and 32 C TE groups compared with 27 C TE controls, but growth slowed after 3 months of age in all groups. Maximal enzyme activities of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), citrate synthase (CS), hydroxyacyl-coA dehydrogenase (HOAD), pyruvate kinase (PK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were measured across a range of assay temperatures (22, 27, 32 and 36 C) in adults from each TE group that were acclimated to 27 or 32 C. Substrate affinities (Km) were also determined for COX and LDH. In adult fish acclimated to 27 C, COX and PK activities were higher in 22 C and 32 C TE groups than in 27 C TE controls, and the temperature optimum for COX activity was higher in the 32 C TE group than in the 22 C TE group. Warm acclimation reduced COX, CS and/or PK activities in the 22 and 32 C TE groups, possibly to compensate for thermal effects on molecular activity. This response did not occur in the 27 C TE controls, which instead increased LDH and HOAD activities. Warm acclimation also increased thermal sensitivity (Q(10)) of HOAD to cool temperatures across all TE groups. We conclude that the temperature experienced during early development can have a persistent impact on energy metabolism pathways and acclimation capacity in later life.",2014,217,8,1370-1380
Could plasticity mediate highlands lizards' resilience to climate change? A case study of the leopard iguana (<i>Diplolaemus leopardinus</i>) in Central Andes of Argentina,"Vicenzi, Nadia and Bacigalupe, Leonardo D. and Laspiur, Alejandro and Ibarguengoytia, Nora and Sassi, Paola L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.242647,"The predicted rise of global temperatures is of major concern for ectotherms because of its direct impact on their behavior and physiology. As physiological performance mediates a species' resilience to warming exposure, physiological plasticity could greatly reduce the susceptibility to climate change. We studied the degree to which Diplolaemus leopardinus lizards are able to adjust behavioral and physiological traits in response to short periods of temperature change. We used a split cross design to measure the acclimation response of preferred body temperature (T-p), and the thermal performance curve of resting metabolic rate (RMR) and evaporative water loss (EWL). Our results showed that plasticity differs among traits: whereas T-p and EWL showed lower values in warm conditions, the body temperature at which RMR was highest increased. Moreover, RMR was affected by thermal history, showing a large increase in response to cold exposure in the group initially acclimated to warm temperatures. The reduction of EWL and the increase in optimal temperature will give lizards the potential to partially mitigate the impact of rising temperatures in the energy cost and water balance. However, the decrease in T-p and the sensitivity to the warm thermal history of RMR could be detrimental to the energy net gain, increasing the species' vulnerability, especially considering the increase of heat waves predicted for the next 50 years. The integration of acclimation responses in behavioral and physiological traits provides a better understanding of the range of possible responses of lizards to cope with the upcoming climatic and environmental modifications expected as a result of climate change.",2021,224,14,NA
Rafting on floating fruit is effective for oceanic dispersal of flightless weevils,"Yeh, Hui-Ying and Tseng, Hui-Yun and Lin, Chung-Ping and Liao, Chen-Pan and Hsu, Jung-Ya and Huang, Wen-San",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.190488,"Terrestrial species, especially non-vagile ones (those unable to fly or swim), cannot cross oceans without exploiting other animals or floating objects. However, the colonisation history of flightless Pachyrhynchus weevils, inferred from genetic data, reveals their ability to travel long distances to colonise remote islands. Here, we used captive-bred Pachyrhynchus jitanasaius to analyse (i) the physiological tolerance of weevils (egg, larva and adult stages) to different levels of salinity; (ii) the survival rate of larvae in a simulated ocean environment in the laboratory; and (iii) the survival rate of larvae in a field experiment in the ocean using fruit of the fish poison tree floating on the Kuroshio current in the Pacific Ocean. We found that the survival rate of larvae in seawater was lower than in fresh water, although if the larvae survived 7 days of immersion in seawater, some emerged as adults in the subsequent rearing process. No adults survived for more than 2 days, regardless of salinity level. After floating separately for 6 days in salt water in the laboratory and in the Kuroshio current, two of 18 larvae survived in the fruit. This study provides the first empirical evidence that P. jitanasaius larvae can survive `rafting' on ocean currents and that the eggs and larvae of these weevils have the highest probability of crossing the oceanic barrier. This ability may facilitate over-the-sea dispersal of these flightless insects and further shape their distribution and speciation pattern in the Western Pacific islands.",2018,221,24,NA
Thermal strategies vary with life history stage,"Truebano, Manuela and Fenner, Phillip and Tills, Oliver and Rundle, Simon D. and Rezende, Enrico L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.171629,"With both global surface temperatures and the incidence and intensity of extreme temperature events projected to increase, the assessment of species' sensitivity to chronic and acute changes in temperature has become crucial. Sensitivity predictions are based predominantly on adult responses, despite the fact that early life stages may be more vulnerable to thermal challenge. Here, we compared the sensitivity of different life history stages of the intertidal gastropod Littorina obtusata using thermal death time curves, which incorporate the intensity and duration of heat stress, and used these to calculate upper critical thermal limits (CTmax) and sensitivity to temperature change (z). Early (larval) life stages had both a lower CTmax and a lower z than adults, suggesting they are less good at withstanding short-term extreme thermal challenges but better able to survive moderate temperatures in the long term. This result supports the predicted trade-off between acute and chronic tolerance to thermal stress, and is consistent with the different thermal challenges that these stages encounter in the intertidal zone. We conclude that different life history stages employ different thermal strategies that may be adaptive. Our findings caution against the use of predictions of the impact of global warming that are based on only adult responses and, hence, which may underestimate vulnerability.",2018,221,8,NA
Differential impacts of ocean acidification and warming on winter and summer progeny of a coastal squid (<i>Loligo vulgaris</i>),"Rosa, Rui and Truebenbach, Katja and Pimentel, Marta S. and Boavida-Portugal, Joana and Faleiro, Filipa and Baptista, Miguel and Dionisio, Gisela and Calado, Ricardo and Poertner, Hans O. and Repolho, Tiago",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.096081,"Little is known about the capacity of early life stages to undergo hypercapnic and thermal acclimation under the future scenarios of ocean acidification and warming. Here, we investigated a comprehensive set of biological responses to these climate change-related variables (2 degrees C above winter and summer average spawning temperatures and Delta pH=0.5 units) during the early ontogeny of the squid Loligo vulgaris. Embryo survival rates ranged from 92\% to 96\% under present-day temperature (13-17 degrees C) and pH (8.0) scenarios. Yet, ocean acidification (pH 7.5) and summer warming (19 degrees C) led to a significant drop in the survival rates of summer embryos (47\%, P<0.05). The embryonic period was shortened by increasing temperature in both pH treatments (P<0.05). Embryo growth rates increased significantly with temperature under present-day scenarios, but there was a significant trend reversal under future summer warming conditions (P<0.05). Besides pronounced premature hatching, a higher percentage of abnormalities was found in summer embryos exposed to future warming and lower pH (P<0.05). Under the hypercapnic scenario, oxygen consumption rates decreased significantly in late embryos and newly hatched paralarvae, especially in the summer period (P<0.05). Concomitantly, there was a significant enhancement of the heat shock response (HSP70/HSC70) with warming in both pH treatments and developmental stages. Upper thermal tolerance limits were positively influenced by acclimation temperature, and such thresholds were significantly higher in late embryos than in hatchlings under present-day conditions (P<0.05). In contrast, the upper thermal tolerance limits under hypercapnia were higher in hatchlings than in embryos. Thus, we show that the stressful abiotic conditions inside the embryo's capsules will be exacerbated under near-future ocean acidification and summer warming scenarios. The occurrence of prolonged embryogenesis along with lowered thermal tolerance limits under such conditions is expected to negatively affect the survival success of squid early life stages during the summer spawning period, but not winter spawning.",2014,217,4,518-525
Microclimate buffering and thermal tolerance across elevations in a tropical butterfly,"Montejo-Kovacevich, Gabriela and Martin, Simon H. and Meier, I, Joana and Bacquet, Caroline N. and Monllor, Monica and Jiggins, Chris D. and Nadeau, Nicola J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.220426,"Microclimatic variability in tropical forests plays a key role in shaping species distributions and their ability to cope with environmental change, especially for ectotherms. Nonetheless, currently available climatic datasets lack data from the forest interior and, furthermore, our knowledge of thermal tolerance among tropical ectotherms is limited. We therefore studied natural variation in the microclimate experienced by tropical butterflies in the genus Heliconius across their Andean range in a single year. We found that the forest strongly buffers temperature and humidity in the understorey, especially in the lowlands, where temperatures are more extreme. There were systematic differences between our yearly records and macroclimate databases (WorldClim2), with lower interpolated minimum temperatures and maximum temperatures higher than expected. We then assessed thermal tolerance of 10 Heliconius butterfly species in the wild and found that populations at high elevations had significantly lower heat tolerance than those at lower elevations. However, when we reared populations of the widespread H. erato from high and low elevations in a common-garden environment, the difference in heat tolerance across elevations was reduced, indicating plasticity in this trait. Microclimate buffering is not currently captured in publicly available datasets, but could be crucial for enabling upland shifting of species sensitive to heat such as highland Heliconius. Plasticity in thermal tolerance may alleviate the effects of global warming on some widespread ectotherm species, but more research is needed to understand the long-term consequences of plasticity on populations and species.",2020,223,8,NA
Thermal tolerance in the urban heat island: thermal sensitivity varies ontogenetically and differs between embryos of two sympatric ectotherms,"Hall, Joshua M. and Warner, Daniel A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.210708,"Most studies of thermal tolerance use adults, but early-life stages (e.g. embryos) are often more sensitive to thermal agitation. Studies that examine effects on embryos rarely assess the potential for thermal tolerance to change with ontogeny or how effects differ among sympatric species, and often utilize unrealistic temperature treatments. We used thermal fluctuations from nests within the urbanheat island to determine how thermal tolerance of embryos changes across development and differs among two sympatric lizard species (Antis sagrei and Antis cristatefius). We applied fluctuations that varied in frequency and magnitude at different times during development and measured effects on embryo physiology and survival, and hatchling morphology, growth and survival. Thermal tolerance differed between the species by similar to 2 degrees C: embryos of A. sagrei, a lizard that prefers warmer, open-canopy microhabitats, were more robust to thermal stress than embryos of A. cristatellus, which prefers cooler, closed-canopy microhabitats. Moreover, thermal tolerance changed through development; however, the nature of this change differed between the species. For A. cristatellus, thermal tolerance was greatest mid-development. For A. sagrei, the relationship was not statistically clear. The greatest effects of thermal stress were on embryo and hatchling survival and embryo physiology. Hatchling morphology and growth were less affected. Inter-specific responses and the timing of stochastic thermal events with respect to development have important effects on embryo mortality. Thus, research that integrates ecologically meaningful thermal treatments, considers multiple life-history stages and examines interspecific responses will be critical to make robust predictions of the impacts of global change on wildlife.",2019,222,19,NA

We determined if developmental ALAN exposure (1) affects development, (2) affects adult phenotype, including heat and desiccation tolerance, and (3) affects and/or interacts with life-history strategy. We used the variable field cricket (Gryllus lineaticeps) because its geographic range is increasingly exposed to ALAN, heat, and drought conditions, and it exhibits different life-history strategies (flight-capability versus flight-incapability). ALAN affected adult phenotype, with positive effects on body mass (and size) and female reproductive investment, and a negative effect on heat tolerance. Life-history strategy also affected stress tolerance; flight-incapable females had greater heat tolerance and their desiccation tolerance was improved by ALAN exposure. Key features of environmental change (i.e. exposure to ALAN, heat and drought) may favor some life-history strategies over others.",2023,226,4,NA
Hotter nests produce hatchling lizards with lower thermal tolerance,"Dayananda, Buddhi and Murray, Brad R. and Webb, Jonathan K.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.152272,"In many regions, the frequency and duration of summer heatwaves is predicted to increase in future. Hotter summers could result in higher temperatures inside lizard nests, potentially exposing embryos to thermally stressful conditions during development. Potentially, developmentally plastic shifts in thermal tolerance could allow lizards to adapt to climate warming. To determine how higher nest temperatures affect the thermal tolerance of hatchling geckos, we incubated eggs of the rock-dwelling velvet gecko, Amalosia lesueurii, at two fluctuating temperature regimes to mimic current nest temperatures (mean 23.2 degrees C, range 10-33 degrees C, `cold') and future nest temperatures (mean 27.0 degrees C, range 14-37 degrees C, `hot'). Hatchlings from the hot incubation group hatched 27 days earlier and had a lower critical thermal maximum (CTmax 38.7 degrees C) and a higher critical thermal minimum (CTmin 6.2 degrees C) than hatchlings from cold incubation group (40.2 and 5.7 degrees C, respectively). In the field, hatchlings typically settle under rocks near communal nests. During the hatching period, rock temperatures ranged from 13 to 59 degrees C, and regularly exceeded the CTmax of both hot- and cold-incubated hatchlings. Because rock temperatures were so high, the heat tolerance of lizards had little effect on their ability to exploit rocks as retreat sites. Instead, the timing of hatching dictated whether lizards could exploit rocks as retreat sites; that is, cold-incubated lizards that hatched later encountered less thermally stressful environments than earlier hatching hot-incubated lizards. In conclusion, we found no evidence that CTmax can shift upwards in response to higher incubation temperatures, suggesting that hotter summers may increase the vulnerability of lizards to climate warming.",2017,220,12,2159-2165
Independent effects of seawater pH and high <i>P</i><sub>CO2</sub> on olfactory sensitivity in fish: possible role of carbonic anhydrase,"Velez, Zelia and Costa, Rita A. and Wang, Wenjing and Hubbard, Peter C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.238485,"Ocean acidificationmay alter olfactory-driven behaviour in fish by direct effects on the peripheral olfactory system; olfactory sensitivity is reduced in CO2-acidified seawater. The current study tested whether this is due to elevated P-CO2 or the consequent reduction in seawater pH and, if the former, the possible involvement of carbonic anhydrase, the enzyme responsible for the hydration of CO2 and production of carbonic acid. Olfactory sensitivity to amino acids was assessed by extracellularmulti-unit recording from the olfactory nerve of the gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata L.) in normal seawater (pH similar to 8.2), and after acute exposure to acidified seawater (pH similar to 7.7) but normal P-CO2 (similar to 340 mu atm) or to high P-CO2 seawater (similar to 1400 mu atm) at normal pH (similar to 8.2). Reduced pH in the absence of elevated P-CO2 caused a reduction in olfactory sensitivity to L-serine, L-leucine, L-arginine and L-glutamine, but not L-glutamic acid. Increased P-CO2 in the absence of changes in pH caused reduced olfactory sensitivity to L-serine, L-leucine and L-arginine, including increases in their threshold of detection, but had no effect on sensitivity to L-glutamine and L-glutamic acid. Inclusion of 1 mmol l(-1) acetazolamide (a membrane-permeant inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase) in the seawater reversed the inhibition of olfactory sensitivity to L-serine caused by high P-CO2. Ocean acidification may reduce olfactory sensitivity by reductions in seawater pH and intracellular pH (of olfactory receptor neurones); the former by reducing odorant-receptor affinity, and the latter by reducing the efficiency of olfactory transduction. The physiological role of carbonic anhydrase in the olfactory receptor neurones remains to be explored.",2021,224,6,NA

However, despite its wide use and potential off-target impacts, its underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we used Bombus impatiens to examine whether CO2 impacts are mediated by anoxia and whether these mechanisms differ between female castes or following mating in queens. We examined the behavior, physiology and gene expression of workers, mated queens and virgin queens following exposure to anoxia, hypoxia, full and partial hypercapnia, and controls. Hypercapnia and anoxia caused immobilization, but only hypercapnia resulted in behavioral, physiological and molecular impacts in bees. Recovery from hypercapnia resulted in increased abdominal contractions and took longer in queens. Additionally, hypercapnia activated the ovaries of queens, but inhibited those of workers in a dose-dependent manner and caused a depletion of fat-body lipids in both castes. All responses to hypercapnia were weaker following mating in queens. Analysis of gene expression related to hypoxia and hypercapnia supported the physiological findings in queens, demonstrating that the overall impacts of CO2, excluding virgin queen ovaries, were unique and were not induced by anoxia. This study contributes to our understanding of the impacts and the mechanistic basis of CO2 narcosis in insects and its impacts on bee physiology.

Mangrove rivulus (Kryptolebias marmoratus) were exposed to 1 week of normocapnic control water (pH8), air, hypercapnia (5\% CO2, pH 6.8) or isocapnic acidosis (pH 6.8). We found that the density of CO2/H+ chemoreceptive neuroepithelial cells (NECs) was increased in hypercapnia or isocapnic acidosis-exposed fish. Projection area (a measure of cell size) was unchanged. Acute exposure to progressive hypercapnia induced the fish to emerse (leave water) at water pH values similar to 6.1, whereas addition of HCl to water caused a more variable response with a lower pH threshold (similar to pH 5.5). These results support our hypothesis and suggest that aquatic hypercapnia provides an adequate stimulus for extant amphibious fishes to temporarily transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitats.",2015,218,19,2987-2990
Flea fitness is reduced by high fractional concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> that simulate levels found in their hosts' burrows,"Downs, Cynthia J. and Pinshow, Berry and Khokhlova, Irina S. and Krasnov, Boris R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.122812,"Nidicolous ectoparasites such as fleas and gamasid mites that feed on small and medium-sized mammals spend much of their time in their hosts' burrows, which provide an environment for living, and often feeding, to their pre-imaginal and/or adult stages. Thus, these ectoparasites should be adapted to environmental conditions in burrows, including high fractional concentrations of CO2 (F-CO2). We examined how a high F-CO2 (0.04) affected survival and reproductive success of a hematophagous ectoparasite of burrowing rodents using fleas Xenopsylla ramesis and Sundevall's jirds Meriones crassus. In the first experiment, fleas fed on hosts housed in high-CO2 (F-CO2 = 0.04) or atmospheric-CO2 (F-CO2 approximate to 0.0004) air, and were allowed to breed. In a second experiment, fleas were maintained in high CO2 or CO2-free air with no hosts to determine how CO2 levels affect survival and activity levels. We found that at high F-CO2 fleas laid fewer eggs, reducing reproductive success. In addition, at high F-CO2, activity levels and survival of fleas were reduced. Our results indicate that fleas do not perform well in the F-CO2 used in this experiment. Previous research indicated that the type and intensity of the effects of CO2 concentration on the fitness of an insect depend on the F-CO2 used, so we advise caution when generalizing inferences drawn to insects exposed to other F-CO2. If, however, F-CO2 found in natural mammal burrows brings about reduced fitness in fleas in general, then burrowing hosts may benefit from reduced parasite infestation if burrow air F-CO2 is high.",2015,218,22,3596-3603
Impact of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> background levels on the host-seeking behaviour of <i>Aedes aegypti</i>,"Majeed, Shahid and Hill, Sharon Rose and Ignell, Rickard",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.092718,"Mosquitoes rely on carbon dioxide (CO2) to detect and orient towards their blood hosts. However, the variable and rapid fluctuations of atmospheric CO2 concentrations may have an impact on the host-seeking behaviour of mosquitoes. In this study, we analysed the effect of transient elevated background levels of CO2 on the host-seeking behaviour and the physiological characteristics of the CO2-sensitive olfactory receptor neurones (ORNs) in female yellow fever mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti. We show that the take-off and source contact behaviour of A. aegypti is impeded at elevated background levels of CO2 as a result of masking of the stimulus signal. The mechanism underlying this masking during take-off behaviour is one of sensory constraint. We show that the net response of the CO2-ORNs regulates this CO2-related behaviour. Since these neurones themselves are not habituated or fatigued by the transient elevation of background CO2, we propose that habituation of second-order neurones in response to the elevated CO2-ORN activity could be one mechanism by which the net response is transduced by the olfactory system. The findings from this study may help to predict future shifts in mosquito-host interactions and consequently to predict vectorial capacity in the light of climate change.",2014,217,4,598-604

The humpbacked conch (Gibberulus gibberulus gibbosus), inhabiting subtidal zones of the Great Barrier Reef, was chosen as a model because vigorous jumping, causing increased oxygen uptake ((M) over dot O-2), can be induced by exposure to odour from a predatory cone snail (Conus marmoreus).

Jumping caused a 4-to 6-fold increase in ((M) over dot O-2), and ((M) over dot O-2,(max)) increased with temperature so that absolute aerobic scope was maintained even at 38 degrees C, although factorial scope was reduced. The humpbacked conch has a high hypoxia tolerance with a PO2, crit of 2.5 kPa at 28 degrees C and 3.5 kPa at 33 degrees C. There was no effect of elevated CO2 on respiratory performance at any temperature. Long-term temperature records and our field measurements suggest that habitat temperature rarely exceeds 32.6 degrees C during the summer, indicating that these snails have aerobic capacity in excess of current and future needs.",2015,218,19,2991-3001
"Effects of temperature on acid-base regulation, gill ventilation and air breathing in the clown knifefish, <i>Chitala ornata</i>","Le Thi Hong Gam and Do Thi Thanh Huong and Dang Diem Tuong and Nguyen Thanh Phuong and Jensen, Frank Bo and Wang, Tobias and Bayley, Mark",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.216481,"Chitala ornata is a facultative air-breathing fish, which at low temperatures shows an arterial P-CO2 (Pa-CO2) level only slightly elevated above that of water breathers. By holding fish with indwelling catheters at temperatures from 25 to 36 degrees C and measuring blood gasses, we show that this animal follows the ubiquitous poikilotherm pattern of reducing arterial pH with increasing temperature. Surprisingly, the temperature increase caused an elevation of Pa-CO2 from 5 to 12 mmHg while the plasma bicarbonate concentration remained constant at around 8 mmol l(-1). The temperature increase also gave rise to a larger fractional increase in air breathing than in gill ventilation frequency. These findings suggest that air breathing, and hence the partitioning of gas exchange, is to some extent regulated by acid-base status in air-breathing fish and that these bimodal breathers will be increasingly likely to adopt respiratory pH control as temperature rises, providing an interesting avenue for future research.",2020,223,4,NA
Experimental evolution of response to anoxia in <i>Drosophila</i> <i>melanogaster</i>: recovery of locomotion following CO<sub>2</sub> or N<sub>2</sub> exposure,"Xiao, Chengfeng and Fard, Niki Bayat and Brzezinski, Kaylen and Robertson, R. Meldrum and Chippindale, Adam K.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.199521,"Many insects enter coma upon exposure to anoxia, a feature routinely exploited by experimentalists to handle them. But the genetic and physiological bases of anoxic coma induction and recovery are only partially understood, as are the long-term consequences for the animal's performance. We examined three populations of Drosophila melanogaster (designated B) that have been inadvertently under selection for rapid recovery from CO2 exposure for nearly 40 years (around 1000 generations) resulting from routine maintenance practices. We contrasted CO2 and N-2 (presumed a less reactive gas) knockdown and recovery times of these B flies with six populations of common ancestry (A and C populations) that were not exposed to CO2 over the same period. We found that B populations showed faster and more consistent locomotor recovery than A or C populations after CO2 knockdown, a result also observed with N-2 knockdown. A and C populations showed much higher variance in recovery time after CO2 exposure than after N-2 exposure, suggesting gas-specific effects on pathways associated with locomotor recovery. Although these selection treatments result in considerable variation in life history attributes and body size, with the characteristic intermediacy of B populations, their superiority in resistance to gas exposure and locomotor recovery suggests that this is a direct consequence of prior repeated exposure to anoxia, broadly, and CO2, specifically. Hence we describe a powerful new evolutionary model for the genetic and physiological investigation of anoxic coma in insects.",2019,222,14,NA
Metabolic cost of freeze thaw and source of CO<sub>2</sub> production in the freeze-tolerant cricket <i>Gryllus veletis</i>,"Smith, Adam and Turnbull, Kurtis F. and Moulton, Julian H. and Sinclair, Brent J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.234419,"Freeze-tolerant insects can survive the conversion of a substantial portion of their body water to ice. While the process of freezing induces active responses from some organisms, these responses appear absent from freeze-tolerant insects. Recovery from freezing likely requires energy expenditure to repair tissues and re-establish homeostasis, which should be evident as elevations in metabolic rate after thaw. We measured carbon dioxide (CO2) production in the spring field cricket (Gryllus veletis) as a proxy for metabolic rate during cooling, freezing and thawing and compared the metabolic costs associated with recovery from freezing and chilling. We hypothesized that freezing does not induce active responses, but that recovery from freeze-thaw is metabolically costly. We observed a burst of CO2 release at the onset of freezing in all crickets that froze, including those killed by either cyanide or an insecticide (thiacloprid), implying that the source of this CO2 was neither aerobic metabolism nor a coordinated nervous system response. These results suggest that freezing does not induce active responses from G. veletis, but may liberate buffered CO2 from hemolymph. There was a transient `overshoot' in CO2 release during the first hour of recovery, and elevated metabolic rate at 24, 48 and 72 h, in crickets that had been frozen compared with crickets that had been chilled (but not frozen). Thus, recovery from freeze-thaw and the repair of freeze-induced damage appears metabolically costly in G. veletis, and this cost persists for several days after thawing.",2021,224,1,NA
"Cutaneous water collection by a moisture-harvesting lizard, the thorny devil (<i>Moloch horridus</i>)","Comanns, Philipp and Withers, Philip C. and Esser, Falk J. and Baumgartner, Werner",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.148791,"Moisture-harvesting lizards, such as the Australian thorny devil, Moloch horridus, have the remarkable ability to inhabit arid regions. Special skin structures, comprising a micro-structured surface with capillary channels in between imbricate overlapping scales, enable the lizard to collect water by capillarity and transport it to the mouth for ingestion. The ecological role of this mechanism is the acquisition of water from various possible sources such as rainfall, puddles, dew, condensation on the skin, or absorption from moist sand, and we evaluate here the potential of these various sources for water uptake by M. horridus. The water volume required to fill the skin capillary system is 3.19\% of body mass. Thorny devils standing in water can fill their capillary system and then drink from this water, at approximately 0.7 mu l per jaw movement. Thorny devils standing on nearly saturated moist sand could only fill the capillary channels to 59\% of their capacity, and did not drink. However, placing moist sand on skin replicas showed that the capillary channels could be filled from moist sand when assisted by gravity, suggesting that their field behaviour of shovelling moist sand onto the dorsal skin might fill the capillary channels and enable drinking. Condensation facilitated by thermal disequilibrium between a cool thorny devil and warm moist air provided skin capillary filling to approximately 0.22\% of body weight, which was insufficient for drinking. Our results suggest that rain and moist sand seem to be ecologically likely water sources for M. horridus on a regular basis.",2016,219,21,3473-3479

Consequently, the geographic origin of an organism can influence its responses to environmental changes, and therefore its sensitivity to combined global change drivers. This study aimed at determining the physiological responses of the northern shrimp, Pandalus borealis, at different levels of biological organization and from four different geographic origins, exposed to elevated temperature and low pH to define its sensitivity to future ocean warming and acidification. Shrimp sampled within the northwest Atlantic were exposed for 30 days to combinations of three temperature (2, 6 or 10 \& DEG;C) and two pH levels (7.75 or 7.40). Survival, metabolic rates, whole-organism aerobic performance and cellular energetic capacity were assessed at the end of the exposure. Our results show that shrimp survival was negatively affected by temperature above 6 \& DEG;C and low pH, regardless of their origin. Additionally, shrimp from different origins show overall similar whole-organism performances: aerobic scope increasing with increasing temperature and decreasing with decreasing pH. Finally, the stability of aerobic metabolism appears to be related to cellular adjustments specific to shrimp origin. Our results show that the level of intraspecific variation differs among levels of biological organization: different cellular capacities lead to similar individual performances. Thus, the sensitivity of the northern shrimp to ocean warming and acidification is overall comparable among origins. Nonetheless, shrimp vulnerability to predicted global change scenarios for 2100 could differ among origins owing to different regional environmental conditions.",2023,226,16,NA
Physiological responses of wild zebra finches (<i>Taeniopygia guttata</i>) to heatwaves,"Cooper, Christine Elizabeth and Hurley, Laura Leilani and Deviche, Pierre and Griffith, Simon Charles",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.225524,"Desert birds inhabit hot, dry environments that are becoming hotter and drier as a consequence of dimate change. Extreme weather such as heatwaves can cause mass-mortality events that may significantly impact populations and species. There are currently insufficient data concerning physiological plasticity to inform models of species' response to extreme events and develop mitigation strategies. Consequently, we examine here the physiological plasticity of a small desert bird in response to hot (mean maximum ambient temperature=42.7 degrees C) and cooler (mean maximum ambient temperature=31.4 degrees C) periods during a single Austral summer. We measured body mass, metabolic rate, evaporative water loss and body temperature, along with blood parameters (corticosterone, glucose and uric acid) of wild zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) to assess their physiological state and determine the mechanisms by which they respond to heatwaves. Hot days were not significant stressors; they did not result in modification of baseline blood parameters or an inability to maintain body mass, provided drinking water was available. During heatwaves, finches shifted their thermoneutral zone to higher temperatures. They reduced metabolic heat production, evaporative water loss and wet thermal conductance, and increased hyperthermia, especially when exposed to high ambient temperature. A consideration of the significant physiological plasticity that we have demonstrated to achieve more favourable heat and water balance is essential for effectively modelling and planning for the impacts of climate change on biodiversity.",2020,223,12,NA
Freshwater adaptation in prickly sculpin (Pisces: Cottidae): intraspecific comparisons reveal evidence for water pH and Na plus concentration driving diversity in gill H plus -ATPase and ion regulation br,"Liu, Shuang and Wilson, Jonathan M. and Taylor, Eric B. and Richards, Jeffrey G.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.243500,"Phenotypic divergence is a hallmark of adaptive radiation. One example involves differentiation in physiological traits involved in ion regulation among species with contrasting lifestyles and living in distinct environments. Differentiation in ion regulation and its ecological implications among populations within species are, however, less well understood. To address this knowledge gap, we collected prickly sculpin (Cottus asper) from distinct habitat types including coastal rivers connected to estuaries, coastal lakes and interior lakes, all from British Columbia, Canada. We tested for differences in plasma Na+ and Cl-, gill Na+/K+-ATPase and H+- ATPase activity and protein abundance as well as changes in body mass and arterial blood pH in fish sampled from the field and acclimated to two different freshwater conditions in the laboratory: artificial lake water (ALW) and ion-poor water (IPW). We also tested for links between environmental water chemistry and the physiological characteristics associated with ion regulation. Transfer to IPW resulted in upregulation of gill Na+/K+-ATPase and H+-ATPase activity as well as increases in gill H+-ATPase protein expression level in each habitat compared with that in the common ALW treatment. Despite the presence of population-within-habitat-type differences, significant habitat-type effects were revealed in most of the ion regulation characteristics examined under different acclimation conditions. Significantly lower plasma Cl- was detected in fish from coastal rivers than in fish from the other two habitat types during the IPW treatment, which was also significantly lower compared with that in ALW. Similarly, gill Na+/K+-ATPase activity was lower in the coastal river populations in IPW than in fish from coastal and interior lakes, which was not in accordance with the protein expression in the gill. For gill H+-ATPase, fish from interior lake populations had the highest level of activity across all habitat types under all conditions, which was related to the protein levels in the gill. The activity of gill H+-ATPase was positively correlated with the combined effect of water Na+ and pH under the ALW treatment. Our results suggest that variation in habitat may be an important factor driving differences in gill Na+/K+- ATPase and H+-ATPase activity across populations of C. asper. Further, the combined effect of water Na+ and pH may have played a key role in physiological adaptation in C. asper during post-glacial freshwater colonization and dispersal.",2022,225,18,NA

However, the molecular mechanisms involved in their acclimation to different environmental salinities have remained largely unknown. In the present study, we acclimated kuruma shrimp (Marsupenaeus japonicus) at 1.7\%, 3.4\% and 4.0\% salinities. After acclimating for 6, 12, 24 and 72 h, we determined free amino acid concentrations in their abdominal muscle, and performed RNA sequencing analysis on this muscle. The concentrations of free amino acids were clearly altered depending on salinity after 24 h of acclimation. Glutamine and alanine concentrations were markedly increased following the increase of salinity. In association with such changes, many genes related to amino acid metabolism changed their expression levels. In particular, the increase of the expression level of the gene encoding glutamate-ammonia ligase, which functions in glutamine metabolism, appeared to be associated with the increased glutamine concentration at high salinity. Furthermore, the increased alanine concentration at high salinity was likely associated with the decrease in the expression levels of the the gene encoding alanine-glyoxylate transaminase. Thus, there is a possibility that changes in the concentration of free amino acids for osmoregulation in kuruma shrimp are regulated by changes in the expression levels of genes related to amino acid metabolism.",2018,221,11,NA
Limits to sustained energy intake. XXIX.

We quantified energy metabolism and milk production in female golden hamsters raising offspring under cold (8 degrees C), normal (22 degrees C) and hot (30 degrees C) ambient temperature conditions. We monitored energy intake, subcutaneous body temperature, daily energy expenditure, litter size and pup masses over the course of lactation. Our results show that, in line with the concept of heat dissipation limitation, female golden hamsters had the largest energy intake under the coldest conditions and a significantly lower intake at 30 degrees C (partial for influence of ambient temperature: F-2.403 =5.6; P=0.004). Metabolisable energy intake as well as milk energy output showed the same pattern and were significantly different between the temperatures (partial for milk energy production: F-1.40=86.4; P<0.0001), with consistently higher subcutaneous temperatures in the reproductive females (F-1(,813)=36.77; P<0.0001) compared with baseline females. These data suggest that raising offspring in golden hamsters comes at the cost of producing large amounts of body heat up to a level constraining energy intake, similar to that observed in some laboratory mice. Notably, we observed that females seemed to adjust litter size according to their milk production, with the smallest litters (3.4 +/- 0.7 pups) being raised by hot-exposed mothers. Future research is needed to unravel the mechanism by which females assess their own milk production capabilities and how this may be linked to litter size at different ambient temperatures. Golden hamsters reach 8-10 times resting metabolic rate when raising offspring under cold conditions, which is compatible with the findings from laboratory mice and other rodents.",2018,221,21,NA

To understand the differing susceptibility of desert birds to increasing temperatures, we examined thermoregulatory performance and estimated heat tolerance limits (HTLs) for three Sonoran Desert nesting bird species - Gambel's quail, mourning doves and white-winged doves. Using flow-through respirometry we measured daytime resting metabolism, evaporative water loss and real-time body temperature at air temperatures (T-air) from 30 degrees C to 66 degrees C. We found marked increases in resting metabolism at the upper critical temperature (T-uc), which was significantly lower in the quail (T-air=41.1 degrees C) than in both dove species (T-air=45.9-46.5 degrees C). Gambel's quail maintained low resting metabolic rates and low rates of evaporative water loss at their T-uc (0.71 W and 1.20 g H2O h(-1), respectively), but were more sensitive to increasing air temperature, reaching their HTL at T-air of 52 degrees C. Mourning doves and white-winged doves maintained low resting metabolic rates (0.66 and 0.94 W), but higher rates of evaporative water loss (1.91 and 2.99 g H2O h(-1)) at their T-uc and reached their HTL at T-air of 58-60 degrees C. Mass-specific evaporative water loss in white-winged doves (147 g) and mourning doves (104 g) was 45\% and 30\% greater, respectively, than the rate observed in Gambel's quail (161 g) at T-air of 48 degrees C. Higher rates of evaporation and higher T-uc made the doves exceptionally heat tolerant, allowing them to maintain body temperatures at least 14 degrees C below air temperatures as high as 60 degrees C (140 degrees F).",2015,218,22,3636-3646

Detrimental effects of Al toxicity on aquatic organisms are well known and can have consequences for survival. Fish exposed to Al in low pH waters will experience physiological and neuroendocrine changes that disrupt homeostasis and alter behavior. To investigate the effects of Al exposure on both the brain and behavior, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) kept in water treated with Al (pH. 5.7, 0.37 +/- 0.04 mu mol 1(-1) Al) for 2 weeks were compared with fish kept in under control conditions (pH. 6.7, <0.04 mu mol 1(-1) Al). Fish exposed to Al and acidic conditions had increased Al accumulation in the gills and decreased gill Na+, K+-ATPase activity, which impaired osmoregulatory capacity and caused physiological stress, indicated by elevated plasma cortisol and glucose levels. Here we show for the first time that exposure to Al in acidic conditions also impaired learning performance in a maze task. Al toxicity also reduced the expression of NeuroD1 transcript levels in the forebrain of exposed fish. As in mammals, these data show that exposure to chronic stress, such as acidified Al, can reduce neural plasticity during behavioral challenges in salmon, and may impair the ability to cope with new environments.",2013,216,16,3148-3155
Effects of temperature and salinity on body fluid dynamics and metabolism in the estuarine diamondback terrapin (<i>Malaclemys terrapin</i>),"Williard, Amanda Southwood and Harden, Leigh Anne and Jones, T. Todd and Midway, Stephen R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.202390,"The diamondback terrapin is the only temperate turtle species that exclusively inhabits estuarine environments. Morphological, behavioral and physiological features contribute to the terrapin's ability to regulate body fluid osmotic pressure in a euryhaline environment. Low integument permeability combined with aquatic-terrestrial shuttling behavior limits passive exchange of water and salts with the environment, and terrapins regulate active uptake of salts via alterations in drinking and feeding behavior. The lachrymal salt gland facilitates excretion of excess sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) ions through active transport mechanisms. We investigated body fluid dynamics, oxygen consumption ((V) over dot O-2) and osmotic status of terrapins exposed to an acute increase in salinity (12 to 35 psu) at 10 and 25 degrees C to gain insight into the relative importance of behavioral versus physiological osmoregulatory adjustments over a range of seasonally relevant temperatures. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate the effects of experimental temperature, salinity and mass. Overall, temperature effects were stronger than salinity effects. Terrapins acclimated to 25 degrees C had significantly lower blood osmolality and Na+, and higher water turnover rates, daily water flux (DWF) and (V) over dot O-2 compared with terrapins acclimated to 10 degrees C. Salinity effects were restricted to DWF, which significantly decreased in response to acute exposure to 35 psu.

Temperature-dependent variation in gas exchange patterns and spiracular control in <i>Rhodnius prolixus</i>,"Heinrich, Erica and Bradley, Timothy",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.103986,"Insects display an array of respiratory behaviors, including the use of discontinuous gas exchange. This pattern is characterized by periods of spiracular closure, micro-openings (flutter), and complete openings during which the majority of gas exchange takes place. A current model of insect spiracular control suggests that spiracles are controlled by two interacting feedback loops, which produce the discontinuous pattern. The flutter period is thought to be initiated by a critically low partial pressure of oxygen, while the open period is initiated by a critically high CO2 threshold. The goal of our study was to test this control model under conditions of feeding-induced or temperature-induced changes in metabolic rate. We manipulated the metabolic rate of the insect Rhodnius prolixus using two discrete mechanisms: (1) feeding the insects a bloodmeal or (2) exposing them to a range of temperatures (18-38 degrees C). Examining the variation in the gas exchange patterns produced by insects in each of these treatments allowed us to determine whether spiracular control is sensitive to metabolic rate and/or temperature. We found that increases in temperature caused significant decreases in open phase burst volumes and premature abandonment of discontinuous gas exchange cycles. These effects were not observed in fed individuals maintained at a single temperature despite their higher metabolic rates. Our results indicate that some part of the spiracular control mechanism is temperature sensitive, suggesting a possible role for pH in CO2 sensing.",2014,217,15,2752-2760

Here, we examined seasonal variation in metabolic rate and evaporative water loss of worker bees, and seasonal variation of hive temperature and relative humidity (RH), for the stingless bee Austroplebeia essingtoni (Apidae: Meliponini) in arid tropical Australia. Both water loss and metabolic rate were lower in the cooler, dry winter than in the hot, wet summer at most ambient temperatures between 20 degrees C and 45 degrees C. Contrary to expectation, thermal tolerance thresholds were higher in the winter than in the summer. Hives were cooler in the cooler, dry winter than in the hot, wet summer, linked to an apparent lack of hive thermoregulation. The RH of hives was regulated at approximately 65\% in both seasons, which is higher than unoccupied control hives in the dry season, but less than unoccupied control hives in the wet season. Although adaptations to promote water balance appear more important for survival of A. essingtoni than traits related to temperature regulation, their capacity for water conservation is coincident with increased thermal tolerance. For these small, eusocial stingless bees in the arid tropics, where air temperatures are relatively high and stable compared with temperate areas, regulation of hive humidity appears to be of more importance than temperature for maintaining hive health.",2016,219,10,1552-1562

The maximal flicker frequency of the retina was reduced by continuous exposure to elevated CO2, potentially impairing the capacity of fish to react to fast events. This effect was rapidly counteracted by treatment with a GABA antagonist (gabazine), indicating that GABAA receptor function is disrupted by elevated CO2.

We hypothesised that arterial pH decreases at high, but not at low, temperatures when toads (Rhinella marina) and snakes (Python molurus) are exposed to hyperoxia. In toads, hyperoxia caused similar elevations of arterial P-CO2 at 20 and 30degree celsius, indicative of a temperature-independent oxygen-mediated drive to breathing, whereas P(CO2 )was unaffected by hyperoxia in snakes at 25 and 35degree celsius.

Salinity had marked effects on hypoxia tolerance, with fish acclimated to 11 and 35 ppt showing much longer time to loss of equilibrium (LOE) in hypoxia than 0 ppt-acclimated fish. Fish acclimated to 11 ppt (isosmotic salinity) exhibited the greatest capacity to regulate oxygen consumption rate ((M) over dot(O2)) under hypoxia, as measured through the regulation index (RI) and P-crit. At 35 ppt, fish had a higher routine metabolic rate (RMR) but a lower RI than fish at 11 ppt, but there were no differences in gill morphology, ventilation or blood O-2 transport properties between these groups. In contrast, 0 ppt-acclimated fish had the highest ventilation and lowest O-2 extraction efficiency in normoxia and hypoxia, indicating a higher ventilatory workload in order to maintain similar levels of (M) over doO(2). These differences were related to alterations in gill morphology, where 0 ppt-acclimated fish had the smallest lamellar surface area with the greatest epithelial cell coverage (i.e. thicker lamellae, longer diffusion distance) and a larger interlamellar cell mass, contrasting with 11 ppt-acclimated fish, which had overall the highest respiratory surface area.

Evaporative cooling via panting and its metabolic and water balance costs for lizards in the American Southwest,"Loughran, Caleb L. and Wolf, Blair O.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.243877,"In lizards there is considerable variation in the ability to dissipate environmental/endogenous heat loads through evaporative cooling via panting, which effects how long lizards can spend exposed to high solar heat loads. We recently described the differing capacities of lizards to depress body temperature (T-b) through evaporative cooling via panting. Here, we link panting and T-b depression with rates of evaporative water loss and its metabolic costs under high heat loads. We used flow-through respirometry to measure evaporative water loss rates and metabolism of 17 lizard species from the American Southwest while simultaneously measuring T-b. We exposed lizards to air temperatures (T-a) ranging from 35 degrees C to their critical thermal maximum (CTmax) while marking the onset of panting. We then estimated pre-panting Q(10) values for metabolism to partition increases in metabolism associated with the van't Hoff effect from the mechanical cost of panting with increasing heat loads. We found that evaporative cooling costs substantially varied among species, with panting effort significantly affecting lizards' evaporative capacity. Lizard evaporation rates ranged from 0.32 to 1.5 g H2O h(-1), with individuals losing as much as 6\% h(-1) of body mass while panting. Lizards also experienced an increase of up to 7.9-fold in metabolic rate while panting, although the overall energetic costs of panting remained relatively low compared with evaporative water costs. Across species, there was a significant positive relationship between the overall rate of evaporative heat loss and the maximum T-a-T-b gradient a species could maintain. While evaporative cooling may be an effective mechanism for reducing Tb and extending activity in hot environments for many species, it has significant metabolic and water balance costs that should be considered, as habitats with high environmental heat loads can be especially costly to an animal's water budgets.",2023,226,3,NA

It burrows into mud during the dry season, is highly tolerant of air exposure, and experiences severe hypoxia both in its natural habitat and in aquaculture. To study the ability of M. albus to compensate for respiratory acidosis, we implanted catheters to sample both arterial blood and urine during hypercapnia (4\% CO2) in either water or air, or during whole-animal air exposure. These hypercapnic challenges caused an immediate reduction in arterial pH, followed by progressive compensation through a marked elevation of plasma HCO3- over the course of 72 h. There was no appreciable rise in urinary acid excretion in fish exposed to hypercapnia in water, although urine pH was reduced and ammonia excretion did increase. In the air-exposed fish, however, hypercapnia was attended by a large elevation of ammonia in the urine and a large rise in titratable acid excretion. The time course of the increased renal acid excretion overlapped with the time period required to elevate plasma HCO3-, and we estimate that the renal compensation contributed significantly to whole-body acid-base compensation.",2019,222,9,NA
Two lines of evidence for physiological control of insensible evaporative water loss by a tiny marsupial,"Cooper, Christine Elizabeth and Withers, Philip Carew",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.234450,"We present two independent lines of evidence that a tiny dasyurid marsupial, the ningaui (Ningaui spp.), has acute physiological control of its insensible evaporative water loss below and within thermoneutrality. Perturbation of the driving force for evaporation by varying relative humidity, and therefore the water vapour pressure deficit between the animal and the ambient air, does not have the expected physical effect on evaporative water loss. Exposure to a helox atmosphere also does not have the expected physical effect of increasing evaporative water loss for live ningauis (despite it having the expected effect of increasing heat loss for live ningauis), but increases evaporative water loss for dead ningauis. We discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of both experimental approaches for demonstrating physiological control of insensible evaporative water loss. An appreciation of physiological control is important because insensible evaporative water loss contributes to both water and heat balance, is clearly under environmental selection pressure, and potentially impacts the distribution of endotherms and their response to environmental change.",2020,223,23,NA
Ionoregulatory aspects of the hypoxia-induced osmorespiratory compromise in the euryhaline Atlantic killifish (<i>Fundulus heteroclitus</i>): the effects of salinity,"Giacomin, Marina and Onukwufor, John O. and Schulte, Patricia M. and Wood, Chris M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.216309,"The osmorespiratory compromise is a physiological trade-off between the characteristics of the gill that promote respiratory gas exchange and those that limit passive flux of ions and water with the environment. In hypoxia, changes in gill blood flow patterns and functional surface area that increase gas transfer can promote an exacerbation in ion and water flux. Our goal was to determine whether the osmorespiratory compromise is flexible, depending on environmental salinity (fresh, isosmotic and sea water) and oxygen levels (hypoxia) in euryhaline killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus. Plasma ion concentrations were minimally affected by hypoxia, indicating a maintenance of osmoregulatory homeostasis. In freshwater killifish, hypoxia exposure reduced branchial Na+/K+-ATPase and NEM-sensitive ATPase activities, as well as diffusive water flux rates. Unidirectional Na+ influx and Na+ efflux decreased during hypoxia in freshwater, but net Na+ flux remained unchanged. Net loss rates of Cl-, K+. and ammonia were also attenuated in hypoxia, suggesting both transcellular and paracellular reductions in permeability. These reductions appeared to be regulated phenomena as fluxes were restored immediately in normoxia. Na+ flux rates increased during hypoxia in 11 ppt, but decreased in 35 ppt, the latter suggesting a similar response to hypoxia to that in freshwater. In summary, freshwater and seawater killifish experience a reduction in gill permeability, as seen in other hypoxia-tolerant species. Fish acclimated to isosmotic salinity increased Na+ influx and efflux rates, as well as paracellular permeability in hypoxia, responses in accord with the predictions of the classic osmorespiratory compromise.",2020,223,13,NA
Cardiorespiratory adjustments to chronic environmental warming improve hypoxia tolerance in European perch (<i>Perca fluviatilis</i>),"Ekstrom, Andreas and Sundell, Erika and Morgenroth, Daniel and McArley, Tristan and Gardmark, Anna and Huss, Magnus and Sandblom, Erik",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.241554,"Aquatic hypoxia will become increasingly prevalent in the future as a result of eutrophication combined with climate warming. While short-term warming typically constrains fish hypoxia tolerance, many fishes cope with warming by adjusting physiological traits through thermal acclimation. Yet, little is known about how such adjustments affect tolerance to hypoxia. We examined European perch (Perca fluviatilis) from the Biotest enclosure (23 degrees C, Biotest population), a unique similar to 1 km(2) ecosystem artificially warmed by cooling water from a nuclear power plant, and an adjacent reference site (16-18 degrees C, reference population). Specifically, we evaluated howacute and chronic warming affect routine oxygen consumption rate (<(M)over dot>(O2,routine)) and cardiovascular performance in acute hypoxia, alongside assessment of the thermal acclimation of the aerobic contribution to hypoxia tolerance (critical O-2 tension for <(M)over dot>(O2,routine): P-crit) and absolute hypoxia tolerance (O-2 tension at loss of equilibrium; P-LOE). Chronic adjustments (possibly across lifetime or generations) alleviated energetic costs of warming in Biotest perch by depressing <(M)over dot>(O2,routine) and cardiac output, and by increasing blood O-2 carrying capacity relative to reference perch acutely warmed to 23 degrees C. These adjustments were associated with improved maintenance of cardiovascular function and <(M)over dot>(O2,routine) in hypoxia (i.e. reduced P-crit). However, while P-crit was only partially thermally compensated in Biotest perch, they had superior absolute hypoxia tolerance (i.e. lowest P-LOE) relative to reference perch irrespective of temperature. We show that European perch can thermally adjust physiological traits to safeguard and even improve hypoxia tolerance during chronic environmental warming. This points to cautious optimism that eurythermal fish species may be resilient to the imposition of impaired hypoxia tolerance with climate warming.",2021,224,6,NA
Rates of hypoxia induction alter mechanisms of O<sub>2</sub> uptake and the critical O<sub>2</sub> tension of goldfish,"Regan, Matthew D. and Richards, Jeffrey G.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.154948,"The rate of hypoxia induction (RHI) is an important but overlooked dimension of environmental hypoxia that may affect an organism's survival. We hypothesized that, compared with rapid RHI, gradual RHI will afford an organism more time to alter plastic phenotypes associated with O-2 uptake and subsequently reduce the critical O-2 tension (P-crit) of the rate of O-2 uptake (M-O2). We investigated this by determining Pcrit values for goldfish exposed to short (similar to 24 min), typical (similar to 84 min) and long (similar to 480 min) duration P-crit trials to represent different RHIs. Consistent with our predictions, long duration P-crit trials yielded significantly lower P-crit values (1.0-1.4 kPa) than short and typical duration trials, which did not differ (2.6 +/- 0.3 and 2.5 +/- 0.2 kPa, respectively). Parallel experiments revealed these timerelated shifts in P(cri)t were associated with changes to aspects of the O-2 transport cascade that took place over the hypoxia exposures: gill surface areas and haemoglobin-O-2 binding affinities were significantly higher in fish exposed to gradual RHIs over 480 min than fish exposed to rapid RHIs over 60 min. Our results also revealed that the choice of respirometric technique (i. e. closed versus intermittent) does not affect Pcrit or routine M-O2, despite the significantly reduced water pH and elevated CO2 and ammonia levels measured following closed-circuit P-crit trials of similar to 90 min. Together, our results demonstrate that gradual RHIs result in alterations to physiological parameters that enhance O-2 uptake in hypoxic environments. An organism's innate P-crit is therefore most accurately determined using rapid RHIs (< 90 min) so as to avoid the confounding effects of hypoxic acclimation.",2017,220,14,2536-2544
"The effects of elevated temperature on the sexual traits, immunology and survivorship of a tropical ectotherm","Breckels, Ross D. and Neff, Bryan D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.084962,"In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projected an average global air temperature increase of 1.1-6.4 degrees C by the end of the 21st century. Although the tropics are predicted to experience less extreme temperature increases than regions of higher latitude, tropical ectotherms live close to their thermal limits, and are thus particularly vulnerable to increases in temperature. In this study, we examined how predicted patterns of global warming will affect survival and sexual traits in the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata). Guppies were exposed from birth to one of four temperature treatments: 23, 25 (control), 28 or 30 degrees C. We measured brood survival and, at sexual maturity, male ornamentation, sperm traits and immune response. Our results show that increases in temperature result in guppies that have shorter, slower sperm but that there is an optimum temperature for ornamental hue at 28 degrees C. Given the importance of sperm quality for reproduction, these results suggest population viability could be affected by warming. However, we found no difference in brood survival or immune response to a novel antigen across the treatments, indicating that survival may not be as vulnerable as previously thought. Overall, our data suggest that male sexual traits, and in particular sperm performance, are more sensitive than survival to a warming environment.",2013,216,14,2658-2664
Avian thermoregulation in the heat: evaporative cooling capacity and thermal tolerance in two Australian parrots,"McWhorter, Todd J. and Gerson, Alexander R. and Talbot, William A. and Smith, Eric Krabbe and McKechnie, Andrew E. and Wolf, Blair O.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.168930,"Avian orders differ in their thermoregulatory capabilities and tolerance of high environmental temperatures. Evaporative heat loss, and the primary avenue whereby it occurs, differs amongst taxa. Although Australian parrots (Psittaciformes) have been impacted by mass mortality events associated with extreme weather events (heat waves), their thermoregulatory physiology has not been well characterized. We quantified the upper limits to thermoregulation under extremely hot conditions in two Australian parrots: the mulga parrot (Psephotellus varius; similar to 55 g) and the galah (Eolophus roseicapilla; similar to 265 g). At air temperatures (T-a) exceeding body temperature (T-b), both species showed increases in Tb to maximum values around 43-44 degrees C, accompanied by rapid increases in resting metabolic rate above clearly defined upper critical limits of thermoneutrality and increases in evaporative water loss to levels equivalent to 700-1000\% of baseline rates at thermoneutral Ta. Maximumcooling capacity, quantified as the fraction of metabolic heat production dissipated evaporatively, ranged from 1.71 to 1.79, consistent with the known range for parrots, similar to the corresponding range in passerines, and well below the corresponding ranges for columbids and caprimulgids. Heat tolerance limit (the maximum Ta tolerated) ranged from 44 to 55 degrees C, similar to the range reported for passerines, but lower than that reported for columbids and caprimulgids. Our data suggest that heat tolerance in parrots is similar to that in passerines. We argue that understanding how thermoregulatory capacity and heat tolerance vary across avian orders is vital for predicting how climate change and the associated increase in frequency of extreme weather events may impact avian populations in the future.",2018,221,6,NA

These three factors have frequently been found to interact, complicating the formulation of broad models predicting metabolic rates and hence ecological functioning. In this first study of the effects of warming and ocean acidification, and their potential interaction, on metabolic rate across a broad range in body size (two to three orders of magnitude difference in body mass), we addressed the impact of climate change on the sea urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma in context with climate projections for southeast Australia, an ocean warming hotspot. Urchins were gradually introduced to two temperatures (18 and 23 degrees C) and two pH levels (7.5 and 8.0), at which they were maintained for 2 months. Identical experimental trials separated by several weeks validated the fact that a new physiological steady state had been reached, otherwise known as acclimation. The relationship between body size, temperature and acidification on the metabolic rate of H. erythrogramma was strikingly stable. Both stressors caused increases in metabolic rate: 20\% for temperature and 19\% for pH. Combined effects were additive: a 44\% increase in metabolism. Body size had a highly stable relationship with metabolic rate regardless of temperature or pH. None of these diverse drivers of metabolism interacted or modulated the effects of the others, highlighting the partitioned nature of how each influences metabolic rate, and the importance of achieving a full acclimation state. Despite these increases in energetic demand there was very limited capacity for compensatory modulating of feeding rate; food consumption increased only in the very smallest specimens, and only in response to temperature, and not pH. Our data show that warming, acidification and body size all substantially affect metabolism and are highly consistent and partitioned in their effects, and for H. erythrogramma, near-future climate change will incur a substantial energetic cost.",2016,219,8,1178-1186
Short-term dehydration influences baseline but not stress-induced corticosterone levels in the house sparrow (<i>Passer domesticus</i>),"Brischoux, Francois and Beaugeard, Erika and Mohring, Bertille and Parenteau, Charline and Angelier, Frederic",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.216424,"Future environmental variations linked to climate change are expected to influence precipitation regimes and thus drinking water availability. Dehydration can be a particularly challenging physiological state for most organisms, yet no study has examined the effect of dehydration on the functioning of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis in wild endothermic animals, despite its central role in maintaining homeostasis. In this study, we experimentally imposed a temporary water shortage (similar to 20 h) on captive house sparrows in order to investigate the consequences of short-term dehydration on baseline and stress-induced corticosterone levels. As expected, water-deprived birds displayed higher plasma osmolality and haematocrit. Additionally, water-deprived birds had lower defecation rates, suggesting that the mechanisms allowing caecal water absorption may be triggered very rapidly during water deprivation. Baseline but not stress-induced corticosterone levels were higher in water-deprived birds. Taken together, these results suggest that water restriction may have critical consequences on several corticosterone-related traits such as energy budget (protein catabolism and possibly feeding reduction), enhanced mobility (to promote water acquisition) and potential responses to predators (thirst threshold overriding the acute stress response). Owing to the possible fitness consequences of such components of the day-to-day life of birds, further studies should aim at investigating the influence of future changes in precipitation regimes and drinking water availability on bird populations.",2020,223,3,NA

To understand new possible pathways of sensitivity to CO2 in marine ectotherms, we examined the metabolic plasticity of S. spallanzanii exposed in situ to elevated P-CO2 by measuring fundamental metabolite and carbonic anhydrase concentrations. We show that whilst this species can survive elevated P-CO2 conditions in the short term, and exhibits an increase in energy metabolism, this is accompanied by a significant decrease in carbonic anhydrase concentration. These homeostatic changes are unlikely to be sustainable in the longer term, indicating S. spallanzanii may struggle with future high P-CO2 conditions.",2015,218,14,2148-2151
Tolerance of an acutewarming challenge declines with body mass in Nile tilapia: evidence of a link to capacity for oxygen uptake,"Blasco, Felipe R. and Taylor, Edwin W. and Leite, Cleo A. C. and Monteiro, Diana A. and Rantin, F. Tadeu and McKenzie, David J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.244287,"It has been proposed that larger individuals within fish species may be more sensitive to global warming, as a result of limitations in their capacity to provide oxygen for aerobic metabolic activities. This could affect size distributions of populations in a warmer world but evidence is lacking. In Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus (n=18, mass range 21-313 g), capacity to provide oxygen for aerobic activities (aerobic scope) was independent of mass at an acclimation temperature of 26 degrees C. Tolerance of acute warming, however, declined significantly with mass when evaluated as the critical temperature for fatigue from aerobic swimming (CTSmax). The CTSmax protocol challenges a fish to meet the oxygen demands of constant aerobic exercise while their demands for basal metabolism are accelerated by incremental warming, culminating in fatigue. CTSmax elicited pronounced increases in oxygen uptake in the tilapia but the maximum rates achieved prior to fatigue declined very significantly with mass. Mass-related variation in CTSmax and maximum oxygen uptake rates were positively correlated, which may indicate a causal relationship. When fish populations are faced with acute thermal stress, larger individuals may become constrained in their ability to perform aerobic activities at lower temperatures than smaller conspecifics. This could affect survival and fitness of larger fish in a future world with more frequent and extreme heatwaves, with consequences for population productivity.",2022,225,16,NA
Oxygen delivery does not limit thermal tolerance in a tropical eurythermal crustacean,"Ern, Rasmus and Do Thi Thanh Huong and Nguyen Thanh Phuong and Wang, Tobias and Bayley, Mark",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.094169,"In aquatic environments, rising water temperatures reduce water oxygen content while increasing oxygen demand, leading several authors to propose cardiorespiratory oxygen transport capacity as the main determinant of aquatic animal fitness. It has also been argued that tropical species, compared with temperate species, live very close to their upper thermal limit and hence are vulnerable to even small elevations in temperature. Little, however, is known about physiological responses to high temperatures in tropical species. Here we report that the tropical giant freshwater shrimp (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) maintains normal growth when challenged by a temperature rise of 6 degrees C above the present day average (from 27 degrees C to 33 degrees C). Further, by measuring heart rate, gill ventilation rate, resting and maximum oxygen uptake, and hemolymph lactate, we show that oxygen transport capacity is maintained up to the critical maximum temperature around 41 degrees C. In M. rosenbergii heart rate and gill ventilation rate increases exponentially until immediately below critical temperatures and at 38 degrees C animals still retained more than 76\% of aerobic scope measured at 30 degrees C, and there was no indication of anaerobic metabolism at the high temperatures. Our study shows that the oxygen transport capacity is maintained at high temperatures, and that other mechanisms, such as protein dysfunction, are responsible for the loss of ecological performance at elevated temperatures.",2014,217,5,809-814
Disparate responses to salinity across species and organizational levels in anchialine shrimps,"Havird, Justin C. and Meyer, Eli and Fujita, Yoshihisa and Vaught, Rebecca C. and Henry, Raymond P. and Santos, Scott R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.211920,"Environmentally induced plasticity in gene expression is one of the underlying mechanisms of adaptation to habitats with variable environments. For example, euryhaline crustaceans show predictable changes in the expression of ion-transporter genes during salinity transfers, although studies have typically been limited to specific genes, taxa and ecosystems of interest. Here, we investigated responses to salinity change at multiple organizational levels in five species of shrimp representing at least three independent invasions of the anchialine ecosystem, defined as habitats with marine and freshwater influences with spatial and temporal fluctuations in salinity. Although all five species were generally strong osmoregulators, salinity-induced changes in gill physiology and gene expression were highly species specific. While some species exhibited patterns similar to those of previously studied euryhaline crustaceans, instances of distinct and atypical patterns were recovered from closely related species. Species-specific patterns were found when examining: (1) numbers and identities of differentially expressed genes, (2) salinity-induced expression of genes predicted a priori to play a role in osmoregulation, and (3) salinity-induced expression of orthologs shared among all species. Notably, ion transport genes were unchanged in the atyid Halocaridina rubra while genes normally associated with vision and light perception were among those most highly upregulated. Potential reasons for species-specific patterns are discussed, including variation among anchialine habitats in salinity regimes and divergent evolution in anchialine taxa.

The two polymorphs of its major haemoglobin type (Hbl) show an inverse change in frequency along a latitudinal temperature dine in the North East Atlantic, which has been associated with differences in population performance and behavioural traits. An earlier study at the northern distribution limit of the species reported differential temperature sensitivities of red blood cell oxygen (O-2) affinity between the northern cold-water Hbl-2 polymorph and its southern. warm-water Hbl-1 counter-part, which has since widely been held as adaptive for the species across its distributional range. The present study critically re-examined this hypothesis by comparing the thermal sensitivity of O-2 binding in both purified Hbl polymorphs from the southern, high-temperature distribution limit of the species under controlled conditions of allosteric modifiers of Hb function. Contrary to the prevailing view, the O-2 affinity of the major Hbl polymorphs did not differ from each other under any of the tested conditions. Depending on pH and ATP concentration, the temperature-sensitive and temperature-insensitive Hb-O-2 affinity phenotypes - previously exclusively ascribed to Hbl-1 and Hbl-2, respectively - could be induced in both Hbl polymorphs. These results are the first to establish a molecular mechanism behind a reversed temperature dependence of red blood cell O-2 affinity in a non-endotherm fish and lay the basis for future studies on alternative mechanisms behind the differences in distribution, performance and behavioural traits associated with the different Hbl polymorphs of Atlantic cod.",2019,222,12,NA
Population-specific responses in eastern oysters exposed to low salinity in the northern Gulf of Mexico,"Sirovy, Kyle A. and Casas, Sandra M. and La Peyre, Jerome F. and Kelly, Morgan W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.244315,"Eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica, are facing rapid environmental changes in the northern Gulf of Mexico and can respond to these changes via plasticity or evolution. Plastic responses can immediately buffer against environmental changes, although this buffering may impact the organism's ability to evolve in subsequent generations. While plasticity and evolution are not mutually exclusive, the relative contribution and interaction between them remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the roles of plastic and evolved responses of C. virginica acclimated to low salinity using a common garden experiment with four populations exposed to two salinities. We used three transcriptomic analyses (edgeR, PERMANOVA and WGCNA) combined with physiology data to identify the effect of genotype (population), environment (salinity) and the genotype-environment interaction on both whole-organism and molecular phenotypes. We demonstrate that variation in gene expression is mainly driven by population, with relatively small changes in response to salinity. In contrast, the morphology and physiology data reveal that salinity has a larger influence on oyster performance than the population of origin. All analyses lacked signatures of the genotypexenvironment interaction and, in contrast to previous studies, we found no evidence for population-specific responses to low salinity. However, individuals from the highest salinity estuary displayed highly divergent gene expression from that of other populations, which could potentially drive population-specific responses to other stressors. Our findings suggest that C. virginica largely rely on plasticity in physiology to buffer the effects of low salinity, but that these changes in physiology do not rely on large persistent changes in gene expression.",2023,226,14,NA

While light calcification decreased 20\% under elevated versus ambient P-CO2 for colonies in low-density aggregations, light calcification of high-density aggregations increased 23\% at elevated versus ambient P-CO2. As a result, densely aggregated corals maintained calcification rates over 24 h that were comparable to those maintained under ambient P-CO2, despite a 45\% decrease in dark calcification at elevated versus ambient P-CO2. Additionally, densely aggregated corals experienced reduced flow speeds and higher seawater retention times between colonies owing to the formation of eddies.

Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) from a subarctic population were reared at a high and a low temperature (15 and 8 degrees C) for 1 month under natural, decreasing day length during late summer. Liver transcriptomes were compared between samples collected in the middle and towards the end of the light period and in the middle of the dark period. Daily variation in transcription was lower in fish from the low temperature compared with strong daily variation in warm-acclimated fish, suggesting that cold temperatures dampen the cycling of transcriptional rhythms under a simultaneously decreasing day length.

We exposed wild-caught birds to progressively increasing air temperatures (T-a) and measured resting metabolic rate (RMR), evaporative water loss (EWL), body temperature (T-b) and heat tolerance limits (HTL; the maximum T-a reached). Comparatively low RMR values were observed in both species, T-b approximated T-a at 40 degrees C and mild hyperthermia occurred as T-a was increased toward the HTL. Elf owls and screechowls reached HTLs of 48 and 52 degrees C, respectively, and RMR increased to 1.5 and 1.9 times thermoneutral values. Rates of EWL at the HTL allowed for the dissipation of 167-198\% of metabolic heat production (MHP). Gular flutter was used as the primary means of evaporative heat dissipation and produced large increases in evaporative heat loss (44-100\%), accompanied by only small increases (<5\%) in RMR.

Thermoregulatory consequences of salt loading in the lizard <i>Pogona vitticeps</i>,"Scarpellini, Carolina da Silveira and Bicego, Kenia C. and Tattersall, Glenn J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.116723,"Previous research has demonstrated that dehydration increases the threshold temperature for panting and decreases the thermal preference of lizards. Conversely, it is unknown whether thermoregulatory responses such as shuttling and gaping are similarly influenced. Shuttling, as an active behavioural response, is considered one of the most effective thermoregulatory behaviours, whereas gaping has been proposed to be involved in preventing brain over-heating in lizards. In this study we examined the effect of salt loading, a proxy for increased plasma osmolality, on shuttling and gaping in Pogona vitticeps. Then, we determined the upper and lower escape ambient temperatures (UETa and LETa), the percentage of time spent gaping, the metabolic rate ((V) over dot(O2)), the evaporative water loss (EWL) during gaping and non-gaping intervals and the evaporative effectiveness (EWL/(V) over dot(O2)) of gaping. All experiments were performed under isotonic (154 mmol l(-1)) and hypertonic saline injections (625, 1250 or 2500 mmol l(-1)). Only the highest concentration of hypertonic saline altered the UETa and LETa, but this effect appeared to be the result of diminishing the animal's propensity to move, instead of any direct reduction in thermoregulatory set-points. Nevertheless, the percentage of time spent gaping was proportionally reduced according to the saline concentration; (V) over dot(O2) was also decreased after salt loading. Thermographic images revealed lower head than body surface temperatures during gaping; however this difference was inhibited after salt loading. Our data suggest that EWL/(V) over dot(O2) is raised during gaping, possibly contributing to an increase in heat transfer away from the lizard, and playing a role in head or brain cooling.",2015,218,8,1166-1174
Climate change and invasive species: a physiological performance comparison of invasive and endemic bees in Fiji,"da Silva, Carmen R.

Invasive species are often expected to have broad thermal tolerance, be highly plastic, or have high adaptive potential when faced with novel environments. Tropical island ectotherms are expected to be vulnerable to climate change as they often have narrow thermal tolerance and limited plasticity. In Fiji, only one species of endemic bee, Homalictus fijiensis, is commonly found in the lowland regions, but two invasive bee species, Braunsapis puangensis and Ceratina dentipes, have recently been introduced into Fiji. These introduced species pollinate invasive plants and might compete with H. fijiensis and other native pollinators for resources. To test whether certain performance traits promote invasiveness of some species, and to determine which species are the most vulnerable to climate change, we compared the thermal tolerance, desiccation resistance, metabolic rate and seasonal performance adjustments of endemic and invasive bees in Fiji. The two invasive species tended to be more resistant to thermal and desiccation stress than H. fijiensis, while H. fijiensis had greater capacity to adjust their CTmax with season, and H. fijiensis females tended to have higher metabolic rates than B. puangensis females. These findings provide mixed support for current hypotheses for the functional basis of the success of invasive species; however, we expect the invasive bees in Fiji to be more resilient to climate change because of their increased thermal tolerance and desiccation resistance.",2021,224,1,NA
Water restriction increases oxidation of endogenous amino acids in house sparrows (Passer domesticus),"Rogers, Elizabeth J. and Gerson, Alexander R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.246483,"Animals can cope with dehydration in a myriad of ways, both behaviorally and physiologically. The oxidation of protein produces more metabolic water per kilojoule than that of fat or carbohydrate, and it is well established that birds increase protein catabolism in response to high rates of water loss. However, the fate of amino acids mobilized in response to water restriction has not been explicitly determined. While protein catabolism releases bound water, we hypothesized that water-restricted birds would also oxidize the resulting amino acids, producing additional water as a product of oxidative phosphorylation. To test this, we fed captive house sparrows (Passer domesticus)13C-labeled leucine for 9 weeks to label endogenous proteins. We conducted weekly trials during which we measured the physiological response to water restriction as changes in lean mass, fat mass, metabolism and the enrichment of 13C in exhaled CO2 (delta 13Cbreath). If water-restricted birds catabolized proteins and oxidized the resulting amino acids, we expected to simultaneously observe greater lean mass loss and elevated delta 13Cbreath relative to control birds. We found that water-restricted birds catabolized more lean tissue and also had enriched delta 13Cbreath in response to water restriction, supporting our hypothesis. delta 13Cbreath, however, varied with metabolic rate and the length of the water restriction period, suggesting that birds may spare protein when water balance can be achieved using other physiological strategies.",2024,227,6,NA
Avian thermoregulation in the heat: evaporative cooling capacity of arid-zone Caprimulgiformes from two continents,"Talbot, William A. and McWhorter, Todd J. and Gerson, Alexander R. and McKechnie, Andrew E. and Wolf, Blair O.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.161653,"Birds in the order Caprimulgiformes (nightjars and allies) have a remarkable capacity for thermoregulation over a wide range of environmental temperatures, exhibiting pronounced heterothermy in cool conditions and extreme heat tolerance at high environmental temperatures. We measured thermoregulatory responses to acute heat stress in three species of Caprimulgiformes that nest in areas of extreme heat and aridity, the common poorwill (Phalaenoptilus nuttallii: Caprimulgidae) and lesser nighthawk (Chordeiles acutipennis: Caprimulgidae) in the Sonoran Desert of Arizona, and the Australian owlet-nightjar (Aegotheles cristatus: Aegothelidae) in the mallee woodlands of South Australia. We exposed wild-caught birds to progressively increasing air temperatures (T-a) and measured resting metabolic rate (RMR), evaporative water loss (EWL), body temperature (T-b) and heat tolerance limit (HTL; the maximum T-a reached). Comparatively low RMR values were observed in all species (0.35, 0.36 and 0.40 Wfor the poorwill, nighthawk and owlet-nightjar, respectively), with T-b approximating T-a at 40 degrees C and mild hyperthermia occurring as T-a reached the HTL. Nighthawks and poorwills reached HTLs of 60 and 62 degrees C, respectively, whereas the owlet-nightjar had a HTL of 52 degrees C. RMR increased gradually above minima at T-a of 42, 42 and 35 degrees C, and reached 1.7, 1.9 and 2.0 times minimum resting values at HTLs in the poorwill, nighthawk and owlet-nightjar, respectively. EWL increased rapidly and linearly as T-a exceeded T-b and resulted in maximum rates of evaporative heat dissipation equivalent to 237-424\% of metabolic heat production. Bouts of gular flutter resulted in large transient increases in evaporative heat loss (50-123\%) accompanied by only small increments in RMR (<5\%). The cavity-nesting/roosting owlet-nightjar had a lower HTL and less efficient evaporative cooling compared with the species that nest and/or roost on open desert surfaces. The high efficiency of gular flutter for evaporative cooling, combined with mild hyperthermia, provides the physiological basis for defending T-b well below T-a in extreme heat and is comparable to the efficient cooling observed in arid-zone columbids in which cutaneous EWL is the predominant cooling pathway.",2017,220,19,3488-3498

However, previous studies have mainly examined decapod brachyurans with marine ancestries inhabiting estuaries or tidal creeks on a seasonal basis. Here, we describe osmoregulation in the atyid Halocaridina rubra, an endemic Hawaiian shrimp of freshwater ancestry from the islands' anchialine ecosystem (coastal ponds with subsurface freshwater and seawater connections) that encounters near-continuous spatial and temporal salinity changes. Given this, survival and osmoregulatory responses were examined over a wide salinity range. In the laboratory, H. rubra tolerated salinities of similar to 0-56\%, acting as both a hyper- and hypo-osmoregulator and maintaining a maximum osmotic gradient of similar to 868 mOsm kg(-1) H2O in freshwater. Furthermore, hemolymph osmolality was more stable during salinity transfers relative to other crustaceans. Silver nitrate and vital mitochondria-rich cell staining suggest all gills are osmoregulatory, with a large proportion of each individual gill functioning in ion transport (including when H. rubra acts as an osmoconformer in seawater). Additionally, expression of ion transporters and supporting enzymes that typically undergo upregulation during salinity transfer in osmoregulatory gills (i.e. Na+/K+-ATPase, carbonic anhydrase, Na+/K+/2Cl(-) cotransporter, V-type H+-ATPase and arginine kinase) were generally unaltered in H. rubra during similar transfers. These results suggest H. rubra (and possibly other anchialine species) maintains high, constitutive levels of gene expression and ion transport capability in the gills as a means of potentially coping with the fluctuating salinities that are encountered in anchialine habitats. Thus, anchialine taxa represent an interesting avenue for future physiological research.",2014,217,13,2309-2320
Strong acclimation effect of temperature and humidity on heat tolerance of the Arctic collembolan Megaphorura arctica,"Christoffersen, Sara Norris and Pertoldi, Cino and Sorensen, Jesper Givskov and Kristensen, Torsten Nygard and Bruhn, Dan and Bahrndorff, Simon",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.247394,"The Arctic is a highly variable environment in which extreme daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations can occur. With climate change, an increase in the occurrence of extreme high temperatures and drought events is expected. While the effects of cold and dehydration stress on polar arthropods are well studied in combination, little is known about how these species respond to the combined effects of heat and dehydration stress. In this paper, we investigated how the heat tolerance of the Arctic collembola Megaphorura arctica is affected by combinations of different temperature and humidity acclimation regimes under controlled laboratory conditions. The effect of acclimation temperature was complex and highly dependent on both acclimation time and temperature, and was found to have a positive, negative or no effect depending on experimental conditions. Further, we found marked effects of the interaction between temperature and humidity on heat tolerance, with lower humidity severely decreasing heat tolerance when the acclimation temperature was increased. This effect was more pronounced with increasing acclimation time. Lastly, the effect of acclimation on heat tolerance under a fluctuating temperature regime was dependent on acclimation temperature and time, as well as humidity levels. Together, these results show that thermal acclimation alone has moderate or no effect on heat tolerance, but that drought events, likely to be more frequent in the future, in combination with high temperature stress can have large negative impacts on heat tolerance of some Arctic arthropods.",2024,227,12,NA
Thermal physiological traits and plasticity of metabolism are sensitive to biogeographic breaks in a rock-pool marine shrimp,"Barria, Aura M. and Bacigalupe, Leonardo D. and Lagos, Nelson A. and Lardies, Marco A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.181008,"Populations of broadly distributed species commonly exhibit latitudinal variation in thermal tolerance and physiological plasticity. This variation can be interrupted when biogeographic breaks occur across the range of a species, which are known to affect patterns of community structure, abundance and recruitment dynamics. Coastal biogeographic breaks often impose abrupt changes in environmental characteristics driven by oceanographic processes and can affect the physiological responses of populations inhabiting these areas. Here, we examined thermal limits, performances for heart rate and plasticity in metabolic rate of the intertidal shrimp Betaeus emarginatus from seven populations along its latitudinal range (similar to 3000 km). The distribution of this species encompass two breaks along the southeastern Pacific coast of Chile: the northern break is characterized by sharp discontinuities in upwelling regimes, and the southern break constitutes a major discontinuity in water conditions (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen and nutrients), coastline topography and divergence of main oceanographic currents. For B. emarginatus, we found higher plasticity in metabolism at the sites sampled at the biogeographic breaks, and at the site subjected to seasonal upwelling. The variation in metabolic rate was not consistent with increasing latitude and it was not affected by breaks. The lower and upper thermal limits were lower in populations around breaks, although the optimum temperature decreased towards higher latitudes. Overall, whereas thermal limits and plasticity of metabolism are related to biogeographic breaks, metabolic rate is not related to increasing latitude or the presence of breaks in the sampled range.",2018,221,19,NA
Aquatic insects in a multistress environment: cross-tolerance to salinity and desiccation,"Pallares, Susana and Botella-Cruz, Maria and Arribas, Paula and Millan, Andres and Velasco, Josefa",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.152108,"Exposing organisms to a particular stressor may enhance tolerance to a subsequent stress, when protective mechanisms against the two stressors are shared. Such cross-tolerance is a common adaptive response in dynamic multivariate environments and often indicates potential co-evolution of stress traits. Many aquatic insects in inland saline waters from Mediterranean-climate regions are sequentially challenged with salinity and desiccation stress. Thus, cross-tolerance to these physiologically similar stressors could have been positively selected in insects of these regions. We used adults of the saline water beetles Enochrus jesusarribasi (Hydrophilidae) and Nebrioporus baeticus (Dytiscidae) to test cross-tolerance responses to desiccation and salinity. In independent laboratory experiments, we evaluated the effects of (i) salinity stress on the subsequent resistance to desiccation and (ii) desiccation stress (rapid and slow dehydration) on the subsequent tolerance to salinity. Survival, water loss and haemolymph osmolality were measured. Exposure to stressful salinity improved water control under subsequent desiccation stress in both species, with a clear cross-tolerance (enhanced performance) in N. baeticus. In contrast, general negative effects on performance were found under the inverse stress sequence. The rapid and slow dehydration produced different water loss and haemolymph osmolality dynamics that were reflected in different survival patterns. Our finding of cross-tolerance to salinity and desiccation in ecologically similar species from distant lineages, together with parallel responses between salinity and thermal stress previously found in several aquatic taxa, highlights the central role of adaption to salinity and co-occurring stressors in arid inland waters, having important implications for the species' persistence under climate change.",2017,220,7,1277-1286
Facultative hyperthermia during a heatwave delays injurious dehydration of an arboreal marsupial,"Turner, James M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.219378,"Heatwaves negatively impact wildlife populations and their effects are predicted to worsen with ongoing global warming. Animal mass mortality at extremely high ambient temperature (Ta) is evidence for physiological dysfunction and, to aid conservation efforts, improving our understanding of animal responses to environmental heat is crucial. To address this, I measured the water loss, body temperature and metabolism of an Australian marsupial during a simulated heatwave. The body temperature of the common ringtail possum Pseudocheirus peregrinus increased passively by similar to 3 degrees C over a T-a of 29-39 degrees C, conveying water savings of 9.6 ml h(-1). When T-a crossed a threshold of 35-36 degrees C, possums began actively cooling by increasing evaporative water loss and thermal conductance. It is clear that facultative hyperthermia is effective up to a point, but once this point is surpassed - the frequency and duration of which are increasing with climate change - body water would rapidly deplete, placing possums in danger of injury or death from dehydration.",2020,223,5,NA

One major explanation for gas exchange pattern variation in terrestrial insects is to effect a respiratory water loss (RWL) saving. To test this, we measured the rates of CO2 and H2O release ((V) over dot(CO2) and (V) over dot(H2O), respectively) in a previously unstudied, mesic cockroach, Aptera fusca, and compared gas exchange and water loss parameters among the major gas exchange patterns (continuous, cyclic, discontinuous gas exchange) at a range of temperatures. Mean (V) over dot(CO2), (V) over dot(H2O) and (V) over dot(H2O) per unit (V) over dot(CO2) did not differ among the gas exchange patterns at all temperatures (P>0.09). There was no significant association between temperature and gas exchange pattern type (P=0.63). Percentage of RWL (relative to total water loss) was typically low (9.79 +/- 1.84\%) and did not differ significantly among gas exchange patterns at 15 degrees C (P=0.26). The method of estimation had a large impact on the percentage of RWL, and of the three techniques investigated (traditional, regression and hyperoxic switch), the traditional method generally performed best. In many respects, A. fusca has typical gas exchange for what might be expected from other insects studied to date (e.g. (V) over dot(CO2), (V) over dot(H2O), RWL and cuticular water loss). However, we found for A. fusca that (V) over dot(H2O) expressed as a function of metabolic rate was significantly higher than the expected consensus relationship for insects, suggesting it is under considerable pressure to save water. Despite this, we found no consistent evidence supporting the conclusion that transitions in pattern type yield reductions in RWL in this mesic cockroach.",2013,216,20,3844-3853
Disentangling environmental drivers of circadian metabolism in desert-adapted mice,"Colella, Jocelyn P. and Blumstein, Danielle M. and MacManes, Matthew D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.242529,"Metabolism is a complex phenotype shaped by natural environmental rhythms, as well as behavioral, morphological and physiological adaptations. Metabolism has been historically studied under constant environmental conditions, but new methods of continuous metabolic phenotyping now offer a window into organismal responses to dynamic environments, and enable identification of abiotic controls and the timing of physiological responses relative to environmental change. We used indirect calorimetry to characterize metabolic phenotypes of the desert-adapted cactus mouse (Peromyscus eremicus) in response to variable environmental conditions that mimic their native environment versus those recorded under constant warm and constant cool conditions, with a constant photoperiod and full access to resources. We found significant sexual dimorphism, with males being more prone to dehydration than females. Under circadian environmental variation. most metabolic shifts occurred prior to physical environmental change and the timing was disrupted under both constant treatments. The ratio of CO2 produced to O-2 consumed (the respiratory quotient) reached greater than 1.0 only during the light phase under diurnally variable conditions, a pattern that strongly suggests that lipogenesis contributes to the production of energy and endogenous water. Our results are consistent with historical descriptions of circadian torpor in this species (torpid by day, active by night), but reject the hypothesis that torpor is initiated by food restriction or negative water balance.",2021,224,18,NA
Temperature and acidification variability reduce physiological performance in the intertidal zone porcelain crab <i>Petrolisthes cinctipes</i>,"Paganini, Adam W. and Miller, Nathan A. and Stillman, Jonathon H.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.109801,"We show here that increased variability of temperature and pH synergistically negatively affects the energetics of intertidal zone crabs. Under future climate scenarios, coastal ecosystems are projected to have increased extremes of low tide-associated thermal stress and ocean acidification-associated low pH, the individual or interactive effects of which have yet to be determined. To characterize energetic consequences of exposure to increased variability of pH and temperature, we exposed porcelain crabs, Petrolisthes cinctipes, to conditions that simulated current and future intertidal zone thermal and pH environments. During the daily low tide, specimens were exposed to no, moderate or extreme heating, and during the daily high tide experienced no, moderate or extreme acidification. Respiration rate and cardiac thermal limits were assessed following 2.5 weeks of acclimation. Thermal variation had a larger overall effect than pH variation, though there was an interactive effect between the two environmental drivers. Under the most extreme temperature and pH combination, respiration rate decreased while heat tolerance increased, indicating a smaller overall aerobic energy budget (i.e. a reduced O-2 consumption rate) of which a larger portion is devoted to basal maintenance (i.e. greater thermal tolerance indicating induction of the cellular stress response). These results suggest the potential for negative long-term ecological consequences for intertidal ectotherms exposed to increased extremes in pH and temperature due to reduced energy for behavior and reproduction.",2014,217,22,3974-3980
Living in flowing water increases resistance to ultraviolet B radiation,"Ghanizadeh-Kazerouni, Ensiyeh and Franklin, Craig E. and Seebacher, Frank",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.151019,"Ultraviolet B radiation (UV-B) is an important environmental driver that can affect locomotor performance negatively by inducing production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Prolonged regular exercise increases antioxidant activities, which may alleviate the negative effects of UV-B-induced ROS. Animals naturally performing exercise, such as humans performing regular exercise or fish living in flowing water, may therefore be more resilient to the negative effects of UV-B. We tested this hypothesis in a fully factorial experiment, where we exposed mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) to UV-B and control (no UV-B) conditions in flowing and still water. We show that fish exposed to UV-B and kept in flowing water had increased sustained swimming performance (U-crit), increased antioxidant defences (catalase activity and glutathione concentrations) and reduced cellular damage (lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl concentrations) compared with fish in still water. There was no effect of UV-B or water flow on resting or maximal rates of oxygen consumption. Our results show that environmental water flow can alleviate the negative effects of UV-Binduced ROS by increasing defence mechanisms. The resultant reduction in ROS-induced damage may contribute to maintain locomotor performance. Hence, the benefits of regular exercise are `transferred' to improve resilience to the negative impacts of UV-B. Ecologically, the mechanistic link between responses to different habitat characteristics can determine the success of animals. These dynamics have important ecological connotations when river or stream flow changes as a result of weather patterns, climate or human modifications.",2017,220,4,582-587
Energy metabolism and regeneration are impaired by seawater acidification in the infaunal brittlestar <i>Amphiura filiformis</i>,"Hu, Marian Y. and Casties, Isabel and Stumpp, Meike and Ortega-Martinez, Olga and Dupont, Sam",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.100024,"Seawater acidification due to anthropogenic release of CO2 as well as the potential leakage of pure CO2 from sub-seabed carbon capture storage (CCS) sites may impose a serious threat to marine organisms. Although infaunal organisms can be expected to be particularly impacted by decreases in seawater pH, as a result of naturally acidified conditions in benthic habitats, information regarding physiological and behavioral responses is still scarce. Determination of P-O2 and P-CO2 gradients within burrows of the brittlestar Amphiura filiformis during environmental hypercapnia demonstrated that besides hypoxic conditions, increases of environmental P-CO2 are additive to the already high P-CO2 (up to 0.08 kPa) within the burrows. In response to up to 4 weeks exposure to pH 7.3 (0.3 kPa P-CO2) and pH 7.0 (0.6 kPa P-CO2), metabolic rates of A. filiformis were significantly reduced in pH 7.0 treatments, accompanied by increased ammonium excretion rates. Gene expression analyses demonstrated significant reductions of acid-base (NBCe and AQP9) and metabolic (G6PDH, LDH) genes. Determination of extracellular acid-base status indicated an uncompensated acidosis in CO2-treated animals, which could explain the depressed metabolic rates. Metabolic depression is associated with a retraction of filter feeding arms into sediment burrows. Regeneration of lost arm tissues following traumatic amputation is associated with significant increases in metabolic rate, and hypercapnic conditions (pH 7.0, 0.6 kPa) dramatically reduce the metabolic scope for regeneration, reflected in an 80\% reduction in regeneration rate. Thus, the present work demonstrates that elevated seawater P-CO2 significantly affects the environment and the physiology of infaunal organisms like A. filiformis.",2014,217,13,2411-2421

We used an integrative approach to assess the impact of elevated water temperature on two fishes of immediate conservation concern in a large estuary system, the threatened longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys) and endangered delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus). Abundances have reached record lows in California, USA, and these populations are at imminent risk of extirpation. California is currently impacted by a severe drought, resulting in high water temperatures, conditions that will become more common as a result of climate change. We exposed fish to environmentally relevant temperatures (14 degrees C and 20 degrees C) and used RNA sequencing to examine the transcriptome-wide responses to elevated water temperature in both species. Consistent with having a lower temperature tolerance, longfin smelt exhibited a pronounced cellular stress response, with an upregulation of heat shock proteins, after exposure to 20 degrees C that was not observed in delta smelt. We detected an increase in metabolic rate in delta smelt at 20 degrees C and increased expression of genes involved in metabolic processes and protein synthesis, patterns not observed in longfin smelt. Through examination of responses across multiple levels of biological organization, and by linking these responses to habitat distributions in the wild, we demonstrate that longfin smelt may be more susceptible than delta smelt to increases in temperatures, and they have little room to tolerate future warming in California.

Cold tolerance is linked to osmoregulatory function of the hindgut in <i>Locusta migratoria</i>,"Gerber, Lucie and Overgaard, Johannes",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.173930,"There is growing evidence that maintenance of ion and water balance determines cold tolerance in many insects. The hindgut of terrestrial insects is critical for maintaining organismal homeostasis as it regulates solute and water balance of the haemolymph. Here, we used ex vivo everted gut sacs of Locusta migratoria to examine the effects of temperature (0-30 degrees C), thermal acclimation, hypoxia, and ionic and osmotic forces on bulk water and ion (Na+, K+ and Cl-) movement across the rectal epithelium. These findings were related to simultaneous in vivo measurements of water and ion balance in locusts exposed to similar temperatures. As predicted, we observed a critical inhibition of net water and ion reabsorption at low temperature that was proportional to the in vivo loss of water and ion homeostasis. Further, cold-acclimated locusts, which are known to defend ion and water balance at low temperature, were characterised by improved reabsorptive capacity at low temperature. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that transport mechanisms in the hindgut at low temperature are essential for cold tolerance. The loss of osmoregulatory capacity at low temperature was primarily caused by reduced active transport, while rectal paracellular permeability to fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran was unchanged at 0 and 30 degrees C. During cold exposure, water reabsorption was independent of major cation gradients across the epithelia, while a reduction in mucosal Cl- availability and an increase in mucosal osmolality markedly depressed water reabsorption. These findings are discussed in the context of existing knowledge and with suggestions for future physiological studies on cold acclimation and adaptation in insects.",2018,221,5,NA

At peak lactation (day 14 of lactation), energy intake increased from 148.7 +/- 5.7. kJ day(-1) at 30 degrees C to 213.1 +/- 8.2. kJ. day(-1) at 21 degrees C and 248.7 +/- 12.3 kJ. day(-1) at 10 degrees C. DEE increased from 105.1 +/- 4.0. kJ. day(-1) at 30 degrees C to 134.7 +/- 5.6. kJ. day(-1) at 21 degrees C and 179.5 +/- 8.4. kJ. day(-1) at 10 degrees C on days 14-16 of lactation. With nearly identical mean litter sizes, lactating gerbils at 30 degrees C exported 32.0. kJ. day(-1) less energy as milk at peak lactation than those allocated to 10 or 21 degrees C, with no difference between the latter groups. On day 14 of lactation, the litter masses at 10 and 30 degrees C were 12.2 and 9.3. g lower than those at 21 degrees C, respectively. Lactating gerbils had higher thermal conductance of the fur and lower UCP-1 levels in brown adipose tissue than non-reproductive gerbils, independent of ambient temperature, suggesting that they were attempting to avoid heat stress. Thermal conductance of the fur was positively related to circulating prolactin levels. We implanted non-reproductive gerbils with mini-osmotic pumps that delivered either prolactin or saline. Prolactin did not influence thermal conductance of the fur, but did reduce physical activity and UCP-1 levels in brown adipose tissue. Transferring lactating gerbils from warm to hot conditions resulted in reduced milk production, consistent with the heat dissipation limit theory, but transferring them from warm to cold conditions did not elevate milk production, consistent with the peripheral limitation hypothesis, and placed constraints on pup growth.",2013,216,17,3358-3368

During emersion, most crustaceans experience gill collapse, impairing gas exchange. Such collapse generates a state of hypoxemia and a hypercapnia-induced respiratory acidosis, leading to hyperlactaemia and metabolic acidosis. However, how such physiological responses to emersion are modified by prior exposure to elevated CO2 and temperature combinations, indicative of future climate change scenarios, is not known. We therefore investigated key physiological responses of velvet swimming crabs, Necora puber, kept for 14 days at one of four pCO(2)/temperature treatments (400 mu atm/10 degrees C, 1000 mu atm/10 degrees C, 400 mu atm/15 degrees C or 1000 mu atm/15 degrees C) to experimental emersion and recovery. Pre-exposure to elevated pCO(2) and temperature increased pre-emersion bicarbonate ion concentrations [}HCO3-], increasing resistance to short periods of emersion (90 min). However, there was still a significant acidosis following 180 min emersion in all treatments. The recovery of extracellular acid-base via the removal of extracellular pCO(2) and lactate after emersion was significantly retarded by exposure to both elevated temperature and pCO(2). If elevated environmental pCO(2) and temperature lead to slower recovery after emersion, then some predominantly subtidal species that also inhabit the low to mid shore, such as N. puber, may have a reduced physiological capacity to retain their presence in the low intertidal zone, ultimately affecting their bathymetric range of distribution, as well as the structure and diversity of intertidal assemblages.",2014,217,14,2499-2508
<i>Arapaima gigas</i> maintains gas exchange separation in severe aquatic hypoxia but does not suffer branchial oxygen loss,"Aaskov, Magnus L. and Jensen, Rasmus J. and Skov, Peter Vilhelm and Wood, Chris M. and Wang, Tobias and Malte, Hans and Bayley, Mark",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.243672,"One of the most air-reliant obligate air-breathing fish is the South American Arapaima gigas, with substantially reduced gills impeding gas diffusion, thought to be a result of recurring aquatic hypoxia in its habitat. In normoxic water, A. gigas is reported to satisfy 70-80\% of its O-2 requirement from the air while excreting 60-90\% of its CO2 to the water. If this pattern of gas exchange were to continue in severely hypoxic water, O-2 loss at the gills would be expected. We hypothesized therefore that partitioning of CO2 would shift to the air phase in severe aquatic hypoxia, eliminating the risk of branchial O2 loss. By adapting a respirometer designed to measure aquatic <(M) over dot>(O2)/<(M) over dot>(CO2), we were able to run intermittent closed respirometry on both water and air phase for both of these gasses as well as sample water for N-waste measurements (ammonia-N, urea-N) so as to calculate metabolic fuel utilization. In contrast to our prediction, we found that partitioning of CO2 excretion changed little between normoxia and severe hypoxia (83\% versus 77\% aquatic excretion, respectively) and at the same time there was no evidence of branchial O-2 loss in hypoxia. This indicates that A. gigas can utilize distinct transfer pathways for O-2 and CO2. Routine and standard <(M)over dot>(O2), N-waste excretion and metabolic fuel utilization did not change with water oxygenation. Metabolism was fuelled mostly by protein oxidation (53\%), while carbohydrates and lipids accounted for 27\% and 20\%, respectively.",2022,225,6,NA
Water relations of an insular pit viper,"Sandfoss, Mark R. and Lillywhite, Harvey B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.204065,"Colonization of novel habitats often requires plasticity or adaptation to local conditions. There is a critical need to maintain hydration in terrestrial environments having limited water. Atypical populations of Florida cottonmouth snakes, Agkistrodon conanti, inhabit continental islands with no permanent sources of fresh water. Here, we report investigations related to how these insular snakes maintain water balance considering the mainland conspecifics are semi-aquatic and typically associate with freshwater mesic habitats. We tested three hypotheses related to water relations of insular populations of cottonmouth snakes compared with those on the mainland. (1) Voluntary drinking of fresh water in free-ranging insular snakes should reflect a relationship to recency of rainfall more strongly than in mainland snakes. (2) Insular snakes will tolerate greater dehydration before drinking than will mainland snakes. (3) Insular snakes will avoid drinking seawater more strongly than will those from the mainland. Between 2001 and 2018, we quantitatively estimated the hydration status of 337 individual cottonmouth snakes from insular populations and 30 cottonmouth snakes from mainland Florida, as judged by the tendency of wild-caught snakes to drink fresh water immediately following capture. We found that insular cottonmouth snakes had a higher incidence of dehydration than did mainland cottonmouth snakes (64\% versus 23\%), and the hydration status of the insular snakes correlated with patterns of precipitation. We also determined experimentally the dehydration threshold for drinking fresh water in insular (meants.d. -5.64 +/- 4.3\%, n=34) and mainland cottonmouth snakes (-5.74 +/- 4.5\%, n=21), and these were not significantly different. Discrimination tests for drinking serially from a graded series of brackish water showed that mainland snakes did not discriminate against the highest brackish value (10.5 ppt or 30\% seawater), whereas insular snakes showed a preference for <15\% seawater. Naive neonates from insular and mainland cohorts behaved similarly. The preference of insular snakes for fresh water represents an important aspect of the maintenance of water balance that differs from the mainland conspecifics and is likely a habituated or adaptive response to dependence on rainfall.",2019,222,9,NA
Oxygen-limited thermal tolerance is seen in a plastron-breathing insect and can be induced in a bimodal gas exchanger,"Verberk, Wilco C. E. P. and Bilton, David T.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.119560,"Thermal tolerance has been hypothesized to result from a mismatch between oxygen supply and demand. However, the generality of this hypothesis has been challenged by studies on various animal groups, including air-breathing adult insects. Recently, comparisons across taxa have suggested that differences in gas exchange mechanisms could reconcile the discrepancies found in previous studies. Here, we test this suggestion by comparing the behaviour of related insect taxa with different gas exchange mechanisms, with and without access to air. We demonstrate oxygen-limited thermal tolerance in air-breathing adults of the plastron-exchanging water bug Aphelocheirus aestivalis. Ilyocoris cimicoides, a related, bimodal gas exchanger, did not exhibit such oxygen-limited thermal tolerance and relied increasingly on aerial gas exchange with warming. Intriguingly, however, when denied access to air, oxygen-limited thermal tolerance could also be induced in this species. Patterns in oxygen-limited thermal tolerance were found to be consistent across life-history stages in these insects, with nymphs employing the same gas exchange mechanisms as adults. These results advance our understanding of oxygen limitation at high temperatures; differences in the degree of respiratory control appear to modulate the importance of oxygen in setting tolerance limits.",2015,218,13,2083-2088
Beneficial effects of a heat wave: higher growth and immune components driven by a higher food intake,"Van Dievel, Marie and Stoks, Robby and Janssens, Lizanne",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.158899,"While heat waves will become more frequent and intense under global warming, the ability of species to deal with extreme weather events is poorly understood. We investigated how a heat wave influenced growth rate and investment in two immune components (phenoloxidase activity and melanin content) in larvae of two damselfly species, Ischnura elegans and Enallagma cyathigerum. Late instar larvae were kept at 18 degrees C (i.e. their average natural water temperature) or under a simulated long heat wave at 30 degrees C. To explain the heat wave effects, we quantified traits related to energy uptake (food intake and growth efficiency), energy expenditure (metabolic rate measured as activity of the electron transport system, ETS) and investment in energy storage (fat content). The two species differed in life strategy, with I. elegans having a higher growth rate, growth efficiency, ETS activity and fat content. In line with its preference for cooler water bodies, the heat wave was only lethal for E. cyathigerum. However, both species benefited from the heat wave by increasing growth rate, which can be explained by the higher increase in food intake than metabolic rate. This may also have contributed to the increased investment in energy storage and immune components under the heat wave. This mediatory role of food intake indicates the critical role of food availability and behaviour in shaping the impact of heat waves. Our results highlight the importance of including behavioural and physiological variables to unravel and predict the impact of extreme climate events on organisms.",2017,220,21,3908-3915
Do naked mole rats accumulate a metabolic acidosis or an oxygen debt in severe hypoxia?,"Pamenter, Matthew E. and Dzal, Yvonne A. and Thompson, Illiam A. and Milsom, William K.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.191197,"In severe hypoxia, most vertebrates increase anaerobic energy production, which results in the development of a metabolic acidosis and an O-2 debt that must be repaid during reoxygenation. Naked mole rats (NMRs) are among the most hypoxia-tolerant mammals, capable of drastically reducing their metabolic rate in acute hypoxia while staying active and alert. We hypothesized that a key component of remaining active is an increased reliance on anaerobic metabolism during severe hypoxia. To test this hypothesis, we exposed NMRs to progressive reductions in inspired O-2 (9-3\% O-2) followed by reoxygenation (21\% O-2) and measured breathing frequency, heart rate, behavioural activity, body temperature, metabolic rate, and also metabolic substrates and pH in blood and tissues. We found that NMRs exhibit robust metabolic rate depression in acute hypoxia, accompanied by declines in all physiological and behavioural variables examined. However, blood and tissue pH were unchanged, and tissue concentrations of ATP and phosphocreatine were maintained. NMRs increased their reliance on carbohydrates in hypoxia, and glucose was mobilized from the liver to the blood. Upon reoxygenation, NMRs entered into a coma-like state for similar to 15-20 min, during which metabolic rate was negligible and body temperature remained suppressed. However, an imbalance in the time taken for the rates of O-2 uptake ((V)over dot(O2)) and CO2 production ((V)over dot(CO2)) to return to normoxic levels during reoxygenation hint at the possibility that NMRs do utilize anaerobic metabolism during hypoxia but have a tissue and/ or blood buffering capacity that masks typical markers of metabolic acidosis, and that the synthesis of glucose from lactate, rather than lactate oxidation, is prioritized during recovery.",2019,222,3,NA
Univariate and multivariate plasticity in response to incubation temperature in an Australian lizard,"De Jong, Madeleine J. and White, Craig R. and Wong, Bob B. M. and Chapple, David G.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.244352,"Environments, particularly developmental environments, can generate a considerable amount of phenotypic variation through phenotypic plasticity. Plasticity in response to incubation temperature is well characterised in egg-laying reptiles. However, traits do not always vary independently of one another, and studies encompassing a broad range of traits spanning multiple categories are relatively rare but crucial to better understand whole-organism responses to environmental change, particularly if covariation among traits may constrain plasticity. In this study, we investigated multivariate plasticity in response to incubation across three temperatures in the delicate skink, Lampropholis delicata, and whether this was affected by covariation among traits. At approximately 1 month of age, a suite of growth, locomotor performance, thermal physiology and behavioural traits were measured. Plasticity in the multivariate phenotype of delicate skinks was distinct for different incubation temperatures. Cool temperatures drove shifts in growth, locomotor performance and thermal physiology, while hot temperatures primarily caused changes in locomotor performance and behaviour. These differences are likely due to variation in thermal reaction norms, as there was little evidence that covariation among traits or phenotypic integration influenced plasticity, and there was no effect of incubation temperature on the direction or strength of covariation. While there were broad themes in terms of which trait categories were affected by different incubation treatments, traits appeared to be affected independently by developmental temperature. Comparing reaction norms of a greater range of traits and temperatures will enable better insight into these patterns among trait categories, as well as the impacts of environmental change.",2022,225,22,NA
"Effects of anoxia on ATP, water, ion and pH balance in an insect (<i>Locusta migratoria</i>)","Ravn, V, Mathias and Campbell, Jacob B. and Gerber, Lucie and Harrison, Jon F. and Overgaard, Johannes",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.190850,"When exposed to anoxia, insects rapidly go into a hypometabolic coma from which they can recover when exposed to normoxia again. However, prolonged anoxic bouts eventually lead to death in most insects, although some species are surprisingly tolerant. Anoxia challenges ATP, ion, pH and water homeostasis, but it is not clear how fast and to what degree each of these parameters is disrupted during anoxia, nor how quickly they recover. Further, it has not been investigated which disruptions are the primary source of the tissue damage that ultimately causes death. Here, we show, in the migratory locust (Locusta migratoria), that prolonged anoxic exposures are associated with increased recovery time, decreased survival, rapidly disrupted ATP and pH homeostasis and a slower disruption of ion ({[}K+] and {[}Na+]) and water balance. Locusts could not fully recover after 4 h of anoxia at 30 degrees C, and at this point hemolymph {[}K+] was elevated 5-fold and [}Na+] was decreased 2-fold, muscle {[}ATP] was decreased to <= 3\% of normoxic values, hemolymph pH had dropped 0.8 units from 7.3 to 6.5, and hemolymph water content was halved. These physiological changes are associated with marked tissue damage in vivo and we show that the isolated and combined effects of hyperkalemia, acidosis and anoxia can all cause muscle tissue damage in vitro to equally large degrees. When locusts were returned to normoxia after a moderate (2 h) exposure of anoxia, ATP recovered rapidly (15 min) and this was quickly followed by recovery of ion balance (30 min), while pH recovery took 2-24 h. Recovery of {[}K+] and {[}Na+] coincided with the animals exiting the comatose state, but recovery to an upright position took similar to 90 min and was not related to any of the physiological parameters examined.",2019,222,5,NA

Females were more desiccation tolerant than males, surviving for longer periods than males under all experimental conditions. In addition, younger adults were more tolerant of desiccation than older groups. Both species showed reduced water loss rate (WLR) as the primary mechanism by which they tolerate desiccation. Although A. arabiensis is often considered to be the more arid-adapted of the two species, it showed lower survival times and higher WLR than A. funestus.

Hydration and evaporative water loss of lizards change in response to temperature and humidity acclimation,"Weaver, Savannah J. and Mcintyre, Tess and van Rossum, Taylor and Telemeco, Rory S. and Taylor, Emily N.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.246459,"Testing acclimation plasticity informs our understanding of organismal physiology and applies to conservation management amidst our rapidly changing climate. Although there is a wealth of research on the plasticity of thermal and hydric physiology in response to temperature acclimation, there is a comparative gap for research on acclimation to different hydric regimes, as well as the interaction between water and temperature. We sought to fill this gap by acclimating western fence lizards (Sceloporus occidentalis) to experimental climate conditions (crossed design of hot or cool, dry or humid) for 8 days, and measuring cutaneous evaporative water loss (CEWL), plasma osmolality, hematocrit and body mass before and after acclimation. CEWL changed plastically in response to the different climates, with lizards acclimated to hot humid conditions experiencing the greatest increase in CEWL. Change in CEWL among individuals was negatively related to treatment vapor pressure deficit and positively related to treatment water vapor pressure. Plasma osmolality, hematocrit and body mass all showed greater changes in response to temperature than to humidity or vapor pressure deficit. CEWL and plasma osmolality were positively related across treatment groups before acclimation and within treatment groups after acclimation, but the two variables showed different responses to acclimation, suggesting that they are interrelated but governed by different mechanisms. This study is among few that assess more than one metric of hydric physiology and that test the interactive effects of temperature and humidity.

We observed substantial heat tolerance plasticity in a test of this theory using tropical, thermophilic marine intertidal snails that inhabit extremely hot and highly variable thermal environments. The implication of these results is that plasticity selection is largely driven by habitat temperature conditions irrespective of basal heat tolerance or latitude. However, heat tolerance of field-fresh snails was comparable with that of laboratory warm-acclimated snails, suggesting that snails in the field may often be unable to improve heat hardening with further environmental warming. These findings suggest that field referencing is crucial to using laboratory-measured acclimation capacity when inferring climate warming vulnerability in ectotherms, and overall they question how well current thermal biology theory predicts the outcomes of global change in intertidal environments.",2018,221,22,NA
Keeping your cool: thermoregulatory performance and plasticity in desert cricetid rodents,"Ramirez, Richard W. and Riddell, Eric A. and Beissinger, Steven R. and Wolf, Blair O.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.243131,"Small mammals in hot deserts often avoid heat via noctumality and fossoriality, and are thought to have a limited capacity to dissipate heat using evaporative cooling. Research to date has focused on thermoregulatory responses to air temperatures (T-a) below body temperature (T-b). Consequently, the thermoregulatory performance of small mammals exposed to high T-a is poorly understood, particularly responses across geographic and seasonal scales. We quantified the seasonal thermoregulatory performance of four cricetid rodents (Neotoma albigula, Neotoma lepida, Peromyscus eremicus, Peromyscus crinitus) exposed to high T-a, at four sites in the Mojave Desert. We measured metabolism, evaporative water loss and T-b using flow-through respirometry. When exposed to T-a >= T-b, rodents showed steep increases in T-b, copious salivation and limited evaporative heat dissipation. Most individuals were only capable of maintaining T-a -T-b gradients of similar to 1 degrees, resulting in heat tolerance limits (HTLs) in the range T-a =43-45 degrees C. All species exhibited a thermoneutral T-b of similar to 35-36 degrees C, and T-b increased to maximal levels of similar to 43 degrees C. Metabolic rates and rates of evaporative water loss increased steeply in all species as T-a approached T-b. We also observed significant increases in resting metabolism and evaporative water loss from summer to winter at T-a within and above the thermoneutral zone. In contrast, we found few differences in the thermoregulatory performance within species across sites. Our results suggest that cricetid rodents have a limited physiological capacity to cope with environmental temperatures that exceed T-b and that a rapidly warming environment may increasingly constrain their nocturnal activity.",2022,225,5,NA
The influence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on sodium regulation and nitrogenous waste excretion in the zebrafish (<i>Danio</i> <i>rerio</i>),"Al-Reasi, Hassan A. and Smith, Scott D. and Wood, Chris M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.139444,"Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is both ubiquitous and diverse in composition in natural waters, but its effects on the branchial physiology of aquatic organisms have received little attention relative to other variables (e.g. pH, hardness, salinity, alkalinity). Here, we investigated the effects of four chemically distinct DOM isolates (three natural, one commercial, ranging from autochthonous to highly allochthonous, all at similar to 6 mg C l(-1)) on the physiology of gill ionoregulation and nitrogenous waste excretion in zebrafish acclimated to either circumneutral (7.0-8.0) or acidic pH (5.0). Overall, lower pH tended to increase net branchial ammonia excretion, net K+ loss and [}H-3] PEG-4000 clearance rates (indicators of transcellular and paracellular permeability, respectively). However, unidirectional Na+ efflux, urea excretion and drinking rates were unaffected. DOM sources tended to stimulate unidirectional Na+ influx rate and exerted subtle effects on the concentration-dependent kinetics of Na+ uptake, increasing maximum transport capacity. All DOM sources reduced passive Na+ efflux rates regardless of pH, but exerted negligible effects on nitrogenous waste excretion, drinking rate, net K+ loss or {[}H-3] PEG-4000 clearance, so the mechanism of Na+ loss reduction remains unclear. Overall, these actions appear beneficial to ionoregulatory homeostasis in zebrafish, and some may be related to physicochemical properties of the DOM sources. They are very different from those seen in a recent parallel study on Daphnia magna using the same DOM isolates, indicating that DOM actions may be both species and DOM specific.",2016,219,15,2289-2299
When less means more: dehydration improves innate immunity in rattlesnakes,"Brusch, George A. and DeNardo, Dale F.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.155028,"Immune function can vary based on availability of resources, and most studies of such influences have focused on the co-investment of energy into immune and other physiological functions. When energy resources are limited, trade-offs exist, which can compromise immunity for other functions. As with energy, water limitation can also alter various physiological processes, yet water has received little consideration for its possible role in modulating immune functions. We examined the relationship between immunocompetence and hydration state using the western diamond-backed rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox). This species is known to undergo substantial seasonal fluctuations in water availability with extreme limitations during the hot-dry season. We collected blood samples from free ranging C. atrox to compare osmolality and innate immune function (lysis, agglutination and bacterial growth inhibition) during the milder and relatively moister early spring season, the hot-dry season and the hot-wet season. To isolate effects of dehydration from other possible seasonal influences, we complemented this field study with a laboratory study in which we withheld food and water from individually housed adult C. atrox for up to 16 weeks. We collected blood samples from each snake as it dehydrated and collected a final sample after the snake was given water ad libitum at the end of the experiment. Our results demonstrate that C. atrox experience significant dehydration during the hot-dry season, and that, in general, innate immune function is highly correlated with osmolality, whether natural or artificially manipulated.",2017,220,12,2287-2295
High latitude northern bats (Eptesicus nilssonii) reveal adaptations to both high and low ambient temperatures,"Soras, Rune and Fjelldal, Mari Aas and Bech, Claus and van derKooij, Jeroen and Eldegard, Katrine and Stawski, Clare",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.245260,"Insectivorous bats at northern latitudes need to cope with long periods of no food for large parts of the year. Hence, bats which are resident at northern latitudes throughout the year will need to undergo a long hibernation season and a short reproductive season where foraging time is limited by extended daylight periods. Eptesicus nilssonii is the northernmost occurring bat species worldwide and hibernates locally when ambient temperatures (Ta) limit prey availability. Therefore, we investigated the energy spent maintaining normothermy at different Ta, as well as how much bats limit energy expenditure while in torpor. We found that, despite being exposed to Ta as low as 1.1 degrees C, bats did not increase torpid metabolic rate, thus indicating that E. nilssonii can survive and hibernate at low ambient temperatures. Furthermore, we found a lower critical temperature (Tlc) of 27.8 degrees C, which is lower than in most other vespertilionid bats, and we found no indication of any metabolic response to Ta up to 37.1 degrees C. Interestingly, carbon dioxide production increased with increasing Ta above the Tlc, presumably caused by a release of retained CO2 in bats that remained in torpor for longer and aroused at Ta above the Tlc. Our results indicate that E. nilssonii can thermoconform at near-freezing Ta, and hence maintain longer torpor bouts with limited energy expenditure, yet also cope with high Ta when sun exposed in roosts during long summer days. These physiological traits are likely to enable the species to cope with ongoing and predicted climate change.",2023,226,21,NA
Physiological responses to hypoxia are constrained by environmental temperature in heterothermic tenrecs,"Devereaux, Maiah E.

Therefore, we hypothesized that tenrecs are tolerant to environmental hypoxia and hypercapnia. Many hypoxia-and hypercapnia-tolerant fossorial mammals respond to hypoxia by decreasing metabolic rate and thermogenesis, and have blunted ventilatory responses to both environmental hypoxia and hypercapnia. However, tenrecs exhibit extreme metabolic and thermoregulatory plasticity, which exceeds that of most heterothermic mammals and approaches that of ectothermic reptiles. Thus, we predicted that tenrecs would have abnormal physiological responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia relative to other fossorial mammals. To test this, we exposed common tenrecs (Tenrec ecaudatus) to moderate and severe hypoxia (9 and 4\% O2) or hypercapnia (5 and 10\% CO2) in either 28 or 16 degrees C while non-invasively measuring metabolic rate, thermogenesis and ventilation. We found that tenrecs exhibit robust metabolic decreases in both hypoxia and hypercapnia. Furthermore, tenrecs have blunted ventilatory responses to both hypoxia and hypercapnia, and these responses are highly temperature sensitive such that they are reduced or absent in 16 degrees C. Thermoregulation was highly variable in 16 degrees C but constrained in 28 degrees C across all treatment conditions and was not impacted by hypoxia or hypercapnia, unlike in other heterothermic mammals. Taken together, our results indicate that physiological responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia in tenrecs are highly dependent on environmental temperature and differ from those of other mammalian heterotherms.",2023,226,6,NA

However, the temperature at which climate heating will force cool-climate nocturnal lizards to abandon daytime retreats remains poorly understood. Here, we developed a new laboratory protocol for determining VTmax in the retreat-dwelling, viviparous Woodworthia `Otago/Southland' gecko, based on escape behaviour (abandonment of heated retreat). We compared the body temperature (T-b) at VTmax and duration of heating, between two source groups with different thermal histories, and among three reproductive groups. We also examined continuous changes in T-b (via an attached biologger) and total evaporative water loss (EWL) during heating. In the field, we measured T-b and microhabitat thermal profiles to establish whether geckos reach VTmax in nature. We found that VTmax and duration of heating varied between source groups (and thus potentially with prior thermal experience), but not among reproductive groups. Moreover, geckos reached a peak temperature slightly higher than VTmax before abandoning the retreat. Total EWL increased with increasing VTmax and with the duration of heating. In the field, pregnant geckos with attached biologgers reached VT(max )temperature, and temperatures of some separately monitored microhabitats exceeded VT(max)in hot weather implying that some retreats must be abandoned to avoid overheating. Our results suggest that cool-climate nocturnal lizards that inhabit daytime retreats may abandon retreats more frequently if climate warming persists, implying a trade-off between retention of originally occupied shelter and ongoing water loss due to overheating.",2020,223,20,NA
Intertidal oysters reach their physiological limit in a future high-CO<sub>2</sub> world,"Scanes, Elliot and Parker, Laura M. and O'Connor, Wayne A. and Stapp, Laura S. and Ross, Pauline M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.151365,"Sessile marine molluscs living in the intertidal zone experience periods of internal acidosis when exposed to air (emersion) during low tide. Relative to other marine organisms, molluscs have been identified as vulnerable to future ocean acidification; however, paradoxically it has also been shown that molluscs exposed to high CO2 environments are more resilient compared with those molluscs naive to CO2 exposure. Two competing hypotheses were tested using a novel experimental design incorporating tidal simulations to predict the future intertidal limit of oysters in a high-CO2 world; either high-shore oysters will be more tolerant of elevated PCO2 because of their regular acidosis, or elevated PCO2 will cause high-shore oysters to reach their limit. Sydney rock oysters, Saccostrea glomerata, were collected from the high-intertidal and subtidal areas of the shore and exposed in an orthogonal design to either an intertidal or a subtidal treatment at ambient or elevated PCO2, and physiological variables were measured. The combined treatment of tidal emersion and elevated PCO2 interacted synergistically to reduce the haemolymph pH (pHe) of oysters, and increase the PCO2 in the haemolymph (Pe, CO2) and standard metabolic rate. Oysters in the intertidal treatment also had lower condition and growth. Oysters showed a high degree of plasticity, and little evidence was found that intertidal oysters were more resilient than subtidal oysters. It is concluded that in a high-CO2 world the upper vertical limit of oyster distribution on the shore may be reduced. These results suggest that previous studies on intertidal organisms that lacked tidal simulations may have underestimated the effects of elevated PCO2",2017,220,5,765-774
Discontinuous gas-exchange cycle characteristics are differentially affected by hydration state and energy metabolism in gregarious and solitary desert locusts,"Talal, Stav and Ayali, Amir and Gefen, Eran",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.126490,"The termination of discontinuous gas exchange cycles (DGCs) in severely dehydrated insects casts doubt on the generality of the hygric hypothesis, which posits that DGCs evolved as a water conservation mechanism. We followed DGC characteristics in the two density-dependent phases of the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria throughout exposure to an experimental treatment of combined dehydration and starvation stress, and subsequent rehydration. We hypothesized that, under stressful conditions, the more stress-resistant gregarious locusts would maintain DGCs longer than solitary locusts. However, we found no phase-specific variations in body water content, water loss rates (total and respiratory) or timing of stress-induced abolishment of DGCs. Likewise, locusts of both phases re-employed DGCs after ingesting comparable volumes of water when rehydrated. Despite comparable water management performances, the effect of exposure to stressful experimental conditions on DGC characteristics varied significantly between gregarious and solitary locusts. Interburst duration, which is affected by the ability to buffer CO2, was significantly reduced in dehydrated solitary locusts compared with gregarious locusts. Moreover, despite similar rehydration levels, only gregarious locusts recovered their initial CO2 accumulation capacity, indicating that cycle characteristics are affected by factors other than haemolymph volume. Haemolymph protein measurements and calculated respiratory exchange ratios suggest that catabolism of haemolymph proteins may contribute to a reduced haemolymph buffering capacity, and thus a compromised ability for CO2 accumulation, in solitary locusts. Nevertheless, DGC was lost at similar hydration states in the two phases, suggesting that DGCs are terminated as a result of inadequate oxygen supply to the tissues.",2015,218,23,3807-3815

The objective of this study was to determine how increasing duration and severity of CO2 treatment influence the physiology of the thecosome Limacina retroversa, integrating both gene expression and organism-level (respiration and calcification) metrics. We exposed pteropods to over-saturated, near-saturated or under-saturated conditions and sampled individuals at 1, 3, 7, 14 and 21 days of exposure to test for the effect of duration. We found that calcification was affected by borderline and under-saturated conditions by week two, while respiration appeared to be more strongly influenced by an interaction between severity and duration of exposure, showing complex changes by one week of exposure. The organismal metrics were corroborated by specific gene expression responses, with increased expression of biomineralization-associated genes in the medium and high treatments throughout and complex changes in metabolic genes corresponding to both captivity and CO2 treatment. Genes associated with other physiological processes such as lipid metabolism, neural function and ion pumping had complex responses, influenced by both duration and severity. Beyond these responses, our findings detail the captivity effects for these pelagic organisms, providing information to contextualize the conclusions of previous studies, and emphasizing a need for better culturing protocols.",2018,221,3,NA
Intricate but tight coupling of spiracular activity and abdominal ventilation during locust discontinuous gas exchange cycles,"Talal, Stav and Gefen, Eran and Ayali, Amir",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.174722,"Discontinuous gas exchange (DGE) is the best studied among insect gas exchange patterns. DGE cycles comprise three phases, which are defined by their spiracular state: closed, flutter and open. However, spiracle status has rarely been monitored directly; rather, it is often assumed based on CO2 emission traces. In this study, we directly recorded electromyogram (EMG) signals from the closer muscle of the second thoracic spiracle and from abdominal ventilation muscles in a fully intact locust during DGE. Muscular activity was monitored simultaneously with CO2 emission, under normoxia and under various experimental oxic conditions. Our findings indicate that locust DGE does not correspond well with the commonly described three-phase cycle. We describe unique DGE-related ventilation motor patterns, coupled to spiracular activity. During the open phase, when CO2 emission rate is highest, the thoracic spiracles do not remain open; rather, they open and close rapidly. This fast spiracle activity coincides with in-phase abdominal ventilation, while alternating with the abdominal spiracle and thus facilitating a unidirectional air flow along the main trachea. A change in the frequency of rhythmic ventilation during the open phase suggests modulation by intratracheal CO2 levels. A second, slow ventilatory movement pattern probably serves to facilitate gas diffusion during spiracle closure. Two flutter-like patterns are described in association with the different types of ventilatory activity. We offer a modified mechanistic model for DGE in actively ventilating insects, incorporating ventilatory behavior and changes in spiracle state.",2018,221,6,NA
Behavioural and physiological impacts of low salinity on the sea urchin <i>Echinus esculentus</i>,"Barrett, Nicholas J. and Harper, Elizabeth M. and Last, Kim S. and Reinardy, Helena C. and Peck, Lloyd S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.246707,"Reduced seawater salinity as a result of freshwater input can exert a major influence on the ecophysiology of benthic marine invertebrates, such as echinoderms. While numerous experimental studies have explored the physiological and behavioural effects of short-term, acute exposure to low salinity in echinoids, surprisingly few have investigated the consequences of chronic exposure, or compared the two. In this study, the European sea urchin, Echinus esculentus, was exposed to low salinity over the short term (11 parts per thousand, 16 parts per thousand, 21 parts per thousand, 26 parts per thousand and 31 parts per thousand for 24 h) and longer term (21, 26 and 31 parts per thousand for 25 days). Over the short term, oxygen consumption, activity coefficient and coelomic fluid osmolality were directly correlated with reduced salinity, with 100\% survival at >= 21 parts per thousand and 0\% at <= 16 parts per thousand. Over the longer term at 21 parts per thousand (25 days), oxygen consumption was significantly higher, feeding was significantly reduced and activity coefficient values were significantly lower than at control salinity (31 parts per thousand). At 26 parts per thousand, all metrics were comparable to the control by the end of the experiment, suggesting acclimation. Furthermore, beneficial functional resistance (righting ability and metabolic capacity) to acute low salinity was observed at 26 parts per thousand. Osmolality values were slightly hyperosmotic to the external seawater at all acclimation salinities, while coelomocyte composition and concentration were unaffected by chronic low salinity. Overall, E. esculentus demonstrate phenotypic plasticity that enables acclimation to reduced salinity around 26 parts per thousand; however, 21 parts per thousand represents a lower acclimation threshold, potentially limiting its distribution in coastal areas prone to high freshwater input.",2024,227,2,NA
Temperature independence of haemoglobin-oxygen affinity in smalleye Pacific opah (<i>Lampris incognitus</i>) and swordfish (<i>Xiphias gladius</i>),"Morrison, Phillip R. and Bernal, Diego and Sepulveda, Chugey A. and Wegner, Nicholas C. and Brauner, Colin J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.243820,"Smalleye Pacific opah and swordfish can conserve metabolic heat and maintain specific body regions warmer than ambient water temperature (i.e. regional heterothermy). Consequently, blood O-2 uptake at the gills occurs at the environmental temperature at which the individual is found, but O-2 offloading will occur at different temperatures in different tissues. While several regionally heterothermic fishes (e.g. billfishes, tunas and sharks) show a reduced temperature effect on haemoglobin (Hb)-O-2 affinity, the temperature dependence of Hb-O-2 affinity in opah and swordfish is unknown. We hypothesized that the Hb of opah and swordfish would also show a reduced temperature dependence. Opah whole-blood-O-2 affinity exhibited a reverse temperature dependence above 50\% Hb-O-2 saturation (10-20 degrees C, pH 7.2-8.0), while the temperature dependence of swordfish blood-O-2 affinity (10-25 degrees C) was saturation and pH dependent, becoming temperature independent below 50\% Hb-O-2 saturation and pH 7.4. Experiments on stripped haemolysates showed that adding ATP ({[}ATP]/{[}Hb]=30) decreased the temperature sensitivity of Hb-O-2 affinity, changing the overall oxygenation enthalpy (Delta H') values of opah (10-20 degrees C) and swordfish (10-25 degrees C) Hbs at pH 7.4 from -15 and -42 kJ mol-O-1(2), respectively, to +84 and -9 kJ mol(-1) O-2. Swordfish blood-O-2 affinity was high compared with that of other large, pelagic, marine teleosts, which may be the result of unusually low ATP/Hb levels, but might also enable swordfish to forage in the potentially low-oxygenated water of the upper reaches of the oxygen minimum layer. The existence of Hbs with reduced temperature sensitivity in regionally heterothermic fishes may prevent marked changes in Hb-O-2 affinity between the cold and warm tissues.",2022,225,19,NA
Effects of mechanical disturbance and salinity stress on bioenergetics and burrowing behavior of the soft-shell clam <i>Mya arenaria</i>,"Haider, Fouzia and Sokolov, Eugene P. and Sokolova, Inna M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.172643,"Bioturbation of sediments by burrowing organisms plays a key role in the functioning of coastal ecosystems. Burrowing is considered an energetically expensive activity, yet the energy costs of burrowing and the potential impacts of multiple stressors (such as salinity stress and wave action) on bioenergetics and burrowing performance of marine bioturbators are not well understood. We investigated the effects of mechanical disturbance and salinity stress on the burrowing behavior, aerobic capacity and energy expense of digging in a common marine bioturbator, the soft-shell clam Mya arenaria from the Baltic Sea (control salinity 15). Mya arenaria showed large individual variability in the burrowing efficiency, with an average of similar to 7\% of the body energy reserves used per burial. Clams with higher mitochondrial capacity and lower energy expenditure per burial showed higher endurance. Acclimation for 3-4 weeks to low (5) or fluctuating (5-15) salinity reduced the burrowing speed and the number of times the clams can rebury but did not affect the mitochondrial capacity of the whole body or the gill. Acclimation to the fluctuating salinity shifted the predominant fuel use for burrowing from proteins to lipids. Our data indicate that the reduced burrowing performance of clams under the salinity stress is not due to the limitations of energy availability or aerobic capacity but must involve other mechanisms (such as impaired muscle performance). The reduction in the burrowing capacity of clams due to salinity stress may have important implications for survival, activity and ecological functions of the clams in shallow coastal ecosystems.",2018,221,4,NA
Physiological responses to elevated temperature across the geographic range of a terrestrial salamander,"Novarro, Alexander J. and Gabor, Caitlin R. and Goff, Cory B. and Mezebish, Tori D. and Thompson, Lily M. and Grayson, Kristine L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.178236,"Widespread species often possess physiological mechanisms for coping with thermal heterogeneity, and uncovering these mechanisms provides insight into species' responses to climate change. The emergence of non-invasive corticosterone (CORT) assays allows us to rapidly assess physiological responses to environmental change on a large scale. We lack, however, a basic understanding of how temperature affects CORT, and whether temperature and CORT interactively affect performance. Here, we examined the effects of elevated temperature on CORT and whole-organism performance in a terrestrial salamander, Plethodon cinereus, across a latitudinal gradient. Using water-borne hormone assays, we found that raising ambient temperature from 15 to 25 degrees C increased CORT release at a similar rate for salamanders from all sites. However, CORT release rates were higher overall in the warmest, southernmost site. Elevated temperatures also affected physiological performance, but the effects differed among sites. Ingestion rate increased in salamanders from the warmer sites but remained the same for those from cooler sites. Mass gain was reduced for most individuals, although this reduction was more dramatic in salamanders from the cooler sites. We also found a temperature-dependent relationship between CORT and food conversion efficiency (i.e. the amount of mass gained per unit food ingested). CORT was negatively related to food conversion efficiency at 25 degrees C but was unrelated at 15 degrees C. Thus, the energetic gains of elevated ingestion rates may be counteracted by elevated CORT release rates experienced by salamanders in warmer environments. By integrating multiple physiological metrics, we highlight the complex relationships between temperature and individual responses to warming climates.",2018,221,18,NA
Emergent properties of branching morphologies modulate the sensitivity of coral calcification to high <i>P</i><sub>CO2</sub>,"Edmunds, Peter J. and Burgess, Scott C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.217000,"Experiments with coral fragments (i.e. nubbins) have shown that net calcification is depressed by elevated P-CO2. Evaluating the implications of this finding requires scaling of results from nubbins to colonies, yet the experiments to codify this process have not been carried out. Building from our previous research demonstrating that net calcification of Pocillopora verrucosa (2-13 cm diameter) was unaffected by P-CO2 (400 and 1000 mu atm) and temperature (26.5 and 29.7 degrees C), we sought generality to this outcome by testing how colony size modulates P-CO2 and temperature sensitivity in a branching acroporid. Together, these taxa represent two of the dominant lineages of branching corals on Indo-Pacific coral reefs. Two trials conducted over 2 years tested the hypothesis that the seasonal range in seawater temperature (26.5 and 29.2 degrees C) and a future P-CO2 (1062 mu atm versus an ambient level of 461 mu atm) affect net calcification of an ecologically relevant size range (5-20 cm diameter) of colonies of Acropora hyacinthus. As for P. verrucosa, the effects of temperature and P-CO2 on net calcification (mg day(-1)) of A. verrucosa were not statistically detectable. These results support the generality of a null outcome on net calcification of exposing intact colonies of branching corals to environmental conditions contrasting seasonal variation in temperature and predicted future variation in P-CO2. While there is a need to expand beyond an experimental culture relying on coral nubbins as tractable replicates, rigorously responding to this need poses substantial ethical and logistical challenges.",2020,223,8,NA
Is warmer better? Decreased oxidative damage in notothenioid fish after long-term acclimation to multiple stressors,"Enzor, Laura A. and Place, Sean P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.108431,"Antarctic fish of the suborder Notothenioidei have evolved several unique adaptations to deal with subzero temperatures. However, these adaptations may come with physiological trade-offs, such as an increased susceptibility to oxidative damage. As such, the expected environmental perturbations brought on by global climate change have the potential to significantly increase the level of oxidative stress and cellular damage in these endemic fish. Previous single stressor studies of the notothenioids have shown they possess the capacity to acclimate to increased temperatures, but the cellular-level effects remain largely unknown. Additionally, there is little information on the ability of Antarctic fish to respond to ecologically relevant environmental changes where multiple variables change concomitantly. We have examined the potential synergistic effects that increased temperature and P-CO2 have on the level of protein damage in Trematomus bernacchii, Pagothenia borchgrevinki and Trematomus newnesi, and combined these measurements with changes in total enzymatic activity of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in order to gauge tissue-specific changes in antioxidant capacity. Our findings indicate that total SOD and CAT activity levels displayed only small changes across treatments and tissues. Short-term acclimation to decreased seawater pH and increased temperature resulted in significant increases in oxidative damage. Surprisingly, despite no significant change in antioxidant capacity, cellular damage returned to near-basal levels, and significantly decreased in T. bernacchii, after long-term acclimation. Overall, these data suggest that notothenioid fish currently maintain the antioxidant capacity necessary to offset predicted future ocean conditions, but it remains unclear whether this capacity comes with physiological trade-offs.",2014,217,18,3301-3310
Cardiorespiratory responses in an Antarctic fish suggest limited capacity for thermal acclimation,"Egginton, Stuart and Campbell, Hamish A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.130963,"Polar fishes are at high risk from increasing seawater temperatures. Characterising the physiological responses to such changes may both clarify mechanisms that permit life under extreme conditions and identify limitations in the response to continued global warming. We hypothesised that Notothenia coriiceps would show physiological compensation after an acute exposure to 5 degrees C, and following 6 weeks warm acclimation, compared with ambient temperature (0 degrees C). However, initial tachycardia (22.4 +/- 2.8 versus 12.8 +/- 1.1 min(-1); P<0.01) was not reversed by acclimation (21.0 +/- 1.9 min(-1)). Hyperventilation (45.5 +/- 3.1 versus 21.4 +/- 2.4 breaths min(-1); P<0.001) showed a modest reduction following acclimation (38.0 +/- 2.9 min(-1); P<0.05), while resting oxygen consumption (0.52 +/- 0.08 mmol kg(-1) h(-1)) was acutely increased at 5 +/- C (1.07 +/- 0.10 mmol kg(-1) h(-1); P<0.001) but unchanged with acclimation. Autonomic blockade showed initial responses were mainly of vagal origin, with little subsequent withdrawal or recovery in long-term heart rate variability after 6 weeks.

Here, we examined the thermal biology, temperature dependence and thermal plasticity of bite force (endurance and magnitude) in Diplolaemus leopardinus, an aggressive and territorial lizard endemic to Mendoza province, Argentina. Our results indicate that this lizard behaves like a moderate thermoregulator that uses the rocks of its environment as the main heat source. Bite endurance was not influenced by head morphometry and body temperature, whereas bite force was influenced by head length and jaw length, and exhibited thermal dependence. Before thermal acclimation treatments, the maximum bite force for D. leopardinus occurred at the lowest body temperature and fell sharply with increasing body temperature. After acclimation treatments, lizards acclimated at higher temperatures exhibited greater bite force. Bite force showed phenotypic plasticity, which reveals that leopard iguanas are able to maintain (and even improve) their bite force under a rising-temperature scenario.",2020,223,12,NA
"Master of all trades: thermal acclimation and adaptation of cardiac function in a broadly distributed marine invasive species, the European green crab, <i>Carcinus maenas</i>","Tepolt, Carolyn K. and Somero, George N.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.093849,"As global warming accelerates, there is increasing concern about how ecosystems may change as a result of species loss and replacement. Here, we examined the thermal physiology of the European green crab (Carcinus maenas Linnaeus 1758), a globally invasive species, along three parallel thermal gradients in its native and invasive ranges. At each site, we assessed cardiac physiology to determine heat and cold tolerance and acclimatory plasticity. We found that, overall, the species is highly tolerant of both heat and cold, and that it survives higher temperatures than co-occurring native marine crustaceans. Further, we found that both heat and cold tolerance are plastic in response to short-term acclimation (18-31 days at either 5 or 25 degrees C). Comparing patterns within ranges, we found latitudinal gradients in thermal tolerance in the native European range and in the invasive range in eastern North America. This pattern is strongest in the native range, and likely evolved there. Because of a complicated invasion history, the latitudinal pattern in the eastern North American invasive range may be due either to rapid adaptation post-invasion or to adaptive differences between the ancestral populations that founded the invasion. Overall, the broad thermal tolerance ranges of green crabs, which may facilitate invasion of novel habitats, derive from high inherent eurythermality and acclimatory plasticity and potentially adaptive differentiation among populations. The highly flexible physiology that results from these capacities may represent the hallmark of a successful invasive species, and may provide a model for success in a changing world.",2014,217,7,1129-1138
Avian thermoregulation in the heat: phylogenetic variation among avian orders in evaporative cooling capacity and heat tolerance,"Smit, Ben and Whitfield, Maxine C. and Talbot, William A. and Gerson, Alexander R. and McKechnie, Andrew E. and Wolf, Blair O.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.174870,"Little is known about the phylogenetic variation of avian evaporative cooling efficiency and heat tolerance in hot environments. We quantified thermoregulatory responses to high air temperature (T-a) in similar to 100-g representatives of three orders, namely, the African cuckoo (Cuculus gularis, Cuculiformes), lilac-breasted roller (Coracias caudatus, Coraciiformes) and Burchell's starling (Lamprotornis australis, Passeriformes). All three species initiated respiratory mechanisms to increase evaporative heat dissipation when body temperature (T-b) approached 41.5 degrees C in response to increasing Ta, with gular flutter observed in cuckoos and panting in rollers and starlings. Resting metabolic rate and evaporative water loss increased by quantitatively similar magnitudes in all three species, although maximum rates of evaporative water loss were proportionately lower in starlings. Evaporative cooling efficiency {[}defined as the ratio of evaporative heat loss (EHL) to metabolic heat production (MHP)] generally remained below 2.0 in cuckoos and starlings, but reached a maximum of similar to 3.5 in rollers. The high value for rollers reveals a very efficient evaporative cooling mechanism, and is similar to EHL/MHP maxima for similarly sized columbids which very effectively dissipate heat via cutaneous evaporation. This unexpected phylogenetic variation among the orders tested in the physiological mechanisms of heat dissipation is an important step toward determining the evolution of heat tolerance traits in desert birds.",2018,221,6,NA

Studying desert-adapted species provides a unique opportunity to investigate the survival strategies employed by organisms in some of the harshest habitats on Earth. Two of the primary challenges faced in desert environments are maintaining water balance and thermoregulation. We collected data in a simulated desert environment and a captive colony of cactus mice (Peromyscus eremicus) and used lab-based experiments with real time physiological measurements; energy expenditure, water loss rate and respiratory exchange rate, to characterize the response to water deprivation. Mice without access to water had significantly lower energy expenditures and in turn, reduced water loss compared to mice with access to water after the first 24 h of the experiment. Additionally, we observed significant mass loss that is probably due to dehydration-associated anorexia a response to limit fluid loss by reducing waste and the solute load as well as allowing water reabsorption from the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract. Finally, we observed body temperature correlated with sex, with males without access to water maintaining body temperature when compared with hydrated males, whereas body temperature decreased for females without access to water, suggesting daily metabolic depression in females.",2023,226,23,NA
Temperature-dependent metabolic consequences of food deprivation in the European sardine,"Thoral, Elisa and Roussel, Damien and Gasset, Eric and Dutto, Gilbert and Queiros, Quentin and McKenzie, David J. and Bourdeix, Jean-Herve and Metral, Luisa and Saraux, Claire and Teulier, Loic",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.244984,"Aquatic ecosystems can exhibit seasonal variation in resource availability and animals have evolved to cope with the associated caloric restriction. During winter in the NW Mediterranean Sea, the European sardine Sardina pilchardus naturally experiences caloric restriction owing to a decrease in the diversity and quantity of plankton. However, ongoing global warming has had deleterious effects on plankton communities such that food shortages may occur throughout the year, especially under warm conditions in the summer. We investigated the interactive effects of temperature and food availability on sardine metabolism by continuously monitoring whole-animal respiration of groups of control (fed) and food-deprived sardines over a 60-day experiment in winter (12 degrees C) or summer (20 degrees C) conditions under natural photoperiod. In addition, we measured mitochondrial respiration of red muscle fibres, biometric variables and energy reserves of individuals sampled at 30 and 60days. This revealed that winter food deprivation elicits energy saving mechanisms at whole animal and cellular levels by maintaining a low metabolism to preserve energy reserves, allowing high levels of survival. By contrast, despite energy saving mechanisms at the mitochondrial level, whole animal metabolic rate was high during food deprivation in summer, causing increased consumption of energy reserves at the muscular level and high mortality after 60days. Furthermore, a 5-day re-feeding did not improve survival, and mortalities continued, suggesting that long-term food deprivation at high temperatures causes profound stress in sardines that potentially impairs nutrient absorption.",2023,226,2,NA

Results from single-species studies are equivocal in their support of the classic `hygric hypothesis' for the evolution of DGC, whereas comparative analyses generally support a link between DGC and water balance. In this study, we investigated DGC prevalence and characteristics and RWL in three grasshopper species (Acrididae, subfamily Pamphaginae) across an aridity gradient in Israel. In order to determine whether DGC contributes to a reduction in RWL, we compared the DGC characteristics and RWL associated with CO2 release (transpiration ratio, i.e. the molar ratio of RWL to CO2 emission rates) among these species. Transpiration ratios of DGC and continuous breathers were also compared intraspecifically. Our data show that DGC characteristics, DGC prevalence and the transpiration ratios correlate well with habitat aridity. The xericadapted Tmethis pulchripennis exhibited a significantly shorter burst period and lower transpiration ratio compared with the other two mesic species, Ocneropsis bethlemita and Ocneropsis lividipes. However, DGC resulted in significant water savings compared with continuous exchange in T. pulchripennis only. These unique DGC characteristics for T. pulchripennis were correlated with its significantly higher mass-specific tracheal volume. Our data suggest that the origin of DGC may not be adaptive, but rather that evolved modulation of cycle characteristics confers a fitness advantage under stressful conditions. This modulation may result from morphological and/or physiological modifications.",2015,218,16,2510-2517

Rhodnius prolixus is the most important haematophagous vector of Chagas disease in the north of South America and a model organism in insect physiology. Although there have been some studies on patterns of gas exchange and metabolic rates, there is little information regarding water loss in R. prolixus. We investigated whether there is any modulation of water loss and metabolic rate under different requirements for saving water. We measured simultaneously CO2 production, water emission and activity in individual insects in real time by open-flow respirometry at different temperatures (15, 25 and 35 degrees C) and post-feeding days (0, 5, 13 and 29). We found: (1) a clear drop in metabolic rate between 5 and 13 days after feeding that cannot be explained by activity and (2) a decrease in water loss rate with increasing starvation level, by a decrease in cuticular water loss during the first 5 days after feeding and a drop in the respiratory component thereafter. We calculated the surface area of the insects and estimated cuticular permeability. In addition, we analysed the pattern of gas exchange; the change from a cyclic to a continuous pattern was affected by temperature and activity, but it was not affected by the level of starvation. Modulation of metabolic and water loss rates with temperature and starvation could help R. prolixus to be more flexible in tolerating different periods of starvation, which is adaptive in a changing environment with the uncertainty of finding a suitable host.",2014,217,24,4414-4422

We thus non-invasively measured these variables from wild-caught star-nosed moles exposed to normoxia (21\% O-2) or acute graded hypoxia (21-6\% O-2). Surprisingly, star-nosed moles did not exhibit a blunted HVR or decreased Tb in hypoxia, and only manifested a significant, albeit small (<8\%), depression of metabolic rate at 6\% O-2 relative to normoxic controls. Unlike small rodents inhabiting similar niches, star-nosed moles are thus intolerant to hypoxia, which may reflect an evolutionary trade-off favouring the extreme sensory biology of this unusual insectivore.",2021,224,19,NA

For such organisms, hydric state may influence foraging decisions, since meal consumption is meeting both energy and water demands. To understand foraging decisions it is vital to understand the role of dietary water in maintaining water balance. We investigated whether meal consumption was sufficient to maintain water balance in captive Gila monsters (Heloderma suspectum) at varying levels of dehydration. Gila monsters could not maintain water balance over long time scales through meal consumption alone. Animals fed a single meal took no longer to dehydrate than controls when both groups were deprived of free water. Additionally, meal consumption imparts an acute short-term hydric cost regardless of hydration state. Meal consumption typically resulted in a significant elevation in osmolality at 6 h post-feeding, and plasma osmolality never fell below pre-feeding levels despite high water content (similar to 70\%) of meals. These results failed to support our hypothesis that dietary water is valuable to Gila monsters during seasonal drought. When considered in conjunction with previous research, these results demonstrate that Gila monsters, unlike many xeric species, are heavily reliant on seasonal rainfall and the resulting free-standing water to maintain water balance.",2013,216,8,1439-1447

At air temperatures (T-a) exceeding body temperature (T-b), all five species showed increases in Tb to maximum values around 44-45 degrees C, accompanied by rapid increases in resting metabolic rate above clearly defined upper critical limits of thermoneutrality and increases in evaporative water loss (EWL) to levels equivalent to 670-860\% of baseline rates at thermoneutral T-a. Maximum cooling capacity, quantified as the fraction of metabolic heat production dissipated evaporatively, ranged from 1.20 to 2.17, consistent with the known range for passerines, and well below the corresponding ranges for columbids and caprimulgids. Heat tolerance limit (HTL, the maximum T-a tolerated) scaled positively with body mass, varying from 46 degrees C in yellow-plumed honeyeaters to 52 degrees C in a single apostlebird, but was lower than that of three southern African ploceid passerines investigated previously. We argue this difference is functionally linked to a smaller scope for increases in EWL above baseline levels. Our data reiterate the reliance of passerines in general on respiratory evaporative heat loss via panting, but also reveal substantial within-order variation in heat tolerance and evaporative cooling capacity.",2017,220,13,2436-2444

To do this, we exposed birds to an increasing profile of air temperatures (T-a) and measured resting metabolic rate (RMR), evaporative water loss (EWL), evaporative cooling efficiency (the ratio between evaporative heat loss and metabolic heat production) and body temperature (T-b). HTL ranged between 40 and 46 degrees C across species, and all species showed rapid increases in RMR, EWL and T-b in response to increasing T-a. However, only the crested lark (Galerida cristata) achieved an evaporative cooling efficiency greater than 1. The studied songbirds currently experience summer T-a maxima that surpass the upper critical temperatures of their thermoneutral zone and even their HTL. Our estimates indicate that five of the eight species will experience moderate risk of lethal dehydration by the end of the century. We argue that the limited heat tolerance and evaporative cooling efficiency of small-sized Mediterranean songbirds make them particularly vulnerable to heatwaves, which will be exacerbated under future climate change scenarios.",2022,225,23,NA
Climate influences thermal balance and water use in African and Asian elephants: physiology can predict drivers of elephant distribution,"Dunkin, Robin C. and Wilson, Dinah and Way, Nicolas and Johnson, Kari and Williams, Terrie M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.080218,"Elephant movement patterns in relation to surface water demonstrate that they are a water-dependent species. Thus, there has been interest in using surface water management to mitigate problems associated with localized elephant overabundance. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying the elephant's water dependence remain unclear. Although thermoregulation is likely an important driver, the relationship between thermoregulation, water use and climate has not been quantified. We measured skin surface temperature of and cutaneous water loss from 13 elephants (seven African, 3768 +/- 642 kg; six Asian, 3834 +/- 498 kg) and determined the contribution of evaporative cooling to their thermal and water budgets across a range of air temperatures (8-33 degrees C). We also measured respiratory evaporative water loss and resting metabolic heat production on a subset of elephants (N=7). The rate of cutaneous evaporative water loss ranged between 0.31 and 8.9 g min(-1) m(-2) for Asian elephants and 0.26 and 6.5 g min(-1) m(-2) for African elephants. Simulated thermal and water budgets using climate data from Port Elizabeth, South Africa, and Okaukuejo, Namibia, suggested that the 24-h evaporative cooling water debt incurred in warm climates can be more than 4.5 times that incurred in mesic climates. This study confirms elephants are obligate evaporative coolers but suggests that classification of elephants as water dependent is insufficient given the importance of climate in determining the magnitude of this dependence. These data highlight the potential for a physiological modeling approach to predicting the utility of surface water management for specific populations.",2013,216,15,2939-2952
Life stages differ in plasticity to temperature fluctuations and uniquely contribute to adult phenotype in <i>Onthophagus taurus</i> dung beetles,"Carter, Amanda W. and Sheldon, Kimberly S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.227884,"Adaptive thermal plasticity allows organisms to adjust their physiology to cope with fluctuating environments. However, thermal plasticity is rarely studied in response to thermal variability and is often measured in a single life stage. Plasticity in response to thermal variability likely differs from responses to constant temperature or acute stress. In addition, life stages likely differ in their plasticity, and responses in one stage may be affected by the experiences in a previous stage. Increasing the resolution with which we understand thermal plasticity in response to thermal variation across ontogeny is crucial to understanding how organisms cope with the thermal variation in their environment and to estimating the capacity of plasticity to mitigate costs of rapid environmental change. We wanted to know whether life stages differ in their capacity for thermal plasticity under temperature fluctuations. We reared Onthophagus taurus dung beetles in either low or high temperature fluctuation treatments and quantified thermal plasticity of metabolism of pupae and adults. We found that adults were thermally plastic and pupae were not. Next, we tested whether the plasticity observed in the adult life stage was affected by the thermal conditions during development. We again used low and high temperature fluctuation treatments and reared individuals in one condition through all egg to pupal stages. At eclosion, we switched half of the individuals in each treatment to the opposite fluctuation condition and, later, measured thermal plasticity of metabolism in adults. We found that temperature conditions experienced during the adult stage, but not egg to pupal stages, affect adult thermal plasticity. However, temperature fluctuations during development affect adult body size, suggesting that some aspects of the adult phenotype are decoupled from previous life stages and others are not. Our data demonstrate that life stages mount different responses to temperature variability and uniquely contribute to the adult phenotype. These findings emphasize the need to broadly integrate the life cycle into studies of phenotypic plasticity and physiology; doing so should enhance our ability to predict organismal responses to rapid global change and inform conservation efforts.",2020,223,20,NA
Thermal strategies of king penguins during prolonged fasting in water,"Lewden, Agnes and Enstipp, Manfred R. and Bonnet, Batsheva and Bost, Caroline and Georges, Jean-Yves and Handrich, Yves",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.168807,"Most animals experience periods of unfavourable conditions, challenging their daily energy balance. During breeding, king penguins fast voluntarily for up to 1.5 months in the colony, after which they replenish their energy stores at sea. However, at sea, birds might encounter periods of low foraging profitability, forcing them to draw from previously stored energy (e.g. subcutaneous fat). Accessing peripheral fat stores requires perfusion, increasing heat loss and thermoregulatory costs. Hence, how these birds balance the conflicting demands of nutritional needs and thermoregulation is unclear. We investigated the physiological responses of king penguins to fasting in cold water by: (1) monitoring tissue temperatures, as a proxy of tissue perfusion, at four distinct sites (deep and peripheral); and (2) recording their oxygen consumption rate while birds floated inside a water tank. Despite frequent oscillations, temperatures of all tissues often reached near-normothermic levels, indicating that birds maintained perfusion to peripheral tissues throughout their fasting period in water. The oxygen consumption rate of birds increased with fasting duration in water, while it was also higher when the flank tissue was warmer, indicating greater perfusion. Hence, fasting king penguins in water maintained peripheral perfusion, despite the associated greater heat loss and, therefore, thermoregulatory costs, probably to access subcutaneous fat stores. Hence, the observed normothermia in peripheral tissues of king penguins at sea, upon completion of a foraging bout, is likely explained by their nutritional needs: depositing free fatty acids (FFA) in subcutaneous tissues after profitable foraging or mobilizing FFA to fuel metabolism when foraging success was insufficient.",2017,220,24,4600-4611
Two stressors are worse than one: combined heatwave and drought affect hydration state and glucocorticoid levels in a temperate ectotherm,"Dezetter, Mathias and Le Galliard, Jean-Francois and Leroux-Coyau, Mathieu and Brischoux, Francois and Angelier, Frederic and Lourdais, Olivier",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.243777,"Heatwaves and droughts are becoming more intense and frequent with climate change. These extreme weather events often occur simultaneously and may alter organismal physiology, yet their combined impacts remain largely unknown. Here, we experimentally investigated physiological responses of a temperate ectotherm, the asp viper (Opera aspis), to a simulated heatwave and drought. We applied a two-by-two factorial design by manipulating the daily temperature cycle (control versus heatwave) and the water availability (water available versus water deprived) over a month followed by exposure to standard thermal conditions with ad libitum access to water. Simulated heatwave and water deprivation additively increased mass loss, while water deprivation led to greater plasma osmolality (dehydration). Mass gain from drinking after the treatment period was higher in vipers from the heatwave and water-deprived group, suggesting that thirst was synergistically influenced by thermal and water constraints. Heatwave conditions and water deprivation also additively increased baseline corticosterone levels but did not influence basal metabolic rate and plasma markers of oxidative stress. Our results demonstrate that a short-term exposure to combined heatwave and drought can exacerbate physiological stress through additive effects, and interactively impact behavioral responses to dehydration. Considering combined effects of temperature and water availability is thus crucial to assess organismal responses to climate change.",2022,225,7,NA
Exposure to artificial wind increases energy intake and reproductive performance of female Swiss mice (<i>Mus musculus</i>) in hot temperatures,"Deng, Guang-Min and Yu, Jing-Xin and Xu, Jia-Qi and Bao, Yu-Fan and Chen, Qian and Cao, Jing and Zhao, Zhi-Jun",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.231415,"High temperatures and heatwaves are rapidly emerging as an important threat to many aspects of physiology and behavior in females during lactation. The body's capacity to dissipate heat is reduced by high ambient temperatures, increasing the risk of hyperthermia. Exposure to wind, a pervasive environmental factor for most terrestrial animals, is known to increase heat loss, but its effects on the reproductive performance of small mammals remains unclear. In the present study, the effects of wind on the energy budgets, resting metabolic rate and milk energy output (MEO) were measured in lactating Swiss mice at 21 and 32.5 degrees C. Females kept at 32.5 degrees C had a significantly lower resting metabolic rate, food intake and MEO, and lighter offspring, than those kept at 21 degrees C. However, exposure to wind increased the asymptotic food intake of females kept at 32.5 degrees C by 22.5\% (P<0.01), their MEO by 20.7\% (P<0.05) and their litter mass by 17.6\% (P<0.05). The body temperature of females kept at 32.5 degrees C was significantly higher during lactation than that of females kept at 21 degrees C, but this difference was reduced by exposure to wind. These findings suggest that exposure to wind considerably improves reproductive performance, increasing the fitness of small mammals while undergoing hot temperatures during heatwaves.",2020,223,17,NA
Warmer and more acidic conditions enhance performance of an endemic low-shore gastropod,"Martin, Nicole and Robinson, Tamara B. and Clusella-Trullas, Susana",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.245423,"Changing ocean temperatures are predicted to challenge marine organisms, especially when combined with other factors, such as ocean acidification. Acclimation, as a form of phenotypic plasticity, can moderate the consequences of changing environments for biota. Our understanding of how altered temperature and acidification together influence species' acclimation responses is, however, limited compared with that of responses to single stressors. This study investigated how temperature and acidification affect the thermal tolerance and righting speed of the girdled dogwhelk, Trochia cingulata. Whelks were acclimated for 2 weeks to combinations of three temperatures (11 \& DEG;C: cold, 13 \& DEG;C: moderate and 15 \& DEG;C: warm) and two pH regimes (8.0: moderate and 7.5: acidic). We measured the temperature sensitivity of the righting response by generating thermal performance curves from individual data collected at seven test temperatures and determined critical thermal minima (CTmin) and maxima (CTmax). We found that T. cingulata has a broad basal thermal tolerance range (-38 \& DEG;C) and after acclimation to the warm temperature regime, both the optimal temperature for maximum righting speed and CTmax increased. Contrary to predictions, acidification did not narrow this population's thermal tolerance but increased CTmax. These plastic responses are likely driven by the predictable exposure to temperature extremes measured in the field which originate from the local tidal cycle and the periodic acidification associated with ocean upwelling in the region. This acclimation ability suggests that T. cingulata has at least some capacity to buffer the thermal changes and increased acidification predicted to occur with climate change.",2023,226,11,NA
Hyperoxia increases maximum oxygen consumption and aerobic scope of intertidal fish facing acutely high temperatures,"McArley, Tristan J. and Hickey, Anthony J. R. and Herbert, Neill A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.189993,"Daytime low tides that lead to high-temperature events in stranded rock pools often co-occur with algae-mediated hyperoxia as a result of strong solar radiation. Recent evidence shows aerobic metabolic scope (MS) can be expanded under hyperoxia in fish but so far this possibility has not been examined in intertidal species despite being an ecologically relevant scenario. Furthermore, it is unknown whether hyperoxia increases the upper thermal tolerance limits of intertidal fish and, therefore, their ability to withstand extreme high-temperature events. Therefore, we measured the metabolic response (massspecific rate of oxygen consumption, (M) over dot(O2)) to thermal ramping (21-29 degrees C) and the upper thermal tolerance limit (U-TL) of two intertidal triplefin fishes (Bellapiscis medius and Forsterygion lapillum) under hyperoxia and normoxia. Hyperoxia increased maximal oxygen consumption ((M) over dot(O2,max)) and MS of each species at ambient temperature (21 degrees C) but also after thermal ramping to elevated temperatures such as those observed in rock pools (29 degrees C). While hyperoxia did not provide a biologically meaningful increase in upper thermal tolerance of either species (>31 degrees C under all conditions), the observed expansion of MS at 29 degrees C under hyperoxia could potentially benefit the aerobic performance, and hence the growth and feeding potential, etc., of intertidal fish at non-critical temperatures. That hyperoxia does not increase upper thermal tolerance in a meaningful way is cause for concern as climate change is expected to drive more extreme rock pool temperatures in the future and this could present a major challenge for these species.",2018,221,22,NA
Sex-specific transgenerational plasticity: developmental temperatures of mothers and fathers have different effects on sons and daughters,"Seebacher, Frank and Bamford, Stephanie M. and Le Roy, Amelie",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.245798,"Each parent can influence offspring phenotype via provisioning of the zygote or sex-specific DNA methylation. Transgenerational plasticity may therefore depend on the environmental conditions experienced by each parent. We tested this hypothesis by conducting a fully factorial experiment across three generations of guppies (Poecilia reticulata), determining the effects of warm (28 \& DEG;C) and cold (21 \& DEG;C) thermal backgrounds of mothers and fathers on mass and length, and thermal performance (sustained and sprint swimming speeds, citrate synthase and lactate dehydrogenase activities; 18, 24, 28, 32 and 36 \& DEG;C test temperatures) of sons and daughters. Offspring sex was significant for all traits except for sprint speed. Warmer mothers produced sons and daughters with reduced mass and length, and warmer fathers produced shorter sons. Sustained swimming speed (Ucrit) of male offspring was greatest when both parents were raised at 28 \& DEG;C, and warmer fathers produced daughters with greater Ucrit. Similarly, warmer fathers produced sons and daughters with greater metabolic capacity. We show that the thermal variation experienced by parents can modify offspring phenotype, and that predicting the impacts of environmental change on populations would require knowledge of the thermal background of each mother and father, particularly where sexes are spatially segregated.",2023,226,12,NA
Heat dissipation capacity influences reproductive performance in an aerial insectivore,"Tapper, Simon and Nocera, Joseph J. and Burness, Gary",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.222232,"Climatic warming is predicted to increase the frequency of extreme weather events, which may reduce an individual's capacity for sustained activity because of thermal limits. We tested whether the risk of overheating may limit parental provisioning of an aerial insectivorous bird in population decline. For many seasonally breeding birds, parents are thought to operate close to an energetic ceiling during the 2-3 week chick-rearing period. The factors determining the ceiling remain unknown, although it may be set by an individual's capacity to dissipate body heat (the heat dissipation limitation hypothesis). Over two breeding seasons we experimentally trimmed the ventral feathers of female tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) to provide a thermal window. We then monitored maternal and paternal provisioning rates, nestling growth rates and fledging success. We found the effect of our experimental treatment was context dependent. Females with an enhanced capacity to dissipate heat fed their nestlings at higher rates than controls when conditions were hot, but the reverse was true under cool conditions. Control females and their mates both reduced foraging under hot conditions. In contrast, male partners of trimmed females maintained a constant feeding rate across temperatures, suggesting attempts to match the feeding rate of their partners. On average, nestlings of trimmed females were heavier than controls, but did not have a higher probability of fledging. We suggest that removal of a thermal constraint allowed females to increase provisioning rates, but additionally provided nestlings with a thermal advantage via increased heat transfer during maternal brooding. Our data provide support for the heat dissipation limitation hypothesis and suggest that depending on temperature, heat dissipation capacity can influence reproductive success in aerial insectivores.",2020,223,10,NA

We measured thorax temperature, rates of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production, and abdominal pumping rates of bees randomly exposed to oxygen levels of 20, 15, 10 and 5 kPa at 26 degrees C. Under normoxia, bumblebees maintained an elevated mean thorax temperature of 35.5 degrees C. There was no significant change in thorax temperature at 15 kPa O-2 (33.4 degrees C). Mean thorax temperature decreased significantly at 10 kPa O-2 (31.6 degrees C) and 5 kPa O-2 (27.3 degrees C). Bees were able to maintain an elevated metabolic rate at 15 and 10 kPa O-2. In normoxia, endothermic bees exhibited periods of rapid abdominal pumping (327 min(-1)) interspaced by periods of no abdominal pumping. At 10 kPa O-2, abdominal pumping rate decreased (255 min(-1)) but became more continuous. Upon exposure to 5 kPa, metabolic rate and abdominal pumping rate (152 min(-1)) decreased, although the animals continued abdominal pumping at the reduced rate throughout the exposure period. Bumblebees are able to meet the energetic demands of endothermy at 15 kPa O-2, but become compromised at levels of 10 kPa O-2 and below.",2014,217,21,3834-3842
Limited heat tolerance in a cold-adapted seabird: implications of a warming Arctic,"Choy, Emily S. and O'Connor, Ryan S. and Gilchrist, H.

However, few studies have examined the direct effects of warming temperatures on Arctic wildlife, leaving the importance of heat stress unclear. Here, we assessed the direct effects of increasing air temperatures on the physiology of thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia), an Arctic seabird with reported mortalities due to heat stress while nesting on sun-exposed cliffs. We used flow-through respirometry to measure the response of body temperature, resting metabolic rate, evaporative water loss and evaporative cooling efficiency (the ratio of evaporative heat loss to metabolic heat production) in murres while experimentally increasing air temperature. Murres had limited heat tolerance, exhibiting: (1) a low maximum body temperature (43.3 degrees C); (2) a moderate increase in resting metabolic rate relative that within their thermoneutral zone (1.57 times); (3) a small increase in evaporative water loss rate relative that within their thermoneutral zone (1.26 times); and (4) a low maximum evaporative cooling efficiency (0.33). Moreover, evaporative cooling efficiency decreased with increasing air temperature, suggesting murres were producing heat at a faster rate than they were dissipating it. Larger murres also had a higher rate of increase in resting metabolic rate and a lower rate of increase in evaporative water loss than smaller murres; therefore, evaporative cooling efficiency declined with increasing body mass. As a cold-adapted bird, murres' limited heat tolerance likely explains their mortality on warm days. Direct effects of overheating on Arctic wildlife may be an important but under-reported impact of climate change.",2021,224,13,NA
When it's hot and dry: life-history strategy influences the effects of heat waves and water limitation,"Padda, Sugjit S. and Glass, Jordan R. and Stahlschmidt, Zachary R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.236398,"The frequency, duration and co-occurrence of several environmental stressors, such as heat waves and droughts, are increasing globally. Such multiple stressors may have compounding or interactive effects on animals, resulting in either additive or non-additive costs, but animals may mitigate these costs through various strategies of resource conservation or shifts in resource allocation. Through a factorial experiment, we investigated the independent and interactive effects of a simulated heat wave and water limitation on life-history, physiological and behavioral traits. We used the variable field cricket, Gryllus lineaticeps, which exhibits a wing dimorphism that mediates two distinct life-history strategies during early adulthood. Long-winged individuals invest in flight musculature and are typically flight capable, whereas short-winged individuals lack flight musculature and capacity. A comprehensive and integrative approach with G. lineaticeps allowed us to examine whether life-history strategy influenced the costs of multiple stressors as well as the resulting cost-limiting strategies. Concurrent heat wave and water limitation resulted in largely non-additive and single-stressor costs to important traits (e.g. survival and water balance), extensive shifts in resource allocation priorities (e.g. reduced prioritization of body mass) and a limited capacity to conserve resources (e.g. heat wave reduced energy use only when water was available). Life-history strategy influenced the emergency life-history stage because wing morphology and stressor(s) interacted to influence body mass, boldness behavior and immunocompetence. Our results demonstrate that water availability and life-history strategy should be incorporated into future studies integrating important conceptual frameworks of stress across a suite of traits - from survival and life history to behavior and physiology.",2021,224,7,NA
Body temperature stability achieved by the large body mass of sea turtles,"Sato, Katsufumi",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.109470,"To investigate the thermal characteristics of large reptiles living in water, temperature data were continuously recorded from 16 free-ranging loggerhead turtles, Caretta caretta, during internesting periods using data loggers. Core body temperatures were 0.7-1.7 degrees C higher than ambient water temperatures and were kept relatively constant. Unsteady numerical simulations using a spherical thermodynamic model provided mechanistic explanations for these phenomena, and the body temperature responses to fluctuating water temperature can be simply explained by a large body mass with a constant thermal diffusivity and a heat production rate rather than physiological thermoregulation. By contrast, body temperatures increased 2.6-5.1 degrees C in 107-152 min during their emergences to nest on land. The estimated heat production rates on land were 7.4-10.5 times the calculated values in the sea. The theoretical prediction that temperature difference between body and water temperatures would increase according to the body size was confirmed by empirical data recorded from several species of sea turtles. Comparing previously reported data, the internesting intervals of leatherback, green and loggerhead turtles were shorter when the body temperatures were higher. Sea turtles seem to benefit from a passive thermoregulatory strategy, which depends primarily on the physical attributes of their large body masses.",2014,217,20,3607-3614
Thermoregulatory trade-offs underlie the effects of warming summer temperatures on deer mice,"Flewwelling, Luke D. and Wearing, Oliver H. and Garrett, Emily J. and Scott, Graham R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.244852,"Climate warming could challenge the ability of endotherms to thermoregulate and maintain normal body temperature (Tb), but the effects of warming summer temperatures on activity and thermoregulatory physiology in many small mammals remain poorly understood. We examined this issue in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), an active nocturnal species. Mice were exposed in the lab to simulated seasonal warming, in which an environmentally realistic diel cycle of ambient temperature (Ta) was gradually warmed from spring conditions to summer conditions (controls were maintained in spring conditions). Activity (voluntary wheel running) and Tb (implanted bio-loggers) were measured throughout, and indices of thermoregulatory physiology (thermoneutral zone, thermogenic capacity) were assessed after exposure. In control mice, activity was almost entirely restricted to the night-time, and Tb fluctuated-1.7 degrees C between daytime lows and night-time highs. Activity, body mass and food consumption were reduced and water consumption was increased in later stages of summer warming. This was accompanied by strong Tb dysregulation that culminated in a complete reversal of the diel pattern of Tb variation, with Tb reaching extreme highs (-40 degrees C) during daytime heat but extreme lows (-34 degrees C) at cooler night-time temperatures. Summer warming was also associated with reduced ability to generate body heat, as reflected by decreased thermogenic capacity and decreased mass and uncoupling protein (UCP1) content of brown adipose tissue. Our findings suggest that thermoregulatory trade-offs associated with daytime heat exposure can affect Tb and activity at cooler night-time temperatures, impacting the ability of nocturnal mammals to perform behaviours important for fitness in the wild.",2023,226,5,NA
Desiccation resistance reflects patterns of microhabitat choice in a Central American assemblage of wandering spiders,"Lapinski, Witold and Tschapka, Marco",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.102533,"The lowland rainforest of northeastern Costa Rica harbours an assemblage of large wandering spider species belonging to three habitat subguilds: (1) semi-aquatic, (2) forest ground dwelling and (3) vegetation dwelling. We hypothesized that desiccation resistance should differ among species preferring different microhabitats and the associated microclimate. Desiccation resistance was assessed by: (1) measuring water loss rates of the spiders under relatively dry experimental conditions, and (2) recording desiccation susceptibility, i.e. the reactions of the spiders to a relatively dry environment. High water loss rates and desiccation susceptibility of the semi-aquatic and forest-ground-dwelling subguilds clearly mirrored the relatively humid microclimate of the understory. Significantly lower water loss rates and desiccation susceptibility of the vegetation-dwelling species reflected the highly variable, often dry and hot conditions of the rainforest canopy and forest edge habitats. Vegetation-dwelling wandering spiders are therefore physiologically better adapted to dry conditions than the semi-aquatic and forest-ground-dwelling species. The results illustrate the significance of physiological characteristics for explaining both species-specific habitat use and, in a larger context, niche partitioning within a community.",2014,217,15,2789-2795

However, some previous experiments supporting this concept have confounded the impact of temperature on the mothers with the impact on the pups. We aimed to separate these effects in lactating laboratory mice (MF1 strain) by giving the mothers access to cages at two ambient temperatures (10 and 21 degrees C) joined by a tube. Food was available only in the cold cage, but females could also choose go to this cage to cool down while their pups were housed in the warmer cage. Control animals had access to the same configuration of cages but with both maintained at 21 degrees C. We hypothesised that if females were limited by heat dissipation, alleviating the heat load by providing a cool environment would allow them to dissipate more heat, take in more food, generate more milk and hence wean heavier litters. We measured maternal energy budgets and monitored time courses of core body temperature and physical activity. To minimise the variance in energy budgets, all litters were adjusted to 12 (+/-1) pups. Females in the experimental group had higher energy intake (F-1,F-14=15.8, P=0.0014) and higher assimilated energy (F-1,F-13=10.7, P=0.006), and provided their pups with more milk (F-1,F-13=6.65, P=0.03), consistent with the heat dissipation limit theory. Yet, despite keeping demand constant, mean pup growth rates were similar (F-1,F-13=0.06, P=0.8); thus, our data emphasise the difficulties of inferring milk production indirectly from pup growth.",2013,216,23,4326-4333
"Comparative physiological, biochemical and molecular thermal stress response profiles for two unionid freshwater mussel species","Payton, Samantha L. and Johnson, Paul D. and Jenny, Matthew J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.140129,"Freshwater mussels, aquatic keystone species, are in global decline. Long life spans, sedentary lifestyles, and unique reproductive strategies involving obligate parasitic stages make unionid freshwater mussels particularly sensitive to environmental perturbations resulting from global climate change. A greater understanding of the mechanisms by which closely related species differ in their response to thermal challenge is critical for successful conservation and management practices. As such, both an acute heat shock and a chronic warming simulation were conducted in order to evaluate responses between hypothesized thermally tolerant (Villosa lienosa) and thermally sensitive (Villosa nebulosa) freshwater mussels in response to predicted thermal warming. Multiple biological responses were quantified, including mortality, condition index, growth rates, glycogen and triglyceride content, and candidate gene expression. During acute heat shock, both species upregulated HSP90 and HSP70, although V. lienosa showed consistently greater transcript levels during upregulation. This pattern was consistent during the chronic warming simulation, with V. nebulosa showing greater induction of HSP60. Chronic warming stimulated increases in condition index for V. nebulosa; however, declines in growth rates during a recovery period were observed with no concurrent change in tissue glycogen levels. This contrasts with V. lienosa, where tissue glycogen significantly increased during chronic warming, although no response was observed for condition index or growth rates. These biological differences might indicate disparate thermal stress response mechanisms correlated with metabolic demands and resource utilization, and could thus be a factor influencing current ranges of these two species and their ability to cope with future persistent warming in their native habitats.",2016,219,22,3562-3574
Impacts of extreme climatic events on the energetics of long-lived vertebrates: the case of the greater flamingo facing cold spells in the Camargue,"Deville, Anne-Sophie and Labaude, Sophie and Robin, Jean-Patrice and Bechet, Arnaud and Gauthier-Clerc, Michel and Porter, Warren and Fitzpatrick, Megan and Mathewson, Paul and Gremillet, David",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.106344,"Most studies analyzing the effects of global warming on wild populations focus on gradual temperature changes, yet it is also important to understand the impact of extreme climatic events. Here we studied the effect of two cold spells (January 1985 and February 2012) on the energetics of greater flamingos (Phoenicopterus roseus) in the Camargue (southern France). To understand the cause of observed flamingo mass mortalities, we first assessed the energy stores of flamingos found dead in February 2012, and compared them with those found in other bird species exposed to cold spells and/or fasting. Second, we evaluated the monthly energy requirements of flamingos across 1980-2012 using the mechanistic model Niche Mapper (TM). Our results show that the body lipids of flamingos found dead in 2012 corresponded to 2.6 +/- 0.3\% of total body mass, which is close to results found in woodcocks (Scolopax rusticola) that died from starvation during a cold spell (1.7 +/- 0.1\%), and much lower than in woodcocks which were fed throughout this same cold spell (13.0 +/- 2\%). Further, Niche Mapper (TM) predicted that flamingo energy requirements were highest (+6-7\%) during the 1985 and 2012 cold spells compared with `normal' winters. This increase was primarily driven by cold air temperatures. Overall, our findings strongly suggest that flamingos starved to death during both cold spells. This study demonstrates the relevance of using mechanistic energetics modelling and body condition analyses to understand and predict the impact of extreme climatic events on animal energy balance and winter survival probabilities.",2014,217,20,3700-3707

Birds were exposed to a ramped profile of progressively increasing T-a, with continuous monitoring of behaviour and T-b used to identify the onset of severe hyperthermia. The maximum T-a birds tolerated ranged from 48 degrees C to 54 degrees C, and was positively related to M-b. Values of T-b associated with severe heat stress were in the range of 44 to 45 degrees C. Rates of evaporative water loss (EWL) increased rapidly when T-a exceeded T-b, and maximum evaporative heat dissipation was equivalent to 141-222\% of metabolic heat production. Fractional increases in EWL between T-a < 40 degrees C and the highest Ta reached by each species were 10.8 (S. squamifrons), 18.4 (P. socius) and 16.0 (P. mahali). Resting metabolic rates increased more gradually with T-a than expected, probably reflecting the very low chamber humidity values we maintained. Our data suggest that, within a taxon, larger species can tolerate higher T-a during acute heat stress.",2015,218,11,1705-1714
"Ocean acidification alters properties of the exoskeleton in adult Tanner crabs, <i>Chionoecetes bairdi</i>","Dickinson, Gary H. and Bejerano, Shai and Salvador, Trina and Makdisi, Christine and Patel, Shrey and Long, W.

In decapod crustaceans, the exoskeleton is a multilayered structure composed of chitin, protein and mineral, predominately magnesian calcite or amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC). We investigated the effects of acidification on the exoskeleton of mature (post-terminal-molt) female southern Tanner crabs, Chionoecetes bairdi. Crabs were exposed to one of three pH levels - 8.1, 7.8 or 7.5 -for 2 years. Reduced pH led to a suite of body region-specific effects on the exoskeleton. Microhardness of the claw was 38\% lower in crabs at pH 7.5 compared with those at pH 8.1, but carapace microhardness was unaffected by pH. In contrast, reduced pH altered elemental content in the carapace (reduced calcium, increased magnesium), but not the claw. Diminished structural integrity and thinning of the exoskeleton were observed at reduced pH in both body regions; internal erosion of the carapace was present in most crabs at pH 7.5, and the claws of these crabs showed substantial external erosion, with tooth-like denticles nearly or completely worn away. Using infrared spectroscopy, we observed a shift in the phase of calcium carbonate present in the carapace of pH 7.5 crabs: a mix of ACC and calcite was found in the carapace of crabs at pH 8.1, whereas the bulk of calcium carbonate had transformed to calcite in pH 7.5 crabs. With limited capacity for repair, the exoskeleton of long-lived crabs that undergo a terminal molt, such as C. bairdi, may be especially susceptible to ocean acidification.",2021,224,3,NA
Seasonal and geographical variation in heat tolerance and evaporative cooling capacity in a passerine bird,"Noakes, Matthew J. and Wolf, Blair O. and McKechnie, Andrew E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.132001,"Intraspecific variation in avian thermoregulatory responses to heat stress has received little attention, despite increasing evidence that endothermic animals show considerable physiological variation among populations. We investigated seasonal (summer versus winter) variation in heat tolerance and evaporative cooling in an Afrotropical ploceid passerine, the white-browed sparrow-weaver (Plocepasser mahali; similar to 47 g) at three sites along a climatic gradient with more than 10 degrees C variation in mid-summer maximum air temperature (T-a). We measured resting metabolic rate (RMR) and total evaporative water loss (TEWL) using open flow-through respirometry, and core body temperature (T-b) using passive integrated transponder tags. Sparrow-weavers were exposed to a ramped profile of progressively higher T-a between 30 and 52 degrees C to elicit maximum evaporative cooling capacity (N=10 per site per season); the maximum T-a birds tolerated before the onset of severe hyperthermia (T-b approximate to 44 degrees C) was considered to be their hyperthermia threshold T-a (T-a, HT). Our data reveal significant seasonal acclimatisation of heat tolerance, with a desert population of sparrow-weavers reaching significantly higher T-a in summer (49.5 +/- 1.4 degrees C, i.e. higher T-a, HT) than in winter (46.8 +/- 0.9 degrees C), reflecting enhanced evaporative cooling during summer. Moreover, desert sparrow-weavers had significantly higher heat tolerance and evaporative cooling capacity during summer compared with populations from more mesic sites (T-a, HT=47.3 +/- 1.5 and 47.6 +/- 1.3 degrees C).

To study these impacts, we exposed a common sediment-dwelling bivalve, the soft-shell clam Mya arenaria, for 21 days to chronic hypoxia (P-O2 similar to 4.1 kPa), cyclic hypoxia (P-O2 similar to 12.7-1.9 kPa, mean 5.7 kPa) or normoxia (P-O2 similar to 21.1 kPa). pH was manipulated to mimic the covariation in CO2/pH and oxygen levels in coastal hypoxic zones. Mitochondria' respiration, including proton leak, the capacity for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), the maximum activity of the electron transport system (ETS), reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and activity and oxygen affinity of cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) were assessed. Acclimation to constant hypoxia did not affect the studied mitochondrial traits except for a modest decrease in the OXPHOS coupling efficiency. Cyclic hypoxia had no effect on OXPHOS or ETS capacity, but increased proton leak and lowered mitochondrial OXPHOS coupling efficiency. Furthermore, mitochondria of clams acclimated to cyclic hypoxia had higher rates of ROS generation compared with the clams acclimated to normoxia or chronic hypoxia. CCO activity was upregulated under cyclic hypoxia, but oxygen affinity of CCO did not change. These findings indicate that long-term cyclic hypoxia has a stronger impact on the mitochondria of M. arenaria than chronic hypoxia and might lead to impaired ATP synthesis, higher costs of mitochondrial maintenance and oxidative stress. These changes might negatively affect populations of M. arenaria in the coastal Baltic Sea under increasing hypoxia pressure.",2021,224,4,NA
Divergent strategies for adaptations to stress resistance in two tropical <i>Drosophila</i> species: effects of developmental acclimation in <i>D. bipectinata</i> and the invasive species <i>D. malerkotliana</i>,"Parkash, Ravi and Singh, Divya and Lambhod, Chanderkala",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.096818,"Previous studies on two tropical Drosophila species (D. malerkotliana and D. bipectinata) have shown lower resistance to stress-related traits but the rapid colonization of D. malerkotliana in the past few decades is not consistent with its sensitivity to desiccation and cold stress. We tested the hypothesis that developmental acclimation at two growth temperatures (17 and 25 degrees C) can confer adaptations to desiccation and thermal stresses. We found divergence in developmental plastic effects on cuticular traits, i.e. a significant increase of body melanisation (similar to 2-fold) and of cuticular lipid mass (similar to 3-fold) in D. malerkotliana but only 1.5-fold higher cuticular lipid mass in D. bipectinata when grown at 17 degrees C compared with 25 degrees C. A comparison of the water budget of these two species showed significantly higher effects of developmental acclimation on body water content, rate of water loss and dehydration tolerance resulting in higher desiccation resistance in D. malerkotliana than in D. bipectinata. When grown in cooler conditions (17 degrees C), D. malerkotliana had greater resistance to cold as well as desiccation stress. In contrast, heat resistance of D. bipectinata was higher when grown at 25 degrees C. These laboratory observations are supported by data on seasonally varying populations. Furthermore, adult D. malerkotliana acclimated to different stresses showed greater resistance to those stresses than D. bipectinata adults. Thus, significant increase in stress resistance of D. malerkotliana through developmental acclimation may be responsible for its invasion and ecological success on different continents compared with D. bipectinata.",2014,217,6,924-934
Avian thermoregulation in the heat: efficient evaporative cooling allows for extreme heat tolerance in four southern hemisphere columbids,"McKechnie, Andrew E. and Whitfield, Maxine C. and Smit, Ben and Gerson, Alexander R. and Smith, Eric Krabbe and Talbot, William A. and McWhorter, Todd J. and Wolf, Blair O.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.138776,"Birds show phylogenetic variation in the relative importance of respiratory versus cutaneous evaporation, but the consequences for heat tolerance and evaporative cooling capacity remain unclear. We measured evaporative water loss (EWL), resting metabolic rate (RMR) and body temperature (T-b) in four arid-zone columbids from southern Africa [}Namaqua dove (Oena capensis, similar to 37 g), laughing dove (Spilopelia senegalensis, similar to 89 g) and Cape turtle dove (Streptopelia capicola, similar to 148 g)] and Australia {[}crested pigeon (Ocyphaps lophotes), similar to 186 g] at air temperatures (T-a) of up to 62 degrees C. There was no clear relationship between body mass and maximum T-a tolerated during acute heat exposure. Maximum T-b at very high T-a was 43.1 +/- 1.0, 43.7 +/- 0.8, 44.7 +/- 0.3 and 44.3 +/- 0.8 degrees C in Namaqua doves, laughing doves, Cape turtle doves and crested pigeons, respectively. In all four species, RMR increased significantly at T-a above thermoneutrality, but the increases were relatively modest with RMR at T-a = 56 degrees C being 32, 60, 99 and 11\% higher, respectively, than at T-a = 35 degrees C. At the highest T-a values reached, evaporative heat loss was equivalent to 466, 227, 230 and 275\% of metabolic heat production. The maximum ratio of evaporative heat loss to metabolic production observed in Namaqua doves, 4.66, exceeds by a substantial margin previous values reported for birds. Our results support the notion that cutaneous evaporation provides a highly efficient mechanism of heat dissipation and an enhanced ability to tolerate extremely high T-a.",2016,219,14,2145-2155
Non-stressful temperature effect on oxidative balance and life history traits in adult fish (<i>Oryzias latipes</i>),"Hemmer-Brepson, C. and Replumaz, L. and Romestaing, C. and Voituron, Y. and Daufresne, M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.096172,"Temperature is well known to affect many biological and ecological traits, especially in ectotherms. From a physiological point of view, temperature is also positively correlated to metabolism and is often associated with an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. It has recently been suggested that ROS play a role in lifespan and resource allocation. However, only a few authors have attempted to explore the relationships between temperature, resource allocation and oxidative balance in ectotherms. Here, we measured the effect of temperature on growth, reproductive effort, offspring quantity and quality, hatching and survival rates, and the associated proximal costs, which were evaluated through the quantification of oxidative balance elements. We reared adult fish (Oryzias latipes) at two non-stressful temperatures (20 and 30 degrees C) during a relatively long period (4 months, approximately the entire adult life). The results show a trade-off between reproduction and maintenance because investment toward growth could be neglected at the adult stage (confirmed by our results). Intriguingly, ROS-dependent damages did not differ between the two groups, probably because of the higher rate of activation of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase for warm-acclimated fish. The allocation toward antioxidant defences is associated with an earlier reproduction and a lower quality of offspring. These interesting results bring new perspectives in terms of the prediction of the impact of global warming on biota through the use of ecological theories based on oxidative balance and metabolism.",2014,217,2,274-282
UV-B exposure reduces locomotor performance by impairing muscle function but not mitochondrial ATP production,"Kazerouni, Ensiyeh Ghanizadeh and Franklin, Craig E. and Seebacher, Frank",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.131615,"Ultraviolet B radiation (UV-B) can reduce swimming performance by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. High concentrations of ROS can damage mitochondria, resulting in reduced ATP production. ROS can also damage muscle proteins, thereby leading to impaired muscle contractile function. We have shown previously that UV-B exposure reduces locomotor performance in mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) without affecting metabolic scope. Our aim was therefore to test whether UV-B influences swimming performance of mosquitofish by ROS-induced damage to muscle proteins without affecting mitochondrial function. In a fully factorial design, we exposed mosquitofish to UV-B and no-UV-B controls in combination with exposure to N-acetylcysteine (NAC) plus no-NAC controls. We used NAC, a precursor of glutathione, as an antioxidant to test whether any effects of UV-B on swimming performance were at least partly due to UV-B-induced ROS. UV-B significantly reduced critical sustained swimming performance and tail beat frequencies, and it increased ROS-induced damage (protein carbonyl concentrations and lipid peroxidation) in muscle. However, UV-B did not affect the activity of sarco-endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA), an enzyme associated with muscle calcium cycling and muscle relaxation. UV-B did not affect ADP phosphorylation (state 3) rates of mitochondrial respiration, and it did not alter the amount of ATP produced per atom of oxygen consumed (P:O ratio). However, UV-B reduced the mitochondrial respiratory control ratio. Under UV-B exposure, fish treated with NAC showed greater swimming performance and tail beat frequencies, higher glutathione concentrations, and lower protein carbonyl concentrations and lipid peroxidation than untreated fish. Tail beat amplitude was not affected by any treatment. Our results showed, firstly, that the effects of UV-B on locomotor performance were mediated by ROS and, secondly, that reduced swimming performance was not caused by impaired mitochondrial ATP production. Instead, reduced tail beat frequencies indicate that muscle of UV-B exposed fish were slower, which was likely to have been caused by slower contraction rates, because SERCA activities remained unaffected.",2016,219,1,96-102
Effects of saturation deficit on desiccation resistance and water balance in seasonal populations of the tropical drosophilid <i>Zaprionus indianus</i>,"Kalra, Bhawna and Parkash, Ravi",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.141002,"Seasonally varying populations of ectothermic insect taxa from a given locality are expected to cope with simultaneous changes in temperature and humidity through phenotypic plasticity. Accordingly, we investigated the effect of saturation deficit on resistance to desiccation in wild-caught flies from four seasons (spring, summer, rainy and autumn) and corresponding flies reared in the laboratory under season-specific simulated temperature and humidity growth conditions. Flies raised under summer conditions showed approximately three times higher desiccation resistance and increased levels of cuticular lipids compared with flies raised in rainy season conditions. In contrast, intermediate trends were observed for water balance-related traits in flies reared under spring or autumn conditions but trait values overlapped across these two seasons. Furthermore, a threefold difference in saturation deficit (an index of evaporative water loss due to a combined thermal and humidity effect) between summer (27.5 mB) and rainy (8.5 mB) seasons was associated with twofold differences in the rate of water loss. Higher dehydration stress due to a high saturation deficit in summer is compensated by storage of higher levels of energy metabolite (trehalose) and cuticular lipids, and these traits correlated positively with desiccation resistance. In Z. indianus, the observed changes in desiccation-related traits due to plastic effects of simulated growth conditions correspond to similar changes exhibited by seasonal wild-caught flies. Our results show that developmental plastic effects under ecologically relevant thermal and humidity conditions can explain seasonal adaptations for water balance-related traits in Z. indianus and are likely to be associated with its invasive potential.",2016,219,20,3237-3245
Thermal tachypnea in avian embryos,"Bicego, Kenia C. and Mortola, Jacopo P.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.171702,"Many adult mammals and birds respond to high surrounding temperatures with thermal tachypnea - an increase in breathing frequency accompanied by shallow tidal volume, with minimal increase in oxygen consumption (VO2). This pattern favors heat dissipation by evaporative water loss (EWL) through the respiratory tract. We asked to what extent this response was apparent at the earliest stages of development, when pulmonary ventilation initiates. Measurements of pulmonary ventilation (V. E; barometric technique), VO2 (open-flow methodology) and EWL (water scrubbers) were performed on chicken embryos at the earliest appearance of pulmonary ventilation, during the internal pipping stage. Data were collected, first, at the normal incubation temperature (37.5 degrees C); then, ambient and egg temperatures were increased to approximately 44 degrees C over a 2 h period. Other embryos of the same developmental stage (controls) were maintained in normothermia for the whole duration of the experiment. During heat exposure, the embryo's VO2 and carbon dioxide production increased little. In contrast, V. E more than doubled (similar to 128\% increase), entirely because of the large rise in breathing frequency (similar to 132\% increase), with no change in tidal volume. EWLdid not change significantly, probably because, within the egg, the thermal and water vapor gradients are almost nonexistent. We conclude that chicken embryos respond to a major heat load with tachypnea, like many adult mammals and birds do. Its appearance so early in development, although ineffective for heat loss, signifies that thermal tachypnea represents an important breathing response necessary to be functional from hatching.",2017,220,24,4634-4643
High <i>P</i><sub>CO2</sub> does not alter the thermal plasticity of developing Pacific herring embryos during a marine heatwave,"Murray, Christopher S. and Klinger, Terrie",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.243501,"Forage fish tend to respond strongly to environmental variability and therefore may be particularly sensitive to marine climate stressors. We used controlled laboratory experiments to assess the vulnerability of Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) embryos to the combined effects of high partial pressure of carbon dioxide (P-CO2) and a simulated marine heatwave. The two P-CO2, treatments reflected current conditions (similar to 550 mu atm) and a future extreme level (similar to 2300 mu atm). The dynamics of the heatwave (i.e. rate of onset: similar to 0.85 degrees C day(-1); maximum intensity: +4.4 degrees C) were modeled from the most extreme events detected by a long-term regional temperature dataset. Simultaneous exposure to these potential stressors did not affect embryo survival. However, the heatwave did elicit significant metabolic effects that included higher rates of routine metabolism (Q(10)=1.15-1.72). growth (Q(10)=1.87), rate of development to hatch (Q(10)=3.01) and yolk consumption (Q(10)=3.21), as well as a significant reduction in production efficiency (-10.8\%) and a three-fold increase in the rate of developmental anomalies. By contrast, high P-CO2, conditions produced comparatively small effects on vital rates, including a significant increase in time to hatch (+0.88 days) and a reduction in routine metabolic rate (-6.3\%) under the ambient temperature regime only. We found no evidence that high P-CO2, increased routine metabolic rate at either temperature. These results indicate that Pacific herring embryos possess sufficient physiological plasticity to cope with extreme seawater acidification under optimal and heatwave temperature conditions, although lingering metabolic inefficiencies induced by the heatwave may lead to important carryover effects in later life stages.",2022,225,5,NA

Here, we quantified gene expression and sensitivity to ocean acidification across a set of developmental stages in the rice coral, Montipora capitata. Embryos and swimming larvae were exposed to pH treatments of 7.8 (ambient), 7.6 (low) and 7.3 (extreme low) from fertilization to 9 days post-fertilization. Embryo and larval volume, and stage-specific gene expression were compared between treatments to determine the effects of acidified seawater on early development. Although there was no measurable size differentiation between pH treatments at the fertilized egg and prawn chip (9 h post-fertilization) stages, early gastrulae and larvae raised in reduced pH treatments were significantly smaller than those raised in ambient seawater, suggesting an energetic cost to developing under low pH. However, no differentially expressed genes were found until the swimming larval stage. Notably, gene expression patterns of larvae developing at pH 7.8 and pH 7.3 were more similar than those of larvae developing at pH 7.6. Larvae from pH 7.6 showed upregulation of genes involved in cell division, regulation of transcription, lipid metabolism and response to oxidative stress in comparison to the other two treatments. Although low pH appears to increase energetic demands and trigger oxidative stress in larvae, the developmental process is robust to this at a molecular level, with the swimming larval stage reached in all pH treatments.",2022,225,19,NA
Thermal spikes from the urban heat island increase mortality and alter physiology of lizard embryos,"Hall, Joshua M. and Warner, Daniel A.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.181552,"Effects of global change (i.e. urbanization, climate change) on adult organisms are readily used to predict the persistence of populations. However, effects on embryo survival and patterns of development are less studied, even though embryos are particularly sensitive to abiotic conditions that are altered by global change (e.g. temperature). In reptiles, relatively warm incubation temperatures increase developmental rate and often enhance fitness-relevant phenotypes, but extremely high temperatures cause death. Due to the urban heat island effect, human-altered habitats (i.e. cities) potentially create unusually warm nest conditions that differ from adjacent natural areas in both mean and extreme temperatures. Such vanation may exert selection pressures on embryos. To address this, we measured soil temperatures in places where the Puerto Rican crested anole lizard (Anolis cristatellus) nests in both city and forest habitats. We bred anoles in the laboratory and subjected their eggs to five incubation treatments that mimicked temperature regimes from the field, three of which included brief exposure to extremely high temperatures (i.e. thermal spikes) measured in the city. We monitored growth and survival of hatchlings in the laboratory for 3 months and found that warmer, city temperatures increase developmental rate, but brief, thermal spikes reduce survival. Hatchling growth and survival were unaffected by incubation treatment. The urban landscape can potentially create selection pressures that influence organisms at early (e.g. embryo) and late life stages. Thus, research aimed at quantifying the impacts of urbanization on wildlife populations must include multiple life stages to gain a comprehensive understanding of this important aspect of global change.",2018,221,14,NA
Rapid-warming tolerance correlates with tolerance to slow warming but not growth at non-optimal temperatures in zebrafish,"Asheim, Eirik R. and Andreassen, Anna H. and Morgan, Rachael and Jutfelt, Fredrik",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.229195,"Global warming is predicted to increase both acute and prolonged thermal challenges for aquatic ectotherms. Severe short- and medium-term thermal stress over hours to days may cause mortality, while longer sub-lethal thermal challenges may cause performance declines. The inter-relationship between the responses to short, medium and longer thermal challenges is unresolved. We asked if the same individuals are tolerant to both rapid and slow warming challenges, a question that has so far received little attention. Additionally, we investigated the possibility of a thermal syndrome where individuals in a population are distributed along a warm-type to cold-type axis. We tested whether different thermal traits correlate across individuals by acclimating 200 juvenile zebrafish (Danio rerio) to sub- or supra-optimal temperatures for growth (22 and 34 degrees C) for 40 days and measuring growth and thermal tolerance at two different warming rates. We found that tolerance to rapid warming correlated with tolerance to slow warming in the 22 degrees C treatment. However, individual tolerance to neither rapid nor slow warming correlated with growth at the supra-optimal temperature. We thus find some support for a syndrome-like organisation of thermal traits, but the lack of connection between tolerance and growth performance indicates a restricted generality of a thermal syndrome. The results suggest that tolerance to rapid warming may share underlying physiological mechanisms with tolerance to slower heating, and indicate that the relevance of acute critical thermal tolerance extends beyond the rapid ramping rates used to measure them.",2020,223,23,NA

Using a multiple-stressors approach, we examined whether the rate of embryonic development is affected by exposure to combinations of three factors: temperature (25, 30 and 35 degrees C), salinity (5, 15 and 34 ppt) and ambient O-2 (5\%, 13\% and 21\% O-2). Newly fertilized eggs were incubated under 27 fully factorial stressor combinations for 14 days, then allowed to recover in control conditions (30 degrees C, 34 ppt, 21\% O-2) for an additional 14 days. Growth rate was measured every 2 days throughout the experiment (N=1289). We found that the effect of isolated stressors (high temperature, low salinity or low O-2) reduced developmental success by up to 72\% (low salinity), and that stressor combinations showed stronger effects and evidence of complex interactions. For example, low O-2 had little effect individually but was lethal in combination with high temperature, and low temperature in isolation slightly decreased the rate of development but reduced the negative effects of low salinity and low O-2. Development was delayed under exposure to low O-2 but resumed upon return to control conditions after a 10 day lag. These data demonstrate that complex, synergistic interactions among abiotic stressors can substantially alter the development of a coastal invertebrate in ways that may not be predicted from the effects of the stressors in isolation.",2015,218,15,2355-2364
Stress-induced plastic responses in <i>Drosophila simulans</i> following exposure to combinations of temperature and humidity levels,"Bubliy, Oleg A. and Kristensen, Torsten N. and Loeschcke, Volker",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.092502,"Plastic responses to heat and desiccation stress in insects have been studied in many laboratory experiments on Drosophila. However, in these studies the possible interaction between the corresponding stress factors in natural environments has not been taken into consideration. We investigated changes in heat and desiccation resistance of adult Drosophila simulans after short-term exposures to different temperatures (35, 31 and 18 degrees C) in combination with high and low relative humidity (ca. 90 and 20\%, respectively). Hardening under extreme conditions (35 or 31 degrees C and low relative humidity) commonly resulted in higher resistance to heat and desiccation as compared with other less stressful combinations of temperature and humidity levels. The concentration of the heat-shock protein Hsp70 in the experimental flies increased following almost all applied treatments. Life span of the hardened flies under non-stressful conditions was reduced irrespective of the stress dose, indicating a fitness cost for the plastic responses. The results of the study show that hardening using combined heat and desiccation stress can be very efficient with regard to induction of plastic responses improving tolerance to both types of stress. This may favour adaptation to hot and dry climatic conditions, though the negative effects on fitness are likely to constrain evolution of such plastic responses.",2013,216,24,4601-4607
The role of environmental calcium in the extreme acid tolerance of northern banjo frog (<i>Limnodynastes terraereginae</i>) larvae,"Hird, Coen and Franklin, Craig E. and Cramp, Rebecca L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.244376,"Many aquatically respiring animals acutely exposed to low pH waters suffer inhibition of ion uptake and loss of branchial (gill) epithelial integrity, culminating in a fatal loss of body Na+. Environmental calcium levels ({[}Ca2+](e)) are pivotal in maintaining branchial junction integrity, with supplemental Ca2+ reversing the negative effects of low pH in some animals. Tolerance of some naturally acidic environments by aquatic animals is further complicated by low [}Ca2+](e), yet many of these environments are surprisingly biodiverse. How animals overcome the damaging actions of low pH and low environmental Ca2+ remains unknown. We examined the effects of [}Ca2+](e) on the response to low pH in larvae of the highly acid-tolerant frog Limnodynastes terraereginae. Acute exposure to low pH water in the presence of low (5 mu mol l(-1)) {[}Ca2+](e) increased net Na+ efflux. Provision of additional {[}Ca2+](e) reduced net Na+ efflux, but the effect was saturable. Acclimation to both low and high (250 mu mol l(-1)) {[}Ca2+](e) improved the resistance of larvae to Na+ efflux at low pH. Exposure to the Ca2+ channel inhibitor ruthenium red resulted in an abrupt loss of tolerance in low pH-acclimated larvae. Acclimation to acidic water increased branchial gene expression of the intracellular Ca2+ transport protein calbindin, consistent with a role for increased transcellular Ca2+ trafficking in the tolerance of acidic water. This study supports a role for {[}Ca2+](e) in promoting branchial integrity and highlights a potential mechanism via the maintenance of transcellular Ca2+ uptake in the acid tolerance of L. terraereginae larvae.",2022,225,13,NA
Choice consequences: salinity preferences and hatchling survival in the mangrove rivulus (<i>Kryptolebias marmoratus</i>),"McCain, Shelly C. and Kopelic, Sydney and Houslay, Thomas M. and Wilson, Alastair J. and Lu, Huanda and Earley, Ryan L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.219196,"In heterogeneous environments, mobile species should occupy habitats in which their fitness is maximized. Mangrove rivulus fish inhabit mangrove ecosystems where salinities range from 0 to 65 ppt, but are most often collected from areas with salinities of similar to 25 ppt. We examined the salinity preference of mangrove rivulus in a lateral salinity gradient, in the absence of predators and competitors. Fish could swim freely for 8 h throughout the gradient with chambers containing salinities ranging from 5 to 45 ppt (or 25 ppt throughout in the control). We defined preference as the salinity in which the fish spent most of their time, and also measured preference strength, latency to begin exploring the arena, and number of transitions between chambers. To determine whether these traits were repeatable, each fish experienced three trials. Mangrove rivulus spent a greater proportion of time in salinities lower (5-15 ppt) than they occupy in the wild. Significant among-individual variation in the (multivariate) behavioral phenotype emerged when animals experienced the gradient, indicating strong potential for selection to drive behavioral evolution in areas with diverse salinity microhabitats. We also showed that mangrove rivulus had a significantly greater probability of laying eggs in low salinities compared with control or high salinities. Eggs laid in lower salinities also had higher hatching success compared with those laid in higher salinities. Thus, although mangrove rivulus can tolerate a wide range of salinities, they prefer low salinities. These results raise questions about factors that prevent mangrove rivulus from occupying lower salinities in the wild, whether higher salinities impose energetic costs, and whether fitness changes as a function of salinity.",2020,223,5,NA
The alternative oxidase (AOX) increases sulphide tolerance in the highly invasive marine invertebrate <i>Ciona intestinalis</i>,"Brerner, Katharina and Yasuo, Hitoyoshi and Debes, Paul Vincent and Jacobs, Howard Trevor",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.242985,"Ecological communities and biodiversity are shaped by both abiotic and biotic factors. This is well illustrated by extreme environments and invasive species. Besides naturally occurring sulphide-rich environments, global change can lead to an increase in hydrogen sulphide episodes that threaten many multicellular organisms. With the increase in the formation, size and abundance of oxygen minimum zones and hypoxic environments, bacterial-associated sulphide production is favoured and, as such, hydrogen-sulphide-rich environments are likely to also increase in size and abundance. Many species are challenged by the inhibiting effect of sulphide on aerobic energy production via cytochrome c oxidase, ultimately causing the death of the organism. Interestingly, many protist, yeast, plant and also animal species possess a sulphide-resistant alternative oxidase (AOX). In this study, we investigated whether AOX is functionally involved in the sulphide stress response of the highly invasive marine tunicate Ciona intestinalis. At the LC50, the sulphide-induced reduction of developmental success was three times stronger in AOX knock-down embryos than in control embryos. Further, AOX mRNA levels were higher under sulphide than under control conditions, and this effect increased during embryonic development. Together, we found that AOX is indeed functionally involved in the sulphide tolerance of C. intestinalis embryos, hence, very likely contributing to its invasive potential; and that the response of AOX to sulphide seems to be controlled at the transcriptional level. We suggest that AOX-possessing species play an important role in shaping marine ecological communities, and this importance may increase under ongoing global change.",2021,224,16,NA
"No water, no problem: stage-specific metabolic responses to dehydration stress in annual killifish embryos","Zajic, Daniel E. and Nicholson, Jonathon P. and Podrabsky, Jason E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.231985,"Annual killifish survive in temporary ponds by producing drought-tolerant embryos that can enter metabolic dormancy (diapause). Survival of dehydration stress is achieved through severe reduction of evaporative water loss. We assessed dehydration stress tolerance in diapausing and developing Austrofundulus limnaeus embryos. We measured oxygen consumption rates under aquatic and aerial conditions to test the hypothesis that there is a trade-off between water retention and oxygen permeability. Diapausing embryos survive dehydrating conditions for over 1.5 years, and post-diapause stages can survive for over 100 days. Diapausing embryos respond to dehydration stress by increasing oxygen consumption rates while post-diapause embryos exhibit the same or reduced rates compared with aquatic embryos. Thus, water retention does not always limit oxygen diffusion. Aerial incubation coupled with hypoxia causes some embryos to arrest development. The observed stage-specific responses are consistent with an intrinsic bethedging strategy in embryos that would increase developmental variation in a potentially adaptive manner.",2020,223,18,NA
Additive effects of temperature and water availability on pregnancy in a viviparous lizard,"Brusch, George A. and Gavira, Rodrigo S.

However, understanding of organismal responses to fluctuations in temperature and water availability is currently lacking, especially during fundamental life-history stages such as reproduction. To further explore how temperature and water availability impact maternal physiology and reproductive output, we used the viviparous form of the European common lizard (Zootoca vivipara) in a two-by-two factorial design manipulating both hydric and thermal conditions, for the first time. We collected blood samples and morphological measurements during early pregnancy and postparturition to investigate how water availability, temperature and a combination of the two influence maternal phenology, morphology, physiology and reproductive output. We observed that dehydration during gestation negatively affects maternal physiological condition (lower mass gain, higher tail reserve mobilization) but has little effect on reproductive output. These effects are mainly additive to temperature regimes, with a proportional increase in maternal costs in warmer environments. Our study demonstrates the importance of considering combined effects of water and temperature when investigating organismal responses to climate changes, especially during periods crucial for species survival such as reproduction.",2020,223,19,NA
"Salmonid gene expression biomarkers indicative of physiological responses to changes in salinity and temperature, but not dissolved oxygen","Houde, Aimee Lee S. and Akbarzadeh, Arash and Gunther, Oliver P. and Li, Shaorong and Patterson, David A. and Farrell, Anthony P. and Hinch, Scott G. and Miller, Kristina M.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.198036,"An organism's ability to respond effectively to environmental change is critical to its survival. Yet, life stage and overall condition can dictate tolerance thresholds to heightened environmental stressors, such that stress may not be equally felt across individuals and at all times. Also, the transcriptional responses induced by environmental changes can reflect both generalized responses as well as others that are highly specific to the type of change being experienced. Thus, if transcriptional biomarkers specific to a stressor, even under multi-stressor conditions, can be identified, the biomarkers could then be applied in natural environments to determine when and where an individual experiences such a stressor. Here, we experimentally challenged juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) to validate candidate gill gene expression biomarkers. A sophisticated experimental design manipulated salinity (freshwater, brackish water and seawater), temperature (10, 14 and 18 degrees C) and dissolved oxygen (normoxia and hypoxia) in all 18 possible combinations for 6 days using separate trials for three smolt statuses (pre-smolt, smolt and de-smolt). In addition, changes in juvenile behaviour, plasma variables, gill Na+/K+-ATPase activity, body size, body morphology and skin pigmentation supplemented the gene expression responses. We identified biomarkers specific to salinity and temperature that transcended the multiple stressors, smolt status and mortality (live, dead and moribund). Similar biomarkers for dissolved oxygen were not identified. This work demonstrates the unique power of gene expression biomarkers to identify a specific stressor even under multi-stressor conditions, and we discuss our next steps for hypoxia biomarkers using an RNA-seq study.",2019,222,13,NA
Reduced thermal tolerance during salinity acclimation in brook trout (<i>Salvelinus fontinalis</i>) can be rescued by prior treatment with cortisol,"Shaughnessy, Ciaran A. and McCormick, Stephen D.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.169557,"The aims of this study were to assess whether thermal tolerance of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) is affected during seawater (SW) acclimation and to investigate the role of cortisol in osmoregulation and thermal tolerance during SW acclimation. Freshwater (FW)-acclimated brook trout at 18 degrees C (T-acc) were exposed to SW for 16 days, whilst maintaining a FW control. Fish were examined for critical thermal maximum (CTmax) 0 (before), 2, 5 and 16 days after SW exposure, and sampled at T-acc and CTmax for analysis of plasmacortisol, glucose and Cl-, gill Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) activity and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) abundance, and white muscle water content. At 2 days in SW, CTmax was significantly reduced (from 31 to 26 degrees C), and then recovered by 16 days. This transient decrease in thermal tolerance coincided with a transient increase in plasma Cl- and decrease in muscle moisture content. Salinity itself had no effect on gill HSP70 abundance compared with the large and immediate effects of high temperature exposure during CTmax testing. To examine the role of cortisol in osmoregulation, brook trout were administered a cortisol implant (5 and 25 mu g g(-1)CORT) prior to SW exposure. Both CORT doses significantly increased their capacity tomaintain plasma Cl- during SW acclimation. Treatment with the 25 mu g g(-1) CORT dose was shown to significantly improve CTmax after 2 days in SW, and CTmax was associated with plasma Cl- and muscle moisture content. These findings indicate that brook trout are sensitive to temperature during SW acclimation and that thermal tolerance is associated with ion and water balance during SW acclimation.",2018,221,6,NA
Interaction of osmoregulatory and acid-base compensation in white sturgeon (<i>Acipenser transmontanus</i>) during exposure to aquatic hypercarbia and elevated salinity,"Shaughnessy, Ciaran A. and Baker, Dan W. and Brauner, Colin J. and Morgan, John D. and Bystriansky, Jason S.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.125567,"Migratory fishes encounter a variety of environmental conditions, including changes in salinity, temperature and dissolved gases, and it is important to understand how these fishes are able to acclimate to multiple environmental stressors. The gill is the primary site of both acid-base balance and ion regulation in fishes. Many ion transport mechanisms involved with acid-base compensation are also required for the regulation of plasma Na+ and Cl+, the predominant extracellular ions, potentially resulting in a strong interaction between ionoregulation and acid-base regulation. The present study examined the physiological interaction of elevated dissolved CO2 (an acid-base disturbance) on osmoregulation during seawater acclimation (an ionoregulatory disturbance) in juvenile white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus). Blood pH (pH(e)), plasma {[}HCO3-], {[}Na+], {[}Cl-] and osmolality, white muscle water content, and gill Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) and Na+/K+/2Cl(-) co-transporter (NKCC) abundance were examined over a 10 day seawater (SW) acclimation period under normocarbia (NCSW) or during prior and continued exposure to hypercarbia (HCSW), and compared with a normocarbic freshwater (NCFW) control. Hypercarbia induced a severe extracellular acidosis (from pH 7.65 to pH 7.2) in HCSW sturgeon, and these fish had a 2-fold greater rise in plasma osmolarity over NCSW by day 2 of SW exposure. Interestingly, pHe recovery in HCSW was associated more prominently with an elevation in plasma Na+ prior to osmotic recovery and more prominently with a reduction in plasma Cl- following osmotic recovery, indicating a biphasic response as the requirements of osmoregulation transitioned from ion-uptake to ion-excretion throughout SW acclimation. These results imply a prioritization of osmoregulatory recovery over acid-base recovery in this period of combined exposure to acid-base and ionoregulatory disturbances.",2015,218,17,2712-2719
Differential reaction norms to ocean acidification in two oyster species from contrasting habitats,"Caillon, Coline and Pernet, Fabrice and Lutier, Mathieu and Di Poi, Carole",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.246432,"Ocean acidification (OA), a consequence of the increase in anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide, causes major changes in the chemistry of carbonates in the ocean with deleterious effects on calcifying organisms. The pH/P-CO2 range to which species are exposed in nature is important to consider when interpreting the response of coastal organisms to OA. In this context, emerging approaches, which assess the reaction norms of organisms to a wide pH gradient, are improving our understanding of tolerance thresholds and acclimation potential to OA. In this study, we deciphered the reaction norms of two oyster species living in contrasting habitats: the intertidal oyster Crassostrea gigas and the subtidal flat oyster Ostrea edulis, which are two economically and ecologically valuable species in temperate ecosystems. Six-month-old oysters of each species were exposed in common garden tanks for 48 days to a pH gradient ranging from 7.7 to 6.4 (total scale). Both species were tolerant down to a pH of 6.6 with high plasticity in fitness-related traits such as survival and growth. However, oysters underwent remodelling of membrane fatty acids to cope with decreasing pH along with shell bleaching impairing shell integrity and consequently animal fitness. Finally, our work revealed species-specific physiological responses and highlights that intertidal C. gigas seem to have a better acclimation potential to rapid and extreme OA changes than O. edulis. Overall, our study provides important data about the phenotypic plasticity and its limits in two oyster species, which is essential for assessing the challenges posed to marine organisms by OA.",2023,226,23,NA
Rapid blood acid-base regulation by European sea bass (<i>Dicentrarchus labrax</i>) in response to sudden exposure to high environmental CO<sub>2</sub>,"Montgomery, Daniel W. and Kwan, Garfield T. and Davison, William G. and Finlay, Jennifer and Berry, Alex and Simpson, Stephen D. and Engelhard, Georg H. and Birchenough, Silvana N. R. and Tresguerres, Martin and Wilson, Rod W.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.242735,"Fish in coastal ecosystems can be exposed to acute variations in CO2 of between 0.2 and 1 kPa CO2 (2000-10,000 mu atm). Coping with this environmental challenge will depend on the ability to rapidly compensate for the internal acid-base disturbance caused by sudden exposure to high environmental CO2 (blood and tissue acidosis); however, studies about the speed of acid-base regulatory responses in marine fish are scarce. We observed that upon sudden exposure to similar to 1 kPa CO2, European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) completely regulate erythrocyte intracellular pH within similar to 40 min, thus restoring haemoglobin-O-2 affinity to pre-exposure levels. Moreover, blood pH returned to normal levels within similar to 2 h, which is one of the fastest acid-base recoveries documented in any fish. This was achieved via a large upregulation of net acid excretion and accumulation of HCO3- in blood, which increased from similar to 4 to similar to 22 mmol l(-1). While the abundance and intracellular localisation of gill Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) and Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3) remained unchanged, the apical surface area of acid-excreting gill ionocytes doubled. This constitutes a novel mechanism for rapidly increasing acid excretion during sudden blood acidosis. Rapid acid-base regulation was completely prevented when the same high CO2 exposure occurred in seawater with experimentally reduced HCO3- and pH, probably because reduced environmental pH inhibited gill H+ excretion via NHE3. The rapid and robust acid-base regulatory responses identified will enable European sea bass to maintain physiological performance during large and sudden CO2 fluctuations that naturally occur in coastal environments.",2022,225,2,NA
An early life hypoxia event has a long-term impact on protein digestion and growth in juvenile European sea bass,"Zambonino-Infante, Jose L. and Mazurais, David and Dubuc, Alexia and Queau, Pierre and Vanderplancke, Gwenaeelle and Servili, Arianna and Cahu, Chantal and Le Bayon, Nicolas and Huelvan, Christine and Claireaux, Guy",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.154922,"Ocean warming, eutrophication and the consequent decrease in oxygen lead to smaller average fish size. Although such responses are well known in an evolutionary context, involving multiple generations, this appears to be incompatible with current rapid environmental change. Instead, phenotypic plasticity could provide a means for marine fish to cope with rapid environmental changes. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying plastic responses to environmental conditions that favour small phenotypes. Our aim was to investigate how and why European sea bass that had experienced a short episode of moderate hypoxia during their larval stage subsequently exhibited a growth depression at the juvenile stage compared with the control group. We examined whether energy was used to cover higher costs for maintenance, digestion or activity metabolisms, as a result of differing metabolic rate. The lower growth was not a consequence of lower food intake. We measured several respirometry parameters and we only found a higher specific dynamic action (SDA) duration and lower SDA amplitude in a fish phenotype with lower growth; this phenotype was also associated with a lower protein digestive capacity in the intestine. Our results contribute to the understanding of the observed decrease in growth in response to climate change. They demonstrate that the reduced growth of juvenile fishes as a consequence of an early life hypoxia eventwas not due to a change of fish aerobic scope but to a specific change in the efficiency of protein digestive functions. The question remains of whether this effect is epigenetic and could be reversible in the offspring.",2017,220,10,1846-1851
Respirometry and cutaneous oxygen flux measurements reveal a negligible aerobic cost of ion regulation in larval zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>),"Parker, Julian J. and Zimmer, Alex M. and Perry, Steve F.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.226753,"Fishes living in fresh water counter the passive loss of salts by actively absorbing ions through specialized cells termed ionocytes. lonocytes contain ATP-dependent transporters and are enriched with mitochondria; therefore ionic regulation is an energy-consuming process. The purpose of this study was to assess the aerobic costs of ion transport in larval zebrafish (Danio ratio). We hypothesized that changes in rates of Na+ uptake evoked by acidic or low Na+ rearing conditions would result in corresponding changes in whole-body oxygen consumption ((M)over dot(O2)) and/or cutaneous oxygen flux(J(O2)), measured at the ionocyte-expressing yolk sac epithelium using the scanning micro-optrode technique (SMOT). Larvae at 4 days post-fertilization (dpf) that were reared under low pH (pH 4) conditions exhibited a higher rate of Na+ uptake compared with fish reared under control conditions (pH 7.6), yet they displayed a lower (M)over dot(O2 )and no difference in cutaneous J(O2). Despite a higher Na+ uptake capacity in larvae reared under low Na+ conditions, there were no differences in (M)over dot(O2) and J(O2), at 4 dpf. Furthermore, although Na+ uptake was nearly abolished in 2 dpf larvae lacking ionocytes after morpholino knockdown of the ionocyte proliferation regulating transcription factor foxi3a, (M)over dot(O2) and J(O2) were unaffected. Finally, laser ablation of ionocytes did not affect cutaneous J(O2). Thus, we conclude that the aerobic costs of ion uptake by ionocytes in larval zebrafish, at least in the case of Na+, are below detection using whole-body respirometry or cutaneous SMOT scans, providing evidence that ion regulation in zebrafish larvae incurs a low aerobic cost.",2020,223,18,NA
Brain cooling marginally increases acute upper thermal tolerance in Atlantic cod,"Jutfelt, Fredrik and Roche, Dominique G. and Clark, Timothy D. and Norin, Tommy and Binning, Sandra A. and Speers-Roesch, Ben and Amcoff, Mirjam and Morgan, Rachael and Andreassen, Anna H. and Sundin, Josefin",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.208249,"Physiological mechanisms determining thermal limits in fishes are debated but remain elusive.

To test this, we mounted cooling plates on the heads of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and quantified whether local brain cooling increased whole-organism acute upper thermal tolerance. Brain cooling reduced brain temperature by 2-6 degrees C below ambient water temperature and increased thermal tolerance by 0.5 and 0.6 degrees C on average relative to instrumented and uninstrumented controls, respectively, suggesting that direct thermal effects on brain neurons may contribute to setting upper thermal limits in fish. However, the improvement in thermal tolerance with brain cooling was small relative to the difference in brain temperature, demonstrating that other mechanisms (e.g. failure of spinal and peripheral neurons, or muscle) may also contribute to controlling acute thermal tolerance.",2019,222,19,NA
The long road to steady state in gas exchange: metabolic and ventilatory responses to hypercapnia and hypoxia in Cuvier's dwarf caiman,"Malte, Christian Lind and Malte, Hans and Wang, Tobias",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.143537,"Animals with intermittent lung ventilation and those exposed to hypoxia and hypercapnia will experience fluctuations in the bodily O-2 and CO2 stores, but the magnitude and duration of these changes are not well understood amongst ectotherms. Using the changes in the respiratory exchange ratio (RER; CO2 excretion divided by O-2 uptake) as a proxy for changes in bodily gas stores, we quantified time constants in response to hypoxia and hypercapnia in Cuvier's dwarf caiman. We confirm distinct and prolonged changes in RER during and after exposure to hypoxia or hypercapnia. Gas exchange transients were evaluated in reference to predictions from a two-compartment model of CO2 exchange to quantify the effects of the levels of hypoxia and hypercapnia, duration of hypercapnia (30-300 min) and body temperature (23 versus 33 degrees C). For hypercapnia, the transients could be adequately fitted by two-phase exponential functions, and slow time constants (after 300 min hypercapnia) concurred reasonably well with modelling predictions. The slow time constants for the decays after hypercapnia were not affected by the level of hypercapnia, but they increased (especially at 23 degrees C) with exposure time, possibly indicating a temporal and slow recruitment of tissues for CO2 storage. In contrast to modelling predictions, elevated body temperature did not reduce the time constants, probably reflecting similar ventilation rates in transients at 23 and 33 degrees C. Our study reveals that attainment of steady state for gas exchange requires considerable time and this has important implications for designing experimental protocols when studying ventilatory control and conducting respirometry.",2016,219,23,3810-3821
"Future ocean warming may prove beneficial for the northern population of European seabass, but ocean acidification will not","Howald, Sarah and Cominassi, Louise and LeBayon, Nicolas and Claireaux, Guy and Mark, Felix C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.213017,"The world's oceans are acidifying and warming as a result of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. The thermal tolerance of fish greatly depends on the cardiovascular ability to supply the tissues with oxygen. The highly oxygen-dependent heart mitochondria thus might play a key role in shaping an organism's tolerance to temperature. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of acute and chronic warming on the respiratory capacity of European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.) heart mitochondria. We hypothesized that acute warming would impair mitochondrial respiratory capacity, but be compensated for by life-time conditioning. Increasing P-CO2 may additionally cause shifts in metabolic pathways by inhibiting several enzymes of the cellular energy metabolism. Among other shifts in metabolic pathways, acute warming of heart mitochondria of cold life-conditioned fish increased leak respiration rate, suggesting a lower aerobic capacity to synthesize ATP with acute warming. However, thermal conditioning increased mitochondrial functionality, e.g. higher respiratory control ratios in heart mitochondria of warm life-conditioned compared with cold life-conditioned fish. Exposure to high P-CO2 synergistically amplified the effects of acute and long-term warming, but did not result in changes by itself. This high ability to maintain mitochondrial function under ocean acidification can be explained by the fact that seabass are generally able to acclimate to a variety of environmental conditions. Improved mitochondrial energy metabolism after warm conditioning could be due to the origin of this species in the warm waters of the Mediterranean. Our results also indicate that seabass are not yet fully adapted to the colder temperatures in their northern distribution range and might benefit from warmer temperatures in these latitudes.",2019,222,21,NA
Aerobic capacities and swimming performance of polar cod (<i>Boreogadus saida</i>) under ocean acidification and warming conditions,"Kunz, Kristina Lore and Claireaux, Guy and Poertner, Hans-Otto and Knust, Rainer and Mark, Felix Christopher",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.184473,"Polar cod (Boreogadus saida) is an important prey species in the Arctic ecosystem, yet its habitat is changing rapidly: climate change, through rising seawater temperatures and CO2 concentrations, is projected to be most pronounced in Arctic waters. This study aimed to investigate the influence of ocean acidification and warming on maximum performance parameters of B. saida as indicators for the species' acclimation capacities under environmental conditions projected for the end of this century. After 4 months at four acclimation temperatures (0, 3, 6, 8 degrees C) each combined with two P-CO2 levels (390 and 1170 mu atm), aerobic capacities and swimming performance of B. saida were recorded following a U-crit protocol. At both CO2 levels, standard metabolic rate (SMR) was elevated at the highest acclimation temperature indicating thermal limitations. Maximum metabolic rate (MMR) increased continuously with temperature, suggesting an optimum temperature for aerobic scope for exercise (AS(ex)) at 6 degrees C. Aerobic swimming performance (U-gait) increased with acclimation temperature irrespective of CO2 levels, while critical swimming speed (U-crit) did not reveal any clear trend with temperature. Hypercapnia evoked an increase in MMR (and thereby AS(ex)). However, swimming performance (both U-gait and U-crit) was impaired under elevated nearfuture P-CO2 conditions, indicating reduced efficiencies of oxygen turnover. The contribution of anaerobic metabolism to swimming performance was very low overall, and further reduced under hypercapnia. Our results revealed high sensitivities of maximum performance parameters (MMR, U-gait, U-crit) of B. saida to ocean acidification.

Here, we compared aerobic metabolism, brain volume, boldness and accuracy of maze solving of common minnows (Phoxinus phoxinus) acclimated for 8 months to either their current optimal natural (14 degrees C) or warm (20 degrees C) water temperature. Metabolic rates indicated increased energy expenditure in warm-acclimated fish, but also at least partial thermal compensation as warm-acclimated fish maintained high aerobic scope. Warm-acclimated fish had larger brains than cool-acclimated fish. The volume of the dorsal medulla relative to the overall brain size was larger in warm-than in cool-acclimated fish, but the proportion of other brain regions did not differ between the temperature treatments. Warm-acclimated fish did not differ in boldness but made more errors than cool-acclimated fish in exploring the maze across four trials. Inter-individual differences in the number of exploration errors were repeatable across the four trials of the maze test. Our findings suggest that in warm environments, maintaining a high aerobic scope, which is important for the performance of physically demanding tasks, can come at the cost of changes in brain morphology and impairment of the capacity to explore novel environments.

Alkaline guts contribute to immunity during exposure to acidified seawater in the sea urchin larva,"Stumpp, Meike and Petersen, Inga and Thoben, Femke and Yan, Jia-Jiun and Leippe, Matthias and Hu, Marian Y.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.222844,"Larval stages of members of the Abulacraria superphylum including echinoderms and hemichordates have highly alkaline midguts. To date, the reason for the evolution of such extreme pH conditions in the gut of these organisms remains unknown. Here, we test the hypothesis that, analogous to the acidic stomachs of vertebrates, these alkaline conditions may represent a first defensive barrier to protect from environmental pathogens. pH-optimum curves for five different species of marine bacteria demonstrated a rapid decrease in proliferation rates by 50-60\% between pH 8.5 and 9.5. Using the marine bacterium Vibrio diazotrophicus, which elicits a coordinated immune response in the larvae of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, we studied the physiological responses of the midgut pH regulatory machinery to this pathogen. Gastroscopic microelectrode measurements demonstrate a stimulation of midgut alkalization upon infection with V. diazotrophicus accompanied by an upregulation of acid-base transporter transcripts of the midgut. Pharmacological inhibition of midgut alkalization resulted in an increased mortality rate of larvae during Vibrio infection. Reductions in seawater pH resembling ocean acidification conditions lead to moderate reductions in midgut alkalization. However, these reductions in midgut pH do not affect the immune response or resilience of sea urchin larvae to a Vibrio infection under ocean acidification conditions. Our study addressed the evolutionary benefits of the alkaline midgut of Ambulacraria larval stages.

Contrary to findings from previous physiological studies, we did not find an advantage to aggregation: unexpectedly, (V) over dot(CO2) and (V) over dot(H2O) did not decrease with increasing group size. (V) over dot(CO2) and (V) over dot(H2O) generally remained constant or increased in larger groups relative to individuals. The amount of water lost per unit of CO2 exchanged ((V) over dot(H2O):(V) over dot(CO2) ratio) showed a marked increase in grouped caterpillars, particularly in larger groups. Other benefits of aggregation (e. g. reduced predation or increased growth rates) likely outweigh these potential costs, because individuals of E. capensis aggregate voluntarily despite no obvious energetic or hygric advantage, and other potentially confounding group effects (e. g. increased thermoregulatory advantage or whole-animal activity) are inconsequential.

Inadequate food intake at high temperatures is related to depressed mitochondrial respiratory capacity,"Salin, Karine and Auer, Sonya K. and Anderson, Graeme J. and Selman, Colin and Metcalfe, Neil B.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.133025,"Animals, especially ectotherms, are highly sensitive to the temperature of their surrounding environment. Extremely high temperature, for example, induces a decline of average performance of conspecifics within a population, but individual heterogeneity in the ability to cope with elevating temperatures has rarely been studied. Here, we examined inter-individual variation in feeding ability and consequent growth rate of juvenile brown trout Salmo trutta acclimated to a high temperature (19 degrees C), and investigated the relationship between these metrics of whole-animal performances and among-individual variation in mitochondrial respiration capacity. Food was provided ad libitum, yet intake varied ten-fold amongst individuals, resulting in some fish losing weight whilst others continued to grow. Almost half of the variation in food intake was related to variability in mitochondrial capacity: low intake (and hence growth failure) was associated with high leak respiration rates within liver and muscle mitochondria, and a lower coupling of muscle mitochondria. These observations, combined with the inability of fish with low food consumption to increase their intake despite ad libitum food levels, suggest a possible insufficient capacity of the mitochondria for maintaining ATP homeostasis. Individual variation in thermal performance is likely to confer variation in the upper limit of an organism's thermal niche and might affect the structure of wild populations in warming environments.",2016,219,9,1356-1362

After 5 days, calcification was measured gravimetrically and survivorship estimated as the number of living recruits. Calcification was affected by the interaction of P-CO2 with light, and at 493 mu atm P-CO2 the response to light intensity resembled a positive parabola. At 878 mu atm P-CO2, the effect of light on calcification differed from that observed at 493 mu atm P-CO2, with the result that there were large differences in calcification between 493 mu atm and 878 mu atm P-CO2 at intermediate light intensities (ca. 70 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)), but similar rates of calcification at the highest and lowest light intensities. Survivorship was affected by light and P-CO2, and was highest at 122 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) in both P-CO2 treatments, but was unrelated to calcification. In June 2012 the experiment was repeated, and again the results suggested that exposure to high P-CO2 decreased calcification of P. damicornis recruits at intermediate light intensities, but not at lower or higher intensities. Together, our findings demonstrate that the effect of P-CO2 on coral recruits can be light dependent, with inhibitory effects of high P-CO2 on calcification at intermediate light intensities that disappear at both higher and lower light intensities.",2013,216,9,1570-1577
Physiological responses to hypersalinity correspond to nursery ground usage in two inshore shark species (<i>Mustelus</i> <i>antarcticus</i> and <i>Galeorhinus</i> <i>galeus</i>),"Tunnah, Louise and MacKellar, Sara R.

Gummy sharks (Mustelus antarcticus) and school sharks (Galeorhinus galeus) use the same Tasmanian estuary as a nursery ground; however, each species has distinct distribution patterns that are coincident with changes in local environmental conditions, such as increases in salinity. We hypothesized that these differences were directly related to differential physiological tolerances to high salinity. To test this hypothesis, we exposed wild, juvenile school and gummy sharks to an environmentally relevant hypersaline (120\% SW) event for 48 h. Metabolic rate decreased 20-35\% in both species, and gill Na+/K+-ATPase activity was maintained in gummy sharks but decreased 37\% in school sharks. We measured plasma ions (Na+, K+, Cl-) and osmolytes {[}urea and trimethylamine oxide (TMAO)], and observed a 33\% increase in plasma Na+ in gummy sharks with hyperosmotic exposure, while school sharks displayed a typical ureosmotic increase in plasma urea (similar to 20\%). With elevated salinity, gill TMAO concentration increased by 42\% in school sharks and by 30\% in gummy sharks. Indicators of cellular stress (heat shock proteins HSP70, 90 and 110, and ubiquitin) significantly increased in gill and white muscle in both a species- and a tissue-specific manner. Overall, gummy sharks exhibited greater osmotic perturbation and ionic dysregulation and a larger cellular stress response compared with school sharks.

Effects of repeated daily acute heat challenge on the growth and metabolism of a cold water stenothermal fish,"Guzzo, Matthew M. and Mochnacz, Neil J. and Durhack, Travis and Kissinger, Benjamin C. and Killen, Shaun S. and Treberg, Jason R.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.198143,"Temperature is an important environmental factor influencing fish physiology that varies both spatially and temporally in ecosystems. In small north temperate zone lakes, cold water piscivores rely on nearshore prey; however, this region exceeds the optimal temperature of the foraging species during summer. To cope, piscivores make short excursions into the nearshore to feed and return to cold water to digest their meal, but the physiological impacts of these repeated acute exposures to warm water are not well understood. We exposed juvenile lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) to treatments where they were held at similar to 10 degrees C and exposed to either 17 or 22 degrees C for 5-10 min daily for 53 days mimicking warm-water forays. Control fish, held at an average temperature of similar to 10 degrees C but not exposed to thermal variation, consumed more food and grew slightly faster than heat challenged fish, with no clear differences in body condition, hepatosomatic index, ventricle mass, or muscle concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase and cytochrome c oxidase. Aerobic metabolic rates measured at 10 degrees C indicated that standard metabolic rates (SMR) were similar among treatments; however, fish that were repeatedly exposed to 17 degrees C had higher maximum metabolic rates (MMR) and aerobic scopes (AS) than control fish and those repeatedly exposed to 22 degrees C. There were no differences in MMR or AS between fish exposed to 22 degrees C and control fish. These results suggest that although SMR of fish are robust to repeated forays into warmer environments, MMR displays plasticity, allowing fish to be less constrained aerobically in cold water after briefly occupying warmer waters.",2019,222,12,NA

To test the role of life-stage and stress-intensity dependence in eliciting enhanced tolerance under subsequent stress encounters, we initially conditioned pediveliger Pacific geoduck (Panopea generosa) larvae to ambient and moderately elevated P-CO2 (920 mu atm and 2800 mu atm, respectively) for 110 days. Then, clams were exposed to ambient, moderate or severely elevated P-CO2 (750, 2800 or 4900 mu atm, respectively) for 7 days and, following 7 days in ambient conditions, a 7-day third exposure to ambient (970 mu atm) or moderate P-CO2 (3000 mu atm). Initial conditioning to moderate P-CO2 stress followed by second and third exposure to severe and moderate P-CO2 stress increased respiration rate, organic biomass and shell size, suggesting a stress-intensity-dependent effect on energetics. Additionally, stressacclimated clams had lower antioxidant capacity compared with clams under ambient conditions, supporting the hypothesis that stress over postlarval-to-juvenile development affects oxidative status later in life. Time series and stress intensity-specific approaches can reveal life-stages and magnitudes of exposure, respectively, that may elicit beneficial phenotypic variation.",2021,224,13,NA
Ontogenetic variation in metabolic rate-temperature relationships during larval development,"Powers, Sean D. and Grayson, Kristine L. and Martinez, Eloy and Agosta, Salvatore J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.247912,"Predictive models of ectotherm responses to environmental change often rely on thermal performance data from the literature. For insects, the majority of these data focus on two traits, development rate and thermal tolerance limits. Data are also often limited to the adult stage. Consequently, predictions based on these data generally ignore other measures of thermal performance and do not account for the role of ontogenetic variation in thermal physiology across the complex insect life cycle. Theoretical syntheses for predicting metabolic rate also make similar assumptions despite the strong influence of body size as well as temperature on metabolic rate. The aim of this study was to understand the influence of ontogenetic variation on ectotherm physiology and its potential impact on predictive modeling. To do this, we examined metabolic rate-temperature (MR-T) relationships across the larval stage in a laboratory strain of the spongy moth (Lymantria dispar dispar). Routine metabolic rates (RMRs) of larvae were assayed at eight temperatures across the first five instars of the larval stage. After accounting for differences in body mass, larval instars showed significant variation in MR-T. Both the temperature sensitivity and allometry of RMR increased and peaked during the third instar, then declined in the fourth and fifth instar. Generally, these results show that insect thermal physiology does not remain static during larval ontogeny and suggest that ontogenetic variation should be an important consideration when modeling thermal performance.",2024,227,14,NA
Strong negative effects of simulated heat waves in a tropical butterfly,"Fischer, Klaus and Klockmann, Michael and Reim, Elisabeth",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.106245,"Climate change poses a significant challenge to all natural systems on Earth. Especially increases in extreme weather events such as heat waves have the potential to strongly affect biodiversity, though their effects are poorly understood because of a lack of empirical data. Therefore, we here explore the sensitivity of a tropical ectotherm, which are in general believed to have a low warming tolerance, to experimentally simulated climate change using ecologically realistic diurnal temperature cycles. Increasing the mean temperature permanently by 3 degrees C had mostly minor effects on developmental traits in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana. Simulated heat waves (strongly elevated temperatures for some time though retaining the same overall temperature mean), in contrast, caused strong negative effects by prolonging development time (by up to 10\%) and reducing body mass (-21\%), especially when combined with reduced relative humidity. Detrimental effects were carried over into the adult stage, diminishing subsequent performance. Most strikingly, higher temperatures suppressed adult immune function (haemocytes: -54\%, lysozyme activity: -32\%), which may potentially change the way species interact with antagonists. Heat waves thus reduced fitness parameters by 10-25\% for development time and body mass and by up to 54\% for immune parameters even in this plastic and widespread butterfly, exemplifying the potentially dramatic impact of extreme weather events on biodiversity.",2014,217,16,2892-2898
The effects of acute salinity challenges on osmoregulation in Mozambique tilapia reared in a tidally changing salinity,"Moorman, Benjamin P. and Lerner, Darren T. and Grau, E.

This was addressed through the use of an abrupt exposure to a change in salinity. We measured changes in: (1) plasma osmolality and prolactin (PRL) levels; (2) pituitary expression of prolactin (PRL) and its receptors, PRLR1 and PRLR2; (3) branchial expression of PRLR1, PRLR2, Na+/Cl- co-transporter (NCC), Na+/K+/2Cl(-) co-transporter (NKCC), alpha 1a and alpha 1b isoforms of Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), aquaporin 3 (AQP3) and Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3). Mozambique tilapia reared in a tidal environment successfully adapted to SW while fish reared in FW did not survive a transfer to SW beyond the 6 h sampling. With the exception of CFTR, the change in the expression of ion pumps, transporters and channels was more gradual in fish transferred from tidally changing salinities to SW than in fish transferred from FW to SW. Upon transfer to SW, the increase in CFTR expression was more robust in tidal fish than in FW fish. Tidal and SW fish successfully adapted when transferred to FW. These results suggest that Mozambique tilapia reared in a tidally changing salinity, a condition that more closely represents their natural history, gain an adaptive advantage compared with fish reared in FW when facing a hyperosmotic challenge.",2015,218,5,731-739
Effects of ocean acidification over successive generations decrease resilience of larval European sea bass to ocean acidification and warming but juveniles could benefit from higher temperatures in the NE Atlantic,"Howald, Sarah and Moyano, Marta and Crespel, Amelie and Kuchenmuller, Luis L. and Cominassi, Louise and Claireaux, Guy and Peck, Myron A. and Mark, Felix C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.243802,"European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) is a large, economically important fish species with a long generation time whose longterm resilience to ocean acidification (OA) and warming (OW) is not clear.

We found that in F1, OA as a single stressor at ambient temperature did not affect larval or juvenile growth and OW increased developmental time and growth rate, but OAW decreased larval size at metamorphosis. Larval routine and juvenile standard metabolic ratewere significantly lower in cold compared with warm conditioned fish and also lower in F0 compared with F1 fish. We did not find any effect of OA as a single stressor on metabolic rate. Juvenile PO2, crit was not affected by OA or OAW in both generations. We discuss the potential underlying mechanisms resulting in the resilience of F0 and F1 larvae and juveniles to OA and in the beneficial effects of OW on F1 larval growth and metabolic rate, but contrastingly in the vulnerability of F1, but not F0 larvae to OAW. With regard to the ecological perspective, we conclude that recruitment of larvae and early juveniles to nursery areas might decrease under OAWconditions but individuals reaching juvenile phase might benefit from increased performance at higher temperatures.",2022,225,9,NA
Temperature and UV-B-insensitive performance in tadpoles of the ornate burrowing frog: an ephemeral pond specialist,"Kern, Pippa and Cramp, Rebecca L. and Franklin, Craig E.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.097006,"Animals may overcome the challenges of temperature instability through behavioural and physiological mechanisms in response to short-and long-term temperature changes. When ectotherms face the challenge of large diel temperature fluctuations, one strategy may be to reduce the thermal sensitivity of key traits in order to maintain performance across the range of temperatures experienced. Additional stressors may limit the ability of animals to respond to these thermally challenging environments through changes to energy partitioning or interactive effects. Ornate burrowing frog (Platyplectrum ornatum) tadpoles develop in shallow ephemeral pools that experience high diel thermal variability (> 20 degrees C) and can be exposed to high levels of UV-B radiation. Here, we investigated how development in fluctuating versus stable temperature conditions in the presence of high or low UV-B radiation influences thermal tolerance and thermal sensitivity of performance traits of P. ornatum tadpoles. Tadpoles developed in either stable (24 C) or fluctuating temperatures (18-32 degrees C) under high or low UV-B conditions. Tadpoles were tested for upper critical thermal limits, thermal dependence of resting metabolic rate and maximum burst swimming performance. We hypothesised that developmental responses to thermal fluctuations would increase thermal tolerance and reduce thermal dependence of physiological traits, and that trade-offs in the allocation of metabolic resources towards repairing UV-B-induced damage may limit the ability to maintain performance over the full range of temperatures experienced. We found that P. ornatum tadpoles were thermally insensitive for both burst swimming performance, across the range of temperatures tested, and resting metabolic rate at high temperatures independent of developmental conditions. Maintenance of performance led to a trade-off for growth under fluctuating temperatures and UV-B exposure. Temperature treatment and UV-B exposure had an interactive effect on upper critical thermal limits possibly due to the upregulation of the cellular stress response. Thermal independence of key traits may allow P. ornatum tadpoles to maintain performance in the thermal variability inherent in their environment.",2014,217,8,1246-1252
Dose and developmental responses of <i>Anopheles merus</i> larvae to salinity,"White, Bradley J. and Kundert, Peter N. and Turissini, David A. and Van Ekeris, Leslie and Linser, Paul J. and Besansky, Nora J.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.087189,"Saltwater tolerance is a trait that carries both ecological and epidemiological significance for Anopheles mosquitoes that transmit human malaria, as it plays a key role in determining their habitat use and ecological distribution, and thus their local contribution to malaria transmission. Here, we lay the groundwork for genetic dissection of this trait by quantifying saltwater tolerance in three closely related cryptic species and malaria vectors from the Afrotropical Anopheles gambiae complex that are known to differ starkly in their tolerance to salinity: the obligate freshwater species A. gambiae and A. coluzzii, and the saltwater-tolerant species A. merus. We performed detailed comparisons of survivorship under varying salinities, using multiple strains of A. gambiae, A. coluzzii and A. merus, as well as F1 progeny from reciprocal crosses of A. merus and A. coluzzii. Additionally, using immunohistochemistry, we compared the location of three ion regulatory proteins (Na+/K+-ATPase, carbonic anhydrase and Na+/H+-antiporter) in the recta of A. coluzzii and A. merus reared in freshwater or saline water. As expected, we found that A. merus survives exposure to high salinities better than A. gambiae and A. coluzzii. Further, we found that exposure to a salinity level of 15.85. g NaCl l(-1) is a discriminating dose that kills all A. gambiae, A. coluzzii and A. coluzzii-A. merus F1 larvae, but does not negatively impact the survival of A. merus. Importantly, phenotypic expression of saltwater tolerance by A. merus is highly dependent upon the developmental time of exposure, and based on immunohistochemistry, salt tolerance appears to involve a major shift in Na+/K+-ATPase localization in the rectum, as observed previously for the distantly related saline-tolerant species A. albimanus.",2013,216,18,3433-3441

C. and Griffith, Andrew W. and Li, Ning and Manahan, Donal T.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.244518,"Understanding the mechanisms of biological responses to environmental change is a central theme in comparative and evolutionary physiology. Here, we analyzed variation in physiological responses to temperature, using 21 full-sibling larval families of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas. Pedigrees were confirmed with genetic markers for adult broodstock obtained from our breeding program. From these 21 larval families, 41 determinations of thermal sensitivity (Q(10) values) were assayed for larvae of different sizes. For respiration, thermal sensitivity was consistent within a larval family during growth, but showed significant differences among families. Different Q(10) values were evident among 21 larval families, with family accounting for 87\% of variation. Specifically, four larval families maintained an increased thermal sensitivity for respiration (Q(10) of 3). This physiology would confer resilience to rising temperature by matching the increased energy demand of protein synthesis (Q(10) of 3 previously reported). For protein synthesis, differences in Q(10) values were also observed. Notably, a family was identified that had a decreased thermal sensitivity for protein synthesis (Q(10) of 1.7 cf. Q(10) of 3 for other families), conferring an optimal energy allocation with rising temperature. Different thermal sensitivities across families for respiration (energy supply) and protein synthesis (energy demand) were integrated into models of energy allocation at the whole-organism level. The outcome of these analyses provides insights into the physiological bases of optimal energy allocation with rising temperature. These transgenerational (egg-to-egg) experiments highlight approaches to dissect components of phenotypic variance to address long-standing questions of genetic adaptation and physiological resilience to environmental change.",2022,225,22,NA
Evidence that Rh proteins in the anal papillae of the freshwater mosquito <i>Aedes aegypti </i>are involved in the regulation of acid-base balance in elevated salt and ammonia environments,"Durant, Andrea C. and Donini, Andrew",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.186866,"Aedes aegypti commonly inhabit ammonia-rich sewage effluents in tropical regions of the world where the adults are responsible for the spread of disease. Studies have shown the importance of the anal papillae of A. aegypti in ion uptake and ammonia excretion. The anal papillae express ammonia transporters and Rhesus (Rh) proteins which are involved in ammonia excretion and studies have primarily focused on understanding these mechanisms in freshwater. In this study, effects of rearing larvae in salt (5 mmol l(-1) NaCl) or ammonia (5 mmol l(-1) NH4Cl) on physiological endpoints of ammonia and ion regulation were assessed. In anal papillae of NaCI-reared larvae, Rh protein expression increased. NHE3 transcript abundance decreased and NH(4)(+ )excretion increased, and this coincided with decreased hemolymph {[}NH4+] and pH. We propose that under these conditions. larvae excrete more NH(4)(+ )through Rh proteins as a means of eliminating acid from the hemolymph. In anal papillae of NH4Cl-reared larvae, expression of an apical ammonia transporter and the Rh proteins decreased, the activities of NKA and VA decreased and increased, respectively, and this coincided with hemolymph acidification. The results present evidence for a role of Rh proteins in acid-base balance in response to elevated levels of salt, whereby ammonia is excreted as an acid equivalent.",2018,221,23,NA
Intraspecific variation in physiological performance of a benthic elasmobranch challenged by ocean acidification and warming,"Di Santo, Valentina",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.139204,"Elucidating the combined effects of increasing temperature and ocean acidification on performance of fishes is central to our understanding of how species will respond to global climate change. Measuring the metabolic costs associated with intense and short activities, such as those required to escape predators, is key to quantifying changes in performance and estimating the potential effects of environmental stressors on survival. In this study, juvenile little skate Leucoraja erinacea from two neighboring locations (Gulf of Maine, or northern location, and Georges Bank, or southern location) were developmentally acclimatized and reared at current and projected temperatures (15, 18 or 20 degrees C) and acidification conditions (pH 8.1 or 7.7), and their escape performance was tested by employing a chasing protocol. The results from this study suggest countergradient variation in growth between skates from the two locations, while the optimum for escape performance was at a lower temperature in individuals from the northern latitudes, which could be related to adaptation to the local thermal environment. Aerobic performance and scope declined in skates from the northern latitudes under simulated ocean warming and acidification conditions. Overall, the southern skates showed lower sensitivity to these climatic stressors. This study demonstrates that even mobile organisms from neighboring locations can exhibit substantial differences in energetic costs of exercise and that skates from the northern part of the geographic range may be more sensitive to the directional increase in temperature and acidification expected by the end of the century.",2016,219,11,1725-1733
Impacts of ocean acidification and warming on post-larval growth and metabolism in two populations of the great scallop (Pecten maximus),"Harney, Ewan and Rastrick, Samuel P.

Some organisms display physiological acclimatization or plasticity, but this may vary across species ranges, especially if populations are adapted to local climatic conditions. Understanding how acclimatization potential varies among populations is therefore important in predicting species responses to climate change. We carried out a common garden experiment to investigate how different populations of the economically important great scallop (Pecten maximus) from France and Norway responded to variation in temperature and PCO2 concentration. After acclimation, post-larval scallops (spat) were reared for 31 days at one of two temperatures (13 \& DEG;C or 19 \& DEG;C) under either ambient or elevated PCO2 (pH 8.0 and pH 7.7). We combined measures of proteomic, metabolic and phenotypic traits to produce an integrative picture of how physiological plasticity varies between the populations. The proteome of French spat showed significant sensitivity to environmental variation, with 12 metabolic, structural and stress-response proteins responding to temperature and/or PCO2. Principal component analysis revealed seven energy metabolism proteins in French spat that were consistent with countering ROS stress under elevated temperature. Oxygen uptake in French spat did not change under elevated temperature but increased under elevated PCO2. In contrast, Norwegian spat reduced oxygen uptake under both elevated temperature and PCO2. Metabolic plasticity allows French scallops to maintain greater energy availability for growth compared with Norwegian spat. However, increased physiological plasticity and growth in French spat may come at a cost, as they showed reduced survival compared with Norwegian scallops under elevated temperature.",2023,226,11,NA
"Going with the flow - how a stream insect, <i>Pteronarcys californica</i>, exploits local flows to increase oxygen availability","Birrell, Jackson H. and Woods, H. Arthur",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.244609,"For insects, life in water is challenging because oxygen supply is typically low compared with in air. Oxygen limitation may occur when oxygen levels or water flows are low or when warm temperatures stimulate metabolic demand for oxygen. A potential mechanism for mitigating oxygen shortages is behavior - moving to cooler, more oxygenated or faster flowing microhabitats. Whether stream insects can make meaningful choices, however, depends on: (i) how temperature, oxygen and flow vary at microspatial scales and (ii) the ability of insects to sense and exploit that variation. To assess the extent of microspatial variation in conditions, we measured temperature, oxygen saturation and flow velocity within riffles of two streams in Montana, USA. In the lab, we then examined preferences of nymphs of the stonefly Pteronarcys californica to experimental gradients based on field-measured values. Temperature and oxygen level varied only slightly within stream riffles. By contrast, flow velocity was highly heterogeneous, often varying by more than 125 cm s(-1) within riffles and 44 cm s(-1) around individual cobbles. Exploiting micro-variation in flow may thus be the most reliable option for altering rates of oxygen transport. In support of this prediction, P. californica showed little ability to exploit gradients in temperature and oxygen but readily exploited micro-variation in flow consistently choosing higher flows when conditions were warm or hypoxic. These behaviors may help stream insects mitigate lowoxygen stress from climate change and other anthropogenic disturbances.",2023,226,3,NA
Thermal tolerance and hypoxia tolerance are associated in blacktip reef shark (<i>Carcharhinus melanopterus</i>) neonates,"Bouyoucos, Ian A. and Morrison, Phillip R. and Weideli, Ornella C. and Jacquesson, Eva and Planes, Serge and Simpfendorfer, Colin A. and Brauner, Colin J. and Rummer, Jodie L.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.221937,"Thermal dependence of growth and metabolism can influence thermal preference and tolerance in marine ectothemis, including threatened and data-deficient species. Here, we quantified the thermal dependence of physiological performance in neonates of a tropical shark species (blacktip reef shark, Carcharhinus melanopterus) from shallow, nearshore habitats. We measured minimum and maximum oxygen uptake rates ((M) over dot(O2)), calculated aerobic scope, excess post-exercise oxygen consumption and recovery from exercise, and measured critical thermal maxima (CTmax), thermal safety margins, hypoxia tolerance, specific growth rates, body condition and food conversion efficiencies at two ecologically relevant acclimation temperatures (28 and 31 degrees C). Owing to high post-exercise mortality, a third acclimation temperature (33 degrees C) was not investigated further. Acclimation temperature did not affect (M) over dot(O2) or growth, but CTmax and hypoxia tolerance were greatest at 31 degrees C and positively associated. We also quantified in vitro temperature (25, 30 and 35 degrees C) and pH effects on haemoglobin-oxygen (Hb-O-2) affinity of wild-caught, non-acclimated sharks. As expected, Hb-O-2 affinity decreased with increasing temperatures, but pH effects observed at 30 degrees C were absent at 25 and 35 degrees C. Finally, we logged body temperatures of free-ranging sharks and determined that C. melanopterus neonates avoided 31 degrees C in situ. We conclude that C. melanopterus neonates demonstrate minimal thermal dependence of whole-organism physiological performance across a seasonal temperature range and may use behaviour to avoid unfavourable environmental temperatures. The association between thermal tolerance and hypoxia tolerance suggests a common mechanism warranting further investigation. Future research should explore the consequences of ocean warming, especially in nearshore, tropical species.",2020,223,14,NA
A thermoregulatory role for the medullary raphe in birds,"Cristina-Silva, Caroline and Gargaglioni, Luciane H. and Bicego, Kenia Cardoso",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.234344,"The brainstem region medullary raphe modulates non-shivering and shivering thermogenesis and cutaneous vasomotion in rodents. Whether the same scenario occurs in the other endothermic group, i.e. birds, is still unknown. Therefore, we hypothesized that the medullary raphe modulates heat gain and loss thermoeffectors in birds. We investigated the effect of glutamatergic and GABAergic inhibition in this specific region on body temperature (T-b), oxygen consumption (thermogenesis), ventilation (O-2 supply in cold, thermal tachypnea in heat) and heat loss index (cutaneous vasomotion) in 1 week old chicken exposed to neutral (31 degrees C), cold (26 degrees C) and hot (36 degrees C) conditions. Infra-medullary raphe antagonism of NMDA glutamate (AP5; 0.5, 5 mmol l(-1)) and GABA A (bicuculline; 0.05, 0.5 mmol l(-1)) receptors reduced T-b of chicks at 31 and 26 degrees C, mainly as a result of an O(2 )consumption decrease. AP5 transiently increased breathing frequency during cold exposure. At 31 degrees C, heat loss index was higher in the bicuculline and AP5 groups (higher doses) than in the saline groups at the beginning of the T-b reduction. No treatment affected any variable tested at 36 degrees C. The results suggest that glutamatergic and GABAergic excitatory influences on the medullary raphe of chicks modulate thermogenesis, and glutamatergic stimulation prevents tachypnea, without having any role in warmth-defense responses. A double excitation influence on the medullary raphe may provide a protective neural mechanism for supporting thermogenesis during early life, when energy expenditure to support growth and homeothermy is high. This novel demonstration of a thermoregulatory role for the raphe in birds suggests a convergent brainstem neurochemical regulation of T-b in endotherms.",2021,224,9,NA

We investigated whether phenotypic consequences of the thermal environment in early life remained in adulthood in two studies on Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica). Birds were raised under simulated heatwave, cold snap or control conditions, from hatching until halfway through the growth period, and then in common garden conditions until reproductively mature. We measured biometric and thermoregulatory [}metabolic heat production (MHP), evaporative water and heat loss (EWL, EHL) and body temperature] responses to variation in submaximal air temperature at the end of the thermal acclimation period and in adulthood. Warm birds had lower MHP than control birds at the end of the thermal acclimation period and, in the warmest temperature studied (40(degrees)C), also had higher evaporative cooling capacity compared with controls. No analogous responses were recorded in cold birds, although they had higher EWL than controls in all but the highest test temperature. None of the effects found at the end of the heatwave or cold snap period remained until adulthood. This implies that chicks exposed to higher temperatures could be more prepared to counter heat stress as juveniles but that they do not enjoy any advantages of such developmental conditions when facing high temperatures as adults. Conversely, cold temperature does not seem to confer any priming effects in adolescence.",2024,227,2,NA

Further analyses considered anterior and posterior gills separately, and the results showed that posterior gills are the main tissues fueling osmoregulatory-related processes because their respiration rates in dSW were 3.2-fold higher than those of anterior gills, and this was accompanied by an increase in mitochondrial density (citrate synthase activity) and increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation (1.4-fold greater, measured through electron paramagnetic resonance). Paradoxically, these posterior gills showed undisturbed caspase 3/7 activity, used here as a marker for apoptosis. This may only be due to the high antioxidant protection that posterior gills benefit from {[}superoxide dismutase (SOD) in posterior gills was over 6 times higher than in anterior gills]. In conclusion, osmoregulating posterior gills are better adapted to dSW exposure than respiratory anterior gills because they are capable of controlling the deleterious effects of the ROS production resulting from this salinity-induced stress.",2016,219,1,80-89
The osmorespiratory compromise in the euryhaline killifish: water regulation during hypoxia,"Wood, Chris M. and Ruhr, Ilan M. and Schauer, Kevin L. and Wang, Yadong and Mager, Edward M. and McDonald, M. Danielle and Stanton, Bruce and Grosell, Martin",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.204818,"Freshwater- and seawater-acclimated Fundulus heteroclitus were exposed to acute hypoxia (10\% air saturation, 3 h), followed by normoxic recovery (3 h). In both salinities, ventilation increased and heart rate fell in the classic manner, while (M) over dot(O2) initially declined by similar to 50\%, with partial restoration by 3 h of hypoxia, and no O-2 debt repayment during recovery. Gill paracellular permeability (measured with {[}C-14] PEG-4000) was 1.4-fold higher in seawater, and declined by 50\% during hypoxia with post-exposure overshoot to 188\%. A similar pattern with smaller changes occurred in freshwater. Drinking rate (also measured with {[}C-14] PEG-4000) was 8-fold higher in seawater fish, but declined by similar to 90\% during hypoxia in both groups, with post-exposure overshoots to similar to 270\%. Gill diffusive water flux (measured with (H2O)-H-3) was 1.9-fold higher in freshwater fish, and exhibited a similar to 35\% decrease during hypoxia, which persisted throughout recovery, but was unchanged during hypoxia in seawater fish. Nevertheless, freshwater killifish gained mass while seawater fish lost mass during hypoxia, and these changes were not corrected during normoxic recovery. We conclude that this hypoxia-tolerant teleost beneficially reduces gill water permeability in a salinity-dependent fashion during hypoxia, despite attempting to simultaneously improve (M) over dot(O2), but nevertheless incurs a net water balance penalty in both freshwater and seawater.",2019,222,18,NA
